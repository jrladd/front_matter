      <p>In the five chapters of this dissertation I have covered different kinds of relationships, each shaping the form of literary texts. I began with the antiquarian collaboration that produced the chorographic networks of <em>Poly-Olbion</em>; from there I explored the relationality of printed poetry collections; the rivalries of Shakespeare and Dryden; the coterie culture of Katherine Philips; and John Aubrey’s accounts of relational authorship in <em>Brief Lives</em>. As these examples demonstrate, the traditional scholarly definition of collaboration—co-authorship among two or more contemporaries—is not sufficient for an understanding of the range of social relations and literary form. What we need is a broader definition of collaboration, one that encompasses a number of social and textual relationships and considers their impact on literary form.</p>
      <p>Perhaps there are some natural objections to this approach. (1) Wouldn’t defining collaboration in this way make every text a collaborative one? I do not argue that every single text should be defined as “collaborative,” but I do want scholars to see every text as part of a system of social relations, and to understand that the form of a text and its sociality are mutually constitutive. In this way my work follows from D.F. McKenzie’s <em>Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts</em> and the several decades of book history scholarship that followed. What I have provided in this dissertation is a series of case studies that fills in the outline of the authorship networks that constitute early modern literature. But is there a way to understand the full range of relationships that bear on literary forms?</p>
      <p>That brings me to the second objection. (2) Isn’t this system of collaboration so vast as to defy any attempts to understand it as a whole? I have already shown that sensitivity to social relationships can change one’s critical view of a single text or single author. But how can we understand the complete range of relationships that make up the system of collaboration? At the end of the last chapter, I proposed a method for understanding the work of authorship using quantitative network analysis to examine authors in their social systems. In this brief coda, I propose using network visualization to map collaborative relations by deriving them from printed book dedications. In fact, all of the relationships I have covered in the chapters of this dissertation can be traced through paratexts. To conclude, I would like to use a specific kind of paratext, the dedication, to begin to define a broader scope of collaborative literary relations in the early modern period. The historical persons, literary influences, religious figures, and social climbers mentioned in printed book dedications constitute the imaginative network of a text—those figures whom the dedicator has invoked as necessary to the book’s intellectual world.</p>

      <p>In <em>How To Talk About Books You Haven’t Read</em>, Pierre Bayard encourages us to consider the imaginative relation among books rather than simply the contents or immediate social circumstances of a particular text. Bayard’s work is itself importantly connected to two intellectual traditions I have been tracing throughout this dissertation. In “Digital Shakespeare,” Martin <span class="citation" data-cites="mueller_digital_2008">Mueller</span> relates Bayard’s practices of non-reading to the habits and tactics of distant reading—and by extension to the larger field of computational literary analysis. And by Bayard’s interest in connection over intention, the book is tied to <span class="citation" data-cites="latour_reassembling_2005">Latour</span>’s actor-network theory as expressed in 2007’s <em>Reassembling the Social</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> However while Latour is less interested in the role of texts within his actor-networks, Bayard posits a network of text relations independent of authors and individual experiences of reading.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Bayard’s interest in textual networks and the production of meaning overlaps with my own interest in the issues that make up this dissertation—in group production, collective reading, and diffuse literary agency. This network project attempts to observe the traces of overlapping and diffuse acts of reading and writing across a wide span of time in order more fully to understand the imaginative relations between early modern texts and to show the impact of those many connections throughout the early modern period.</p>
      <p>In the same section from which my epigraph is taken, Bayard discusses the importance of metadata for understanding the network of “connections and correlations” among books. Many network projects that attempt to understand the world of early modern print use forms of metadata—information, like titles, subject headings, and publication information, extrinsic to the text itself—rather than the contents of the text or any part of the text. <em>Shakeosphere</em> is made from metadata: the information in the English Short Title Catalog. <em>Six Degrees</em> is derived from the metacommentary on social relationships available in the secondary sources of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. <em>Historical Text Networks</em> are made from a combination of Early English Books Online metadata, imprint information specifically, and additional information from paratexts. Paratexts occupy a liminal position between data and metadata. As part of the primary source, they can be considered data itself, but for the ways they comment on and relate to the main text, they are also a form of metadata. My project takes a specific paratextual form, the dedication, as its main source of (meta)data.</p>
      <p>The idea for this project came out of my reading of John Dryden’s many long dedications, epistles, and prefaces; Dryden does not limit himself to discussing only the dedicatee of the text: he winds his way through an extensive network of patrons, friends, detractors, rivals, and literary influences. As I discussed in Chapter 3, Dryden alludes to Lord Rochester in his preface to <em>All for Love</em> as one of his “sucking Critics”, referring to him as that “Rhyming Judge of the Twelve-penny Gallery” among other nasty nicknames.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> By this time in his career, Dryden’s once friendly patronage relation with Rochester had become a bitter rivalry, and as evidenced by the lengthy riposte to Rochester in the preface, this literary competition clearly took up some space in Dryden’s psyche. As I argue in that chapter, the rivalry has an impact not only on the mentality or psychology of the author but on the text itself—Dryden reframes the imitative <em>All for Love</em> as a kind of competition with Shakespeare’s <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>. The invocation of Rochester therefore signals competition in another way. <em>All for Love</em> comprises a competitive landscape of the imagination that importantly includes Rochester. The paratext, as a carrier of social information about the text, allows the reader insight into the imaginative networks that build the text.</p>
      <p>While it inspired the project, Rochester’s appearance by proxy in the preface to <em>All for Love</em> presents a series of problems for working with paratext mentions at scale. Importantly Rochester is only alluded to in the text and not directly mentioned at all. On top of that, the allusion occurs in the preface to the play rather than its dedication. A full account of collaborative networks must entail attention to such powerful, but shadowy linkages as Rochester’s influence on <em>All for Love</em>, and not only is it not directly exerted on the sample I have chosen – the dedicatory paratext – but its influence on the preface cannot yet be captured algorithmically. Therefore to make headway on this project, I had to find ways to limit its scope.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> While progress is being made on textual and personal allusion (as an extension of the problem of text reuse), for the sake of this project finding direct mentions of names was difficult enough. Likewise there are many kinds of paratexts (encomia, dedications, prefaces, etc.) that provide different sorts of information about the imaginative space of the text. A future version of the project could capture names and allusions in every paratext, using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to keep track of their sources for more nuanced analyses. In this project, I simplified by adhering to the most common type of paratext, the dedication, which also usually includes the most direct references to individual people.</p>
      <p>Given this limitation, what kinds of information can we expect to find in dedications? Historians of the book have long noted the crucial role of patrons, publishers, printers, and booksellers alongside authors in the process of text creation. These individuals, all important parts of the network of early modern print, can be easily discovered by traditional research methods and are often important to textual metadata in online archives like Early English Books Online.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> But like the Rochester allusion, dedications include even more names. Who else, besides dedicator and dedicatee, is mentioned in a dedication? Consider this example from EEBO-TCP–the dedication to Samuel Hartlib’s <em>A description of the famous Kingdome of Macaria</em> (1641):</p>
      <section class="scrolly">
      <figure class="sticky tc z-1 w-100 bg-near-white ma0">
        <img src="img/hartlib.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>This dedication follows the conventional form by including an elaborate header that addresses the dedicatee, in this case the “High and Honorable Court of Parliament” rather than any single individual. But Hartlib names two other individuals, More and Bacon, in the body of the dedication, and he even labels them as his “pattern” or role models in this publishing venture. Neither More (who died in 1535) nor Bacon (who died in 1626) would show up in a network graph focused on reconstituting the lived early modern social world of 1641, but Hartlib mentions them at the book’s opening. This habit of non-contemporary naming is repeated in the texts of many early modern dedications: some of the individuals mentioned have died recently, others are writers and influences from another time entirely, and others are living persons from far outside the London social structure. Of course scholars have long traced the networks of influences and allusions that surround literary texts, but we have been slower to consider these relations in concert with the social and economic relations that make up early modern writing. The imaginative network of a text involves all of these figures together, and by considering them in a single network, a peopled imagination, we can better understand the many motivations that underlie text creation, including social and cultural aspiration, anxieties of influence, patronage, and social relationships.</p>
      </section>
      <p>I also use this example to highlight something important about the way we conceive of print networks: just as the landscape of reading is made up of recently published texts and texts that first appeared long before, the landscape of print is made up of actors who are not physically present in the social world but are nonetheless crucial to understanding how the relation between persons and texts was constructed. The lack of physical presence is not a critical problem because the networks I am building are not social networks in the traditional sense—they are imaginative networks. The relation between an author or text and a name mentioned in a dedication is an imaginative relation. When an author does not personally know the individual they are invoking in a dedication, or even when they do, the appearance of that name stakes out an intellectual and imaginative space for the <em>idea</em> of that person that could but need not necessarily fall back on any first-hand relationship with that person. These imaginative relations abound during the creation of a text—we all carry the ideas of many people we may not currently know: public figures, deceased relatives, people we would like to meet. A dedication is one place where these imaginative relations can take form through naming, direct reference, and allusion. My project attempts to recover these relations—at least the ones available through direct reference—and map them at scale.</p>
      <p>Where Michael <span class="citation" data-cites="gavin_historical_2016">Gavin</span>‘s networks are based only on the author and direct recipient of certain paratexts, by capturing a wider range of names <em>within</em> dedications I am able to make suppositions about the wider set of correlations and connections across time that make up early modern print. Douglas <span class="citation" data-cites="duhaime_co-citation_nodate">Duhaime</span> may have gotten closest to this kind of network in his co-citation network of texts derived from bibliographic citations present in early modern texts.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> But I am interested in the ways in which living social relationships and textual citations and influences overlap. I accomplish this by a deliberate refusal not to eliminate names that I find within dedications—in effect capturing both those long-dead figures who may have influenced the book and the author’s direct contemporaries who may have had a direct hand in the book’s production. While this approach differs from other network analysis projects, it follows a well-established model of historical work that connects living and long-dead authors through lines of influence. Through this decision not to eliminate names I show that the many types of relations to a book sketched in its dedication need not be so different from one another, and that to understand the full field of early modern print it is necessary that we consider the whole network together. Rather than thinking of networks’ tendency to flatten time as a drawback, I hope to use it here to my critical advantage.</p>
      <p>With this operating principle, I employed a method for finding names in dedications indiscriminately, concerning myself only with the fact that a name appeared in a dedication and not with why or how. What can we learn by studying the patterns of these names when we gather them at an increased scale, and how might such patterns direct our energies in the study of particular persons or texts?</p>
      </article></section><section class="sectionhead" id="methods"><p class="tc f2 lh-title">Methods</p><article class="relative">
      <p>Before I attempt some preliminary answers to the questions raised in the previous section, a brief overview of the method used here will be useful. Up to this point my dissertation work has focused on the most recognizable and widely-used form of social networks: networks of people, alive at the same time, whose relationship to one another formed a direct interaction.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> But the question of simultaneity has run all through the different case studies in the previous chapters. It was present in Selden’s continued interest, even decades after the fact, in the issues Drayton set forth in <em>Poly-Olbion</em>; it was a concern for James Philips as he shepherded his late wife’s poetry into print; and it was certainly on Dryden’s mind as he translated Virgil and adapted the plays of Shakespeare. Anyone who works within network analysis has had to confront the dimensions of time—a common criticism of networks as a form is that their mathematical and visual representations flatten time.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Many network projects deal with this issue by limiting their dataset to specific timespans. <em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> only allows a relation or edge to exist between two persons while they are alive at the same time. But if they did not live simultaneously, <em>Six Degrees</em> will not record a relation between them <span class="citation" data-cites="warren_six_2016">(Warren et al.)</span>. Likewise, in their networks of the print record, Blaine <span class="citation" data-cites="greteman_shakeosphere_nodate">Greteman</span>’s <em>Shakeosphere</em> and Michael <span class="citation" data-cites="gavin_historical_2016">Gavin</span>’s <em>Historical Text Networks</em> only record relations among people producing texts together at the same time. These limitations make sense if your purpose, as it is in these projects, is to create an accurate, traditional social network of contemporaneous relationships. While this restriction is helpful in most cases, networks that have more flexible interpretative frameworks can tell us much more as we increase the scope of our data.</p>
      <p>The network is based on texts available through the Early English Books Online, Text Creation Partnership (EEBO-TCP) public release, a collection of approximately 25,000 early modern texts printed in England (or written in English) that were first converted to microfilm and eventually digital images—as EEBO—and then hand-keyed into eXtensible Markup Language (XML)—as the TCP. Thanks to the thorough tagging work of the TCP, I was able easily to extract plaintext of every section of a text marked up as a “DEDICATION.” The “DEDICATION” attribute is not infallible: there may be certain dedicatory text-segments that were not marked as dedications, as well as other types of paratext (encomia, prefaces, etc.) that were given the wrong tags. A future version of this project may attempt to be more all-encompassing in its approach to paratext.</p>
      <p>Early modern texts present many challenges to named-entity recognition (NER), the natural language processing technique I used to find names of persons in those dedications. Irregular orthography, non-standardized capitalization, initialism, pseudonymy, and anonymity all present distinct challenges to computer-assisted name recognition. To deal with some of these challenges, I began by processing the text through MorphAdorner, Northwestern University’s tool for standardizing and part-of-speech tagging digitized text. MorphAdorner regularizes words, standardizes spelling, and add tags for parts of speech. I tried a number of ready-made NER approaches, including the popular Stanford NER, NLTK, and SpaCy software packages, before I found one that handled the challenges of early modern names. The drawback of all these NER classifiers is that they are trained on modern language corpora (usually on a news corpus) and therefore much better suited to finding names in modern language texts. I could train a classifier myself if I had a substantial corpus of early modern texts in which names were already tagged, but such a corpus does not exist. Instead I was able to take advantage of part-of-speech tagging within MorphAdorner, which unlike the other natural language processing tools is designed to work well on early modern language. MorphAdorner does not have an NER classifier, but it detects proper nouns with greater accuracy than other tools. Beginning with MorphAdorner’s list of proper nouns, I was able to write a short list of rules in Python that pulled out the names and dealt with much of the spelling variation in the corpus. However I kept only the words identified by the script as multi-term names of persons. I eliminated single-term names because most of them were either the result of error (one-word Latin terms the script wrongly identified as names) or impossible to disambiguate (the one-word name “James” would likely appear in many dedications, but there is no way of knowing to whom it refers).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> All multi-term names (including ones like “Queen Elizabeth” in which one word is a title or other identifier) were included in the final graph, which is drawn in JavaScript using Mike Bostock’s D3 force-directed graph script.</p>

          <p>Readers already familiar with network analysis may recognize the resulting network’s features, but it is worth walking through some of the basic attributes to highlight their importance to my analysis. Networks are made up of <span class="step" data-step="start">nodes (usually represented as circles) which stand for the entities that are connected</span>, and edges (usually represented as lines), which stand for the connections themselves. Though in social networks nodes typically represent people and edges represent social relationships, networks are a data structure that can hold any kind of relational information. <span class="step" data-step="add-edges">It is possible to have a network of cell phone towers, a network of bivalve reproduction, a network of foods and their tastes <span class="citation" data-cites="ahn_flavor_2011">(Ahn et al.)</span></span>. The important thing in a network is to carefully define the nature of the edge relation, but that connection (even when the entities are people) need not be a human relationship. A network of people could be connected by who shares the same height or eye color. In my project, a connection is nothing more or less than a name’s presence in a dedication—sometimes this maps onto a social relationship, and sometimes it does not. One of the purposes of this project is to interrogate the overlap and gaps between a social relationship and a dedicatory mention.</p>
          <p>Most network projects, including the early modern projects I mentioned above, use unimodal network graphs, in which nodes represent only one class of object: people. The networks I created for this project are bimodal or bipartite; there are two types of nodes which represent two classes of objects, people and texts. <span class="step" data-step="recolor">Usually the two types are represented by node color or shape—in my visualizations a person node is orange while a text node is blue.</span> My choice of a bipartite network is as much ideological as it is technical. In a bimodal graph, a node can only connect to a node of its opposite type; therefore in my graph, people can only be connected through texts represented in the TCP corpus.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> My dedicatory networks do not graph the abstract early modern social world: instead they graph a series of relations mediated by printed objects, which themselves have a place within the structure of the graph. Seeing texts alongside persons in a network helps us to reconsider what counts as “social” in the world of early modern print, and the widened scope of the NER script expands the boundaries of who “counts” as a collaborator or influence with/on a text. In the 1639-48 graph, “S. Paul” and “Lord Hastings” are connected through a text by William Parks. This is not to say that Parks’ relationship to the religious figure and the lordly patron are the same, but it highlights how dedicatory practice expands our notion of relevant social figures.</p>
          <p>As Michael <span class="citation" data-cites="gavin_historical_2016">Gavin</span> does, I could have represented texts as edges and left only one kind of node: people. However I want to call attention to the ways in which texts mark people (through their dedications) as well as the ways in which people mark texts. I accomplish this in two ways. The first is that I use a directed network rather than an undirected one. A network is directed when its connections cannot be reciprocal. Letter networks are a classic example: a letter has a sender and a recipient. <span class="step" data-step="add-arrows">Network analysts use the terms <em>source</em> and <em>target</em> to refer to these two different sides of a directed connection, and directed edges are usually represented by displaying an arrow at one end of the line.</span> A network is undirected when its connections are mutual or reciprocal. A network of Facebook friends is an undirected network, as two “friends” on the service must mutually assent to share a relationship. When processing texts, I kept track of who appeared in the body of a dedication, in its salutation, and in its closing. Because dedications normally have this structure, a dedication network is similar to a directed letter network. When a name appears in the closing of a dedication, that person is typically the dedicator (and also usually the author of the book), so the person is the source of the relation while the text is the target. When a name appears in the salutation or body of a dedication, the person is the target of the relation while the source is the book—in this case the book’s dedication has marked that person as somehow important to the text, either as a dedicatee, an influence, a citation, or some other referent.</p>
          <p>The other way in which I reinforce that the network of texts is as important as the network of people is through a technique called <em>projection</em>. In a bipartite network, it is possible to project the network onto one set of relations or another. Projection assumes mutual connection to nodes of one part as a connection between nodes of the other. <span class="step" data-step="project-people">Two people who are connected to the same text would, when the network is projected, be connected to one another.</span> Likewise two texts that mention the same person would be connected to each other if the network were projected over texts. In this way it is possible to view my network in three ways: as a network of people and texts, as a network of people <em>connected by</em> texts, <span class="step" data-step="project-text">and as a network of texts <em>connected by</em> people</span>. The network of texts makes an especially important rhetorical point, since in my network I am never dealing with actual persons but always with textual proxies for those people.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Even when identifying people, the network is primarily textual.</p>
          <p>I began by discussing the limitations and affordances of using networks to describe connections over time, and there are several ways I deal with time in the network visually and analytically. The first is simply in terms of color. I already mentioned I use different hues, orange and blue, to represent people and texts respectively. <span class="step" data-step="color-scale">But within the blue nodes, I use a gradient from light to dark blue to represent the publication date of the text.</span> This gives a quick visual sense of where a text falls roughly when looking at a graph that has a large timespan. Because I do not limit relations by timespan, i.e. I do not discount a relationship because the person was not alive when the book was published, it becomes easy to see which figures are connected to texts from across the period. In these cases the affordances of “flat” network visualization show through; the reader can tell right away when a certain figure has dedicatory staying power for a long period of time.</p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <p>However showing time only in terms of color gradient is inexact: you can see rough temporal distinctions, but these often are not enough for a scholar looking to draw conclusions about dedicatory networks in specific time periods. To answer these questions, I made it possible to draw a sliding time filter across the whole network, borrowing a technique I helped to develop while working on <em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em>. At the bottom of the network visualization is a bar graph showing the number of texts with dedications in each year. By resizing and/or sliding a window across that graph, you can easily select a specific, shorter time period and look at the nodes and edges only in that period.</p>
      <p>A major impetus for conducting this project was my desire to see how dedication networks changed across periods of political crisis and upheaval. To do this I initially collected data that was pre-organized by time period. For example I collected and processed texts only from the approximate years of civil conflict (1639-49), then from the Republican and Protectorate rule (1650-59), then the Restoration (1660-85), and so on, to compare the political eras. However having texts in predefined groupings limited my perspective on the data. You might instead want to organize texts by different periods of press freedom, using 1642 as a dividing line.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Having an interactive filter, and being able to clearly see the frequency of dedications across time, allows scholars browsing the network to make those decisions for themselves. And it allowed me to begin to see patterns in dedicatory practice, influence, and collaboration across time.</p>

      <p>The “Background, Method, Results” structure taken from the sciences and now more frequently adopted by digital humanists does not lend itself well to most humanities arguments. While some computational projects have clear results that can be reported, most examples of DH writing, including this one, require reflection and interpretation unsuited to the finality that the word “results” implies. While I do intend to report on conclusions drawn from this data, an equally important outcome of the data collection and visualization done in this project is its wider usefulness for other scholars with different questions about dedicatory practice in the early modern period. To facilitate both of these outcomes, I provide here both an interpretation of the data with respect to my research questions and a reflection on the exploration interface I built to enable further study of this dataset.</p>
      <p>Even a cursory browse of the network data allows me to make some claims about patterns in early modern dedicatory practice. Looking at the network over time, we see that the network’s basic structure is unchanged despite many political, social, and religious changes.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The network’s density—a measure of the relative number of edges to nodes in a network that expresses how connected the social world is—remains consistent over time despite including every name in each dedication. In the graph below, the blue line shows the smoothed out trend: after some variation in the earlier years of print (when the networks are so small as to be unrepresentative), the trend quickly flattens out.</p>
      <figure class=" tc z-1 w-100 bg-near-white ma0">
      <img src="img/density.png" alt="Network Density over Time" /><figcaption>Network Density over Time</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is true even though the number of nodes in these networks is trending upwards over time (commensurate with increases in the number of texts printed):</p>
      <figure class=" tc z-1 w-100 bg-near-white ma0">
      <img src="img/nodecount.png" alt="Total Number of Nodes over Time" /><figcaption>Total Number of Nodes over Time</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Though the network includes a mixture of figures from the distant past, those of the recent past, and living 16th and 17th-century people, the basic structure matches a typical social network. This suggests that the social behaviors surrounding dedications occur regardless of whether the participants in that network are alive. Aristotle can have as much influence in the network as Shakespeare, though of a different kind. In other words, the imaginative network of early modern print behaves like a “real” network, despite a preponderance of names from far outside of the period.</p>
      <p>In fact, names from the distant past appear with more regularity across the corpus than contemporary figures almost as a rule. I see this as an important corrective to the typical practice of using dedications to tell us only about author-patron relations. It is now a commonplace in studies of reception to recognize that readers do not choose only from a crop of books newly published in a given era, but from a variety of books published before then. Reading practices are often backward-looking, and any one person’s reading can include books published across a long span of time. Likewise with dedicatory practice, while early modern books are almost always dedicated to a living person, the names that appear in dedications can include a range of influences, citations, and relations from across a very wide span. A dedication—whether written before or after the main text—works along with other paratexts to signal the reader to the book’s wide imaginative network. The invocation of names in the dedication allows readers to situate a book and its author within a network of influences, citations, and allusions. Repetition of a particular referent across several book dedications builds up a set of connections between books, and may suggest the importance of particular figures in networks of reading and book production over time.</p>
      <p>The first thing we may ask of the data, then, is how to determine which referents are most important in the network over time. The traditional way to measure a node’s importance within a network is through a set of measures under the umbrella term “centrality.” The simplest kind of centrality is degree—the number of connections a single node possesses. If a person has relationships with ten other people, their degree is ten. Betweenness centrality measures how often a node connects disparate groups or communities within the network. These two centrality measures can be used together as a tool for thinking about a name’s importance in the dedicatory network. Below is a graph of the top ten appearing names over all and the number of mentions each received per year.</p>
      <p><img src="img/topten_degree.png" alt="Top Ten Names and Mentions Per Year" /><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
      <p>In a bipartite network like this one, the raw mentions count is an insufficient account of a node’s degree, as we want to know how many other people (and not just texts) to which an individual is connected. Here is the same graph reorganized by degree on its projected graph, an extrapolation of basic degree that gets at this question:<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
      <figure class=" tc z-1 w-100 bg-near-white ma0">
      <img src="img/topten_projecteddegree.png" alt="Top Ten Names and Projected Degree Per Year" /><figcaption>Top Ten Names and Projected Degree Per Year</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Consider the degree of Queen Elizabeth (in green on the graph above). Variations on her name appear throughout the corpus, beginning as Princess Elizabeth before her reign and hitting a high point in the decade before her death. Her degree from 1595 to 1603 is 163, outstripping perennially common names such as St. Augustine and St. Paul.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> It is not at all surprising that Elizabeth’s height in the network would be at the conclusion of her reign, when many authors would seek her favor by dedicating a book to her, or even by giving her a mention in a dedication to someone else. Significantly, Elizabeth’s influence does not decrease as much after her death as one would think. If we only looked at dedicatees we would see a steep drop-off, but Elizabeth remains in or near the top 10 nodes by degree all the way through 1640s and 50s. By looking in this mathematical way network at the network over time, we get a more complete view of a person’s symbolic and literary importance. An individual’s effect on reading, writing, and publishing extends long after their death.</p>
      <p>The highest centrality name across the period, regardless of the centrality measure chosen, is Jesus Christ. On its face this observation does not tell us much—of course many early modern books, a large portion of which concern religious matters, would mention Christ in their dedications. However betweenness centrality tells a different story. While accounting for nodes like “Jesus Christ” that are so common they break the scale, most thematic names like Caesar or St. Augustine tend to have high degree but low betweenness centrality. That is to say, they are mentioned by a lot of texts in the same part of the network, but they don’t tend to connect different parts of the network to one another.</p>
      <p>Betweenness centrality can give us a sense of those names which are used in a variety of texts in different network communities. This likely suggests that they tie together texts that would otherwise be linked only by one or two of the major names in the top ten. The names with high betweenness centrality, which tend to belong to contemporary or recent political figures, give structure to the overall network. Removing these names would cause the network to be divided into disconnected components around the high-degree names. Some of the names in this group are patrons, others are important political figures—like Elizabeth I and James I—who are likely being used to lend prestige to the book. Rather than being tied to the book’s thematic content, these names seem to be used in a more political way, to associate the book with the prestige of a known entity but still to situate it within its specific political, social, and cultural context.</p>
      <figure class=" tc z-1 w-100 bg-near-white ma0">
      <img src="img/topten_betweenness.png" alt="Top Ten Names by Betweenness and their Betweenness Centrality Per Year" /><figcaption>Top Ten Names by Betweenness and their Betweenness Centrality Per Year</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The relation between a book’s contents and its dedicatory mentions calls attention to the importance of framing the data as a bipartite network. Rather than merely being a network of people connected by texts, this data tells us as much, if not more, about the connections among texts as those among people. The popularity of different kinds of books lends itself to the appearance of certain names in dedications, and the appearance of those names signals the popular categories in which books belong. In the 1590s and early 1600s, for example, the increased centrality of Luther, Calvin, and Hus signals a growing market for Protestant texts in the late part of Elizabeth’s reign as well as an increase in the desire among authors to curry social favor by espousing interest in major Protestant thinkers. The social concerns of dedicatory practice and the economic ones are inextricably linked—by viewing texts and names together we get a better sense of the way these two drivers for dedicatory naming overlap.</p>
      <p>Beyond the transhistorical importance of specific names and texts, the same data can be used to address the question of changes in dedicatory practice over time. The best test case for this is the original impetus for the project, the period spanning from the 1630s through the 1660s. How did political upheaval change dedicatory practice and by extension the literary networks of the seventeenth century? Slicing the network by decade instead of by year makes this kind of analysis possible.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
      <p>By degree:</p>
      <p><img src="img/topten_decade.png" /></p>
      <p>By betweenness centrality:</p>
      <p><img src="img/decade_betweenness.png" /></p>
      <p>Looking at the network in the 1630s, many of the top names are similar to those of previous decades: there is a mixture of current political figures, saints, and ancient thinkers. In the 1640s, some of those nodes remain prominent, but particularly in terms of betweenness centrality (see below) the order and distribution of those names change. Centralities of “King Henry” and “Queen Elizabeth” go up, for one thing, and contemporary non-royal figures begin to crop up in the top ten and twenty names. One possible explanation for this is that the Republican government has disrupted the normal flow of social capital. With the King and much of the nobility imprisoned or in exile, the network is deprived of its usual go-to names for reference. In response, authors on both sides of the political spectrum seem to harken back to a previous, more stable political era. This is again where the flexibility of using the names of recently deceased political figures comes in; their reputation can be marshalled for a variety of political arguments. Charles I is central in the 1630s to some degree, though one limitation of presenting the data in this way is that it is difficult to tell <em>how</em> he is being talked about in these dedications. But whether talked about positively or negatively, his influence still has an outsized effect on the networks of the 1640s.</p>
      <p>Things change more markedly after 1649. The execution of Charles I seems to have more finality in relation to his naming in dedications than the natural deaths of other monarchs. After his death Charles disappears from the list of most central names in the network, though Elizabeth and James still feature prominently. Pauline references, though in somewhat of a downslide during the war years, increase in frequency alongside topical biblical references like John the Baptist, whose beheading (along with Paul’s own martyrdom) could have been on the minds of authors and publishers reflecting on the death of the king. Crucially, the two Republican leaders Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell join the monarchs as top names in betweenness centrality: as one might expect, Fairfax in the 40s and Cromwell in the 50s. In the 1660s the network returns to some pre-Interregnum patterns, but clear differences emerge. Centralities for King James hit a high point, suggesting nostalgia for the originator of the Stuart line in England. The name “King Charles” of course also is prominent, though this time referring to Charles II and signifying the restoration of both the monarchy and more traditional dedicatory and patronage practices. Though the return of monarchs and recently deceased political figures suggests a return to pre-1640 network behavior, there is also evidence of shifts in social behavior as it manifests in dedicatory practice. For example, the formation of the Royal Society and its subsequent flurry of publishing activity elevates names like Kenelm Digby into the group of high betweenness centrality nodes. New intellectual communities that form in the Restoration world begin to make their mark on the print landscape alongside names that we would “expect” to see given the shape of pre-war networks.</p>
      <p>I have sketched out in these examples some suppositions that might be made based on the data available, but these should not be viewed as irrefutable arguments derived from objective datasources. Instead we should think of the network as representing the print world, and that representation as a form of argumentation. The choice to collect and display the information I have here collected as a network is an interpretive choice, one that lends itself to certain further interpretations and inferences. While it may be tempting to think of quantitative network analysis and other computational methods as neutral tools which derive from some properties that already exist within the data, a network is instead an interpretative structure that makes certain aspects of an object visible while obscuring others. I have already mentioned the ways in which networks often obscure the dimension of time, this is just one of the ways in which networks work against certain argumentative frames even while making new arguments possible.</p>
      <p>There are two parts to networks as representation—the mathematical representation of degree and other metrics, and the visual representation of the node-link diagram.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> So far I have spent most of the time talking about the mathematical representation: the ways in which the computational network structure allows us to make observations on the network’s density, on the relative importance of individual nodes, and more. Like the mathematical representation, the visual representation suggests certain arguments about how the world of print might or should look to researchers. In the first place I return to my previously-declared stubbornness about including every name in a dedication as part of the network. By visualizing the names of all mentions in printed dedications rather than just the names of dedicatees, I argue that these networks, both mathematical and visual, represent the network of print as an analog to the way the dedications themselves represent it. This network representation does a better job of reflecting the full scope of dedicatory relations than do other representations of the same social world. The ability to see all those names existing together in a single network, ranked by their importance to the books regardless of whether they had lived social connections to one another allows researchers to understand that print connections were not as reliant on lived social connections as one might think at first.</p>
      <p>As Chris Warren reminds us in his recent essay on the long history of network visualization, networks have long been a way of making visible that which was previously invisible. Early modern printers, stationers, and authors conceived of the social world of print as a conversation; that is why there are so many names in these dedications in the first place. By making this practice visible, I hope to have brought forward a way of thinking transhistorically about the existing connections in the early modern print record. I have supplemented the network view with other visualizations that elaborate on this same theme. A bar chart of texts by year gives a sense of the overall distribution of texts and always shows the researcher how many texts they are viewing at any one time. If the network looks sparse, it could be because there were fewer names mentioned in that timespan or simply fewer texts overall—the bar graph makes it clear which one of these possibilities is true at a glance. I have also added histograms—bar graphs that show distribution—to the right of the network that show the distribution of different types of centrality in the current network view. What a researcher will see most frequently on these graphs is a typical distribution of centrality in a network, with a few nodes of very high centrality, a great many with very low centrality, and barely any in between. This is typical in a social network—reputation accrues quickly to a few central figures, and attention is spread evenly among the rest. Seeing this visually alongside the network at every point reminds the viewer of the large number of nodes that are easy to overlook—the people mentioned in only a few texts who might constitute an important part of a particular neighborhood in the graph. One of the larger points of this project is to make those people more visible to researchers through the stubborn method of finding all names in every dedication. My hope is that this visual representation is a rhetorical and argumentative step in that direction, making the people, texts, and relations of imaginative print networks visible. Finally, I again call attention to the useful flattening of the network’s temporalities. By not separating living figures from dead ones in these graphs, it is easier to see the ways in which people of the past continue to exert great influence over social networks of the living. As William St. Clair reoriented our understanding of reception by showing that reading was centered not simply on current publication but around a library of books from the recent and the distant past; so these networks suggest that the imaginative worlds of early modern print, manifest in dedications, are constituted of figures from a long history and not just the patrons and politicians of the day.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
      <p>Throughout this dissertation I have reflected in several ways on what it might mean to represent different aspects of early modern sociality as networks. In doing so my intention has been to reveal the ways in which relationality contributes to authorship and how such relations inflect forms: literary works are shaped by the relations that constitute them. The representation of dedicatory relations as a network highlights the ways in which books are implicated in a large imaginative network that spans many historical periods, economic roles, and social classes. At stake in this representation is the casting off of the assumption that texts are the result either of a single individual’s vision or of unmappable, diffuse cultural forces. Even a cursory look at the networks available in print showcases a vast but delimited set of relations we can use to more clearly understand the connections that undergird early modern literary production.</p>
      <p>I want to conclude with a final word on the kinds of work that make such insights possible. Digital humanities work, especially computational analysis like the work done here, is collaborative by necessity. My work on the <em>Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</em> network in the previous chapter is the direct result of a team of scholars managing data and creating interfaces to that data.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> My work in the network project outlined above is the result of a long chain of collaborations and social relationships: the decades-long effort of the EEBO-TCP to create machine-readable texts, the development of natural language processing software attuned to early modern spellings at Nortwestern University, the collaborative working environment at the Folger Shakespeare Library’s Early Modern Digital Agendas seminar, and the code training, advice, and assistance I received from the Humanities Digital Workshop at Washington University in St. Louis and dSHARP at Carnegie Mellon University, to name a few. I acknowledge these contributions here rather than in an acknowledgments section because they constitute collaboration rather than influence or assistance. Like the working relationships I reconstruct in this dissertation, digital projects necessitate many stages of collaboration and shared endeavour. To understand how knowledge is produced and how work is done, and to make more such work possible in the future, scholars must be unafraid to recognize the ways in which achievements that appear individual are in fact the result of community efforts.</p>

Beyond the technical issue, allusions raise a number of other difficulties that direct address does not. Allusions may be intended for members of an in-group only while confounding outsiders. Even if all readers would have easily understood a particular reference at the time of publication, as time passes the allusion may become less recognizable. A seventeenth-century reader might have quickly known that the “Rhyming Judge of the Twelve-penny Gallery” was Rochester, but a modern reader will likely not understand without the help of a footnote. As time passes, we would need to consider how the effects of a particular allusion might fade, and what effect the receding referant might have on subsequent readings.
