Most Illustrious and right Excellent Lord,
I Have brought forth to breathe the common
aire this Eromena, at the commandment of a
Lady, who (pretending to have over mee
the soveraignety of an absolute Comman∣dresse)
straightly requires at my hands, a devoutly-obe∣dient,
strict, and sudden performance of her imperious
and not to be questioned commands. If she prove imper∣fect,
she is the more excusable for being no naturall birth,
but an abortive of a few moneths time, accidentally con∣ceived
without any hope ever to have breath'd. And now
I am constrained to dedicate her (thus unpolish't) unto
your Excellencie, before whom shee ought (indeed) to
have appeared as richly endowed with ornaments, as you
are with vertues. Vouchsafe (I beseech you) to accept, in
excuse of my boldnesse, the necessity of my obedience,
by receiving this Princesse into your courteous protection,
that you may behold in her the conformity she hath with
your Excellencie in nobility and valour, but (above all)
in an eternall constancie, whereby as shee grew to bee
peerlesse among all the Ladies of her time, so makes it
also your Excellencie become singular among all the Cava∣liers
of this our age. The Lord God grant your Excellencie
all increase of felicitie, whilst I, with reverend affection,
humbly kisse your hand.
