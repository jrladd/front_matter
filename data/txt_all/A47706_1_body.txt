My Lord,
THat Oblati∣on,The Au∣thor's Se∣cond Epi∣stle Dedi∣catory, in the second Edition, published by Him∣self, at Ve∣nice.
which was
once present∣ed
at one Al∣tar,
could not
by any, but a sacrilegious
hand, be brought to any

other: and therefore This Piece,
which came formerly forth at Paris,
under the Patronage of your Lord∣ships
Name, ought not to seek any
Other, for this Second Edition, at
Venice. Fame, the Trumpeter of
Truth, was, at that time, the Guide,
that led me to direct my Pen, and my
Affections, toward your Lordship, so
soon as I had received the report of
your Lordships being design'd for the
Charge of the Royall Interest: so
that, having now the Happinesse of
paying my Personal Devotions, and
Services to your Lordship, I ought
not, by any means, to change my pur∣pose.
And seeing your Lordship
was pleased Favourably to receive
your Servant, when he had no Oppor∣tunity
of making his Desires to serve

your Lordship known, but by Writing
onely: I cannot but hope, that your
Lordship, having now read in my
Countenance also, my Hearty Af∣fections,
and Devotion to your Ser∣vice,
will confirm me in your Lord∣ships
favour, and give me the Liber∣ty
of ever Professing myself
