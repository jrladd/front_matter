MOst Sacred Majestie, having be∣fore made some exposition upon the Proverbs of King Solomon, I have now done the same upon his Preaching. For seeing so great a King was pleased to be a Prea∣cher, I have brought the homage of a Preacher to him. My former labours received the honour of Patronage from your Royall Brother, my dread Soveraigne, to whom the God of mercy and glo∣ry be a gratious Patron, and a safe defender: these labours most humbly beseech the same from your Sacred Majestie. For seeing, when I was your ordinary Chaplaine, I had long and often in ex∣pounding other parts of Scripture, the gracious attention of your hearing, I desire that the world may read these with the favourable light of your Patronage. It is but a beame of that illustrious and
 splendent light shining in you which I crave, and which though clouded with many trials, yet breaks out gloriously in heavenly patience, spiri∣tuall cheerfulnesse, divine courage, noble courte∣sie. To put these, and many other graces in one, God hath made you, the onely Daughter of a fa∣mous King deceased, the only Sister of a glorious King alive, that all might looke upon you to his greater glory. And he that hath made you the mir∣ror of his praise for others to looke upon, vouch∣safe himselfe to looke upon you as the object of his graciousnesse. He that is the only wise God be your pretious comforter: he that is the only Sonne of God be your mercifull Saviour, and make you glorious in the happinesse of heaven, who hath made you so glorious in the troubles of the earth.
