My LORD,
I am sensible that the Present I
make you, is neither for Bulk nor
Worth suitable to your Person and
Greatness; yet I hope you will fa∣vourably
accept it, being the best I
have to offer; and my Boldness may
pretend some Excuse from ancient Ac∣quaintance,
and from my Forwardness
to embrace this Opportunity of pro∣fessing
my Name among those that
Honour you, and of publishing my
self,
My LORD,
