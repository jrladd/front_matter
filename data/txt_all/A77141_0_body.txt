Gentlemen,
WEre I accountable to any how I pass my time here; 't were certainly to you, who know that I was not one of the idlest at home, wherefore partly to satisfy you, the following Manual I took the pains to translate out of French, the contents of which, as they are univer∣sally necessary, are design'd for all, but dedicated to your selves, as persons so much more in need of it, as you are pub∣lique Persons, and called to shew your abilities or defects more than your Neighbours; And if any member of our Body politic, thinks himself scandalized, and that he's too wise to take the Coun∣sels
 of Solomon in good part, he is one that least deserves them, I wish to all the same satisfaction in the perusal, as I had which encouraged me to translate it, and should be glad of any opportunity agreeable to the following Maxims, to tell you that I am,

Amsterdam, Febr. 14. 1683. S. N.
