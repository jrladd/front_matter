MY LORD,
SInce 'tis become modish to make De∣dications of Books to Persons of Ho∣nour and high Quality, amongst whom your Lordship is worthily ran∣ked one of the greatest in Eminency, I humbly make bold to Present this to your Patronage, be∣ing the Fruit of some spare Hours of Recreation, spent barely in the Translation out of the Original from which I have not Deviated; I hope to obtain your Lordships acceptance, which I shall look on as a Signal Addition to your obliging Fa∣vours to my self, and several of my Worthy Friends both at home and abroad: My Design being chiefly to testifie my Gratitude to your Honour, until I am capable to make some more effectual Demonstration of Real Services, who am,
Right Honourable,

London, the 12th. of November, 1684.
