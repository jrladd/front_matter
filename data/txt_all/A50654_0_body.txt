Sirs,
HAving many times considered of the large Extent of the Con∣stables Office, and how little skill or knowledge many of you have, who are often called to take upon you the same Office, and also how few Au∣thors there be who have writ on this Subject, Mr. Lambert, Mr. Win∣gate, and Mr. Shephard being the Chief, whose Rules at this day are very unsafe for the Constables to square their Actions by: for Mr. Lambert's Book, being a Discourse principally of the Common Law Cases, is now much al∣tered by Statute since, and that Book of the Office of a Constable Fathered up∣on Mr. Wingate, I am verily per∣swaded was none of his work; for

there are some unwarrantable Autho∣rities and gross Errors in it, which could not have slipped his ingenious Pen if the Work had been his; and for Mr. Shephard's Book, it is stuft full of Acts and Ordinances of that Con∣vention at Westminster, (which in the late times of Ʋsurpation and Rebel∣lion was owned for a Parliament,) which Ordinances are now of no force; Therefore none of these being safe or warrantable Rules for the Constables to walk by, but blind Guides to lead them into the by-paths and crooked Meanders of many Errors; I thought thereupon that some little Treatise of this Subject might not only prove very useful, but also very beneficial for the generality of People of this Kingdom; which consideration hath occasioned me to publish this small un∣polished Epitome; and though I know the Book will fall under many hard Censures of those who are far better able to undertake the work; yet I

hope, Dear Friends, my willingness to contribute any thing to your Service, though but a Mite, doth claim your favourable Acceptance of my pains; Remembring the old saying—est vo∣luisse satis, and there is nothing of so little regard but hath something of worth in it, and I despair not of some profit hence to you for whom it is in∣tended, and for whose ease, satisfa∣ction and direction it was collected and published by him, kind Friends, whose ambition and desire is, and shall be
Redd-Hall, Feb. 25. 1667/8.
