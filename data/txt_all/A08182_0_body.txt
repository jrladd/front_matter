THis Cuckowes poem let me thus excuse
To you (deare friend, the Patron of my verse)
Though some blind night-born Momus it abuse,
As but a iest vnworthy to reherse:
Yet who such iests, as this shall idly blame,
Shall for their meede merit a Cuckowes name.


I speake not this; but that in future time,
When as my wit with riper fruit shall grow,
My Muse may speake to thee in sweeter ryme,
And for thy worth some grauer poem show:
Meane time accept of what I heere do bring,
Though Cuckow-like my Muse doth harshly sing.
