COme, Pamphlet, take thy VVings, flee from my hand,
Arrive in England, in the County of Cumberland,
There stands a House, and that a worthy one,
By Kersup-foot in the Eye of the Sun;
A stately Building, all of plain hew'n Stone,
All built within this year or twain,
All Cumberland except Castle and Abbay,
Such another House in prospect you'll not see;
Unto that English Squire I do dedicat,
Honest Iohn Robertson, he was born in the Flat,

His Father was an English man,
Francis Robson kept good order,
There was no English compar'd with him,
Seven Mile within the Border,
Iustice Forrester an English Squire,
And Iohn Robson a Scot,
Yet it is scarce a Mile betwixt,
VVhere they were born and got,
It's true Iohn Robson is
A Comrade good enough,
And for House-keeping he excels,
He dwels in Cauterscleugh,
VVhite-Bread and Salt-Beef,
Good Mutton and old Cheese,
As I was riding by,
He did my Hunger ease,
He feasted me in May as I had been an Earl,
VVith Capon and good Lamb, Brandie and good Ale,
And for his Father Francis,
I knew him well enough,
To be a Gentleman, Store-master
To VValter Earl of Buckcleugh:
I wish that Iasons Fleece
VVith him may still appear,
And that his Flock would change,
Their Coats twelve timos a year.
