RIght honourable, and my gracious good Lord, your apparant true love to his Ma∣iestie, with your assured hate to all his enemies hath made me out of my hum∣ble hearts love and service, to his Maiestie and your Grace, to write these few invective lines a∣gainst the most hatefull, and horrible nature of Treason, and Traitors: I name no person offen∣dant, and wish there were no such offence. But ho∣ping that God will weede out the wicked, and blesse his Maiesty with a world of loving Subiects & encrease his love with many such good friends' as your selfe, in prayer for his Maiesties, and your long life, with health, and all hearts happinesse, I humbly rest
