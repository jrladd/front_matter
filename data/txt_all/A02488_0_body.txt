WHat hath heeretofore been
presented to your High∣nesse
eare, I heere make
bolde (with some little
change) to present afresh
to your eye: that you may beholde
at one view the entire body of those
discourses which were delivered dis∣iointly
and by peece-meale; as al∣so
that you may revise that at lea∣sure
(if ought therein shall be thought
worth revising) which was sometimes

of necessiy shuffled up in haste, though
I must confesse to mine owne comfort
and your honor, never heard but with
singular attention; and lastly, that I
may serve your Highness in somwhat,
as well absent as present▪ specially now
that your frequent presence with his
Majesty enforceth your often absence
from your Familie.
I adventure then, most noble Prince,
to unfolde and lay before your view
the Vow of DAVID (as seasonable I
hope to the times, as suitable to the
person) for the reformation and go∣vernment
of himselfe, his housholde
and State; whether made before his
comming to the Crowne, or newly
upon it, it is not certaine to define, nor
very materiall to know: once wee are
sure, it was DAVIDS Vow: which one
Motive me thinks were of weight suffi∣cient
to stirre-up all Christian Princes
(specially such as professe the defence of
the Christian faith) to a serious medita∣tion
thereon, even in that it was DA∣VIDS
Vow; who so lived and so died,

as never Prince (I thinke, before him
nor perhaps since him) so joyned to∣gether
Valour and Vertue, Courage
and Humility, Policy and Piety, Thrift
and Bounty, Solemnity and Devotion,
Greatness and Goodness.
Without flattering the present times,
I might safely and justly say unto you,
Et Pater Aeneas, & avunulus excitet
Hector.
The former of which (as the world
well knoweth) hath added to his pra∣ctice
singular precepts of this kinde;
by which hee as much surpasseth other
Kings, as Kings doe ordinary men, or
men the brute creatures. Yet I thought
it not amisse to adde therunto the pra∣ctice
and precepts of that King who
received such a testimony from the
mouth of God as never did any; and
farre surpassed that, in reall acts, which
Xenophon of Cyrus conceived onely in
imagination.
This King then if you please to pro∣pose
to your selfe as a paterne, and his

Vow as a rule, we may by Gods helpe
one day promise to our selves another
Charlemaine, or rather the perfections
of all the Edwards & Henries, & Iameses
your renowned progenitors united in
one Charles: and, your proceeding
and ending answering your gracious
beginnings and vertuous disposition
(which wee all hope and pray for) wee
may rest assured thereof.
For the effecting of which, you can∣not
doe better than performe in deed
what you have chosen for your word,
Si vis omnia subijcere, teipsum subijce rati∣oni;
which is truely to be a King. For,
in so doing you will valew Sove∣raignetie,
not by impunity of doing e∣vill,
but power of doing good; and in
attayning it▪ onely be enabled for the
doing of that good which before you
desired.
And if this poore Worke of mine,
or any my endeavours, either have
or shall any way conduce to the fur∣therance
of that publike and impor∣tant

worke, I shall therein reape a suf∣ficient
reward both of my service and
travailes; accounting it my greatest
happinesse on earth to have been coun∣ted
worthy to be
