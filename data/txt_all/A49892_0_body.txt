SIR,
THe Honourable Post, which you so worthily fill, gives a natu∣ral Title to your Protection to this Piece, which is the History of the first Rise, and earliest advances of that Faculty, which You so nobly de∣fend in its declining Age. I call tt the declining Age of Physick, not from any decay that I observe in its Intellects, which perhaps are more vigorous and lively now than ever, but from a formidable Conjunction, which seems at this time to threaten the Overthrow of its Constitution,
especially here in England. The Sub∣version of the Colledge of Physicians, the noblest Branch that ever Physick bore, has been attempted not only by the open Assaults of its Profess'd Enemies, but likewise by the secret Machinations of some of its treache∣rous corrupt Members, whose unge∣nerous Designs have been mainly de∣feated by your Prudence, and un∣shaken Resolution.
Quacks have been coaevous to Phy∣sick itself; we meet with no Memoirs of a date early enough to shew us an Age unmolested with that rascally sort of Vermin. But to prostitute a liberal Education to the basest of Submissions, and to stoop an honou∣rable Profession to disingenuous pra∣ctices, only to gain the favour and recommendation of a Pack of illi∣terate Mechanicks, is an honour re∣serv'd for our Age and Country, where Interest tyrannizes, and men are too impatient to wait the slow advances of Honesty or Merit, to be rich or great.
It may seem strange to those that have not pierc'd to the bottom of this Mystery, that men shou'd endea∣vour to subvert the Honour, and
trample upon the Dignity of that Faculty, by the exercise of which they themselves aim to rise. But there is no Riddle in the matter; They have found out a shorter cut to Reputation than by Learning and Skill, which require Industry and Application; they steer their course altogether by Craft and Intrigue. They are refining upon the Policy of the Mountebanks; For they plainly see the Figure which the Doctor makes with the People is owing to the in∣terest of the Fool, that recommends him. For this reason they endeavour to destroy a Society, whose Laws and Constitutions are a severe curb to all such mean indirect Practices, and which allow its Members no other methods of making their court to the world, than those of Justice and Charity; which latter these men have as much as in 'em lay endea∣vour'd to obstruct. Of this the Of∣fice now erected at the Colledge for the relief of the Poor is a sufficient Evidence; and in spight of the Ma∣lice of its Enemies, or the Iniquity of the Times, will, I hope, prove a last∣ing Monument to your Honour, and
procure you the hearty respect, and thanks of all good men, as it does of,
SIR,
