Deare Hearts,
THis is the first time I have appeared a fool in print, (al∣though very often other wayes) ye suffer fools gladly. I might have been thought otherwise, had I held my tongue; For silence is more safe then speech, when enemies be auditors. I shall not go about by rhetoricall phrases to beg thy good opinion of the ensuing Dialogue: For if I were able to do it, I would not; for the more Writings are so dressed, the lesse they sauour of true meaning.

Sycophant, or Crocodilian, or Cameleon Pharisee (that is a fault-finder, who sees not the beam in his own eye) shall cast dirt in my face by reason of my affliction the Almighty hath suffered me to undergo in the world, let all such know (that although I must confesse I have much gone astray from truth) yet I am able to cast off any dirt that envy hath or may cast on me, and to ap∣peare, if I would, with as large a menstruous garment (of my own righteousnesse) as some others, although I had rather glory in my infirmities and sufferings for God, — in whom I have peace (though in the world I may have trouble) and rest,
