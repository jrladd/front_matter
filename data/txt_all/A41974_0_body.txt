Reverend Sir,
WHere I owe a true Deference and Respect I would willingly declare it, for I less dread the censure of Osten∣tation than Ingratitude. I am sensible that the Age wherein we live is quick and critical, sharp and censorious, in her descant of those that appear in Print: However, I will ra∣ther hazard the imputation of a dull melan∣choly Man, than of an unthankful; he that doth but tacitly confess the Kindnesses of a Friend, in a manner interrs them; when he
that publisheth them hath in part requited, tho not fully compensated.
To whom should I commend the Patronage of this Discourse, better than to him who is a Favourite and Lover of Truth, and of such as favour and love the Truth? Besides I have tasted of your Kindness towards me, which I ever esteemed as a Debt lying upon me, and am therefore desirous so far to discharge it, as to leave some small Me∣moir to others of a kind Resentment.
My earnest Prayer to God, even the Fa∣ther of all Mercies, is, and ever shall be, to protract your Days, and to preserve You unto his heavenly Kingdom, which is the sincere Desire, and unfeigned Vote of,
Worthy Sir,
