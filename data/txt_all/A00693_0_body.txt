Excellent Prince:
THat which was wont to accompany all Sacrifices, is now become a Sacrifice, MVSIQVE: And to a Compositiâˆ£on so full of Harmony as yours, what could bee a fitter Offring? The rather, since they are the Offerers first fruits, and that he giues them with pure hands. J could, now, with that solemne industry of many in Epistles, enforce all that hath beene said in praise of the Faculty, and make that commend the worke, but J desire more, the worke should commend the Faculty: And therefore suffer these few Ayres to owe their Grace rather to your Highnesse iudgement, then any others testimonie. J am not made of much speach. Onely J know them worthy of my Name: And, therein, J tooke paynes to make them worthy of Yours.
