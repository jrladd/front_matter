GENTLEMEN,
YOƲ desir'd me first to Preach, and then to Print this Sermon: I have Obey'd You in Both; as being willing to do whatever lay in my Power to keep up a

due Esteem of Church-Musick, in an Age that seems hastning on apace to a neglect, if not a disuse of it. If this Discourse may contribute any ways towards so good an end, and withal serve to express the Re∣spect I have for You, I have the double aim I propos'd to my self in Preaching and Publishing it.
For I am a true Lover of Musick, espe∣cially when it is imploy'd to so excellent a purpose, as that of composing our Attention, and raising our Affections in Divine Wor∣ship, and a true Honourer of all those who favour and encourage it. After which, I need not tell either You or the World how much I am,
Gentlemen,
