RIght honorable & noble Lords
presuming on the accustomed
myldnes and affabelitie for the
which your L. L. haue not beene
a litle famous, It hath imbold∣ned
me to lay the barren feild
of my Vnfructfull braine be∣fore
the powerfull Sune, of
your Perfections, whoes beams
may Illuminat the dark shed∣dowes,
Dispers the gros Vapores, and rype the enrypened
Ears, that so you may receaue the increas of this my second
Harvest, nether deserveth such a rare & excellent Fruer.
anie les then such a fair and confortable Summer, being
the glorious actiones of that Illustrus and generus Bruce,
which haueing bred in so sweet and ferteill a Soyll, hath
made me ambitiouslie greeddie therwith to inrich my bar∣rén
fielde, hoping that my insuffitiencie (if once supported
by the vnremouable pillers of your Vertues) shall be able to
resiste the stormie Tempests of wind-blasting Sicophants,
and beat bak the swerms of Poisone, sucking Wasps, so
that the Seed preserued by your means onlie, shall yeeld all
aeges the tymlie Harvest of your L. L. Eternall glorie, I
being bound by such admirable worth & vndeserued cour∣tessie
for euer to Rest.
