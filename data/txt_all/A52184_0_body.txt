Madam,
HAving lately presented un∣to the view of the World, my Liturgical-Discour∣ses,
in which I at large unfold the many glorious Mysteries of the Sacred Masse, and of the only great Sacrifice of Christians, which is therein daily offered up to God, through all Na∣tions of our Catholick Communion; under the Illustrious Name of the Baron of VVarder, Your Most Noble and Most Excellent Con∣sort, as under a secure
Shield to defend it a¦gainst the over severe Tongues of this Censo∣rious Age, and as a Charm of most exemplar Piety, to all Zealous, to this the greatest Act of Religious Worship and Perfection; I now esteem it my special Duty and Obligation, to Conse∣crate this small abstract of those larger Vo∣lumns, to the Patronage and Protection, of your
Most Honourable Per∣son, and Most Heroick Christian Vertues.
For besides, that it were a high Crime, to separate these smaller Streams from the Foun∣tain-head, whereto your Honour already claims so just a Title; Your many Signal favours have been so conspicuous towards me, that I ought, at the least, thus, to let the World know
the height of Your Merits; though I may not presume to attempt the repaying the least of Your Incomparable Ci∣vilities, by the greatest of my Wishes or Endea∣vours. My ambition is, by these choice Ears, glean'd forth the Rich Fields of the highest and most Sacred of all our Christian Myste∣ries, to make a small Of∣fering at the shrine of
Your Most Illustrious Vertues, and withall, still to profess my self Your Honours insoluble Debtor.
Truly, the Subject of this Abridgment, as it Merits the highest val∣lue and veneration from every true Professor of Christian Perfection; so it has ever been most suitable to, and attra∣ctive of Your Religi∣ous Piety. It is the
stupendious abstract of the Birth, Life and Pas∣sion of our most glorious Redeemer. It is the great propitiatory Sacri∣fice, once offered in blood by the Son of God on the Altar of the Cross, and still Mystically slain on our Sacred Altars, for the attonement of Heaven, and the recon∣cilement and eternal Ʋ∣nion of Men and An∣gels, to their offended
Creatour. And as it is the most Sober and Solemn Test of our Catholick-Ʋnity, Worship & Per∣fection: So it is the most efficacious encourager of Devotion, God could bequeath to man, where∣by to assure him of his present Mercies and fu∣ture Happiness.
Madam, It is by the power of this Sublime Act of Christian Wor∣ship, that Your Catho∣lick
Soul, amidst the worst of times, and not∣withstanding the horri∣dest Scandals and Blas∣phemies, carnal wisdom could vomit against the most Sacred of our Chri∣stian Duties, has been kept stedfast in the Pro∣fession of Christianity, which even from the Laver of Your Holy Baptism has grown up with You, and has most fruitfully Branched
forth into many goodly Off-springs, the living and choice Images of your Noble and Christi∣an Zeal; and which will render your Memory Sacred and Immortal. For if the malice of Sa∣tan shall not be able to undermine or shake the Rock of our Christian Doctrine, nor the Blas∣phemies of the greatest Criminals, Cancel or Frustrate the Decrees of
the eternal Providence over Believers; Nei∣ther shall it ever make void the Veneration and Piety of Christians, to∣wards the Sacred Masse, and the unbloody victim therein daily Sacrificed for their Reconcilement and Comfort, and for their encouragement, a∣midst the bitterest Perse∣cutions, Sensuality, and Satan can raise up a∣gainst them. So that by
these my weak labours, in the discovery of this ineffable Mystery, I may justly hope that I have in some measure fitted an Offering, at least for the Subjects sake, worth your Acceptance; and which will, for its own sake, merit a proportiona∣ble welcome, from the heart, and most affectio∣nate wishes of
Madam,
