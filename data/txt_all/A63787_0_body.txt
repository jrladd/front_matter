MY LORD,
SInce that by the hand of divine providence and the favour of our most gracious Sovereign deser∣vedly confer'd upon You, You are arriv'd to the highest Sphere in
 the high and honourable Court of Chancery, that Officina Justitiae in which all Original Writs whatso∣ever are fram'd, and out of which they issue forth, and are returnable in all the Courts of Common Law, whereby Process thereupon are made (amongst others) in this His Ma∣jesty's Court of King's-Bench, I could not imagine with my self where to find a more fit, just and honourable Patron than Your Lord∣ship, under the umbrage of whose Protection my weak Endeavours might be admitted shelter, being very sensible what hazard I run in this most critical and sensorious Age without the affluence of Your Lordship's favour, which I do hum∣bly beg; imploring your pardon if I have offended by this my too great presumption, in regard I have not been so happy as to be so well known to Your Lordship as in
 the least to expect it. It is a sub∣ject that I do not find hath been ever treated of (as to the Court of King's-Bench) by any Pen whatsoever, and the path-way to it therefore being very rough, hard and uneasie, can never be made plain either to my self or others except it meet with Your Lord∣ship's good opinion, wherever you find the matter in it, to be cen∣tred between Truth and Justice; for both which I am most fully as∣sured You are and will be a devo∣ted Advocate.
My Lord,
