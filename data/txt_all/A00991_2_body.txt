Braue Earle, bright Pearle of Peeres, peerelesse Nobilitie,
The height of armes and artes in one aspiring,
Æ²alor with grace, with valor grace attiring,
Who more to amplifie vertues habilitie,
To adde to fore-learn'd facultie facilitie
Now liu'st in trauell, forraine rytes inquiring,
Honors ingendred sparkles thereto firing,
Immutable in trauels mutabilitie.
Though there your Honor see what here we heare,
And heare what here we learne at second hand;
Yet with good grace accept what was inuented
For your more-ease, by yours-deuoted here,
So may you more conceiue, more vnderstand,
Returne more complete, trauell more contented.
