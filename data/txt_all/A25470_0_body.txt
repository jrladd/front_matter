My Dear Friends,
THese Sermons, both preach'd, and printed are the meer product of love to your Souls. I never yet (that I remember) went thorow the Parish with∣out some (though not sutably compassionate) heart-akeing yearnings towards my charge, to think (and oh that I could think of it according to the worth of Souls) how many thousands here are posting to Eternity, that within a few years will be in Heaven or Hell, and I know not how, so much as to aske them whither they are going. While God continues me your Watchman, I shall affectionately desire, and solli∣citously endeavour to keep my self pure from the blood of all men,Acts 20.26. and that not onely for the saving of my own Soul, by delivering my Mes∣sage; but that you also may be saved by entertaining it. I am willing therefore to commend unto you some legible provocations to serious Pi∣ety, and therefore have procured a contribution of help, that in the mul∣titude of Spirituall Counsellors your souls may have safety. In short,Prov. 11.14. my Brethren, give me leave to say, that if I had but the Apostles Graces to help me in the manner, I can (without boasting) at present use
 the matter of his Spiritually-passionate expressions; That I greatly long after you all,Phil. 1.8, 9, 10, 11. in the bowells of Jesus Christ. And this I pray, that your love to truth and holiness, may abound yet more, and more, in saving knowledge, and in all sound judgement. That you may practically ap∣prove things that are excellent; and that you may be sincerely gracious, and universally without offence till the day of Christ. That you may be filled with the fruits of righteousnesse, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God. These (my Beloved) are and shall be (through Grace) the constant desires and restless endeavours of
Novemb. 14. 1661.
