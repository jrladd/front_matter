IF Homers Verse in Greek did merit praise,
If Nason in the Latin tongue wan Bayes,
If Maro 'mongst the Romans did excel,
If Tasso in the Tuscian tongue spoke well:
Sweet Sir, pardon him that's so much unperfect,
In Scots can scarely read, and never yet could write;
If my poor shallow brain could but advance your Name,
Ye should be mounted high upon the wings of Fame;
And if that my poor thoughts had strength to enterprize,
I would advance your Name as far as Titans rise,
And that Shepherd Swain that I do simulize,
Is Robert Elliot that dwells in the Dewslies:
Be not offended at the name of Shepherd Swain,
For formerly that name was Noble-men;
And as Iason setcht his Golden Fleece from Greece,
I wish that Robert Elliot his Fleeces may increase.
