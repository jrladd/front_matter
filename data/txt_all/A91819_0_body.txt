Elect Lady,
THe Searcher of all hearts knowes, with what fear I publish these mean thoughts of mine, to the publique Cen∣sure of this Super-fine Age But now, or never, is the time, to croud amongst them at the Press, with hope to pass Invisible. My comfort is, that I begin in Humility, if I can digg lowe enough, my foundation will hold. For, truly, so far as I know the deceitfulness of mine own heart, I am confident, no man doth, or can think meaner of this Sermon, then I my self do. And, I had rather the world should say,
that its a plain, honest, good, pious Sermon; then that its an elaborate, polite, choyce piece. I write it not for Schollars, they need no such mean helps, but for pur-blind Christians, who feel their way before them, with a staff; If they use it, and find direction, I have mine end. Had I sought my self, I could have put it in better cloathes. That I dedicate it unto your Ladiship, (though Motives of civill Conusance are not wanting) yet that of Re∣ligion prevailed with me; knowing by some years Observation, that you are one of those, who desire to Walk humbly with God. In which blessed way, I beseech God keep you, guide you with his counsel here, and after that, receive you unto Glory: So prayeth


Oh, quam me nimium probasque, amasque
Quae vis Archetypas habere Nugas!
Mart.
