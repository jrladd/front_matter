MADAM,
The unfortunate CLELIA having since ber arrival in this Nation, sought a patronage from many noble hands, doth at length address her self to yours. As if those various adventures, which travers'd her illustrious life could not terminate in a compleat happiness before she were acknowledging to you for it, and that her vertue had not been sufficiently try'd to merit that felicity which was preparing for her be∣fore it had receiv'd a testimony from you, who are the perfect Patern of it. That she is worthy your protection I cannot doubt, at least if those excellent beauties of hers which are almost matchless in the original, come not sullied from my unskilful hands. And since it is reported it was not the illustrious Scudery, but that celebrated Vertuosa his Sister who finish'd the Romance after his decease, I could not make a more apt Dedication than the work of a Lady to the most Noble and accomplish'd Person of her own Sex. That which may cause you to make some difficulty in the reception of CLELIA, is the person of him that shall assume the boldness to present her to you. Yet it cannot seem strange an unknown person should thus presume, since an heroick ver∣tue, such as yours, commands the addresses and devoyrs of all that honour it; the sence of which I cannot better manifest in my self, than by my humble desires to be admitted together with CLELIA in the quali∣ty of
MADAM,
