BRrethren, as heretofore I furnished you with a short Catechisme: so now for your further pro∣fiting in the means of your saluation, I haue reuiew∣ed the same, and added to it a briefe ex∣position of the ten Commandements, & of the Articles of the Faith, and the Lords Prayer: hoping that as my care is to do you good, so you will endeuour to pro∣fite by my labours: that as in mine old age, my desire is to bring forth more fruits, as one plāted in the house of God:Psal 92.13 14. so I may see you to walke worthy of the Lord, and please him in all things, be∣ing
 fruitfull in all good works,Colos. 1.10 and en∣creasing in the knowledge of God. And that when I shall examine you before you come to the Lords Table, I may not find you so ignorant, as formerly I found you, & your families: but that I may see the care you haue had to shew your selues worthy of that fauour which God hath extended to you, by the preaching of the Gospell hitherto:Heb. 13.17 that so I watching ouer your soules, as one that must giue accounts vnto God, may doe it with ioy, and not with griefe. And albeit that ho∣nourable Lady, the Lady Anne Bacon be since departed this life, hauing finished her course,2. Tim 4 7. and fought that good fight, & kept the faith, and now resteth with Christ; yet you may acknowledge her Christian care to doe you good, hath taken effect in some measure amongst you, in placing mee ouer you, as your Pastor, by whose painefull labours you enioy that which many want. And that when I am gone hence to the Lord, as I attend dayly the time of my dissolution: that worthy and right Noble Gentleman Sir Frances Bacon her sonne may shew the like care, in placing ouer you a lear∣ned,
 godly, and painefull Pastor, that may build you vp further till you grow to an holy Temple in the Lord. To whom with my continuall prayers for you, to keepe you vnspotted of this wicked world, I commit you all, Redburn this 20. of March, 1611.
