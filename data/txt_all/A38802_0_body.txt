SIR,
THAT I take the
Boldness to In∣scribe
Your Ma∣jesties
Name on the Front
of this little History,
is to pay a Tribute, the
most due, and the most be∣coming
my Relation to
your Majesties Service of
any that I could devise;
since Your Majesty has
been pleas'd among so

many Noble and Illustrious
Persons, to name me of the
Councel of Your Com∣merce,
and Plantations:
And if it may afford Your
Majesty some diversion, to
behold, as in a Table, the
Course, and Importance of
what Your Majesty is the
most Absolute Arbiter of a∣ny
Potentate on Earth, and
Excite in Your Loyal Sub∣jects
a Courage, and an In∣dustry
becoming the Advan∣tages
which God and Na∣ture
have put into their
Hands, I shall have reach'd
my humble Ambition, and
Your Majesty will not Re∣prove

these Expressions of
it in
SIR,
