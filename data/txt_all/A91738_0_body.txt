SIR,
HAving been prevailed with by the earnest desires of those who were nearly related unto that worthy Gentleman, at whose Funeral this Sermon was preached, to let it, (af∣ter it had been it self so long buried) something unseasonably revive and go abroad into the world; I have taken the boldness to prefix so honorable a name as yours before it, upon a double account; one re∣lating unto the deceased Gentleman, the other unto my self. For the former, if we may take the cha∣racter of a wise and worthy man by the affection which he beareth, and choyce which he maketh of e∣minent Examples, whose prudence and piety to fol∣lw, I may truly, and therefore without flattery to you or him pronounce this dear Friend now with God, a very wise, and a very good man, having been frequently an ear-witness of the singular Ho∣nor he did bear to your person (in mentioning of
whose zeal and care to promote the glory of God, the truth of the Gospel, the interest of Religion, and good of your Country, he did greatly delight to expatiate) and whom he did propose to himself as a special pattern for his imitation. For mine own part, as I have the same reasons which moved him, to bear an honorable and high esteem towards your person, and the gifts and graces of God bestow∣ed upon you; so you have by your abundant favours to me, and particularly your earnest and sollici∣tous endeavors to have preserved my Station in the University, when changes in the State caused changes there, laid so great a debt upon me, as I have no way to discharge, but onely by putting you over to the best Pay-master, and in my prayers commending you unto him, who doth not forget your labour of love. To his gracious Protection I commend you, and all the branches and interests of your Family, and remain,
