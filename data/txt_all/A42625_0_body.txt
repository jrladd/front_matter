SIR,
I Have here sent you, as in a Letter, the whole body of the Geometry of Landskips and Paintings; and such as it is, I freely ten∣der it to your perusal: this I must say for it, That it is not, as is too usual in Mathematical Treatises, obscur'd with the Formalities of Pe∣dantry, and rather a Knot of Ʋseless Problems, than a Solid Instruction, for I have made it my particular purpose, to make it pertinent, hearty, and brief; I have aim'd at the Marrow of my Subject, and not at little trifling Ornaments: I shall say no more, but if you can bear with the Roughness of the Stile, incident to Demonstra∣tion, I do not doubt but I shall give you all the Satisfaction my Subject requires; and so I dis∣miss you.
