SIR,
THe Giant Goliah
so affrighted the
whole host of Is∣rael,
by the vast
bulk of his body, the weight
and large dimensions of his
spear and armor, with his de∣fying
and bragging words,
that none of all that Army
durst encounter him. On∣ly

David a Shepherd by
profession, in stature low,
in years young, the least of
all his brethren, and of
meanest account among the
people, took the boldness to
enter the lists with that un∣circumcised
Philistim. So
I a spiritual shepherd by
profession, the least of the
Tribe of Levi, little in
my own eyes, and of small
account in the world, obser∣ving
how all the host of lear∣ned
men in this Land look
upon, but adventure not to

buckle with Mr. Hobbs
his Leviathan, Nec quis∣quam
ex agmine tanto au∣det
adire viurm, manibus∣ve
inducere caestus. I say,
being animated by some lo∣vers
of the truth, have this
Summer set aside for a
while my other studies, to
peruse this book, and to de∣tect
some of his chief Te∣nets,
which though erro∣neous
and dangerous, are
swallowed down by some
young Sciolists without nau∣seating;
which to me is an

argument of great distem∣per
in the mindes and affe∣ctions
of men, who with the
Israelites loathing the
Manna of true Phylosophy
and Divinity, covet after
the Quailes of new errors, or
rather old in a new guise,
which in the end will poyson
them. Me thinks I see Re∣ligion
and learning, Divini∣ty
and true Phylosophy, de∣votion
and piety, for which
this Islaud hath been glori∣ous
for many generations,
saying as the voice that the

Christians heard in Jerusa∣lem
immediately before the
destruction thereof, Migre∣mus
hinc. These are the
Palladia, and as it were the
Tutelar gods, by which this
British Empire hath so
long stood, which if they
forsake us, what are we else
but a prey to our enemies:
God grant we may not com∣plain
of their departure,
as Aenaeas did of his Tro∣jan
gods, Excessere om∣nes
aditis, arisque relictis
Dii quibus imperium hoc

steterat. For do we not see
how Athism strives to justle
out Religion, how igno∣rance
is crawling up into the
chair of learning; how pie∣ty
is affronted by profane∣ness;
and devotion by irre∣verance;
how divinity is
assaulted by heretical opini∣ons;
and solid Phylosophy
by dreams and fanatical
whimsies. I doubt not but
I shall be blamed by some for
encountring this Champion
of Malmsbury, as David
was for venturing upon that

Champion of Gath; but I
will answer them in David's
words. 1 Sam.17. 29. What
have I now done, is there
not a cause? Goliah defied
the whole host of Israel, and
Mr. Hobbs defyeth the
whole host of learned men;
esteeming his Leviathan as
formidable and unconque∣rable,
as that in Job 41. 16.
of whose Majesty the
mighty are afraid, and for
fear they faint in them∣selves;
but this Leviathan
is not so; For a Hook may

be cast into his nose, and
his jawes may be pierced
with an angle, Job 40. 21.
Sir, this piece (which makes
its addresses to you, as to
one truly judicious, pious,
and a lover of solid lear∣ning)
is but small; so was
David, who notwithstan∣ding
foiled Goliah; the Ich∣neumon
is but a small rat,
yet it can kill the great Cro∣codile;
in est sua gratia
parvis, small things have
their magnitude, though not
of bulk, yet of vertue;

there is more nourishment in
a small lark, then in a great
kite or raven; and so there
is more lustre in a small Di∣amond
then a whole quarry
of other stones; as in a lit∣tle
Bee, so in this little
Book there may be much
spirit; ingentes animos
angusto in corpore gestat.
But how small soever it be,
it hath drawn out Levia∣than
with an Hook, which
it presents to you; and so
do I by it, my thankful ac∣knowledgments
for all your

favours; praying for an
increase of all happiness on
your self, your religious
Lady, and your hopeful son
my scholler with the rest of
your Family: which is the
hearty desire of
