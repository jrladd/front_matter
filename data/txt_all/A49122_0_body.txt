THe favourable Opinion which Your Lordship entertain'd of the Author's Endeavours, to Assert the Government established in the State, hath drawn on Your Lordship the trouble of this Confident Address, in behalf of the Church, both which were with equal Violence Assaulted; the one by an All-Dispensing Power, the other by an Absolute Liberty, each of which, like an Indian Hurricane, had well nigh hurried all into Confusion: And there are still a sort of Lapland Sorcerers, that would give Vent to the like Winds to encrease our Storms, wherefore, as when a breach is made in the Banks of a Nation, by impetuous and mighty Waves, all hands are at work to Re∣pair the Breach, and give check to the invading Waters; and the Labours of many Hands would be in vain, without the Heads of experienced and able Persons to direct and encourage them; so would the Endeavours of obscure Persons be ineffe∣ctual, if not influenced and authoriz'd by such as are invested with Power, and endued with Parts to exert their Endeavours for the Preservation of the True Religion and Loyalty: Na∣ture
teacheth those Creatures that are weak, to seek their Quiet and Safety among the unaccessible Rocks, and to build their Nests, for the Security of themselves and their Off-spring, on the tallest Cedars. And we see how the Sun that attracts only Vapors from the Earth, and such as obsure its face, doth by the warm influence of its Rays quickly purify them, and return them in wholsome Showers, which makes the Earth fruitful for the common Good. The sence of my Weakness is the best A∣pology I can make for taking Sanctuary in so sure a Name, which is an Open and Strong Holt, and from a Person that acts vigorously in so high an Orb, the weakest Instrument may hope to be acted for the Publick Welfare.
The Design of this small Tract (may it please Your Lord∣ship) is to Countermine that Absolute and Ʋncontrolable Li∣berty in Religious Worship, which they that contend for it now, have formerly baffled and condemned, and for which the Au∣thor of a late Letter for Liberty, hath prepared his Mine, and like another Faux, with his Dark Lanthorn, is ready to blow up the Religion and Loyalty, by GOD's Blessing, now Established, into meer Air and Atheism: And, besides the Mischief of the Design, nothing could Apologize for the Presumption of this slender Dedication, but Your sincere Espou∣sing of that Great Cause, and Animating such as appears for it, which hath given me the Confidence to Subscribe myself
