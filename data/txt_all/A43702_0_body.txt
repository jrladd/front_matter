SIR,
AS the many Civilities receiv'd from You, most justly Challenge an Ac∣knowledgment, so Your exqui∣site Perfections in Learning and Ingenuity, render this Dedi∣cation duly applyed; by the

former whereof, to own Your Candor and Generosity, by the latter to bespeak (by the Touch-Stone of Your perusal and ap∣probation) a sufficient Security from the Snarlings and Insults of those Carping Zoylus's, who are such Self-Admirers, to approve of nothing of which themselves are not Authors; and are more disingeniously Witty in Criticising, and dis∣canting on others performances, than in rectifying and amend∣ing what they pretend so de∣fective. And here, SIR, I am not ignorant, that while I am barely owning your Favours instead of a Compensation, I am running farther on the Score,

which I doubt not however, but your Goodness will readily par∣don, since 'tis not practicable for one to pay, where another is not willing to receive.
There is one things, SIR, I have omitted in the following Discourse (as not being practi∣sed till it was finished,) i. e. To observe how great a Mischief we are falling into, by giving considerable Sums of Money for the prompt payment of Bank and other Notes, of which the Rates grow so high, as 'tis to be feared will in a short time ruine our Paper Credit, which used to be very considerable in the way of Trade, and which must needs be abated if not to∣tally

ruined thereby, unless the Government by some means or other put a speeedy stop thereto; for Men are grown to that pass, that few will pay their just Debts (tho' of Money lent, and they have considerable Sums by them,) unless you'l take a Note, which they have made by this ill Practice, at least 10 per Cent. less than Money: So that tho' we had our Comple∣ment of Running Cash, we shall find, that if this practice be per∣mitted, we shall never have Notes in better Credit, nor rea∣dy Money paid in much more plenty than now it is, as I could easily prove by sundry instances, were it not matter more proper

for another place, than this E∣pistle: Which before I. con∣clude, I shall only further ob∣serve, That I look upon the great Mistake of such as are for having the nominal value of our Coin raised, the Alloy therein more, or the same Coin∣ed lighter, to be owing chiefly to this misguided Supposition; That we in this Island live in∣dependantly without having a∣ny thing to do with Foreign Countries, which did we do the making any thing currant by Stamp, that has little or no va∣lue in it self, would I coefess, be sufficient to make it serve to most Ends and Purposes of Inland Trade and Bargains: But if

we consider our selves, with re∣spect to Foreign Dealings and Traffique, we shall find we are so much the more at a loss, by how much the Extrinsick value of our Coin exceeds the Real or Intrinsick.
But lest I should by prolixity misuse the liberty of this Dedi∣cation, and retain your Thoughts too long from the Entertainment of Subjects more Noble, and so∣lidly Refined, I subscribe my self with all Sincerity,
