Madam,
I Should be unjust to complain of the Rigours of the Inquisition,
and the ill usage which I received from her Officers, since
they have administred to me the subject matter of this Work, and
thereby afforded me the advantage of Dedicating it to you. I should
desire, Madam, to make a just use of so favourable an occasion,
to have an Eloquence proportionable to my Zeal. I would em∣ploy
it in speaking of so many excellent Qualities, wherewith
Heaven hath so liberally endued you, which render you one of
the most aimable Persons of the World, and cause you to
be already admired by all those who know you. In truth there
is observed in you a Goodness and Sweetness which Charm, a vi∣vacity
and penetration of Spirit which surprise, a Prudence and
Discernment, which are not ordinary to Persons of your Age
But this, Madam, deserves our astonishment, that you are so
accomplished; that to create a just Idea of you, and make your
Elogy in few words, it doth not suffice to say that you are the
worthy Daughter of two Persons, no less Eminent and Illustri∣ous
for their Piety, than for their Birth and Quality.
May Heaven grant, Madam, that your Merit may be fellow∣ed
by an uninterrupted Happiness; that your Prosperity may
surpass even the measure of your Desires; and that this Book,
which I present to you, may be scattered into the most remote
Provinces; not so much to instruct People in what passeth in the
Tribunals of the Holy Office, as to preserve the memory of your
Illustrious name; and serve for an Eternel Proof of that profound
respect, wherewith I am,
Madam,
