WHat should I wish to that my Sou'raigne hath
But long Continuance, both of Him, and it?
Long to liue the Defender of true Faith,
Our IOSVA Long o're Israel to sit,
Long t'entertaine the Saints of God like LOT;
To be our DAVID Long, our SOLOMON;
Still keeping without blemish, without blot:
The Fathers Zeale, the Wisedome of the Sonne.
To these (O God) what should we pray thee giue?
But (as I said) Continuance and long date,
To liue the dayes METHVSALA did liue,
And after, when he falls'ith hand of Fate:
O yet vouchsafe in mercy some delayes,
To Adde to our good EZECHIAS dayes!
Maneant afata nepote.
