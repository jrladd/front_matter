The boke of Fraūces Petrarch / of the remedy of yll fortune / at the cōmaunde∣ment of your highnesse / I assayd / as my power wolde serue me / to make into our englyss. And after I had made a profe of nyne or ten Dialogues / the labour be¦gan to seme tedious / by su{per}fluous often rehersyng of one thyng. which tho {per}a∣uenture in the latyn shalbe laudable / by plentuous diuersite of the spekyng of it (for I wyll nat that my iugement shall disalowe in any thyng so aproued an au¦ctour) yet for lacke of suche diuersyte in our tong / it shulde want a great dele of the grace. Altho / as me semeth / and as sayth this Plutarch / the plentuousnesse and faire diuersyte of lāgage / shulde nat so moch be desyred in suche thynges / as the frutes of the aduertysmentes of thē / whiche in my opinyon / this sayde Plu∣tarch hath handsomly gadred togyder / without tedyousnesse of length / contay∣nīg

the hole effect / of that your hyghnes desyred of Petrarch in his lytell boke / which he wrate to one of his frendes / of the Quiete of mynde / nerawhyt erryng from the purpose of the sayd Petrarch. which I haue made now of late ī to our tong nat p̄cisely (I cōfesse) wtout errour as one shulde haue done that had ben of perfite lernyng / but after my rudenesse / seking rather the profite of the sentence than the nature of the wordes. but how¦soeuer it be / if it may please your hygh∣nesse to accept it / it shall nat onely be a defence for the symplenesse of the boke / agaynst ouer busy serchers of other mē∣nes act{is} / whan the good wyll shall haue the alowance of so vertuous a iugemēt / but also corage to the symple endeuour of this hande / towarde better ent̄prises. And tho the smalnesse of the present be great / in respecte of that / that accordeth to your exellence / the sentence parauen∣ture shall nat be moche vnacceptable / if it greue nat your grace to marke it after your accustomed wysdome. Pleseth thā your hyghnesse to pardone thouerbold∣nesse of your moost humble slaue / where he presenteth you / for the good lucke of

this newe yere / with this his symple la∣bour / and with as moch quiete of mynde as this boke pretendeth / alwayes pray∣eng god to sende you thonorable desyre of your vertuous hert.
At Alyngton the last day of Decembre. M.D.xxvij.
