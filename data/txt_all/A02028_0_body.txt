MADAME:
THe sincere conceit of your worthines, consisting part∣ly in those heauenly en∣dowments, wherewith the Lord hath beautified and adorned you, as solid wis∣dome, pietie, humilitie, sinceritie in all things: herein shewing your selfe the expresse image of that worthy, and iudicious man Sir Iohn Brograue your Father; and chiefely in your Christian loue towards all that loue God, and liue a godly life: euen these sole considerati∣ons

haue moued mee to dedicate this small and worthlesse worke to your Ladiship, which if it shall please you to accept as the Widowes mite, into the treasury of your other Bookes, esteeming it rather by the minde of the giuer, then valuing it by the weight of it selfe, you shall fully satisfie my desire. The Lord conti∣nue still his wonted goodnesse, and louing kindnesse towards you, who as he hath made you a ioyfull Mother of many faire children, and carefull of their vertuous education; so it would please his heauenly Maiesty to ful∣fill your ioy, in your latter daies, by beholding their vertuous courses and desired establish∣ment here in the earth; that in the end both you and they may reioyce together for euer in the promised Canaan, when your Arabian pilgrimage is here finished. Amen.
From Botterwike in Holland, neere Boston in Lincoln.
