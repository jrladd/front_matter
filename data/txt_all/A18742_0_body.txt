SOme men (righte Ho∣norable) searche many soyles, and trauell very farre, to finde out a pre∣tious Iewell or rare de∣uise, to presente vnto their friende when they come home. And gayning by their gift and honest intent a thankefull bene∣fite and special good turne, makes of their labours a pleasure and cōmoditie. But I, that often haue bin abroade for the like purpose, and heere at home haue soughte the bottome of my studie, and sifted out the best frute, that eyther deuise of head,

or paynes with my penne could yeeld, can not finde any thing worthy acceptation, where I made promise, and purposed long ago, to offer a presente. And the longer I haue tarried (and looked about me) the worse I am furnished for the answering of my hope, and the lesse able I feele my iudgemente, to performe that I purpose: like a mā that would fayne trauell a great iourney, hauing a weake body, and a lusty mind. And before he commes halfe way to the ende of his pilgrimage: his legges waxe lame, and he calleth for his crutche, and yet when there is no remedy, must ei∣ther of force hoppe homewarde againe, or hale forward as fast as he may, to come to the knitting vp of his attempted labour. But though with like weakenes my body is discouraged (when the mind glories too muche in his owne strength,) yet another thing comforts me, which may be a great help to my smal ability, & a special cause

to find thereby some singular fauour. Sir, the troth is, I heare that others haue sped wel, & were well liked, for presenting to your honourable discretiō, the iudgement of their Bookes: and creeping vnder the buckler & sheld of such courtesie, though not with such matter as is meete for your wisedome, I humbly presente you with a breefe discourse that I haue drawne out, touching the troubles & afflictiō of Flā∣ders, not gathered out of other mēs gar∣dens (the more my ouersight) as the Bee sucketh forth honey from seuerall sweete floures, but collected and takē frō the cō∣passe of mine owne knowledge & experi∣ence of our time, in the view of mine eye, & reach of my reason. Yet had I beauti∣fied my Boke, with the depe iudgemēts of my betters, & filled the empty places & sētēces voyd of learning, with some boro∣wed tearmes & fine trāslatiōs, as wisely & lernedlie some haue done, my ignorāce

and boldnesse heerein so soone had not bin espyed, and I might haue found more pillrs and proppes to haue susteyned vp from falling a long season, my weake and feble workemanship, and tottering building: but wanting that prouision and foresight, and bringing frō the Printer my Booke, I make my selfe and my cre∣dite subiecte to the worldes reporte, and must desire your honorable countenance, to the furthering of my good name, and liking of my worke. And for that of late you were Embassadour in Flaunders, and haue bin long acquainted with the causes of that Countrey, I haue dedica∣ted my paynes heerein to your hands and protection, minding, if this be well accep∣ted (as I doubt not but it shall be) to set forth another worke, called, the calami∣tie of Fraunce, the bloudy broyles of Germany, the persecution of Spayne,

the misfortune of Portingall, the trou∣bles of Scotlande, the miserie of Ire∣lande, and the blessed state of England, as knoweth the Lord of all Kingdomes, who accomplish and fulfil the good course your noble mind hath held, and make your desired hope to be as happy as your well wonne fame doth deserue ho∣noure.
