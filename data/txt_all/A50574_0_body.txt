May it please Your Grace,
THough the number, and wit of such as use to write Dedi∣cations, may seem to have exhausted all that can be said upon such occasions: yet I have a new way of address left me, which is, to write nothing of you, but

what is true, by the confession of your ene∣mies, who admire more the greatness of your Parts, than of either your Interest, or Success: And how you have made so great a turn in this Kingdom, without either Blood or Forfeiture, shewing neither revenge, as to what is past, nor fear as to what is to come; continuing no long∣er your unkindness to any man, than you think he continues his opposition to his Prince.
All have at sometime confest, that you have been the Ornament, as well as Defence of your Native Countrey, to whom every Scot∣tish-man is almost as dear, as every man is to his own Relations. And I am sure that your enemies will find it easier to put you from your Office, then to fill it; and none of them can wish you to be removed, without being him∣self a loser by it. Nor can I be so unjust, even to such as oppos'd you, as not to acknowledge that I have heard them talk of you so advanta∣giously (when design and interest oblidged them to dissemble) as almost convinced me,

that the most of them opposed you only in pu∣blick, rather from the glory of having so great an Adversary, than from the justice of the un∣dertaking. And your Countrey has in their late Confluences, (where they crouded in mighty numbers, and with a remarkable joy to meet you, when a privat man) shew'd greater respect to your naked merit, then to the highest Characters by which others were marked out for publict honour.
Having writ this Book to inform my Coun∣trey-men, and to illuminat our Law, I could not present it more justly to any, than to your Grace, who has derived your Blood from a Noble Family, which has been still eminent in our Courts of Justice, since we had any; and who are your self, the greatest States-man in Europe, who is a Schollar; and the greatest Schollar, who is a States-man: For to hear you talk of Books, one would think you had bestowed no time in studying men; and yet to observe your wise conduct in affairs, one might

be induced to believe, that you had no time to study Books. You are the chief man who does nobly raise the study of the Civil Law, to a happy usefulness, in the greater and ge∣neral Affairs of Europe, and who spends the one half of the day in studying what is just, and the other half in practising what is so: All which may be easily believed, from me who am as great an instance of your generosity, as an ad∣mirer of it. Especially since you have left me nothing to wish, so that what I say, needs not flow from flattery, and so must be presu∣med to flow from conviction and gratitude in,
