Most Worthy Patriots,
I Presume to Dedicate this Pamphlet to you, (for I can call it no more, and I presume you will stile it no less) considering your coupled Loy∣alty; and withal to inform you, that there is nothing contained herein, a∣gainst the Loyal Party of that Emporium of Christendom, and Metropolis of Lon∣don, but only the Dissenters: which I think I am in duty bound to do, and requires the Pen of a Cleveland, though never so Sarcastick, to reduce them to Obedience. I beseech you be not offended at my Endeavours, because they are honest, and no ways injuri∣ous, and little offensive, but what may pass the censure of a Scholastick

tick without blame; at least, under the notion of a Licentia Poetica, if Bur∣lesque Rhythme may be allowed it. I do not in the least question your appro∣bation primâ facie; but if you disrelish any thing herein, I am so much a Sto∣ick, that I value not your Censure or Opinion: yet however, with permis∣sion, give me leave to acquaint you, that if you disapprove of it, I know who will not. This is all at present from



IF the Author's Name in the close of the Epistle cramps your Vnderstanding, let me advise you, as a friend, to consult the Worshipful Dr. OATES, (who has been of most (I had almost said all) Religi∣ons:) and if he has not forgot his Greek and Latine, as much as he has forfeited his Religion and Honesty, I believe he may be your Interpreter.
