Right Honorable,
MAY it please you in these

troublesome daies of ours, to behold the man, who though (with o∣pen mouth) he tel∣leth not all things that every one hath done, Yet (by lively exam∣ple) teacheth what every one ought to be ready to doe; Even for Kings, and for all that are

in Authority; that we may lead a qui∣et and peaceable life, in all godli∣nesse, and hone∣sty.
His Person, whilest hee lived, wanted not the love and favour of a King, to advance him to dignity; & let not this Post∣hume worke of his

lacke your Honors protection and pa∣tronage, to keepe it from indigni∣ty.
A Midwives care reacheth no further than the safe bringing the Infant into the world, the mainte∣nance and prote∣ction thereof, she commendeth to

the Father and o∣ther Friends.
This Orphan by my meanes hath happily seene the Light, but want∣ing a Father, as be∣ing deceased be∣fore his birth, I pre∣sume to commend its defence and tu∣ition to your Ho∣nour as a friend, & your Lordshippes

selfe to the graci∣ous protection of the Lord, who grant you ever the continuance of your honour, to you and your pos∣terity for ever:
So prayeth
