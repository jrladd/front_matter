Gentlemen,
EVER since my First Thoughts of writing this History, I have frequently consider'd whom I should select, as a fit Patron of my Endeavors this way; but these Con∣siderations still concluded, that you, who on the firm Foundation of your own Ex∣cellence, have establish'd your selves in the Esteem of the more solid part of Mankind, without the Auxiliary Support of any great Man's Assistance; that You who had no Richelieu to cherish your first Essays, or guard your Rising Merit, were ablest to Patronize that, which chiefly aim'd at giving the World a Draught, in little, of what it ow'd to your Incomparable Performances. If it were not, that most Writers have a sordid present Gain in View, when they design a Dedication, I am confident, we should see few Noblemens Names at the beginning of their Works, since it must be confess'd, 'twould be more for the Advan∣tage of their Reputation, to chuse one another for Patrons; a Writer being better qualified to defend that, which he has once espous'd, with his Pen, than any Great man, with his empty Name, or a long Catalogue of Titles. At least I am sure, no man will think my Choice improper, when he shall consider, how well able you are to protect my Failings with your Invincible Pens, against all those, who shall hereafter attaque them. Nor will the Defect of what I have writ, make me at all despair of your favourable Reception, since every Action ought to receive its Value from the Intention, not the awkward manner of Per∣formance. My Will design'd your Honor, tho' my Pen has not come up to the Greatness of my Aim. I was no sooner convinced by what you published, of the Possibility of carry∣ing on so Noble an Undertaking, but I resolved to attempt this History, which I hop'd to perfect without the knowledge of any of your Learned Society, being sensible that your aboun∣ding Modesty would endeavour to stifle that, which might bear the least resemblance of a Pane∣gyri, in the Eye of even the Envious; but by the want of Caution in some concern'd in the publishing it, I found, before the last sheet was printed, one of your Society had Intel∣ligence of it, whose Letter may convince the World, that this Fear of mine was not with∣out Just Ground. But I will not pretend wholy to justifie my self, for publishing this Hi∣story without your Leave, since a thing of this nature, indeed, merited better Helps than I had to the compiling of it, and none were capable of affording them effectually but your selves; yet it was an Error of the better side, a Trespass caus'd by a too unconsidering Esteem, and Value for your Noble Undertaking, and no less Performances, which have not only engag'd me in this Affair, but alwaies to be, as I must here subscribe my self;
Gentlemen,
