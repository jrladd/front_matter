THe many obligations (hono∣red Sir) which your deserving actions have made me servant to draw mee to another en∣gagement, which is no lesse noble, then those boundlesse bounties, which you so oft have conferred upon me: Therefore I now become an humble petitioner, tht your good liking will protect mee from the detraction of all Momsts and Zoy∣lans; and in so doing, I shall not feare that any one will say this my off-spring is

illegitimate, because your favourable eye not onely nullifies the malice of all ad∣verse wills, but addes baptisme to this in∣nocent, which here lies mute, wrapped up in the purity of white sheets: nay more, your gentle worded censure con∣firmes the same, and inlists it in the roule of Fame and Reputation. Admire then this small pension of my braine with mild benevolence, so may you adde courage to a young beginner, and make his La∣bour immortall by your smiling favour; for except this modell find mercy in your kinde acceptance, the creation, which I bestowed upon it, was onely to make it nauseall to all mens stomacks, and me ri∣diculous, because I ever observed your word to be of more value, then ever my merits could reach unto; then what is it that Your countenance will not perswade, if You please to adde but a few silla∣bles to make your will appeare? Si dicas, factum est. If I thought or knew not your power to be prevalent in this which I request, I would not have so audaciously adventured to sollicite any such curtesie;

but I am confirmed of this knowledge, and confident of your ever too little prai∣sed good nature, which is a perfect spark of that heavenly goodnesse which giveth all things, because Your chiefe desire is to helpe Your friend with all sort of encou∣ragement possible, and communicating Your best endeavours to the bettering of all those that strive to deserve: And therefore I am confident I shall finde You my firme and reall Friend, to gaine that benevolence for me, for which I will ever remaine
