My LORD,
SCriblers of my Profession, pay so natural a De∣votion to Greatnes that the least dawn of Ap∣probation from an Eminent Personage, fires 'em with a more than ordinary Assurance, and is Armour sufficient against the Censure of the World. This, my Lord, has enboldened me to that height, that I can confidently scorn the malicious Critick on the one side, and the revenging Jesuit on the other: for what blinded Bigot will dare shew his missive obe∣dience, when your Lordship's Name (the greatest Charm against all their Sorceries) appears to own me? Your Lorship's Name, which must blossom on the Records of our latest Posterity. It would be needless in me, to de∣clare how well your Lordship has deserved in England; it is a Theam, of which the most ignorant of the Orcades are full, and which the most envious of the Court must acknowledge. England, in its greatest Exigence, has

found your Lordship its fastest Friend, and at that time too when honest actions were perform'd in danger, when the sword of Damocles hung over the heads of the most zealous Protestants. But 'tis not enough that the world acknowledges your Lordship the greatest of States-men, unless it does your Merit that justice, to own you the bol∣dest and the loyallest too: for State-policy is of that comprehensive quality, and includes such Motions of that strangely-distant Latitude, that I can onely com∣pare it to the Poets God of Fire; it either refines the Oar, and mints the very Gold that adorns the shining Palaces of Kings, or forges out the Thunder that destroys 'em. Nay, too often that very Policy that has the fai∣rest face of Allegiance, whose Counsels should be a Guide and Light to Majesty, (for without derogation to the Divinity of a Crown, Kings are sometimes but Men) is but the meer Exhalation of Greatness, a Va∣pour which the Breath of Soveraignty raises higher or lower, whilst (like the Cloud that either rains, hails, or snows) it either cools or warms but with the Air it meets with. And thus the States-man that should be the Counsellour, is but the Eccho of Power, rather the Minister of his Prince's Pleasure than Glory; and so little executes the great Office he undertakes, that he is scarce the shadow of what he represents. But all such flatter∣ing and mercenary service, your Lordship's braver Soul abhors, whilst your undaunted Councels are unshockt by Frowns, and unbribed by Honours. Our England has in one circumstance the fate of Troy; our Establisht Religion is our true Palladium; and whilst that is preser∣ved, we are invincible, unhurt by all the Hostility of the

world; but that once gone, our ruin'd Troynovant is but an universal Conflagration: and he that like your Lord∣ship most studies to secure that Palladium, maintains the brightest Jewel in his Princes Crown, and is both his So∣veraign's best Subject, and his Countries truest and faithfullest Champion.
Thus whilst there is that Party for whose Defeat your Lordship has so strenuously and so justly labour'd, you have onely acted as an English Patriot: Your unfathom'd Depths foresaw the dangerous Faction, no less threat∣ning than a growing Phaeton; and in your Lordships vi∣gorous and indefatigable opposition, your very Enemies, if they will take leisure to think, must with shame con∣fess your Memorable and Loyal Councels have with a plain and unclouded Aspect so much tended to an uni∣versal and eternal preservation of Peace, that all men of sense must plainly see you would rather side with a counselling Phoebus, than a destroying Jupiter; would rather by your timely advice prevent the Combustion of a world, than call down Thunder too late to punish the Incendiaries.
Thus your Lordship's unwearied Service to your King and Country, must undoubtedly spring from an unque∣stionable Principle of Loyalty: and as no little Argument for it, If Loyalty were ever truely generous, 'tis in your Lordship; for with the Philosophers description of Ver∣tue, 'tis alone its own Reward.
And now I cannot but reflect on your Lordships numerous Enemies, nor better rank 'em than under these three Files.
The first, the Romish Zealot, a certain kind of ig∣norant Devote, to whom the very Fundamentals of his Religion are as unintelligible as the Language his Pray∣ers are in. 'Tis true, Rome has a wiser sort of Disciples, of which is the person of Sense and Quality; but then considering ten to one his Ancestors were all of his opinion, he thinks it inconsistent with his glory either to examine or alter his Faith on any Terms, lest in so doing he should in effect call his Forefathers all Fools, and give his whole Generation the Lye. And thus by a certain kind of wilde Irish Honour, who draw with their Horses tails for the reputation of their Grand-sires; their infatuated Zeal is entayled upon 'em, and they hold their Titles by no other Tenure.
The second sort is the ambitious Libertine, who al∣ways sides with the Rising Party; who tho indeed he is of no Faith at all, yet appears as zealous for a Religion of Quality, as a Spanish Jew at Mass, and rather than stand out when his Interest is at stake, would e'en turn Mahometan, and almost circumcise to be Great.
The last Class is a sort of People of neither Birth, Principles, nor Estates; a kind of indigent Bullies, who in all Companies run down Religion and Property, be∣cause they have neither Conscience nor Lands to lose; and therefore are for Change at any Rate, and desire Tumults onely to scramble for Bread.
If these are your Lordships Enemies, I will not be so

impertinent as to tell the world who are your Friends: But to excuse all the Discouragements you meet, if your Lordship's Truth and Desert are not always prosperous, 'tis onely where your Oracles have had the fate of a Pro∣phecying Cassandra.
However, encouraged or depress'd, your Lordship preserves an equal Serenity of Minde; and whereas the Malice of your Adversaries would cast an Aspersion on your glorious Toyls, by saying your Zeal's too violent; your Lordship may justly make this Answer, That your Vehemence, like the fire in the Flint, never sparkled till it was struck from you, and that too by the severest Stroke, that all good men should most sensibly feel, your Countries imminent Danger. Nor is your con∣tinued Scrutiny into Reasons, Policies, Men, and Man∣ners, the whole Fatigue of your Soul; for to draw the true portraict of the Earl of Shaftsbury, he is a perfect Character between the restless Alexander and the sul∣len Diogenes; you want the head-long Ambition of the first, and the Moroseness of the last; and between 'em both, at once you study and enjoy the world.
And if amidst your more serious Affairs, so mean a Trifle as a Play may intrude under your Lordship's Roof, this, of all Poems, may most presume; for 'tis your Crea∣ture, and owes its very being to your Lordship: for as Plays and Poetry should make the discountenancing of the greatest Vices their chiefest Theme, 'tis your Lord∣ship's unmasking of Rome that gave me the Light to chuse my Story: And 'tis by your Lordship's influence

too that it now appears in publick: for had not your Lordship been an English Cicero, and by your timely Wisdom and Eloquence stood up in your Countries Deliverance, by this time perhaps our Catalines had been victorious; and then the melancholy Muses must have cryed,
Inter Arma silent Artes.
Or if at last the Theatre had e're revived again, this prophane Heretical Play must never have dared to have looked Light i'th' face.
But if any of my Critical Readers should tell me that I have laid more to the charge of my Petticoat-Pope than Story will warrant; if such an Objection be, I have onely this way to make my Excuse, and rectifie my Mistake; that is, by begging her Successors to share it amongst 'em: for there have been Birds enough of that Feather through all Ages, to challenge all the borrow'd Plumes I have given her, were they ten times as many as they are.
But now, as I am a Stranger to your Lordship, should your Lordship ask who this bold Presumer is that lays this Poem at your feet; I am a Thing so nameless, and so incon∣siderable, that I can onely describe my self by Negatives. And first, I am no Temporizer, as your Lordship may believe by the choice of my Subject: next, I am no Po∣litician; for that Scribler must have no prospect to his Interest, who dares affront so numerous a Party that are

so powerful a Support of the Stage: and lastly, I am no Hypocrite; for I write as I think: nor am I like Clod∣pate's Fidler, that sings against his Conscience.
I believe this plain dealing may have gain'd me a great many Enemies; but I cannot be concern'd at their Ma∣lice, since it gives me the glory of publishing my self,
My Lord,
