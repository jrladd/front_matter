Right HON: and Right Wor psll:
THis Sermon not
long since prea∣ched
in your
publique As∣semblie,
is be∣sides,
though
not against my
will publisht: The seuere censure of

the eare amazed me, but that more
exquisite Test of the eye, doth little
lesse thn confound me: Euen Man∣na
in this kinde is distasted of our cor∣rupt
natures; And but that I know
there are stomackes, that will desire
Fruit when they refuse wholsommer
dyet, I must not haue aduentured so
ill a cook't dish to so various pallats;
Some, I hope, will looke vpon this
piece without any thought of the
worthlesse Author; and if in it they
finde ought either for Information
of judgement, which I dare not hope,
or Reformation of life, which is
the All of my ambition, the Whole
neither to them, nor me may proue
vnfruitfull.
The subject of it being our late hea∣uy
Affliction, with it's ill cause

our Transgressions, and it's good
effect our Sorrow, together with
GODS gratious deliuerance and
our heartie Thanksgiuing for it,
this Citie, the Stage of those scoenes
may justly challenge it as her owne;
And to whom then within these
Walls doth it of right belong, but to
your Lordship the present, and that
other worthy Gent: the last prin∣cipall
Magistrate therein? whose
sad eyes were witnesses of what this is
onely a rude and vnpolisht draught;
He had the happinesse to out-liue
those many Deaths, to finish his
course not more in safetie then Ho∣nour:
You haue the Honour to enjoy
the yeare of Thankfulnesse, to rule
in a cleare and faire skie, wherein
it will bee your Crowne to destroy

the Cockatrice in the egge, seuere∣ly
at first to punish these Transgres∣sions
and Iniquities, which like
Garden-weedes will spring vp in
a sun-shine after a storme, and, if
not preuented, will o're-runne the
whole Plot, and bring againe the like
desolation;Heb. 13. 8. God is the same yester∣day,
to day and for euer, the same
to see, to hate, to punish Malefa∣ctors;
Hitherto onely the hands or
toes of Adonibezick haue beene
cut off,Iudg. 1. 6. his life spared; Worse things
then what wee yet haue suffered, may
befall vs: You are at the Sterne, and
may be a great meanes to preuent
Ship-wracke: Good lucke haue
you with your Honour, ride on
prosperously, and let the Word
of Truth guide, and it will defend
you.

Bee pleased to pardon his bold∣nesse
that meanes and wishes well,
and humbly offers not onely This
but himselfe
in all due respect:
