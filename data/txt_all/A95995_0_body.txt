MY LORD,
SHould I recount what your
Lordship hath both done
& suffer'd for your King, it
would not only make our
present discourse swel be∣yond
the just proportion of an Epistle, but
also anticipate the pains of those more
able penns, which are design'd to write

the Story of our times, to which your par∣ticular
actions will necessarily contribute
ample supply of matter, and in which
your single name will (doubtless) with
high honour to your self be often repea∣ted.
That un-envied, because deserved Dignity
which your Lordship (through the grace
and favour of your wise and discerning
Master) now stands possest of, is a clear de∣monstration
as well of your great abilities,
as untainted loyalty: and from hence we
must take the true height and prospect of
them both. How happy then is the Prince
where so prudent and trusty a Minister
hath the chief management of affairs?
and how secure the People where so expe∣rienc'd
and watchfull a Pilot sits at the
helm?
But, MY LORD, whilest I give your
Lordship your due Character, I make my
self guilty of a too rash presumption, thus
to adventure to interpose between your
Lordship and your more weighty affairs,
and with a discourse of so different and in∣feriour

a mixture, to divert your more ma∣terial
and serious Cogitations: but again,
when I consider that your Lordship is the
person to whom those, who by the rigour
of the Law are opprest, make their appeal,
and who, by virtue of your office, mitigate
that summum jus, which is indeed summa in∣juria,
I then begin to resume new spirits,
and to hope that I shall find, by your can∣did
acceptance of this my Dedication, that
you carry a constant Chancery in your breast,
as well when out of the Court, as when
you sit in Judicature. Had I any thing
better I should with all humilty cast it at
your Lordships feet; and did my abilities
bear proportion with my desires, I should
make you a more suitable present: but
since that is denied me, I earnestly beseech
you to accept this, (such as it is) as a testi∣mony
of that unfeigned reverence I have
for your virtues, both publick and private,
for your accomplishments both Civil and
Moral; whereof the one denominate you
a good States-man, and the other a good man:
qualifications rarely meeting in one and

the same subject. And for this, My Lord,
for the contemplation of your inherent worth
I mean (which, with those who make a
true judgement of things, is much more
attractive then the splendor of your adhe∣rent
greatness) be pleas'd to give me leave,
though obscure, unknown, and as great
a stranger to the world as I am to your
Lordships person, to assume the title of
MY LOKD,
