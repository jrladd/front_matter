SIR,
THE Ensuing POEM, Enti∣tul'd, the Sight's Retreat, be∣ing the Off-spring of an obscure Muse, is, with all Deference, Dedicated by the Author himself, to your Discreet Com∣passion, who being of late almost o're∣whelm'd with Darkness, and his Can∣dle at present quite Extinguish'd, hum∣bly takes leave on a just Consideration of your manifold Virtues and Perfections, to Illuminate the same, and Light it a∣gain at your Honour's Altar, who am with all due Submission,
