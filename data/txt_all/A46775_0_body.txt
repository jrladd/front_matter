May it please your Sa∣cred Majesty;
WHat in this little Book is contain∣ed, being the Motives of of our Conversions to the amient Apostolical, Catholique, Roman,
Church; we have made bold to Didicate it to Your Serene Majesty, and also our Harts Blood and Life, to the Service of your Royal Spouse Great James the Se∣cond.
We humbly beg Par∣don for presuming to put the Products of so weak Brains under so Prince∣ly and Gracious a Pa∣tronage; acknowledging a Matter of so great
Moment, not only far above our unlearned Ca∣pacities, but that rather it required the Learning of St. Hierome, the E∣loquence of St. Chrisos∣tome, the Quick Witt of St. Augustine, the Sobriety of St. Ambrose, and sweet Stile of St. Barnard.
But Madam, if fa∣vourably received by your Great Majesty, our Adversaries who
will undergo to answer it, shall find that Chil∣dren set upon the shoul∣ders of so High Giants, as the forementioned Pi∣ous Fathers were; shall see farther into Heaven∣ly Religion, than he that proudly will not follow Scripture Councils, nor Fathers, but his own human Inventions, and private Spirits, after the creuel Example of the Tyrant Proclus,
who made Men of all Proportions, fit the length of his Bed, by cutting off him what was too long, or by draw∣ing him longer who was too short.
Most Sacred Ma∣dam, what is promised, if received into Your Majesties Protection, which we most humbly beg, may be the easier performed, because the chast Spouse of the most
High; wanteth not a thousand Bucklers of Defence: Again humb∣ly beging Pardon for this Ambition, of a∣vowing our selves, Your Majesties.
