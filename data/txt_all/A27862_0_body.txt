My Lord,
THe favourable sentence your Lordship past on the follow∣ing Paraphrase, when it first appeared before you as its judge, has encouraged me to make choice

of you alone for its Patron: and I heartily wish it were as fit an ob∣ject of your Protection now, as it was then of your Clemency. There is nothing, I confess, worthy its Commendation to so Great a Name, but the Argument on which it is employ'd; and having design'd it to the Service of the Altar, I was convinc't there was no hand more proper than your Lordships to offer it up there. For beside the perfect understanding, which your Lordship has of affairs of this nature (being able not only most justly to decree according to the old, but to give new, and more substan∣tial Laws to all kinds of Poesy) the most considerable part of the ensuing Work was done under your Lord∣ships jurisdiction, in a place where I

had the happiness to enjoy all the contents of a private Retirement, and amongst the rest, that secessum scribentis, & otia, which the great Master of Verse knew absolutely necessary to such an undertaking. So that by the severest form of De∣dication, your Lordship has an un∣deniable right to this, and it would be a piece of great injustice, to make a Present of that to another, which to your self only is a true and war∣rantable debt. For such indeed it is, as respecting your Lordships Title, who, over and above all other qualifi∣cations, are the most obliging Promo∣ter of these studies; and on my part so easie to satisfie, that it amounts to little more than a bare acknow∣ledgement, like the presenting a Rose once a year, and doing Fealty

for some great Tenure; the smallest Chief-rent that can be paid by any Tenant, especially him, who has an ambition to hold of none, rather than your Lordship, all those Demesnes of Christian Poesy, if he may so call them, of which, under you alone, he desires to be look't upon as the Unworthy Improver, and to profess himself with all manner of Devotion,
Bensted Haunts, 1667.
