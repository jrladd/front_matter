AS a grateful Acknowledgment of that Favour you did us, in your Applicati∣on to His August Majesty, to know his Pleasure whether you might admit of a Disputation betwixt the Ministers of the Presbyterian and those of the Baptist's Perswa∣sion, (of which this is the best Account the Publisher could obtain;) whereupon His Majesty, out of his wonted Clemency, as an Effect of

that innate Goodness which he hath always ma∣nifested towards his Dissenting Protestant Sub∣jects, was graciously pleased to let us have His Royal Periion, in answer to your Request.
For which Favour, together with the Liber∣ty; we enjoy in the free Exercise of our Religi∣on, we desire to lay hold on this Occasion, to express our Thankfulness to God and the King; praying for His Majesty's Health and Prosperity in this World, and that God would vouchsafe to en∣rich him with a Crown of Glory in the World to come.
