AMongst sundry vn∣fained Louers of the truth, and welwillers to my simple selfe, I haue found you four not behind any, and before very many, whom as you doe excell in authority, gifts and care for your Countries good according to your meanes, and as these bad daies will suffer; so yee haue beene presi∣dents and examples of reuerence and zeale to the word of God, whereof ye
 are the constant hearers, and vpright practisers, shewing your selues ene∣mies, as to corruptions in manners, so to errours in Doctrine, and Idolatry in Gods seruice, whereof as occasion is offered yee bewray your detestati∣on. Now for your encouragement in euery good way (if a spurre may be added to such as run well, seeing none there is but may amend his pace, for wee are all imperfect and farre from the marke) as also for some part of recompence for your long continued and vndeserued affection of loue to me, my Ministry and labours, I haue presumed to set out vnderyour names a Dialogue concerning that excellent and most necessary point of Iustificati∣on, of elect sinners by faith in Iesus Christ: wherein, together with the truth of Doctrine positiuely set downe in the first part, vnder the names of Philoponus, and Philalethes, I haue afterward confuted what the Iewes, zealous of the Law, ioyning
 Moses with Christ, and Papists, prepo∣sterous commenders of good works, ioyning them with grace in the mat∣ter of Iustification, vse to alleage a∣gainst Christ the matter or subiect of Iustification; or what late seduced spirits can say against faith the instru∣ment of our righteousnes before God, vnder the names of Philoponos, Phi∣lopseudos, and Philautos. Also toward the end I haue indeuoured to meete with the abuse of this Doctrine of free Iustification by Libertines and carnall Gospellers, which turne the grace of God into wantonnesse, and thinke they may sinne more freely the more grace doth abound, vnder the name of Philedonos. I doe intreat you to interpret well my purpose in this Dedication, also to accept my weake endeauours: finally so to pardon my presumption, as ye render the praise to God of all the profit that comes to you by this booke.
