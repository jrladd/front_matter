I Se the Storm a comming, whether shall I
Seek Covert in the Mountain, or the Valley?
Or, else be take me to the silent stream,
And let the tempest burst and split his splean
Vpon the Earth; so I be safe and saven,
VVhile I shall ride at anchor in the Haven;
Alas, the fatall Sister-hood (in sport
VVill there betray thee; for within the Port,
Shipwrack hath disappointed and disgrac't,
The Proverb of long look't for comes at last;
Then wil I launch into the very Mayne
To see if Neptunes Diety wil dayne
To fence and fling his Trident on my Head,
By pewer whereof all storms are scattered;
VVhich if he do deny, my comfort it shall be,
My shipwrack great, Noble men shalt see
I sink not in a dicch, nor by the shore,
But dye, and lye at Neptunes Palace Dre:
Tis thou alone that bearst the Triple Mace,
Canst in the very speed of all their Chase
Restrain their pursuit, do but protect it,
The simple Misterious Nereides of the Prophet,
Charge Aeolus (as he does honour thee,
He do not dis-imbulk his Cheeks at me,
I have done nothing to offend thy traine,
Stole Amemone as the Poets fayne,
Nor sought to spoyle the Sea-gods bed of Corall;
I mean, Heavens Mysteries; for thats the Morall,
If this be so, vouchsafe me thy Protection,
That I may bring this work unto perfection;
Then will I sing thy fortune and thy fame,
And prove that CROMVVELS from the Trojans came;
Shew where his Ancestors long since did build
A seat which hitherto their name have fill'd:
Now may that name and honour nere expire,
But in a melting Firmament of fire.
From Cliffords-Inne, the
10. of May, 1655.
