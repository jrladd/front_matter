Dread Soueraigne,
OF all the crea∣tures of this Vni∣uerse, none draw∣eth neerer to the Creator thē man; neither any de∣gree of men, so much as doth the King, whether wee consider his
 persō or his Office. As the face of Moses descending the Mount from God, shone bright and glo∣rious: so the Maiesticke looke of a King (reflecting diuine beames, receiued from the King of Kings) daunteth the most proud and sa∣uadge hearts of Inferiors. There∣fore Kings are in holy Writ cal∣led Lights, for their glory; Gods for their power; and the Lords an∣nointed, to testifie their graces, and the dignity of their Office. And surely your Maiesty is a light, and a light of Israel, (Gods people) not onely for glory, but for example of piety, religion, and vertue: your Maiesty is Gods Lieutenant, executing his power, which consisteth chiefly in ordering & directing, in protecting and defending, in rewarding and punishing: in a word, your Maiesty is truely the
 Lords annointed, furnished with all Royall and Princely graces, and namely of a wise and vnder∣standing heart, to iudge and rule this geat & mighty people, ouer which the Lord hath placed you.
Wherefore I haue presumed (being but a Translator) to pre∣sent this small Treatise to your Maiesty, not as a thing worthy so iudicious view; but for that it treateth of the Authority of Kings, and for that it was by the Authour dedicated to a King his Maister, entitled Most Christian; & therefore for none more meet, thē your Maiesty, being truly stiled Defender of the fath. Wherein I beseech your Maiesty to pardon the boldnesse, and passe by the in∣firmities of him, that is bound (with all true subiects) vnfeigned∣ly to pray to the King of Kings, for your Maiesties long and pros∣perous
 raigne in this world, and an immortall Crowne of eternall felicity in the world to come.
