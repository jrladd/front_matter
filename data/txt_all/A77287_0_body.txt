OH Lord, Thou who art indeed excellent, te great Commander of all the world, who turnest all thing upside down, who hast the hearts of all men in thy hand and canst make the greatest persecutors and afflcting powers of darknesse, stoop to thee, Oh Lord, my God and Father, great are my enemies, one who is called Excellency; But oh Lord it is thou alone art Excellency, faithulnss and truth; and the others are Crowel, Ireton, Hsrig, Harrison and Whitchcock, under those Tyrannicall hand I am: my cause is the cause of thy people, the generall cause of Justice and Freedom; Thou knowest the sincerity of my spirit; oh Lord my enemie are in great honour and power, by the peoples blood, labours and treasure; If it be thy holy will let them acknowledg thee God of the whole earth, whose name and power hath made great changes in the world; Let them in ther conversations acknowledge the Scriptures, and testimonies of thy selfe, the laws and liberties of thy people, without respect of persons; If not, oh Lord put a hook in their nostrils, and a bridle in their jaws, that they may not use wick∣ed and crafty policy, and the treasure of thy people make them destroy one another, a∣gainst their laws and liberties: Uniteth people that are sincere to thee, and one to a∣nother, in righteousnesse and judgement, make up thy Jwels, and shew some w or other, some evident testimony of love to thy people, against the bloody designs of thine and their enemies, under what cloak or forme soever they appear in the world; keep me stedfast unto thy self against al the bloody intentions of my close politick and mighty enemies, and lt thy name and honour be exlted as indeed it is, whether in per∣secution or freedom: And if oh Lord they have such murtherous thoughts towards me, as O Lord thou knowest their actions are hitherunto wicked enough, and if they bring forth the wickedest and extreamest into action, O Lord let me continue constant in thy strength unto the deth, and make me willingly to imbrace my condition, and give testimony to thy self, and to the testimonies of thy self in Scripture, in spirit, in my own heart the testimony of my enemies themselves, and the enemies of our Lawes and Li∣berties: Purge me also O Lord, oh purge me; whilst I am in this mortality, and let me dye before I die: So prayes thy weak servant, and one of thy sons, in my cruel bondage as to men and freedom as to thee.

Whilest th' Authour striveth for his Countries good,
An under-Tyrant thirsteth for his blood.
His Gaoler Whichcock arbitrarily
Heapeth upon him greater Tyranny.
Our deer-bought Freedom now's not worth a straw:
Let all men judg, when Whitchcock's will's a Law.

FINIS.
