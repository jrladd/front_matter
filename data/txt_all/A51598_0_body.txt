MY LORD,
I Present this ensuing Treatise to your Lordship as its proper Patron, to whom, by vertue of your great Trust (the greatest, doubtless, in this King∣dome) the management of his Majesty's Treasure, and improvement of his Reve∣nue, are most peculiarly committed.
The title of it (Englands Treasure by Forraign Trade) alone berpeaks your no∣tice,

the Argument, (being of so pub∣lick a nature) may invite your perusall but the Tract it self will, I hope, deserve your Lordships Protection. It was left me in the nature of a Legacy by my Fa∣ther, for whose sake I cannot but value it as one of my best Moveables, and as such I dedicate it to your Lordship.
He was in his time famous amongst Merchants, and well known to most men of business, for his general Experience in Affairs, and notable Insight into Trade; neither was he less observed for his Inte∣grity to his Prince, and Zeal to the Com∣mon-wealth: the serious Discourses of such men are commonly not unprofita∣ble.
To your Lordships judgement I sub∣mit this Treatise, and my presumpti∣on herein to your Pardon.
My Lord,
