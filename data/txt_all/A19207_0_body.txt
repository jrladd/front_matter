RIght worshipfull Sir, it may seeme a point of great presumption in me, to cō∣mende into your protection, this small booke, beeing another mans labour, and yet (notwithstanding) the first fruites of my poore Presse, sithens the comming in of this newe yeare: but these few thinges, being duely cōsidered, may (I trust) deliuer me from the blemish and suspect therof: One thing is, the absence of the Author, who (not only) deliuered the Copye hereof vnto mee to be printed, but (also) committed the dedication of it to bee disposed (by me) to my best liking: Another cause is, the wittie con∣veighances, handled in the woike: but (principally) the heartie affection and duetifull good will, that I beare to your worship, with an (assured) hope, that you will ac∣cept it in as good parte as my faithfull meaning is to∣wardes you: For (sometimes) a prettie Conceight, well contryued, may content a wise mans minde, no lesse thē
a graue and great booke: Yea, (otherwhiles) a seely Sub∣iet, applyed to good purpose, is not (onely) acceptable, but (also) commendable: A litle flower, if it haue a good scent, is worthie smelling: a litle stone, if it bee precious, and (therwithall) well set, deserueth to be worne: a poore Pamphlet, if it tende to some good effect, may (haply) at some conuenient time, be worth the reading: I beseech you (therfore) giue a poore Welwiller leaue to present your worship with this small Collection out of dyuers notable workes, to the helpe and profit of many English Readers: & not any thing hurtful to the learned, in other lāguages: and (although) the Phrase do not (fully) satisfie the Curious, it will (I hope) sufficiently delight and con∣tent the wise: for the further contents whereof, I referre your worshippe to the Authors Epistle, and then to the worke it self: most humbly praying your worship to re∣ceiue the same into your protection and Patronage, as an infallible token of my good will towardes you, and to continue the iust defender thereof, against the scornefull crewe of MOMVS, his backbytinge Mates, to whome, all good thinges, are (continually) in contempt: And I shall (dayly) praye vnto God, for your worship, longe to continue in health, to the pleasure of Almightie God, and the great desire of all your Welwillers.
