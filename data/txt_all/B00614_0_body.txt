NOw at length (Right honourable) our Simonides hath finisht his Journey, he hath visited Rome, seen Na∣ples, beheld Athens, sailed into Englande, ouer vewed bothe Court and Countrey, and in conclusion re∣turned into Ciuill.
Amongst his cheefest freendes, J as one priuie to his conceiptes, haue determined the publishyng of his trauailes, and dedicated them vnder your honourable protection: Maie it please you to sha∣dowe them from contempt, since they are not alto∣gether vnnecessary, for in this cause (with Mar∣cus Cato) I would not sticke to stand to the iudge∣ment of my most deprauer Titus Gracchius. J
 haue auoyded lasciuiousnesse, yet enterlaced plea∣sure, discoursed of serious matters not pretermit∣tyng measurable mirth, and like a cunnyng Pain∣ter, affordyng euery shape his shadowe, I haue fi∣nished this counterfeite of a Louer, in all propor∣tions, of a Trauailer and his successe: wishing eue∣ry dramme of pleasure an vnce, and euery light motion that fitteth your honourable fantasie, a continued dilatation of rethoricall eloquence. Thus leauing my self and that J present to your honours censure, J rest.
