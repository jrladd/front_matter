MY LORD,
IT may seem a Paradox, though it be true, that this Communion Sermon was preach'd in a small Congregation, viz. the Chappel in Serjeants-Inne in Fleet-street; yet to a great and grave Auditory, for the reverend Judges, and Serjeants at Law, were pleas'd there to honour me with their attention and approbation. And as it is the onely staffe of my age, and cheif comfort of my life, that I am a servant to the truely Honorable Societies of the Temple, of which the said Judges and Serjeants not long since were a considerable part: so that I might not die altogether a stranger to your Lordship (whom all knowing men look upon as the Quintessence, and highest Extraction of those noble Societies) I have assumed the confidence (being over∣entreated to print this Sermon) to recommend herein
 to your Lordship a Physician, in whose care and custody you may safely venture both body and soul; in which respect as he is every way worthy of your Lordships cordial entertainment: so my hope is that Your accu∣stomed goodness will not onely pardon this presumption in one, whose yet suffering condition can give no better evidence, and assurance of his reall reverence, and sincere desire to serve Your Lordship: but also freely permit him to publish this peice of devotion under your Lordships name unto the people: for your native Can∣dour, and supernatural Clemency, have made you (as the Historian stiles Titus) their darling and de∣light: Among whom not onely your Lordships counte∣nance, but connivance is enough to candy any person, or action; and to gain them both authority and acceptation. Your Lordships infallible prudence in counselling, and irresistible power in perswading out-shine all humane presidents; and whosoever would now advance himself like an Oratour, he must first sit a while in silence at Your Lordships feet, and learn of you (who are onely able) to speak with as much grace, and gravity, as both Nestor, and Gamaliel. His Sacred Majesty (who is under God the fountain of honour) could not possibly do himself more right, then by advancing you; who are observ'd to discharge the high and weighty place of Lord Chancellour, with so much ability, and satisfaction, that the Dignity it self is preferr'd in be∣ing conferr'd upon Your Lordship; all whose Injunctions, and Decrees, are temper'd not onely Ad Justitiam, but Ad pondus aequale: so that though but one side can prevaile, yet the other hath not the least colour to com∣plain
 of any thing but the demerits of his Cause. And howe're the incredible extent, and irreparable expence of some Suites in Chancery have formerly turn'd both parts into Plaintiffs at last, when though one seem'd to get the better, yet in truth both were worsted: yet now Your Lordships integrity and dexterity in determi∣ning causes, render all Commencers in that Honorable Court, as happy as any that go to Law (which is a kind of waging war) can in reason hope to be, Cita mors, aut Victoria laeta. We need no other argu∣ments to prove, or inducements to believe, that His Sacred Majesty hath at this day that extraordinary gift, which the Apostle call'd, The Spirit of discer∣ning; but onely this, that he singled out Your Lordship as One fit, and worthy to be nearest Himself. If Mo∣ses in his time had been bless'd with such a Counsellor, sure Jethro would never have diminish'd his Greatness by Advising him to call in so many Assistants. Your Lordships wisdome is sole-sufficient to govern the vast∣est Empire; which irrefragable truth no man can deny without the guilt and censure of gross ignorance, En∣vy, and heresie. And were we not generally ingrate∣full, if not stupid, we would professedly congratulate our own happiness in the accumulation of your Ho∣nours; and wish them in all respects as transcendent as your Merits. But though some others, (like the nine Leapers that were heal'd) return not thanks, yet for my part the Psalmist hath taught me to say, Good luck have you with your Honour: Ride on, till your christian progress centre in perfection: in order where∣unto you carry your self with so much sobriety, and
 sweetness, that those few who maligne your fortune, yet cannot but love your person; and all the rest think it their happiness to be commanded by your Lordship. In whom (as it is said of Daniel 5. 14.) the Spirit of the Holy Gods, light, and understanding, and excel∣lent wisdome is found: and consequently your Lordship deserves that Eulogie in the North, which the Queen of the South gave to Solomon himself; Happy are thy servants that stand alwayes in thy presence to hear thy wisdome: This is all the ambition of him, who here in all humility craves your Lordships patronage, and vow's himself
