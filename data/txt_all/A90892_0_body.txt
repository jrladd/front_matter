Worthy Sir,
SInce God (by divine Providence) has been pleased to exercise me, with many strange unparallel'd afflictions, which you (above all) have been privy too; and since your Favour and unmerited kindness (both as to external and internal things) hath been so fre∣quently and bountifully vouchsafed to me in my deplorable condition. I thought my self obliged to offer up the first Fruits of my Laborious Stu∣dies to your Patronage; humbly beging your Acceptance thereof: The ensuing work has been delivered (verbatim) in a Publique Audi∣tory, in London; it treats of Spiritual Desertions, with which I my self have been greatly exercised, so that what comes to the view of your Candid Eye, has been Operated and wrought by my own Experiences, and consequentially not so fully Fraught with Rhetorical Expressions. I might indeed have drest it in a more curious Garb, but that I affect plainness; only desiring it may be effectual for a publick Good: But however, my tender years (I hope) will Appologize for the homely Style and confused matter, and though it be so rag'd and unhandsome a Flow∣er, yet if any can but such sweetness and Spiritual benefit therefrom, my desire is accomplish'd. But lest I should exceed the limits of an E∣pistle, I only beg your continued Favour, and Subscribe my Self,
