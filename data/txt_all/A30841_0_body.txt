Madam,
THIS Tragedy of Queen Mary, tho' forbidden
the Stage, has acted its Part almost as publick;
particularly, your Grace has been acquainted
with its Misfortune, having done It the Honour to per∣use
it in Sheets, and because your Noble Father the Earl
of Peterborough (whose Name I shall never mention with∣out
my greatest Zeal and Respect) has vouchsaft me the
Charity, to protect it against it's Enemies, and to stand
betwixt his Royal Highness and them; the worst of
which, and indeed the only Persons in their Stations, to do
me such an Injury, I have cause to believe, were they that
took the same Course, and with as much Reason, to si∣lence
the Play of the Earl of Essex, which was the first that
got Them and Theirs Money and Reputation. I present it to
your Grace, with those few Alterations which his Royal
Highness, the best of Judges, was pleas'd to mark with
his own Hand, and I shou'd not have presum'd to put
it in Print, without following those most judicious A∣mendments,
with which He was pleas'd to consent to
the Acting of it; till the same evil Spirits, by them∣selves,
or others (for I have heard, it has been protested,
This Play shou'd never be Acted, if they cou'd hinder
it) in contradiction to his Royal Highness's Pleasure; be∣cause

it was in Favour to Me, incens'd the King
with a wrong Interpretation of the Scenes, or of the Story;
tho', I make no doubt, but his most Sacred Majesty,
by your Graces Means, when he considers what a pene∣trating
Loss it has been to an unfortunate and faithful Sub∣ject,
and shall look on it in Print, but he will soon per∣ceive
the Loyalty of the Writing, and be of the same
Opinion with his Royal Brother, in permitting it to be
Acted. And now, Madam, after I have told my own
pitiful Tale, I am afraid to approach your Grace, least
it should be thought Design in me, as most Dedications
to Persons of your high Rank are branded with, and that
Flattery is the side-Wind or Byas that carries them, tho'
about, the surest Way to their Aim; but I am of Opini∣on,
and the Thought of it, has embolden'd Me, that it
is Prophaneness, to think Nobility and Graces like Yours,
are of that Allay, which either can, or will be flatter'd;
for who dares imagine, when I am to speak to the Dutchess
of Norfolk (the next of Quality to the Royal Family, in
the three Kingdoms) that I can say enough of her admired
Character? You are joyn'd by Heaven, to a Prince, who is
the true Inheritor of all the Virtues and Greatness, as
well as the Blood of that Illustrious Duke, the Hero in
the Play; to say more, in whose Praise, is to repeat his
Character, that I have fill'd all the Scenes with; I will on∣ly
add this observation; Never Man was more brave, nor
more unfortunate, unhappy, that he dy'd for his Loyal∣ty,
his Truth, and succouring the distrest, and happy
that he will have the Glory of it to Eternity; but to com∣pleat
his Joys, looks down from Heaven, and sees You in
his Princely Off-springs Arms, a Reward, that only can
exceed his Injuries; since from those chast Embraces, he
hopes will proceed a Race of Successors, that will make

the noblest and best of Houses flourish, whilst the Stars
shine, or the World lasts. You are such an early Patro∣ness
of Wit, that like young Alexander, you travell'd o're,
and conquer'd all that rare World, sooner, and in a lesser
time, than others have learn'd their Mother Tongue, as if
it were inspir'd, not study'd; and as Heaven, tho' it be
Heaven, wou'd not be admir'd, nor perspicuous to Mens
Eyes, unless the Sun were in it, to attract the Sight; so
the Divine Power has given you so many excellent Beau∣ties
to adorn your other Parts, that whosoever sees so
glorious a Fabrick without, may be sure to find a richer
Furniture within; You are the only Person too, who
having so large a Portion of both, yet envy not the En∣joyment
of them in others. Hail then Monarchess of
Wit and Beauty! (For all that have, or pretend to either,
are your Subjects) be pleas'd to accept of this Poem, it is
your Tribute, and though it be mean, 'tis like the poor
Womans Mite, It is my All, and best of Essays in this
Kind; yet, were it sure to survive as many years as Homers
Works, your Graces Name prefixt, will be the only Soul
that's moving in it, or can make the Pages deathless. I
dare say no more, for fear I shou'd commit more Faults,
but humbly beg leave to withdraw as Pilgrims from their
Shrine, to make a zealous and constant Repetition of this
to my self in private, with my Prayers for your eternal
Happiness, which shall ever be the Theme and Wishes of,
Madam,
