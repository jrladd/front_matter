VVHen subjects bring
presents to their
Princes, 'tis not
because their Prin∣ces
want them; but that subjects want
better waies to expresse the bounty of
their unknowne affections; I know
your Highnesse wants not the best
meanes that all the world affords, to
ground and perfect you in all those
Princely Qualities, which befit the
hopefull Sonne of such a royall Father;
yet the boldnesse of my zeale is such,
that nothing can call back mine arme,
or stay the progresse of my Quill, whose
emulous desire comes short of none in
the expressions of most loyall and un∣ign'd
affection. To which end, I have

presum'd to consecrate these few lines
to your illustrious Name, as Rudi∣ments
to ripen (and they will ripen)
with your growing youth, if they but
feel the Sunshine of your gracious eye.
My service in this subject were much
too early for your Princely view, did
not your apprehension as much trans∣cend
the greenesse of your years; the
forwardnesse of whose Spring thrusts
forth these hasty leaves, Your High∣nesse
is the expectation of the present
Age, and the point of future Hopes:
and cursed be he that both with Pen
and Prayers shall not be studious to
advantage such a high priz'd Bles∣sing:
Live long our Prince: And
when your royall Father shall convert
his Regall Diademe into a Crown of
Glory, inherit his Vertues with his
Throne and prove another Phoenix
to succeeding Generations: So
