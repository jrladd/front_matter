My Lord,
IF great Examples did not support
it, the dignity and greatness of
your Person would soon have gi∣ven
cheque to this presumption:
But since Emperours and Kings
have not only gratefully accept∣ed
Works of this nature, but ho∣nor'd
them likewise with their
own sacred hands, that Name of
yours, (which ought indeed never to appear but on In∣struments
of State and fronts of Marble, consecrating
your Wisdom and Vertues to Eternity) will be no way
lessen'd by giving Patronage to these appendant Rusti∣cities.
It is from the Protection and Cherishment of
such as your Lordship is, that these Endeavours of ours
may hope one day to succeed and be prosperous. The
noblest and most useful Structures have laid their
Foundations in the Earth: if that prove firm here (and
firm I pronounce it to be, if your Lordship favour it)
We shall go on and flourish. I speak now in relation to
the Royal Society, not my self, who am but a Servant of it
only, and a Pioner in the Works. But be its fate what it will,
Your Lordship, who is a Builder, and a lover of all Mag∣nificences,
cannot be displeas'd at these agreeable Acces∣sories

of Planting, and of Gard'ning. But, my Lord, I
pretend by it yet some farther service to the State than
that of meerly profit, if in contributing to your diver∣tisement
I provide for the Publick health, which is so pre∣cious
and necessary to it in your excellent Person.
Vouchsafe POMONA your Lordships hand to kiss,
and the humble Presenter of these Papers the honour of be∣ing
esteem'd,
My Lord,
