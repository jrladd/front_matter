Right Honourable,
WHen I had fi∣nished
this
short Tra∣ctate,
(which may
bee rather styl'd a

superficiall remem∣brance
then an essen∣tiall
expression of the
of the passages of
Queene Elizabeth's
Life in her minori∣tie:)
I could not ap∣prehend vnto whom
the Patronage there∣of
might more iustly
belong, then to your
Honour, whose no∣ble
Grandfather, Hen∣ry
Lord Hunsdon, after
Lord Chamberlaine to
her Maiestie (her
neere and deare Kins∣man:)
was the most

constant Friend and
faithfull Assistant in
all her troubles and
dangers, who not
onely imploy'd his
whole industry, and
made vse of his best
Friends: but liberally
expended his means,
& hazarded his owne
person as an Inter∣poser
betwixt her
safety, and the malice
of her potent aduer∣saries,
which makes
me somthing to wō∣der,
that so great and
remarkeable a zeale

exprest in a time of
such ineuitable dan∣ger,
when all Her
friends were held the
Queene her Sisters e∣nemies;
and her e∣nemies,
the Queenes
friends; when no∣thing
but Examinati∣ons,
sentences of Im∣prisonment,
and ter∣rours
of Death were
thundred against her;
that her (I say) whom
neither promises of
fauor could disswade
from her Loue, nor
threatnings of death,

deterre from her Ser∣uice,
should not bee
so much as once re∣membred
by the Col∣lectors
of Her Histo∣ry:
Be this therefore
(Right Honourable)
a lasting Testimony
of his unchanged af∣fection
to her and her
Innocence from the
beginning, as like∣wise,
a long-liu'd
Monument▪ of her
Royall gratitude to∣wards
him, extended
euen vnto his end,
nd to his noble Issue

after him: what great
confidence shee had
in his loyalty appea∣red,
at the Campe of
Tilbury in the yeare
1588. where hee
solely cōmanded the
Guard for her Maie∣sties
owne Person,
which consisted of
Lances, Light-Horse,
and Foote, to the
number of 34050▪
It hath pleased your
Lordship to censure
fauourably of some
of my weak Labours
not long since pre∣sented

before you,
which the rather en∣couraged
mee, to
make a free tender
of this small peece of
service. In which if
my boldnesse should
beget the least distast
from you, I must flye
for refuge, to that
of the Poet Claudian.
—Leones,
Quae str auisse valent,
ea mox prostrata relin∣quunt.
Thus wishing to

you and to all your
Noble Family, not
onely the long fruiti∣on
of the blessings of
this life present; but
the eternall possession
of the loyes future, I
remaine your Lord∣ships,
