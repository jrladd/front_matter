I Scorne to flatter, and yee Reuerende Lords,
I know, as much abhorre a flattring name;
What in my power, this simple meane affords
I heere submit before your eyes the same.
I haue small Learning, yet I learne to frame
My VVill agreeing to my wandring Mind;
And yee graue Pillars of Religious fame,
The onlie Paternes of Pietie wee find:
How well is plant our Church, and what a kind,
Of Ciuill Order, Policie, and Peace,
VVee haue, since Heauens, your Office haue assign'd,
That Loue aboundes, and bloodie jarres they cease:
Mechanicke Artes, and Vertues doe increase:
The Crowne made stronger, by your Sprituall care;
Yee liue as Oracles, in our learned Greece,
And shine as Lampes, throughout this Land all where:
The stiffe-neck'd Rebelles, of Religion are
By you press'd downe, with vigilance but rueth;
So liue great Lightes, and of false VVolues beware,
Yee sound the Trumpets of Eternall Trueth:
And justlie are yee call'd to such an hight,
To helpe the VVeake, defend the poore mans Right:
So sacred Columnes of our chiefest VVeale,
I humblie heere bid your great VVorths farewell.
