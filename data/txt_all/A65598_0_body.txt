SIR!
AS your solid judgment in consultation, singu∣lar courtesie in conver∣sation, and other no∣ble endowments, have made you deservedly honored, and beloved of all that know you: so your particular bountie, favor and good will towards mee, hath obli∣ged mee to you in very great thank∣fulness and respect; and having an earnest desire, but no means otherwise to express my acknowledgment thereof,
I have presumed to present you with, this small Work; the rather for that I judged, you had a twofold right to it above any other; for at the first un∣dertaking it was chiefly intended for the use and benefit of som of your hopeful Off-spring; and also whilst it was doing, I was most encouraged by your constant and continued respect: if therefore upon trial it shall bee found beneficial to the Education of Youth, or otherwise (as I strongly hope it may), Vouchsafe that it may live under the shelter of your favorable protection. But however it bee estee∣med, let your deserved good name and honor still encreas more and more; which is and shall bee the constant Vote of, Sir,
