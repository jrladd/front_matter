To the Divine Majesty of the only begotten, eternall, well beloved Son of God, and Saviour of the world, Christ Jesus, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the Ma∣ker, the Mender, the Sear∣cher, and the Teacher of the HEART:
The meanest of his most unwor∣thy Servants offers up this poor account of his Thoughts, humbly begging pardon for all that is amiss in them, and a gracious acceptance of these weak Endeavours for the ad∣vancement of his Honour in the good of others.
