HAuyng re∣course of late (right reue∣rend father) to y• olde stu∣dies, yt I once applied in ye vniuersitie: and getting sōme frute of quiet life to the perusing, and recording of those things, wherwith in time past I felt myself greatly both delited, and fur∣dered: I gaue my minde chiefly to such kinde of lerning: as wold serue best bothe to the order of my studie, & also to the gouernaūce of my life: so that comparing my experience, and reading togither, I might make my priuate diligence in studieng do ser

to the opē vse ofliuing. In folo∣wing of which intent, what by incre ase of iudgement for yeres, what by trauatlīg abrode in y• world, I foūde euer more and more so new profits, & commodities: y• wheras, methought, I had seene but y• shadow of thinges, now I begin more to see (as it wer) the holle bodie therof. And moste of all, this proofe I haue, in y• greatest and moste profitable parte of philo∣sophie, which is cōcerning maners: and namely in the bokes, that of du∣ties be written, by Marcus Tullius Cicero: a mater conteining the holle trade, how to liue among men dis∣creetly, and honestly: and so rightly pointing oute the pathwaye to all vertue: as none can be righter, onely Scripture excepted. Insomuch, that when I had well considerd alltogi∣ther: I saide with miself, concerning this, as did a certein lerned mā, not long ago, by Homer: This is the fift time, I haue redde ouer this author: and as oft as I reade him, so oft som∣what I finde, that I marked not be∣fore: and that hath neede to be deeply pondered: so yt I fansied, at the first,

he was easie: but now, methinks, he requires a verie heedfull, & a musing reader. Wherfore, not without mar∣uailous greate pleasure, espyeng: y• either in priuate life, to attein quiet∣nesse, and contentation: or in office∣bearing, to winne fame, & honour: or in euerie estate, bothe to auoyde disorder, and enormitie, and also to keepe a right rule, & commēdable be∣hauiour: this boke playnly is y• myr∣rour of wisdom, y• fortres of iustice, the master of manlinesse, the schoole of temperance, the iewell of cōmeli∣nesse: I wisshed, many mo to be par∣teners of such sweetnesse, as I had partly felt myself: & to declare, that I mēt nolesse, thā I wisshed: I laied to, my helping hand: endeuouring, by translation, to do likewise for my contriemēne: as Italiās, Frēchmē, Spaniardes, Dutchmē, & other fo∣reins haue liberally done for theyrs. So, chiefly for our vnlatined people I haue made this latine writer, eng∣lish: & haue now brought into light, y• from them so longe was hidden: & haue caused an aunciēt wryting to beecōme, in a maner, newe agayne:

and a boke, vsed but of fewe, to war cōmon to a great meany: so that our mē, vnderstāding, what atreasure is amonge them, for the fashioning of their life: and beeing by nature most of all other nations giuē to ciuilitie, & humanitie: whē thei shall be aided, & directed by these perfite precepts: may, in all pointes of good demea∣nour, becōme people perelesse.
Yet iudge I all this labour litle∣worthe, & smally, or nothing able to preuaile: withoute your honorable lordship were patrone herof: to whō I do dedicate bothe my good hert, & my worke also: (I call it mine, as Plautus, and Terence called the comedies theyrs, which they made oute of Greeke) not as to teache your lordshipp ought, that you haue not allredy: but by your authoritie, to gett it the more estimacion wt other. For as Tullies treatise, beeing so full of lerning, asketh alerned mans iudgement: which whoso refuse, thei showe themselues to be vnwise: euē so such a noble Coūseler of Englād seemeth most meete to receiue so no∣ble a Senatour of Rome into a

straunge region. Doutlesse among so many honorable deedes of your lordships, it shall not be the leste ho∣norable: if ye do Marcus Tullius this honour, to welcōme him hither: and to be the verie cause, that so fa∣mous a Romane may becomme fa∣miliar with our English men.
So shall a worthy pere be worthylie entreated: as very curtesie requireth: so your lordshipps iudgement must needes be well lyked: which is wōte to alow louely knowledge, & good∣nesse: so wyll the cōmon people more hyely esteeme the thing: as it is expe∣dient for them to do: and the soner also will they folow these hollsome lessons: which is full necessarie, in a well ordered state: to be short, your lordship, for a chosen patrone: my translation, for a welcome worke: & Tullie shall be takē for such a Tul∣lie, as he is. And like as Marc{us} Cice∣ro, wt the authoritie of a father, com∣mended these bokes to his yonge Ci∣cero: so whē our English youth shall beholde them once authorised by so reuerend a father in god: nodoute, they will be the rather in loue with

them: and will counte it pleasaunt paines taking, here to enriche them∣selues with enformations of vertue, ensaumples oute of stories, morall doctrine, politike prudēce, antiqui∣tie, varietie of maruailous maters: so conningly, & oratorially treated, and endited: as hee was able to de∣clare, & expresse: who was the first, and the chief, that euer cladde ladie Philosophie in Romane attire. Thus, verie lothe to let your lordship from your weighty affaires, I make an end: & praye god, longe to preserue your hono∣rable lordship in helth, with in∣crease of ho∣nour.
