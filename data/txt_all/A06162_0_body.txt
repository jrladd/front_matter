IT is not (noble Gentleman) the titles of
Honour that allureth me, nor the nobilitie
of your Parents that induceth me, but the
admiration of your vertues that perswa∣deth
me, to publish my pore trauailes vn∣der
your vndoubted protection. Whom I
most humbly intreate, not onely in so iust a cause to pro∣tect
me, but also in these Primordia of my studies, after
the accustomed prudence of the Philosophers, to con∣firme
with fauourable acceptaunce, and continuaunce as
the equitie of the cause requireth. I haue set downe in
these fewe lines in my opinion (Right Worshipfull) the
image of a licentious Vsurer, and the collusions of diue∣lish
incrochers, and herevnto was I led by two reasons:
First, that the offender seeing his owne counterfaite in
this Mirrour; might amend it, and those who are like
by ouerlauish profusenesse, to become meate for their
mouths, might be warned by this caueat to shunne the
Scorpion ere she deuoureth.
May it please your Worshippe, to fauour my
trauailes, and to accept my good will: who incouraged
by the successe of this my firstlings will heereafter in
most humble signe of humanitie continue the pur∣pose
I haue begunne, commending the cause
and my seruice to your good liking: who
no doubt compassed with incompe∣rable
vertues, will commend
when you see occasion, &
not condemne with∣out
a cause.
