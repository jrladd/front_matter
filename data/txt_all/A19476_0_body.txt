AFTER long deliberation, I hardly indu∣ced my selfe to craue your gracious prote∣ction toward this simple worke: valewing it at so lowe a price, as I thinke it hardly woorth the respect of any graue man, much lesse the fauourable aspect of so honorable a personage. Yet the remembrance of those your fatherly prouocations, whereby; at my comming to your Grace from the Vniuersitie, you first put me vpon these studies, at the last by a kind of necessitie inforced me to this attempt: because I could not see how well to auoide it, but by aduenturing the hatefull note of vnthankfulnesse. For I cannot without dissimulation, but confesse my selfe perswaded, that this poore Pamphlet may proue profitable to the young Students of both Lawes, to whose aduancement that way, I haue of late addi∣cted mine indeuours: else were I more then madde to offer it to the world: and to offer it without mention of him, that by occasioning of this good, more or lesse, deserueth the prime thankes, were to proue my selfe vnworthie of so graue advice.
And therefore howsoeuer I accompt this too much boldnesse in respect of the subiect yet could I be exceedingly glad, it might please your Grace to ascribe mine intention to the integrity of my duty. For he that meaneth truly wel, & cannot perform much: must

needes reioyce at the good acceptance of that litle which he er∣formeth.
All I craue for  at your Graces hands, is patience and par∣don for this enterprise, with the continuance of those your many fauours, that hitherto to inygreat comfort I haue enioyed. And so my long obseruation of your iudicious disposition, hauing caught me, what small delight you take in affected complements and verball commendation, without more words, in all true hum∣blenes, I beseech the Almighty long to continue your Grace in health and prospetitie, to his glorie, and the good of his Church.
