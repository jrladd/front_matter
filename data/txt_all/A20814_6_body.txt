SIR, amongst many which most deseruedly loue you, though I the least, yet am loth to be the last, whose en∣deuours may make knowne how highly they esteeme of your noble and kinde disposition: let this Epistle Sir (I beseech you) which vnwoorthily weares the Badge of your woorthy name, acknowledge my zeale with the rest, (though much lesse deseruing) which for your sake doe ho∣nour the house of the Mounsons. I knowe true generositie accepteth what is zelously offered, though not euer deser∣uingly excellent, yet for loue of the Art from whence it re∣ceiueth resemblance. The light Phrigian harmony stirreth delight, as well as the melancholy Doricke moueth passion: both haue their motion in the spirit, as the lyking of the soule moueth the affection. Your kinde acceptance of my labour, shall giue some life to my Muse, which yet houers in the vncertaintie of the generall censure.
