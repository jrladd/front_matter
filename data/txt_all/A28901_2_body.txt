Right Worshipful,
THat Honorable respect I did receive above twen∣ty years since as a Mi∣nister of Christ, from your Re∣ligious
 Mother, the Right Honor∣able the late Countesse of Devon∣shire; and the more ancient re∣lation I had unto your now Reli∣gious Lady, as living divers years in house with her and her former Husband Sir Samuel Tryon (my Honoured Patron) with the due respects I owe to Sir Samuel Tryon their Son, and his Vertuous Lady; together with kindenesse from your self, may command a publike acknowledge∣ment of all your private favours. And since the Lord hath now en∣abled me after two years study and labour at times extraordinary, almost spared from my necessary sleep (rising up early and late taking rest) to finish this Light
 from Christ, by way of Cate∣chism, which as it concerneth the general, I have Dedicated to those Honoured Worthyes in more pub∣like places: And do humbly desire every of you also to accept of it, as a Light from Christ, a help for you and yours better acquaintance with God in your Families in pri∣vate, and your closets in secret, that you and yours may be the better en∣abled to meet Christ with comfort in his Ordinances, and to walk joy∣fully with Christ in every con∣dition in the whole course of your lives: And for this end, I com∣mend this excellent duty of Cate∣chizing in and by your worthy Names, to all the Gentry, with their and all others Families in the King∣dom;
 particularly in the County of Northampton, my Native country,Now Pa∣stor of East-had∣don: where my Reverend Aged Father hath been a Preacher and Catechizer almost this fifty years, and in the County of Derby, and Parish of Ashover, where by the free love of my Noble Patron afore∣said, I was placed, and did finde both the want and benefit of Catechizing by good experience; that they and e∣very of you, making your Calling and Election sure, you may gain a sweet entrance here, and in the end a full possession and fruition of that everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: which to further, is the earnest de∣sire and endeavour of
