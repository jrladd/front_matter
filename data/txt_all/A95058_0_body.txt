IT hath pleased God of his infinite goodnesse, to grant to us a glorious and happy Victory in gaining of this Town, without any conside∣rable Losse; for which we have all great cause to praise God, and to acknowledge his mercies, even to outreach our very expectati∣ons; For I must confesse ingeniously, that I have never seen any Town all my Life-time kept and defended with greater resolution, continuing in a most constant obstinacy, till the very last; and Gods Providence appeare more in animating of our Officers and Souldi∣ers in generall, against so hard oppositions and difficulties. The particulars of what lately past, your Lordship may be pleased to receive enclosed herewith, and to communicate the same with my Lord Crawford and the Com∣mittee of Estates. This much in haste, Irest
