THE World and Cities Joy, of God and Man
Beloved, thy Countreys dear Physitian.
When all the Earth doth Trophees to You raise,
Why should my Muse not trumpet out your praise?
Scotland of such a President doth boast,
Your deeds are Eccho'd round our British coast:
Amongst the Hero's you deserve to be
Ranck'd first, who first did conquer Tyranny,
When Lamberts Faction plagued us more and more,
You dockt the RUMP, and turn'd them out of dore:
Alas! we're headlong into discord hurl'd.
Pride, Anger, and Deceit inflames the World;
Whilst old sores bleed afresh, and rage abounds,
You (like Machaon) heal our gaping Wounds.
What man e're drew a Sword with such success?
Who is like you in worth and nobleness?
Great in your strength, and spirit, greater farre
In bold Attempts; who can with you compare?
In vain Phanatiques take up Armes, since you
Alone suffice their Armies to subdue.
I'm satisfied, if these lines may before
My Patron come; but houour'd if read o're.
Upon your Lordship, willingly I waite,
And thus my Countreys Genius dedicate.
If my poor Muse gain unexpected Bayes,
I'le render back to you alone the praise.
If these beginnings of our Poetry
(Written in hast) unto you pleasing be,
A Work remaines, wherein (against your will)
My Muse her salys shall at your Ocean fill.
With the whole world the Romans did contend,
Your right hand onely doth the Globe defend.
Fabius Cunctation did restore the Thing;
You bring us peace in bringing home the King.
Glory to God, to Caesar his due give,
To each his own, and your Fame long shall live.
From Bishop Wickhams Famous Colledge sent
These lines I to your Lordship do present.
