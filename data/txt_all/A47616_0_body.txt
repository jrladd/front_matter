May it please your Lordships,
ACcording to your honours directions, the
Scouts (which were sent into Eng∣land,
to discover the estate of things
there) came unto me their Intelligen∣cer
at London, who have collected
together all such observations, as they
in their severall travels have found, or my selfe obser∣ved,
either in my owne aboad now two yeares at Lon∣don,
or in my returning home: But by reason of all

passages now shut up at sea, and all Land wayes belayd, I
was forced to put my selfe in Arminian Attire, and so
came home through England, and so remayned some
certaine time in the Campe Royall, where my Collections
may manifest my love to my Countrey, and care of the
trust by your Lordships imposed upon me. But if my ob∣servations
be not answerable to your Lordships expectati∣ons,
I am heartily sorry: Yet, yee may see, I have not bin
altogether idle, nor will be more carelesse hereafter (as
occasion is offered) then formerly I have beene, and shall in
my Northern newes (which is also now in collecting) make
good what is omitted, and in confidence of your favoura∣ble
acceptance hereof, I rest,
