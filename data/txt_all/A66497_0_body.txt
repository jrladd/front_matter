Worthy Sir,
THE Inspection of Ʋrines, and from them an investigation of directions concerning the Medicinal practice, began to be esteem∣ed among the Ancients, even from the first beginning of Medi∣cine: for from hence for the making of judgments concerning the Sick, and for the chusing the most fit times for Curing, the great Hippocrates hath chiefly taken both his praenotions, and his precepts, so that that famous and to this day approved statute of old Medicine, to wit, , to compose Medicine according to digestions, cannot be observ∣ed without rightly consulting the Ʋrinal. Also this seems consonant to com∣mon reason, that for as much as we cannot search into the most intimate parts of the sick Body, as it were a Vessel shut up, judgment is sought from the in∣fused liquor, washing all its parts, and taking from many some little parcels. For neither more certainly do the acidulous or Spaw-waters, shew the nature of the hidden Mine, through which they are strained, than Ʋrines give testi∣fication of the divers manners of dyscrasies of our Bodies, and their habitudes. Wherefore the Contemplation of this Excrement, (as vile as it is) hath grown to a Science, and hath exercised the ingenuities of the most excellent Physi∣cians, both Ancient and Modern. Concerning this thing there are many Books extant, writ with great diligence; in which are rehearsed the great dif∣ferences of Ʋrines, varieties of Colours, and diversities of Consistence, and their Contents exactly described, and distinct precepts are delivered for every excre∣tion of them: Which indeed are esteemed by some of so great certitude, that from the inspection of the water, a signification is sought of any Disease, or of the part affected; yea of every accident concerning the sick. But in this the common people are egregiously deceived, and still pertinaciously will be de∣ceived, whilst they imagine the knowledg of every Disease, and the prognosti∣cation of it cannot be found out, but by inspecting the Ʋrine; and esteem a Physician of little worth unless he undertakes to divine from the Ʋrinal as from a Magical Glass. But indeed, as to what belongs to the precepts, and rules, whereon the reason of Judgment by Ʋrine doth depend, there are many col∣lected by diligent observation, that are extant, and from thence establish'd with good reason and judgment: yet for as much as the signification of Ʋrines is by some too largely extended to particular Cases, very many uncertain things interwoven, and some obnoxious to deceit, and others plainly false; therefore who shall confidently pronounce concerning the business of the Sick, by the judg∣ment only of the Water, deserves rather the name of a jugling Quack, than of a Physician.

But this Doctrine concerning Ʋrines, abounds so ordinarily with errors, that the observations which belong to its practice, are either wrongfully made, or not well reduced into method. We may lawfully suspect that the observations are not rightly made, because, perhaps from one or two particular cases, often∣times a general Rule is established. For Example sake, because some Hydro∣pical people render a thin and watery Ʋrine, therefore it is affirmed, such sort of Ʋrines necessarily denote a Dropsie, when also in some other diseases, such like Ʋrines are made; and sometimes in the Dropsie, the Ʋrine are thick, and full of redness. Also as it is most commonly received, that Ʋrines on which a cream doth swim (as on water that hath Tartar boyled in it) doth de∣note a Consumption, which is most uncertain, because this sign is more proper and familiar to Hypochondriacks, than to Consumptive people: And how many dye of Consumptions, without this? Besides, what is generally asserted, to wit, that in all diseases whatsoever, Nature doth make known the Disease by the Ʋrine, is altogether false; because sometimes sick people make their Ʋrine like healthful people; and sometimes those who are very well in health, by reason of some accident (perhaps from the meats eaten) have suspected Ʋrine, varying from the natural state or condition. As to what belongs to the method, or doctrine delivered by most, concerning Ʋrines, they seem to be altogether Em∣pirical, and nothing rational: for the naked differences of Ʋrines are rehears∣ed, and are wont to be distinguished according to their colour, consistency, and contents: thence are opposed to the several species of these pathologick significa∣tions, collected only from more rare observations; when in the mean time, the causes of the appearances, nor of the preternatural alterations in the Ʋrines, are not assigned, as they ought to be; nor is the signification of the Ʋrines ap∣plyed to the Causes of diseases, but only to the Disease or Symptom; and there∣fore it is most often deceitful, and uncertain; because the same morbifick Cause, and signification of the same Ʋrine, may in like manner mediately respect at once divers Diseases, and Symptoms. As for Example, a thin and watry Ʋrine most often immediately denotes Indigestion, or a defect of Concoction in the Viscera: nevertheless, by reason of that condition of Crudity, the Green-sick∣ness in Virgins, sometimes the Dropsie, or the white watery phlegmacy, some∣times Head-aches, and many other diseases arise. But the task which you have required of me, Worthy Sir, to wit, That the notions which in times past we have discoursed together, and conceived concerning Ʋrines, as it were col∣lected notes, and what have since fallen under my own knowledg, by my proper study and observation, concerning this thing, should be fram'd into a little Treatise, and that I should write a plain, and new method of Ʋrinoscopie. I confess the work greater than can well be performed by our own proper strength: however, I have resolved as much as I am able, to obey you therein. But that a doctrine or method concerning Ʋrines may be instituted, beyond the vulgar and plainly Empirical manner of Philosophising, there shall be these two heads of our Discourse. To wit, First that the Anatomy of Ʋrine may be delivered, of what elements and parts it consists; and also its genesis in our Body; to wit, by what Concoction this kind of Liquor is made, and then by what secretion of some Particles from others. Secondly, That the inspection of urines in the Ʋrinal may be truly unfolded, and what may be the Rules, and the Certitude of Ʋromancie, or divination of the Ʋrine.
