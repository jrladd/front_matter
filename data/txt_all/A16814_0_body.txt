YOur affection to all good spirits, and mine the worst of many, hath made me preferre your knowne kindne, before the shadow of idle showes a Scholler I holde you none; but I know you vnderstand English, and can conceipt an honest meaning, better then a braine full of more bu∣sines: and therefore in my loue, haue giuen you this fruite of my thoughts labours: In which, since Diuinitie is too deepe, Vertue will not ell; Law is cost∣ie, and Poetrie is too common; Histories are tedious, State matters are too high, and loue is growne a laughing iest▪  haue thought good (leauing all idle humours) to all only vpon a few wonders: In the discourse whereof (I doubt not) but you shall finde a little glimmering of the light of my better loue: To the assurance whereof, without fraude or further delay, I haue heere unto set downe my name, thi 22. of December. 1602
