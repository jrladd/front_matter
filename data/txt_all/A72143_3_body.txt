GOOD MADAME,
IT is a point by all generally agreed upon, that. Aristot. ethic. Nicom. l. 1. c. 2, 4, 7. . Stob. tom. 1. l. 2. c. 3. Happinesse is the maine end and aime of all mens Actions. And it is a Truth no lesse generally confessed and acknowledged, that. Arist. ethic. Nicom. l. 1. c. 7. Non est beatus, esse se qui non putat. P. Syr. Si cui sua non videntur amplissi∣ma, miser est. Epicur. Miser est, qui se non beatissimum judicat. Sen. ep. 10. Nemo foelix est, qui judicio suo mi∣ser est. Salv. de prov. l. 1. Without Contentment of Minde there can be no true Happines. It isOmnium certa sen∣tentia est, beatos esse omnes homines velle. Aug. de civ. Dei l. 10 c. 1. & Epist. 21. & 121. Miserè vivere nemo vult. Idem de lib. arb. l. 1. c. 14. Hap∣pines then that all men without exception desire, and Contentment that all consequently strive to attaine. But herein the most faile, that they are mistaken in the meanes, that they take wrong courses for the compassing of this their end and aime, and so vainly weary and tire out themselves in. Arrian. dissert. l. 2. c. 16. seeking Happines and Contentment there, where neither of them is to be had. To reforme this error, the Spirit of God in the Word hath directed us the right way to either; to wit,Psal. 86.11. & 144.14. by conjunction with God, the author & fountaine of all good,Deut. 30.20. Psal. 73.26, 28. Bonum nostrum nullum est aliud qm Deo adhaerere, cujus unius anima intellectualis incorporeo amplexu impletur. Aug. de civt. Dei l. 10. c. 4. by adhering unto him, in whom only the soule of man can find sure and sound contentment. Now this is doneDeut. 30.20. Adeum dilectione tendimus, ut perveniendo quiescamus, ideò beati, quia illo fine persecti. Aug. ibid. by loving him,Psal. 112.1. & 128.1. Deut. 10.0. & 5.29. & 6.24. Eccles. 12.13. by fearing him,Psal. 73.28. & 84.12. by trusting in him,Deut. 11.27. & 30 20. . Stob. tom. 2. c. 2. by obeying him,Matth. 5.48. 1 Ioh. 3.3.  statuunt Pythagoras, Socra∣te Plato. Stob. tom. 1. l. 2. c. 3. by conformitie unto him; or more briefly in a word, byLevit. 11.44 & 19.2 & 20.7. 1 Pet. 1.11. holinesse, by1 Tim. 4.8. godlinesse: for these two are in substance one and the same.
 So that there is. Menand. no compassing of Contentment or Happinesse without God, and there is no way unto God but by Godlinesse. ForNutat omne consili∣um, nec implere nos ul∣la soelicitas potest, do∣nec pervenerimus ad bonum illud immensum & insuperabile, ubi ne∣cesse est resistat volun∣tas nostra, quia ultra summum non est locus. Sen. epist. 74. God alone being the chiefest good, and the chiefest good each ones utmost aime; our desires cannot be stayed till we come home unto him, beyond whom wee cannot possibly go. Hee being onlyGen. 17.1. Nec nisi beatitudine animae in∣digentia expletur: nec eidem explendae, nisi Deus, sufficit. Aug. de civ. l. 12. c. 1. All-sufficient; (and there can be no Contentment where any want is, nor freedome from want where Sufficiencie is not;) we can have no true Contentment, till we have once gained Him; we can have no full Contentment, till we come wholly to enjoy Him, that he may be1 Cor. 15.28. all in all unto us. And this beingNecesse est ut homo inde beatus fit, unde fit bonus. Aug. ep. 121. by Holinesse, by Godlinesse only effected, it must needs follow, that the holier men are, the happier they are; and the more Godly they are, the more true and sound Contentment they are sure of.Apoc. 20.6. Psal 119.1. Matth. 5.8. Wee shall never be truly Happy, till we be sincerely Holy, nor fully Happy, till we be perfectly Holy. We shall never attaine true Contentment till wee be truly Religious, nor full Content∣ment till wee be consummate in Godlinesse. The consideration whereof should encite all, that desire Happinesse and Content∣ment, (andVitam beatam om∣nem hominem mods omnibus velle quis du∣bitat? Aug. de lib. arb. lib. 1. c. 14. Beatitudi∣nem nemo est qui non expetat. quis enim vel potest, vel potuit, vel poterit inveniri, qui esse nolit beatus? Aug. in Psal. 118. conc. 1. who is he, be he never so brutish, that doth not?) to bend their maine study and endevour this way, for the compassing of this Grace and profiting in it; as the only meanes availeable to bring them to that end;Omnes beatitudinem concupiscunt: sed quo∣modò ad eam pervenia∣tur, plurimi nesciunt. Idem ibid. which, howsoever they may wander from, mistaking the way, their whole desire is to attaine unto. To provoke all sorts hereunto, is the maine project propounded in this present discourse. Which (what ever it be; and I wish it were much better;) I humbly present to your Ladiship, desiring that it may helpe to supply some part of that duty and service, which partly mine owne infirmitie and imbecillitie of body, and partly also other necessarie and unavoidable imployments, will not suffer me to performe answerably to mine owne desire, and mine Honourable Lords and your Ladiships desert. And so wi∣shing againe and againe unto your Ladiship, (for what other, or what better thing can I wish?) that which the worke it selfe importeth, true Contentment from God in this life, and full Contentment with God after this life; I take my leave for the present, but cease not to continue
