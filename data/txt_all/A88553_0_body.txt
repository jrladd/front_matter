Madam,
YOur Incomparable Beauty, and exemplary Vertue, so justly intitle you to the services of all those whose happinesse it is to know you, that your interest in this Dedi∣cation is rendred unquestionable; coming from him who may, without vanity, professe himselfe best acquainted with the Power of the one, & Sublimity of the other. Nor let any judge the concealment of your Name to proceed from other than the experience of your exact Modesty which declineth all publique applauds: together with a consci∣ousnesse

of the vast disproportion which this triviall Present beareth either to your Merit or my Duty. And for its subject, as being the History of the First of Men; it could not make a more proper, or more honourable, Addresse, than to the Best of Women: In which quality you shall ever be acknowledged and obsequiously admired by,
Madam,
