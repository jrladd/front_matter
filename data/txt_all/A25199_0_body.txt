Reverend in Christ,
VVEre I not assured that that Humility which dwels in your self could conde∣scend to stoop, and view the smallest good with propitious eyes, I durst not thus have tender'd this small Peice unto your gracious Aspect; but
 being confident of your great love to things though ne'r so low and weak, I am incouraged in this my mean address to appear (before your Lordship) and now what Iv'e writ and offer'd here, it is your Lordships due, and 'twere a sin almost as high as Sacriledge, to keep it back, I am obliged for ever to pay unto your self much more than ordinary thanks; It was you that sent me forth, and bid me teach: It was your hands by imposition warranted my Call; It was your Holy Prayers that called a blessing down on what you did, and what I undertook; of which then I found, and still do finde blessed effects. Now not to own so great a good as this, it were too evi∣dent I had forgot how to be good; but sure my right hand must forget it's Cunning, when I neglect to pay a due so duly just: I must confess my Offering is but small for what I then, and since received, to recompence it
 were imposible; but yet to make my poor indeavours in some sence to be owned, I must avow and will, this poor Work of mine appears with free∣ness from my heart, that well could wish it more, and better too he will indeavour, may this now be accep∣ted
