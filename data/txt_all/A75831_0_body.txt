MADAM,
THough your Ladi∣ship be already in the high road of Piety and Vertue, so that none need to shew you the way; yet these fol∣lowing Examples of the best of Wo∣men, and drawne out of the best
Records, will not, I presume, prove altogether superfluous; for they may confirm and encourage You in the same road: But hee who would counsel your Ladiship hereunto, must needs commend when hee counselleth, and by his Exhortations, approve of your actions; so I rest,
Madam,
