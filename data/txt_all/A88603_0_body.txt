MADAM,
THAT Time I stole from my more Airy Diversions, I de∣dicated to this little Piece, and tho my first design was not to have pub∣lished it, nor ever desired any Eyes to encounter it, but yours, and my own; yet for that Presumption I lay it at your Feet, and beg your Protection, with a Charitable En∣deavour to Peruse it with a partial Eye, and excuse the first Sallies of so unworthy a Pen; yet were I ca∣pable
of producing the most deserv∣ing Volume in the Universe, I should be Ambitious of no Nobler a Patroness: For it is not the sound of a great many Titles that I covet, which, oftentimes like a hectoring Bully, makes a great Noise, with little or no Courage; not that I de∣spise true Nobility, nor admire it farther then the Intrinsick Value.
I have nothing to plead for the Meanness of the Present, nor any Reasons for the many Objections you or any other may make, if you please to Criticise; only you have here the first Draught of sometimes a Pleasant, sometimes a Hypocon∣driack Brain, without ever rectify∣ing; yet my dear (Flavia) accept of this humble Offering from a Friend, and afford it the Reading; some leisure Hour after the soft Mes∣sage of your Lover's Sighs has been
whispered to your Ears, and experi∣mentally taught you, Love is not that Trifle to be ridicul'd at pleasure, but rather the most serious Business of our Lives; nor imagine it too fool∣ish a Subject to entertain you, but reflect on the Sallies of your own Heart, and after mature Examina∣tion, if you find that youthful Bo∣som incapable of a tender Impressi∣on, I will readily submit to the most rigid Principle of the morosest Sto∣ick; but pardon my Opinion, if I believe it impossible, and dare con∣fidently affirm, so much Vivacity, Wit, Fire, and Beauty cannot be incapable of an honourable Senti∣ment: This is a sort of Natural Philosophy, at least a Woman's Philosophy, the only Theme they can Write of; and all these diffe∣rent Passions are agitated by Love, Scorn, Jealousie, Anger and Resent∣ment, which if not display'd in their
true Colours, consider the Author, and force a Complaisance.
I would avoid all things in the common Rode of Flattery, there∣fore I shun a Character I could be very copious on, and only tell you, If this Trifle has but the Influence to effect a Smile from you, or the good Luck to disperse some melan∣cholly Cloud that would eclipse the Lustre of your Glorious Mind, I shall have the utmost of my Hopes, and esteem my self rewarded even to the height of my Lavish Wish.
I could say a great deal in Com∣mendation of Love, what Effects it has had over the profoundest Philo∣sophers, the most Judicious and Learned, even those who have most contemned that Passion, have been delivered up to the most sensible Touch of it; bring authentick Au∣thors
to prove as much; produce the wonderful Effects of it in these Days; but that is not my part, I ju∣stifie nothing, but leave it to your Mercy; and if you do afford it your favourable Protection, I shall be proud I had the Occasion to shew my Choice in a Person of such singular Virtues, such nice and refined Sentiments, such inestimable Me∣rits, and One whom ten thousand Advantages, besides that of Friend∣ship, induces me ever to Subscribe my self,
