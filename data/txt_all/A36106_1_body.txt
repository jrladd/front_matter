My Lord,
'TIs in Acknowledgement of the Fa∣vours your Lordship has conferr'd upon me, that I presume to place your Name before these Papers. The Honour∣able Person to whom I dedicated my for∣mer Volume could not have taken a more agreeable way to befriend me, than by recommending me to your Patronage; and I shall always retain a grateful sense of it: and your Lordship has been pleas'd to prefer me in a way suitable to my Genius

and Experience; and wherein therefore, if in any way, I may be able to do some∣thing toward the preserving the good Opi∣nion you have been pleased to entertain of me. 'Tis a further satisfaction to me that my Employment is of such a Nature, as does not alienate me from your Lord∣ships more peculiar Jurisdiction, but places me more immediately under it, and chiefly accountable to your self. What∣ever parts of the World I shall range into, I shall carry this comfort along with me, that next under the Providence of God, and his Majesty's Protection, I shall be so long as I am upon the Seas, in the Province, and under the Direction of your Lordship and the Honourable Board: for whose favours to me in general I have no better way of Expressing my Gratitude, than by doing it thus to your Lordship, who Presides there And with these Sentiments, I am bold to subscribe my self,
My Lord,
