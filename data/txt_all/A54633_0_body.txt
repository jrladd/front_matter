MY LORD,
THere have been Au∣thors of modern times, who have in their Writings, concerning the Government of this Kingdom, published

to the World, That the Commons of England (as now phrased) were no part of the antient Commune Conci∣lium, or Parliament of this Nation, before the forty ninth Year of H. 3. and then in∣troduced by Rebellion.
A Position when seriously weighed, equally wounds the Peerage of England, since the same Authors say, that there is no formal Summons of the Lords to Parliament, found upon Record before that time.
After I had often consi∣dered so great a point, and having often read of the

freedom of this Nation, that no Englishman could lose his right or property but by Law, the Life and Soul of this so famous and so excel∣lently constituted Govern∣ment, the best polity upon Earth (which when united in all its parts by prudent Coun∣cils, made always the people happy at home in Peace, and the Crown ever Victorious abroad in War) I did re∣solve to take pains to search, if matters thus represented to the highest disadvantage and prejudice of the people of Eng∣land, were true or false; which I have industriously and

impartially endeavoured, and hope with that clearness, that will evidence to all unbiassed judgments, the unsoundness of those Opinions.
When I had so done, be∣ing unwilling my labour should be to my self alone, and not to those who search after knowledge in these mat∣ters, to disabuse and pre∣vent others from building upon such mistaken and dangerous Foundations, I thought it not unseasonable to publish this Discourse, wherein there is no Record cited, but (in my opinion) equally asserts the right of

the Peers of this Kingdom, as well as of the Commons, and therefore have taken the boldness to send it in∣to the World under your Lordships Protection, whom I know to be a great Lover of Truth, To which all man∣kind ought to pay Allegiance. I should have had great satis∣faction, if before it had been put to the Press, it might have received your Lord∣ships judicious corrections and approbation, whose knowledge and industry in venerable Antiquity, and all other useful Learning, is well known unto the World.

But this happiness I could not reasonably expect, your Lordships time being so much taken up in the service of the Crown, whereof your Lordship is so eminent, and so great a Pillar, as your Honourable Imployments both at home and abroad, do sufficiently demonstrate. I most humbly beg your Lordships Pardon for my presumption in this Dedi∣cation, which fault I hope may be extenuated by the relation I have to your Lordship in my Profession, and being deprived of other means, publickly to shew

my humble gratitude for the many favours your Lord∣ship has been pleased to con∣fer upon,
My Lord,
