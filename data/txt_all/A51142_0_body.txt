Madam,
THe true zeale which you have for the maintenance of the Truth (together with those many favours which your Ladiship hath been pleased to bestow on me, my de∣ceased, and surviving friends) hath en∣couraged me, or rather inforced me to present this little Manuall, being the first fruits of mine en∣deavours, to your Ladiships acceptance.
In that short stride of the World, which I have travelled, having found many strong oppositions from our adversaries of the Church of Rome (as well at home as beyond Sea) tou∣ching the Protestant Religion, I began somewhat to doubt of the truth thereof: But by Gods providence lighting on this short Treatise, after the perusall thereof, I found the Religion
of the Church of Rome (if I may so call it) so sleightly poasted upon the quicksands of mens frivolous opinions, and contrariwise, the Protestant Religion so soundly founded on the true and lively rocke of our salvation Christ Iesus, that by Gods grace asisting me, neither the bewitching charmes of their devillish temptations, nor the fiery darts of their hot∣test persecutions, shall ever be able to divert me from the profession thereof.
Wherefore having received so great comfort thereby my selfe, I have laboured with as much as in me lyeth, to tran∣slate it verbatim out of French into English, that others also may have benefit therby, humbly beseeching your Ladiship to accept thereof, as a token of my ever bounden duty, and your Ladiship shall thereby encourage me to pray for your long and happy life here on earth, and your eternall happinesse with God in heaven.
Madam,
