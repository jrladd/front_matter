IF in former ages (most noble Prince) the studies Mathematicall were held meet for Princes; I doubt not but in these, they may implore (by your fa∣uourable admittance) the approba∣tion and defence of your gracious pa∣tronage; which emboldens me the rather, to presume the dedication of these my labours to your Highnesse protection. Wisedome is defined by CICERO to be diuina∣rum at{que} humanarum rerum scientia, of the former part of which de∣finition
(being the most absolute) I will leaue to speake vnto those who can better write; yet will thus much auerre, that no man shall obtayne the absolute perfection thereof, being abso∣lutely ignorant of the rules, rudiments and principles of Ma∣thematicall discipline, as the due consideration of that sacred and mysticall Vnitie and Trinitie, may well approue. And how auaileable and important they are, for the attayning to that hu∣manarum rerum scientiam, in Peace or Warre, is worthily witnes∣sed by PLATO, VEGETIVS, LIVIVS, and other Authors; who testifie of LYCVRGVS, and that famous Syracusean AR∣CHIMEDES; by the one, what excellent Lawes and Ordi∣nances were established and ministred, in the time of peace; and by the other, what more then wonderfull deuises and stra∣tagems were wrought against the inuincible forces of MAR∣CELLVS, in the time of Warre, which they worthily impute to this their scientiae mathematicarum. But should my weakenesse here vndertake to illustrate the excellency of that worth, which all worthy men admire; and that to your Highnesse, whose iudgement is best able to discerne; were but to depraue the one and the other, and rest in mine owne reproch. Wherefore, assuring my selfe, of your Highnesse loue and affection to these Artes, and your respect to the Professors thereof; with your power and abilitie of defence, against the malignant courses of malicious detractors, I presume in all humilitie to intreate your Patronage of these my labours, which in all dutie I prostrate at your Highnesse feet; with conti∣nuall inuocation to the Prince of Princes, euer to preserue your Princely dignitie.
