Owe You Each a larger Summ:
Why bring I then to Both a Crumm?
shew you Both, My Shifts, to liue;
en faine to Borrow what I giue:
t better so, then (blushless) steal
hers Conceipts; or Debts conceale.


Til more my Might, diuide this Myte.
Larke (they say) is worth a Kite:
me Greater, greater things pres√©nt,
lesser Worth, or worser meant.
OD measures not our Work, but Will:
o You the like: and loue me still.
