GEntlemen, though Phi∣lip of Spaine be olde and bed-redde yet hee is not quite dead, and though his forces for the present be somewhat weakned, yet is hee not vtterly conquered: in good time hee may be by diuine assistance, and your worthy valors, shew your selues ther∣fore the right inheritours of the ver∣tues of your auncestours: that is, in peace to be mindful of warre, and in war most studious of peace, bearing
 alwaies vpright minds, and forward heartes, to helpe your friendly neigh∣bours. For if our friendly neighbors farewell, then like all friends we shal fare the better, but if they faile of peaceable successe, wee can looke for nothing but warlike vproares: your wisedomes know what I meane, let it be then brieflie, pro lege, pro rege, pro grege: Macte virtute sitis.
