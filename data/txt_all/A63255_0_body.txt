I Know not to whom I could more properly Dedicate a Treatise of this Nature, than to Your Lordship, who is at Present Lord Chief Justice of England, and have set such remarkable Copies to inferior Magistrates. What is here offered, is neither Prophecy nor Plaister, Lam∣poon, nor Romance; but a clear Mirrour retreiv'd out of the Closet of wise Antiquity, In which future Administrators of publick Justice would do well to Look; For you know, My Lord, Common-Law runs much upon Presidents; And if a Man hap∣pen to have none of the best Physiognomies, there is no reason why he should straight grow angry; and fling stones to break all the Looking-Glasses he meets with, only because they represent the true Figure of the Object.
'Tis a Priviledge we Scribblers that write for Bread, hold by Prescription, to put any great Bo∣dies name in the front of our Book. Princes have not been able to exempt themselves or their Fa∣vourites from the Persecution of Dedications, nor
is there (I humbly conceive) any Rule made in Your Lordships Court to forbid them.
Suffer then, I beseech Your Lordship this Address to remain a Monument to Posterity of the Senti∣ments this Age has of Your Lordships Conduct and Merits, and witness to all the world how much its Author, is
Westminster-Hall  this 23 of Dec. 1680.
