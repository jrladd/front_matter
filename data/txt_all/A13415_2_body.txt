Right Honourable Madame:
AS the Graces, the Vertues, the Senses, and the Muses, are
emblem'd, or alluded to your Noble sex, and as all these haue
ample residence in your worthy disposition: To whom then but
to your selfe, being a Lady in goodnesse compleat, should I
commit the patronage of the memory of the great Lady of La∣dies,
Mother to the High and Mighty Lord of Lords? And
though I (a Taylor) haue not apparell'd her in such garments
of elocution and ornated stile, as befits the glory and eminen∣cy
of the least part of her Excellency, yet I beseech your Honor
to accepther for your owne worth, and her Sonnes worthinesse, which Son of hers, by
his owne merits, and the powerfull mercy of his Father, I heartily implore to giue your
Honour a participation of his gracious Mothers eternall felicity.
