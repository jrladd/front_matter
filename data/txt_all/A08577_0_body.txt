YOur good Lordship knowes, that in no times of
Peace, Peace is so fixed, but the varietie to
which all things worldly are subiect, may giue
necessary, and vndelayd occasion to the Theorie
of warres, if not their practise; if neither, yet
the knowledge of both, being by long and re∣nowned
experience so substantially turnd into
the powers of your minde; the vnequall subiect of this resolute and
deadly siege, cannot but adde one welcome forme to your discourse,
and finde some of your emptiest minutes fit to vouchsafe it accep∣tance.
The bloodlesse and quiet transformation it receiues from my
tributorie labours; wanting so much life of the death and actuall
excitations it naturally presented, I knew must want as much of the
Honor and fire it should confer to the Protection and spirit of a Soul∣dier:
but I know withall, the lost liues of so many resolute and Ho∣norable
Commanders, hauing a little restitution made them in this
willing remembrance, will finde no lesse cherishing and strength of
propagation in your liuing disposition: to whose true Nobilitie and
generally lou'd vertues, I thrice humbly submit these and
whatsoeuer worthier causes of your graue con∣sideration
the vnworthy worke
compriseth.
