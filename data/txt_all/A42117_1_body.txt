Honoured and Worthy Senators,
THE Cinque-Ports of
this Kingdom, having
signalized their Loyalty and

Valour by Sea, in several Ex∣peditions,
for the Glory of the
King's, Honour of their Coun∣try,
and Safety of the Realm,
our preceding Kings confirmed
several Dignities on them, and
amongst the rest, made their
Members of Parliament Barons,
as an Encouragement to Na∣vigation,
and their Prowess.
And gave them the Honour
of Supporting the Canopy over
his Head at his Coronation; as
is supposed by way of Simili∣tude:
That whereas they had
Defended, Supported, and Main∣tained
his Honour by their
Courage against his Enemies by
Sea, he gave them the Ho∣nour
to support the Canopy over
his Head; as a Mark of Ho∣nour
to them, and his Acknow∣ledgement

of the Greatness of
their Service.
And many Coasting-Towns
and Burroughs, have from time
to time, been endowed with great
Priviledges, some of them re∣maining
to this day; as a mark
of Honour, by several Kings,
to Encourage Navigation; from
whence originally, we have be∣yond
all Dispute, arrived to the
Knowledge we are now at∣tained
to in Marine Affairs▪
But now most of those Towns
and Burroughs (that formerly
flourished by their Fishing) are
reduced to miserable Pover∣ty,
and Thousands of Families
ruined for want of the Fishery.
And the Gentlemen who have
Estates in those Places, or near

the Coast, are exceedingly im∣pair'd.
Of which Calamity, King
Henry the 8th had undoubted∣ly
a fore-sight of, as appears
by the Sratute of 33 of his
Reign, 'tis there thus inserted;
because the English Fishermen
dwelling on the Sea Coasts, did
leave off their Trade of Fishing
in our Seas, and went the half
Seas over; and thereupon they
did buy Fish of Pickards, Flem∣mings,
Normands and Zea∣landers,
by reason whereof, many
Incommodities did grow to the
Realm, viz. The Decay of the
Wealth and Prosperity, as well of
the Cinque-Ports, and Members
of the same, as of other Coast∣ing-Towns
by the Sea-side,
which were builded, and inhabi∣ted

by great Multitudes of
People, by reason of Using, and
Exercising the Feat, and Craft
of Fishing.
Secondly, The decay of a
great Number of Boats and
Ships.
And thirdly, the decay of
many good Mariners, both able
in Body, by their Diligence,
Labour, and continual Exer∣cise
of Fishing; and Expert by
reason thereof, in the Know∣ledge
of our Sea-Coasts, as well
within the Realm, as in other
Parts beyond the Seas.
It was therefore Enacted, That
no manner of Persons, English
Denizons, or Strangers, at that
time, or any time after, should
buy any Fish of any Foreigners
in the said Ports of Flan∣ders,
zealand, Pickardy, or

France, or upon the Sea between
Shoar and Shoar.
This shews what great Care
our former Kings, and Parlia∣ments
have taken to Preserve
the Nursery for Sea-faring Men,
for the Defence of the King∣dom,
and for the Preservation
of our Coasting Towns, &c.
And, have therefore thought
fit in all Humility to Dedicate
this Book to you, as before∣mentioned.
If my sincere In∣tentions
to serve the Kingdom,
have its desired Success, I have
my wish, who am
