Right Honourable,
WHen I had considered
the meaness and weak∣ness
of this poor indea∣vour
of mine, and your
Lordships depth of
Judgement and understanding; I was
extreamly disheartened and even
ashamed to present it to your Lordships
view and consideration; much more to
begge your Lordships patronage for it.
But when I had likewise considered,
what a sweet Harmony of Justice,
Honour, and integrity resides in your
Lordships breast, and how much you
preferre the common good and welfare,
before all private interests and rela∣tions
whatsoever, and not doubting

but your Lordship might find somewhat
in it corresponding with that noble,
and truely generous publick spirit of
yours; I was then again imboldened to
prostitute it before your Lordships feet,
humbly begging your Patronage and
protection for it; and I the rather pre∣sumed
upon it, because I know it will
meet with Enemies enough in these
times; such as love not changes or al∣terations,
though for the better, and
such I shall not need to care for, or fear;
so your Lordship will deign to accept of
it, and receive it into your favour;
which if your Lordship shall be pleased
to do, and to pardon the imperfections
of it, it will be a great honour and in∣couragement
to him, who desires no∣thing
more, than to subscribe himself
(what indeed he is)
