SIR,
IT is so Customary a thing, the Dedicati∣ons of Books to Per∣sons of Quality; Especi∣ally, where the Author hath receiv'd any Obliga∣tions, that I might have been thought singular, had I not found some Person, to
whom Obligations had re∣quir'd an Acknowledg∣ment; and whose Judg∣ment and Approbation might have been sufficient to Countenance my Book. That, Sir, I hope will ex∣cuse my Presumption of Introducing Lisarda to you; A Lady, who though Vertuous to a Superlative, yet Unfortunate, till the Consummation of her Mar∣riage with Don Ricardo, and the greater Happiness of attaining the Honour to be Presented to you, fear∣ful
least her Misfortunes might follow her here into England, and that many might blame that here, for want of knowing the Cu∣stoms of Spain, which there is not thought a fault, no not a venial one: She fears our Ladies might be offended with so much for∣wardness in Spanish Wo∣men, which for want of a Spanish Confinement, they are not Guilty of them∣selves: These thoughts are what troubled her, till now that I assur'd her, You
were too Courteous to re∣fuse your Patronage to a Lady. But while she is thus happy in your Pro∣tection, give me leave to assure you, That I am, Most Intirely,
Sir,
