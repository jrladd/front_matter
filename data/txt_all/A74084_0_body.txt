Gentlemen,
FOr so many of you were, till you tainted your Bloud with Rebellion; when you were called to sit in that House, you took not the Covenant, or Negative Oath, but the Oath of Allegeance and Supremacy, flat contrary to those other two; If the King were not Su∣preame, you are forsworne; If He were, (as undoubtedly He was) you had no power to bring Him to Tryall, and wanting Power, (as by the Letter of the Law of this Land assuredly you did) His Execution was not Justice, but Murder. Though thoughts are free, yet to think evill of the King is condemned by Solomon, to speak evill of the King is Treason by the Law, to take up Armes against the King, it is against the expresse both of Scri∣pture and Law: surely then to Murder the King, must needs be Treason in the abstract: we have a long time justly termed you Rebells, but now we must call you Rebells in a more exalted note, and stile you Regicides. When you were summoned to that House, you were called to repaire, and not inlarge the breaches of the Kingdome, to strengthen; and not subvert Religion; to conserve, and not overthrow the Lawes; to consult with, and not confound His Majesty: in acting whereof, you have most impiously broken your Oath with God, your Allegeance to the King; your obedience to the
Church, and the trust reposed in you by the People. It hath been the happinesse of former Parliaments, and their utmost industry, to preserve the Kingdome, with the Lawes and People thereof: It hath been your con∣tinuall imployment, indefatigable paines, and esteemed happinesse to destroy the Kingdome, Lawes, People, and the preservers thereof. There are many amongst you learned in the Lawes, and if they have neglected their Duty, yet their tenacity cannot warrant your procee∣dings; For that grave and learned Oracle of the Law, Judge Jenkins hath sufficiently explained the difficulties of the Law, and your Duties, whose paines you have re∣rewarded with a most long and loathsome imprisonment. For which, and other your most execrable and unparallelled impieties, you must expect to have the thunderbolts of Gods anger throwne down upon you; for God is a just God, and cannot lie, neither will he suffer those to goe unpunished, that not onely resist his Ordinance, but advance their own above his. The Presbyterians were the first that fo∣mented this Rebellion against the King, and you see the heavy Judgement of God upon them: in so speedy snatch∣ing the power from them, when they thought themselves so securely the Lords of all: and Waller, Massey, and the rest, that were the great pillars of that cause, are now, you see, become the scorn and contempt both of friends and foes, and undoubtedly as you have been more vio∣lent and bloudy in your Rebellion then they, so your Judg∣ment shall be more fearfull: For prevention whereof, I have directed this little theater of Gods Judgements upon Rebells and Traytors in all Ages to you: that, when you see such small Rebellions and petty treasons so fearfully punished, you being conscious of the monstrousnesse of your execrable and unparallelled Treasons may endeavour
to avoid your approaching Judgement, by a speedy desi∣sting from your damnable designes.
Sero medicina paratur
Cam mala per longas invaluere moras.
I shall conclude with this advice, that you purge your House of all those Factious Members, that of late have illegally crept in, men, whose Principles are as base as their Births, and have no way to shake off the poverty of their parentage, but by Rapine, and Oppression of the King∣dome. That you call home the young King; and seat Him in His Throne in Freedome, Safety, and Honour, that you deliver up Bradshaw, Cook, and others that had hands in the late Kings, your Soveraignes Murder, to speedy and impartiall Justice. That you endeavour your utmost to Disband the Army; who are a crew of beggarly Sectaries, the scum and offall of the Common-wealth, and onely Disturbers of our quiet. That you sue to His Majesty for your Pardon, and crave an Act of Indemnity; and in so doing, you may save the effusion of much Christian Bloud, and render your selves, and your Country happy, which otherwise will spue them out as noisome rubbish, and de∣liver your remembrance to Posterity in an infamous and loathsome Character.
Vale.
