MY Bed-fellow, best beloued,
being visited with ane ex∣treame
Fever, so that I saw
nothing in her but evident
takens of death: I set my
selfe (Right Honorable, and
deare Brother in the Lord Iesus) to seeke out
sik comforts as might best confirm me against
sik ane assault, and prepare me for the patient
behalding of that spectacle quhilk I looked
shortly to haue seene, and ease mee of that im∣portable
sorrowe, quhilk soone might haue in∣sewed
vpon that dulefull departure. So cast∣ing
over my scrolles, I fell vpon the minutes of
a certaine Sermon, quhilk sometime comfor∣tablie

God hath vttered be the mouth of me
his simple servand, in the hearing of ane ho∣nourable
and frequent Auditorie, of the
quhilk, that honorable man of speciall account
in the eyes and hearts of all the gude men,
quhair he remaines, for vnfenzeit godlines
and earnest care in all gude vvarkes, Sir
GEORGE DOVVGLAS of Elenehill
Knight, and your selfe gif I bee richtlie re∣membred
was ane pairt: And the quhilk
as I vnderstude of you and him both, thairef∣ter
was the first motion of our coniunction and
affection in Christ. The quhilk quhen I had
found, I recognosced the heads of the samin,
and fostered a peece of meditation vpon the
pointes thairof at certaine dayes to my great
comfort, and of the persone afflicted, vvith
quhome I communicated also. The pleasure
quhair of, mooued me to employe my pen, and
set them downe in some order, with sik affecti∣ons
as the present constitution furnished, flow∣ing
alwayes from that fountaine of al consola∣tion,
the haly speiches of the spreit set furth in
sacred Scripture. Nowe because of the estate of
your disease, I daylie langed and purposed
quhiles ye wer heir at home, to come and spend

some peece of time with you, and to bestowe as
it suld please the Lord to giue, some spirituall
gift by conference, for your strengthning in
the truth, and that ready resolution to dye in
Christ, quhilk I haue often reioyced in sa gude
a measure to be graunted vnto you: But being
from day to day empeshed & stayed, till I hard
ye had transported your selfe to that maist no∣ble
Towne and Kirk of all this Realme; how∣beit
I knewe yee had then na neede of ony sik
thing from me, hauing there at hand sik store
and aboundance of all: yet it behoued mee for
testifying of my affection towards you. And
supplying some part of the inlack of my promi∣sed
Christian dewty, in visiting of you, to send
you a copy of the saide Sermon, with a little hi∣storie
of the departure of Iean d'Albret,
vmquhile Mother to this present King of
France, for a plaine and comfortable exam∣ple
and practise thairof, and all for furthe∣ring
of that gude wark, where about I wot ye
are maist occupied; that is, after a reformed
and sanctified life, to make a gude and godlie
end. How farre thir litle things may serue for
so great a wark, I remit that to the chiefe Ma∣ster
of the warke, the haly Ghaist. Certaine I

am be a peece of experience in my selfe, that
sum thing they may serue by his grace, for
howbeit they be farre from the faire stuffe yee
haue there at hand; yet now and then, it may
be, ye finde them feat for pinnings and wages:
vse them therfore as ye think thay may deme.
It is aneuch for mee, that I haue testified in
some sort my affectionat remembrance of you
in the tender bowels of his loue, quha hes dy∣ed
once for vs, to make vs liue with him for
ever, quha mote perfite and crowne the wark
of his grace in you.
From Anstruther,
the 17. of December 1596.
