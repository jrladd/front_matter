Beloved in our Lord;
I Here present you with the following Sermon, which I hope, will meet with a kind and favourable Recep∣tion from You. Indeed a stately Monument shewing the Excellency of the Work-man that erected it, as well as of him that is enclosed in it, is necessary to invite and gratify the curiosity of a Stranger. But any little thing, though so mean in it self that it cannot challenge any regard upon its own account, yet is wont to have some value set upon it, because 'tis the Memorial of a Departed Friend.
The Relation to you wherein both of us stood; the entire Affection you so justly had for him; the great kind∣ness you have shewn me for so many Years, together with the Additional one of so unanimously fiixing me in his room since his Decease, do not only justify, but also com∣mand this my present Dedication.

I shall now more than ever need your Remembrance of me at the Throne of Grace, in order to the discharge of the great Trust committed to me with Faithfulness and Success, so that none of you may want a Crown of Glory, nor I one of Rejoycing in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming;
1 Thess. 2.19. which shall lso be the daily Prayer and faithful Endeavour of him, who is on many accounts, with great Sincerity and Affection
