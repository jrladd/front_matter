SIR your own naturall inclination to vertue, & your loue to the Muses, assure me of your kinde acceptance of my dedication. It is seated by custome (from which wee are now bolde to assume authoritie) to beare the names of our friends vpon the fronts of our bookes, as Gentlemen vse to set their Armes ouer their gates. Some say this vse began by the Heroes & braue spirits of the old world, which were desirous to be thought to patronize learning; and men in re∣quitall honour the names of those braue Princes. But I think some after, put the names of great men in their bookes, for that men should say there was some thing good, only because indeed their names stood there; But for mine owne part (not to dissemble) I find no such vertue in any of their great titles to do so much for any thing of mine, and so let them passe. Take knowledge by this, I loue you, and in good faith, wor∣thie of all loue I thinke you, which I pray you may supply the place of further complement.
