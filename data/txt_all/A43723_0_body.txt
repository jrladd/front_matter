My Lord,
HAƲING Preached this Sermon, I had no thoughts of making it publick; But having been since sollicited for Copies, by some very honorable Persons, whose commands I cannot with∣stand, and whose judgments I cannot controle; and considering that Translating of Exemplars would be wearisome, if not endless: I resolved to commit them to the Press, yet so as the Philosopher answered Alex∣ander his Books, , scripsi, & non scripsi, I have Printed, yet not Printed them: Printed them that is, but with no intent to publish them, having con∣fined the number of my Copies, as near as I can conjec∣ture to the number of the Persons that may probably desire them: That so I might shew my zeal to the sur∣viving branches of the Deceased Lady, whose memory
 I adorn, and subject my self to the Censures only of an Honorable Familie, and not of a Censorious Nation. I add no more, but my hearty prayers to the Almighty, that the Blessings of both hands, and both worlds, may be the portion of Your Lordship, your Noble Lady, and your Hopeful Off-spring.
My Lord,
