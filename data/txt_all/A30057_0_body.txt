Gentlemen,
NOthing but a deep sense, and just consciousness of my own Inabilities, could have render'd me so pertinaciously backward, even to a rudeness al∣most unpardonable, in no sooner gratifying your repeated Commands, for the Publication of this mean, but well-intended Discourse: which appearing in the World (though after his Demise) upon the Nativity and happy Restauration of a Prince, who can no more dye in his Sacred Memory amongst us, than an English Monarch in his Politick State, makes it (if ever at all) now also equal∣ly seasonable. And since I publish this Performance under your Patronage, and with the License of my highly Honou∣red and Right Reverend Diocesan, tho I need as many as any one that ever appeared in Print, yet I shall make no A∣pologies for it. God grant that all the Parts and Inhabi∣tants of this Nation may, by the knowledge of your most generous Example, your most conspicuous, steddy, and sig∣naliz'd Loyalty to his late, be emulously influenc'd to their bounden Duty and Obedience to his present Majesty, whom the God by whose especial Providence he rules over us, long and happily continue unto us. May He never want such Loyal Subjects as your selves, nor such Loyal
Subjects so Gracious a Prince, who has given us his Royal Word to assure us, that he will stand by and de∣fend us both in Church and State, and who never yet did, and indeed (which must needs conquer our Fears, and remove our Jealousies) knows not how, and is yet to learn, to recede from it; may we never forget such un∣parallell'd Goodness; may we in Gratitude comply with Him, and readily satisfie him in every Demand we in Conscience can; May every Feast celebrated throughout his Dominions, like this of ours, regularly end with Loy∣alty to our King, with Charity to our Neighbour, and with Piety to our God; and, in a word, may every one of us (as we are in Conscience bound) endeavour to beget and propagate in all men, The Fear of God, and the Honour of the King, on which two Foundations the Happiness and Welfare of our Kingdom is superstruct∣ed. Which, as it is the fervent Prayer, so shall it ever be the constant and incessant Endeavour, in his Sphere and Station, of,
Gentlemen,
