I Humbly present unto your Highness the first fruits of our Natural History; A thing exceeding litâˆ£tle in quantity, like a grain of Mustard-seed, but yet a pledg of those things which God willing shall ensue. For we have bound our selves, as by a vow, every Month that God shall of his goodness please (whose glory it sets forth as it were in a new Canticle or Song) to prolong our life, to set out one or more parts of it, according as their length and difficulty shall prove more or less. Others may per adventure (moved by our example) be moved to the like industry; especially when they shall clearly perceive what is in hand. For in a Natural History

which is good and well set out, are the Keys both of Sciences and works. God preserve your Highness long in safety,
