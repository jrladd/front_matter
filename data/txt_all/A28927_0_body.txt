SIR,
WHen I first design'd
to Print these Papers,
I was prompted to dedicate
them to you upon two po∣werful
Considerations; First,
a desire I ever had of giving
you a publick Assurance of
the Love and Respect I have
for you, and your noble Fa∣mily;
and Secondly, the

ageeableness of the Subject
of this Book to the main
end of your Education. It
signifies little for a Gentle∣man
to learn French and La∣tin,
unless, at the same time,
he furnish his Memory with
some more profitable know∣ledge;
for Languages, if not
accompanied with things,
serve generally to no bet∣ter
purpose, than to multiply
natural Nonsense, and expose
Ignorance in many different
shapes. As for Knowledge
that, is undoubtedly most
useful and necessary wherein

all Mankind is agreed: I
mean, the searching of our
own selves toward the Regu∣lation
of our Manners, and
the forming of an Honoura∣ble
and virtuous Life. And
therefore I thought I could
not do better, than to recom∣mend
to your care and study,
the following Characters of
Virtues and Vices; the first, as
a Pattern, which you ought
to propose to your Imitation;
and the others, as Sea-marks
which may serve to teach
you to avoid those Rocks and
Sands, against which so ma∣ny

suffer daily Shipwrack
both in their Fortunes and
Reputation.
And now if I design'd to
follow the common drift of
Dedications, I had a fair Op∣portunity
to expatiate in a
Panegyrical Field: But I shall
wave so nice a Subject; for if
I should say all that I am
conscious you deserve, either
upon the score of your in∣nate
Virtues, or the early
progress you have made in
your Studies, I fear it would
be interpreted Flattery or
Presumption, instead of Ju∣stice,

yet I cannot forbear tell∣ing
the World, that I am the
more encourag'd to make
this Address, because I see
that what I would advise, is,
in a great measure, accom∣plish'd,
since it is most hap∣pily
begun: For I find in
you an admirable goodness
and tenderness of Nature, and
the Seeds of all generous In∣clinations,
which being fo∣mented
and kept up by the
good Examples hereditary in
your Family, will ripen in
due time into glorious Acti∣ons
and Habits, to qualifie
you for the Service and Or∣nament

of your Country
and the Honour and comfort
of your Noble Parents and
Relations: which is the con∣stant
and sincere Wish of,
SIR,
