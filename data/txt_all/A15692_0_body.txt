CVstome (that imperious King, or rather cruell Tyrant) hath so farre preuayled in these our dayes, that euery Pamphlet must haue his Patron, or els all the fatte is in the fire: Now I not knowing anye one whose name I might be so olde with, as to make a shelter for this substance-wāting shadow, dedicate it to you al, so shal I be sure to offend none. And as he that speaketh in the defence of womē, hauing a flock of femals for his Auditors (how-soeuer his cause be) is sure to want no wordes on his side: So let him that shall speake against this Toy, looke for more fists then his owne about his eares, & take heed of Club lawe, since the brainlesse multitude hath vouchsafed to take it into their protection. Now therefore, thou many headed beast, cen∣sure me at thy pleasure: like or dislike what thou

listest; but haue an especial care of this, that thou beest not ouer constant in thine opinions: But what euen now thou praysest to the heauens, by and by dispraise againe, as the vildest stuffe thou euer heardest of. Extoll that with admiration, which but a little before thou didst rayle at, as most carterly: And when thou sittest to consult about any weighty matter, let either iustice Shal∣lowe, or his Cousen Mr. VVeathercocke be fore∣man of the Iurie. Thus relying on thy Moon-like constancie, I will shrowde this sha∣dowe vnder thy alwaies-vnsted∣fast fauour.
