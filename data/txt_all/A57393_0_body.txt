My Lord!
I Have often observed, that the more sollicitous some persons appear in framing Apologies for the Publication of their Discourses, the more obnoxious they usually render themselves to the Censo∣rious lashes of Captious and Critical Readers. And therefore instead of stuffing this Epistle with formal pretences and excuses, I think it much fitter to take this opportunity of acquainting the world, that your Lord∣ships great Condescension in vouchsafing the Loyal Young Men of Bristol the Honor of being their Leader, is not only acknowledged by them with all the dutiful expressions of an humble gratitude, but moreover is likely to have a very good influence upon them in order to the Kings Service.

This perhaps some may think meanly and slightly of, because the persons Listed under your Lordships Conduct are for the most part in their Minority, and not very many of them are yet arrived to the age and perfection of Men. But they who would have them dis∣valued and disregarded for that reason, proceed upon very impolitick grounds, and such as have always proved highly prejudicial to the interests of these Kingdoms. For, if things be duly weighed and con∣sidered, for that very reason because they are Young, the greater countenance and encouragement ought in Policy to be shewn unto them, that so, when the Re∣volution of a few years shall fix them in the Stations of their Fathers and Masters, the impressions now made upon them may shew forth themselves in the hap∣py effects of an active and steady Loyalty. Had this consideration been had, and the thing rightly managed in the Last Age, according to the natural consequences of it, it could not but have fared infinitely better than it hath done in This; for indeed the multitude of turbulent and ungovernable Men, which have now been disturbing the common peace and tranquillity, is a certain indication of the little care that was then taken of Boys.
Thus much, My Lord, I thought my self in ju∣stice obliged to say in Honor of your Lordships ex∣emplary Condescension. To which, did I imagine it at
 this time proper, I might at least attempt to subjoin a larger Panegyrick upon your Lordship, the Illustri∣ousness of your Descent, the extraordinary acuteness of your Natural Parts, and the many admirable accom∣plishments which by means of an excellent Education you have acquired, affording ample matter for it. But because, notwithstanding the eminent conspicuity of these things in themselves, yet the representation of them to your Lordship may be adjudged Flattery, I shall at present forbear the insisting any farther on them, only desiring the favor of humbly remembring your Lordship, that the best and most ingenuous way of improving those advantages and endowments, is to make them always subservient to the Glory of him, who originally gave them unto you. By the doing this, My Lord, you will take the most effectual method for the advancing your own Glory, and for the making all the world sensible that you Act like a Son of the Great Duke and Dutchess of Beaufort; and therefore that you may not fail of endeavouring and obtaining it, shall be ever the Prayer of
My Lord,
