SIR.
THe times favoring
truth it becomes eve∣ry
one, now that
God hath given o∣portunity,
to bring
out of his store both
new and old as he is
provided. This which I here present
to you and the World is both, for it

deals with our primitive English An∣tisabbatarians,
Breerewood and Broad, but
chiefely with the latter, because none
else (that I know of) have undertaken
him being not in print, and therefore
knowne, but to a few as also with the
whole cluster of our moderne Wri∣ters
upon that subject, which are too
many to name except with an &c. For
the plot of the times has beene against
the power of Godlines, which could
never been pulled downe whilest the
Sabbath stood upright, and therefore
our Patrons of impiety have rightly
projected to take that out of the way
which stood so much in theirs, and
to remove that same holy interruption
which God in his care and wisedome
had put to our dayes and wayes of
Worldly natures, that so they might
bring all to a levell, by paring away
Sabbath and Sermons, which was the
onely way to mount them to the
height of their designe of bringing
Godlines to a forme, and all things

(but Episcopacy) from ius Divinum to is
Humanum, that they may bee all in all;
but all this while they have kicked
against the pricks for which they now
smart, nor could they expect other
then that they which opposed the rest
of God should have their owne rest
molested, for God will find a time to
bring truth to light, though she wade
through a long Eclipse, and to shut
up errour in darknes, and her abetters
in disgrace as now they are, for with
the froward hee hath threatned to
shew himselfe froward, and hee hath
made it good, to the praise of the glory
of his power.
