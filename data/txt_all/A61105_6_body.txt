SIR,
I Cannot forget your love to me, though I use not many visits, but must needs name you among the rest of my worthy friends, since you not only endevoured my pre∣ferment to St. Lau. P. but also suffered for my sake an af∣front by Melastomos, a barking blackmouthed creature in that place, who deserved a whip more then a whistle, for questing upon a false sent. I did not weigh his wrong done to me, for it was then in fashion (and too much still) to blast poor ministers, but it grieved me that one of your estate and dignity speaking only in my behalfe, should be abused by a pesant. But some dogs will bark at a true man sooner then at a theefe, by whom a good man cannot live unenvied, nor die unslandered. From such virulent tongues, and violent hands, God keep you and yours, and preserve you to his everlasting Kingdom, through Jesus Christ, which shall ever be the praier of him that is,
