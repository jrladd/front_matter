MY LORD,
AMONGST the encouragements which I have had to proceed in explaining some of the lesser Prophets, have been your Lordships perswasions, which deservedly ought to have with me the force of commands. The same have given me boldness to recommend this part of that Work to your Lordships Patronage: by whose countenancing of it, others will be encouraged to look into it with hopes of receiving some benefit by it. That which is presented to your hands is an Exposition on Malachi, the last of the Prophets, as in order, so in time: and even for that reason by me chosen to fix my thoughts on, before others, because nearest, therefore, in conjunction with the Gospell; to which it leads us by the hand, and delivers us over: for that begins where he ends; so that from that, looking back, according to our Saviours own direction to search the Scriptures of the old Testament, which testify of him, for confirmation of the new; and to see how, what in this is recorded as done, was in that foretold as to be done; we presently light on those things con∣cerning Christ and his forerunner John the Baptist, with report of which the Gospell begins, so clearly set down by this last of the Prophets, as that we cannot but admire that the Jews of those times did not at the appearance of them in their offices, without more adoe, confess, That what Malachi prophesied, was now come to pass, and acknowledge, That both Elias, the Lords Messenger, whom he would send to prepare the way before him; and the Lord of the Temple, whom they sought, even the Messenger of the Co∣venant, whom they delighted in (they that were to come) were come, and

they were to look for no other: And no less is it to be wondred, that their posterity should, even to this day, continue in the like obstinacy, and shut their eies against these manifest truths; notwithstanding they have long since seen fully executed on their Nation all those heavy things which in this Prophecy also were denounced against such as should not embrace them. Yet do they, taking no notice of these things, perversly still stand out, and seek all waies, by false glosses, absurd misinterpretations and misapplica∣tions of these Prophecies so long since fulfilled, as if they were things yet to come, to elude them, and deceive themselves and their posterity. Their cavils I have endeavoured, as God hath enabled me, to remove; and so by asserting the place for Christs Birth designed by Micah, and the time for his coming by Malachi, to clear the way for the better understanding of all such other Prophecies as foretold of other things in and by him to be fulfilled, and by the exact accomplishment of which the Gospell proves him to be the CHRIST. These I thought convenient, therefore, to begin with, as the Gospell doth, as preceding in execution divers others that were before them uttered. The due fulfilling of these, and the nature of them being vindicated from the Glosses of the Jews, the other will be better un∣derstood; and such cavils also as are brought in the expounding of them, be easier removed, the being and coming of him whom they concern being esta∣blished. What I have done in this kind, or any other which may conduce to the true meaning of this Prophet, I must humbly submit to the judge∣ment of your Lordship and others. Whatever the Work be, I desire it may be a testimony of my dutiful respects and gratitude to your Lordship, in many years enjoiment of whose love and friendship I have been formerly happy, and now more in that I see that the change of your Lordships condi∣tion to an higher degree of dignity in the Church, hath nothing altered your affections, of which I have real proof in your Lordships favor shewed to some of mine for my sake. Long may your Lordship continue in health and happiness, to be an instrument of promoting Gods glory and the good of the Church. So are the hearty prayers of
MY LORD,
