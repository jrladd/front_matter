ALL you Friends of the Truth, this is a Salutation unto you and to your Children, a fruit of the Plant of Righteousness, which ye know, and can savour the Fruit thereof, & is given forth from that Spirit in which we are one with you in the Service of Love and Truth, for the removing the use of such Books and Catechisms as are sprung forth of the corrupt Tree, which now is to be burned, and its fruits rejectâˆ£ed, and People are to use the leaves of the Tree that grows by the River of Water, that proceeds from the Throne and Presence of God for healing. So all Friends be faithful, and walk in that which refreshes the Plant, the Power of the Lord God.
