My LORD;
TO vouch your Lordships commands for the pub∣lishing this Discourse, I might reasonably think, would be to libel your judg∣ment; and the prefixing your Name to it, and this mean address, would look rather like revenge than homage or obedience: if I did not know that low performances are due to the transcen∣dency of such a subject as I then dis∣cours'd upon, and such a Patron as I

now dedicate to: So I lie prostrate un∣der my great Arguments, here insufficiency is Art and Rhetorick. And the truth is, my Lord, it was not this which made me so sollicitous to avoid your injun∣ctions, but apprehensions of the un∣usefulness of the Discourse itself.
When God's most signal methods of all sorts do not seem to have wrought much conviction; vvhen neither our own dismal guilts, nor miseries, nor most express miracles of deliverance have made us sensible, but after the equally stupendous 3 Oth of January and 29th of May, and the black time that interven'd; we are still the same perverse untractable people; vvhen luxury is the retribution made for plenty, license for liberty, and Atheism for Religion, vvhil'st miracles of mercy are acknowledged only by prodigies of in∣grateful disobedience: and on the other side, vvhen factious humours swell a∣gainst all Laws, as they vvould either over-flow those mounds, or make them yield and give way to them; vvhen Decla∣rations and Decrees, which were infallible when they came only from a party of a part of a Parliament, are neither of force

nor esteem when they have all solemnity and obligation that just and full authority can give; alas, what hopes of doing any thing can a weak Harangue en∣tertain? But, my Lord, since you are pleas'd to command, I give up both it and my understanding to your Lordship, and the weaker the Dis∣course is, so much the more pregnant testimony is it of the obsequiousness of
My Lord,
