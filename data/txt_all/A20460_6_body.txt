MY noble Lord, I much applaude your contemplatiue election in retiring your selfe with many worthy exam∣ples, as Cato to Picen, and Sci∣pio to a Farme to a contented countrie life. You see the poyson of populous places, and the Babel fall of popularitie, the vicissitude of times are full of pestilent pe∣rils. Let your Noble vertues make you happie in knowing your selfe, and canonicall in making vse of the greatest ruines of higher fortunes; my loue and ancient duty con∣tend both to gratifie your honour. Reade here the mutabi∣litie of time, and be reseruing in your Noble nature: what you find doctrine and vsefull: tis a handfull, but infinite in my loue and seruices. And I conclude with the Poet, Non rebus exiguis vacat abesse Ioui.
