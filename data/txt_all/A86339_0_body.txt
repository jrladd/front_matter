SIR!
YOur Desires to mee are equivalent to Decrees, which I shall bee alwayes rea∣die to put in execution, as far as I can, and never bee found in a contempt; Therefore, according to the contents of your last, I have sent you by this Post the Plea, concerning the English Gentle∣men that are under close restraint here in the King's Prison, for the death of Mr Ascham, and your old acquaintance John Baptista Riva his Interpreter; wee cannot conje∣cture yet what will becom of them, for the Church stand's firm for them; and you well know what predominant in∣fluences the Church hath in this Clime.
The Lord Cottington, and sir Edward Hide are parted, and departed from this Court, the first to Vallodolid, the other for Flanders, and since that time Mr Fisher appear's abroad in som lustre with his Coach and Lackies, whereas be∣fore hee kept retir'd and invisible. Catalunia is like to bee re∣duc'd this summer, for there are mightie forces both by Land and Sea to that purpose.
No more now, but that I am alwaies

Madrid this 8th of Maie, 1651.
