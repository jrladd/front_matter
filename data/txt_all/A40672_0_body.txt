Most Dread Soveraign:
THE tender of these ensuing Collections is made with as much Fear and Reverence, as it was intended with Duty and Devotion by the Author whilest living. The Obligation that lieth upon me to endeavour him all right, forced me unto this presumption. It is the first voice I ever uttered in this kind, and I hope it will be neither displeasing to Your MAJESTY, or blamed by the VVorld; whilest (not unlike that of the Son of Croesus) it sounds Loyalty to my Soveraign, and Duty to my Father.
The matter of this Work, for the most part, is the description of such native and peculiar Commodities as the several Counties of Your Kingdom afford, with a revival of the Memories of such Persons which have in each County been eminent for Parts or Learning. If this Age abound

with the like, it is their Glory; if not, the perusal may perhaps beget in them a Noble Emulation of their Ancestors. May Your MAJESTIES Raign be Happy and Long, to see Your Countries COMMODITIES improved, and Your WORTHIES multiplied.
