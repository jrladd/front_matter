SIR,
YOU can't be surpriz'd at the Ad∣dresses
and Acknowledgments of
the Muses, whom YOU have Honour'd, not
Only in their own Province, but likewise by
convincing the World, That the greatest
Genius for Poetry, can be as Eminent in

Business of State, and Affairs of the Pub∣lick.
'Twas but lately that the Fortune of Eu∣rope
depended upon the Welfare of England;
when England her Self was under the most
perplexing Exigencies, by the ill Condition
of our Coin, Deficiency of Funds, Loss of
Publick Credit (when our Forces by Sea
and Land, Domestick and Foreign Com∣merce
were to be provided for) with
other Afflicting Circumstances that threat∣ned
our very Constitution, and made
our Affairs seem Desperate.
The Redressing of all which Grievances,
(through Unparallel'd Difficulties) was, by
our SENATE (then Sitting) Undertaken

with more than Roman Greatness of Spirit;
and Effected, to the Preservation of Quiet
amongst our Selves, Astonishment of our
Enemies, and Benefit of all Europe.
And, SIR, how Instrumental YOU
were in those Transactions for the general
Safety and Welfare, Common Justice must
Acknowledge, and History informs us of
Statues Erected for less Services to the
Publick.
I pretend not to Enumerate Particu∣lars,
wherein (as Promoter, or Principal)
YOU have Merited the Thanks of the
Age, and demonstrated indefatigable In∣dustry,
as well as most extraordinary Saga∣city
and Iudgment.

Yet I cannot forbear mentioning One
Consideration, That so Refin'd a Spirit,
so Delicate a Genius, as could be De∣lighted
(to the Sublimest Degree) in
the Retreats of the Muses, and Gardens
of Philosophy, could Sacrifice it self
to the Fatigues of Publick Business!
but—
Vincit Amor Patriae.
SIR, I know the Value of YOUR
Time, and the Freedom that I take in
Presenting YOU with a Piece of
Poetry; which yet, if it be not les∣sen'd
by the Performance, it will not
be so, in YOUR Esteem, by

the Slenderness of the Subject, since
In tenui Labor, at tenuis non Gloria; si Quem
Numina laeva sinant, auditque Vocatus
Apollo.
However, I shall not repeat a Tre∣spass
in Detaining YOU with an
Apology—
Only, That Zeal and Duty will be
doing their Office, and Respect pay its
Attendance, though neither Wanted nor
Desir'd.
Besides, I have the same Right of
Addressing to YOU, as other Sons
of the Muses, and true Subjects of their

King and Country: For whose United
Interest and Service, YOUR Health
and Prosperity is most heartily wish'd, by
SIR,
