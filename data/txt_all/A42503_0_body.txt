Noble Sir,
HOw oft, how much in our seri∣ous discourses up∣on more than one of this Authors works, have we honoured

him for his learning; affe∣cted him for his piety; ad∣mired him for his industry; ap∣plauded him for his eloquence; and condoling him, pitied his sufferings, among many o∣ther godly and learned men his like? and thereupon it was that we studiously laboured, not so much to reconcile with∣in our selves many a particular phrase and passage (dispersed here and there) seeming not only to be borrowed from, but as bordering too much upon the expressions, if not opinions of the Inorthodox; but rather to salve them up to others un∣derstandings, who began to take more scandal at them,

than we our selves did; and this we endeavoured in a can∣did interpretation of his inten∣tion, as one who meant only to make use of the Adversaries manner of speaking to no other purpose, but to cause (I say not his, but) their forms and affectations to speak (as near as possibly could be) to the te∣nor of the Orthodox Truth and Faith in general, and to that of the Church of England in more e∣special.
But truly, Sir, this little piece of his, which you were lately pleased to send me; puts me ut∣terly to a loss; and sets me so quite beyond the seeking for an excuse; that it forces me alto∣gether

to fall upon a dissent. I could heartily have wish'd, that instead of answering his Friends (learned Friends) ob∣jection, he would rather have sate down by their advice; For were the thing that he princi∣pally aims at, true, yet was it not so necessary to be brought to light, especially not under the notion of a charge or chal∣lenge; For he may well assure himself all the reformed Di∣vines (men Orthodox and mo∣derate, both for Doctrine and Discipline) cannot chose but take themselves stricken at through the Presbyterians sides: And therefore, notwithstand∣ing he entitles it (Deus justifica∣tus)

against them only, yet I am much afraid he will not therein prove Homo justificandus, neither in their judgement, nor of many others, and they his friends and fellow workers, and fellow-sufferers too, whe∣ther more or less made known unto him.
And now (judicious Sir) though your own judgement (both in Divinity, and for o∣ther good learning) be such as come short to few of your qua∣lity; and so well known (as I need not speak) to the Gentle∣men of your Countrey and o∣thers; yet forasmuch as I am your Minister, I know you ex∣pect my mind; for therefore

I received it at your hand. And verily I shall (by Gods Grace) dissemble it neither with him, nor you; yet I would have both him and you think, I dare not presume to propound any thing here upon my own mind alone, but as I am ena∣bled to goe along with the Scriptures and the Church of God. Because it is a hard matter in (such a hard point as this of Original Sin) for a man to goe alone, and not to erre. Neverthelesse I know (through the gift of God) a man may be enabled and enlarged to speak newer and clearer; but then he must be sure that his ground for the

Point be old, and good; For it is a Fanaticism for any man to con∣ceit that God concealed such a main Principle of his Truth from his whole Church, till now that he revealed it to himself alone.
