Right Honourable,
WHen I lift mine Eyes from the low and hum∣ble valley of my obscure fortunes, to that bright shining and Eminent hill of Honour, on which the Favour of His Majesty, the Nobleness of Birth, and your many Excel∣lent Virtues have seated you; I cannot but lay a sharp and rigorous Censure upon my own

Presumption, that I, so much a stranger to your Lordship, should thus boldly adventure to press into your presence, and to crave your Honourable Patronage of so mean a Work; but when your Honour is pleas'd to consider that Di∣vine Truth's are Subjects worthy of acceptation, though presented in an Earthen Ves∣sel; and David's comfort (in rescuing his Wives, and reco∣vering the spoils from the Amalekites) was no whit the smaller, although a young man of Egypt made way for

the discovery. I hope to obtain (what I humbly beg) your Honours Pardon.
My Lord, this Sermon was Compos'd and Preach'd in the very height of our late dread∣ful Visitation, when Thou∣sands dy'd on our right hand, and Ten Thousand on our left; at which time my imployment by day was visiting the Sick, and by night burying the Dead; having no time allowed for study but what I extracted from my natural rest which may make this Tract more guilty of failings than at

another time; my humble re∣quest therefore to your Lord∣ship is, that you would be pleased to lay the finger of a charitable construction upon the Scar of my imperfection, and favourably accept this first fruit of my labours. So in all humility imploring the God of Majesty and Mercy to Sanctifie your Heart, Rectifie your Hand, Justifie your Soul, and lastly Crown your Head with eternal Glory; I take the honour to Subscribe my self,
