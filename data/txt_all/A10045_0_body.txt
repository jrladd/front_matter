ILlustrious Prince, your Gra∣cious favour and Princely bountie, shining this Act vp∣on two of vs, the late Ser∣vants of your blessed Bro∣ther, hath giuen life and mo∣tion to this which I presume to present vnto you. It is a Princes vow, made to Ierusalem, the virgin of the East, and beautie of the earth, it is harty for the manner, holy for the matter, fit for these times, wherin because in Ierusalem, (Church and Court) some doe vow to Babylon, Court & Country may obserue what our Prophet sitting by the waters of Babylon, did vow to Ierusalem, Religion is our Ierusalem, be you her Prince, wee
haue sate lately, and lamentably at the waters of Babel, mourning and mourning, and would not bee comforted, because HEE was not, who was as truely Gods servant, as his servants earthly God.
Your Highnesse is now the Phoenix, the daw∣ning, the morning, the day starre, the sunshine, & light and life of the newly cleered firmament, O then grace her, who will bring you to further glory RELIGION. Bee her Patrone, that shee weep not, bee her Champion that shee bleed not. Let no Popish Philistin come neere the chaire, much lesse, the eare of your greatnesse, to dis∣grace truth, or wrong faith, and at all times pre∣ferre Ierusalem in your song. So shall all eyes, hearts, hopes, be fixed vpon you here, and all glory, ioy, & happinesse be fastned vpon you hence. For which purpose ever shall bee offered p the humble devotions of
