SIR,
NOnconformity unto, and Separation from the Church of England, having brought forth bold and daring Advocates to offer to the world, and that with a repeated diligence, Pleas for their Justification; 'twas high time for some dutiful Son of so innocent and indulgent a Mother, to awake, arm, and march forth out of his Tent, for her De∣fence and Vindication: And how seasonably and obligingly you appeared, who are deservedly reputed the Antesignanus of the present Age, for the Protestant Cause and Interest, I can with more thank-ful Resentments acknowledge, than with due Elogies represent; for I can tell you, Sir, with∣out the least suspition of flattery, That so good a Cause be∣ing managed by such an expert Champion for the Truth, the Conforming Sons of the Church are greatly confident, that you will rather need Spectators to congratulate your victo∣rious
Successes, than any Seconds to help you with any Succours in your Contests. Indeed you have so judiciously and learnedly stated the Case of sinful Separation, and so directly and plainly applied it to the Authors and Fomen∣ters of it here in England, that you may with much truth, and no immodesty, say, Veni, vidi, vici. But 'tis your In∣felicity, that you have to do with such Adversaries, who, like an angry and revengeful sort of Animals, which will shew their Teeth when they cannot bite, and bawl when they durst not fight, rather than they will quietly and silent∣ly yield to the conquering force of your Arguments, they will raise a great Noise, and write much against them too, though to no purpose: and though you have done enough to shame them out of a disputing and wrangling humour, yet you finde they become impudent, and rail and upbraid, yea, turn meer Buffoons, quibble and scoff it out; and when nothing else will do, they will flie to their sure and old Refuge, their Obstinacy, which they know to be so strong an Hold against the power of Arguments, that the power of Miracles cannot demolish it. 'Tis true, they do not, with the Romanists, in their Contests with you, challenge to themselves an Infalli∣bility; but yet they carry it as if they could not be deceived, accounting a perfective Change no commendable Improve∣ment, but a vicious Weakness: and therefore that your friendly and compassionate Condescentions to instruct and convince them, have so highly displeased and provoked them, is not at all to be wondered at; for they take it to be an attempt to expose them, because you hereby represent them as a sort of men who are not altogether of the wisest,
but such as have assented to Propositions, and engaged themselves in answerable Practices, without taking due e∣vidence and consideration. And for such Pretenders to Knowledge as they are, who are, or would be, admired for Gods most secret ones, to take up Opinions and agreeable Practices, and to plead and suffer for them, and after they have made a strong and daring Party for them too, then to recant and lay them down, is a Punishment too great to be endured; an Argument of such weakness and vanity of Minde, and of such levity and unresolvedness of Will, they durst not own, lest their Reputations and dependant Inte∣rests then become as little, as they perswade themselves now they are great. Besides, you have charged Schism on a Separation from the Church of England, and you cannot make them understand what the Church of England is: and I will warrant no body else shall, unless he propound a Proposition concerning it, which will gratifie their Affecti∣ons, and accommodate their Interests; which no wise, good, and honest man will ever do. The Titles given to some of their Pamphlets are very goodly and specious: here you have, A Christian Temper; there, The Peaceable De∣signe; here, A Peace-Offering; there, A Plea for Peace; here, A true way to Concord; there, A Discourse of E∣vangelical Love, Church-Peace and Unity: but they all joyn Issue in Declamations against the mischief of Imposi∣tions, and conclude in Pleas for Nonconformity, and Vindi∣cations of themselves from Schism; that is, they represent the Church of England as a Tyrannical Imposer, a Society of men usurping and exercising Church-power for Destru∣ction
and not for Edification; unto whom no body ought to submit and obey, but every body must oppose and defie. So that we must undo our selves, and betake us to a Stool of Pe∣nance, before we can be in a meet capacity for a Christian communion with them in Love, Peace, and Ʋnity. And to give them their due, they are no Changelings in their common designe; they are all hard at it to pull down the Church of England, and to get themselves uppermost; and if they happen to rid themselves of Impositions, I can get a Commis∣sion to assure you in their Names, that they are more peacea∣ble than to stomach it, and bring themselves under them a∣gain. Let there be no Laws made, and they will be very careful not to break them; Let it be lawful for every man to do that which is right in his own eyes, and they will be a very innocent sort of people, and never offend. This, Sir, you know, is the true construction of what they call the Mis∣chief of Impositions. Now although we know them so well, that we need not the help of a Melius Inquirendum to disco∣ver that they are one of the most unteachable as well as most ungovernable sort of people in the world, against whom Autho∣rity is no longer safe than 'tis too strong for them; yet I hope God hath mercy in store for them, because he hath so signally called you forth (who so very well understand their Disease and Remedy) for their Cure. And that the Work may prosper in your hands, and be throughly effected, to Gods Glory, this Church's Peace, and your own Satisfaction and Comfort, is the hearty and fervent Prayer of him that is,
Reverend Sir,

Moreton-Hampstead, Octob. 22. 1680.
