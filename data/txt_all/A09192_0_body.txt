SIr, it hath bin vsuall aswel among Heathen in erecting their profane monuments, as Christians in dedi∣cating their churches, to affect and chuse among many, some one saint tanquā numen tutelare aboue the rest: in whose honor when they had finished the maine worke, yet they thought not all wel, except his picture stood en∣shrined ouer the porch, or some other more eminent place. (Though with a number more of my time I ne∣uer dremt of any thing lesse thē building churches) I imitate them so far, (if it be not superstition,) to chuse my Patrone whose name in the depth of an ho∣nest zeale, I carue in operis vestibulo, as Lipsius saith; although in this case deuotion be liable to none account, I confes though I had neuer bin obliged vn∣to you for some particular fauors; yet the loue you bear to the arts aboue any other I know, shold haue enforced my Genius to haue awaked, & sought you out wheresoeuer:not that I thinke so weak a present either worthy of your view, or so vntoward a tour∣ney,

but (as it falleth out among pilgrimes) while others of farre better merit, in zeale of your name hang vp their gownes or bracelets, I mighte sliely escape with my candle: and in truth I bring no better; for imparting to manie what I haue, not hindering my selfe, I doe but accendere lumen de lumine as one saith.
How necessarie a skill drawing or painting is; & howe manie waies the vse thereof is required, none knoweth better then your selfe: how rare the per∣fection of it amongst vs, euery man may perceiue, when scarce England can affoord vs a perfect pen∣man orgood cutter, (I speak not of the pencil wher∣in our Maisters may compare with any els in Eu∣rope) in respect of the dutchmen and other straū∣gers: for which cause (as well to encorage as in∣struct any young practitioner that bereth good wil to this arte) I haue collected as familiarly as I could, the chiefe and most easie groundes of draw∣ing, annexing hereto the māner of limming in water colors, also certaine rules for Annealing & pain∣ting vpon glasse: which with my self, and my hereaf∣ter more serious endeauours, I offer to the censure of your worship, of whome J humbly take my leaue. 
From my studie in Kimbalton this eighth of Nouember.
