I Here present you with a Reading, the Au∣thor whereof may be known to most of you; it is not for me to write Ercomi∣ums on his worth; for his eminency f o∣ther learning, besides his great knowledge that appears in this, speaks him more to the judicious and intelligent then I dare take upon me to express, lest I do too little, knowing my inability of doing him honor enough:

I humbly beg your pardon in obtruding so rude a Composure, (as to the translation) upon your Pa∣tronage, the sense of my own weakness, making me conscious of some mishaps, but reflecting upon the greatness of your judgements and learning in this Law, together with your candor to my years, will first recti∣fie and then pardon: Let the world shoot their bolts, I have my end if in this or any other act I may be estee∣med
