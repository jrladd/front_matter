Honoured Sir,
HAving seen your treatise, and being in the number of those to whom your discourse is directed, I do in my own and others behalfs returne you thanks, for your offer and en∣deavour to hold forth somewhat for the sa∣tisfaction of those who desire to walke by rule, and cannot comply with alterations, great, sudden, and of publick concernment upon such grounds, as peradventure take with some others.
In the argument you expresse your self thus, a declaration hath been lately published, wherein the grounds are exprest of seling the present government, with which if any be not so far satisfyed as to think that settlement lawfull, yet even to such is this discourse directed, which proposeth proofs, that though the change of a government were beleeved not to be lawful, yet it may lawfully be obeyed.
I hope you wil not take offence, if I (having many times read over, and as I was able weighed your treatise) do acknowledg, that I am not yet satisfyed in that which is made the busines of
your book. I suppose also that J shall not in this writing giv offence to any of different Judgement, and J am apt to beleeve that those that are true to the principles of Liberty of Consci∣ence, wil not take offence at me for proposing in a peaceable way the grounds of my scruples, to such a casuist, as if the worke it self be feasable, may be a probable instrument of clearing that case wherein he hath appeared, and therin both satisfy the spirits of many that truly fear the Lord, and be serviceable to the establishing of the new fabrick, in a more honourable and lasting way, than the greatest penaltyes can encmpasse. For my self I shall only adde thus much, that I am perswaded; if you knew, how much unbeleef lodges in my heart, and how great inconveniencyes I must wrestle with, in case my scruples be not satisfyed; you would not much doubt, but that I would be as willing to receive satisfaction, as you have exprest your selfe to give it. Thus leaving the following lines to your consideration I rest,
