SIR,
TO satisfie your desire, I have endeavoured, so farre as the shortnesse of time, the di∣stractions of my mind, and the want

of Bookes would give mee leave, in this place of exile, to open the myste∣ries of this Treatise, so much cried up by those, whose eyes pierce no deep∣er then the superficies; and their judgements, then the out-sides of things. Expect not here from mee Rhetoricall flourishes; I study mat∣ter, not words: Good wine needs no bush. Truth is so amiable of her selfe, that shee cares not for curious dressing: Where is most painting, there is least beauty. The Gentleman, who at last acknowledgeth himselfe to be the Authour of this Booke,his eface. tells us, that many things in it are not to be called unto the rigid test of reason, be∣ing delivered Rhetorically: but, as I suspect that friendship, which is set out in too many Verball Comple∣ments;

so doe I that Religion, which is trimmed up with too many Tro∣picall pigments, and Rhetoricall dresses. If the gold be pure, why feares it the Touch-stone? The Physician will trie the Apothecaries drugges, ere hee make use of them for his Patients bo∣die; and shall wee not trie the in∣gredients of that Religion, which is accounted the physick of our soules? I have no leasure nor mind here to expatiate my selfe: a sparkle of the publike flame hath taken hold on my estate; my avocations are divers, my Bookes farre from mee, and I am here
Omnibus exhaustus pene casibus, omnium egenus:
Therefore accept these sudden and extemporary Animadversions, so

earnestly desired by you, as a testi∣mony of his service and love to you, who will alwaies be found
