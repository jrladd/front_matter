SIR,
THe diet of E∣phraim, in the Prophet, can∣not but by al, that have tri∣ed it, be interpreted, and

entertained, for very spare, and thin, that is nothing else but (what the Apostle disclaimeth the fighting with) a poor blast of empty Aire. That Ixion is in a very sorry condition, that embra∣ceth a cloud of such vacui∣ty in stead of the Iuno of a well-furnished table. Mine entertainment, Sir, by you, from time to time, hath been of another na∣ture, that have still, every day more and more, a∣bounded in pregnant,

testimonies of your real favours towards me. These poor labours, which, when preached, you were pleased highly to approve of, shall you but now vouchsafe to look upon, in a dead letter, where they cannot but lose much of their lustre, with a favourable eye, you shall every day, more then o∣ther, lay a strong obligati∣on of a continued sacrifice of prayer, still to be offe∣red up before the Throne of grace, for all manner of

blessings, both spiritual, and temporal, to be showred down upon you, and yours, by
Sir,
