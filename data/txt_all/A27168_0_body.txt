My LORD,
'TIs not in regard of my Obligations to you, though I own them with grateful acknowledge∣ments; 'tis not in regard of your late most deserved advancement, though I hear∣tily rejoyce at it: 'Tis in re∣gard of your intrinsick good∣ness, that this Dedication begs your acceptance, and humbly offers it self to you. Before Lordship and Pater∣nity were added to your Ho∣nourable
Titles, you was in∣titled to this book: your dignities being dignified by you, I considered not their eminency, but the eminency of your Vertue and Piety. I know, My Lord, that you aim at a better reward than this world can give; but that a great light set on a high place cannot be hid from the eyes of Men, Angels alone should rejoyce in the brightness of yours: you shun praise as much as you deserve it: you neither desire nor want any thing of Fame. But, My Lord, I wanted a living ex∣ample of a sincere and de∣vout lover of JESƲS to exemplifie my Discourse: and though (God be prai∣sed)
many more might be found in this Church, yet you are one of the fairest and most attractive: in so much that though it be easier to write than to do well, yet a better Pattern of a Religious Life might be drawn from your actions than from my directions.
My Lord, I have just cause to fear that I have in∣dulg'd my genius too far, and perhaps some will think that I would have Godliness to be Shorn and devotion a Re∣cluse from the world, which is far from my thoughts or desires: though I must con∣fess that at first I intended a much different and less defective Treatise on this so
good a subject, had not other necessary helps as well as abi∣lities been wanting. How∣ever at the best I could have added nothing to such per∣sons as your Lordship; the Holy flames of Divine Love that burn in your heart have too much light and fervency to have receiv'd any increase from me: and therefore I have not aim'd at any thing higher than only to assist the weak and fix the inconside∣rate. But, My Lord; though I can not in the least profit you by this my poor labour, yet its being own'd by you may be very advantageous to me: Your Reverend and much Honoured name will not only credit me, but which
is more, will recommend my Book, and also promote its design of winning affe∣ctionate Servants and lo∣vers to JESƲS. This I know you will rejoyce to do: Wherefore in pre∣senting my Book to your Lordship, I humbly beg your blessing on it and its Author. Who is with due respect and affection,
