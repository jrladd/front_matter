Most Gracious Soveraigne,
I Have beene long ashamed to see the Ae∣gyptian loacusts, the emissaries of Apol∣lyon, and the sonnes of perdition, under the name of Christ, so much to abuse His sacred truth, as to send forth so impudently, and most ignorantly, such lying Pamphlets, so stuffed with Treason, to animate Rebellion, and to poyson the dutifull affections, and the obliged loyalty of your Majesties seduced Subjects, and seeing we ought not to be sleeping when the Traytors are betraying our Master, I have been not a little grieved to see so many able men, the faithfull servants of Christ,
In publicos ho∣stes, quilibet homo miles. and most loyall to Your Majesty, either over-awed with fear, or distempered with their calamities, or I know not for what els, to be so long silent from publishing the ne∣cessity of obedience, and the abomination of Rebellion in this time of need; when the tongue and pen of the Divine should aswell strengthen the weak hands of faithfull sub∣jects, as the sword & musket of the souldier should weaken
the strength of faithlesse Rebels: therfore, not presuming of mine ability to eqalize my brethren, but as conscious of my fidelity both to God and to your Majesty, as in my yonger yeers I fearlesly published The resolution of Pilate,
Non sine meo magno malo. so in my latter age, though as much perplexed and persecuted as any man, driven out of all my fortunes in Ireland, hunted out of my house and poore family in England; and (after I had been causelesly imprisoned, and most barbarously hand∣led (then threatned beyond measure; yet I resolvedly set forth this Tract of The Grand Rebellion: and though it be plaine, without curiosity—Qualem decet exulis esse: Yet I doe it in all truth and sincerity, without any sinister aspect; for my witnesse is in Heaven, I had rather have all the estate I have plundred and pillaged, my wife and chil∣dren left desolate, and destitute of all reliefe, and my selfe deprived of liberty & life by the Rebels, for speaking truth; in defence of whom myconscience knoweth to be in the right, then to have al the praise and preferment that either peo∣ple, Parliament or Pope,can heap upon me, for sowing pil∣lows under their elbows; and with idle distinctions, false in∣terpretations and wicked applications of holy Writ, hypo∣critically to flatter, and most sediriously to instigate the discontented and seduced spirits, and others of most despe∣rate fortunes, to rebell against the Lords annionted. I pre∣sume to present the same into your sacred hands. God Al∣mighty, which delivereth your Majesty from the contradi∣ction of sinners, and subdueth your people that are under You, blesse, protect, and prosper You in all Your waies, Your royall Queen and all Your Royall progeny. Thus prayeth
