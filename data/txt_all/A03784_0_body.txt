WORTHY SIR:
I Know that
noble Na∣tures
desire
more to doe
good, then to
hear of the
good, they doe; and therefore,

without all farther Complement,
you shall giue me leaue, Onely
to say thus much: That (if
GOD and Nature had not)
yet your many kind and Con∣stant
fauours to mee, and all
mine haue made mee truely
your owne: which, (as I glad∣ly
acknowledge) so I would haue
the World take notice, That I
am both sensible of them,
and thankefull for them:
And now (Sir) being already
deepe in your debt, I must still
runne farther vpon your score,
by committing to your Care and

custodie this Innocent Child not
of my Body, but of my Braine.
It is surely of full Age, for It
was conceiued and borne in
Queene Elizabeths time, but
grew to more maturitie in King
IAMES's; and therefore,
(as wee vse to say) It should be
now able to shift for It selfe:
But I that gaue It life, finding
the weaknesse thereof, was ful∣ly
resolved to keepe It still at
home vnder mine owne wing,
and not to let It see the Sunne,
when loe, (after Twenty yeares
concealement) when I thought

the vnfortunate Babe (like to
It's Father) euen dead to the
World, I saw the false and
vncomely Picture of my poore
Child (taken by a most vnskil∣full
hand) offered to the pub∣licke
sight and censure of euery
judicious Eye: and (though
that could not) yet truely I
did blush for It, to see It,
so nakedly, so vnworthily, so
mangled and so maymed thrust
into the world, that I scarce
knew It, and was a∣sham'd
to owne It: And
therefore (good Brother) to

vindicate both It and my Selfe
from those grosse and sence∣lesse
Errours, wherewith that
false Bastard was too foulie de∣formed;
I haue now sent It a∣broad
to seeke It's fortunes, in
It's own true shape, and habite:
desiring your Selfe, and euery
vnderstanding Reader (for I
know It is not for the vse of e∣uery
Ordinarie Eye) to loke
vpon that former Peece, with
scorne and Contempt, and once
againe to take a resurvay of
It, as now It Appeares in
It's owne true feature and po∣sture:

It may bee you shall
find somewhat in It, both to
informe the Vnderstanding and
to rectifie the Affections, and if
in any of the Passages thereof,
It shall seeme eyther too light,
and remisse or too bold, and
free, eyther, too open and tart,
or too sparing and reseru'd;
That you must impute, eyther
to the matter, that I handle, or
the parties, that I personate,
which must of necessitie be
drawne according to the true
Life, both in colours and pro∣portion,
or else, the Worke will

bee of very little vse, and of lesse
Grace and Ornament, eyther to
my Selfe or others: And so
humbly desiring the Almighty
to blesse You both in Soule, Bo∣dy
and Estate; I rest, not your
Servant according to the new
and fine, but false Phrase of
the Time, but in honest old
English, your loving Brother,
and true Friend for
euer:
