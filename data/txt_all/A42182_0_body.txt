May it please Your Lordship,
I Hope it will not create Your Won∣der, that an unknown Hand should Dedicate these few Sheets to Your Lordship's Patronage; whil'st your Own Loy∣alty is eminently expressed in the daily Ser∣vice

of Your King and Country. And, as Your Lordship's Place is Great, so is Your Care and Prudence: A remarkable Instance of which we lately had, when the Picture of His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, was rudely defaced by the Assassination of a Wicked Person, wherein Your Lordship's Endeavours did so readily appear, and Your Zeal to have the Barbarous Act discovered; that there seemed nothing wanting in Your Lordship, to satisfie the King, and Kingdom of Your utter Abhorrence of so foul a Deed.
Therefore, to Your Lordship I bring this little Treatise, that You may, with Your Acceptance, vindicate the Reputation, as well as Person, of This most Illustrious Prince, in whom all things center, that are Good.
And if I have wrong'd His Royal High∣ness, or Your Lordship, by rudely expressing

my honest Meaning herein declared; I shall need no other Satyr, than a Self-reflection, or Punishment, then what I shall be ready to inflict upon my Self. But whatever happens to me for my own Unworthiness, my greatest Happiness will be to have Truth appear, tho through a Cloud; and Slander punish'd, tho Justice Triumph in the Over∣throw of my Imperfections. I am,
My Lord,
