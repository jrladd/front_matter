THe unquestionable duty of all men, who cannot pay just Debt, is at least to acknow∣ledge it; specially where the Debt is so great that the Debitor is not responsable: when I remem∣ber the good hand of God upon me, in bring∣ing me to such a refuge as Glasgow; through so many difficulties and dangers; having stayed in Derry until the second day of
 its Siege, could not get out of the Gates without great difficulty, and forced to leave the half of my Family within the Walls, by the violence of Souldiers; and the next day was taken and Robbed by the Enemies: yet coming unto you in grief, for the la∣mentable State of this Nation, and particu∣lar relations: found no less affectionat tenderness and care, than if I had come among so many near Relations, being suf∣fered to want nothing necessary for this life. Many others also of this Nation do, and have reason to remember gratefully your labour of love, in their destitute con∣dition; I can see no reason, why such seasonable compassions should be buried in oblivion; but rather should be published according to many Scriptural precedents; rendering fragrant, and perpetuating the memory of such Christian Sympathy. And though in point of modesty, some find it dif∣ficult to commend Benefactors to their face, yet find no less dissicult to be ungrate. Your friendly reception of me at first was not all, for after ye were pleased to call me for a season, to labour in Gospel-work, your acceptance of my poor labours was yet a greater comfort; and the testimonies I
 had of affection from Magistrats, Mini∣sters, and People, were really surpris∣ing, being conferred on so worthless a Crea∣ture: and that which added yet more to render my lot comfortable at that time, was the exemplary conversation of many Chri∣stians, whose knowledge and experience in godliness was such, as gave occasion for my own edification every day.
Pardon this confidence of perfixig your honourable Names to so mean a Work; which I the rather hope to obtain, because experience of your former indulgence, hath made me thus presume, to hope for acceptance of an affectionat and ob∣liged testimony of gratitude; though it be but as a mite, where so ma∣ny Talents are due.
And that ye may continue of one heart and way, exemplary as hither∣to, in appearing for, and promoting the Kingdom of Christ, that your labour of love may be fruit abound∣ing to your account, that the Coun∣tenance of God may be lifted up, and his face shine on your assemblies, and
 that upon all the glory a defence may be created, to continue from generation to generation, is the desire of
Right Honourable,

L. Derry, Feb. 26. 1694/5
