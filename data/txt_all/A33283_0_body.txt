SIR,
THe request of those that had power to command me, made it my duty to publish first to the eare, and now to the eye these two short discourses. I humbly offer them both to your acceptance and per∣usall, as an acknowledgement of your right to all my endeavours,
 especially of this kind. The com∣mon places rather toucht then hand∣led in them are Justice and Cha∣rity, the Jachin and Boaz, the strengthening and establishing pil∣lars of the whole Commonwealth of mankind: especially where their foundation is laid in the firm and stable grounds of Christianity. These arguments, having been your con∣stant study and practice must needs be so familiar to you, that my two mites can make no conside∣rable addition to your treasure of knowledge. Yet Sir, having out of my penury cast in even all that I had, in a thankfull sense of my particular engagements to you, I hope for as fair a reception, as those Authours, that have cast in much out
 of their abundance. My onely pre∣senting them to your hand, is to wit∣nesse my humble respects to your per∣son, and my readinesse to serve you in the work of God to the utmost of my abilities: and that you will re∣ceive them under that notion is the hope and desire of
SIR,
