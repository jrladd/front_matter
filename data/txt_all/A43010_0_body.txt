IF annual Oblations from
Gratitude were cele∣brated
by the Ancients to
those, that had been some∣what
extraordinary ser∣viceable
to the Publick,
a perpetual Anniversary

is more justly due to your
Lordships most successful
Endeavours, and Zele
for the Laws, Liberties,
and the Protestant Reli∣gion;
wherefore may I
among the rest make hum∣ble
offering of these my lit∣tle
Labours to your Lord∣ships
Immortal Name, as
a grateful Testimony that
I am.
