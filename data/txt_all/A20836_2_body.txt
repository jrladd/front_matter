MY singuler good Lady, your many vertues knowne in generall to all, and your gracious fauors to my vnworthy selfe, haue confirmed that in me, which before I knew you, I onlie saw by the light of other mens iudgements. Honour seated in your breast, findes her selfe adorned as in a rich Pallace, making that excellent which makes her ad∣mirable; which like the Sunne (from thence) begetteth most pretious things of this earthly world, onely by the vertue of his rayes, not the nature of the mould. Worth is best discer∣ned by the worthy, deiected minds want that pure fire which should giue vigor to vertue. I referre to your great thoughts (the vnpartiall Iudges of true affection) the vnfained zeale I haue euer borne to your honourable seruice; and so rest your Ladiships humbly to commaund.
