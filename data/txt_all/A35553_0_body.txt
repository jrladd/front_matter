May it please your Highness,
I Have here laid prostate before the Throne of Your Justice, above Twenty Millions of the

Souls of the slaughter'd Indians; whose forc'd de∣parture from their Bodies, Cruelty it self compassio∣nates. Yet me-thinks I hear a sudden stillness a∣mong them; the cry of Blood ceasing at the noise of Your great transactions, while You arm for their Revenge. By which it is apparent, how well your Highness doth observe the will of the most High, using Your vast Power and Dig∣nity onely to the advance∣ment of his Glory among

Pardon me, Great Sir, if

next my zeal to Heaven, the loud Cry of so many bloudy Massacres, far sur∣passing the Popish Cruel∣ties in Ireland, the Honour of my Country, of which You are as tender as of the Apple of Your own eye, hath induced me, out of a constant Affection to your Highness Service, to pub∣lish this Relation of the Spanish Cruelties; where∣by all good men may see and applaud the Justness of Your Proceedings: Being confident that God, who

hath put this Great Designe into Your Hands, will also be pleased to give it a signal Blessing; which is the Prayer of
