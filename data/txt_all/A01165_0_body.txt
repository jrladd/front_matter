SIr, this Collected Historie, of the inconstant and mutable estate of Fraunce, from the yeare 1460. vntill the yeare 1595. describing the great battails of the French Nation, as well abroade with for∣raigne enemies, as at home among themselues, in their ciuill and intestine warres: also an ample de∣claration of the seditious and trecherous practi∣ses of that viperous brood of Hispaniolized Lea∣guers, during their bloodie mutinies and attempts from time to time, with whatsoeuer else so serious a discourse can or may affoord, I offer to your worshipfull and most kinde patronizing. Your euer knowne affable inclination to studie, and works of woorth, makes me no way mistrustfull of gentle acceptance: wherfore, in one ballance poysing the Booke, and in the other whatsoeuer remaynes in mee, alwayes most readie at your worships seruice, I cease from further troubling you with lines vrging no delight, desiring, that as your vertues are numberlesse, so your ioyes both in this worlde, and that to come, may likewise be endlesse.
