MOST RENOWMED AND EXCEL∣lent King, I haue been allured by questions which graue and wise men at sundry tymes did aske of me, to consider of many matters, and to knowe many thinges which I should not haue knowne, nor thought, if the same questions had neuer beene demaunded. For it was ne∣uer my profession, nor at any time haue I delighted to shoote in an Harchibuse, handegunne, or in any other small or great peece of Artillerie, nor doe intende to shoote heereafter in any of them, but one onely question which a skilfull Gunner in Anno Domini 1531. did aske of me in Verona, prouoked mee at that tyme to thinke therevpon, and by that occasion to finde out the order and proportion of shootes at markes neare hand, and also at markes far of, according to the variable eleuation of the peece which doth shoo∣te, whereof I should neuer haue had any care, if that Gunner had not with his saide question stir∣red mee vp to deale in the same. Moreouer in Anno Domini 1537. It was reported that So∣liman the Turkish Emperor made great preparation to war vppon the Christians, wherefore I did write and publishe in haste a short Treatise of shooting in Gunnes to the ende that my deuises in the same might bee considered of, seene, and prooued whether or no they would be profitable for the de∣fence of the Christians. And although my saide booke did no good, and that I also made little ac∣count thereof because as it happened the report of that war did afterwardes vade away like smeke, yet my saide booke made many wise men of great estimation, and also some of the common people, to trouble mee with other questions of Artillery, Pellets, Saltepeeter, and Powder, and to cause mee to enter againe into a deepe consideration of their saide particular questions, whereby I founde out and knowe (as I haue saide before) many thinges of which (except the same questions had bin asked of me) I should neuer haue had any Consideration or knowledge. After this, thinking with my selfe that hee who hath by knowledge, labour, or chaunce inuented any notable thing doth merite great blame if hee will not impart his deuise vnto others (for if all our forefathers had kept their knowledge secrete from vs, wee should at this time haue little differed from bruite beastes) I determined to be herein blamelesse, and to publish the same questions or inuentions, and for that pur∣pose haue now collected them out of one parte of my memoriall, in which I vse for my better re∣membraunce to write euery notable thing that I know. This collection is diuided into nine seuerall bookes according to the qualitie of the matter expressed in the same. And because I do remem∣ber that my Woorshipfull Gossippe M. Richad Ventuorth (who is one of your sacred Maiesties Gentlemen) hath tolde me of the noble courage, liberalitie, roialty, humanity, and clemencie which are in your Highnesse, and that your Excellencie delighteth much in all manner of warlike deuises, I am emboldened although I lacke the pithie eloquence and fine phraze of speech which is meete for you to heare, to offer and dedicate vnto your Maiestie the saide questions and my resolute An∣sweres vnto them, not as a conuenient thing for your Maiestie (for insomuch as the thinges of the most profoundest doctrine being expressed with eloquence and in a pure stile cannot come neere vnto the lowest steppe of your Highnesse, these our inuentions which are mecanicall and common things tolde and declared in a blunt and barbarous stile, may much lesse approch vnto the same) but I doe offer and dedicate my saide inuentions vnto you as nwe thinges according to a custome by which some vse at the beginning of the yeare to present vnto noble and honorable persons vnripeand sower fruites, not for that any goodnesse is in them, but for daintie and newe thinges which doe naturallie please mens mindes: whereby I am perswaded to thinke that though all my Inuentions shall not like you, yet some of them will delight you, which comming to passe as I desire, will embolden mee to attempt hereafter more greater matters. At your Ma∣iesties feete lying prostrate vppon the grounde with my head vncouered, and my handes ioyned togeather, I doe humblie recommend my selfe vnto your Highnesse.
