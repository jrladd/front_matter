YOur ancient loue to him that wrote this Booke,
Hath made Ourania speake an English verse,
The Greekish Ladies of Castalion Brooke,
Entombed are, close couch'd in Sable-herse.
The mourning Cypresse and darke Popler-tree,
Ae testimonies of their lowe degree.


Endymion lay's aside his Hebrew Reed,
And bids Ourania harpe Philosophie,
Whereof his English Lambs and flocke may feed,
Till Phoebus rayes dispell obscuritie.
He will'd her yet such pleasing Musicke sing,
As might conort with Aristotles wing.


Such as delights Arcadian Cynthia,
And comforts Schollers at their idle times,
Viewing the secrets of Ourania,
As she will chaunt them in her homely Rymes.
Wonders aboue, and all within this round,
Must be the subiect of her daintie sound.


Shee sings of Sunne and Moone, and wandring starres,
Of vncouth Elementall Meteors:
Comets, Heraulds of death and dreadfull warres,
Fire, ayre, winds, vapours, Ocean, showers,
And whatsoeuer you can thinke vpon,
Ourania sings: so bids Endymion.


Read learne, and heare, trie, ponder, write, digest,
Words, matter, song, truth, arte, wit▪ Misterie:
Commend Ourania: take her to your guest▪
Shee'l teach the yonger Lambs Philosophie,
Such Mysteries as neuer English Pen,
Afforded yet vnto the view of men▪
