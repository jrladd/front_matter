FOR AS MVCHE (RIGHTE HONORA∣ble)
as the office of man standethe chyefely in two
poyntes, the one, to serue God as he him selfe hathe
appointed, the other, truely to serue his countrey and
to wishe wel to the same in al that he mai, I thought
it good to turne into oure Englishe tonge: these two
Bokes folowing, therby to proffyte suche, as are not
of seruile spiryte, and when I had endyd the same, I beth oughte me of
some worthye patrone: to whom I moughte dedicate the effecte of my
smale trauayle in that behalfe, and discoursynge in my selfe of dyuerse
men, I thoughte your honor a very meete man to accepte my symple
present, not, for that I am your man, and you my very good lorde, and
Maister but, in respecte of those rare vertues whyche in your honour I
knowe to reste. Wherfore, my humble request is, that your lordshyppe
wyll take this my poore trauaile in good parte, which beinge graunted
maye be an occasyon to styrre me vp to take in hande here after, some
greatter matter. The one of these Bokes is writen in the Italian by Mai∣ster
Andre Cambine: a Citizen of Florence, which declareth frō whence
the Turckes came: when they fyrste came into the lesse Asia, of what
condition they were, the warres that they made and vpō what nations
they made them, the victories that they obtayned: and howe they vsed
them, & the whole meanes wherby they attained to that mightie seate
in the whiche they nowe sytte and commaunde, to the great dishonor
of the Christian princes. The other is a Commentarie wrytē also in the
Italian, by whom, I knowe not, for that the name of the auctor is sup∣pressed
but whatsoeuer he be that dyd it, he hathe deserued to be well
thoughte of for his trauayle, for it is well worthe the redding. It intrea¦tethe
of the warres betwene Amorathe the seconde, Mahomethe the se¦cond
his sonne, Emperours of Turckye, and the moste worthye prince
George Castrioth: otherwvse named Scanderbeg prince of Albania, in
the which Boke is euidently seen, to howe great purpose and effecte it
is to haue a Captaine of perfect iudgement, and a ouldiour of tryid dis¦ciplyne.
And for so much as I haue here occasion to speke of such know¦ledge
as makes a souldiour & I terme discipline I thincke it not encou∣uenient
some thinge to saye therof, not at large (for that it wyll suffi∣ciently
fyll a great volume) but briefely as I maye of so weightie mat∣ter.Of disci∣pline and wherin it concisteth
This disciplyne conteyneth in it, the whole force of the warres, the
roote therof is the perfecte iudgement of the Captaine the braunches
are these, the good choise of the newe souldiours, obedience of the soul¦diour,

the contynuall exercise of the souldiour, order, wherin the soul∣diour
must be instructed, furniture wherwith the souldiour must both
defend and offend, and then the seueritie of the Captaine in seinge this
discipline truely obserued and kept A. worthye generall is of that per∣fection
that he cā vse any of these in his kinde, and I desyre of god that
this disciplyne maye be better knowen in oure countre then it is, so
shall we not haue so manye as we haue: that shall saye, giue me the vn∣trayned
souldiour and take the trayned that lyste,The trai∣ned soul∣diour is to be prefar∣red to the vnskilful. of whose opinion I
for my parte nether am ne wylbe, for so muche as I thincke I shalbe a∣ble
to proue both in these oure daies and also in the olde worldes, that
the disciplined souldiour hath alwaye acheuid the great enterprise, the
vntrained hath often ben ouerthrowen, but seldome or neuer hath gy∣uen
ouerthrowe. And to proue this true: these men are redie whose na∣mes
doe here folowe (besyde the whole troupe of historiens els) Liuie,
Plutarcke Cesar Appian Alexandrine Valerius Maximus Vigetius, Blondus
Herodian, Paulus Iouius, & the Cōmentarie of George Castrioth as here af∣ter
more playnely shall appeare. I thincke these sufficient to perswade
anye man that is of a modest spirite in that behalfe. And for so muche
as this disciplyne is of so greate valewe I thincke it not vnitting or vn¦frutfull
to touche euery braunche briefely in particular, and fyrst I wyl
begynne with the electiō & choise of the newe souldiour, Sertorius
a worthy Romane who being the chiefe gouernour in Spaine after the
death or Silla,The choise of the soul¦diour and what is to be requi∣red therein and beinge a man of a noble corage and of great iudg∣ment
in Martiall affares (as Appian Alexandrine witnesseth of hym in
his fyrste Booke of the Ciuil warres of the Romanes) was not more ho¦nored
for anye of the rare vertues that were in hym ten for his greate
iudgement in the choyse of newe souldiours, his opinion was that the
youthe which shoulde be chosen to defend theyr countre shoulde dis∣cend
of honest parentes they shoulde be honestly broughte vp, they
shoulde be modest they shoulde also feare shame as wytnessyth Vige∣tius
in his fyrst Booke of the arte of the warres the, 7. Chapter, Plato that
noble Philosopher is of opinion that the newe souldiour must be cho∣sen
of the age of xx. yeres, Seruius Tullius kynge of the Romanes wolde
haue them chosen of the age of xvii. yeres, blando sayethe that others
are of opinion to chose them at xvi. yeres of age, Vigetius in his fyrste
Booke and iiii, Chapiter of the arte of the warres, is of opinion to chose
them whē their berde dothe fyrste showe, Saluste is of opiniō to chose
them yonge, for as muche as in their youthe they are apte to be taught
anye kynde of exercyse, and beinge acustumed in their youthe to great
trauayle, they shall the better when they comme to greater age, endure
the trauaile and miserie of the warres, he saieth also that it is better that
the souldiours wante yeres, then exercyse, moreouer, Vigetius saieth that
whatsoeuer they lerne in theyr youth dothe contynue longe in theyr
memorie perfectely. All these worthye men are of opinion, that yf he
be vntrayned and passe the age of thirtie yeres, he is not to be accepted

into a bande: for sondrie respects. This weighty charge to chose newe
souldiours, was not committed to any Captaine but to those that were
of greatest iudgement and best seen in the disciplyne of the warres, as
witnesseth Vigetius in his first Boke and vii. chapter.
NOwe as touching the obedience of the souldiour,The obe∣dience of the soul∣diour. the histories
are full howe greate skyll is in it, for what was the cause of the
deathe of Pompey and defeicte or ouerthrowe of his Populous armie
in Thesaly, was it not onelye disobedience? loke Cesare in his third
Booke and Appian in his seconde Booke of the Gyuyll warres of the
Romanes. Hathe not disobedience ben also the deathe of dyuerse Ro∣mane
Emperours and almost the distruction of the whole Empire, loke
Herodian and there you shall see the profe hereof This obedience is a
bande that byndeth the rest of the braunches of disciplyne so firmely
togyther, that it maketh them to worcke theyr effecte and gyueth ver¦tue
& power to euery of them. Wherfore Andre Cambine iustly doth
saye, that a disobedient armie is lesse to be feared, them a worthy Cap∣tayne
withoute an armie.
THe worthye men of the olde worlde and chiefely the Romanes:The exer∣cyse of a souldiour.
broughte vp their souldiours in sondrie exercyses, as to runne, lepe
throwe the bare, swyme, to vse their weapons, to marche the march
called Passo militare, which was to goe armed in the hotest of the som¦mer
xx. myles in fyue houres, and vpon great occasion: xxiiii. myles in
foure houres, they had a feelde which laye vpon the syde of the Ryuer
Tibre which once was of the possessiō of Tarquinus surnamed the proud
and when he was banished Rome, the Senate appointed that feelde for
the exercyse of theyr souldiours, there were in that feelde a number of
greate stakes depely set into the grounde, against whom the souldiours
hauing their roundels made of wicker of the double weighte of those
whiche they shoulde were in battayle and a staffe of the lengthe of a
sworde and of the double weyghte of the sworde whiche commonly
they dyd weare, and beinge thus furnished they shoulde dayly fyghte
against those stakes as against their enemyes. In this feelde dyd they
vse all theyr exercyses, wherof I spake before and when they were we∣ry
they went into the Riuer and washed them, and refreshed theyr we¦ried
bodies and lerned to swime, as wytnesseth Vigetius in his fyrst Boke
and x. Chapter. To swymme wel is and exercise very commodiouse for
a souldiour, as for example Liure in his fyrst Decade and seconde Boke
declareth that Oratius Cocleus a worthy Romane,Suimming Necessarie defended the ende of
the brydge that putteth ouer Tiber, against the whole power of the
kinge Porsena whilest that they of the Citie brake the bridge behinde
him, and then (armed as he was) he leapte into the Ryuer from the
brydge and dyd swymme to the lande, and saued both him selfe & the
Citie for that tyme. Also the noble Emperour Iulius Cesare beinge in
Alexandrie and assayled vpon the sudden by the Alexandrines (and ha∣uing
but fewe of his people with him) was enforced to flee their furie

whervpon he lepte into the Ryuer and dyd swyme ouer: to the other
side, by the which meanes he saued his life at that present, as witnesseth
Appian Alexandre in his seconde Booke of the cyuyll warres of the
Romanes, and also Aulus Hirtius in his fourthe Booke of the Commen∣taries
of Cesar intitled de Bello Alexandrino the lyke dothe the same
Aulus Hirtius declare in the aforesayde Booke, of the Phritanes, whiche
dwelled in an Isle that standeth in the Ryuer Nilo eyghte hūdred pases
from Alexandrie, which beinge assailed by the souldiours of Cesare and
put to flyghte, toke the Ryuer and did swyme to Alexandrie and saued
a great number of theyr lyues. The exercise of the souldiour and chiefe¦ly
of the vse of the weapon that he shall vse in the feelde is a thinge of
great valewe,The vse of the wea∣pon. whiche the Romanes dyd so muche esteme that they ap∣pointed
a number of Maisters to instructe theyr souldiours in the vse
therof, and euery Maister had double the entertaynement that a soul∣diour
had, as witnesseth Vigetius in his firste Booke and xii. chapter, and
in my iudgement not withoute great reason, for the felde is not the on¦lye
place to traine souldiours in but they must also be made perfecte in
the vse of theyr weapon in marching in theyr armour, acustumed to or¦der
and such lyke exercyses, before they cōme to the felde, otherwyse
they be but an encoraging to the enemy and a people led to the slaugh¦ter,
wherfore the Romanes had their newe souldiours as perfecte in al¦theyr
exercyses as were theyr olde souldiours (before they wolde send
them to the felde) sauing in that that they had not seen the enemy nor
felte of his force.
An other braunche therof is of importance,The ne∣cessitie of Armour. which is furniture with
oute the which no army is perfecte, for yf a man be neuer so valiante &
well trayned yf he wante furniture he wyll not put him selfe in that
peryll that he wyll doe beinge well armed and furnished. As longe as
the Romanes went wel armed and furnished to the felde their Empire
dyd alwaye florishe as witnesseth Vigetius in his first Boke and xx. chap¦ter,
but whē they became slouthfull and neglected discipline, they then
obtayned of their Emperours within shorte space license to goe to the
felde first withoute their body Armour, & then withoute their sheldes
and hedpeces, and when they had obtained at theyr Emperours handes
these noble demaundes, within shore space after they payd well for
their case, the Gothes & Vandales, and also the Lombardes made warres
vpō them & gaue them sondrie ouerthrowes. Then was the difference
seen betwyne the armie broughte vp in disciplyne and that wherein dis¦ciplyne
was not knowen, betwine the exercised souldiour and the vn∣exercised,
betwine the instructed souldiour and the ignorant, betwine
the armed souldiour & the vnarmed, & betwyne the Captaine of iudg∣ment
and the vnskylfull Captaine, for where as in tyme before the Ro¦manes
(dwelling vnder discipline) were not onely able to defend their
owne most ample dominions: but also that of their fryndes which laie

fardest from them: nowe, when they had reiected discipline (hauinge
warres with these nationes afore named) they were not onely vnable
to defend their owne dominions: but also to defend their Citie Rome
which was twyse or thriese sacked by the aforesayd enemies, as wyt∣nesseth
Carian in his historie.
There is also order,Order, of great im∣portance. which is of great value, and withoute it an armie
is but a confused multitude, nether any battayle is worthily fought no
towne perfectly besegyd, nor any thing well done. This the auncient
Romanes had in suche estimation, that whosoeuer dyd violate it, was
pūnished withoute remissiō, as for example Valerius Maximus in his se∣cond
Boke declareth: that Posthumius Tibutius being dictator, & hauing
with him in the warres his onely sōne the only successiō that he had,
whō he had very tenderly & carefully brought vp, yet forasmuch as he
being in the warres did (of him selfe & not by his cōmaūdemēt) take
those bands which the Romāes called aides, or helppes, & encoūtred the
enemies & gaue them a great ouerthrowe, & thē retorned to the campe
with the victorie, as sone as he came to his father, he commaunded to
strike of his hed,Examples of strange punnishe∣ments for breche of order. so carefull was he to se order obserued that he prefer∣red
it before the life of his sonne, the contynuance of his house and all
that euer he possessyd in the worlde. The like did Posthumius Torquatus
(beinge Consul) to his sonne in the warres of Italie, who gaue battayle
to the enemies withoute commaundement from his father, defeicted
them, and slewe a great number of them, and alson toke from them a
maruelous riche spoile and retorned with the victorie, yet at his retorne
his father commaunded the offycers to take him, and so was he execu∣ted.
Also Papirus the dictator did marueloussy embrace order. And whē
he made warres against the Sānites, he had with him general of the
horsemen Q. Fabius Rutilianus, who seing his enemy in battaile charged
him, ouerthrewe the Samnites, and retorned with the victorie, yet not∣withstandinge,
Papirus respected not the victorie, his vertue, his force,
nor yet his house, but commaunded him to be spoyled of his garmen∣tes
and to be beaten naked with roddes, a maruelouse straunge yghte,
to se Q. Rutilianus, generall of the horsemen, a man of great worthynes
victorious, to be beaten naked and to haue hys fleshe torne by the
handes of the Iusticiers and also hys bloude shed, and althoughe
the souldiours desyred Fabius to flee to Rome, where in vayne he
made request to the Senate for pardon, Papirous perseuered in pun∣nishinge
hym and wolde in no wyse for gyue it, the father of
Fabius (who had been Dictaour, and thre tymes Consul) was
enforced to comme in humble sorte to declare the matter to the
people, desyrynge them to craue the aide of the Tribunes in the

behalfe of his sonne, yet notwithstanding Papirus perseuerid styll in his
purpose, tyll at the last (being desyred by the Citizens, the Tribunes &
people) he sware that he wolde forgiue it, not for the loue of Fabio, but
for the loue that he bare to the office of the Tribunes, and to the peo∣ple
of Rome, this Ordre directe the euery braunche of this disciplyne &
maketh them to worcke their effecte. What shoulde I saye anye more
of order, the histories are full of the nedefulnes therof.
Besyde thse there is also seueritie which causeth the souldiours to
dwell in obedience, it chaseth all disorder from them, it hath ben exe∣cuted
in all ages,Seueritie in punish∣ment very expedient. Cesar that worthy Emperour whose naturall inclina¦tion
to pardone offences was suche, that I doe preferre his cotezie be∣fore
them al that I haue redde of, yet you shal see in his commentaries
that he vpon occasyon hath taken the tenthe man of his legiones and
put them to deathe, also Vallo a famous and worthye Captayne who
hath wryten very substancially thre Bookes of the arte of the warres
exhorteth all men of charge, to be seuere when occasion dothe re∣quire,
for one or two sometime punished doe saue great numbers from
distruction. Wherfore Vallo in his first Boke, and third chapter, willeth
that he that disobeythe his Captaine, he that dothe mutine, he that be∣ynge
appointed to the stand watche or scoute doth leue his place with
oute license of his Captaine, or he that departeth from his enseigne in
the felde withoute leue of his Captayne shall not onely lose horse, ar∣mour,
weapones and all that he possessyth in the warres, and so escape
the punishment, but he shall be condempned to deathe and shall passe
the pikes in maner as foloweth. There shalbe a squadrone ordered and
in the myddest of the same shalbe a voyde space throughoute the squa∣drone
almost as brode as the lengthe of two pykes,The order of passing the pikes then shall the of∣fendour
be broughte into the middest therof and before that they shal
abase theyr pykes, he vpon hys kneese shall demaunde pardone at hys
Captaynes hand thre tymes and at the thyrde tyme the Captayne shall
take the enseigne from his enseigne berer vndispaide, taking the hed
therof in his hand and with the but ende therof shall stryke hym on
the hed in token that the nseigne throughe his euell behauiour hathe
ben in peryll, and dishonored, and that he dothe condempne him there
to die, that done, the Captaine withdraweth him selfe oute of the place
then the souldiours abase theyr pykes and sley him.
Also Selim faher to Solyman Emperour of Turchie, beinge at Ico¦nio
(after that he had broughte his armye oute of Persia) determyning
there to winter for that he wolde be at hand to vndertake the enter∣prise
in the spring nexte folowing against the Sophie, wherevpon hys
Gianizzaries being desirous to passe that winter in Grecia made request
(at the perswasion of some of their leaders) to Selim that they mought
goe into Gretia that wynter, and when they sawe that they coulde not
obtayne, they rebelled against theyr lorde, wherevpon Selim disguysed

sent into Spayne to make warres vpon the Numantianes and to daunt
theyr prowde spirites which were puffed vp throughe the wante of vn¦derstanding
of the Romane counsulles and legates whiche had made
warres against them and receaued dyuerse ouerthrowes at their handes
Scipio receaued the same armye which they had so often defeicted, and
as sone as he had possessed this army,What kind of people are to be banished oute of an armie or campe. he forthewith purged it of all vn¦profytable
people: such as procured men to delicacie, as those that solde
all kinde of Marchandize and delicate meates and drincks, such as were
rather to satisfie appetite then to preserue helthe and maintaine force, al¦so
he banished from his campe two thousand whres whē he had this
done he restored to tbe armye perfite discipline and then beseged the
Citie of Numantia, toke it and brought it into ashes.
The lyke may be sayd of Metellus, who being Consul made warres
in Affricke against Iugurthe he receaued his armie of Spurius Albinuus
throghe whose negligence and want of vnderstanding, discipline was
clerely extincte and forgotten: and the armye vtterly corrupted through
ease and delicatie, by meanes wherof the enemy obtained against them
many victories.Other en∣ormities r¦dressed by Metellus. And the consul determyning to purge his armie and to
restore it to perfecte disciplyne, remoued from his campe all Tauerners
and cookes, he wolde not suffer that any priuate souldiour shulde haue
any horse or seruante to carye his armour and victuall but that he hym¦selfe
shoulde carrie it, then he marched with his campe and remoued in
maner daily & fortified his campe & entrenched it as strongly, as yf Iu∣guith
had ben present, also he sawe them daily exercised acordīg to the
order of the Romane disciplyne, and in the ende brought them to that
perfection, that to that same enemy (of whom they had receaued many
ouerthrowes in tyme before and neuer coulde giue any) they gaue son¦drie
and great ouerthrowes and triumphed ouer him as witnesseth the
aforesaid Valerius. Besyde these, Appian Alexandrine in his fourth Boke
of the cyuyll warres of the Romanes: doth righte well declare the price
and necessite of the Iudgemēt of the Captaines in the persones of Bius
and Cassius, who fled oute of Rome after that they had slayne Cesar, and
throughe theyr wysedome and policie gatherid togyther wythin the
space of two yeres: an armie of xx. legions of foremē, and of xx M. horse
men, a legion acording to the opinion of Liuie,What a le∣gion i. had in it the number of
fyue thousand foure hundred souldiours and acording to the mynde of
Vigetius it was of the number of syxe thousand and some tyme of grea∣ter
number besyde this they had a Nauie of two hundred great shippes
at the leaste, they were thorowly furnished with all kinde of Muniti∣on
and well prouided of money, this had they brought to passe in the
space of two yeres hauing Octauius surnamed Angustus, Marcus Antonius &
Marcus Lepidus to enemyes, who then gouerned in the triumuirate at
Rome, and dyd contynually persecute them with warres by all meanes
possyble as the aforesaid auctor plainly doth declare. Also they brought

vnder their gouernaunce all the countres euen from Macedonia to the
floodde Euphrates, besyde these examples the histories are full of the
praises of worthy generalles, but by the way I wolde not that any man
shoulde thincke that I doe so greatly honor the iudgement of the gene¦rall:
that I wolde therby condempne discipline in anye respecte in the
which I wolde haue the souldiour broughte vp and trained, but I doe
thincke it as requisite that the generall with his chiefe officers of the
armie, be of iudgment sufficient to directe the vse of this disciplne, as it
is for the souldiours to be brought vp and instructed therin, and the ar∣mie
that wanteth eyther of them: to witt the disciplined souldiour and
the generall of iudgment is not perfecte, nor sufficient to take any great
enterprise in hand.
There is nothing more proffytable nor mete to bring a generall to
this perfection then to adde to his experience the reding of histories in
the which he shall se plainly set before his eyes in what order battailes
haue ben foughte, ouerthrowes gyuen, victorie vsed, countres defended
and conquestes made, wherfore if the generall with his chiefe officers
wante this perfection they are not greatly to be feared althoughe their
armi be of trained souldiours. Furthermore their is nothing more to be
embraced by a worthy generall, then modesty, and there is nothinge
more peryllous in a Generall then to be ambitious rashe and wilfull, as
for example at the battayle of Canua,A generall must be void of am¦bition and rashenes. as plutarck declareth in the second
part of his lyues: in the lyfe of Fabius Maximus and also of Aniball, howe
that both the Romane consulles were there pesent the one was Paulus
Emitius a man of great iudgment and worthynes in armes, the other
was Caius Terentius Varro a vaine and wylfull man, full of ambition, glo¦ry,
& boasting. This Terentius coulde not be contentid to gouerne ioint¦ly
with his companion and to vse mutual councell, but wolde haue the
gouernement deuided and wolde gouerne euery other daye absolutely
to auoide contēcion Paulus Emilius graunted thervnto Emilius sawe
howe to chase Aniball oute of Italie withoute hazarding of any one
battayle and therfore he determyned to prolong the warres, and seinge
Anibal in a straunge countre, in great extremitie throughe want of vic∣tualles,
his armie being of many nations he was assured by these mea∣nes
to enforce him to abandone Italie for that tyme, contraryly, Teren¦tius
(being a mā of smale iudgment in Martiall affares) did taunte blame
and openly spake euill,Terentius wilful and withoute skill. of that noble man Emilius, hauing no respecte at
all to his worthynes and wisdome but sayde it was great shame to see
the enemy daily in battayle and the Romanes to lye idle within theyr
campe, not weing what it was that constrained the enemy so to doe
wherfore whē he had brought to passe that he mought gouerne euery
other day, Anibal being newly comme with his army to Canua and
there lodged and the Romanes beyng lodged vpon both sydes of the
Ryuer Asido, nowe called ofanto not farre from him as sone as hys

daye came, in the morning by the rising of the sunne he caused to set vp
on the heighte of his tente a token to signifie that he wolde gyue bat∣tayle
which the Italianes call Veste militare, this did he directly against
the wyll of his companion, when Aniball sawe this he was excedyng
glade for it made well for his purpose: for he was in great extremetie
throughe wante of victuall, Terentius had double the number of soul¦diours
that Aniball had. His souldiours were well trayned and broughte
vp in discipline whom he put in ordre and gaue battayle, the horse of
Emitius was slayne vnder him and he foughte on fote lyke a noble man
when Terentius sawe his people like to be ouerthrowē he fledde Emi¦tius
lyke a noble man foughte contynually,Emilius most vali∣ante, and coragious. tyll at the laste, seing the Ro¦manes
all slayne and fled, he sate him downe vpon a stone, being full of
woundes and embrued with bloude that no man dyd knowe him tyll
at the laste Cornelius Lentulus a noble yonge man came by him & knew
him, he lighted immediatly from his horse aud desyred him to lepe on
and to saue him selfe for the loue of his Citizens who had great nede of
so worthy a Captaine as he was,His aun∣swere to Lentulus before his death. but he aunswered not so O Lentulus,
but commaūded him to lepe to horse and said declare vnto Fabius Maxi∣mus
and also be thou witnesse howe that Paulus Emilius hath obserued
his councell euen to the laste of his lyfe and hath not broken one iote
of the promes that he made vnto him, and that he was not ouercomme
onely by Aniball, but also by Terentius, and with suche commendations
he licensed Lentulus, and then he fell downe amonge the ded bodyes &
gaue vp the spirit. Here was seen to the great hindrance of the Romane
Citie the difference, betwyne the modestie of Emilius and the arogancie
of Terenrius, Liuie saith that in this battayle there were slayne xl. M fote
men and two thousand seuen hundred horsemen, pollibie declareth of a
great number but trueth it is that the Romanes nether in the fyrst nor
seconde warres of the Carthagvnenses receaued a greatter ouerthrowe
then this, for so muche as Emilius the Cousul a man of great worthines
and vertue redi in all doutes towarde his countre with Seruilius whiche
was Consul the yere before, and a number of worthye Citizens eles,
who had byn Consulles, pretors Tribunes, Ediles and inche lyke, were
there slayne.
The lyke happened in Puglia and other tyme: Fabius Maximus be∣ing
then dictator, Anibal determyned to winter with his army in a Ci∣tie
named Glereon, a Citie of great welthe Fabius encamped as neare
him as he mought conueniently, and being called to Rome (for sondrie
great affares of the common welthe) lefte his armie vnder the conducte
of Marcus Minutius with expresse commaundement nether to assayle
the enemye ne yet to gyue battayle in anye wyse. It happened after the
departure of the dictator a squadrone of the enemies to goe forthe into
the countre for corne, Minutius hearing of it brake the commaūdemēt
of the dictator & marched forth with certaine bādes & encountred the

enemy and chased them home to theyr very lodginges & flewe a great
number of them, the bruite of this came fleeing to Rome, and forthe∣with
it was holdē for a great victorie, & immediatly the people wold
nedes that the gouernement shoulde be equally deuided betwene Fa∣bius
and Minurius: a thinge or that tyme neuer seen, Fabius endured al
these thinges patiently and retorned to his campe, they were then two
dictators, Minutius throughe this lytle sparke of good happe, dyd clene
forget him selfe and toke vpon him withoute the aduise of Fabius to
giue battaile which Anibal (being often victorious) durste scarcely doe
Minutius being an arrogante,Note the arrogancie and wilful¦nes of Mi∣nutius. ambitious and prowde man, and not of
great iudgment in the discipline of the warres caused Fabius to stand in
great doute, lest that he being thus excidingly puffed vp in pride shulde
take in hand some matter that mought greatly hurte the cōmon welth
wherfore he came to Minutius and deuided with him the armye, thinc
king it better for him to gouerne only some parte of the army then cō¦fusedly
with his insolent companion to gouerne the whole. Whervpō
he toke to him the first and fourth part of the Romane souldiours and
gaue to Minutius the second and third part the lyke dyd he by the soul¦diours
that they cal aydes, when Minutius sawe him self dictator equal
with Fabius and that he had an armie at his commaundement, he was
in great triumphe, Fabius badde him to take hede and to confider that
nowe it was not with Fabius that he must haue to doe, but with Ani∣ball,
and vpon this Fabius caused his drommes and trompetts to sound
and marched oute of the campe and went to a grounde that he lyked
and there encamped with his people.
Anibal vnderstanding of this, approched neare to them both and en¦camped
in a ground of strength and had betwene him and his enemies
grounde very apte to ambushe his people in, and when he sawe Minu∣tius
deuided from Fabius he thought it good to present the battayle to
Minutius and in the night ordained and placed his ambushes and ap∣pointed
them a signe at the which they shoulde salie. When the daye
came he sent certaine bands to take a hill not far from Minutius to pro¦uoke
him to battayle, Minutius forthwith: sent forthe his lighte armed
men and attached the scaramoche and seing Anibal to supplie frō tyme
to tyme (with freshe bandes) those souldiours that he had sent to take
the hll he put his whole armie in order, and marched forth and ioyned
with the enemy in battaile, the fyght was cruel, the Carthaginenses re∣tired
and fought contynually vntyll such time as they had drawne him
past their ambushes, then Aniball gaue his sygne, wherpon the ambu∣shes
discouered them selues and assayled the Romanes behinde them
with great rumor, noyse, and slaughter, when Minutius torned him and
sawe the disorder that was amonge his people, and his Captaines fleing
he soughte to saue hym selfe also by flyghte, whervpon the Nu∣midan
horsemen folowed the chase, and made great slaughter of the

disorderid Romanes.
When Fabius sawe the Romanes in this extremitie, the which he
suspected in the begynning of the battayle he went to a certayne place
from whence he mought beholde the whole mattet and seing the Ro∣manes
gathered in the middest of their enemies strake his hand vpō his
thyghe and with a great sighe sayd in the presence of al those that were
with him, O Hercule, sōner then I wolde haue wished & not so sone as
he him selfe wolde, Minutius hath vndone him selfe and his, whervpon
he commaunded his armie to marche and said O souldiours whosoeuer
doth nowe thincke vpon Minutius let him make hast and consider that
he is a worthy man one that loueth his counte,Fabius ex∣ortation to his soul∣diour. and although it hath
not happned (acording to his desyre) that he moughte put the enemies
to flyght we shall here after haue time to blame him for it. Then he en¦countred
the Numidianes, charged them, and put them to flyght and
marched on and encountred those that were laide in ambushe in the
nyght and assayled the Romanes behynd them in the battayle, he slewe
them that the reste of the Carthagtnenses seyng this, began to fle.
When Anibal sawe his people fle and Fabius a farre of very fierce¦ly
amōge the Carthagynenses, he left of any furder executing of the Ro¦manes
and commaunded to sound to the standard and then retorned to
his lodginge and suffred the Romanes to passe to their campe withoute
any further slaughter, & it is said that beīg at his lodging & talking of Fa¦bius
he said haue not I often times told you that yonder mist that laie al¦way
vpō the hill wolde make vs one day very foule wether. I haue this
day ouercome Minutius and Fabius hath ouercome me. When the bat∣taile
was ended Fabius cōmaūded his souldiours to take the spoyle of the
ded enemyes, and then retorned to his campe, and notwithstanding this
great victorye he neuer caste in the tetle of his companion his euill
gouernement.
When Minutius came to his campe, he spake to his souldiours in
this sorte. My companions in armes, there is nothing more peryllous to
a man then to fayle in gerat matters:Minutius acknow∣ledgethe his folly. and whē he seith his owne default
it is the part of a wise mā to obey vnto him that hath giuē him good
admonition & althoughe that I haue good occasiō to be offended with
fortune, yet I must confesse that I am much bounde to her, for that she
hath gyuen me to vnderstand euē in an instante that I not beyng able
to commaunde others, shoulde submitte my selfe to the rule of others.
Wherfore let vs goe to the fyrst dictator and render hym thancks and I
promyse you that I wyll be the fyrst, both to thancke him and to yelde
him obedience, when he had thus spoken, he commaunded to take
downe the Egles which were the banners of gouernement and mar∣ched
with them to the lodgings of Fabius and being comme to the mar¦ket
place, he went streight to his tent and there dyd set vp the Egles
with great noyses and when Fabius came forth of his tent he came &

called him father, and his suldiours saluted the souldiours of Fabius by
the name of patrones or Maisters. When silence was commaunded Mi∣nutius
sayd to Fabius thou hast in one instante obtayned two victories
thou hast ouercomme thyne enemye by force and thy companion by
counsell and cortezie, wherfore I maye iustly call the most worthy fa∣ther,
who hath saued both me and my people & then serued vnder him
as generall of the horsemen as before.
Hereby it appereth that where thinges shall take good effecte▪ it
must nedes be that the souldiours be broughte vp in discipline and that
the generall be able to iudge of discipline, as for example liuie in hys
thirde Boke of his fyrst decade dothe well declare that it was not onely
an armie of trained souldiours: that dyd ouerthrowe the people called
Volsci and Equi, but that also the consules & chiefe officers of the felde
were of great iudgement, whose good order dyd not à litle preuaile in
that behalfe. Besyde this it was not only an armie of trained souldiours
that discomfyted the Samnites not farre from the Citie Suessola, where
they slewe an exceding great number of them and toke. 40. thousande
sheldes which were of the men that were slaine, and also. 170. standardz
Cornetts, and Euseignes as wytnesseth Liuie in his vii. Booke of his first
decade, but that also the Iudgement of the Consul dyd muche preuayle
in that behalfe, who when he sawe the great number of his enemies, cō¦maunded
his souldiours to holde them within his campe, whervpō the
Samnites presuming, contēned the enemie., and neglicted order, and dis¦persed
them selues all the countrey ouer to prouyde them of corne and
other victualles, and lefte theyr campe vngarded in effecte, which when
the consul vndestode he exhorted the souldiours to behaue them vali∣antly
and immediatly went forth of his campe and assayled the campe
of his enemyes, and in the first charge he slewe the greatest number of
them as they were in their tentes and lodgings, and then commaunded
to set all theyr Cornetts, Enseignes and standardz, vpon the trenches of
theyr campe which he had taken from them, and then lefte for the
gard of the campe two legions, with commaundement that on payne
of death no man shoulde take any thing of the spoyle of the campe vn¦tyll
his retorne, whervpon he marched on with his armye in order to∣warde
the enemy and sent his horsemen before him, who charged, the
negligent and vnprouided enemyes being dispersed all ouer the felde
and vtterly destitute of order so that they fled with great confusiō and
feare, not knowing whyther it were best to fle, whē this was done the
counsul retorned to the campe with great victorie, and then gaue the
spoyle of the campe of the enemyes to his souldiours. In lyke sort was
the perfecte order of L. Scipion counsul: no lesse helpfull to his armye
when that he defeicted the mitghty army of Antioche kyng of Asia vp
on the Ryuer Phrigio neare to the Citye Magnesia as wytnessyth Liui
in his fourth decade and vii. Booke. And in lyke sorte dyd the indgemēt

of Alexādre the great helpe his souldiours ī the battayle that he fought
with Darius in the which with a smale number of trained souldiours
he defeicted 6. hundred thousand Persians as witnesseth Blondo in his
x booke de La institution de La chose publique. In the lyke sorte was
the iudgment of T. Quintius Flaminius helpful to his trained atmie whē
he dyd ouerthrowe Philippe the Macedone prince, besyde Scotusa in
Gretia, slewe viii. thousands of his souldiours and toke fyue thousand of
them prisoners as witnessyth Plutarck in his Boke called the seconde
part of his lyues, in the lyfe of the same Flaminius.
Besyde this it was not onely the continuall exercise and disciplyne
of the souldiours of Scanderbeg that gaue vnto the Turckes so manye
ouerthrowes as are declared in his Commentaries, althoughe they were
becomme throughe their continuall exercise as it were inuincible but
his great iudgement in the arte of the warres was a greate parte of the
cause therof, for he knewe when and howe to take the aduantage of
his enemye
Also to cōme to oure age in the battayle that Frauncys the fyrst of
that name Frenshe king, fought at Marignian with the Suysses where
great skyll and valiantize was showed on both partes, yet was not the
victorie wonne alone throughe the discipline of the souldiours but al∣so
throughe the iudgement of the conductours. The lyke may be sayd
of the battayle that the Countie de Augimen fought at Serizoles wyth
the Marques of Guasto in the yere of oure Lord. 1544 The lyke of the
battayle of Pauie betwyne the aforesayd Frenshe kinge and the Duke
of Burbone lieutenante of the Imperiall armie. Also the lyke, of the bat¦tayle
betwyne Charles the fyrst: and the Duke Iohn of Saxon, the Lans∣graue
of esse in Almaigne. What shulde I saye any more to proue this
to be true, the histories doe all affyrme that the vnderstandinge of the
generall doth greatly helpe to the obtayning of the victorie, and with∣oute
it a trayned armie is but as a man mayned in comparison of a mā
that hath all his līmes soūd and perfecte, and of all the victories that I
haue here spoken of, and also of all those that I haue red of, besydes
those that I haue seen, I haue not founde one gyuen by vntrayned soul¦diours.
Wherfore no armie may be called perfecte that wanteth these
two kindes of men in it which is the general of perfecte iudgement &
the souldiour brought vp in discipline.
Vigetius sayeth in his .28 chapiter of his fyrste Booke of arte of the
warres that the Epirotes and Macedonines people of great power, ador¦ned
with many victories and also the Thesalique nation who brought
vnder theyr yoke the Persians euen to the confynes of India, besydes
these Lacedemonies, Athenies Marsians and Samnites, The Datianes,
Medes and Thratianes which were so warlike that it was sayd amonge
them that Mars (whom the hethen call the god of battayle) was borne
in theyr countre, all these nations dyd the Romanes (throughe their per¦fecte

discipline) bring vnder theyr rule.
Also Vigetius saithe in his fyrst Boke and fyrst chapter of the arte of
the warres,The beni¦fite of dis∣cipline. that the great number of the Frenshe shoulde haue denou∣red
the smale number of the Romanes, had not ben theyr discipline on¦ly,
besydes that it had not ben possyble for the Romanes to haue resys∣ted
the populouse & mighty nations of the Germanes but only by theit
disciplin, moreouer they shulde not haue ben able to encoūtte the lustie
& puisante nations of Spaine had not ben their discipline, yea by what
meanes preuailed they against the wise and welthy Affricanes, but on∣ly
throughe discipline, by what meanes brought they vnder yoke the
mighty and subtill nation of Grekes, but only by their discipline. The
noble Emperour Frederick Barberouse being entred Italie with his ar∣mie
to chastize the Millaneses for their rebellion, wolde in no wise of∣fer
warre to his enemies vntill his souldiours had fworne vnto him to
obserue the discipline of the warres. Paulus Iouius saith that the Hungari∣ans
so longe as they dyd obserue discipline were well able to defende
their owne & gaue the Turcks sondrie ouerthrowes, Valius Maximus
in his second Boke calleth discipline not only, the foundatiō of the Ro¦mane
Empire, but also the preseruatiō & maintenance of the same, for
in dede it is a harde matter to ouerthrowe a worthy generall, hauinge
an armie of well chosē souldiours, obedient, well exercised in the feates
afore mēcioned & doe knowe what the weapons are worthe that they
beare being well furnished, and well instructed in order knowing the
cōmoditie therof so longe as in battayle they doe obserue it, for it is an
impossibilitie to gyue any great ouerthrowe we to mē that obserue their
order in the which they are plased & doe vse their weapons according∣ly.
Wherfore I wishe al men of honest spirites to seke to vnderstand the
effecte of this discipline, for it doth as muche & more helpe to the ob∣taining
of victorie, then doth the greatnesse of the number as Ceser, Ap¦pian,
Vigetius & Plutarcke, chiefly doe declare. Peraduēture some mā wil
say, why sir we nede not this discipline wherof you speke: we can haue
for oure money straungers which are good souldiours to serue vs whē
we nede. But such as are of that opinion I wishe to rede the histories &
Chronicles of Fraunce,The incō∣moditie that com∣meth by the seruice of staun∣gers. for Fraunce hath well felte the cōmoditie of the
seruice of staungers, which nether serue for honor of their countre &
prince, ne yet for their wiues, children, goodes & possessions, but they
seke onely to leade the warres at length & to make their ptoffytt of it,
beside this I thincke it not inconuenient to showe an example or two
of the good seruice of straungers, Mounser de Lautrec, being in Italie
generall of the Frenshe armie at the sege of Pauie, the Suissers came vn¦to
him and required him eyther to gyue them license to repare home in
to their coūtre, or els to goe & encountre the enemies, for they wolde
no lengar tarrie in Italie, whervpon fearinge that the Suissers shoulde
leaue him, he was enforced to goe & encoūtre the enemy, in the which

ncountre he was ouerthrowē beside Mylan at a village called the Pico
ue, & all his armie put to flight as witnesseth paradyne in his first Boke
of his historie.
The lyke dyd Andre Dorie at the sege of Naples being in the paie of
he Frenshe king & in his seruice at the seege before Naples and kepte
heir victualles and reliefe from them whervpon they furnished the Na¦ie
of the towne & then the chiefe princes & rulers of the towne em∣arcked
them selues & went and gaue battayle to the sayd Dore,Andre Dorie. and af¦er
longe fyght, Dorie obtained the victorie & toke prisoners the prince
of Orenge the Marques of Guasto, Camile, Colona, cardo, and a gentle
man of Spaine named Gogna, he slewe two worthy Captaines Feramus
a and Gabone & toke thre Galleys from the enemies after this he lefte
he seruice of the Frenshe king & caried with him his Galleys and the
prisoners that he had taken & went and serued the Emperour & imme¦diatly
set his prisoners at libertie, & the Emperour gaue him the prin∣cipalitie
of Melphe with dyuerse other castls & lordshipes. The like did
he Marques Brandenburge,Marques Brande whē he departed frō the seruice of Henry
he Frenshe king, caried not he the Duke Domerle with dyuerse others
prisoners with him. Also to comme to oure warres when the towne of
Haddington in Scotland was holden for oure king Edwarde the vi. did
not the Almaignes Mutyne there,Hading∣ton. and put them selues in armes against
s, which (yf the enemies had vnderstode) mought haue ben the losse of
the towne. Let these fewe examples fuffyse for this tyme, and although
that I haue in this litle preface briefely touched the worthynes of dis∣cipline,
yet am I well assured that victorie commeth not onely by it,
but by the gyfte of God, wherfore I must saie with Saincte Paull,1 Cor. 3. Paull
planteth. Appollo watreth, but god giueth the encrease, euē so, the Gene¦rall
commaundeth, the souldiours obey but God gyueth the victorie,
wherfore, let all men seke to knowe him, and serue him as he him selfe
hath appointed, and then shall all thinges goe well with them.
