THE common course of mans life (most ventrous and no less Worshipful Knight) and their daily dealings, doe manifestly declare how variable they be, how wandring, how wavering, how un∣certain and unconstant; if Fortune, or rather God (to speak Christian-like) by blessing them as abundantly, so extraordinarily, and raising them, tanquam è pulvere & luto, advance them to promotion. And no marvel though this be incident to the manners of men, seeing that Nature her self in this point offendeth. For what is he, unless he be mortified, that is not naturally of an aspiring minde? Imitating herein the property of the Ivie, which never ceaseth climbing by degrees, Donec ipsam summitatem attigerit, till it be come to the very top. This fault being general, and hate∣ful in the judgement, specially of the wise, might seem so much the more tollerable, if that men placed in preheminence, and sitting like Hills over-looking the Valleys below, with their high calling and stately authority, had agreeable hearts. But some notwithstanding their state be singular, and indeed such as that they may sit down, take their ease, and say, Hic ter∣minus esto, do carry so base a mind, as that if I should compare them to Aesops Cock, preferring a Barley Corn before a pre∣cious Pearl, I should not do amiss. There is none but by dili∣gent observation may see this to be undoubted truth.
In the taxing of which English and Out-landish fault, (for it is as common as the World is wide) I should shew my self no cunning Archer, to over-shoot the mark of your deserved com∣mendation:
For although you have had Fortune holding the Bason whilst you washed your hands, and cast the best chance of the Dice: yet for all that, such is your contentment, you hoyst not up the lofty sail of self-love, to swell with the wind of vain-glory, as vanting of any exploit which you have at∣chieved, Per tot Cyclopia saxa, per mundi scopulos, Scyllam, va∣stamque Charibdim: But as you went out, so are you come home, familiar with your friends, courteous to your acquain∣tance, remembring all, forgetting none, still of one mind, will, and affection, the prosperous event of your dangerous Voyage notwithstanding.
Some one having passed a Sea of six dayes sayling, or lesse, (if less might be supposed) is so far in love with himself, and so indiscreetly doteth over his own doings, at his return; that he maketh his Travel ordinary Table-talk, aggravating the matter so monstrously, as if he had endured the very Labours of old Hercules. Another, Et terris jactatus & alto, having seen the mighty Works of the Lord, and his Wonders in the Deep, and as it were measured with a pair of Compasses, (be it spo∣ken without offence) the globe of the World, post multa dis∣crimina rerum, arriving to his native Soil, marvellously bles∣sed from above, yet discovereth not the multitude of dangers, or rather death, wherewith he hath encountred. Which of these judge you, deserveth the Trumpets plausible sound.
I cannot therefore sufficiently wonder at the equality of your Worships mind, which notwithstanding so many tempests of perturbations, and sharp surges of inward motions, continueth calm. And it doth me not a little good, first, to see you so fortunate; secondly, though that were enough to make you insolent and disdainful, the credit which you have gotten de∣serving (no doubt) even with the very best, that yet you contemn not the company, the acquaintance, the familiarity and conference, even of such as by many degrees are your in∣feriours.
This among other considerations of your courteous disposi∣tion and friendly nature (being a mirrour in a Gentleman in this our proud arrogant Age) like a right Load-stone, drew me, an Iron lump, having in my hands a notable Work, enti∣tuled,
The Voyage of the Wandring Knight, to over-run the same, according to my superficial skill, and slender knowledge, to polish and burnish it, to restore and make it perfect, in some such limbs, whereon it seemed to halt, that it might with so much the more grace Proripere in publicum, & in hominum manus involare, for their large delight, and indeed to procure the printing and publishing thereof, that well-disposed people might thereby reap some benefit.
Which Work so perfected and brought into a reasonable good form, as my little learning and less leisure gave me leave, I am bold upon request of the Translator, being absent, to make Dedicatory unto your Worship, and have added this Epistle of mine own, as a testimony of the unfained affection and hearty good will which I bear you (without presumption be it spoken) not doubting how it shall be received, seeing the for∣mer presentation thereof was so well liked. Beseeching God to bless you, and the good Lady your Wife, and all yours, one with another, to prosper your proceedings, to further all your affairs: and that as hitherto you have had Vertue your ore-runner, and Fortune your follower, so you may have them still, even to your lives end: Ʋt magis atque magis tua gloria crescat: and that after you have sayled even to the very Straits of Death, which no mortal man can avoid, you may arrive in the Port of peace, I mean Abrahams Bosom, even the King∣dom of Heaven, the appointed Haven for all the true Christian Navigatours.
