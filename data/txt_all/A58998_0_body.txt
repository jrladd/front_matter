RICHARD BROWN,
IF thou art not sealed up already for destruction, and if repentance be not utterly hid from thy eyes, The Lord convert thee, and forgive thee of all thy hard and cruel dealing towards us, we desire thy repentance rather then thy destruction, and the Lord God of Heaven and Earth give judgement of final determination between thee and us, that all the earth may know whether thy cause against us, or our cause be just before him who onely is the Righteous Judge.
