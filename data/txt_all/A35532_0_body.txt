Right Honble and Noble Gentlemen:
I Have look'd round
my self, and find
among all Noble
Persons who pre∣serve

Honour and Loy∣altie
(in its splendor, as well
as integrity) there is none so
proper for my Addresse,
as your Noble selves:
Were it otherwise, I should
not step forth of our own
Island; which though it
have yet (blessed be God)
many Heroical and Excel∣lent
Souls, yet their Liber∣ty
and Fortunes are so
clouded and besieged by
the iniquity of our distracti∣ons,
that their Thoughts
are took up rather to seek

then bestow Protection.
And (to lay my soul na∣ked)
I confess I do not send
this Book to your Honours
because I knew not to whom
else to inscribe it; but I first
undertook it, to testifie to the
world, how happy the name
of Scotland is (even now
when the waves seem al∣most
to cover her) by the
fame and flourishing estate
of your Regiments. For
though that Nation be E∣clips'd
at home, yet she
shines bright in France.

Should I now offer to mar∣shall
particulars, who will
pity me for falling short,
when they see me enterprise
things almost impossible? I
confess I was so vain to en∣tertain
some such thoughts,
and was beginning with the
Great name of Doug∣las;
but I found my self
plunged in such a Gulf of
Honourable Actions, as all
my life would not serve for
the History of that Glori∣ous
Family; because at all
places and occasions, where

the work is Magnificent,
they are Jamais Arriere.The Motto of the Doug∣lasses.
I offered then at the no∣ble
Rutherford: but his
vast Intellectuals (with the
weight of his Acquests on
the Austrian powers at
Arras, Montmedy, Grav∣ling
and other places)
did so overpress me, that
(without more Forehead
then Wit) I could attempt
no further. And there∣fore
I sate down with this
safe resolution, that it was
little less then phrensie to

grasp at all, when I saw the
Principals were grown in∣comprehensible.
You are so
many, and there are so few
Noble Families in Scot∣land
to whom you are not
allied, that to speak of you
all, were to undertake the
whole Nation. The Scots
Atchievements in the
French Wars are legible in
all their Histories; and
were it possible to be ex∣punged,
you would record it
over again by your personal
Actions. And (which is

the grand comfort of now∣drooping
Scotland) your
two Regiments are the
Nurseries of all future &
succeeding Honour that be∣longs
to our Country.
As for my self and Book
(I call it mine, though I be
but its Translator) I made
particular choice of this, as
well for the subject-Mat∣ter,
as for the Author. I
see the world so shuffled
here below, that I thought
it safest to present the Go∣vernment
of a World a∣bove,

drawn by the hand
of Monsieur Bergerac,
who was not only of your
Profession, but also of your
Army.
My chiefest aim
(next to my particular
Devotion to your Honors)
is to mind the World, that
the Lilies of France never
flourish with more security,
then when guarded by the
Scots Thistle; for whose
prosperity (especially
in your Noble Per∣sons)
no man alive is a

more absolute Votary,
then
