Worthy Sir,
WHen I call to mind the memory you kept of me af∣ter a long time, between your hearing of me preach at St Thomas Parish in Southwark, when you were high Sheriffe of Surrey, and your pre∣sentation of me to Eshur, from which nothing could have separated me (since there I enjoied the happinesse of so No∣ble and ingenuous a Patron) but only a sequestration, or
the want of convenient dwelling: I could do no lesse then shew my thankfull remembrance of you, nor more honour my selfe then by prefixing your name among other of my most deserving friends, on the front of this child of my old age, which I know will be welcome to you, how meanly soever attired, because you have been so nobly respective to my relations upon my meer motion, to let them succeed me in the enjoiment of your love and favour; for which I shall ever rest,
