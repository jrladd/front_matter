Gentlemen,
YOur labour of love to the poor is had in remembrance before God, and ought not to be forgotten with men. I make bold to mention Your Names, minding You of what You have well begun, be∣seeching You to go on ti'l You have per∣fected the work; else this will stand as a blot upon Your Names. Not having time and opportunity to prosecute the businesse as formerly, I held it convenient to publish what is done, that some of those now acting may reap the benefit thereof.
