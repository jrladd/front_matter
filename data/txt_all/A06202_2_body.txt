MY worthlesse pen
To eternize
In holy flame
VVhich doth dispise
Thee sacred dame
That should protect
VVhose Phoenix quil
And those hath dect
Heauens do distill
As come from thence,
Ioue long you saue,
For whose defence,
Venus would craue,
VVhich Pallas wils
Presumeth to deuise,
Your peerles vertuous fame:
Of zeale my hart doth rise,
A theame of vulgar frame,
The graces haue select,
The holy Muses hill;
Doth heauenly Crowne affect,
VVhich Romane Trophies fill:
Their happie influence,
You there your portion haue;
VVhose Scepters you dispence,
True English hearts he gaue:
And Dain doth that due,
Me yeeld alone to you.
