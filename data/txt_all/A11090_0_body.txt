AFTER that I (Right vvor∣shipfull) had perused thys small Pamflet, conteyninge a briefe collecti∣on of the most vseall and accustomable wayes, leadinge from the one notable Citie in Europe, to an other: being vvritten vvith no smal labour and industry, and not vvithout great cause very necessarily published in the high Almaine tongue, and the like also to be seene in the French, and Ita∣lian. I thought it a thing very vncurte∣ous, and vvorthy of reproofe, to vvith∣hould so needefull a cōmoditie any lon∣ger from our voulgare spech, vvhereby I vvas the more imboldened to the fi∣nishing

therof, at such times as I might best attēd vpon the same. I haue more∣ouer, set downe the antiquitie of many cities vvorthy of memory, & the foun∣ders of their auncient monuments, the vvhich I haue diligently collected out of sundry approued aucthors. It resteth now that I therein most humbly craue your good vvorships furtheraunce, (as of one most vvorthy, for your great ex∣perience and trauailes, into forreyne Realmes, in the Princes vvaighty affai∣res, as it is not vnknowne,) so that ther∣by it might the better, vnder your pro∣tection, passe forth into the handes of many. And although (right vvorship∣full) this briefe collection, doth contain no pleasant history, nor delightful new deuised matter, yet doubtlesse a thinge of necessitie to be desired, especially of all suche Gentlemen as are adicted to trauaile, vvhich hetherto haue vvanted the same: beside Marchants, or Factors, in forreyne countries, dispersed as their trafique requireth. But to be briefe, I cease further to reherse perticulerly the commodities thereof. Desiring your

vvorship to take in good part, the first fruites of my labours, trusting hereaf∣ter (if God lend me good successe) to impart vnto your vvorship, some fur∣ther matter of more delight or pleasure in the reading thereof. And thus I de∣sire almightie God to preserue you, vvith your verteous Lady, in health and prosperous felicitie.
