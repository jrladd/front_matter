IT is the good and wise way of God, in matters con∣cerning this temporal life, to make manifest his bounty and kindnesse to all men, how unkind and wicked soever they be, and not leave himselfe without a witnesse against complainers: But in the mat∣ters of salvation, and things which do belong to eternal life, hee useth not to extend his spe∣cial love so largely; for even the externall means of saving knowledge are bestowed up∣on few Nations and People, in comparison of the whole race of mankind, Psal. 147.19, 20. He sheweth his word unto Jacob, and his sta∣tutes and his judgments unto Israel; hee hath not dealt so with any Nation, and as for his judge∣ments they have not knowne them. And though the people be few to whom the offer of salva∣tion

is made, in comparison of the rest of the world; yet are they many in comparison of those who find grace in the eyes of the Lord, to accept the offer of Grace tendred unto them in Christ Jesus; for many are called, but few chosen, Mat. 22.14. And albeit it be true, that Gods calling and election hath place in all rankes and estates of persons, higher and lower, learned or unlearned, rich and poor; yet doth this grace stretch it selfe to many moe of the meaner sort of people then of the wise, weal∣thy and honorable in the world, 1 Cor. 1.26. Yee see your calling brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many Noble are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things in the world, &c. Therefore so much the greater is the favour of God, which your souls have found, most honorable, that you are made some of those few, yea after so com∣fortable a manner, that the daughter finding her self led by her Mothers hand, in her tender youth unto Christ the Saviour, looketh on her as her mother twice; and the Mother having power and place to draw the vaile of her daughters virginall modesty, retirednesse, and prudence, which concealeth much of the lustre of accomplishments from the sight of others who stand at a greater distance, doth look up∣on her notable endowments, and growing graces, as more then a recompence of all the

paines sustained in bringing forth, and bestow∣ed upon education of such a plant so wel fitted for that which is most desirable in earth and heaven; And thus much I have reason for me to say, not only because it is my part, as I have occasion, to stir up parents to study to have their children timously engaged to the Lord, in hope to have the more early and abundant com∣fort by them in their owne time; but also be∣cause I have been witnes of the Christian beha∣viour of both your Ladiships, in no smal tryal of your faith & patience by the troubles of the times, both publick and private, for a number of yeares together; which experience hath now good use to fit and prepare your honours for a further exercise rue beleevers are subject unto in this life, and for what this present time doth call unto all to be prepared for. This condition being in all ages incident to the godly, should not be looked upon in our time as if some strange thing did befall us: for it is the Lords ordinary way of dealing with his children, by changes of their condition out∣ward and inward, by vicissitudes of straits and outgates, by entercourse of Crosses and Comforts, and by much variety of severall conditions, powerfully to traine, advance, and settle their faith, and to increase the growth of all graces accompanying salvation in them; for what we cannot conceive at one lesson, be∣cause

wee are dull, he teacheth us by parts, in many & sundry instructions, all tending to bring us to a further measure of humiliation, and self denial on the one hand, and of submission unto God, and faith in Christ on the other hand: And this way of God is made plaine by the practice of the Saints, and laid open before us in the book of the Psalms; wherof at this time I have on∣ly taken a third part to handle by way of Es∣say, thereby to finde the advice of judicious brethren, how to satisfie, and edifie the Reader more in what is behind to be handled, if God be pleased to give further employment and assistance in this service; And this which here is offered to the edification of the Lords people, I have put forth under your Honours Name, because of your constant affection to the study of the Scripures, and respect to all the messengers of Truth, and to me for the Truths cause, for which I will still remaine,
