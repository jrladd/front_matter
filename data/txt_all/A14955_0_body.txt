MAny and sundry are the gifts and pre∣sents
which are sent betweene friend
and friend, of valew according to the
habilitie of the sender. Some present
gifts of great worth, as Plate, Iewels,
and such like, others meaner things.
My selfe finding my owne estate but of
a weake kinde, am bold insteed of such gifts, onely to be∣stow
part of my braines fruite vpon you both, presuming
that it will be kindly receiued, though it be but of a small
moment or valew. By the one of you I assure my selfe (at
least am in good hope) it will bee kindly receiued as a
simple present from the Seruant to the Maister. The
other (in lue of many good turnes at your hands already
receiued, and not any way requited) I make the rather
bold to connex in the partaking of the same: humblie
requiring you to be a kinde of Side-men in the assisting

of Dick Whipper and his Iewrie in this session to ayde
them with your iudgements in the pronouncing the sen∣tence
of condemnation against the malefactors at the ar∣raignement,
hauing and being of that opinion, that you
will not onely iudge without partialitie at this time, but
also be ready in your foynes to attend the iudge, at the
next Court day, when I beleeue a greater malefaector will
be brought in, then the worst of these: In the meane
time Ile bespeake a new whip which shall
stick close to his sides as euer
his shirt did.
