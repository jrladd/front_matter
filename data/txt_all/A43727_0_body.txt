SIR,
I Take the boldness to present unto You this Essay on the Revelation of S. John; and I hope, for this my Ad∣dress, and for prefixing your most worthy Name to this Discourse, I shall not be judged either unseasonable or presumptuous; Consi∣dering not only the great Honour and Devoti∣on I bear to your most Worthy Name and Person, but being also bound in Gratitude to Revive the Memory of that most Generous and Noble Family of the Chyvertons of Kerris, your Worthy Kinsmen: To whom I being obliged by so many real Benefits and neer Re∣lations, that I knew not how to manifest a bet∣ter Retaliation, then by a Revival of their most Worthy Memories, in the Dedication of this Discourse to your Worships Protection, who

is the only Surviving Branch of that Ancient and Truly Generous Family of the Chyvertons of our County of Cornwal. But by the way I shall take leave to assure you (being not al∣together ignorant of the ends and ayms that most men lay before themselves in such Dedi∣cations) that it was least in my intention to af∣fix hereunto your Honourable Name, thereby to add a countenance to any private opinions of mine; much less was it in my eye to raise an esteem upon my weak endeavours, by in∣sinuating the least complyance in your Wor∣ships judgement, in many things I have writ∣ten herein; let them stand or fall according to the Truth and Reason therein manifested▪ I quite disclaim any such pretences, in having any Interest in my Plea for this my Applicati∣on unto your Worthy Self: But if the least measure of the Truth of God be herein found, I trust it will be no dishonour to your Self, nor to the greatest amongst men, that such walk under the countenance of your Authority and great Names: But what herein shall justly ap∣pear heterodox and dissentaneons from the Word of God, let it not have the least appro∣bation or countenance from man, but let it rather be as an abortive birth, and dye for ever, never to have a resurrection more.
Thus having wiped off the sinister Inter∣pretations for this Application, In the next

place be pleased to take a view of what is here tendered, when the urgency of your great and important affairs will permit, it being an In∣terpretation on part of the Book of John's Di∣vine Prophesies, wherein God's various deal∣ings with his Church and people, as also with the Empires of the world under whose power they come under, are under most lively Pro∣phetical Representations, and Hyerogliphique Figures, discovered and made known, even from the time of the giving of that Prophesie, unto the end of the world.
And you know, 'tis a common Custome amongst most men, to get a Prognostication in the ending of the old year, to inform them∣selves of the Accidents and Events that are likely to be in the ensuing year. Lo, now, about the end of this year, I present You with this first part of this Divine Ephemerides, com∣posed by the skilfullest Astronomer that ever was: There is now no need of upholding that wretched practice of running to the Wizards or Star-gazers, to know the Events and Suc∣cesses of Churches, States, and Kingdoms: We have here a full Discovery from himself, who created the Stars, and knows their course, and calls them all by their Names; who loos∣eth the bands of Orion, and binds up the influ∣ence of the Pleiades. Men may conjecture, and their conjecture fail; they talk of the hea∣vens,

but never were there for a full discove∣ry: but here then the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and he that created the Seas, telling and foretelling Signs and Wonders, not for a day, or a moneth, or a year, but for many years, even until the end of the World, not only the events of our present old year, but the accidents also of the New year: that is, of the other life. The Mathematicians of this world never dream'd of that great day, where∣in a thousand years should make up but one great and glorious day: Only this Book, the Saints great Almanack reports this, and there∣fore I believe it. Aristotle could not conceive that the World should end, because he never understood how it did begin: but behold a greater then Aristotle is here. Christ hath taught of the end, and given Notes and Signs to discern this end.
I doubt not but you will perceive and finde how singular useful the knowledge of these Prophesies will be to all persons, but especially to such as have their hands much employed in the great Affairs of the World, so that when their Lord and Master cometh with ten thou∣sands of his Angels to call them to an account of their Stewardship, how comfortable then will the contemplation be, that they in their several Generations have employed their Inte∣rests, Power, and Authority in the World,

for Christ and his people, against Antichris and its Adherents? Those Christian Worthies that have already long since fallen asleep with those that are alive at Christs second com∣ing, that have engaged on this account, wi be sure then to have an Euge bone Serve, to be their portion; and they that have ruled here for Christ, shall then rule and reigne with him for ever. But I desire not to be mistaken in this, that I judge all is Antichrist that many in these days call Antichrist: I know there is a true real Antichrist, an opposite state to Christ and Truth, under the Visor of Christ and Truth: It is not every difference in Judgement or Re∣ligion that makes up Antichrist; indeed o late I finde it a State-knack of several parties and factions to brand their adversaries with those odious stiles of Antichrist, Heretiques, &c. that they may go undiscovered, that de∣serve such Titles better themselves, or at least wise, so to raise a Scar-crow, to drive away the fearful and dis-ingenious from a full enqui∣ring into the Truths of God, that would disco∣ver the vanity and folly of their opposers. But no more of this.
And here by the way, I shall not be asha∣med to acquaint you with one mistake of mine, who once thought (as most men do) that God in his Providential disposing the Kingdoms o this world, and in exalting men of low degre

into the Throne of Princes, and throwing down great Princes, and their Progenies, into the state of slaves, it was only to manifest his Soveraignty over the Kingdoms of this world, to give them to whom he pleaseth: but more maturely considering the All-wise ordering hand of God in such great Transactions, I have found the issue in all Ages to be very ad∣vantagious to the Church of God, and the re∣sult of all such State-shakings and Revolutions to be in mercy towards his Church and Peo∣ple. When God broke the great Caldeo-Assyri∣an Monarchy, and transferred it to the Medio-Persian, how vvonderfully, and by vvhat strange providence did God raise Cyrus his ser∣vant or instrument for that work? Who was exposed to be destroyed by the command of his Grandsire Astyages, whiles an Infant, up∣on pretence of some fatal Prophesie, yet pre∣served and brought up amongst Shepherds, as his Story goes, that afterwards he became most providentially the great deliverer of God's people (the Jews) from their Assyrian bondage. Moses the great Captain of Israel, we are sure trod almost the same path under a strange pro∣vidence of Preservation, that at last he became the deliverer of Israel from their Aegyptian thraldome. When Saul was set by, who was of a Kingly Presence, and by the Head and Shoulders above his brethren, David was cal∣led

from the Sheep-cot to the Throne, the issue whereof was, the exaltation of Israel, and the downfal of their enemies. If we shall but reflect since Christ's coming in the flesh, on the example of Constantine the Great, Son unto Helena a Brittish Lady, who through many glorious and eminent Victories and Services, was at last advanced to the Impe∣rial Seat, and how he at last became as a Tem∣poral Saviour to the Church of Christ, and Destroyer to the Kingdom of the Dragon, is most marvellous to consider. It is worth fur∣ther the taking notice of, how wonderfully God in late ages, raised the Spirits of some ob∣scure persons, as Martin Luther, and his As∣sociates of the first Reformation, with some o∣ther Reformed Ministers since, that they have made the great Hierarchy of Rome to shake with their Power; so that many Christian Princes then, and since, began to hate the Whore, with the Wine of whose Fornicati∣ons they were made drunken; and now be∣gin not only to hate her, but to make her de∣solate and naked, and to eat her flesh. But yet that age was but the first fruits, or Prodromus, not the consummation of the work; for she having since lifted up her head, and endeavou∣red to cover her nakedness, and to cure her self of her great Wound received, but all in vain, for her period drawing nigh, God exasperates

her sore more and more, and makes those Horns, those Princes that were once her strong Supporters, to fall off from her, and to hate her. Indeed the first Reformers took off her outward garments, and showed her nakedness in her false Doctrine, and partly in her false Worship, and then began to eat her Flesh, in taking off some of her pompous Re∣venues, but yet the main Work was left undone to its appointed time: For as this great City rose not in one day, but gradually, so will also her ruine be by several Measures, or Vials of God's wrath poured out upon her, until the consummation of her ruine come with fire, both Material and Analogical, the one the fire of God's Word, first destroy∣ing quite her false Worship, which day∣lie goes on in perfecting: the other, God's fire of War and Judgements, destroying quite up her outward State and Policy, that her place be no more found. And to the bringing a∣bout this great end, God works very variou∣sly, somtimes in moving on the hearts of Prin∣ces, and so makes them willing unto this work: somtimes in laying aside Princes of ancient and potent Families, and raising up meaner and lower Persons on their Thrones (as he most wonderfully hath done of late among our selves) to whom he gives Hearts, Spirits, and Gifts meet for this great work: and lastly, in

over-ruling the designs of others, that though they go about to seek themselves, and to ad∣vance their own Dominion and Power of Ru∣ling, yet the All-wise providence of God knows how so to order them, as to bring about his predesigned end: For I cannot believe that they will be all pious good Princes, and right in their ends, that shall be employed about this work; for they are the ten Horns, or ten Kings that receive power one hour with the Beast, and were Members of him that shall destroy the Whore, and burn her with Fire, Rev. 17.12.16. I am of the minde, that few conclude that Hen. 8. and some other Princes were so justifiable in their ends in expelling the Authority of Antichrist, as they should have been, and yet God employed them as his Instruments in this Work: and when they have done his business, God knows how to lay them by, and all such self-ended persons, as useless, or at least, make them but as Gibeonites, or Hewers of Wood in the House of the Lord.
Lastly, Your Worship may be pleased to take notice, that some conceive those and the like Interpretations of dark Prophesies, to be but the issues of distempered brains, and of lit∣tle certainty. To whom I answer, Seeing that this is a Book that hath the publique impress of the Spirit in it, and left (as it were) as its

last Legacy of this sort in the Church of Christ; I profess soberly, I know not what tolerable sense to set on this Book of the Reve∣lation, if it be not for an historical discovery, under Types and Figures, of all the Changes and Revolutions, with their Periods and Is∣sues, that should befal the Church of God, and their Oppressors and Enemies, until the end of all. I confess there may be some difference in Interpreting, and in not rightly Applying some of the several Characters, Periods, and Visions of this Book, and in other circumstan∣tial parts thereof; and wherein I fail, I en∣treat not only your Worship, but all o∣thers, to remember my weakness, and our com∣mon attribute, Humanum est errare: and e∣specially being amongst such Prophetical deeps and difficulties, which may well plead for his failings, who is conscious of his insufficiencies for so high and difficult an undertaking: Yet this I dare be bold to say, that the substantial part of this Prophesie is here cleared and disco∣vered: And if any receive light hereby, to the better understanding the dark Mysteries thereof, give me leave to say with Daniel, cap. 2.28. There is a God in Heaven which reveal∣eth Mysteries, to him be all the Glory.
But to You (worthy Sir) I have nothing more to add, nor for you a greater good to pray, then that God who having exalted you

in Authority and Power, into that likeness of himself, so he would Engrave upon you ano∣ther image or likeness of his own, true wisdom, and give you an enlightned, wise (Solomon-like) discerning heart, whereby you may day∣ly see more and more into the great and glori∣ous discoveries of the Truths of God in this Book of Prophesies, and else-where, in the ho∣ly Word of God; that you may have your ayms right, and your heart fixed to prosecute those ends, and that in integrity, which God in your present Employments hath called you unto. The work of this present generation for all Christian Worthies to set their hands and hearts to, being (as I conceive) if not to the downfal of the Throne of the Beast, yet at least to the Eclipsing of the Austrian Sun, the great Pillar of the Antichristian State. And that your heart and hand may not be wanting amongst the chiefest of the Christian Wor∣thies in those great transactions, is the great de∣sire of him that is
