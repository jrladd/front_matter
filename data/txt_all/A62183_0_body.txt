My Lord,
THough your design'd Favours to me might justly claim this offer of my Respects in a Dedicati∣on, yet I must own, That it is

on of the next Age, than your Lordship.
In your Negotiation in Holland, during the close In∣trigues of the latter end of King Charles his Reign, you strove to keep both him and us happy and quiet, by pro∣moting the true Interest of both: But when the Ferment of our Affairs forc'd you to more sensible demonstrations of your thoughts, you No∣bly chose rather to appear an ill Courtier, than be thought an ill Man to your Country. The Protestant Interest carri∣ed it with you, while the Ro∣man Faction thought their designs as secure as they

were deeply laid. 'Tis rare to find such Conduct and Courage in a Publick Mini∣ster: But what could be ex∣pected less from one ready to venture his Life in the Field at the Head of our Nation a∣broad, against that unquiet Monarch who was then inva∣ding all the Liberty Mankind had left.
Heaven, My Lord, has at last bless'd these constant endeavours for England's Prosperity, and we see you in the Councils and Priva∣cy of a Prince born for our Felicity.
The Great Queen of this Monarchy, who so lov'd her

People, and understood their Interest, had a Sydney for her Favourite, and such a man as she admir'd living, and lamented dead; and our King, who has begun with restoring this Nation to its true Interest, and will, no que∣stion, advance its Glory to the highest pitch, has your Lord∣ship in his Councils and Arms, Guarded by you in the day, he sleeps often under your care in the Night, safe in your Loyalty, and pleas'd in your attendance.
To whom then could I more properly offer these Ar∣canums of a Wise Govern∣ment, than to one who must

be a good Judge of all Wri∣tings of that kind; and there∣fore with repeated Offers of my humble Respects, and rea∣diness to obey your Lordship's Commands, I take leave, and am,
My Lord,
