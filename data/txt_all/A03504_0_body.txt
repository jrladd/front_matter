Perlege Maeonio cantatas carmine Ranas,
Et frontem nugis soluere disce meis.
Martialis in Xenia, 183.




SVch louing fauours from your sonne I found,
So kind affection at your Worships hand,
Though vndeserued, that I still am bound,
And vnto you and yours obliged stand:
And though that Greene braunch, which ay-springing stood,
As chiefest crowne or garland to your wood,
Be by the stroke of Fate quite cut away,
Ne're shall a thanklesse nature in me sway.
No loftie Cedar, though in height he passe
Eche seu'rall plant which desert forrests yeeld;
No Laurell, though Apollo's tree it was;
No Pine for shippes, no Oke ordayn'd to build,
Nor any shrub was halfe so deare to me,
As was that braunch falne from the Greenewoods tree:
Which though, as dead, entomb'd in earth it lyes,
A day will come, we hope, to see it rise.


Here (worthy Sir) doe I present to you.
The timely Buds of my frost-bitten Spring,
And though this trifle not deserue your view,
Yet such a trifle once did Homer sing,
Adorn'd with robes, spun from the wooll of Greece,
Homely by me now clad in English fleece:
Albeit no pleasure in this toy you take,
Yet deigne a kind aspect for Hargreues sake,
