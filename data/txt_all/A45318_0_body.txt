May it please your Majestie,
THere needs no propheticall Spirit to discern by a small Cloud, that there is a storm comming towards our Church, such a one, as shall not only drench our plumes, but shake our peace. Already do we see the Skie thicken, and hear the winds whistle hollow afarr off, and feel all the Presa∣ges of a Tempest, which the late example of our Neigh∣bours bids us fear. It boots not to perswade your Ma∣jesty to betake your self to your Chariot, to outride the showre, since your gracious compassion would not be wil∣ling to put off the sense of a common evill: Rather let me take boldness to implore your Majesties seasonable pre∣vention: Only the powerfull breath of your Soveraign authority can dispell these Clouds, and clear our Hea∣ven, and reduce an happy Calme. In the mean time give leave to your well meaning Servants, to contri∣bute their best wishes to the common Tranquillity. I see every Man ready to ranke himself unto a side, and to draw in the quarrel he affecteth: I see no Man thrusting himself between them, and either holding, or joyning their hands for peace: This good (however thankless)

office I have here boldly undertaken, shewing how un∣justly we are divided, and by what means we may be made, and kept entire. A project (which if it may re∣ceive life, and light from your gracious eyes, and shall by your Royall command be drawn into speedy practise) promiseth to free this noble and flourishing Church from a perilous inconvenience. Let it be no disparagement to so important a motion, that it falls from so mean a hand, then which, yet none can be more syncerely consecrated to the service of your Majesty and this Church, the mu∣tuall happiness of both which, is dearer then life to
