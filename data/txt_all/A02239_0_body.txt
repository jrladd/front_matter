MY most Honoured Lords, The same forme of Inscription wherewith once, and first, I haue sacred your Altars, I make it a Religion now to alter, since there is nothing required in an Act of Pietie, aboue Constancie; and with that stu∣die I come now, to offer my second de∣uotions. Your Honours indulgent ac∣ceptance of my trauels, in the French Storie, hath lent prosperous windes to this my course in that of the Ne∣therlands; wherein I haue chiefely followed Iohn Francis Petit, an Authour yet liuing, and residing in our London. What I haue added out of others (who respect the same Center) for the more perfection, let it be your LL. pre∣rogatiue, and theirs, that are experienced to pronounce: I, that know, too much boasting a mans owne paynes, may spend prodigally, both of his merit and modestie, am wil∣lingly silent. The reason of my vndertaking this worke, is the same with the former, for that of Fraunce, want of be∣ing imployed in more fruitfull seruices: In which I would

rather it should bee vnderstood my Fortunes fault, than mine, where the world must see, how contented I am to labour in the hard and rough quarries. But your Honours, when you please, may redeeme mee, not to a course of more ease (I affect it not) but of more vse. To which, since I haue vowed my selfe your LL. already, I will not now iterate the vow, as if I thought not my selfe then beleeued; but with honest perseuerance of my dutie, expect your fa∣uour. And for your Honours, since nothing can be ad∣ded to things perfect, and at their height, my next wish is, That Heauen will ratifie them, and make what he hath giuen to you, most particular and lasting.
