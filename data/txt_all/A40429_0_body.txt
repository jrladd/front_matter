Madam,
I WAS too conscious of the Weak∣ness and Imperfections of this Discourse to have any Inclinati∣on to let it go abroad, and was not a little surpriz'd to hear your Ladyship and some other great Persons press so earnestly for the Printing of it; What kind of usage it's likely to meet with in this Censorious and Uncharitable Age, I am altogether unconcern'd, being very well assur'd of the honest designs and intentions of the Author in the Preaching of it; And if it prove of any Use to the Publick, or any satis∣faction
 to your Ladyship, I have all I aim at in yeilding to the farther Pub∣lication of it, besides the opportunity to acknowledg your Ladyships many undeserv'd Favours to
Madam,
