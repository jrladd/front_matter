MY LORD,
SO many Excellent Discourses have been already written against Scep∣ticism, and in Defence of Christianity, that I might justly be deterr'd from coming
after Others, if the Command of that Honourable Court, where Your Lordship so worthily Presides, had not call'd for the Publication of this Sermon. I could not foresee, it should be longer-liv'd than many better Composures of this Kind; which, after they have serv'd for an Hour's A∣musement, are thrown aside, and vanish with the Breath of the Preacher: and therefore was not much concern'd to give it that Turn and Air, that is given to Things, which, from their First Concep∣tion, are design'd for the Press. Such as 'tis, I leave it to God's Blessing: ear∣nestly wishing that it may conduce to settle the Minds of those who shall chance to read it, in an hearty Belief of that Holy Religion which God has Reveal'd unto us by his Son, and confirm'd by the Ministry of the PARACLET; whose Miraculous Effusion on the Apostles, and Apostolic
Men, in the First Ages of the Church, we commemorate at this Time: And may that Blessed Spirit guide us into all TruthJoh. xvi. 13.. I am,
MY LORD,

Whitsun-Eve, 1695.
