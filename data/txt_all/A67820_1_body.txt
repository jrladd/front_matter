READER,
I Must first be so just to my self as to avoid Pliny's malediction a∣against those Thieves who will steal even an whole Au∣thor, and not so much as add to the sense one Paragraph, or alter one Syllable in the Phrase, Reprehensione dignum est, Majorum tacere nomina, & eorum sibi appropriare ingenia. Whereas (saith the same Au∣thor)

Benignum etenim est & plenum ingenui pudoris fateri per quos profeceris; Nevertheless I can only tell thee this, that I have changed both the Phrase (to a finer Allay) of my Author, I have added many whole Paragraphs and pages to pursue his excellent designe, which he had only framed, not compleated; and which came to my hands in the form of an old musty Ma∣nuscript, which was not ca∣pable to tell its Author's name, and very difficult to express its designe, being in many places prejudiced by time (that Edax rerum) to a great imperfection. I thought

it therefore best not to thrust it into the World crippled and injured as it was, nor to amend its old expressions with a new sort of Dialect, on purpose to avoid piecing and patching; And if yet a∣ny thing of Lameness shall remain, be thou not a No∣verca, but rather a Nutrix, ex∣tenuate thy Candor and sup∣press thy prejudice and if thou pleasest to take the pains thou hast as much right to put it into a better dress, which I commend to thy sufficient ability. Yet never∣theless it is expected from some that this will be up∣braided with Bastardy, and

be despised and hated as Filius Populi, by that abounding and multitudinous sort of People who are called Partialists, who always wedded to their own particular Lusts and private Interests, that are factious even to Rebellion and Tyran∣ny, that will neither give God nor Caesar his due: Notwithstanding it is resol∣ved to venture, knowing that no sorrow is sudden to an expectation; And that it will find some (though but a few) that will both commend and protect it. It will Court all but Flatter none: It is the hand that points at The Prin∣ces Right and the Peoples Li∣berty.

It is that little Costick which will twinge all such whose corruptions are ripe for separation; and though it may make them wince at the touch of their thwarted passions; yet it is the surest means to work the cure, if they will be perswaded to endure the Pain.
The design of this is to sweeten the seeming bitter severities, yet just necessities of Government and render them plausible and palliable to the People, that so they may delight more in their Duty to obey than the Sove∣reign in his Power to Com∣mand (Legum servi sumus

ut Libri esse possumus, saith Cicero) And the Prince (on whose Head is placed both at once the Weight and Glo∣ry of a Crown) and the People may both mutually know (since the burthen of a Crown is first understood before the Glory is percei∣ved) that Grandure is both to compensate as well as digni∣fy the toyles and difficulties of Government.
Bracton saith Nihil aliud po∣test Rex, in terris cum sit Dei Minister & Vicarius, nisi id so∣lum quod de jure potest, which is an Axiome that puts reci∣procal bounds of Justice and Goodness, both to instruct

the Prince in his Duty and Behaviour towards God and his Subjects, and the People in their due Obedience to their Sovereign, since the King is none, but the Al∣mighty's Substitute or Vice-Roy, and consequently to be questioned for his Actions, or punished by none but God himself, who is not to be hastned or directed in the disposition of his Vengeance, but rather entreated by hearty: Prayer for the removal of his Plagues and Judgements.
I stand amazed when I consider the many Factions and Seditions amongst us, that these Kingdoms are not

already the Subjects of irrita∣ted Justice: when I hear the open murmurs, and see the many Treasonable Libels in these licentious times; The Prince abused, and the People deceived by Instruments of Darkness and wicked practi∣ces, by such men, or rather Monsters, who when they most violently cry up the Kingdomes good under the necessity of reforming the manners of Magistracy, they onely aim at the destruction of Peace and Innocence, which is the hated Object of such devouring Vultures.
Hence I foresee the Immi∣nent Dangers and miserable

Calamities that every mo∣ment seems to threaten ine∣vitable miseries on these di∣vided Kingdoms. One may perceive the dreadful storm hanging, as it were, imme∣diately over our Heads, We are confounded on all Hands, and the Disease seems almost Remediless; Rome's horrid Plots are not yet fully de∣tected, and God knows how much of the Good old Cause remains yet to this day in the Hearts of partial and ill affected Puritans. These two are the Sylla and Charibdis of our misfortunes, and seem to make but one Body, be∣cause they aim at one end,

the destruction of our Lives, Religion, and Government.
Let the King and People therefore of the established Church of England take as much care against the ha∣tred of a Puritan as against the malice of a Jesuite, the Contrivances of the latter (being commonly prevented) having never acted so vile a Tragedy, as the Principles and Practices of the former. The Pope in all his Bulls and Interdicts cannot fulmi∣nate more Maledictions than have been reduced into Prac∣tice amongst our Jesuited Fa∣naticks.
Let us then beware of

these two; Be obedient to our King; and his Majesty careful both of himself and us; let the Laws be duely practised and observed, and then the King, our Lives, Religion and Government will be safely preserved.
Farewell.
