SIRE,
ONe would believe that a Tra∣veller
who returns from the East
should not present to your Majesty
other than Pearls and Diamonds. Nor should
I my self have been so presumptuous, as
onely to lay at your feet some few Draughts
which I have drawn during my being abroad,
had not those favourable Glances which you
were pleased to cast upon them, embolden'd
me to make them a publick Offering to your

goodness. Sir, I know well that such a
poor present as this is altogether unworthy
of so great a Monarch, to whose acceptance
not all Persia nor the Indies can afford any
thing considerable. However seeing that
Prince who thought the whole Universe below
his thoughts, voucsaf'd to accept the Feathers
of a dead Bird, which could not be brought
him alive, I am in hopes that your Majesty,
nol ss exalted for your indulgent goodness,
than for the Grandeur of your Actions
above Alexander, will permit me to give you
a Prospect of those places which you know
how to subdue when ever you are pleas'd to
employ your Victorious Arms in such a Glo∣rious
enterprize. Doubtless, Sir, the Inhabi∣tants
of those Cities, which these Sketches
represent, full of the far extending Fame of
Lewis the Great, would esteem themselves
happy to live under the easy Dominion of a
Soveraign, whom they have reason to look up∣on
as the first and greatest Monarch of the
Universe. Your Majesty would be there most
assuredly acknowledged with all submission
imaginable, and I at the same time should be

overjoy'd to have discover'd through my
pains whatever is at this day most obser∣vable
and most worthy your protection. It
being the only aime, which I always propos'd
to my self, to make known to the world that I
am with a most profound respect,
SIRE,
