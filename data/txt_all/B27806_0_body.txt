May it please your Majesties,
THis small Treatise, altho' it come from the Hand of one of the mean∣est of your Subjects, yet it is a Collection of some of the Words of the Wise, and of their Dark Sayings, which declare the End of this World from the Beginning. They are given by one Shepherd, and the Measures of them are all equal and upright, for they are Words of Truth, and do jointly shew, that the Glory of this World is passing away as the Flower of the Field, which withers as soon as it is cut down. But the Word or Promise of our God shall be raised up by him, who Proclaims to the Ends of the World, and Commandeth that it be said to Jerusalem that her Warfare is Accomplished; and to Si∣on, Behold thy Saviour comes, his Re∣ward
 is with him, and his Work before him. These are the good Tydings which were promised to be sent to Jerusalem by an Evan∣gelist that shows the former things and the lat∣ter end of them, and declareth things to come
God that hath sent you to Deliver these Nations from Popery and Slavery, and hath Covered your Head in the Day of Battle, bless you with Wisdom of Discerning of Men, and with that understanding which the Men of Issachar had to know the Times, and what Israel was to do when David was to be made King. That Profaneness may be suppressed, and Oppression removed, Men of Truth fear∣ing God and hating Covetousness may be Coun∣tenanced, then shall your Light break forth as the Morning, the Lord shall go before you to destroy your Enemies, and the God of Isra∣el, shall be your Rereward.
So Prayeth
