HAuing had through your Honou∣rable bountie, a part of the Lords Vineyarde allotted vnto mee his most vnworthy woorkeman, by your Honour his most worthie Steward, to the end I should plant and water, purge and prune it, I thought it my part not onely to performe my duetie in this behalfe, in such measure as God enableth mee, but also to present vnto your Ho∣nour the first fruites of my labour which haue yet offered themselues to publike view, to the end that I might thereby both shew my selfe not altogether negli∣gent in our great Lord and Maisters businesse, and also giue some token of most obliged dutie and humble thank∣fulnesse to you his Honourable Steward, by whose ap∣pointment I haue obtained a place wherein I may im∣ploy my paines, whereas otherwise I should eyther haue
stood idle in the market place, or else beene compelled to haue digged in another mans ground, with great la∣bour and little fruite. If these my first fruites seeme vnpleasant in your most learned and iudiciall taste, ey∣ther impute it to the immaturitie caused by their short time of grouth and small-experienced skill of the Vin∣tager, or else consider that they are destinated to a phy∣sicall vse for the purging away of choller, and therefore though they bee not pleasant in taste, yet may they bee profitable in operation. Such as they are (in all humilitie, crauing pardon for my boldnesse) I commend them to your Honourable Patronage and protection, and your selfe to the Almighties, most heartely beseeching the glorious and great Lord of the Vineyard long to conti∣nue you his faithfull Steward amongest vs, to the ad∣uancement of his glory, the propagation of his Vine, and the exceeding comfort of his poore contemned Labou∣rers. Amen.
