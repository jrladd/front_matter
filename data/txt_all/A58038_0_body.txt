Gentlemen;
AT Your Desire this Sermon was Preach∣ed; and as you know, at your Desire it was Printed: or else it had lain buried in Dust and Obscurity with many others. See∣ing it is Printed at your Request, it concerns you, not me, to be accountable to the World for it: I can only say, I endeavoured Faith∣fulness and Plainness, if it may be of any use to you, or your Design; in that I shall re∣joice. You have my Heart, and shall not want my poor Prayers. May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus make you such, all of you, as you should be, that endeavour the Reformation of others; and make you very successful, as well as sincere, in your Attempts to Reform this Place; and may we and our Posterity in this Town have cause to bless God that ever you begun this Work amongst us. So prays,

April 21, 1699.
