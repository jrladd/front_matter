SIR,
I Know you are as farre from pride as Ignorance, and not onely under∣stand, but love in∣deavours of this kind; the ensue∣ing Ellegies (memorizing my much
 honoured Parents) I present to your Patronage: for that you were well acquainted with their persons (when on Earth) and can witnesse (with me) to the World, that I am not partiall in my prayses: Sir, I have a hope that reason ere long may clear your eye-sight, that so at length you may looke up, and view him, whom hitherto you have unkindly neglect∣ed, to hasten which desired day, I have not onely allarumed you with groanes from graves, but do also sound Pan's Pipe in your eares, de∣dicating unto you also the following Eglogues, and I beseech you, assure your selfe, that as they cannot prove disgracefull to me, so they must needs be esteemed, an addition of Honour to you: among all the Poets
 in that wise age wherein Moecenas lived, Virgil, and Horace were the onely the onely two, whose mean Fortunes needed his liberallitie, as well as their virtues deserved his ac∣quaintance, how liberall he was, their acknowledgements in their workes have testified to the World. Sir, you are blest with much sub∣stance, you cannot better provide for your name, then to be kind to those, in whose power it is either to cajol, or canonize you to all poste∣ritie. I may safely averre that it was happy for Moecenas (not onely that Virgil, and Horace lived in his time, but) that those two famous men should live in such estates as to need his bounty, though that excel∣lent Epigarmmatist, Martiall, could say,

Sint Moecenates, non deerunt Flacce Marones.
Yet the contrary (by experience) hath been found: Maroes have been borne, when no Moecenasses have li∣ved to cherish them. As Homer, the wonder of Posteritie, in his owne time little esteemed, and Moecenasses have lived and wanted Maroes. Alex∣ander the great (then whom none more desirous of Fame, or more able to requite, yet (if we may credit Arianus) found not one Poet to me∣morize his actions. I have been Sir) some thing prolix on this subject of Poets and Patrons, to make you sen∣sible, that your liberality to the Muses, will be retributed with
 dovble advantage, you may as you please determine of me, that as I never had, I care not how soon I loose.
Sir,
