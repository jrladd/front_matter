SIR,
THere is no man that hath the free use of his Reason and Senses, with Opportunity, but must as naturally fall to Philosophizing; as a Silk∣worm that is full grown, and hath a convenient place, must fall to Spinning. But one whom the Royal So∣ciety hath so far honoured and obliged, as to make him of their Number; how much less possible is it for him to live a Drone, and not to act his part in so industri∣ous and noble a Hive? As a Specimen of what I am willing more particularly to apply my self to, I here hum∣bly offer the following Discourse to your acceptance.
And which I also do with some allowable boldness: Be∣cause upon a subject so suitable to your Design; be∣cause, I am sure, I have at least heartily aimed at my Duty in the management of it: and because it was first drawn up, and is now published, not without your own favourable Aspect and good liking. And if, upon your review, it shall again meet with the same, I shall not only be buyoed up against any ill Reflections that may befall it; but encourag'd to proceed in what I have begun: and to do all that one would do, who aspires to be in some measure useful, and
Sir,
