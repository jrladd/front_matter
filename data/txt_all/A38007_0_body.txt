My Lord,
WHEN I was lately venturing a
little Book into the World, I
fully designed to make choice
of no other Person than Your Lordship
for my Patron: But I soon found my
self unable to pursue my Resolves, and
I let fall my Design on this single thought,
that I being a Stranger to your Lordship,
my Application would be demed Rude
and Impertinent. But I have since con∣quered
that Modesty, and am grown up
to a greater Confidence; and now ha∣ving
another Piece ready (f the like
nature with the former) I here lay my
self and that at your Lordships Feet. It
is Presumption to offer such a mean Pre∣sent
to a Person of your Worth; and a
greater Presumption it is to expose these
Papers to so Severe a Critick, so Judi∣cious
and Celebrated a Writer, so Classick
an Author as your Lordship. But I take

Courage by considering that your Can∣dour
is as eminent as your Judgment,
and that I may have the Happiness to
share in it as well as others. Besides, I
have hereby an Opportunity of Ex∣pressing
my Sense and Esteem of your
Known Worth, which is the Universal
Theme of the World. Why should not I
joyn with the rest of Mankind in ac∣knowledging
and declaring that by your
Excellent Discourses and Writings you
have enlightned the Christian World,
and that by your Unreprovable Exam∣ple
you have most effectually commend∣ed
to it the Practice of Vertue and Reli∣gion?
Likewise, I take here the welcome
occasion of congratulating your Lord∣ships
Accession to the Episcopal Dignity
in our Church, which your Merits alone
have exalted you to.
That your Lordship may Rule in this
High Station with inflamed Zeal for Gods
Glory and the Churches Welfare, and
with a perpetual Blessing from the Chief
Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, is the
Hearty Prayer of,
My Lord,
