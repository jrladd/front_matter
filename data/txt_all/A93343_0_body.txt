My dear Fellow Travellers,
HOwever it is with you now, as to your spiritual state, I am bold to affirm, that the dayes of your first Espousal, as in themselves, so in your own estimation, were very happy and joyful dayes, and you so afflicted for your own former Mis-doings, and so affected with what gracious change, God through his rich Grace then made, that with all your might you did willingly render up your selves to Christ Jesus for your Saviour, and with all free affection and humble submission chose him, or rather
 closed with Gods own Appointment, that this his Son should become your King to Rule you, your Priest to make Attonement for you, and also your Prophet to Teach you; in a word your All in All: Thus at the sight and sense of what Sin and Satan had been, and what now Christ Jesus would be by way of change, your hearts were wonderfully taken up with admi∣ring this choyce, that were not only of Gods preparing to Redeem you from the highest Wrath, but to Redeem you to the highest Glory; I fear your hearts now this change is not so new, is unable to express what once, (though in the time you had less Knowledge) you could have reported of this matter, the sense of Wrath then at Gods unfolding your condition, being so apparent, and the necessi∣ty of a Saviour without which you must perish, being so urgent, put you upon that thought∣fulness of heart, what to do that you might not Perish, but be Saved, and filled your hearts and hands so full of better Business, that Hus∣band, Wife, Children, House, Land, Trade, and whatsoever else till then had been dear to you, now became strange in your esteem; thus did you run well, and of Christ Jesus were known well, your fruit being sweet to his taste, and love in each answered love, with such de∣light, that you could say with David, Whom
 have I in Heaven but thee? and whom in Earth in comparison of thee? Was not then the light of his countenance life to you, and his withdrawings your death? none but Christ could satisfie you, to be talking with him, and walking with him, and whether he is in the Garden, or Wilderness, or any Solitary place, you must be with him; nay, rather could you not bleed with him, than feast without him? thus in nothing more happy than with your Beloved, wondering greatly at this great Grace, that in such a condition should find you, and to such a condition bring you: look back, call to remembrance dayes past, was it not thus with you, and a thousand times more?
But how is it now you have seen some of the depth of Christs love, and born the heat of the day in some measure? Do you love him yet more and more? Is Prayer, Hearing, Read∣ing, Weeping, Watching, Fasting, Doing, Suf∣fering, welcome still? Doth the pulse of your Soul run this way stronger and stronger? The path of the just is as a shining light, that shineth more and more to the perfect day. Are ye able to speak in truth this to be your condition? Or do you grow weary and faint in your mind, thinking now Christs way too strait, his work too great? If it be come to this, then it
 is a piece of the saddest news that ever came to thy Soul; Yet God knows it is no new thing, but an evil too too common among Professors who like Israel of old, thought Manna while new most welcome, yet in its continuance, though Gods own Institution, (which was a reason sufficient why it still should be wel∣come) they loath and term it light Bread; thus were their goodness like a morning cloud or early dew that passeth away: In like man∣ner New Testament Churches, that had fair and flourishing beginnings, yet in time comes to hang down their heads, and grow feeble and faint in their minds; How were the Co∣rinth Church that had been their Apostles glo∣ry and crown, become his sorrow and grief; what bitter messages doth God send to most of the Churches in Asia, complaining that they had fallen from their first love, threatning them with no less than to Unchurch and spew them out of his mouth; such wild Grapes in time, did this once flourishing Church bring forth; and the very complaint of Jeremiah, concerning Israel in them verified, Chap 2. 21. Yet had I planted thee a noble Vine wholly, a right Seed; how then art thou turned into a degenerate Plant, of a strange Vine to me?
My dear Brethren, these are not the tyth of the sad instances that might be alledged of
 such as once were fair and flourishing, yet in continuance of time to a sad degree left their standing, and so incurred Gods sore displea∣sure and severity upon them; all which pre∣mised, proves it so far from being any of our happiness to begin well, though at the rate here mentioned in our Espousal dayes, that truly it will but prove an addition to our un∣happiness, if we shall not end well; for better is the end of a thing than the beginning: All which notes a Christians true good, to consist as in a fair beginning, so both to hold on well, and above all to end well. What Chri∣stian is he, that will not tremble then to con∣sider both old and new Testament Churches, what fair beginnings they made, and yet what dismal ends they came to, as Jude complains, Trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots.
The good Lord help you my Brethren, and my self, to lay this thing to heart, that with fear and trembling, we may work through our Salvation, and from first to last avoyd that damning sin of carnal security, that God knows doth too too much rock many Profes∣sors in our dayes into a deadly sleep, who be∣ing once green and flourishing, still retain a strong opinion of hereafter Glory, though grown as dry and barren as the Fig-tree, that
 Christ Jesus would not suffer to stand.
Thus considering with my self, and mu∣sing in my mind what a fearful thing it would be for me and you, that have had such like be∣ginnings, and have made as great promise of a good conclusion, to fall into the hands of the living God, who will strip us as naked of his Glory (if here we are found wanting) as e∣ver we were born, unless the falling of former Churches prove so our admonition, as he that standeth takes heed lest he fall; for which cause, I have both for your benefit and mine own, gathered together Thirty Symptomes of Growing, and Thirty more of Decaying to Godliness; in the first you may (for present) only read the Signs of Growth; in the second, you may read both the Signs of Decay to God∣liness, with the Causes and Remedies; which with Gods blessing (I humbly pray and hope) may tend to your strengthening, if Grow∣ing; or to your speedy reducement, if Decli∣ning: Read therefore what now by the help of the Lord is brought to your eye, with much seriousness, and while you look upon the Book, be still reflecting both upon the heart and life, with this kind of searching language; Is my case thus, or is it thus? However your own opinions may be of Growth or Decay, they are your Highest Concernment; Enter∣tain
 therefore with all love my poor yet affe∣ctionate Dedication, remembring the Mar∣riage of the Lambe draweth nigh, and his Bride must make her self ready: Be sure then you be not found without your Wedding Garment; but imagine your selves the very next door to Being compassed with the maje∣sty of that day; let the thoughts of it keep you company, in Buying, Selling, Eating, Drink∣ing; yea in the whole course of your Pilgri∣mage, and follow God with incessant Prayers to fill your Souls brim full of the living Worth of hereafter Glory, and the unsupportable weight of its contrary; That to this great end these my poor Labours, and such as these, in the glory of their perfection, may prepare you upon the most acceptable terms for future Glo∣ry; is the true desire of
