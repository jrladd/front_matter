THIS little Treatise (Right Worship∣full) entituled, De re militari: beeing lately found in the Forte in Irelande, where the Italians and Spaniards had fortified thesemlues, by fortune came vnto wy hands by a souldier of good experience, who latly serued there: which after I had perused (& takē the deuise of some of better vnderstan∣ding then my selfe in those affaires, which very much liked and allowed the worke) I was greatly boldned & encouraged to enterprise the Translation of the same, partly because these principall orders are alwaies to bee obserued in warlike gouernement, and chifely because in our English tongue, I finde not the lyke extant, for the necessary instruction and generall commoditie of our common Souldiers: which briefe introduction (be∣ing common in our language) may be an inducement to betrer knowledge, and further vnderstanding, wherby in time our seruitours by good obseruaunce and imi∣tation, may attaine the lyke perfection, that all other forreine Nations doe generally embrace. And finding not any more forward then your Worship, to further and fauour this Martiall knowledge (beeing of your selfe most ready & aduenterous in all exercises of feats of warre and chiualry) I haue therfore presumed (as vn∣knowen) to dedicate this briefe worke vnto you, which as a simple token of my good will, I doe humbly pray you to accept in good part, not doubting but that vn∣der your protection the same shall be sufficientlye de∣fended

and well lyked, and those imperfections in mee the Translator, the better borne withall, wherin I haue rather obserued the true and litterall sence, then anye waies varied from the order of the matter, as the Au∣thour setteth it forth. And euen so referring my selfe and slender trauell vnto your curteous acceptation, wishing you that increase of worship and prosperitie, as euery wayes your noble minde deserueth, doe euen so take my leaue. From Lon∣don the .9. of December. 1581.
