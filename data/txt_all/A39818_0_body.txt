SIR,
ALthough your Favours to me have been so many and so un∣deserved, that I ought to take all Opportunities of acknowledging them; yet the very nature of this little Work seem'd to design You for it's Patron, and almost prevented my Choice. For to whom could I with so

much Confidence address it, as to You, who are accustomed to encourage the Endeavours, and pardon the Im∣perfections of Youth? Many of these Verses were writtn while I was under your Care, and being the Product of Hours which I stole from the ordinary Busness of your School, and employed otherwise than You directed; I am ob¦liged to seize this only Opportunity, which is left me, of making You resti∣tution. I am too sensible, how mean and unworthy a Present I now offer You: oly I hope it may not seem so improper to You, who are daily con∣versing with the ancient Poets, and making new Ones; as perhaps it might

to any of my other Friends, who are generally engag'd, in more severe and serious (though none in more Ʋseful and Honourable) Studies.
Sir, I do not find that I have any great Talent in Complement; and if I had, I should at present think it Ʋse∣less: For I must beg your leave not to be so impertinent, as to open to the World what an honourable Sense I just∣ly entertain of your Worth; since You are placed in a Station so eminent that your Learning and Prudence, your Industry and Fidelity, your Courtesie and Generosity, and especially the Sweet∣ness of your Temper and Conversation, together with all your other Vertues,

must be much better and much farther known, than I can hope this little Book ever will. I shall fully obtain all that I aim at by this Address, if it may be accepted as a Testimony, with what Respect I am,

Fairfield, Nov. 6. 1691.
