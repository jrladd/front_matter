WHEN PHILIP OF
Macedon came to conquere Co∣rinth,
the carefull Corinthians
did fortifie their ruined walles,
some caried stones, some trees,
some lyme, some clenged and dres¦sed
their armour, some taught & trained the neoterick
sogers; no man was found idle to withstand the com∣mon
enemie saue Diogenes, he vn-able for any ser∣vice

in the republick, did roll himselfe in his Tub vp
and downe the streets. One of his familiars asked
what he did: Al the Corinthians (answered Dioge∣nes)
are bussie, and I must be doing some thing: Each
man (my honorable good Lord) at this great Court of
Parliament is bussie, and lest I alone like Diogenes
be noted as idle, I will roll my selfe in these foolish
rymes vp and downe the streetes; that it may be said
I am doing something: the goodes and children of the
bond-man belong to the master: These passions are
my goodes, or rather my children Minerva-like borne
from their fathers brane, without a mother, and so
due to your L. Take then your owne (dear Lord)
from this hand, who according to the antient custome
hath bored his eare with a boidkene, to shew that he
shall still remaine your Honors most faithfully de∣voted
and voluntarie slaue.
