HAuing had some small experience, of
your zealous loue to Gods truth, and
dayly care for preseruing the same, in
most Christian and religious maner a∣mong
you: I could not but expresse
some fruit of mine vnfained affection
towards you. And, as a true testimonie thereof, I send
you this learned and worthy labour, as a poore New-yeares
gift, which was first written by a brother of yours
in our Lord Iesus, and by mee instructed to speake our
natiue English tongue. For I did account it, as a wrong or
iniurie done to you, that a worke of such worth, receiuing
his originall from Gods reformed Cburch among you:
should here bee made publique, and you to haue no ac∣quaintance
at all therewith, or interest therein. To
preuent which inconuenience, in the bonds of Christian
loue and amitie, I dutifully haue directed it vnto you,
desiring (according to the high deseruing merit therof)
that it may not onely haue acceptation among you, but

that it may likewise finde fauour in your houses and fa∣milies,
where it may doe more good, then easly can bee
imagined. So, entreating your best construction, of
this my verie sudden, yet honest boldnesse: I commit you
all, my selfe, and this my poore paynes, to that mea∣sure
of blessednesse, which it shall please
our Lord God (in mercie) to
bestowe vpon vs.
