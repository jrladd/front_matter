SIR,
THough Your Majesty be wholly
busied in the greatest Affairs of
State, in the most Illustrious As∣sembly
that was ever held, I presume ne∣vertheless,
to believe that You will not
be offended that I take the liberty to in∣terrupt▪
You for a moment, and offer unto
Your Majesty this small Treatise, the read∣ing
of which can only surprize those that
are ignorant of Your Majesties Life; for
since this containeth the most celebrated
Events of History, extracted out of the
Writings of the most famous Authors, all
the World will own that the Miracles
which make Your Character, surpass the
greatest and most astonishing Exploits here
related. It is for this cause, Sir, that my
silence will better express the profound
Veneration that I have for the Grandeur

of Your Majesties Actions, than all the
Elogies wherewith the ardor of my Zeal
were able to Inspire me: Nevertheless,
Sir, if I may be perswaded to judge of Your
Intentions by Your Proceedings, all that
Glory which shineth so bright in the Eyes
of Men, is not that which dost most affect
You; by so many Great and Heroick Acti∣ons
You aspire to something yet greater.
You know, Sir, that Kings who are truly
so, esteem not Soveraign Power but as a
thing ever ready to furnish them with op∣portunities
of meriting the Love of Na∣tions,
by being Authors of the Publick
Happiness.
Your Majesty hath this Great Truth
Ingraven upon Your Heart, and if in the
beginning of Your Reign we have admired
in Your Majesty the Hero and the Conque∣ror,
we hope ever to Adore the Restorer
of the Common Liberty of Europe. I am,
with a profound respect,
SIR,
