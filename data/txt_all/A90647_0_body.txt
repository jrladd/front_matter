I Have presumed to dedicate this short Treatise to you, as having by long and sad experience found, that of all places in this Kingdome, this City, notwith∣standing the great means which hath been used by the Magistrates to the contra∣ry, is yet contaminated by the infamous vice of gaming, whereby many young-men of good e∣ducation being sent from their parents in severall countries hither to gain a trade or way of living, have by sundry provocations been by little and little drawne to this vice, which having once u∣sed, they have found so much sweetnesse in this dulee venenum, that they have not left sucking this poysonous bait, till they have thereby brought themselves to much poverty, penury, want and misery, besides the consideration of the unbe∣commingnesse
of so sensuall a vice in such sad and distracted times, wherein the judgments of God are in an extraordinary manner powred forth up∣on us; this and other sins, which this big-bel∣lied monster (as the ensuing Treatise proves) dai∣ly produces and brings into the world, I could not but among the throng of Books (with which the presses have been a long time oppressed) but expose these few sheets to the publique view, which although it containe not in it matter of Newes, (a thing much sought after) yet the sub∣ject having not lately been treated of, may af∣foord new matter to the itching eares of many Athenians, and I doubt not but will find accep∣tance with all ingenious Patriots: I will not trouble you any longer with a tedious Inducti∣on, least I make too wide a doore for so mall a structure; but leave it to your perusall, hoping it may affoord some benefit to all honest Youth of the Kingdome in generall, and your selves in particular; with whom I leave my poore endea∣vours in this kind, and rest.
