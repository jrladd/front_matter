SIR,
WHat you desired is done. I exa∣mined, and in ten dayes of Au∣gust last Answered the Trea∣tise against Superstitious Jesu-Wor∣ship. Encouraged, not altered since, its now come the Kings High-way unto you. Not to flatter, it knowes no sinister end; nor to insinuate, it feeles no disiunction. As you are religious, a Gentleman, and a Scholar, value it in no relation to mee. J shall not then lose by you, nor you by
 my gaines. Grant my request, and call the worke yours. To bee yours is enough mine. Deny this and me

Decemb. 31. 1642.
