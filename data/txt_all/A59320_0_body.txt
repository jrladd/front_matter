Madam,
WHen I consider what favou∣rable
Reception my first
humble Supplications in
this kind have had from
your Graces hand, I can∣not
think my Duty fully
paid, nor my Adoration sufficiently exprest,
till I Dedicate my whole Life and Labours
to your Grace. 'Tis not one act of De∣votion
that can make a Zealot; and there∣fore
as I made a Present then, I pay you

a Tribute now. And though this Poem
has but little Merit of its own, yet en∣couraged
by the Honours it has received,
like Pages to Princes, it owes its Boldness
to its Education; and since your Grace
gave it leave to be a troublesome Guest at
New-Hall, it lik'd the Entertainment so
well, that it resolves to Live and Dye
there; and 'tis an Ambition in some respect
to be justified; for Poetry should always
make up part of the Trains of Princes,
especially theirs whose Excellencies are so
Divine a subject for it. Vnder that shelter
I approach your Grace, when I must own
I have play'd the Plagiary in making the
Dutchess of Albemarle the Pattern for my
Roxolana; only with this difference, that
I have copyed below the Life. Your
Grace has all her Vertue, without the al∣lay
of her Vanity; and this advantage above
her, that Your Grace possesses those Charms
which Story never attributed to Roxolana;
Her Beauty could subdue, but not secure her
Solyman. But your Graces Victories are
more compleat; For if our English Chro∣nicle

(spight of the fashionable liberty of
a Licentious Age) would Character the per∣fect
happiness of a Princely Pair, it must
describe the Influence of the Dutchess of
Albemarle over the unalterable Affections
of her Lord: And as in Duty to such
eminent Virtues; & such infinite Perfections,
even the most ill-natur'd Age unanimously
speaks of your Grace with Veneration;
and to secure that Fame your Virtues have
so justly acquired, your Grace is as Cauti∣ous
in the Preservation of it: But so im∣pregnable
are your Sacred Principles of
Honour, that your Graces Care in that,
is but like His, who raises Bulwarks to
defend that Town, which of it self before
was inaccessible; nor can I more reasonably
impute the Duke of Albemarles, and your
Graces more frequent Residence at New-Hall,
to any other than a true English Noble∣ness;
as knowing that your Greatness can
better fill a Court than make a part of one.
I could be very prolix on so excellent a
Theam, for 'tis easie to Write where all
Man-kind Dictates▪ and I must confess 'tis

the highest Bliss of an Authour, to have
those Patrons whose Merits are above Flat∣tery,
where the Titles of Great and Good
may he given without a Blush. This made
Horace speak so largely in the Commenda∣tions
of his Maecenas, and Juvenal say so
so little in the praise of Trajan: For my
part I account it my chief Happiness to have
been a Witness of your Graces Greatness,
and my highest Contemplation to be an Ad∣mirer
of it. The humblest of which Ad∣mirers,
is
Madam,
