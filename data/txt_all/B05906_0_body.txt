MAy it please YOUR MAJESTY,
IT is generally a Token of the Worth and Ex∣cellency of a Book, when those concerned in it, adventure to place in its Front the Name of a Prince; This therefore hath imbolden'd Me GREAT SIR, to praefix Your most August Name to this Work, which, if I
may be allowed to carry the Parallel so high, is amongst Books of Marshalry and Horsemanship, what Your Royal Person is amongst Men.
It needs not then (I think) be thought very strange, if I have presumed upon the Choice of so mighty a Patron; for to whom could I have so justly Dedicate the best of Books in its kind, as to the most Clement, Heroick, and Best of Kings, and (which is most agreeable to my Subject) the most Accomplished and Graceful amongst Horsemen? Of the first whereof, Your Majesties most happy Subjects feel the good effects, and of the Latter Your great∣est Enemies bear witness, and therefore cannot but acknowledge it; for SIR, Your great Wisdom and Conduct, as well as singular Courage, force them all to confess, that You are among the Number of the most Glorious Mo∣narchs that ever Reign'd.
I am therefore Hopeful, that as Your Majesties extraordinary Valour hath
brought these Islands once again to the Practice of Arms, so this Translation, assisted by Your Royal Approbation and Protection, will not only instruct them, to raise a Breed of Warlick and Serviceable Horses (till of late almost quite out of Fashion amongst us) but also teach them to train them up, for the benefit of Your Majesties pub∣lick, and their own private Diver∣tisement; That as we are a People, who delight as much in Horses as any Nation in the World, so we may be Inferior to none, in the true Knowledge of every thing relating to them.
Big with these Expectations, and also hoping Your Majesty will pardon this bold Attempt, I humbly lay it at Your Royal Feet, and shall Repute my self too Happy, if you Vouchafe it but the least favourable Glance. Now that God may Prosper Your Majesty, in all Your Great and Glorious Undertak∣ings, and give You a Long and Happy
Reign, to the Joy and Comfort of all Your Loyal Subjects, is both heartily Wished, and fervently Prayed for, By
GRACIOUS SIR.
