My LORD,
HAving, many Years agon,
when your Learned and
Judicious Treatise of the
Laws of Nature was first
published, carefully perused it to my
great satisfaction, I also thought it
necessary to make an Epitome, or
Abridgment of it, as well for my
own better Remembrance, as that

I believed it might be also useful,
as an Introduction to Ethicks, for
some near Relations of mine, for
whom I then designed it. These
Papers, after they had lain by me
several Years, I happened to shew
to some Friends of mine, (and
in particular to the Honourable
Mr. Boyle;) who so well approved
of the Undertaking, that they en∣couraged
me to make it publick, as
that which might give great satis∣faction
to those of the Nobility and
Gentry of our own Nation, (as well
as others of a lower rank) who ei∣ther
do not understand Latin, or
else had rather read Epitomes of
greater Works, than take the Pains
to peruse the Originals. Which Task,
tho' not very grateful to me, yet
I was prevailed with to undertake,
and to look over those Papers a∣gain,
and add several considerable

Passages out of the Treatise itself;
and this not for Fame's sake, or the
honour of being thought an Au∣thor,
since I was satisfied, that no∣thing
of that nature could be due
to one, who does not pretend to
more, than to Translate or Abridge
another Man's Labours: Yet I am
willing, in pursuance of your Lord∣ship's
Principle, to sacrifice all these
little private Considerations to the
Publick Good, as being sensible, that
in the Trade of Learning (as in o∣ther
Trades) divers, who cannot be
Inventors, or chief Merchants, may
yet do the Publick good service by
venting other Mens Notions in a
new dress; especially since I have
also observed, that things of this
kind, if well done, (and with due
acknowledgment to the Authors
from whence they are borrowed)
as they have proved beneficial to

those whose Education, or constant
Employments in their own Profes∣sions,
will not give them leave to pe∣ruse
many Volumes, written perhaps
in a Language they are no great
Masters of; so also, they have not
failed of some Commendation from
all Candid Readers. Thus Monsieur
Rohault's Abridgment of Des Cartes's
Philosophy, and Monsieur Bernier's
of Gassendus's, (to mention no
more) have been received with ge∣neral
Applause, not only by all In∣genious
Men of the French, but also
of our own Nation, who understand
that Language.
And the Learned and Inquisitive
Dr. Burnet hath thought an Under∣taking
of this kind so useful for our
Nobility and Gentry, as to give us
his own elegant Translations, or ra∣ther
Abridgments in English, of his
two ingenious Treatises of the Theo∣ry

of the Earth. And I doubt not,
but your Lordship would have done
somewhat in this kind, with this ad∣mirable
Work of yours, had not
the constant Employments of your
Sacred Function, as well as your o∣ther
severe and useful Studies, hin∣dred you from it.
But, perhaps, it may be thought
by some, that this Task hath been
very well performed already by
Dr. Parker, late Bishop of Oxford, in
his Treatise, entituled▪ A Demonstra∣tion
of the Laws of Nature, and there∣fore
needs not be done over again.
But to this I shall only say, that as
he hath borrowed all that is new
in that Work from your Lordship's
Book, so it is with so slight an ac∣knowledgment
of that Obligation,
that since he owns himself behold∣ing
to you for no more than the
first Hint, or main Notion, no

wonder if he hath fallen very short
of the Original from whence he
borrowed it, both in the clearness,
as well as choice of the Arguments
or Demonstrations, and in the par∣ticular
setting forth of those Re∣wards
and Punishments derived (by
God's appointment) from the Na∣ture
of Men, and the Frame of
Things; which can only be done
according to that exact Method
your Lordship hath there laid
down. Tho', I confess, there is one
thing that is particular in that Au∣thors
Undertaking, (viz.) That ex∣cellent
Account he there gives us of
the great Differences and Uncertain∣ties
among the most famous of the
Heathen Philosophers, concerning
Mans Soveraign Good, or Happiness,
chiefly for want of the certain be∣lief
of a future state, and that clear
conviction we now have, that Mens

chiefest Good or Happiness consists
in God's Love and Favour towards
them: As also his observation, That,
notwithstanding all that can be said
of the Natural Rewards of Vertue,
and Punishments of Vice, nothing
but the reasonable hope and expecta∣tion
of Happiness in a Life to come,
can in all Cases bear us up under all
the Miseries, Sorrows and Calamities
of this. And herein I must own
I agree with him; and therefore
hope your Lordship will pardon me,
if I have in the ensuing Discourse
insisted somewhat more particular∣ly
upon these future Rewards and
Punishments, which I doubt not
may very well be proved from Rea∣son,
and the necessity of supposing
them, in order to the asserting and
vindicating God's Justice and Pro∣vidence:
Tho' I grant, that the Go∣spel,
or Divine Revelation, hath gi∣ven

us more firm grounds for this
our Belief, than we had before by
the mere light of Nature.
But supposing this Work of Bi∣shop
Parker never so well perform∣ed;
as I do not deny, but it hath
all the advantages of a Popular and
Gentile Stile, and that neat Turn
he gives to all his Writings; and
therefore I have not scrupled to
transcribe, out of his Discourse, one
or two Passages, where I thought
either his way of urging your Lord∣ship's
Arguments, or the close sum∣ming
them up, was not to be mend∣ed
by any other Pen: Yet since (as
I have already observed) the whole
is not done from your Lordship's
Work, and is also too concise, and
full of Digressions, and besides wants
your solid Confutations of Mr. H.'s
Principles, it seems necessary, that
another Treatise more exact in the

kind, should be published as more
agreeable to your Lordship's Origi∣nal:
Whether this which I now pre∣sent
you with, be such, I must sub∣mit
to your Lordship's and the Rea∣der's
judgment.
But since I have undertaken this
difficult Province with your Lord∣ships
approbation, it is fit, that I
give you, as well as the Reader,
some account of the Method I have
followed in this Treatise, and where∣in
it differs from yours.
First then, to begin with the Pre∣face,
The substance of it is wholly
yours, except the Introduction con∣cerning
the usefulness of the Know∣ledge
of the true Grounds of the
Law of Nature, in order to a right
understanding of Moral Philoso∣phy,
nay Christianity itself.
But for a Conclusion to the Pre∣face,
I have also made some Addi∣tions,

wherein. I have shewn your
Principle of Endeavouring the Com∣mon
Good, is not a new Invention,
but that which several Great Men
had before delivered, as the only
firm Rule, by which to try not only
all our Moral Actions, but all Ci∣vil
Laws, whether they are right and
just; that is, agreeable to right Rea∣son,
or not. And I have also con∣cluded
it with a set of Principles,
very necessary to be understood, for
the proving the Truth of all Natu∣ral
Religion, and the Law of Na∣ture,
tho' the two last alone are the
Subject of your Lordship's Book,
as well as of my Abridgment of
it.
But to speak more particularly
of the Discourse itself, since I here
design no more than an Epitome, I
hope your Lordship will not take it
ill, if I have omitted most of your rare

Instances and Parallels drawn from
the Mathematicks, many of which
are above the capacity of com∣mon
Readers, (tho' therein your
Lordship hath shewn your self a
Great Master) and have confined
my self only to such plain and easie
Proofs and natural Observations as
Men of all capacities may under∣stand.
So also if in the Chapter of
Humane Nature, I have left out
divers curious Anatomical Observa∣tions,
wherein the Structure of Mens
Bodies differs from that of Beasts,
if I thought they were at all que∣stionable
or doubtful, or such as
did not directly tend to the pro∣ving,
that Mens Bodies are fitted
and ordained by God for the Pro∣secution
of the Common Good of
others of their own Kind, above
all other Creatures.
I have also made bold to con∣tract
the Chapters in your Work,
into a lesser number, having dispo∣sed
the substance of them into o∣ther
places, or else quite omitted
some, as not so necessary to our
purpose: As for example, I have
placed most of the Matter of the
third Chapter, De bono naturali, part∣ly
in the explanation of the word
Good, in our Description of the
Law of Nature, in the third Chap∣ter,
reserving what remained of it
to the second part for the Confuta∣tion
of that Principle of Mr. H.
That no Action is Good or Evil in
the State of Nature. So likewise
for the fourth Chapter, De Dicta∣minibus
Practicis, I have set down
the Substance of it (omitting the
Mathematical Illustrations) in our
second Chapter of Humane Na∣ture.
So also the sixth Chapter,

entituled, De iis quae in Lege Natu∣rali
continentur. And the seventh
and eighth, De Origine Dominii, &
Virtutum Moralium. I have partly
disposed the substance of them into
the first Chapter of the Nature of
Things, but chiefly into your fourth
Chapter, reducing all the Laws of
Nature, and Moral Vertues therein
contained, into this one Principle,
of Endeavouring the Common
Good of Rational Beings. But as
for your last Chapter, viz. that
part of it which contains the Con∣sectaria,
or Consequences deducible
from the foregoing Chapters, in re∣lation
to the Law of Moses, and all
Civil Laws; I have made bold to
omit, since it is plain enough, that
all the Precepts of the Decalogue
do tend either (in the first Table)
to the Honour and Glory of God,
in his commanding himself to be

the sole Object of our Worship,
and that without any Images of
himself; or else (in the second
Table) to our Duties towards o∣thers,
wherein the highest Vertue
and Innocence are prescribed. And
so likewise, that all the Laws of the
Supreme Civil Powers have no Au∣thority,
but as they pursue this
Great Rule, or Law of Nature, of
procuring the Common Good of
Rational Beings; that is, the Ho∣nour
and Worship of God, and the
Peace and Happiness of their Sub∣jects,
and of Mankind in general:
And whereas your Lordship hath
here also solidly and briefly confuted
many Gross Errors in Mr. H.'s Mo∣rals,
as well as Politicks, some of
those Confutations I have made
use of in the second Part, viz. those
that relate to that Author's Moral
Principles, which, if they are false,

his Politick ones will fall of them∣selves.
To conclude, I must beg your
Lordships Pardon, if I have made
bold to alter your Method, as to
your Confutation of Mr. H.'s Prin∣ciples.
For whereas you have thought
fit to do it in the Body of your
Work, and as they occurred under
the several Heads you treat of;
since I perceiv'd the placing your
Answers after that manner, did di∣sturb
the Connexion and Perspicui∣ty
of the Discourse, I thought it
better to cast those Answers into a
distinct part, digested under so ma∣ny
Heads, or Propositions, in the or∣der
in which they stand in Mr. H.'s
Books, de Cive, and Leviathan, where
the Reader, if he pleases, may com∣pare
what I have quoted out of him.
And I hope your Lordship will
not take it amiss in me, if (to ren∣der
the Work more pleasant and
grateful to common Readers, and
that it may not look like a bare
Translation) I have added several
Notions and Observations, some of
my own knowledge, and others out
of History, and the Relations of
Modern Travellers, concerning the
Customs of those Nations com∣monly
counted Barbarous, who yet
by their amicable living together,
without either Civil Magistrates, or
written Laws, serve sufficiently to
confute Mr. H.'s extravagant Opi∣nion,
That all Men by Nature are
in a State of War.
I have likewise presumed to add
those Aphorisms of Good and Evil
contained in Bishop Wilkins's Trea∣tise
of Natural Religion, and
Dr. Moor's Enchiridion Ethicum, that

the Reader may see them all at
once, tho' I confess they are most
of them to be found (tho' dispersed∣ly)
in your Lordship's Work. I have
also inserted some things, in answer
to the Objections at the end of the
first Part, out of that noble contem∣plative
Philosopher, Mr. Lock's Es∣say
of Humane Vnderstanding;
since he proceeds upon the same
Principles with your Lordship, and
hath divers very new and useful No∣tions
concerning the Manner of At∣taining
the Knowledge of all Truths,
as well Natural, as Divine, and the
Certainty we have of them.
But, I fear, I have trespass'd too
much upon your Lordship's Pa∣tience,
by so long an Epistle, and
therefore shall conclude with my
Prayers for your Lordship's Happi∣ness
and Health, since I am confi∣dent
you cannot but prove more

useful for the common good of our
Church and State, in this high and
publick Station to which Their Ma∣jesties
have thought fit to call you,
than you could have been in a more
private Condition: And I hope
your Lordship will look upon this
Dedication as a small Tribute of
Gratitude, which all the World must
owe you for your Learned and
not Common Undertakings, of
which Obligation none ought to be
(or indeed is) more sensible than,
My LORD,
