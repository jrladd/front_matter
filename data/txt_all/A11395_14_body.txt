THy friendly censure of my first ESSAIE
(Du Bartas FVRIES, and his BABYLON)
My faint Endeuours hath so cheared on,
That Both His WEEKS are also Ours, to-day.
Thy gracious hand, repriuing from decay
My fame-les Name, doom'd to Obliuion,
Hath so stirr'd-vp my Soule's deuotion,
That in my Songs thy Name shall liue for ay.
Thy milde acceptance of my simple myte
(Pattern and Patron of all vertuous drifts)
Doth heer again my gratefull Muse inuite
To re-salute thee with mine humble gifts;
Indeed, no Gifts, but Debts to Thy desart:
To whom I owe my hand, my head, my hart.
