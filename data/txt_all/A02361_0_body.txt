Most worthily honour'd:
BOund by your many bounties to some publike

seruice of acknowledge∣ment and gratitude; I could not in al my poore faculties, finde any so neere fit for your graue acceptance, as this last of my aged labours. Which, though a worke farre from all worth of receit and countenance, of so many exempt and exem∣plarie Iudgements, and learning, for elocution, and substance; yet for the good suggestion of the subiect and obiect; I pre∣sum'd you would not dis∣dayne it, euen your owne noble names inscripti∣ons.

Good Motiues be∣get good actiues; and the speedie way to proceede deaths victor in the con∣templatiue man, is, to practise in the Schoole of the Actiue. There is no such schoole as yours, to teach the conquest of corruption and iniustice; which euery man must first subdue, before hee conquer their conque∣rour. I suppose therefore, I set all mens steps in the way to his conquest; in shewing them your Olym∣pus (where all equall and Common-wealth Com∣bats

are consummate) in my therefore bold dedi∣cation to you. Besides, when combats were an∣ciently intended; Hercu∣les (the Father and Fau∣tor of combats) was in∣uok't; and all your vnited vertues, composing one Hercules; in exploring and extirpating, all the priuie Thefts and violen∣ces of inhumane iniu∣stice, (whose conquest is necessary Vsher to the Combats and conquest of death:) to whom but to your Herculean facul∣ties, could this Combat,

with so sacred decorum be consecrated? And your still willing-to bee-well-employed old Seruant, holding these humane readings and writings, no vnfit contentions for his age to sweate in; hee hopes your most ho∣nour'd and liberall impu∣tations will allow him; not to carry your club idlely, nor for onely of∣fice or fashion. But be this allusion held too light for your grauities. My humble endeuour to serue you worthily, I am sure is serious enough.

And therefore, (euen for the diuinitie of his Presi∣dent that accepted the Will in his weake ser∣uant for the worke) I thrice humbly implore, your religious imitati∣ons; resting
