Most valorous and religious King,
YOur Magnanimous and Heroi∣call spirit in Martiall and Mi∣litary affaires; And your zeale, fidelity, and unshaken unmoveable constancy in the establisht Religion of Gods Church in this Your English Nation, fills the hearts of your loyall subjects, the Lords servants to praise the God of Heaven for You; And to pray earnestly, that hee, that hath covered your head in the day of battell,
would bee alwayes as tender over You as the Apple of his owne eye, and so preferre You as the Signet on his right hand, and that the gifts of Gods wisdom and grace may be doub∣led on You his Anointed servant.
Your gracious acceptance of my former endeavours hath incouraged mee not only (to compose this short discourse of the Churches publike Order, for the true worship of God, which declares the outward form of the Chur∣ches service, as the former Treatise Dedica∣ted to Your Majesty doth the inward truth of the Church it selfe) But also to presume to present it to Your Royall and serious con∣sideration, for as much as many of Your honest Subjects want the knowledge of it; And all Your factious people, oppose, contemne, and hate it, even those weeds spring up amongst the good Corne; As Brownists, Anabaptists, Papists, Familists, Antinomists, with solly and Semi Separatists, all which having

light of the pure truth like smothering fire and smoake, have destroyed many weake Chri∣stians, yea such an universall destruction, as the plagues of Aegypt made in that land, on an and beast, fruitfull Trees and every reene hearbe, but blessed bee the Lord for he good will of him that dwelleth in the bush, hat hath blessed Your Royall Head, and Heart, like the head of JOSEPH, that still ou have beene the same Anointed with the ame truth, in which truth, the Children hereof are your truest loyal'st and faithfull'st ubjects, of whom although the most unworthy  your Highnesse servant that suffereth and eleeveth with you,
