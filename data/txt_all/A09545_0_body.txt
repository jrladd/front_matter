MOst hopefull Prince, Europaes richest Iem,
Successor to these famous westerne Iles,
Chast Oliue Branch, descended of that Stem,
Whose, what he hath, all on thy fortune smiles:
Inheritor to such a Potent Kingâ–ª
As no Age yet, his Like could euer bring.


Braue Pearle of men, within whose louely Face,
The sacred Muses learned Arts combine,
And all Heauens gifts from great Apollos Race,
Apparant seeme within thy Browes to shine,
Thy Fathers Doran, kingly workes of State,
This more then needs, as borne but out of date.


Yet Royall Prince, let but thine eyes behold,
This lofty Subiect in these Rurall Rimes,
T'will more encourage then Earths purest gold,
To make my Muse to all succeeding times,
Blaze forth thy parts and high deserued Fame,
That thy rare worth may all the World inflame.



As in a Garden of sweete fragrant flowers,
Where each man takes what to his mind seemes best,
Then sits him downe within their pleasant Bowers,
Peruseth all, and for a Time doth Rest,
Contented, Ioy'd (Admiring) to haue found;
So great a change, in one small piece of Ground.


So deerest Prince, within thy Fathers workes,
What Poesies sweete, Graue sentences diuine,
Sad morrall matter in each Subiect lurkes?
To draw thy youth to trace him line by line,
Whilst this may chance to recreate thy mind,
As glimmering Luna in Sols absence shin'd.


Persist go on, and as thy Vertues won,
The Loyall Loue of euery faithfull heart,
So to the end, thy course (directly) run,
And winged Fame shall from thee neuer start,
But scale the Cloudes and mount the lofty Skyes,
To sound thy worth as farre as India lyes.
