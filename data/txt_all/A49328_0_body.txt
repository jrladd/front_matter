MADAM,
Were I not fully per∣swaded that this Dramatick Piece in the Original is one of the best

that hath been presented upon the French Stage, I should not have presu∣med to offer the Copy to the best of Queens, and indeed the most Juditious of Women: If I have failed in my judgment of the Authours work, I am indisputably right in the Character of my Patroness: Your Majesties goodness in pardoning this presum∣ption, and in approving the Plot and Language o the Play in my Version

hath begotten this fu∣ture ambition in me, to publish it under the fa∣vour of your Royall pro∣tection, which will secure it indubitably from the malevolent censures of any ignorant, arrogant, or malignant person what∣soever. If in the inter∣vals of your high contem∣plations your serious thoughts shall descend to divert them a little, as before, so now after the Dedication and Im∣pression,

in reading those Sceanes, I must ever esteem it an unparalel'd honour to me, who am,
MADAM,
