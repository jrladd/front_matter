MADAME,
THIS small
POEME, (a late
Birth of myne, and
so meanly clad, as
poore Art it selfe is euen asham'd of
it) I should scarce haue ventured to
present vnto your Ladishippe, had I

not more then hop't, that the Excel∣lency
of the Subiect, would (in
your iust Esteeme) haue kept at
least in equall Ballance, my wants
in writing it.
I am to professe (Madame)
so many extraordinary fauours, by
which your vnwearyed Goodnes
hath euer pleas'd (aboue my deserts)
to honour me, as I am forc't to seeke
out some more then ordinary way, to
shew my selfe in Will, theyr grate∣full
debtour, in Ability I cannot
hope. Therefore Madame, remay∣ning
still your debtour in the Prin∣cipall,
all I am able, and intend to
do, is to call as many others as I can,
into the Interest of the Debt with
me; by letting all know (who from

the reading of this little VVorke,
may receaue eyther Profit or De∣light,
that they owe it wholly to
your Ladyship.
By this means perceauing, that I
was like to draw your Name, as
Party, into the Reputation of this
VVorke, I thought it would best be∣come
my Care, as it did my Duty,
(who otherwise as you will see, haue
affected nothing in the writing it)
so to prouide, as none might receaue
offence, or harme by reading it. Of
which happines (though somewhat
rare in these Tymes, and more in
such Workes) being secure in its
Innocency, and my Well-Mea∣ning
it, it dares with the more
Confidence, and cheerfulnes ap∣proach

vnto your Ladyshippe, to
leaue in your fayre Hands, a perpe∣tuall
testimony of his Respect, and
Duty, whome your Great Ver∣tues,
& many Deserts haue wonne
to be
