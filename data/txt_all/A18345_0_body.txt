MY Lord, this Dedication can be no novelty to your Honour, who were formerly acquainted with the intention. I doe but here per∣forme what I heretofore did pro∣mise. Your owne skill in the ori∣ginall is such, that I might have spared the courtesie of the Tran∣slatour, but that I was ambitious to have more then one Countrey take notice of that service I owe unto You; who shall ever thinke it the greatest part of mine, to have had sometimes a relation to your Honour: If there be any thing in it which may deserue your perusall, it is beholding to the Subject, not to the Authour. It may have the happi∣nesse to be presented to his royall Eye, which I cannot hope for, save by the meanes of your Noble Father, or your Selfe: The strangers that were desirous to come to Christ

to Philip for admittance, and I know no other me∣thod, no neerer way to approach the Majesty of his An∣noynted then by him, who beares the name of that Apo∣stle, or your Noble selfe upon whom his Royall Majesty bestowed his owne Name at your baptisme: and, it may be thought, conveyed withall not a few of his vertues, whereof I here present you an imperfect picture, rudely drawne by an unskilfull hand, wherein I dare assure you of nothing good but the bare intention. May it please your Lordship to accept of it as a propempticon before that voyage you are now to make, from him who doth heartily wish you a prosperous journey, and a happy re∣turne.
