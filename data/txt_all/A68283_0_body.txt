A Iust King (which like a single eye fixt in the righteous scepter of God, and by diuine ordi∣nation sent as a bright Angell of his worship to gouerne amongst the children of men) is hye∣roglyphically represented by figure of the sun. For as a vertue which vertueth other inferiour Starres, it holdeth the golden bridles of the day: whose seate is therefore by preheminence esteemed most noble, because as a iust Iudge placed in the middest, it equaly distributeth light to those other Planets, giuing grace to Saturnes grauitie, might to Iu∣piters maiestie, fortitude to the force of Mars, beneuolence to the beautie of Venus, pith to the persuasion of Mercurie, with con∣stancie to the Moones mutabilitie by the royall gouernment of his equall power and diuine sapience, which moderateth all vn∣stayed perturbations of his people, as the Moone doth (by noble influence from it) restraine all turbulent and outragious billowes

of the violent seas, being through domination of this seuenth sphere so metaphysically kept within their bounds, that they can∣not transgresse nor vsurpe vpon earth. The Sunnes Chariot also (representing the iudgement seate of imperiall authoritie) drawne by foure horses figuring the foure columnes of royall maiestie, deciphered in these insuing offices, leadeth him through the Zo∣diak of the twelue Morall vertues; in and through which hee raigneth and gouerneth vpon earth in comfort, peace, and plentie, blessing the foure mightiest Princes of this world with the light of his countenance: as in ministring fire to Vulcanus, to Pal∣las the gray morning and balmy verdure of Ayre, which repurifi∣eth her vnderstanding with knowledge; to the great towering Goddesse Ops that motherly fruitfulnesse, which crowneth Ce∣res, Bacchus, Minerua, Pales, with corne, wine, oyle, and milke; lastly, to Neptune and Thetis, that infinite seed ingendred and multiplied of them in the waters: so that those foresaid Elements (out of whose vertues all creatures liuing & vegetant are by diuine ordinance composed) receiue life, and influence from the Sunne. This kingly Planet likewise holdeth dominion ouer the torments of hell; which should seem to be made out of the excesse and poi∣son of those foure Elements; as is euident by those angels which fell from the three hierarchies for their sins in pride, disobedience, Barth. Cassan. in  ter∣ partis catal. gor. mundi. sloath, wrath, enuie, lecherie, and gluttonie: for by the diuine musicke of Orpheus, these furies and torments were appeased, so that hee brought thence his wife Eurdice. For Phoebus is by the philosophicall Poets mythologically called, the God and Patron of Musicke, Prophecies, and Chirurgerie: which was to life expressed by that holy King Dauid, who (being both a blessed Prophet, and diuine in lyricall musicke) had by force of his melodie charmed that euill spirite, wherewith King Saul was possessed. Onely the chyrurgeries wherein true Prin∣ces are principally skilled, appeare in the saced notice and cure of those inward diseases and griefes that infect and ma∣cerate their flockes, which they like good and fatherly Shep∣heardes should heale with good Lawes and Discipline. And yet your Grace, hath that oyle of grace and comfort pow∣red vpon you more then your fellow-princes, to cure all mis∣chieuous and infistulated impostumes which GOD smiteth

vpon the iawes of his people, to make your glories the more in healing, and his glories infinite by those blessings bestowed vpon your annointed hands (which diseases are otherwise remedilesse) being a diuine gift from aboue to that holy King Edward your Maiesties antecessor, and after him to the rest of his sanctified seed by sacred direction legacied, as hath formerly beene to the Kings of France also. Wherefore your Highnesse (being Vnctus in regem & sacerdotem cum vnguento laetitiae super omnes terrae reges socios tuos) fitly resemble this bright Planet in his cleerest Maiestie; euen as that most sacred Psalmist King Dauid also, both for your Poeticall faculties, as in respect of your diuine Priest-hood, and chirurge∣rie, hauing by good experience (more then any man liuing euer did) tasted of the wonderfull wisedome and loue of God; who by such strange wayes surpassing humane reason, hath wrought out your Graces fortune in the weale of vs your louing and loyall subiects, farre beyond all the wily machinations, plots, and ima∣ginations of men, which haue (as your Royaltie well knoweth) beene manifoldly frustrated; that it might bee performed which God had ordained and promised by the mouthes of diuers sooth∣saying Augers, to perfect and establish in your seede the true try∣umphant and vniuersall Christian Monarchie. Howbeit as no man liuing can haue a sweeter taste or cleerer declaration of Gods vnspeakable power (beyond all the soundest counsels & resoluti∣ons of our mortal Princes) then your Grace hath had in all actions; considering the strange meanes that hath been wrought by God through the plots of men destined to other purposes, to make your name glorious, and that your royall seede might inherite this Empire: so neede wee not doubt but that like a good Physi∣tion, your Maiestie (as it hath already graciously begun the cure of some small diseases in this kingdome, which God onely left vn∣to your gacious wisedome, that the whole body might be kept cleane and at ease) shall auspiciously continue the same, to be the same vnder the golden rodde of your right royall posteritie for∣euer, by strong purgation and correction of the proud, cholle∣rick, and melancholick humors thereof, which is the true methode of a kingly Phisition, and shall doubtlesly bring the head and whole bodie to perfect peace, and health.

Against the Sunne (vpon which no reasonable creature can stedfastly fixe his mortall eyes, least they be dazeled, infeebled, or blinded with the pretious cleeretie thereof (being another type of sacred Maiestie) that imperiall bird soueraigning ouer the swift fethered creatures of the ayre by nature opposeth his sight: as Orus Apollo writeth in his hieroglyphiks, how the Sages of Aegypt and Chaldaean Priests (whē they would signifie diuine power, humane Empire, preheminence, blood, or victorie) did pourtraict an Ea∣gle. What miracles he findeth through his stedfast, sharpe, and penetrating inspection within that sanctified Orbe of bright ver∣tue, may be referred to those misticall naturallists, which in the Metaphysicall cardes of their reason haue obscurely shadowed those things, that by mythologies are out of many curious heades from farre shot at, by some neere hit, and by very few truely tou∣ched. Caius Iul. Caesar (to whom this Land with others contributed) gaue in his ensigne of golde, a blacke Eagle perpendicularly mounting: which Plinie noteth in the nature of that bird. For it is written, that ouer Caesars Hoasts when he marched to fight, di∣uers Rauens and Vultures did houer, and that two Crowes pro∣digiously with their wings and tallons eager in combination, strooke at his Beuer; wherupon auspiciously came an Eagle which (combating against their violence) slewe them both; and then immediatly perched vpon his imperiall crest. This ominous prodigie by the Augers was interpreted sinisterly, that Caesars insuing gouernment should be tyrannous: since which time the Romane Emperors haue alwayes borne in their ensignes that roy∣all bird, with which fortunately spreading his wings against their enemies, the Romanes did generally tryumph in many victories, and conquests. This Eagle also viuely representeth vnto vs, your Maiesties person, being onely your Highnesses scepter-bearing bird, with siluer fethers; which with his auspicious wings sha∣doweth the crownes of this Britaine Monarchie with peace of soule and bodie rooted in your blessed posteritie for euer. Vpon earth next to the Sunne and ayre, that aufull Magistrate (if of his Maiestie men may so terme the Lyon, bearing the scheme and fi∣gure of magnanimitie, which hath dominion ouer foure-footed beasts) is another portly representation of a perfect Prince: for

he despiseth dangers, remēbreth & obserueth him that shal woūd his bodie, thogh he be impaled with millions of men; thē he mer∣cifully spareth which vpon his pursuit prostrate their bodies; wo∣men and children (vnlesse vpon extreme hunger) he wil not hurt. Vigilancie (being another right royall garbe of a carefull prince) was portended by the picture of alyons head; forsomuch as that beast onely sleepeth with his eyes open: Qui tanquam sol patenti ig∣neoquèoculo Bart. Cassan. 78. consid. 12. partis catal. glor. mundi. terram conspicit. This noble creature in the person of for∣titude vpon the right hand supporteth the royall Escucheon of your imperiall crowne, assisted in our late deare soueraignes, and your Maiesties famously remembred sisters gouernment with prudence and vigilancie, portended by the Dragon; and since her death (if it may bee so called) with temperance, not exchanged; but as with the perfections of all vertues relieued, or reuiued ra∣ther in your Highnesse Vnicorne: of all these your blessed Ma∣iestie royally participateth, as in the person of a true vertuous, and sanctified king vpon earth. Vile is that wretched analogie, which the corrupt Florentine Secretarie Nicolo Machiauelli seruant to Duke Petro di Medici, did in his puddle of princely policies produce be∣twixt a true Prince and a mixt monster; resembling him (by the Il. Prencipe cap. 18 comm se debbe osser∣uar la fede. example of Achilles who was instructed by Chyron the Centaure) vnto a lion & fox, importing his strength & caution in all affaires: whereas it is well knowen, how no true prince can aptly be com∣pared to that vnsauory curre, if the very royall minde (which amply possesseth euery iust King) bee respected. For why not much more fitly might the comparison of Kings with Eagles then with base Foxes haue sorted, if that imperiall birde which in op∣position with his eye-brightnesse amiably looketh into the sun, can search, and penerate into the perfection of wisedome and knowledge, being figurately shadowed in Phoebus or Apollo, bearing also with him the thunderbolts of Iupiter (who mystical∣ly reueileth soueraigne Maiestie) to grinde, burne, and consume into powder the violence of his enemies? semblably me seemeth, that there should not be found any such difference in the state and condition of Princes, which the subtile Italian Sanazar made of a Pope in his time; that he was Bonus Princeps & malus vir: because he knew well how to gouerne, and did rule the people well, hauing

no proper facultie (by moderation of his owne appetites) to bee good vnto himselfe; for as Cicero citeth it out of Ennius, Nequicquam sapere sapientem, qui sibiipsiprodesse nequierit: (being intended there by the minde onely) so certainely cannot any Prince be verely good vnto himselfe, if he doe not gouerne his flocke (which is the grea∣ter part of himselfe) in the feare of God and exercise of Iustice: whence it was that Homer termed Agamemnon in one place, : and in another part : aswell for the pastorall charge, as for the prudent counsell and assiduitie required in him towards that function. Sanctitie & Iustice therefore (as I first said) by the propagation, corroboration, and aeternization of all crowns and Monarchies, are the two maine pillars of principalitie; being those inseperable adiuncts of your right royall Maiesties lawfull and victorious quadruple crowne of Great Brittaine, France, and Ireland, composed of the 4. cardinall vertues, which in this ensuing myrrour, framed out of the 4. immediate ministers or columnes rather of kingly Maiestie, with all humble dutie subiecting thē im∣polished as they be, to your princely eyes, I present to your royall hands, vnder a special pardō for my boldnes in daring as a poore vnlearned Scholler (which offereth his ignorance in some rude exercise vnto his learned Schoole-master) to trouble your sacred Maiestie with these imperfections. Howbeit, as euery man which writeth ought to rest vpon & leane vnto the grace of his Patrone; so can it not choose, but that hauing chosen so gracious a Patrone, farre exceeding all other in goodnes, I shall finde more true grace and beneficence out of your royall nature, for this one Caracter of my bounden dutie respected by such a Soueraigne, then by the be∣neuolence of any subiect And therefore I presumed to your high Grace, being the Castalian spring head (which the Greek Sages did say to be patronized by that bright Lord of wisdome & Poetrie) thinking there (after my labours) to refresh my troubled sences: where though vnworthy to tast, yet shal I receiue some ingenuous alacritie, by seeing that pure & preciously-purling current. And that I may the more to my consolation contemplate the royall sun-shine and serenitie which enuironeth your sacred temples (though your Grace lay not apart the beames of your Maiestie) yet vouchsafe I beseech, with your diuine annointed hands to an∣noint

these eyes of your humble subiect with the balmie dew of your gracious beneuolence, that I may bee the better inabled to looke vpon that consecrated Orbe of true maiestie; for had I been so timerous or faint, as in the regard of the vnworthinesse of my Booke protected the same by some priuate friend: then had I somewhat withdrawen from worth of the matter, which (how∣soeuer the methode and disposition thereof deserueth) doth also merite a royall Master, and had miscarried in the manner of my proceeding also: thinking that because these foure insuing estates immediately ministring vnder all crownes in euery Com∣mon wealth, are protected by royall soueranitie, your Grace was fittest also to patronize these my simple studies wholy conuersing in the properties and attributes of those Offices; which shall bee most highly honoured by the maiesticall protection of such a vertuous King, to his poore subiects exceeding comfort. My consi∣deration therefore was, that your Highnesse out of the Princely nature, which God with your Essence hath infused, would deigne so simple present of a poore Scholler, with the beneuolence which your Grace natiuely doth extend to learning: and that being hereafter published vnder that high Title many learned eyes, and curious fingers (not so much for the matter & forme of the Trea∣tise, as for the Maiestie patronizing it) would peruse these yong rules in this vnperfect accedence to gouernment, and percase beare them through diuers of your Maiesties Kingdomes.
I haue also through my whole discourse (as occasiō serued) in di∣uers places made a continuall Apostrophe to your Maiestie, which I beseech your Highnes (euē as it is in sinceritie) so to refer it vnto the true meaning of my most dutifull & immaculate hart towards your Grace, and not to any vaine singularitie, nor presumption in my self. The God of al true light cōtinue that illumination, bright∣nes, and wisedom, which appeareth in your true graces, by that fi∣gure of the Sun; confirme that piercing inspection, apprehension, & prenotion of all princely deuises, wisdoms & practises, which may be bent in opposition to your Maiestie by forren kings, de∣cyphered in that imperial Eagle; & corroborate that true fortitude to the confusion of Gods & of your Highnesses enemies, which is expressed in the royal Lyon; so that your kingdoms being sustei∣ned, amplefied, & conserued by Iustice, prudence & fortitude frō

posteritie to posteritie through many generations, so long as it shall please God euenly to susteine this earth in her owne place within the firmaments, such serenitie may beame forth from your gracious wisedome; as foreuer may moue the peoples hearts of these your Kingdomes, of all your confederates and contributo∣ries, to daunce inwardly with praise and thankefulnesse vnto God, for that blessing which through your Graces speciall goodnesse infinitely succee∣deth to Gods people vnder your imperiall Scepter.
