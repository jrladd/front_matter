I Humbly craue your Worthinesset excuse
This boldnesse of my poore vnlearned Muse,
That hath presum'd so high a pitch to flye,
In praise of Vertue and Nobility.
I know this taske most fit for Learned men,
For Homer, Ouid, or for Virgils pen:
But for I with him haue both seru'd and sail'd,
My gratefull duty hath so farre preuail'd,
Boldly to write true Honours late decease,
Whilst better Muses please to hold their peace.
And thus much to the world my Verse proclaimes,
That neither gaine nor flattery are my aimes:
But loue and duty to the Noble dead,
Hath caus'd me cause these Lines be published.
And therefore I entreat your gen'rous Hearts,
T accept my duty, pardon my deserts,
Beare with my weakenesse, winke at my defects:
Good purposes doe merit good effects;
Poore earthen Vessels may hold precious Wint,
And I presume that in this booke of mine,
In many places you shall something finde,
To please each Noble will affected minde.
And for excuse my Muse doth humbly plead,
That you'l forbeare to iudge before you read.
