My Lord,
THough your design'd
Favours to me might
justly claim this offer
of my Respects in a Dedicati∣on,
yet I must own, That it is

not only Gratitude that re∣quires
me to make this re∣turn,
but it is my Choice and
Judgment that prompts me
to take the Liberty of put∣ting
this Piece under▪ your
Protection. And indeed, if
I regard either the Greatness
of your Family, or your own
Personal Endowments, where
could I have found a more Il∣lustrious
Name, or a more
generally own'd Desert.
The Sydneys have fill'd our
English History, and adorn'd
our Nation; Great in Em∣ployments
both at Home
and Abroad, but more Glo∣rious
in asserting constantly
their Country's true Interest:

And your Lordship has not
been wanting to follow such
Honourable Examples, first,
by a steddy adherence to all
the measures that could be
entred into by a wise man in
times full of dark designs;
and then (as soon as your
Countries Good requir'd it)
by boldly laying aside all
dubious Counsels, to appear
in Arms with our Great and
Glorious Deliverer, His Pre∣sent
Majesty.
Amongst the Thanks we
owe to all those who have
done the like, I think no one
can more justly be extoll'd
by this, or recommended
to the esteem and admirati∣on

of the next Age, than
your Lordship.
In your Negotiation in
Holland, during the close In∣trigues
of the latter end of
King Charles his Reign, you
strove to keep both him and
us happy and quiet, by pro∣moting
the true Interest of
both: But when the Ferment
of our Affairs forc'd you to
more sensible demonstrations
of your thoughts, you No∣bly
chose rather to appear an
ill Courtier, than be thought
an ill Man to your Country.
The Protestant Interest carri∣ed
it with you, while the Ro∣man
Faction thought their
designs as secure as they

were deeply laid. 'Tis rare
to find such Conduct and
Courage in a Publick Mini∣ster:
But what could be ex∣pected
less from one ready to
venture his Life in the Field at
the Head of our Nation a∣broad,
against that unquiet
Monarch who was then inva∣ding
all the Liberty Mankind
had left.
Heaven, My Lord, has at
last bless'd these constant
endeavours for England's
Prosperity, and we see you
in the Councils and Priva∣cy
of a Prince born for our
Felicity.
The Great Queen of this
Monarchy, who so lov'd her

People, and understood their
Interest, had a Sydney for
her Favourite, and such a
man as she admir'd living,
and lamented dead; and our
King, who has begun with
restoring this Nation to its
true Interest, and will, no que∣stion,
advance its Glory to the
highest pitch, has your Lord∣ship
in his Councils and Arms,
Guarded by you in the day,
he sleeps often under your
care in the Night, safe in your
Loyalty, and pleas'd in your
attendance.
To whom then could I
more properly offer these Ar∣canums
of a Wise Govern∣ment,
than to one who must

be a good Judge of all Wri∣tings
of that kind; and there∣fore
with repeated Offers of
my humble Respects, and rea∣diness
to obey your Lordship's
Commands, I take leave, and
am,
My Lord,
