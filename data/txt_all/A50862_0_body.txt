DEARE COUSIN,
I Know there are diverse that will wonder at me, yea those that know me best, that after many yeares spent in the Lords harvest, I should bring a few scattered eares, in such a plentifull crop of all kind of fruitfull books, that are daily brought into the Lords barne, I question not, but I must undergoe some censures of some that will say, they that are most learned are most loath to be seen in print, but the lawyers position shall be my apollogy that those a∣ctions that proceed from the passion of love, are not liable to law, at least pardonable in respects, It was love to the reve∣rend Divine deceased, that induced me to publish these me∣ditations, for yours and mine, and others preparation to our desolution: that through the weaknesses we feele in our bo∣dyes, and the examples of mortality before us continually, we may study Moses Arithmeticke to number our dayes,

that we may apply our hearts to wisdome.Psal. 90.12. True it is, the flesh is inclosed with many feares, forced to so many helps, so perplexed with its owne frailty, as the numbring of our dayes to be so short, is not so difficult, being so unable whe∣ther, we gaze abroad, or looke at home, to promise our selves any long immunity, either from the decayes, or desolution of our mortall constitution, but to number our dayes as we should is a very hard worke, seing the flesh is insnared with such idle hopes of longer life, being blinded with wanton shews, busied with deep designes, benummed with false de∣lights, that for the most part of us we consume our time, and consider it not, we heap up sin and feare it not, lie chayn∣ed in death and wrestle not against the sting of it, slip into the grave, and perceive it not, wherefore if the Lord here doe cast his cloudy countenance upon us, it is that we should watch against the weaknesse of our flesh, which is then re∣diest to sleep when temptation is nearest, yet if the streame of temptation carry us into sin, the Lord in his compassion cureth us, and yet in his love corrects us, if at any time he mingle our bread with care, and lodge us in the bed of dis∣comfort, yet being driven to any strait, or exigent in this world, rather then we shall want heavenly consolations it shall raine Manna, and rather then ove shall thirst, the rockes shall yeild water, and our afflictions are but to weane us from the flesh-pots of Egypt, and to advance in the way to Canaan: what though the wicked be like the bramble, who in confidence of their shadow dare challenge to be Kings over the trees of the forrest, and our selves like sheep, are ei∣ther fleeced of the shearer when we are growne in wooll, or snatched up by the butcher when wee are growne in flesh, yet when death hath made us both even with the earth, the grave shall be to us a fold till our great shepheard shall ap∣peare, but to them a shambles, till the destroyer of their

soules shall have received an endlesse commission to tor∣ment them: what cause then have we, to shut our gates against the gaspes of death, or like trembling leaves to entertaine the gale or blast of Sicknesse, which doth but prune our feathers, the more easily to fly towards our abiding city. These thoughts of death to a mind mortified, and seasoned with the feare, and seated in the favour off God, cannot chuse but be welcome, though to the covetous and carnal wretch,Mar. 5.17. that hath all his desires like the mole scraping in the earth, they shall fare as Christ did among the Gadarens to depart from them, when he was but coming neare them.
I have therefore presumed, deare Cousin, from whom I have received so many volumes of bookes, thus farre to in∣trench upon your modesty, as having most right unto the same, to entreat you that this papery monument of your de∣ceased Husband which still lives in your heart, that it may be shadowed with your allowance, and accepted of me as a thankefull acknowledgement of the worth I knew in him being such a masterpiece for imitation that this carping, and iron age, that frowneth most on them that are freest from profanesse, could not but approve him, to be zealous of the truth of God, painfull in his calling, carefull of his flocke, peaceable and blamelesse in his life, and comfortable and constant in his death.
Now that God which hath begun, and wrought many good things in you be pleased to direct you still in every saving grace, that so in the end of your dayes you may re∣ceive the end of your fayth even the salvation of your soule, which is the earnest prayer of
