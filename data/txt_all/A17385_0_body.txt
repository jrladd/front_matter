MADAM,
BY reason of my Lords absence, and your Honours, a great part of the yeare past, I have had more leisure, than I desired, and thereby oppor∣tunity to write out my notes on the first chapter of Peter, and not knowing which way to testifie so fully as I ought, my observance, and duty to your Honor, or to satisfie the daily oppor∣tunity of many friends, I have adventured againe to come under the Presse, that so (receiving daily an increase of favors from your Honor,) I might thus publikely take occasion to professe my vowes of service and thankfulnesse, beseeching your Ho∣nor to vouchsafe the acceptation, protection, and perusall of this abridgement of those Sermons, ma∣ny of which your Honor hath bin pleased to heare with great attention. As for the desire of many goy friends herein, I should not have beene easily inclined to hearken to it (the world abounding with bookes even to loathing) but that in writings of this nature, and upon this Epistle, there is some want, and that I have received incouragement

from the acceptation of my former labours, and that I know the matter herein contained is whole∣some, and not unprofitable; and besides having suffered an involuntary vacation in my weeke∣daies attendance in your Honors family, and an extreame losse in the want of divers of my chiefe bearers, I was resolved to try, whether I might be helpfull to the Church of God abroad, by such an imploiment of my selfe in the houres I could spare from my study for the Lords day. My most hum∣ble request to your Honour is, that you would bee pleased to grace these notes with the liberty to passe under the protection of your name, and favour; I should much rejoyce, if the reading hereof, may make any supply of my intermitted service to your Honor, and your worthy family. The God of mer∣cy and father of glory (that hath abounded to∣wards your Honor, not only in the outward hap∣pinesse of unstained nobility, greatnesse of meanes, and favour with the highest on our earth: but which is greatest of all, in the unsearchable riches of Iesus Christ, in the largenesse, and eminency of many singular gifts, and in aboundance of all good workes) make you perfect to doe his will, and worke in you an increase of al that is pleasing in his sight, that you may never lose, what you have wrought, but be kept without offence till the day of Iesus Christ.
Isleworth, Iuly 1617.
