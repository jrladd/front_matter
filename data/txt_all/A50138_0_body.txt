May it please Your Lordship,
IF it be considered, that some Evangeli∣cal and Apostolical Histories of the New Testament, were by the Direction of the Holy Spirit Himself, Dedicated unto a Person of Quality, and that the Noble Person Addressed with One such Dedication, enter∣tain'd it with Resentments that encouraged his dear Lucilias to make a Second; the World will be satisfied that I do a thing but Reason∣able and Agreeable, when, unto a Narrative of many Evangelical and Apostolical Affairs, I presume to prefix the Name of one so Excel∣lent, for Love to God, as Your Lordship is known to be; and One upon this account only, an Ʋnmeet Subject for the Praises of the Obscure
 Pen which now writes that Quis Virtupe∣rat? I do not, I dare not, so far intrude up∣on Your Honour, as to ask Your Patronage unto all the New English Principles and Practices which are found in the Character of our Celebra∣ted ELIOT; for, as the Distance of a Thousand Leagues, has made it impossible for me to attend the (usual) Orders and Manners of asking first your Allowance for what I have open∣ly Entituled you unto; so, the Renowned ELIOT is gone beyond any occasions for the greatest Hu∣mane Patronage.
But that which has procured unto your Lord∣ship, the Trouble of this Dedication, is, My Desire to give you the Picture of One Aged Saint, lately gone to that General Assembly, which the Eternal King of Heaven by the Ad∣vances of your own Age in the way of Righ∣teousness, does quickly Summon your Self un∣to. The profound Respect which our ELIOT had for your Honour, will doubtless be answer∣ed and requited with your own Value for the Memory of such a memorable Christian, Mini∣ster, and Evangelist; inasmuch as, Your Af∣fections, like his, take not their Measures from these or those matters of Doubtful Dispu∣tation, but from such an universal Piety, and Charity, and Holiness, as he was an Instance of.

No Man ever complained of it, that in the Works of Chrysostom we find Seven Orations not far asunder, in Commendation of Paul; nor is it any fault that I have now written One in Commendation of a Man whom a Pauline Spi∣rit had made illustrious. In describing him, I have made but little Touches upon his Paren∣tage, and Family, because as the truly Great Basil excuses his Omission of those things, in his Oration upon Gordius the Martyr, Ecclesia haec tanquam supervacua dimittit. But I have related those things of him which cannot but create a good Esteem for him, in the breast of your Lordship, who are a Faithful and An∣cient Witness against those Distempers of the World, whereby (as the blessed Salvian lament∣ed it) Cogimur esse Viles, ut Nobiles habea∣mur; and raise the sweetness of your Thoughts upon your Approaches, which may our God make both slow and sure, unto that State, wherein, The Least is Greater than this JOHN. But if I may more ingenuously Confess the whole Ground and Cause of this Dedication, I must own, 'Tis to pay a part of a Debt; a Debt under which you have laid my Country, when you did with your own Honourable Hand, Present unto His Majesty the same Account which I have here again Published, Concerning the Success of the Gospel among the Indians in New-Eng∣land.

My Lord, in one ELIOT, You see what a People 'tis that you have counted worthy of your Notice; and what a People 'tis, that with ar∣dent Prayers bespeak the Mercies of Heaven for your Noble Family. Indeed, it is impossible that a Country so full as New-England is, of what is truly Primitive, should not be exposed unto the bitterest Enmity and Calumny of those that will strive to entangle the Church in a Sar∣dian Ʋnreformedness, until our Jesus do shortly make them know, that He has loved what they have hated, maligned, persecuted. But if the God of New-England have inclined any Great Personage to Intercede or Interpose for the preven∣tion of the Ruines which ill men have designed for such a Country, or to procure for a People of an Eliot's Complexion in Religion, the Ʋndisturbed Enjoyment and Exercise of that Religion: It is a thing that calls for our most sensible Acknowledg∣ments.
It is an odd Superstition which the Indians of this Country have among them, that they count it (on the penalty of otherwise never prospering more) necessary for them, never to pass by the Graves of certain Famous Persons among them, without laying or leaving some Token of Regard thereupon. But we hope that all True Protestants will count it no more than what is equal and pro∣per, that the Land which has in it the Grave of such a Remarkable Preacher to the Indians
 as our ELIOT, should be treated with such a Love, as a Jerusalem uses to find from them that are to prosper.
Ʋpon that score then, let My Lord accept a Present from, and for, a Remote corner in the New-World, where God is praised on your be∣half; a small Present made by the Hand of a Rude American, who has nothing to recommend him unto your Lordship, except this, that he is the Son of One whom you have admitted unto your Favours; and, That he is Ambitious to wear the Title of,
MY LORD,
