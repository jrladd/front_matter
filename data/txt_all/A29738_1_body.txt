IF we consult Antiquity, it will be found, that the generality of Physicians for a suc∣cession of Ages, did rather rely on the dis∣coveries already made by the immortal Hippocrates, than endeavour to find out new ones. They esteem'd themslves suffi∣ciently qualified for their Office by the knowledge of his Writtings, in which they believed all Medical Skill as comprehen∣ded; so that in process of time they came to be of such Authrity that to entertain Sentiments of the Nature and Cure of Dis∣eases differing from these already received, was a Heterodony not to be tolerated. And


obtained till Galen's dayes, who had the confidence to dissent from Hippocrates, the great Restorer of Medicine, about the Na∣ture and Cure of Several Diseases, which for the most part he strains to a Theory a∣greeable to the Philosophy of his time, that pesters not only Medicine, bu Theology like∣wise, and that to this day. And thô in the Aetimology of Diseases he wreasts the Symp∣tomes to his pre-conceived Notions; yet such was the genius of the succeeding Ages, that they were content to follow him as a Pa∣tern, and to acknowledge him for a Text; so his Works in succession of time came to be equally esteem'd with Hippocrat's, and then nothing was to be received that was not agreeable unto them. And as this for some Ages did manifestly hinder all ad∣vance in Medicine, so of necessity it cre∣ates a vast Opposition to all new Inventions; of which the Physiological Discoveries in the beginning of this Age are an Instance with a witness. And thô they had the demon∣stration of our Senses to support them; yet the Credit and Reputation of the ancient Theory, (that was quite overturned by them) was such, that with difficulty they were brought to have reception. If it so fared than with the Discoveries that were not

only reasonable, but demonstrable by our Senses; what can we expect shall be the Fate of those that have not that advantage to pretend to? especially if we consider that what we plead for, is, A new Cure of Fevers, that is, to encounter the opposition of the received practice of all former Ages; which generally speaking was far more so∣lid than the Theory.
I should indeed then both fail of my de∣sign, and evacuate the Merit of my At∣tempt, (so be it may justly challenge any) if I should offer this my Mite to the advancement of Medicine, and not do it with all the imaginable Circumspection, and Obser∣vation capable to mitigate that opposition, and make it acceptable; As first, not to present and submit it to you, whose Experi∣ence in Medicine, is able, solidly to determine whether the reasoning here be conclusive or not: And whose Probity and Candor, will never suffer you in a matter of such import, to be byassed from proferring the Sentiments of a well ballanced judge∣ment; to you then I offer it to be serious∣ly considered, whether or not the me∣thod I here endeavour to vindicate, shall not only through time, be without censure, but at length, (as some of the most emi∣nent Physicians in this place, are already

of Opinion) will wholly prevail, to the great Credit of Medicine and the inesti∣mable good of Mankind▪ which will indeed fully satisfie the longing wishs of him that is.
