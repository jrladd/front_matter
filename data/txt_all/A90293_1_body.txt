READER,
THou canst not be such a stranger in our Izrael, as that
it should be necessary for me, to acquaint thee, with
the first sowing and spreading of these Tares in the
Field of the Church, much lesse to declare, what di∣visions
and thoughts of heart, what open bitter con∣tentions,
to the losse of Ecclesiasticall peace, have beene stirred up a∣mongst
us about them: onely some few things relating to this my par∣ticular
endeavour, I would willingly premonish thee of.
First, Never were so many prodigious errours introduced into a
Church, with so high a hand, and so little opposition, as these into
ours, since the nation of Christians was known in the world, the chiefe
cause I take to be, that which Aeneas Sylvius gave, why more main∣tained
the Pope to be above the Councel, then the Councel above the
Pope, because Popes gave Archbishopricks, Bishopricks, &c. but
the Councels sued in forma pauperis, and therefore could scarse get
an Advocate to plead their cause: the fates of our Church having of
late devolved the government thereof into the hands of men tainted
with this poyson, Arminianisme became backed, with the powerfull
Arguments, of praise and preferment, and quickly prevailed, to beat
poore naked truth into a corner: It is high time then for all the lo∣vers
of the old way, to oppose this innovation, prevailing by such un∣worthy
means, before our breach grow great like the Sea, and there
be none to heale it.
My intention in this weake indeavour, (which is but the undige∣sted
issue of a few broken houres, too many causes in these furious ma∣lignant
dayes, continually interrupting the course of my studies) is
but to stirre up such, who having more leasure, and greater abilities,
will not as yet move a finger, to help vindicate oppressed Truth.
In the meane time I hope this discovery may not be unusefull, espe∣cially
to such who wanting either, will or abilities, to peruse larger
discourses, may yet be allured by their words which are smoother then
oyle, to tast the poyson of Aspes that is under their lips: Satan hath
, depths where to hide, and methods how to broach

his lies: and never did any of his Emissaries employ his received ta∣lents
with more skill and diligence, then our Arminians: labouring
earnestly in the first place to in still some errors that are most plausible,
intending chiefly an introduction of them that are more palpable,
knowing that if those be for a time suppressed, untill these be well di∣gested,
they will follow of their owne accord: wherefore I have endea∣voured,
to lay open to the view of all, some of their foundation errors,
not usually discussed, on which the whole inconsistent superstructure is
erected, whereby it will appeare, how under a most ine pretence of
furthering Piety, they have prevaricated against the very grounds of
Christianitie: wherein
First, I have not observed the same method in handling each par∣ticular
Controversie, but followed such severall waies as seemed most
convenient to cleere the truth and discover their heresies:
Secondly some of their errors I have not touched at all, as those
concerning universall grace, justification, the finall Apostacy of true
beleevers: because they came not within the compasse of my proposed
method, as you may see Chap. 1. where you have the summe of the
whole discourse.
Thirdly, I have given some instances, of their opposing the recei∣ved
Doctrine of the Church of England, contained in divers of the
39. Articles: which would it did not yeeld us iust cause of further com∣plaint,
against the iniquitie of those times whereinto we were lately
fallen: Had a poor Puritan offended against halfe so many Canons, as
they opposed Articles, he had forfeited his livelihood, if not endangered
his life: I would I could heare any other probable reason, why divers
Prelates were so zealous for the discipline, and so negligent of the Do∣ctrine
of the Church: but because the one was reformed by the word
of God: the other remaining as we found it in the times of Popery.
Fourthly, I have not purposely undertaken to answer any of their
Arguments, referring that labour to a further designe: even a
clearing of our Doctrine of reprobation, and of the administration
of Gods providence, towards the Reprobates and over all their
actions, from those calumnious aspersions they cast upon it, but con∣cerning
this, I feare the discouragements of these wofull dayes, will
leave me nothing but a desire: that so necessary a worke, may finde a
more able Pen:
