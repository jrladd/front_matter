SIR,
THE Translation of the old Dramatick Poetry be∣ing as yet in its Infancy, re∣quires the indulgent Patro∣nage of some Eminent Person whose Wit and Iudgment intitle him to a Right of Saving or Condemning it; but especi∣ally one whose own Perfor∣mance has abundantly con∣vinc'd the World that it may be done, and that better by Us than our Neighbours. Sir, were it not too great a Tres∣pass upon your Modesty, I wou'd insist upon the Easiness of the Stile, the Politeness of the Expressions, and the Delica∣cy

of the Turns in your Bella∣mira, even in those parts of it which are purely Translation. The Consideration of these and many other Accomplishments, makes me fear this mean Per∣formance will scarce merit the Pardon, much less the Prote∣ction of so compleat a Patron: But however, shou'd Such a one be pleas'd to accept of this Trifle, mean as it is, it will un∣doubtedly be an Encourage∣ment for greater Wits and abler Pens to proceed in the same Design, to the Improve∣ment of our Language, and the Honour of our Country. And this is the utmost and only Aim of▪ Sir,
Your most Humble and Devoted Servant.
