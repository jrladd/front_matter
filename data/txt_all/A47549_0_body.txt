I dedicate these my strange, happy, and unfor∣tunate Adventures.
Terrible Sir,
I Dare not question but that you have read the famous story of our Brother Man-Devil, and shook hands with many of his Baboons, danc'd a otch Horn-pipe with his Dragons, & taught any of his Cat-a-mountains to play of the irginals; but all this is from the purpose, the ry I am to relate is more wonderful, and lmost) as true (if not altogether.) Were St. orge now living, I could teach him twenty yes to cut up a Dragon, and instruct fa∣ous Guy of Warwick, twice as many waies Carbonado a dun Cow; and with another ck that I have, he should kill Colbrand the at with a Poddgun; though Captain Drake

was a brave fellow for the Sea, and could swim like a fish, yet 'tis well known to most of the valiant Dutch-men, that I can drink like a fish; and though he could bore a hole in the side of a ship, I can pierce one in the head of a Kilderkin, and in fire-work I have as much skill as he, my nose shall make it good, which did but drop once into a barrel of Gun-pow∣der, and it blew up a whole Leagure, but I must confess such a fire-work hath cost many a man his whole estate, and so it did mine; but what hath any man to do with my nose, my name is Firedrake; nay I have an unmerciful name, for my name is called Water Firedrake, and all the world knows fire and water are un∣merciful Elements, then sure I think the Sea-Captains must confess mee the better Drake, i respect I am as well for fire as water, and beleeve the man that kills mee were as goo run thorow fire and water, for he shall find mee then a Man-Drake; but leaving this lon Epistle, I will proceed to the adventures  him
