WHere witty Bertault (in his Fancy) meant
But a faint Praesage of His Pr. of France;
Our Hopes of Ours the better to aduance,
We haue presum'd to cal a PARLAMENT
Where Royal Vertues, from Olympus sent,
By seueral ACTS of sacred Ordinance,
Conform, confirm Your future Gouernance;
So please it Heav'n Yor hart & hand consent.
O! please it Heavn, You may be pleased Thus,
These Works to imitate, These Acts to act;
To proue yor self, This same PANARETVS,
When future Age shal see our Hopes in Fact.
Wch, while I pray; sweet Prince, in humblest sort
I cite Yor HIGHnes to This Soverain Court.
