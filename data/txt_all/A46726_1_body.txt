May it please your Worships,
SInce I had the honour of being presented by your Worships to be Mr. Jones's Preacher at Newland, I have had the op∣portunity and satisfaction of being fully assured of the faith∣fulness and integrity in the management of all his Trusts in these parts; and not only so, but I have also had the profitable experi∣ence of many great and extraordinary kindnesses from you, in so∣much that as I have always admired and commended your Justice in the one, so I hope I shall ever with all gratitude acknowledg your goodness in the other; as a particular Testimony of which, I beseech your Worships to accept of this present Dedication of the follow∣ing Sermon, which tho' it was baited into the World by the loud Clamors that were rais'd against it, yet it comes voluntarily to your Worships to make an humble offer of it self to your serious peru∣sal and Service: and the Author is the more bold to send it on that particular errand, that you who are his worthy Patrons, may at once have some account how he spends his time, and what grateful appre∣hensions he hath of your noble Favours too, and if in this he may be any ways serviceable to your Faith, he will be the less concerned at what others say of himself, for tho' his Credit and Reputation are always dear to him, yet he is well contented to be reviled and re∣proached, so the interest of Christs Truth and Gospel may be ad∣vanc'd, especially if he may any ways contribute thereunto on your Worships behalf, for he is resolv'd always to endeavour and Pray for the Peace and Prosperity of all your worthy Society, be∣cause he is,
