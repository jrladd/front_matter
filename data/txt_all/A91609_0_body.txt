ACcording to my undoubted duty in discharging my Conscience of fulfilling the will of Iesus Christ, I doe present to both Houses of this Honourable Court, the greatest and most generall cause of the particular grievances of Christ Iesus, and his servants, the upright, the innocent, and tender in conscience; which as it did in speciall manner concerne my Sove∣reigne Lord the King, from whose hand it might most seasonably have been cast
upon the consideration of this high Court, from whence onely do issue all politicke acts, statute-lawes, and ordinances, con∣cerning matters Ecclesiasticall and Civill within his Majesties Realme of England, I procured to be presented to his High∣nesse owne hand in Ianuary last, 1640. The copy of the passages therein con∣teined; lest those should sleep, I have here again recited, and do present them unto you: accept & peruse them as you see cause.
And this be pleased to take notice of; as the Lawes of Divine and Civill Policie admit not of two heads in one body, so likewise doth not the transcendent and glorious Kingdome of Christ, which is above the humane element, admit of Ci∣vill Lawmakers in confining conscience and disposing of matters thereto belong∣ing; the same Scripture and reason which denieth Caesar to sit on Christs throne; denieth you power of making Lawes for the ordering the Lawes thereof, who shall increase or diminish the liberties, Lawes, and privileges of the Gospel of Christs Kingdom, but they must incurre the curse,
and who shall be wiser than his maker but to his owne destruction?
The cause aforesaid of all grievances of Christ and his servants is oppression of conscience, otherwise conscionable op∣pression, for so it is taken, although it be impossible, being oppression, so to be; the root from whence it springeth, the tree, and every part of it, is discovered by the following passages, to which I referre you.
And that you may not be found false in the trust committed to you by the King and Countrey, for the ordering of the af∣faires of this Land, for the peace and wel∣fare of the Church of God, and likewise of the King and Common-wealth; let it be your speciall care to remove and repeal all things and statutes, tending to the bondage of conscience, be not wiser than the Tri∣nity in continuing and establishing penall acts, and statutes, to bring people under conformity, in externall worship; if you consider from whence every good and spi∣rituall gift is, who it is that giveth light, what it is that is acceptable to him, to whom all worship is due, and that Law,
Do unto all as you would they should do unto you: yee cannot, neither would ye go about Antichristian-like, to make yokes for conscience, it is most Papisticall, and why will ye do what yee condemne your selves in others? do not correct Tyrants with tyranny, but overcome evill with good: if you fear Papists wil be treacherous to State & Common-wealth, let them have a civill providence over them for preven∣tion, and in case they or any of them prove so, as some prove naught and treacherous of all Religions, let them have civill cor∣reclion; for it is that, not conscience keep∣eth people in generall within bounds of Civility, and leave the cutting off, or rooting out of errours in matters spirituall to the free use of the sword of Gods Spirit, which is sharper than a two-edged sword; and fear yee not but in case of liberty of con∣science, true Religion, which onely is of God, will have the upper hand, and ful∣lest approbation of all civilly disposed persons; if it be not Caesars due, to sit on the Ecclesiasticall Throne, nor any mans beside, look you to it, how you set or con∣tinue
any person thereon; and except God had consecrated and set apart a parcell of the earthly revenues for spirituall uses, how dare ye powers of the earth to do it, or to allow of it? but to avoid tediousnesse, I commend you to the serious minding of the following passages, hoping you will not slight what is substantially appli∣able to your selves, by the injunction of the will of the Lord Almighty, lest yee be found resisters of God: and so I remain yours in all due service, even to my power and life.
