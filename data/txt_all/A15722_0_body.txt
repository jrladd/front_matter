RIGHT Honourable, there is no child of GOD, but either hath, or must shortly wrastle with Death, and Hell. A con∣flict so terrible, that not onely the sweat will bubble through the brow; but the very bloud will trickle downe within the ribbes.Iob. 6. 4. Thus Iob was a Butt for the Almighty to shoot at: Oh, his spirit was drunke vp with the ve∣nim of his Arrowes.Psa. 77 9. 10. 6. 3. 38. 2. 3. How oft was Dauid at the brim of despaire? what cryings, what roarings were there, before his conscience could he still'd?Isa. 38. 13. 14. Hezechias chatters like a Crane, or Sllow, wh the Lord brake his bones in peecs like  Peter bitterly weepes,Mat 26 75. Luke 18. 13. Rom 7. 24. 1. Tim. 1. 13. the Publican thumpes himselfe and Paul cannot leaue his sighing, to think of   Persecution, and Oppression, the cursed fru
 his former ignorance. For Preparation against this Agonie, I thought it fit to treat of the rare History of the Syro-Phoenician, in that solemne and Hono∣rable Assembly, whereunto I was newly cal'd. Whereon while my thoughts were attending, I was suddenly cast vpon my bed of sicknesse, and so became more disabled for so great a taske, which yet I ende∣uoured to performe, as the Lord gaue vtterance.
And being by some intreated to divulge it, I vt∣terly denied, as conscious of mine owne wants; when loe, receiuing some inckling of your Honours fauour towards me, I aduentured to cōsecrate this poore Dis∣course to your name, as desirous to congratulate with the rest of the Sonnes of the Prophets, this iust amplification of your deserued honour. And so the boldnesse of Loue, and Duty, hath sent out this meane, and slender Tractate, to one of the most Accu∣rate Iudgments, and Heroical Spirits vnder Hea∣uen.
With my daily prayers for the continuance, and encrease of true blessings to your Honour, I humbly take leaue.
