MADAME,
THis Fancy bearing in the Front the
name of a Rare Female, I thought
it might well stand with the rules
of Congruity to make the Dedication
correspond with the Title; And
after many revolutions of Thoughts
who shold be most proper for my
designe, the contemplation of your Honor did cast such
strong influences upon Them, that at last They fixed
there; Nor will any Discerning Reder question my
judgment herein, your Ladiship being so able and fit
(as I have the honour to know by experience) to re∣ceive
this Admired Queen, and give her a suitable en∣tertainment;
Therfore, Madame, if you please to ad∣mit
Morphandra into your Closet, I believe she will
afford you severall sorts of divertisements, And she
haply may work somtimes a Metamorphosis in your
Self, for she can transmute Passions as well as Persons,
she can turn Melancholy to Mirth, and Pensivenes to
Plesure; For as it is in the French (of which Language
you are so great a Mistresse) Les Morts font revivre les
Vivants, The Dead enliven the Living, wherby is
meant; that Books, though the Authors therof be dead

and rotten many Ages before, can beget new spirits
in the living Reder.
Now, such is the state of Mankind, that the foresaid
Passions will have their interchangable turns, they will
follow one another as duly as Night succeeds Day in
any Human Creture, be the Humors therof never so
equally poiz'd; It is denied to Man to be always at
Home within himself, and it will be so to the world's
end as long as He is compos'd of the four Elements,
and as long as the Naturall humors within Him sym∣pathize
with the said Elements, who are in restles mu∣tation
and motion among themselfs for mastery,
which made one break out into this excesse of speech,
that if the four Humors were ballanc'd aright in the
human body, he wold live easily many thousands of
years upon earth; Now, that person may be said to be
the wisest among mortalls who can rule and controul
those Humors, It being a Principle among the Philo∣sophers,
That as the conduct of the Passions (which arise
from the Humors) is the greatest prudence, so the conquest
of them is the gretest prosse, when they grow re∣bellius:
The ensuing Work hath divers glances up∣on
this subject, and variety of things besides, for eve∣ry
Section affords a new Fancy and Matter.
It remains now, Madame, that I shold humbly de∣sire,
your Honor would please to interpret this Dedi∣tory
Addresse as a small argument of my great Ac∣knowledgment
of your so many noble Civilities, for
which I stand so truly oblig'd; And this Acknow∣ledgment
standing upon so public a Record, the Ages
to come as well as the present will testifie, how much I
am and was,
My highly Honored Lady,
