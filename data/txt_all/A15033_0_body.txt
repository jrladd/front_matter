which are the fountaines of goodnes, from whence princes and heroycal states may receiue perfect wisedome, and the whole world besid moral instruction: to conclude, your Maiesty (as Gods ener) being setled in Salomons throne, crowned with the conquest of Enuy, the queller of Alexan∣der, Caesar, & most of the worthies: plentifully distributing deuine and earthly blessings, vppon afflicted kingdomes, against whom all traiterous practises are of the nature of the horse called Seian, whose maisters had euermore miserable ends. Most gratious Lady, admyring these great considerati∣ons, I fearefully haue armed this profitable booke, with the sheilde of your Royall protection, from whom the glory & goodnes therof is deriued. The censures of graue men which are the substance of this work, stand in place of counsels for your good subiects, and vnto me as loyall as the truest, the bare labor is onely dew. In which trembling presumption, I protest before God and your Maiestie, that my heart nor booke medleth with matter of your happie gouernment, to which no earthly pollicie may be added, neither is heauen∣ly wisdome absent: And as far is it from my thought, in name figure, or circumstance, to misnote any capitall Maiestrate, whose honorable trauels deserue much reuerence, and no lesse regard: It then followeth, most regarded Queene, that the reach of my duetie, which climeth betweene fire and frost, (the premises allowed) simply laboreth to publish these regards, that common faults may be amended in imitation of your pretious vertues, the lights of the world, and life of Englands happines.
God graunt my paines a profitable successe, to which good god I zealously pray, that long may your maiesty liue, that still may your enimies fal, and those that louingly feare you, no doubt shall euer finde you a good gratious Lady.
