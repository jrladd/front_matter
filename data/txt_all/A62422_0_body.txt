Madam,
SO many already have assum'd it as a priviledge, that it is now become a current custome to prefix a Dedication to some one, whose Judgement and ingenuity may both grace the ambitious Au∣thour, and protect his weakness, otherwise you had escap'd the trou∣ble of being Guardian to this Brat, whose Parent was unable to maintain it. To be plain; I have cast it at your Door, neither better nor worse to expect its fate: yet with some confidence of a fa∣vourable reception, since your Generosity and Nobleness were ever wont to correspond with Charity: whereof my self am sufficiently sen∣sible. I beg your pardon for this offence, but cannot promise to do so no more. However I submit to your worthy self, whose intimate goodness and serenity have hitherto so far obleiged me, that I must ever (as most due) subscribe myself (as really I am)
Madam.
