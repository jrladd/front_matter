Learned Sir,
GRatitude it self does not only oblige me to make a Thankful Acknow∣ledgment of Your Favours, but at the same time, makes the Obligations greater, since the Opportunity of owning Favours re∣ceiv'd from Eminent Men, makes an Ad∣dition to them.

And if Gratitude be such a Virtue as carries along with it it's own Reward, and also a future Obligation, it is the greater Satisfaction to Me, that whilst I own your former Favours, I lay a Foundation for a second Acknowledgment; But more, that it gives me the Opportunity of solliciting Your Patronage, which you are so free to give to any thing that may promote Na∣tural Knowledge: The Noble-Design of that Royal Society, in which, Your Station makes you an Useful, but Your Qualifica∣tions a more Serviceable Member.
And as our continual Contributions to the Philosophical Transactions, for which the World is oblig'd to that Learn'd and Royal Society, and in Great Measure to You, makes them the more Valuable; so Your Readiness to encourage my weak Endeavours hath given me sufficient Reason to acknowledge my self,
Learned Sir.
