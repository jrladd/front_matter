MADAM,
THe French Vallet, according to his natu∣ral
Insolence, throws himself at your
feet; not in his broken English, with a
Begar Madam, mee voul ave it de so,
but in that Dialect used by the most refin'd Wits,
—Vous supplye tres humblement
Le regarder d'un aspect favorable.
Which blessing he vows is a sufficient saveguard
against those three Fatalities of Books; Envy, Spight,
and Malice. I know, Madam, that to have shrow∣ded
under your generous protection all that the grea∣test
Gallantry of the two most Polite Nations of
the world could have wound up to the highest sublimi∣ty
of Wit, had worn some face of Justice, which
might have rendred the presumption excusable; it be∣ing
so generally known, that none with more reason

than your self, could undertake the Censure of what
is so much your own; I mean La parfaite cognois∣sance
du beau Monde. But Champagne's Crime
can plead no excuse; and being beyond the reach of
rdinary Clemencie, can have no other hopes, than in
hat goodness which shines with so much Lustre
hroughout all your actions. Take pitty of him,
Madam; and while your hand is in, pardon also the
iberty which his Advocate takes, of subscribing him∣self,
Madam,
