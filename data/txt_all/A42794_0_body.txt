May it please your Grace,
THAT the Vertues of Great Persons are some∣times
dangerous to themselves, is too manifest
in the Liberty I have taken to prefer the fol∣lowing
History to your Graces Patronage, your
own Affability, and Bounty having procur'd
you that Inconvenience, and Encourag'd me
to a Dedication; I should not otherwise, and at a greater distance
of Favour, have presum'd to impose upon your Protection: a
Truth I have not only thought fit to put your Grace in mind of,
the better to excuse my Presumption; but have moreover been
prompted thereunto by an honest Vanity I have, the World
should take notice, that how private soever my Life has been,
I have not altogether convers'd with Obscurity: but that I have
had the Honour to be sometime known unto, and to have been
Favour'd by one of the greatest Prelates, and the best Men upon
Earth.
Thus (my Lord) by my own ill govern'd, though otherwise
not very Criminal Ambition, I am put upon a necessity of
seeming to accuse that Vertue, I have so just reason to mag∣nifie;
and from whence I have deriv'd so many advantages, to
colour a boldness, that would otherwise admit of no Excuse.
Neither will this I fear serve me against the Censures of the
Time, by whom I expect notwithstanding to be accus'd of an∣other
sort of Vanity, that something of mine may be worthy
your Graces Acceptation; which if I should absolutely deny,
the Dedication it self would then convince me of a premedita∣ted
injury to your Name. I cannot therefore avoid confessing

I think this History so fine a thing in it self, that if I be not
the worst Translator that ever Writ (and there is no Triumph
due to the best) it may very well endure the light, and pass
amongst good natur'd men, with other things, that every
day sally from the Press; which is my true opinion of it, and
nothing more.
A more Illustrious Image of Vertue, and Honour than is
here represented in the Person of the Duke of Espernon, in my
little Reading I have no where met with, a more exemplary
Piety, a braver Courage, a more shining and unblemish'd
Loyalty, more inviolate Friendships, nor a nobler Constancy in
all the shocks of Fortune; so that I have sometimes thought,
had there not been a little mixture of Humane Frailty amongst
so many excellent Qualities as he was Master of to a very great
perfection, the Story would have look'd like an Idea of an Hero
only, and rather a Character of what a Brave man should be,
than what any man ever truly was. There are indeed some
Passages in his History, that are not altogether to be justified,
though none that may not (methinks) be slipt over amongst so
many better Pages of his Life, like a Counterfeit Piece in a great
Summe of Current Gold.
If (my Lord) I have been so successful as to make a tolerable
Copy of this brave Original, and that my endeavour be graci∣ously
accepted, I have my end. I have learn'd that the Best men
are not always the hardest to please, and ever the aptest to for∣give;
which being granted, I shall appear in a good measure ju∣stified
in the great freedom I have taken to recommend my Book
to your Graces perusal: and it has so much the better Title to
your Acceptance, as it is the Fruit of the most innocent part of
my time; and offer'd with a Heart as grateful for the many Fa∣vours
I have receiv'd from your Graces Bounty, and as full of
Honour and Reverence for your Person, and Dignity as any
Man, who in a better, and more studied stile may take the bold∣ness
to subscribe himself,
My Lord,

Beresford, this 30th.
of October, 1669.
