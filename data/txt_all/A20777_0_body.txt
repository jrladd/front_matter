RIght worshipfull, and my louing
Brother, I haue heard it often &
truelie reported; That, Lawes
maie be broken, but Nature can∣not
be forgotten. I finde the force
of this in my selfe: if I finde not
the like in you, I blame not your
nature, but the contrarie crossings of those politique af∣fections
that hinder the working of it. VVhen I had en∣ded
this present Pamphlet, I saw that the simplicitie of
it required a Patron; & the often remembrance of your
former curtesies inforced me to make bolde with you.
Consider not therefore the worthinesse of the worke, but
rather the will of the worker: for though the one maie
iustlie be condemned, yet the other deserues to be accep∣ted.
This Booke which proceedes vnder your prote∣ction,
if you consider the matter, I assure you it is most
excellent and well worth the reading: but if you weigh
the manner, I confesse it is base & scarce worth the see∣ing.
This is therefore my desire; that the simple attire of
this outward forme, maie not discourage you from seek∣ing
the cōfortable tast of the inward substance. You shall

find here manie things for comfort worthie the conside∣ring,
and for policie the obseruing. This hath beene
my ordinarie exercise for recreation at times of leasure
for a long space togeather: If I were sure that you
would but take halfe so much pleasure in reading it, as
I haue in collecting and disposing it: I should not neede
anie farther to commend it. If you finde anie thing that
fits not your liking, remember I pray, that it is a wo∣mans
doing. The thing it selfe will sufficientlie prooue
this to be true. Thus committing the patronage of this
my recreation vnto your protection, and you withmy
good sister in law your wife, & all your children to the
Lords tuition, I cease to troble you: Honiton, the 25.
day of Iulie. 1589.
