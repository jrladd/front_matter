Madam,
THe Inexpressible Favours I've Receiv'd of your Noble Family, and particular∣ly

of yourself, ever since I had the Undeserved Honour of being employ'd in serving them, hath encourag'd me to Prefix your Ladyship's name to this small Treatise; which con∣tains a description of all the Dis∣eases belonging to Child-bear∣ing Women. I should not have adventur'd to disturb your ease by such a solemn ad∣dress, or amuse the World with any Publick Appearance upon this Subject; had I not been forc'd into it by the Lamenta∣ble Condition of Poor Wo∣men, that perish daily, toge∣ther with their Children, mere∣ly

through the ignorance and negligence of those, whose hands they are entrusted to. 'Twas only the just sense of the misery and distress of Women, that rais'd at once both my Compassion and In∣dignation, and oblig'd me to transgress all my wonted mea∣sures of silence and retirement. The Censorious and Ungrate∣ful temper of the Age we now live in, is enough to scare any Man that only minds his In∣terest, from appearing on the Publick Stage; but the respect and pity I owe to the fair Sex; surmounted all the Objections

of Policy and Interest, and would not suffer me any longer to conceal, what knowledge of these things my twenty years Diligent and Laborious Experience has afforded me; what method Persons con∣cern'd in such Cases ought to observe; And what are the most approved Remedies, that by the Blessing of God I have seen most effectual and success∣ful in relieving Poor Women. I hope, what I have deliver'd in these few sheets, if seriously consider'd, may prove a check to the Headstrong, and a Guide to those that are doubt∣ful.

Especially when usher'd into the World, under the sha∣dow of your Ladyship's Illu∣strious Name; which will doubtless recommend it to the perusal of a great many, and screen me from the Slanders and Calumnies of Envious Detracters.
Upon this Account was I so ambitious of obtaining your Ladyship's Patronage, consi∣dering how Illustrious a Fa∣mily ye're sprung of, how much ye retain, nay, add to the Honour of your Noble Ancestors, what a large share of Vertue and Engaging

Goodness ye possess, while Beauty Guards you on the Right, and Piety on your Left; How much of Civility and Charity to strangers, Con∣descension to your Inferiours, and evenness and constancy of temper, ye discover in all your Actions; that I think truly I may apply without flattery that saying of Solomon, Many Women have done Vertuously, but she hath excell'd them all.
That surpassing wisdom that shin'd so brightly in all the Conduct of your Life; that excellency and sweetness of temper, that never could

be disturb'd by the highest Provocations imaginable; but still kept its even steddy course, Notwithstanding all the shocks and rubbs of un∣lucky accidents; That Emi∣nent Piety and Goodness that sweetens the bitterness of af∣fliction, and loudly pro∣claims how justly ye are En∣titled to the Favour of Hea∣ven; That distinguishing Or∣der and Regularity in your Noble Family, that plainly discovers the Wisdom and Discretion of its worthy Go∣verness; These (I say) are all fit Topicks for a Panegyrist to insist upon.
But I forbear to pay even the due tribute of your Praise, for fear I should offend your Modesty; and shall on∣ly beg leave to joyn with the Multitude of your admirers in praying, that God would bless and prosper you and every Branch of your No∣ble Family. May ye be Crown'd with all the Bles∣sings of this lower World, as an earnest of that Immortal weight of Glory that awaits you in the World to come. And when ye bid adieu to the lovely Tabernacle of Clay, may your Tomb▪ be Clad

and Beautified with higher Glory and Fame, than e'er the Chast Lucretia's was. Which is the Hearty Prayer of,
