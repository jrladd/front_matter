Madam,
KNowing Mrs. Behn in her Life-time design'd to Dedicate some of of her Works to you, you hae a Naturall Title, and claim to this and I could not wihout being unjust to her Memory, but fix your name to it, who hae not only a Wit above that, of most of your Sex; but a good∣ness and Affability Extreamly Charming, and Engaging beyond Measure, and perhaps there are few to be found like you, that are so Eminent for Hospitallity, and a Ready and Generous Assistance to the distress'd and In∣digent, which are Quallities that carry much more of Divinity with them, then a Puritanicall outward Zeal for Virtue and Religion.
Our Author, Madam, who was so true a Judge of Wit, was (no doubt of it) satisfyed in the Patroness she had pitcht upon: If ever she had oc∣casion for a Wit and Sense like yours 'tis now, to Defend this (one of the last of her Works) from the Malice of her Enemies, and the ill Nature of the Critticks, who have had Ingratitude enough not to Consider the O∣bligations they had to her when Living; but to do those Gentlemen Justice, 'tis not (altogether) to be Imputed to their Critticism, that the Play had not that Success which it deserv'd, and was expected by her Friends; The main fault ought to lye on those who had the management of it. Had our Authour been alive she would have Committed it to the Flames rather than have suffer'd it to have been Acted with such Omissions as was made, and on which the Foundation of the Play Depended: For Example, they thought fit to leave out a Whole Scene of the Virginian Court of Judicature, which was a lively resemblance of that Country-Justice; and on which de∣pended a great part of the Plot, and wherein were many unusuall and very Naturall Jsts which would at least have made some sort of People laugh: In another Part of the Play is Omitted the appearance of the Ghost of the Indian King, Kill'd by Bacon, and tho' the like may have been Represen∣ted in other Plays, yet I never heard or found but that the sight was very agreeable to an Audience, and very Awfull: besi des the Apparition of the Ghost was necessary, for it was that which struck a Terror

in the Queen, and fright'ned her from heark'ning to the Love of Bacon, be∣lieving it a horrid thing to receive the Caresses and Embraces of her Hus∣bands Murderer: And Lastly, many of the Parts being false Cast, and given to those whose Tallants and Genius's suited not our Authors Intenti∣on: These, Madam, are some of the Reasons that this Play was unsuccess∣full, and the best Play that ever was writ must prove so: if it have the Fate to be Murder'd like this.
However, Madam, I can't but believe you will find an hours diversion in the reading, and will meet with not only Wit, but true Comedy, (tho' low,) by reason many of the Characters are such only as our Newgate afforded, being Criminals Transported.
This Play, Madam, being left in my hands by the Author to Intro∣duce to the Publick, I thought my self oblig'd to say thus much in its de∣fence, and that it was also a Duty upon me to choose  Patroness proper for it, and the Author having pitcht upon your name to do Honour to some of her Works, I thought your Protection, could be so usefull to none, as to this, whose owning it may Silence the Malice of its Enemies; Your Wit and Judgment being to be Submitted to in all Cases; Besides your Natu∣ral Tenderness and Compassion for the Unfortunate, gives you in a man∣ner another Title to it: The preference which is due to you upon so many Accounts is therefore the Reason of this present Address, for at the worst, if this Play should be so Unfortunate as not to be thought worthy of your Acceptance; Yet it is certain, that its worth any Man's while to have the Honour of subscribing himself,
Madam,
