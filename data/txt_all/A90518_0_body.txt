SIR,
BOth the Foreign and Domestick Prints making such a noise and rattle with the vast Pre∣parations of France by Sea and Land, without taking equal notice of the much greater of the Allies, who will be too strong and too early for the French, I have adventur'd to give you my Sentiments upon a Method (in my Opinion) the most rational to reduce France to an absolute and speedy Necessity of making, or rather
taking a Peace from the Allies; and knowing your Merit and Judgment, and the Figure you make in this Kingdom, and particularly in the Great Council of which you are an Honorable Member: And being bound in gratitude to make you some return for the great Favours receiv'd at your band, I have resolv'd to this way, and beg your kind but not severe Cen∣sure; and hope you'll accept my Zeal to the Publick, and Respect to your self, and Pardon
