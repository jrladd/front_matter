TO enforce Sir vnto your worthy∣nes herein, by many circustaunces how much led on with the BOVN∣TIE, VALOR, COVRTESIE, SKIL, and many other complements of VIRTVE, resiant in your wel noted and known disposition, I haue da∣red to aduenture vnto your fauou∣rable acceptaunce, this simple and plaine dedication (simple I meane in respect of the handling) might seem in the deliuerie, to equall an other volume.
Omitting therefore all those particularities to them that know you, and to mine owne priuate meditation, that especially do honour you, I will onely say for this, that the greatest forwardnes craueth a shrowd, and the meanest matter cannot be without defence.
TO VIRGIL there was an AVGVSTVS, to HORACE a MECAENAS, to CICERO a CAESAR, to APPELLES an ALEXANDER. If to these? how much more then to me needeth there, to couer the deformitie of my stile, a most exquisite PATRON.
In a matter simple, it is yet a grace, but to insinuate

the name of such as do merite well, the verie respect of whome, in the generallitie of the most, beareth alwaies we see, a more than common reputation,
Herein if I presume on your VIRTVES, I vrge the necessity, if to craue your patronage, then custome may free me.
Nowe, if the course of the weeke-daies pastimes of these SHEPEHEARDS seeme happelie to mislike you, turn then I pray to their HOLIDAIE, where (how rude∣lie so euer handled) yet the Maiesty of her, who is with∣out comparison, being there in most especially honou∣red, shunneth not the fauour of anie sweete conceipte to haue the same recommended.
Fruitles were it on a short request, to erect large mat∣ter. For which my sute shalbe, that with the selfe BOVN∣TIE, wherewith your present yeares are so largely beau∣tified, your VIRTVE will vouchsafe fauourablie to re∣pute both of me and my trauel, which hauing obteined the shrowd thereof as AIAX shield, shall become vnto me henceforth of a sufficient gard from all kinde of bi∣ting serpents whatsoeuer.
