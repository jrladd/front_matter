IF there bee a blame in mee (most Noble Lord) to offer to your vertues this poore offer∣tory of my labours, I must with renowned Sir Phillip Sydney make answere, that is is a fault then in you to be vertuous, for did not your ver∣tue and Honorable inclination (which euen vp∣holdeth and strengtheneth this Art which I pro∣fesse) moue me with the violence of an inrepressable desire to become your obscure seruaunt, doubtlesse I had both conceald your Name & this Worke: but since it is so, that I am nowe within the mercie of your more noble Spirit, euen for Uertues sake, and that delight which you conceiue in the height of your pleasures, let my dutious loue bee mine excuse, and imagine that if I had inioyed better abilitie to haue exprest a better seruice, it had ere now beene tendred to your Honor, with more then a hartie sincerenes. As it is, I know your noble na∣ture will hold it, & though I am not able to doe you profitable seruice, yet I will not cease to adde to your Name my prayers and best wishes, which is as much as Greatnes can expect from a low fortune.
