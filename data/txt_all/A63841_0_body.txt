My LORD,
SInce the true Reasons of Punishments inflicted up∣on such private and obscure Persons, as my self, are many times not rightly understood by some, and misrepresented by others, and thereby leave a Stain behind them, and that this I found was my Case, at the time of my Suspension; I thought I should be want∣ing to my self, if at this Juncture, (when, God be thank'd, an honest Zeal against Popery is no longer Criminal) I did not publish that Sermon, which brought the Rage of the Papists, and a Suspension upon me. My Lord, 'tis not from any Opinion I have of the Per∣formance it self, that I now make it publick; for I am too well acquainted with the excellent Tracts which the Divines of our Church have publish'd, as upon others, so likewise upon this Argument, since the time of my preaching this Sermon, to entertain any such foolish con∣ceit of it; Nor shall I here take occasion to reflect upon that venerable Body, the Dean and Chapter of York,
 who were pleas'd, immediately upon the receit of a Let∣ter from the King, to Suspend me there for this Dis∣course preach'd before the University of Oxford; and that without as much as the least Summons, Cita∣tion, or ordinary Civility of a private Letter to ac∣quaint me with their Summary proceedings against me, tho 'twas visible enough, that as the management of their Censure was unpresidented, and then a leading Case; so had it not been without fatal Effects upon the Clergy, had not your Lordship, in a most generous and heroick Manner, put a stop to it here in the very same Case of the Reverend the Dean of Norwich. My Lord, as I had the Honour (for such even then I esteem'd it) to be the first Clergy-Man in England who suffer'd in those days in the Defence of our Religion against Popish Superstition and Idolatry; So I humbly beg, that your Lordship's being shortly after made the greatest and most eminent Instance of Suffering in the same excellent Cause, may excuse the Presumption of this Dedication, in
My LORD,
