I Commend unto you this plain Relation of the first Discovery of the Popish plotted Conspiracy for subverting the Government and Religion, and Massacring the People of the Kingdom of England, and other his Majesties Dominions, and the assassinating his Royal Person: as I drew it up (for my own satisfaction) out of several pieces at several times; and of the first Discove∣rers thereof; according to the notices I have been able to procure of them, and so far as they are willing to be known.
You will be pleased to excuse the rudeness and imperfection thereof: it is one part of a large rough draught of the general Narrative which I have in hand, and wherein I propose to my self to omit no∣thing that I conceive may by your Wisdom and diligence improved, conduce to the clearing the simpli∣city, sincerity, integrity, ingenuity, candor or truth of the Witnesses produced, or to be produced in this af∣fair, or for the discovery of any matter of fact or circumstance that may tend to the disclosing of this Conspiracy, or any, the Conspirators therein, or any further evidence against them, or refuting the Scandals, Lyes, Aequivocations, Forgeries, Briberies, Subornations and Perjuries, wherewith they so mightily impose upon Multitudes of People, darken the clearest Evidences, and contradict most mani∣festly the truest Narratives.
I know some minute Circumstances and passages, and such as relate to some accidental occurrences by which these things were brought to Light (which I have purposely inserted to refute some studied Ca∣vils, representing them as politick contrivances) are lyable to exceptions, and sinister interpretations of some concerned persons, but those who are candid, will find therein cause to give God all the Glory: Who by the accidental Circumstances of undesigned, uncontrived events discovers, disciphers, dis∣plays suddenly the long projected, most craftily contrived, deeply hid, and vigorously prosecuted un∣just machinations of wicked Politicians and Conspirators against his secret purposes. By these▪ next to nothing, and many times meerly imaginary appearances, jealousies and panick fears, he rejoyceth to expose to contempt, and render altogether ridiculous and ineffectual what in all humane appearance was wisely designed and strongly built; and as he first made all things out of, so he often shakes Heaven and Earth with things that do not appear; whilst he chuseth not the mighty and wise of the World to confound such as themselves, and frequently catcheth most subtle Machiavellian Politicians in the crafty Snares they have laid, and the deadly Pits they have digg'd for others, &c. Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy Name be the Praise. So let all thy Enimies Perish, O God. Amen.
The Right Reverend Father in God, Herbert, Lord Bishop of Hereford, had long since some notice of this Plot, either from the Information or Depositions of Mr. Robert Woodhouse, Richard Green, and several others (made about Whitsuntide 1676. at Hereford, before Sir James Bridges (now Lord Shandoes) and other Justices of the Peace of the County of Hereford, by Order of his Majesty, upon a report spread in those parts of change of Government and insurrections of Papists: which Examinati∣ons and Depositions were by the said Justices sent up to his Majestie, and Captain Thomas Bowyer was committen to Prison upon them) or else from other persons, or by other means, as his words follow∣ing will shew, taken out of his Epistle prefixed to his Legacy, Printed Anno Domini 1678, and De∣dicated or directed to his Diocess.
IT is now a year and half since (viz. in the year 1676.) I told you of my sad apprehensions of Po∣pish Design, to destroy both us and our Religion, for though no particular discovery could then be made, yet the discourse and actings of several Papists in these parts did plainly shew they were then preparing that which is now discover'd, for they were then providing Horses and Arms, they po∣sted about Day and Night, they threatned many, That they must ere long Turn or Burn; and some told their Friends, That if it came to Cutting of Throats, they should be saved; which made it evident, that not only they had some bloody design, but also thought themselves sure to effect it: Where∣upon I besought you to Arm your selves against the day of Tryal: and Preached a Sermon to that effect. And not knowing what kind of Pastor you might have after my Death, whether a Protestant Pastor not well verst in such matters, or a Popish Pastor wholly Devoted to them; I resolved at my De∣cease, to leave you these Sermons as a Legacy, &c.
