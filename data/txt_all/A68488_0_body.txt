IT vvere a mightie
iniury (in my poore
opinion) that you,
being the main O∣cean,
feeding all
the riuolets of this
painfull employment, and directing the
course of any current that way tending:
should not receiue the iust retribution
and dutie, which (by instinct of nature)
all Riuers else send duly to their nursing

Mother the Sea. Therefore Gentle∣men,
J doe but send you that, which in
right and equity belongs vnto you, the
Patronage and protection of this Or∣phan
childe, begotten in your seruice,
bredde vp hitherto by your fauour and
kinde cherishing, and not despayring
now to dye, through your want of re∣gard.
Jt is your owne, welcome it in
loue and acceptance, and J haue as
much as I desire, and will studie hereaf∣ter
to deserue.
