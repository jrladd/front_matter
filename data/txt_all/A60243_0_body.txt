Sirs,
I Hope you will pardon my boldness, because I presume to appear before your faces. It is requisite I should give an account of my hope in Christ unto you, who are (next to the most Illustrious King Charles the II. De∣fender of the Faith) the surest Maintainers of the Protestant Religion. And unto whom else should I dedicate a Treatise of the True Church, if not to the Parliament, where as well the Commonwealth is to be found in the Church, as the Church in the Commonwealth? Namely, There is a new resemblance in your Houses, of the old face of Israel (which ma∣keth
me the bolder) as the countenance of Law∣givers (like that of Moses) doth in its lustre go far beyond the rest. Nature and Religion have made you of that constitution, that you do not only shine for your selves, but also spread out your beams for the benefit of others. Sirs, Be pleas'd to accept of this small token of my due submission, and to look upon him with an eye of benevolence, who desiring to depend upon your Sanhedrim, will always remain, Sirs,
