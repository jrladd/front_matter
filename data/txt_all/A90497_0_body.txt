My very Esteemed Christian Friends,
AS I have taken the Full Freedom of changing, and making Additions to the Sermon committed to my Revi∣sal at your Desire, and with the Consent of Mr. Perkins; So I do in his Name, and I doubt not, with his Desire, as well as my own, give it into your Hand, as Persons so nearly concern'd in, and related to Her; who was the mournful, and also the to be rejoiced in, occasion of it; as the Testimony of my Re∣membrance of Her, and of all the Kindness re∣ceived from You, when with You in the occasional Ministration of the Gospel at Col∣chester. As God hath made you, I am much perswaded, Instruments of Good, where He hath placed You; so that He would bless You, and Your growing up Family, and san∣ctifie to You both, and make Consolatory this Discourse, and increase You in all Grace and Service to Him, is the Earnest Prayer of; My Esteemed Friends in the Lord,
