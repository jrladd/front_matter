IT was no parte of my mea∣ning (right Woorshipfull) to haue communicated to any that which I spake by waie of exhortation and encou∣ragement to the Souldiers that shewed themselues be∣fore you the 2. and 3. of Ianuary. Notwithstan∣ding, I could not resist the daily importunitie of my friends, desiring to bee partakers of such matter as the Lord of his mercie did at that so∣daine minister vnto mee for the comfort of thé which heard. Wherefore giuing my selfe to re∣member what I had spoken, I deliuered them in writing so much as I could call to mind againe; which they finding meanes (I knowe not how) to bring vnto the print and certifying me ther∣of, that duetie, which for your goodne to me warde I owe vnto your woorship, caused me to present it vnto you; and so much the rather be∣cause you were the onely man; which when the
Souldiers were readiero come before you, ad∣monished mee to employ my speache to such ende and purpose. Wherefore I beseech your worship to accept of this my small present, be∣ing a testimonie rather of my well meaning, than a reward of your benefites. The Lord en∣crease in you and yours his spiritual graces, and preserue you by faith working through loue vnto the king∣dome of his sonne.
