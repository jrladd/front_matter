Worthy Sirs,
THE particular respects I have for each of You personally (as well as my due regard to those unani∣mous desires, by which I was summon'd to Your Service) enti∣tle You solely to the following
Sermon, which was preach'd at Your joint instance, and is now publish'd for Your satisfaction. Promoting Charity and mutual Society is a Design beyond ex∣ception, and the proper Expedi∣ent to heal and compose our pre∣sent Animosities and Divisions.
That your Generous Endea∣vours may be successful, and the commendable Example, You have given, effectually followed, is the constant desire and daily prayer of
GENTLEMEN,
