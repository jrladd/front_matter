My Lord,
WHEN such Assurance of the Fidelity of the Subjects to their Princes, as is a principal part of the Constitu∣tion of our Monarchy, is, by the Gentleman whom I oppose, censured as new, needless, mischievous, and impossible to be maintained; and for this an Appeal is made to the supposed sense of the Representatives of the Commons of England; equal Judges will think it but requisite for one, from whom the greatest Authori∣ties have been, and are likely to be received, with Prejudice; to fly to the Protection of a Person, who, under their Majesties, is at the Head of our Laws: Not for false and servile Glosses upon them, or a treacherous giving them up; but for restoring, explaining, and adorning them.
Were it in my Nature to flatter, I am sure here the Subject would free me from the Imputation; as my Incapacity to write upon it what I ought, may plead in excuse of my offering at so little.
This I may say, that since your Lordship is well known, not to have served their Majesties by halves, as if they had a Naked Possession of the Throne without Right; no one Man's Disability by an Oath of Abjuration, can be lamented as a publick Loss: Nor can any Example be more perswasive than your Lordships; whose

Judgment, and Integrity, no body is so singular as to call in question.
Possibly many, who would incline to think nothing of mine worth reading, may have the Curiosity to see, what it is that encourages my Presumption in this Dedication; and the Hopes, that your Lord∣ship, who have so few Moments which are not taken up with the Affairs of the Publick, and doing good to Mankind; should spare some time to look into what its Author must be suppos'd, to judge not unfit for your Lordship's View, and favourable Reception.
And▪ indeed, my Lord! those Memorials of pass'd times which I here publish, and others which I refer to, have so long lain bu∣ried, and unobserved; and are of so great consequence for vindica∣ting the Right of the present Government, from those Reproaches, which its Enemies pretend to found upon the Nature of the En∣glish Monarchy; that I cannot but think, these Collections may be allowed the Honour of having a Patron, whose Approbation would effectually recommend them to the World.
If your Lordship shall think well of what I here tender, in Proof, that the Right of their present Majesties ought to be uni∣versally acknowledged, and sworn to, if required by Act of Parli∣ament; it will be a mighty Encouragement for me to publish at large those Evidences, from the earliest times of this Monarchy downward, manifesting their Right to be according to its Funda∣mental Constitution. Which Province, tho many are more fit for it, has been assumed, and labour'd in, by
(My Lord)
