Right Honourable Lord:
SInce your Lo. Ver∣tues are such, as they haue a Title to all mens labours, both by your honourable ap∣ceptation and fauour, as your value, and iudgement of them: It is an honest ambition of my humbleness 

to adde something to the heape is dayly offered to your altar, with pro∣testation, that nothing is brought thither with sincerer hands then this small gift of mine owne collecti∣ons in Spaine: which if they retayne but a good odour in your receiuing, and that your Honour will take the minde wherewith they are done, it will be a grace, that shall euer ena∣ble my industry, to the study of ser∣uing and honouring your Lordship, in the name of your Lordship
