DEare Brethren and Sisters, as my compassions to some bleeding hearts among you, did put me upon this discourse, in our more pri∣vate weekly meeting; so their unexpe∣cted importunitie, for Copies, have ne∣cessitated me to print it, so as it was, sud∣dainly compiled, and ruggedly delive∣red, unpolished, and untrimmed for pub∣like view of all abroad. But being wil∣ling you should have it, I would rather deny mine own honour, then you of any spirituall comfort I might hold forth to you, who am yours in the Lord by many strong obligations.

From my study in Mary Staynings.
Decem. 2. 1646.
