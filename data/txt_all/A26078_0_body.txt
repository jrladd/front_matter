May it please Your Grace,
HAving formerly Pub∣lished, A Plain Me∣thod of Daily De∣votions and Devotions for the Lord's-Day, for the use of a
 Countrey-Parish; as a further instance of my Duty, in instruct∣ing Those committed to my charge, I thought it might be useful, in the same familiar manner, to give some Direction and Assistance to Sick and Dying Persons. And though some able Pens have lately engaged in that Subject (and consequently less need of any Composure of mine) yet the Providence of God having Pla∣ced me amongst a Plain work∣ing People, who do not much converse with Books, some short Manual of my own, when put into their bands, would be ac∣cepted and perused, and through God's Blessing might make im∣pression upon them. Accordingly I have designed (humbly implo∣ring
 the Divine Assistance) to publish A Plain Method of Devotion for Sick and Dying Persons; that when the extremity of Age, the Weakness and De∣cays of Nature, or the Vio∣lence of a Disease do admonish them of their approaching Dis∣solution, they may then be in∣structed what to do; how to behave themselves both to God and Man; in what manner, and with what Circumstances, they may think of leaving this World, before they enter into the next. Now according to the Order of the Church of England (whose Directions I desire always to follow) the Minister, who Visits Sick and Dying Persons, doth admonish them (if they have
 not doue it before) to Settle their Temporal Estates, and make their Wills. Accordingly I found it necessary, as an In∣troduction to my intended Devo∣tions, to Premise some plain and brief Directions in that mat∣ter. This I conjectured, would have been dispatch'd in a few Pages. But my Thoughts be∣ing enlarged beyond my first ex∣pectation, I now observe I was much mistaken.
Having given this faithful Account of the Occasion of this following Treatise, I most hum∣bly crave leave to publish it to the World under Your Grace's Patronage; as a small but sin∣cere acknowledgment of those
 continued favours I have recei∣ved from Your Grace.
The God of Heaven multiply His Blessings upon Your Grace, Your Pious Dutchess, and Your Illustrious Family; Encrease and continue Your Prosperity here, and Crown You with His Glory hereafter. So Prayeth
