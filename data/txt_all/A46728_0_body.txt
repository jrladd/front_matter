Right Honourable!
HOw much I have resolv'd and endeavour'd to de∣cline such publick Ser∣vices as these, out of a real sense of my own unfitness for
them, those that are concerned in the disposal thereof can sufficiently bear me witness; for though I have some∣times appeared as publickly as I am like to do now; yet it hath been more out of Necessity than Choice; Nor do I see any Cause at present to change my Opinion; but yet, ha∣ving such a special Order for it, I find a great deal of Reason to alter my Resolution; and indeed I should as much depart from my own sence of the thing it self, should I not do it now, as I should have done to have ventured upon it without such an Obligation: For though in imitation of the Prophet's Faithfulness and Zeal for God and his Country, I thought it my Duty, as a Minister of the Gospel, and as a Native of this great City, whose welfare I have so much reason to be concerned for,
to preach the Sermon; yet I should never have offered to print it; that's your own Act and Deed, and not mine; and therefoe it would be pre∣sumption in me, and not modesty, to offer to excuse it. May it but do as much good in the Publication, as it was honestly intended in the Preach∣ing, and then we shall all of us have our Ends, and many others also have cause to give thanks to God, and to pray that he would give your Lord∣ships, in particular, a Name bet∣ter than that of Sons and Daughters, and make you, and all your Bre∣thren, as eminent for Goodness, as you are in Place and Dignity. That this Famous and Renowned City may be always as happy in its Ma∣gistrates, as it is already in its whole∣som Laws and Constitutions. For which, and all other Blessings upon
It and You, none shall more hearti∣ly pray, than,
Right Honourable; Your most obedient and humble Servant in Christ Jesus,

Septemb. 30. 1681.
