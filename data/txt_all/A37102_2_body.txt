I Here present you an History
which though now you may,
confident I am you very lately
could not in reason expect; such
was the perversnesse and crookedness of these
times, that no loyal subject might without
danger attempt to write, nay hardly to speak
the truth of his Soveraign: for a sort of men
there were, who having by violence usurped
his Dominions, thought that they had no surer
ground to maintain their unjust possession,
then by scandalizing his most SACRED
MAIESTY and deceiving of his Subjects,
many of whom had not but by such deceits
converted their loyalty into Treason.
Yet God I hope will now be pleased to re∣turn
them to their Allegiance, and give en∣couragement
to those who have constantly
continued loyal, that they may at length once
more enjoy happinesse, and every man sit un∣der
his own Vine and under his own fig-tree;
which, the GOD of HEAVEN be prai∣sed,
we have now greater hopes of then ever.

If I have in this History-offended any loy∣al
person, I am heartily grieved, I have im∣partially
endeavoured the truth, and if I be
found in the contrary, reason will easily con∣vince
me; and I shall be sorry that neither
my knowledge or intelligence extended to a
more narrow search.
I think I have represented his Majesty no
otherwise then any loyal person (for this
age requires that distinction) that hath ei∣ther
heard of or known him will confesse
him to be; but if they will not, let them be
convinced by that saying of a worthy Gen∣tleman
long time an attendant upon his Ma∣jesty,
who having given me a large account
of his virtues, at length concluded, That
Tully himself (if now alive) could not
sufficiently expresse his praise.
Gentlemen, it is to you in General
that I present this History, that you may
see, and be sensible, to whom you have been
loyal, and then I believe that you will
judge that your loyalty hath found it's just
reward in being loyal to so just a Prince: and
if any of you have suffered for him, read but
his sufferings, & you cannot value your own.
Yet I intend not this at all to his pretended

Tavern friends; which I believe (whilest
they are so) are so onely there, and indeed I
cannot look upon these as faithfull Subjects;
for how can that man be loyal to his Prince,
who hath not the power to be true unto him∣self.
Drunken subjects, though never so loyal,
will prove the ruine both of themselves and
their Soveraign.
Gentlemen, let those that are truly loyal
joyn their prayers with mine for the happi∣nesse
of his most SACRED MAIESTY
since in his we must necessarily include our
own, and more then ours, our COVNTRIES.
