I Could not choose but distinguish You thus, from all the rest of the People of these Nations, of what Condition or Qua∣lity soever, seeing God Himself hath first done it, having chosen you to Him∣self in Christ, and set you apart for Him∣self, as a Peculiar People, zealous of good works. And I have chosen to speak this only to You, because You are all taught of God, and have heard and learned from Him the Truth, as it is in Jesus: and because You have an inward Unction from God, whereby You know the Truth from Error, though it be never so much reproached by Carnal Christians; and whereby you know Er∣ror from the Truth, though it be never so much exalted and magnified by them. You are those Spiritual Men who judge All things, because you have received the Word and Spirit of Judgement in Christ, from the Father. Besides, You are the

Men, whom God will use in his Greatest and most Glorious Works, which he hath yet to do in the World, to wit, in the Destruction of the Kingdom of Antichrist, and in the Setting up, and inlarging the Kingdom of Christ; which Things, are not to be done by the Might and Power of worldly Magistrates, (which it may be you have not received, and if you had, it would not be helpful here) but by the Spirit of the Lord, which You all have received in some measure. Yea farther, none but You, will be contented to live only by Faith, and to follow Christ in Untrodden Paths, and to undertake impossible Works to flesh and blood; and none but You, will be willing to have the resi∣due of Christs Life and Works, and of his Sufferings and Death, fulfilled in your mortal bodies.
It grieves me much to see so Many Men as I have known once hopeful in the Army, and elsewhere, to be now so full gorged with the flesh of Kings, and Nobles, and Captains, and Migh∣ty Men, that is, with their Estates, Mannors, Houses, Parks, Lands, &c. that they can now be contented to take their ease, and to comply with the World and worldly Church, and the Teachers thereof, and can perswade themselves, that there is enough done for their time, after it hath fared thus well with them; and can leave the Remainder, to Men that are as plain and mean as Themselves were at first, forgetting Him who re∣membred Them, when they were in Low Condition. But they that were indeed Righteous among them, are Righteous still, and they that were indeed Holy, are Holy still; and Prosperity hath only slain the Fools, as the Scriptures speak. But You Christians, are Called, Chosen and Faithful, and You will still be found with the Lamb on mount Sion, and with the rest who have his Name, and his Fathers Name written in their Foreheads; and you dare still own the Ancient Truth, Cause and Work of Christ, how great disadvantage soever is for the present risen up against it, through the Apostasie of Carnal Christians, the Lovers of this World. And You all know, that all that hath been done hitherto by the Sword, is but the Preparation of Christs way to his Work, and that the Work it self is still be∣hind, and to be done, by those Worthies of the Lord, who love Jesus Christ and his Kingdom, and Coming, a thousand times

better then the present World, and all the best things of it, yea then their own Lives. Wherefore I advise You all, to whom now I speak, to take heed that you neither drink, nor sip of the Clergies Cup, which carries in it, the Wine of the wrath of the☜ fornication of Antichrist; lest having drunk thereof, you fall asleep through the strength of their Inchantments, and so are rendred unable to follow Christ any farther. For many Powers and Magistrates of the world, once hopeful, have been thus over∣come and seduced into Antichrists cause against Christ, to their utter ruine in the end. And how have the present Clergy, with their most Plausible Men, attempted some of this Present Pow∣er; yea some of the very Chiefest and most Godly in the Army; and have put them into some (that I say not) great Danger? Wherefore remember you that word of the Lord spoken by his Angel, Rev. 14. 9, & 10. If any man worship the Beast and his Image, and receive his Mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indigna∣tion, &c.
IF ANY MAN WORSHIP THE BEAST, that is, the Antichristian Church of the Pope and his Prelates and Cler∣gy, which is called the Beast, because of its Fierceness and Cruelty against the Saints: Or, HIS IMAGE, that is, the Church of the Bishops and Presbyters, which in a lesser Vo∣lume, and less Letters, doth answer the Other, and is directly like it. Whoever shall WORSHIP THESE, that is, highly esteem them for their Humane Learning, and School-Divinity, and Sacredness of their Orders, and count them worthy all Ho∣nour and Respect, and worldly Maintenance; and also to have Power in matters of Religion, to allow and determine of Do∣ctrine, and to appoint and institute in matters of Govern∣ment: and being Worldly Powers, do subject Themselves, and all the worldly People under them, to these mens Religion, Au∣thority, Doctrine, Discipline, &c. Whoever shall thus wor∣ship them: Or, SHALL RECEIVE HIS MARK, that is, this Principle, that, It is lawful to punish and persecute men in Matters that meerly relate to Faith and the Gospel, and this, under pretence of the Glory of God, and Good of

Christian people; which is the BEASTS MARK in every Age, and under every Change of Outward Form: Whoever shall receive this mark IN THEIR FOREHEAD, that is, to profess this Doctrine only: Or IN THEIR HAND, that is, to execute it according to Laws, which the Nations have been seduced to make to this purpose: The same shall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his Indignation, and he shall be tor∣mented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb, and the smoak of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever.
Wherefore You Faithful Ones have great cause to be very well advised in these things, seeing the chief Designe of Anti∣christ, is to seduce the Elect; seeing he hath no Body else in all the World, that dare oppose Him, or know how to do it, but You: and He knows, if He can prevail with You, all the World besides, will follow Him headlong, as the Gadarens swine ran into the sea, and were choaked.
Now I have adventured, through the Inspiration of the Al∣mighty, to undertake Openly and Plainly against the Clergy and Universities, which in their Present State are the Residue of the Hour and Power of Darkness upon the Nations: And the Lord of his Grace, hath helped me through this Work, by his Spirit of Counsel and Might. And so I have freely and wil∣lingly exposed my Self for Christ and his Truths sake, to all the reproaches, slanders, revilings, contradictions, and (if their power shall serve) Persecutions of the Universities and Cler∣gy, and of all those People high and low, bond and free who have received their Mark and Worship them: choosing rather to suffer with Christ, and with You, his Seed, all manner of Tribulations, then to reign with Them; and much rather imbracing Christian Communion, with poor plain Husband∣men and Tradsmen, who believe in Christ, and have received his Spirit, then with the Heads of Universities, and Highest, and Stateliest of the Clergy, who under a specious form of Godli∣ness, do yet live in true Enmity and Opposition to the Gospel.
I do indeed, freely acknowledge, that I have often been ready to complain to God in the anguish of my Spirit, that he had cal∣led

Me a very Bruised Reed, to a more difficult Task, in one Regard, then either Wickliffe, Hus, or Luther, those strong Pillars in the House of God; to wit, Because much of the gross Body of Antichristianism, against which They chiefly ingage∣ed, being done away by their Ministry, there still remains the cunning and subtil Soul and Spirit thereof, which yet is All in All, in Antichrists Kingdom, though it be farther removed from the Knowledge and Notice of the Common Sort of Chri∣stians. And so the Mysterie of Iniquity, is now become more Mysterious and Deceiving then in their Times: and as Perfect and Bitter Enmity against Christ and his Spirit, and the true Temple of God, the Spiritual Church, as ever was in all Their Times, doth now prevail under the Name of Orthodox Do∣ctrine, and the Reformation of Religion by the late Assembly of Divines, which the Clergy are all now ready to set up, if they could gain the Secular Arm to strengthen them thereunto, (of which now they have greatest Hopes) and without which, their Religion can find no high place in this World.
Now herein the old Mysterie of Iniquity is renewed amongst these Men, that they would have an outward Letter and Mini∣stery, without the Spirit of Christ, to be the Doctrine and Mini∣stry of the New Testament, which is the Ministration of the Spirit and not of the Letter: and would have the Secular Magi∣strate, to have Right and Power, to enforce men to such a Reli∣gion, as Himself judges True, by the Help and Counsel of those Ministers, which Himself judges Orthodox: as if some Men were able to teach spiritual things, and all to understand them, by Natural Reason made use of, and improved, which yet these Men deny in Terminis, whilst they assert it in the Principle. For, they will not leave it to the Father, to draw whom He pleaseth to the Son; neither will they leave it to the Spirit, to choose what Living stones he pleaseth, to build them together to be the Habitation of God: but the Ecclesiastical state, having seduced the Temporal, do make them believe, that the Magi∣strates Worldly Power, in union with their worldly Religion, may make a National Church of all, that they between Them∣selves, please; and may allow, and set up, such a Doctrine for Orthodox, which these Men who are in Academical Degrees▪

and Ecclesiastical Orders, do approve for Such; though the Spi∣rit of God in all Believers testifies, that these Men have not the mind of Christ, but of Antichrist, in all they teach, and act, and counsel; in their Assemblies, Churches, Doctrine, Ordi∣nances, Works, Duties, Dayes, Times, Fastings, Thanks∣givings, and Every Thing else: Yet these having the outward Carcass or Appearance of Religion, though destitute of the in∣ward Soul of it, which is true Faith and the Spirit of God, do cozen not only the meaner People, but the very Magistrates of the World, who are glad to hear, that the Clergy have given them such high Power in the Kingdom of Christ, and made them Magistrates in both Worlds; though indeed in the end, it be not for the Magistrates Advantage, but wholly for the Clergies.
And thus is the Mysterie of Iniquity grown more Mysteri∣ous now, then heretofore. But this is our Comfort and Help, that God still causes his Light to shine forth proportionably to his People, to discover every new Change and Form, of the My∣sterie of Iniquity. And though the Mysterie of Iniquity in every age, is mysterious enough, to cozen all the Unbelieving World, though never so wise and learned; yet is it never able to deceive the Faithful, who have always sufficient Light from God to dis∣cover it, and sufficient Grace to overcome it.
And now You faithful and beloved Ones, to whom I have spoken all this, stand You fast, and depart not from Christ, his Word, and Work (all which You know in faith) for any Good or Evil things, that may befall you in this short life; but finish in Faith and Patience, the Work which God hath given you to do, in your several Places, waiting for the Glory which shall be given you at the Revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; in Whom I remain, though most unworthy,
