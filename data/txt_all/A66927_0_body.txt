MY LORD,
WE read in Holy Writ, a Catalogue of King David's Worthies, who ventured their Lives to settle their Soveraign in the peace∣able
 possession of his Kingdom: But should I go about to give an account of those truly Loyal Heroes, who lately so freely ven∣tur'd their Lives and Fortunes for their King and Country, my Book wou'd swell to so prodigi∣ous a bulk, that it wou'd be tiresome and troublesome to read.
None were more singularly e∣minent in this blessed Work, than your Illustrious Lordship; and therefore the Dedication of this Loyal Book most properly be∣longs to you. The considerati∣on of which matchless Loyalty
 in your Lordship, has embol∣dened me to lay these my dull Labours at your Lordship's feet: If you vouchsafe to patronize them, let the Whigs spit out their Venom, as fast as Whales spout out Water, I value't not a Rush; I know they are the Seed of the old Serpent, and they'l nibble at my Heels, if they cannot bite me by the Throat. But having a glimps of your Lordship's Fa∣vour, where's the Ferguson I need to fear? What hurt can another Absalom, or Achitophel, do me? I humbly therefore beg, that this my poor (but Loyal) Labours, may find Protection under your
 Lordship's most loyal and indul∣gent Wing; not for any worth or ingenuity that can be found in them, but purely because this Fruit springs from a Loyal Tree.
My Lord! this is not a Piece for Phanaticks to countenance; I believe they will be so far from fa∣vouring of it, that they will burn it, and stab me if it lies in their power, unless God fastens some of those Texts of Scripture upon their hearts, to convince or convert them: but I dread them no more, than the Sun dreads the Dung∣hil; nor love them, no more than they love the King. If any
 thing can convert them, these Scriptures will; but if they wil∣fully sin against knowledg, and thereby bring upon themselves certain Damnation, there is no Art nor Power that can prevent it.
However, (God be praised for it) if this Loyal Book will not convince these Rebels, His Royal Majesty has a many No∣ble, Loyal, and Valorous He∣roes, (of whom your Lordship deservedly ought to be reckoned one of the chief) that are able to suppress thousands of them, and force them to their Obedience;
 your Lordship having already, by your Valour, and prudent Conduct, been a main Instru∣ment, under his Majesty, to re∣duce those Traitors and Rebels, who lately, with the height of Impudence, did rise in Rebellion against his Sacred Majesty; which glorious Action of yours, is not only delightful to all his Maje∣sty's Loyal and Loving Subjects, (for which they have your No∣ble and Heroick Person in vene∣ration) but the memory thereof will be (to your Lordship's never dying Honour) sweet and fresh in the mouths of all Loyal Subjects to succeeding Ages.

 Now to conclude; My humble Request to your Lordship is, That you will be pleased to ac∣cept of the good Will for the good Deed: I having ventur'd to compose and write this Book in Defence of Monarchy, who am one of the meanest and weakest of his Majesty's Subjects, having had the honour to serve his Ma∣jesty, in Military Employments, by Sea and Land, from my Youth to this present day; and therefore I hope Your Lordship will consider me, as a Souldier, that has liv'd more by the Sword than by the Word; and that will sufficiently excuse the want
 of those smooth Lines which o∣therwise you might justly have expected from me; wishing Your Lordship, and all Your Noble Family, all the happiness that Heaven can shower down upon You in this Life, and Eternal Happiness in the World to come: I presume to subscribe my self,
My Lord,
