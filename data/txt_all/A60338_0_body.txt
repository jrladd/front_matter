FEllow Souldiers; take it not ill I give you no other Titles, I conceive customary complements, in such a case as this, to be uncomly: out of my reall respect unto you I present you with this small Treatise, which cost me no small labour, let the wise and honest judge,
well as it is, if you have a share among those that mourne in Zion, Isa. 61.3. You will relish it; howsoever knowing there are many among you that un∣derstand the Language of Canaan, Jsa 19.18. I desire all may be judiciously perused be∣fore any part bee rashly censu∣red, be not too curious or cap∣tious; I am no Schollar, I desire to be a Christian, looke to the matter more then the hand∣ling, be wise for your selves, my Soule wisheth you all well: I aime neither at thankes, com∣mendations nor benefit, I sleight envy scorne and censure: I shall avoyde needlesse circum∣stances
and apply my selfe to brevity, truth and plainnesse: I desire to honour God, not to humour men; if our poore soules get any good hereby, I have enough; your good is intended, neglect it not, despise nothing because of my insufficiency; if in judgement and sincerity any will informe mee, I promise thankfulnesse, and (by Gods grace) amendment: for good received blesse God and pray for me, (unworthy). The Lord of hosts, the great Jehovah who is a man of War, our Chief Cap∣taine, be intreated to governe, strengthen preserve and prosper you all as mine own selfe, Amen.
