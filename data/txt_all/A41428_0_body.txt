My LORD,
THE address of this
short discourse to your
Lordship, hath a dou∣ble
encouragement;
the greatness of the Cause in which
it engageth, and the confidence it
hath of your Honours Patronage;
I mean not, my Lord, so much

from any interest of the Writer,
as of the Cause; which concern∣eth
no less than the Rights and
Priviledges of one of the learnedst
Societies in the world. I know
your Lordship too well, to think
the scale of Justice (when in your
hand) capable of being weighed
down by favour or affection, be the
occasion of it never so moving;
nor indeed doth our Cause want
it: yet if strictness of Integrity
could be any wayes bowed in your
Lordship, it would be in regard
to Learning and the support of a
noble and ingenuous Art, against
the barbarous attempts of rude
and illiterate Impostors. The
Colledge of Physicians have long

since received particular marks
of your Lordships favour; which
they owe to the great intimacy
your Lordship hath had with
Nature her self; and the con∣sequent
value you must needs put
upon all such, whose Industry
and parts have recommended them
to her familiarity: Whether the
Colledge deserve that character
no man better understandeth than
your Lordship, to whom few or
none of their writings or other
transactions are probably unknown.
And it is their happiness in this
juncture of affairs, where so ma∣ny
machinations and contrivances
are made against them, that the
two Chief Justices of this Land

are Men so abundantly accom∣plished
in all Learning, that is
necessary to the true Stating of
the question; both of You being
fit to be made the Oracles of Phi∣losophy,
as well as Law; and to
give a true estimate of the diffe∣rence
between an Academick edu∣cation
backed with Experience
and Industry in practice; and the
impudent pretensions of a few
broken Trades-men, &c. I for∣bear
worse names to them, though
never so deserved, nay bestowed
upon each other in their own
writings; because of the reve∣rence
I bear your Lordship,
whose ears are not fit to be abused
with such language, and whose

inclinations lead you to attend to
things and not to persons; con∣sidering
not the interest of any
particular Man or Society, but of
the Nation, which very much
depends upon the issue of the con∣troversie
managed in this Treatise,
by,
My Lord,
Your Lordships most
humble and devoted
Servant,
