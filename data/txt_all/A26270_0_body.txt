My Lord,
A Soldier cannot lay the Endeavours of his Pen any where so properly, as at your Lorships Feet. We have seen you in Flanders, as great as at Kensing∣ton: You were the Delight of our own Troops, and the Terrour of our Enemies, the mighty Darling of Mars and Minerva. In Your Lordship alone, we found all those fatal Contrarieties reconcil'd: The Cap∣tain was a Courtier, the Courtier a Man of Honour, the Man of Honour preferr'd. But not to be tedious, where the most that can be said will be too little; Your Lord∣ship was all that Man cou'd wish, or Man cou'd be.
The brightest Planet of the Creation has been Eclips'd; But Europe's Genius alas cou'd not long support your Retirement: For tho' his present Majesty, tis true, cou'd manage an Army without a Marlborough,
yet there was another task more difficult, and out of his Sphere too, I mean that glo∣rious Imployment Your Lordship possesses at St. James's. The Education of so Great, so Young, so Hopeful a Prince, adds not more to your Grandeur, than it subtracts from your Tranquility: For the Charge of so inestimable a Jewel, cannot but make Your Lordship very solicitous. The Early dawning of his Infant Years, gave us all assurances he would be something extraor∣dinary: Every day shews us more and more the collected Endowments of all his Royal Predecessors: And if the rest of those who are about His Highness's Person, could come any thing near Your Lordship in Care or Capacity, He cannot possibly be other∣wise than as Wise as Tiberius, as Victorious as Alexander, as Valiant as Julius, and as happy as Augustus.
But I rob my Prince and the Publick too by the length of this Dedication: Where∣fore my Lord, I humbly crave Pardon for the Liberty I have taken, so publickly to profess my Self,
My Lord,
