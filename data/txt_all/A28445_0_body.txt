SIR,
THE Value I have
ever had for your
Writings, makes
me impatient to peruse all
Treatises that are crown'd
with your Name; where∣of,
the last that fell into
my Hands, was your Re∣ligio

Laici; whieh expres∣ses
as well your great Judg∣ment
in, as Value for Reli∣gion:
a thing too rarely
found in this Age among
Gentlemen of your Parts;
and, I am confident, (with
the Blessing of God upon
your Endeavours) not un∣likely
to prove of great
Advantage to the Publick;
since, as Mr. Herbert well
observes,
A Verse may find him, who
a Sermon flies,
And turn Delight into a
Sacrifice.

We read in Ancient
Times, before the Institu∣tion
of Moral Philosophy
by Socrates, that Poets in
general were to the People
in stead of their Sacred
Writ, from whom they re∣ceived
their Divinity, and
Opinion concerning the
Gods; as, who, and how,
to be worshipped, how
pleased and pacified, by
what Prayers and Ceremo∣nies,
together with such
Rites and Ceremonies as
were the Dionysiaca, Cybe∣liaca,
Isiaca, Eleusiniaca, and

the like, Instituted by Or∣pheus.
All which were
built upon this Ground,
That there could be no
true Poet but must be Di∣vinely
inspired; and if Di∣vinely
inspired, then cer∣tainly
to be believed. This
we find largely disputed
and asserted even by Phi∣losophers
of best Account
in those Days. But the
two main Arguments in∣duced
them to that Belief,
were; First, That extraor∣dinary
Motion of Mind
wherewith all good Poets

in all Ages have been pos∣sessed
and agitated: And,
secondly, The Testimony of
Poets themselves, who pro∣fessing
themselves Inspired,
have made particular Rela∣tions
of strange Visions,
Raptures, and Apparitions
to that purpose: So that
as the Beginning, Growth,
and Confirmation of Ido∣latry
may be ascribed (as
by many it is) to Poets, and
their Authority; so also to
supposed Enthusiasms and
Inspirations, upon which
that Authority was chiefly

grounded. Hence it is,
that many Ancient Au∣thors,
as Aristotle, Strabo,
and others, affirm, That
Poetry (in matter of Wri∣ting
and Composition) was
in use long before Prose:
which might seem strange,
if not incredible, did we
judge by the Disposition
of later Times; but of
those Enthusiastick Times,
not less probable, than
certain, as our Learned
Casaubon well observes.
And this I thought fitting
to premise, in Answer to

that Obection which your
Modesty is so apprehen∣sive
of, viz. That being
a Laick, you interpose in
Sacred Matters.
Rapin (in his Reflexi∣ons)
speaking of the neces∣sary
Qualities belonging
to a Poet, tells us, He must
have a Genius extaordina∣ry,
great Natural Gifts, a
Wit just, fruitful, piercing,
solid, and universal; an Vn∣derstanding
clean and di∣stinct;
an Imagination neat
and pleasant; an Elevation

of Soul, that depends not
only on Art or Study, but is
purely a Gift of Heaven,
which must be sustained by a
lively Sense and Vivacity;
Judgment, to consider wisely
of Things; and Vivacity,
for the beautiful Expression
of them, &c. Now this
Character is so justly yours,
as I cannot but think that
he described what a great
Poet should be, by hearing
what you were; and the
rather, since I have been
informed by some English
of his Acquaintance, That

Monsieur Rapin was studi∣ous
in our Language, on∣ly
for your sake: Nor
would his Pains be lost.
'Tis a Question not ea∣sily
to be decided, Whe∣ther
you have been more
serviceable to the Peace of
the State in your Absolom
and Achitophel, or to the
Church in your Religio
Laici, or to the Nobility
and Gentry in the innocent
Recreation of your Plays?
A Country-Retirement,
like that of Ovid's, to one

that has led the Spring
of his Age, and Vigour
of his Youth, among the
Noise and Pleasures of the
Town, is certainly a Trans∣formation
no less disa∣greeable,
than that which
the Poets feign of Acteon,
or Sacred Writ of the As∣syrian
Monarch, who gra∣zed
with the Beasts of the
Field; and to abandon a
Covent-Garden Society for
the Insipid Dull Converse
of a Country Village,
(where the Nomination
of New Healths is the

heighth of their Inventi∣on)
would render a Rural
Life to be no less than a
Civil Death, were it not
for Mr. Dryden's Writings,
which keep us still alive,
and, by a most Natural
Representation of the Hu∣mours
of the Town, make
us flatter and fansie our
selves (like the Enjoyment
of a Lover's Dream) to be
still there.
But I shall wave these
Acknowledgments to you,
as things too general to

be engrossed by me alone:
And will now spend the
Remainder of this Epistle
in informing you of the
Occasion of my troubling
you with this small Piece,
which I Entitle by the
Name of Religio Laici,
from a Treatise of the
Lord Herbert of Cherburie's
so called; whose Notions
I have often made use of,
and grounded the Chief
of my Discourse upon his
Five Catholick or Vniver∣sal
Principles: Wherein
my only Aim is, to assert

an Vniversal Doctrine, such
as no ways opposeth the
Religion Established a∣mong
us, and which may
tend both to the Pro∣pagation
of Vertue, and
Extirpation of Vice, as
well as to the Reconcilia∣tion
of those Dissenters
now in England, who have
of late so disturbed the
Quiet of this Realm, and
who, under the Pretence
of Religion, would ex∣clude
all Governours but
themselves. For, as a late

Author well observes, Eve∣ry
Opinion makes a Sect;
every Sect, a Faction; and
every Faction (when it is
able) a War: and every
such War is the Cause of
God; and the Cause of
God can never be prosecu∣ted
with too much Violence:
So that all Sobriety is
Lukewarmness; and to be
Obedient to Government,
Carnal Compliance. Which
are the Opinions of those
that would rob Caesar of
his Due, as well as re∣move

the Peoples ancient
Land-marks.
But for my part, as in
Civil Politicks, I would
not, in this so Ancient
and so Lineal a Monarchy,
abandon the Beams of so
fair a Sun, for the dread∣ful
Expectation of a di∣vided
Company of Stars;
so neither, in Ecclesiasticks,
do I covet to be without
the Pale of the Church:
since, though I will not
Dogmatically affirm, (as

some do) That Episcopa∣cy
is Jure Divino; yet
(with the Lord Bacon) I
say, and think ex Anim,
That it is the nearest to
Apostolical Truth, and the
most coherent with Mo∣narchy:
Wherein, I know,
you will not differ from
me.
And therefore, Sir, at
this time, when the Name
of Christ is made use of
to palliate so great Vil∣lanies
and Treasons, un∣der

the Pretext of God's
Cause, against both King
and Government, I thought
I could do no less than
snatch up all Weapons that
might defend the Publick,
and hope I have not
lighted upon one with a
double Edge.
I have endeavoured
that my Discourse should
be onely a Continuance
of yours; and that, as
you taught Men how to
Believe, so I might in∣struct

struct them how to Live.
For, as Dr. Donne well
observes, Though Christi∣anity
is the Fort or Citadel,
yet Vertue and Moral Ho∣nesty
are its Fences and
Out-works, whereby alone
it is teneable. Wherefore,
I designed this Treatise of
mine to be onely an Ad∣dition,
or rather the Con∣sequence
of yours; encou∣raging
Men to Live up
to the Vertue of that Do∣ctrine
you teach. Which,
with your Pardon for the

present, and Friendship for
the future, is the highest
Ambition of,
SIR,
