BELOVED Friends, and Brethren you have been earnest, and
are now wellnigh hopelesse, and therefore by this time may possibly be
(for ought I know) half angry Expectants of some∣thing or other from
me in answer to that True Counterfeit (so I call it) of the Ashford
Disputation; A Pamphlet, so injurious (not so much to me as the truth) that
twas provocation enough to the presse of itself, to one so clearly concerned in
it as my self, but as if it were not, was a while after seconded by another:
Ne∣verthelesse, what evill surmises soever you have of my so long si∣lence, as
I dare not say I am altogether blamelesse, so I dare say I am not altogether
excuselesse in the businesse, for veri∣ly 
* Witnes the Letter sent to me, in the name of
 more, from from one of the oppo∣nents; which, in fuller sa∣tisfaction
 concerning my call to this work, is extant at the end of this Epistle.
as twas little lesse then half a year after the Disputation before that Hasty
Birth of theirs came to light, in which time it threat∣ned the Country to come
out upon it, and at last came (out upon't) indeed, so was it little lesse then
a quarter after the nativity of that trifle before I received, from the
Publishers thereof, the co∣py of it, together with this ensuing Summons to let
somewhat be seen in my own right, in which since its declared that they would
needs interpret my total silence as a giving of the cause, I stood, as strictly
engaged▪ so from thenceforth Irrevocably resolved (be∣ing elsewise
indifferent) as the Lord should lend me strength, life, and leasure (not in my
own, but the Gospels Right, which now I saw must suffer, if I were silent) to
set upon this wearisom work, notwithstanding which resolution of mine, what by
Part∣ly my often avocations from home in way of service to the truth, 
 there being (if I may become a fool so far without offence, in
sa∣tisfaction to such Churches as compel me to it by their unjust of∣fences at
my just absence from them as here to utter it) no lesse then
en publique (not to speak of
Private) Disputations, in which I have been actually interessed since that of
Ashford, besides publique preachings, other occasional meetings, and
writings, Church visitings, and visitations of sick members, to whom I have
been moved several times to move many miles in such junctures, when (saving the
pressingnesse of that case) no other should have importund me to have stired an
inch out of my own dores▪ Partly my own necessary occasions and
outward affaires at home, which I am (though but little) yet to this day too
much intangled in for a Souldier of Christ: Partly one long and
tedious sicknesse which my God was pleased to exercise me with toward the dead
of one winter (a) for almost a quarter together, so that I was in all
that 
* In which sad winter visitation I may not but
 ta noice here, in satisfaction to the
 deluded world, how miserably I was misreporte to have met the Divel in a field, to have been out of my wis, and senses, stark mad, bound down
 in my bed, to have renounced, and that with raging, that way of the
 , which, throw Gods goodnsse, I stand fast in to this hour, of
 all which not the least Jota is true, and this too no onely by much people, but▪ in
 part also by such of the Priesthood, as lived neer enough to me to have given
 tuer intelligence, had they, or
 their Erwigs been ei∣ther of them
 any better then they should be. time, and somewhat more, neither capable
to stir much without dores, nor do much within. Partly (if not
principally) an ear∣nest desire I had (as deeming it not worth while to trouble
the world, and travel throw the Presse with no more profitable a birth, then a
bare contradiction to that Bawble of theirs, which doth more then sufficiently
contradict it self, and a meer Nuga∣tory Negation of a few false Affirmatives,
that are made in that Account concerning my silly self and one poor particular
dispu∣tation) to stop more gaps with one bush▪ and to hand forth som∣thing
more for publique use together with it, as I here have done, namely, not onely
two entire Treatises, viz. Anti-rantism, and
Anti-ranterism▪ both which bear little or no particular reference
to the Ashford Disputation, but also very many usefull Anim∣adversions
of a number of lame Arguments, Empty Answers, absolue Absurdities, Babish
Balings▪ Sophistical
shuffles, and clear Contradictions, sometimes to themselves▪ and often to
each other in their carrying on of the same cause (which are therefore the more
remarkable) that are in the books of their best Champions, 
Dr. Fealey, Dr. Holmes. Mr Marshall Mr Bayly. Mr Blake.
 Mr Cotton. M Cobbet. Mr Cooke. all which as
it askt me no small time to tumble ore, to summon together, and enter in a new
Treaty with, to see if I could yet possibly find cause to agree with, and fall
back to them in the point of Infant baptism, before I struck a stroke a∣gainst
them with my pen, so when I could come to no accomo∣dation by that last parly,
but saw them all at odds among them∣selves,  and consquently saw more occasion then ever to
fall out with them afresh, it took me up much more time to encounter with them
all, for so I was fain to do more or lesse occasionally, as I found them in
their several works falling in to the help of the Ash∣ford Disputants
by the way:
Finally partly the starting of fresh Hares (I had almost
said Fox∣es) 
* M Symson of Sardens so veraign pre servative a∣gainst Ana∣baptism.
 Mr. Baxters Plain Scrip∣ture proofs. upon me whilest I was
working to wearinesse in desrying
the starting hole of the old
ones, which occasioned, yea even neces∣sitated me to take up and follow those
new sents, unlesse I would rather suffer them to range up and down, and do
mischief without putting on in the least measure to prevent them: more
especially that Hasty birth of Mr. Baxters, which as well for the sake
of some Friends, that commended it to my consideration, as for the sake of that
deep delusion I saw the whole Country to be under by do∣ting on it, I was
constrained to speak (as I have done at the end of
Anti-rantism) though succinctly, yet more distinctly to, then to any
other.
VVhat (I say) with these obstructions Partly▪ and
some other also of another nature, I have been forced inevitably to presse your
patience (Dear Friends) almost to death: wherupon I chal∣lenge you
notwithstanding to forbear Murmurring and acting in
uch sullennesse, as, because the
book came out no sooner, therupon to neglect it altogether: if my paines may
not abate his displeasure, and ballance his patience, who is offended without a
cause, for not hasting it out by the halves, as some (for ought I see) had
ra∣ther I should have done, then tarried till I had done the tenth of what I
intended. I desire that man, who ever he is, either to fry still in the fire of
his own fretfull humour, or else to please him∣self, when he sees Good, without
amends from me, who having disposed of this, thats out, to the publique service
as soon as I could well do it acceptably to God, whose providence hath hitherto
pre∣vented me, dare not disparage his acceptance of me so much, as, in what I
have it, to ask forgivenesse from men:
Its never long that comes at last, if withall it effect that in
order to which it comes, and if you say, Bis, qui cito, he does
in∣deed, that dispatches, I say Sat cito, si sat bene, soon enough, if
well enough, or else too soon even yet: whether this present Bulk doth performe
its errand so well or no, as to be worth your waiting so long for it, Its not
for me to determine; I leave it to your strictest examination, regardlesse
utterly of any censure, whether yours, or theirs, to whom it beares strictest
Relation, my business in it lying more with God, then either them, or you; wel
knowing that he, who spends himself in thoughts of what others think of him
& his, hath more pride then wit, and more time then grace and wisdome to
improve it, let the work therefore stand or fall to its own Master, Ile neither
beg any mans good word for  it, nor put it under any patronage, but
Christs, from whom it came to me, and to whom together with all honour, thanks
and praise for his assistance of me most unworthy creature in it I de∣dicate it
back again. If any quarrel with the length of it now it is come, as some do in
that it was so long ere it came, and ask why I have laid such a large and
voluminous siege to so small and tri∣vial a fort, such poor paper works, as
might have been battered and taken in much lesse time, and with a far lesse
train of Artillery then is here brought against the Ashford
Disputation? I desire them to understand, that howbeit the daring defiance
thereof engaged me to make my first onset upon that petty Garrison, so that
there is as it were a vein of dispute therewith continuing, and running (for
the most part) throwout the whole Volume; yet the battle is also with the main
body of their worthies (as I said be∣fore) according as (inter
pregnandum) they have occasionally bin accessary to their relief.
Secondly, Possession is eleven points of the twelve, in which
respect, they being but defendants, and we now indeed (as they say page the
first) invading, or rather re-invading (for they at first by their own
invention brought innovation, and invasion upon the truth) both them and the
practise of their Church in the point of infant sprinkling, which are both
prae∣possed already of all Christendome, and have now of a long time planted,
seated, and settled themselves so firmly in the dark Cells of mens in most
consciences and affections, that it hath been and is not onely hatefull, but
hazardous for any to storm them out, we go upon no small disadvantages, and so
had need be more free of our shot then else we should be; Intus existens
facile prohibet alienum, a few within the walls may be a match to many
that are yet without, how much more when the stormed are ma∣ny to one of those
that storm them, even four hundred and fifty of the rest to few of the Lords
Elijahs.
Thirdly, An ell too long is better than an inch too short: he that
likes not the length hath enough of the same to make it shor∣ter to himself
when he pleases, and liberty from the Authour to look into as little of it as
he lists.
Fourthly if you find it not greater in quantity then in quality
advantagious to the truth, it may welcome it self into reasonable mens
affections, when such a short shuffle as that it relates to, may, without
injury, be shut out of doors.
If the title of it chance to trouble Any body, that shall
not at all trouble me: for though the Ashford disputation, which it
main∣ly answers to, was assuredly penned by Some Body, yet No
Body is pleased to own it, and therefore to him, even to No body,
it was most meet to superscribe the answer.
In a word, and to conclude (for it were an unreasonable 
 thing, & no less then to set my self upon a new score by
wiping out the old one, if while I am excusing my self for detaining the book
so long from you, I should detain you long from the book it self, now it is
out, by a long Epistle) what ere tis, here tis, if Every Body be free
from the guilt of those errors and Heesies, those fop∣peries, and falties, those dissembling shifts, and con∣tradictions, ignorances and
other evils that are here condemned, then No body shall have need to
com∣plain of it, for then it complains of No Body at all, but if
Any Body suspects shrewdly that it speaks to him, it speaks to him
indeed.
