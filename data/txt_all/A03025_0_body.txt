Right Honorable,
I Have pro∣vided
a
PRESENT
proporti∣onable
to my skill
my time and your

Honors knowledge
of me, short: Your
desire many times to
heare others writing
out of my mouth,
made mee to put this
of my owne into
your hands; a rapso∣die
of resolves and
observations, some
for contemplation, o∣thers
for caution, the
first divine, the other
morall, when you
lose an houre from
better and graver

matters, throw it a∣way
on these; wher∣in
you have some∣what
of God, of o∣thers,
of our selves,
what God is to us,
what we should bee
to him, to others: there
cannot be much said
of it, because there is
but little said in it; in
all which little I in∣tend
nothing to my
selfe, but to others.
The generall end of
reading is to know,

but the end of divine
reading is to good
our knowledge, and
if it doe good, I have
my end, and my re∣ward,
whose office
is to live, not to my
selfe, but others, and
am a servant to all by
a common duety, but
your Honors by espe∣ciall
relation
