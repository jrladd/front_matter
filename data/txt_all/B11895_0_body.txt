BOth louing friends, forasmuch as by reason of an ague, I was inforced to keepe my chamber, and to abandon idlenes, I tooke in hande my pen to fi∣nish an idle worke I had begun, at the command and seruice of a faire Dame, being most exqui∣sitly well featured, and of as excellent good car∣riage, adorned with vertue: and vnderstanding the storie, and knowing you both to be of suffi∣cient valour, wit, and honestie, presumed to dedi∣cate the same to you, not doubting but that you will vouchsafe for my sake, to maintaine the ho∣nour of so sweete a Saint. Thus crauing you my deare friends to be patrones of these fewe Son∣nets: being well perswaded you will excuse my
 unlearned writing, in regard you may be assured I am no scholler, as dooth appeare by this my worthles verse: hoping you will receiue my good∣will with content, as I my selfe shall be then best satisfied. And so wishing you both as much comfortable happines, as to my soule: I bid you heartily farewell.
