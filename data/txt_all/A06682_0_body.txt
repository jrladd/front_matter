IT is reported of Caesar (Right Honourable) that oft times he praised his Souldiours good∣will, although they wanted skill: And Cicero aswell commended stamme∣ring Lentulus for his painful industry, as learned Laelius for his passing elo∣quence: Which considered (although wisedome did will mee not to straine further than my sleive would stretch) I thought good to present this small Treatise to your H. protection, hoping

your H. will out of your accustomed clemencie, accept it, and take my well meaning for an excuse of my boldnesse, in that my poore will is not in the wane, whatsoever this imperfect worke doth want. The Emperour Trajan was ne∣ver without suters, because so courteous∣ly hee would heare everie complaint. The Lapidaries continually frequen∣ted the Court of Adobrandinus, be∣cause it was his chiefe study to search out the nature of stones. All that courted Atlanta were hunters, and none sued to Sapho but Poëts: Where∣soever Mecaenas lodgeth, thither no doubt will Schollers flocke. And your H. beeing a worthie favourer and fosterer of learning, hath forced many through your exquisit vertue, to offer the first fruits of their study at the shrine of your Courtesie. But though they have waded farre and found mynes, and I gadded abroad to get nothing but mytes: yet this I assure my selfe,

that they never presented you their treasure with a more willing mind, hen I doe this simple trash, which I hope your H. will so accept. Resting herefore upon your wonted clemen∣ie, I commit you to the Almigh∣ie.
