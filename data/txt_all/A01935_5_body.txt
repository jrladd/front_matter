RIGHT WORSHIP.
I Remember that David, Psal. 23. 4. tooke as much comfort in the Rod whereâˆ£with he was smitten, as in the Staffe whereby he was upholden: And J consider that your Jurisdiction over me, is as well corrective for what is amisse, as directive in what is aright. Take (J beseech you) this Tender from my hand, as a testimony

from my heart, that J am yours in both, and doe as kindly accept of the one, as J embrace the other. Thus nudus ad ignotum, J prostrate my selfe, and pray both for your temporall, and your eternall welfare.
