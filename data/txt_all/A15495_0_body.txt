GReat, manifolde, and terrible (Right Honorable) are the tumults, turmoyles, troubles, feares, and angui∣shes, which the remem∣brance of sinnes bypast, and present, con∣ioyned with the carefull contemplation, and inward consideration of Gods gree∣uous threatninges, and wrathfull indig∣nation set foorth in holy Scriptures, bring vnto weake, troubled, and ignorant, con∣sciences. Great againe is the diligence,
 and continuall is the wandering to and fro of Sathan, that deadly and mortall foe of mankind, to tempt and assault, to bring to desperation, & deuoure sinners at all times, & in all places; but especially in the dayes of affliction, troubles, plagues, pestilences, and sicknesses; yea, and most of all at the hower of death, when man is at the weakest, and most vn∣fit and vnable to withstand him; when mans memorie fayleth him, and his sen∣ces waxe dull, his body is tormented and feebled, his heart faynteth, his wittes decay, and euery part of his body ceasseth to performe and fulfill his due office: then, euen then I say, most vigilant, di∣ligent, and busie is that foule feende to vexe, trouble, disquiet, to turmoyle men, and to worke blasphemie and desperation in their heartes by laying before the eyes of their consciences al their former sinfull maner of lyuing, and vngodly conuersa∣tion, the breach of Gods commaunde∣mentes, and his greeuous wrath against offenders; the vnsupportable paynes, and
 torturing tormentes, death, and damna∣tion; which, are prepared for the wicked with the Diuell and his damned Angels. The consideration of these thinges, and the great negligence, carelesnesse, and contempt of prouiding remedies and phisicke in due time, against this dange∣rous disease of Desperation, hath moued mee at this present, to employ my Penne, according to that one poore talent which the Lord God hath committed vnto mee to the setting foorth of this Treatise fol∣lowing, therby to arme and furnish poore ignorant Christians with some necessarie counsaile, comfort, and spirituall phy∣sicke, whereby they may become the more able and readie in time of neede, to de∣fende themselues; yea, and to propell and driue backe their common enemie: the Diuell tempting and entising to the most deadly sinne of Desperation.
These my poore laboures (written both for the comfort of my selfe, and strengthe∣ning of mine owne Fayth, and for the like good of others, if they will for their
 owne good, take the paines to reade, con∣sider, and accept thereof) I your Ho∣nours poore incumbent of the medietie of the Rectorie of Ruskington in Lin∣colnshire, the true and vndoubted Pa∣tronage whereof lately was the Kinges Maiesties, and now is yours to dispose at your Honours good lyking, haue attemp∣ted to send forth to the view of the world vnder your shielding protection, and patrocinie. And so with my humble pe∣tition for th' acceptance hereof, with that submission that best befitteth my selfe, and belongeth to a person of so great place, & calling, I humbly lake my leaue.
At Ruskington in Lincoln∣shire
this first of Nouember. 1604.
