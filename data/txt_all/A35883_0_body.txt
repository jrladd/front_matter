Dear Countrymen and Friends,
SOME of you, I believe, out of very good Design to save your own Souls, have deserted our Church. And truly, if there had been any real ground for the mighty Noise that of late has been made against our Liturgy, and Church-Government, I should not have troubled you with this Dialogue: No reasonable Man can blame you for avoiding Things which are really Superstitious, or making your Salvation as safe as may be; but wise Men should not easily be carried away with empty Words, which are only made use of by others to weaken the Protestant Interest. I have read over and over our Controversie, and it is most certain that Lay-men can have no Concernment in it, but only when they receive the Sacrament of the Supper; were you commanded to fall down upon your Knees at the Elevation of the Host, according to the Practice of the Church of Rome, you might have Pretence to Charge us with Idolatry; but our Church declares against a Substantial Change in the Elements: If it is our Duty to pray to God on our Knees on stated
Hours, how can it be criminal to give God the like Ceremony, when we are at the most solemn Ordinance in all Religion? I have in these Papers avoided Prolixity, and all Rhetorical and Affected Expressi∣ons, that you may in a little Time, and with Ease understand your Duty. If they will rectifie your Mistakes, which (though I believe contrary to your Designs) are very destructive to the Happiness of the Church the Peace of the Nation, and the Glory of God, I shall be fully satisfied; and that little Time that you will spend in the reading of them, will to be very good Purpose.
You must own that Divisions are very warmly spoke against in the New Testament, which Consideration may justifie me for Writing, and oblige you to under∣stand perfectly what Grounds you have to separate from our Establish'd Church.
