My Noble Lord,
THis Excellent HISTORY concerning The Wonderfull Things of Nature, was written in Latin; and digested into Ten Classes, by a Native of another Countrey: who was himself indeed A Wonder in Nature, and might well make up the Ele∣venth Classis with the History of himself, for his generall and vast under∣standing in the Universe, as will appear to all men that will take the pains (so full of profit and delight) to read his Writings. In his Life-time he was much conversant in England and Scotland, to search out the Wonderfull Things in these Nations. And if Englishmen well weigh and consider it, they cannot but thankfully make their returns unto Almighty God for it, since there is no Countrey of the World that is in all things comparable to Great Britany it self, being adorned with so many strange and wonderfull things. I shall not need to mention the particulars (which have furnished the Author in severall Classes with some varieties.) For I fear the World will judge that I have said too much already unto your Honour upon this Subject (who is far better acquainted with the Wonders and Rarities of these Nations than my self) and that I have betray'd my own Ignorance, to offer a Translation of mine, unto your Honour, who is so well versed in the Originall, and which cannot be parallel'd when it is made to speak any other Language. But I hope your Honour will excuse this Attempt, because the Authour was a great Lover of our Countrey, and therefore it was held convenient to make him a free Denizon, and to speak English for the publick Good, which your Honour hath alwaies labour'd to advance by your honourable Actions; and I fear not, but your Noblenesse will tenderly Embrace what is undertaken for that end; though this Translation can adde nothing to your Honour, but seeks for honour from your noble Patronage. Yet since it pleased God to af∣ford me this opportunity to put your Honour in remembrance of me, who was formerly a Schollar at Eaton Colledge, and contemporary with your Honour; and that I once had the happinesse to be domestick Servant unto your Honour Noble Father, who now rests in God, and who was then pleased to honour me

so much, as to have the review, and commit to the publick view his, Immortall and Pious Work, entituled, Contemplatio Mortis et Immortalitatis, the fruits whereof he now enjoyes. And that his Honour, for above 40 years ac∣cepted my Father to attend so near his Person to do him Service for his bodily health; I knowing also how much I owe to the Memory of your noble Uncles, to that Reverend Prelate of the Garter James Lord Bishop of Winchester, and Sir Sidney Mountague, who were both my Honoured Patrons; I might be taxed with high ingratitude, if having nothing better to present your Honour with than this Famous Authours Work, (though in a meaner dresse) I had unadvisedly dedicated it to any other Person, and overpast so fair an occasion, whereby I now expresse my due Respects unto your Honoured Father's Memory, and to all your Family, and in particular to your Honour, to whom I and my Fathers house stand so much obliged. My humble Suit is, that your Honour will let passe all other Considerations herein, and to regard onely the gratefull Mind of him, who shall alwayes pray God to blesse your Honour, and your Noble Family, with all blessings Temporall and Eternal, in Him who is the Fountain of all blessednesse, the Lord Jesus Christ; and shall remain
