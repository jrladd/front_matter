My Lord,
In remembrance of your worthy Brother, our late Dean of Gloucester, I offer your Lordship these brief Discourses. In his Study, I first met with that useful Collection of Ec∣clesiastical Epistles, where this is exstant. At his House, under his favour, first came I into your knowledge. Now, after his decease, his Name, dear still to us who once enjoyed his learn∣ed, generous, and obliging Converse, will add some Grace unto these Papers in your Eye: and your Name, my Lord, worthily advanced to your high Office, will make them acceptable to some of this great people under your Government. I heartily wish, we may all Translate into our minds the sedate and pacific temper of this Author. A man above my Praise. Whose Writings (as it was said, in the last Age, of his Country-man the great Erasmus) are the delight of our learned World. If any Reader please to dissent from the Opinion of the excel∣lent Grotius, he may: but then he ought not to be displeased, if another dissent from him.
A difference in some Questions may well con∣sist with Christian Charity. The encrease of this rare virtue is the Design both of the Au∣thor and the Translator.
God Almighty, grant your Lordship a year of peace: that you may see the State and Church-affairs to flourish; and Pious men who now go under several new, to close in one and that the old and best Denomination.
