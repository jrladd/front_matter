MOst Mighty Monarch of this mourning Land,
Vpon the knees of my submissiue mind:
I begge acceptance at your Royall hand,
That my lamenting Muse may fauour finde.
My Gracious Master was so good so kinde,
So iust, so much beloued neere and sarre:
Which generally did Loue, and Duiy binde
From all, and from me in particular.
But as your Maiesty vndoubted are,
The Heire vnto his Vertues and his Crowne:
I pray, that whether Heauen send Peace or Warre,
You likewise may inherit his Renowne.
And as Death strucke his Earthly Glory downe,
Left you in Maiesty, and mourning Chiefe:
Yet through the World apparantly 'tis knowne,
Your Sorrow is an vniuersall Griefe.


Let this recomfort then your Princely heart,
That in this Duty all men beares a part.
