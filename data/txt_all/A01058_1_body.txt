SIr hauing so contriued these Musickes as their seuerall natures requires a diuision I could not amongst manie friendes thinke vpon two more worthy to bee ioynde in this Dedication then your selues, aswell for your neere alliance in blood, loue and fauour to Musicke, which neuer goes vnaccompanied with other vertues, as also the many particular fauours I haue receiued frō you both, hauing no gratification or token of my loue and thankefulnes, but these issues of my braine, which I intreate you to accept & take in good part, my cheifest labor in setting thē forh hath bin to expresse my inuention with as much facility and ease as possibly I could to the end (since it is a Musicke so generally pleasing) they who bestaffect it, may with little labour be actors of their owne delightes. If you find in them any matter of worth I haue my rewarde, if any matter of content I haue my end, which is nothing else then by some agreeable testimony, to leaue in you both, an impression of my thankefull remem∣rance of your loue and fauors.
