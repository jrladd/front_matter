Right Worshipfull,
WEre it not an Injury to desire, that good∣nes shold hinder any man from Glory, I dare say, that all that know you, would unfainedly wish you an immortalitie in this present world, that you might live

for ever to doe good, having done so much good while you live. Howbeit, as tis said of good Iehojada, 2 Chron. 24. 16. when he waxed old and died (though he were but a subject, yet) they buried him among the Kings, Because (saith the Text) hee had done good in Is∣rael, both towards God and towards his House. Even so may it happen to you from the King of Kings. God send you an honourable interment when yo die, and a Crowne of everlasting Glory when you are dead and gone.
Thus Prayes
