NOthing but your Importunity could have been sufficiently prevalent to make this Discourse appear in pub∣lick: for I am so conscious of my own In∣abilities, that I should have thought your Candour and Zeal for the good of the Church and Nation had imposed too much upon your Judgment, when you moved me to let you print it; but that all men give so full Encomiums of your worth, that I must have no small stock of Infidelity to doubt it. Such as it is, I here humbly present you with, and desire it may have its designed end; that it may promote Unity and Peace, and perswade men not to put that asunder in Practice, which God hath joyned in Pre∣cept,
 namely Fear to Himself, and Honour to his Vice-gerents; into the number of which your Merits have worthily promoted you, and made you Representative in that great and no∣ble City, unto him who is Representative to the great King of Heaven. And therefore although the World may blame my Pre∣sumption in this Action, yet it cannot ac∣cuse my Obedience, since it is to your Com∣mands; and especially since those Com∣mands descended so low as to become Re∣quests, and thereby rendred themselves the more obliging: which since they have gi∣ven me the boldness to venture these follow∣ing pages abroad, I beg that of you, which your native Generosity will prompt you to vouchsafe, namely your Patronage of them, and hereby you will honour
