ADvice to a Painter has been so popular a
Title, and so often the fair Frontispeice
to very extraordinary Poems on many
great and memorable Occasions, that our Author
thought fit to take pattern from so many celebra∣d
Originals, in this following Satyr: and how si∣t
soever his own modesty might be, This I will
esume to say for him, that he has put his best
and to the work, and labour'd for your Diversi∣.
And I must add this farther Advantage that

possibly the Subject is one of the greatest of late
Ages, viz. The Defeat of the French Fleet:
But notwithstanding the Height of the Theme, I
hope your perusal will find that the Structure has
not disgraced the Foundation.
Considering how far the Fate of England de∣pended
on the success of this Navall Decision; and
how melancholly an Aspect the whole Chain of the
English Providences in that signal Victory has
rais'd on the whole French and Frenchified
Party; perhaps the Resentments of the Enraged
Lewis, the beaten Tourvill, the mortified
Teagues at Havre De Grace, and all the
Drooping and desponding Jacobites at home,
(all which are our present Arguments) are no unfit
Thesis for a Satyr; and as we dare promise you
that the Management is not alltogether inferiour
to the Subject, we hope we have endeavour'd your
Pleasure and our Profit.
