To the most reuerend Father  God his singuler good Lord, Iohn  the prouidence of God Archbi∣shop of Canterburie, Primate of all England, & Metropolitane, Thomas Bankes wi∣sheth and prayeth for continuall encrease of Gods mani∣fold graces.
MY verie good Lord, may it please your Grace to recognize, that as Cato the Cen∣sour, when he was as∣ked why he would not haue his picture solemnely erected (as others had) said, Hee would rather that men should maruel why he wanted that monu∣ment, then murmure because hee had it. So likewise haue I my selfe replied in this case, as most vnwilling to con∣descend
 to the Presse. Notwithstan∣ding, the sad importunitie of some learned wellwillers which tooke a li∣king of this Sermon, & the causelesse impatience of other some captious per∣sons, which did both stomake it, & o∣ther such sermons of mine, as ouer∣fraught with too too much eloquence (forsooth) have finally won me to sur∣render vp the copie herof out of mine owne custodie. The one instant cause (well I wote) argueth no lesse but that my obsequious affection hath ouer∣weighed my discretion, in that I haue tendered my friends desire more then mine own credit, by publishing this so slender a treatise: & the other cause that moued me, importeth no more but that I do rather securely insult o∣uer, then seriously sticke at the waspish indignation of the aduersaries, espe∣cially hauing now a fresh recommen∣ded this thing to their eies with bold∣nesse,
 which their eares afore could ardly brook with christian patience, and all because I rolled too much in any rhethorike, (say they) as though the nature of the sacred scriptures ould in no wise admit the seruiceable e of prophane sciences, no, not for eir better perspicuitie sake. This e thinkes) should be reputed as a radox amongst the best learned, & t is it canonized as a resolute truth  the generall decree of the inferiour t, which for the supply of some Arte d facultie they want, smothly pre∣nd a pettie zeale, and modestly with he Foxe say, they will eate no grapes. These be they, which whē they preach the word, (as oftentimes they do vn∣premeditate) haply catch mostraines by stouping too low, then others do by looking too high. As for me, whom they partly dislike & disfauor in this case, I appeale to them selues for their
 further indifferent sentence, touching this my Sermon preached, and now vnworthely vnder your most graci∣ous protection published. Which al∣beit vntimely it seeme in respect of the authour thereof, and somewhat homely perchaunce in regard of the matter therein: yet being affianced vnder your good Lordships winges, and perused ouer without parcialitie, or preiudice, it may at times afforde the readers such seasonable and hole∣some lessons, as shalbe both easie for them to learne, & behouefull inough to liue thereafter. For neither is it in phrase so lofty, but that al through out may perceiue it, nor yet in matter so defectiue, but that some, I hope, a∣mongst all may select and single out some good thing which they haue ei∣ther not heard, forgotten or els neglected: The rifer knowledge, re∣membrance, and more liuely practise
 whereof may happely make for the ancement of Gods kingdome, and ir eternall saluation, which em∣ce it accordingly with a good con∣nce. For herein (so farre forth my poore Talent would extend)  I assaied to supplant such foule rfections, as doe now a daies o∣hrow and deface the whole bodie  beautie of Christian innocencie: ch enormities namely are these, ster curiossitie in iudging, Ser∣ne poison in malice bearing, and rlish illiberalitie in Almes gi∣. And these three malignant, ful, and mercilesse spirits, though aue sought to coniure them by one d one: yet doe they commonlie epe companie, and concurre all in e subiect. For wheresoeuer the estilent spirits of malice & malig∣itie do enrage, euen there at hand ttendeth alwaies the vnsauorie spi∣rite
 of vnmercifulnesse, insomuch as if we peaceably harbour one of these, the other two without nay say, will prease in after: and if on the other side wee put one to flight, the other two incontinent will bid vs farewell. Hauing therefore (I say) at the in∣stance of some for the behoofe of all, penned this Sermon as a meanes to suppresse and abolish these three noy∣some spirits: my humble sute and confident hope is, that it may and shalbe both fauourably protected vn∣der your Graces name, & fruitfullie perused of so manie as feare God, loue me, and fauour them selues aright. Which fortunate successe I commit o∣uer vnto the Almightie, who as hee hath largely enriched your Lord∣ship with manie singuler graces, & hath eke aduanced you on high in this his Church & common weale: so still doe I pray him graciousle to
 multiplie the same in you, with a long d prosperous preseruation of your erson and calling, and all for the better preferment of his name, and propagation of his glo∣rious Gospell.
