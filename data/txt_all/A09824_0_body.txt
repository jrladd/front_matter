MY especiall trust is, that your Honour will pardon my boldenesse, in making you patrone of this worke: which when I had caused my friende to collect, and translate out of sundrie approued Authors, and thought that it coulde not but generally delight all Noblemen and Gentlemen of this Realme, I weyghed with my selfe what perticular personage was meetest to be pre∣sented therewith: At length, remembring your Honor, and considering not onely what roume you are placed in, but also with what valiant and noble minde you are endowed: I chose you before others, being glad that I had
so fit a worke to dedicate vnto so worthie a Patrone. Beseching your Honor to accept of this signe of good will and loyall entēt. I need not commende the worthinesse of the worke, or the true setting downe of euerye Battell therein contained: eche Author hath his se∣uerall title where he is inserted, according to the course of the Historie, whose credit shall sufficientlye commende their Description. Wherefore I cease, wishing vnto you Galens health, Croesus wealth, and Naestors yeares, with increase of honour, and the at∣tainement of perfect felicitie.
