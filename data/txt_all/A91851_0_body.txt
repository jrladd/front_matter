Right Worshipful,
LEst the honour of your Worships patronage should contract a blemish by undertaking for and fixing on so mean an object as my self, I beseech your Worship think that most noble Physician Ri∣verius himself humbly prostrate at your Worships feet, and (as a stranger to this Climate) ambitious of your gracious protection. To present to your Worships favourable acceptance any thing which I dared call mine own, were highly presumptuous and injurious to so discerning an eye as yours, be∣ing conscious to my self of these superficial be∣sprinklings and that slender knowledge which is allowed me in Physick; as unseemly it were to of∣fer to your Worships view any one but this, or one so nobly learned as this Princely Physician Rive∣rius, who I hope will not be the less acceptable to your Worship for that he hath learned to speak
English. If these the first fruits of my undeserving endeavours may be cherished with the warm raies of your Worships favour, and defended against those stormes and winds with which puffing Cen∣surers may attempt to blast them, they may at length become more mature, and afford a sweeter and more pleasing relish to your Worships palate. I beseech your Worship pardon and accept this my humble boldness; and though I should acknow∣ledge my self very happy in your Worships per∣usal of these unpolished lines, yet that your Worship may never have occasion to use any thing in this or any other such treatise contained, is the real desire of
SIR,
