Most honour'd Sir!
THe Astrologers of this Age and I∣sland, swarm to You, as their Pa∣tron, (for shelter and protection of Themselves and Books) as Bees to their Hive. It is an Argument of
true Sapience (I confess) to lodge the choicest Jewels, in the Noblest Cabinets: And the Worthiest Sciences, fare always best, with the most Honourable Mecoenas. Such Policie I approve of, and (although, at some times, (by reason of Tortuous interposures) I could not, yet) shall now, follow. For, when after-Ages shall understand, that I have made, not the meanest Additions to this Celestial Study; It may reasonably put them into Admiration, if not Astonishment, not to finde me, set with∣in some convenient distance of your honoura∣ble Acquaintance and Favour.
'Tis true, in the twilight of Great Britains hope, and Restauration by his Sacred Majesty, [when it was a Crime, either to be known Loyal, or to own any one of that (then-despi∣sed) inclination and Judgement] I, with ano∣ther, did present unto You, An Emendation of the Learned Hartgil's Astronomical Tables; which Book, You were pleased generously, not onely to accept, and approve of, but nobly to encourage us, to a farther Enquiry into the Mysteries of that Science we had then espou∣sed.

But singly, have I never yet payd my Ac∣knowledgements, or the honour I owe, unto your exquisite Skill in all Mathematical, Her∣metical, and Physical Learning; your emi∣nent acquaintance with the Constitutions, Cu∣stoms, and Manners of our own, and forraign Nations; your Admirable Knowledge in the Law, Heraldry, &c. as also, in all Politiques and Ethicks: Be pleased (learned Sir) to accept it here.
I disdain to make you Patron of my Gall and Rudeness, as some (without a Blush) have lately done: or yet, to play the Parasite with You, and propound a Gain to my self, by this Undertaking. No: my Dedication of these few Sheets of Paper, proceeds (ex intimis Medullis) not from a Spurious, but Legiti∣mate honour and affection, and a desire to let the Learned, in times to come, know, That no Artist in this Age, had a more Cordial esteem for You, and your incomparable Vertues; or, could more readily acknowledge, your continu∣ed, and often-reiterated Favours, to the inge∣nious Students in all Learning, then He, who
assumes the boldness, (and accounts it his greatest Glory) to entitle himself
(Honoured Sir)
