SIR,
IT has long been a Custom with Authors to trouble their best Friends; for, who but friends will excuse so many Impertinen∣cies as are generally found in Dedications, and have their Names set as a Skreen betwixt our faults and the censures of the Criticks, who in this Age are so unmerciful, that they never spare the Poet for sake of the Patron, be he never so eminent or well qualify'd?
A second pretence, is a grateful acknowledment of favours re∣ceiv'd; but there Self-Interest advances under the Mask of Grati∣tude and good Manners, for our thanks seem rather invitations to new Benefits. To say truth, Poets choose Patrons for their Plays, with the same design that crafty Parents do able Godfathers for their Children.
The Reasons, Sir, why I shelter this under your Name, are, be∣cause your Affability, and singular good Disposition to all Mankind, enclines you not only to pardon Errors, but to confer Obligations, which you perform with that cheerfulness and courtesie, that whom you oblige you charm. Next, Sir, from the long acquaintance and vicinity of our Families and Relations, who ever held a fair and hap∣py Correspondence till the vicissitudes of time gave Interruption. Then let this tender of my respects and service to you, with this small trifle, receive and establish me in your Memory and Friendship, which is the aim and ambition of, Sir,
