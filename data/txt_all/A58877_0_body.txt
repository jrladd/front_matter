MADAM,
THE Allarums and Apprehensions which attend Ambition were wholly strangers unto me, before I was in∣stamed with the Passion of aspiring to lay something at your Ladyships Feet, as might be worthy of your acceptance. But when I medi∣tate the many Illustrious Qualities that conspire to the composing your Ladiships Character; When I meditate all the Glorys of your Birth and Ali∣ance, tho I am lost in the dazzling Contempla∣tion,

yet I streight grow sensible, there can be no Sacrifice worthy of the honour of your allow∣ance. Nevertheless being burried away by the rapid stream of the English Affections, I cannot forbear shewing my zeal in this Encounter, nor hold from falling in with the universal acclamations. For since the happy Vnion of two such great Fa∣milys, the whole Kingdom is fallen in Love with you, and with the highest respect adores those Charms that could be the occasion of so grateful and mighty a work, as to make the Ormonds and Hides as near in Bloud, as they were before in Greatness and Loyalty! All persons look up∣on you with joy, and promise themselves and their Posterity, a sure and continued happiness, when they think that by this Marriage, there will ne∣ver an Ossory be wanting in this Land to defend its Quiet, advance its Glory, and establish it too upon lasting Foundations. And some in the Extasies that are caused by these reflections, cry out, that it must needs please the Ghost, and if with Reverence to Heaven it may be safely said, add to the joys of that great Hero, whose less we all mourn and regret, when he looks down and assures himself, that from so beautiful a Body, adorn'd with a Mind so rich in Goodness, there must spring up a Noble Progeny, who will imitate the unparallel'd Vertues of their Ance∣stors, and propgate their Fame and Honour to

Eternity. All those who have been bless'd with your Ladyships sight and converse, do acknow∣ledge that you possess in a sovereign degree, all Accomplishments of Beauty and Vertue. You are the object of all Peoples admiration, and when they look up to you, they presently conclude, that Nature laid aside the care of the rest of your Sex, while she was employed in framing so many ex∣cellencies which she intended as her Masterpiece, and has not fail'd of her design. Every stroke she drew was with her most exact Skill, and when she had finish'd every Line and every Fea∣ture, she prided her self in her own Workmanship, and in a Transport, if I may say it, pronounced, That all was good, in the words of her own Creatour. And yet, as if Beauty was to be the least of your Ladyships Perfections, You, Madam, are no less admired for your Wit and for your Vertue, than for your outward advantages. So as that when we consider the Root from whence you spring; and reflect upon all those Great and Good Actions of Your Family, with the many instances your Ladyship has already given of a beni and generous disposition, we may for a while, think that it was impossible for you to be otherwise, and that all your Perfections were owing to your Extraction, and that you had on∣ly the Blessing of an Hereditary Goodness; but when we see that as you come up to a riper Age,

so you continue to despise and subdue all the Temptations which do constantly besiege Greatness, when we see that the nearer your Wit and Reason, as well as Beauty, approach to consummation, you redouble your Triumphs over the Vanities of Youth, and even in the blossom of Youth it self, put to despair all emulation of those who are far advanc'd in Years, we readily yield, that it is in Your La∣dyship, as well an act of Choice and Judg∣ment, as an Inclination to be Vertuous. Good∣ness it self is obliged to you, Madam; for you must endear it to all by so Charming an Ex∣ample, and be a means of promoting its Em∣pire in the World, when it is seen to have so Illustrious a Votary. But how large soever a Dominion this vast Scene of Beauty and Me∣rit may gain you in the Hearts of Mankind, there are many whom the reflection of all these ado∣rable Qualities does put into a kind of Conster∣nation. The Beauties of the Age, Madam, who are in possession of the Vogue; and dispute with one another the Sovereignty, are alarumed, and find they must all submit to your Ladyships Preagative, and their Empire decay according as you grow up. The Painters who are so ready to flatter even the best Faces, despair of ever being able to do you Justice. The Panegyrists too, who so abound in Incense, find they have none worthy to be offered to such a Shrine, and that it is impossible

for them to express the mighty Ideas which so glo∣rious a speculation does create. But notwithstand∣ing the defeat of the one, and want of Art and Capacity in the other, they all joyn in wishing you due Eulogies, and that all those great Genius's of Antiquity, who exhausted their Fancys in Fabulous Descriptions, were now revived and re-assembled for the making an ini∣mitable piece, by only Copying and imitating Na∣ture exactly in your Ladyship. But, Madam, amongst the general acclamations of the whole Kingdom, a Foreign Lady, the Darling and De∣light of the French Court begs admittance, a∣mongst the rest of your Votaries, to pay her Duty to your Ladyship, and implores your gracious ac∣ceptance of her Homage. Tho she appears not in her Native Dress, she is a Person of that Quali∣ty, so well bred, so Famous throughout all Eu∣rope for Chastity of Stile, innocence of Conversa∣tion, cleanness of Fancy, and solidity of Judg∣ment, in her several Elegant Writings, that for many Years she has been the Envy of the greatest Wits of the Age, and in one Composure carried the Garland from all the French Academy. Wherefore I hope, Madam, that so entertaining a Companion may obtain the honour of your Lady∣ships Protection and Acquaintance; and that being endued with such advantageous Talents, she may sometimes contribute to your Diversion, and

be a means of procuring Pardon for my taking this Occasion to declare the most profound Res∣pect, with which I am
Madam,
