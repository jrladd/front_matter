SIR,
I Am sorry I am put upon this unhappy necessity to mind you of your wonted religious and dutiful compliance to the Parliament of England; You have not lost a little in the esteem of godly men; A word in season, says So∣lomon, is like apples of gold in pictures of silver: I know very wel, you act not, but you suffer so much, and hand it when they have contrived it, that when God comes to cast out the Counsels of the wicked, and taketh the wise in their own craftiness, you wil hardly escape the danger, being found among the croud; these late carria∣ges, managed by Lieut. Gen. Cromwel and his Privy Counsel, do more then intimate a kind of repentance they have made an end of the Wars so soon; or, at least, to give this interpretation upon the former suc∣cesses, that it proceedes only from Gods meer mercy to the Kingdom, and not from any sincerity of their indeavors, they ran on, tis true, at first to gain a plause and a name as its very plain by the whole mana∣ging of the Wars, as wel as by these late Treasons, when ever they sent any, not of the right stamp, for this after Rebellion, they ever sent some when the danger was past, of the right faction, to take the honor of the service and success; and so they put all in print one after another, they could confide in, not wanting their Agents in London, even under pension on purpose to blaze their good services up and down the Kingdom, and having the advantage of your Excellencies favor, not seeing this deep layd design was able to cast out, blemish or crush all the orthodox and honest opposers, at least keep them low in the e∣steem of the people, and cry up themselves and their Faction as the only instruments God would use, thereby to gain the better advantage and esteem to carry on those desperate Designs of ordering or new∣molding the Parliament, which is nothing else but to subvert the Fundamental Laws of the Land, and destroy Religion, which your selves pretended to fight against, for the Parliament; all this while let
 not those successes God has given this Parliament, you have shattered in pieces, and in them to this Kingdom, puff you up: but know, that I know it to be true, that Major Gen. Skippon is the Father of that Army, and that most of you usurp the honor of many faithful, valiant Gentlmen of the House of Commons, besides those that you have cast forth of your Army, or could not in conscience stay any longer with you; besides many others that God made instrumental to the giving the Parliament the victory, which, if it be as you say, that they are not Godly, then must you conclude, it is his meer mercy to the Parliament and Kingdom, and not the worth of the Instruments, that is to be looked at in all your successes. Have you not rob'd of their honor, Manche∣ster, Brereton, Rossiter, Brown, Morgan, Massey, Birch, Poyntz, Wal∣ler, and many others? thank God, too many to recount; speak the truth, if any of them have not profest Religion, I am sure none of them have so dishonored Religion, as you have done: and what trea∣son you are now about, God only knows; but many think you cannot pass without the other purge, to the House of Commons, and to further curb the City? Do you not think that most of the Officers that act now in this design, would have trembled when they were first raised, to have entered into such an Engagement, and refu∣sed to obey the Parliaments Commands, and capitulate with them, and force them to send down Commissioners, to treat with you, as with an Enemy; and have required them to turn out their Mmbers, accuse them, and send the Lord Maior and Aldermen to pri on: whiles this unparaleld arbitrary power is unrepented, you wil remain under a cloud, and Englands peace and truth further indanger'd, as wil appear by this insuing Remonstrance; and could I be any way instrumental to obtain the righting the Freedom of Parliamnt, the flourishing of Religion, the setling of Peace, with his Majesties happy concurrence in all his Majesties three Kingdoms, with the sacrifice of my life, I beleeve I should find more comfort in death, then you with all your earthly prosperity, without repentance: Therefore be pleased either to exercise your authority for the vindication of the Parliament, or if you cannot oppose the faction, yet declare your dislike of those apo∣states, that they may not have the countenance of your Commission, which is the only sincere aim and indevor of
