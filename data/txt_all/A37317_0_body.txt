SIR,
THere is so much va∣riety in the Works of Nature attend∣ing the difference of Air and

soyle; that man the scope of whose Creation is to be an Admirer thereof, and to praise God therefore, cannot sufficiently effect what he was created for, but by travel∣ling, or at least, reading the Relations of those, whose af∣fairs either gave them occa∣sion, or permitted them to transport themselves on the places where those wonders are dayly seen. These con∣siderations, Sir, and your own incitements imboldned me, having read in Danish this Description of Feroe, where∣in many strange effects of Nature and odd customes

are described, to undertake its translation into English, That the Curious Inhabi∣tants of this Island might not be ignorant of a Coun∣try not far distant from them; which having now finished, many reasons make me presume to Dedicate it to your Favour; for though in the manner aforesaid, it can be but of little use unto you, that have with a dilli∣gent eye not only surveyed the most and best parts of Europe, but also perused most of these Relations that are extant of the whole world;





yet the many obliegements you have been pleased to put upon me, and my thankful∣ness for them, seem to vindi∣cate as a duty in my judge∣ment, what a more severe one will perhaps think an effect of my boldness, and a trou∣ble to you▪ Besides the Au∣thors person and Ingenuity being known unto you, it cannot but conciliate some authority to this Treatise; since you were beyond Sea, several times pleased to in∣vite him, and discourse about the Contents of his Book. Be pleased then, Sir, to ac∣cept

of this small  of my Gratitude, indulge some expressions that perhaps re∣tain something of their in∣nate plainness, and continue to favour, Sir,
