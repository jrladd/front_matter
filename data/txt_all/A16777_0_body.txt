IT is the general receiued
opinion amōg most men
that nothing is more o∣dious
in the sight of god
& good men, than vnthankfulnes.
And in deed, the trees & plants, &
the earth it selfe, which for the rain
and labour that is beestowed vpon
them, yeelde foorth fruite, shew
themselues thankfull. And therfore
I was so bold, (right Worshipfull)
hauing receiued many fauours at
your hands, that I might not seeme
to haue receiued them in vaine by
vnthanfulnesse, to offer vnto your
worships hands this little present

Greater men may easely offer grea¦ter
gifts. But if gifts may finde ac∣ceptance
according to the good
harts & minds of the giuer, I feare
not but this little gift, though small
in view, shall bee graciously accep∣ted?
both because the matter is pre¦cious,
& it proceedeth from a mind
as willing to shew it thankefull, as
whosoeuer els that commends him
selfe by a greater present. And so
wishing vnto your worshipful hus∣band
and your selfe, all hearts con¦tent
in this life, & euerlasting hap∣pines
in the life to come, humbly
take my leaue.
