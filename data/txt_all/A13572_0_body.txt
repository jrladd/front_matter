THe translation of this straunge and admirable discourse (right Hono∣rable and right Worshipfull) being committed to my trust, and I fin∣ding it in the French to bee com∣mended from Venice, to the most Christian King of France, as a mat∣ter of truth and absolute assurance: lest in his English attire he should wander vnregarded through the wor I was the bolder (in loue and humble dutie to o  generall) to make your names and titles the  ¦nance to his free passage, the same hauing bene  before, and sufficiently authorised: To tell yo  poore opinion of it were needlesse, because the m sufficiently commends it selfe, and in reading it  satisfie anie curious questioner: Onely my humble 

uest is, that my boldnesse to you may be held blame∣esse, and my poore goodwill accepted but in indiffe∣t worth. So shal I rest yours in anie greater employ∣ment, and remaine readie at all times with my verie vttermost seruice.
