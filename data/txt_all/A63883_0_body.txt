My Lord,
AS I show'd the just Deference I had and must ever have to your Lordship, and to all the worthy Governours of this great City, when upon the first Intimation of the Choice you had done me the favour to make of me, I was ready to serve your Devotions, so upon the signification of your pleasure, that I should publish this Discourse, tho' fitter for a Popular
 Audience, than for the Press, it would ill suit with the Office I have the Honouor to bear of Distributing the Royal Alms, should I any longer delay so slender a Contribution as This to the City-Charity, to be one of your Remembrancers, and Solicitors in that behalf.
My Lord, While I Exhort you to do what is not only your Duty but your Practice, I take the only course that is proper for One in my Station to Adorn you and yet not Flater you, nay to Commend you without any Complement; especially for your perpetual and most Loyal Care of the Publick Peace, which does so migh∣tily befriend all Publick Works of Charity, you that preserve it by duly Exercising your Au∣thority, tho' you are far from Affecting the style of Benefactors, yet you are such and more, in subordination to His Majesty; who as from His First Wonderful nd Happy Re∣stauration He may justly Wear That Glorious Title, The Repairer of the Breach. So upon the Late no less happy, and perhaps all things consider'd, no less wonderful Re-Establishment of the Government, and Re-Settlement of so many
 Disorder'd Corporations, He may be truly styled, The Restorr of Citys to dwell in: For a Great City grows an Inhospitable if not an In∣habitable Place, and may be properly called a Great Wilderness, when the Bonds of Civil Government, which is so absolutely Necessary to keep Humane Society together, are broken asun∣der: Your Names will be famous in our Story, who under God and the King, have been so In∣strumental in bringing back Excellent Order where Confusion, or which is all one, the Mul∣titude began to Reign: That it may please God to Prosper and Perfect all Your Honourable and Charitable Ʋndertakings is my Hearty Prayer.
My Lord,
