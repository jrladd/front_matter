THe Kings and Potentates of the Earth can make Men Great, but it is the Donation of Heaven that can render them Virtuous and Wise. Indeed 'tis Happy when these Embellish with some Rays of their Image, where God first Imprinted His own: Whereby what Affecti∣on they shew, or Honour they add to such Persons, Rebounds to the Original.

And this the King, who well Weighs the fitness of Men for the Charges He puts them in, Consi∣dered, when He made Choice of You, to serve His Majesty in the Creditable Stations,
Envoy Ex∣traordina∣ry to the Duke of Branden∣bargh. And Se∣cretary of State for the King∣dom of Scotland. and Honoura∣ble Offices You have undergone; In which great Trusts You Carried the same Sereness of Spirit and Affability of Address, which Ac∣company'd you in all Your Actings: And all, who have the Happiness to know You, will be so just, as to Attest your Honours altered not Your Temper: Nor have You Assumed an artificial Air of Be∣nignity or Humanity in Your pre∣sent Circumstances, as if You had formerly laid by these Ornaments with Your private Capacity; but You Exert them in every State and Condition, as the Natural Inseparable Qualities of Your
Gentile and Generous Dispositi∣on.
What the Prince of Moralists says, You confirm.
Seneca. That out∣ward Splendour, Pompous Cere∣monies and the other Pieces of Pageantry, which Attend those in Power, make up but the least Part of a Brave Man; for now when You stand Divested of those Honours, which were no less the Reward of Your Desert, than Marks of Your Prince's Favour; You retain that Stock of Merit, that Greatness of Mind, that No∣bleness of Soul which Heaven on∣ly bestows upon special Favourites: And none but Persons of Extra∣ordinary Geniuses still Possess in all Turns and Changes. And the Beams of Your Virtues are no no less Radiant when Separated from those external Accoutrements,
nor less impressive of Esteem, or Attractive of Love, from Wise and Discerning Persons. It is true, these Circumstantial Appennages may affect the Populace, and conciliate some Cringes, Submissions, and Courtship; in which there may be more of Fashion, Constraint and Policy, than of Sincerity, Ala∣crity or Affection; but the other Penetrate Hearts, Captivate Rea∣son, and Establish an Empire o∣ver the Souls even of the Better and more Refin'd sort of Man∣kind.
Hence, these of this kind who have the advantage of Your Ac∣quaintance, earnestly Covet the frequency of Your Converse; which could never be so Ardently desir'd by the Good, the Great, and the Ingenious of the City, Court and Countrey, if Your Prudence and
Complaisance, Your Acuteness of Spirit, and Debonairness of Hu∣mour, made it not Agreeable, A∣miable and Beneficial, Conjunct results of the other happy Mix∣tures: Neither of them to be met with so harmoniously Cement∣ed, but in Souls of no common Elevation; therefore, by all consi∣dering Persons, Honoured and Loved beyond the Ordinary.
For if either of these Qualities se∣parately found, be sufficient to raise the Reputation of some; What may we conclude, when we see them meet and and embrace each other in such a happy Ʋnion, whereby they Fortifie and Beau∣tifie one another by their Mutual Aid and Lustre; but that they shall prove secure Supporters of a growing Fame, and lasting Re∣nown. And if Nature had not
drawn the first Strokes, and laid, as we say, the ground-work of these Accomplishments in the Faculties of Your great Soul; Your Breed∣ing among Strangers and Foreign Embassies, though they have gi∣ven them a comely Tincture, yet could never make them go off with that Facility and taking Air, which speak them to be the Effects of Your Natural Temper, polish'd by the dextrous Improvement of Your Ingenuous Education.
It was by these Steps You made Your Ascent to the Illustrious Posts You passed through: And by the Favour of Providence You will persevere in the same course of Virtue; to the further Service of Your Prince, the Credit and Benefit of Your Country, to God's Glory, and Your Friends Comfort: Which none wishes
more sincerely, or Prays for more Fervently, than,
SIR,
