Reverend Fathers and Brethren,
DEdications of Books, and inscriptions of the names of men of worth and honour, are grown so common, that the plainest Truths and meanest Tracts discussing the same, cannot passe without them, and thereby a craved and enga∣ged patronage: if this small Tract of so plain a duty must seek any, for many considerable reasons, it
must seek you, and none but your selves, as its Patrons.
1. That the Author may hereby testifie to the world and your selvef his thankfull acknowledgement▪ os Gods great mercy to his Church, not only for your being in these times of envie and indignation at all Church order and authority; but also for your vigilancy over, and industry for the good of the Churches of God, eminently ap∣proved not only in your elaborate vindications of Government and Ministry, but also in your late grave, serious, and authoritative exhortation unto Catechizing; wherein by many pregnant and per∣swasive reasons, you do provoke Ministers as well as others to a du∣ty, the long neglect of which, with its sad effects, is to us in the sight of God and his Church, matter of shame and sorrow.

2. To you it is directed as authors of its resurrection, though not first being, though at my first coming into your City (in the pursuit of the duty) I did some years since preach it to the people of whom I had the inspection,
At James Garlick∣hithe. yet I had laid it by me as dead, and determined it should never see the light, nor sound in the ears of men any more; yet the sound of your exhorting trumpet put again life into it, and caused it to be preached to a more publick audience for the benefit of a much greater people, to all whose ears the sound not reaching, I was constrained to make it thus pub∣lick, that by reading what they should have heard, they might be convinced of, and counselled unto duty; and now it is cheerfully sub∣mitted to your censure, at whose command it was preached, though not the first yet the second time.

To you it comes in obedience to your command and conformity to your order, which requires an ac∣count to be given from the several Classes of what proceeding is made in the work of Catechizing, to which you exhort; let this small Tract assure you of the chear∣full submission of the meanest of your brethren to your exhortation, and full resolution to revive that ordinance of Catechizing, so ne∣cessary, usefull, and advantagious to the Church of God; prefessing that the greatest comfort that ever my soul enjoyed in all my mini∣steriall endevours amongst the people with whom I lately la∣boured,
James Garlick∣hithe. was in the instruction and (so far as I and others of their Chri∣stian acquaintance can judge) san∣ctification f some young men and young women, that did with con∣stancy and diligence, against all
discouragements submit unto and study their Catechism.
Lastly, To your patronage it is commended, for that your exhorta∣tion to the duty pressed in it, and pursued by it; gives the Author full assurance of your readinesse to patronize it, and by your power to protect it against the common car∣pers and cavillers at every truth and duty, with which our age a∣bounds, and with the clemency that becomes your assembly, indulge the infirmities of its author in the weak management of so weighty a matter.
Having given you the reasons of my boldnesse in this Dedicati∣on, I must crave leave to apolo∣gize in one thing, my not comply∣ing with your exhorting directi∣ons for carrying on the work of Catechizing: that is in respect
of the Form to be used, I doe not indeed use, nor have I put into the hands of my people the Catechisms of the late reverend Assembly, not that I do disown, or in any thing dislike those Forms, I sully assent to the Characters by you gi∣ven of them, and by which you commend them; but the form I have chosen and put into the hands of my people, is that of reverend Mr. Ball, the goodnesse, nay ac∣ceptablenesse of which, among peo∣ple is proclaimed by the very ma∣ny reiterated impressions of it; neither doth it differ in doctrine any thing, and in form not much from the Assemblies. The impulsive cause of my using this form was this, In the countrey where I lived this was the Catechism used in common, in the use of this I had by the blessing of God been con∣stant:
some that had learned this under my Ministry in the Countrey made mention of it amongst the people with whom I then laboured, in so much that they generally de∣sired this Catechism, and would admit no other: I condescending to their desire in a three years use of it, not only did the fame of it come to the ears, but many Cate∣chisms into the hands of this peo∣ple before your exhortation came abroad; so that I could not conve∣niently alter the form: herein I must beg, and cannot but hope, that none of my brethren will be offen∣ded or censure me as guilty of sin∣gularity, and the rather for that you cannot but all conclude by this Catechism,
Exhort. to Catech. youth may be taught who made them, why he made them, how good and happy man was made by God, how evill and
wretched he made himself, what need he had that the Lord Jesus should die for him, that the holy Ghost should regenerate him: what priviledges he doth enjoy and may expect by Christ, what duties he is obliged to by those priviledges, how he is to pre∣sent his petitions to God, how to receive the seals of Gods gra∣cious covenant; which being gran∣ted, I must expect your promise not too morosely to stand on circum∣stantial differences, where there is so fair an accord in material prin∣ciples.
Reverend Fathers and Bre∣thren, now that you have so seri∣ously and seasonably called unto Ca∣techizing, I could heartily wish, that confirmation of children, which I cannot but look on as an engage∣ment
to the study of the Catechism, were taken into your serious and se∣cond thoughts, and if found (as it hath been deemed) an Ordinance of God, some means were propounded for the reviving it in the Church: but herein I may seem too bold, and be thought to prescribe matter to your considerate debates: I shall therefore forbear any further to trouble you: but assure you that God will counsell you in things which concern his Church: make men in place and power a blessing to his Church: give to brethren a spirit of union with and con∣descansion to your just and pi∣ous resolves, and to our peo∣ple of ready and cheerfull sub∣mission to your exhortations and commands, and that not only be∣cause you exhort and command du∣ties, but also with the authority of
our Lord Jesus Christ, is and shall be the hearty and constant prayer of
Reverend Sirs,
