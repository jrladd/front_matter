My Lord,
THE Candor of your affections to these Ae∣sculapian Mysteries, by divers of my acquaintance frequently related unto me, together with the prompti∣tude of your Genius to those sublime and inestimable trea∣sures occulted in Spagirical o∣perations, Hermetically per∣formed, have pressed on my
presumption to this Dedica∣tory Epistle, without your Honors consent or licence first obtained. Horace had his Maecenas, and Virgil his Augustus; and it is the accu∣stomed manner of our mo∣dern Writers, alwaies to pal∣liate themselves under the Protection of some worthy Patron. I question not but that harmonious temper of your well-disposed nature will accept in good part the rash attempt of your well-meaning, and yet unknown servant. I confess it is un∣worthiness to stamp the im∣pression of your Honours Ti∣tle
upon such an abortive; and could I imagine the child in the future would become the least disparagement to the dignity of the Godfather, I would even now strangle it in the Cradle. Vouchsafe then (most gracious Lord) one smile from your serene coun∣tenance upon this tender In∣fant, cast out into the wilde world, ready to be devoured with the dupilicated teeth of Zoilian Sharks. The shadow of your Honours wings is the only Solace it can expect, to whose tuition I only com∣mit it for protection, humbly imploring your Lordships fa∣vourable
construction of this my incivility, I take leave, and rest

Pridie nonas Maii 1646.
