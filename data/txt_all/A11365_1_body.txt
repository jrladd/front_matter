RIght Honourable,
your gracious,
though vndeser∣ued
favours, in∣courage
me to present this
piece of the Iugurthine war,
to your most Noble hand, and
able Iudgement. The Royall
pen of Queene Elizabeth,
hath beene formerly Verst in
this Translation, but this being
like to herselfe, and too good
for the world, was neuer pu∣blished.
The subiect is high,
copious, and full of variety:
such are the sallies of the Au∣thours

wit, such his expressions
of language: both which are
so well suited together, that
without any Hyperbole or ex∣cesse
of speech, I may bold∣ly
say, if there be any diffe∣rence:
Materiam superabat
opus, the Worke-man-ship
exceeds the matter. If this
Worke may passe to publicke
view, thrugh the fauour of
your Patronage, the Labourer
thinks his indeuours recom∣penced
with a faire Haruest,
and will for euer remaine
