THe gladnes good men did show (right ho∣norable)
when God & our gracious Prince
placed the great seale in your hands, called
vp my muse that seldom sleepeth, to awa∣ken
the world with some verses, that vertu∣ous
men may consider of. They are but the
inuention of time, practise of pen, suffrance
of old custom, and the boldnes of a writer, that often salutes
men of great worth with bookes and blessednes, in the first en∣trie
of their worldly honor. This spoken to your L. as one to
whom the Lord of Lords (as I know) hath giuen great graces,
not onely to iudge well of good mens causes, (which prolongs
life) but likewise to answer the hope that great and good perso∣nages
haue in your L. And so being called to greatnes (a fortune
not common) great matter is exspected, and in iustice the full
effect of your greatnes shall be seene (I doubt not) bicause the
chosen and annointed of the Lord hath chosen you (among a
multitude) to sit in the charitable seat of iudgement, where pity
is a pleader, patience a hearer, mildnes a looker on, and mercy
is a iudge. Now the good report of the world (which I heare)
besides the good disposition in your owne mind are presently
come to make a proofe and daily triall of your vertues: so lea∣uing
your Lordship to the goodnes and grace of the almighty,
I humbly craue good acceptation of my simple plaine verses,
(that I call the Honor of the Law) written in a franke motion
of the good will I haue alwaies borne towards your honorable
good fortunes.
