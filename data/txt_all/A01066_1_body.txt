ANimated by the view of your manifolde vertues, (Right Ho∣nourable Ladie,) I haue presu∣med to shrowde this simple worke, vnder the Harbour of your protection, resting in confidence, your Honour will vouchsafe to accept the same, although not for the worthi∣nesse, yet for the well mea∣ning intent of the Writer; who in all dutie Dedicateth his endeuors, to deserue your Honourable fauour. Trusting your fauourable and prudent Censure, will extinguish the blemish of my ouer boldnesse: and your wisedome receiue with fauour, what is offered with affection
Pythias Apollo, reused not to drinke in woodden dishes: Alexander the great and mghtie Monarke disdained not to Trauell to visite simple Diogenes, in his Cell. Not the giftes value but the giuers good will, hath bene alwaies esteemed. Euen so I rest in hopefull assurance, that (of your owne Most Honourable and vertuous inclination to fauour Learning) you will

daine to take this small gyfte, proceeding from my heartie good will. Which I am bolde to present to your protection, thereby in some sort to expresse my humble dutie, which bin∣deth me to giue your worthinesse a farre better present then this, if my abilitie were correspondent.
The dutyfull regard I beare to your laudable gyfts, being such, that I am vnable (hauing no other meane) to expresse the same: Humbly beseeching your Honour to accept this gyft in place of a better; and my humble and dutifull mea∣ning, in steede of a better performance: And (according to your vertuous Bountie) vouchsafe to protect this Talent of my poore Labours, vnder the title of your Honourable Patronage. Which shall binde me to inuocate the Almigh∣tie, to indue your Noble minde with innumerable vertues, increase your Honours, inrich you with all blessings, and re∣ward you with eternall happinesse.
