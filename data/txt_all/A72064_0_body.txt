SIR, the place you haue for honour and armes, with my bounden duty together, haue mooued mee to dedicate to your Honor, this part of my labours: where∣in I bring you not a grape of mine owne planting, or a Pome-deroy, or a Musk∣million; but a posie of mine owne pick∣ing out of other mens gardens. My hope is, you will not looke into the meanenesse of my performance, but the merit of the subiect: wherein your selfe haue also labou∣red right nobly, and much more profitably would, if gentlemen as they bee true gentlemen, would become your true followers. To them I speake in this little treatise, and not to you, but learne of you. And so with all humility wishing you health and longer yeares, I take my leaue of your Lordship.
