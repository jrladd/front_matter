Worthy Sir,
I beg leave for these Discour∣ses to appear under the Au∣thority and Friendship of your Name, as containing in
them some general Remarks and Hints in Learning, which I suppose, may not be altogether unsuitable to your Genius, to your natural Inclination for varie∣ty of Thought with some De∣cency of Epression. The great∣est part of what I now present you, was the effort of my younger Years, and therefore may appear to some to contain more of the warmth of Temper and Ima∣gination, than of the cooler se∣renity
of Reason and Judg∣ment; to discover rather a wild Range in Learning, an Inno∣cent Revelling in Philosophy, than any mature Research into Principles, and the Cognizances of Truth; any compleat Victo∣ry, and Final Triumph over Au∣thors. But let the Opinions of Men be what they please, I hope they will not deter you from Pa∣tronising the success: Though in relation to this former Discourse,
I may without much Vanity pro∣mise you some security, since it has been already approved by much better Judges, than per∣haps are left to condemn it. I am now Sir retiring from the World, and that which always was its brightest Scene to me, your de∣lightful Conversation; and am therefore willing to leave you, and perhaps a few more of my Friends, some little Image, some faint Re∣membrance of me, in the Essays
of my younger Studies. I must confess, I have now another Tast of things than what I formerly had, partly my experience in the World, and partly the new Ferment of Humors in our Nation, having taken from me all the Remains of an Innocent Ambition. By the providence of God, and the free unconditionate generosity of that Noble and Loyal Patri∣ot, Sir John Norton, I am comfortably placed in an agreea∣ble
station in the Church; and am now passionately desirous to collect my self, to be known to few, to be envy'd by none: If ever I had any esteem among some, either through chance or the Conspiracy of Friends, I should now be glad to have my Name as Friendly neglected, as it was first raised; for I always accounted a great Reputation, and a great Infamy to be equal Afflictions; and the unknown
untalk'd of Man to be only Blest.
Yet though I am entring into the solid Peace and Contentment of pri∣vate life I leave you, Sir, engaged in the highest Sphere of Counsel and Action; but I leave you under a deep sence of the Interest and obligation of the best Reli∣gion in the World; a Religion, out of which no good and wise Subject of this Nation can be de∣sirous
to live, and in which even Repenting Atheists choose to Dye! I leave you also guarded with the Hereditary and chosen Principles of Loyalty and Ho∣nour, with all the Natural and Acquired Blessings of Temper and Improvement; especially, with that Law of Kindness in your Soul, legible even in the out∣ward characters of your Compo∣sure, which will hardly ever suf∣fer you to Err much, either in a
Publick or a Private Life; it being very difficult for a person of large Affections, of great Mo∣desty in Conversation, of sharp and quick Reflections in solita∣ry thought, ever to become Sedi∣tious in State, or Habitually loose in private Manners. And O! that such an amicable sweet∣ness of Disposition, as gently reigns through all your Actions and designs, were every where mingled with the Policy of our
Kingdom; and that the Wis∣dom of our great Assembly were every where temper'd with such an Healing Meekness! then Peace and Love, and Uni∣on might distil like Balm upon our Nation, then might we spee∣dily recover our Secular Glo∣ry to the Admiration and Ter∣ror of our Forreign Obser∣vers: then might we strike down our Errors in Religi∣on, as the Priests did hereto∣fore
the Sacrifices at the Al∣tar, not with the Hast and Fury of Anger and Revenge, but with that deliberate strength, that wise and so∣lemn delay, which proceeded wholly from a Conviction and Sense of Duty, and Devotion, then might our Magistracy go∣vern by Love, our Religion by Charity, and all our Poli∣cies unite into the Everlasting securities of Peace and Friend∣ship,
which is the hearty Pray∣er of him who desires to be known by no greater Title than that of,
