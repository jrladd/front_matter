TO many wee owe much, & to sundry their certayne due∣ties; to friends, kind∣red, clyents, neighbours; to in∣structors, & gouernors: but vnto our parentes we owe all; we owe our selues. Of which eminent pre∣rogatiue although Christians can not be ignorant, through the fre∣quent commendation thereof in the word of God, as which be∣ganne in the
Exod. 20, ten Commaunde∣mentes,
was by our
Math 15. Sauiours blessed mouth recommended; by
Ephes. 6. S. Paul noted to be the first Commaundement, hauing a pro∣mise thereunto annexed: so nei∣ther were the Heathens so desti∣tute of natures light, but that they alwayes held this as a high principle. The great reuerence of
3. Reg. 3. King Salomon towarde his mother, is to be read in the booke of Kings: and no lesse rare ex∣ample had the Gentiles of
Plut. Cle∣obis & Biton, who submitted their owne shoulders to the draw¦ing of their Mothers Chariot.
1. Tim. 5. And the Apostle expresly com∣maunded children to yeald re∣quitall vnto their aged parents; saying that it was acceptable & commendable in the sight of God so to doe. That same by way of Prouerbe drawne from the Storke, committed they to an e∣ternall
care and memory: glad∣ly also at all times reciting that memorable nature of this bird, which is,
Antipelar∣gein. that the younger fo∣streth againe the elder, of whome before he was fed and bred vp. Let this litle labour of mine be in some sort to play the Storke, al∣though in a contrary, yet most e∣quiualent sort of foode; such surely as in this time of my long absence from you wil be as acce∣ptable (I doubt not) to receiue, as it was gratefull to minister it; & shal prooue as cordiall in the vse, as it was paynefull in the com∣position. Liue you to God; who also preserue you.
