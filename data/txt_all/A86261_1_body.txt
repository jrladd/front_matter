Right Honourable and Right Worshipfull,
YOur constant Favours which I alwayes find,
Do me in all my best endeavours bind,
Upon all fair occasions, to expresse
My due and deeply bounden thankfullnesse,

Aswell for past as present sweet-Supplies,
Which from your blessed-House of Charities
Poore Orphant-cheering-brests, my-Self have found,
With Thousands-more, whom (else) distresse had drown'd
In over flowing floods of Poverty,
Our Parents poor being forc't from us to fly,
And leave us hopelesse Imps, in helplesse age
To all Earths woes, fully, on us to rage.
These, these (I say) indissoluble Tyes
Of ancient and of modern Courtesies,
Which to Heavens glory, here, memorate,
Doe me (blest Patrons) stirre and stimulate,
To dedicate and consecrate to You
What ere I am or can, as Tribute, due
To your full-Sea, from my small-Rivolet,
Thus to repay some part of my great debt:
And since I owe more then I know to pay,
My humble-All rests to my dying-day
