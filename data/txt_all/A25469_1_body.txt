SIR,
MY delay of this ill drawn Portrai∣ture is utterly inexcusable. I'll lie down therefore under the Censure of it, to be so long in tacking together so short a Story; which though it be true (and that is all the good that can be said of it, yet) 'tis pity such Truths should be exposed, so despicably naked, as to have no fashionable Ornament, to ren∣der it acceptable, some being first taken with the Dress, and that insinuates the Matter: To this I'll say not a word for my self, and but a few to the Subject. I am more than a Witness, how sollicitous you were in fitting your Brother for the Ministry; he came first into the World, but (I think) you were first in Christ: Pardon me for giving a hint of your Soul travel for his New birth. I cannot
 forget, how restless you were, till you had brought his troubled Soul to a well grounded Peace. Jer. 2.2. I remember (and Christ much more) the Kindness of your Youth, with what zeal you set out your Race: Go on, dear Sir, go on with a growing Vigor. It is not long since you thought to have been in Heaven before your Bro∣ther; but he hath got the start of you, and hath left you such an Example, which is more to you than to any one else in the World; follow him close (thô I hope you will come late to Heaven) in his Piety, Charity, and Usefulness all manner of ways; That none may com∣plain (his Ministerial Labours only ex∣cepted) that Mr. Thomas Brand is dead while Mr. John Brand lives; And, O that he may live in your Posterity, that you and yours may be the Blessed of the Lord from one Generation to another. So prays,
Dear Sir,
