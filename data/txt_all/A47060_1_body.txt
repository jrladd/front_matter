BEcause Magna Char. Printed in English, An.
1564. and bound up with other Sta∣tutes at large (too Volumi∣nous, and costly for the generality to read, or buy) doth yield less profit than hath been long neces∣sary; I have presumed at the in∣stance of some, to Dedicate this Treatise to you all, as it concern∣eththe good of all that be, or would be good, & the hurt of none that have left any unhurt: where∣in you shall find so many Chap. of Mag. Char. Confir. Char. Art. super Char. and other Statutes at large, corroborating the same; and the L. C. Exposition there∣upon, with some Expostulations, and Queres of mine own, as I thought requisite, or convenient for these times. The rest of the Charter, concerning the Church, (yet unsetled) or the Kings Tenu∣res, (otherways disposed of) I have omitted as useless; desiring that thus much may prove useful to all undertakers of Reformati∣on, as well Martial, as Civil.
