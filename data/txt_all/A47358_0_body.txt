Right Honourable, &c.
YOu are now presented with my
larger Survey of Kent (pro∣mised
in my Epistle to my
late brief Survey of the same)
wherein (among severall
things) (I hope conducible
to the service of that Coun∣ty)
you will finde mention
of some memorable acts done, and offices of emi∣nent

trust borne, by severall of your Ancestors,
other remarkeable matters touching them, and
the Places of Habitation, and Interment of ma∣ny
of them. For the ready finding whereof, I
have added an Alphabeticall Table at the end of
this Tract. My Obligation of Gratitude to that
County (wherein I have had a comfortable sub∣sistence
for above Thirty five years last past,
and for some of them had the Honour to serve
the same) pressed me to this Taske (which be∣ing
finished) If it (in any sort) prove servicea∣ble
thereunto, I have what I aimed at; My
humble request is; That if herein any thing
be found (either by omission or alteration)
substantially or otherwise different from my a∣foresaid
former Survey, you would be pleased
to be informed, that the same happened by
reason of further or better information (tend∣ing
to more certaine truths) than formerly I had.
Those differencies, and the rectifying of the
same, are contained in a parcell of this Tract
(towards the end thereof) which I now added;
That thereby Correction may be made of my for∣mer
Survey, which will be more conveniently
portable (for ordinary use) than this. What
is found defective herein, be pleased not to im∣pute
to wilfull errour; But either to misappre∣hension,
or misinformation (both which I en∣deavoured
to avoid) And as to the distances of
Parishes (herein specified) be pleased to know

that I meane the same by a straight line from
Church to Church, taking the Station for the
view at Newenden, being the middle of the
South-side of the County, as they stand in
that best Map thereof extant, made by Ma∣ster
Phillip Symonson (sometime Resident there∣in)
which I the rather doubt not to call the best
for that (by comparing the same with o∣thers)
I finde it so to be; and the like Cha∣racter
(in effect) was long since set upon the
same, by that Learned, Judicious and Laborious
Gentleman, William Lambard, Esquire, whose
Monument of Piety and Charity, in this County
Directory to the peaceable Government of
the same, and painfull and able performance of
his Perambulation thereof, have rendred and will
perpetuate his Memory Famous. The last
whereof hath left very little matter of addition
(but much of imitation) both for my self, and all
others that shall succeed him in works of this
nature, which was the principall cause that I
endeavoured brevity herein, being unwilling
too far to lengthen this Tract with repetition of
what hath been better set forth by others,
though in works of this nature all ingenuous
persons know, much use must be made of the la∣bours
of our Predecessors. (There being no o∣ther
way to enable treating of matters long be∣fore
our being) Now that the Errata's of the
Presse may first be corrected by what is at the end

of this Tract (for that purpose) prepared, before
the Tract be read, and that (in reading the same)
other smaller errours of the Presse may also be
corrected, and that the passages herein may be
well weighed, before censured, and the veile of
love cast over what is (either in truth or in the
Readers conceit) defective, or mistaken, is the
humble desire of.
