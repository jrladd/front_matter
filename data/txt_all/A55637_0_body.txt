Madam,
PRay be pleas'd to accept of this small Present; but not as any the least requital, I beseech you, for the almost innumerable favours you have been pleas'd from time to time to conferr upon me; since I fear it can scarcely be call'd an Acknowlegment. In short, Madam, this short Treatise, is intended for public benefit in general,
but if it may, in the least measure, be serviceable or conducible towards the Preserving of your Ladiships Health, in particular, I have attain'd my Aim; and in an happy hour may then subscribe my self.
Madam,
