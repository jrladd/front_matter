MADAM,
YOur Commands for the ga∣thering of these sticks in∣to a Paggot, had sooner been obeyed, but intend∣ing to present you with my whole Vintage: I stai∣d till the latest Grapes were ripe, for here our Ladiship hath not onely all I have done, but all I ever mean to doe in this kind: Not but that I may defend the attempt I have made upon Poetrie by the examples (not to rouble you with Historie) of many wise, and orthie persons of our own times: as Sr. Phi∣ip Sidney, Sir Fra. Bacon, Cardinall Per∣on, the ablest of his Countrie-men; and the ormer Pope, who they say, instead of the
triple Crown, wore sometimes the Poets Ivie, as an ornament, perhaps of lesser weight, and trouble. But Madam, these Nightingales sung onely in the Spring, it was the diversion of their youth. As Ladies learn to sing and play when they are Children, what they forget when they are women; The resemblance holds further: for as you quit the Lute the sooner, because the posture is suspected to draw the body awry: so this is not alwayes practised without some villany to the mind, wresting it from present occasions, and accustoming us to a Still somewhat removed from common use. But that you may not think his case deplora∣ble, who had made verses: we are told that Tully (the greatest wit among the Romans) was once sick of this disease, and yet recovered so well▪ that of almost as bad a Poet as your Servant, he became the most perfect Oratour
in the world. So that not so much to have made verses, as not to give over in time, leaves a man without excuse: the former pre∣senting us with an opportunity at least of do∣ing wisely: that is to conceale those we have made, which I shall yet doe, if my humble re∣quest may be of as much force with your La∣diship, as your Commands have been with me; Madam, I onely whisper these in your ears: if you publish them, they are your own, and therefore as you apprehend the reproach of a Wit, and a Poet, cast them into the fire, or if they come where green boughs are in the Chimney, with the help of your faire friends, (for thus bound, it will be to hard a taske for your hāds alone) to tearethem in pieces, where∣in you shall honour me with the fate of Or∣pheus, for so his Poems, whereof we onely heare the forme (not his limbs as the storie
will have it) I suppose were scattered by the Thracian Dames. Here Madam I might take an opportunitie to Celebrate your vertues, and to instruct you how unhâppie you are, in that you know not who you are: How much you excell the most excellent of your own: And how much you amaze the least inclined to wonder of our Sex. But as they will be apt to take your Ladiship for a Roman name: So would they believe that I indeavoured the Character of a perfect Nimph, worshipt an Image of my own making, and Dedicated this to the Ladie of the brain, not of the heart of your Ladiships most humble servant,
