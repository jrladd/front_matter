To much enobled Wingfeild my Magnifique
Moecena's, and The Worthies who designe
Stanfordian Celebrates of Meets, munifique
Accommodates to animate th'Ensigne
Of Englands Patron great, for royall Standard
To th'Rendezvous of their endear'd Reguad;

CAn it bee conceiued (Honorable and gen∣tile Spirits of ingenu∣ous magnificence) that the yet continued Fame that the first Brittish Bowers for the Muses were built vpon the bancks of Welland, sprung meerely from the bold Fiction of a Phanatique idle Braine? Must it be ad∣mitted that the bright Pillar of such a flame could with so long-lasting du∣rance towre-vp from an empty Fur∣nace,

that neuer was fraught with the foizon, nor euer felt the feruor of sub∣stantiall fewell? Shall meere coniec∣ture make slight the authoritie of yet extant Records (Chronique writ and Aulique foundation) contesting that A∣pollos Daughters honoured Stanfordian Cells with theit Mayden-immurage and first residence in this Isle, long be∣fore the Northerne Academiques (falne by discision from the Southerne, and flitting from the Occidentall to the Ori∣entall Foord) seconded their setling here, in their endeared Reflex to the former? Howsoeuer, whether the first foundation were dissolued through Malingene or no, Townes, Honours, and Times, we see, haue their Tides, Turnes and Periods: the Muses by Regal] writ commanded to be banned and reman∣ded to their forsaken Foord, this their deare Delight, thus depriued of their Cordiall Musicke, and after demolisht by Mauors (maugre Castle and begir∣ting

Wall) could neuer yet lift-vp her obrute head from vnder the heauy rub∣bish of ruinate depressure, threatning her with obscuring pouerty to interre Ancient Renowne in eternall obliuion. Such yet is the accommodation of the place, both for action and contempla∣tion, as may well induce present times and posterity to approue of the attests of Antiquity, touching the affections of the Camaenae caught with the ameni∣tie of the site of this Towne, within whose confines Six Couents of Mona∣stiques, for the singular salubrity of the Soile, Water, and Aire, chose their Cels of commorance. Yea Nature her selfe, hauing moulded this Plat-forme for ends of more eminence, than yet are seene to succeed her ordinance, breathes forth incessant close murmu∣rings against the iniurious neglect of in∣considerate or slow-footed Fate, that this Center to so sweet a Country (stel∣lified with so many magnifique Edi∣fices

and Towrie Structures) so accom∣modate for Nauigation (of Import and Export) and affluence of concourse, should not be honoured with the right of a Portable Riuer for Mart, and of an Act for Shire-Towne to competent ex∣tents, and to incompasse Rotell. For matter of Exercise and pleasurable Re∣creations, and of Chase and VVing, in such sweet mixt Earths, interlaced with Brookes and fordible Riuers, Heath, Forrest, Light Tilths, large Champaine variegated with coole shades of some scattered Woods and gentle-rising Hils of Easie Climbe to Plaines of no redious dimensions, leading ouer delightfull Downs, shallow Dales & Valleys of ex∣tended discents secure from break-neck precipitatiō, it affords such variety of ve∣nerable venarie (date veniam verbis) to aggrate and satiate the eager quest of the most ranging appetite, that Horse, Hound and Hawke hardly find any place to parallel this Plot in the diuerse par∣ticulars

of Race, Game and poursuit, viz, Hare, Deere, Fox, Otter; Partridge, Phe∣sant, Mallard, Heren and his Prey. The noble consideration and iust prizing of the premisses, hath inuited and stirred-vp the magnifique thoughts of many Honourable Personages to endeare this Place, and by sundry wayes and means to endeuour its readuance to Repute, suiting in some reasonable sort with its true deseruing worth. Amongst which laudable purposes, I must euer magnifie your munifique noble Aymes of ma∣king Stanford the Rendezuous to the frequent confluence of good company, with your gracious reflect vpon my great Disbursments (ouer and aboue the Magnificent Bounty of euer-hono∣red Exeter) to gratifie all friends with contentfull intertaine, and vpon in∣iurious exposure to vniust sufferings, in my wel-willing to the weale of Towne and Country, by deepe wading in the Nauigation of Welland, which is long

since (through credulity of some super∣intendents, permitting vnseasoned and improuident Agents, without controll to abuse Noble Intentions, and burie bounteous contributes in ill-pondred pursuit of fond addle Plots) cast into a profound Sleepe. A Sleepe wherein deepe wronged Welland is like to wal∣low and lye forlorne (howsoeuer be∣wailed) till some ingenuous Mercuriall Hand, with the quickning Spirit of a Golden Elixir (more potent than the Care-charming Caduceus) discusse her soporiferous Spirits, rouze and raise-vp her torpid head, and right her rude dissheueld Locks, which shut forth the Sunne beames of Beautie, Life, and Action, from giuing bright splendor to deserued renowne. Which good ef∣fect of wished Cre and Cure hoping propitious Heauens will in due time maturely produce with other helpes of happy consequence, I haste to the Me∣dique part of Panala, with intension of

the Dietetique, if, by Dignostiques of the Relish of this, I conceiue any hope of dispensing that Composition, to please the palate of such Worthies, my euer honoured Patrons: to whose no∣ble magnificence, desiring the indul∣gent fauour to be deuoted a most zea∣lous and obliged Seruitour, I rest
