MAy it please your Hon.
The obseruation which this world begets, may teach experience truly to report, that Loue and Charity are for the most part grovvne so cold, e∣uen in the hotest Sun-shine of our Profession, as that despised Pouertie, though addicted to the Religious exercise of endeuors cōmen∣dable, is in the best employment (vvhich seemes vvith greatest Fauor to smile vpon his Hope) so coldly recompenced, as that poore vnpitied deiected miserable Pouertie knovves neither Meanes nor Place hovv or vvhere to vvarme it selfe.

Vnhappie I, in this best time of greatest happines, who being as I am a Poore dispi∣sed, hated, scorned, and vnrespected Souldier so vnfortunate as no commended meanes, though many vsed, with confirmation both of loue and Loyaltie, can bee of power from dispayres Gulfe, to raise a Spirit drowned, in worst of misery: but were I not indeered vnto those by heauen made mine, who are indeed, to me, thē life, more deare from whō there is no way to run, vnlesse in me, selfe be∣ing be disolued, I would assuredly by hea∣uens assistance in some honest War vvith vse of Armes, giue to my life so long as I should liue, a liuing maintenance: but novv Immu∣red in my natiue home, vnseperably Yoakt vvith leane-fac't pouertie. I haue experience to conclude that as it is most certaine Pax procreat Bellum, so is it no lesse true, that a coufirmed Peace, Non amat Fillios belli, vntill she hath need of them.
In this estate not knowing how to mēd my selfe, Religions Lawe shall make my re∣solution honest, & though Rerum conditio∣nem mutare non possum, yet I will haue power to say Hoc possum magnum sumere animam et viro forti dignum, with patience therefore
shal my grieued thoghts ioyfully be thrown vpō my makers prouidēce by whose assist∣ance I will still resolue vvith a constant Bo∣sōe to persist in the prosecution of commen∣ded deedes, for this I knovv Spes mea, Christo viuens, Est viuere vt semper viuam.
And thus, my Honorable Lord, hauing breathed forth a sight vnto the grace of your compassionate respect: I humbly craue your Honor vvill vouchsafe, to patronize in this little booke (by me collected) not my ovvne but the vvords of that reuerend and learned Judge, the Lord Coke, vvho at his coming to Norwich, did at the Assises there vpon the bench, deliuer a charge so exelent as that it vvorthyly deserues to bee continued in per∣petuall memorie, vvhich being thus produ∣sed to a publique vievv, I hope it shall vnto our Publickeweale remaine a vvorthy prese∣dent, vvherein Romes champions may vvith shame decerne their long continued shame∣full practices, Puritans & Sismatickes learne to knovve vvith vvhat Iniustice they di∣sturbe the happinesse of our most hap∣pie peace, our Iustices, inferior officers, Iu∣rors, and Commons generally, may in this booke find out commended documents, and instructiōs profitable as vvel directing hovv
to gouern as to be gouerned: all which par∣ticulars the learned Iudge hath wisely hādled with such plausible Oratorical wisedomes e∣loquence, as that vvhen I heard him speake, I though the Poet had iust cause to say, Pros∣pera lux orritur linguis{que} animis{que} fauete: Nam dicendà bono sunt bona verba die. If therefore in this follovving vvorke my Memory hath giuen a true instruction to my pen, I hope my labour shalbe accoūted profitable, when it administers a publique benefit.
Thus Right Hon. Earle, vvhat I haue here∣in performed, together vvith my most vn∣vvorthy selfe, I humbly referre vnto your Honoured vvisedomes consideratiō, remai∣ning as I vvill alvvayes rest,
