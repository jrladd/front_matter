'TIS necessary that I inform you, That this Ephemeris is the Product of some spare Hours; and if it prove any way advantagious to my Friends, the Inhabitants of Norwich, I shall look on my self as amply satisfied by their kind Accepta∣tion. 'Tis with the Encouragement of some of them that I have thus far adventured to expose my Name, and, I hope, from the Encouragement of the rest, I shall have no occasion given me to repent my Under∣taking. And I have this to say in my own Vindi∣cation, That it was not Ambition moved me to it, but purely a Desire of doing my Countrymen a Piece of Service. The Study of Astrology hath been very De∣lightful and Diverting to me; and since I have made so considerable a Progress in it, I could not but pre∣sent my Country with the Effects. You have here a very copious Almanack, as you find by the Title, and a very plain, as you may find by its use; however, if it is acceptable, and I find further Encouragement by the Sale, I shall next Year present you with the Second Edition, which shall be corrected, and have several Additions, which the Shortness of the Time now would not admit.
Vale.
