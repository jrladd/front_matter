May it please your Lordships,
THE enclosed Paper is designed to de∣tect the True, but Latent Causes and Occasions of a great Abuse very com∣mon and notorious in this City of London, and of very pernicious consequence throughout the whole Kingdom; to shew the Iniquity and Ʋnreasonableness of certain false Principles and Opinions which support it; and for a check to the Abuse and Encouragement to such as
need Relief to, shew how by our Laws effe∣ctual Remedy may be given without any spe∣cial New Act of Parliament. For the Abuse is such, and so common and notorious, that di∣vers Parliament-men have thought it worthy of a special Act of Parliament to restrain it. But if effectual Remedy may be had without it, it is presum'd, that that will be more Honoura∣ble for our Laws, and therefore that the tender of it to the consideration of your Lordships will be no ungrateful Service. It is also hoped, that the Approbation of it by your Lordships Autho∣rity, will not only give Life to the Remedy herein mentioned, but even of it self, give great Check to such Abuses.
