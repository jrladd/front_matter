MADAM,
THE Reverend Authour of
this Life in his Dedication
to his most Christian Ma∣jesty,
affirms, that France was ow∣ing
for him to the intercession of
St. Francis Xavier. That Ann of
Austria, his Mother, after twenty
years of barrenness, had recourse
to Heaven by her fervent Prayers,
to draw down that blessing, and
address'd her devotions in a par∣ticular
manner, to this holy A∣postle
of the Indies. I know not,

Madam, whether I may presume
to tell the World, that your MA∣IESY
has chosen this great Saint
for one of your Coelestial Pa∣trons,
tho' I am sure you will
never be asham'd of owning so
glorious an Intercessor; not e∣ven
in a Countrey, where the
Doctrine of the holy Church is
question'd, and those religious
Addresses ridicul'd. Your MA∣IESTY,
I doubt not, has the in∣ward
satisfaction of knowing,
that such pious Prayers have not
been unprofitable to you, and
the Nation may one day come
to understand, how happy it
will be for them to have a Son
of Prayers ruling over them. Not
that we are wholly to depend on
this particular Blessing, as a thing
of certainty, though we hope,
and pray for its continuance. The
ways of Divine Providence are

incomprehensible, and we know
not in what times, or by what
methods, God will restore his
Church in England, or what farther
tryals and afflictions we are yet
to undergo. Onely this we know,
that if a Religion be of God, it
can never fail, but the acceptable
time we must patiently expect,
and endeavour by our lives not
to undeserve. I am sure if we take
the example of our Soveraigns, we
shall place our confidence in God
alone: we shall be assiduous in
our devotions, moderate in our
expectations, humble in our car∣riage,
and forgiving of our Ene∣mies.
All other Panegyricks I
purposely omit; but those of
Christianity are such, that neither
your MAIESTY, nor my Royal
MASTER need be ashm'd of
them, because their commemo∣ration
is instructive to your Sub∣jects.

We may be allow'd, Ma∣dam,
to praise Almighty God for
making us happy by your means,
without suspicion of flattery; and
the meanest Subject has the pri∣viledge
of joyning his thanksgi∣ving
with his Soveraigns, where
his happiness is equally concern'd.
May it not be permitted me to
add, that to be remember'd, and
celebrated in after Ages, as the
chosen Vessel, by which it has
pleas'd the Almighty goodness to
transmit so great a blessing to
these Nations, is a secret satisfa∣ction,
which is not forbidden you
to take; the blessings of your
People are a prelibation of the
Joys in Heaven, and a lawful
ambition here on earth.
Your MAIESTY is autho∣ris'd
by the greatest example of
a Mother, to rejoyce in a pro∣mis'd

Son. The Blessed Virgin
was not without as great a pro∣portion
of joy, as Humanity could
bear, when she answer'd the Sa∣lutation
of the Angel in expres∣sions,
which seem'd to unite the
contradicting terms of calmness,
and of transport. Be it to thy
Hand-Maid, according to thy word.
'Tis difficult for me to leave
this Subject, but more difficult
to pursue it as I ought; neither
must I presume to detain your
MAIESTY by a long Address.
The Life of Saint Francis Xavier,
after it had been written by se∣veral
Authours in the Spanish and
Portuguese, and by the Famous
Padre Bartoli in the Italian tongue,
came out at length in French, by
the celebrated Pen of Father Bo∣hours,
from whom I have Transla∣ted
it, and humbly crave leave to

Dedicate it to Your Patronage.
I question not but it will under∣go
the censure of those men, who
teach the People that Miracles are
ceas'd. Yet there are, I presume,
a sober party of the Protestants,
and even of the most learn'd a∣mong
them, who being convinc'd
by the concurring testimonies of
the last Age, by the suffrages of
whole Nations in the Indies, and
Iapan, and by the severe scruti∣nies
that were made before the
Act of Canonization, will not
dispute the truth of most matters
of Fact as they are here related;
nay, some may be Ingenuous e∣nough
to own freely that to pro∣pagate
the Faith amongst Infidels
and Heathens, such miraculous
operations are as necessary now in
those benighted Regions, as when
the Christian Doctrine was first
planted by our Blessed Saviour
and his Apostles.

The honouroble Testimonies
which are cited by my Author,
just before the conclusion of his
Work, and one of them in parti∣cular
from a learn'd Divine of the
Church of England, though they
slur over the mention of his Mi∣racles,
in obscure and general
terms, yet are full of Veneration
for his Person. Farther than this
I think it needless to prepossess a
Reader; let him judge sincerely,
according to the Merits of the
Cause, and the Sanctity of his Life,
of whom such wonders are rela∣ted,
and attested with such Clouds
of Witnesses: For an impartial
man cannot but of himself consi∣der
the Honour of God in the
publication of his Gospel, the
Salvation of Souls, and the Con∣version
of Kingdoms, which fol∣low'd
from those Miracles; the

effects of which remain in many
of them to this day.
But that it is not lawful for me
to trespass so far on the Patience
of Your Majesty, I shou'd rather
enlarge on a particular Reflection,
which I made in my Translation
of this Book, namely, That the
Instructions of the Saint, which
are copied from his own Writings,
are so admirably useful, so holy,
and so wonderfully efficacious,
that they seem to be little less than
the product of an immediate In∣spiration.
So much excellent
matter is crowded into so small a
compass, that almost every Para∣graph
contains the value of a Ser∣mon.
The nourishment is so
strong, that it requires but little
to be taken at a time. Where he
exhorts, there is not an expression,
but what is glowing with the love

of God; where he directs a Mis∣sioner,
or gives Instructions to a
Substitute, We can scarcely have
a less Idea than of a Saint Paul,
advising a imothy or a Titus.
Where he writes into Europe, he
inspires his Ardour into Soveraign
Princes, and seems with the Spi∣rit
of his Devotion, even to burn
his Collegues at the distance of the
Indies.
But, Madam, I consider that
nothing I can say, is worthy to
detain You longer from the per∣usal
of this Book, in which all
things are excellent, excepting
only the meanness of my perfor∣mance
in the Translation. Such
as it is, be pleas'd with Your in∣born
goodness to accept it, with
the offer of my unworthy Prayers
for the lasting happiness of my
Gracious Soveraign, for Your

own Life and Prosperity, toge∣gether
with the Preservation of
the Son of Prayers, and the farther
encrease of the Royal Family; All
which Blessings are continually
implor'd from Heaven, by,
MADAM;
