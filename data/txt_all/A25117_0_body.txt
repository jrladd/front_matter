SIR,
WHEN I consider the Tem∣per of your Mind, the ma∣nifest sincerity of your de∣tment, and your ardent Affection  the Peace and Prosperity of the ngdom: I cannot wonder that so ch real Worth should purchase you general Esteem and Love in the asts of all your Acquaintance; d procure you a Right to a Seat  one of the greatest Councils that this day in the Christian World. nd tho' that inestimable Modesty hich clearly appears in your dispo∣ion and converse, restrains me from

speaking all that I think; yet si I cannot think out all that you serve; an utter silence would be less unpardonable, than Flattery detestable: The World knows h to place you in the Catalogue of ¦triots, whose Merits transcend th years, whose Manners are exemp¦ry to their Superiours, and shed broad profitable influences upon degrees, and whose Honour ra the Emulation of aspiring Spir▪ Had I not a sure perswasion of y Goodness and Candour, I could  presume to send so poor a Pre as this to your hands, or desire t it may find a quiet repose under umbrage of your Favour. My sn acquaintance with you, hath enr¦ed me with plentiful demonstrati of your great Vertue, and incou¦ged me to offer this minute Trac wait upon you, as being agreeabl your habitual inclination to the p¦lick good. I cannot think, that ¦ther the composure thereof, or

le is worthy of your acceptance, approbation: For when I reflect on the form, and contexture of my scourse, I have some cause to sus∣ct, that it is not so correct, or methodically contrived, but that may be liable to censure; and I have  mind to put the uneasie trouble on you of sheltering my imperse∣on with your Patronage. But be∣g sufficiently conscious to the cur∣at of my well directed intention, hich is to save honest men from eats and Dangers, and to tender em my charirable advice for their ety and peace. I do not doubt ur favourable construction of the tter and design of it: Which not ly for the rarity of the Argument, t the general usefulness thereof, y look for a valuable regard from  who can but breath good wishes  the happiness of humane society; d expect a ready furtherance from ose, whose abilities have rendred em capable of Publick Communi∣cations,

and I know your publick Spirit can make a fair and reasonabl Apology for such a purpose, and you forward Charity can hide a multitud of the Authors infirmities, when th good meaning of his Labour is man¦fest to all Observers. And since I an many ways obliged to your Family I have no better occasion at presen to render my thankful acknowledg¦ment, than by presenting this wel meant Treatise to your disposal, as Token of that gratitude I ought to ex¦press and practice; and upon all op¦portunities must ever be performe by
Sir,
