THe tender labour of my wearie pen,
And doubtfull triall of my first-borne rimes,
Loaths to adorne the triumphs of those men,
Which hold the raines of fortune, and the times:
Only to thee, which art with ioy possest
Of the faire hill, where troupes of Poets band,
Where thou enthron'd with Laurell garlands blest,
Maist lift me vp with thy propitious hand;
I send this poëme, which for nought doth care,
But words for words, and loue for loue to share.


—nam{que} tu solebas
Meas esse aliquid putare nugas.
