Honoured Sirs,
IT being the great
designe of God the
Father to set up his
Son our Lord Jesus
Christ, as his King upon the
holy hill of Sion, and
(though the Heathen rage,
and the people imagine vain

things, saying, Come let us
break their bonds in sunder,
and cast away their cords
from us) to give him the
Heathen for his inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of
the earth for his possession.
I say, this being Gods design,
he hath for the effecting of it,
given all power and authori∣ty
in heaven and in earth in∣to
his hand, and accordingly
Jesus Christ hath undertaken
to execute all Gods Decrees,
which are mentioned in the
Prophesie of the Book of the

Revelation, where we finde
that God had decreed, that
for an appointed terme of
time, his Church, his Tem∣ple,
his Saints should be in
an afflicted, persecuted, de∣pressed,
low condition, and
that the Beast, and the Baby∣lonian
enemies of his Church
should have power to grow
great, and to flourish, and to
make war against the Saints,
and to blaspheme God, and
his name, and his Saints, for
an appointed time also, and
that after that time was ex∣pired,

that then Jesus Christ
should improve that power
that was for that end given to
him, in giving a glorious De∣liverance
to his Church, and
ruining totally the Beast,
great Babylon, and all his
enemies, That so the King∣domes
of this world may
become his Kingdoms, and
that in such a manner, as they
were not before, even so as all
that are in authority, that
will not cast their Crowns at
his feet, shall be broken in
peeces, for he the Lord alone

must be exalted in that day;
there must be one Lord, and
his name one in all the earth.
Now as it most clearly appears
to me from the divine Ora∣cles
of the Scripture, having
compared the works of God,
and his Word together, I
have in the ensuing Dis∣course
held it forth (for the
encouragement of all that
wait for the appearing of the
Lord Jesus Christ for the o∣verthrowing
of his enemies,
and the deliverance of his
people from their persecuti∣ons)

that the time is alrea∣dy
come, wherein the ap∣pointed
time of the prevail∣ing
power of the Beast o∣ver
the Saints, is come to
a period; and accordingly
Jesus Christ hath begunne
to bring downe the power
of the Beast, and to lift up
his Saints out of that low,
afflicted, persecuted con∣dition
in which they have
beene, and that in order
to the perfecting of these
things England is already
fallen from the mysticall

Babylon, Rome.
Now, Honoured Sir,
You having been glorious
Starres, shining with a
great deal of splendour in
Your Countrey both in the
publikenesse of Your spirits,
and the holinesse of Your
conversations, wherein You
have been eminent Exam∣ples,
and speciall encou∣ragements
unto others,
and knowing that it is the
desire of Your souls to see
the Lord Jesus alone ad∣vanced,
who-ever be thrown

down. I have presumed to
present this little Treatise
unto You, not doubting of
Your ingenuous and fa∣vourable
acceptance of it.
But though I publish it under
Your name and favour, yet
doe I not thereby desire You
to patronize any thing in it
(if there should be any thing)
that is not truth, and for the
truth that is in it, I need de∣sire
no Patron; For great is
the truth, and it will pre∣vail.
Yet notwithstanding
the sonnes of truth, as farre

as the truth appears to them
in truth will own it, and con∣tend
for it, and doubtlesse so
will You. I am
Sirs,
