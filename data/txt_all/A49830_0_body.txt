Madam,
HAD not your Ladiship desired a Sight of this plain Sermon, I
should scarce have assumed the Confidence to have presented it to
your perusal; but as I receive your desire as a Command, so your
favourable Acceptance will add weight and worth to it. If the witty Censurer
shall say, That I tell him nothing but what he knew lefore; I shall be
contented with it, and rejoyce that he was so well Instructed, and wish
also that he needed not a Re∣membrancer; howsoever, no man ought to be
offended, that Sermons are not like curious Inquiries after
New-nothings, but pursuances of Old Truths. I am very
sensible your Ladiship is furnished (from much more Learned
Physicians than I am) with very proper Receipts against the late cause of
your Sorrow; yet I hope (Madam) that this which I here present unto you, may
somewhat heighten and improve their efficacy: And in so doing, I shall
esteem it amongst those Blessings, with which God useth to reward
those good Intentions which himself first puts into our hearts, and then
recompences up∣on our heads. All Sermons are but Arguments a∣gainst
us, unless they make us quit our Mistakes, and suffer them in some
instance and degree to do the work of God upon our Souls. And the special
design of this here present (dedicated to your ho∣nourable Patronage and
Protection) is, to describe the greater Lines of our Duty, when our Faces are
bedew'd with Tears, and our Backs cloathed with Mourning: And whatsoever
rellish your La∣diship may find in the Comment, yet I am sure the Text,
being carefully laid up in your Religious Breast, will be sound,
wholesom, and consolatory; though what I have in much weakness perform'd
is only in Duty expressing the many and great Obli∣gations you daily renew
upon.
