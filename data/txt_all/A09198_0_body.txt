SIR, as to be excellent in anie skill is very rare, so the fauorers of excellencie are not euerie where to bee found, whom when by our good happe we find; I know not by what Sym∣pathy we are drawne to admire and honour them aboue all other creatures, as the Saints and Soueraignes of our affections and deui∣ces: few they are I confesse, and so few, that if by e∣uents fore-past we may iudge of things to come, I feare me ere many yeares, euen the most necessary Artes to our posterity erun posliminio reuocandae, so great a coldnesse hath benummed our times. I cannot much blame the Italian, though he accounts vs ull, and other nations, that haue the wit to worke vpon our idlenesse, which I can impute to none o∣ther cause, then the want of incouragement from the better sort. Our countrymen being as happy in their inuention as the best stranger of them all.

For mine owne part, I hope I shall not be imagined to speake as Demetrius did for his siluer Images, as gaining ought heereby, since by profession I am a Scholler. Onely I am sory that our courtiers and great personages must seeke farre and neere for some Dutchman or Italian to draw their pictures, and in∣uent their deuises, our Englishmen being held for Vaunients. To which end as wel for their sakes who are as yet yong practitioners, as in regard of many yong Gentlemen in this Kingdome, who being naturally inclined hereunto, want fit directions to the attai∣ning of this commendable skill, so many waies ne∣cessarie, (fauoured in times past of the greatest Mo∣narches, and of late daies practised euen by Princes, and the greatest personages themselues, as Francis the first, king of France, Charls Emanuel Duke of Sauoy, with many others who are reported to haue beene excellent with the pencill) I haue drawne and colle∣cted together the most true and easie grounds of drawing, mingling and ordering all maner of water colours for limming, certaine obseruatiōs for perspe∣ctiue and the light, the manner of annealing in glasse &c. together with a short discourse of Armory, all which togither with my selfe (in regard as wel of that dutie I owed to your selfe for many fauours towards me at your Chesham, as that you are generally known to be a principall fauourer of all skil and scholership) I offer vp vnto your censure, of whom most humbly I take my leaue from Richmond.
