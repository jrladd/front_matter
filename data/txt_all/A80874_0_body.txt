SIR,
AS I owe you my Thanks for the Honour you did me, in thinking me worthy to be imployed in so Publick a Service, as that to which this Discourse relates; so I think it would be more than a Venial Sin to offer such a violence to Gratitude, as to decline your Commands for the Publication of it. I will not therefore use any thing which may look like an Excuse, but instantly shew how inclinable I am to prefer your Judgment before my own; and beg leave to prefix your Name before that, which the Nature of the Subject, no less than the Obligations of the Preacher have made wholly yours. The chief design of the Sermon was to convince them that heard it, that our greatest Secu∣rity
 under Heaven is the Wisdom of our Laws, the vigorous Execution whereof, would remove those manifold Mischiefs, which the Relaxation of them hath bred, and will cherish among us. Your Eminent Loyalty is such, that I have good reason to believe you love the Sermon for the Sub∣jects sake; and if there be not also a Power in your Judgment to oblige others to have a good opinion of it, I shall account my self strong enough to abide their Censures, whilst I have you on my side; and en∣deavour to make my self the more valu∣able in the World by your Friendship; with the continuation whereof you can Ho∣nour none who puts a greater value upon it, and who is more sincerely, than I am,
Ripon, Aug. 7. 1676.
SIR,
