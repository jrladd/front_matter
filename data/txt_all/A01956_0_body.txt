RIght Honourable, my allegiance to the Almighty King necessitates my endeuours to glorify his Great Name. My Profession hath im∣posed on me all ministeriall seruices. My filiall dutie to our blessed Mother the Church, hath taught me to help forward her cause, both with tongue and penne. My thankfulnes to your Lo. tyes me to seeke your honourable authori∣sing of all these labours. They run to you first, as if they waited your manumission of them to the world. If bookes be our children, and the masculine issue of our braines; then it is fit that your Lo. who haue the patronage of the father, should also vouchsafe a blessing to the childrē. Nor is this all: there is yet a weightier reason

why they should refuge themselues vnder your Los. protection. The world is quickly offended, if it be told of the offences: men study courses, & practise them; and if the Clergie find fault, yea if we doe not iustify and make good what they magnifie, & make common, they will be an∣gry. It is the most thanklesse seruice to tell men of their misdeeds. Now a busines so distastfull requires a worthy Patron: & whose Patronage should I desire but your Los. whose I am, and to whom I owe all duty & seruice? whose but your Los. who are in place to reforme vice, and to encourage goodnes: to make that practicall and exemplary, which is here onely theoricall and preceptory? God hath intrusted to your hands his Sword of Iustice: draw it in his defence a∣gainst the enemies of his Grace & Gospel. You sit at the common sterne, and therfore are not so much your owne as your Countreys. Helpe vs with your hands, we will helpe you with our prayers. The God of maiestie & mercy, sancti∣fie your heart, rectifie your hand, iustifie your soule, and lastly crowne your head with eter∣nall glory.
