Iohn Thorius wisheth increase of all Heroicall versues.

RIght Honourable: Plutarch hath writtē a tretise intituled . In which he sheweth how men may reap profite by their enemies. And forasmuch as thys booke was written to instruct those that are professed enemyes to our estate, I thought that we might reap some profite by them, if this theyr Sergeant Maior were as well knowen vnto our men as vnto them selues: and that, notsomuch for any poynts of pollicy which might be in their souldiers more then in ours, or for that I think them to haue more knowledge in matters concerninge warfare then our English warriers, who are no whit infe∣riour to any of them; as for that theyr orders being kno∣wen vnto vs, wee may the better and more easely hurte them and benefit our selues by reason of this aduantage. I haue therefore bestowed some pains in vnarming this Spanysh Sergeant and doffing his Castilian and hostile armour, and haue clothed him in English apparel, to the end that our men may vse him to theyr pleasure, and he finding him selfe metamorphosed, learne how to serue English men. Beseeching and desiring your Honor, that as in the fielde you wish to be the first to encounter, not with the stoutest Sergeant onely, but also with the bra∣uest Duke, Prince, or King, that professeth enmity a∣gainst
 yourselfe, your Prince, or your Countrey. So you wil at home vouchsafe to protect this SERGEANT MAIOR, who hauing now forsaken his owne Coun∣trey, matcheth not in the fielde in Spanishe colours, but walketh in London streetes in Englishe attyre. And I for my part shall thinke my selfe much bounden vnto your Honor, if you shall accept thys my labour as a signe of my good minde. Thus I leaue your Honor to your martiall meditations, beseeching God, that as our enemyes haue felte your valour, the lowe Countreys inioyed it, and England with an vniuersall voyce gene∣rally commended it, so it may please his deuine Maiesty to increase it, to the glory of his owne Honor, to the ter∣ror of your enemyes, and to the benefite of our Prince and Countrey.
