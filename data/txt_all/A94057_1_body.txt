THis Draft at once cry'd Up and Down amain
By divers men, up by the same again
At divers times, hath planely found thereby
That it hath censur'd been Tumultuously.
Twixt Actors and Spectators did appear
Small difference; and through a Jealous fear
The Scaffold play'd the Stage; to say't I'm loth,
Affection against Reason play'd in both.
Yet Reason at a neerer view gain'd sway,
The Censure ended just as doth the Play.
After this various Fate, because indeed
Of pleasing more then Four there was small heed,
From Court and Oxford home it comes to you,
Secure of Reason and Affection too.
You lent the Author; and tis therefore just
The work should yeeld you Tribute for your Trust:
If Friends make wits, and wit-wrights Poets be,
Then This is His, and He your Poetry.
