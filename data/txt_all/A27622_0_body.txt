My Lord,
I Have observed, The supreme Providence, hath Placed you in the most Eminent Magistracys of this Great City, in Two Extraordinary Years, Engraven upon with Illustri∣ous Appearances of his own Hand; Your Sherivalry, as I have been assured in the Year 88, The Year of the so Great Revolution in these Nations; and your Lordships Mayoral∣ty Enters in this Year of the Peace, and the so Grand Vi∣ctory of the Imperial Army over the Mahometan, Turkish Sig∣niory; and both so close together, and at a Time, as I ap∣prehend, well known to Prophecy: I have therefore thought it my Duty, Humbly to present the following Review of both
 to your Lordship, as in so High a Station, This so Great Year: And yet, If God hath Graciously led me into the te Interpretation of his Sure Word of Prophecy, This is but small in Comparison of your Authority, Extending it self into the much Greater Year 98; As I hope it will be found; In which your Sword shall be born before the Prince of Prin∣ces, the King of Kings and Lords of Lords, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth; I mean not in His Personal Appearance, as many either Ignorantly, or wilfully mistake; but in Re∣gard of the Glorious Manifestation of His Kingdom En∣tring its Succession; which will not Lessen but Aggrandize both Royal and Magistratical Honour, and Authority, that Kisses the Son, and does Homage to This Supreme; and will not in the least give Countenance to Anarchy, Confusion, or Resistance to that Ordinance of God by either Le ellism or Rebellion; but Conciliate the most Holy, Humble and Pious subjecti∣on to Authority so Enstamp'd from Heaven, as then it will be.
I have taken Notice by General Discourse; Your Lord∣ship in your Publick Attendance on the Worship of God, appears to Desire the Reconciliation of Protestants, whe∣ther under those undesirable, and, as too much mannaged, unkind distinctions of Episcopacy, Presbytery, or Congregati∣onal Union.
I hope, It is, as Falling out this Year, not without hap∣py Presages of that Blessed Philadelphian Church-State speedily about to enter; In which all such Names of differ∣ence will be lost in both the Purity and Love, that will over∣flow them in the Succession of that Kingdom; And as I have
 some Years ago Foretold; That the Cathedral of Pauls, (as we stile it) whose Loughty Pile, which Providence seems to have allowed the Preparation of, for the National Solemn Acknowledgments of God in the Peace, wherein your Lordship will bear such a Figure, shall yet, (I am perswad∣ed) speedily with those Names of Prelation and Prefidency in it, that have their only Basis in that Antiquity, wherein the Synagogue of Sathan began to have the Ascendency, and not in pure Scripture-Antiquity, Bow Themselves at the Feet of that Philadelphian State, and Acknowledge, Christ hath Loved and Chosen it; or else both the Prelacy and the Cathe∣drals will suffer Abrogation, and become useless;
There is one thing more, I Congratulate to your Lord∣ship this Year of your so eminent Magistracy in; And that is, An appearance of Zeal for the Retrenchment and Ex∣tirpation of open Prophaness, Irreligion, and Lewdness of Manners: I cannot but have an Honour for any such un∣dertaking, and beseech of God his presence with it, and Blessing upon it; So far as it bears, but a desire to prepare for, (if I may so allude) a Temple for God in the Nation; and I doubt not. It will have the assistance of your Authority, and other the Religious Participants of your Government; But yet I cannot but hope▪ Our Greater Solomon will be supreme in the Administraton, and Raise it much higher then Man can do.
My Lord▪ As to my self, I cannot claim any particular Knowledge of, or Interest in you; but looking upon your Magistracy in 88, and 98, as Honoured with a Prophetick∣ness, I have on that Account taken the boldness to In∣scribe your Name, and I do very humbly beseech your
 Patronage of this Review under its Great Patron, and the acceptance of this Dedication; Till it shall be able, as I hope, it will within few Months be, to Answer for it self to all that shall send to it or ask a Reason of its Hope; as owned by that Higher Patronage, publickly in the Eyes of all. In the mean time, as I most humbly beg the Prayers of all, who Love the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ; So my most Fer∣vent and Earnest upplications shall be for the Magistracy of this Great City, and their as Honourable Station in the King∣dom of Christ; and most particularly for your Lordship.

My Lord,
