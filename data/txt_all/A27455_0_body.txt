SIR,
THO' I have not the Honour of an Acquain∣tance with you, yet since I found your Name in the Printed Votes, as a Petitioner for Re∣dress, against the Warden of the Fleet, and that you were so great an Instance, of the Oppression which the Gentry of England, as well as the Tradesmen, and Commonalty, labour under; I presum'd to Affix your Name to these Papers, which I'm sure are wrote with no other Design, than to Advance the Publick Advantage, by endeavouring to Suppress a Nest of Pestilent Vipers, who have Stung, and been equally Pernicious, to all Ranks and Degrees of Men, except only those who have nothing to lose. The Riches of England consists in Land and Trade, which are the Pillars of the Government, and must be Maintained and Supported, but both are Wea∣kened, and Terribly Shaken, by the Defect in Exe∣cution of the Legal Process; Lands have lost their

Ancient Value, and do not Answer the Profits as formerly: For how many Knavish Tenants do con∣tinually decline to pay their Rents, or go off with good round Sums in their Pockets, and when their Landlords call 'em to Account, and fling 'em into the Country Gaol, the next News they hear, is of a Habeas Corpus, to Remove 'em to the King's-Bench or Fleet, and in a Fortnights time, down they come, and take another Farm next Hedge to their former Landlords. As for the City (where Trade does chiefly flourish) That Suffers infinitely more, for as Differences on Contracts and Bargains do arise, so there are more frequent Opportunities of Repairing to the Law for Satisfaction: And one would think that an honest Debt for Goods Sold and Deliver'd, should be Paid, but unless a Man will be a Law to himself, (which we can hardly hope for in this degenerate Age) there is no Mo∣ney to be had; the Creditor may Arrest him, and have Judgment against him, and Charge him in Execution; and what then? Why then he comes Abroad, and there's an end of the matter.
—pudet haec opprobia nobis
Et dici potuisse, & non potuisse refelli.
I ever thought that Trade had been the Darling of the English Nation, and shall we tamely see such Rapes▪ and Violences Committed on her, who ought certainly to be Cherished and Improved with all the Tenderness and Care imaginable? 'Twas the Policy of our Ancestors to respect her as the Guar∣dian-Angel of their Island; and shall the present Fathers of our Countrey now look on with Ʋnconcern? Can they behold these Horrid Violations, and not at all be mov'd! Certainly they can't Imagine but that such Wretched Treatment must mightily Discourage Trade: It can't but strike a Damp upon the Care∣ful Merchant, and the Industrious Tradesman, when they Consider, That after all their Pains and Se∣dulous Application, the Labours of some Years may all be lost in fewer Moments: For they are forc'd to seek Returns by Sale of their Commodities with reasonable Profit, and for this, Credit must neces∣sarily be given: Now if they happen to Trust a Knave, (as, modestly speaking, 'tis two to one but they do) their Prime Cost is also gone and sunk, for 'tis plain there's no Remedy to Recover it; what is this but a Stab into the very Heart of Trade? I'm told it was a regard to Trade which was one of the principal Motives, that induc'd the Parliament to Suppress the late pretended Privi∣ledg'd Places, where the Law was Cramp'd in the

Execution, and consequently Trade receiv'd a vast prejudice: But 'tis in vain to destroy some Nusances, if they leave others still remaining, which are worse, and more Dangerous: As the Wounds of Friends strike Deeper, and are more Fatal than those of Open Enemies: And as Extortions by Colour of Offices and Justice are greater Offences than down-right Exactions; for that they pretend Law (the greatest Blessing of the Subject) for the Countenance of Villany and Wrong.
But I hope the Parliament will take this parti∣cular also into Consideration, That the White-Fryars and Mint are not Crushed, so long as the Prisons of the King's-Bench and Fleet are in Being; for 'tis now become a Common Practice for Bankrupts and Cheating Knaves themselves to run into one, as they did into the other for Shelter and Protection.
