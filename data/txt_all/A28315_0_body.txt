SIR,
ALthough somwhat abashed (when I con∣sider those admirable guifts, both of Learning and Knowledge which are seated in your worthy Person as by your admirable works in Print are manifest) to Dedicate these my Laboues, yet being imboldned not only by our former acquaintance, as having ever found those noble parts in you, both of Wisdom and Affability: but also considering the great love and affection you did always bear unto Philoso∣phy: and so by consequence, a true lover of such, who are well-willers thereunto, according unto that Maxime in Philosophy, Every thing delighteth in its own Element, and doth soo∣ner adhere unto it, than to its contrary: and should this Book come into some mens hands who are not delighted in these kinds of Studies, although wise and well learned in other things, yet they will assuredly slight, and not regard what I have written, nor yet willingly shew any

love or countenance to the Writer, for according unto that notable expression of yours to the Rea∣der, in your excellent Book, intituled, The way to Bliss: That 'tis as possible to shape a Coate for the Moon, as in writing to please every Genius: so various are the generality of our inclinations, &c. What I have written in this Book is no Translation, but meerly the Subject of  many years Practice and Experience in the rological way of Physick: and Published, not  for my own vindication in point of Art  Practice, but also to instance others to do the like Cures as I have done; for I may truly say,  Wonders have been wrought, as in this Book will appear: yet many people I find are unsatisfied concerning any way of practice in Physick, the reason I conceive is, because many illitterate persons, and others who are ignorant of the Art of Astrology do foolishly speak against it, verifying that notable saying of the Poet Ars non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem. Concerning the lawfulness of the Art, I have sufficiently given satisfaction to the wise, in the Epistles of those Almanacks of mine, Dated Anno, 1658. and 1659. Besides, there are many excellent Men who have written both learned∣ly and largely thereupon; should I mention your most worthy self, who is known to be a great Master herein, and not only in Astrology but also in Philosophy, the most excellent part having I

dare say, few or no equals living. Sir, for the love I bear unto your most Worthy Person, and to those most excellent guifts which God hath en∣dowed you withal, I heartily wish I had higher and more excellent things to present you, that so you might take delight in reading, and in∣crease in Knowledge thereby: however, I que∣stion not, but that when you have read it over, you will find somewhat herein worthy your per∣usal which may (if ad nothing unto your wisdom and Knowledge) put you in mind of greater Mysteries: even as in Motions, the lesser wheels being moved, causeth the greater wheels to be set on work. Craving pardon for the boldness of him who heartily wisheth your increase, both in Coelestial, and Terestial Wisdom, Health, and Happines in this Life, and Eternal Joy in the Life to come; and who shall ever remain,
