RIght Honourable, and worthy Senators.
IT was an auncient custome, no
whit discommendable, among
the Ethiopian Princes, amid
their Feasts and Royall Ban∣quets,
to haue the head of a
dead man laid in Earth, pre∣sented
the first to the Table; in abundance of Mirth
to put them in minde of Mortalitie. Though I haue
euer beene a sworne enimie to Superstition, I seeme
to imitate them thus farre, who vnseasonably at
the solemnitie of this Royall Marriage, offer againe
to view the Image of our dead deere and neuer to be
forgotten Prince, Henrie. Affection is liable to
none account, and this Sorrow, to sound harts can

neuer come out of season, yet thus much for my selfe;
My loue to his excellent vertues, and person, to
whom I was so many wayes engaged, drew, some
while since these teares to their head, which encoun∣tring
with a contrary passion of Ioy, for the happy
Marriage of his Most-like Sister the Princesse
my most gracious Lady; like fire and water (stri∣uing
for praedominancie) I was enforced to make
both way euen to mine owne preiudice. What I haue
done, my Honourable Lord, in regard of the fidelity
the Citie hath euer borne to the State, the true har∣tie
loue you carry in your owne particulars to his
Maiestie, and the Progenie Royall, and lastly that
you are knowne out of your Noble and owne Natu∣turall
inclination to goodnes, to fauour all Learning
and Excellencie, whereby beyond your praedecessors
you gaine a double Honour, I humbly offer vp to
your Honourable protection: expecting onely Time
and Occasion wherein I may really manifest how
fast I am tyed in Zeale and dutifull Affection to so
worthy a Maior, and so Honourable a Citie.
