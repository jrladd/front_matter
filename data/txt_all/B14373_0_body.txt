MADAME,
THE true Deuotiō wch your Ladiship is knowne to haue all∣wayes borne vnto the B. Virgin MARY (together
with the many courtesies You lately shewed me, farre beyōd my deserts) hath emboldened me to present this little GAR∣DEN of our LADY (beset with most fragrant, and odoriferous Flowers) vnto you: wel knowing the Noblenesse of your Mynd to be such, as will accept of a meane guift, wher better ability doth want in the giuer; as ha∣uing no other way wher by to manifest the high
Estimation, and most faythfull Obseruance, wherewith he abounds towards You.
Into this GARDEN may you often, & confi∣dently enter, both for your spirituall & corpo∣ral Exercise. A GARDEN it is, most pleasant, and plāted with the Flowers of all celestiall Delights. And if at any time your Lad. Pchance to be dist∣racted through worldly Cares, or other busines,
retyre hither with speed to recreate your wearied Mynd and Senses, with the Variety, and sweet Ayre thereof.
Walke throgh the same dayly & diligently. Cō∣pose for your selfe a No∣se-gay of sweet smelling Flowers. Heere gather a Rose of Loue & Confi∣dence: There a Lilly of entyre & sincere Deuo∣tion: Heere a Violet of humble reuerēce & sub∣mission. There a Mary∣gold
of perfect Imitatiō of the B. Virgins vertues
And as the industri∣ous Bee, in sucking Ho∣ny out of Flowers, doth with no lesse Wisdome then Discretion, choose what is most fit and apt for her artificiall Buil∣ding; so may your Ladi∣ship imitate that proui∣dent, & laborious Crea∣ture, in selecting, amōgst so great variety, what shall be most fit for your spirituall Edifice.

I will not be ouer trou∣blesome with a lōger E∣pistle, since the Boūty of your good Nature assu∣reth me, aswell of a gra∣teful Acceptance of this mean Offer; as of a care∣full Imitatiō of the ver∣tues wch the ensuing Gar∣dē doth liuely represent. In confidence wheof, I rest, very respectfully,
