ALL who have a right
Sense of Things,
and understand but
a little of the State of Re∣ligion
in the World, can∣not
but see and lament the
great decay thereof every
where amongst us. Atheism

and Irreligion are become
too much in fashion, and
have too many Votaries and
Followers. It has not been
known in any Age, that
such sort of Men (or rather
Monsters, for Man is too
Honourable a Name for
them) have been so nume∣rous,
so daring and impu∣dent,
and so successful.
Who could imagine that
in a Christian State there
should be such Persons, who
are at great pains to propa∣gate
Atheism, and to run
down, if they were able,
our most Holy Religion!
As the neglect of Edu∣cating
Children aright, con∣tributes

too much to this
degeneracy; so the most
likely Remedy of this dan∣gerous
and spreading Di∣stemper,
is, a due care in
Parents and others who have
the Charge of Children, to
train them up in the Know∣ledge,
Fear, and Love of
God; To do what in them
lies, to fortifie their Minds
against those Snares and
Temptations to which they
are exposed; and to shine
before them, in the Practice
of sincere Piety themselves.
Tho' too many, on
whom God has bestowed
Children, are so far from
doing their Duty for their

Souls, that they corrupt
and utterly ruin them,
whichChrysost. one of the
Ancients calls a greater Cru∣elty,
than if they killed their
Bodies. Yet, blessed be
God, there are some, who
consider it as their main Bu∣siness,
with Relation to their
Children, to make them wise
and good, Lovers of God,
and Haters of every Evil
Thing.
Amongst those who are
governed by this Religious
Principle, God hath made
you, my most Honoured
Friends, great Patterns. As
he hath blessed you with a
numerous offspring, so he

hath given you of the Wis∣dom
from above, to know
how to Train them up in
Piety and Virtue. The hap∣py
mixture of Kindness and
Severity which you use to∣wards
them, makes them
not only to stand in awe of
you, but to love you.
I might be allowed, on
this occasion, to say some∣what
in Commendation of
those Excellent Qualities
which God has blessed you
with, and which appear
not only in your way and
manner of Educating your
Children, but in other things
likewise. The many and
great Expressions of your

kindness for me, ever since
I had the Honour to be
known to you, require the
most publick Testimony of
my grateful Resentment
thereof. But 'tis one of
your Virtues, that you chuse
rather to be concealed, than
to make any great noise
in the World. I shall
therefore restrain my self
from what otherwise not
only Gratitude, but the
great and just Esteem and
Affection I have for you,
do mightily tempt me un∣to;
And shall conclude this
Address with my Prayers
to God for you, That he
would increase his Grace

in you more and more,
that you may abound in
all the Fruits of Righteous∣ness
and true Holiness, un∣til
you obtain the End of
your Faith, the Salvation of
your Souls. I am,
