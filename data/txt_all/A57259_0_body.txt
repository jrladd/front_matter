Of all the Guifts of Gods most Sacred Spiret,
The Guift of Tongues being of much precious merit.
By which, Man, mainly, differs from a Beast,
And all rare Knowledge richly is increast.
How much, to our Industrious Ricraft, thenâ–ª
Is due, for his great Paines and vsefull Pen?
Who, thus, hath made so Copious a Collection
Of th' Orient Characters, for fair Direction
To learn those Tongues: A work most Excellent,
And, of more worth than Pearles most Orient.
For which, with gratefull heart, giue God the Praise.
And Crown braue Ricrafts Browes wth: fragrant Bayes.
