MADAM,
I Was afraid to venture these Meditations from the Pulpit to the Press, through a mixed multitude a∣lone without a Protection; for although they have had the happiness to be well received in a famous Audience, especially from the Persons of Quality who have perswaded me to suf∣fer them to appear in publick:
I knew not but that they might meet with some morose and ill-natur'd Zoilus, whose common practice is to bespatter the best approved Writings of our age; but since your Honour favours them with your acceptance, I have been delivered from all ap∣prehension: I fear no more the mistakes of the ignorant, and the malice of our sensual Wits, because I am certain that eve∣ry one will have some esteem and respect for those Labours, that are honoured with the Ap∣probation and Allowance of a person of that singular Wisdom and Piety; And not onely my private benefit hath obliged me to this Dedication, but also that
of my Friends unto whom I do not onely discover the unspeak∣able Excellencies of Heaven, but besides I reveal unto them the means of attaining unto that blessed End. The former they shall find in the Sermon, and the latter they may meet with in the Preface, in your Honour, and in your most Exemplary life; A life that makes you appear an Ornament amongst our English Nobility, and especially to the most noble Families that are re∣lated unto your Honour,
The most noble Fa∣mily of the Howards. One of them God hath blest with a numerous increase of Persons of the greatest worth: A Life wor∣thy of our admiration, in that it shews us Piety, Vertue, Wisdom,
Goodness, and Honour, as so many Celestial Lights shining together in the same Sphere; A Miracle in Grace as well as Na∣ture! A Blessing it is to our Na∣tion in this unhappy Age, that we have some such Noble Souls, that seem to be Angels Incar∣nate, sent amongst us by the Di∣vine Appointment on purpose to maintain the Honour of Re∣ligion against the encroachings of Schism and Profaness. It is unto such Heavenly Spirits, Ma∣dam, that Christ promiseth a Crown of Life; not onely to encourage them in a faithful management of his, and their Spiritual concerns, but also to oblige them to a total Resigna∣tion
of themselves and interests to the disposition of his Provi∣dence, and to enable them to bear worldly misfortunes, and present affliction with less pain. I do therefore offer the description of that extraordina∣ry felicity unto your Honour, as a seasonable meditation, where your Piety, Madam, may meet with Antidotes able to preserve your Noble Mind from the sence of all evil events: And as the Original shall one day be worthy your acceptance, be pleased now to look favour∣ably upon this Representation, which will afford your Honour a sight of those precious Jew∣els that enrich the Heavenly
Crown. Here is also the Assu∣rance that Faith and Reason do give of that Glorious Estate un∣to the Faithful: God preserve your Honour in much health and prosperity, with all your Noble Relations; It is the hear∣ty desire, and shall always be the Prayer of
