YOu Sir John Harmans second, Sir have been,
All this same Voyage, therefore you have seen,
The things here treated on, and more
Off these Transactions, part have bore
Too high a share for my poor Pen to write
I want expressions to set out the height
Of your brave Actions; pray excuse
The dullness of my Pen, and Muse.
I wish the Seafare you had mounted:
Then she a Frig at had been counted
Ʋnto this hour, except pale Death,
Ʋnluckely had stopt your breath.

I'm sure good Fight▪ Sir, you would make
Both for your King and Countries sake:
The Turks could never then a vaunted,
An English Frigat to a daunted:
'Tis not the Ship, nor yet the Guns,
Although she were a thousand Tuns;
But the brave Captain and his Seamen,
That fights like Englishmen, & Freemen


There is no Poetry exact
In these same Lines within, compact,
But such as 'tis, I pray receive,
No further favour I do crave;
Except it be to kiss your hand,
Who am your Servant to command.
