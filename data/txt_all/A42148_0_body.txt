To all in every place that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and Truth, and that wait for his glorious appearing, (more especi∣ally unto that Remnant to whom I stand more particularly related) Grace be multiplied, with encrease of Faith and Love from God the Father, and his Son Jesus the Anointed through the Comforter, Christian Salutation.

Well-beloved,
ITs matter of comfort to the Lords poor de∣spised people, in a dark day, that he is plea∣sed not to leave his nothing-ones (that ei∣ther have or do suffer any thing for the sake of blessed Jesus) without some signal tokens of his comforting and strengthening-presence with them, by which they are in a good measure

kept from fainting, and that he doth seal up instruction to their souls, leading them to the Rivers of Pleasures, causing them to drink deep of his Love and Free-Grace in his dear Son: Oh what a choice Mercy it is, that the Most High God should so far condescend, as to have regard to such worthless Crea∣tures; who in the day of their fulness so much provoked the Eternal God by their un∣thankfulness and mis-improvement of such Choice Mercy, as the Mercy of the Go∣spel is.
It is wonderful Grace that God should (notwithstanding such provocations wherewith he hath been provoked by Congregations in general, and by every Member in particu∣lar) still continue the good savour of his Grace upon the hearts of any of them, or that he should account any of his poor ser∣vants worthy to suffer Reproach and Bonds for his sake.
Which Mercy (which I esteem very choice and sweet to my soul) he hath been pleased for some time to let me enjoy; which is won∣derful in my sight, that such a nothing,

empty Creature as I am, should be employed by him in such a Noble Work, and in such a Noble Cause, as to suffer Bonds for the sake of blessed Jesus.
Yet notwithstanding the length of time I have been in durance, I find my heart is not so cleansed and brought to the foot of Christ, as I hope it may, and wait it should.
And if it so please the Lord to sanctifie these Bonds, that I may by the help of his holy Spirit so crucifie the remains of Cor∣ruption that I find still in my heart, and subdue, and bring in subjection every vain imagination, that every high thing that ex∣alts it self, may be brought in obedience to the King, then may I bless the Lord for the day that ever I lay in Newgate.
The which I may say I am engaged (and not without cause) already to do, for asmuch as God hath let me see my self, and the baseness of my own heart, the unbelief and diffidence that lodgeth there in some measure, which give occasion to me to magnifie the Grace of God the more, in that he should be graciously pleased to accept such an unworthy Worm

as I am, in his dear Son. A clear evidence of which, through Grace I can say I am not with∣out in my soul, yet not so, as wholly to be with∣out ups and downs, occasioned by temptati∣on working upon my Frailties, which my dear Lord Jesus is pleased to assist me in, and cause them to work for good unto my soul; Blessed be Jehovah.
I have in this Poem rudely scattered here and there some of those MEDITATIONS and EXPERIENCES, that God hath been pleased to visit my Soul with; the which I present to the view, and commend to the serious thoughts of all the Faithful, but more particularly, to that Remnant and chosen ones to whom I stand more immediately and parti∣cularly related in the bonds of the Gospel:
Hoping all the Spiritual will take them in good part, and judge of them in the Spirit of Love, to whose Christian correction I readily subject my self and Labours; hoping also, th they will put the fairest construction and inter∣pretation both upon them and me, that Brotherly Love and Duty binds them to.
I could not willingly pass to the Conclu∣sion of this poor Work, until I had first hin∣ted something touching the Fall of Myste∣rie Babylon, that old and great Whore, and of the Exaltation of our dear Lord; the thoughts of which now in my bonds, makes me very merry, and is as a cordial to comfort my poor heath, for which I wait, and to which time I trust he will keep that which I have committed to him.
My dear Brethren, 'Tis but a very little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry: In this time of our Pilgrimage let us labour to exalt him in our hearts, that he may be chief, and rule as Lord and King there, that when we come to lay down this house of clay, we may be cloathed upon with our House from Heaven, and be found of him without fault at his coming: To which end wait dili∣gently upon the Lord in his Word and Or∣dinances: Be much with God in Prayer, praying for all Saints, and for me the most un∣worthy Servant of Christ, that I may be kept faithful to death; and let your walks be in Hea∣ven; So shall the King greatly desire thy

Beauty, for He is thy Lord, and worship thou Him. Farwell: Grace be with you all: Amen.
From my poor pitiful Study in Newgate, Septem, 22. 1663.
