May it please your Grace,
IN Obedience to your Lordship's Wishes, I here publish an entire Account of Mr. Mason, and his Followers; which by God's Bles∣sing may detect Error, and becalm Faction; In those chiefly, who esteem a general Rendez∣vous upon Earth, a better enjoyment, than Heaven's Triumph; who look upon all Go∣vernment as Antichristian, and think it their duty to despise Dominion, that they may set up themselves, and Christ together.
I had design'd, indeed, to silence the Incredu∣lity
of the Atheist and Deist, but a report be∣ing spread, (and believ'd by some great Friends) that I was the Publisher of Mr. Mason's Let∣ters, &c. made me contract my thoughts, that I might gain, and undeceive the more Readers.
I return your Grace my Humble Thanks, for the Honour of your Commands, for the op∣portunity of doing a probable piece of Service to the Church of God, and for the liberty you have given me, to profess my self,
My Lord,
