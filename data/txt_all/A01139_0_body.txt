AS the Saints
were not af∣ter
the flesh,
so the wea∣pons
of their warfare
are not carnall, but
mighty through God,
to bring downe all the

strong holds and migh∣ty
imaginations of di∣vels
and men, plotted
cunningly against the
Israelites of God; yea,
all the forces of the
flesh and the world
must faint, and fly up∣on
the use of these
Armes. Of this com∣pleate
glorious Arma∣ture,
Prayer is a speci∣all
part; yea, it is the
very evergetical ma∣nifestatiō
of the pow∣of
all the rest. Jt put∣teth
on all the other
parts, it keepeth the

whole armature close
to a man, it sanctifieth
all the rest to their se∣veral
uses it guardeth
all the rest of the gol∣den
furniture from
theeves and robbers,
it daunteth the Divell
and the Divels limbs,
it carrieth the armed
Souldier through out
all forces and furies,
as a victorious Con∣querour.
And hence
is that saying of the
Ancients, Supplicati∣ons
and Teares are the
Armes of the Saints. As

the power and excel∣lency
of this spirituall
peece is unexpressi∣ble,
by tongues of men
or Angels; so am I the
least of all to be cal∣led,
of so high & hea∣venly
a faculty; but
since it hath pleased
him that hath mercy
on mee to teach mee
the use of it, (though
in much weaknesse,)
and to guide mee as a
weake pensill in his
draught of the truth
of it, to whom should
J then commend it

both for the Touch &
Tuition, but to the
Military Forces of the
new Hierusalem, who
are experimētally ac∣quainted
with this
peece of proofe? To
you then my deare &
thrice noble Fellow-Souldiers,
the Trained
Band of heaven, the
Artillery men of the
most High, I dedicate
my selfe and this litle
Treatise; accompt∣ing
it my only happi∣nesse
if I be but a door∣keeper
of the Compa∣ny;

bear with the fee∣blenesse
of my hands
in the unsheathing of
this Sword: man you
it with a holy and un∣daunted
courage, and
it will maintain you.
Times call you all to
the breach, stand
close one to another;
hold fast what yee
have, and let no man
take your Crowne:
Lay about you with
this fiery shaking
blade upon all within
you & without you,
that oppose Christ &

his Kingdome: Walk
worthy of so high a
gift; make not this
good commodity to
be ill spoken of; part
not with your Armes
and you shall over∣come.
If these my
poor pains may adde
any thing to your skil,
the greatest recōpence
I crave is to have a
share in your cūning
