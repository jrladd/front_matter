My Lord,
AS Government hath been always own'd by All, who ever were truly Wise and Good, to be one of the greatest Blessings, God hath vouchsafed to the Necessities of Mankind; so through the Wantonness or Peevishness of those that are to be Govern'd, it is rendred sometimes as Difficult a Province, as it is Useful and Necessary.


In this Sphere Your Lordship hath acted with that Loyalty to the KING, that Zeal to Religion, and that Mode∣ration to all sorts of People, that You have fully acquitted Your self to publick Approbation.
That Wantonness, I mentioned, proceeds from the abundance and ill use of Peace and Plenty. That other Cause of disorder, which I named, Pee∣vishness, ariseth from any slight Appre∣hension of doubtful and dangerous Times: which may possibly be now our Case.
In order to the satisfaction of such Misapprehensions, I have designed this short Discourse; the Sum of which is to do our Duty, and to trust God with the Success: which will certainly be the most Rational, as well as the most Christian way of securing every Man from those wild Fears, we labour under.


My Lord, I dare not question, but that That slender Acceptance, which this mean Sermon met with at its Delivery out of the Pulpit, that and much more it will find now in its Publication by Your Lordships Order from the Press.
