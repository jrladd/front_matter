SIR,
I Presume to lay this my Discourse, tend∣ing to Peace, hum∣bly at your Feet: be∣cause, 'tis well known,
You are a Courteous, Generous, Excellent, and Impartial Judge; and not so, more from your long Experience in the high∣est Concerns of your Native Countrey, than from the unequall'd choice∣ness of your Natural parts; and besides all these (which were not my least Inducements) from my assurance of your Lordships Conde∣scention, in formerly ob∣liging
the, now deceased, Author of the Discourse about HUMANE REASON, by a particular Favour, and so significant then, that there may be Rea∣son to doubt, whether, if it had not been season∣ably done, we had ever seen the Publication of that Issue of his Brain; for nothing has more of∣ten dampt the pregnancy of clear Understandings, than the Iron hand of
terrible Necessity, which was Mr. Clifford's Case, till by the Mediation, and prevalent Influence of your Lordship, his (before) narrow Salary, as Master of Sutton's Hospital, was inlarged; and consequently, by this my Apology for him, I have happily gotten opportunity of present∣ing the best Sacrifice I could, of Gratitude for him and my self. If then
what is here advanc'd, shall happen to please your Lordship; I may rationally conclude, it will not displease the most Discerning and Virtuous part of the English Na∣tion; so worthy an E∣steem it has, of whatever Action does any way ap∣pear considerably good in your opinion; because your Soul cannot own a mean thing, nor unpro∣fitable to the Publick In∣terest.
Pray therefore, Honourable Sir, be plea∣sed to pardon this bold∣ness of him, whose De∣sign is, and has, for ma∣ny years, been, only to let you know, he is, and from a true sense of Du∣ty,

London, Octob. 1680.
