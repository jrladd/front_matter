Generous Gentlemen,
THIS Trifle which I am bold to prefix your Name in, like a well drawn Picture, looks alike on each of you, and challenges your Protection and Patronage, you being the sole Promoters and Countenancers of its being what it is; your Commands, together with my want of Consideration, made me undertake a Task which I am conscious to my self I am alto∣gether unfit for. When I had plunged my self into this Sea of Thought, I quickly found my Mistake, and presently became sensible of my Error, though too late to recall it, having given my Promise before for the performance of it. I have taken what care I could to walk by the Rules prescribed me, as you will find by the perusal of it. If there be any thing in it can force a Smile or a kind Look from you, I have reach'd my end, and hope it may take off the edge of your Anger at the rest of an ill writ Play, which wants both Language, Wit and Plot, (which Three if I mistake not,) are the chief Ingredients that make up a Comedy, with which if it be fraught, Nonsense may sometimes pass unregarded. I expect not in this Critical and Censorious Age to fare better than the rest and best of Poets, who for the most part are branded with the Name of Scribling

Fops and Half-wits; and to say Truth, the World hath still been at that pass for some Ages past. Produce me but one Poet, either Ancient or Modern, that ever escaped the Lash of Envious and Malicious Tongues,
—Et eris mihi Magnus Apollo;
yet I hope that good Nature and sweet Disposition, which you are in a large measure indowed withall, will pass by small Faults and accept the Will for the Deed, from him whose highest Ambition is, that without offence, he may subscribe him∣self
