DEare brethren, because wee are crea∣ted
for gods glorie, ye edification one
of another in Christ, & are bounde to
serue therunto by wealth or wo, life or death,
and cheefely, they to whom God hath gyuen
the greater giftes, & whom he hath called to
higher romes, are most bounde to be zealous
for Gods glory, with godly zelousie to pro∣fit
the Church & spouse of Christ vnder their
charge, and yt by no subtlty, as the Apostle
warneth, they shoulde be corrupted from the
simplicity of Christe: Therefore there is no
doubte of your good zeale & diligence: My
good Fathers and deare Brethren who are
first called to ye battel, to striue for gods glo∣ry
& the edificatiō of his people, againste the
Romish relis and rags of Antichriste, I
doubt not but yt you wil couragieuslye & con∣stātly
in Christ, rap at these rages of Gods
enemies, and yt you will by this occasiō race
vp many as great enomities, yt we al know
& labour to raccout al the dregs & renmāts of

transformed poperie, that are crept into En∣gland,
by to much lenitie of thē that wibe na∣med
the Lords of the Clrgie. What is he that
hth the zeale of Gods glorie before his face, 
wil not ioyne both in prayer, and in suffering
with you, in so good a cause, that is so much for
Gods gorie & the edification of Gods church,
in the pure simplicitie of Chrits word & sa∣cramentes,
wherein our enemies and perecu∣turs
are strangly bewitched? I wote not by
what Circes , that they do make such a di∣uersitie
betwixt Christes word and his Sacra¦mentes,
that they cannot thinke the worde of
God safely ynough preached, and honourably
ynough handled, without cap, koape, surplis,
But that the Sacraments, the marying, the
burying, the churching of women, and other
church seruice (as they call it) must needes be
decored with crossing, with capping, with sur∣plessing,
with kneeling, wt prety wafer cakes,
and other knackes of poperie. O Paule that
thou were aliue, thou durst tell those politike
gentlemen, that there hath bin to much labour
bestowed vpon them in vaine: thou durst saye
vnto them as thou diddest to the Corinthians,
That they eate not the Lordes Supper, but
play a pagent of their own to blinde ye people▪
and keepe them stil in superstition, farre from
the simplicitie of Christes supper: but howe

many silie soules is there that doeth beleeue
very, that they haue an Englih masse, and so
put no difference betwene trueth and falshod,
betwene Christ and antichrist, betwene God &
the deuil, they are strangly bewitched. I say yt
thus wil bnde teir English priesthode & sa∣craments,
but muh more enchaūted that can
finde no garments to please them, ut such as
haue bin poluted openly with popish supersti∣tion
and idolatrie: but most of all in this point
that their madnes appeare to all posterities,
yt they make these Antichristian ragges Cau∣sam
sine qua non, that is, a cause wthout which
there is no holy ministerie in Christ, so yt this
shal make an English priest, be he nuer such
a dolt or vnlearned in the knowledge of the
scripture, as we haue very any, and without
these Romish reliques not Paule him self shal
be admitted (as one of them did blaspheme, &
the rest of them in effecte do affirme:) well a∣gainst
such popish chaffer & poperie, hath bin
long agone fughten withall, when the great
captaines of that religion liued, and yet God
gue the victorie. Therefore let vs not feare
nowe, although it doth begin to sturre againe,
for there is no craft, cunning, counsel, wisdom
or policie against the Lord. We haue Christe
and his Apostles and the Prophetes euer stri∣uing
against the Hipocrites of their tyme on

our side: a straw for popish policie we haue
the worde or God to warrant vs, to rote out
al monuments of supersticion & Idolatry,
and are charged to abhor them, to accoumpt
them, accursed, & to dety them, and to dtest
thē as menstreous clowts, they haue not the
word of God for thē. And what wiedome is
in them, saith God by his Prophet Ieremi,
they talke of obedince & concord, but there
is no obedience against the Lord, no nor cō∣corde
to be desired, but where Gods glory &
verity is preserued. Els better to haue al the
world in hurly burlis, and heauen & earth to
shake, thē one iote of gods glory should decay
So farre foorth as in vs lieth, we haue their
owne lawes & proclamatiōs to roote cut all
monuments of supersticiō & idolatri, & their
owne words are cōtrary to their doings. It
should appeare yt they repēt their reformaci∣on
proclaimed, as did ye Isralits, thei build a∣gain
yt which once they haue destroied & this
is don openly yt all the world may wonder &
behold: but what is don secretly, god wil one
day haue it declared openly, yea they make
the name of god & this doctrine yt we professe▪
to be euell spoken of alreadye. By manye
of theyr doinges, theyre iudgemente hasteth
that for such causes persecute Godsfrue
Preachers: Wherefore let vs not eare

theyr thretnings, ther can none persecute the
godly for this cause & trash, but either suche
as are neither hote nor cold, & then they shal∣be
vomited out vnlesse their zeale encrease,
or suche as haue no God before their eyes,
whose God is their bellye, or else open pa¦pists,
whō God hath giuen vp to a reprobate
sence, wherfore we must thus take it, yt they
are gods rods for our sins, because we haue
not bin more zealous in gods cause, neyther
careful to seeke his glory, y• wolfe Winche∣ster
& blody bucher Bonar fought once agaīst
many godly men for the ground of this gere,
and they had all the power of ye Realme ser∣uing
their lustes: but behold howe the Lorde
in short time ouerthrew them all, to giue vs
courage to go forward, the Lord forgiue vs,
we are to slacke and negligent in heauenly
thinges: this monster Boner remaineth and
is fedde as papistes say, for theyr sakes, & it
must be graūted it is for some purpose, al∣though
he be a traitor & an enemie to y• crown
& realme, and both to God and man, whych
burned Gods holy testament, murdered his
faintes and his seruātes. But what the Lord
requireth to be done wyth false Prophetes,
it is manifest: we haue both the lawe of
God & man for vs. But we are answered nay
you your selues shalbe compelled to turne
your coates and cappes, and get you into his

liueries, & to be like him in your garmentes.
O Elias that thou liuedt, or that thy spirite
were amongst vs, thou wuldest aye with the
Prophet Sophome, That God will vnite the
wearers of this idolatrous garmēts or strāge
apparel, thou wouldest say, that thinges dedi∣cated
once to idolatrie, is not indifferent: thou
wouldest say reuerence to the Sacrament is
wrought by doctrine and Discipline, and not
by popishe and Idolatous garmentes: thou
wouldest saye, What decencie can ther bee
gayned to the Sacramentes, by that which
hath bene deuised and vsed to deface it: I the
golde ordeyned by God for the reuerence and
decencie of the Iewes Temple, is not to bee
admitted to beautifie the Churche of Christe,
much lesse kopes brought in by Papistes the
enemies of God, and alwayes continued in
their seruice as ornamentes of their Religi∣on
in no wyse ought of vs Christians to be re∣tayned.
But the Papistes triumphe and glo∣rie
in their assemblies, that the whote gospe∣lers
shalbe driuen to their doltishe attires: for
the Lordes sake let vs neuer giue them anie
cause of ioye, though we shoulde dye for it.
Moses would not yeelde one hoofe of a beast
in Gods busines, he would not leaue the lou∣pe
vade, nor make a button or a claspe
more or lesse. Eleazar will not dissemble by

eating of vnlawfull meates, the faithfull Is∣raelites
woulde not receyue so much as an y∣uie
bushe. Contrarie wie Origen carying a
braunche, and professing that hee bare it for
Christ at the first: But was afterwarde com∣pelled
to open idolatrie, so cursed a thing it is
to giue any place to the wicked: all the pa∣pistes
that say, they worship Christ in ye crosse,
and God in the sacrament, do still vnder these
wordes continue stil in their idolatrie: beware
of deceytful wordes, that couer wicked purpo∣ses,
to drawe vs from Christian simplicitie.
Let vs stand constantly against all abuses, &
repent for our former coldnes in religion, and
our sinnes, and cal for helpe frō aboue, for the
hand of the Lord is not shortened: we are as∣sured
that we seeke Gods glory, and our ad∣uersaries
may see, if they can see any thing,
that this thing that they seke is not for Gods
glory, seeing the papistes the enemies of God
do so desire it and glorie in it. And reioyce, yt
we, whom they most hate, cannot be safe but
vnder their garments: we are assured that we
seeke Gods glorie in folowing Christe his A∣postles
and Prophets: who euer despised these
pharisaical outward faces and visures, Christ
findeth faulte with the garmentes of the Pha∣risees.
Paule counteth all his Pharisaicall
shewe to be dunge. Zachari saith, that the

false Prophet shalbe ashamed of his prophe∣cye,
and forsake his garments wherin he de∣ceiued,
& shal ye true Prophetes be faine to
creepe into their coues▪ for by the same au∣tority
may be cōmanded any peace of pope∣ry,
so y• it be namd policye. Ezechias & Io∣sias
knew no such autority, but they say: It
is for policie. For it plainly appeareth that
there is lesse care for religion then for poli∣cie.
But beware yt the exāple of Ieroboham
be not folowed, that made such like preistes
for policye, as would do as he commaunded
them. Achaz of policie broughte y• fashion of
an altar into Ierusalē, as he saw at Damas∣cus,
where he had ouercome the Idolatours
and their idoles, but cursed was his policie,
and so are all they yt wil retaine any thing of
their idolatry. Nabuchodonosors Idoll was
for vnity & policie, but without ye warrant of
gods word, ther is neither good vnity nor po¦licy.
The godly father Bucer called ye tenths
and the first fruites sacriledge & robery, they
be kept stil for policy, crosse & candelstickes
are supersticious, thoughe they bee kepte,
I wot not for what policie, the adoration of
the Sacrament in the countries where they
knocke and kneele for a wafer cake is a po∣pish
policy. That women baptise, that plura∣lities,
to, quots, impropriacions, non residēce

dispensations, suspencions, excōmunicaciōs,
and absolucions for mony  graunted,  is
euel like as are mani other  brw∣ed from Rome,
which remaine  of
policy. Al these things were abhorred as po∣pish
upersticions & Idolatries, amng our gospellers both bishops and others, when
they were vnder gods roddes in puey.
But how they now haue learned curtle i∣uinty
to ground all vpon policy. Humble
them again, O Lord, that they do not fget
thee, and thy great kindnes, and mercy 
vpon them, and sturre vppe their heartes
and mindes, that they may be careful uer
thy poore flocke. O Christ whom thou haste
dearely bought, by this their policie are blin∣ded,
and careth for no more, ut y they may haue this supersticious shw which is 
maintained.  him mumble as he list if
he be thus apparelled, al his seruice is wel i∣nough,
otherwise it is nothing worth. Thus
cause you thē to perish by yur policyes, for
whom Christ hath dyed. Furthermore, if po∣pery
be supersticious & idolatrous, euel and
wicked, as yet ther was neuer a worse thing
in the world, thē ar we cōmanded to abstine
frō al participatiō therof, & frō all the shew
therof ab omnistecie mali, yt is from all shew
of wickednes. These garmēts were the shew

of their blasphemous priesthod, herein they
did sing and say their upericious atrous seruce
they dyd cnce their Idoles and helpe
forward their idolatrous masses: What po∣licie
can it be then to weare this geae? ut a
superstitious, wcked and popish policie: they
do it for policie (they say) that their Priestes
may be knowen and magnified of men. Did
not the Pharisees vse the same policie, to doe
al their workes and make all their garmentes
both Philacteries vpon their heads, and their
wyde and syde robes and borders, that they
might be more expectable & notorious to the
people? but their wo is threatened aboue al o∣ther
sinners. To such hypocrites, as being
voyde of all true holines, delite in all outward
shewes, their curse is most inculcate, their po∣licie
is that the Priestes shall weare white in
the churches to signifie their vertue, their pu∣renes
and holines: and when they go foorth of
the Church they must weare blacke gownes
and blacke hornes for contrarie policies & for
diuers significations. Our master Christes
policie was expressed in one word, fede, feede,
feede: and the Prophetes before, and the A∣postles
afterwarde: if Christe be the wisdome
of the Father, the true Ministers shalbe well
ynough knowen, by that one marke which hee
giueth: And if that he haue not that marke,

better vnknowen then knowen, both for him
see and others: Therefore let them not saye,
for shame, that they seke Gods glory, Christes
will, or the edification of his Church by their
policie. Whyles they threaten and stoppe the
spreading of Gods woorde and feeding of
Christes flocke, commanded by writing to ex∣communicate
the moste faithfull laburers in
the planting of the Gospell, because they will
not weare the ragges of poperie, to expulse ye
most valiant Souldiers against the Romishe
Antichriste, the most earnest ouerthrowers of
the kingdome of Satan, which standeth in sin
& blindnes. O beware you, that wil be Lordes
ouer the flockes, that you be not sore punished
for your pryde towardes your brethren, and
your cowardlines in Goddes cause, that for
Princes pleasures and pompouse liuings, do
turne poperie into policie, and to become our
persecutours vnder the cloke of policie: it
were better to lose your liuings, then to dis∣please
God in persecuting of your brethren,
and hinder the course of the word. But as our
dutie is, we will praye for you, and for al our
brethren in the ministerie, that GOD of his
grace would graūt vs more zeale for his glo∣rie,
than any of vs hath had heretofore, more
desire to edifie Christes people in pure sim∣plicitie,
to present them a chaste virgin vnto

Christ, then hetherto hath appeared, that
when the ead shepheard shall cal to accoute
we be not ashamed. But being found perte
in all good workes, may receiue the crowne
prepared: as for you deare brethren whom
God hath called into the brunte of the battel,
the Lorde kepe you constant, that ye yeelde
neither to toeration, neither to anye other
 perswasions or dispensacions, or licē∣ces,
which were to fortify their Romish prac¦tses,
but as you fight y Lords fight, be vali∣ant.
God will not leaue you, neither forsake
you, as you seeke Gods glory, god will glo∣rify
you, & as by you Christs church is edifi∣ed,
comforted & conformed in Christian sim∣plicity,
so shal you receaue comfort by Christ
your head captaine, whē you shalbe called to
giue accompts of your stewardships, & to be
rewarded for your fidelity: ye matter is not
so smal as ye world do take it, it wil appeare
before al be ended, what an hard thing it is
to cut of the ragges of the Hidra of Rome, it
is beautiful, but poysonful, ther is no dealing
with such a monster, beware of loking backe
to Sodo or delight any witte in the gar∣mentes
of Babylon, neyther once touche
the poysoned cup, though it bee of golde or
glittering. Let vs repent of our former sins
vnfaynedlye, and then shall we abhorre and

stampe vnder our feete these rags, that were
appointed to supersticion and idolatry. Let
vs hate the blasphemous priesthode, so iniu∣rious
to Christes priesthode, yt euery patche
and token of it be in execration, detestation,
and accursed, and take no parte of it vpon
our heads nor backes, least wee be accursed
as it is. Let vs not make the heritage of god
as a byrd of manye coloures, holdinge of di∣uers
religions, Let vs not mixte the Iewes
with the gentils, let vs not in no wise mixte
this our religion with any thinge of Anti∣christ,
let vs not confirme the blinde in their
blindnes, neither the weake in their super∣sticion:
But rather let vs take away, if wee
can, the names, memories, & all monuments
of poperie, and that Antichristes priesthode:
Let vs open our windowes with Daniel, &
professe what we are: their cruelty shalbe our
glory. Let vs follow Paule, that knewe that
the truth, gospel could not be retained, if any
Iewishe cermonies were maintained. Let
vs rather neuer weare any garmente, then
we should weare those, wherby our brethren
should be weakened, offēded or bouldened to
take part with the idolatrous, & so through
our hautines in knowledge, our weake bre∣thren
perishe, for whom Christ dyed. Behold
and marke well, howe they fall backwarde

that yeelde in any iote, and see howe they are
edified, and increase in godlines, which holde
that right way that you goe in, the which the
Lorde increase you, and vs all, and strengh∣then
vs with his holy Spirit, that we may cō∣tinue
to our liues ende, alwayes both
by our thoughtes, words & works,
to aduance his glorie and ho∣nour
dayly more & more,
now and for euer,
AMEN.
