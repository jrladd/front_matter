May it please Your Lordship,
IN Your Goodness to accept of this small Testimony, of my bounded Duty, for Your Lordships Patroci∣ny, and Singular Kind∣ness to me and mine, in a constant Course of Favour, which hath still issued from Your Noble Ancestors, without the least
 Umbrage in your Noble Person, and your most Honourable Lady: Who, tho the Daughter of a Prince, and One of the greatest Peers of this Ancient Kingdom doth add to Her Natural Splendor, th Lusture of a Condescending and Courteou Mean, as if her Ladyship were of a lowe Extract. I cannot but express the Thank∣ful Sentiments, I Entertain of the Favou of your Noble Predecessors, and of you Honourable and most Worthy Mother Whose approved Conduct, Prudent, C∣vil and Edifying Way, hath not only En∣gaged me, but all who have had the Ho∣nour of her Ladyship's Converse, to loo upon her as a Woman among a Thousan But I know your Lordship needs no bo∣rowed Rayes, from the Applauses  Men; And therefore I shal not insist; B only to Begg your Favourable Acceptan of this small Mite of my Gratitude
 which, tho Weak and Unworthy; yet presumes to Kiss your Noble Hands, be∣cause of its general Design, to Advance that Glorious Religion, which if it were not opposed by the Lusts of Men, and if left to its own Innocence and Native Power, would transform the World from a Chaos of Confusion, to a wonderous Light: So Wishing the Blessings of the LORD'S Right and Left Hand to your Lordship, and Noble Family; I shall add no more, but that I am in all sincere Duty,
My LORD,

From my Study at St. Vigeans, 14 July, 1693.
