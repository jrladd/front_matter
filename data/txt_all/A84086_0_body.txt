GLORIOƲS are all the Moveables of the Spiritual Ta∣bernacle, all the Doctrines of Chri∣stian Religion: but the Table of Shew-Bread, the point of the Eucharist, is one of those three things which the Law hath ho∣noured with a Crown of Gold. This is that Bread, which su∣stained David amidst his military travels. This is that Honey,

which the Nazarite of God found out, having rent asunder the Li∣on. This is that hidden Manna, which is promised to the Conque∣ror. After so many others which are gone before me, I make plain the way of this Bethlem. And in these my exercises, my suppli∣cation is, that the Sun may stop his course to lengthen the victories of Josuah; that at the sound of his trumpets, the strongest Ram∣pires may fall down and fill up their trenches; that his Squadrons may scale the highest Towers; that the Rivers may run back to∣wards their Cataracts at the pre∣sence of the Arke; that the sword of God may prosper in the hand

of Gedeon; that the Stars may fight for Barak; that Zebulon may triumph over the Ships of Tyre and Tharsis. And that David having served in the Councel of God, may depart hence full of daies, to enter into the joy of his Master.
