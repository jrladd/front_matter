THE inuented
historie of S.
George (right
honorable and
my singular
good Lord)
howsoeuer heretofore abused,
may conueniently be applied to

these our dayes of her Maiesties
most happy gouernement, wher∣in
the beames of the Orientall
starre of Gods most holy word
appeare vnto vs most splendent
and transparent, to the singular
comfort of all faithfull. For wher∣as
vnder the person of the noble
champion Saint GEORGE our
Sauiour Christ was prefigured,
deliuring the Virgin (which did
signifie the sinfull soules of Chri∣stians)
from the dragon or diuels
power: So her most excellent
Maiesty by aduancing the pure
doctrine of CHRIST IESVS in
all truth and sincerity, hath (as an
instrument appointed by diuine
prouidence) bene vsed to per∣forme

the part of a valiant cham∣pion,
deliuering an infinite nūber
out of the diuels power, wherun∣to
they were tied with the for∣cible
chaines of darkenesse. In
which sēse retaining S. GFORGE
for England, not onely as the pa∣tron
of the noble order of the
garter, but as the head & patron
of our eternall glorie, both those
that be knights of that noble or∣der,
and all other of what degree
or calling soeuer, haue iust cause
to reioyce, & to expect their de∣liuerance
purchased by the spil∣ling
of his most precious bloud,
following him as our generall, &
hearing only his voice sounding
in his most holy word. For euen

as right soldiers hauing the signe
of marching forwards giuen thē,
do take vp all their trinkets:
but hearing the note of battell,
lay them downe againe, prepa∣ring
and making themselues rea∣dy
with heart, eyes, and eares, to
execute whatsoeuer is by their
generall commanded: So ought
al Christians alwaies to be ready
to abandon all worldly goods &
honours, for to follow their said
generall IESVS CHRIST chear∣fully
& with courage, for they do
heare the note of battell daily
preached vnto them, vnder the
most peaceable gouernement of
her most excellent Maiesty. The
due consideration of which pre∣paration

is the only & principall
point that the noble knights of
this renowned order are to study
wearing the liuery of the holy
crosse imprinted in their minds,
as being true knights of Malta,
to defend and aduance true reli∣gion,
& the welfare of their coū∣trey:
the prosperity of both being
ouermuch hindered by the
meanes of a cruell dragon, hath
giuen me cause to explaine the
same, and to describe the history
of Saint GEORGE Allegori∣cally
in this treatise, the dedi∣catiō
therof properly belonging
vnto your honor, whom her Ma∣iesty
by diuine inspiration hath
bene pleased to aduance to the

authoritie of that honorable
place, where the crueltie of this
dragō is qualified, & in some sort
bridled: his operations & effects
are tending to the ouerthrow of
equality & concord, two things
required in euery well gouer∣ned
comonwealth; which being
neglected, all policy of gouern∣ment
is broken, concord within
the realme amongst the seuerall
mēbers of the same, and equality
in the course of traffike between
the realme and other countries.
Pardō (my good Lord) my bold∣nes
in publishing this testimony
of good will and duty vnto your
honor in these few words, seeing
that so many are the honorable
fauours receiued at your Lord∣ships

hands, that an Epistle dedi∣catory
vnto a treatise cannot cō∣taine
the same, vnlesse I would
seeme to build a high steeple vn∣to
a litle cotage. VVherefore hū∣bly
commending this treatise to
your iudicial eies & protectiō, &
crauing pardō for my presūption
proceeding from an affectionate
desire to your honours seruice,
whereunto before all men I ac∣knowledge
my selfe bounden, I
beseech the eternall God to in∣crease
his graces in your L.
that his glory may more thereby
appeare, & multiply your daies
as the dayes of heauen. London
this 24. of May. 1601.
