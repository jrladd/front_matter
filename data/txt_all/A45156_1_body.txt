Mr. Humfrey,
Chester, Apr. 12. 1997.
I Receiv'd by Piece-meal, as it came from the Press all your Book entituled, Of the Righteousness of God in the Mat∣ter of Justification (except the Title Page and the Epistle) which I read over, as it came to my Hands, with Pleasure and Profit. The great Doctrine of Justification, is by you stated more agreeably to the Scriptures, than I have met with it, in any other Author. You do, I confess, in some Places express your Sense obscurely, so that it may perhaps be mistaken by unwary Readers: but if in those Places I rightly apprehend your Meaning, I do not at present re∣member any thing I have to object against it. However, I intend the next Week to read over the whole together, and if any Objections shall then occur to my Thoughts, you shall hear further from me. It will, I doubt not, be a good Antidote against the Antinomian Doctrines, which some Persons who decry, do implicitly and by necessary Consequence assert, by the false Notion they have entertain'd of Christ's imputed Righteousness. I am SIR,
