MY MOST HONOVRED LORDS. I dare not so much trespasse against the publicke, as (after the solemne and tedious manner of Epistling) to vsurpe your time with a barren Pre∣face: it is my gaine, if I be but heard to say, I dedicate my selfe: in which, I vnderstand my vtmost abilities, and of those, doe here offer vnto your Lordships a small part, being rather the redemption of my life from the note of idlenesse, then any fruitfull course of liuing. For, being (after some yeares expence in France, for the publike seruice of the State) retired to my priuate and domesticke cares, it was yet my couetousnesse to winne so much vpon them, as the leisure of Translation to this generall Historie of France, written by Iohn de Serres; an Author, whom (aboue mine own particular knowledge of this subiect) I haue heard vniuersally esteemed, for the most faithful, and free from affection, that euer toucht at that Argument; able to teach the vnlearned, to delight the learned, and draw to him as many Commenders, as Rea∣ders. The Maiesty, Graces, and Strength of whose worke, if I in my traduction, haue any way vnsinewed or defrmed, I con∣fesse a sinne against his graue; yet, in my consecration of him to

your Lordships, I haue made him plenarie satisfaction: which presumption of mine, though he may glorie in, I haue no other meane to expiate, but by naked professing my selfe to both your Honours, bound in all obligation of dutie & seruice, no lesse then your selues are each to other in the faith of loue & freindship. For which sacred respect, I haue thus prefixed you joyned in the face of my Altar, where I omit to speake more of your mutuall and knowne merites, except I had volumes to fill, not pages: and desire onely, that where I am studious to be gratefull, I may not deserue to offend.
