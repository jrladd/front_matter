SIR,
OF those many hundreds of Sermons,
which you have heard from me,
(since you pleased to call me to the
work of the Gospell in your place)
The lot of being published is only falne upon
this single one, preach't at your Command, to
the Country then under your Command. I
will not adventure at an Apology for my prin∣ting
it, for I look upon the presse as a common
Midwife for poore folkes, as well as rich; and
an advantage (not only to the grand Masters of
Learning, and parts, but) to all other men, who
desire a cheape, easie, and ready way of Com∣munication:
Neither doth this Sermon (a Za∣cheus

rather than a Saul) come forth because it is
higher by the head, or of a goodlyer Stature,
or Complexion then its brethren (for no man
that sees it will by its looks guesse that it was
born in an University) nor doe I print it, for any
thing that it hath done beyond others upon the
Subject which it handles, for I am not worthy
(with Ionathans Lad) to run, and gather up
their Arrows; but, because the Lord pleased
to blesse it with some good successe (the Reve∣rend
Judges and many others being much af∣fected
with it) and because I cannot (as yet)
find any way of expressing my due respects to
your selfe so publiquely as this.
The best word it had after it was preacht
(and I never desire better) was, that it was An ho∣nest
Sermon, and as it is usually said of an ho∣nest
man, that he may travell all the world
over, and need not feare looking any one in the
face, so I hope may an honest Sermon. And,
to him that shall examine this Messenger of
mine, whence he comes, and whither he goes,
and what is his businesse? If he say, From Ayno,
with an Hue and Cry after a company of self-condemned
sinners, who have broken the pri∣son
of conscience, and run up and downe in

their chaines, to apprehend them; and withall
makes mention of your name, and warrant for
so doing, I hope it shall be neither danger, nor
dishonour to you: There is never a Magistrate
in England but I am sure ought, and never a
good one but will assist this work of Gods word
to suppresse sinne and open wickednesse.
There is a suite (I confesse) depending a∣mongst
Divines about Gods Vindictive Justice,
and its necessary working; and excellent plea∣ders
there are on both sides: Now although this
Sermon speakes on the defendants side, yet I
hope its testimony shall offend none who shall
consider that the chief tendency of my speech
(and indeed of that point) is to the glory of
Gods holinesse, Justice, and mercy, and the
beating down sinne, and those slight thoughts
of ungodly men concerning it: if therefore this
comes into a good mans hands, he will not be
the worse for reading it; if into an evill mans,
he may be the better; and if into a learned mans,
he will have cause to blesse God, that he can
write farre better, My only request is, that when
it comes into your hand, it may be accepted with
the right hand, even as it is tendred.
All that I have to adde, is to acknowledge,

and to leave this with you as a testimony of my
gratitude for your many favours, and of your
diligent, and exemplary attendance at, and
countenance of the publick Ordinances and
worship of God under my Ministery: And to
beg of God on your behalf, that you may flou∣rish
in your spirituall estate, even as you doe in
your temporall. That in your Magistracy, you
may be wise, and zealous, that you may be
eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame; that you
may be a terrour to evill doers, and a praise to
them that doe well; that the poore and op∣pressed
may waite for you as the raine, and you
may cause the widdowes heart to sing for joy;
That in your family you may walke with a per∣fect
heart, not suffering an evill doer, or wicked
servant to tarry in your sight. In a word; that
by an holy, and cheerfull improvement of your
time, Interest, and many talents, you may glo∣rifie
the great God, credit the Gospell, uphold
sinking Religion, be one of those innocents,
that may preserve the Island; doe good, be fruit∣full
in good workes, relieve the poore, and
needy (which indeed you doe more than many
that make a greater noise) strengthen the hands
of the Ministry, and so expresse your affection

to Learning (which I know you prize) that poor
I may stand by, and more excellent pens come
forth publiquely to acknowledge you, and
blesse God for you, and you may be the blessed
of the Lord, and your seed after you. Sir, These
are, and such as these shall be the humble, and
dayly prayers of
