TO you first of the Assembly I commend these things, because you are they to whom the Supreme Authority of the Nation, hath committed the care and judgement of these, and the like differences, that you may judge be∣tween us, and make publike if you please, your dissent from what is not of Gospel proof, on either part.
To you the Honourable Committee aforesaid, I humbly present these also, that you hereby may see, that by this, or by the other cries of men of diffe judgements, Is e  o be spoyled or wounded by you; spoyled of that by your word, and hand-writing, you have, for my Ministeriall labours promised me, it being the life of me and my great family: or wounded in my name, who have lived, though in weaknesse, according to the testimonies of Christ; and give me leave to mind you that of God, That the labourer is worthy of his hire.
To you my faithfull and beloved friends of the Soake the City of Win∣ton, and County aforesaid; I leave this as my loving remembrance to you, advising you to beware of the secret practises of men against the Gospel, as of works of darknesse, and deep dishonesty in them that do them, from whome, and from which things keep your selves.
And  Mr Doctor Durie, I challenge a breach of promise, who near twelve moneths since, by letter promised me your notes on my booke, and you contrary thereunto send my book and your bitter notes on it to my adversaries, what hand you had in the private communicating of them I know not, but leave to God: Sir, in obedience to Christ onely, I have forborne to returne you railing for railing; nor would I have you for this, thinke I have forgot any good I have received from you, but acknowledge the least thaulnsse: Sir, I have not wronged you a word, as I know, in trscribing your noes, they shall be compared with the Originall, at your command b any indifferent man; Sir, all that I have done herein is for the Gospel, my deares friend, for whome I desire to forsake all, and althings, and yet rest,
