SInce by so Earnest, and so Wise a Care
You Rule that Treaty which Concludes the War:
Since Europe doth Confess the Peace is due
Next to our matchless King, my Lord, to You.
Well may the Muses grateful Offerings raise
To Him, whose Worth so far transcends their Praise:
Him, whose unwearied Services commend
The Faithfulst Subject, and the Faithfulst Friend.


Accept my Lord, a Muse that strives to Sing
The Greatest Hero, and the Greatest King.
She strives indeed, but to her Cost she found
Her Voice too Weak for so Sublime a Sound.
A Theme so Lofty, and a Work so Bold,
Ask strength and Fancy not to be Controul'd.


Like a rude Painter, whom propitious Chance
Directs (unknown) some Likeness to advance:

All I can boast amounts alone to bring
Some faint Resemblance of so Brave a King.
Portland is able best to judge How well
The Picture shews the Great Original:
Can with a glance Discern, if in the Lines
Ought that is like a true Proportion shines.


For You have from the Hero's mouth been taught
His gallant Aims, and all his inmost Thought.
And have Your Self been Witness of the Toil
He spent in Arms to save the Brittish Soil.


How with amazing Valour He pursu'd
His numerous Foes thro' Dust, and Fire, and Blood.
Whilst His Triumphant Fleet at his Command
Dispers'd His Thunder thro' the Hostile Land:
Destroying Towns, and Navys that presume
To share His Ocean, and to tempt their Doom.
Till now their Master, fearful of His Pow'r,
Solicites Peace, which he Disdain'd before.
With hast He Signs, releasing All his Claim
To Towns and Countries won, and bends to William's Name.
