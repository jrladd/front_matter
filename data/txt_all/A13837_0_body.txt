RIght woorshipfull, the great and good affection, which I haue borne to you euer since J was first acquainted with you, hath alwaies bin a stir∣ring mee forward to bewray the force of my inward good will, by some outward shew: and now at length it hath compassed that which it co∣ueted of long, and offereth vnto you in value more than great, first written in French
 by a woorthie man, whose name and profession it bea∣reth, now denized in En∣glish, almost word for word, by a well willer of yours, though scant able to reach to the originall depth of the natiue writer. Yet J thought it good rather to hazard my owne credite, with some note of infirmitie, than to haue this argument vnharboured in English, with the infinite losse of so great a commodity. For what is more profitable to a Christian man, than to haue his soule continually
 exercised in the traine and practise of a liuely faith? the performance whereof, this treatise vndertaketh, whose recommendation I will not meddle with, least by saying either too too little, or too too base, J impaire that which will commend it selfe beyond comparison. To the En∣glish Christian I discharge my selfe, by vttering that in zeale which J conceiue to be most profitable for eche his soule. To your worship I recommende my labour, as the true signe of a trustie
 mynde: wherein, if it shall please you to bestowe some, though the least time, I dare assure you of great profite for the comfort of your consci∣ence, and beautifying of your soule. Almightie God pro∣sper you in all your good and vertuous attempts, and send you that good, which both J wish you, and this booke pre∣tendeth. London, the 14. of Iune, 1583.
