MOst worthy and renowned PRINCE, I am in hope it shall seeme no presumpti∣on, to offer this my vnlettered dilligence to the sight and view of your Highnesse, the cause especially belonging to the set∣ting forth of Gods glory, and after a cer∣taine maner, doth very nearely concerne the seruice of your royall Father, of whose Christian inclination to plant piety, and to releeue innocency, the world hath had long experience. To none more rather thē to your Highnesse therefore belongeth these mine endeuours, whom nature and rare vertues with liberall minde hath adorned with singular indowments: and education a∣gaine furnished with knowledge and exquisite learning belonging to a Prince. May it now please your Grace, my selfe hauing heere (according to my little skill) stood in defence of our religiō against the eager assaults of per∣uerse and malicious papistes: Although I must confesse, with more breuity then the amplenesse of the matter, or the necessity of the cause required: I am therefore most humbly to craue pardon of your Highnesse, for passing of those bounds that custome prescribeth in that case: yet if there were no further cause to presse your High∣nesse, for the Patronage of so good a purpose this might suffice: It is meant for the glory of God, but be∣sides this inducement, there is yet one other especiall

inforcement to leade me to this on-set namely when in that infortunate Country of Irelande, the Popes Vermine (your royall Fathers mortall enemies) haue such scope and liberty, that they drawe the people after them, to runne headlong into that extreame perdition, both of body and soule, and into that horrible downefall of dis∣obedience both to God and their Prince.
Nowe where their resteth so much presumption in Priestes to Impugne the sworde of gouerment, there must be courage in Princes to defend their owne. I will wade no deeper, but in all humble and submissiue maner will leaue these lines to your Gratious vewe. And thus layinge my handes vnder your Highnes feete will rest.
