RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
EIther by Earthly acci∣dent, or Heauenly pro∣uidence, meeting with this late imprinted French Treatise, of The Iudge∣ment of Humane Actions, written by

Monsieur Marande (a name that I more honour then know) and diuing into the perusall thereof, I found it for mat∣ter so solide, and for phrase so curious a Master-peece of Morall Philosophie, that I sawe my selfe engaged; yea and in a manner bound to deuest it from its French garbe, and to sute it in our English attire and habite; as desirous that England, as well as France, should participate of that benefit and Fe∣licitie.
But as I was entering into this taske, and casting my selfe vpon the resolution of this attempt; I was in∣stantly met and assayled by an ob∣stacle of no small importance; For considering that France hath now made, and declared her selfe Englands enemie, and consquently giuen vs no iust cause or reasons to loue French

men, but many to hate them, I there∣fore (in honour to my Prince and Country, to whose prosperity and ser∣uice, my best blood and life shall euer bee prostrated) at first began to re∣iect this Booke, because written by a French man, and so to looke on the translation thereof, rather with an eye of contempt then of affection: But at last recollecting my thoughts, and considering that Peace is the gift and blessing of God, and Charty the true marke of a Christian, I therefore from my heart and soule wishing and desi∣ring, a safe, honorable, and perdurable peace betweene these two mighty neighbour Sister Kingdoms in parti∣cular, and to all Christians, and the whole Christian world in general. And also well knowing that Learning is vniuersally to be cherished, and vertue

honoured in all persons, times, and places of the whole world, without exception or distinction; then (these premies considered) this my last con∣sideration preuailed and vanquished my first, and so I re-assumed my for∣mer designe and resolution to finish it; although (in regard of the deepe matter, and the knottie, and elegant stile thereof) I ingeniously confesse, that many Gentlemen, both of England and Scotland, had beene farre more ca∣pable for the discharge and perfor∣mance thereof then my selfe.
Hauing thus made my selfe an English Eccho to this French Author, and now in these times of Warre ta∣ken this Booke, as a rich French prise, and landed him on our English shores; Where should this Impe of my labour looke, but on your Ho: on whom my

hopes & heart haue euer looked, or to whom else should it flye for harbour and shelter, but onely to your Lord∣ship, who (in all the stormes and tem∣pests of these my weather beaten for∣tunes) haue so graciously and gene∣rously serued me both for shelter, and harbour, when the immerited malice of some, and the vndeserued ingrati∣tude of others haue denied it me; The which yet I speake and remember, more out of sensibility to my selfe, hen any way out of passion, much lesse of Enuie to them, as resting contented with this resolution, to keepe the griefe thereof to my selfe, to leaue the shame to them, and to giue the thankes and glory to your Honour.
As this Booke of Marande is curi∣ous, so he made his Dedication there∣of, wherefore led by the fame, and

lustre of his example, I could doe no lesse then immitate him herein; for as he directed it to the Cardinall of Ri∣chelieu; So your Lordships Merits, and my dutie, enforce me to inscribe it to your Honour, who are as much the Cardinalls equall in Vertues, as by many degrees his superiour in bloud and extraction.
And although I well know, that shall rather wrong mine Author, then right my selfe, to erect or proffer any Pagerike (to his Merits and Iudge∣ment) on this his Booke; because of it selfe i sufficiently peformes and acts that part: Yet when your Lord∣ship leasure and pleasure shall bo∣row so much time from your great and weighty ffires of the State, to giue it to the perusll and contem∣plation of this his Booke; I doubt

not but you will then see and ac∣knowledge, that Marande herein, as another Cornelius Agrippa, learnedly fights against the Vanitie of Humane Sciences,; and as a second Montaigne iudiciously contests against the poy∣son of our hearts, I meane against our intemperate (and therefore our pernicious) Passions.
For in this worke of his (as in a rich Treasurie and Sacrary of Nature) He (with a zeale and iudgement e∣uery way worthy of himselfe) laughes at the Vanitie of all Humane Artes, and Actions, as also generally at all the presumptuous, and profane professors thereof; and by reasons as cleare as the Sunne; passeth his iudgement on them, prouing GOD to bee the sole Author and Giuer of Wisdome; and that GOD, and none but GOD

ought to bee the onely obiect of our desires and affections. Here hee hath deuested and stript our passions naked, and curiously delineated and depointed them to vs in their true co∣lours, and naturall deformity. Heere he hath taught vs to beleeue, and our thoughts and resolutions to know, that exorbitant Ambition prooues most commonly the bane of our hearts, the poyson of our mindes, and the Arch-Enemie, and Traytor to our owne fortunes and flicitie. Here hee hath cu∣riously arraigned, and anatomized the power, and functions of the Sen∣ses, and shewed vs how violently and maliciously they euery moment con∣spire to corrupt our bodies, and to be∣tray our soules to sinne, and voluptu∣ousnesse. Here he hath brought home to our Vnderstanding, and Iudgement,

what power our soules haue ouer our bodies, and God ouer our soules, and that our bodies can expect no true tranquillity, or felicity here on Earth, except our soules doe first fetch it from Heauen, and deriue it from God. And here hee hath crowned Reason to be the Queene of our soules, and adop∣ted Vertue to bee no lesse then a Prin∣cesse and Daughter of Heauen, and taught vs how tenderly and religi∣ously we ought to loue either, and ho∣nour both of them, sith thereby, they will then infallibly prooue the two spirituall guides to conduct vs to true happinesse in this life, and consequent∣ly to bring vs to true felicity and glory in that to come.
Which considered; As also that such is the vniuersall iniquity of our times, & the generall deprauation and

corruption of our liues and manners, that through the darke cloudes of our humane Vanitie, and Ambition, we many times cannot see Reason for Pas∣sion, nor permanent Felicitie, for tran∣sitory Delights, and Pleasures. And therefore that the World (or rather the Courts of Kings and Princes, which is the pride and glory thereof, very often vseth vs not as a Lady of Honour, but as a deboshed Strumpet or Courtisan; who many times stran∣gleth vs, when shee makes greatest shew to embrace and kisse vs, and the which in that regard and con∣sideration I may pertinently and pro∣perly parallell to the Panther, whose skinne is faire, but his breath infecti∣ous. Therefore out of the zeale of my best prayers, and the candour and integrity of my best seruice and wi∣shes,

eternally desiring and wishing, that your Lordships prosperities and Honours may bee as infinite as your Vertues and Merits, and as immor∣tall, as you are mortall; I hope, and implore, that your Honour will please to pardon this my presumption, for proffering vp this poore Epistle to your rich consideration; and for being so ambitious to make this vnworthy translation of mine soare so high as to your Honourable protection and pa∣tronage, in affixing, and placing your Noble name thereto, as a Stately Porch, or Front, to this rich and stately Temple of Vertue.
Not, but that I perfectly know that your Honour is plentifully and aboun∣dantly furnished with great variety of sweet preseruatiues, and sound, and sa∣lubrious Antidotes, both against your

owne humane passions, as also against the frownes, and flatteries of the world: But yet I could giue no satis∣faction to my selfe, before I had giuen this Booke the desired (though not deserued) honour to kisse your Lord∣ships hands; For the Transplantation thereof being mine, my Duty, and Ser∣uice prompted mee that I must needes direct and consecrate it to your Ho∣nour, as well by the right of a iust pro∣priety, as by the equity of a comman∣ding obligation, and therefore of a ne∣cessary consequence.
Againe, your Honour louing Vertue, and cherishing Philosophie, so tenderly and deerely in your selfe, I thought that others would be the sooner in∣duced and drawne thereto by the powerfull influence of your Example, and therefore, that the Dignity and

Lustre of your name, would serue as a sure pasport to make this Booke passe current, with the different affections, pallates, and censures of his Readers whom now it goes foorth to meete with. In which regard I hold it more presumption in me toward your Ho∣nour, then neglect towards them, to make this your Epistle serue likewise for them, as being equally resolued, neither to court their fauours, nor to feare their reprehensions
And heere before I shut vp this my Epistle; I beseech your Honour to bee pleased farther to vnderstand, that in this Translation I haue sometimes bor∣rowed from the letter, to giue to the sense, by adding voluptuousnesse to pleasure, shewe to apparance, and af∣fliction to euill, or the like; A liberty which I hold tolerable in a modest

Interpreter; As also I haue sometimes added griefe, to paine, although ac∣cording to the rules and grounds of Logicke, I know that the last hath re∣ference to the body, and the first to the Soule: But I did it purposely to make it speake the more significant and ful∣ler English; because your Honour knowes so well, as no man better; that as other Languages, so English hath her peculiar Idioms, and proper phrases and Accents, which may but (yet in my poore opinion and Iudgement) ought not to be omitted or neglected.
I will no farther vsurpe on your Lordships patience, but will leaue this Booke, to his fortune, and my selfe to your wonted Honourable fa∣uour; So wishing all encrease of Earthly happinesse, and heauenly fe∣felicity

to your Honour, to your Ho∣nourable, and most vertuous Coun∣tesse, and to those sweet and Noble young Plants your Children. I will liue and dye in the resolution, euer to be found
