FOrasmuch as of late, an honest Matron a South-hamshyre VVoman, was desirous to haue con∣ference with me beeing a Suffolke man, to heere my mind concerning making of whitmeate, after the manner vsage and fashion of Suffolke where I was borne, albeit for forty and seauen yeeres passed, I haue beene and still am inhabiting & resident in this Coun∣tie of South-ham. For that mine aunswers to her de∣maundes and questions therein, was so well liked of by them that were present at that time, and so accep∣tably taken among them all, that they very earnestlie required mee, to reduce all our communication then had betweene vs into wryting, to the end they might heere it the oftner, and theyr neyghbours myght also be pertakers thereof as well as they: which at theyr instant request I haue heere taken vppon mee to doo, more homelie then seemely to satis-fie their desires, & also to auoyde idlenes, which folkes in age bee sundry times much giuen vnto. And because also I am vn∣apt to doo any good labour or worke, and nowe none other thing in effect can doe but onely write, I haue written this simple quire rudely penned, and dedicate the same generally to all good huswiues in South-hamshyre. Humbly desiring thē all to beare me good will for my dooing thereof, seeing willingly I will de∣serue,

none other at their handes. Fully trusting, that the mirth and recreation that they shall take, by the reading or hearing thereof: shal minister occasion of further profit to encrease amongst them. And to withdraw them from dumpes and sullen fantasies (be∣ing a cōmon disease amongst women) to bee the quic∣ker spirited, the better and the liuelier occupied, and the lustier stomaked in all their busines, as well in white∣meate making, as in all other their huswifelye doo∣ings. And thus wyshing all them to beare wyth my weakenes, and to accept my good will, in this my rude dooing. I beseeche almighty God sende them heere good life and a ioyfull ending.
