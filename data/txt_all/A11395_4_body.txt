Sacvilus Comes Dorsetius.
Vas lucis Esto decor Musis.
Sacris Musis celo deuotus.



NOt with-out Error, and apparant Wrong
To Thee, the Muses, and my Self (the most)
Could I omit, amid this Noble Hoast
Of learned Friends to Learning, and our Song,
To muster Thee; Thee, that hast lov'd so long
The sacred Sisters, and (sad-sweetly most)
Thy Self hast sung (vnder a fayned Ghost)
The tragik Falls of our Ambitious Throng.
Thearfore, in honour of Thy younger Art,
And of the Muses, honour'd by the same,
And to express my Thankfull thoughts (in part)
This Tract I sacre vnto SACKVIL's Name,
No less renown'd for Numbers of Thine Owne,
Than for thy love to Other's Labours show'n.
