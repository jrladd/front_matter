Right Honourable,
FOr many ages past it hath been a custome amongst these who have endeavoured to leave to posterity any of their Labours, to Dedicate them to some eminent
 Personage, partly to expresse their grati∣tude for benefits received, and partly to procure with the Readers a more easie acce∣ptation of the Work, and a more firm pro∣tection for it from the reproachfull tongues of malicious censures which no age hither∣to ever wanted. Among the sage sayings of Solon, being an ancient Philosopher of Athens, this is continually to be born in minde, that he only did glory of the good he received by his endeavours and study; the which Philosopher was a Heathen man: I would we Christians could follow the like example, but I fear most in our age neither return thanks for what they re∣ceive, nor apply themselves to study any good, nay rather, there be some will speak evil of them which apply their study to the knowledge of their Profession, and espe∣cially the Professours of Arts. But in part being sensible of Your Honours inge∣nuity, and so much a friend and lover of Vertue and Learning, I did make this bold attempt, which I hope Your Wisdome will be pleased to pardon, this did the more
 encourage me to enterprise it. For I do ingeniously confesse that I have not thought this Labour of mine fit or worthy to be perused of Your Honour, by reason of my own inability, who am altogether insufficient to perform any thing suitable to the acce∣ptance of Your Honour. It was not the affectation of any popular praise, but an honest zeal to benefit my Country, which begot in me a desire to publish this Work; and in the next place I perceived in my self a certain earnest willingnesse which I have alway had to commend some piece of service to Your Honour, this meeting together did induce me and re-inforce my over-presum∣ptuous determination with such a bold con∣fidence, as it were, to rush into Your pre∣sence, and to demand, without any shew of merit, Your Honours most favourable Protection, that this Book of my Labours may runne under Your Patronage. The Lord God, who hath made Your Honour an Instrument to work the advancement of his Glory, the furtherance and propagation
 of good Learning, protect, guide and blesse You with all successe in this world, and eter∣nall happinesse in his Kingdom.
