I Would have you know, that I love and honor you beyond ex∣pression and shall serve you in Art and Nature to my power, I have presumed to make you one in the number of my Noble Patrons, because I hear the wickedness of some Pulpit Polititi∣ans incessantly rageing against my person which they never saw, nor perhaps will see, these sophistical Sicophants contend against me continually with bitter hatred, envy and Malice, without any provocation on my part
one very proudly with a full mouth and loud voice aspersed me with Atheisme in St. Pauls Church in his morning Sermon the eight of May, before the Lord Mayor and others, A∣monst a promiscuous people, Railing against the Rosie Crucians, who Art and Nature uni∣ted, Others in Coffee discourse and stinking smoak of Tobacco did fill the ears of the Ig∣norant with my infamy others in publique and private assemblies, I hear do instigate the Dukes Princes and Peers of England &c against me, But my Religion being published, I would have you know my Philosoply is to know God himself, the worker of all things, & io pass into him by a whole Image of likeness (as by an Essential Contract and bond) where∣by we may be transformed and made as God, As the Lord spake concerning Moses, saying, I have made thee the God of Pharoah, this is the true Rosie Crucian Philosophy of wonder∣ful works, that they understand not, the Key thereof is the intellect: for by how much high∣er things we understand with so much the sublimer vertues are we endowed, and so much greater things do work, and that more easily and efficatiously But our intellect being included in the Corruptible flesh, unless it shall exceed the way of the flesh and obtain a pro∣per
Nature, cannot be united to these vertues (for like to like) And is in searching into the Rosie Crucian secrets of God and Nature altogether in efficatious; for it is no easie thing for us to ascend to the Heavens, for how shall he that hath lost himself in Morral Dust and ashes, find God. How shall he apprehend spiritual things that is swallowed up in flesh and bloud, can man see God and live, what fruit shall a grain of Corn bear if it be not first dead, for we must dye, I say dye to the world, and to the flesh, and all sences and to the whole man Animal, who would enter into these closets of secrets, Not because the body is seperated from the soul, but because the soul leaves the body, of which death S. Paul wrot to the Collossians: ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ: And elsewhere he speaks more clearly of himself, I know a Man, whe∣ther in the body or out of the body I cannot tel, God knows, caught up unto the third heaven &c. I say by this death pretious in the sight of God we must dye which happens to few: and not always, for very few whom God loves, and are vertuous are made so happy. And first those that are born, not of flesh and blood, but of God? secondly those that are dignified by the blessed assistance of Angels and Genii
the Power of Nature Influence of Planets, and the Heavens and vertues of the figures and Ideas at their birth, now this I humbly intreat you, that you be not mistaken concerning me as if I at any time having received such di∣vine things should boast of them to you, or should arrogate any such thing to my self, or could hope to have them granted to me, Al∣though I have hitherto kept my self unmarry∣ed and free from the company of a woman, yet I have been a souldier following the Ar∣mies of the King, and in other Countries con∣secrated with mans bloud, and exposed to all the blasts of inconstant fortune, & being cros∣sed in my flesh in the world and worldly afairs and therefore could not obtain the sublime Gifts of the Immortal God. But I would be accounted a director, who always waiting at the dores shews to others which way they must go, And here I present my self your most hum∣ble servant and honourer
