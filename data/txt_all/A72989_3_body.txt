SIR.
IF Elisha were at a stand, when hee considered what the good Shuna∣mite had done for im, that hee askes2 Kings 4.13.. What to bee done againe for her? sAnd Ahasuerus for Mor∣decay,
when hee had recea∣ved a good turne from him that hee saiesEsther. 6.3., What hath beene done to him for this? How much more maie I saie of you, you have been beneficiall to mee from my Youth, what du∣tie and service shall J re∣turne to you againe? J confesse that if there bee anie thing in these my weake labours that maie deserue acceptance, you maie justlie challenge it as your owne, Without whose bountie I had not lived in the Univer∣sity, nor attained to that small measure of knowledge that J have. And therefore (be∣ing able to doe nothing else)
J commit this Sermon to your Patronage and protection, and your selfe, your fruitfull Vine, and Olive branches to the pro∣tection of the Almighty, de∣siring him to give you the bles∣sings of his Right hand, and of his left, to fill you with the blessing of grace heere, and of glorie hereafter.
