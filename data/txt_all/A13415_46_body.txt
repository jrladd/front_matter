GReat Queene, I haue with paines and labour tooke
From out the greatest Booke this little Booke.
And with great Reuerence I haue cull'd from thence,
All things that are of greatest consequence.
And though the Volumne and the Worke bee small,
Yet it containes the summe of all in ALL.
To you I giue it, with a heart most feruent,
And rest your humble Subiect, and your Seruant.
