MAdam, after all the admired wits of this excellent age, which haue laboured in the sad complaintes of faire and vnfortunate Rosamond, and by the excellence of in∣uention, haue sounded the depth of her sun∣dry passions: I present to your Ladiship this Epistle of hers to King Henry, whom I may rather call her louer then be∣loued. Heere must your Ladiship behold variablenes in resolution: woes constantly grounded: laments abruptly bro∣ken off: much confidence, no certainty, wordes begetting teares, teares confounding matter, large complaints in little papers: and many deformed cares, in one vniformed Epi∣stell. I striue not to affect singularity, yet would faine flie imi∣tation, and prostrate mine owne wants to other mens perfec∣tions. Your iudiciall eye must modell forth what my penne hath layd together: much would shee say to a King, much would I say to a Countesse, but that the method of my Epi∣stle must conclude the modestie of hers: which I wish may recommend my euer vowed seruice to your honour.
