My honored Lord,
I Know not where to find a fit∣ter Patron for tears than your Lordship, the constant Series of whose happie daies, hath been an exact pattern of true Piety, and but one intire Oblation of fincere Devotion: Greatness and goodness are the best suppor∣ters
of decaying Holiness; by the one she is defended from suffering ill, by the other in∣couraged in doing well. These high and happy Ornaments, together with my near∣ness of blood unto your Honors nearest rela∣tion; and mine infant education in that gratious Family (to which (as to the happy instruments) I thankfully ascribe my first ingraftings into Christ) are strong perswasions to invite me to presume upon your Honors Patronage of this small tract, and humbly to present you with a tast of such wholsome fruits, as (by divine in∣crease) have had their growth from those precedent blossoms. If ever kneeling were in season, now is the needfull time, when there is not onely wrath gone out from the Lord against us, but even the blood, Vialls of his fiercest wrath are daily powred down upon us. I willingly confess my self to have been too deep a sharer in those grievous sins, which have inforced these heavy judge∣ments; what I cannot recall, I desire hear∣tily to bewail, and (as a true signe of mine unfeigned sorrow) according to the mea∣sure of my weak abilities, have penn'd these following lines: accept of them I beseech you, as humbly devoted to your honors ser∣vice; and read them as the disturbed noti∣ons
of my distracted meditations. That ho∣ly Providence which hath directed their ends, will (I trust) supply their defects; even this the least of graines (by that mer∣cy) may become a fruitfull tree, and branch it self into matter of commemorati∣on to the learned, of instruction to the igno∣rant, of help to the weak, of comfort to the willing, of joy to the good, of terror to the bad, of happiness (I trust) to all that are di∣rected to it, and especially unto their soules that stand in greatest need of comfort from it.
I shall not presume to inlarge my self with wast expressions, because I know your Lordships more weightie affairs will not admit of such fruitless indeavours; I shall now onely crave your Honors leave, to end with Orisons; as you have been both holy in your lives, so may you be happy in your deaths, blessed in your memorialls; may those hopefull pledges of your loves be faithfull earnests of your joyes, and future branches of the Churches Peace; may they all (by your examples) go on cheerfully, and joyfully, in those pathes of Piety which lead to rest and quietness, that their seed∣time being sorrow, their harvest may be joy, that all tears may be wip'd from their
eyes, all sorrowes from their hearts; This is (my honored Lord) the most affectionate desire, as a kinsman, the most zealous as a Christian, of
