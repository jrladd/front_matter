MY lorde, hauyng frō my youth in memorie the precepte of A∣pelles, moste excellent Painter of his tyme, who commaunded his Prentices not to passe one daie, without drawyng of a line, to the ende to keepe them in breath and continuance (as doth the Hunter his Greybound) he semeth by that precept to shewe how greate idlenesse is to bee auoided, and how greate is the losse of tyme, to leaue the exercise of trauaill. And therefore, not to transgresse this precepte in these tumul∣tuous and turbulente tymes, composed of more then ciuill warres in the bowells of Fraunce, J haue addressed my self for the auoidyng of J∣dlenesse, to drawe my line vpon an humble and lowe subiect, to make a discourse of domesticall Housbandrie, and to she we how a diligent man maie of one little somme, drawe greate gaines by honest meanes. VVhich doyng, J greately
recreate my spirites emong my bookes, and for∣get a greate part of my sorrowfull thoughtes of these troublous tymes. And for asmuche as J knowe, that after long practise of Armes, and the greate trauaile whiche you haue had there∣in, the trauaill of letters shalbee greatly delec∣table vnto you, whē with equall pase, you ioyne wisedome with magnanimitie, I haue taken vpon me the boldnesse, to present vnto you this my little labour, by the readyng whereof you maie take one hower of recreation. I haue ad∣dressed this little Housbandrie in sutche order that the practise beyng therein well instructed in buiyng, and conseruatiō of thynges bought, with discrete distribution of the same, maie as∣sure hymself to lacke no merchantes. This little discourse, is of the tyme of the troubles of the yere 1567. before that the winde Caecias drew the Cloude of troubles into the Countries of Poictu and Lodunoys, where I appoin∣cted the marchant to make his em∣ploit, as shalbe seen in the readyng.
