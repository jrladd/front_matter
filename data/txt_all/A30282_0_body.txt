Gentlewomen,
THese Lines do not vainly design to adorn your Names; but are very uprightly meant to defend my own, from
one of the blackest Reproaches. Even loathsome Ingratitude. I have bid them tell all they meet, that You were, for some (black) years together, my noblest Gaia's: And your Houses, my sweet Homes. That I am not Un∣thankful, though I am Insol∣vent. That I am not Insolvent neither, if Prayers do discharge Debts.
I do continue my pleasant Hope of your Persons Reconciliation un∣to God: And my Prayers for your Dearest Relatives: Beseech∣ing the Father of Glory, to make his own Love, the Reward of Yours unto me. And if it he his blessed pleasure, to make these very Leaves bear some Fruit unto your Souls

Be it freely said, as far as I know my self, I am neither Proud nor Ashamed of them. Not Proud; for I am aware how my imperfections do Blemish them. Not Ashamed; for I am told, God hath Blessed them; and I am made to believe, that he will Bless them. That as they are not Beautiful, so neither shall they be Barren, as Rachel. But Fruitful, though Blear-Eyed as Leah.
I have told you some Years ago, that I Preached for the Sal∣vation of Plow-Boys and Milk-Maids, as well as Lords and Ladies. And if I did not, I should never expect to do so much upon them by Rhetorical Polite∣ness,
as by Gospel Plainness. Honey Dews be sweet to the Tast, but they miserably blast the Corn. Delights of Fancy, hinder Wounds of Heart. This is still my Thought.
And if you are still the Chri∣stians that I once knew you, I am sure you will welcome Plain∣est Gospel. 'Tis Gospel I do present you, and in Dress as homely as I heretofore used among you. I am not now first to crave a Blessing upon it; but shall ever continue craving it: And particularly a Blessing to your selves, and to the Olive-Plants about your Tables.
Clare-House, in Drury-Lane, Lon∣don, Dec. 11. 1689.
