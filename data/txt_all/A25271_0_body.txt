Dear Jack,
WHEN I had finisht this little Piece, I was thinking what Duke, Marquess, Earl, Lord, Knight, Squire or Gentleman to De∣dicate it to; but hearing thou wert come to Town from thy Fathers Paternal Seat of Fled-wit-Hall, I laid aside my thoughts of such designs, and to thy own judicious self Present this Poem.
Ah Jack! those glorious Times are over, when thou and I were Chums together at Brazenose College in Oxford, when we valued Tutors, Proctors, or Vice-chancellors no more than a Vint∣ner does a Proclamation against French Wines. When others were studying or making Declama∣tions in the Schools, we were Refreshing our Un∣derstanding with the Juice of the Grape at the Crown; and I'll say that for thee, thou didst use to be so Witty after the second Bottle, and hadst such Magnificent Puns, such Exalted Clinches,

such Caterquibbles and Cunundrums, as would have serv'd to have set up half a Dozen Fourth-Rate Poets.
Since our Parents, our Destinies, our Fate, or what you please to call it, design'd us for the study of the Law, after which, tho we have Rode Whip and Spur, we are never like to overtake, and therefore are resolv'd never to break our Brains with Cook upon Littleton, Plowden, Keeble, or Fitzherbert: No, let the Fraterni∣ty prate their Unintelligible Jargon at the Bar till their Lungs ake, we have found out a more pleasant way of Living.—But let the worst come to the worst, 'tis at last but going to the Devil—Tavern I mean; And so dear Rogue, I wish thee a pleasant Term, with two Thousand Millions of Rich easy bleeding Clients, hoping, expecting, desiring, wishing, nay certainly believ∣ing you would have the same good Luck attend,
Dear Jack,
