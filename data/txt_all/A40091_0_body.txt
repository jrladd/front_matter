Gentlemen,
THE Sermon which, in complyance with your desire, I Preached to a very Nume∣rous Meeting of our Country-men; and the Publishing of which you since Requested, I here present you with: And God grant that this plain Dis∣course, Composed in a hurry of other Business, may in some Measure Con∣tribute

to the better observance of the great Praecepts of Fearing God, Ho∣nouring the King, and Loving one another, therein recommended and inforced. Then shall I have great cause to be thankful, as to Almigh∣ty God, for His Blessing on this en∣deavour, so to your selves, for put∣ting into my Hands this opportunity of doing good. I am
Gentlemen,
