TO the end that Artificers may attaine the perfection requi∣sit for the vse of the common∣wealth, me-thinketh (Catho∣tholike roiall Maiestie) a law should be enacted, that no carpenter should exercercise himselfe in any work which appertained to the occupation of an hus∣bandman, nor a tailor to that of an architect, and that the Aduocat should not minister Phisicke, nor the Phisition play the Aduocat, but ecah one excercise only that art to which he beareth a na∣turall inclination, and let passe the residue. For considering how base and narrowly bounded a mans wit is for one thing and no more, I haue alwaies held it for a matter certaine, That no man can be perfectly seene in two arts, without failing

in one of them: now to the end he may not erre in chusing that which fitteth best with his owne nature, there should be deputed in the common∣wealth, men of great wisedome and knowledge, who might discouer each ones wit in his tender age, and cause him perforce to studie that science which is agreeable for him, not permitting him to make his owne choice: whence this good would ensue to your states and signiories; that in them should reside the rarest artificers of the world, and their workes should be of the greatest per∣fection, for nought else than because they vnited art with nature. The like would I that the vniuersi∣ties of our kingdomes did put in practise, for see∣ing they allow not that a scholer should passe to another facultie, vnlesse he perfectly vnderstand the Latine tongue, they should haue also exami∣ners, to trie whether he who purposeth to studie Logick, Philosophie, Diuinitie, or the Laws, haue such a wit as is requisit for euery of these sciences, for otherwise, besides the dammage that such a one shall worke afterwards to the Common∣wealth, by vsing an art wherein he is not skilled, it is a greefe to see that a man should take paines, and beat his brains about a matter wherein he

cannot reape any aduantage. For that at this day such a diligence is not vsed, those vvho had not a wit fit for Diuinitie, haue destroied the Christian religion. So doe those who are vntoward for Phi∣sicke, shorten many a mans daies: neither pos∣sesseth the Legall Science that perfection vvhich it might receiue, because it is not made knowne, to what reasonable power the vse and interpreta∣tion of the laws appertaineth. All the antient Phi∣losophers found by experience, that where na∣ture doth not dispose a man to knowledge, it fal∣leth out a superfluous labour to toile in the rules of art. But none hath cleerely and distinctly deli∣uered vvhat that nature is vvhich maketh a man able for one science, and vncapable of another, nor how many differences of vvittes there are found in mankind, nor vvhat Arts or Sciences doe answer each in particular, nor by what tokens this may be knovvn, vvhich is the thing that most importeth.
These foure points (though they seeme vnpos∣sible) containe the matter vvhereof I am to en∣treat, besides many others appurtenant to the purpose of this doctrine, vvith intention that cu∣rious parents may haue an art & maner to disco∣uer

the vvit of their children, and may vveet hovv to set ech of them in hand with that science vvher∣in he shall principally profit. And this is an aduise vvhich Galen sayth vvas giuen his father, namely that he should set him to studie Phisicke, because for that science he had a singular vvit. By vvhich your maiestie shall vnderstand hovv much it im∣porteth the common-vvealth, that there be esta∣blished in the same a choice, and examination of vvits for the sciences, seeing frō the study vvhich Galen bestovved in Phisick, there ensued so great good to the diseased of his time, and he left so ma∣ny remedies in vvriting for the postèritie. Euen as Baldus (a notable man in profession of the lavves) vvhen he studied and practised Phisick, if he had passed further therein, vvould haue prooued but an ordinarie Phisitian, as he vvas not better, for that he vvanted the difference of vvit requisit for this science, but the lavves should haue lost one of the greatest helps that might be found amongst men for expounding them.
When I therfore purposed to reduce this nevv manner of Philosophie to art, and to proue the same in some vvits, I remembered my selfe of your Maiestie, as the best knovvne, and one, at vvhom

the whole world wondereth, beholding a Prince ofso great knowledge and vvisedome, of vvhome here we cannot conueniently entreat, the last chapter saue one is your conuenient place, where your Maiestie shall see the purport of your owne wit, and the art and learning vvherewith you vvould haue benefited your common-wealth if you had bene a priuat person, as by nature you are our king and souereigne.
