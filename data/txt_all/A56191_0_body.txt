GReat Britaines present Joy, her future Hope,
And Faiths Defender against Romes proud
Pope;
Vouchsafe to cast Your Gracious Princely eye
On these unpolish't Poems; which descry,
Refute some foule, grosse Errors, Practises
Of Romes false Church. By one short view of these,
Your Highnesse may conjecture of the rest,
And be stirr'd up for ever to detest
With greatest Zeale, Romes Errors, Blasphemies;
Which make good hearts with indignation rise
Against them. Great Jehovah Crowne and blesse
Your Highnesse with all kindes of Happinesse;
And, through Your Favour, make this PVRGE of use,
Sike Roman Soules to true Health to reduce.
So prayeth,
