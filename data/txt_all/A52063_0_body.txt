IT was the expectation that the
whole Kingdome had of your high
worth, and faithfull resolutions, to
reforme what was amisse both in
Church and State, which gave us
the confidence to present unto you
our former treatise. And now your
reall performance, and noble Actions tending to
the publicke peace and good, have added much
more chearefulnesse in our second addresse to∣wards
you; the rather, for that the cause in que∣stion




betweene us and the Remonstrant, about E∣piscopacy
and Liturgie, is a great part of that
worke to which God hath directed your present
consultations. Seeing therefore it belongs to you
next under God and his Majestie, to dispose and
order these things: Wee leave our endeavours at
your feete, beseeching you to consider, not onely
how we have vindicated our selves from the accu∣sations
of our adversarie, but more especially what
may bee gathered out of it for the advancement of
the reformation now happily begunne among us.
The Lord of life and glory bee a Sunne and shield
unto you.
