My LORD,
HE is a great Stranger in the World, who doth not know how Kind, Generous, and Charitable, Your Lordship has been to all the French Refugees in General, and in a Special Man∣ner to many of them, whom You have put in an Honourable Way of Serving at once His Ma∣jesty,
Your Lordship, and Themselves. And, in∣deed, My Lord, the Nobleness of Your Birth is Supported by the Greatness, and Solidity of Your Virtues; The Greatness of Your Titles and Dig∣nities Adorned with an Unparallel'd Conduct and Undaunted Courage; Your Conduct and Cou∣rage united to a Tender and Compassionate Ge∣nerosity towards the Unfortunate; and all these Indowments attended with a steady and unwea∣ned Constancy, which is the Proper Character of Great Souls.
And therefore, My Lord, the true Account of the Present Sufferings of the Protestants in France, which I give to this Nation, will, I hope, ob∣tain a Favourable Audience and Reception from Your Lordship, and You will undoubtedly Pity their Lamentable Case, as well as be Pleased to vouchsafe the Continuance of Your Protection to those who have both the Honour and Hap∣piness of being already sheltered under it. I am, My Lord, one of those who have obtained a great Share in Your Generous Liberality, and am very glad to have this Opportunity to Ac∣knowledge Publickly, how much I do Respect Your Person, Esteem Your Virtues, and am
Thankful for Your many Favours, which I find my self under an impossibility of Answering any other way than by being as long as I live,
My LORD,
