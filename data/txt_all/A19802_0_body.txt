DANAEVS mine Author, chose for ye Patrone of this his Treatise in La∣tine, a Gentlemā, Secretarie to the King of Fraunce. I, for my trāslatiō thereof into En∣glish, haue made choyse of you twaine, Gentlemen, as well as the other, and Secretaries, though not to a King, yet to a Personage of Honor next to a King: and in vertue, wisedome, zeale, grauitie, authoritie and knowledge so rarely furnished, as I would yt all Kings were. Your friendly curtesies towards me, deserue this and a farre more thankful re∣mēbraunce,

and the very title of this Pam∣phlet emboldened me, to woe you for par¦don, in thus farre presuming and aduen∣turing vpon your patience. I haue chosen, not the one, but both twaine of you, be∣cause firme, stedfast and perfect friendship cannot bee betweene either moe or lesse then twaine: and because also I am not ig∣norant, in what a sweete league of mutuall loue, and Christian sympathie, you twaine be linked together. Fare ye hartily well. 
At Butley in Chesshyre the 22. of Iuly. 1586.
