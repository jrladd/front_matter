Most High Most Illustrious Princes,
THAT I haue adventured in these vnfaithfull times, so full of suspition and danger, to passe (without leaue) your guardes, and to presse into your Presence, I most humbly craue pardon, having I confesse no other excuse

then that common one of the Countrie, it was out of my loue, out of my loyalty, for such (most gracious Q: Elizabeth) hath heeretofore your respect beene towards mee (farre vnworthy God knowes of a∣ny of the least favours from so Magnifi∣cent a Princesse) that ever since, I haue contended with my selfe, to adventure and Act something, that might haue pow∣er still to preserue me in your Royall Me∣morie, but albeit I had the will, I find my selfe wanting in my Abilitie. And most Illustrious, Prince Maurice, since I haue had sometime dependance on your Excel∣lence, I hold it my Dutie gratefully to repay, some part of what (I cannot say iniustly) I haue gained vnder you that is Observation, especially of the double dea∣ling, and cunning Iuggling of the Spaniard with all Nations. And since a little Treatise of a Spanish Consultation (whether really acted, or poetically faigned I know not) came to my hands, first written in Spanish, now by my selfe translated into English, onely for the behoofe and loue I beare as∣well to England my natiue Countrie, as

to the Netherlands. I haue sent it abroad, good it may doe, hurt it cannot. Abundans. cautela non nocet: heerein you shall perceiue the Curtaine (though not fully) drawne, from before the Spaniard, that the world may for certaine see, that hee is not so beautifull, as many of our English (who so long haue doated on him) would make him to be, nor on the other side so terri∣ble, that your Dutch neede to feare him, how grimme & terrible soeuer he lookes vpō them. But your Excellence knoweth him (as we say) Intus & in cute; & can limne to the life better, then any penne in the world can decipher him, wherefore I vrge him no farther. I onely leaue it to the world to thinke of (since hee aymeth at the Monarchy of the West, euery thing els being to little for his Ambitiō (whose great Grand-sire the Earle of Halspurge was within these ninescore yeares, of as mean estate and revenue, as an ordinary knight of England,) how much I say, concernes it England, and your vnited Provinces, to hold fast each by either, which now by all meanes he laboureth to part and divide,

not vnmindfull of a Matchivillian and old Maxime;Divide, et Impera. But I trust Almighty God (as hee hath already begun) will open the eyes of all Christian Kinges and Prin∣ces, in time not onely to prie into, but ef∣fectually to oppose, these his immense and ambitious designes, which else in time may fall heauie vpon our children and posteritie, I end; humbly beseeching the King of Kings and Kingdomes, the Almighty Lord of Hoastes: Most High, Most Illustrious Princes, to protect the persons of your selues and children, with his grace to multiplie your Honors and Dignities, foure-fold to restore your e∣states, and after many yeares to crowne you in Heaven, with the Diademes of Glorie and endles happines.
