THe consideration of your rare and incomparable Vertues, which are such Iew∣elles of estimation in the eyes and eares of your faithfull Subiectes, and the care how to continue and enioye them long, which is the study and practise of all them that truely honour you; hath con∣strayned me at this tyme (right excellent and famous Queene) to exceede the boundes of ordinarie loue, which is onelie but to please the eye, and to wade into the depth of intire affection, wherewith the heart may be often∣times quieted, but hardly throughlie satisfied, by reason

the conceite taketh so deepe an impression, and euery cause concerneth it so neerely, as, what with hazard of perill, and feare to forgoe, affection is so vehement, as nothing can goe beyond it.
Let then (most noble Queene) this my poore affecti∣on, carie that credite in your Princely minde, as your nature affoordeth to euerie louing Subiect, and let such account be helde of my earnest intent, as both the waigh∣tinesse of the cause, and circumstaunces of the whole con∣sidered, shall delyuer reason. I (in the meane time) shall continue in prayer, that long this Land may be partaker of your gratious presence, and the good will of euery true Subiect may be thankefully en∣tertayned.
