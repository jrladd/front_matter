May it please Your Majesty.
WITH the Most Humble, and Most Prostrate Submission, I lay at Your Feet this my Ende∣vour,
which though for its own worth it may justly be debarr'd such bold Approach∣es, yet for its Illustrious Subject, and most Stupen∣dious matter, will well be∣come Your Most August Presence.
That Elevated thought enforced this Addresse to Your Royal Hands: the Lustre of Your Son, Our Sacred Soveraign's Glory, being so Dazeling to the rest of the Weak-Sighted World, that it were a Presumptuous Vanity to
Court any other Eye then Your Self, the Fountain of this Marvellous Light.
In Your Blessed Womb, Heaven Treasured and Ma∣tured those before Ʋnre∣vealed Exaltations of Hu∣mane Nature, beyond all Her former most benigne and Industrious Excesses of Felicity; which while other Princes have stooped to by some Politique Observances, and Wooed their Difficult Scepters, it most officiously hath Bowed and Humbled it Self to Our Dread Sove∣raign,
and obsequiously sol∣licited His Acceptance.
May Your Majesty be Graciously pleased therein to imitate Him (who so much Resembles Your Self) by Vouchsafing a Recep∣tion to this Reflexe, but weak and imperfect Repre∣sentation of those Magnifi∣cences: Which as they did Primarily Proceed from Your Majesty, so ought they principally to return thither, to be the insepa∣rable and fruitful Blessings and Delights of Your Bo∣some.

God Almighty never cease such Rewards of Your most Celebrated Vertues here, and Crown them hereafter; when He shall after a long Train of Prosperity change these Temporal into Eternal Glories. So prayes
