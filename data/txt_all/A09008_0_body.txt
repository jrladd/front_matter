BVt that I hi∣therto haue mar¦ked excellent ba∣ron / bothe by phi¦losophers / lawe∣ers / orators / poe∣tis / and diuines / accustomably to haue ben vsed / that whan so euer any of them did either make worke / or translate any excel∣lent mans worke: are wont for ye de∣fence therof / exquisitely to chose som one well lerned or noble parsone / to whome they shulde vowe and dedi∣cate theyr laboure: I at this tyme

musyng to whome I shulde ascryue this my rude translation / shulde nat before many other haue chosen your excellence. Than if I vse an honest / olde / & approbate custome / who wyl blame me? If I chose an excellēt ler∣ned man (I meane your excellence) and borne of high blud / who wyl nat approue my doynge? If I dedicate my small peynes to you my especiall good lorde and patrone / who can re∣proue me? Nor the smalnes of this worke shall nat withdrawe me to as∣criue hit to your magnificēce: for of∣ten tymes in small and compēdious rules / are wount to be inclosed great wysedome and lernynge / as saythe Beroaldus in these verses:
Sunt hec parua quidem fatcor: sed magna subinde
Esse solent paruis deteriora bonis.
Hoc adamas / gemine{que} docent: que corpore parno
Oblectant reges / diuitibus{que} placent.
Nos contra horremus magnos persepe gygantes.
Terremur magnis sepe voluminibus.
And of a man of my degree and for∣tune / what other thynge myght be offered to your excellence so riche / so high in dygnite? Statius wryteth for Rutilius Gallus / 
Sepe deis hos inter honores.
Cespes / et exiguo placuerunt farra salino.
Farthermore if maister Agapetus abashed nat to wryte this his lyttell boke vnto ye emperour Iustinian / I wtout blame may dedicate ye same to your goodnes. I confesse hit a small thynge / but than I say hit is a boke of great wysedome and lernyng / cō∣teynynge all these preceptes / by the whiche nat onely a prince / but all o∣ther estates may lerne to do iustice / maye lerne howe by humanite and gentylnes to order theyr subiectes / ad seruauntes. Is this smalle boke

thā vnworthy to be moche made of? vnworthy to be dedicate to your ex∣cellence? vnworthy to be accepted? vnworthy often to be turned? Is it a lyght thynge for a prince / to lerne iustely howe to rule his people / and to tempre euery thynge by Iustice? Let them therfore that wyl dispreise this small worke bicause it is small / but my trust is / that your excellēce / nat consyderynge the smalnes ther∣of / but the brefe preceptis of greatte wysedome and lernynge therin con∣tryued: wyll nat only preyse hit / but also (by goddis grace) styll contynu∣ally ensewe the same. Thus I com∣mende  to your excellence / desy∣ryng your gētylnes gentylly (as ye be accustomed to do) to accept this my rude translacion.
