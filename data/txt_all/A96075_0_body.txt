Sir, Madam,
I Hold it an Heresie in Civility as wel as Re∣ligion, to divorce those whom GOD and their Loves have united,
Ex affectu om∣nes introdu∣cuntur nuptiae, Justin. cod. de Nupt. l. 26 not only in a neer Relation, but a more dear Affection. And since I am highly satisfied,
Par pari jun∣gatur conjux, quicquid im∣par diffider. that no Marriage is more amply expressive of sincere love, and reall complacency, then is Yours, which God hath blessed with a Diapason of Contents, I cannot but bespeak You to pardon me, while I conjoyn You in this Dedication, which tels the World, that it is much my ambition to
appear a friend to Your Vertues, and (in what I may) a requiter of Your Civilities. Accept therefore (my noble Friends) these Papers, not as in the least proportionate to the reall service I should do you, nor as clad in such Tissues of Language and florid Fancy, as would become me to prepare for entertainment of your curious eyes, but as an earnest of that great respect, which shall be ever owned due to You, from
Greenford this 30 of Novem. 1653.
Sir, Madam
