Beloved;
THe last and great temptation is over. You have been set in a late Declaration, I will not say like our great Master upon a pinacle of the temple; but like the Swine-herd of Stow upon Lincoln minster, and all the remaining husks, (for the mast is gone long since) you shall have and injoy, if &c. Is it not sad to consider that you are not only a covering to their eyes, that are filled with robbery, but that they should by the tender of toyes, and tristes, (which yet are not theirs to give) allure you into that confederacy, which may not only wound your consci∣ences, but stain your profession, with such a blot and dishonour as shall never be washed out; Honest Mephibosheths resigna∣tion is a much better resolution, Let them take all so that my Lord the King may but return in peace. How neer have you been to suffer by divers factions, and yet your lives and inte∣rests are maintained, perhaps that you might live to vindicate that which you helpt to destroy. Remember, O remember; Curse ye Meroz, yea curse bitterly, &c. Now consider how are the mighty fallen. Your words were more powerfull then the Soul∣diers swords, you foresaw not the event, (it seems you were no true prophets) and are now sorrowfull. Oh if you had known (God grant your ignorance may excuse) you would never have cried down the King as a Tyrant, to the ruine of him, his fa∣mily and kingly government. Well you have still the same wea∣pons, and the good old cause, the King and the Parliament laid before you; pray for it, plead for it, but curse no body, no not your enemies, persecuters and slanderers, that if it be the will of God, there may be a returning of our wandrings, and a heal∣ing of our errors, in the procuring of which you may assure your selves of the constant and fervent desires and prayers of
