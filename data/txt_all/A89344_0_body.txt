Most Honoured Sir,
SInce you care impos'd on me and the Clerk of the Assembly, the charge to peruse our Laws, and to reduce them into as good a Form, as our weak abilities could perform; I thought my self obliged to render you an accompt of our performance; which might, perhaps, have been better done, had not the Troubles of the Indians, and Quakers, and other emergent Occasions of the Publique, deâˆ£priv'd me of much of that time I had devoted to that most serious Imployment.
However, Sir, as they are (since the Assembly hath approv'd them, and Ordered them to be put in Print) I thought it my duty to Dedicate them to your Patronage, who, of the most and best of them, was the only Author.
Little addition there is to what your self had done in the time of your Government, only what vitious Excrescencies had grown in the body of them, by the corrupt humor of the times, we have throughly purg'd them of, that we might not any where leave unrazed the memory of our enforc'd Defection from his Sacred Majesty; for whom, your prudent care so long preserved the Countrey, both from the ruine we were almost brought to by that desperate Warr with Opechankevogh, whose Conquest (had not the Cloudiness of those times obscured the glory of it) could not have lost the esteem of being one of the most important Services, that, perhaps, had been rendred in many years before to the Crown.
But, Sir, you have not only done this, but also retein'd us in an inviolated obedience to his Majesty, that we were the last of his Subjects that necessity enforc'd from our duty, which was an Act of approved Loyalty, as the other was of gallant Bravery.
Sir, though the remoteness of this place, hath veild the glory of these, and other your Honourable Actions; yet I, and all that here with me were witnesses of them, must, and ever will, acknowledg that to you, next to his Majesties goodness, we owe both the Laws we Govern by, and the Countrey it self now Govern'd by those Laws: which truth, as a Publique Person, I must ever justifie; and, as a Particular one, confess my self by it oblig'd to be
Most Honoured Sir,
