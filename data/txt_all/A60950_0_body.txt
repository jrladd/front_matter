My Lord,
THough to prefix so great a Name to so mean a Piece, seems like enlarging the Entrance of an house, that affords no Reception: yet, since there is nothing can warrant the Pub∣lication of it, but what can also Command it; the Work must think of no other Patronage, then the same that a∣dorns, and protects its Author. Some inded vouch great Names, because they think they deserve, but I, because I need such: and had I not more occasion then many others, to see and converse with, your Lordships Can∣dour and proness to pardon, there is none had greater cause to dread your Judgment; and thereby in some part I venture to commend my own. For all know, who know your Lordship, that in a Nobler respect, than either that of Government, or Patronage, you represent and Head the best of Universities: and have Travelled over too many Nations, and Authors, to encourage any one that understands himself, to appear an Author in your Hands: who seldome read any Books to inform your self, but onely to countenance and credit them. But, my Lord, what is here Published, pretends no In∣struction,

but only Homage; while it teaches many of the World, it only describes your Lordship; Who have made the ways of Labour and Vertue, of doing, and doing Good, your Business and your Recreation, your Meat and your Drink, and, I may add also, your Sleep. My Lord, the Subject here treated of, is of that Nature, that it would seem but a Chimaera, and a bold Paradox, did it not in the very Front carry an Instance to exemplifie it; & so by the Dedication con∣vince the World, that the Discourse it self was not im∣practicable. For such ever was, and is, and will be the Temper of the generality of mankind, that, while I send men for Pleasure, to Religion, I cannot but expect, that they will look upon me, as only having a mind to be pleasant with them my self: nor are men to be Worded into new Tempers, or Constitutions: and he that thinks, that any one can perswade, but He that made the World, will find that he does not well un∣derstand it.
My Lord, I have obeyed your Command, for such must I account your Desire; and thereby Design, not so much the Publication of my Sermon, as of my Obe∣dience: for, next to the Supream Pleasure described in the ensuing Discourse, I enjoy none greater, then in having any opportunity to declare my self,
