Madame,
STRAYING I know not by what chance, in the most pleasant and delectable of all gardens (whose conti∣nuall spring and sweet smelling flowers, nei∣ther
 the extreamitie of Summer, nor colde of Winter, can any whit annoy: the sweet flow∣ers and simples where∣of, (remaining still the same) comfort all com∣mers, applyers, ga∣therers, distilling ver∣tue to all, yet loosing nothing of their for∣mer admirable excel∣lencie; still giuing, yet rich as before: often
 pulled, yet nothing missing) I happened heere and there on di∣uerse sorts, whose seue∣rall exceeding sweet∣nesse, forced mee to binde them togither. So that the more I ga∣thered, the greater my desire was: vntill at last, hauing gathered & bound togither this pleasant Nosegay (the surpassing sweetnesse
 whereof ouer-cloying me) I was glad to get mee gone, not staying for any moe. Which I offer vnto your La∣dyship: not that it can any way ballance your Ladiships vndeserued curtesies, long since be∣stowed: but onely as a poore token of my loue, and hatred to all-abhorred ingratitude, Wishing that it may
 alwaies smel sweet vn∣to your Ladyshippe, chiefly againe and a∣gaine, redoubling the super-aboundant vi∣gor and efficacie ther∣of by the secret work∣ing and instigation of your Iesus immortall Spirit, in the houre of dissolution: that ther∣by resting most assured whom you haue ser∣ued, you may ioyfully
 leaue this poore pil∣grimage and vaile of misery, for that eter∣nall, new, glorious, cae∣lestiall Ierusalem, the felicity whereof, can∣not be knowne, vntill possessed.
