May it please Your Grace,
SPrings tend not more naturally unto their cen∣ter, then this Discourse to Your Grace, through whose courteous Invitation

I have left my native Soil, to end the remainder of my days, in the Service of my most Gracious King, in this his Kingdom, under Your Graces Favour and Prote∣ction. This Nation, my Lord, which is so sensible in its whole and in each indi∣vidual parts of those vast and innumerable Benefits and Advantages which it has receiv'd from the be∣nign'd influences of your Graces wise, prudent, and most politick Government, that in a due sense of Grati∣tude

sends up its daily Prayers to Heaven for Your Graces Preservation.
That I might not remain useless during my stay in this City, till Your Grace were pleas'd to appoint me a fix station, where I might be most serviceable in my capa∣city, I thought it convenient to employ my hours of lei∣sure in some particular, which might tend to a ge∣neral good.
The Crudities of the Ri∣ver

Waters in these parts might have been a proper Theme to insist upon: but it requiring peradventure a further Scrutiny then the spare time which I may en∣joy here would permit me to enter upon; I diverted my thoughts on a Spring of Mi∣neral Waters, at a small di∣stance from this place, the Subject of this Discourse.
Be pleased, my Lord, to protect, these few Sheets under Your Graces Favour, together with their Subject

the Spring by encouraging the search after some other Head, so much elevated a∣bove this, as may place it beyond the encroachment of common Waters on its Pre∣rogatives; that amongst all the wonderful goods and ad∣vantages which this Na∣tion has receiv'd at Your Graces Hands, there may be added Your Graces mi∣raculous production of a Spring of Health, from the midst of insalubrious Wa∣ters.

If in this first attempt, I am so happy as to please Your Grace, I have my end, which shall never pre∣sume beyond the bounds of being
(May it please Your Grace)
