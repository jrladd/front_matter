WHereas of late I received letters from som of you, wherein I read that name, which is as an oyntment poured out, causing the parties to whom it appeares, to fall in love therewith, carrying in it a spirit which can produce a reall presence, where there is an absence in bodily respects: and that not only in respect of divine nature simply considered, but also in point of Christian relations and respects, which is never destitute of humane, considered therein, and con∣versant therewith; otherwise, the goings forth of the spirits of the Saints could not be peculiar, and distinct from that of the wicked, which the di∣vine and omnipotent power reachethalso; There∣fore the Saints communicate in prayers, intercessi∣ons, supplication, & giving of thanks, so as a stran∣ger cannot intermeddle therewith, nor with their joy arising there-from.
And whereas some of you requested mee to

write unto you concerning the opening of a por∣tion of the word of God, which some years agoe urged my spirit, and put me into travell to bring forth but Satan hindered: Your letters visited me immediately upon the employment of my spirit in another portion of the word of God, which was then the proper strength I walked by, which made me to think it might be a refreshment unto you; which I could not lay aside, till God opened ano¦ther into which I might enter. Neither could wee depart from that place till the cloud removed, in∣so-much that I was forcibly constrained to employ my selfe about the instruments and services of the Tabernacle, to bring the sight thereof unto your selves in the first place.: And so made bold to set upon the writing of it, yea when others slept, be∣eause of my daily occasions; and when it was writ, I was much urged to endeavour the printing of it, that so it might come to more view: and being it was written in hast, and so would be tedious to read, I consented thereto; although there is nothing which I have spoken in publique since I saw your faces, but I could as freely commend it unto you. The occasion of the Ark pitching upon this place, which me-thinks looks like Elim in this wildernes, where there are twelve fountains of water, and 70.

Palm-trees, Numb. 33. 9. For our Apostle writes to the twelve Tribes, out of which we may draw plenty of the water of life: and there is perfection and fulness of palm trees, from which you may ga∣ther plenty of branches, to carry as signes of victo∣ry, not only of the abatement of that deluge of wrath, but also of overcoming by faith this pre∣sent world, for Faith is the victory whereby we do it. I say the occasion of the Arke pitching on this place was this;
We being met together to exercise our selves in the word of God and prayer, there was one who occasionally named this Chap, and read some part of it, in which action the scope of it seemed to o∣pen it self unto me; and to deale plainly and faith∣fully with you, my thoughts had never been for∣merly upon any part of it, so as intending to ex∣presse my selfe from it, but only as I have read it as other histories and writings of the word of God.
Whereupon my spirit was moved presently to speak from it what I did receive, and immediately uttered to the same effect, which I have in the fol∣lowing lines commended unto you, out of my love unto you, and engagements beyond my ex∣pression, moved hereunto by your loving & chri∣stian-like letters, joyning themselves unto me like

Philip to the Chariot of the Eunuch, upon the de∣livery of it, encouraging my heart hereunto, which otherwise I had not takenupon me, lest it should have been thought a worke not worthy your ac∣ceptance.
But if you please to take the payns carefully to peruse it, I doubt not but it may give occasion of further thoughts unto you, then can be expressed in so small a volume; it may point (as with a finger) unto such things, as to write them the world would not contayn the books, the matter being of an infinite and an eternall nature, holding proportion with Melchisedech, who is without be∣ginning of dayes, or end of life. Therfore the world cannot contain it, unto whom this Scripture, as un∣der the motion of the cloud hath brought us, where we now abide, Heb. 7. For other place of our a∣bode, I may not signifie unto you; for some of our Neighbours have professed before the state of England, that the place of our bodily aboad is a non ens, that it hath no being: and others have af∣firmed that we are no people, not affording us so much as God gives to the Conies, which he calls a people, though a small people, yet they make their abode in the Rocks; and it is that rock of Ages, in whom only we desire to be found, & to take these

courtesie a patiently, as we do other kindnesses under which we yet abide, as in that point of ba∣nishment, only for such matters as in the follow∣ing speech we tender unto you.
Whereas you make mention of a Sermon prea∣ched from the Prophesie of Isaiah, speaking of the new heavens and the new earth, in the restauration of the Church; from which it was concluded, that such an excellent estate of Religion was to come hereafter, as never yet appeared, which some could not be satisfied in such Exposition or Conclusion: we see it to be not onely the common doctrine, but deceipt also of the world, not to give Christ a pre∣sent being, but hold men in expectation, as in the ancient Jews, who when he appears, seek his ruine, and that is the top of that spirit.
By new heavens and new earth in that place, we understand the state of Christ, or of that holy un∣ction or Christianity, that as the visible heavens & earth (to which he alludes) make a compleat and fruitfull world, even so do God & man in Christ make one durable and fruitfull condition, wherein righteousness dwells, as our Apostle witnesseth, which according to that law of the spirit, is ador∣ned with infinitely more relations, operations, and vertues then all the Creations in Heaven and Earth can set forth, which hee calls new,

not with respect unto these visible, but with respect unto that oldnesse of the letter, and admi∣nistrations according to the carnall Command, wch the Apostle calls old, because it is weak, fading, and ready to vanish away, and so is called the olde heavens, & the old earth that passe away, and that Ministry which exerciseth according to that, being ever conscientious of the present want of the glo∣ry and power of God in it, is constrained to form a time to come, which will attayn thereunto, or else it could gayn no acceptation in the world, but through Conception of hopes which are like the spiders web.
But the Ministry of the spirit according to that word of life, gives present being to the thing it expresseth, or else it carries not in it that power of God, the nature of whose word was ever so to do, and ever will be, and they are sayd to be new.
First, because of the ground thereof, for they re∣new themselves only by meanes of that which is an∣tiquity it selfe; for in the unity of God and man in the faith of Christ, the spirit of God being an infi∣nite fountaine, must ever give out it selfe by new operations, and not as one in want, to gather up a∣gaine the same thing in all respects considered, in which he hath been formerly exercised, no more then

a living fountaine gathers up the same water al∣ready vented to distribute it againe: and by reason of this infinite and eternity of spirit and life, the soule of a Christian, or this spirituall state and con∣dition in Christ, is in an eternall act of newnesse, like that new commandement that the Apostle writes of, and that old commandement which is from the beginning.
Secondly, they are new according their manner of being; for in what point of the Gospel soever Christ is made, it stands of as firm grounds of aboad, and as impossible to remove as heaven and earth: and we know that the very nature of the earth establisheth it selfe in its repayring unto the Center, in such sort hath God established the state of his sons & daugh∣ters; and yet when another point of the Gospel is made manifest, it is upon like ground, but to be ta∣ken in as differing a respect, and variety of furni∣ture and glory, as though it were another world, and so in every appearance of Christ, it hath his whole and compleat condition comprehended and compri∣zed in the same, as the whole world is in the hea∣vens and the earth, for Christ, or christianity is ne∣ver piece-meal'd.
As for example; If he be revealed as Father, with respect to a Son, it hath the whole furniture

of heaven and earth, the whole estate of Christ, as Husband with respect to a Spouse, there is the furniture of the whole world; for it is Christ who is all in all, if as King, with respect to sub∣jects, there is whole Christ, all christianity is to be found there imbodyed: and so in all points whatso∣ever, else Christ is not preached as all in every thing; no office or operation of Christ, but it hath in it whole Christ, and so ought to be revealed, else we preach a humane Christ, and not divine, a car∣nall Christ, and not a spirituall.
And where it is sayd, the new heavens and the new earth which I will make; the word may as truly be read, which I do make, or which I have made: For it is Jesus Christ yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever.
So that as the state of Christ which is the eter∣nall Son, must needs remayn, so shall the fruitfull condition of this estate, therefore their name and their seed must remayn, like heaven in name or au∣thority, for operation or power: and as the earth, to conceive & bring forth the fruits of righteousness, as that which is ever in motion, for the renewing of the glory and fame thereof,: but I doubt not but something in the speech following will give farther light to this point, then now we have time to mani∣fest.

Only note thus much; that such Doctrine as sets forth a time to come, of more worth and glory then either is, or hath been; such Doctrine keeps the Manna till to morrow, to the breeding of wormes in it: Yea it hath in it that worm that dyes not for if Christ our Pass-over be eaten according to the law of the spirit, there is nothing to be left till the mor∣ning: And if it be the bread that comes downe from heaven, it must be compleatly eaten at present, and there wil be no want to morrow, for it fals anew, & afresh, otherwise the word of God, that food of hea∣ven is corrupted, by reserving that for to morrow, which belongs to this present day: and in the sixe dayes labour, in the operations of God, we have plenty to feed on; In the seventh, as a cessation from all our own works, keeping a perfect Sabboth unto God, so that the kingdome of Christ is to be declared, and whole possession and present enjoyment given, and yet it is a Kingdome to come: So that wee have it in expectation as to come, as well as we fetch it up from that eternall estate of the Son, to give it a pre∣sent being; for if wee have it not as from the first, and to the last, we give it not its present being, and then uo Kingdome of Christ; for no man can make him the first and the last, that is, eternize the Son, but he must give him a present being without inter∣mission of a moment of time.

Dear friends, let me intreat you to read and con∣sider, and lend mee your help in the way of interpre∣tation, for there is no lesse need of that in him that hears, then in him that speaks; in him that reads, then in him that writes, for the light must shine in him that heares, or reads, as well as in him that speaks or writes, or else it is not fruitfull unto him. For we see by that light set up in our selves, which God hath made our owne, and not as the same light is in another: Therefore if you gather any comfor∣table fruit from what is sayd, let it be as your owne worke by the spirit of Christ, and not as mine. I have only endeavoured to put the Manna into the Arke, and there only you shall find it, compleatly in the pot, like the oyle in the cruse, and meale in the barrell, lasting to preserve life, and incorrupted unto this day: Which if any thing that is sayd may seem to direct you unto, then I have my reward, and so I humbly take my leave, and ever remayne yours in all services of love, in our only beloved.
