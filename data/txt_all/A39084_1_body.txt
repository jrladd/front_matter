THat man's his Makers Image, it is said,
But what's his Makers form I never read:
If there be any likeness, 'tis i'th' Mind,
Which still Aspires, and scorns to be Confin'd;
Godlike Ambition! Does this only Prove,
And shews the Kindred Mankind has to Jove;
Desire of Rule taught men the Art of War,
'Twas this that caus'd the Blest above to Jar:
This made the Heroe!—
This Godlike fury the Ambitious Hurl'd,
And led the daring Man t' o're run the World:
So sure 'tis plain, that those who thus Aspire,
Have in their Souls, the most Coelestial fire.
How much of Jove must then the English have,
Who're always known to be so stout and brave?

Handfulls of men have scour'd a Nation through,
Witness their Gallick Wars, & Flemish too,
And taught the vanquisht War by their own overthrow.
But 'twould be mean to mention more, since Fame
Sufficiently Records the English Name:
Say but they're English Redcoats, fire a Gun,
One makes their foes to tremble, th'other run;
Let the great Morgan, our fam'd Buccanier,
In his late Enterprise, make this appear,
Who with a handful of brave English men,
Frighted the whole America of Spain.
And when he was upon the Indian Shore,
Had he from Englands King deriv'd his Power,
Charles had been Crown'd the Indies Em∣perour.
Tho' the Poles brag of their last years Cam∣paign,
And th' French King boast of what ha's done to Spain.
Great Morgan's Fame shall last as long as there
Is beat of Drum, or any sound to War.
