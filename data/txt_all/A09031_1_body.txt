MADAM;
I Humbly intreat you with fauour to receiue this fruit of yor owne goodnes. If I haue performed any good by my poore labours; those which receiue it, owe the acknowledge∣ment (next vnto God) to your Ladiship; who haue so watered my studies with your coūtenance and beneficence, that euen my Barrennes hath both by preach∣ing and writing yielded some fruit: which, as it may be profi∣table to some, & is cōfortable to my selfe to haue brought forth; so I hope it shal (somwhat) fur∣ther your Ladiships reckoning at the day of Christ.
I know you take no pleasure to haue your goodnesse published, because you account Vertues fairest Theater to be a good Conscience: yet it becomes an ingenuous mind to professe, by whom he profiteth: And I wish that all the world vnderstood of your Honorable disposition, and Christian carriage, both in publique and priuate, that many more might be prouoked by your Noble example.
For as in all natiue and infu∣sed Graces, you immeasurably exceed the painted Sepulchers of these dayes: so is your Ladi∣ship in holy knowledge, discreet zeale, and compassionate chari∣tie, a liuely Image of those anci∣ent Heroines commended by Saint
Hierom, and other Fa∣thers, and also by vnerring Writers.
As Ladies, delight not onely to see faire Iewels, and curious Needleworks, but to take them out and weare them; so I can truly testifie, that your Ladi∣ships care is, not onely to knowe, but to expresse and weare the good things you know, in your conuersation. I earnestly pray for the increase of Gods fatherly blessing vpon your soule, and
