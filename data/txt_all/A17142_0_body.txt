RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL:
WHen I first deliuered that small Treatise by word of mouth, it was the farthest part of my thought, euer to aduenture the ex∣posall of it to the view of any, as considering mine owne weaknes and the worlds peeuish∣nesse. But it fared with this Sermon as with a Meteor, which being gently drawne vp by
the kindly heate of the Sunne, resides for a time in the Ayre, and hath there indeed a bee∣ing, but shineth not, till kindled by the Anti∣peristasis and circumstant cold of the ayre: So this my Labour receiuing some warmth and beeing, by the gentle breath, and vndeserued ap∣probation of some, was not yet seene of the world, vntill it tooke fire by some, who being (at the deliuery of it) circumstant, did in their causlesse and vndeserued humours, giue such cold entertainment vnto both it and me, that I was by the vulgar reported to bee taken by the great Fleet, or at the least shrewdly encountred. Whereupon I thought it fit (for mine owne defence, and satisfaction of others) that the things before demisla per au∣rem, should be now, oculis subiect a fidelibus, that what was before in the aire and in the eare, should now be in the eye, that the Christi∣an Reader may iudge whether it deserued re∣proofe or censure, yea, or no: and whether herein I haue laboured to keepe a good con∣science toward God and men, I appeale to the iudgements of them, who being cleare of any
thing against which I might seeme to inueigh, are fittest and the onely competent Iudges in this kind. Your Worships can (I trust) beare me witnesse, that I neuer amongst you for these ma∣ny years, haue shewed my selfe any way to be of a factious and a turbulent spirit, but haue al∣waies laboured and prayed for the peace of Ie∣rusalem, and hope to prosper the better because I loue her. Now when these forenamed pas∣sages had caused me , willing, nilling, for my owne safeguard to adiudge this poore booke to be prest (although I might haue seemed wise in choice of some greater patro∣nage,) I thought fittest to appropriate some part of my labours to this place, where I was borne, brought vp, and haue spent my dayes euer since I was called first to the Ministery, and so much the rather in regard of your vnde∣serued loues, which I can neyther deny nor conceale lest I should be iniurious, and also your godly and religious dispositions (wherein this City doth equall (without flattery be it spo∣ken,) the most ciuilly gouerned, or most emi∣nently religious places of this Kingdome.
Such as it is it pleades in my name, and I in the name of Truth, that it may finde acceptance with your Worships and as many as loue the truth, and if in any thing I shall be blamed, I will not bee so presumptuous as with Pilate, to say, What I haue written, I haue written; but as the Ecclesiasticall Historian, If I haue done well, it is that which I desired, but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attaine vnto. If hereby any (taking paines to reade is) shall reape any benefit, it shall be a full satisfaction for my labour and the com∣fort of my heart. Now the God of loue and peace multiply his blessings vpon this City, that it may be happy in gouernment, holy in profession, the true member of the mysticall body of Christ, partaking the promises of godlinesse, euen those of this life and of the life to come: Euen so be it Lord Iesus. Amen, Amen.
