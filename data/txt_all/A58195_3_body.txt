VIrtue, and Beauty, with kind Nature joyn'd,
To frame a Body, and adorn a Mind:
Virtue took all the Graces for her guide,
And Beauty, Love, with all the Flow'rs beside.
Long Nature studied, in what mould to cast
This master-piece, concluded at the last,
It must a Hanmer be, from whence or none,
She might expect such rare Perfection:
And having brought this noble Work to view
Of mortal Eyes, we all conclude 'tis You;
For Those bright Heroes would fair Virtue find,
Need search no farther than your beauteous Mind:
And if for Beauty curious eyes do seek,
They'l find it flourish in your lovely Cheek;
And now those Flow'rs, from whence at first it grew,
Return again, with love to wait on you.
Deign then, sweet Lady, but one cheerful ray
From your Fair Eyes, 'twill drive those damps away,
Which stupid Ignorance on them would cast,
And, at one breath, their Sweets and Glories blast.
Bless with your sweeter breath the Myrtle Bow'rs,
And be the Genius of these Plants and Flow'rs.




T To search the Indies for their Balm and Spice,
R Rifle the treasure of old Paradise,
E Enter all Breasts where Innocence doth dwell,
V Visit the Pulpit, or the Fryers Cell,
O Or search the Sea, and peirce the richest Mines,
R Run ore the Legend of the Saints, and Shrines;


H How needless then would all this labour be
A At our return, when we amaz'd should see
N Nature and Virtue had each sev'ral grace
M Made to inhabit in one Breast and Face?
E End then our strife, and in her Beauteous Name,
R Read all Perfection, and from whence it came.



Madam,
Though you have alter'd now your Name,
Your Virtues speak you still the same
As when th' Acrostick first was writ,
Therefore t'were sin to alter it.
