SIR,
I doe not dedicate this, crauing your protection thereof against calumny, and censure; the greatest Princes (I know) cannot doe it; yea their owne persons are not censure-proofe against the meanest varlets. Nor hereby to engage you to any fauour or defence thereof, beyond the direction of your owne iudg∣ment; your free minde (I know) disdaynes to stoope to such a lure, and mine to cast it out. Let the booke suffer its owne fate, for so it will; hee that finds fault with it, let him tell mee so? and if I cannot defend it, I will ac∣knowledge the error. Nor to take occa∣sion
 to flatter you; you are aboue it: and impossible attempts vanish euen in the vndertaking. Nor yet to pay you your due prayse, I am below it; and Fame her selfe dischargeth that debt, borrowing the tongues of all men for her helpe: But to testifie the honour I beare you, for your transcendent worth in your selfe; and the gratitude, for your great fauours to mee. It wants proportion (I confesse) to either; which proceeds from my pouer∣ty of materialls: but as small pictures compar'd with greater tables, so this (being all I haue to offer) may present mee as liuely, though not so largely
SIR,
