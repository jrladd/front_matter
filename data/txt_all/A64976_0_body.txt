FLattery and Ingrati∣tude I have always e∣steemed so much unbecom∣ing a Person that hath that Noble Faculty of the Soul Reason, that he that should be guilty of either of them, is not fit for, or ought to be admitted into humane Socie∣ty. For what can we do
 with, or know we how to deal with these deformed A∣nimals; the one wheadles Gentlemen out of their E∣states, with their Protestati∣ons and fair pretences; the o∣ther laughs at us when he hath got his ends: and though you have but immediately be∣fore relieved him with mony out of your purse, the same person shall be glad to see you in a Goal. But give me leave to testifie to the world, that you have neither been an Admirer or Cherisher o these foul (but now too-much-adored) Monsters. And I my self have been so fa
 from doating on them, that having served under the Co∣lours of that excellent, but now despised Lady, Good Na∣ture, I am not in so good an Equipage as when I first en∣tered my self into her Ser∣vice. But now lest I my self, whilest I am rayling upon this sort of Creatures, should be thought to be a Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing, and a Lyon under a Lambs skin: Be not angry with me if I tell you, the former Obligations and Favours you conferred upon me, imboldened me thus to attempt: and I should be in∣grateful indeed, should I not
 endeavour some small Retali∣ations. I have therefore put into your hands a homely piece of Work, neither so good as you deserve, nor so rich as I do wish it: I must entreat you to blame the va∣nity of our Age and Times, which are so fantastical grown, that they covet Stuffs rather slight to feed the eye with shew, than substantial for enduring: let the Fashi∣on be Frencb, 'tis no matter what the Cloath be. I have therefore not (with the Stur∣geon) swam against the Stream, but followed the hu∣morous Tides of this Age,
 & like Democritus have faln a laughing at all the world, see∣ing it doth nothing but mock it self. Sir, you have here the behaviour and Character of a Fop composed, to shew the Apish Fashions, and ridicu∣lous Humors and Conversa∣tions of some of our Town-Gallants, of whose Actions you are so far from being an Admirer and Imitator, that while they are swallowing down the sweet morsels of Sin, and in the midst of Re∣velling, courting their Mi∣stresses (as their Gentile word is) and inventing New Oaths for to be able to keep Com∣pany
 with only such as them∣selves; and whilest they study the very height of Debauche∣ry, and account him a boon Companion that is most viti∣ous, You are taken up in a far more Noble Exercise, and spend your spare hours in reading History; and for the laying out a little mony, re∣ceive a larger interest than the greatest Usurers do for their money: by looking on those Prospective-glasses, you behold Kingdoms and People afar off, come acquainted with their Manners, their Po∣licies, their Government, their Risings and their Downfals:
 You are present at their Bat∣tles without danger to your self, unless it is in grieving to see States so overthrown by the mutability of For∣tune: you see those Empires utterly brought to subver∣sion, which had been Terrors and Triumphers over all Na∣tions upon Earth. Oh Histo∣ries! You Sovereign Balms to the Bodies of the Dead, that preserve them more fresh than if they were alive, keep the Fames of Princes from perishing, when Marble Mo∣numents cannot save their bones from being rotten; you faithful Intelligencers be∣tween
 Kingdoms, you truest Counsellors to Kings, even in greatest dangers, be not angry with me if I am something tedious in setting forth the excellencie of your delight (History) Happy you are by Birth, happy by your bring∣ing up; but most happy, in that the Muses too have been your Darling. The Path which true Nobleness had wont and ought to tread, lies directly before you; you have been ever, and are now in the way, which imboldens me to presume, that as our great∣est Commanders will not dis∣dain to instruct even a fresh∣watered
 Souldier in the School. points of VVar; so out of your generous disposition, you will vouchsafe to view the labour of so dull a Pen, and not censure me for conse∣crating so idle a Pamphlet to you. And say not that the world will take you to be of that number that desire to have your Name in print only to get a vain Reputation, and that by the superfluities of so idle a brain as mine; No Sir, 'tis a piece of Drollery, I con∣fess, but not designed nor writ to droll upon you, but only to let the world see that you are of so sedentary and reti∣red
 a Nature and Conversa∣tion, that it is requisite for your divertisement to view the Fopperies of this Age. If you give entertainment to this in your best affection, you will bind me (one day) to heighten your Name, when by some more worthy. Co∣lumn I shall Consecrate that and your self to an Everlast∣ing and Sacred Memory, most affectionately desirous to be
