Madam:
THE Truth is most Divine, though crossing hu∣mane sense, spoken by the Father of truth; but I will not heere stand blowing a Trumpet (as it were) either of your Worthinesse, or my owne weakenesse: As for your Vertues and Almes-deeds, they shall and will follow you, when you shall be gathered to your Fathers, Revel. 14.13. And for my imbecillity and weaknesse, let the World laugh at it, I care not; onely my desire is, that God may be glori∣fied. I have made bold to present a Hand-kercheffe for a Disconsolate Soule, under your name, assuring myselfe (according to your wonted Pie∣ty) of your loving acceptance; my desire to doe good, and that to the
poore and meanest soule, shall in part (as I hope) excuse me in all: For we are all Debters (with that blessed Saint Paul, Rom. 1.14.) both to the wise and unwise. And as it must and ought be our wisdome chiefely to winne and gaine soules Prov. 11.30. So it behooveth all Gods child∣ren to receive from us with meekenesse his Statutes and Judgements, Deut. 4.6. I have heard you are as patient as Job, and like to Moses milde, and altogether full of Vertue: In a word, although neither my person nor condition can any waies merrit at your Ladyships hands, yet the benigne aspect you alwaies afford to those that labour in Gods Church hath thus far emboldned me, in all humility to crave that this my endea∣vour may passe in Publique under your Ladyships name; which favour being happily obtained, the Worke and thing it selfe may of all sorts ex∣pect to be the rather embraced: And so praying the Father of mercy to grant you much joy, health, and happinesses terrestriall, with a glorified life coelestiall, resteth,
