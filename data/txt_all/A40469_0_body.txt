and Perfection whereof, to the Glory of God, your Countries happiness, and Your own eternal Fame, he most hear∣tily and earnestly wisheth, who in his greatest straits under the Iron yoke of Cruelties close restraint many yeers, was sundry times made partaker of your truly Christian bounty, to the pre∣servation of his Life and Being, and (after many years Imprisonment) of some breathings of Liberty. For which in way of due thankfullness (as ever in his heart abhorring the grand sin of Ingratitude) he returns unto Your Excellency most humbly and hearty thanks, and in assurance of the continuation of your most noble Pa∣ternal favour towards him; he pre∣sumeth to shroud this ensuing treatise (of the Personal Reign of Christ upon

the earth) under the wing of your Execllencies favorable Protection: most humbly presenting the same unto your Excellencies view, acceptance, and most noble Boerean perusal; The glimpse of which favour extended, is the highest pitch of his ambition, who in all true Christian humility to his God, and fidelity (in the band of love) to his Country, and your Excel∣lencie, Subcribes himself.
Most Noble, Excellent, and Right Honorable,
