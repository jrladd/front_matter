THe Honour I ever bare to that bright shining Star of Loyalty, your late deceased Lord, obliges me to Dedi∣cate these few lines to your singular goodnesse; they will occasion serious thoughts in sad times; and point you out the way to life by Death: I know a great part of your joy on earth is gone to Heaven: And since Death made a
way for your Noble Lord, I trust in the Lord this shall sweeten to you the thought of the approach of Death. I have made bold to set a sad object before your eyes, you may mixe it with your worldly injoy∣ments, as the Israel tes did their bitter hearbs, with their pleasant passover; It may seeme at first to kill, but cures, onely removing our Landmarke from a: Coppy-hold at will, to a fee-farme of Eternity: These after Noyse may seeme as harsh as Jacobs hands were Rough; but I hope not so to you, who in life have learnt to dye; A short lesson, yet to some, too long a learning; God hath blessed your Honour with long dayes, yet some by them have been overcast with a black cloud of worldly ca∣lamity, which many mouthes put all your family and deare friends into mourning weedes: What was this, but the messen ger of death sent to one, to warne you and all yours, and all others to make ready to die.

You see at the Espousalls of Emperiall Crownes, it was thought fit to Caroll out this dolefull ditty, Memento mori, O Man remember thy end. It shall not be my last, but everlasting suit, in this, you would mitate the Princes of the Nations, and whilst by Divine Goodnesse, you are In∣heritrix of large possessions, at the same time to bebare in mind how here we have no continuing Citty: God for his goodnesse,
and Christ for his merits blesse you and all yours, which shall be, Dum spiro, the prayer of
