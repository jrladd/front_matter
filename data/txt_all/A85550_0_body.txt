MEeting of late (my Lord) with some strange undertakers in point of Church-Governe∣ment, who thought they had done well, and yet missed at a great distance the marks both divin and humane, not onely in that which concerned their impowerment, but also thier direction for government, and finding my Brethren injuriously dealt withall, and over-mastered by more then ordinarie insultation, I could do no lesse there & then, but defend them by my advice and counsell, which did so seasonably relieve and refresh them, as that they earnestly desired, that I would send them the like in writing, for their better satisfaction, and vesoluton in future times, whose Christian importunity, hath so prevailed with

my weake abilitie, as that I have made a briefe, yet a true disco∣verie of fained Presbyterie: And notwithstanding your Lord∣ship, hath formerly taken notice, of the contents of the two first Chapters, yet that experience I have had of your ready eare for hearing, and soundnesse of judgement in knowing, makes me bold to acquaint your honour with the whole discoverie, and therein especially with the contents of the third Chapter, in which are such strang and new things, as I presume your Lord∣ship never read the like, and I humbly beseech, that my bold∣nesse may finde pardon of your goodnesse, & amongst your great Offerings let this mite of mine receive acceptance from him whom the Lord hath made his servant and yours, to serve him the great God of Heaven and earth, and your Lordship in a higher imployment.
My Lord, no sooner had I thought thus to conclude this short Epistle: but presently was given me a grosse delusion of Captain Norwoods asserted under his owne hand. And wondring that such an impudent falshood should put on a face of confidence and boldnesse, I thought it my duty to the Common-wealth in a few words, to breake his bands of ruths restraint asunder, as Sampson arose, and cast away the Strumpets intanglements: And because I have declared before against these approbrious injuries offered to the misterie of godlinesse, touching our Lords personall death and resurrection, I thought good to add them, and this to the aforesaid discoverie, commending all to your Honours meditations, Who am alwayes ready to serve you,
