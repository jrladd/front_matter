I Humbly craue your Worthinesse t'excuse
This boldnesse of my poore vnlearned Muse,
That hath presum'd so high a pitch to flye,
In praise of Vertue and Nobility,
I know this taske most fit for Learned men,
For Homer, Ovid, or for Virgils pen:
But for I with him haue both seru'd and sail'd,
My gratefull duty hath so far preuail'd,
Boldly to write true Honours late decease,
Whiles better Muses please to hold their peace.
And thus much to the world my Verse proclaimes,
That neither Gaine nor Flattery are my aimes,
But Loue and Dutie to the Noble dead,
Hath caus'd me cause these Lines be published.
And therefore I entreat your gen'rous Hearts,
T'accept my duty, pardon my deserts,
Beare with my weaknesse, winke at my defects,
Good purposes doe merit good effects,
Poore earthen Vessels may hold precious Wine,
And I presume that in this Book of mine
In many places you shall something find,
To please each Noble well affected mind.
And for excuse my Muse doth humbly plead,
That you'le forbeare to iudge before you reade.

He that is euer a true well-wisher, and obâˆ£sequious Seruant to your Honours, Worships, and Noble Personages;
