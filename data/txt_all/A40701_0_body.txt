I Hope the same Noble Disposition which has inspir'd
you bravely on all occasions, to demonstrat your Zeal
for the Preservation of the present Government, by
supporting the best of Kings, will induce you favourably to
look on, and protect this short, but true Narrative of the
most socret and subtile Design of the late Reign; which
was a Contrivance so deeply laid, to root out the Protestant
Religion, and all things else valuable to every true English
Man, that nothing but the mighty power and favour of
God could deliver this Nation from: I hope there can be
no Danger of a Relapse; And verily believe there will not,
unless Sins and Ignorance rule the People of this Land into
a Lethargy of Security—You, Gentlemen, are the Ru∣lers
over a great People, and it is much in your power, by your
Authority and Example, to preserve the lasting Peace of this
Kingdom: Therefore I humble beg your partronage of this
piece; which as a strange Mountain, bids Defiance to all its
Opposers; And the Truth thereof may at one time be more
powerful than the Arms of a Popish pretender; and thereby
be of Ʋse to you and your posterity.
May Almighty GOD long preserve the present
King, under whose Care you and your famous
City are sure of peace and Prospetity, it is the
Prayers of
Your most Devoted, and
Obedient Servant
