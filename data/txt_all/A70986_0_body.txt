SIR,
THe general Voice is, That You are a great Lover of Rarities, whence it is that I Dedicate this to You, and I hope You will make my Apologie Your self, with that of Seneca, Non malè meruit, sed benè judicavit: The Age is full of voluminous Books that are able to make the Reader nauseate, were he not recreated by diver∣sion; This I present You with, is but small, yet were it wyer▪drawn to its full length, it would make a huge Volume: For it includes the Actions of King James, Earl Gondamor, Bishop Bancroft, Sir Walter Rawleigh, and some other Famous Men, of whom

several Histories might be compiled: I may compare it to Gold, that in a small quantity is of more worth than a great deal of base Coin, for it comprehends much Matter in a few Words. And for the far∣ther Commendation, it bears in the Frontispiece the Name of that ever Famous Antiquary, Sir Robert Cotton, who was never wont to treasure up any thing but what was Rare; nor can I certainly say, whether it were Pen'd by Himself or not. I insist the more upon Him, because it was my chance to be one whom he vouchsafed to take by the Hand a little be∣fore his Death, I being sent to him by my Lord Pri∣vie Seal, to acquaint him that by my Lords Media∣tion, the King was Reconciled to him: but his An∣swer was, That his Heart was broken, and that it was now too late: Whereby it appears that Princes are sometimes abused, and mis-informed, to the Ruine of the best Men. Sir Walter Rawleighs unfortu∣nate end proves the same, who was circumvented by the cunning Practises of Earl Gondamor, whereby to the unspeakable detriment of Posterity, he was prevented from setting forth the Second Part to compleate the Worlds History, which he had made ready for the Press. Gondamor is yet fresh in Memory of many Men, who knew him when he lay Leiger here from the King of Spain; and I never

heard or read of any Embassadour that acted his part with more dexterity for his Masters glory and ad∣vantage than he did, for however he had to deal with a very wise Prince (as he sayes) yet like another Mercury he could soon with his facetious words and gestures pipe King James a sleep, and did sometimes take hold of the Helm himself, and was very near to have run the Ship a ground, or to have split her upon the Rocks, the influence of his ill Aspect, and Eclipsing the Sun-beams is hardly over unto this present Age. Don Caro Columbus who was sent hither, was thought by many judicious Men, to be the more Prudent, and that Gondamor was but a Buffon compared with him: yet when he departed, he was fain to leave this Motto behind him, Rever∣tar, emplying, That he had not accomplished what he came about: but Gondamor put a Period to what he had Designed; and perhaps it had been bet∣ter for our Nation if that Politick Spaniard had never trd upon English ground. I should be in∣jurious to Your Patience if I should detain You longer in the Suburbs: Therefore I hasten to subscribe my self,
