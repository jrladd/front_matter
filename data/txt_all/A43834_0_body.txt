SIR:
AS Musick sits Queene Regent in the Center of Arts, whereby she preserves an Har∣monious Sympathy amongst them; so her studious Care, to continue that U∣nity, hath qualified her servants in severall degrees; some like Seraphins, sing Hosanna in the highest; others like Angels, charoll the Nativity of Emanuel. The Ayry Quire in their kind, warble Praises to their Creator, and Man in va∣rious Tunes, sets forth the Glory of his Maker: I could speake of the Spherique Harmony, and the generall Musick of the Creature, both sensitive and vegetative, whose tacit Voyces glorifie the Lord of their beings. But your better Knowledge (Worthy Sir) needs no illustration of her Excellencies from me, you having so long been Rector Chori. Knowing there∣fore not only your perfection in this Art, but your Zeale to defend it; I have presumed to pre∣sent you with some of her Servants Endeavours, not snatcht up at randome, nor catcht at with an uncivill and rude hand, but gathered with a reverend and carefull collection, to avoyd of∣fence and scandall. And if that Generall Good I ayme at therein shall acced my wishes, (being the Mutuall Society of Friends in a Modest Recreation) I have catch't the happinesse of my De∣sires;

so being enricht by That, and your courteous patronizing of These, You and I'le sing.




NOn nobis Domine, non no-bis, sed no-mi-ni tu—o da Glori-am, sed no-mi-ni tu-o da Glo-ri-am. Non no-bis, &c.
