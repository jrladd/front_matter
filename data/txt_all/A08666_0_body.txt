THe natiue soyle of this tree is Italie, wherby the hands of the Latine Mu∣ses it was planted aboue six∣teene

hundred yeeres agoe: being of so excellent vigour and durance, that no reuo∣lution of time could bring it to decay. It seemes the Nymphs of the woods gaue to it a speciall boone of pro∣tection against old age, more than they haue afforded to the okes of Hauering Parke,

Which, when I walk among them, seeme from their do∣ted tops and emptie trunks to say to moe, that heart of ak is no armour of proofe against the sithe of Father Time.
This our tree, standing in open and vnfenced ground, I haue made bold to seise vp∣on

and remoue hither: By which transplanting of a stocke so growne and con∣ueyed so farre, it is no mar∣uell if it now droope in our cold English soyle; especi∣ally by reason of the vnskil∣fulnesse of the gardner, Who being but a fresh apprentice to the translating trade, may

iustly feare that this Latine plant will bee thought more rudely battered by his rough English penne, then euer it was by the staues of Rustick Passengers.
Thus with presentment of all filiall dutie, I craue ac∣ceptation of you, my deare

Mother: in hope that you will vouchsafe to look vpon this tree, set in our fields at home, on purpose for your owne view: though you are like to finde very little fruit vpon it worthie your ta∣sting.
So wishing an happie

New yeare to you; & hum∣bly crauing your Motherly blessing, I alwaies rest
Lambith this
first of Ianuarie, 1624.
