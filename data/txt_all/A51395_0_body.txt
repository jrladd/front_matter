Reverend Sir,
IT is now more than four years since I (being then elder than Barzillai was, when he made the like request to King David) did beg and obtain leave from the King my Gracious Lord and Master to quit my personal attendance on him at the Court in Council, and to retire in∣to the Countrey, and to serve him there, by praying for him without distraction, or interruption; remembring that old and wise saying,

And withall resolving, having with∣drawn my self from the encumbrance

and noise of all Secular Affairs, to mind nothing else (besides the necessary care of mine own Diocese) but the making my self ready by God's gracious assistance for a quiet and a comfortable Exit out of this evil and troublesome World. The near approach whereof (by reason of my great Age) you do well to put me in mind of and I thank you for it, though you do it in such a manner as seems to imply, that you think me to have more need of such a Memento than one of my Age ought to have.
But then being my unfeigned well∣willer (as in the subscription of your Address to me you tell me you are) why do you endeavour so unseasonably to withdraw me from so necessary a work (especially supposing me to have so little time left for the doing of it) which you do, first, by calling me to an Account for what I writ in a Letter above 18 years ago, in which you say there are many mistakes in matter of fact, which (if I say nothing to the contrary) will be taken for granted. And secondly, by your so

earnestly pressing me as well as the Bishop of Ely (to whom you make the afore∣said Address also) to tell you what we think of that which you call the Onely true way of Concord of all Christian Churches, and if upon Perusal thereof we are con∣vinced it is so, to see that Prejudice resist not, but that we would acknowledge and confess it to be so. But this you know cannot be done without reading over and considering and examining that whole Book of yours; nor consequently by me without taking off my thoughts from minding so much, as otherwise I might do that Ʋnum necessarium which you ad∣vise me to think on, and which indeed is a much more proper employment for one so near the grave as I am, than to engage or to be engaged to Apologize for mine own, or to Censure other mens Writings.
Yet rather than to seem by my silence to acknowledge what you charge me with to be true, which I cannot without being injurious to truth it self as well as to mine own reputation; I will in the first place vindicate my self from having made so

many, or any one so gross a mistake in matter of fact, as you say there are in my aforesaid Letter. And then, if I live long enough and have time enough to spare from better and more necessary employ∣ments, I will tell you freely and plainly what I think of the Book you address to the Bishop of Ely and me; I mean whether what you promise in the Title-page of it be performed in it. In the mean time wishing you Saniorem mentem in saniori cor∣pore, I rest (as much as the peace and safety of the Church will permit me to be)
