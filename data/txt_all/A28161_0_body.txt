MAdam, these sacred Poems which ensue,
Intended were to follow that which I
Once tendred to your honorable view,
Excuse me that I cannot gratifie
Your full desires; the Stationer thought best
To print these first, next (if these take) the rest;
Madam, till then accept of what is prest.

Nov. 5. 1666.
