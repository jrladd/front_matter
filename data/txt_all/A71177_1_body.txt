IT is now two years, since part of these ensuing Papers, like the publick issue of the people, imperfect and undressed, were exposed, with∣out a Parent to protect them, or any hand to nourish them. But since your Most Sacred Majesty was pleased graciously to look upon them, they are grown into a Tract, and have an ambition (like the Gourd of Jonas) to dwell in the eye of the Sun from whence they received life and incre∣ment. And although because some violence hath been done to the profession of the doctrine of this Treatise, it may seem to be verbum in tempore non suo, and like the offering Cypress to a Conqueror, or Palms to a broken Army, yet I hope I shall the less need an Apo∣logie, because it is certain, he does really dis-serve no just and Noble interest, that serves that of the Spirit, and Religion. And because the sufferings of a KING and a Confessor are the great demon∣stration to all the world that Truth is as Dear to your MAJESTY as the Jewels of your Diadem, and that your Conscience is tender as a pricked eye, I shall pretend this only to alleviate the inconvenience of an unseasonable address, that I present your MAJESTY with a humble persecuted truth, of the same constitution with that condition whereby you are become most Dear to God, as having upon you the characterism of the Sons of God, bearing in your Sacred Person the marks of the Lord Jesus, who is your Elder Brother, the King of Sufferings, and the Prince of the Catholick Church. But I consi∣der that Kings, and their Great Councils, and Rulers Ecclesiasti∣cal 
have a special obligation for the defence of Liturgies, because they having the greatest Offices, have the greatest needs of auxilia∣ries from Heaven, which are best procured by the publick Spirit, the Spirit of Government and Supplication. And since the first, the best, and most solemn Liturgies and Set forms of Prayer were made by the best and greatest Princes, by Moses, by David, and the Son of David; Your MAJESTY may be pleased to observe such a proportion of circumstances in my laying this (Apology for Liturgy) at Your feet, that possibly I may the easier obtain a par∣don for my great boldness; which if I shall hope for, in all other con∣tingencies I shall represent my self a person indifferent whether I live or die, so I may by either, serve God, and Gods Church, and Gods Vicegerent, in the capacity of,
Great Sir,
