GReat Lord, to whom infinitiues of fame
Flock like night starres about the siluer Moone,
That giuest new fier to learnings late quencht flame,
Sauing the Muse by stonie times vndoone,
Let me finde fauour in thine honord sight,
Daring my rimes vnto thy sacred hand:
And whilst their accents talke of valures might,
Yeeld them some splendour from thy valures brand,
Thou in their lines, they in thine eyes shall see,
Nothing but honors vncontrouled minde,
Thou lending, they exacting still from thee,
Substance, that might to mightines doth binde,
And for his sake whose praise my Muse hath sought
Fauour my worke, the image of thy thought.
