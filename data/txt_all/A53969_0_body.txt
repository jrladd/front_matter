My Lord,
WHen your Lordship and your Brethren were pleased to pitch upon me for your Preacher on the late Solemn Occasion, I had rea∣son to conclude, that knowing my Principles and Way, you might expect from me a Discourse like unto the Author, Blunt and Plain, and (as I hope your Lordship doth believe) Loyal and Honest.
And truly had I had no other Tye upon me but Good Manners, that was enough to oblige me not to defraud your Lordship wholly of your ex∣pectations. But I have this to say more, that by my Experience I have found, that the Deli∣vering of plain Truths after a plain manner (however some may call it Intemperate Zeal) is in this Age the most Effectual way of Instruct∣ing

People, especially the ordinary sort of Men, who are most apt to run away with mistakes, and who need the most of our Care and Instructions, because they are the Hands and Tools which Politick Male-contents imploy to Disturb the Peace and Establisht Government.
I had therefore a particular regard to the necessities of these, especially in the Practical part of this Discourse; which I thought necessary to adapt to our present Circumstances, as a more profitable course than either to enter into Contro∣versie, or to tell a Story of the Fifth of No∣vember.
My Lord, I did hope that your Lordship and the Court would have gratified my Desires by Ex∣cusing me from Publishing these Papers to an Ʋncharitable and Censorious World. But since you have been pleased to determine it otherwise, I Submit to your Pleasure, being ever ready to pay all due Obedience to my Governours, and par∣ticularly to your Lordship, whose Endeavours for the Good of the Government in Church and State, I beseech God to bless with Successes suit∣able to your Zeal for both. I am,
My Lord,
