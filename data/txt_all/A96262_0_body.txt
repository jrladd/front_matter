Honoured Sir,
WERE Might and Power the insepara∣ble Companions of Truth, these follow∣ing Sheets need fear no Injury; but since by the Self-interest of some, and Ignorance of others, they are like to meet with so many Enemies in the World, I shall thankfully own Pro∣vidence in my happy Choice of, and readily recommend Truth unto your Zealous and Powerful Protection.
The Detecting of Imposture, which (conceal'd) wou'd render our Age ridiculous to all succeeding; and
Vindicating of Truth, from the ma∣licious and unreasonable Calumnies of upstart Pretenders, is my real De∣sign, and I do verily believe the pow∣erfullest Motive to perswade your Acceptance.
I shall mention Flattery and Pro∣lixity (the two Diseases of Dedicati∣on) with no other design than to a∣void them both; the one being as in∣jurious to your known Ingenuity and Modesty, as the other wou'd be im∣pertinent in interrupting your more serious and fruitful Thoughts, so as∣siduously and successfully employed for the Honour and Advantage of your Prince and Country: With whose joint Affections that you may ever continue to be bless'd, shall al∣ways be the hearty Prayer of,
Honoured Sir,
