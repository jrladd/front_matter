MY LORD,
THe Author of this History, who
is my Countryman and my
Friend, having committed the
Printing and Publishing of it to my
Care, I now humbly present it to

YOUR GRACE, whose Illustrious
Name is more than once mention'd in
it, with just and deserved Honour.
We have had such slender Account
of the Transactions of the Last Cam∣pagne
in Flanders, that this History,
promis'd by my Friend when he Prin∣ted
his Relation of 1692, has been
impatiently expected. It is now done
even to a Niceness, as to all Circum∣stances
of Action, and carries with it
such an Air of plain and modest
Truth, as suits with the Profession and
Character of Him that writes it.
Our Author has been very careful
all along to Right those Gallant Men
of our own Nation who have distin∣guish'd
themselves in this Summer's
Service, and to whom Foreign Prints
have not given the full Commendations
they deserve. Among those Gallant
Men, YOUR GRACE holds an Emi∣nent

Rank, in this History. Those
Honourable Wounds which You
took in the Great Action at Landen,
where You headed our foremost Squa∣drons,
and with admirable Courage
fought among the thickest of the Ene∣mies,
are Noble Proofs of the share
You had in the Dangers of that Day.
What may we not promise our selves
from such early and blooming Valour,
train'd up under the Conduct, and led
on by the Example of the Greatest
King and General this day in Europe?
MY LORD, The Way you tread
in, is that which leads to certain Glory.
'Tis the same wherein Your Renown'd
Grandfather, and Your Brave and
Heroick Father, have walk'd before
You: And They were in their Time
the Honour and Ornament of the Eng∣lish
Nation; the Support of the Crown;
the Love and Delight, the Wonder

and Admiration of Mankind. May
Your growing Virtue equal one day,
and, if possible, surpass Theirs! May
You, in that Great Field of Triumph
and Victory to which You are retur∣ning,
reap a Harvest of the most
Verdant Laurels! But may You
gather them dy'd only in the Blood of
our Enemies, and without Tincture
of one Drop of Your own! I am,
May it please YOUR GRACE,
