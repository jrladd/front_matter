Right Honourable,
IN the Robe of Aaron's Ephod, by God's appoint∣ment, there was to be a Bell and a Pomegra∣nate, Ex. 28. 34. A Bell and a Pomegranate, round about the hem of the Robe. Why the Bells were not placed aloft, but in Extremis, in the Hem or Skirts of the Robe, Origen gives this Moral account, Ut de extremis Hom. 9. in Exod. nunquam sileas, semper sones, To put men in mind of their latter End; that even from Aaron's Garment the do∣ctrine of Mortality might be always sounding in the ears of the People. Every Funeral Sermon is as a Passing-peal from these Bells of Aaron. In this there is not onely the Bell of Aaron, but the Pomegranate, the fruit of a Holy and Pious Life, exprest in the rare Example of your ever-Honoured Father.
It is true of the Lives of the Saints what one said of the Pomegranate, that there is in the best aliquod granum putre, some one grane or other amiss. Yet I am perswaded
 there were in him as few faulty granes, and as great Emi∣nencies of solid Vertue and Piety, as in any person whom this Age hath produced. He hath derived to Your Honour a most compendious way of Excelling, in leaving You both an high advantage of Doing Good, by an honourable Fortune, and a great Example of Being Good, by beating out the way be∣fore You.
And by the blessing of God Your Lordship will exceed the Copy, having already given to the world the signal evi∣dences of Your great Love to Religion and Loyalty, the surest Foundation of all Christian and Heroick Vertues. Which that they may be increased and multiplied, with all other Blessings, upon Your Lordship and Your Noble Family, shall be my constant and earnest prayer.
In the mean time Your Lordship will be pleased to accept of this short and imperfect Draught, adventured into the publick view in pure obedience to Your Lordship's Desires, which have the force of undisputable Commands upon
