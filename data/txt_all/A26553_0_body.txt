SIR,
BEing of a temper quite contrary to the flatering Genius of this Age, I shall not follow the Ex∣ample of most Writers of Dedicatory Epistles, and try your Patience with long Encomiums either of Yourself, or

of your Family, since the Histories, and publick Records of the Kingdom of Scot∣land, have given the Publick so clear, and so full an account of its Antiquity; as likewise of the Vertue, Generosity, great Atchievements, and unshaken Loy∣alty of your Illustrious Ancestors Yet I hope I shall not offend your Modesty, if I say, 'tis the general opinion of all your Acquaintances, both at home and abroad, that as you follow in your greener years so closely their footsteps through the Temple of Vertue, to that of Honour and Glory, so you may perhaps, impove (if possible) to a Higher pitch, those very Great and Heroick Qualities they first excell'd in. May not I then b allowed to say, without the least suspicio of flattery, that you are not only th laful Successor of the most Ancient, mo Noble, and Loyal Family of the Thai of Calder, and of their Estate and For▪tune,

but also, that you are already possess'd of these good and great Endow∣ments both of Body and Mind, which made them capable of the great Employ∣ments they were intrusted with, and enabled them on all occasions to render the Kings of Scotland and Great Bri∣tain such signal Services, as can never be forgotten.
But not intending a Panegyrick, which I know would be uneasie to you, who hates the least appearance of flat∣tery, I shall not insist on this Subject; I must only tell you, that this small Treatise, since 'tis the Academy of Sciences, could not but claim a peculiar Right to your Patronage, since you have given so singular and convincing proofs of your being thoroughly ac∣quainted with the Subject it treats of; for having seen by a lucky chance, before I had any acquaintance with yourself, your very learned and accurate Book,

I found it to contain in short, almost all kind of useful Learning, the Sy∣stems both of the New and Old Philoso∣phy, the choicest Flowers of Rhetorick; as likewise evident marks of a not ordi∣nary Piety and Loyalty, especially when you conclude the whole with your Fa∣ther's, as well as your own dutiful As∣serting and declaring for his Sacred Ma∣jesty, who now Reigns, (then Duke,) his undoubted Right of Succession, in expressions full of affection and zeal to his Person and Service, and that at a time when Loyalty and Duty of Subjects to the Royal Family, were not only seasonable, but seem'd to be ne∣cessary; and you being hardly past the Sixteenth year of your age, I could not but be surprised, instead of promising Buds, to find so early Fruits both of Vertue and Loyalty.
While this directed me whither I should send this small Present, it rais'd my Thoughts in revising of

it with a Paulo majora canamus, to reform it so as to make it suitable to your Character, and give it the better pretence to your Acceptance.
Only I hope, that as Travellers find some pleasure when settled at home, to review in a small Map, those vast and pleasant Countries they have visited abroad, so it may perhaps, prove some diversion in your spare hours, to consi∣der now and then those very many Arts and Sciences, which both at home and abroad you have practised, and so suc∣cessfull studied in larger Volumes.
Though I treat nothing a fond, as the French speak, or thoroughly and to the bottom, yet besides some not despi∣cable hints of the Material Principles of most Arts and Sciences, I do point every where at the Famed Authors, and greatest Masters of every Art and Science, that they may supply you with what my design'd brevity, and the scope

of this Treatise, would not allow me to enlarge upon; and so this not unplea∣sant method, whatever you think of the performance, may perhaps reconcile you to my design, of adding, though but little, to your greater improvements, while at the same time I shew to the World with what zeal I am,
SIR,
