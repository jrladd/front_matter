THere have now (Dearly Beloved) several yeares passed over our heads, since I first obtained that good opinion from you, as to be admitted into your So∣ciety. And sure I am, I shall not flatter you in acknowledging, that if I have not in all this time improved my Spiri∣tual estate very much; it is not because I have not had opportunity so to doe, but because I have not had an heart fully to improve this opportunity. And how ever mine own dulnesse and indisposition, have obstructed much of that increase which was (as I beleeve) in∣tended me on your part, yet this I must acknowledge to the praise of that rich and abundant grace of God that hath uttered it selfe among you, and hath been declared by you, that your love, diligence, faithfulnesse, and zeale, and the grace of God in them, have made such impressions upon me, as by which you may well (as I doubt not but you will) stand much indeared to me all my days.
As for those Christian respects I have received from you, they have so much exceeded what I could well expect, as
that I have not been under any temptation of neglect this wayes, whereby the bond of my union with you could be loosened.
And yet so it is (Beloved, as ye well know,) that some ap∣prehensions and impressions of conscience in me, have caused me in some things to differ from the most of you, and have occasioned some alteration in my fermer practise and conver∣sation with you; yet not without long consideration, and some consultation first had with many of you, in order to my satis∣faction in that wherein I doe differ. But I trust that the consciences of those who know my compliant temper, will be ready to witnesse with me, that my differing from you does not proceed from a love in me to differ, but from my love to truth as apprehended by me; my inclination otherwise strongly carrying me to a compliance with all men, how much more with you, when it may be without a breach making upon the peace of my conscience.
But since I have taken the liberty to dissent from you, both in opinion and practice as to some things; I could not but hold my selfe obliged, to give you an account of some of the grounds upon which I have done it; which that I might doe upon better terms then otherwise I had convenient opportunity to doe, I have made this publick addresse to you as you see.
And in as much as my intention herein, next unto the ser∣vice of the truth it selfe, is to serve you; my hope is, that you will as seriously and impartially intend and weigh the import of the matter presented to your view, as I have with sincere respect unto your benefit prepared it.
It is like the inconsiderablenesse of the author, and the great improbability, that one far inferior in parts, and gifts, should see further, and discerne more in things of this nature, then those that much transcend him, will be a great tempta∣tion upon you, if not wholly to neglect and despise this piece of discourse; yet to think it unworthy your serious thoughts.
But I know, you know how to releeve your selves against this temptation, considering that it is no new thing for God,
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings to ordain strength, as well as out of the mouths of stronger men: nor for him to put of his treasure into earthen weak vessels, that the excellen∣cy of its power might be the better knowne to be of God: nor is it any thing more then ordinary, for him to subject the stronger to supplies from the weaker in some things; so that the head shall have no cause to say unto the feet. I have no need of you. Besides, hath not the undue admiring of the learning, parts, and abilities, even of good men themselves in their generations, as if they had been comprehensive of all truth coming under their consideration, when as they have been tainted with errour and superstition in some things, I say hath not this been a snare by which many have been de∣tained in error and superstitious vanities, much longer then otherwise they would have been? men of the greatest parts not being alwayes the forwardest nor foremost in all acts of reformation, they having more strength to hold out against the truth, and a greater dexterity to obscure it both from them∣selves and others, by pleas, objections and subtile distinctions or involutions rather,
For how ever they sometimes dîstinguish and divide in things which are of an intire and collective in∣terpretation, yet for the most part they err on the other hand, by involving and confounding things together, which are of different na∣ture, and ought to be distin∣guished: and this they do in nothing more, then in jumbling together the Legal and Evangelical ad∣ministrations, which differ almost as much as night and day. then men of lower parts have.
The nature of the subject also (here tendered to conside∣ration) being such, as tends to perswade men to imbrace that despised way, which is generally every where spoken against, and which is apt to bring the assertors of it into dis-esteeme and contempt among men, if not to expose them to sufferings of a worser nature, it may doubtlesse be a temptation to many, not to be two inquisitive after things of this nature, but to content themselves, onely with a cursorie and superficial survey of them, lest otherwise by a more intent and impartial consi∣deration, and a more narrow scrutinie into, and thorow exa∣mination of matters, they should discover so much light, as by which they must be necessitated, eyther to hazard much of their outward honour, peace, and prosperity in the world in following that light, or their inward peace and tranquility in not obeying it.

But as concerning you my friends, who have despised this temptation in other cases, which otherwise would have de∣prived you of some other great truths of the gospel, with which you are now enriched; my hope is, that you will be the better prepared to resist it at this turn also. For know ye for a certainty, that the conscience never hath so rich a tast of the sweet and pleasant fruit of righteousnesse, as when a man in conscience to God, and love to truth, is willing to suffer, and doth suffer from the world in the practice of it: this hidden Manna is not tasted, save by those that overcome temptation. But why should not those that are Godly wise indeed, overshoote the devil in his owne bow? and rather be en∣couraged to, then discouraged from searching into those doctrines and waies, which are discountenanced by the world; since they are so much the likelier to be of God: for if they were of the world, the world would love her owne.
It is also a thing very ungrateful to the flesh, and hardly attained without much spiritual ingenuity, for men who have for a long time, and with great confidence, owned, asserted, and pleaded the cause of an erroneous way; afterwards to acknowledge their mistakes, and turn Advocates for that, which with a high hand they have somtimes opposed.
But he that knows not how to deny himself in such things as these, upon conviction sof light; knows not how to approve himself a man worthy the name of a Disciple of Christ; who, as the Master saith, cannot be such, except he deny himself. And had not ye (Beloved) learned this spiritual art long be∣fore this in other cases, you had never made so happy an ex∣change of Error for Truth, as now I esteem you to have done.
We have hitherto been coming out of darkness, error, and superstition but by degrees, and not all at once, now discover∣ing one error, and then another; and why then should not our former experience this wise, admonish us still of not being too confident of our having now discovered all Satanical, Pa∣pal, and anti-christian deceits, in doctrine and worship unto the bottome; but rather to be jealous over our own hearts
and judgements, lest some of those old dregs should yet be left behinde? Solomon says, that the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day: and yet where would there be place and opportunity of growing in knowledge and understanding, if there were not occasion even for Christians themselves, ever and anon to be changing their dark and crooked thoughts, for more lightsom and well rectified apprehensions?
It is a thing doubtlesse too to incident also even to otherwise good men themselves, not onely to put much of that affection they bear to the erroneous things they practise, into the ballance with the reasons upon which they act; by which means that seems to them ponderous, which otherwise in it selfe is as light as vanity; but also to presume and hope, that those seeming grounds which they have, will excuse them before God in their way and practise, though their confidence concerning them, suffers many a rebuke from the truth when it is laid close to the conscience by the Spirit of God. But the Spirit of truth, which loves and desires truth in the inward parts; though he patiently bears and indures much dis∣ingenuitie of this kinde in the mindes of men for a time, yet if his applications for cure hereof be alwaies slighted and neglected, it many times provokes him at last to leave them under the power of their owne deceivings, and to say; But if any man be ignorant (viz. upon such terms) let him be ignorant, 1. Cor. 14.38.
The day is now hastening apace, wherein the mighty God will reckon with the Babilonish whore for corrupting the earth with her deceits; and then the eye of Jesus Christ will be upon those, who have thorowly pleaded his cause, wholly followed him, and faithfully born witnesse to his truth against all her unsound and corrupt waies, to keep them from the hour of temptation that shall come upon all the world to try them, whereas those that have been partakers with her in her corruptions, must then be partakers with her in her sufferings, though otherwise they be the people of God themselves, unlesse
they have before that time, obeyed that voice which saith, come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. And therefore how exceedingly doth it concern all those who would be then found pure virgins indeed, and such as have not defiled their garments, no not with any the least of those whorish polutions, narrowly to consider such their ways, which are shreudly suspected for unclean, as they are whose nakednesse I have hereby laboured to discover.
Thus having (though not without weaknesse, yet) with much uprightnesse and true affection to you, spread my thoughts and apprehensions before you, as touching those things wherein I cannot close with you, (being neverthelesse not unwilling to retract any thing I have done, if ever the vanitie of it shall be discovered to me, as loving no way in Religion further then I apprehend it countenanced by the truth) and having herein satisfied my self in discharge of my duty towards you, I shall now commend this poore endeavour of mine to the blessing of the blessed God, and you unto his direction in the perusall of it, and shall God inabling me still endeavour to approve my selfe.
