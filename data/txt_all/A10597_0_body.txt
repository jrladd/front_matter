YOur large renowme and wel deserued prayse
(Most noble Lord) in prudent shal profounde,
In marcial feates, whose like in these our dayes
By iust accompt scarse any where is founde,
Ioyned with th'zeale borne to your countrey ground,
Hath prickt me forth, and much hath moued mee,
My poore good wil to shewe in some degree.


And for because your Lordships office is
Most worthely assigned by our Queene,
To viewe and see that nothing be amisse
About her horse and stable as I ween,
But that the same in time may be foreseene,
Vnto your Honour humbly I present
This Treatise smal, to further that intent:


Beseeching you to take this in good part,
Euen as the same with single minde is ment:
Way not the gift, regarde the geuers hart,
My trauayle shal happely be spent,
And you also resemble verament
That worthy ing, that tooke with thankful minde
A draught of water of a simple hinde.


Although this volume smal do seeme in sight,
No little foulte yet therein shal you finde,
A Larke in worth doth farre surmomit a Kite:
A grayne of golde by doome of eche mans minde,
A pounde of leade to passe is aye assignde:
The Diademe in value farre exceedes
Great massy rockes: fine flowers large stinking weedes.



This little booke shal teache you soone to knowe
Th'original cause of eche infirmitie,
That in an horse by any meanes may growe,
The name, the place of euery malady,
And howe you shal the cure thereto apply:
So as you may by remedies founde,
Preserue his health, and keepe him safe and sounds.


For though you haue a comely Courser great,
And Pegasus vnto his syre he haue,
Though passing trim the troden wayes he beate,
With loftie looke that trotteth fine and braue,
With raine as round as hare can wishe or craue
As trimly treade, can yarke aboue the grounde,
And seemely saulte and turne both light and rounde.


Although he can the Galliarde gallope to,
Passe the Carrier, the Cornettie can daunce,
Can fetche the Capriol, and other trickes can do,
As braue and fine as any hence to Fraunce:
What doth auayle these vertues to aduaunce,
By diligence thus brought to perfect frame,
If afterwarde he fal diseasde or lame?


Which to preuent this little Treatise vse,
That shal (I trust) in daunger him defende.
As time doth serue vouchsafe it to peruse:
And so most humbly here I doo intende
My leaue to take, beseeching in the ende
Almightie Ioue, whom you both loue and serue,
Your Lordship long in honour to preserue.
