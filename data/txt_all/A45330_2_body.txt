Esteemed Sir,
I Have now at last, in answer
to your desires, and in pur∣suance
of my promise, sent
you my Meditations on the
6th verse of the 82. Psalm.
Indeed soon after the Ser∣mon
was preached, I was sought to, that it
might be printed; But I was then scarce flegd
(not having in years equald the dayes of th
shortest month) and so unwilling to ventur
a flight into the world, lest I should fall.
And truly my Apology still must be with

the good Father (when the fruits of his
youth were stoln to the Press) Infans eram,Hiero. in proae. ad Obad. nec
dum scribere noveram; Nunc, ut nihil aliud pro∣fecerim,
saltem Socraticum illud habeo, Scio quod
nesio. Such as it is, I commend it to you;
and the more chearfully, because its younger
brother, which two or three years since, sup∣planted
it, and got away the birthright, did
meet with a blessing. The good Lord make
it instrumental (in these unhappy and unho∣ly
dayes, wherein Moses and Aaron, Magistra∣cy
and Ministry are trampled under foot)
for the glory of his Name, and the good of
his people. So prayeth he who never saw
you, yet loveth and honoureth you, and de∣sireth
to be frequently and fervently remem∣bred
by you at the throne of grace,
