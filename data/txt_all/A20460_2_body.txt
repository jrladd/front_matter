TO you sweet Prince I sacrifice these lines,
Princes should liue by princely disciâˆ£plines:
'Tis most collaterall Manna, Angels foode,
It's not so princely to bee great as good.
Planets rule man: but Princes, as they are
Cald gods, sway vs; by vertue rule their starre,
What almanaks haue written in their praise
In you haue greater power, that oreswaies
The doubt of art: for certainely we know
The full Moones of your vertues, how they grow:
I wish your life may runne, as doth your starre
Orbd noblie, and most nobly regular,
Or rather more: for heauenly things aboue
If they but crosse vs, haue more hate, then loue

The teeming plowman thus will curse their powers,
When starres doe promise more in shew, then showers:
But you are farre more prosprous, and shall shine
Blest in your influence, mortall and diuine.
Enough is said, in fine, this booke shall tell.
Tis good to be borne great, best to doe well.
