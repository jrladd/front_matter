Pardon me that I pay this debt so late; and accept of this parcell of my well-meant la∣bours; Wherein you shall see Salomon both in his rising and set∣ting; his rising hopefull and glorious, his declination fearfull; You shall see the proofes of his early graces; of mercy, in sparing Adonijah, and Abiathar; of iustice, in punishing that riuall
 of his, with Ioab, and Shimei: of wisedome, in his award be∣twixt the two Harlots, and the administration of his Court, and State: of pietie, in building and hallowing the Temple; all dashed in his fall, repaired in his repentance. J haue no cause to misdoubt either the acceptation, or vse of these mine high pit∣ched thoughts; which, together with your selfe, and your worthy and vertuous Lady, J humbly commend to the care and blessing of the highest; who am bound by your worth and merits to be euer
