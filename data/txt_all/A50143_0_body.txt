SIR,
YOUR Zeal to Suppress Vice, and particularly the growing and grievents Vice of Drunken∣ness, is very Laudable: God who so Accepted & Re∣warded the Zealous Phinehas, will not let it go with∣out Reward. But while as a Minister of God, You Employ the Sword of Justice, to punish Drunken∣ness, both in the English, and the Indians, You do, with Holy Sorrow complain of it, that You cannot Re∣form the English, of their Impiety in feeding the Lust of Drunkenness among the Indians. You had an Hope, it seems, that some Offenders, whom the Sword of Justice cannot reach, may be reach'd by the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Your Desire to one, who would approve himself a Minister of God, in another Order, that he would write therefore a Letter to those Offenders, is here answered. The Writing of Episiles is indeed an Ancient and an Usesu way to Do Good; continued even to this Day in the Churches of the Faithful. And for the Ru∣lers, to ask the Help of the Pastors, thus to Do Good, is an Example that has many charms in it. If You judge This may Do Good, among those who in deed are a sort of Sinners, that cannot be too Coarsely, or too Warmly address'd, it is entirely Left unto Your Wisdom, to Disperse it, How, and Where you please among them.
