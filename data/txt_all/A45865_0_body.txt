SIR,
THough I know you have ac∣quainted your self not on∣ly with all the Gentile and Politer Parts of Learning that serve either for Use of Accomplishments to those you your Quality, but are a very good Judge of Books of this kind; yet I am so well assured that you can be candid as well as just; and value Books by the Spirit and In∣tention, and Possibilities of their being useful, rather than the art∣ful Measures and Address with which they are written; That with∣out Ceremony or Apology, I presume
to present you with, and prefix your Name to one that has nothing but the Charity of its Intention to justi∣fie its being made Publick. The frequent Returns of the late pub∣lick Fasts, seeming to have made some Impressions on the Minds of People; and the seriousness that on those Occasions appeared in their Faces, giving some Grounds to hope that an Address of this Na∣ture, might be useful: This Con∣sideration prevailed over all the Ob∣structions that commonly lie in the way of such Attempts, and the Cha∣rity of the Design so over-ballanc'd the visible Imperfections with which it was managed, that without giv∣ing my Thoughts time to cool, these Papers were put out of my hands
with the haste and carelessness with which they were written. But ha∣ving suffered my Hopes and Wishes to surprize, rather than regularly gain a Consent to their becoming Publick; my Judgment, that re∣monstrated against the Book with so full a Consent, followed my In∣clinations in the Epistle; and the Uneasiness that accompanied the one, with so strong and irresistable a Biass, led me to the other, that I could not deny my self so sensible a Pleasure, as the publick acknow∣ledgment of the many Obligations you have laid upon me; for that generous Passion with which (I can by experience, say) you serve your Friends; as it redoubles the Obligations you lay upon them, so it
derives such a Value and Merit upon your Friendship and Favours, that it shall be ever my Ambition to Publish my self, and be Esteem∣ed
