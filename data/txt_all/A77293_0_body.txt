Right Honorable:
GOd having made you great among the People, in the great intrust∣ments, mercies, and deliverances he hath lent you, expects a great return of all from you in your doing good to his Saints, and exalt∣ing h service in the Land: and here I beseech you in all humi∣lity to have especiall care, that no power by Your Authority be set over the Fa∣mily of God other then what God hath set up of himself; And I desire you to examine the foundation layed for the Presbyterian Government, and I suppose there will appear sanctinesse, and not sufficiency from the Word to uphold it. The fear of God, and desre of your eternall wel-being, move me to mind you of the Covenant You and the People of God have made to God in the Land, and that in the matter of his worship, that it shall be according to the Word as near as may be. Now I presume in this small ensuing Treatise your Honors may see, a Reformation may be made for nearer to the Gospel rule, then I conceive any is yet made; And then not onely to God, but to Gods people also in the same thing on which ground they thought their greatest losse would be their greatest gain, in failing whereof, the Lords peoples expectations dye, and hopes fail within them. And lastly, I presume to present this to your Honors consideration, that untill you finde a way nearer to the Gospel-pattern then Presbytery is, I fear you will finde there will be but little peace in the Land: the foundation whereof must be layed in God, or it will not be good to you, nor those that love and serve You. Thus beseeching you to try the truth, and trust no man, and to set up Christ among us, as the Gospel sets out the way to set him up by onely, then the People shall be happie, and You high, and your Memory blessed in the generations to come. For all which,
