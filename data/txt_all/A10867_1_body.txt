AT MY LAST BEING at Prisacchi, vnderstanding by your fathers talke, that he minded to haue you a while in the Court, where hee hath spent the better part of his life▪ and because it is fre∣quented with all sortes of companies, as any place in Italy is. I haue directed this little booke, which if you read and marke diligently, shall be as it were a guide, to leade you from a number of snates which you may be trapt withall, also for your be∣hauiour in all companies: with many other things fit to be knowen of younge Gentlemen, and especi∣ally for sutch as haue not beene conuersant in all companies.
Fare ye well.
