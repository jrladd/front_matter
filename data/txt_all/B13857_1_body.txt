Right Honorable,
NOne can challenge so much right in these Me∣ditations, as your Lord∣ship, vnder whose happy shade they receiued their first concep∣tion: Vnder this Iuniper of yours,
haue I (not driuen by force, but drawne by pleasure) slept thus long, sweetly, safely; and haue receiued these Angelicall touches: How iustly may your Lordship claime the fruits of your owne fauours? Your carefull studies in this booke of God, are fit to bee exemplary; which haue so en∣riched you, that your teacher shall gaine. In this reach of diuine thoughts, you shall see Benhadads in∣solence taken downe by Ahabs victo∣ry, an humble (though Idatrous) Israelite carrying it from an insul∣ting Pagan: You shall see in Ahab the impotent passions of greatnesse, in Naboth, bleeding honesty; in Ie∣zebel bloudy hypocrisie, cruell craft; plotting from hell, pretending from heauen: You shall see the wofull suc∣cesse of an vniust mercy; Ahab for∣faiting
what hee gaue, killed by him, whom hee should haue killed; You shall see resolute Michaiah opposing the mercenary Synode of Prophets, a beaten victor, an imprisoned free∣man; You shall see Ahaziah falling through his grate; Elijah climbing vp his mount, mounting vp to his glo∣ry; fetching fire from heauen, fetch't by a fiery charet to heauen. Elisha the heire of his mantle, of his spirit, no lesse maruellous in his beneficences, in his reuenges. What doe I foretell all? Mee thinkes I feele my selfe now too like an Italian host, thus to meet your Lordship on the way, and to promise before-hand your fare, and intertainment: Let it please your Lordship rather to see and allow your cheere; Indeed the feast is Gods, and not mine, wherein store striues with
delicacie; If my cookery hurt it not, it is enough: Through your hands, I commend it to the world, as I doe your Lordship, and my honorable good Lady to the gracious protection of the Almightie; iustly vowing my selfe
