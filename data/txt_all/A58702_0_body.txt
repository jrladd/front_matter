My LORD,
THey that say they make Dedicati∣ons to shew their Gratitude to their Patrons: do, in my opinion, at the same time secretly insinu∣ate the worth and value of their own Works. Not to acknowledge my Obligations to your Lordship, were great want of Breeding; But, to say I present you this Sermon out of Gratitude, were a greater want of modesty; And I hope I know my self better, than to have any such presumption.
I profess ingeniously, that the chief reason that induc'd me to prefix your Lordships Name to this Discourse, was (according to the old use of Dedication) to do the thing all the credit it was capable of; and if, at the same time, though contrary to my intentions, I have displeased Your
 Lordship, in desiring, or rather violently arrogating your Protection; yet I have this inward consolation, that my good meaning, (especially with so good a man) may, in some measure, apologize for my Errour.
Again, my Lord, every body knows, what both your self and your Noble Family have suffer'd for his late Ma∣jesty of happy Memory; so that, what you can possibly suffer in a discourse of him, will be so inconsiderable, that it will scarce deserve the mentioning.
God Almighty make us truly sensible, and ever mind∣ful of what is past, and keep us from ever seeing the like again, is the hearty Prayer of,
My Lord,
