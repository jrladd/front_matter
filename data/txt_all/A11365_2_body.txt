HOnourable Sir, the
knowledge of your
Iudgement in the
point of Historicall
Iudicature, ioyned with the re∣membrance
of your gracious fa∣vours,
haue incouraged me to con∣secrate
those intire Fragments,
which are extant in the fiue
Bookes of Salusts Histories, to∣gether

with two Orations to Cae∣sar,
and one against Cicero, to
your learned and Iuditious cen∣sure;
rendred, as I hope they are,
without losse of the Latine salt.
If your Noblenesse shall accept this
first mite of his thankefull offrings,
you shall incourage him to higher
attempts, and oblige him to re∣maine
for euer,
