Right Honourable,
SINCE Your Favourable Acceptance of this Sermon, hath Produced Your Order for my making it thus Pub∣lick, I do here Humbly Present You with it: In Composing whereof it was my whole Aym and Endea∣vour, to promote as well as I was able, the Proper Business, and that which ought to be the only Design of Publick Days of Hu∣miliation. Namely, the Atoning of the Divine Displeasure, by so Penitent a Sense of our Personal Sins, and the Sins of our Nation that cry aloud for Vengeance, as is followed with the For∣saking of them, and with hearty Endeavours, in our several Stations, to be Instrumental as much as in us lies, towards a General Reformation. To which, I doubt, there never was in any People a more Obstinate Aversness, than is at this present to be observed among us. The Consideration whereof makes the hearts of Good Men Ake to think, what at last may become of us, after the Wonderful Things God hath from time to time, and now of late, done for us. It can be at no time Excuseable, but

is on Fasting-days Unpardonable, to be Mealy-mouth'd, and Shy of justly Representing the Untoward State we are in, with the true Cause; thereof; or of impartially Enumerating and Exposing our Reigning Sins; or to be sparing in Re∣proving those Vices and Follies, which are grown so Popular, as with very many among us to pass for Virtues. And the only Apology I shall make to those, who may happen to be Offended at several Passages in the Applicatory Part of this Discourse, is, that if we spare to speak now, we may for ever hold our Peace. But the Truth is, We are under no small Discouragement to hope for Success upon those men, who stand in most need of Plain-dealing; since long Experience assures us, that these have made themselves Sermon-Proof. Yet how∣ever, Whether they will Hear, or whether they will Forbear, there is great Satisfaction in having faithfully done our Duty, and discharged our Consciences.
Now that God would Multiply His Blessings, upon this Great and Renowned City; and especially on Yourselves, who (under Their Majesties) have the Chief Government thereof: And make You Happy Instruments in the diverting of His Iudgments from it, by Vigorously Setting Yourselves to the Sup∣pressing of the Vices that Abound in it (which will be Your Crown and Glory at the Great Day) is the Hearty Prayer of,
Right Honourable,
