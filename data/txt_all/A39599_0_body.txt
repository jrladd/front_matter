SIR,
SO remarkeable, and conspicu∣ous, in the view of all the neighbouring parts of our Country, are the expressions of your noble patronage, and support, both of my selfe, and ministry, that each eye (al∣most) observes it; and more tongues speake of it; yet every pious heart, that ever reaped any profit from my poore, and unworthy la∣bours (next under the free grace of God) acknowledge your selfe the chiefe and grand instrument of the

Joshua his practice against Achan, to declare to the world that by your countenancing and in∣couraging the vertuous and opposing the profane and vitious, you have approved your selfe to the whole Corner in generall, and my selfe above all in particu∣lar, against all the Achans and troublers of our peace and libertie, a true Joshua; which shall ever be ac∣knowledged by
