DEAR CHRISTIANS,
MY hearts desire is, that you may be saved; for your sakes I have pub∣lished these four Sermons, to

direct and incourage you in the right way to life eter∣nal: our soules are of great value, and the salvation of them is not easily attained un∣to, all our care and paines for them is little enough, for strait is the way to life, and few find it. If you please to read, remember, and practise these Sermons, I hope, with Gods blessing, you shall reap much benefit to your soules; while you and I live upon earth, remember me in your prayers, that we may all grow

fruitfully in saving grace, and may have a joyful meeting in heaven at last, which God the Father grant us for his dear Sons sake: So prayeth,

from my house in Eccles∣feild.
