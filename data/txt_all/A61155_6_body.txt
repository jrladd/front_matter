BRETHREN, Meeting ye but of the Assembly, or that bounder appointed ye by Par. I cannot just∣ly be denied this reasoning with ye; for the Ordi∣nance by which ye sit, doth enable ye only to advise ofSee Ordin. Iu. 12 1643. P. 4. things propounded, but not to propound or demand any as ye have done of late; so as in this ye have brought your selves down to the same magnitude with us that are private men: Here is the difference now; Ye are many of better parts and abilities; I am as one borne out of duetime; yet the same Covenant is upon me with your selves; nor ought I because I am but one, presume to see Truth more then one, because ye are many; Nay, it is that voyce from the excellent2 Pet. 1. 17. glory which both you and I must heare, and which can only teach us Truth; It is not the voyce of any other. And surely, since Truth hath had its lot in the world to lve upon voyces in Assemblies and Synods, where that is only Truth which is voted so, and not in its own glory and evidence, where that is only Truth which is so: The Mystery of iniquity hath been more advanced then the Mystery of godlinesse.
