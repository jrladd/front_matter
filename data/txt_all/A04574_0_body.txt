MOst Reuerend Fa∣ther in God: your loue and zeale to the truth, haue encou∣raged mee to pre∣sume to dedicate this Sermon to your Grace: which beggeth shelter vnder your religious and iudicious Approbation. And the subiect thereof, which is the preaching of the Gospell (against whose truth & maintenance, there are so many oppo∣sites, which would (if they could) ouer∣throw Gods house, and eate vp his chosen people as they wold eate bread)
 may seeme iustly to challenge no lesse at your hands. And the Church knows your zeale to Religion to be such, that although you may bee well wearied with multitude of causes, yet you will neuer be deficient in vndertaking the defence of the truth: you being a prin∣cipall Pillar of State, and Patron of Ver∣tue & Iustice Hîc ames dici pater at{que} pri∣mas. I suppose I shall haue both Papists and Schismatickes against me: it hath alwayes bin my lot hitherto, & I glory in it, and passe not for them al, so I may enioy your Graces lawfull fauor to defend this truth. And so with my dai∣ly prayers vnto almighty God, to pro∣tect your Grace from all dangers, and to grant you many and happy dayes:
I humbly take my leaue, this 13. of Ianuary 1621.
