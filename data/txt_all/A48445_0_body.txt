My Lord,
I Present this Book to Your Lordship in this Publick and Solemn manner, moved there∣to by good Reasons: Knowing

with what Respect and Honour You are wont to treat the Me∣mory of the Reverend and Pious Man, the Author, and the great Esteem You express to have of his Studies. To whom there∣fore the Sight of these Tracts, some Genuine Remains of that excellent Divine, will not, I know, be unacceptable.
I was willing also this way to express my Sense of Your Lordship's obliging Favours to∣wards me, which You have been pleased to shew, not only upon Account of our antient Acquain∣tance, and equal Standing in the Uni∣versity, but chiefly in respect of those Studies I have of late addicted my self to; which You (a

known Patron and Furtherer of all good Learning) have been always ready to assist and pro∣mote. You have, my Lord, af∣forded me the free Use of Your singular Library, stored with so many and so choice Manuscripts, together with such Antique, and to the present Generation scarce heard of, Books and Treatises, when Printing was but, as it were, in its Infancy. And besides, You have got me the sight of other valuable Manuscripts. Whereby I must gratefully acknowledge the considerable Improvements I have made in my Searches into the Historical Affairs of this Church, when it first began to reform Abuses, and to vindicate it self from Rome, and as it happily

proceeded under our two first Pro∣testant Princes. Which must be more amply owned, in case any of my Studies of this Nature here∣after see the Light.
I beseech Your Lordship there∣fore to take in good part this my Presumption, and to accept of the humble Respects of,
My Lord,
