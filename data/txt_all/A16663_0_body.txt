Right Worshipfull,
MY thankful thoughts long wandring, seriously,
Which way I might my gratefull heart apply,
Fully and fitly to expresse & show
The infinite perpetuall debt Iowe
To both your Worship, and your Families,
For many free and friendly courtesies
To me and mine: In stept this little Booke,
And my desire t'accomplish undertooke.
Vpon which proffer, promptly I laid hold,
And most respectively have (thus) made bold
To dedicate both It and my poore All
To both your Worships due memoriall:
Both, as a Symboll of my sincere heart
Obliged by indelible desert;
As also, that like Philips little Lad,
This Trumpet may sound a Memento glad
Vnto your Wor. Soules with comfort sweet,
Here, to prepare with God in Christ to meet,
To shake off all earths clogs and Remora's
Which hurt or hinder us with dull delayes,
From running (here) our race with patience,
From winning the reward of recompence.
In both which bound respects, I humbly pray
That this my little Tract, Last Trumpet may
Sound sweetly in your Worships ares & minde,
And friendly favour and acceptance finde,
To'rd him, who ever, ev'ry way is bound
To you and yours to rest and to be found
