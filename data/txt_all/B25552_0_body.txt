HEavens darling, Charls, great Britains joy,
The neighbour world's surprise and wonder,
VVhose patience hath all wrongs brought under,
And prayers could all plots destroy;
VVhose Kingdomes long have been the Stage
Of madness, and rebellious rage;
Deign, with a lowly look, to read
His zeal who from the Baltick Isles
(Opprest with neighbour force the whiles)
To Heaven did, praying for Thee, plead.
