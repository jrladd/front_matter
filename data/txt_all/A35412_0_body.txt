May it please Your Majesty,
SO soon as I had finish'd this Poem (and indeed while I was composing it) I hop'd it might not be unwelcome to YOUR MAJESTY, since it presents (tho not so perfectly as I could wish) the Character of the Greatest Man that lives, whose Person must ever be so dear to YOUR MAJESTY and the Kingdom.
What I have now Writ, I beg YOUR MAJESTY to Accept, not as the Work of a Low, Servile Pen, but as the Zeal of a Man that desires to raise his Thoughts as high as Truth and Justice.
With this Mind I have represented King William and King Lewis as Ʋnlike as they really are, as Con∣trary as Light and Darkness; which I have done with respect to King Lewis (as a Crown'd Head) greater than he Personally deserves.
Several Pens are now employ'd by that King to write his Life; but whatever they can say, Truth is Truth, and will be too mighty for King Lewis; no doubt the

Praises of Nero, Domitian, Commodus, and other Monsters of Human Nature were writ by as Ingenious Men as any France can boast of, tho none of their Works have Surviv'd, as indeed they neither ought nor could, being against all Truth and Modesty; but after their Deaths the Histories of these Wicked Tyrants were Impartially writ, and their Names recorded Odi∣ous to Posterity; while the Excellent Characters of Au∣gustus, Nerva, Trajan, and other Good Princes and Patriots (which were writ in their own Times, and which Themselves had the Satisfaction to read) have descended Ages, and will probably last as long as the World.
This Great Reward of Vertue will be paid to the KING's and YOUR OWN MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY, whose Memories must be, as Your Lives, Glorious.
That Your Lives may long continue so, that the greatest of Earthly Blessings may be preserved to these Nations, and indeed to the World, is the most Earnest Prayer of,
