Worthy Sir;
SInce it is thought fit by some, at the importunitie of many, that these Sermons should come forth in publick: I have attempted to Dedicate the same to you, in re∣spect of your many favours, and my obligations. You were pleased to honour the Authour with the tuition of your first-born, Mr. Ashfield O∣gle, the excellencie of your strength, the hopes of his countrey, the delight of all that knew him; who prevented his Tutour in the heaven∣ly glory, but he soon followed after him: and, I trust, as they oft conversed and prayed together here on earth, so they are now together prai∣sing God, and singing Halleluiah in heaven.
 Sir, the title to these is not unfitly yours; for you are one of those, whose portion is not in this life onely: but you have a glorious inheri∣tance reserved for you in the heavens, through the free-grace of God our Saviour, who came into the world to save sinners; to whose grace I commend you, and your vertuous Consort, and resolve my self,
SIR,
