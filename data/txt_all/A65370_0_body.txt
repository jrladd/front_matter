May it please your Highness,
I Have not presumed to present this mean and slender Colle∣ction of Minerals unto your Highness view, forth of confidence

of its own worth, though there may be some things in it not unfit for the knowledge of so High and Noble a Person: But rather in respect of the transcendent worth of the Sub∣ject it treateth of, being the most abstruse and most excellent part of all Natural Philosophy; being here∣unto especially moved by two rea∣sons. One is, That your Highness being a Member of the Royal So∣ciety (one of the happy fruits of His Majesties blessed and mira∣culous Restauration, and that which will speak him glorious to all suc∣ceeding Generations, beyond all his Royal Progenitors) stands there∣by in some measure obliged to be an encourager, and cherisher of all attempts (though of the lowest and meanest persons) that tend to

the advancement of Experimental Philosophy. This (may it please your Highness) did heighten my hopes, that I might receive the same candor (in some measure) that your Highness seemeth to have afforded to all. Another is the propension, and inclination that (as I am informed) your Highness bears in a particular man∣ner to this worthy and commen∣dable Science of Minerals and Me∣tals. The onely thing (besides the craving pardon for my bold∣ness) is, that I humbly beg of your Highness, that if your spare hours will allow, you may sometimes make a perusal of it, and if your Highness be pleased to put to your helping hand, that this kind of knowledge may be

more heedfully sought into, and promoted, and that others of far greater abilities, may communi∣cate some part of their knowledge, it is all that is desired by
