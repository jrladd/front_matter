MOST GRACIOVS and DREAD SOVERAIGNE,
MAY it please Your MAIESTIE, out of your Princely Clemency, which exceeding all things, yet enclaspes the least, to vouchsafe to these poore labours (true Benoni-es, the sonnes of my sorrow, so many disasters haue annoyed them from the wombe, and some with the perill of their parents life) the skirt of your royall cloathing, or but the shadow of your

skirt, Acceptance with Patronage: Ʋndertaken at first by your MAIESTIES commandement, for the repulsing of the lewde slaunders of a namelesse Papist, and to redeeme the credit of a re∣nowmed Bishop; but continued to the confirmation of Your MA∣IESTIES leige people, in their Reiligion to GOD, and their Obedience to your MAIESTIE, with all subiection. In qui∣bus duobus, vniuersa Lex pendet, & Prophetae, (to speake it in his words, whose doctrine it was most, yea whose onely errand it was, as Hegesippus testifies) I meane, in seeking the face of GOD, and his IACOB, as some euen Papists haue noted vpon that Psalme, that they are distinguished there not without cause, and the one is consequent, or to be consequent, to the other.
But not so the Cardinall (the more too blame he) a maine stick∣ler in these Controuersies (after the Pope and the Pioners) that encomber the world; and I know not by what lucke, though Cer∣uini generis animal, yet Your MAIESTIES audacious con∣current in the cause. Who if he were younger, perhaps hee might be borne with, either fancying his superstitions, or fostering his se∣ditions: As the Stoicke Philosopher was wont to say, that a young man at Sea, if hee abandon the Shippe to walke ashoare a while, and either digge some roote, or gather some shell which the Sea casts forth, there is no danger in it; but in an olde man it is dangerous, whome death, and sickenesse, and sundry casualties may preuent, from euer recouering ship againe. Yet he in his deuoutest meditations of all other, his booke last set forth de Aeterna Fae∣licitate, will not excuse Kings from beeing murthered de iure, (not onely de facto) onely hee passes it ouer as a casus omissus, happily because anouched in his other Volumes more perempto∣rily.
Of another minde was his Vnckle, of whome hee brags in one place, contesting with your MAIESTIE, (though S. Chryso∣stome note, that S. Pauls sisters sonne, of whome there is mention in the Acts, was neuer a whit the blesseder for his Ʋnckles vertue, and as it may seeme neuer any good came of him; saue onely that he reuealed the Iewes conspiracie against Paul, which this man would rather defend the concealing of) but Marcellus secundus,

of whome I was saying, (witnesse the Historian that alleadges friendship (for more faith) and some intimitie witdim) In animo habuerat omnem militiam à se prorsus abigere, ipsos etiam corporis custodes exauctorare (whereas Bellarmine lately vrged this Pope to draw the sword, if fame say true; his Vnckle not admitting of necessarie Defence, if it were forcible;) cum illud saepe repeteret, multos principes viros, non tam armis de∣fensos, quàm signo Crucis, &c. (himselfe hauing been lately Cardinall Sanctae Crucis.) And in particular of the Pope, Pon∣tificem maximum neutiquam indigere, aut scutis, aut gla∣dijs (indeede Athanasius remooues all iron from the Apostles, and S. Austen will not haue them strike, though they may carrie weapons, ferre ferrum, but not ferire) satius{que} esse ipsum si res ferat occîdi, quàm tam indecorum exemplum praeberi Ec∣clesiae, namely as for the Pope either to handle a sword, or giue allowance to others, at his direction, so to doe.
So as no maruell, if the same man, considering the practises of such as were Popes in his time, clapt his hand once vpon the ta∣ble, protesting in great earnestnes, that it seemed impossible for a Pope (as things then went) to be saued. And another saies, it was the voice of almost all men in those daies, that a Pope could not be saued, when this Marcellus came to it. I know not what cōtentment the Cardinall may take in his new skarlet-additions, which they would make vs beleeue he accepted of so lothly; but for my part, I should thinke one day of his Vnckles, (as Tullie saies of Antonie, compared with his grandfather) were more to be de∣sired, then a whole age of the Cardinalls, lending his pen and bending his wit to the defence of such trumperies, and, which is worse, of such treacheries, as are now in vre with them; the di∣slike whereof, and onely intended Reformation, cost his Ʋnckle his life, and that in very short space, after he came to the Popedome.
Of whome, because I haue said so much, almost before I was a∣ware, I will not , trouble Your Royall eare (as that Councell speakes, which forbids Clerks to disturbe Kings, not onely in their states, or liues, (as now the fashion is,) but so much as in their leisures:) onely this it may please Your MA∣IESTIE

giue me leaue to adde, That the Pope whome I speake of (as Onuus testifies) OMNEM ECCLESIASTI∣CAM IVRISDICTIONEM, viris profanis, & nullis sacris initiatis, demandare cogitaverat; had a purpose to tran∣slate all Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction to meere Lay-men: he calls them profane; but the more vehemently he expresses it, the more it makes for vs, and against themselues: the Papists all so stor∣ming at the thing this day, and the Adioynder by name (with whome therefore I haue a dealing about this point somewhat at large) in Your MAIESTIES high Prerogatiue, and iustest Title; allowing You, by no meanes, Ecclesiasticall Iurisdicti∣on: (if happily You should euer fulfil their suspicion of owning it:) Though KINGS were so farre from beeing counted profane, by the auncient Synods of CHRISTS Church, that their letters were holy to them, their syllables holy, their palace holy, their very bed-chamber holy, and all that was about them, or belong∣ed to them, sacred and holy, in the style of those godly times, and Fathers.
Where I cannot but obserue, the prouidence of GOD, that re∣quites humane actions, and how euen a course it keepes with our courses. For as the intents were good, which Marcellus fostered, but no effects followed, nay rather his Nephew drawes now backe most of all, and mainly opposes his Vnckles determinations: So we read, that the Cardinalls in fauour of his person (because repu∣ted honest, and well be loued amongst them) decreed to haue his charges of the direption of his house and houshold stuffe, (a graue custome no doubt, and worthie of Christs Vicar, to haue all ri∣fled, and ransackt, that the people can but lay hands of, when he is chosen Pope) to be repaid him of the publique; but it was neuer done (saith the Historian) till this day.
But to leaue the Vnckle (sith our question is not whether the Popes may keepe guards about their persons, but whether Kings crownes, or (if that be more deare) their liues are to be wholly at the Popes disposing) and to returne to the Nephew; He is peremp∣torie, as I said, in his most mortified Treatise, and the fore-runner of his ende (as he would haue it thought at least) that Kings are

subiect to murther, at best: First, de facto; though the Scripture as it flatters not, nor no where diuerts vs from the consideration of our mortality, so it leades vs to speake of KINGS and Princes in another straine; as if they that ought not to be violated by any mor∣tall hand, could not die at all, or at least not die, till God himselfe assoild them of the bands of this bodie. How was he slaine (saies Dauid of Saul) as if he had not beene annointed with oyle? And, O King, liue for euer, saies the Prophet Daniel, not any courtly flatterer. The Kings soule is bound vp with God in the bundle of life, as it were Gero in sinu, nec discingor; fast bound, and not to shedde out. The period of their gouernment, is cum Sole & Luna, as long as the Sunne and Moone endu∣reth. And though they die like men, (that is, quatenus homi∣nes, non quatenus Reges) yet we are to remember, that they fall like one of the PRINCIPES, that is, one of the Angels (saies the Cardinall himselfe, among others, vpon that Psalme) who we know are not iudged, till GOD iudges them: though, no doubt but that aggrauates their iudgement so much the forer.
And whereas the Scripture so often, entitles the constitution of Kings to GOD, it may be it is to shew, that their authoritie is in∣abrogable; as the Platoniques hold opinion, that whatsoeuer is mortall, was produced by some mediation of the vile creature, as man of the dust, most things of the materia prima, &c. but that which immediatly proceedes of God himselfe, as the soules of men, and the Angells, and the heauens, they are immortall. So of Princes.
Yet the Cardinall not content with a death de facto, im∣plyes that they may be slaine de iure too, though he affirme vpon the other onely, which belike was enough to serue his turne in that place. No more Ceruinus now, nor of the mothers breed (which was the better of the two) but —as Constantine be∣spake Arius in the Nicene Councell, somewhat merrily; for the one hath Mars, the other warre, and weapons, and threats in his name; and as the one opposed the naturall, so the other the my∣sticall Christ, he in his person, this in his offices and principall of∣ficers; but each of thē to the most lamentable embroyling of Chrsts

Church. And as the one of them was quelled by the Imperiall Constantine, iudicially proceeding, and Synodically sentencing him, with his band of three hundred and eighteene Bishops; So a∣gainst the other, God hath excited Your most excellent MAIE∣STIE, but without the trouble or labour of an Ecclesiastique Sy∣node, to ouerthrow him by YOVR pen, and the pen of one onely Bishop of Your many; yet worth many, where all most worthy.
And albeit Your MAIESTIE needes no Defender, a∣bounding with so many continually about Your Person, guar∣ding the bed, and girding to them the sword (as the Spouse speakes) (besides Your owne inherent puissance inuincible) yet because what I haue now vttered concerning the Cardinall and his mortified propositions (crossing with Your MAIE∣STIES both State and Honour, as much as may bee) I haue vttered it with the priuitie of many of Your leige people, (whom I confesse, as before, that my especiall care hath been to confirme, and whereof some perhaps will not disdaine to cast their eies vpon these papers, if at least they may passe with Your MAIESTIES approbation) it were worth the considering, what correspondence such grounds haue with the auncient doctrine, which the Cardi∣nall and his followers would seeme so close to follow. Of Chry∣sostome, for one, That a Soueraigne King is accountable to none (not onely to his Subiects, but) not so much as to his Suc∣cessor, (as Dauid said euen now, that he is to be iudged like the Angels, that is, by God, and by God onely, and neither liuing nor dead by any other:) The same Chrysostome againe noting in another place, that where as the Psalmist passes ouer other mira∣cles of the wildernesse in deepe silence, he insists onely vpon the death of Og and Sehon, two mightie Monarches; because Kings liues are so wholly in Gods hands, and the disposition of them is al∣way miraculous, reserued and appropriated to God himselfe. Of Basil, That a King is subiect to no Iudge: Of Ambrose, that nullis tenetur legibus, not onely the King of Israel, but not the King of Egypt: Or (because the Papists make his case the worse of the two, that should bee the better in all reason,) not onely the King of Egypt, but not the King of Israel; for he saies it of both of

thē, & in two seuerall places. Of that Pope in Theodoret (Ana∣stasius I take it) who persecuting Flauian (as his Predecessours had done for a long time before) Theodosius that was their arbi∣ter, bidde the Pope let goe Flauian (because hee sawe there was malice) and argue against himselfe, as if he were Flauian, giuing him good leaue to say what hee could. To whome that Pope most submissely; We may not doe so, if please your Maiestie, it is not lawfull for vs to implead a King; not onely in his per∣son, but not personating another, not fictione iuris, as the Lawyers say. Yea the verie heathen Poet, and one of the wret∣chedest, yet he had so much grace in him, as to make seruants thē∣selues safe vnder a Crowne (though worne not for Soueraignty, but for Solemnity onely, as was the fashion in their festiuals) . As for that which follows, , &c. it is right the doctrine of our moderne Ie∣suites concerning Kings, that if first they be decrowned, then they may be vsed, no longer as Kings, but as priuate men, that is, abused at pleasure. Euen the Cardinall himselfe opens his eyes at last, (the case is so cleare) and acknowledges as much. The STE∣VVARD of a house (saies he) may be deposed by none, but only by the grand-master of the Family: which is God in the world, as the Steward in the State is the King, by analogie. Not but that his meaning is as trayterous as euer (for he vnderstands it of his Pope) but I suppose Your MAIESTIES name was partly fatall to giue him light (which is the character of Supremacy en∣grauen in you by God) and partly it confirmes my opinion of him, that if Your MAIESTES Bookes and rare trauailes in this cause (out of which we all take, that now write any thing) had been but read of him when he was young, and afore he was embondaged in this damnable preiudice, he would haue yeelded to the spirit and power which they are fraught with, acknowledged your proofes, submitted to your reasons, admired Your MAIESTIES & cor & linguam; and finally thanked God for him his conuerter, whom now he is faine to endure his confuter. But, longa dies quid non captiuat? making vs, as S. Chrysostome sayes, , to preferre euen garlicke before Ambrosia.

But although not he (froward as he is) yet there are others in∣finite both forreiners & domesticks, that profit by Your MAIE∣STIES peerelesse writings daily; not onely to the enlarging of their skill and knowledge (whereof your Works may seeme to be an Vniuersall Seminarie) but to their redeeming from ruine (which Vn-subiection drawes to) and building them vp to euer∣lasting saluation in the world to come, with quiet mindes and content in this present, which before they wanted. And truely our hope is, that the Rights which Your MAIESTIE shall transmitt to your posteritie, as nobly cleared by Your pen, as euer they were wonne by your Auncestors swords, will both breed much peace to the Land in generall, and great security to Your royall offspring the inheritours, confusion to the aduersaries, and barkers against Soueraignty; euen as long as either learning shall be held in price, or a man shall be left aliue to reuolue bookes.
Whereof because this worke pursues the remainders, and treads the same way, though in a most improportionable distance, once a∣gaine imploring Your MAIESTIES sacred Patronage, wor∣thie to be a Sanctuarie to a greater trespasser) both out of Your loue to the cause, and out of Your loue to the coate, (which is so great and so gratious, as no fame will be so niggard, but to record it to the furthest ensuing ages,) I beseech the GOD of ALL things, euen for his deare SONNES sake, (which is our hope, and our glorie, defending Your MAIESTIE, and by Your MAIESTIE defended) to accōplish his rare Graces vpon Your MAIESTIES Royall Head: Or, in stead of augmenting them, to adde but this one more blessing, to the many that he hath multi∣plied, super virum dextrae suae, super Regem , eun∣dem{que} Phil-ecclesiasticum, (in whome no bodie could euer discerne any cause of doubt, saue onely whether Your zeale to the Church, or to the Clergie, were greater) euen PERPE∣TVITIE and AETERNITIE, the Imperiall style, and pa∣trimonie of Kingdomes, in the most Orthodoxe language.
