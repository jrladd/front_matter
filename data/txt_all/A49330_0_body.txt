Dread Soveraign,
I Have read so many lying Books set forth
Of great St. George wch much obscur'd his worth,
That much I mus'd and grieved for to see
None of the sharers in the Daphnean Tree,
For King, for Patron, and for Countries sake,
Did such a glorious Subject undertake:
And their neglect only made me so bold,
Though aged now eighty and two years old,
with my old withered Hand to write upon
The noblest Subject that the world hath one,
And have with all Sincerity set down,
St. George his Martial deeds and Martyrdom:

Vouchsafe then gratious Monarch for to take
This little Poem for your Patrons sake:
For in my judgement never English King
Had greater cause than You, to honour Him:
Heroick force and Martial form withal,
Twixt King and Patron were collateral,
And that bright Orb where Mars is stellifi'd,
'Did equal influence 'twixt you both divide:
And your great daring both as boundless were
As that bold youth's, Apollo's Charioteer:
Be pleased then earths greatest Martial King,
To hear your Vassal on your Patron sing,
And do vouchsafe him your propitious eyes,
He perisheth unless you Patronize.

July 6. 1664.
