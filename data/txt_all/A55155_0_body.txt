May it please Your Majesty,
THE Character Your Majesty was pleas'd publicly to afford the History of Ox∣fordshire, when You last vouchsafed your Univer∣sity of Oxford the Honor of a visit, gives me confidence to
lay the like account of Staf∣fordshire at Your Majesties feet, and appeal once more to Your Roial Judgment; where∣in if succesful, I shall little va∣lue what other men think; but cheerfully acquiesce in Your Majesties decision, as in duty becoms
