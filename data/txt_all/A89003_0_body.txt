HAving penned my Meditations
about Church Government, I
had some thoughts to commend
them (right Christian and Ho∣nourable
Senate) to your conside∣ration
and protection. But being
conscious to my self of my own
weaknesse, I was sometime in
suspence, as thinking it too high
presumption for me so to do. But
for so much as that which I have here written, is, as I am
perswaded the Truth of God, and tends to the entituling of
you to that power which of right belongs unto you, as I doubt
not, but yee out of your own profound wisdome are inclinable
to think and hold: (whereby if yee do not speedily set this
power aworke, Divisions and Errours and Contentions are
likely to increase amongst us more and more, and so for want
of a timely provision made, Iniquity and Heresie to abound

more, to the blemishing of our Church and Gods high disho∣nour)
I have made bold, as a feeling member of Christs my∣sticall
body, to present it to your honourable view. And if upon
perusall yee shall think it to be the Truth, I beseech you im∣brace
it, and knowing what the power is, which in a Chri∣stian
Kingdome ought to beare sway both in Church and
Common-wealth, for the curbing and punishing of all evill
doers, delay not to set it up. And eadem opera, quell the di∣vision
so dangerous, which ariseth from the groundlesse di∣stinction,
as I conceive, betwixt Government Civill and Ec∣clesiasticall
amongst us, and let the sword of the Magistrate
be regularly sharpned against those new upstart blasphemous
Seducers, upon whom it shall appeare that the sword of the
spirit can do no good, and in this so necessary a worke the God▪
of Heaven direct and blesse your pious endevours, that 
already he hath done great and mighty acts by you for the 
of the Church and Commonwealth, so he may make you instru∣ments 
of this good to his Church also. And so 
ving pardon for my presumption, and that it may be 
to a good desire, I rest ready whether approved or reproved, to
submit to your censures.
