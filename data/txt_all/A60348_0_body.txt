Dear Brother,
GOD having made a great Breach upon you, by taking away her who was the delight of your eyes; and I having seen the Body she left behind, laid to Rest in its bed of Dust, was hen by you put upon this last Office of Love, in Preaching o your People on that occasion; nor did I draw back; ut being that very Evening seized by, and for some time ontinued under a Sharp Distemper, I could not Study a New Sermon, but was forced to entertain you with one I ad Preached in mine own Congregation, but a little before, pon the Death of a Young Gentlewoman, Mrs. Susan Hatchman; the Text put into my hand, as what in eer Health she had chosen for that purpose: Well; it aving been Preached, you earnestly desir'd the Publishing f it, and would needs have it from the Pulpit sent to the Press; thereupon it is done; and I have enough, so it do much good. I heartily sympathized with you; for indeed I ove you; the good Lord sanctifie the Affliction, and sweeten t, and make it up to you. I said nothing in her Commendatiâˆ£on;

while many do not deserve it, she did not need it. Her works praise her, so do you, and the Tongues of them that knew her. I desire that he who can, would fill up her room, comfort your heart, help you in your work, and prosper it; and having been your God, be the God of your Seed, that those young Branches may flourish in his Courts, and bring forth much precious Fruit in their Season. I leave you where, I hope, I found you, under the healing wings of the Sun of Righteousness, which are able to cure all Wounds, and to supply all Wants; and so remain,

November 20. 1691.
