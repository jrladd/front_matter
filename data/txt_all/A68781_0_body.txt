RIGHT HONOVRABLE;
THis short ensuing Discourse (begotten and brought forth in the silent houres of a solitary retire∣ment) I intended at first for the vse of some priuate friends, whom I desired to satisfie in the parti∣cular discouery of an English Spa wa∣ter. It pleased some of them vpon view
 hereof to moue me to publish it, for that in the whole passage, I personate my selfe an eye-witnesse of all cir∣cumstances; which they perswaded me would giue a better glosse vnto the subiect, than any here-say relation.

Hence is it that I haue presumed (not omitting the tie of ma∣ny noble refreshments, and honoura∣ble fauours) to appropriate this subiect (which presenteth vnto the world one of Natures choisest Iewels) vnto your Honour; vnder the Sanctuary of whose vertuous protection, I am bold to promise to my selfe inuiolable safe∣ty from the rage of all snarling detra∣ction. It may be, your noble Lord (to whose immerited support of my weak fortunes I shall euer owe a gratefull memory) might expect the addresse of
 my first fruits vnto his Honour, but I purposely reserue my selfe till a more ample occasion be presented, wherein my paines may be more enlarged.
I haue no greater hope to animate my assurance of a gracious acceptati∣on, than the pleasing remembrance of your fauourable eie formerly cast vp∣on some dawnings of my weake en∣deauoures. Faile I not herein, I haue arriued (next vnto the publike good) at the wish't Ports of my desires, which as they haue euer prized, so shall they continue restlesse in the pursuit of your Ladiships allowable esteemes, neuer to be sufficiently valued by
