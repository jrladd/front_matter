MOst deare, and most worthy to bee most deare, Mother, I remember a speech which diverse yeares a goe, fell from you, peradven∣ture then but casually: when looking upon a booke that was Dedicated by a Sonne to his Mother, you said, you did hope one day to see the like from mee. It may bee your
 words were then more a∣greeable to your desire then your expectation: yet you see them in some sort ful∣filled now. This only is the difference, that what he publi∣shed was penned by himselfe, but that which I present you with, is no otherwise mine, than it was yours before, being part of the fruit of the labours of my reverend Father you former husband: which being by you, with the rest of his pa¦pers, reserved for my use: is now at last come to my hand by the much lamented death of your late reverend Hus∣band Master Tho. Pierson
Two such Husbands and Fathers few women and their sonnes have. I should esteeme it not a little happinesse, if I
 might be a meanes to adde but alfe that credit to their me∣mories, that you did comfort o their lives. For the for∣mer, the penne-man of this ittle Treatise, to expatiate in his praises would bee neither seemely for mee who am his sonne, nor seasonable now when already he hath had his rest in peace these foure and thirtie yeares & upward, nor sutable to the proportion of so small a volume, unto which even this may seeme too large an en∣trance. For the Treatise it selfe, such as it is I received it from you, and returne it to you and thorough your hands commend it to the use of all them that desire to bee Chri∣stians, in an earnest, not in word and tongue only, but in
 deed and truth. So humbly craving what I know, I have your daily prayers for blessings upon me and mine, I rest though much unworthy, yet most desirous to be still,
