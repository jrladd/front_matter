SIR,
THis Sermon Preached before so Learned and Excellent a Judge, as all Just Men, (who have the Honour to know him) must own my Lord Chief Justice TREBY to be, I now Publish, as you very well know, Sir, at the Request of many Worthy Gentlemen, for whom I shall always preserve an unfeigned Esteem, as for many other Virtues, so particularly for their Generous Love to their Coun∣trey in Dangerous, Trying Times. I have no Apo∣logy to make for the Discourse it self, but that I
think it Loyal and Orthodox, and I am sure is well intended, which I hope will atone for the many Im∣perfections of it. I thought fittest upon that Publick Occasion, to press the Duty of Subjection and Obedi∣ence to Our Gracious King WILLIAM, which all the Clergy in Subscribing their Address to His Majesty Obliged themselves to do; and in that I only made more Publick, what upon many Particular Op∣portunities, I have according to my Poor Capacity endeavour'd to perswade People to, ever since His Majesty's Happy Accession to the Throne, which I have found by Experience some Persons have not been well pleas'd at. I know the Enemies to the Government will not like this Discourse, but I shall regard their Censures as little as they do their Duty, so long as I have the Approbation of Wiser and Bet∣ter Men, who are Friends to the Government, to which I here publickly Profess my self a Friend, and at the same time, Sir, with all due Respect and Gra∣titude for your many Favours,
