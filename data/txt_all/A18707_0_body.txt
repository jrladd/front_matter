THe continuall fauoure I haue found at your han∣des (right worshipfull) especially of late in Lon¦don, as well hy writing as by your personall trauel, doth charge my minde with so many gnawing co∣gitations, that I can neuer expresse a sufficient thankfulnes, nor render some token of a partepay, such is the hardnes of my happe and the straightnes of pre¦sent time, that nowe I can not match wishing with wyll, nor sufficiency with desire. How be it, I yeelde my selfe to your accustomed acceptation, and my hope which shalbe a pledge de attica fide, do I bequeath vnto future time. I holde you so firme my good freende, that notwithstanding the subtiltye of interceptors, you stand vngaged, to my no small comfort, wherefore seeing
 I haue no thankfull signification of good wyll, I present vnto your worship a portion of my profession, not as a suf∣ficient workmanship for your worthi∣nes, but as a token of my grateful mind It is  and therefore the vntimely hatching may bring foorth sickly Byrds. But I humbly beseech you worship that as you are already patrone of my poore liuing, so you will freendly allowe of the patronage of my selfe, & this my slender worke, and so I shall not onely be so much beholding to you as processe of time cannot weare away the remembrance, but euermore bound in harty prayers that the Lorde may prosper your affayres, and daily blesse your selfe and all yours to whose merci¦full tuition I commend you.
 From Zelwoode the 8. of September.
