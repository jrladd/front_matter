My LORD,
THE desire I have to do something as
may express that Respect I owe to your
Lordship, is the chief reason that I have un∣dertook
the Relation of the last Campaigne;
for since those Years which your Lordship has
so signally spent in the Service of the Crown,
and those important Governments you have

in this Kingdom, at this Juncture of time, do
not only dispence, but even oblige your Lord∣ship
not to be present with your Regiment in
the Low Countries; I hope this Relation may
be acceptable to your Lordship, in which your
Regiment has not had a small share, in the
most remarkable Occurrences of the Cam∣paigne.
There may be some Solaecisms in Soldiery
in this Relation; but I hope your Lordship
will be pleas'd to Pardon them, since they
proceed from a Clergy-man, who may be al∣low'd
such Mistakes, and who ventures upon
so Forreign an Undertaking to his Function,
(which ought to have been perform'd by abler
Pens, to express the Honour of English-men)
to assure your Lordship, that I am,
My LORD,
Your Lordship's most humble and
obedient Servant and Chaplain,
