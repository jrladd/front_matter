THE AUTHOR (as a publick and permanent Testimonial of his unfeigned affection to them, and real Gratitude for their Respect and Favour towards him) Humbly dedicates this ensuing Treatise (being the First-fruits of his Labours in this kind:)
Earnestly beseeching the God of all Grace, that he would grant them such a knowledge of this (in it self) incomprehensible Love of Christ, as may tend unto, and end in their being filled with all the fulness of God:
And that (through  urrence of his Spirit and Blessing) this  atise may be made som way useful and serviceable thereunto.
