HOnoured Lords, and esteem∣ed Gentlemen, I haue publi∣shed aswell the former Trea∣tise, as this addition of So∣ueraignetie, for your sakes, whom J am bound to informe by the dutie of my place, and in retribution of the respects you giue vnto me otherwayes: that since the sound of my voice cannot reach to the eares of euerie one, now it is grown low with yeares and infirmities; the Meditations of my

heart may neuerthelesse be offered to the eyes and iudgement, of all which J desire you to peruse and examine by the weights or standard of Truth, without preiudice or fore∣stalled opinion. (∴)(∴)
