MAruell not Madam that I haue made choice
Of you amongst all other Princely Dames,
Whose secret vertue challengeth each voice,
And my poore zeale beyond all ethers flames.
The first oblation of my morning Muse,
Lo here I offer at your sacred Shrine:
Which if you please but graciously peruse,
And sanctifie with those pure starres diuine,
Whose radiant rayes and bright reflecting flame,
May purifie the most impolisht rhime:
And bearing but the Liuery of your name,
Shall liue, despight the cankred iawes of time,
And flourish like the euerliuing Bay,
When monuments of Marble shall decay.
