THE humble seruice that in bounden dutie I doe
owe vnto your honourable house, with the true re∣port
that I haue often hearde of the noblenesse of
your owne spirit, as well in regard of the learned,
as fauour of the vertuous, hath made me presume
to aduenture the pardon of your discretion, in offering to your pa∣tience
a president of so simple a wit, as dauncing a Trenchmour in
the shadow of vnderstanding, dares not come into the light with∣out
the comfort of your good countenaunce: to make a large gate
to a little Towne, were but a mockerie to a trauailer, & no praise
to the builder: therefore referring to your good leysure the reading
of a mad discourse, and to the happines of your good fauour the cō∣mandement
of my better seruice, I take my leaue in all humblenes.
