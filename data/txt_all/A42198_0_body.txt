Good Madam,
THough your many former fa∣vours Merit an Acknowledg∣ment from me beyond what I am Capable any way to express; and though nothing more Usual than to take the Opportunity of Dedications, to Lnch out into Obsequious Encomi∣ums, and sometimes deserved Praises of Obliging great Persons, yet without

the Consideration of your gret averse∣ness to any thing that looks like t∣tery (if but the Modest and Just men∣tion os real worth,) I had this onely Design and ope, in utting this Trea∣tise into your Wardship and atronage (the Author being long since dead) That your Eminency in Degree, toge∣ther with your great Eminency in Piety and known Enmity to Vice, together with your true Countenancing os Ver∣tues, and Exemplary strictness, in Fa∣mily Order and Discipline might En∣courage many to the Reading of this most Useful and Seasonable Treatise; and so through the Grace of God may prove of great Advantage to them, who otherwise would scarce give a look through the Title-Page: If I am blame∣worthy in thus doing, it can be no re∣slection upon your Honour, since I have done it without consulting you, or ask∣ing your Consent.
I shall add no more but the Recog∣nition of my inward assectionae esteem

of your Ladyship, and fervent Pray∣ers for a Blessing from the great God and our Saviour, upon your Person and Right Honourable Off-spring, That you may grow in all Graces, together with that approved Faithsulness to God and Man which runs in your Veins; and is the Genius of the truly good Fa∣mily, (The Ancient Family of the Sricklands, of Boynton-House, where the Sobr and Learned Sir Thomas Strickland now Resieth, Nephew to your Ladyship, and Eldest Son to that Worthy Patriot Sir William Strick∣land, whose well known Piety and Prudence will Eternize his Memory;) I subscribe my self
(Good Madam)
