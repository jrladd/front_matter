MADAM,
APPLAUSE, That food of Scriblers, were it mine, wou'd not satisfie my Ambition; nor shou'd I know half the Transports I feel, at the Honour of approaching You. The sublimest fancy, when it paints a Herione; Copy's You but faintly: You have reach'd the bright Path of Virtue; and there You walk secure. It wouid be equally a pain for You to descend; as it is for the Vicious, to shake off their Mire, and Climb. I speak the Sentiments of the whole World; of all, who are dependant on Your Noble Family; of all, in whatsoever Station; who can boast the Happi∣ness to know my Lady Burlington.
The past, and the returning Years Connt not a Day, but what is blest, and Crown'd with some good

Action of Yours: This You wou'd hourly hear from every Joyful Tongue, did not the fear to Offend another Charming Grace (Your Modesty) deter them. That bashful Attendant is so Nice; it scarce dares Whisper to Your Self, how Good You are. I tremble least I shou'd now Offend; but who can quit this lovely Theam? Such Virtues shou'd for ever be the Poet's Song; the ablest Pens shou'd Tune Your Praise; for mean Conceptions Prophane such Worth: This ought to check my Aspiring; and force me silently to Admire, what I cannot Worthily express. Only herein I am embolden'd, that, as You have an In∣finity of Merit; so You have of Goodness. Under that sweet Umbrage I am safe; that gives me Hopes, You will pardon this Presumption; and permit me, with this Trifle, to offer my Constant Vows, for the Everlasting Prosperity of Your Ladyship; and that great Man, whom You Love most; who most Deserves to be Belov'd (Your Lord.) May You both be Blest in Your Illustrious Race; and long remain the Darlings of Your Friends, and Fate: Whilst I, at humble Distance, beg leave to Subscribe my Self,
Madam,
