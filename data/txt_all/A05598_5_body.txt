AS thou art first (great Lord) in thy great worth,
So thou dost liue a Loadstarre to this North:
Next to our Prince, in all supreme affaires,
Art chiefest Iudge, and greatest wrong repairs.
A second Solon, on the Arch of Fame,
Makes Equitie and Iustice seale thy name.
And art indued with Faculties diuine,
From whose sage Breast, true beames of Vertue shine.
Out of thy fauour, then true Noble Lord.
To this my Orphane Muse, one looke afford.


AND PRESIDENT, lest flattrie should bee deem'd,
I scarce may sing the height, Thou art esteem'd:
Euen from thy Birth, auspicuous Starres fore-tolde,
That mongst the Best, thy Name should bee enrolde.
The source of Vertue, who procures true peace.
A third Licurgus, in this well-rul'd Greece:
VVhom Learning doth endeare, and wisdome more,
That Atlas-like, supportes our Senate glore:
Then as thine honours, in thy merit shine,
Vouchsafe (graue Lord) to fauour this propine.


AND yee the rest, Sage SENATOURS, who swey
The course of Iustice, whome all doth obey.
VVhose wisest censures, vindicates vnright,
To you I bring this Mite, scarce worthie sight.
Yee doe the cause, the person not respect,
And simple Ones, from Proudlinges doe protect.


The VViddow findes her Right, the Orphane sort,
And VVeaklinges yee with Iustice doe comfort.
Yee with euen handes Astraeas Ballance holde,
Iudges of Right, and Lampes of Trueth enrolde,
Long may yee liue, and flourish in that Seate,
Patrones of Poore, and Pillars of the State:
That Iustice, Law, Religion, Loue, and Peace,
By your great meanes may in this Land encrease.
