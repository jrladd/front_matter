THe picture of pu∣ritie▪ and pat∣terne of Piety, (most Gracious and dread So∣urign Lord) holy Bernard by name deciphereth ot at large th grosse enormity of that vgly v In∣gratitude, saying: that it is Inimica

animae, exinanitio merorum, dis∣persiovirtutum, &c▪ An enemy to the Christians soule, an exile of merits, a ruine of vertues, and a consuming fire, that scorcheth vp the fountaine of all godlinesse. Lest therefore I should condemne my selfe of this sensuall sin, and challenged bee of grosse Ingrati∣tude; I haue presumed (crauing par∣don for my arrogant audacity herein) in token of my loyall duty to your sa∣cred Maiesty, to transport these lines Laconicall, and letters Impolite, to the happy hauen of your Princely heart, wishing to your Royall Grace, the sil∣uer of all earthly prosperitie, and the gold of all celestiall elicitie▪ If your Highness respect the matter; it is ce∣lestiall: f your Supremacy the man∣ner, it is to to terrestriall: Yet par∣don (most religious Prince) this my bold attempt, partly weighing the compulsion of ntire affection, and

partly considering the necessity of your simplest subiects erudition. Thus ceasing further troubling your Maie∣sties sacred ares, prosterning my selfe vpon the knees of submission, at your Highnesse foot-stoole, for pardon for my presumption herein; I begge without intermission, before the Throne of Grace, that it would please the Almighty to blesse, protect and de∣fend your Royall Maiesty, and all your Royall Issue, in this life present; and in the life to come, crowne you all with the Crowne of immort all Glory: and that for Iesus Christs sake our onely Lord, and euer-liuing Sauiour. AMEN, From Hempstead in Essex, this 16. of October. 1608.
