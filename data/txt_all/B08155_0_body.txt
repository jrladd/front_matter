As Ovid saith, Sword, fire, cannot deprive,
Age, Death or Time, can put him out of mind,
He was belov'd, and for his love I crave,
His Elegie may your acceptance have
You that are men of worth, I speake to you,
Not to the partial and prejudicate:
Nor to the ribble rabble sencelesse crue,
The Hydra monster inconsiderate,
Who scarce know P from G, or blacke from blew,
I neither doe respect, their love or hate,
For him deceas'd, and for your loves I pend it,
And to your good protections I commend it.
