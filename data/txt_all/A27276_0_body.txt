Honoured Sir,
I Am extreamly pleas'd with this Oppor∣tunity
of renewing that Acquaintance,
which I had the Honour and Happiness
to begin with you at the College (where you
laid the Foundation of that fine Gentleman
you since have prov'd, and where you gave
such early, and certain Promises of your fu∣ture
Merit) and at the same time of doing
Justice both to the Respect, and Honour I
have for you, Sir; and to the Value, and
Esteem I ever had for the Person and Me∣mory
of Mrs. Behn, by making you a Pre∣sent,
that has more than once already met
with a publick and general Applause; and
by securing these Admirable and Diverting
Histories from being prostituted to a Person
unworthy of the Honour: And were she alive,

she would be infinitely fond of my Choice;
in whom she would have found all the admi∣rable
Qualifications, that make up the Cha∣racter
of a noble Patron, and a generous
Friend, an HEREDITARY HONOƲR,
and a PERSONAL VIRTƲE; in whom
she wou'd have found an ancient Descent dig∣nified
with your own particular Honour,
Justice, Sweetness of Temper, Affability,
Generosity, and Sense; in whom she wou'd
have found such a Felicity of Address, as
makes your Discourse at once convince, and
charm; a sprightly Wit, and sound Judg∣ment,
which are eminent both in your Con∣versation
and Conduct, in the Choice and
Exercise of your Virtues: In whom she
wou'd have found Generosity without Pro∣fuseness;
a native Propensity to do good to
others, without injuring your Posterity; a
just Consideration of the Object of your Boun∣ty,
before you bestow a Benefit; and then
the Favour doubl'd by preventing the Expecta∣tion,
and saving the Person oblig'd the Con∣fusion
of asking; in whom she wou'd have
found Prudence without Cunning, the deli∣berate
Effect of a true Judgment; not the
hasty and mean Result of meer Interest and
Design. In whom therefore she wou'd have
made no doubt of finding the noble Souls and
Principles of Mecenas, Proculeus, Cotta,

Fabius, Lentulus, Gallus, or Messala; a
Soul exalted with a generous Ambition of no
vulgar Praise; for to be a Protector, and
Encourager of the Muses, is an uncommon
Glory; the Prerogative of but a few, Quos
aequus amavit Jupiter, and more Ages have
gone to the producing a Good Patron, than
a Good Poet.
Not but that Poetry in every Age, and
Nation has pleas'd, and found among the
rich and powerful, such as Juvenal describes
in his time,
—Didicit jam dives avarus
Tantum admirari, tantum laudare disertos
Ut pueri Junonis avem.—
who give an empty Admiration, and a bar∣ren
Praise, but want Magnificence of Soul
enough to reward, or preserve the Author of
their Pleasure. They have nothing to spare
from their Profuseness in their Trifles;
their Follies are too expensive to allow any
thing to Learning, Good Sense, and di∣vine
Poetry, which like Honesty, are only
prais'd and starve.
Non habet infoelix Numitor quod mittat amico,
Quintillae quod donet habet; nec defuit illi
Unde emeret multâ pascendum carne leonem
Jam domitum; constat leviori bellua sumptu
Nimirum, & capiunt plus intestina Poetae.

Sophocles might get the Government of
a Province for writing a good Play: Tyr∣taeus
the Command of an Army; but that
golden Age of Poetry is gone; and at this
distance, looks almost like that fabulous one
the Grecian Poets describ'd. For now (and
almost ever since) no Arts are encouraged,
that are not immediately employ'd in the Ser∣vice,
Ornament, or Pleasure of the Body,
and those that adorn the Mind thrown aside
as superfluous; and as useless as Ragou's
Shirt, which wou'd make one think, if (as
our spiritual Writers call it) the Body be but
the Garment or Habit of the Mind, that the
Minds of most Men are meer Beaux wholly
lost in their Dress, and insensible to all that
does not either discompose, or adjust that.
Hence 'tis evident, That whatever pre∣tence
the rest of the World have to complain
of the Times, the Poets only have a just
Cause to do it: For let the Times be never
so hard, all other Mysteries and Faculties
thrive, and meet with new Supplies: The
Sharper (as numerous as his Tribe is) still
finds fresh Bubbles; the Knight of the Post
fresh-bad Causes; Whores and Bawds fresh
Cullies; Brawny Fools fresh City-Wives,
or disappointed Quality; Taylors fresh
Fashions; Usurers fresh Spend-thrifts;
Lawyers fresh Clients; Courtiers fresh

Bribes, fresh Projects, and fresh Places;
Soldiers fresh Plunder; and Divines fresh
Livings; But the Poet scarce fresh Straw,
and now 'tis as of old,
—Utile multis
Pallere, & toto vinum nescire Decembri.
I might have made it Anno, but out of
Respect to the Verse. Poetry can get no
fresh Star to shine on it; no fresh Patron to
encourage it, that it might be fullfill'd, what
was long since written of it by Petronius
Arbiter—
Qui pelago credit, magno se foenere tollit;
Qui pugnas, & Castra petit praecingitur Auro;
Vilis Adulator picto jacet ebrius Ostro,
Et qui sollicitat nuptas ad praemia peccat:
Sola pruinosis horret facundia pannis
At{que} inopi lingua, defertas invocat Artes.
'Tis Encouragement that advances all Arts,
especially Poetry; which requires a free, un∣disturbed
and easie Life, void of all Cares
and Sollicitudes, which confound the noble
Idea's and Images that shou'd fill a Poet's
Mind. If Virgil had miss'd the Patronage
of the Prince of the Roman Empire, he had
never been the Prince of Poets.
Nam si Virgilio Puer, & tolerabile desit
Hospitium, caderent omnes à crinibus Hydri, &c.

An enlivening Bottle, a pleasing Conversa∣tion,
and an opportune Retreat of shady
Groves, Hills, Vales, and purling Streams,
are things that give fresh Vigour; to the
weary'd Pinions of a soaring Muse,
O! quis me gelidis in montibus Aemi
Sistet, & ingenti Ramorum protegat Umbra.
Poetry, the supream Pleasure of the mind,
is begot and born in Pleasure, but oppress'd,
and kill'd with Pain. So that this Re∣flection
ought to raise our Admiration of
Mrs. Behn, whose Genius was of that force
like Homer's, to maintain its Gayety in
the midst of Disappointments, which a
Woman of her Sense and Merit, ought never
to have met with: But she had a great
Strength of Mind, and Command of Thought,
being able to write in the midst of Com∣pany,
and yet have her share of the Con∣versation,
which I saw her do in writing
Oroonoko, and other parts of the following
Volume; in every part of which, Sir, you'll
find an easie Style, and a peculiar Happi∣ness
of thinking. The Passions, that of
Love especially, she was Mistress of, and
gave us such nice and tender Touches of
them, that without her Name we might
discover the Author, as Protogenes did
Apelles, by the Stroak of her Pencil.

In this Edition, Sir, are three Novels
not Printed before, and considerable Addi∣tions
to her Life; from all which, I'm per∣swaded
you will draw a very agreeable Enter∣tainment,
which I always wish you in your
Conversation with the Muses, for we often
seek the Company that pleases us, among
which, if I shall hereafter, by the Indulgence
of a better Fortune, be able to place any
thing worthy your Perusal; I shall enjoy a
very sensible Satisfaction for
Principibus placuisse viris non ultima laus est.
and I cou'd find no readier way to obtain so
agreeable an Event, than thus by putting my
self with so powerful a Bribe, as Mrs. Behn's
Histories under your Protection, Sir, where
the Malice of my Enemies, or the Malig∣nity
of my Misfortunes, will never be able to
give any uneasie, at least anxious Thoughts to,
SIR,
