May it please Your Lordship,
THE ensuing Sermons (Preached, in my ordinary turns, to the Vniversity,) were not intended to be more publick than that Auditory: But (being made acquainted that they would not be unacceptable to your Lordship;) I have presumed to Publish them under your Lordships Patronage. I have therein purposely waved (as I alwaies do) all nice disputes of Speculative Subtilties in Controversal Points (wherein those may possibly differ, who yet agree in the setled Doctrine of the Church of Eng∣land;) as more tending to disturb the peace of the Church, than to promote Piety. The design of them is, to shew the Necessity of Habitual Grace in our Hearts with the Prac∣tice of it in our Lives; and the need we have of God's Assistance to both. And I therein keep close to the Doc∣trine of our own Church (which I judge, in the whole, to be Sound and Orthodox,) and as near as may be, in her own Words. If any shall please themselves with thoughts of Doing good, without Being so; or, contrariwise, of a

good Heart, without a good Life; or, that he is of him∣self sufficient for One or Both of these (so as to please God) without the Divine Assistance: I am sure he is, therein, no true Son of the Church of England. Thus far, I hope we do all agree. And, being to speak to many of those, whose Function calls them to speak to others; I thought it seasonable to inculcate these Necessary Truths: Whereof they cannot be Ignorant, and of which I would not have them Vnmindfull, in their great Work of saving Souls. And I heartily wish there were more Zeal for these Great Truths, and less Animosities about little things, which un∣happily Divide good Men, Break our Peace, and Gratifie those who seek our Ruine. I am
My LORD,
