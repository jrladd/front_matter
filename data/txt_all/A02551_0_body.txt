I Might not but

in comparison of many acu∣rate
peeces of others, which
I see content themselues
dayly to dye in the eare.
Howsoeuer, if it may doe
good, I shall blesse your
Lordship for helping to
aduance my gaine.

true-heartednesse to your
God, your King, your

Hypocrite; whose very in∣scription
might cast a blurr
vpon some guilty reputati∣on.
Goe on still (most no∣ble

of vertue and fidelity
to an hollow and vntrusty
Age: You shall not want ei∣ther
the acclamations or
Prayers of
