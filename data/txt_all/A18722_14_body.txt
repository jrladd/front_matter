A Promise made to the good Ladie you Sister, who died in the Towre (good Madā) cōmands me to shape somwhat of good will & labour of pen, to present your La, withall, & for that I can not long liue in this world & must needs take leaue ther¦of sooner than I looke for. I haue found out an old farewell that maie breed some new consideration, and

such a running and rouing rime it is (I hope without of∣fence) as rather shall procure laughter than lowring, it is enterlarded with conceits, and mixed with familiar termes, shortlie knit vp, and without all curious circum∣stances▪ as briefe to the Reader, as vntedious to the wri∣ter, hauing passed the censure of the world thirtie yeares agoe, and is now put in print againe for a passing of the time, and a farewell to the world. So hoping your La▪ receiues it in good part, the matter beginneth I trust to your content and good likeing.
FINIS.
