Dread Soueraigne,
THe kinde welcome which these Raggualioes
of Boccalini lately found among the French
and in other Princes Courts, who suspect
the incroaching power of the House of Au∣stria,
hath moued me to collect and consecrate them in En∣glish
weeds vnto your Maiestie. The First was trans∣lated
by M. Florio, sometime Seruant to your Royall
Mother of blessed memory. The Second by one, vnto
whom the common-wealth cannot as yet be beholding for
his name; And the Third part by me, although farre infe∣riour
vnto either of them for any knowledge which I dare
arrogate to my selfe in the Italian Tongue, hauing dis∣continued
the vse thereof since my returne out of Italie,
being aboue 24. yeeres past, vntill this present time. Yet
neuerthelesse, when I had fully perused the noueltie of the
Authors straine, the pleasant conceits of the worke, enter∣laced
with some matters of consequence, which might
serue for caueats and annotations to such as stand inter∣essed
in State-affaires, I was encouraged to renew that
which I had so long neglected, and by compiling some of
the choisest Obseruations, to present them to your iudici∣ous
view. And because my chiefest cares for many yeeres

haue beene fixt vpon that most hopefull Plantation in the
Iland commonly called The New-found Land, I entitu∣led
this Worke The New-found Politicke, as well in re∣gard
of my affection deuoted to that place, as for the new∣nesse
of the stile and matter, wherein the Author poeti∣cally
discouers some Mysteries of Policie, which may
rowze vp the Spirits of the State of Venice, and other
Neighbouring Prouinces, to watch with Argus Eyes, lest
the deceitfull shew of Indian Gold, a fitter bait for
Turks and Moores, might produce any sudden Innoua∣tion
preiudiciall to the libertie of Christendome, which
ought to flourish in mutuall loue and charitie, and not to
liue in continuall iealousies to be surprized by any Prince
that acknowledgeth Christ for their vniuersall Head.
The King is wise as is the Angell of God, and con∣ceiues
more than it becomes a man of my ranke to insinu∣ate
to so high a Maiestie concerning the Affaires of long∣handed
Princes, whom Experience, and not the admoni∣tion
of a contemplatiue Scholar, hath taught to remember
that Verse of the Poet:
Tunc tua res agitur paries cùm proximus ardet:
When the next wall vnto your house doth burne,
Looke to your selfe betimes; next is your turne.
The King of Kings long preserue your Maiestie in all
Earthly happinesse, to his glory, our comfort, and the de∣fence
of the true Christian Faith. So praieth from the
bottome of his heart
