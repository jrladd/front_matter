MADAM,
THose many and great Ob∣ligations, wherein I stand ingaged to your Ladiship, for those many Favours, and Re∣spects, vouchsafed to me, since the happiness of my first ac∣quaintance with you, have made me very studious, of taking all occasions, whereby I might testi∣fie my sensibleness thereof; and well knowing, there was no∣thing, in which I could do it
 more acceptably, than in the tender of that, which might any wayes contribute to your Ladiships spiritual advantage, I have made bold, to adventure to make tenders of this (what it is) to your Ladiship. Truly Madam, I know not to give flat∣tering titles to any, in so doing, my Maker would soon take me away: But this I must needs acknow∣ledge, to Gods glory, and your Ladiships own encouragement, yea, and for the happy imitation of others of your Ladiships Rank, that my self, and all that know you, have much cause to bless God upon every remem∣brance of you, when we consi∣der your exemplary piety, ador∣ned with such remarkable hu∣mility; Magna & rara virtus est, ut mag∣na licet operantem, magnum te nescias, & manifestam omnibus, tuam, tibi, so∣lum latere Sanctitatem. Mirabilem te apparere, & contemp∣tibilem te reputare, hoc ego ipsis virtutibus mirabilius judico. Bernard▪ your so singular pretiousness
 of spirit, and yet being withall so poor in spirit; your steeliness as to the truth, and yet tenderness both to, and for sin; your great care, and unwea∣ried pains to promote Religion in your Family, yea, and in the place where you live, having a heart to bewail, what accor∣ding to your Ladiships earnest desire you cannot see reclaimed, and to mourn for what to your Ladiships great grief you cannot see amended; your countenan∣cing, and so much encouraging God's so much despised Mini∣stry, in these last & worst daies; God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and labour of love, which herein you have shewed, and made manifest towards his name. Blessed be God for your love of, firm stedfastness to, and zeal for his truth, & against what∣ever
 is opposite thereunto, in these times wherein so many have left their first love, and are fallen from their stedfastness, being like Children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine: But blessed be God, who hath kept you firm; the Lord confirm and establish you still unto the end. Madam, I have the rather Dedicated what here followes unto your Ladiship, because it is that which indeed does so much, and so many wayes, make for your Ladiships comfort, and encouragement: for if the Scrip∣ture cannot be broken (as indeed it cannot) then your Ladiship hath chosen that good part, that shall not be taken away, having chosen that part of which the Scripture so affirms; And if the Scripture cannot be broken, then your
 Ladiship is indeed blessed, being among those, whom the Scrip∣ture pronounceth blessed; then doth your Ladiship lean on a firm and strong prop, having made that word which cannot be broken your stay; then what infinite cause hath your Ladi∣ship to bless God, that through grace, you should have hopes, upon good grounds, of entrance into the Kingdom of heaven, the Scripture that cannot be broken affirming, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of heaven; and the Scripture elsewhere, thus speaking, you see your calling brethren, how that not many noble are called, 1 Cor. 1. 26. And hath not God chosen the poor of this world, Rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom? James 2. 5. the poor of this world.
And yet that your Ladiship
 should enter into the Kingdom of heaven, when such of your Ladiships Rank, do so hardly enter, hardlier than others, as the Scripture which can∣not be broken, doth affirm, such having greater tempta∣tions, and hinderances than others Plenitudo & abun∣dantia temporalium, oblivionem, & inopi∣am facit aeternorum.
Bernard., though grea∣ter Obligations to God, and that though not many noble are called, yet that your Ladiship should make one; That though orta è mag∣nis▪ yet na è pau∣cis. and that though the poor of this world are such, as God usu∣ally, and for the most part hath chosen rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom, yet that the Lord should choose you though rich in the world, to be rich in Faith too, and an Heir of the Kingdom; and that, that happy conjunction, wch is so desirable,
 but so exceeding rare, should yet unite in your Ladiship, that grace, and place, should meet together; and godliness, and greatness, should kiss each o∣ther: Truly this Madam, is the Lords wonderful, and gratious doing, and should be marvel∣lous in your eyes, it should be matter of praise, and admirati∣on, continually here; and it will be so to all eternity here∣after, and all little enough. In a word, if the Scripture cannot be broken, O what a River of con∣solation doth hence then flow to your Ladiship, the streams whereof, I hope shall much make glad your heart! But I shall not longer at present detein your Ladiship, but humbly refer you to that which followes, which that it may contribute to your Ladiships comfort, and spiri∣tual
 benefit, as also to the be∣nefit of others, yea of all who shall read it, is, and shall be the Prayer of him, who is
MADAM,
