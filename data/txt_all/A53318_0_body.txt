SIR,
I Wou'd fain say some∣thing new to you in this Dedication; but our Great Masters in Wit, have already so far out∣done me, that I must de∣spair

of Entertaining you as I wou'd. To say I do not pretend to make you any acknowledgements here, of the Favours I have already receiv'd; because it looks as if I design'd to pay a Debt, by borrowing a much greater Sum of the same Person; is Old, tho' 'tis True. And for me to attempt here to give the World a Character of You, wou'd extream∣ly

lessen you; and you wou'd appear like a Great Beauty drawn by a House-daw∣ber: And that part of Mankind, which has the happiness to be truly acquainted with you, wou'd throw stones at me for my Ignorance, and Pre∣sumption. Some of that happy number who have needed it, have sufficient∣ly known your Generosity, nor have I wanted my share of that Knowledge.
Your Sense and Judge∣ment have been too Evi∣dent to be question'd by any Man that pretends to either: And they are such as I ought to dread upon this Occasion. You have adorn'd the Best, and Highest Chara∣cters, and have some∣times help'd Heaven to make a Poet.
I shall say nothing in

defence of the Discourse I'm going to make you; because it wants more than I can pretend to offer for it. Only thus much, that it was really design'd to please YOU, and all that read it; as well as to oblige the Book∣seller, and my self.
In short, I fear Sir, you'll find your Enter∣tainment but Rude, and Homely; But I

hope, not Ill-natur'd, nor Uncivil. You have your Bill of Fare in the Title Page, and if I have dress'd any one Dish to your Palate, I wish you may make a Hearty, but not a Nauseous meal of it; and then I'm sure I shall be the most satis∣fy'd. You are my Chief Guest, Sir, and for your sake, Mr. Briscoe and I are in hopes, that we shall have the Greater

and Better Compa∣ny. Who, if they bring as much Candour, as I beg you now to be guilty of; with you, will par∣don, Sir,
