I Know, that Malice will impute to me
The guilt of Flatt'ry in a high degree:
Yet, with a conscience blameless of that sin,
Thus, in despight of Envie, I begin:


LORD, of the noblest of all Soveraign Stiles,
Of BRITAN's Empire, Provinces, and Isles:
Bright Load-star of the North; who (for Director
As well, through future times, as for PROTECTOR
Of us who now survive) hast raised bin
By Providence, that Great Work to begin,
Which hath been long in hope; and which, hence forth
Shall spread such Influences from the North
Throughout the earth, as will their souls amaze,
Who, on thy late Ascention, stand at gaze:
Descend a little, and cast down thine eyes
On this, which at thy feet displayed lyes;

And, let thy great Humility, dispence
With what, may seem in me a Confidence
Above my Sphere: for, to the highest things,
The lowest, otherwhiles, additions brings,
If not obstructed by those dire Aspects,
Which menace, now, malevolent Effects.


Some days, before that PARLIAMENT was past,
Which, may, yet, called be, your first, and last;
This Poeme, (and the Lines which next ensue,
To usher it) was fitted for your view,
And, their perusal; who, might then have bin
(As I supposed) much concern'd therein.
But, somewhat intervening, which did seem
To make it out of season, at that time,
It was six months delay'd, to wait upon
That subsequence which would ensue thereon;
And, now, a better Oportunity
Appearing, This, in all humility,
Moves toward you again, in ev'ry thing
The same it was, except this prefacing,
Which here concludes. Let the Contents be weigh'd,
As they deserve: for, this, was that I said.




I Finde among the best Antiquities,
That, they who rul'd the worlds chief Monarchies
Gave those, whom they most favor'd, some New name:
And, GOD himself, hath sometime done the same
To his choice Favourites, when he begun
Great Changes, and when signal acts were done,
In order to a seas'nable proceed,
With what, had been eternally decreed.
Now, in like maner, for the same intent,
He, by a New name, makes thee eminent,

Above all other Princes, to bring on
That Kingdom, which he promis'd long agon.
And, to that end, YOU, (of whom no man thought
In that way) from Obscurity are brought,
To shew the world, That, he, ev'n to this day,
Proceeds, with his own works, in his own way;
Neither, her Pow'rs, in his Designments needing,
Nor those great Persons, or that means, much heedâˆ£ing
Which humane prudence, thinks, conducing to
That, which eternal Wisdom means to do.


And, he, perhaps, hath call'd me, from among
The Vulgar, and most despicable Throng,
To help rough-hew their hearts, who by dissentions,
Are Foes to their own Peace, and his intentions:
As also, to illustrate so to you,
And, unto them, the Name conferred now;
That, by observing it, both You, and They
(Before it be too late) consider may
How You, and They, are thereby priviledg'd;
Whereto, you, joyntly, seem to be oblig'd;
Whereto, apart; what, will succeed upon
That, which shall well, or wickedly be done:
And, that the time is come, or neer at hand,
Which offers us, the means, to fall or stand.


At least, I do believe, that I was born
To act this Part; and will, till I return
To him that sent me; leaving the success
To Providence, which gets advantages
By disadvantage; and, oft, makes our gains
Then greatest, when most think, we lose our pains.


I was about to tell you, what I hear;
What, some suspect; what, many seem to fear;
And, what most men repine at: But, your Sun
Wants not my Candle, nor needs this be done:

For, you have ev'rywhere, both Ears, and Eyes,
To finde where Danger, or Advantage lyes;
And, I can bring you, but a Gloworms light,
Which rarely shines, except to them, whose Night
Affliction darkens: And, it seems, ev'n then,
An Ignis Fatuus, to some Prudent men.


Till therefore, I shall finde my self more able,
In your Concernments to be serviceable,
I will in humble silence, wait upon
What shall, by GOD, by You, and Those, be done
Who represent these Nations; and, who be
Objects of Contemplation now, to me,
Whereby, I Calculate what may succeed,
When, joyn'd together, I your Actings read:
For, Truths, to me, your Trine-aspect more clears,
Then all the Constellations of the Sphears:
Yea, those Three shew me, what things will be done,
Better, then all the Stars, the Moon, and Sun.


There are some Clouds which trouble so my sight,
That I discern not things, which else I might:
But this I plainly view, that, much is left
Unto Contingencis, to be berest,
Or else enjoy'd, according as you prove
Who, in the two Inferiour Orbs, do move:
And, if I know you, or, by what proceeds
Either from Circumstances, Words, or Deeds,
May know, what you unfeignedly desire,
(And whereunto you chiefly do aspire)
You aim at nothing more, then, to possess
A Throne established by Righteousness:
And that those Hesitations, and that Doubt,
In which you let these Nations ravel out
So many Months, is, neither ill Designe,
Nor Evidence, that you from them decline:

But, an Expedient, which, your wisdom tries
To work by, in your late Emergencies.


Unless, I be deceiv'd (which, God forbid)
In what you do, and what you lately did,
You, take no pleasure in delays, or troubles,
Which needlesly, their cost or labour doubles;
But, onely, leave it to themselves, to state
Their Questions, and, their heats to moderate,
By their own Prudence, (without interposing
Your judgement, or their purposes opposing)
That, by a free debate, they fully may
Know their own temper; and, you finde the way
To such Resolvings, as may best assure
A settlement of Peace, which will endure;
And, that, when you, by their Contests have found
Which Members rotten be, and which are sound;
Who gives good counsel, who bad things infuses;
Who speaks his Conscience, who his Trust abuses;
Who strives to build up Truth, who pulls it down;
Who neither stoops to smiles, nor fears a frown:
Who merits to be stripped of his power,
Who seeks his own ends, by pretending your;
Who flatters, who is fickle, who is stout;
Who fittest for the Work you are about;
With other such discov'ries, that, from thence
You may extract Results of Consequence
For Common benefit: I do presume
You will, at last, to that Conclusion come,
Which all Good-men expect: and, act, what best
Conduceth to the Publike Interest,
Much better, then you either could have done,
By interrupting, what seem'd carried on;
Or, by possessing them with hopes, to have
Whatever, they should pleased be, to crave:

For, Full-fed Steeds grow wanton, if their Guiders
Neglect the Rein; and, spoil themselves, and Riders.


These are the thoughts, to which my heart inclines,
Without a dictate of your own Designes
From any hand: which thoughts, if you approve,
I have, at this time, nothing more to move,
But, that you will be pleased to peruse
What of your Sov'raign Title now ensues;
That, it may minde you of his love who gave it;
Shew, on what terms, to what intent you have it;
And keep you careful, that it be not changed;
Lest, somewhat, from you, therewith be estranged,
Which you are loth to lose, and, must forgo,
When you grow disaffected thereunto:
For, you will finde it so, when 't is too late
To seek th' effects, which may be aimed at,
By such an Innovation; and, will see
Ill Consequences, which, yet hidden be,
If (as I think you are not) I should finde
Your Highness, to be mutably inclinde.


I aim at nothing, but to make you strong
For that Work, whereto seemeth to belong
This, your advancement; and shall not desist
Therein, although my private Interest
You should neglect; or, value me no more
Then they, who have opprest me heretofore.


Believe this, SIR: for, from a heart it came,
Which prompts no guile: and, be assur'd, I am
(As unto him, who bears next under GOD
Our Staff Protecting, or Correcting ROD)
