May it please Your Royal Highness,
IT is confessed with all Humility, That the unworthy Authors bold∣ness in tendering this Book to kiss Your Princely Hands, is in it self sufficiently Criminal, to merit your Non-acceptance and Rejection; which will ap∣pear much more, when it is acknowledged to be the same that when it first obtain'd its Imprimatur, in the year, 1655. In order thereunto, was forced by the Formality of a Prefatory Epistle, to own that Ty∣rannous Usurping Power, which with the terror
of a successful Sword, ore-aw'd these then unhappy Nations into a seeming Compliance and Subjecti∣on. This, as it doth expose the Book and Author to your Highness just displeasure; so might it dis∣courage both from this Address, which carries with it such an appearance of Presumption. But Great Sir, That Clemency and Goodness which is so pro∣per and natural to the Royal Family (which in the gracious offers of his Sacred Majesty, the whol Kingdom hath so happily experienced, and with such Joy and Thankfulness in Parliament hath been acknowledged) forbids your Supplyants despair of Pardon from your Royal Highness of that Fault which Fear and Force, and the Necessities of the Times involved him in against his Inclinations and Affections to that ancient flourishing Monarchy, under which in the Reign of your Royal Father of Glorious Memory, he had in the Service of the Na∣vy, for above twenty yeers together, been honor'd with Imployment; and gives him encouragement humbly to beg your Highness leave, that this smal Tract, designed for the benefit and service of the Royal Navy, now so happily under your Com∣mand, being by this new Dedication made fit for Publick Use and View, may be permitted to see the Light with freedom, from which it hath been kept this five years since it was printed, all the Copies still remaining in the Authors hands, who hath not yet disposed of twenty of them to this blessed Day: wherein as he rejoyceth in common with all good Subjects for his Sacred Majesties so Peaceable Restoration to his undoubted Rights (in preserva∣tion
whereof, according to the known and ancient Laws, they now are sensible how much all that is dear unto them is interessed and concerned) so it is particularly a joy unto him, that still by Providence this opportunity is preserved of making Publick, to∣gether with these his Labors, the just expectations of all considering sober persons, That as the Ar∣mies both of France and Spain have not long since experienced the Influence of the incomparable Va∣lor and skilful Conduct of so great a Captain as your Royal Highness, according as their dealing with you gave you just cause on either side, for to imploy them: So that now the Navy Royal of this Island, Commanded by You, will be not only (as of old) the Walls of this Renowned Empire; but an awe and terror to all the Enemies of the Eng∣lish Name and Glory. These, Great Prince, as they are the hopes, so likewise they are the subject of the hearty Vows and Prayers of

June 21. 1660.
