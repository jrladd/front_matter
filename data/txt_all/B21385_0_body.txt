My Lord,
I CANNOT easily excuse the printing of a PLAY at so unseasonable a time, when the Great Plot of the Nation, like one of Pharaoh's lean Kine, has devour'd its younger Brethren of the Stage: But however weak my defence might be for this, I am sure I shou'd not need any to the World, for my Dedication to your Lordship; and if you can pardon my presumption in it, that a bad Poet should address himself to so great a Judge of Wit, I may hope at least to scape with the Excuse of Catul∣lus, when he writ to Cicero:
Gratias tibi Maximas Catullus
Agit, pessimus omnium Poeta;
Tanto pessimus omnium Poeta,
Quanto tu optimus omnium Patronus.
I have seen an Epistle of Fleckno's to a Noble-man, who was by some extraordinary chance a Scholar; (and you may please to take notice by the way, how natural the connection of thought is betwixt a bad Poet and Fleckno) where he begins thus: Qua∣tuordecim jam elapsi sunt anni, &c. his Latin, it seems, not holding out to the end of the Sentence; but he endeavour'd to tell his Patron, betwixt two
Languages which he understood alike, that it was 14 years since he had the happiness to know him; 'tis just so long, and as happy be the Omen of dulness to me, as it is to some Clergy-men and States-men, since your Lordship has known that there is a worse Poet remaining in the world than he of scandalous memory who left it last. I might inlarge upon the subject with my Author, and assure you, that I have serv'd as long for you, as one of the Patriarchs did for his Old Testament Mistress: But I leave those flourishes, when occasion shall serve, for a greater O∣rator to use, and dare only tell you, that I never pass'd any part of my life with greater satisfaction or improvement to my self, than those Years which I have liv'd in the honour of your Lordships Acquain∣tance. If I may have only the time abated when the Publick Service call'd you to another part of the World, which in imitation of our Florid Speakers, I might, (if I durst-presume upon the expression) call the Parenthesis of my Life.
That I have always honour'd you, I suppose I need not tell you at this time of day; for you know I staid not to date my respects to you from that Title which now you have, and to which you bring a greater addi∣tion by your Merit, than you receive from it by the Name; but I am proud to let others know how long it is that I have been made happy by my knowledge of you, because I am sure it will give me a Reputati∣on with the present Age, and with Posterity. And now, my Lord, I know you are afraid, lest I should take this occasion, which lies so fair for me, to ac∣quaint
the World with some of those Excellencies which I have admir'd in you; but I have reasonably consider'd, that to acquaint the World, is a Phrase of a malicious meaning: for it would imply, that the World were not already acquainted with them. You are so generally known to be above the meanness of my praises, that you have spar'd my Evidence, and spoil'd my Comple∣ment: should I take for my common places, your know∣ledge both of the old and the new Philosophy, should I add to these your skill in Mathematicks, and History, and yet farther, your being conversant with all the Ancient Au∣thors of the Greek and Latine Tongues, as well as with the Modern, I should tell nothing new to Mankind; for when I have once but nam'd you, the World will antici∣pate all my Commendations, and go faster before me than I can follow. Be therefore secure, my Lord, that your own Fame has freed it self from the danger of a Panegy∣rique, and only give me leave to tell you, that I value the Candour of your Nature, and that one Character of Friendliness, and if I may have leave to call it, kindness in you, before all those other whick make you consider∣able in the Nation.
Some few of our Nobility are learned, and therefore I will not conclude an absolute contradiction in the terms of Noble man and Scholar; but as the World goes now, 'tis very hard to predicate one upon the other; and 'tis yet more difficult to prove, that a Noble-man can be a Friend to Poetry: Were it not for two or three in∣stances in WHITE-HALL, and in the Town, the Poets of this Age would find so little incou∣ragement
for their labours, and so few Understanders, that they might have leisure to turn Pamphleteers, and aug∣ment the number of those abominable Scriblers, who in this time of License abuse the Press, almost every day, with Nonsense, and railing against the Government.
It remains, my Lord, that I should give you some ac∣count of this Comedy, which you have never seen, be∣cause it was written and acted in your absence, at your Government of Jamaica. 'Twas intended for an honest Satyre against our crying sin of Keeping; how it would have succeeded, I can but guess, for it was permitted to be acted only thrice. The Crime for which it suffer'd, was that which is objected against the Satyres of Juvenal, and the Epigrams of Catullus, that it exprese'd too much of the Vice which it decry'd: Your Lordship knows what Answer was return'd by the Elder of those Poets, whom I last mention'd, to his Accusers.
Castum esse decet pium Poetam
Ipsum. Versiculos nihil necesse est:
Qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem
Si sint molliculi & parum pudici.
But I dare not make that Apology for my self, and there∣fore have taken a becoming care, that those things which offended on the Stage, might be either alter'd, or omitted in the Press: For their Authority is, and shall be ever sacred to me, as much absent as present, and in all altera∣tions of their Fortune, who for those Reasons have stopp'd its farther appearance on the Theatre. And whatsoever hinderance it has been to me, in point of profit, many of my Friends can bear me witness, that I have not once murmur'd against that Decree. The same Fortune once
happen'd to Moliere, on the occasion of his Tartuffe; which notwithstanding afterwards has seen the light, in a Country more Bigot than ours, and is accounted a∣mongst the best Pieces of that Poet. I will be bold e∣nough to say, that this Comedy is of the first Rank of those which I have written, and that Posterity will be of my Opinion. It has nothing of particular Satyre in it: for whatsoever may have been pretended by some Criticks in the Town, I may safely and solemnly affirm, that no one Character has been drawn from any single man; and that I have known so many of the same humour, in every folly which is here expos'd, as may serve to warrant it from a particular Reflection. It was printed in my ab∣sence from the Town, this Summer, much against my ex∣pectation, otherwise I had over-look'd the Press, and been yet more careful, that neither my Friends should have had the least occasion of unkindness against me, nor my Enemies of upbraiding me; but if it live to a se∣cond Impression, I will faithfully perform what has been wanting in this. In the mean time, my Lord, I recom∣mend it to your Protection, and beg I may keep still that place in your favour which I have hitherto enjoy'd; and which I shall reckon as one of the greatest Blessings which can befall,
My Lord,
