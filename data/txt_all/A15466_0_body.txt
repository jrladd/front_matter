MOst honorable Lord, ha∣uing
busied my self more
than two yeares in wri∣ting
sundrie actions that
passed in our daies, espe∣ciallie
the great actions
of the Netherlanders since the first arriuall
of Duke D' alua, vntill the late sieges of
Sluce and Bergis, hauing resolued to print
and dedicate them vnto your Lordship: di∣uers
occasions perswades me to craue par∣don
for a time; assuring your Lordship, if
health and libertie permits leaue, to pre∣sent

them vnto your selfe in the French
tongue: hoping by those meanes to bee
rightlier iudged, than I haue been hether∣vnto.
In troth, but for the negligence of a
seruant that lost part of my discourses, I
would not haue printed any thing without
the whole; wherefore I haue taken boldnes
to present your Lordship with some of my
lost papers, humblie desiring you to accept
them, as from a Souldier that hath but smal
skill in writing or inditing; but could I doo
better, assuredlie it should bee vnto your
selfe, and shall bee in any thing I can per∣forme.
Beare with my faults, be assured of
my loue, and command my life, next vn∣to
my sacred Soueraigne & deare Coun∣trie.
