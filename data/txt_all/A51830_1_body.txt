SIR,
GIVE me leave to repeat the first Answer I re∣turned to that Obliging Complement, where∣with you softned the Command laid upon me to make this Sermon Publick; which was, that hither∣to it was mine, and I alone was accountable for all its Imperfections; but if it came forth under the Autho∣rity of your Name, it would become yours, and you would be ingaged in its Protection.
Be pleased therefore Sir to receive what is yours into your Patronage: And I hope the World will do me the Justice to allow, that howsoever I may have failed in any other part of my performance, yet I have given a very bold proof of my Obedience.
But Sir, That discreetly managed Zeal which you express for true Practical Piety, together with that great Temper and exceeding Sweetness of Nature which appears in the severest Exercise of your Authority, asthey have in general procured you the Affections of your whole Clergy; so they have particularly ingaged me to pay this Testimony of my respect to your Place, and Personal Merit.
And if this poor Discourse prove but as successful in contributing to the advancement of Religion in the World, as it hath been in the kind acceptance of my Reverend Brethren of the Clergy: I have all that could be wished, and more than could reasonably have been hoped for, by
Reverend Sir,
 Old Stratford,
Octob. 22. 1694.
