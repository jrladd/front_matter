RIght Reuerend and Honourable:
I Know there is store of Sermons extant: The Pulpit scarce affordeth more then the Presse. J adde to the number, and complaine not: in all good things abun∣dance is an easie burden. If the soule may feed it selfe with variety, both by the eare, and by the eye, it hath no reason to find fault with choice. But if any wea∣ker stomacke (as in our bodily Tables) shall feare to surfet at the fight of too much, it is easie for that man to looke off, and to confine his eyes to some few: Who cannot much sooner abate to himselfe, then multiply to another? Let not his nice fullennesse preiudice that delight and profit which may arise to others from this number. For me, J dare not be so enuious, as not to blesse God for this plenty, and seriously to reioyce that Gods people may
 thus liberally feast themselues by both their senses: neither know J for whether more: The sound of the word spoken pierceth more; the letter written endureth longer: the eare is taught more sudden∣ly, more stirringly; the eie with leisure and continuance.
