May it please your Maiestie:
IN as much as it is the com∣mon
opinion, as well of your
owne Subiects at home, as of
Strangers abroad, that the Ie∣suites
were the workers of that
damnable Parricide, which
striking to the heart of our de∣ceased
King (whom God absolue) hath stricken to the
very throate of Fraunce it selfe: and thereupon the
Iesuites complaine that they are wrongfully dealt
withall, and that these reports are spread by their ene∣mies,
thereby to make them odious to the world: I
thought it necessarie to make appeare to your Maie∣stie
the originall causes of this aspersion cast vpon
them, to the end that if it be found to spring from
sure and vndoubted grounds, your Maiestie may from
thence coniecture, whether it may stand with the

safeguard of the present King, your Sonnes life, to
suffer these holy Fathers to approach neere his per∣son:
as also whether it may be done without holding
your Subiects in continuall alarmes, and deiances
one of another. For if it were forbidden by Moses Law
(as Father Cotton hath obserued, in his Epistle Dedi∣catorie,)
to seeth the Kid in the milke of the Damme;
much more vnlawfull must it needs be, to deliuer the
Sonne into hands already imbrewed in the bloud of
the Father. I desire not to be beleeued without eui∣dent
proofes, and professe withall, that I am no way
transported with passion against their persons, nor
would at all bee drawne to speake or write against
them, if after the maner of other Monkes and Fryers,
they would be content to bound themselues within
the lists of instructing the people, and managing the
affaires of the Church: but that which I now speake,
is not the suggestion of Heretiques, but the testimo∣nie
of your highest Courts of Iustice, the consent of
the greatest part of your Clergie, and among them,
euen of the sacred facultie of Diuinitie, and in a word,
the common vniuersall out-crie of all your people:
all which, notwithstanding, would willingly haue
learned the Arte of forgetfulnesse with Father Au∣bigny,
and beene content to mourne without spea∣king
a word, were it not that wee see the murthering
of Princes become a custome, and that if your Ma∣iestie
put not to your hand to stop it betimes, Trea∣son
will shortly stand in the rancke of Christian ver∣tues,
and be helde the fairest and shortest way to
heauen.
If then your Maiestie please for a while to lay aside
your important affaires of State, and to peruse this
ensuing discourse, you shall finde, I doubt not, in
this case the voyce of the people, the voyce of God:
whom I beseech to make the Flower de Lice to flow∣rish
vpon your Sonnes head, and to poure downe vp∣on
your Maiestie, all possible happinesse.
