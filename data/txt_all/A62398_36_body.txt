I Thought four and twenty Shepherds Swain,
In my Dream I did see,
VVhereof I have dedicated one of them to thee;
Iohn Grieve of Garwald a right honest one,

Which relieves the poor, and proves a Christian Man;
And with his small substance he is well content,
Though in late times he prov'd a Puritant.
I wish his Fleeces be no worse,
Than Iasons Fleeces was in Greece.
