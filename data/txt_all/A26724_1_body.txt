Right Honorable!
YOu do very well know, that no Opinion is more unscri∣ptural or irrational, then to denie the Dutie it self of Singing Psalms, and Spiritual Songs of Prais to the glorie of God;

sor even Nature dictateth no less to the verie Heathens; and the Scri∣pture is so express and urgent for it, that as well wee may denie prai∣er, as this kinde of Prais: Neither can the mistake of manie disswade the pious practiser of this Dutie to desist, but rather provoke his zeal, like David dancing before the Ark; blinde Bartimeus, crying after Christ; or the Children, crying Hosanna; and Verily, if such should altogether hold their peace, the Stones would sing.
I acknowledg that most of the Psalms exstant do want a more ex∣quisite Composure; and I denie not but Christians, gifted that waie, may compose and sing new Songs to the glorie of God, in the Con∣gregations; but if those Songs bee not composed out of Scripture, I believ they will want that gravitie and weight, that Majestie and Au∣toritie, which these have to excite

affection, and edifie the understand∣ing. Wherefore, having Compo∣sed a few of this kinde, very proper for the Seasons and Solemnities GOD's gracious Providence be∣stow's upon us, I humbly crave leav (▪most Noble LORD!) to present these, and especially the Souldiers Hymn, to Your Lordship's pious and prudent Animadversion, hoping to obtein Your Honor's Ap∣probation of this Scriptural Colle∣ction, as a livelie Description of the Condition You have so much expe∣rienced; And that You will saie, and manie after You, That this Scripture is (at this Daie) fulfilled in our ears, and in Your persons.
GOD Almightie preserv Your EXCELLENCIE to bee an Happie Instrument of Our full Deliverance, and the strong Esta∣blishment

of Englands Common∣wealth, together with the Flourish∣ing Estate of the whole Church of Christ, as praieth▪
