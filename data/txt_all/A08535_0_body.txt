Right Honourable, &c.
IT may be esteemed folly in me, if I should ouer-boldly presse into your Honors studies with a few lowly Inuocations, or the safe Rule to Coelestiall Repentance, which is the onely scope of this small Treatise, if I had not some likelihood of your fauourable and wor∣thy acceptance; two reasons inciting me here∣vnto; First, for that it is compacted and fast∣ned together by the Author, who before he knew the world, yea, before, was depriued by death of a great Losse, being made fatherles, of such a Father whose power was eminent in the Ciuill Lawes and Courts of Chancerie:
before his child-birth, by the which losse, who knoweth not the miseries that such occasions inuite miserable people vnto: The Prophet Dauid herein is a perfit forme for such as true∣ly repent, in the 37. Psalme, the 25. verse, say∣ing, J haue beene young and now am old: and yet saw I neuer the righteous forsaken, nor his seed beg∣ging their bread: The other reason, is, because whosoeuer he be, that doth truery read it, first, the efficacie and pith of the words; secondly, he paines of the poore Author, in digesting and framing the same; thirdly, the profit and benefit of them whose zeale thirst after eternal felicitie. And thus desiring your friendly acceptance, of my poore endeuors, I humbly, and in all bounden dutie rest;
