Honoured Sir,
IF a Heathen Poet could say, Non
omnis moriar, I shall live though I
die; supposing his Works im∣mortall,
though himselfe were mortall;
Upon how much better an account
may a Prophet of the Lord say, Non
moriar, sed vivam, I shall not die, but
live; both in respect of his immortall

soule, to which death is as the gate of
life; and in respect of the immortall
travell of his soule, being conversant in
the Word of the Lord that abideth
for ever.
The workes of the Saints of God
in whom is the spirit of prophecie, not
onely live when they are dead; but are
instrumentall in the hand of grace, both
to plant life where it is not, and water
it where it is, that it may spring forth
more abundantly.
The chosen Vessell of the Lord, by
whose Ministry he was pleased to give
out the Heavenly treasures laid up
in these Sermons, hath some yeares
since put off his earth, and put on
that Inheritance of the Saints in light,
for which the Lord seemed earlie to
have fitted him, by his earnest and

assiduous Travail in sitting others.
But though the Vessell be broken, or
rather indeed refined and translated to
his masters more immediate use, yet
the Treasures abide for the common
enrichment of the Saints. For spiri∣tuall
Treasures (like the loaves blessed
by our Saviour) multiply in their use,
and when thousands have been enrich∣ed
by them, doe still remaine suffici∣ent
to enrich thousands.
To you honoured Sir, is this small,
but Precious treasury presented, not
as though your own store were not
already full; for who knowes not
how many precious Jewels (through
the riches of Christ in you) you have
richly set and polished for the ador∣ning
the Bride the Lambs wife? Sure∣ly
the spirit of Christ seemes to have

chosen and sealed your Spirit to cele∣brate
his own Nuptials in your Mysti∣cal
Marriage and song of loves.
But as gold, besides its own internal
worth, receives an Authentick impressi∣on
from the Image and Superscription
of the Prince: And as in honouring the
Lord with the best part of our sub∣stance,
An humble acknowledgement
of his Interest both in the whole and
our selves (not any Addition to his
fulnesse) is intended: So is this Trea∣sury
presented to the touch and test
of your Judgement, First as the Stan∣dard
of approving things that are ex∣cellent.
And then as an humble te∣stimony
how much he owes himselfe
to you that presents it.
That the Lord would make you
long an Ornament and defence to

his Saints, and prosper his own plea∣sure
in your hands, is the prayer of,
Honoured Sir,
