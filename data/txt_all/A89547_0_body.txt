Honoured Ladies:
HAving had the happi∣ness to draw my first breath in this renow∣ned City, though of Forreign Parents, and being turned young into the wild and Mili∣tary World, to become a Son of Mars, I was forced to relye on
Esau's Blessing, and to content my self with Alexanders Por∣tion; but being of late retur∣ned again to this the place of my Natievity, and permitted to endeavour an honourable and honest subsistence, I have re∣signed, my self to Minerva's milder tuition and protection.
In prosecution whereof, meet∣ing with the ensuing Treatise, originally written in my Prede∣cessors Language, I have ad∣ventured to make it speak English, and presumed to pub∣lish it under your Ladiships Patronage, the better to shelter it from such Criticks of the Times, who savour no Viands
but of their own fancying and Cookery.
And although this work in it self may seem very improper to be communicated to this Na∣tion, where every Matron, and young Damsel are so well vers'd in the Pastry Art, as that they may out-vie the best Forreign Pastry Cooks in all the World besides, yet this said Treatise containing nothing save Out-landish Cates and Junkets (farre in∣feriour I must confess to ours) I doubt not but will give that satisfaction unto your Ladiships, and unto all other worthy Ma∣trons, and ingenuous Damsels,
as may encourage my self, the Translator, to proceed to the Englishing of other Treatises of the like nature, proper for the knowledge, and use of so judici∣ous personages as your selves.
A Second Motive which made me to adventure upon this peece of Pastry, was, to testifie my gratitude to this my Mother City, by preparing (for her Sons and Daughters pleasures and divertisements at their spare hours) some Forreign Cates and Delicacies, happily never as yet tasted within her walls.
Nor could I omit to dedicate them unto your selves (most
Honoured Ladies (who all three of you, may be justly ter∣med to bee the Mirrours of Knowledge and Excellency in these laudable Professions, that thereby I might give a testimo∣ny to the whole World of my submission and obedience unto my Political Parents, your selves being such, in reference to those Honourable places of trust so deservingly conferred, and so worthily supplied by your Honoured second Selves, who as they are the Supporters of this flourishing Cities admira∣ble Government, so will their renowns, and yours (honoured Ladies) live to all eternity by
theirs and yours Patronizing, and cherishing of Vertue and Learning.
In confidence that this my presumption may meet with a favourable construction, and a kind acceptation, I crave your pardon for this importunity, only requesting an additional Boon, That I may have leave to stile my self, Honoured La∣dies,
This 17 of May, 1656.
