IF your Ladyship hath not before this
time very iustly expected the best of∣fice
of my Muse, it is now time for me
to be voluntarily ashamed, that you
should so long forbeare the vse of so
many honourable encouragements. But
(alas) finding my abilitie too little to
make the meanest satisfaction of so great a Principall as is due
to so many fauourable curtesies, I am bold to tender your 
this vnworthy Interest, wherewithall I will put in good
securitie, that assoone as Time shall relieue the necessitie of my
young inuention, I will disburse my Muse to the vttermost
mite of my power, to make some more acceptable composition
with your bounty: In the meane space, liuing without hope to
be euer sufficient inough to yeeld your Worthinesse the smallest
halfe of your due, I doe onely desire to leaue your Ladyship in
▪
That when encrease of Age and Learning, sets
My Monde in wealthi'r state then now it is,
 pay a greater portion of my debts,
O mogage you a better Muse then this,
 then, no kinde for bearance is amisse,
While, though I owe more then I can make good,
 is inough, to thevv hovv fame I woo'd.
