SIR,
I May not rob you: take your owne. Your owne is this Sermon: origi∣nally, efficiently, occasionally, and authoritatiuely: First, you sent me to the Vniuersitie: there your cost, counsell, and care, made me a Stu∣dent, Scholer, and Fellow. Secondly, you call'd me from the Vniuersitie, to a Liuing of your owne Do∣nation, a Donatiue indeed; without Simonie, or Flatterie. Would God euery English Patron, and Pastor, could say so much, and so truly. Thirdly, Your discourse did direct me to this Text. Fourth∣ly, As your Substitute, I preached these Meditations. Take therefore your owne, this Sermon: with in∣terest, the Author also. Who proclaymeth himselfe bankrupt, that he is able to pay no more: you hauing bound him in a farther Obligation. But he hopeth, you will accept him, as you hope God will accept you, 2. Cor. 8. 12. And so much he promiseth to you, be∣fore him, euer to rest
