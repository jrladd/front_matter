SIR the worthie estimation which first your Father, then your selfe with your Worshipfull Brothers haue gotten, and euer retained in your countrey; for hospitalitie and many other your much commen∣ded vertues, together with the de∣sire I haue alwayes naturally had to do that declining name: (arightly so cald if in you & them it decay, whom all the rest hop'te to haue seene the euerlasting propagators of the same, and in which number I a sapplesse braunch of that trunke am one) to whom I owe all seruice or aught which might adde therevnto reputation; hath drawne mee to make ten∣der of these my traductions, from the French, Latin, and Italian tongues, of this Mahumetane or Turkish Hi∣storie, to your saide selfe with your brothers, as true tokens of my deuoted minde, whereof to the vtmost of power you and they may dispose; Not for I thinke this Dedication or any other acte of mine, can giue aught to the fulnesse of your prayses whereof e∣uery tongue that knows you plentifully speakes: But onely for I seeke in some honest office being an ad∣mirer of your and their vertues, to make knowen my affection (though my selfe vnknowen) which in ma∣ny

meditations hath often wished any occasion, that in trew coullers to you and them might once make it appeare; And now not expecting longer any greater: (for what might he in occasion expect further whose valew onely consists in his minde) being importuned by the much intreatie of friends, that these my paines taken in this Historie might come abroad, I thought none so fit as well in regarde of my saide affection, as of your and their worthinesse to whom to consecreate these my lesse worthie labors. Wherefore to you sir the first both in time and place I present this first booke cōtayning the Originall of these Turckes with the foure Monarchies discended of them as the forerunner both in time and place to the other following, and not vn∣fitly appertayning: Because this booke being furnished with much varietie of matter as translations of Empires, chaunge of gouernment, small things from their meane beginnings growing to great persection; great things by indiscretion and litle consideration, ruined, and o∣uerthrowen: Occasions hapning and happely pursued, drawing estimation and aduancement; neglected, pul∣ling on dissolation and distruction. I say these and such like in this euerie where appearing to whom might I commend then your selfe whose ripe age cannot but be freshly stored with multitudes of such good ob∣seruations, gathered from presidents, and examples, foraine and domestique, both of these and former times: And surely when my selfe aright enter in con∣sideration of these thinges (whereof these bookes are a rich store-house) let mee speake it with a reuerend regarde alwaies (and vnder controule of religion) I am in opinion often a Platonist, assigning all mortall affaires

necessarelie a periode in theyr perfection, to which hauing attayned, they fall into a retrograde of decli∣ning, vntill they be brought to the lowest degree which miserie, can alot: nor there long continuing, againe and againe reuiue and arise from foorth the ashes like to the Arabian Phaenix, (or as the Phisitions talke of the state of our bodies) alwaies either mending or impayring but neuer standing at one stay; So as houl∣ding on this continuall course, the vtmost point euer of felicitie or infelicitie is conioyned in the selfe same instant to his next contrarie; which Macrobius well ob∣seruing hath worthely depictur'd in these wordes.

Non possunt primi esse omnes omni tempore
Summum ad gradum claritatis cum veneris
Consistes egre, & citius quā discendas decides
Cecidi eg, cadt qui sequitur, ls est publica:

And as wee see in casting vp accompts those, and the same counters to fall in places now of poundes now of pence, without any certaine continuance o∣ther then sorts to their course: So not vnlike is our condition heere, commaunded still with the chaunge either of better or worse, whereof Seneca according to his graue manner hath thus saide;

Nulla sors longa dolor & voluptas▪
I nuicem adunt: breuior voluptas.
I ma permutat breuis hoa summis:
Nemo confidat nimium secundis.
Nemo disperet meliora Lasis.

Which reasons whilst more narrowly I doe examine (though not so nicely as Plato to say that thorough the operation of the superior bodies in these inserior, or by the reuolution of the heauens in this or that

time this or that shall fall foorth) haue beegotten in mee a beleefe for maintaining a second of his asserti∣ons viz.
Omnes serui ex regibus & omnes reges ex seruis oriundi.
For if in the restlesse variation of things and progresse of time, vnauoydable ruine attend the succession of greatnesse, but aduauncement on the posteritie of mi∣serie: who liues in so base and abiect fortune who may not chalenge his being from worthie auncesters, and assure himselfe in him or his to see the arising Sunne of bright shining honor; As on the contrarie, what other aduanced to the highest degree of dignitie, who may not suspect the meanes of his first beginning, and iustly feare in the weaning of his fortunes to what cōdition (by the violence of this currant) he or his may be brought; All this I say am I drawne more redely to leane too; by reason of this present historie, for behoul∣ding heerein from how lowly and small beginnings the victorious & neuer degenerating race of these Ottamans, together with the inuincible nations of their Turkes are growen; that being but bare breach Tartars only, runne out of the caues of those horrid countryes of the Ri∣fean and Caucasus mountaines, yet haue with glorious successe in their attempts ledde captiuitie captiue, made themselues now conquerours ouer the whole East; & in fine are become euen the terror of the West. Sacking infinit numbers of Citties and Countryes: dispoyling multitudes of Princes and high discended families of theyr liues, together with theyr crownes and king∣domes: and this done in so few yeares space aboue all opinion, or what else before was euer executed by the antique world. It cannot be but to that which the

course of things doth daylie cast vpon them; (if there be a course in things which is not my purpose further heere to dispute:) God almightie in his secret iudge∣ments doth hasten their proceedings, to chastice the in∣gratitude of vs Christians for the small thankefulnesse wee shew for so many his gratious benefits liberally, (though vnworthely) bestowed on vs. But my office is not of a diuyne, hauing in purpose to make knowē one∣ly what they haue euen from the first done, and daylie doe, rather then the reason of the deede, how it is or can be done. In which I heere present you and your Worshipfull brothers with three bookes. This of their Originall, and the seuerall Monarchies discended from them; Another of their conquests and the succession of the house of Ottaman, whose greatnesse hath in manner drownd all the rest; The third of the small gainefull attempt giuen by Soliman (great Grandfather to Mahumet the third of that name who now reigneth) to the Isle of Malta, or Melita, defended chiefly by the forces of the great Maister, and the valiancy of the wor∣thy brothers of that order. By which last booke I wold thus much inferre, that since the prowesse of so small a handfull was not onely able to withstand, but repell the furie and huge forces of so confident an enemie, puffed vp with pride & assurance of so many rich spoiles and gayned victories: O what then would the forces of Christian Princes vnited doe, so we might but once see the glorious beams of that bright shyning day appeare. To this I haue annexed likewise an abstract (borrowed frō the Italians) of such causes as are saide to giue great∣nesse to the Turckish Empire a breuiate onely of a larger worke yet by me vnfinished, deuided into three bookes

which by gods grace shal come forth shortly, shadowed with the fauours of you & your brothers names. These former in the meane time if it shall please you to respect with that kinde acceptance which from you they seeke, though not well deserue: I of my paines receiue a large requital, who desire nothing more; Lastly whereas seue∣rally I assigne dedications of these books to you & your brothers, vpon my seuerall reasons in their Epistles set downe: it is not of any purpose to deuide you or them from the pleasure of any part, which I wish should bee common vnto all: but rather to expresse thereby your mutuall natures cōformities, for as these books though diuersly directed, yet thus together perticipate theyr content to all readers alike if they please, whereto the dedication giues no hinderance. So you of all liuing brothers (with the mightie admiration of men) in distinct bodies are sayde to haue in euerie good thing one and the same vnchangeable will & minde alwayes resident: where meum and tuum the worldes sole con∣tentions neuer take place. Thus wishing to your Wor∣shippe all content of your desires, and therein the full fruition of your health, with much affection prayed for by many, I take my leaue and to your good opinion commend mee; From the midle Temple this 20. of March. 1600.
