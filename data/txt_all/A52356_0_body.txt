SIR,
THE Author of this Ex∣position, having Named Sir John Nisbet of Dirle∣ton for Patron of it, as a Person of great worth, whose Friendship had been very useful to him; Upon the decease of that E∣minent Lawyer, That Title designed

for him, cannot with more Equity be Addressed to any, than to you, upon whom he hath entailed his opulent E∣state. And your having received a great part of your Education under him, and that sincerely Devout Lady now his Relick (a genuine Scion of a Noble and Religious Stock) with the Evidences you have given of answer∣ing their expectation, by an early In∣clination to a Sober and Vertuous Life; and a magnanimous Contempt of vain and sinful Pleasures; These assure me you will intertain this New Heir-ship, not as an idle Ornament to your Clo∣set, but as a notable Antidote against the Snares and Charms of these Ho∣nours, to which your Vertue and the affluence of your Fortune, seem to pave

the way. To prepare you for a cautious Encounter with these, you have here an accurat Map of all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory there∣of, drawn originally by the Divinely-inspired Pen of Solomon, a Wise King, and a Judicious Preacher: The Author only illustrates it with Doctrines and Uses: Here you may survey these un∣fortunat Islands of Honour, Wealth, and Pleasure, upon which many have made Shipwrack of their most Holy Faith. And when you find this infe∣riour World too low a Situation for true Paradise, and too barren a Soil to produce satisfaction to a Heaven-born Soul, lift up your panting Heart to the undiscovered Glories of the higher House, the Habitation of Angels,

and the Saints everlasting Rest; where you will not need Commentaries upon a vain World, and a deceitful Heart, to Arm you against Mistakes and Dis∣appointments; For there the Preacher will turn Praiser, Annotations will be silenced with Allelujahs, and Vanity and Vexation of Spirit swallowed up in fulness of Joy and Pleasures at Gods Right Hand for ever. That these may be your never-fading Inheritance, after ye have tasted the greatest Happiness this World can afford, is the unfeigned Prayer of,
SIR,
