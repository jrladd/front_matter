May it Please Your Majesty,
THE Wisdom of our Laws give Your Majesty the Style and Title of the Father of Your Kingdoms; The Pa∣tron and Protector of the Church and State; The Foun∣tain of Justice, and Supream Chancellor, to do what is Equal, Just and Right, for Abating the Rigour, and Supplying the Defects of the Laws, to make them Answer their true End, for the Honour, Comfort and Benefit of Your Majesty, and Your People: And the Law deems such Enemies to God, and Your Ma∣jesty, as refuse to take, or observe not, Oaths Established, which re∣quire no more of them, than what they by their Vow in Baptism are obliged to perform. And when I call to Mind the many Dan∣gers, both by Sea and Land, to which Your Majesty's Sacred Per∣son hath been so often Exposed, it troubles me, that my Early Pro∣posals were not Accomplished for Your Majesty's Service; yet as it was the Widows Mind made her Mite Acceptable, I hope Your Majesty will Graciously Accept my Good Will, for the Early Re∣dress of such Undue Practices, as All that Truly Loved and Ho∣noured Your Majesty Agreed, and some Reported under their Hands, had been a great Increase of Your Majesty's Glory to Ac∣complish. And now the Good Success God (by Your Majesty's Wisdom, Courage, and Conduct) hath given to Your Majesty's Arms against the Common Enemy of all Christendom, Enlivens me with Hopes, That Your Majesty may now speedily Accomplish the Happy Settlement of Your Majesty's Administration at Home: That Your People may be United in Brotherly Love and Charity, as they were when Your Royal Predecessors Subdued their Ene∣mies, and Conquered France. And if my Experience contribute a∣ny thing to a Happy Settlement, I have my wished Ends; not Doubting but Your Majesty, of Your Immense Bounty and Good∣ness, will Graciously Relieve,
