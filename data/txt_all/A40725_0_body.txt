THere are two sorts of People counted worthy of Honour, quibus obtigit aut legenda scribere, aut scribenda a∣gere, either to write things worthy to be read, or to do things worthy to be written, were I as succesful in the one, as you are in the other, I need not fear a fair ap∣probation of these my labours, but a Sermon once delivered go∣eth afterward to the Press as to the execution; there are man
 things that in Elocution aurem praetereunt (as St. Ambrose speaks) that escape the ear, which when they come to publick view are more strictly observed, and many times weighed in the false weights, of misprison; therefore it was good counsel of that reverend Father: before we deal our poor endeavours, tructi∣nare & discutere omnes scrupulos malevolentiae ponderate & discusse, to try and prove every grain against which the envi∣ous may except, but this labrur I leave to those that have lei∣sure to be more curious, it shall suffice me to trace the steps of that great Doctour of the Gentiles, who delivered what he had, received not in the entising words of mans wisdom but in de∣monstration of the spirit and truth: I hope your wonted can∣dour will apply an Antidote to expel the poyson of malig∣nant spirits, and with the industrious Bee gather honey out of those herbs, whence the venemous spider sucks poyson: but that the porch prove not too large for the building: I conclude in theJacob benediction of the Patriark, the Lord bless you with the blessings of Heaven above, blessings of the deep the deep that lyeth under, blessings of the breast and of the womb.
From my study at South Normanton April 3. 1673.
