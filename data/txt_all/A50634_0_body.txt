May it please your Grace,
MY obligations to you
are such, as may
excuse real passi∣on
in a Stoick,
and seeming flat∣teries
in a Phi∣losopher;
and my gratitude de∣serv'd

not to aspire to that name,
if it should not like them want
measures. But, seing your mo∣desty
makes you think even what is
justice to your merit to be flattery,
as the greatness of your merit keeps
the highest Elogies I can give you
from being so; I shall retain my
respects for you in a breast, which
may dispute sincerity as to your In∣terests,
with the first of those who
pretend to it: With which I shall the
sooner rest satisfi'd, because no paper
nor any thing else except the heart,
which sends you this, is capable to
retain or expresse that kindnesse
it feels for you. In the above-written
enumeration of your Titles,
I have neither design'd to flatter
you, or to contribute to your fame;
but rather to remember you how
much you are debtor to Providence
for it's kindness, and we to you for

your repeated cares, that thereby ye
may be thankfull to it, and we to you.
In order to which, I have present∣ed
you and my Country with these
Discourses, which by inciting
both to be vertuous, will not allow
either to be ungrate: and therein
if I evidence not abilities, I will
at least kindness and respect; which
cannot but far out-value the other,
seing the last relate to you, and
the first respects only my self. Since
then holy Altars have not disdain'd
to offer up Pigeons, and such like
value-lesse things, which nothing
but the sincerity of the offerer could
render considerable, refuse not to
accept and revise these, though
unfiinsht Discourses: And if a mans
last words may be believ'd, I (who
am to make these my last words in
print, and confine my thoughts for
the future to my ordinary employ∣ment)

do assure you, that they
are presented with all imaginable
respect and zeal, by
