THat I should make so bould (Right Honora∣ble) as to shrewde my selfe and this my work, vnder your protection, hauing not deserued the least, of those so many and irrequitable fauours, I haue from the bountiful harts and hands of your Honors, alreadie receiued; you may iustly except against, but
 vnderstāding, that I endeauor this, (the first fruits of my labors) as a to∣ken of my thankfulnes, and an ear∣nest, of my bounden dutie vnto your Honors, as also, that herein I haue imitated, the holy Euangelist Luke,Luke 1.3. in dedicating his labours, to that friend of God (noble Theophi∣lus) in whose stead you are to me. And that by taking the protection of this my work, you shall not only honor God, in proclaiming your selues enemies to Momus, and al his complices, but also, encourage o∣thers, to the performance of the like duties to God, and your Honors: I doubt not, but I shal be freed, from all imputation of boldnesse, both in the hearts, and by the mouthes of your Honors; whose fauour herein, I only craue and respect.
Thus, doubting nothing, of your protection of this my worke, bring∣ing, and offering such gaine vnto your Honors, as is no where else to
 to bee found, but in the word of God. I humblie leaue your Honors to God, and the word of his grace, which is able to saue your soules, wishing to you and yours the increase of faith and good consci∣ence.
