SIR,
THAT Providence, that has so many times, so Mi∣raculously preserv'd, from the Malice of the worst of Men, Your Sacred Self, one of the best of Prin∣ces, has made the Protection of this piece as eminently Yours: For could but the Devil have prosper'd

their unlucky Villanys, as well as the God of Heaven has blasted them; such a Dedication, had been su∣perseded in Your Death, and De∣struction, Hell and Confusion, tri∣umph't here instead of a Monarchy.
But besides the particular Re∣ference it has to Your Royal Pa∣tronage; Your Majesties Permis∣sion emboldens it to lye at Your Feet, when without it, to prostrate it self there, would have been more then a Modest Presumption, and the most submissive Address to so Mighty a Monarch, might seem the result of an haughty Spirit, or at best, but an humble Pride. You

were pleased Sir, to accept Graciou∣sly, what formerly I had Publish'd as Affectionately for the Defence of Your Succession and the Crown, and that at a Season, when the Peoples Madness, had expos'd You, to the Rage of a Merciless Element, the Sea, almost to be destroy'd; tho but the same Stage whereon with doubl'd Dangers, You had often acted wonders for their Deliverance: But Heaven had reserv'd Your Majesty for a Miracle of Success; it was Fate which never fails, no more then your Word; pronounc'd You, for ever safe, and made the calmer Sea, to own its Subjection, as well as since subdu'd the ragings of a Rebel Land.

Such Sir, have been the dangers of Your Life, such and so signal the Deliverances, that it may sa∣tisfy the most Hellish of the Facti∣on for destroying the SUCCES∣SOR, that Heaven it self had de∣sign'd You for a SOVERAIGN: They seem'd wrought, to prove Your God Omnipotent, Your Per∣son Sacred, and Your Monarchy Divine; to supersede the Design and Intent of such a Treatise, not only in the Confusion of their Treasonable PLOTS, but of the very PRINCIPLES and Positi∣ons of the Contrivers, to confound and baffle at once, both Atheist, Rebel, and Republican; so many

signs of remarkable Providence; seem to prevent its own goodness and mercy, and by Your many late deliverances to secure You from future Attempts, for the God of Heaven has detected their deepest Designs of Hell and Dark∣ness, and which themselves must own, none but he could have brought to light, and so must needs now despair of undermining his Anointed, when they must at once hope to circum∣vent the Almighty:
Plot and Treachery, that like the Pestilence walked in Darkness had arm'd it self now with its Arrow, and came to destroy us in the noon∣day;

and that mask'd Sedition, which would have hid it self from also an all seeing Eye, hath not a Figleaf left to cover its naked Trea∣son, for fear least future Ages should disbelieve their Secret Conspiracies, they have seal'd it in Blood, and an open Rebellion: They can not now so much as praevaricate in wonted Terms, They've told us that the Liberty they clamor'd for, was but a License to Murder KINGS: That to ASSOCIATE was but in their English to conspire and Rebel, that to Exclude the Royal Heir, was but seising his Inheritance, and their Revenging the late Kings Death on Papists, but a counte∣nancing

its Contrivance by the Fa∣naticks.
The Design Sir, of these ensu∣ing Remarks, is to root (if pos∣sible) out of their Hearts, what Your Arms have already supprest in the Field; REBELLION; unless those (as I am afraid) are so hardened, that they seldom see their Sin but in the sight of their Judge, the hearing of their Sentence, or the Hands of the Hangman; but 'tis to be hop'd still, that their in∣herent Hereditary obstinacy, may be somewhat suppl'd, since Hea∣ven has show'rd on their heads so many Judgements, and still covered

their Faces with Confusion; since it has wrought wonders for Your Pre∣servation, and some of the most obdurate Jews, were by Miracles converted, at least, let them be but so fair as to Measure the Goodness of Your Majestys Cause, by the same Methods they but once bad∣ly justifyed their own old one to be good, Seditious Souls! let Success, their own darling Success decide it now, between them and their King, and that perhaps may have brought them now to some sedate Reflecti∣ons, and so the sooner to be wrought upon by sober Reason.

Sir, The Libels I have here ani∣madverted on, were most of them the forerunners of these last five Years Faction and Confusion, all of them their most eminent ap∣plauded Oracles, whom like the Heathen ones too, the very Devil himself seem'd to inspire, and not one of them but what had its share in this Invasion of Your Kingdom, and the Crown. Half of this piece had past the Press be∣fore the Death of Your Dearest Brother of Blessed Memory, so that several Expressions will more particularly refer to my departed Soveraign, but such is the resem∣blance he has left behind him in

Your Royal Self, that besides Your Word to imitate Him, which is sufficient even to make You the same; There is nothing that was good or great in Him, but can be as truly said of His Successor; and as our Law supposes a King cannot Dye, so You verify almost in a Li∣teral Sense Your Brother to Live: And as Your Majesty Triumphs now over the Necks of Your Enemies; So I wish I could make You as Triumphant in their Hearts too, that their PLOTS being defeated, their PRINCI∣PLES might be confuted also, and so the most Seditious become Subject not only for Fear, and Wrath, but for Conscience Sake, and may the same God,

whose Word Commands such a Subjection, make all Your most Mu∣tinous Subjects submit to it; make Your Majesty still so Successful both by Sea and Land; make all Your Foes to fall like Monmouth, and be as unfortunate as Argile.
