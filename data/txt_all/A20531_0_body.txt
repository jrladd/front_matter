MOST HVMBLIE BE∣seeching your Honor, that you take it hot for presum∣ption, that I haue dedica∣ted vnto your Honor these my studious meditations vppon Gods Monarchie, and the Deuilles Kingdome: for it is holy and true doctrine grounded on the word of God, which you haue loued and exercised euen from your youth, especially sythens your Honors be∣ing in that honorable estate and office, it is manifest and famously spred abroade that you haue bene, not only ae bolds fauourer, but also an earnest furderer both of holy re∣ligion, and of al other good actions for pro∣fit
 of the common weale. Moreouer consi∣dering your fauorable curtesie towards me of so many yeares continuance, I could not finde so fitte a Patrone as your honor, vn∣der whose shade I might shield my selfe and my litle Booke from commune cauillers, and such dayntie readers as looke more for Method and ornamentes of arte, then for the goodnes in substaunce: whereas the truth and goodnes of the matter, haue no neede of such curiosities: For truth de∣liteth to bee clothed with pure simplicitie, and sincere playnnes to please God, and not mans vanity. Humblie desiring your Honor to accept them in good part, for the debt which I owe vnto your Honor, for your accustomed goodnes and curteous fauour alwayes towardes mee.
Thus wishing your Honors health and happines in the Lord Iesus, and long con∣tinuance of lyfe amongst vs, to the com∣modity of the Church and Common Weal: I rest, humblie at your Honors good plea∣sure and diuotion. And with my continu∣all prayer, I committe your Honor, and all
 yours to the mercie and tuition of the Al∣mighty Monarch, through Christ Iesus our Lord, who euer keepe your Honor from e∣uill: and with his holy Spirite gouerne your life and doings: encrease and establish your fayth, that your soule may cheerfully de∣part in his peace, and bee receaued into his Heauenly ioy when your naturall dayes shall ende.

The often chaunging of the tyme,
Is a sure witnessing:
That of Earthly matter,
Age altereth all thing
