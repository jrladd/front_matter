My Lord,
IF I should undertake to enumerate the many Favours and Advantages I have had by my very long Acquaintance with your Lordship. I should enter upon an Imployment, that might prove as tedious, as the Collecting of the Mate∣rials for this poor Monument, which I have erected, and do dedicate to the Memory of your beloved

Friend Dr. Sanderson: But, though I will not venture to do that; yet, I do remember with pleasure, and remonstrate with gratitude, that your Lordship made me known to him. Mr. Chilingworth, and Dr. Ham∣mond; men, whose Merits ought never to be forgot∣ten.
My Friendship with the first was begun almost Forty years past, when I was as far from a thought, as a desire to out-live him; and farther from an intenti∣on to write his Life: But the wise Disposer of all mens Lives and Actions hath prolong'd the first, and now permitted the last; which is here dedicated to your Lordship (and as it ought to be) with all hu∣mility, and a desire that it may remain, as a publick Testimony of my Gratitude,
My Lord,
