Sir,
MAny struglings I have had about publishing these Notes: I have looked up to God, and at last been perswaded upon these grounds:
1. The many desires both of friends and strangers, both by private speeches and Letters, which I thought might be the voice of Christ.
2. Some good (as I heare) those which are already out have done, and which the rest

might doe, which I have look∣ed on as a testimony of the Lords acceptance of them.
3. I knew not what the Lords meaning should be to bring to light by his provi∣dence without my privity, knowledge, or will, the for∣mer part, unlesse it was to a∣waken and enforce me (being desired) to publish the rest; our works I thought should re∣semble Gods works, not bee left imperfect.
4. I considered my weake body, and my short time of so∣journing here, and that I shall not speak long to children, friends, or Gods precious people, I am sure not to many in England, to whom I owe almost my whole

selfe, whom I shall see in this world no more; I have beene therefore willing to get the wind, and take the season, that I might leave some part of Gods precious truth on record, that it might speak (oh that it might be to the heart) among whom I cannot (and when I shal not) be. I account it a part of Gods infinite grace to make me an instrument of the least good to any. If the Lord shall so far accept of me in publish∣ing these things, it is all that I would desire; if not, yet I have desired forgivenesse in the blood of his Sonne, for what ever errors or weaknesses may be in it, or are in my self, which may hinder successe, and fru∣strate

its end; only what I have in much weaknesse beleeved, I have written, and sent it unto you, leaving it wholly with your selfe, whom I much love and honour, that you would adde or detract any thing you see meet, (so as it be not crosse to what I have writ) and if you then think it meet for publike view, you see upon what grounds I am content with it; but if you shall bury it, and put it to perpetuall silence, it shall be most pleasing to him who thinks more meanly of it then others can,
