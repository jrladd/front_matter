Sir
I Know you, and in that your worth, which I
honour more, then greatnesse in a Patron:
this Tragedy hapning into my hands, I haue now
aduentured it vnto the Presse, and wanting both
a Parent to owne it, and a Patron to protect it, am
fayne to Act the Fathers part, and haue aduentuâˆ£red
to addresse it vnto your Worthy selfe; vnder
whose wings it flyes for a new birth: it hath passed
the Stage already with good applause, and I doubt
not, but from you it shall receiue a kinde welcome,
who haue alwaies bin a true Fauourer of Artes
and Learning; and from your selfe I haue receiued
so many noble curtesies, that I shall alwayes rest
