My Lord,
THe Honour of your Name, and cleerenesse of Soule, which want no living Monuments in the heart of Princes, have already made the Title of this Poëme inno∣cent, though not the Author; who confesseth his guilt of a long ambition, by some Service to be knowne to you, and his boldnesse at last, by this rude attempt to kisse your Lordships hands.
Fame with one breath hath possessed the world with your Lordships general knowledge, & excellēt Nature, both, an ornament to your blood, & in both you stand the rare, and iustified example to our age. To the last, these cold papers addresse themselves, which if (with truce to your richer contemplations) you vouchsafe to read and smile upon, not onely

they shall receive a life, beyond what the Scene ex∣actly gave them, in the presentment, rewarded with frequent applause, but your Lordship shall infinitely honour him, whose glory is to be mentioned.
The humblest of your Lordships Servants,
IAMES SHIRLY.
