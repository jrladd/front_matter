TWo reasons, my Honorable good Lord, mee especially mooued, to de∣dicate this Booke to your Honor. The first; for, I helde it my deutie, to certifie you of the notable abuses dayly committed by a great number of very bad fellowes, who vnder the couller of Office and seruice, doe mightely abuse both Iustice and Iustices: which in this Booke is largely discouered. The next; for, your Honor being there∣of certified, such bad fellowes shalbe the soner lookt into, and their outragies quallified: so that the soner by you, the like mischieues may be preuented. What I haue done, is in loue and Zeale: Both which, I doubt not, but they will excuse my boldnesse: And so the worke be acceptable in your good opi∣nion, I will not regarde the mallice of the threatning Cunny-catcher; who hath sworne, if I publish this Booke, they will do me what mischiefe they can. But how little I regarde their windie wordes, they may well perceiue by my proceedings: if this worke had beene worth a Talent, it should haue beene your nors: and being a poore mans mite, I desire it may be ac∣ceptable:

and if heereafter I shall be better able, your honor shall not faile, but finde me ready to do your honor seruice, euen to the vttermost of my power. Thus assuring my selfe safe shielded with your fauour, to whome I present this Booke, desi∣ring you to take the full view of this Black Dogge of New∣gate, I humbly, and in all dutie, cease to be tedious: praying to the Almighty, to lengthen long your dayes, with encrease of all vertue and honor, and after this lyfe, to send you to euer∣lasting happinesse, and ioyes endlesse. Amen.
