NO sooner had I done my duty to Gods commands and yours (Honorable and worthy) but (blessed be God) you presently applied to do your duty to God, the King and your Country with such Justice, Mercy and Humility, that you have by an astonishing joy revived the sunk spirits of all just, merciful, and humble men in these three Kingdoms, who had for many years been sorely de∣pressed and almost despaired under the importune injuries of some insolent and proud Masters; who with Cesar or Pompey were impatient of any superior or equal; yea with Lucifer and Antichrist they exalted themselves above all that were called God in the Bri∣tish Honour and Authority; advancing their unjust and merciless ambition so high, that at last it fell, not by force so much, as its own weight, and that just con∣fusion which God brought upon those Babel-builders; whose foolish building had indeed many pinacles of fanatick opinions and projects daily starting up, yet but one great Tower or Mole, whose moorish or sandy foundation was tumult and violence; its line

and measure, fancy and providence; its materials, the lives and estates of its Countrymen; its cement, the blood both of Kings, Priests, and People.
§. The gracious and glorious God, who alone doth wonders, hath by the Justice, Mercy and Humility of the two Houses of Parliament (added to the most renowned Generals humble valour, and loyal cou∣rage) soon made Nehustan of those brazen Ser∣pents and Idols which were made up of subtilty and hypocrisie, violence and impudence.
7. In a few days (even before I could print what I had preached) we have lived to see that holy Motto under the Kings Arms made good; Exurgat Deus, dissipentur inimici: Let God arise and his enemies shall be scattered, Psal. 68.1. The royal (Dieu & mon Droit) God and my right, hath like Moses his Serpent devoured the Serpents and rods of those Ma∣gicians, who usurped all things, yet nothing more falsly and unjustly than that Inscription Deus no∣biscum, God with us; when indeed they had neither his Word, nor the Laws of the land with them: with the like vain and arrogant ostentation did Dionysius boast of the gods good will and approbation, when after his sacrilegious pillaging one of their Temples, he had a very fair gale of wind to carry him and his booty home by sea.
§. Certainly, nothing is more remote from Gods gracious presence, and the power of godliness than that brutal power, and inordinate might, which is carried on with penal prosperities and successes, but without any right, as to Law and Justice, which are the only rules and boundaries of good conscience, also the soul and life of all righteous Government;

void of which the other is but (cadaverosa poten∣tia) a putid carkass of prevalent usurpation, which stinks in the Nostrils of God and all good men.
§. But You even You are those True Worthies who by your just, loyal and humble agnition of, and submission to the Kings lawful Authority, have made Mercy and truth meet together, yea righte∣ousness and peace kiss each other: You have fulfil∣led in the affirmative that old and ambiguous verse (which I remember to have heard many years before our sad troubles) which ends with Nullus; In which Negative the time-serving Astrologasters and others strongly fancied, they found a fatal period of the Bri∣tish Monarchy, at least of the Stuartian royal family, O how must it make those Diviners mad, to see (what I long ago hoped would be the meaning of it) that King who was made and esteemed as Nullus, (a per∣secuted, expulsed, and as much as lay in humane ma∣lice, a nullified King) to see him reign as surely and gloriously as any of those royal Predecessors did, who under the emblems of other words made up that strange verse.
§. To which so benign an interpretation and event, there wanted not some providential omens and sig∣natures; as first that star which appeared a little af∣ter noon on the day of the Kings birth,May 20. Anno 630. of which there were many eye witnesses in London and Westminster, Next were those meddals of silver which were then coy¦ned, with this Inscription, Hactenus Anglorum nulli, to denote that Prince to be the Nonsuch, who alone had the glory to be born Heir apparent to these three British Kingdoms; Nor was his signal preservation after Worster-fight a small pledge of Gods special

protection, whose usual methods are to build up to an unwonted height and conspicuity of glory, there where he lays the deepest foundation of earthly af∣fliction.
§. I confess I cannot sufficiently (with you and all good men) admire the wonderful revolutions and intricate ridles of Gods providence; punishing us justly for our sins, yet relieving us mercifully from our sufferings: We are yet in extacies of joy and wonder, as those that dream; hardly believing the strange undeserved and unexpected dispensati∣ons of God toward us; in which he hath made that pre∣cious stone which some builders refused, to become the corner, the capital, and crown-stone of the building; the only center and stability of that Arch, in which the loyalty and love, the joy and hopes of all good Subjects, and true English-Prote∣stants do meet and six.
May you go on prosperously and unanimously un∣der the Banner of the most high God to compleat your religious, loyal, just and valiant Counsels; not only to establish his Majesties Throne, and our civil rights in Truth, Mercy, and Peace; but also to cleanse and repair the Temple, the Church and house of the living God, whose miserable dilapidations, and sor∣did ruines in doctrine, devotion, discipline, order and government are such, that you cannot but pity to see all things sacred covered with dust; and the Ministery of the Church both Bishops and Presby∣ters almost buried with the rubbish of factions, con∣fusions, dissentions and despiciencies.
I confess this Church-work ought (as the Kingdom of God,) to be first in every good Christians intenti∣on,

(as no doubt it was and is in yours) But you are not to be blamed, by any unseasonable severitie, if, as to point of execution, you first applied your selves, in the present distress of our times and affaires, to settle and secure as to the main, those things which belonged to your civil rights, and National peace. The exigents or extreamities of which, not bearing any delayes, do sufficiently justifie your indeavors, to preserve the ship of the State, in which the Church is imbarqued, which being almost Ship-wrackt and sincking, it had been a very preposterous zeal, to have left the vessel to have contended with the Rocks and Sands, by a superdevout diligence to save the lading, or goods in it; Alas we had been much to seek for a reformed Church, in a ruined State.
Your discreet and orderly diligence took the right method, in making way for religion, by civil justice; nor need you fear the dictates, frownes and censures of any Anastarchusses, whose piety like Jacobs might hope to have supplanted this just necessary and honest policy, of restoring our civil laws, and royal authority, by which our Religion, as Cristian and reformed, was best esta∣blished.
§. The setling or reforming of religion; in all its duties and devotions, discipline and decencies, together with its order, and Government, is a work which requires not only time, but that leisure which is attended with a calme and steddy posture of civil affaires: Men cannot build Gods Temple till they have first washed their hands and purged the land of inno∣cent blood. No prudent piety can think such a storme as we were in, was a meet season for Church reforma∣tion;

It would only fit those who might hope to fish best for their parties & opinions, in troubled waters, knowing their projects and models to be less consist∣ent with the true interests and pristine welfare of this Church and State; doubtless they must have made strange work of Church and reformation, before ever they had owned, and restored the Master-builder, the King, who is supream Governour of it under Christ, as to all extern order and Authority. We hope and pray, that God will shortly give both his Majesty, his Parliaments and his loyall people, such rest on every side, as may be most apt for those sacred and serious concernments of the Church and true Religion, which require first Justice, as to the rights of Christ and his Church, both Bishops, Presbyters and People; Secondly they require mercy, as to that remission, moderation and condescention, in things not necessary, to the being and well being of religion, which either tender consciences, or weak, but humble and harmless Christians do require, yea and expect, agreeable to Christs care of his little ones, and the A∣postles regard to weak brethren, yea and the Kings gracious expressions touching his regard to such, that they may not be needlesly offended, superciliously de∣spised, or rigorously oppressed, in matters that are neither of faith nor morality.
§. Lastly, Religious composures require an unfein∣ed humility, and self denying, as the proper rule and measure, and of all Church-work, that nothing may swell out, beyond the plumline of verity and charity, order and decency, use and edification, either in the substances, or circumstances of Religion, nor yet in the controversies of it.
§. In all which blessed counsels and endeavours, there will be need and use of the assistance of the best heads, the honestest hearts; and the softest hands which the Church of England affords; not only in the Nobility and Gentry, the Lords and Commons, but also among the Clergy, who are no doubt the Angels or Intelligences most proper, for those motions and that spheare of Religion.
But we hope by the good hand of our good God, up∣on his Majesty and your loyal counsels, for the best of blessings, a wise constitution, and well ordered admi∣nistration of religion, both as Christian and reformed, which will be the greatest glory and stability of all estates. As you have given to Cesar the things that are Cesars, so no doubt you will be ready to give to God the things that are Gods: In which just and humble retributions, you will both shew mercy to many thousands of souls, and obtain mercies for your own; for which ends as you have the prayers and thanks of all worthy persons, so you shall never want mine, whose freedome in speaking and writing I presume your sound minds can bear, as abhoring to keep your Mini∣sters like Parots in a cage, as at no great charge, so only for the pleasure to hear them speak; Your honor is, that you hear and know, and do the will of God; in which that you may enjoy his eternal rewards, is the Prayer of

May 12. 1660.
