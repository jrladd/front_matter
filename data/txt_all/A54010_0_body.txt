My Lord,
THE favourable Aspect your Lordship is pleased to afford to the living Ministers and Members of Christ, encou∣rages me to address unto your Honour these worthy remains of a Reverend Minister now with God. And as I would humbly implore your Lordship's kind and noble Patronage to these Dis∣courses, so I do with the profoundest Deference and Submission, commend them to your Perusal and Practice. Your Lordship is not without a just Appre∣hension of the Caution and Vigilancy which they more especially stand in need of, who possess an high Station, and manage great Concerns in this visible World, lest they should be diverted thereby from seeking that which is In∣visible and Eternal. The Considerati∣ons presented in the following Sheets, will contribute no small Assistance to your Lordship's Christian endeavours in this weighty Affair: They do not only  make future Invisible Things a match to cope with those that have the Advan∣tage of a Sensible, Visible Presence; but, if duly attended to, may by the Bles∣sing of God, give them a victorious Sway and Empire in the Thoughts and Affections of Men.
That your Lordship's Conduct may entirely correspond with the Profession you make of a most holy Religion, and with the clear Knowledg of Divine Things, wherewith it hath pleased God to endow you; that to your noble Ex∣traction and great Abilities, you may add many honourable Atchievements, and happy Performances, for the Glory of God, the Good of his Church, and the Prosperity of your Native Coun∣try, to the everlasting Honour of your Person and Family in this World, and to the Salvation of your precious Soul in the World to come, is and shall be the Prayer of,
