FOr as much as the litle cree∣ping Creatures of the Earth, doe teache euerie reasonable person to vse some kinde of trade, whereby for his trauaile in the Sommer, hee maye in the blustering blastes of Storming Hiemps, be releeued by the sweate of his browes, when nothing else is to bee reaped vpon the soile, but onelye Monsterous and huge driftes of Snowe: VVhich is dayly put in vse by the litle Dormous, who in the Sommer∣time, ceasseth not from traueyling, till shee be fully perswaded to haue sufficient store in her Cabbin, to defende the hungry time of winter: Likewise the crawling Ant, toileth from the first showe of Sir Phe∣bus face in the morning, till the blacke Mantelles doe obscure the bla∣sing beames of the same: The Squirrill that lightlie Leapes from Braunche to Braunche, is euer occupied, as appeareth by the greate store of Nuttes, that shee heapeth togeather in Sommer time, to in∣counter the barren season: The fearefull Flye is not forgetfull of the same, but carrieth his trauailes to the warme hollowe reede, wherein hee dwelleth holsomely, and Bankettes merilie of his late trauailes: (VVhat shall I say, of the busie Bee) whose curious skill in building of her Lodge, and knowledge in Flowers and Hearbes, in chosing the Good, and leauing for the Spider the ill, neuer ceasing, but alwaies in trauaile, hoping in winter to rest and enioye the fruites of her tra∣uaile: Immediatelye vpon the sodaine, is not onelye spoiled of this the fruites of her great toyle, but commonlye slaine for the lucre therof: (Euen so) Right VVorshipful, as I am not onely taught to abandon Idlenes, as wel by the holy Scriptures, as also by these creeping Crea∣tures: So am I doubtful, least after my trauaile, I shall reape the harme∣les Bees rewarde: Except, (as my trust is) your VVorship do seeme by your curtesie, to protect as well mee, as this litle portion of my labour: For mee thinkes that I heare alreadie Enuie whet his Teeth, whose

blade woulde long agoe, haue beene bathed in my blood, if secreate thwacks could haue touched my guiltles Carkas: Yet notwithstanding I see the blasing brond in his fist, to fiere the great Cannons vpon me: for alreadie false Report his Trumpeter, soundeth vp his forging Trumpe of Detraction, whose honest nature is neither content with that which hee wisheth him selfe, nor yet pleased if he might haue or obtaine, that which other men desire. Many mofriendes this chafing Champion hath, whose Cankered mindes, and prowde stomackes, would not much stick to take in hand to Lift with Atlas: To wrastle with Sampson, or take the club from Hercules. But disdaining further to speake of Enuie, and his saide friendes, which hateth euery man, and euery man him, & them, being nothing doubtful of Momus, Zoilus, nor Sicophants wlelps: I am as well content to beare with their barking, as many vvorthy Clarkes heretofore haue done, and doe daylye. So that it maye please your VVorshippe, to take in good part this simpletrauaile of mine, vvhich to eschewe Idlenes, and speciallye i suche times as my turne came to serue in watche of the Scottishe Queene, I then euery night collected some part thereof, to thend that nowe it might the better appeare, that I vsed not altogeather to sleepe: Though one time I chaunsed among many vvatchfull nightes, to take a slumber, vvhich incited mee to compile this fiction of Poetry, as more largely appeareth in my Prologue: And though it bee a Drousie Drea∣ming peece of vvorke, neither garnished vvith Rhetorike, Eloquence, Curious tearmes, nor pleasaunt matter, to purchase prayse of daintie Dames, and fantastical Knights of Cupids court: (As it is not painted vvith these properties) so I am assured that your vvorship doth not mislike the want thereof. And for that it was thus begunne and ended in my Lord your Fathers house: my singuler good Lord and Maister, for whome, and my good Lady my Mistres, I and al mine, dayly pray, as we are many waies bound to doe: Doe nothing mistrust, but that your vvorship will the rather take in good part the same, not weying the gift; but the good vvill of the gyuer. And so your vvorship doth as vvell binde me and mine, to reste yours, to our power, as also therby, my poore peece of trauaile from the spoile of Sclander, and the blody butcher Enuie, by the same, garde and keepe, for othervvaies, my saide enemies vvill not sticke to revvard my paines vvith the poore harmles Bee. Thus I cease, and rest.
