MOst Holy Father.
Wheras Aloysius Gonzaga my elder Brother (o which Honour truly I think my selfe vnworthy) in respect of that holy ife which he lead v∣pon earth, & in respect of those things which after his death, by the intercession of his prayers, are effected aboue the force of Na∣ture, is so much renowned, that not only in Italy, but in foraine Countries also, there is exhibited veneration and honour to his Pi∣cture, expressed either in Tables, or Brasse, as if it were of some Saint: And for so much as it is the custome of Families, to propagate the memory & Honour of their Ancestours or Illustrious Fame, by preseruing their Pi∣ctures or statu's; I had likewise determined to keep at home for the behoofe of me, and my

Posterity, this History, as a monument of my duty, and obseruance towards him, being a representation not only of his body, but al∣so of his mind: which parte of vs, truly, is so much the more admirable, for that it ma∣keth admirable all other parts, and so far the more worthy, because it is the Authour of all dignity and worth.
But afterward being exhorted by Pope Clement the eight, a man most worthy of E∣ternall Memory, who for so much as he did both remember with what sanctimony he had lead his life, and had heard the fame of his miracles, thought it fit to be diuulged for the publike good, changing my resolution I determined to put it in print. This truly du∣ring his life, was not in my power to per∣forme; since, he departed out of this world at the time when I was called by my Soue∣raigne Lord the Emperour, into Germany. But now, seing You (most holy Father) haue with infinite congratulation of all sorts of people succeeded him; and haue not only ap∣proued of this his will, but also, after You were certified by certaine Illustrious Cardi∣nalls of the sacred Senate (vpon whome you imposed that charge) of his excellent exam∣ple of vertue, and sanctity of manners, haue vouchsafed some few dayes since, by your letters sent vnto me, to honour him with the title of Blessed, I now come with all the humility I can, to consecrate vnto your Ho∣linesse, his Life, augmented not only with

those miracles which were wrought euen vn∣till that time, but with others, that also fol∣lowed afterward.
The which thing I thought good to do, both for other causes, and especially, that when Eternall Honours are wont to be deputed to Saints, by that supreme Coun∣cell of the world, ouer which You (most Holy Father) are the chiefe; and that con∣sultation is had in the same, of confer∣ring them vpon him; you may take know∣ledge, by how good desert of his, and v∣pon how iust causes, you may bestow them vpon him. Which truly, that you will do, your Benignity perswadeth me to be confi∣fident, (and I beseech you speedily to con∣descend therunto) and that you will giue care not only to the peitis of all the Prin∣ces of our Family of Gonzaga, but also to those many others, who are most humble & earnest suppliants vnto you for his Canoni∣zation. And if you please to permit this to be obtained at your hands, they professe that it would become a thing very gratefull both to them, and to the people of their Domi∣nions. To conclude, after the custome of my Ancestours, humbly kissing your Holinesse fee, I eanestly begge your Blessing.
