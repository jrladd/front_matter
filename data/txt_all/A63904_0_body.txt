SIR,
I Am very sensible, it is too great an Honor that is done me by the general Approbation, which this Sermon met with; not that out of Real, or which is still worse, out of a Counterfeit and Pretended Modesty, I would put an Affront upon so great an Audience, by seeming to suspect the Judgments of so many excellent Persons; but the Subject being Charity, was it self a natural Preservative against Censure; and that very word so often repeated to any Man that un∣derstands and feels the Sense of it in himself, as every good Man unquestionably doth, hath an in∣credible Charm belonging to it, so as together with its Name, to insinuate its kindly and propitious Nature into every Breast, and with an Eloquence peculiar to it self, to bribe even Censure and Cri∣ticism themselves into a favourable Opinion of the Speaker. However, it is enough for me, though I had no other reason, that you, who have so great
 a right to dispose of me as you please, have Com∣manded me to Publish what I Preach'd; and though I know very well, your Friendship is too great to let you judge otherwise, than too too kindly of any Performance of mine; yet I have no power to do any thing but obey, though it be to my own disadvantage: Only, I confess, I am not a little a∣sham'd, that so mean, and as you know, so tumul∣tuary a Discourse, being written in very great hast, when I had scarce time to turn my self, should open so Glorious and Magnificent an Assize: But as it is, the World is welcome to it, and I have nothing further to say, but that it is very much in my Nature to wish and pray, that such a Chari∣table Spirit as I have recommended, might uni∣versally obtain, that I am very much in earnest in what I have written, and that I hope that will attone somewhat for other defects.
May you live as long, and as happily as you de∣serve; and may the King never want such Gene∣rous and Obliging Ministers in every Station, to disperse the happy Influences of his Government over a satisfied and contented People.
I am, Sir,
