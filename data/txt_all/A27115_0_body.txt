THe Of-spring of so many Loyal showers of blood and tears, and Heir ap∣parent to all the love and affection that Your royall Father had first purchased, and then intail'd upon You by a deed of Martyrdome: The Anchor of hope which we expect daily to be cast upon Englands shore, by the hand of providence: Hope hath for a long time brought up the rear, but now shee's in the van of all Your squadrons; and when the Sun is

once set in an Island, how can it rise again but out of the water? may the sighs of Your People fill Your sailes with such a prosperous gale, as may land You safely upon English ground, and seat You in Your Fathers Throne; ay the flower of Jesse▪ and the true Lion of the Tribe of Judah, whom the sacred Harp so often praised, de∣fend all Your Lyons, Harp and Lil∣lies.
Never was there a Prince, whose People were all Prophets, and whose Prophets did all center in their Princes future happinesse be∣fore: whilst the Enemy stands like the every-where wounded man in the Almanack, pointed at by all the caelestiall signs; never was their an Army, who gloried so much in their strength, when they are not able to stand, by reason of the slipperinesse of the ground un∣dar their feet, made so, by the tears

of the People, and the Bloud of their Soveraign. Nothing but Your Majesties Royall Fathers sufferings could have made Him so famous and them so imfamous: Nothing but that could have made the Peo∣ple know the difference between a Golden Cepter, and an Iron Rod. Your Father had been now living, had He been lesse wise: and he had not been put to death, had not His People loved him too well. Was ever Prince put to death by two such hands? They forced the Laws to take away their own life; they made Wisdome to sley her own chil∣dren, by whom shee should be justi∣fied; and the love of the People the murderer of their own darling: who can help it? to cure the Kings evil requires a royall hand. I doe not teach my pen so high ambition as to undertake such cures: but it may be Inke will serve to

cure a tetter or a wring-worm, if it doe but so, I shall think my pains well bestowed, and my duty high∣ly approved of, if, when I have pre∣sented this Royall Charter to Your Royall hand, it may be graced with Your Princely Eie; being it proceeds from as loyall a heart as can direct a pen how to subscribe the pen∣man
