GENTLEMEN,
I Have seen a Treatise, intitu∣led, de Tintinnabulis— that is, of little Bells, the Language Latin, but pen'd by a Dutchman, being a Discourse of striking Tunes on lit∣tle Bells with traps under the feet; with several Books on several In∣struments of Musick, and Tunes prick't for the same: Then con∣sidering that the Well-wishers to ither of them, took great pains to make plain the use of them, I hought it worth a Dayes labour, o write something on this Art or Science, that the Rules thereof

might not be lost and obscured to some, as the Chronicles be∣fore William the Conqueror, being given only by Tradition from Fa∣ther to Son. Wherefore I humbly intreat you favourably to accept this small Treatise, as a foundation whereon may be raised a famous Structure; and if any one objects a fault, excuse it with the Ringing term—He was Over-bell'd— So you will much oblige him that is a Well-wisher to your Recre∣ation,
