MAy it please your Grace. The advantage this slight worthlesse piece aimeth at, in this addresse, is of great conse∣quence, but of a civil and mo∣derate nature. It is no marvel if it desire to go forth under so
 great a Name, that is not like to appear considerable to the world otherwise. But the Countenance it demandeth, is according as the cause may de∣serve: more it must not expect from your Justice, lesse it can∣not expect from your Good∣nesse. If it fail of the Truth, it is a Child rebellious to the Fa∣thers intentions, and according to the Law of Moses, here he bringeth him forth to receive his doom. If it have any thing considerable in a Cause where∣in the world is so well informed
 long since, my suit is, that from your Graces hands it may be derived to the publick. The Lord of Heaven and Earth blesse your Grace with happi∣nesse of this life, and of that which is to come. So prayes
