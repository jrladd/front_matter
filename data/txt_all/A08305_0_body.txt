and of the yongest, of those of my pro∣fession in that place: and yet as a chicken vnder the wings of your Lordships fa∣uour, I rest in hope of defence, frō the scarring practises of such, as (deseruedly or vndeseruedly) make profers and ma∣nifest meanes to bereaue the credite of all and some of those that are or should be, as I (for functions sake) desire to bee: namely, as one able to execute, & with truth to prosecute our vocation, the of∣fice of Attorneis: which office, as it hath and ought to be of credite, so ought it to be executed with honesty and trueth (as it is not vnknowen to too many of vs) is growen into contempt of many. In respect (I thinke) of the ignoraunce that the rudest sort are blinded with, that they see not their owne ease and bene∣fite, slaundering the honest minded for the misbehauiour of the vnsatiable, and vnhonest dealers sakes. But right hono∣rable, omitting that, it resteth to craue humble pardon for my presumptuous andacitie, wherein as a poore Cobler, I presume to shew my selfe as it were rea∣die

to take a pensell in hand to frame a goodly whole and perfect picture, whē (in deede) I know not how to cast the proportion of the very shooe it selfe: yet (alwayes hoping pardon) hauing by experience, a certaine sparke and feeling of sundry extraordinary and approued errours, manifest, resting and daily en∣creasing, among the lowest, as (also) a∣mong those of higher calling and coun∣tenaunce: I presumed vpon my slender learning, to make a shew of the erroni∣ous and peruerse conceit, that a man of these our dayes, in the time of the cleare light, was so besotted in the miste of the voluptuous cares of this cankered world, that he could not see the way to trueth, but betooke himselfe, to the way of sinfull securitie, a man yet breathing, whose reformatiō I heartily wish: And (to the end) that by his folly, other may learne wisedome, and that by his refor∣mation, other may bee reformed: I haue attributed vnto this poore piece of worke (of mine) the Title of, A Sin∣full Mans Solace: for that it is comfor∣table

to all men, and hurtfull to none: I haue contriued it into seuen seuerall dayes conference, betweene Christ and a Sinner: Wherein it may appeare, that as the mindes of men being euill, the dayes dangerous, and good endeuours, rare and seldome: So is our Heauenly Solace, our Mediatour Christ, the rea∣dier, through his grace, to redresse the one, and to stirre vp the other: wherein his willingnes, and care of our saluatiō, his mercy and fauour shewed, and our peruersitie and weakenes, laid open, and Sathan vanquished: Which (right ho∣norable) I haue endeuored to set downe (according to the trueth) as well, for mine owne priuate comfort, as for the commoditie that others may reape of the same: Although) perchance) it may be obiected against me, that I am of an other profession, vnlerned, without ex∣perience, a greene head, & of no iudge∣ment: I yeeld me guilty of all: onely, my profession, as a Christian, I stand to de∣fend: though not a professed Diuine, but a poore Punie, that is willing to be

instructed of the more learned and god∣ly diuines: presuming herein, to make trial, whither it wil winne me condem∣nation or good liking: praise or dis∣praise: fauour, or ill will: But being so resolued of your (good Lordships) good liking of the thing, tending to a good purpose: though not so pithily and ex∣actly handled, as beseemed this piece of work: I rest so much the more, in hope, that your fauour, will breed other mens good affection, to this trauaile: tending to the good o all men, and to the hin∣derāce of none: We wander (right ho∣norable) in a wildernes of euils: we are beset with many dangers, familiar and houshold perils and annoiances, which breed in our bosomes, not seene, not heard, not felt, nor vnderstood: by rea∣son, that naturall inclinatiō to euil, doth blind our eies, & dull our sences, in such sort, as neither, vertue, trueth nor grace, can take any place in vs, but is repulsed by the hand of sinne and Sathan ruleth in our hearts, and poisoneth all our de∣sires, stirring vs vp to all mischiefes:

hardning so our heartes, that we, very seldome, reforme our liues: nor althogh we be (daily) called to vnfained repen∣tance, like vntamed coltes, too well fed, that know neither master, want, or wo: we run (headlong) after the fleshly mo∣tions of our vnstaied will, worse then the silly birds of the ayre, the beasts or wormes of the earth: who know their times and seasons, and keepe the law of their natural custome, as ancient wri∣ters doe reporte, that the Storke by the Skyes, knoweth the time and season of the yeare, the Crane, the Turtledoue, and diuers other birdes, beastes, and wormes, by their comming and depar∣ture, doe argue that they haue a certayn knowledg, that it is not alwayes Sum∣mer nor alwayes Winter: and accor∣ding to the time they laboure, they rest, they come, they goe, they fast and feed: and therfore doth the Ant, as the least among the rest, gather in the Summer, to supply his want in the Winter. By the due course of which sillie and vnreasonable Creatures, maye Man

feele and vnderstand his owne imper∣fection and weakenes, who being or∣dayned from the beginning, Supreame gouenour (as it were of all the rest of Gods creatures, in respect of the giftes of reason, and wisdome,) whereby he ought to direct his way to the prayse of God, by his sincere and godly lyfe, fal∣leth into diuers, and sundry noysome and vndecent conceites, sinfull mo∣tions, and vngodly deuices, whereby to winne vnto himselfe here, that, that shall be to him in the time to come, a meere impediment and stay of his en∣traunce into eternal ioyes, which earth∣ly eyes can not see, neither can the mindes of mortall men conceaue: for that naturall reason draweth from the true sence of spirituall motions, vn∣to vnseemely attempts, to follow vice, with gredines, lyke vnto the brute beastes, whome no stayed counsaile dooth gouetne, but euen the meere na∣turall motions, whereunto it is incidēt for them to yeeld: wherin, if men showe themselues lyke brutish, to yeeld and

giue their rash consents to euery fleshly motion, It may well be sayd of them, which the Poet Iuuenall sayth:
Demens hou nimium demens, qui cum similis Diis.
Esse queat ratione vtens, vestigia mauult.
Sectari pecudum, veneri venerisque, sod ali,
Ventri indulgēdo, & turpissima queque sequēdo.
They are mad, yea too too mad, that where (in respect of knowledge) they might be as Gods, they will rather choose, through the loosenes of their liues, and carelesse comming forward in vertue, to giue themselues ouer to follow (as it were the steps of brute beastes, in all kinde of filthines, then imitating the godly liues of good men, & counsaile of Christ, to purchase the crowne of eternall blisse: And that by coruption of nature, whereby they repose th affections in vanities: ac∣compting that true felicitie, which is mere vnhappynes, and contemning that, which is most excellent, estee∣ming it as meere vanitie, and that might they of reason, (were it not dimmed

with the clowd of worldly desires, and vaine glory) plainely perceaue: name∣ly, how the Rich-man, the couetous earle, thinketh riches, and great aboun∣dance to be very felicitie: The glutton reposeth his delight in gurmandy, and perswadeth himselfe that delicate fare passeth all pleasures. The drunckard is perswaded, that: Cum, ludeth inter Sciphos: when he is vpon his Ale-bench, he thin¦keth himselfe in Paradice▪ The Leacher and (finally) all sinners, the thyng wher' in they take delight, is chiefest felicitie with them: But (truely) they shall haue their rewarde. A most miserable blind∣nesse it is, whiche hath thus darkened the sences of man, that, hauing in this world, so many experiences, of the mercie, loue, and liberalitie of the Lord,, through his Giftes, his creatures and disposition of thinges wonderfull, for the vse of man. And againe, seeing his Iustice his Vengeance and hatred, which he hath and taketh vpon those, that ronne headlong, by their loosenes of life, and secure conceites, into his dis∣pleasure:

how he turneth them ouer in to a reprobate and darke senee, that they may see, and not perceiue: and heare and not vnderstande, the deepenes of his Iudgementes: For, as he is merciful, so he is iust: as he giueth, so he taketh awaye: he is a mercifull father, but a se∣ueare Iudge: behoulding with angrye countenaunce, the peruers and loose wayes of men: which although he omyt to punysh for a time, he hath a Rod, prouided: an Iron Rod, to beate (euen to powder) those that offend, of malicious wickednes: wherfore, he wylleth vs to be circumspect to walke honestly as in the day tyme: not, in banquetyng, in Chambering and want∣tonnesse: but according to the trueth: So shall our days be long and happy, vp on earth: and after this lyfe, our Ioyes be with out end. Wherfore (my very good Lorde) although my learnyng cō∣meth farre too short, of performing this peece of trauayle, of myne, in such sort, as the weightinesse of the matter requireth, yet I hūbly craue your good

Lordshyps wylling acceptance therof, as the frutes of a wyllyng mind, which I (in stead of a greater Present) this day, amonge those of more value and esti∣mation: I send as a Messenger to ma∣nifest my good affection vnto your good Lordshyp: which as I confesse to be sclender (in respect of abilitie:) I hum∣ly pray pardō of my boldnesse, in trou∣blyng you with so rude a Gift: But that I may not showe my selfe (altogether) vngreatefull, or vnmindfull of my due∣tie, in the beginnyng of this new yeare: wherin euery mans zealous regarde of mainteining fauour with those, whose good countenance, may (in all laudable things, be their defence: I presume to cō∣mend this poore Sinful-mans solace: vnder your protection, to the vew of those, who desire to be awakned, out of their securitie, and trayned in the way of the heauenly verytie: which I haue set downe, not as a thing (in respect of myne owne learning) worthy to be publyshed: but that the course of tyme, waxyng (as it doth) from bad to worse,

may be the better considered: And the Worke (not the workman) to be had in such regard, as the matter (which it importeth) doeth (iustly) require: In which poore trauayle of myne, may be seene, both the follie and secure race of the most: and a course toward a godly Reformation of those that erre, playnly set downe: which being im∣braced, and (duely) followed, shall bring such comfort to the poore afflicted soule, as (in respect therof) all the plea∣sures of this miserable worlde, shalbe esteemed both vayne and dampnable.
