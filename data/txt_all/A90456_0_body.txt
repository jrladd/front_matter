MADAM,
THe Boldness which I presume in suffring this little Volume to make its Humble Address to your Honours fair Hands, is so great, that I should despair of ever finding Pardon,
were it not that the Vertuous Stella, a Lady, both Noble in Extraction, and in the Lustre of her Beauty and Soul, yet in all these, infinitely inferiour to your Honour, lies prostrate at your Feet, imploring a for∣giveness for this Presumption; and to make it known, That she owes her Description to a more Noble Author; since all the Glory I pretend to, is, to have the Honour of Presenting Her to You in the English Dress: Yet when I consider, that among the Old Greeks, the meanest Off'rings, which with a pure Heart they Consecrated to the Temples of their Divinities,
found no less favourable Ac∣ceptance, than those Statues and Vessels of massy Gold, which were Offer'd by that Lydian Monarch, the Envie of his Age for Riches, unto the Temple of Jupiter Hammon, when his Thoughts had devour'd all Asia with his Numerous Army: I am the more For∣tified in the Confidence of this Address; it being made unto a Greatness, equal to those who have been esteemed Deities; and to a Goodness, incompara∣bly more Obliging: Especial∣ly having assum'd the Confidence to Dedicate the Illustrious Shepherdess to your Noble
Sister, the Marchioness of Dorchester; to whom the Re∣lation is the same in Merit as in Nature; both being Daugh∣ters to that most honour'd Lady, who is known to the World as much by the Greatness of Her Vertues, as Her Quality. It had been the highest of Errors to have Presented this to Any, but Your Self, whose Illustrious Affiances, since I have had the happy occasion to mention, I ought not to forget to pay a just Adoration unto the Memory of that Renowned Lord, whose High Prudence and Heroick Magnanimity still Survive in the perfect Image of his Ver∣tues,
your Noble Husband. And, Madam, I am bold to Affirm, That Montalvan Himself, the Grandeur of whose Air and Spirit in all his Writings, have render'd him an Admiration to all men that have been so fortunate as to reade Him, would, had he had the like Opportunity, have thrown himself, and all his Works, at your Feet, with a Devotion as equal to that wherewith the Famous Scu∣dery Presented his Cyrus to the Dutchess of Longevile, as all those Glories and Transcen∣dencies of Mind and Body, which he Attributes to that
Great Princess, are equall'd, if not excell'd by those Divine Rays of Vertue which Crown you with unspeakable Bright∣ness: And it is but just, that this Piece, which small as it is, hath not many fewer Examples of Vertue and Heroick Actions in it, than the most Voluminous Romance containeth, should be Consecrated to a Personage, who alone, Comprizeth all that's Great and Noble in the World: But, Considering how small the Advantages are which this Version hath Contributed to it, and that what there is of Handsom in it, it Derives from the Original; to hope, that an
Essay so little Worth, coming from a Person less worthy, out∣shin'd and Eclips'd by so many nobler Productions, should finde an Acceptance equal with the Devotion wherewith it is Pre∣sented, were an Arrogance as Great as the Person against whom it is Presum'd. But on the other-side, not to repose a Confidence on those Extensive and Ʋniversal Civilities which you equally distribute to all men, were to call in question that high Complaisance, that generous mildness of Nature which hath gain'd you so large an Empire over the Spirits of all the Vertuosi; whenas the Sun,
your Emulatour, in the large diffusion of his Favours indif∣ferently upon all Objects, shines as well upon the ignoblest Weed, as on the most radiant Flower: at leastwise I may Hope, That Stella being of a middle Na∣ture, between your heighth of Glory and my Imperfections, as the Moon is between the purity of the Sun, and the grosseness of the Earth, may receive the light of your Rays, and reflect it back upon this Humble Address: for a meaner Excellency, which re∣quires the presence of Deformi∣ty to set it off, would yet enjoy a considerable Felicity, if it should be thought to deserve the Condi∣tion
of being a Foil to your more exalted Brightness: And per∣haps, there are in Stella such Advantages, as may allow her a pretension to that Honour, and admit her to wait upon your Triumphal Chariot; an Ad∣vancement, in which she will shine more gloriously than any of those bright Creatures, whose Name she bears, do in the Hea∣vens: and whatever Defects she may be thought culpable of, I am perswaded they are neither so Many, nor so Great, but that they may be capable to Merit your Condescention and For∣giveness; and thereby Confirm you Eminent, by the Discovery of
one Vertue more, for whom all Noble Attributes are reserv'd, of which there can be none Greater than that of your Good∣ness, in cherishing a Vertue which Offers her self up to your Service with so perfect and zea∣lous a Resignation: And it is with the same Devotion to your Service, though far less preten∣sions of Merit, that I Passio∣nately Aspire to be Admitted into the Glorious Quality of being,
