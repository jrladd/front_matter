Honourable Sir,
THE confidence of a Stranger will (I hope) easily meet your pardon, when the worth of the Author, and the occasional Subject of the Discourse (in these contagious and calamitous times) have given me too sad an opportuni∣ty of presenting it to your Honour, whose con∣cerns for the Publick Welfare, (even in this Great City) are as eminently great as any o∣thers. The matter of the Discourse is a Confutation, and recon∣ciling the onely two destructive Opinions, that in all Ages (in Contagious and Infectious times) have ever proved fatal to the World: the one too much presuming and relying upon this bold Opinion, That the PLAGUE is not Infectious: and the other, Tum pavor sapientiam omnem mihi ex animo ex∣pectorat: out of a weak and unspirited Precipitation, without exception, flye away from it; both of which are so contrarie to Humanity; that as they are utter Enemies to each other, so (like the dis-agreeing Brothers) they are both in opposition to Chri∣stian





Community and Charity. To say more, were too great a wrong to the Judicious Beza, and to anticipate Your Honours Judgement; To whose Noble Approbation I commend the Author; and hope from Your Noble Candour, You will easily censure this Presump∣tion in,
Honourable Sir,
