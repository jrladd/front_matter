RECEYVE (beloved
in the Lord) a cer∣ten
Letter, which
above eight yeeres
ago, I first did write
at the desire of Mr Io. Scharpuls,
now with God, and others of the
companie then at Stoade, & now
againe have revewed and some∣what
enlarged the same, vpon oc∣casion
of the trouble of cōscience
wherein I did perceyve manie
good Christians to bee cast for

want of sufficiēt light in the same
question which is heere handled,
desiring to minister some com∣fort
vnto them, if it shall please
God to blesse this my endeavour,
in that measure of light which he
hath given me: vse it, and if yee
finde any fruit in it, impart it to
such as have need. The spirit of
comfort and true peace bee with
you to the end. Iuli 20. 1616.
