May it please Your Royal Highness,
THis Present which I most humbly lay at Your Royal Highnesses Feet, could not be worthy Your Acceptance, were it not derived from that Garden of the Muses Your own Country. It is a Poem famous both for its Subject, (Strage de gli Innocenti) and its Author, the Cavalier Marino, who if he appear not to Your Royal Highness in so beautiful and glorious a Dress as was Native to him, yet I hope Your Royal Highness will vouchsafe to look upon him in this English Habit, with which You are now so well acquainted, that, among other felicities which the Nation hopes from Your Royal Person, it is not the least satisfaction that we have so great an Argument of Your good and gracious Inclinations for us, as to have so soon, and so easily attained our Language,
which will encourage the most Ingenious to embellish it for Your sake, with all the Ornaments they can borrow from Your Italian, thereby the better to express their Devotion to Your Service, and more easily obtain pardon for what comes short of Your Royal Highnesses Merits, which is the most humble Petition of,
May it please Your Royal Highness,
