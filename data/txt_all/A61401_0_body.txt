THE high esteem and honour (which I'm infinitely oblig'd always to bear your Name) hath greatly urg'd me to exert some Speci∣men of my gratitude; although so mean, that I cannot chuse but blush at my boldness therein, as being con∣scious to my self, that, unless your Clemency transcend all, this my fond Oblation may justly require a second
Atonement. But your Merits being daily as perspicuous as the Sun, and your Influence too as propitious, are so Infallible Probates of your Candor, that I should assert my self most un∣worthy, did I even doubt, but that you like Heaven (whose Image you both most manifestly bear) would ac∣cept the true and sincere intent of your Oblator, be the act in it self never so frivolous and contemptible,
In quo nil vobis dignum, nisi dantis amores. Wherefore I here presume (as a Can∣didate of your Favour) to tender at your Altar my First-fruits (however they may seem, at least, imperfect, if not wholly abortive) And whence I likewise hope for your Patronage, as being sufficient to defend this my weak Product from the churlish humours of
Criticks; The former of which, if you'll both be pleas'd to accept, and grant the latter, you'll transport me into an Elysium, and more (if more can be) oblige
