YOur prest Assistence & Assistance, past,
Vouchsafed, Heer, wheÌ„ you were summond last,
Binde & imbold mee once more to present
My humble Briefs, in form of PARLIAMENT;
Hoping no lesse Consent of Your Good-wills
In passing These, then of Our former Bills;
So-much more Need-full in this Weed-full Time,
By How-much Vice doth ouer Vertue clime.
