MADAM:
HAuing impor∣tuned
and pre∣vailed
with
that Reuerend
Preacher, who perfor∣med
that last office for
your LADISHIPS late
Seruant, to afford mee a
perfect Coppy of his Ser∣mon,

(which for the fit∣nesse
and worthinesse of
the matter, I thought
much pittie to be bury∣ed
with her,) and pur∣posing
to adde a short
Relation of the happie
Life and Death of my
deare Wife, both which
I thought were very ex∣emplary;
I emboldned
my selfe, to present the
same to your HONOVR
not onely as a thankfull
testification, of my hum∣ble
dutie and seruice, for
all those gracious endow∣ment,
which I so happi∣ly

enioyed in her, (of all
which, vnder God, your
Honour was a chiefe in∣strument)
but also be∣cause
I know that your
Honour, who gladly ap∣prehended
al the meanes
of her comfort through
her life, would as gladly
receiue the true Narrati∣on
of her assured Com∣forts
and Conquest in hr
so Christian death and
dissolution.
Neither is the Sermon
vnfit for your Hunours
perusall, whom God hath
honoured with so many

daies & yeares, & taught
not to feare either the end
of your Pilgrimage out
of this strange Countrey,
or the neere approach to
your owne home.
Thus humbly praying
your Honours acceptance
of that which is most pro∣perly
yours. I pray the Fa∣ther
of mercie, to adde to
all your noble Vertues,
the continuance of your
true prosperitie.
