Madam,
THE Ambition Writers have to flourish with some considerable personage in the Head of their Productions, would be less liable to Censure,
if this Conduct of theirs were regulated by judgment, or in∣fluenced by good fortune. But we many times see the Patro∣nage they make Choice of, has no other desert than that of a Glorious Title, nor no other Claim to their Eulogies than onely Eminent Extraction. But these addresses of mine how∣soever blame-worthy for their presumption are at least autho∣rized by the Contemplation of such Extraordinary Qualities as create a veneration in all mankind for your Ladiship, and have made me throng with this Offering to your Feet. My Design is onely, Madam, your
Entertainment, which I thought this Religious Cavalier capa∣ble of affording, and that the merits of his Story would ob∣tain him the honour of Natu∣ralization from your Ladiship's hands. I will leave to others, Madam, the vanity of endea∣vouring to give the world an Idea of so charming a Character as that of your Ladiships; the vanity of pretending to draw and copy an Inimitable Beauty, and of proclaiming Ʋertues which can never be better expres∣sed than by their effects, and which even out-shine the Glories of your Birth, and the lustre of your alliance. All I aspire to is
the having one Voice in the Ge∣neral Consort, and leave to de∣clare the profound respect and submission wherewith I am,
Madam,
