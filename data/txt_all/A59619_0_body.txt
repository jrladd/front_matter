MY LORD,
'TIS the Fate of Illustrious
Persons to be often visited
by such Importunate Addressers.
Their Quality, which priviledges
them on so many other occasions,

does but the more expose them to
frequent Persecutions of this nature.
Nay, their Retirements are not
able to protect them; for a true
Town-Dedicator will Invade their
most private recesses, and attacque
them even in their Solitude. As I
own my self somewhat interested
in the Reputation of my Author, I
was resolved, that whatever Injuries
he suffer'd in the Translation, he
should have right done him in the
Choice of a Patron; and therefore
to pitch upon one who was no
stranger to his Person or to his Me∣rit;
and who best understood his
value, because he has the truest and
most accurate Judgment in the
World. 'Tis true, my Lord, he
needs no Patronage, as he shines in
his Native Language, for there his
own Merit abundantly secures him;
but I am sensible, that after all the

care that has been taken with him,
he will stand in need of it, as he
appears in ours: With this view,
my Lord, I have presum'd to give
you the trouble of this bold Ad∣dress;
and perhaps your Lordship
is the first Person in the World,
that has suffer'd upon the score of
being the Friend of Monsieur de
St. Evremont.
But besides this, my Lord, you
have another Title to this Transla∣tion.
We have long labour'd un∣der
a Mean, but unjust Character
with our Neighbours, who lye more
to the Southward, and are particu∣larly
obliged to your Lordship for
reversing it. For I don't at all que∣stion
but that your Lordship's ex∣traordinary
Merit, drew from
our Author that Ingenuous Confes∣sion,
which in his admirable Discourse
to the Marescal de Crequi, he makes

does but the more expose them to

a Mean, but unjust Character
with our Neighbours, who lye more
to the Southward, and are particu∣larly
obliged to your Lordship for
reversing it. For I don't at all que∣stion
but that your Lordship's ex∣traordinary
Merit, drew from
our Author that Ingenuous Confes∣sion,
which in his admirable Discourse
to the Marescal de Crequi, he makes

of the Partiality and unjust Pre∣judices
of his own Country-men;
your Lordship's Acquaintance has
convinc'd him that colder Climates
than his own, may produce Per∣sons
of as sprightly a Wit, and
strong a Judgment; and that Po∣liteness
and Elegance were not con∣fin'd
to France. Thus our whole
Island, my Lord, reaps the benefit
of your Noble Qualifications. They
have procured one of the most Au∣thentic
Testimonies in the World,
to pass in its Favour. No Foreigner
will urge our distance from the Sun,
or have the hardiness hereafter to
impute Barbarity to us. St. Evre∣mont
has acquitted us from that Im∣putation.
St. Evremont has own'd
us not to be inferiour in Wit to a∣ny
of our Neighbouring Nations;
and 'tis to your Lordship that we
stand indebted for so advantageous
a Confession.

I said, My Lord, one of the
most Authentic Testimonies in the
World. For I believe it will be a∣greed
on all hands that since the
Declension of the Roman Eloquence
and Empire, there never was a
truer or nicer Judge of Men and
manners than our Author, or one
in whom a fruitful Wit and a pro∣foundnefs
of reason were so happily
reconciled. Amongst his own Coun∣try-Men
or indeed any where else,
I find none that can dispute the
prize with him but Montagne; who
was in truth an extraordinary Ge∣nius,
and has left those remains
behind him that will entertain and
instruct, as long as Mankind pre∣serves
any Taste for Wit and good
Sense. Tho' he writ in a very
impolite Age, and his Language
derives an unhappy tincture from
one of the worst Provinces of France,

yet there is something so forcible, so
vigorous, and so masculine in his ex∣pression,
that after all the considerable
improvements the French Tongue
has received since his time, it still
pleases, nay it Charms and affects us.
Now as all this, and a great deal
more, may deservedly be said in
his Praise, yet his warmest Admi∣rers▪
must be forced to confess with
me, that Nicety was never his
Talent; that amongst his infinite
Variety of Citations (for as our Au∣thor
says very well of him, he's no
troublesome Host, but when his
own Conversation fails him, he has
some Friends to keep it up, till he
has got Breath again,) some ne∣ver
deserved to be mentioned, and
others are urged Mal a Propos;
in short, that his way of writing is
too Pindarical, and his Excursions
too frequent. 'Tis true, he is so

Complaisant to his Reader, as ne∣ver
to leave him in any Barren
Uncultivated places; he gives him
an agreeable Vista of Groves and
Meadows: The Scene varies eve∣ry
moment, and consequently, must
delight him; but still he makes
him wander; still he leads him out
of the way, or at least for the
sake of one Beautiful Prospect car∣ries
him a Mile or two about;
and this at long run cannot fail to
disgust nice Persons who are in
pain till they arrive at their Jour∣neys
end. On the other hand
St. Evremont is not only Master
of all the good Qualities of Mon∣tagne
without any of his defects,
but possesses several others, to which
the former was either altogether a
Stranger, as Gallantry and a De∣licateness
of Discernment, or else
was but slightly acquainted with.

To dismiss this Comparison, he has
a greater depth of penetration; a
greater justness in Reasoning; a
better tast of polite Learning, and a
more exquisite knowledge of the
World. Not to speak of his Lan∣guage,
which will admit no com∣parison.
I cannot conclude this Ar∣ticle
without observing, that even in
his Misfortunes, our Author has recei∣ved
an honourable Elogy from one of
the most Judicious Writers in
France, but a Member of that
Order, which is seldom guilty of
paying Incense to Persons in dis∣grace;
and what is remarkable, an
Order to which he himself had ex∣prest
no great Respect.
But I humbly beg your Lord∣ships
pardon, for dwelling so long
upon a Subject which your Lord∣ship
better understands than a∣ny
person whatever. I am sen∣sible,

I should Commit the same
Solecism, should I enlarge upon all
your several Eminent Qualities
since they are as well known to
the greater part of mankind, as St.
Evremonts Character is to your
Lordship. That Air of politeness
which distinguishes every thing you
say or do; that Unwearied Gene∣rosity
in extending your Favours;
that greatness of Mind, that admi∣rable
Sagacity and Experience in all
Affairs, are so readily ackowledged as
well by those that have the honour to
be admitted into your Conversations,
as others that behold you at a
distance, and only view you in
your Character as it is universally
established; that as they cannot be
set in a better light, so the pro∣claiming
of them wou'd be no New
Discovery.
And yet my Lord, as in all A∣ges

of the World, it has been (if
I may be allowed the expression,)
the Appennage of a conspicuous Me∣rit
to meet with many Enemies;
you have not been without your
share of them; but Heaven be
Praised for setting such great Odds
between their discretion and their
Malice. 'Twas your Lordships hap∣piness
that they charg'd you with
things so disproportion'd and ab∣surd,
that none seemed to be∣lieve
them, but those who receive
every thing without examination,
or those whose interest it was to
spread them. For as it was impos∣sible
for them to say the least in∣jurious
thing of you without ha∣ving
recourse to fiction, they mana∣ged
it so profusely, that like the
Old Relators of Heroic adventures,
they destroyed that very belief
they endeavoured to Propagate.

Even that Instrument, which by
one of the most industrious Agents
of Hell was designed to ruin your
Reputation with the rest of man∣kind,
for which purpose no Arti∣fices
of Threats and promises were
left unpracticed; that very Instru∣ment,
my Lord, served to pro∣claim
your Lordships Virtue to the
World; and never was Innocence
more triumphant, and never did Truth
gain a more glorious Conquest.
And now, my Lord, if your
Candor has not been wholly ex∣hausted
in forgiving these injuries, I
humbly beg you to employ it once
more in pardoning the imperfections
of this Translation. My Friends and I
did our best endeavours, but
found to our expence, it was e∣qually
difficult to imitate and
Translate St. Evremont. The peri∣ods
every where so Harmonious

and yet so unaffected, the Lan∣guage
so comprehensive and yet so
clear, so Polite and yet so Natu∣ral,
that tho' we cou'd pretend to
have reached his meaning in all
places, which is no easy matter
in an Author so very nice and pene∣trating,
yet we cannot without a
sensible regret, observe how much
we have fallen below the Original.
Your Lordship has received bet∣ter
presents from other hands,
but this is offered with no less sin∣cerity.
And in this single presump∣tion,
I was glad of this occasion to
declare to all the World with what
Zeal and Integrity,
