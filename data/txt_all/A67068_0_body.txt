Right Worshipfull,
THat undeserved favour and re∣spect which I have found at your hands, and the due respect which I owe to your religious families, do oblige me to shew some testi∣mony of my thankfulnes, And be∣cause I have no better present at this time, but this Treatise of Gods externall Workes, composed out of Ser∣mons heretofore preached to mine own little flock, and in the troublesome time of my late bonds brought into this forme. I must crave pardon for my boldnesse in pre∣suming to offer it to your hands; seeing persons of higher

place have defamed, and branded these and the rest of my Sermons preached for divers yeares last past, with the reproachfull name of factious and seditious doct∣rines; and by their grievous accusations have caused me to be shut up as the great troubler of the City wherin I live, and kept in sure hold least this my manner of preaching might proove dangerous, and a cause of much hurt, and many troubles in these changeable and doubt∣full times. From these and such crimes and unjust ac∣cusations as I have in part purged and cleared my selfe already in a legall way; so by your help and favour I hope ere long to be openly acquitted and justified before the world. If you shall be pleased to cast a favourable eye upon these my poore laboures, and to take a view of them. I doubt not but the precious matter being Gods pure word, will abundantly recompence the failing of the composer, and the defects of his skill and workman-Wherfore humbly craving your kind acceptance of this small token of love, and slender acknowledgement of du∣ty and service; and desiring to become more indebted to you, by your favourable respect shewed thereunto; I commend your worthy persons and religious families to the grace and blessing of the Almighty whose invisible majesty, even his divine power and God-head is clear∣ly seene from the Creation of the world (which is in this Treatise plainly described) and understood by the things created.
