SIR,
ALL the Nations of the Earth wait with impatience for the Oracles which Your Majesties high Wisdom disposeth it self to Pronounce: and the whole Ʋniverse, by submitting to the Laws which you are about to give this Kingdom, will de∣clare, That you alone deserve to Command all men. If the Delphique Priestess scru∣pled not to style Lycurgus a God, for his having setled the Spartans in order; what must not Fame say, when it shall publish Your Majesties August Name? Future ages, Sir, shall proclaim aloud what You perform in Yours; and report the splendour of Your Heroick Virtue. Happy the People who already find the effects of it; but a Thousand times

Happy they of Your Majesties Subjects, whom You permit to offer at Your feet some token of their Admiration. You have often done me the Honour to grant me this precious Favour; and I beseech with lowest respect, that You further please to accept the Piece I now present You. It satisfies not the greatness of my Zeal, that during the course of my Life, I incessently speak of the Passion I have for Your Service; my Writings must inform Posterity of it after my death; and the whole World ever know to what degree I am,
Sir,
