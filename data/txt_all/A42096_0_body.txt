MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY.
ALLMIGHTY GOD having enabled mee, by his grace, to resist those tempta∣tions which have overcome the greatest number of the members of my own Church and Country, and being now incapacitated here a bread to render my Soveraigne, and your Majesty, better service than to owne your Righteous Cause, I think my selfe obliged to give the world a more than ordinary Testimony of my sincere Loyal∣ty and Resolution, in all times and Changes, to adhere unalterably to the Crowne. Having therefore allready sacrificed my Revenue by quitting the Nation rather than submit to the Vsurpation, and exposed my selfe to Censure and Obloquy in that part of England wherein I have Lived, by Refusing to Head, or Ioine with those my dependants there, Ecclesiasticall and Secular, who have departed from their Allegiance, I know of no better and more Convin∣cing Instance yet remaining to bee given by mee of my stedfastness to stick to, and serve, the Royall familie, than to proclame that I dare speake truth here a broad from the Presse as well as from the Pulpit at home, tho every one must fore-know that such an honest Boldness will unavoidably render mee uncapable of the favour and good opinion of all those persons, in the Nation (High and Low Spirituall and Temporal) who have Shipwrackt their Faith and Consciences by ceasing to yeild (after often swearing) Allegiance and Fidelity to their Soveraigne. And it is easy to fore-see, that the Printing these, and some other Papers, at this time, in mine ovvn name, will thus render mee obnoxious (as I am Contented to bee) to all those Builders, who imploy themselves in Erecting a New Monarchy and Church in England. But the Aspersions of them that forsake their Religion, as far as they desert their Lavvfull Liege Lord, (as I hope the follovving sheets will evidence) vvill bee no intolerable Load to mee, who desire no greater Honour and sa∣tisfaction,

than to share with my King, Queen, and hope-full young Prince, in their Misfortunes, and thereby to demonstrate that my poor distressed Mo∣ther, in the greatest and most generall defection (as this seemes to be) that ever vvas among any King of Englands subjects, vvill never vvant some to bear testimony to the truth of her Doctrine; vvho, according to the Exem∣ple of Christ and his Apostles, doth maintaine the practice of Allegiance, and intire submission and subjection to all Lavvfull supreme povvers, deputed by God as his Vice-Gerents to Governe the vvorld. Hovv great a contra∣diction hereof soever, the last years transactions in England have proved (vvhich hath given the greatest vvound that vvas ever yet given to our Church) the Doctrine of Non-resistance Remaines on such authentick Record in the Church of Englands Printed Homilies against Rebellion (vvhich I have in some sort Epitomised in the conclusion of my discourse) that your Majesty, as vvell as the King, vvil, I hope, bee pleased to continue your Cha∣ritie to our Ecclesiastick Constitution, vvith liberty to its members to Exercise their Religion, and thinke no vvorse of the Parent for the disobedience of the Children, but render that Iustice to the Church of England, vvhich is due to all Churches, to vvit, to bee Iudged by her Doctrine, Discipline, and Order (vvhich I am sure never did carry a long vvith them any Rebellion) and not by the practice or Conversation of its Members. VVhereby if the vvhole Christian Church vvas to bee Iudged it vvould, in many things, appeare more vile then some parts of the vvorld overrun vvith Turcisme and Paganisme.
Offerring to God my most fervent devotions for the preservation and Resto∣ration of the King, the Life and Happinesse of the Prince, and (out of Gra∣titude to Heaven) in a most particular manner for your Majesty, vvho have been Instrumentall to the Greatest blessing vvhich hath been these many yeares conferred on the Kingdom, in bearing and bringing forth an Heir male for the support of the Monarchy, I do, vvith all humility, implore yours, toge∣ther vvith his Majesties Patronage, as vvell as beg Pardon for this Pre∣sumption, and vvith the most profound respect imaginable subscribe my selfe
