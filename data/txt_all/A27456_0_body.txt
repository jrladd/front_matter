MADAM,
YOur Ladyship
was pleased to
incourage me
to write Religious
Meditations, & there∣fore
to you I dedicate the
First-fruits of my obe∣dience
to your Commands
in this particular. Your
Ladyship can experimen∣tally

say what high ad∣vantages
pious Contem∣plations
afford: Some
of which are a just Di∣vertisement
from both
worldly and sinful Im∣ployments,
a great Com∣placency
and Delight in
the present Composure,
besides the satisfaction
to our Consciences, the
Improvement of the Di∣vine
Graces in us, and
a rendring our Souls al∣waies
in an Harmonious

sweet temper, (in which
your Ladyship does so e∣minently
excell) being
alwaies in a praying ca∣pacity,
having a willing∣ness
to resign our Wills
to God's in all things,
whether in Life or
Death. If this way of
applying all our Discour∣ses
and Conceptions to a
Religious sense were
made more generally pra∣ctical,
the Power of God∣liness,
as well as the

Form, would so govern
us in all our actions, that
in this present Age nei∣ther
the Speculative nor
the Practicall Atheists
would dare with so much
impudence to shew their
faces, nor maintain their
detestable Principles so
horridly and dis-ingenu∣ously
as now they do;
the Age would then be
reformed, and we should
be good Company to our
selves; for when we con∣verse

with God, we are
never less alone then
when alone. Next to pi∣ous
Meditations, Godly
Friends are to be made
choice of for our Con∣versation,
such as is your
Ladyship, who (without
the least suspicion of
Flattery, I dare affirm
it) may justly be styled
the Beauty of Soci∣ety,
and Harmony of
Friendship; your Ci∣vility
being so great,

and Carriage so gaining,
that you are able to con∣vert
a Barbarian into
good manners, and make
a man of a reprobate
nature become a good
Christian. Your Example
I confess is easier to be
admired then imitated;
Your Precepts adequate
and proportionable to so
great a Pattern, and
those delivered to your
Friends and Servants
with such winning mild∣ness

and Concern, as if it
were your duty to be
more ingaged for the
welfare of our Souls and
good Names then we
ought to be our selves.
Madam, I need say no
more, but pray for you,
that God would multiply
upon you (who are both
Good and Great) and
upon yours all Temporal
and Eternal Blessings,
& increase the number of
such Excellent Saints as

is your Ladyship: Then
we should injoy a part of
Heaven out of Heaven,
while we had our beings
upon the Earth. I had
taken the freedome to
have named you by a
Title, you are more
known by, but that I
feared your so nice
and scrupulous Modesty
would have reprehended
me, disowning my cele∣bration
of this just Cha∣racter:
And should I

have given an account
of my own Name, it
would not be difficult
for very many to con∣jecture
to whom I pre∣sumed
to make this Ad∣dress. I am,
Madam,
