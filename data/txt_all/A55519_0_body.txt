DEAR NED,
AN Old Friend is the best Mecaenas, that makes me chuse you before any Poetical Lord or Esquire, and I believe this Reflection will prove too Me∣lancholy for the Town, where Men make it their Busi∣ness to forget Mortality. For these Reasons, I have sent this Poem to you in the Country, where much Leisure and an honest Retirement will permit you to enjoy the Me∣ditation. Nothing here goes off but Satyr, for our good natur'd Age, is mightily in love with a Muse that's born with Teeth, though such Births have always been e∣steem'd Ominous, and is very fond of Men that come in∣to the World, like Briers to scratch and tear all about them. I cannot deny but Obscenity has its good li∣king: But I should be very unwilling to make my Court that way, for I am much of the Spanish Ladys Mind, who dreaded to be delivered down to Posterity for a Whore, though to a King. You had not been troubled with this Poem in Print, if most of it had not been put out before in a Book of Miscellanies, but it was so blemished by the Press, that its ill usage moved the Compassion of Strangers, which encouraged me to rescue it from its Deformity, and to add a second Part. But after all, if it will divert you when you want a News-Letter or a Gazette, it is as much as is expected by
Dear Ned,
