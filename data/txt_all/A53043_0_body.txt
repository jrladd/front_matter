My Lord,
THese Papers take shel∣ter under Your great Name, to You they belong of Right as the nearest Relation.
The Person here spoke of was Your Dear Brother; You suffered

much in that Cause for which He was Slain, He was a Martyr, You was a Confessor; He fought upon Your Expense, Your Money raised his Regiment.
If I have fallen short (as needs I must) in the Description of so brave a Man, impute that to the Excel∣lency of the Subject, the best Faces of all others are the hardest to hit, to draw unto the Life.
If any ask, why I would offer to undertake this business? To them I answer, The last words of a Dying person (the Will is such) To me are Sacred, by no means to be neg∣lected.

I have but done my Duty, and though I fail in all points else, however I shall hope at least to gain this, Obsequii Gloriam, the praise of a Ready Obedience.
Knowing Your Lordships Good∣ness so very well, I am inclined to thinks, You will not refuse the First Fruits of his Pen, who subscribes himself in good earnest,

Southampton House, March 29. 1675.
