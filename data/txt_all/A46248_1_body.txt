GENTLE MEN,
ACcording to my Obligation and the Civility of Custom, I do once more Salute You with my faith∣ful Service in a brief display of your chargeable Tri∣umphs, which ye have Nobly undergone these Two Years without intermission, and is the Fourth time of Per∣formance since the Happy Restauration of His Sacred Majesty. In such Splendid actions, although some Diminution of your Treasure, they are, and will be plentifully recompensed in the Addition of your Fame, which when Time is five hundred years older will shine bright in the Eyes of Posterity, and prove a President for good men not only to Admire, but Imitate. In the interim, with many devout Wishes for your Advance∣ment and Duration, I assume the confidence of ho∣nouring my self with the honest title of
Gentlemen,
