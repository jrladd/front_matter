ALL the Learned (friende P. L.) agree with one voyce, that CHRIST our sa∣uiour was conceyued at the Sunnes en∣traunce into Aries, and borne vpon the shortest day, when the Sunne entred into Capricorne: wherefore to set Christmas vpon the shortest day, and draw the Ka∣lender backe in proportion thereunto, me thought, was very expedient: and the rather, because of all in generall, a reformation long tyme hath been desired and a fruition of the Feastes, vpon their ancient times. For consideryng that the immoueable Feastes ought to keepe the same dayes they vsed to do in euery Moneth before, it of necessitie followeth, that they must be kept at other tymes (in respect of the motions of the Sunne) then for many yeeres they haue done. As for Easter, and the moueable Feastes which folowe the course of the Moone, they were by Constant. magnus once corrected: but ig∣norance of obseruation in continuance of tyme hath bred great er∣rour sithens, in so much as many yeeres they misse their due tymes a moneth at least, and therefore of late haue had a seconde Refor∣mation: which although it be very truely performed for Easter, and it appendnces, yet the Monethes not reuocated to the true degrees of the Sunne, deserued a new annimaduersion. And there∣fore friende P. L. I haue not attempted this, as a newe fangle, and louer of ouelties (the which I haue alwayes hated) but as a fur∣therer of the trueth, which I alway haue loued,
