Right Honourable and Right Worshipful,
THat I here not only present you with these my weak Endea∣vours, for the vigorous Im∣provements of those unparal∣lel'd Advantages, which the situation of our Climate, the Nature of our Soil, and the Constitution of both our People and Govern∣ment affords us, in order to the making us every way great, beyond any Nation in the World; but have also at their peeping abroad into the severe
light, taken the boldness to seek their shelter un∣der the secure umbrage of your joint Protections: your own real worth, which has deservedly pur∣chased each of you such great Honour and Esteem in the Breasts of all the Nation, is the only Ar∣gument that I shall plead for this presumption, it being sufficient security for my Pardon.

whole study for many years, and which I now make publick meerly out of a real love to my Country, whose future flourishing is the only Reward I ever hope to see of all my Labours. Might I once but see our Titles to Lands and Houses secured, our Rivers made communicable, the Poor provided for by Bank Granaries, the Manufactures of the Land incouraged, and as the result of all our Trade upon the Increase; I should not doubt then in few years to see this Kingdom enricht above Ten Millions per An. which is but a moderate Account of what Profit must inevitably arise from a due Execution of these Reasonable Proposals. I have chalkt out the Way, and given a fair Prospect of the whole, and I hope clearly Evidenced that it is all feasi∣ble, and matter of Fact. That God may there∣fore give his blessing on your Pious Endeavours, for the promotion of so Glorious a Work, as it is the unanimous Prayer of the Nation in Gene∣ral, it is also, and always shall be, the humble Petition of
