NOr let my paines herein (long honor'd Lord)
Faile of your ancient Nobly-good respects;
Though obscure Fortune neuer would afford
My seruice show, till these thus late effects.
And though my poore deserts weigh'd neuer more
Then might keepe downe their worthlesse memorie
From your high thoughts (enricht with better store)
Yet yours, in me, are fixt eternally;
VVhich all my fit occasions well shall proue.
Meane space (with your most Noble Nephewes) daine
To shew your free and honorable loue
To this Greeke Poet, in his English vaine.
You cannot more the point of death controule;
Then to stand close by such a liuing soule.
