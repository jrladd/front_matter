DRead SOVERAIGNE:
NOw after your Majesties most happie Returne to your Kingdome, your poore Subject hath nothing to present to Your MAIESTY (save onely in testimony of my loyaltie to your Grace

and true affection which I bore to him which was made so like his Lord and Master) But onely a few Obser∣vations collected out of holy Scripture Prophetically, and by Vision layd downe therein; (which hath been hid since the world began) But now most dreadfully Acted in your dayes; the which Observations I drew up in the yeare 1654. and reading it over to two espe∣ciall Friends and Royalists Mr. BRYAN NEL∣SGN, and Mr. WIL: EDVVARDS of Nor∣wich., By their perswasion and mine owne Inclination, I resolved to put them in Print, and with a Resolution to send your Grace a Copie thereof. But considering that in the last Chapter of Daniel, the Angell commands him to goe his way. Seeing the words are closed and Sealed till the time of the end; In Obedience there∣unto I have reserved it till this present; But most gracious Prince, I humbly Beg of Your MAIESTY so much time as to Read it over, and your Majesties pardon in that I cannot give (that is Eloquence with wisdome of words most proper for such a Propheticall subject and due to such a Prince; But that which is your Majesties due (and can give) I present to Your Grace, that is my Service together with this unbur∣nished Piece; proceeding from a man of little Lear∣ning, yet from a true and faithfull heart; and where∣as

I have been loyall and alwayes ayding to him whose fame is made glorious without clogging my Conscience with Protestations, Covenants. Judgments, or Oathes of any kind, which brought utter Ruine upon my estate, and great affliction upon me, my Wife and Children; Yet I chused rather in my allegiance to expose my selfe to any sufferings, the same I shall be to Your Grace till (by Gods ayd) I shall finish my Course.
