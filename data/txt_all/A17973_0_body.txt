Most Gracious and Dread Soueraigne,
SVch Princes as are ray∣sed by God for some great and good seruice, are many times incub∣red with great troubles, that they may be tried. Of this your Mtie hath had experience. For besides the great perils out of which God hath deliuered you, and brought you home in safetie to the ioy of all your faithfull

subiects: two other great dangers haue assailed your kingdome of late, the Plague and the Pelagian heresie, the one destroying bodies, the other soules. This latter hath bene creeping in cor∣ners heretofore, but of late hath come in more publique shew, then euer be∣fore, and dedicated to your Mtie, in a booke intituled An Appeale to Caesar, wherein the Author hath with confi∣dence deliuered the doctrines of the Pe∣lagians and Arminians for the doctrines of the Church of England. By this our dangers grow great and come neere vs. When the Church is in danger, to whō may we flie vnto for helpe next vnder God, but only to your Mtie, whom God hath set a nursing father of his Church here. Of necessity these things must be brought to your Maties knowledge, whose godly care is, that this Church

which hath thus long prospered and flourished, by the blessing of the Al∣mighty, and the fauor of godly & gra∣cious princes, may not loose that honor vnder so good & gracious a king, which it hath held vnder your noble predeces∣sors. I wil not say, defende me gladio, but defend the truth & faith, whereof God hath made you the Defender, and God, who only is able, will not faile to defend you. I end with that propheticall pro∣mise, which I beseech the God of heauē to make good to your Mtie. No weapōs that are made against thee shall prosper,Esa 54.17. and euery tongue that shall rise against thee in iudgement, thou shalt condemne: this is the heritage of the Lords seruants, and their righteousnesse is of me, saith the Lord.
