RIGHT Worshipfull, I craue your patronage and pardon both at once. I haue stolne from my daily duetie vnto you, vnto whom I owe both my selfe and all duetie, cer∣taine waste houres which I haue imployed a∣bout this discourse. If my paines haue been fruitfullie bestowed, yet they must craue par∣don, because they were bestowed without your leaue; if idlie, then I must craue pardon twise, once for them, and next for my selfe. Howsoe∣uer, I am sure my best desert must pleade par∣don, which I most humbly beg at your hands; submitting my selfe, and thaese stolne medita∣tions to your milde censures. Which if I finde fauourable, I shall be encouraged with more

alacritie to applie my studies in my ordinarie duties, and with better content as well to a∣mend what you shall finde amisse in this, as also to prepare my selfe to some greater taske. And so with my dailie prayers to almightie God for the happie and flourishing estate of your Honourable societie, I humbly take my leaue. At my chamber in Grayes Inne this 24. of Nouember. 1599.
Your daily bounden Orator,
ROGER FENTON.
