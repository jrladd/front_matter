THoughts, fight no more, but now (with Wits ac∣cord)
Yeeld al obedience to Arts rightest rule;
Then, like a constant treble-twisted cord,
Binde vp the sweet'st affections of my Soule,
And, in a Poesy giue them to, O no,
They are too base for such high Excellence!
Yet (prostrate) giue them to him, and say so;
So, I may shunne dislike, you, insolence:
Great (ó too narrow is this name for thee)
King, (yet too straite a stile for thy great worth)
And Monarch, (this with it doth best agree)
Deigne to accept a Base, base Wit brought forth:
And base it is (great Highnesse) in each line,
Because indeede it is too rightly mine.
