THe eye can
judge of no ob∣ject
in the darke:
en so these Pictures
eing hidden in tene∣is,
could not be dis∣rned,
untill the Prin∣r
brought them to

light, and set the
forth to the view
the world. And the∣fore
as they lived
darknesse, and proc∣ded
from a minde 
of darke thoughts,
have given them
darke Dedication
since for my self
I desire to bee ignot
unknowne to other
and for you to who
I present them, I kno
no fame can redou
unto you by the

eane Essayes, which
ere written Ocium
agis foventes, quàm stu∣entes
gloriae, as Sheap∣eards
play upon their
aten pipes, to recre∣te
themselves, not to
get credit. However▪
 you finde hereafter
hat these Pictures are
ot shadowed forth
with those lively and
exact Lineaments,
which are required in
a Character, yet I hope
you will pardon the
Painter, since all I pro∣mise
is onely this: Vt
cum agis nihil, haec legas
& ne nihil agas, defendas;
That when you have
nothing to doe, if you
reade them, they will
keepe you from doing
nothing. And so I leave
them as a testimony of
my love, presuming of
your kind acceptation.
