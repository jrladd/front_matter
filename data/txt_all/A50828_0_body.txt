May it please Your Royal Highness,
THE Liberty I take to offer You this Work is not out of Presum∣ption. It is a Debt I come to pay, an Homage I come to render to Your ROYAL HIGHNESS. 'Tis Your R.H. has occasion'd it, upon the News of your happy Mar∣riage with the Princess. Which
has diffused so great a Joy through the whole Nation, that it had certainly broke out into Extraordinary and Pub∣lick Demonstrations, at any other Conjuncture. How∣ever, it has created a Desire to know the estate of a King∣dom, which has given us so Illustrious a Prince by his Birth, so famous for his Cou∣rage, and so Amiable by that Sweetness of Disposition which has already gained him so many Hearts in this Realm. Therefore, to satisfy the Publick, I have underta∣ken this short Description of the State of Denmark; in
writing of which, I had the advantage of speaking well of Denmark, without having need to flatter. And I am per∣swaded, it will be so much the more Acceptable to Your ROYAL HIGHNESS, and the Publick. If it shall have the Fortune to please, 'twill be no small Satisfaction to me, and I should think my self very hap∣py to have done Something that had the Honour to be approved by so great a Prince. For whom my Prayers to Heaven shall be, to pour down its most benign Influ∣ences upon Your ROYAL HIGHNESS, to crown your
Marriage with a glorious Off∣spring, that this happy Alli∣ance may prove an eternal Bond of Amity between the two Kingdoms of England and Denmark, and that Your ROYAL HIGHNESS may all the days of your Life be the Delight of your Friends and Terrour of your Enemies. I humbly beg of Y. R. H. to accept of these Marks of the Zeal I have for your Service, and to believe that none can be with more Veneration than I am
