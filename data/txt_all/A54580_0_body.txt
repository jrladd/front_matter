MY LORD,
FOR one who is sensible how little he knows of things past or
present, to Dedicate a Discourse of the future State of his
Country to your Lordship, who are by the Age allow'd to be
as Critical a Iudge of Men and Things as any it affords, may
seem to have in it somewhat of Presumption. But when
your Lordship shall have had leisure to consider the plain
Grounds of Nature, on which my Prediction in the following
Papers hath gone, I will not so much hope that what I have attempted may
appear to have been no Presuming, as I will expect that your Censure will
cast the Presumption on the other side, namely, on such who were Predictors
with a continuando, of the Unhappy State of their Country; and especially
on the account of the Religion of our most Gracious Prince. And were I now
to have my Iudgment tryed only by that of the Mobile, who measure all things
by the Events, I account I should be out of the Gunshot of Censure, since the
course of Providence after my writing of the following Work having Con∣ducted
His Majesty to fill the Throne of his Ancestors with so many Royal
Virtues, it has been Conspicuous to them that the Glories of his Reign
have transcended the highest flights of my mentioned Expectation.
And indeed, as I remember to have long ago heard one of the Fathers cited
for a Passage to this purpose, namely, that on a Supposal that God recounting to
him the Perfections of the Creation, should ask him what he could name want∣ing,
and that he could wish, he would answer, Unum Laudatorem, Domine,
so it might till of late be said that in this new Creation or Restoration of Eng∣land
under His Majesty's Reign, the only thing we had with anxiety to wish
and desire from God next to the ennabling us to Praise his divine Goodness,
was one whose Talent of noble thoughts and words might be adequate to the
celebrating the many Talents of our Prince, and their successful Improvement
both for the Honour and Security, and Ease of his People.
But neither is such one Praiser now wanting; for he who shall read the
many late Loyal Addresses from all Parts of the Kingdom, will find the People
of England to be the Unus Laudator.

My Lord, as I in the following Discourse almost wholly Printed long ago in
the last Reign during the freedom of the Press, adventured on Grounds of Na∣ture
to predict such a growth of Loyalty, as would make all England become
one sober Party of Mankind, and that the more ingenious sort of Iesuits
would by natural Instinct throw off those Principles condemned in this Pope's
Decree; and with Iustice then acknowledged a Sober Party in that order, and
have at large in p. 322. particularly shew'd my Abhorrence of charging the
belief or practice of those Principles on all Persons in that Order: So I have
likewise in p. 238. given my Iudgment that all Seditious Principles own'd
by any who call'd themselves Protestants must naturally decay, and have at
large in my Preface▪ opposed my measures of futurity to those of a late Fa∣ther
of the Church of England concerning the two Plots, that he thought the
Papists and Dissenters would be ever carrying on, and without his Lordships
excepting the Loyal in those religionary Parties.
But having said this, I must likewise say that these happy births of Fate,
having been but (as it were) the Births of a Day under the Powerful Influ∣ences
of His Majesty's Government, or (as I may say) a Nation's being thus
born in a Day, are beyond what I did expect: and I did little think that
with the suddenness of the motion of Lightning when it melts the Sword and
spares the Scabbard, His Majesty's Declaration of Indulgence to Dissenters,
would at the same time melt so many hearts, and all hostile Principles of the
Doctrine of Resistance wrapp'd therein, as it spared the Persons of the deluded
Opiners. I account that any indifferent Observer of the extraordinary sweet∣ness
of the way of painting their Loyalty in their Addresses (and which re∣sembleth
the way of Corregio, and is as excellent in its kind as that of the
Sons of the Church of England after the way of the bolder touches of Titian
in their former Addresses, with the Style of LIVES AND FORTUNES was
in its) must be very hard-hearted if he likewise be not melted into a new kind
of Compassion toward such his Brethren; and into a noble sense of a great and
good Prince, having made his Subjects of all Religionary Perswasions Lachry∣mists
for Joy, and turned all their hearts to invoke Heaven in wishing for him
according to that old Style, a long Life, a secure Kingdom, a safe House,
valiant Armies, a faithful Senate, loyal Subjects, the world at Peace, &c.
The comparatively narrow Idea's of Charity and Beneficence that Subjects
Minds are capable of toward one another do incline them to think chiefly of
particular Toleration, and such as we call Dispensation, and that too with the
nicety of Caution, and upon Persons making the notification of their Princi∣ples,
and their particular disclaiming of all Disloyal ones, previous to their
Toleration; and beyond this pitch the flights of my poor thoughts have not
gone in the following Work. But His Majesty having his Great thoughts in∣tent
on restoring England to its ancient Figure in the World, namely of ba∣lancing
it, and coming to the Throne when he found the Land so impoverish'd
y the Witnesses Plot, and the spirits of the Inhabitants so much intimidated
with Fears and Iealousies, he by his own noble Iealousie for the Honour of the
Nation hath chased away all ignoble Iealousies for ever, and by shewing so
great an Example of Universal Confidence in his People, hath by his Augus
Genius found out so expedite a way to make the Confidence between the Prince
and People mutual (and which is the hinge on which the Happy State of any
Country turns) as hath made any general Relapses into Principles of disloy∣alty
during his Reign, almost morally impossible. For according to that Saying
of Tully, Perditissimi est hominis eum laedere qui laesus non esset, nisi re∣didisset,
and the Common Notion that next to the being perfectly good, it is
the most difficult thing to bring Humane Nature to be perfectly bad,
we may well expct a general growth of Loyalty from the Effects of that

great Confidence, and the great Spectacle it affords the World, that may
be partly expressed in the words of the Prophet, viz. The heart of the
Father's being turned to the Children, and the natural Consequence of the
turning the heart of the Children to their Father; a more noble work then
for an Elias to come and solve Doubts.
And thus while the Principles of some narrow-hearted Divines might
seem confined, like the Sands in their Hour-glasses, yet His Majesty's
great Thoughts and largeness of heart given him by God, being (as was said
of Solomon's) like the Sands of the Sea shoar, and he having without setting
up Weigh-houses for Loyalty or Religionary Principles, created universal Cha∣rity
and Peace in the Nation, and allow'd his Subjects a paulò majora ca∣namus
then verbal Recantations, he by thus trusting his Subjects at once with
their Consciences, hath provided an otherguess Prospect for English Minds,
then what can rise from disputacity, or the Ecclesiarum Scabies, and
hath likewise secured the transmitting of his Character into the English Chro∣nicles
with such Rays of Glory as are brighter then those that have there
adorn'd our former Princes, under whom the Roses, and Scepters and King∣doms
were united, through his having so much united the hearts of People of
all Religions to himself, and to one another.
My Lord, It is here but just that I should acknowledge it to your Lordship
that you have been and are Pars Magna in so highly Contributing by your
great Figure at the Helm in the last and this present Reign, to this happy
State of England. For while in that Reign so many were so intent by what
an ingenious late Writer calls The Wheel within a Wheel, i. e. the Real Plot
within the Nominal one of the Witnesses; and by Out-cries against the
Church of Rome to bring in a Roman Republick, your Lordship by your most
wise Councels and indefatigable diligence in guarding the Monarchy, and
effecting that it should not be plotted away by Names or Things, will appear
in the History of the Age, as one who perhaps beyond any one now a Subject
secured the old Fundamental Government of England, and upon which only the
new future Happiness of it could subsist.
I have entertain'd the Reader with a new Argument of Republicks gene∣rally
growing more impracticable: but I shall do but justice to your Lordship in
representing your very Character as an Argument of sufficient weight to
poise the minds of the ingenious and the ingenuous against innovations by
that sort of Government. For the World would soon want the benefit of the
Example of the perfect justice inherent in your nature (that glorious Virtue
that is the allow'd Continent of all the rest, and necessarily attracting the
Eyes and Hearts and Veneration of the Populace) if Heaven had not fix'd
you in the Sphere of Monarchy; a dull Mediocrity of Vertue and of Wit and
reason being only easie to a popular Government, and nothing but an Oyster-Shell
or an Olive-Leaf being to be there expected by a Person heroically just
to his Country as his recompence, and his being always liable to such liberae
accusationes & Calumniationes as were under what I have call'd the
Martyrocracy here in the turbid Interval of the Plot-times, and of the Fears
and Iealousies.
Your Lordship was then by the help of your great Vnderstanding and ex∣cellent
Temper, and your constant Serenity of thought, saevis tranquillus in
undis; and while so many of the timid were with their narrow spirits in
that stormy Conjuncture, toss'd about with excessive Fears and Iealousies,
and nauseous to themselves and others, your Lordships great thoughts like a
well built first Rate-Ship, allow'd you both Ease and Triumph on the Sea of
Time: and in the Night of the Popular Fears, your great Reason was dire∣ctive
to the Loyal tanquam lucerna in navi Praetoriâ how and where to steer
their Course with safety to the Publick.

While toward the End of the following Discourse, I recollected how much
and how far my belief had been with that of many Loyal embarqued in the
belief of a Plot or the Plot, I there in p. 359, and 360. took notice that
the Notions that men had of a Plot were very various: Some then were
so far gone in credulity, as like the Fool that Solomon saith believeth eve∣ry
word, they were resolv'd to believe every thing the Witnesses had said
or would say, the Loyal generally acquiesced in the Notification of it as
Publish'd by the Government; and I likewise call'd to mind what I had
during my belief of somewhat of it mention'd in those hot Times, and while.
I was writing the warmest part of my Discourse in that Conjuncture, and
when generally every heat of mens Passions was Feverish, and every Fe∣ver
Pestilential, and when the Vitium temporis was Concurrent with the
Faults of the Writer: and there in p. 14. observing, that since according to
the expression of God's not being the God of the Jews only, but also of
the Gentiles, so it being true that the King is King of the Papists as well as
Protestants, King of the Irish as well as English, and a Common Father to
them all, it may be worthy of his royal goodness, and a god-like thing
in him to distribute to them all the kindness that would not undo them∣selves
and others, (i. e. that they were capable of) and having then in
p. 44. urged the possibility of Recusants being a sound part of the State here
as well as in Holland, I held my self obliged to do them and the Course of my
Impartial observing, the right as toward the end of the Discourse to men∣tion
it, that whatever petulance some of them were formerly guilty of,
yet that the deportment of the generality of them hath of late appear'd
with such a Face of Loyalty, as was necessarily attractive of our Christian
Love and Compassion. And I concluded with the Observation, That it was
not for nothing, nor without some end that Divine Providence permitted so
many Protestants to erre in one great Point; and that probably it might
be to the end to produce in their Minds so great a degree of Compassion
and Charity toward the Persons of all Roman-Catholick Christians, as
may not only last in this Conjuncture, but be operative in them by all Moral
Offices of Humanity and Christianity during their Lives.
But the Course of Providence having further honoured His Majesty's Go∣vernment
by bringing to light in it the Truth about those odious Matters that
particular Roman-Catholicks were charged with, (and for which in the general
Iudgment of the Impartial they appear now to have been put to Death by false
Testimony) the cry of such Blood may well (I think) pass for a loud Call
against making the Body of the Roman-Catholicks uneasie by the Penal Laws,
and while the Reason for their Severity hath so apparently ceased.
As toward the latter end of the Preface which was committed to Writing in
the latter end of the last Reign, I mention'd it as the Concordant vogue of the
Populace to throw off the belief of the only Person referr'd to as a witness in
the following Discourse, so it must be acknowledged that Time hath by its
births of Discovery, now given a just occasion for the laying aside all the Ag∣gravations
there against any Principles in the Canon-Law, or the Casuistical
Morals of the Iesuits, that my self and others then built on the Fate of
Godfrey: and hath acording to what I have predicted concerning the Fate
of the Principles of the Iesuites Condemned by this Pope, tacitly evaporating
by Fear and Shame, made them appear obsolete. And it is one of the Glories
of His Majesty's Reign, that all those Principles in terrorem, which gave
occasion formerly for the Continuance of the Laws in terrorem, do now appear
offer'd up as Sacrifices to the Iustice of it. And tho from the account I found in
The Policy of the Clergy of France of the Fact of some of the Iesuits having
opposed the Publication of that Decree in France, as having issued from the Pope

in his Court of Inquisition, I took occasion to dilate on the Aggravations of their
Disobedience to the Pope, yet upon my having since enquired into the Transa∣ctions
of the Papal World, I have found Cause to absolve them from any Cen∣sure
of that kind.
And accordingly as the Ingenious Dr. Donne in his Pseudo-Martyr saith,
that Chrysostom expounding that place in Jeremy, Domus Dei facta est spe∣lunca
Hyaenae, applies it to the Priests of the Iews as hardest to be conver∣ted,
and saith, That the Hyaena having (as Chrysostom observes) but one
Back-bone, cannot turn except it turn all at once, so that the Romanist
Priests having but one Back-bone, the Pope, cannot turn but all at once
when he turns; it must be acknowledged that the Pope having by that his
noble Decree done so much right to his own Honour, and that of his Church
(and indeed of Humane nature) as to damn those tenets, the aversion of the
whole Order of the Iesuites from them was necessarily and naturally to
happen.
And from the Doctor in that Book applying further to the Iesuites, say∣ing,
Christ said to those whom he sent, what I tell you in darkness, that
speak you in light, and what you hear in the Ear, that preach you in
Houses, and fear not them that kill the Body; and if no other thing were
told you in darkness, and whispered in your Ears at your missions hither
then that which our Saviour delivered to them, you might be as confident
in your publick preaching, and have as much comfort of Martyrdom, if
you died for executing such a Commission, and then reflecting on the instru∣ctions
that were delivered them in darkness in that Conjuncture, for the pro∣moting
those Papal Vsurpations on the Regal Rights, whereby they were deli∣vered
from all subjection to the King; it may be here occasionally observed that
many persons of our several Religionary Perswasions having for Curiosity gone
to hear the publick Preaching of these Missionaries, have there met with such
ingenuous Explications of the Moral Offices that concern the most Vital parts of
Religion, and those so pathetically applied, as that they have looked on
such men who were formerly dead in Law, to be as it were sent from the dead
to make others better Christians and better Subjects, and to be thankful for
the Dispensative Power animating those for that purpose, and have found no
Cause to fear that they had any Politick whispers in their Missions to oppose the
Power of our Monarch more then their Brethren do that of the Great Neigh∣bouring
one, and to whom in the litis-pendentia between him and the Pope
about the Regale, they adhered.
My Lord, as to what I adventured to predict of the success of his Majesties
Political Measures, his past Prudence so eminently appearing in the Series of
his Great Actions might sufficiently encourage me without any help from Enthu∣siasme;
for Nullum numen abest, si sit prudentia. And the Supposal about
his coming to the Throne in great maturity of years, a thing that the prudence
of the Romans had strict regard to in the Age of their Consuls (and for
which Office none was qualified under the Age of 43 years) and his bringing
to the Throne a vast Treasure of Knowledge and Experience refin'd and solid
by many Experiments of Providence on himself, according to the Divine
words of Seneca de provid. Deus quos amat, indurat, recognoscit, exercet,
might well raise the highest expectation of his Conduct.
But yet neither was I without some regard therein to the common Course of
Divine Providence, even in this Life rewarding in any Illustrious Person a sig∣nal
tenderness for Religion, and inquisitiveness in any Controverted Point
about it, and at last contrary to the most valuable secular Interest determining
his thoughts one way tho perhaps erroneously; and I will venture to conclude
that if it had imported the salvation of such an exemplary inquisitive honourer

of God (and who with great holy Exercise had defecated his thoughts from set∣tlement
on any local Religion, as such) to have found out the truth in that
Problematick Point, God would have honoured him so far as to have sent an
Angel to direct him to it: and will expect that such a one whose delight was in
the Law of the Lord and therein did meditate day and night, tho he per∣haps
comprehended not every thing aright in it, yet that he shall be like a
Tree planted by the Rivers of Water, that brings forth his fruit in his Sea∣son,
and that his Leaf shall not wither, and that whatever he doth shall
prosper: and that his ways thus, pleasing God, he will make even his Ene∣mies
to be at peace with him, and that he who makes peace in his high
places, and who can make peace between high and low, and makes men to
be of one mind in an House, will bless him with these Effects, and make him
grow in favour with God and Man.
My Lord, I shall in the next place take occasion to acquaint your Lordship that
in the Preface (and which every Candid Reader of any Book will peruse before
his reading of the Book) I do explain my self more clearly about some things and
words writt in the turbid times, and which as one saith well, are the worst times
to write in tho the best to write of: and I do not fear the wanting any mans par∣don
who shall read over the whole, and which may well be expected before the al∣lowance
of his Exceptions, tho it may seem as copious as one of the Bankers Bills
in Chancery. But because the former part of the Discourse necessarily requiring
those courser Colours relating to Popery to be first laid on, before the finr ones
and the gilding on the happy Future State of our Country; and for that to trou∣ble
any ingenious men now with Notions of Popery were to hinder their repose in
the state I foretold, I have been at the pains of making a large INDEX, and where
I have directed the Reader how and where to enter into the New Heaven and
New Earth of his Country, without passing through the Purgatory of any expressi∣ons
about Popery or the Plot: and perhaps the more Loyal and Ingenious Recu∣sants
whether Roman-Catholick or Protestants there taking notice of some grate∣ful
passages relating to some who were formerly of their perswasions being placed
near others that are less so, may be the more pleased therewith, accordingly
as my Lord Bacon observes, that a Rose set by Garlick is the sweeter.
Heaven having furnished your Lordships mind with so many Excellencies
that are extraordinary, I could wish that it had been my ability or fortune to
have here provided for your Entertainment somewhat of value that was not
vulgar. But my essaying, or offering here and there at some matter of thought
which by receiving its Form from your Lordships great reason, and particularly
in p. 158. and the following ones in my making it a Fundamental Principle for
the quiet of the World, that men are neither to get nor lose by Religion,
and my distinguishing in mens Hypotheses between their Principles denominable
as Religionary, and such Complicated therewith that are not so, and my ha∣ving
judged that none ought to be severe to any Recusant before he hath a
Moral Certainty of such person having imbibed any of the Principles impu∣table
to Recusancy that are irreligionary and unnatural, and my defiance of
the petulance of the Faction by my placing Lawrels on those Heads at which
it was throwing dirt, and my shewing how not only Christians of the Roman-Catholick
Church in its great spreading Latitude, but even those of the more
particular Church of Rome, and reverers of the Diocess or Court of Rome,
are under no obligation by the LATERAN Councel to be either Persecu∣tors
or disloyal, may shew somewhat of my honest well wishes in this kind.
I am not so van as to think that any thing relating to Numbers or Political
Calculations in the Discourse can appear new to your Lordship, who are so
great a Master in that kind of Knowledge, that the most Curious of the Age
may therein beg instruction from you. But I shall here presume to acquaint your

Lordship, that I observing that many in the late Conjuncture whom I looked on
as honest, loyal, and learned and ingenious men, and some who had formerly
a gusto for the real Learning that refers to number, weight and measure, did ren∣der
their Conversation so uneasie by talking of nothing but Popery, Popery (and
which I looked on as unentertaining and nauseous as the Porke, porke & porke)
I thought it might be publickly useful to lay open a new Scene of Thought before
such Persons by shewing them some Calculations relating to the numbers of the
People of England, founded on somewhat like Records, and some to its gradual en∣crease
in Trade as well as populousness, and others relating to other parts of
the World, whereby their Souls having somewhat like a new intellectual World
before them to expatiate in, might no longer be confined to a perplext
word.
Yet moreover considering how lately it was that they came out of that Con∣juncture
of Panic fears, when so many who went to Bed without their Brains
were afraid of rising without their Heads, and that as our English World was
emerging out of the late general DELUGE of Fears and Iealousies where
omnia pontus erant, &c. the Curious beheld the several births of Mens
Reasons attended with Imperfections like those of the Animals referr'd to;
—& in his quaedam modo caepta per ipsum,
Nascendi spatium, quaedam imperfecta, suisque
Trunca vident humeris: & eodem corpore saepe
Altera pars vivit, rudis est pars altera tellus;
and thus saw the spectacles of mens various Vnderstandings gradually creeping
into sense and reason, and not suddenly likely to be perfected: I shew'd so
much Complaisance to them, as in stead of hastily removing their Thoughts
from the Course soil of Popery or the old Papal Vsurpations, to build my
Fabricks of Numbers and Calculations upon it: and I may say, that finding
their vitiated Fancies rellish'd nothing at that time grateful but the thoughts
about Popery, I then chose to make that the Vehicle of the Notions I meant
as Physick for their Cure.
According to the way of judging of the Draught and Proportion in perspe∣ctive
Painting by their respect to the Eye being directed to the Center there∣in,
any ordinary Reader's judgment will be carry'd by the Index to find what
was principally aim'd at in the following Discourse, namely to incline him to
preserve the haereditary Monarchy. And he will there find that my next aim to
that was in a great part of the Work to dispose those who formerly had been
diffident of their Prince, to Promote the Public Supplies for the necessary
Support of the Government. And my judging that our most eminent Patriots
would be inclined to value themselves as such, on the promoting the same,
may to some appear as the most sanguine part of my Predictions. But as I
leave it to any indifferent man to judge of the grounds of Nature I went on in
so doing, so I may some way support the Credit of my measures of futurity in
that Affair by the past event of the Loyal Confidence in His Majesty shewn
by his late Parliament in their proceeding so far as they did in Supporting the
Government; and may add that His Majesty's vast Expences that have been
since so Conspicuous to the World in his Naval Preparations, and otherwise in
the Providing for the Security and Honour of the Nation, may well incline any
one else to judge well of such Patriotly temper of any future Parliament, and
to allow of the Reasons by me urged as more Cogent for the present Reign then
the former, considering the Preparations of our Neighbors that have been
since augmented.
Yet however, I doubt not but that if it had been Gods will further to have
lengthen'd the last reign, the Course of Nature would then have operated as I

have mention'd. And if it shall appear that those natural Considerations▪ I have ur∣ged
shall have the success of such further Parliamentary Supplies to His gracious
Majesty, as may tend to the further greatning of his Character and that of the
Kingdom, I shall account my claim the more equitable to have the pardon of my
fellow Subjects of what Religionary Sect soever for any thing in this Discourse
that may disgust them. And, as an eminent Protestant Divine hath in a Printed
Sermon thus said, viz. that man is not worthy to breathe in so good a Land
as England is, who would not willingly lay down his life to cure the pre∣sent
divisions and distractions that are among us, I shall say that any Subject
deserves not to live here under the Indulgence of so good a Prince, who for
the helping him to money by all due means for the defence of this good Land,
would not wish himself as well as his Bigottry a Sacrifice; and who would
not as to any Extravagant dash of a Pen lighting on his Party, and bringing Mo∣ney
to his Prince, cry foelix peccatum, rather then such Divisions and Di∣stractions
and Diffidences of the Government, and stifling of Publick Supplies
should still live as were formerly known in some Conjunctures, and when the Art
of Demagogues appear'd so spightful in endeavours to frustrate the Meetings of
Parliaments.
But our Prince having freed all his dissenting Subjects from their uneasi∣ness
under Pecuniary Mulcts for Religion, and the Members of the Church of
England from the uneasiness of imposing such Soul-Money, will, I doubt not,
when he shall please to Call a Parliament, find from them such necessary Sup∣plies
for the support of the Body of the Kingdom, as may ease him under the
weight of his great Desires for it: and that it will then appear to all as absurd
to Crown such a Head with Thorns as hath taken the Thorn out of
every man's foot in England: and that his pass'd Sufferings for his Con∣science
(and others of his Communion having too suffer'd for his Conscience)
bespeaking us in those words of the Apostle, Fulfil ye my joy; that both his
and theirs will be then Consummated, and as the Ioy of those of the Church of
England, and of all nominal Churches in England hath been fulfill'd by him:
and that as Luther was pleas'd in a Christian-like transport of good Nature to
Profess in his Epistle to Jeselius a Iew, Me propter Unum Judaeum Cruci∣fixum
omnibus favere Judaeis, we shall for the sake of one of the Roman-Catholick
Communion, who hath formerly suffer'd so much for his Conscience,
and since done so much for the freedom of ours, shew all those of that Com∣munion
our favour to such a proportion as may compleat his and their Ioy.
My Lord, I am here obliged to acknowledge, that tho while the several
Parts of the following Work were written in the times the Government
charged both Papists and Anti-Papists with Disloyalty and Plots, I express'd
my sense of the Non-advisableness to have the Penal Laws against them re∣peal'd,
pending such Charge and Plots; I desire the Reader to look on
me as very far from insisting on any thing of that nature in this Happy
State of England, now that the Corner Stone (and that some of the Buil∣ders
rejected) hath thus successfully united the sides of the Fabrick of the
Government in Loyalty.
My Lord, It is near a year since I writ my Thoughts at large concerning
the Subject of the Repealing those Laws, and they are in the Fourth Part of
my Work about The Dispensative Power (of which the two first Parts con∣clude
this Volume) ready for the Press; and reserving my poor Iudgment in
this great Point till the Publication of the whole, I think I shall then set
forth my Opinion as founded on Medium's that have not appear'd in Print from
other Writers, and which I believe will not only not give offence to any Mem∣ber
of the Church of England, but be of general use in allaying the ferment
the Question hath occasion'd.

And if as they who were long fellow-Passengers in a Ship among violent
Tempests and Hirricanes, do usually from their being Participants together
in the danger and horror, take occasion to raise a friendly esteem and well∣wishes
for each other, such of the Loyal whose belief I referr'd to, as im∣barqued
with mine in that of the Plot during the late Stormy Conjuncture,
shall be the more favourable to what I write, I shall be glad both for their
sakes as well as mine; but do further judge that what I have so largely
in the following Discourse asserted (and by Reasons taken from Nature)
concerning the Moral impossibility of the belief of the Tenets of the Church
of Rome gaining ground here considerably, on the belief of the Doctrine
of the Church of England, will tend to secure any one from fears of our
losing our Religion by any loss of the Test that may happen: a thing that
none (I think) will fear, who are of the Iudgment of the House of Commons
in their Address to the late King on the 29th of November, 1680. (that I
have referr'd to in my Fourth Part) and where they say, that POPERY
hath rather gain'd then lost Ground since the TEST ACT, and make
that Act to have had little effect. I have in the following Discourse referr'd
to that Act as represented to have had its rice in the year 1673. from the
alledged petulant Insolence of Papists in that Conjuncture, and I took notice
of a learned Lord since deceas'd as vouching somewhat in Print of such tem∣per
among some of them. And a Proclamation that year charging the Pa∣pists
therewith, I was implicitly guided thereby to take the thing for gran∣ted,
and as to the which, considering since the publick Passages in that Con∣juncture,
I have otherwise judged. But as I think no loyal Roman-Catholick
should in that Conjuncture have suffer'd any Prejudice for any ill Behaviour
of any other of that Communion then, much less ought any such thing be
now; and when there appears so noble and general a spirit of Emulation
among all men of sense in the Diffusive Body of the People about who shall
make the Head and all Members of that Body most easie: and for the doing
which we may well hope that the People representative, and the other Estates
of the Realm will come with all due Preparation of Mind, when it shall please
His Gracious Majesty to assemble them.
My Lord, I have nothing further to add but my begging your Lord∣ship's
Pardon for this trouble, and my owning the many Obligations I am
under to be,
My Lord,
