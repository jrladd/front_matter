RIGHT HONORABLE,
'Tis a principle of Nature, that Crea∣tures
of weake condition, aiming at security, doe
direct their course for shelter, to the wings of the
more potent, so Principalities and states of infe∣rior
note, doe manifest their sollicitude, to gaine
the patronage of some Royall Majestie: This little
worke by reason of its meanes, dares not adven∣ture
to be exposed to the publique censure, unlesse
it be protected under the Scepter of Honorable
Authority; and whether shall it betake it selfe, if
not to your Honour, whom God hath established
on Earth, as a particular image of his glory: assu∣redly
the rayes of honor originally issuing from
your countenance, the generall esteeme of your
unparaleld worth, and your matchlesse zeale and
Christian fortitude in your waighty underta∣kings,
are no lesse arguments of your incompa∣rable
merit, then incentives to the learned, to a∣dorne
their Chronicles with the lustre of your de∣serts;
The subject of this small worke being drawn



from the historicall records of Forren countryes,
and fitly applyable to the distempers of this king∣dome,
may the rather be admitted to the favour
of your noble patronage, forasmuch as your Ho∣nour
out of the generosity of your nature, have
been pleased with a glance of reall compassion to
view and survey the modell of its sad afflictions,
having with unspeakable toyle, charges, and dan∣gers
adventured hither (not unlike to NOAH'S
Dove, with an Olive branche of Peace) to appease
the raging fury of our intestine harmes; This en∣riching
the Diademe of your renown with a parti∣cular
Iewell of rare merit, are not these issues and
ofspring of a boyling & bleeding heart, boyling
with impregnable love and loyaltie unto his Ma∣jestie,
and bleeding for the continuall distempers
of his kingdomes. Pardon then Right Honorable
the Authors presumption, who making humble
remonstrance of his reall observance & duest res∣pects,
builds not upon the worth of this subject,
but wholly relies on the favour of your noble ac∣ceptance,
assuring himselfe, the characters of your
name engraven upon its frontispice will not only
impart a particular lustre unto it, but will (more∣over)
yeeld it accaptable to all readers: Why then,
as the glittering beames of your unspotted loyal∣tie
(true effects of a generous heart) have given a



full reflection on the darke brow of this distracted
age, so posteritie hereafter may blesse, praise, and
admire, your zealous noble undertakings, whose
felicitie can never equalize the hearty wishes of
Your Honors most humble and most obsequious servant,
