IT is humbly offered his Majesty, and the great Council of the Nation, that if there is any other place of Scripture which is not answered in this nor my other Book, if it stand in any opposition to the Scriptures agree∣ment, as to hinder the Witness of the Apostles from agreeing with the Testimony of the Pro∣phets (which is the sure word of Prophesie. 2 Pet. 1.19. Ʋnto which the Christians were always to take heed, so as to believe no∣thing in contradiction thereunto) by God's assistance it will be made plain. And I hope that neither his Majesty, nor the Nobles, nor the Clergy will be offended that God should bring these great Truths to Light by so weak an Instrument; for God often makes use of such to declare great things by, that so his Power thereby might be the more emi∣nently seen. For had God by the Wise and Learned Doctors of the time removed all the
mistaken Notions; and made his Word to agree, which Man had made so much to dis∣agree: And likewise explained the Vision so plain from the word, it would have been thought it had proceeded from their great Parts and Learning: Therefore God chuses the weak things of this World, that all the Praise may be rendered to his Name: And it being every ones concern to understand the great Truths of God's word: Therefore it is desired that into whose hands soever this Book shall come, that they will Read it: But especially it is more humbly requested of all to whom it is presented, that they will read it themselves, because it is of very great import; and I hope they will reap Satis∣faction by it. God bless the King and Great Council, and remember the Jews in Mercy according to his Promises made to their Fathers.
