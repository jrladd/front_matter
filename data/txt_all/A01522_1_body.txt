RYght noble, when I had deter∣mined with myself to write the Satire before recited (called the Steele Glasse) and had in myne Exordium (by allegorie) com∣pared my case to that of fayre Phylomene, abu∣sed by the bloudy king hir brother by lawe: I called to minde that twelue or thirtene yeares past, I had begonne an Elegye or sorrowefull song, called the Complainte of Phylomene, the which I began too deuise riding by the high way betwene Chelmisford and London, and being ouertaken with a sodaine dash of Raine, I changed my copy, and stroke ouer into the Deprofundis which is placed amongst my o∣ther Poesies, leuing the cōplaint of Phylomene vnfinished: and so it hath continued euer since

vntil this present moneth of April. 1575. whē I begonne my Steele Glasse. And bycause I haue in mine Exordium to the Steele Glasse, be∣gonne with the Nightingales notes: therfore I haue not thought amisse now to finish & pece vp the saide Cōplaint of Philomene, obseruing neuerthelesse the same determinate inuention which I had propounded and begonne (as is saide) twelue yeeres nowe past. The which I presume with the rest to present vnto your ho∣nor, nothing doubting but the same wil accept my good entente therin. And I furder beseche that your lordship wil voutsafe in reading ther of, to gesse (by change of style) where the re∣newing of the verse may bee most apparantly thought to begin. I wil no furder trouble your honor with these rude lines, but besech of the almightie long to preserue you to his pleasure. From my pore house in VValkamstowe the sixtenth of April 1575.
