WHEN I CON∣sider,
most noble
Queene & Soue∣raigne that with∣in
your Maiesties
sacred brest, wise∣dome,
adourned
with Noble ver∣tues,
is only harbored. From whence as
from a pure Fountaine, doth flow, the
deedes of a Noble hart, waying there∣withall
your Maiesties highe dignitie,
and the lownesse of my estate, with my
simple skill: I stoode as one dismayde,
not daring to aduenture to put thys
my base style to the hearing eyther of
your maiesties reuerent eares, or to the

iudgement of your skilfull eyes: so
well otherwise, with the learned labors
of more excellent authors satisfied. Yet
daylye perceyuing the clemencie of
your highnesse most noble minde con∣ioyned
with so high an estate of Soue∣raignetie,
and noting your princ lye
curtesie, and as it were, a heauenly hu∣militie
matched with the great know∣ledge,
graffed in the roote of your ma∣iesties
royall hart, I was by this, though
before discouraged, boldened to pre∣sume
so farre, as humblye to offer this
my simple present vnto your High∣nesse,
expressing my good wyll, which
of my fruitlesse Garden, and barren
soyle haue founde oute this fragrant
Flower of Friendship crauing the only
accepting of the same, no otherwyse,
than that Noble Alexander of Macedon,Alexander
who greatly estemed the poore Poëme
giuen him by the philosopher Pirrho,
or Antoninus the Emperor,Antoninus. that cōside∣ring
the giuers good will, highly regar∣ded
a fewe simple Meters offered vnto
him. Wherfore, redoubted Soueraigne

 noble Alexander, my hope is, for that
in the person of your Maiestie, are as∣sembled
the rare vertues, not onely of
those Princes, but of many others, you
will amongest the Noble presentes of
more higher estate, receyue these fewe
simple lines, as from him that con∣tinuallye
prayeth for the long
and prosperous continu∣ance
of your Maie∣sties
happye
raigne.
