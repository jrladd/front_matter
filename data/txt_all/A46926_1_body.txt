SIR,
BOokes without Patrons are (they say) like Orphan Children without Parents left to the wide World to shift; i wanting protection do oftentimes mis∣carry in the same. Considering this their likenes

to each other, I pondered with my self to whom I should dedicate this issue of my brain against snal∣ing Criticks and carping Momusss; whom cast∣ing over the Catalogue of my chiefest Friends, and Acquaintance, I found your name in a principal place amongst them. Emboldned wherewith I resolved to Dedicate these my labours unto you, be∣ing much animated thereunto by the perswasions of our worthy Friend Mr. Daniel Rawlinson of Fenchurch-Street, London; as also your love to Books of ingenuity in general. Thus hoping you will candidly receive the same, since the second Part was kindly accepted of an Honourable Person, wishing you as many happy day's, as there are lines in the Book, I take my leave, resting
