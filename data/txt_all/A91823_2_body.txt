Right Worthy,

THus have I now in my declining age,
Adventured my selfe upon the stage.
With resolution for to undergoe
The censures of the most detracting foe.
As Baalam's Asse his mouth was opened wide,
Even so is mine the drunkard for to chide.
Loe, here you have him painted, though so ill,
I wish him painted by some better quill.


Worthies, For temperance you are of all
Your Country-men and Neighbours, principall.
And neither Rome nor Athens ever hatcht
Two head-pieces more sound, more fitly matcht.
Oh, doe not blush I pray, that I present
This worke to you, so wise, so abstinent.

Vouchsafe it but the favour of your sight,
Assure your selves it is no Hypocrite.
And though your knowledge sentence on it give,
Candor reprieve it, and so let it live.
Let it be read I pray in your owne quire,
And through the confines of your Blackburnshire.
And this prodigious sinne thus put to show,
May by God's blessing for ought we do know,
Both work with our, and after generations,
For to abhor such base abominations.
