Right Honourable,
ELaborate Poems have ever aym'd at learned Patrons, who valued Books as your best Lapidaries praise Iew∣els, not by their greatnesse, but their goodnesse. This is a small Cabinet of many and choyse, of which none better than your Noble selfe can judge, some of them borrowing their luster from your own vertues, vouchsafe there∣fore (great Lord) their perusall, being devoted to our sole patronage, whilst the presenter wishing nto you and all yours, a long fruition of terre∣riall graces here, with the fulnesse of celestiall yes hereafter, humbly takes his leave, with that of Catullus to M. Cicero:
Tanto pessimus omnium poeta,
Quanto tu optimus omnium patronus.
