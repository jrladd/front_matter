Right worshipfull,
I Know the world will be of∣fended
with me, that I dare
presume to set out a plaine
Sermon against drunkennes
in these times, wherein so ma∣ny
learned handwritings are
extant already, decked and adorned with much
eloquence, enough to strike amazement in∣to
the hearts of all Belshazzars, that shall
take the least view of them: yet if they consider

the motive that induced me hereunto, they will,
if not Apologize for me, yet abate something of
the rigour of their censures. Now my maine and
onely inducement to be in print, was not, as men
usually plead and I might also if I would, the
importunity of friends, or that I thought in my
judgement these vulgar notes of mine fit to come
to the presse; but especially a vehement desire
which I had to testifie unto the world, how faine
I would (if I could tell how) expresse my thank∣fullnes
unto you, for your favours conferred upon
me from my very cradle unto this present; which
have been so many that they cannot be specified:
for you have done with me as the young Lady
did with Moses, not onely saved me from the wa∣ters,
the bitter waters of penury, but also nursed
me in those famous places, where both the learn∣ing
of the Egyptians and the religion of the Isra∣elites
doe superabundantly flourish. I am per∣swaded
you take no pleasure to see your goodnes
trumpeted to the world; for you know that Vertues
fairest Theater is a good Conscience: but yet
thankefullnes doth not love to smother benefits,
but teacheth us to acknowledge from whom we
have received them. Be pleased therefore to re∣ceive

these few notes, as from one whose highest
pitch of ambition is, to be thankefull unto you for
your many and many favours. I hope your wor∣ship
will not be offended with me, that I dare
trouble you with the reading of a plaine Sermon of
this subject, whose great endowments of Nature
the world knoweth can reach deeper speculations:
But you out of your wisedome will consider my ho∣nest
intentions; in confidence whereof I cease to be
further troublesome unto you, craving pardon for
my boldnes, and humbly entreating the continu∣ance
of your favour to him, who acknowledgeth
himselfe
