MADAM,
IT was your pleasure not long since
to admit me into your Ladiships
presence, where I tooke the bold∣nesse
to begin a discourse of the
Planets, and to declare the pow∣er
of them: which conference dd
arise from the death of Sir Thomas Went∣worth,
who departed this world in his Clymacte∣ricall
yeare. A friend of mine being at the place
of execution, heard a pittifull Lady warble forth
a mournfull duty; and as soone as her eyes be∣held
his head parted from his shoulders, she utte∣red
these words with teares in her eyes, (O what
wit, treson, harmes) which being examined,
were the true letters of (Six Thomas Went∣worth)
without adding or taking away of a let∣ter.
Well might she confidently affirme what she
said, since none will deny, but that the cutting off
the head spoyles the wit. I have according
to your Ladiships command, sent you this dream

of the Lord of Strafford, in regard formerly you
have been pleased to lend an eare to my tedious
relation; the which is included within a small
treatise, stiled, the Divine Dreamer, together
with the service
Of
