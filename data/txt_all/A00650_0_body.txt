EXCELLENT, and most vertuous Prince, my blush∣ing boldnesse asketh forgiue∣nesse for presuming the pre∣sentation of these ill tasting lines, to the Princely view of your high excellency. There are three especiall reasons that moued me to this rashnes; The first, in re∣gard I haue writ to diuers Princes in Germany, & the Netherlands, in a borrowed Language, and haue tasted the fruites of their gratious fauours: And therefore my hopes can be no lesse here in my natiue Countrey, vsing my mother tongue: Secondly, I haue beene a Souldier, and write the truth in a plaine simple stile, which my owne eyes haue beene witnesse of, and mybest courage shall affirme: Thirdly, to shewe some part of my

duty to my Prince, and Countrey, whose loues may commaund the best imployment of my life, for both their safeties: I hope your most gratious acceptance of this simple trueth, will rather in∣courage, then discomfort him, that had rather beare the rigor of his enemy, then the discontent of his friend: Thus mighty Prince, with my best wishes of earthly ioyes, and Heauenly felicity, I continue your high borne Excellen∣cies vnworthiest Souldier, whilst I haue life.
