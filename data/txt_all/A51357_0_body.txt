GENTLEMEN,
THIS Great Work, being by your Encouragement brought to publick View, We most humbly lay it at your Feet; that the World may know to whom they stand indebted for this Treasury of Learning, the Greatest perhaps that was ever discovered in our English Tongue: Hoping that it may answer Expectation, and by the Patronage of so Eminent Persons, find a kind Reception among Knowing Men. If it shall have the Success to please you, who are the greatest Judges of Learning, and who have so highly encouraged it, We have our Aim; We esteem our selves Happy, and our Cost and Labour well employed: And as a Testimony of our Gratitude we shall study something worth the farther Acceptance of so Honourable and Noble Patrons, endeavouring by our Zeal to approve our selves,
Most Honoured,
