Worthy Sirs and Ladies,
BEING about to throw my Mite in∣to the Publick Treasury, to plant a tender VINE in the Lords VINE∣YARD, I thought you fittest to fence it with Your favourable Aspects, who are not onely almost equal in Number but Vertues, to those Sacred Patriarchs, whose History I have meta∣phrazed. The Meeter is like my Self, dull and despi∣cable,
but the Matter is of Divine Inspiration, which requires Your acceptance by Heavens Authority, while as the other onely lets the World know, that I am,

Wittering, Jan. 7. 1675/6.
