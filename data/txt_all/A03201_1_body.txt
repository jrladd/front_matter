THe first part of this work I bestowed upon your friend Mr. Iohn Othow, the second I have confer'd up∣on you, both being incor∣porated into one House, and noble Societie. The proximitie in your Chambers, and much familiar conference, having bred a mutuall correspondencie be∣twixt you. The prime motive inviting me to this Dedication; the much love, and ma∣ny courtesies reflecting upon me from you both: Being the rather incouraged thereun∣to, that though the subject it self carry no great countenance in the Title, yet it hath not onely past the censure of the Plebe and Gentrie; but of the Patricians and Praetex∣tatae: as also of our royall Augustus and Li∣via.

The reason why I have selected you my Patrons, was to exclude my self from the number of those of whom Iuvenal speaks, Satyre 7.
Scire volunt omnes, mercedem solvere nemo. Please you at any of your more leasur'd houres, to vouchsafe the perusall of these sleight papers, your acceptance shall be my recompence. Receive my wishes for your earths happinesse in millions, for your hea∣vens blisse in myriads. Taking my leave of you with that in Adelph.

Nunquam ita magnifice quicquam dicam,
Id virtus quin superet tua.
