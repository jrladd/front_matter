Sir,
IT may bee held indiscretion, that hauing lately escaped Shipwrack, I should so sodenly thrust out a∣gaine from a safe Port into a tem∣pestuous Sea of mens humors, and subiect my selfe to a new Cen∣sure. I must confesse that silence had beene more secure, yet I may freely say, that neither conceipt of mine owne abilitie, nor any vaine affectation of applause, did make me runne into this danger, but onely a desire to spend such idle houres as I could steale from my daylye attendance in Court, in such sort as others might reape some content thereby. At the request of my friend I vndertooke the translation of this worke: the title wher∣of shewes the subiect to be extraordinarie, and if many of these Histories shall seeme very strange, miraculous, and it may be fabulous, for that they exceede our com∣mon sence & apprehension, I must with Mounsier GOV∣IART, referre them to the Authors, out of whose wri∣tings they are collected, who being learned and iudici∣ous,

it is to bee presumed would not incurre so foule an imputation, as to bee reputed Liars. There is nothing mine but a bare tanslation, the which I haue faithfully performed; Such as it is, (beeing this last Lents exer∣cise,) I haue presumed to offer vnto you, as a pledge of thankefullnesse for many kinde fauors. If it be not an∣swerable to your worth, Impute it to my defects, and not vnto my will, whose desire is to giue you bet∣ter satisfaction, that the old saying may not be verified in mee. Tritum est, perire quod facis ingrato. If it shall like you, I knowe it will please many, and my selfe shall reape a desired con∣tent, with which hope I will rest.
