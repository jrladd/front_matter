Gentlemen,
I Having Travelled most Parts of this Kingdom, Chiefly to see the variety of Diseases, and different wayes of Practice, that thereby I might be more Capable of Serving that Part of the Countrey where I intend to Settle; (for it cannot be denyed, a Person Travelling to, and Practising in, many places, may see much more than he who is more Domestick, or Lives altogether at home) thought it a part of my Duty, now I intend to desist from Travelling, to leave behind me for your future Benefit, some Receipts, or Ways of preparing some Medicines, as may be Useful in your Families: And you have here not only Directions how to make those things which I sell from my Stages; but several other as Useful, and as much Experienc'd as they.
I know you have seen many Pam∣phlets of the like nature, but never any so Real as this: And though I may perhaps be malign'd by some, who pre∣fer their private Interest before a pub∣lick profit; yet fear of Offending such shall never cause me to wave my Design, or check my Undertaking, in a thing that may be so generally Usefull. And I hope it will be as Candidly Accepted, as Faithfully Intended, from your Friend and Servant,
