OF this Name and Na∣ture (worthy Gentle∣woman,) many small Books and Pamphlets have heretofore beene publish∣ed the most of which never∣thelesse have instructed ra∣ther how to marre then make good Meate: but this (in
credit of my knowledge, and strict observation in Travell) is experimentally such as it pre∣tends to bee in the Title Page thereof. Whereof I can say bu this, and this it will perform for the sayer, That it gives each Meat his right for the manner o dressing; Each dish his due, fo the order of serving: and both good proofe of my desire to please and profit in the publi∣shing. So, referring it to you worthy perusall, and my selfe to your favourable opinion, I eve remaine.
