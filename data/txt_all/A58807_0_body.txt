THE following Discourses do breath the Spirit of the Author, (who being dead yet speaketh.) For they Carry in them a very sensible Con∣cern for the honor of God, and for that (in which that honor has chiefly displayed it self to us,) the good of Mankind. For it will be no hard Matter for a considering Reader to be Convinced, that Misery (whether here, or hereafter) is the fatal Consequence of wickedness; and that to make our selves happy we must make our

selves Good. And therefore it is hoped, that the seasonable publi∣cation of them may by God's bles∣sing, and by the sweet and forci∣ble insinuations of that Candor, Zeal, and Reason, with which they are inculcated, at least assist a vitious Age to Recollect it self; and may so far do so, as to be a means to reclaim some of those, who have blotted it with that Character. And this hope is so much the greater, because, as we may rationally expect God's bles∣sing upon our good Endeavors; so we may the more firmly do so, when such our Endeavors are warm and hearty. The Good and Merciful God accompany the

design of the Author with his Grace; and extend that Grace to the utmost extent of the publi∣cation; and by making both effe∣ctual turn our hopes into prophesie.
Sir, The Relations of the de∣ceased Author having observed your great respect and kindness to him, and your diligent attendance upon his Ministry, hope the Dedi∣cation of these excellent Reliques of his will be acceptable to you, as they are like to be of singular use, profit and advantage to all pious and good Christians.
