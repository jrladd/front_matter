SIR,
I Can, to none more justly, dedicate this little worke of mine of a few dayes production, which ayms at the conversion of the Jewes, than to you who now hold the place of Mr of the Rolles, which was the Inn or
Hospitall of the converted Jewes; and therefore it is fit you should take notice of the be∣ginning, of their conversion: And I am assured you feare not the too sudden conversion of them, but doe much desire at; and by this little Treatise there is abundant caution given, that the converted should not be bur∣densome to the State, and after your perusall of this small peece, which you approv'd as a fayre attempt towards their conversi∣on, saying, there was no hurt in it, but wishing it had beene done more seriously. To which I make this reply, That Manaslehs trea∣tise beeing so slight, deserved no better. And this may chance do more to their conversion than the
many serious labours of very good and judicious Authours have done. As all the care and endeavour of a skilfull paynter, who desired to expresse the foame of a beast, could not at∣taine unto it to satisfie himself, yet by an angry dash of his pen∣cill or spunge, thereby saw a rare expression of it: So may this carelesse dosh of my pen doe somewhat, which if it may please you and good men, and bring downe their haughtinesse, I have my ayme.
