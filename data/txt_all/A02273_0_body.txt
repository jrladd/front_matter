AS Moyses once by law then made
Was taught to swimme and not to wade
Ariued (by God) at Princes place,
Whom Pharaos daughter tooke to grace.
And brought hym vp, and taught hym so,
Who prooued at length as well ye know:


So I by channce thys Pamphlet here
Dyd saue sometime from water cleere,
And tooke it vp and brought to light,
To be defended through your might.
And so your Honours fauor finde,
According to the Authors minde.


Foure yeere and more I dyd hym nurse.
Although no whit it cost my purse,
Yet driuen at length at cost to be,
Because your Lordship should it see,
Yet no such cost as shall appeare,
But mende my purse within the yeare.



Th'aucthor sure I doe not know,
Nwheter he be high or low,
Or now aliue, or els be dead:
But this in few words may be sead.
Hoping your honor accept it will,
According to the Authours skill.


And for my part still shall I pray,
That God your Lorship blisse alway.
