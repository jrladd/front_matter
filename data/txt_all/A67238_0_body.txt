Gentlemen,
THE reason of this Sermon's appearing in
Print so long after the day on which you
heard it Preach'd, was my unwillingness
to publish it till I was prevail'd with to do it by
some who thought it might be serviceable to the
Present Government; and if it can obtain that
end, I think it comes not out too late.
And I Dedicate it to you, as an Acknowledgâˆ£ment
of the many great Civilities and Respects
which I have had from you, who am
Gentlemen,
