BEing much
and earnest∣lie
requested
heere-vnto,
I haue pub∣lished
in our vulgar tongue
another of Malleolus, aliàs
Thom. de Kempis, or, Kem∣pisius
workes: not that I con∣fesse,
which of some well wee∣ning,
though not so well dee∣ming
persons was commen∣ded
vnto mee, I meane, that
in the old English translation,
and in some Latine copies too,
called, The fourth Booke of
the Imitation of Christe,

which in deede is altogether
De sacramento altaris, and
so entitled: but the next to
that in Kempisius workes,
namelie, the Soliloquium a∣nimae.
This I haue tearmed,
for the great affinitie it hath
with the bookes of Kempisius
by mee heeretofore diuulged,
The fourth booke of the I∣mitation
of Christ.
In the dooing whereof, I
haue as little as might bee
varied frō the auctors words
and phrazes, and no where
from the sense, but where
himselfe hath varied from
the truth of God, and, I doubt
not, would haue redressed, had
hee liued in these daies of
light, as he did in the time of
most palpable blindnes.
And this haue I doon with

the greater alacritie, because
I finde (and thou maist reade
it also in the Auctors owne
Preface) that hee not onlie
doubted that hee might vtter
some things both fonde and
offensiue, but also wished to
haue some godlie corrector of
his faultes, and praied vnto
almightie God gratiouslie to
reueale, such thinges offen∣siue,
either vnto himselfe, or
vnto some other.
Whose godlie praier, God
hath heard, and discouered
those things for thy benefit,
and testification besides howe
Kempisius, the Auctor, how∣soeuer
liuing in a Popish time,
was yet in hart no Papist, but
would like well of that which
is doon, as I trust thou wilt,
whose aedifieng, and spirituall

comforting, I haue onlie ai∣med
at.
And reaping this comfort
to thy soule, by the reading or
hearing of this treatise, bee
thankefull vnto thy God that
giueth thee some taste of the
caelestiall ioies in this mise∣rable
and all-trooblesome
world, to whose grati∣ous
protection, I doo
most humblie com∣mend
thee and
my selfe.
