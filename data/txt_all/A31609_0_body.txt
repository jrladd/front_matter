SIR,
AS the subsequent Script deserves not to b called a Book, so these precedent Lines pre¦sume not to a Dedication: But, Sir, it is an occa¦sion that I am ambitious to lay hold on, to disco¦ver to You by this Epitome (as it were) the pro¦pension and inclination I have to give a more ful and perfect demonstration of the Honour, Love and Service, I own (as I think my self oblig'd) to hav for You. To a Sober, Judicious, and well Princi∣pled Person, such as your Self, plain Truths ar much more agreeable than the most charming and surprising Romance or Novel, with all the strang turns and events. That this is of the first sort, (as have formerly upon Record attested) I do now ave and protest; yet neither is it less strange than true

and so may be capable of giving you some Diversion for an hour: For this interruption of your more serious ones, I cannot doubt your candor and cle∣mency, in pardoning it, that so well know (and do most sensibly acknowledg) your high Worth and Goodness; and that the Relation I am Dignified with, infers a mutual Patronization.
SIR,
