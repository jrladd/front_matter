I Oftentimes remem∣bring (Right honou∣rable Lorde) what accountes I haue to make for the small talent which GOD hath deliuered mee to bee imployed vnto the best, and so my duetie that I doe owe vnto my natiue Countrie, am of force constrained to diuulgate and set abrod some part of my studies, and trauailes in the Sciences Mathe∣maticall, trusting thereby, my duti towardes God and my Countrie, sha be somwhat acquited. And as it is th accustomed maner of all those that se forth any booke worthie reading, to
 select and choose out either some per∣son, who by reason of learning, vertu, wisdome, & such other like ornamēts of the mind, is thought a worthie stay in a commōwealth, or els such as haue well of them deserued, to whom they may yeeld the first fruites of their la∣bors, & dedicate their works finished. In like maner, I hauing atchieued this my simple skill, in the setting foorth many reasons & probable cōiectures from the course of times, of these great cōiunctiōs of the 2. superiour Planets Saturne & Iupiter, in the beginning of waterie Trigon, & now the same con∣iūctiōs in the end of the same Trigon is like to happen, & then turned in to firie Trigon. The which euents of the said Planets doeth marueilously agree with the famous prophesie of Elias, & many other places of scriptures, of the latter dayes of the worlds destruc∣tiō to be neere at hande, & that the
 comming of our Lord & Sauiour Ie∣sus Christ to iudgement, will not bee long. And hauing respect to your Lordships worthinesse in the weale publik: also being animated with your beneuolent inclinatiō, & the manifold benefites towards mee extended, doe boldly present and offer the same vnto your Honour, desiring your beneuo∣lent heart, to vouchsafe to bee Patrone of this my litle boke: and if I shal per∣ceiue your good L. heerewith to be pleased, I shal hereafter (God giuing life) be incouraged to set foorth the re∣sidue of my studies & labours. Thus I, as one that esteemeth nothing in this world more then your prosperous estate, do beseech God to increase you in long life & perfect prosperitie.
