Right Honourable, and Right Worshipfull,
I Present you with these labours of my Pen as the first and new∣est Offering tendered into your hands to welcome You to your new Office of Majoralty: and to congratulate the
Right Worshipfull Company, which hath produc'd a person so well worthy to receive a dignitie so well worth the Cities bestowing. May both you and they find as much joy at the last day of your wearing it as at the first day of your putting it on. J confess I cannot deserve to have these lines accepted, yet I hope you will give them a courteous entertainment through the no∣blenesse of your good Natures: for to your lasting Memory I set this down, and dedi∣cate it to your generous dispositions, desi∣ring nothing more then the prosperity and glory of this renewned City.
