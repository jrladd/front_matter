RIght worshipful, I am glad that I haue any small occasion to re∣uiue that studie which laie, as dead, for a time: and I would bee as glad to haue it cōtinue in good credit & liking after it is once re∣uiued. For which cause I request your worship in al humility to be∣come a patrone of this smal work, worthy to be takē into your hand when your worship shall haue any respit frō your weightier affaires,

and pleasant to be read, because it is an Orphan of one of Lady Musickes children. It is commen∣ded to me by men of good iudge∣ment and learning, and it will be the better commended hereafter if it may go out vnder your wor∣ships protection: which I request again most humbly, wishing your worship as much happinesse as I can conceiue, and conceiuing as much as your worship can wish.
From OXENFORD.
