My Lord,
WHEN both the Favour and Severity of the Laws were by partial and unusual Me∣thods applyed to the Persons, and not to the Cases of the accused; when the Life and Honour of an unfortunate Man depended on the Arbitrary Dictates of some Men in Authority, and when the Sentence pro∣nounced was more Criminal than the Offence of which the Party was too easily convicted; then was your Lordship as far from any Advancement to a judicial Office, as your Judgment and Inclinations were from the Approbation of such Proceedings: But no sooner were places of Ho∣nour and Profit in the Law made the unsought Rewards of good and learned Men, but your Lordships Merits entituled you to both; whose Moderation and Temper will make your Administration just and easie in that honoura∣ble
 Court, to which Fortune had no share in your Pro∣motion; and whose natural Abilities are so improved by a continued and inflexible Study, that your Knowledge is not alone confined to the municipal Laws of this Na∣tion, but is generally extensive to all humane Learning.
What Services may not a Prince expect from the Wis∣dom and Vigilancy of such a Counsellor? And what Benefit may not a divided People find by your equal Dispensation of Justice, who (if they can be united in any thing) it must be in the general Satisfaction which all have in your Promotion, because they know those Causes which come before your Lordship will receive a due Hearing and Attention without Passion or Prejudice to Persons; such Emotions being as much beneath the Great∣ness of your Lordships Mind, as they are beyond the Duty of Justice, and fit only for such who will neither be guided by the Rules of Equity or Reason; so true is that Saying, Utitur animi motu, qui uti ratione non potest.
The Respect which is due to the Office of Magistrates challengeth an universal Obedience; but that particular Affection and Esteem which we have for their Persons is due only to their Vertues and Merits: And such is that which I have, and all Men (especially those of my Profession) ought to have for your Lordship and the pre∣sent Judges in Westminster-Hall, whose Learning and Integrity in judicial Determinations may bring the Laws nearer to Perfection; and whose Examples are the just Commendation of the present, and I hope will be the Imi∣tation of succeeding Ages.
I could never understand the right meaning of that Sentence, Boni Judicis est ampliare Jurisdictionem for if that be true, then to what purpose were those Arguments at the Bar of the House of Peers against
 some late Judges for retaining Bills in Equity, the sub∣ject Matter whereof was only tryable at the Common Law? Such Complaints are now no more, because your Lordship will not only support the Honour and Dignity of that Court, wherein you preside, in the Beauty of Order, but will not enjoyn any other from exercising its proper Ju∣risdiction.
Thus will the Credit of the Laws of England be re∣vived, and Men will acquiesce under the legal Deter∣minations of each Court; very few Writs of Error will be brought for Error in Law, because of the Justice and Stability of the Judgment in that Court wherein it was given; and very few Appeals, because your Lordship knows so well how to temper Equity with Justice, that he must be a very angry Man, who goes away dissatisfied with your Lordships Decree.
But since the Actions of Men in great Places are subject to the various Censures of Mankind, if any pre∣judiced Person should revive those Disputes, or quarrel at your Lordships Administration, such Complaints would leave no other Impression upon the Minds of impartial Men than to convince them of the Wrong done to your Lordship, and the Folly of such Misapprehensions.
My Lord, I have prefixed your Lordships Name to this mean Performance, taking this occasion to shew that great Honour and Respect, which I have for your Lord∣ship; not that I am so vain to think any thing herein to be worthy of your Lordships Leisure, neither do I think it Manners to beg your Lordships Patronage, because a good Book will protect it self at all times, and a bad one deserves no Protection.
I know few Books are either praised or perused, but what are warranted by the common Repute and Esteem
 of the Writer, which must be imputed to the Prejudice and Partiality of Men, and which argues a Diffidence of our natural Parts, as if we did not dare to make a right use of our own Judgments: For this Reason I have concealed my Name, that a Judgment may not be made of the Book by the Repute of the Writer. But I hope your Lordship will not condemn my Ambition, when I say, I am not altogether unknown to your Lordship, who am
