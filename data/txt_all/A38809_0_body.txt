SIR,
I Am bold to present this
liberal Discourse with
the greater Confidence to
you; because you alone
being witness with how little
application I have been able

to frame it, (importun'd as I was
by several Avocations) it may
with the better grace presume
upon your indulgence: There
is this only which I have infi∣nite
cause to regret; that the
tenuity of the Oblation, bears
so little proportion to the
duty, and the service which I
owe you: But, though I
might haply have oppress'd
you with a larger Volume, I
could not with a more illustri∣ous
and becoming Argument;
nor indeed, made choice of a
fitter Arbiter then your self to
determine between us, who
have pass'd so much of your
time in the Publick service of
your Prince and Country, and

in a period when a less steady
Virtue must have succumb'd
under your temptations. With
what fidelity and success you
discharg'd that Ministry, and
how honourably you supported
the change during the Nine∣teen
years space of your ho∣nourable
Character abroad,
I leave others to report, and to
the great and most illustrious
Persons of this Nation, whose
Loyalties mingled their glori∣ous
misfortunes with Yours: I
say nothing of your hospitality,
and of the Civility of your
house, which cannot be but
gratefully recounted by as ma∣ny
as have made any stay at
Paris, and that shall consider

the circumstances of those less∣ning
times: And your mode∣sty
since your Royal Masters
most signal Restauration, has
made it appear, that you
serv'd him without designe, as
esteeming your whole Fortune
a Sacrifice too cheap, to pre∣serve
the dignity of a Charge in
which his Majesties Reputation
was concern'd. I might here
mention the constant Asylum
which the Persecuted Clergy
found within your walls upon
all occasions; because I have
seen the Instances, and have
heard them frequently acknow∣ledg'd
both to your self, and to
your most excellent Lady;
When your Chappel was

the Church of England in her
most glorious estate; at least
in the account of Heaven; for
she was then the most persecuted
Church in the World: But this
is already recorded by better
Sir, The Benediction the Doctor gives to you and yours, in allusion to that which issued from the Ark to Obed Edoms house, I have a particular obli∣gation to suffrage in, &c.—
The publick exercise of our Liturgy, is the Antitype we re∣flect upon, which, by Gods sin∣gular indulgence to you, hath, when chaced out of the Temple, took refuge in your House; so that we have been forced many times to argue from your Ora∣tory for a visibility of our Church; Your easie admission of me to officiate in it for some moneths, and your endeavours to have such an establistment made for me, as whereby in the most difficult of times, I might have had a comfortable subsistence, and a safe Protection under your sacred roof, beside the other graces and civilities I had from you, exact this open retribu∣tion of my thanks, &c.—to you, whose name and memory must be ever venerable to the English Clergy, as your Person hath been most obliging to ma∣ny of us, &c.—
Rich. Watson in his Epist. De∣dicat. before Dr Basiers Trea∣tise of the Ancient liberty of the Britannick Church, and exem∣ption thereof from the Roman Patriarchate, &c. Printed Lond. 1661. Pens: Shall
I descend to
your other no∣ble
and more
personal qualifi∣cations?
That
amidst your bu∣sie
Employments
for the concern
of States, and
the interest of
Kingdomes, you
still held corres∣pondence
with

the Muses, and
conversation wth
letters; so as what
others know but
at a great di∣stance,
and by
reflection only,
You derive from
the Fountaines
themselves, and have beheld
what has pass'd in the World
from the very summit of Olym∣pus:
Thus Xenophon, Thy∣cidides,
Polybius; Caesar and
Tacitus conceal nothing from
you, who are a Critic both in
the Greek and the Latine
Tongues, as well as in all the
modern Languages: To these
I might add the sweetness and

comity of your disposition, the
temper of your Customes, the
sedatenesse of your Mind, your
infinite contempt of Vanity and
gilded appearances; and in
short, all those Perfections
which are the result of a con∣summate
Experience, a pru∣dent
and just estimation of the
Vicissitude of things: But I am
first to beg Pardon for this at∣tempt
on your Modesty, or ra∣ther
indeed for this imperfect
description of your Virtues:
But Sir, I pretend not to ob∣lige
you by your Character,
but the Publick by your Ex∣ample;
and if that have been
the chief design of this little
Piece to declare it to the World,

I attain my Purpose: You
have obliged me with many sig∣nal
kindnesses, with a conti∣tinu'd
affection, a profitable,
and noble Conversation, and
in a word, with all these in
One, with an Excellent Wife,
to make this just Acknowledge∣ment,
and to subscribe my self,
SIR,
Says-Court. Feb. 5. 1666/7.
