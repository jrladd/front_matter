MY LORD,
THis small Present will be censured disrespect, if the greatness of the Sub∣ject do not supply its bulk: It speaks of Loyalty, wherein nothing is small; as in its opposite, Vice, Treason, I deem nothing but great; a Subject suitable to your Lord∣ships inclination, and very commonly the matter of your discourse: A Vertue, that besides being hereditary to the Noble Fa∣mily, whereof your House is a great branch, is so singular in your Lordship, that it de∣servedly crowns all the other Noble Qua∣lities of body and mind, wherewith the Heavens have plentifully blessed your per∣son, whose rehearsal your modesty forces me to omit, and confine my Epistle both
to the subject and brevity of the discourse, wherein what is low and imperfect will be winked at, when once Honoured by your Lordships acceptance; and will be con∣strued in favour of the Endeavours of your Lordships very Humble Servant,
