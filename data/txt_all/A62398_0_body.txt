Appearand EARL of TWEDDALE; Son to Iean Countess of Tweddale, who was Daughter to that Valiant Lord, Walter Earl of Buckcleugh, Your Honours worthy Grand-Father.
AS the Graces, the Vertues, the Senses, and the Muses are embled or alluded to your noble Sect; as all these have ample residence in your honourable and worthy Disposition: to whom then but your felf, being a per∣son so compleat, should I commit the Patronage of that worthy Lord, Walter Earl of Buccleugh; and though I an unliterate Soul∣dier, have not apparelled them in such Garments of Elocution, and ornate Stile, as befits their Honours, and Eminency of the least part of their excellent Worthiness; Yet, I beseech your Honour to accept for your own Worth, and their Worthiness; for if it were not but that I am assured, that your noble Dispo∣sition in all parts is suitable to the in-side of this Book, I should never have dar'd to dedicate it to your Patronage: as it hath an honest Intention, so hath your Breast ever been fill'd with such thoughts, which brings forth worthy Actions; as it is a Whip or Scourge against all Pride, so have you ever been an unfeigned lover of courteous Humanity and Humility: I humbly beseech your Honour, although the method and stile be plain, to be pleas∣ed to give it a favourable Intertamment; for Records and Histories

do make memorable mention of the diversity of qualities of sun∣dry famous persons, Men and Women, in all the Countries and Regions of the World: How some are remembred for their Piety and Pity, some for Iustice, some for Severity, for Learning, Wisdom, Temperance, Constancy, Patience, with all the Vir∣tues Divine and Moral. God who of his infinite Wisdom made Man, of his unmeasured Mercy redeemed him, of his boundless Bounty, immense Power, and eternal Eye of watchful Providence, relieves, guards, and conserves him. It is necessary that every man seriously consider, and ponder these things, and in token of Obedience and Thankfulness, say with David, What shall I ren∣der? &c. Men shóuld consider, why God hath given them a Be∣ing in this life? no man is owner of himself. My Age is Seven∣ty three, it is Fifty seven years since I went to Holland with your honourable Grand-father, Walter Earl of Buckcleugh, in the year 1629. I was at that time not full Sixteen years of Age, or capable to carry Arms in so much a renown'd Regiment or Com∣pany, as his Honours was; I was in no more estimation than a Boy, yet waited upon a Gentleman in his Honours own Com∣pany; notwithstanding it is known, that I am a Gentleman by Parentage, but my Fathers having dilapidate and engaged their Estate by Cautionry, having many Children, was not in a capa∣city to educate us at School after the death of my Grand-Father, Sir Robert Scot of Thirlstone; my Father living in a highland in Esdail muir, and having no Rent at that time, nor Means to bring us up, except some Bestial; wherefore in stead of breeding of me at Schools, they put me to attend Beasts in the Field; but I gave them a short cut at last, and left the Kine in the Corn, aud went as aforesaid; and ever since that time I have continued a Souldier abroad, and at home, till within these few years that I am become so infirm and decrip'd with the Gout, which hath so unabled me, that I am not able, neither to do the King, nor my self Service; so this being entred into my consideration, it is sufficiently known,

that my intention and meaning was not to make any Profite to my self; for I know, I do but little deserve, by reason I could ne∣ver write a Line in my life; neither will my ability keep one to Write to me; and I living two or three Mile from a School; yet is constrain'd by my own wilful Will, sometimes to hire one School∣boy, and sometimes another, yet knows not whether they can spell true Scots or not, by reason I cannot read their Hand, and there is none by me that can, for many times the Writer mistakes the Word from my deliverance; Therefore I hope your Honour will excuse the failing of my unlearned Muse.

Seek then Heavens Kingdom, and things that are right,
And all things else shall be upon thee cast;
Holy days of Ioy shall never turn to night,
Thy blessed State shall everlasting last.
Live still as ever in thy Makers sight,
And let Repentance purge your Vices past.
Remember you must drink of Death's sharp Cup,
And of your Stewardship accompt give up.
Had you the Beauty o sair Absalom,
Or did your Strength the strength of Sampson pass;
Or could your Wisdom match wise Solomon,
Or might your Riches Craesus Wealth surpass:
Or were your Pomp beyond great Babylon,
The proudest. Monarchy that ever was;
Yet Beauty, Wisdom, Riches, Strength, and State,
Age, Death, and Time, will spoil and ruine it.
Health, Happiness, and all Felicity,
Unto the end may your attendance be.
