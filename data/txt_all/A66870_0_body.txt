READER,
THese Papers
were drawn
up when the
Business of the
Lord Rosse was de∣bated
in Parliament,
and had their rise

from That trans∣action.
The first
part of them was
Written by a pri∣vate
hand, and was
occasioned by a Dis∣course
with a learn∣ed
Bishop now with
God upon that Sub∣ject,
and being pre∣sented
to him, he re∣turned
the follow∣ing
Animadversi∣ons

upon it, to
which the Answer
Here set down was
Then given by the
same hand. The
whole is now made
publick for thy in∣formation
and satis∣faction
about this
matter.
