I Here present you with the Noble Character and lively Represen∣tation of the Greatest Princess that ever sway'd this or any other Scep∣ter. A Princess, whose Na∣tural

Endowments, and Ac∣quired Abilities, made her the Envy, or the Example, of all the Crowned Heads about her; whose Fame filled the World whilst she lived, and the Hi∣stories of all Countries since she died. In Persia they had heard of the Maiden Queen, before they knew the Name of England. And the Sophi asked our first Merchant that went thither, if his Country was not governed by a Maid; and upon his Reply It was so, enquired no further. Her Re∣ligion and her Morals, her Pub∣lick and her Private Conversa∣tion with her Courtiers, her

Bed-chamber Women, er Maids of Honour, her Friends and Relations, are all accurate∣ly described in this small Piece, and must needs yield great plea∣sure to Your MAJESTIES to read or hear them at conve∣nient times.
The Great Things she did, and the Ways, Means and In∣struments she employed under her to bring them into Act, are very divertising and in∣structive: Nor will it be any diminution of the Glory of Your Reigns, that in some things you followed the Example of this Wise and Illustrious Queen.
