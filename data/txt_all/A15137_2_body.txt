YOu noble Laureats, whose able Quills
In framing Odes, do drean the sacred rills
Of Aganippe dry, within whose brests
The Syre of Aesculapius safely rests;
And all the Muses Temple, daigne your rayes
To cheare the measures of an infant Bayes,
Spread forth the Banners of your worths to sheild
His yonger Muse, unable yet to weild
Armes, 'gainst the Monsters of this Critick age,
Envie, detraction, and Saturnine rage.
I to my selfe assume not double worth,
Or that my teeming phansie can bring forth
Words to make wonderstand amaz'd, doetrye
To vindicate the breath of Poesie.
In such a thought I'me silent, but because
I've heard invectives belched from the jawes

Of Nil-scientes, whose audacious bragges
Have rays'd a thunder like a shoale of dagges
T' affright endevours:
In writing which, if my weake studies hit
Of any fansie speaking worth or wit,
If I have snatched any fainting Muse
From the black jawes of envie and abuse,
Shooting a soule into her, and new breath,
Maugre those tongues that doomed her to death.
Eccho forth thankes unto coy Daphnes lover
(About whose Fane the sacred Nine doe hover)
Whose kindnesse smild on my uncrusht designes,
And lockt a Muse in my unworthy lines
Able to blunt the dars of envie, pare
The sharpest hoofed Satyr, and with ayre
Shrill as the voyce of thunder, chide those gaules,
That belch forth scandals and invective bawles:
Nay, he, befriending me above my merit,
Vnseen of any, heav'd my winged spirit
T' a higher court than the Star-chamberis,
Where soules may surfet with immortall blisse.
And taught my phansie in those quiet slumbers,
What, waking, I have folded up in numbers,
To tell the brood of Critickes, that there are
Some few, or if not some, yet one, that dare
(Backed by your thrice-sacred worths) expose
These lines and letters to the ken of prose.
