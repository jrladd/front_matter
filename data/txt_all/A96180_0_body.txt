RIGHT HON:
HE wrongs not this age, that speaks of it, either in a Poe∣ticall straine, and so calls it  iron one; or in the spirits aguage and so calls it an amantine, or self-loving one ly tis sad to see, how men
write themselves (too too  gibly) lovers of themselves and how men speake the selves rockes in their p∣ctise: there is much fighti but little sighing; m blood, but little bleed  Nay, is not the Lords  an outcast still with mo Who seekes after her? W is sorry to hear her cryes,  see the throes, and pangs,  be upon her? The heart  men upon the earth are ha∣ned against her, whilst sh in travail, whilst shee p to bee delivered from  that is Rome,Reve. 12.2 Filius ma∣sculus, a Son, a man, and that even at the birth, here is the wonder. and sin;  injoy, all that is truth  Christ: even a blessed Re∣mation; which may be  named ( a male  man childe) and at  birth all the members of 
 Christ may greatly re∣ce, because such a one is rne into the world. But at do I speak of this age?  me to the Saints, these urne indeed, but is it not  sparingly, weakly, dry∣ and too too carnally, that ies in it much of a mix∣e of dust, of an outward  estate, as well as the pure  of sin, or a strong faith  the blessed love, and in the cious promises of the  their God: I would I uld say, that Saints them∣selves were not too too ch, guilty of mourning,  without ground and hout hope in these trying : sometimes we appre∣nd sin under such a colou∣le notion, that it even rks us to much sencelesse∣nesse
and carnall security  sometimes againe we appr hend sin, the Sword,  the sore pressures of  Kingdome, under such  black, such a darke notio that wee are even hopeles and begin to looke upon  selves, as fuell for the fire  the Swords wastings and  solations: against this latte this small treatise bends  selfe, the very drift of it b∣ing this, to present before  beleevers eyes, the mercif purposes, the tender and  thoughts of their God, t∣wards his people in ev times: and to speake  thoughts, there are no app¦hensions, more likely, m sure, more powerfull, to le us to that blessed Rock  staying our selves upon Go
r into that glorious light of rong consolatiō in him; then o eye our God in his merci∣full thoughts towards us, when we be at lowest: upon these thoughts we may well itch, when so many bloo∣dy and malicious thoughts, re all pursuing to take hold on us: Surely these will (Je∣sus Christ giving a blessing) ead us out of the Confusion of these dayes, into the admi∣ration of this God: That of Chrysostome is both wittie and holy: Dominum ipsum ad∣miramur quidem miracula fa∣cientem, sed amplius admiramur miserantem, & longanimiter sustinentem: When the Lord workes miracles we wonder, But more when hee shewes mercy, when he exercises his love and patience: and may
we not ad one Amplius to  and say, Amplius admiram Dominum sic cogitantem bon Wee wonder most of all  that God who purpose good, and so much good to Oh these Machsceboth Sch∣lom, in the Text, these cogi∣tationes pacis, these thought of peace in our God, an from him; these should ta up our hearts, in the mid of all our troubles and heart breaking miseries! tis th onely way to be out of th stormes, to dwell in the lo of our God: Oh tis pleasant  tis sweter then hony to th soules mouth! and have w not need of such sweetnes i these sower, in these bitte times? have we not need  such a name now as Jehova is, and of such love as God
himselfe is, and shews unto is chosen ones? I have one, only this, why I pre∣nt it to your honour; My eep engagements they bid e make bould to come with  handfull of my first fruits, d present my thankfulnes  you, though narrow and mprised in a little room: specially knowing the no∣enes of your spirit, to re∣ive the things of Jesus Christ: I grant they be nuda de, plain truths, and mean∣ disht out; yet to a good omack these wil be heartily elcome, now the Lord him∣lf send out his best mer∣es upon your honour, and ur noble family, and give a essing along with his uths, to the glorious ad∣vantage
of soules in Christ so he desires and praies who is,
