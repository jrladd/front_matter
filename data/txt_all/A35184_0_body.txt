SIR,
YOur own and the joynt-desires of others having rendred these Melancholy Dis∣courses thus publick, you must now be pleased in course to accept of them.
The prodigious Discomposures of our Times, can∣not but occasion great thoughts of heart with all sober persons: and it were a most amazing Infe∣licity, if we who might live together with so much mutual Comfort, should quarrel our selves into common Misery.
These solemn Fasts may serve as sad Remem∣brancers to shew us where we lost our way, that we wander so wretchedly no more.
The ways of Faction in the State, they are (as one hath well observed of Separation in the Church) A Labyrinth wherein men tire them∣selves,Mr. Iohn▪ Ball. and grow giddy, as in a maze; but when all is done, there is no way out but that where∣by they entered in.
. Arist. Eth. l. 8. c. 12. Now if Monarchy be (as our greatest Writers tell us) the best of Governments, and Popularity the very dregs and worst; our Peace and Welfare bound up in the one, our War and Calamities brought in by the other; we may then fairly hope all wise men will reflect with the deeper sorrow upon our late Confusions, and hold themselves greatly concern'd to consist the more steadily with that happy Restauration which God in so much mercy hath vouchsafed to us. God hath gran∣ted it, and every true English-man will be high∣ly thank-ful for it.
Sir, I cannot but heartily acknowledge your worthy conduct of Affairs in that great Trust com∣mitted to you. God Almighty enable you to con∣tinue therein with that Integrity and Vprightness, that Prudence and Resolution, which becomes a good Christian, a good Magistrate, and a good Subject. Which is the dayly affectionate desire and prayer of
Right Worshipful, 
Bristol, Feb. 28. 1680/1.
