SIR,
WHen I Consider what you are by Place, and then Consider what you are by Grace, it makes me stand Amaz'd: To see a Man whose Education springs from Noise and Tumults, Wounds and Slaughters, Religious, Upon Grounds of holy Cir∣cumstance:
To see A Man whose Dealing is in Blood and Waves, becalm'd with Pious Thoughts for Churches good:
To see A Man that fears not Devils if he meets them in a Fleet at Sea; To lay his Roughness by, and meekly fall upon his Knees, to Invocate his GOD for King and Kingdoms good; Bespeaks Religion in the Soul of War.

This is a Lesson you have Learn'd and Practic'd long, That none with Courage brave can serve his King, without he first with Pious Care Obey his God.
Can he be fit to Fight and Die, that knowes his wicked life is such, that when he leaves this World he must to Hell.
The Christian Cause though e're so good must sink, if Christians Lives be bad. Can he be trusted to subdue a Foe, that cannot subdue his Sin; and quarrel strength, that is a Slave and Captive to his Lust?
Sir, Your Life proclaims you Christian, and your Courage Man: And where I see these meet in one, I may be bold to dedicate a Piece for Churches good to such a Man, without a Frown or Scorn.
It was your Pious Faithful Care this Sermon should be Preached; and so it was your Zealous Care to Acquaint His Majestie with what was done, that so it might be made Publick: And now I hope your Wishes will succeed, that Heaven may be Honour'd more, and Christians Bet∣ter'd still, when e're it comes abroad, shall be the Prayers of him who with his Soul doth Love the King and Churche's Peace.
