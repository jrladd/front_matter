Worthy Sir,
COnsidering that good and honest designs sute best with Good men, and are most acceptable to them, and that they are most wor∣thy the countenance and protection of persons in power and authority, I could not well propose to my self a fitter per∣son to whom I might dedicate the ensuing Discourse than Sir John Moore; the name of Moore hath been highly honoured heretofore in the famous Sir Thomas Moore, some∣time

Lord Chancellor of England, which now you have made more illustri∣ons by your being the Grand Instru∣ment in one of the best designs ever attempted and effected in our days, next the Miraculous and Happy Restoration of his Sacred Majesty, even the Sup∣pression of Fanatiscism and Disloyalty, that Pest and Plague of both Church and State, by your seasonable and re∣solute steming that Tide, and putting a stop to that Impetuous Current which threatened to overwhelm the Nation; whereby you may well be reputed to be in truth, not only Maleus Fanaticorum, but also the happy instrument and means of preservation both of Church and State, the Glory and Happiness of your anciently Renowned City, and one of the Loyalist Subjects this Age hath produced. May the best of Blessings ever attend the Royal Throne, with all the Royal

Family, so long as the Sun and Moon endures: And may their Enemies he be ever cloathed with shame and confu∣sion. Be pleased Sir to pardon my great boldness in this Dedication, (the goodness of the end must plead for the unworthiness of the performance, (and with my Prayers for all Health and Happiness to you and yours,) suffer me to subscribe my self
Sir, 
Nov. 20th. 1683.
