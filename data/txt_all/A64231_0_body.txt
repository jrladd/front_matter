My Lord,
THat I presume to Prostrate these Pages at your Lordships Feet, is neither the Product of my Confidence, nor my sense of their Merits: But my Experience of your Lordships Good∣ness encourageth my Address, and my sense of the Duty of the Ministry en∣gageth my Endeavours to serve God and my Countrey to my Power. And I being now concerned chiefly in the Education of Youth, account my self obliged to Instruct them in Religion as well as Learning: And though I fre∣quently do Catechise, and Expound the Catechism of our Church amongst them; yet, my Lord, the desire to promote the good of others, together with those committed to my Care, is
the sole Design of these Endeavours, I supposing nothing more necessary to stop the Torrents of Divisions and Im∣pieties in our Days, than the right In∣structing Youth. And may your Lord∣ship think this small Treatise may be but in the least instrumental for the Reclaiming this Profligate Age, or for the causing the succeeding Generation to serve our God in the Unity of Faith, and Righteousness of Life, I Humbly beg your Lordships Honouring it and me with bearing your Lordships Name, which will render it more acceptable, and may make it more useful. But I submit all to your Lordships Pleasure, presuming to beg your Lordships Par∣don for this boldness, and desiring to Subscribe my self,
My Lord, 

Glamford-Brigg.
