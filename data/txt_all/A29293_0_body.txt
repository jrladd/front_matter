MADAM,
I Am in doubt whether your Grace will have the good∣ness to Pardon me the Li∣berty that I have taken; but I am perswaded that a Cavalier of the quality that mine is, who crosses the Seas on purpose to have the Honour of entertaining you with a Recital of his Choicest Adven∣tures, cannot be ill receiv'd by
so Generous a Lady as you are. For my part, seeing him in such an ardent Passion of going to give you that Divertisement, I could not but abandon him to his hap∣py destiny.
But if for his Audacious Enterprize,
He punish'd were by those bright Suns your Eys,
And forc'd to yield his Breath;
Yet where's that Mortal that would not despise,
And to Your Greatness his Life Sacrifice,
To gain so sweet a Death?
He is a Stranger, Madam, who is going to chuse you out in the midst of one of the greatest Cities in the World; There might be cause for him to fear the committing of a mistake in this enterprise, were there not so great a difference between you and all the rest of your Sex, that thereby you may easily be di∣stinguished
from the whole Uni∣verse. Yet at his setting forth he has been Furnished with most faithful Memoirs upon your Il∣lustrious Person, as your Grace may here perceive.
She is a Lady, who by the Qualifications of her mind, as well as those of her Body, sets a remarkable distinction upon her self where-ever she appears; She has the Soul of a Sovereign, Greatness and Pomp attend her even in the least of things, no∣thing in this World, more High, and more Great then her Heart; and at the same moment, no∣thing more sweet, and more ge∣nerous; insomuch that accor∣ding to the varieties of occasions, with the same mind that she is observ'd to maintain her Rank
with those of her Quality, she is seen to stoop, for to rise, and ap∣proach to her self; those that be∣ing beneath her greatness, fly for succour to her Generosity. Ma∣gnificent, Liberality, and even Profession it self, are Qualities, which are ordinary with her; Yet not without order, and choice of time, and Persons. I omit mentioning the Charming air of her Person, her agreeable conversation, which affords plea∣sure and delight, in all places that she makes happy with her pre∣sence. Of the agreements of her Face, of her Shape and Stature, and of all that which appertains unto a body perfectly accompli∣shed; Those are such advantages, as may be term'd in common with other Ladies, who might
expect the same praise for them; but in the representation of a Person so extraordinary, none but such stroaks and touches are to be imploy'd. That secret Grace, which is the Spring whence all the others flow, bestow'd by the Heavens on so few Mortals, which all the World admires, but cannot express it, though it is the desire of all Hearts, does appear in all her words and acti∣ons, in such a measure, that all that she sayes or does, is Illustra∣ted with this particular Charm, which attracts the Love and ad∣miration of the whole World upon her. None can have a more Penetrating Wit, and quicker apprehension then she is Mistris of, wherewith she unravels in an instant the most intricate things,
and Judges of the most Witty ones. It is a very modest way of praising so Illustrous a Dut∣chess, to only say, that she is a capable Judge of the works of the mind, since that it can be a∣ver'd, that when she pleases, she can produce most accomplisht Pieces of her own growth; And if we will believe those that have a more Particular Knowledge of her sufficiency; it has happened, that by way of Divertisement, and as it were in play, her great Genius, hath produced such Works, as the Famous Drayden would with Pride have own'd for his. It suffices to say, that she is the Protectress of the curi∣ous Wits, not to doubt that she has a large store of her own. It were very easy to know her
by so many advantageous Qua∣lities, which are so rare in this Age; But that which is to make up the perfect knowledge of her, and which is a most Glorious and Splendid advantage in a Person whom Heaven and Nature have taken delight to accomplish, is, that she is Daughter unto the Duke of Newcastle, Grand-Daughter unto William Duke of Newcastle, who did command the late Kings Armies with so much Valour and Conduct, that thereby he has merited that glo∣rious memory which the Histo∣rians mention of him. It is that, that she is Wife unto the Illustrious Duke of Albemarle, who through his rare merit, has acquired the esteem and affect  of his King,  has Honour him vvith the Qua∣lity
of Knight of the most Honour∣able Order of the Garter, of one of his Bed-Chamber-Men, one of his Privy Councellors, and Captain of his Guards; Those Favours from the hands of a Prince, who can discern Persons, were sufficient of themselves to make up the Elogy of so worthy an Husband, if there was not to be added, that he is Son to that Great General Monk, unto whom the Royal Family would be more indebted then it were able to return, if a Subject did not owe all unto his King. What Nobler union then that of those two Houses, which have been as the two Colombs that have supported the Crown, which the most furious of Re∣bellions had so much shaken'd, and in whose Bosom, the almost
expiring fidelity of a whole Na∣tion, has not only found a refuge, but such a succour also, as it stood in need of, wherewith to re-establish it self.
Doubtless, Madam, but that it is very surprising, that I should at this distance, draw so just and so particular a Portraict, that it seems as made after the life; but I will confess to your Grace, that I am Indebted for the principal strokes thereof, unto the Illustri∣ous Author of Cleopatra, and the thing is not so extraordinary, that he who has Painted with such neat Touches a Princess, for whom he could have no other Passion then that, which such Learned men as he himself have for Antiquity, should furnish me with such Curions Colours, in
favour of an incomparable Dut∣chess, for whom he has so much veneration; Yet I must confess that they had had quite another effect, had they been laid on with his own Pencel; and had his Courteous assistance accom∣panyed me to the end, my re∣spects would not be reduced to have no other advantage then that of Distance, to assure you from more then an Hundred Leagues, that I am,
