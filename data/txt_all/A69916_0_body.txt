SIR, when I saw so considerable
a part of the Nation join'd in
the design of settling the East-India
Trade upon a new Foundation, I
thought I could scarce pitch upon a
more seasonable juncture, than this,
to make my Authors appear in Eng∣land,
to give us an account of their

ten Years Transactions, among the
same Nations, where in all probabi∣lity
our Indian Trade is to be carri∣ed
on to the Honour and Advantage
of the English Nation. I will not
pretend to enlarge my self here up∣on
the usefulness of Commerce in
General, or of that of the Indies in
Particular; if the station I am in did
not excuse me from undertaking
that task, the universal consent of all
civilized Nations, who look upon
traffick as one of the main Pillars of
the prosperity of the Common-Wealth,
is a demonstration suffici∣ent
to over-balance any thing that
can be said upon so ample a subject
by a private hand. And as to
what relates to the Indian Trade in
particular, our Neighbours the

Dutch, who have made it the foun∣dation
stone of the present flourish∣ing
State of their Common-wealth,
are living instances, to convince us
what improvements may be made in
this kind, if managed by a dextrous
hand. I might in this place have
made some Reflections, perhaps not
altogether useless, upon the present
condition of some of the Indian
Countries, especially upon those on
the Coast of Malabar, who being
divided into so many petty Princi∣palities,
and for the most part Situ∣ated
very convenient for Traffick,
seem to invite us to be sharers with
them in the vast advantages the East-India
Trade affords: But when I
considered with my self the extra∣ordinary
ability of the Person, un∣to

whom I was making my addres∣ses,
and on the other hand what
slender share of experience I had
in these affairs, I was not without
reason afraid I should run my self
into the same Error a certain an∣cient
Grecian Philosopher did, who
being Honoured with a Visit by that
renown'd African Warriour Han∣nibal,
entertain'd him with a very
long and tedious lesson concerning
the duty of a General. I will inge∣nuously
confess, it was chiefly upon
the score of your Merits, and the
reputation you have so deservedly
acquired in the management of an
affair of the utmost consequence to
the Glory and Advantage of the
English Nation, that when these
Indian Travellers after their return

home from a long and most dange∣rous
Voyage, were to make their
appearance among us; I judg'd I
could not recommend them to the
protection of any other person, than
your self, who both for your Abi∣lity
and Zeal, have given such am∣ple
demonstrations to the World in
what relates to the affairs of the East-Indies;
that, as your Judgment, by
the consent of all sides, is unquesti∣onable,
so these Travellers have all
the reason imaginable to promise
themselves due Encouragement from
your generous inclinations. Before I
conclude; I cannot pass by in silence,
and apply with some small alterations
here, the words Mr. Rennefort makes
use of in respect of the French East-India
Company; that since our pre∣sent

East-India Company is establish∣ed
by the consent of the representa∣tives
of the whole Nation, under the
protection of his present Majesty,
who by his most Glorious Actions,
has made himself both Admired and
Redoubted in far distant Countries,
we have all the reason to hope, that
under the Direction of such Persons,
who have an equal share of Experi∣ence,
Conduct and Honour, they
may in time, at least equalize, if not
out-vie the rest of the European Na∣tions
that have established themselves
in the East-Indies. Which is the
hearty wish of him, who subscribes
himself,
Sir,
