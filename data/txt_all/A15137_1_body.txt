FAIREST,
WHEN by much gazing on those glittering beames,
Which (if unmaskt) from dayes bright Henchman streames,
The Rascians eyes doe gaine the curse of yeares,
The Load-stones swarfie hue their tapers cleares.
When Vnicornes have gluts or surfets taine
By browsing Lycoras, they to regaine
Their stomackes, and a cure, crash bitter grasse:
I leave the application, 'tis a glasse
Wherein the dimmest eye may plainly see
What's due to me from you, to you from me.
But—I'le onely tell the world, that for your sake
My willing Muse this taske did underrake
At howres of recreation, when a thought
Of your choyce worth, this, and this phansie brought.
Some to the barre will call the truth hereof,
Some wonder why? some passe it by, some scoffe,
Because in this full harvest of your sex,
mongst such thousands gleane your name t'annex

Vnto, and usher in these wanton verses,
Some will be apt to think my pen rehearses
Love passions 'twixt your selfe and some choyce he,
(The world I know will not suspect tis me)
And that I age it, lest quick eyes should see;
But in this thought I'me silent, thoughts are free.
Indeed your worth doth just proportion hold
With this high worth which of Bellama's told,
And well my knowledge can enforme my pen
To raise a spite in women, love in men.
And if the Fates befriend me, that my thread
Out-measures yours (your worth asleepe, not dead,
For such worth cannot dye) I then will say,
You equald her, and was—(but truth away)
If these, dull melancholy, griefe, or sleepe,
From any prone thereto, at distance keepe,
Let unto you their tribute thankes be payd,
For my invention by your worth was rayd,
My phansie rais'd, enliv'ned and enspir'd,
That my quick Muse my agill hand has tir'd,
Nay more, me thinkes I might unchidden call
You, subject, object of this Poem all,
And all in this acknowledgement may trim,
You pros'd this Poem, but 'twas vers'd by him
