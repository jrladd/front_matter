May it please your Excellency,
AS the Eastern Princes, upon the News of any Fo∣reigner's Arrival, are wont to expect some Curiosities of the Place from whence he came, to prepare the way for his Reception,

and Introduce the Stranger into their Presence; so, in imitation of this respectful Custom, this Foreign Voyage hopes for admit∣tance to your Favour and Ac∣ceptance, upon that Stock of No∣velty which it presumes upon; and which it brings with it as well from Africa, as several remoter Parts and Kingdoms of the East: For in those Places, there are se∣veral Things here taken notice of, which have escap'd the Observa∣tions of other Travellers. I need not mention, my Lord, with what facility you can employ your Judgment, to penetrate into all that is any where useful, whilst your vigorous Fancy can as rea∣dily present to you all that is di∣vertive in its Entertainment. And tho' I confess I have very great Reason to dread the strictness of

your Censure, upon the strength of your admirable Endowments; yet methinks I find a relief to this Fear, in that Native Candor, which so easily tempers the Ac∣curacy of your Thoughts with favourable Constructions.
But I will not transgress those Measures of Civility, of which your EXCELLENCY is so absolute a Master, by being too tedious in this Address; nor there- violate those Decencies and Re∣spects, which your Practice re∣commends so fully to the World, and of which none have had more sensible Demonstration than my self: Especially considering how much is due to you from the Sacred Order, which you treat with that constant uncommon Civility, as if you design'd to ballance that Contempt, which is

I need not determine, with how much Reason the Eastern Subjects ascribe this Character to their Emperours, That their Roy∣al Condition is owing to their Merits, and that they as far transcend other Mortals in those, as they do in Pow∣er; but I am satisfied, 'tis the un∣questionable Loyalty, Prudence, Greatness of Mind, and other Virtues, which have justly rais'd you to that Sphere, wherein you move, kindly influencing the

Affairs of this great Kingdom; and from whence you look down, like the Heavenly Bodies, from the highest Orb, with a kind and obliging Aspect. And that their other Opinion of their Princes, That they are the Adopted Sons of Heaven, may be your happy Por∣tion too, is not more unfeigned∣ly desir'd by any, than
