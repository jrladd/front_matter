modell, then extended figures, I have
made election of this little of spring
of my braine, to show you the largest

and as an Ambassadour from the rest
of my faculties, to informe you how

of my Soule payes to your worth and

(because more agreeable to your Dis∣position)
more fit to have bin tendred

that a Booke (as it is my best inheri∣tance)
is the most magnificent sacri∣fice
my zeale can offer: this Play
therefore accept, best Sir, from him
who is nothing more ambitious then
of the title of
