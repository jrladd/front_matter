I Have at length, upon your earnest desire, adventured to publish those unworthy lines long since scribled, concerning the Joy of a Christian life. If any aske you wondering, how I, that have spent whole yeares altogether in Sad∣nesse, came to talke of Mirth: you may answer them, that I speake not of what I have my selfe (the Lord knowes, I have little cause to have any, conside∣ring my many sinnes (but what I think, other Christians better then I am, may have. Before you, or any one els, do read me, I desired much to be cleared in two things 1. That I have not the least mean∣ing to favour any carnall merriment. The mirth which I speak of, is the mirth on∣ly
of a Christian life. 2. That I never thought my selfe better able to doe this work, then other men. My heart knowes, I am too little a Christian, to doe it, as it might be done. Onely I sup∣posed, that there had not been much done this way allready. If my doing it ill, may anger any one to doe it better; I shall be exceeding well pleased. I had been larger in the last part of the book, had I not been hindred by a trouble∣some, and dangerous sicknesse, which began upon me when I began to print, and continued in it's extremity almost till I ended. Whatsoever is not much enough, or well enough; I hope the Lord will make amends for it, in the blessing: to whose protection I commit you, and rest
