Precious and dearly beloved Brethren,
IN these perillous times, when ungodlinesse ran∣ges from place to place, and blasphemy a∣gainst the God of Truth and Children of righteousnesse, spreads it selfe, like an over∣flowing streame, or contagious disease, whereby Truth seemes to be fallen in the street; and many who formerly esteemed it their glory to be professors ther∣of (According to the prophesyes which went before of them) have departed from it, and abandoned the profession of it; my spirit was exceedingly moved within me to publish this Discourse, as to the consideration of these, who have al∣ready shooke of Christs easy yo ake from their shoulders, that they may see From whence they are fallen, repent and doe their first works; So especially to your view, who through grace Have followed the Lamb in all his righteous paths, that You may continue to the end, that no man may take your Crown from you.
My owne infirmities, and many sinister Considerations, did strongly importune my silence; yet notwithstanding them all, and those lying prophesies which some ignorant∣ly
 divulged, of my renouncing or disclaiming this worke, before it came to light, through the sufficiency of the Lord Jesus, I have now made it publicke, being well assured, The gates of hel shal never prevail against the truth herein contained.
I do professe, had I seen the Lord carrying forth any of my brethren (whose abilities in judgment and clearness of expression, far exceed mine) to have undertaken a work of this nature, I should have rejoyced in my owne silence. But hitherto have I not known any to stand up in this cause; and surely if all should be silent, The Stones would speake.
The daily objections and loud out-cryes against the truth of Jesus, (which God directs us to walk in) as if a compleat victory was gained against the commands of the Lord; ex∣traordinarily moved my spirit, To cast my mite into the Trea∣sury; To expose my talent for your service, which I have, accor∣ding to the measure given me, performed; Not with entising words of mans wisedome, to please itching ears, but with plain∣nesse and simplicity of spirit and words, to the understanding of the meanest capacities.
And wherever you find any words you understand not, which I am perswaded will not be many; necessity, not my owne desire, enforced their use; lest any seeming materiall objections that I have yet heard of, should passe unanswered. What through pretence to God, Spirit, Mystery, power, light, revelations and perfection, and the crying down of the plain, simple and righteous commands of a crucified, and yet exal∣ted Jesus, as legall, beggarly, fleshly, formall, traditionall & car∣nall: The power of godlinesse is trampled under foot, Delu∣sions, notions and impostures being lifted up, to the subversi∣on of many souls, who forsake Christs easy yoake, light burthen, and strait paths; for Antichrists dangerous licen∣tiousnesse, carnall security, and broad destructive roads, who, like the man that was possessed with a Legion of De∣vils, that dwelt among the tombes, whom no bands nor fetters
 could hold; but he brake them all, and was driven of the De∣vil into the wildernes, wil not endure Christs laws, but break them all; neither Scriptures nor Ordinances can hold them, who often times cry out with him, What have we to doe with thee, O Jesus? A wildernesse of unconstancy, barrennesse and unprofitable shrubs will be their portion, the Tombes, the painted outsides of things will be their habitation, till Jesus the true Son of God command this uncleane spirit to depart from them: And then shal we again see them who before in truth were naked, to be cloathed, and in their right minds.
Let not mens boastings or shoutings, Lo here is Christ, and there is Christ, subvert you; for know assuredly, those who now say in their hearts, They will ascend into heaven, and exalt their Throne above the Stars of God, and will sit upon the mount of the Congregation, and ascend above the heights of the Clouds, and be like the Most High: Yet, they shall be brought down to hel, to the sides of the pit, & be cast forth as an abhominable branch: And you precious ones, Who by patient continuance, in wel do∣ing, seek for glory, honor and immortality, shall be crowned with eternall life; their mountains shall be abased, and your val∣leys exalted.
Behold in this ensuing Treatise, Power, Light, Mystery, God, Christ and Perfection, unveiled and advanced; Ordi∣nances, duties, and visible worship, in their proper places, and spheres also established: Christ is here represented to you, as your King, Priest and Prophet, purchasing your hap∣piness, commanding your obedience, discovering your du∣ty, rewarding your faithfulnesse to death, with a crown of life.
I did intend in this Treatise to have presented to you a discovery of the wiles, snares, stratagems and devices of the man of sin; whereby he subtilly attaines to to a high de∣gree of Lordlinesse over his poore Captives, whom he takes alive at his pleasure, and wherewith he invades the Tents & Tabernacles of the Saints of the most High God: and likewise
 to have laid open the severall officers and offices in the true Church of Christ, with their nature, use & end; but fearing the Reader through its tediousnes should be wearied, or by the greatnesse of its price (the world abounding with so many Bookes already) be discouraged, I purposely deferred that work till the Lord shall vouchsafe me another opportunity.
Whoever shall peruse this Booke, and finde in the words or sense, mis-pointing, or other faults escaped in the print∣ing, I desire they would in love amend them; the most ma∣teriall being already corrected to their hands at the end of the Booke; and that they would seriously reade what is contained in it before they censure, and then Let them judge righteous judgement.
To you my brethren, and fellow companions in the Go∣spell of Christ, doe I recommend this Treatise; beseeching you in the bowels of the loves of the Lord Jesus, That you stand fast, quit your selves like men, contending for the faith (not with carnall, but with spirituall weapons) once delivered to the Saints, and forsake not the assembling of your selves together, as the manner of some is, who draw back (without mercy snatch them as brands out of the fire) to perdition.
Let me beg your prayers, that God would make these poore, weake endeavours of mine, strong and successefull; and that the Lord would give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may receive the truth in the love thereof, and may be transformed into the glory of it: Which glory, that all you and I, may enjoy, as our eternall portion, is uncessant∣ly desired by,
