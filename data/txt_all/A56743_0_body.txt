SIR,
AS you were pleased to command me this School Exercise, which like other Truants you know I was forced to make in haste, so since you are resolved to shew it the World I must de∣sire you to let it know, that you, and the Stewards and those others who heard it, had much better thoughts of it than I my self had, or can yet have the comfort of; and that it goes to the Press not out of any wanton inclination it has that way, but meerly to please its Friends, tho it should happen'd to be ruin'd by it.
I thought it inconsistent with my duty to deny you the first fruits however green or raw of your own School, and of what you have so great a Title to in the whole; And for your sake I know all my School-fellows will receive it with kindness and candour. 'Twas for their use I designed it, and calculated it wholly for the Meridian of Brentwood, and if any others should chance to read it, and not consider it was Preach'd
chiefly to young Schollars, they may very much injure me, if they will not give me leave to entertain those with something more freedom than I would Mourners at a Funeral, and no wise and good man can be concern'd to see folly and ir∣religion expos'd and made ridiculous.
There is one thing I must beg even my School-fellows pardon in, and that is, that I treated them neither with Greek or Latin, but besides that they are grown dishes much out of Fashion at such entertainments, I knew they had enough of those at Brentwood, and the School I thought was a more proper place for them than the Pulpit; and that they are better afterwards digested into sence than brought up whole again; as Epictetus, his Sheep brought their wool and their milk to their Keepers, but not the hay and fodder they had given them. I have no more to say for my self, or my Sermon, but that both the Preaching and Publishing it were designed to be some way or other serviceable to Religion and Learning, and to express my grateful resentments of the kindness I have ever received from you, and to assure you and the World, that I am,
SIR,
