Most Gracious Sovereigne,
I Had not adventured to bring these unpolished meditations into the pub∣lick light, much lesse to have set them before the Sunne, but that Your Majestie was pleased to beckon them to Your Self, and to draw them as by Your own beams, so under Your own shade into Your Royall Presence, that being first animated with the gentlenesse of Your beams, they might not be dazled with the splendour. Neither is this the least of Your Princely excel∣lencies,

Matth. 8.1. that You please as Christ in the Gospel, to come down from the Mount, for the more free accesse of Your people; and know, with Moses, to put the vail of Goodnesse over the shinings of Majestie, so that the meanest of Your subjects may be refresht with the light of your countenance notwithstanding the lustre, and draw livelihood from the splendour, through the serenitie, find∣ing the medium of their happinesse as well as the object to be, under God, in Your Self. It is not to be expected at this present, that the irradiations of this light should be so vigorous in a cloudy Region: We now see to our grief what a misery it is to have the Royall influence intercepted as of late it hath been, and still is, by those disastrous obstructions, which at first had onely the appearance of Elia's cloud,
1. Kings 18.44. like the hand of a man; but are since grown to that vastnesse, as they threaten to the whole Kingdome such ruine as our sinnes call for: yet in the midst of these sad distractions, it is Your Majesties comfort, that as their occasions are from below, so their dispo∣sall is from above, both for the exercise of Your Princely clemency and patience, and for the triall of the sincerest loyaltie of your subjects; yea, and religious hearts, through all these clouds, can discern, and do with thankfulnesse acknowledge
the saying of Solomon to be most true,
Prov. 16.15 In the light of the Kings countenance there is life: the life of the whole State, that it may happily rise to the former glory, wherein it so long flourished: the life of the Church, that it may recover out of this sad languishing condition into which it is brought; the life of the Universities, that they may fruit∣fully spread forth their numerous branches to all parts of the Land: lastly, the life of this small in∣considerable Tractate in as many degrees, as Na∣ture hath bestowed it upon man; in that your Ma∣jestie vouchsafed, first to require a copie in writing, then to command it to the Presse, then to afford it Your Patronage, whilest it presenteth to the world some little portion of that great happinesse, which this eighteen yeares we have enjoyed, under your blessed government. I wish the Argument had had a bet∣ter workman, but what is defective in the Sermon, shall be supplied by my prayers, That the happi∣nesse hereafter spoken of, howsoever it be now eclips'd, may again shine forth in full strength, through Your Majesties great prudence; whose Roy∣all beams as they are powerfull for the fostering of piety, so I hope they shall be powerfull also for the dispelling of all foggie vapours, that may hazard either to prejudice the welfare of Your people, or
to pervert their allegiance. Which as it hath been hitherto untainted, to the envie of other Nations, and honour of our own: So, that it may be alwayes inviolably preserved, is the daily prayer of
