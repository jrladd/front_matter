MADAM,
THe Divine Law that consti∣tutes Tribute the due of Princes, hath consigned Honour the due of No∣bles: which by the Learned is distingui∣shed into Civil, which is a Descent from worthy Ancestors: Moral, whose Spring
 is Virtue: and Christian, which consists in a New Birth, whereby we are Co-heirs with Christ, and the Off-spring of God.
Madam, I judge my self as insuffici∣ent, as Envy can do impertinent, to think by Elogies of your Merit, to add Lustre to your Name; your Ladiship stands upon such a Theatre, that every Scene of your life is exposed to Publique View, and therefore if I should give flat∣tering Titles, the Suffrage of men would soon condemn me; but where God hath made me a Debtor, it is but just to make Payment in conscience to the highest Sanction, and Sence of my own Obliga∣tion of Gratitude. How your Ladiship is enobled by Birth, I shall relate in the words of the Learned Vossius, who in his Book of the three Creeds, Dedicated to William Prince of Aurange, tells us, that his Descent was from Adolphus of Nas∣saw Cesar in the twelfth Century, so that
 Madam, by your Bloud, and Allyes, you are a Branch circling from an Impe∣rial Stem of Majesty.
But Madam, the Nobility of your Descent, onely enrolls your Name in the Catalogue of the Great, is Secular and Transitory, Calculated for this World; but it is your Grace and Vir∣tue that writes it in the Book of Life, and Embalms it to Immortality; the Wreaths of civil Honour are withering, Grandeur is fugitive, but Godliness is a Crown that fadeth not away: which consists in a great Humility, constant Devotion, and a diffusive Charity, which were the Amabilities of your La∣diships Conversation among us; so that you have left behind you a Good Name, and carried with you a good Conscience.
To digest just praises, is a tender, and discreet Virtue, that therefore you may give the Glory to God, I shall turn a Pa∣negyrick
 into a Prayer, That your Soul may be precious in the sight of God, as the Apple of his Eye, the Signet on his Right hand, and be made up among his Jewells, That the Losses of your greatest temporal Blessings may be borne with Patience, and what God hath spared, may be enjoyed with Moderation; that your mind may be equal, and fixed in the great Accidents, and Vicissitudes of humane Life, that the Kingdom of Ire∣land may prove to your Ladiship a For∣tunate Island, by becoming what it once was called, an Island of Saints.
This Sermon had been sooner made publick, but that it was retarded by a tedi∣ous sickness; when it was preached, it was consecrated to God, and now its printed, its dedicated to your Ladiship, by the o∣bedience of,
Madam,
