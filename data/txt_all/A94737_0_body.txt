ALthough the prejudice wherewith you are
prepossessed against the Truth avouched by
me, the Ingagements whereby you are
linked to the Roman See, the Hopes that it's
not unlikely you feed you selves with, of
seeing your Native Countrey reduced under the obedience
of the Roman Papacy, besides the long experience, which
hath been had, of the fruitlesness of Attempts to alter
your Opinion in Religion, how gross soever they have
been proved to be, might have deterred me from this
Writing: yet sith I have been instantly urged to it, and
am loath to imagine all of you tobe of so deplorable a

wilfulness of spirit, as that you will obstinately persist in
your manifest Errours, and thereby cast away your Suls.
I have adventured to publish this ensuing Treatise, that
I might not be guilty of betraying the Truth and your
Souls by my silence. I have been many years a Preacher
in England, chiefly in the Counties of Hereford and
Worcester, and though I have not had much acquain∣tance
with any of you, yet some Conferences have left
me not without hope that you might see your Errour
about the Supremacy, and Infallibility of the Pope and
Church of Rome, which is the chief Point on which
your Religion rests, as it is opposite to Protestantism, al∣though
formerly and of late the French and some other
Churches have strongly opposed the Popes or Roman
Churches Superiority above a General Council, and their
Infallibility in their Determinations. Certainly, these
two Points which are the Pillars of the Religion of the
Roman party are so far from being Catholick, that to him
that shall impartially examine the Proofs, it will appear,
that they have been late Innovations, and are yet con∣tradicted
by a great part of those Churches which hold
communion with the Roman See. And for many other
Points of your Religion, if you would either use your
Senses or your understanding in judging by the Scri∣pture,
translated by your own party, what is true or
false, you could not be so besotted as to believe Transub∣stantiation,
Invocation of deceased Saints, Justification by
your own Works, and their Meritoriousness of eternal Life,
Purgatoryfire, Prayer for the Dead, another Propitiatory
Sacrifice for Quick and Dead besides Christ's, Communion
under one kinde onely, Worshipping of Images and Reliques,
with some other of your Tenets. For freeing you
from which Errours, which are pernicious to your Souls,

if I could contribute any thing, I should count it a part
of my happiness, of which I should have some hopes
were it that I perceived you free from the Imposition of
your Leaders on you, not to reade such Writings as are
against them; which must of necessity enslave you to
their Opinions, and hinder you from an impartial Search
after Truth: wherein what deceit is used by your ima∣gined
Pastour the Pope, may appear, as by many other
things, so especially by the late carriage of Pope Inno∣cent
the tenth in the Controversies between the Janse∣nists
and Molinists in France, who being importuned to
give Sentence concerning the five Propositions of
Jansenius (if we may believe Thomas White one of
your chief Disputants, and one whose approbation is to
this Manual of Controversies of H. T.) did in shew
condemn Jansenius his words, but did allow his mean∣ing.
And that I may not be thought to misreport him,
I will set down his words in his Appendicula to his Sonus
Buccinae, about the Censure of the five Propositions of
Jansenius, Sect. 9. where after he had shewed that the
Propositions of Jansenius might be true in their sense,
though the words were liable to Exceptions, he adds,
But whereto are all these things said? Is it that I might
enervate or reprehend the Popes Decree? Nothing less: I
profess, that was published by the best Counsel and special
guidance of the Holy Spirit which governs the Church.
The Church was afflicted with Dissentions: one part stood
propped by the Truth and Authority of holy Scripture; the
other being guarded with the multitude of Princes, and of
the common People circumvented with the sound of words
flattering humane weakness, took great courage. What
should the Father of the Church do? He allayed the more
unquiet part by granting them their words: the more obe∣dient

part he flatteringly comforted, by commending to them
their Senses. The former part of the Saying was confirmed
by a publick Instrument. The later (if there be any credit to
be given to men of tender conscience) was done before the
Oratour of the most Christian King. It is manifest by what
hath been said, with what rectitude of Faith and Divinity
this part shines; that that exhibites prudence worthy the
Pope, thus take it. Wherein it may be perceived, that
however White speak favourably of the Pope, yet he
sets out his dealing in that business as unworthy an in∣fallible
Judge of Controversies, which should have de∣cided
openly for Jansenius, whose Propositions stood prop∣ped
by the Truth and Authority of holy Scripture according
to their meaning, which Innocentius the tenth commended
to them, that they might hold them still in that meaning
in a Conference; and yet he condemned their Proposi∣tions
in their words by his Bull published to quiet the
wrangling and potent party of Jesuits that had drawn
the Princes and common People to their side by words
that flattered humane weakness in stead of Truth glo∣rifying
God, than which in so weighty a matter what
could be done more like a Juggler or man-pleaser than a
Servant of God constant in asserting Truth? Which
shews, that the Popes resolve not by the Spirit of God, or
the holy Scripture, but by humane policy, as it may be for
their advantage, to keep their party in obedience to them.
And that it is not indeed any sincerity in seeking Truth,
or serious intention to feed the Souls of People with true
Doctrine, but to accommodate all their Determinations
and Negotiations, as to uphold their credit & authority,
might be made abundantly appear by the History of the
Council of Trent, and many other ways, which I shall
not mention, being shewed by many, and particularly by

Mr. Richard Baxter in his Key for Catholicks; onely this
one instance out of Thomas White I minde you of, be∣cause
I think Thomas White is yet alive, and in England
among you, as I conceive by the Edition of the Di∣spute
about Schism between him and Gunning. And I
beseech you give me leave to tell you, that I do much
pity your Souls, which you do enslave to the most de∣ceitfull
of men the Roman Popes, and adhere to your
Priests, which either teach you not at all, but feed you
with meer shews, in your Masses and other Rites, or if
they preach, either preach not the Gospel of Jesus
Christ at all, or corrupt it with mixture of humane Tra∣ditions,
but keep you from hearing those who teach in
your own Language the Doctrine of the holy Scripture
without guile, the refusing whereof under pretence of
your fore-father's example, or the Pope's, and your
Priests restraint, or our imagined Heresie or Schism, and
in stead of it pleasing your selves with Masses in Latin,
Auricular Confession, and Priests Absolution, and such
like Chaff, will never be justified before Christ at his
Appearing, whose Precept is that you search the Scri∣pture,
and Promise of Blessing to them that hear the
Word of God and keep it, the neglect of which is the ne∣glect
of that great Salvation which is brought to us by
Jesus Christ. Unto which, if you would attend, you
would quickly finde the Deceits of your Popes and
Priests, and deliver your Souls from the Snares of
Ignorance of the Gospel and Popish Errours, which now de∣stroy
your Souls. If you yet shut your eys against the
Light of the Gospel tender'd to you by Protestant
Preachers, and persist in your Errour and Superstition
you Destruction will be of your selves, though there∣by
there is cause given of mourning for you to all that

love the Salvation of your Souls, among whom I know
my self to be one, and desire to be accounted as
