Dread Soveraigne:
THere is nothing can
dry the overflowing
spring ofteares in all
your loyall Subjects
eyes for the inestimable losse of
our late Soveraigne, your most
Noble Father, but the Orient
beames, & bright lustre of your
Majesties Emperiall Crowne,
and most happy reigne over us:

whereby that is come to passe
which the ancient English Poet
so much admired, Sol occubuit
nox nulla secuta est: The Sunne
set, and no night ensued thereu∣pon:
Blessed and glorified bee
his Name for it, that dwelleth in
a light which none can approach un∣to.
Who had no sooner fitted
the King your Father for a
throne in heaven, but he fitted
you his Son for his throne up∣on
earth, and hath peaceably
setled you in it.
Vno avulso non deficit alter
Aureus ac simili frondescit virga metallo.
No sooner that golden branch
was plucked away, but another
of the same stocke groweth up
in the roome: Vnder whose

shade the Church and Com∣mon
wealth now shelter them∣selves.
If any man have any of
your Fathers Iewels, he ought
to bring them to you his sole
Heire. The learned resolutions,
and divine instructions which I
lately received from your Fa∣thers
mouth, I value no lesse
then peereless Pearles: And be∣cause
the last speech of a depar∣ting
friend maketh the deepest
impression, and Art herein imi∣tating
Nature holdeth out long
the last note of the dying sound
in the Organ; I thought it my
duty to offer unto your Maje∣stie
the ensuing Relation of the
last polemicall discourses of his
Majesty your Father, in matter

of controversie in Divinity. I
reade in Martial of a Fly that
by a drop of Amber casually
falling upon it, grew in such re∣quest,
that a great summe of mo∣ney
was given for it.
implicuit succina gutta feram
Et sic quae fuerat vitâ, contempta, manente
Facta est funeribus mox pretiosa suis.
The like I am perswaded of
the inclosed Narration, that
many will esteeme of it not for
the flyes sake, but for the Am∣ber;
not for it selfe or the pen∣ners
sake, but for his Majesties
remarkeable passages related in
it. For my part I challenge no
more therein than S. Austine
did in his childe Adeodatus, Ni∣hil
agnosco meum nifi peccatum: I

owne nothing in it but the faults
and defects. All my hope is,
that the darker the foile is, the
brighter the Diamonds of his
Majesties speeches inserted ther∣in
will appeare; which with all
humility I present to your Ma∣jestie
with the tender of my
bounden duty, and service to
God for you, to you for God as
becommeth
