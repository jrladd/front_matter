I HAVE RIGHT vertuous and ryght Honorable Lord, be∣ing led by the singu∣ler zeale & great de∣sire, which I knowe you haue to obtayne vnto learning, & ear∣nestly moued by my seruice and duetie ap∣pertayning vnto your Lordship, aduentured the translation of thys small volume, more excellent and precious, than long or tedious: wherein I trust, if you vouchsafe but to im∣ploy small traueyle, that you shall reape infinite and exceeding great commoditie: neyther doe I desire you to bestowe part of the day in the reading and studie hereof, bicause I haue translated and dedicated the same vnto your Lordship: But rather for the golden and Honorable precepts therein contayned: and for the Noble and highe estate of them, for whome it was first of all composed. But peraduen∣ture my euill and vnskilfull handeling hereof, may
after you haue begonne to reade it, in short tyme and before you reache the ende, wearye your minde, and hinder your good and praysewoor∣thy disire: which, as I feare, may vnhappily come to passe, so I trust your Lordship will warylie preuent the same by adioyning the Latine therevnto: that euer as you are discouraged by my rude and vnfyled phrase to go forwardes, you maye by the other, which is precious and goodly, be made loth to giue ouer till you come to the conclusion thereof: which if your Lordship vouchsafe to doe, I shall thinke my payne and traueyle, to be but pleasure and pastyme, and receyue a good and ample recompence for the same, and you reape such fruite and commoditie as I wyshed you should: and thus vnwylling to be tedi∣ous or troublesome vnto you, I ende, wishing all ioy felicitie and happynesse vnto your good Lordship, that may be wished to any, as the loue and fauour of God and the Prince, long lyfe, prosperous successe in your affayres, and after the chaunge of this lyfe, the greatest happinesse of all, lyfe euer∣lasting.
