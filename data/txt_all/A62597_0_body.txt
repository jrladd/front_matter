WHen upon the request
of some of the Rela∣tions
and Friends of the Reve∣rend
Mr. Gouge deceased, and,
to speak the truth, in compli∣ance
with mine own inclination

therefore as his Patrons this
Sermon doth of right belong,
and to you I humbly dedicate
it; heartily beseeching Almigh∣ty

example that may serve their
generation according to the
will of God, as he did. I am
