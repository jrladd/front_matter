BEing intimate with the Respondent, he easily communicated to me his papers, and I do as freely communicate them, Gentle Reader, to thee. This more publick and more large Edition, which was earnestly de∣sired by some judicious men, it is ho∣ped, will the more conduce to establish the wav'ring minds of many good peo∣ple, long distracted between the love they yet bear to the Reformed Religion of their Fathers, and the importunity of some new men, that under colour of further Reformation, would draw them from the Communion of the Church,
 wherein they have been born and bred. It is true, Reformation is a fair colour: but how they can be call'd Reformed, that cry down all forms, I understand not. Their great Errour is the casting off with such contempt the lawful Guides, and the solemn service of the Church. And this they do of their own heads; For it is clear by the Order of the State Nov. 12. That the Ministers of the Church of England, and the good peo∣ple adhering to them, ought to hold their Assemblies without disturbance. Well then, let the new men allow us equal liberty with themselves, remem∣bring that we live in a free Common∣wealth, and with-all, that our Doctrin consisteth a great deal better with the Civil Government, and honoureth the Magistrate more than theirs. This the Respondent also doubteth not to make further appear, together with the law∣fulness of his Order and Ministry, if the Opponents do go on; but he ho∣peth they have done with him, and
 that he may return to a half-Printed work, upon which he bestows his spare time for the service of his Country, be∣ing a Translation out of H. G. of the Right of War and Peace. Reader, if thou beest one of the Separation, Return in∣to the Bosom of thy Mother: if thou hast obtaind Grace, be faithful to the afflicted Church of England, continue in it to the End. Honour thy Professi∣on, with a just, a sober, a godly conver∣sation, and Farewel,
 December. 16. 1653.
