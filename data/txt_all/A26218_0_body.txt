SIR,
THE Countess of
Du so famous
for Her Travels
into Spain, and
a no less Celebra∣ted
Court Star of
France, has now
taken a Passport from the General
Peace, to make her Tou'r in England.
This is She, whose Noble Gallick
Veins are not only enricht with all
the outward Charms of an Extraor∣dinary
Beauty, but She is Mistriss al∣so



of such Admirable Wit and Gal∣lantry,
that the Rich Gem within is
no way undeserving the Fair and No∣ble
Casket that contains it.
'Tis very probable therefore, that
all these Advantages have set Her
to that height of Universal Admi∣ration,
that Detraction and Envy,
(the common Repiners at Perfe∣ction
and Excellence) have not been
a little industrious to shade and tarnish
so dazling a Brightness: But all their
weak Assaults against Her Unshaken
Honour, have rather augmented Her
Worth and Reputation, and fixt
Her Name Immortal as Her Inno∣cence,
whilst both France and Spain
sate Judges in Her Cause; and
weighing it in the Noblest Bal∣lance,
have Enshrin'd Her Righted
Vertue with a Sacred Comment in
some of the most impartial and In∣delible
Records of Europe.
This Fair Stranger, Sir, who at
present has given me the Honour



of officiating for Her Interpreter,
most humbly by me, begs Your
Protecting Goodness to hand Her
into the Court of England.
And now, Sir, if I may be per∣mitted
to give This every way
Deserving Lady some little know∣ledge
of the Merits of Her English
Patron, I must do ye Both this Ju∣stice,
to assure Her, that She is in
the hands of Honour, and lodg'd
in very Hospitable Walls.
She'll find You, Sir, a Person so
Excellently Accomplish'd, so Truly
Furnish'd with all those Merits and
Endowments, that Wit and Learn∣ing,
and every Other the Noblest
Faculty of a Generous Mind, and
a great Soul, can possibly infuse;
and such the Handmaid of the Al∣mighty,
Great Nature, did allow
You, making Them Your Heredi∣tary
Glories, Virtues no less then
ev'n born with You, whilst You
derive Your immediate Veins from



an Apollinary Original, a Father
that shin'd so mmany Successive Glo∣rious
Years, the Chosen Darling
Oracle of our AUGUST, and
FAMOUS ALBION SE∣NATE.
With all these Powerful Charms,
and such Infinite Deserts, and, Sir,
with all the Smiles of Heaven to
Crown 'em, You have been singl'd
out for that Peculiar Favourite of
Providence, that ev'n Contending
Families have Rivall'd for You,
whilst to invite You to new loads
of Honour, You have Assum'd the
Name of CONOWAY, to make Your
Adopted Lawrels as Rich as Your
Native Ones.
But now, as much as my own
Ambition has Aspir'd to make You
this Publick Address, I have yet a
more Attracting Influence that draws
me to Your Feet; which is to let
the World know, how much I stand
indebted already to Your Generosi∣ty



for those repeated Showers of
ever-smiling Goodness You have
been pleas'd to pour upon me; and
that all the Returns that my Poor
Pen in this small Present can make
You, is but a Thanksgiving-Offring,
the Pure Obligation of Duty and
Gratitude from,
SIR,
