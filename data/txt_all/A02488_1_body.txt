YOV, it was, mine Honourable
and worthy Friends, to whom
(next after our Gracious Ma∣ster)
these ensuing Sermons
were first and chiefly directed: You may iu∣stly
then claime a part in them: and I wish
they may prove as fruitfull unto you, as they
were intended. Sure I am, they wil not prove
unfruitfull, if you compose your selves to the
Glass they hold forth, striving to present you
such to your Master, as they represent to you;
that is, such as seek not to rise, save to get the
vantage-ground for the doing of more good:
such, as preferre their Masters good before
their owne gain; their Masters safety before

their owne ease, their Masters credit before
their owne advancement: such, as in prefer∣ring
sutes aim not at their private ends th∣rough
the sides of the Publike, nor use faire
pretenses for the compassing of foule proiects
or the smothering of honest motions; nor, la∣stly,
look so much to the purse and power of
Petitioners, as to their worths and necessi∣ties.
A Master you have, born (I hope) in a
happy houre for the good of the Christian
world: of whom it may bee truely said,
Antevenit sortem meritis, virtutibus
annos,
Ingenio formam, relligione genus▪
Who not onely rewards and cherishes ver∣tue,
but traceth out the path therof before you
with his own steps; best deserving that place,
by his ingraven courtesie and many Princely
endowments, which hee houlds by lineall des∣cent.
Why then should any seek that favou
in the way of basenes and sycophancie, which
may more easily bee won in the plain and safe
way of vertue and honesty?
Provocations to vice (I knowe) are not
wanting in the place wherein on live: yet,

seeing a religious Nehemiah may be found
in Artaxerxes Court,  Daniel in Nebu∣chadnezzars,
a Ioseph in Pharaohs, and
some faithfull Christians even in Neroes
house; what may wee there expect, where
from the Chiefest are so many encourage∣ments
to piety? in that Family, whose Head
(I dare say) rather glories in being a member
of the true Church, than the Second in the
Kingdome; rather in beeing baptized into the
religion hee professeth, than in beeing descen∣ded
from the royall stock of so many famous
Kings: and where religion is built up (be it
spoken without disparagement of other mens
labours, or relation to mine owne) by as suf∣ficient
Master-workmen in their kindes▪ as
the Land affords; not thrusting themselves
into the Place, but all of them culled out and
called thither: not posting to Preferment by
indirect means; but, like sacred Lamps,
spending themselves to give you light, well
testified by your singular respect towards
them.
Of my self, or this ensuing Worke, I will
say nothing. By the grace of God I am that I
am: and I hope it will appear in this Worke,

and the effects therof in you, that his grace in
me was not altogether in vain. Whatsoever it
bee, it is for your use: and whatsoever I am,
I am for your service; ready to bee imployed
by the meanest of that Family, for which I
daly pray as for myself
