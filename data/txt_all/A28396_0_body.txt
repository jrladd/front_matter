May it please your Sacred Majesty,
HAVING by the Encouragement of His late
MAJESTY, and some Hundreds
of the NOBILITY and GEN∣TRY,
Compleated a Work, which
for divers Years past hath been my
utmost Care and Endeavour, (with no
small Expence unto me) to render it Acceptable to the most
Ingenious; as only designed for the Nobility and Gentry.

And well knowing how much Your MAJESTY
is affected to great Vndertakings, conducing to the Publick
Good, and Honour of Your Nation; And this (which with∣out
Arrogance) being Inferior to none, I have therefore (with
the more Confidence) taken upon me the Boldness to make this
my Humble Address to Your most Gracious MAJESTY,
and to Implore Your favourable Acceptance of these my
Endeavours; which thus Illustrated by Your Name, will
give so much the greater Lustre to the Work it self, and
Honour to the Publisher thereof, who is,
Dread Sovereign,
