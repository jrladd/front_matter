My most dear Brother,
I Send you here no new Present,
but such, as you have been long
acquainted with; and did first
by sending me the Question in
the Title, occasion my Wri∣ting:
and what I remember St. Basil saith in
his Epistle ad Amphilochium, in putting the
Question, you taught me. For although a stu∣dious
man cannot but read of these things here
discussed, yet I am confident they had never by
me been digested into Method, and by that been
so conclusive to mine own and other mens judg∣ments,
without your satisfaction had provoked
it. Indeed in those sad times when this was
writ, there was a rebellion against virtue it
self, and mens friendship was extirpate, Root
and Branch; For the communication of friends,

scatter'd about the Kingdome, was broken, by
the intercepting, yea, the betraying of Letters,
to the Writers prejudice, which I felt: but yet
we kept an intercourse by that dumb mans lan∣guage,
of inviting, as oft as we could with safe∣ty;
and communicated our thoughts by Letters,
when we could not personally meet. You were
tyed to live in London, by a necessary duty you
had to a very near and dear friend of ours, who
was committed to your care; I at a parochial charg
to attend my flock, so long as I could in that
time; How were my thoughts perplexed for you
when those accursed Oaths (for which with their
dependencies I know the Land ought to mourn,
or else I fear will suffer more) flew about,
fearing by some surprise, you might be ensnared,
to act that, which your soul abhorred. I was of∣ten
satisfied by letters of your freedom, yea,
sometimes by the questions you sent me about
these inquiries which were then started; As my
fears were great before, so my joy in your inte∣grity
was high afterwards, as my admiration,
how it could be: But do you praise God daily for
that, whose Providence invisibly looked over
and protected you from those evils; And trust in
him, who will always preserve you loving and
fearing him; Amongst others this was one que∣stion,

you enticed me to write about, which, at
such leasure, as I could steal from Domestique
troubles, I answered in a treatise: You writ to
me to Print it; I knew not, nor could remember
any such thing, which I medled with; when I
came to London, you shew'd it me, I knew my
good freind Mr. Thomas Otwayes hand, who
took the pains to transcribe it for me; read it,
and knew mine own Notions some of them, and
so gave way to the Press: If there be any thing
which adds to the common Notions of Scholars,
let the Reader thank you, who were the occasion
and informer of my studies in it; and not so on∣ly,
but a preserver of it; In the first, you were a
Father; In the second, a Foster to it and by this o∣ther
men may take notice of our mutual kind∣nesses
and wherein our friendship did consist in
those times; When men could scarce know, how
to live; our thoughts were imploy'd about think∣ing,
how to live for ever. Farewel, God bless you
you, is the hearty Prayer of him, who is not more
truly your brother, than.
Most dear Brother

St, DAVID'S
