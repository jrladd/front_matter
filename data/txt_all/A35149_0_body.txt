MY LORD,
THESE Discourses are the immediate Effect of Your Lordship's tender Regard for the Miserable Objects they were directed to.
The sad and difficult Business of New∣gate is a Task above the Labour of any One Person; and therefore Your Lord∣ship's Charitable Appointment of some of Your Clergy carefully to Assist the Ordina∣ry every Sessions, is an Act of the great∣est Compassion, and will, without doubt, be readily obey'd: Neither was the Piety of the Civil Magistrate wanting in so good a Design; for, God be thanked, there was a direct Invitation, and the highest En∣couragement from the late Lord-Mayor, Sir Thomas Lane, to the Performance of

it: And may it have an Influence on other Places of the like kind throughout the whole Nation.
They are Christians, tho Criminals; and tho that Authority which bears not the Sword in vain, is necessitated for the Terror of others to cut them off from the Land of the Living, yet it always al∣lows an Interval between Sentence and Execution; and your Lordship's Interposi∣tion, in imitation of Him who came to seek the lost sheep of the house of Israel, has taken all the Care imaginable to improve that Interval to the End intended; that they should not dye as they have liv'd, but that all possible means should be us'd, that their Souls may be sav'd in the day of the Lord.
'Tis upon this account I presume to put these Papers under Your Lordship's Pa∣tronage, as having the best Right and Title to the Dedication of them. I am,
MY LORD,
