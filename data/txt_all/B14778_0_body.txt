MOst Guerdonlesse Syr Pin∣ching. Patron, and the Muses bad Pay-maister; Thou that owest for all the Pamphlets, Histories, and Translations, that euer hath bin Dedicated to thee, since thou wert one and twentie, & could'st make Water vpō thine owne Lands; but Beware, Sir, you cannot car∣ry it away so, I can tell you, for all your Cop∣per-guilt Spurres, and your Brood of Feathers; for there are certaine Lyne-Sharkers, that haue courst the Countries to seeke you out al∣readie, and they nothing doubt but to find you here this Candelmas Tearme, which if it should fall out so, (as I hope your Worship is wiser thē to venture vp so soone to the Chambers of Lon∣don) they haue plotted together, with the best Common Play-Plotter in England, to arrest
you at the Muses sute (though they shoote short of them) and to set one of the Serfants of Poe∣try, or rather the Poultry, to clawe you by the Back, who with one clap on your shoulder, will bruise all the Taffaty to pieces; now what the matter is betweene you, you knowe best your selfe, Syr; onely I heate, that they rayle against you in Booke-sellers Shoppes very dreadfully, that you haue vsde them most vn-knightly, in offering to take their Bookes, and would neuer returne so much as would pay for the Couers; beside the Gilding too; which stands them in somewhat you know; and a yard & a quarter of broad six-peny Riband, the price of that, you are not ignorant of your self, bicause you weare broad shoo-string; and they cannot be perswa∣ded but that you pull the strings off from their Bookes, and so maintaine your shooes all the yeare long; and think verily if the Booke be in Folio, that you take off the Parchment & giue it to your Taylor; but saue all the Gilding toge∣ther, which may amount in time to gild you a a paire of Spurs withall; such are the miserable conceits they gather of you, because you neuer giue the poore Muse suckers a peny: wherefore if I might counsell you, Sir, the next time they came with their gilded Dedicatiōs, you should take the Bookes, make your men breake their Pates, then giue them ten Groats a piece, and so driue them away.
