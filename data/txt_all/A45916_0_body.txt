May it please your Most Gracious Majesty,
I Need not say how strange and unparallel'd this Fact is, of shedding the blood of your Royal Father; nor how far it exceeds all example of Ages or Nations. This is evident, it was the Head of all the War, Treason & Rebellion, that were perpetrated in all those calamitous times: And therefore that all the Cruelty, Treachery, Falshood, & unrighteousness, under a shew of Law, Religion & Justice, met in it: And with them a conspiracy of dark Spirits, Principles, Sects and Opinions: All these are led forth and drawn out by this Princely Champion of the Church, and openly shewed in their foul colours of Lies, Perjury, Cove∣tousness, Pride and Treachery; and by the firmness and stability of his death,
hath overcome all their lofty and formal appearances; and so hath rendred them all, not onely liable to justice; but visi∣ble and convincible to truth: the crime being so capital, and the suffering for the person, Office, Cause and Manner, so transcendent; it is certainly improvea∣ble, to the utter overthrow of those Opi∣nions and Sects, that attempted to de∣stroy both Church & Kingdom; for by the same suffering, in which there is a finish∣ing of transgression;
Dan. 9.24. there is also following of it an end of sins: The person suffering was Holy, the cause Holy for which he suffered; the persons under whom he suffered professed a holy Spirit, and a holy Cause: Therefore there was a mystery of iniquity, a Man of Sin that did exalt himself in it: and with him all that Babel of confu∣sed Principles and Opinions, that have deceived the People and led them upon these wicked practises: The Common Law Judges, but for Common things; I would not evade Justice, but compleat
it, I know that this blood is both Sacred and Precious; and truly Soveraign, for the healing of the errors and deformi∣ties of the Church: and that doth reach both the height of the Notions and Gifts, & the depths of the Principles, & deceits of them that shed it: And therefore if we should in a common way only avenge it, and thorow ignorance or unskilfulness loose the pretious fruit of it, we should spill it again: This improvement of this pretious blood against this mysterious Ba∣bel, is proper to the Church, and to the Wisdom and Spirit of God with her: And therefore I do as a Priest unto God and Minister of Jesus, and the Church of England; humbly desire of your Majesty a spiritual Tryal of these mens persons, party and principles, by spiritual persons and power, accord∣ing to the Law of God and the Church: and that seeing the cause is spi∣ritual and mysterious, and needs both knowledge and Law,
Mat. 2.7. and that the Priests lips are appointed to keep
knowledge; that enquiry be made in the cause, for the Law of God, at his mouth: 'Tis my zeal for God and the Church, my affection to the memory of your Royal Father, and my faithful love to your Majesties Person, and to the Happiness and Peace of your Kingdoms, that gives me this confidence: except your Maje∣sty shall be pleased to Answer my humble Suit, I desire to be known to the world under no other name, than
