Sirs,
UPon a time it pleased the Cini{que} hu∣mor of Diogenes before a great as∣sembly of people to goe backward, the people smiled, he was angry; thinking he might with as much discretion goe backward with his body, as others goe backward all dayes of their lives in their actions, not doing what reason dictates to be done. In this discourse there is some resemblance of the Philosophers motion, but with a dissimile, or different event, for from his motion, onely smiles or laughter, but from this dis∣course frownes and scandals did arise, &c. (but whether or noe justly, the Presse grants liberty of judging to the Censors) many whereof (I am con∣fident) will deale candidly, namely such as have a coidentity of fancy with the Authour, and of others not a few there will be found, to whom this treatise will give some content, if not for substance, yet for Methods sake, viz. because it crosseth the custome of Antiquity, and Popish practise, Which was and is, First to prefix and read a Text, and then to discourse an houre on it, a thing AS used of old, so NOW at Rome, goodsooth at Rome to this very day.
Willingly this tractate would creep under the
 Patronizing wings of some Particular One, by whose influentiall favour (ever since the generall suffering of the Protestants under the Rebellious Irish) I have subsistance, but it will not be permit∣ted, by reason of its monstrousnesse of shape; having Caput in cauda, the Text in the Conclusion. And therefore Alla ventura; I send it naked into the world without a protection.
As for the Epigraphe or superscription expressed in these words (A Sermon without a Text) say tis an odde one, say tis an absurd one, say tis a false one, (considering this discourse (as a verse on many feet) runs upon eleaven severall Texts to find out the twelfth) call it what yee will, tis none of mine; it had its Originall from the Painters pleasure, or Printers capriccious conceit, who thinks, (that in these times) tis lawfull for every one to appeare in his owne humour; for my part, I had no acquain∣tance with it, till I met it in the front of the Prin∣ted Copies, and therefore if you please, write a delea∣tur upon it, onely excuse me, and for once be intrea∣ted to spare the Printer, that he may with the more alacrity send forth the sermon preached on the Text, which onely here was found in the last periode of the houre, and so silently passed over, with a reservati∣on to the next occasion. So shall I rest
