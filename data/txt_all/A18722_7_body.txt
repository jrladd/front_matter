I am bound in goodwil, detted in ordinarie due∣tie, and commanded for fauour receiued (good Sir Iohn) to publish openly in some little pam∣phlet,

the great desire I haue to bee registered in your memory, so that I might merit by desearts, the least part of your affectionate frendship, not common to all but by a free election of minde offered to a fewe you thinke, worthy of it, in the purchase of which good li∣king I would bestowe a great portion of my studies, ac∣compting my selfe happie in dedicating a peece of my last labours to so worthy a knight. The trueth is (good sir) in the first prime & presumption of the gifte of pen, I followed the fortunate fauourets of this world, as well to be fauoured at their hands as to be enriched by their happes, being learned that witte by those that lackte no wealth in obseruing that custome, but the higher those fauorets were mounted the lower they lefte mee, when some of them flue away I say not with my fethers, and sat on the top of their aduancements, gazing on the base∣nesse of my fortune, which strange accidente ministred by the mutability of time, makes me chuse faster friends, whose noble disposition, breeds greater regard, whose constancies will longer continue, and whose frendships bringes forth better fruite. So good sir Iohn knowing your good inclination towardes the best sorte of men, and faitfullnesse towardes your country and friendes, I (being tyed by good turns to remember you) haue de∣uised a discourse I hope delightfull for your reading, be∣cause in your sundry trauells beyonde the seas (besides your good exercises at home) you haue heard of many excellent men and artes of diuers natures and qualitie. The worke I present you is a commendation of them that can or hath made gold, if any such bee or hath bin, the art wherof I haue not only commended, but in some

part touched, as far as my simple capacitie can reach vn∣to, touching & setting downe in verse, with comly termes some sufficient cause how by transmutation of mettals, many men haue aduentured the making of gold. Thus crauing the worlds goodwill and your fauour for the setting forth this bold discourse, I passe to the matter, & wish you much worship, wordly felicitie, and heauenlie blessednesse.
