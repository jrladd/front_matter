MY LORD,
THese Sermons were preached in your Ca∣thedral, though be∣fore it was yours: And you will give me leave to take this occasion to Congratu∣late your coming thither. I wish your Lordship may sit long at the Helm of Government there, and that you may find the wa∣ters untroubled. But the Church being yours now at the Printing of them, the Sermons ought to
be yours too, if they were worth your owning, or a publick De∣dication.
Such as they are I present them to your Lordship, and crave your Protection for the Author of them, for 'tis possible he may want it. And though they were not designed to be publick when they were preached by me, as you will find in the Preface, yet now they are so. If there be any Errata in them, as there may be some in Sermons of so hasty a Conception, as I assure your Lordship these were, you will be pleased to pardon them to
