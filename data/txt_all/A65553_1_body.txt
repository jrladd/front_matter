MY LORD,
I shall never fail daily, till. Your GRACE shall be above such Services, to of∣fer up to that God, whom You have imitated in hum∣bling Your self to raise the poor out of the dust, my most cordial Supplications, for the encrease of Your Glo∣ries and Felicities. The Su∣preme Lord, the Master of the whole Family in Heaven and in Earth, will repay, what his poor Menials can∣not, all the Good Your GRACE
 has done to his House, and therein, to the unworthiest of his Vassals,
