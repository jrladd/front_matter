May it please your Highness.
WE humbly crave leave to acknow∣ledge, that we look upon it as an eminent mercy, that under your Highness Government, a gracious, and a wise Providence hath put an opportunity into the hands of men desiring to fear God, to effect, what is of highest concernment, for the good of soules: that, they may neither be starved by the Ministers insufficiency, nor poisoned by blasphemy, nor blinded by ignorance, nor hardned by scandall,
Whilest men slept, (we are loath to say the masters of the house,) the envious man hath sown Tares, tares full of deadly poi∣son, and that poison diffused into the very vitalls of faith, and godlinesse, and
 that so subtilly conveyed, that Sathan fights againstPanatici pug∣nant contra Christum, sub titulo Christi: Luther. Christ, under the notion of Christ.
Among the many sad Instances in this nation, this ensuing Relation presents some of those doctrines to your Highness view, Doctrines so directly destructive to the very fundamentalls of Religion, that we solemnly professe, (were it a mat∣ter eligible) we had rather ten thousand times, that we, and our dearest relations should die stark mad in chains at Bedlam, then to live, and die in such execrable opi∣nions against our Lord Jesus.
In all humility we beg the boldnesse to say, that your conscientious, and solemn pursuance of Reformation, that the Gospel of our Lord Jesus may be glorified, will be the life, and length of your dayes in this time of trouble, as a bond of love upon the hearts of the Godly, in this hour of Apostasie, whilest you live, and leave your memory precious to succeeding Generations.
