Most noble, my gracious Lôrd,
THe Office of an Historian is not more worthie then it is hard. But the hard∣nesse, as it riseth from the greater necessity of truth, then of eloquence, is recompensed with an aduantage aboue all other sorts of humane learning. For each of those is but for certain natures; whereas Histo∣ry is a common study for all. The nobility of the guift (for it is a guift from heauen, and a great one) is manifest by the excellencies of persons who haue laboured therein: Saints, Empe∣rours, Kings, Gown-men, Sword-men; and whatsoeuer else is best, or for the best. The difficulties grow out of the abstruse condition of causes, counsels, facts, and their circumstan∣ces. And howsoeuer lights may faile, yet truth is the supreame aime of euery right narratio∣ner. In this historicall work of NERO Cae∣SAR, I haue so regarded veritie, that in the same alone I haue placed my whole dignitie.
