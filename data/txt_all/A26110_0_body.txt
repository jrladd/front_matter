IT may truly be af∣firm'd that Nature made an equal Par∣tition of all her Goods amongst her Children, the Eagle and Hawk for Sight, the Hound for Sent, the Lilly and Peacock for gay Cloathing;
Birds, Beasts, and Fishes went away alike satisfi'd and pleas'd with their Sate and Condition. Man in this Distribution (whilst he retain'd his Innocency) was Gods Vicegerent upon Earth, and besides the Enjoyment of the World, and the Command of all Creatures, he had also Fellowship with Angels; but failing of his Allegiance, he was soon degraded of his Dig∣nity, and became subject unto manifold Miseries, and even to Death it self; yet in his fallen Estate there is to be seen some Marks of his Divine Original. The Heathen Poet sings of him, Os homini sublime dedit Coelum∣que
tueri. That he is not a Child of Earth like other Crea∣tures, but chiefly made to Con∣template Heavenly things, of an erect Countenance, fitly fram'd with two Eyes, won∣derfully made to view the Works of God's Hands. It is true, the Natural Imbecillity, as of others, so of our Visive Or∣gans, doth not permit us to take so full a view as we could wish of Bodies that are always at great distances, therefore Men by their Industry have invent∣ed arts to supply this defect, and amongst many, the Tele∣scope (which occasion'd the ensuing Treatise) is one of the
most useful and curious Instru∣ments that has hitherto been discover'd. By the help of it, Men are in some measure re∣stor'd unto their first Dignity, and somewhat enabled to see and Contemplate the wonderful frame and disposition of the Heavens and Heavenly Bodies, and thereby raise their thoughts and affections from Earthly gross and mean Objects, to such, which from a Primum Mo∣bile, may advance them to the first Mover and Creator of all things. But as the Eye of nature carries us but a little part of this way, so also this Artificial Eye falls very far
short of the Mark; and though it communicates unto us some imperfect glimmerings of the Stars, Firmament, and Lower Heavens, yet it there leaves us at a loss; so that 'tis absolutely necessary to take some other help to gaide us to the sight and fruition of the Supream Hap∣piness, and that is the Eye of Faith, purely abstracted from all Sensitive Matter, which alone can penetrate through the Fogs and thick Vapours of the Air, and can like the Eagle stedfastly (through the Veil of the Firmament) behold the Sun of Righteousness. This Eye is only to be obtain'd by
the constant and Conscionable hearing and reading the Word of God, which by some years Experience I observ'd you to perform, and question not your perseverance therein, having receiv'd as many and great Blessings from His Liberal Hand as any Heart can reason∣ably wish.
A Person of Quality, unto whom I have a thousand Obli∣gations, was pleas'd lately to shew me the following Colle∣ctions of Discoveries, made by many famous Astronomers of Europe touching the Planets and some others Stars, intimating
that the time would not be ill spent to render it into English. I being very sensible of his great Wisdom and Judgment, readily contributed my weak Endeavours to communicate it unto all that are Well Wishers unto these Sublime Speculations; And having for an Age past been ambitious to give some publick Demonstration unto the World (as I have done in se∣veral particular Rencounters unto your self) of my Grati∣tude for the many Favours you have been pleas'd on all occa∣sions to confer upon me both in City and Country; Although
I cannot with a D'Avenant or Cowley fix your Illustrious Name amongst the Stars, by the Rol∣ling Measures of Pindarick or Heroick Odes; yet I do with no less hearty Resentments, ac∣cording to my slender ability, here fitly place your great Name (as a Member of the most famous Society in the World) in the Front of the choicest part of the most Emi∣nent of the Heavenly Stars and Planets; And that it may for many Lusters of Ages, flourish and shine with them above, as you have done here below, and convey their hap∣py
