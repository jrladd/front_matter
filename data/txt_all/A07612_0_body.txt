REturning right worship∣ful, home into Englande out of Spaine, and now not pressed with the for∣mer toiles of my olde trade, to passe the tyme to some benefite of my country, and to auoyde idlenes; I tooke in hande to translate out of Spanish into English, the three bookes of Doctor Monardes of Seuil, the learned Phisition, treating of the singular and rare vertues of certaine Hearbes, Trees, Oyles, Plants, Stoner, & Drugges of the West Indias, for that the same booke is of high commendation in Spaine, and o∣ther countries, in such sorte, that in deede it might bring in tyme rare profite, to my Country folkes of Englande, by wonderful cures of sund great diseases, that otherwise then by these redies, were incurable. And hauing finished he same translation, I determined to dedicate my trauaile

therein, to some rare louer of knowledge, for the worthinesse of the woorke: and not finding any Gentleman of myne acquaintance, that was more studious, and more delighted with learned works, or that more cherished trauellers, and louers of all good knowledge, determined to dedicate the same to your woorshippe before al others, requesting your woorshippe to accept the worke, and to be a patron of the same, and to take it into your prote∣ction, since the matter is of good substance, and of much value, and of me, truly & fithfully transla∣ted into English. And since the aforesaid Medicines mentioned in the same worke of Docto Moar∣des, are now by Marchants & others, brought out of the West Indias into Spain, and from Spaine hither into England, by such as doe dily traffick thither, and that the excellencie of these Hearbes, Trees, Oyles, Plants, stones, &c. haue bin knowen to be so precious a remedie for all manner of dis∣eases, and hurtes, that may happe vnto Man, Wo∣man, or Childe, they haue let of and forsaken very much the olde order and maner of Phisicke, which was vsed before that this was knowen, as thinges not of so present remedie for all manner of diseases, as these nowe late founde owt, are; which by greate experience made in Spayne, and other Countries, were throughly and effe∣ctuously prooued and experimented, to woorke the effectes which are contayned in this Booke.

And thus I leaue your woorshippe to the Al∣mightie, beseeching him to gyue you long lyfe, and for the Common-wealthes sake that ad∣uauncement, that your good nature, and rare vertues doe wel deserue. From London the first of Octo∣ber. 1577.
