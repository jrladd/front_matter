MONSIEVR:
IT is more then two
yeeres past, since a
marchant of this ci¦tie,
one of the mem¦bers
of our French
Church, came to
shewe mee in my
lodging two cop∣pies
of an Epistle, published by the Canons
of Awcon in Germanie, touching the ve∣neration
due vnto their reliques: which
a friend of his, a zealous lover of the trueth

had sent him, with expresse charge to pre∣sent
it vnto me in his behalf, & earnestly to
request me, to returne some answere vpon
it. Wherevnto, considering that I could
not so suddenly accomplish his desire, be∣cause
of my other employements, hee
thought good not to limit mee any pre∣fixed
time: but that I should vndertake &
finish this worke at my leisure. This is the
cause, that I haue made noe great hast in
composing this treatise, which I haue distri¦buted
into three partes: In the scope there
of, I haue followed the order & the exam∣ple
of the ancient Prophets and Apostles,
as also their true Successours, and Imita∣tours,
who haue all maintained with one
common accord, that God onely ought
to be worshipped by his people, & will not
haue this seruice giuen to anie other, by
the authentique, and irreprehensible testi∣monies
of holy Scripture, the which God
hath armed with an inviolable authoritie,
to the end, that those which feare him,
might make noe scruple to receive it who∣ly,
and to giue full beliefe therevnto.
True it is, that I haue annexed vnto it
some attestations of the ancient Fathers,
not to approoue the foolish imagination
of the Romanists, but that the holy Scrip∣ture

maye take more force & credit: seeing
she hath receiued it alreadie frō God, who
is the authour thereof: or that the trueth
of it, which is infalliable, should depende
vpon the advise and jugement of our ance∣stours
& predecessours, which might erre:
but rather to shewe the Doctours of the
Romane church, who relye more vpon the
authority of men, then vpon Gods in the
poincts which concerne our controversies,
that their condēnation is not onely found
in the decrees of divine Law: but also in the
recordes of the pastours of the primitiue
Church: yea euen in theirs whome they
choose for their Iudges and defendaunts.
I call the Epistle of these Canons Iesuiti∣call
in the beginning of my disputation:
because after I had conferred it with Bel∣larmins
booke, the first tutour of these Ie∣suites
vpon this subject, I finde it is but a
patching together of his argumēts, where∣by
he sought to prooue the worshipping
of the reliques of Saincts.
I meant not to vse in the resutation of
their Epistle anie elegant speech, or anie cir∣cumlocution
and readiousnesse in wordes:
because the trueth (without borrowing else
where) hath ornaments enough in her self:
and when shee is simple, and in her naked

robes, shee taketh the more delight in such
as fetts her foorth, & represents her before
the view of al men, in roundnesse and sim∣plicitie.
Forasmuch then, as wee cannot resist to
much, nor too often the heresies which
daylie multiplie in this wicked worlde: es∣pecially
the foolish superstition of those
which would attribute to the reliques of
mortall man, the honour belonging vnto
the sole maiestie of the immortall God: al¦though
that Calvin, Chemnicius and some
other excellent Divines, haue taken penn in
hand to oppose themselues against the first
inventours and advancers of this Idolatrie:
yet I haue also thought it my duty, to giue
foorth this disputation against the new
protecters of this superstition, and in par∣ticular
against the Canons of Awcō: because
it may be availeable to the Christiā church
(as S. Augustine saith) that manie bookes
be writtē vpon one subject: prouided that
they be made in diversity of stile, but not in
diuersity of beliefe, seeing that by this
meanes heretickes are the more convicted,
and on the otherside, wee open the more
passages for the Children of God, to escape
from the call, and out of the snares of these
fowlers, & offer them sundry sorts of coun¦terpoysons

to preserue their braines from
the venoume of their Sophistrie.
As for the rest, there are manie conside∣rations,
which mooued mee to dedicate
this treatise vnto you: For I will not
here speake of that holy zeale, which made
you expose your person and goods, from
your youth, aswel in the defence of our iust
cause at S, Amands, and in some other pla∣ces
adioyning therevnto, wherein you bore
the brunt of the first persecutiō: as for the
preseruation of our Churches here in these
Vnited Provinces: so long as it pleased the
Lord of Hosts to maintain you in the gou∣vernement
of the Towne of Sluce, & so long
as your age would permit you to continew
in that of Nemegen, and to follow his Excel∣lencie
with your foote Regiment in manie
feiges, assaults, & admirable recouverings
of manie Townes and fortes, brought vn∣der
the obedience of our Superiours in the
face of our enemies. Neither, will I speake
of that zeale, and your other virtues which
recommendes you among the gentlemen
of our Common-weale, and in perticular
among vs: for which I must acknowledge
my self indebted, to testifie the same pub∣likly
in the name of the members of our
Church, that for this respect we honor you

and your like, who loues true godlinesse
with their hearts, and seeke to worship with
vs our onely God and heauenly Father in
spirit and trueth. Beside, hauing knowne
in sundrie sortes your singular fauour and
beneuolence towardes mee and mine, for
which I feele my self obliged to present you
with this small gift in acknowledgement
thereof.
Wherevnto also, your comendable reso∣lution
hath moued me, in consecrating the
rest of your aged daies in the lecture of ec∣clesiasticall
bookes, and your capacitie in
iudging well of our disputations against
the traditions of the papisticall Doctors,
and cheifly in this, vpon the reliques of the
Saincts departed.
For as in the daies of your ignorāce, you
haue seen the abuse of this superstition, &
quickly after your conversion manifested
vnto the worlde, that you had it in abho∣minatiō:
so having as it were this smal trea∣tise
alreadie printed your heart: I assure
my self that yow will approue it, and will
finde that whatsoeuer I haue alledged ther¦in,
is grounded vpon the experience of
trueth, the instruction of the Orthodoxe Fa∣thers,
and the authoritie of the holy Scrip∣ture.

In confidence whereof, I offer vnto you
this memoriall as a token of the affection I
beare to your L. beseeching the Lord, who
after the triall of a daūgerous prisō, noe lesse
couragious, thē a long resistance against the
allarmes & pernicious enterprises of our
adversaries, hath at last trāsported you frō
your gouvernmēt of the Citie of Nemegē
(in which our most illustrate LL. wold wil∣lingly
haue held you still) into this Citie of
Dordrecht, to liue here among vs, for the
more tranquility & ease of your agednesse,
overworn & weakened through the travels
and wearisomenesse of the warres, It will
please him.
MONSIEVR, To establish your
heart in the assurance of his grace, towards
those which reverence him, by the remem∣brance
of so manie notable deliverances &
victories which he hath giuē in our time to
our Churches, & to fortifie you with con∣stancie,
to perseuer with vs in the sole invo∣cation
of his blessed name, for the repose of
your soule, & the advancemēt of his glory.
From my studie, this 2. of Septem. 1611.
