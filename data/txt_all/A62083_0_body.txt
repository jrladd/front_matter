My Lord,
AS Cities receive great Princes with Showes and Pageants, so I welcome your Honour into the world with this Dramatick di∣vertisement. Perchance a more serious present had not been so becoming your age, as having but newly shaken off the infant blossoms of a hopefull fruit, which in all reason is to be ex∣pected, if your Honour contemplate the actions of your Illustrious Ancestors, whose greatness and glory were first rooted by the munificence of Majesty, especially for stifling

and confounding the Rebellions in the Reign of King James the Third. Never was bounty better bestowed; for Loyal gratitude in the highest degree has been by it constantly intailed on the house of Huntley: there needs no further demonstration then the actions and sufferings of your No∣ble Grandfather, Father, and Vncles in our late Fanatick Commotions: For, upon all occasions they and their Re∣lations were still in the greatest readiness to assert the Roy∣al Interest: And that which rendred them most conside∣rable (next their Loyalty) was their number, who of themselves, without regard to Dignity, compos'd intire Squadrons of Horse and Foot. And for their sufficiency, let any reflect upon the Battels of the great Montrose, they'l find them so conspicuous, that it lies not in the power of the cunningest and blackest Malice to rase their glorious Memories out of the lasting Monuments and Histo∣ries of our time. This is so great a Truth, that I am delighted to think there's none can justly contradict me: So, who∣soever sees all their Vertues summed up and inherited by you, shall never doubt that in any active capacity for the service of your Prince, your whole Name and Family un∣der such a Head will still continue in the first rank of the best Subjects.
My Lord, this same Comical Trifle, which I dedicate to your recreation, like most other Playes, has its useful moralities. If the way I have used in ordering them be satisfactory, I esteem my self happy, humbly begging your Honour wou'd be pleased to accept it as a small part of the great Thankfulness I owe for the many Reliefs,

Shelters and Protections, I received from your Family during the time of His Majesties Service in the North of Scotland, which I shall die acknowledging, to be the duty of,
My Lord, Your Honours most Devoted, and most humble Servant,
