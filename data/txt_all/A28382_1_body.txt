Gent. Commnders or Souldiers.
IT may be thought strange to direct an Epistle of this nature to
you, as conceived by most, least capable of being Instru∣mentall of advancing
the common good in this nature; yet knowing strange things are wrought by
contraries, and finding the best husbands (through my observance) among those
who have been least conversant therein, have not the least hopes of you; yet
from a Principle of charity too, lest that your learning your fingers to fight,
and discontinuance of your callings, might difuse your bodies and minds so from labour, as to
discourage you from your callings, have thought fit to let you know, You also
may be very capable to doe good service to your present Gene∣ration in this
design: And though many say you are more likely to lengthen cut the War to
prevent Improvements, I am of better hope, and sure, that the Armies
late progresses have manifested the contrary, yet I shall humbly take the
boldness to press your speeding as full an
nd thereto as you are able, both
for your own good, and these Reasons.
1 Because of the gooness and welcomness of a Calm after a Storm,
no less will be a setled Peace after so great a War, and a little breathing
will recover strength and spirits.
2 Because you need not fear want of good Imployment afterward:
This piece will open many doores for that, and I am confident Activity and
Ingenuity will much inlarge our Quarters, and make this Nation
Rehoboth, and with good husbandry indeed would more comfortably
maintain hundreds of thousands more than are allready born, and I hope you will
learn to hate Idleness wholly, as love Liberty dearly.
3 And lastly, because your selves are interested and possessed of
many lands, and those such too as will admit of great Improvement with
wise management, and some of them as great as by this discourse is here
proposed, and though you may conceive your late lands designed for your pay
were highly surveied, and to all advantages to raise them, yet those advantages
of Improvement were not to be considered, nor indeed could be discovered by
them which understood them not; nor was any of them purchased at any other rate
than the present va∣lue to be then set and let to present Tenants; which Lands
are as full of vast Improvements as any lands in England: for all
which causes I need press no more, but in the honour I bear to a Souldiers
name, which God himself hath ho∣noured by stiling himself a Man of War,
although I take no pleasure in War, o∣therwise  than in submission
to Gods will, and the accomplishment thereof, which is not to be resisted or
repined at for the satisfaction of our inclination to ease, peace, or rest;
upon this account or any other, I beseech you (so long as necessities command
you to it) to preserve alway a good Conscience within; for although hopes of
Victory without may carry man through great hardships, yet your peace with God
reaches up to heaven, and cannot be scaled with Ladders, nor undermined with
batteries, being founded upon a Rock, nor starved with famine, a good
Conscience being a continuall Feast. Mr. Fuller in his holy War gives
this description of a good souldier, That he that is most couragious in War, is
quiet and painfull in Peace, and comfortably betakes himself to his calling:
The wiel∣ding of the sword hath not made his Spirit unwieldy for his private
Calling. And I having this opportunity to distribute this mean peece unto the
World, thought good to offer a Portion amongst you the Honourable Souldiery, as
for Edificati∣on how you may turn Improvers too, also humbly to desire your
assistance in the work so far as in you lieth, to remove some grievances and
Impediments of the Common-wealths advantage, largely discovered in the other
Epistles, which brevity causes me to omit, and so no more but humbly pray you
study how to serve your present generation in extolling Gods glory,
endeavouring the com∣mon-good, and in the interim abandon privacy of spirit.
Remember Christs Coun∣sell, view the promised Land, and rejoyce to think of
that day when your swords shall be turned inro Ploughshares, your speares into
pruning hooks, and Christ only be exalted in the Earth, and you brought back
again to sit under your own vines and figtrees, eating the of fruit your own
labours, and enjoy one anoter in
Peace; which once accomplished, here is cut out work for you, some to till the
Land, and others to feed the Cattell, as from the beginning, so will this be
the lasting Improvement. Then will the God of Peace keep them in
perfect Peace, whose minds are stayed on him, And Emanuell will break
in pieces all that gather against him, which is the Confidence and full
Expectance of
