May it please your most excellent Majesty,
I Present, with all humility, to
Your most sacred hands, a De∣fence
of that Cause which is &
ought to be infinitely dearer to
you, then all the world: Not
doubting but upon this Dedica∣tion
I shall be censur'd for a double boldnesse; both
for undertaking so great a Work, so far beyond my
weak abilities, and againe, for presenting it to such a
Parton, whose judgement I ought to fear more
then any Adversary. But for the first, it is a satis∣faction
to my selfe, and may be to others, that I was
not drawn to it out of any vain opinion of my selfe,
(whose personall defects are the only thing which
I presume to know,) but undertook it in obedience
to Him, who said, Tu conversus confirma fratres, not

to S. Peter only but to all men: being encouraged al∣so
to it by the goodnesse of the Cause, which is able
to make a weak man strong. To the belief hereof
I was not led partially or by chance, as many are, by
the preiudice and prepossession of their Country,
Education, and such like inducements, which if they
lead to truth in one place, perhaps lead to error in a
hundred; but having with the greatest equality and
indifferency, made enquiry and search into the
grounds on both Sides, I was willing to impart to o∣thers
that satisfaction which was given to my selfe.
For my inscribing to it your Maiesties sacred
Name, I should labour much in my excuse of it
from high presumption, had it not some appea∣rance
of Title to your Maiesties Patronage & pro∣tection
as being a Defence of that Book, which by
special order from your Maty was written some years
since, chiefly for the generall good, but peradven∣ture
not without some aime at the recovery of One
of your meanest Subiects from a dangerous deviati∣on,
& so due unto your Maty, as the fruit of your
own High humility and most Royall Charity. Be∣sides,
it is in a manner nothing else, but a pursuance
of, and a superstruction upon that blessed Doctrine,
where With I have adorn'd & arm'd the Frontispice
of my Book, which was so earnestly recommended
by your Royall Father of happy memory, to all the
lovers of Truth & Peace, that is to all that were like
himselfe, as the only hopefull meanes of healing the
breaches of Christendome, whereof the Enemy of
soules makes such pestilent advantage. The lustre
of this blessed Doctrine I have here endeavoured to

uncloud and unveile, and to free it from those mists
and fumes which have been rais'd to obscure it, by
that Order, which envenomes even poison it selfe,
and makes the Roman Religion much more ma∣lignant
and trubulent then otherwise it would be:
whose very Rule and Doctrine, obliges them to
make all men, as much as lies in them, subjects unto
Kings, and servants unto Christ, no farther then it
shall please the Pope. So that whether Your Maie∣sty
be considered, either as a Pious Sonne towards
your Royall Father K. IAMES, or as a tender hear∣ted
& compassionate Sonne towards your distressed
Mother, the Catholique Church, or as a King of
your Subiects, or as a Servant unto Christ, this
worke, (to which I can give no other commenda∣tion,
but that it was intended to doe you service in
all these capacities,) may pretend not unreasonably
to your Gracious acceptance. Lastly being a defence
of that whole Church and Religion you professe,
it could not be so proper to any Patron as to the
great Defendor of it; which stile your Maiesty hath
ever so exactly made good, both in securing it from
all dangers, and in vindicating it (by the well order∣ing
and rectifying this Church) from all the foule
as persions both of Domestick & Forraine enemies,
of which they can have no ground, but their own
malice and want of Charity. But it is an argument
of a despairing & lost cause to support it selfe with
these impetuous out-cries and clamors, the faint re∣fuges
of those that want better arguments; like that
Stoick in Lucian that cried ! O damn'd vil∣laine,
when he could say nothing else. Neither is it

credible the wiser sort of them should believe this
their own horrid assertion, That a God of good∣nesse
should damne to eternall torments, those that
love him and love truth, for errors which they fall
into through humane frailty! But this they must
say, otherwise their only great argument from their
dāning us, & our not being so peremptory in dam∣ning
them, because we hope unaffected Ignorance
may excuse thē, would be lost: & therefore they are
engag'd to act on this Tragicall part, only to fright
the simple and ignorant, as we doe litle children by
telling them that bites, which we would not have
them meddle with. And truely that herein they doe
but act a part, and know themselves to doe so, and
deale with us here as they doe with the King of Spain
at Rome, whom they accurse and Excommuni∣cate
for fashion sake on Maundy-Thursday,
for detaining part of S. Peters Patrimony, and ab∣solve
him without satisfaction on Good-Friday,
methinkes their faltring and inconstancy herein,
makes it very apparent. For though for the most
part, they speak nothing but thunder and lightning
to us, & damne us all without mercy or exception,
yet sometimes to serve other purposes, they can be
content to speak to us in a milder strain, & tell us, as
my adversary does, more then once, That they allow
Protestants as much Charity as Protestants allow
them. Neither is this the only contradiction which
I have discover'd in this uncharitable Work; but
have shewed that by forgetting himselfe, & retract∣ing
most of the principall grounds he builds upon,
he hath sav'd me the labour of a confutation: which

yet I have not in any place found any such labor or
difficulty, but that it was undertakable by a man of
very mean, that is, of my abilities. And the reason
is, because it is Truth I plead for; which is so strong
an argument for it selfe, that it needs only light to
discover it: whereas it concernes Falshood & Error
to use disguises and shadowings and all the fetches
of Art and Sophistry, & therefore it stands in need
of abler men, to give that a colour at least, which
hath no reall body to subsist by. If my endeavours
in this kind may contribute any thing to this disco∣very,
and the making plain that Truth (which my
Charity perswades mee the most part of them
disaffect only, because it has not been well represen∣ted
to them,) I have the fruit of my labour, and my
wish; who desire to live to no other end, then to doe
service to Gods Church and Your most Sacred
Maiesty, in the quality of
