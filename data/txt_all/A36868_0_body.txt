My Lord,
IN this Happy Reign where Ho∣nour is the Reward of Vertue, if the Greatness of the Trust can recommend the Merit that holds it,
 possibly a fairer Post is not possess'd than your Lordships in the Leiute∣nancy of Middlesex.
Their present Majesties, there∣fore (whom God preserve) ha∣ving placed your Lordship Lord Leiutenant of the aforesaid Coun∣ty, a Person descended from an Ho∣nourable and Ancient Family, in∣dowed with such Heroick Eng∣lish Courage, that feared not with Extremity of Danger to withstand the Fury of Domestick Enemies to our Religion and Liberties, but have also bravely opposed the proud Insolence of those whose Minds where filled with Envy, as their Sails where with Wind; hoping to re∣duce
 the Freedom we enjoy to the Tyrannical Slavery they Pos∣sess.
Those excellent Vertues which continually flow from your Lord∣ship, together with the Honours and Favours your Lordship has con∣ferred on me, Embolden'd me humbly to present your Lord∣ship, with some Considerations for the Service of the Militia, by which I have endeavoured to state a Form of Exercise which is now Published, and I hope will con∣tribute to the effect for which it is designed, viz. to make the Milita (so great a part of which is under your Lordships Com∣mand)
 more serviceable to the Kingdom. I am,
My Lord,
