MADAME,
OƲt of a Ciuill regard and speciall care not to wrong Strangers, I haue attempted to furnish these Forraine Compositions with afor∣tune equall to what they had at Home. Courtiers they were borne, (as being begot of purpose to serue in those Chambers where your Maiestie had your high Beginning) and, in that Quality, haue bee'n committed, by their first Publishers, to the Tutelarie Shadow of the most Crowned Branches of your thrice-Christian Stemme. My wishes are that they may not suffer in their Condition by meanes of my good Opinion of them, which hath made mee Studie to make them Denisons of mine owne Countrie. And therefore, to preserue them in their first Degree and Safetie, I haue thought meet to Arme them with the Maiesticke Patronage of a Queene of their former Acquaintance, and of a fortune somewhat resembling their owne; who hauing nobly Fauoured them in the time of their greatest Securitie amongst their Naturall and Potent friends at home, will, as is humbly hoped, resolutely vndertake to Protect them now, in the time of Need, from the Affronts and Dangers incident to the life of Aliens, and vouchsafe them (being now as it we Naturaliz'd for her owne Subiects, and taught the Language wherein by her nearest People shee is pray'd for) a more Princely measure of Countenance and Affection, then formerly, when shee could not call them hers by so Soueraine an interest. Heerein, Sacred Ladie, if it may please you, in their behalfe, to Seale with an indulgent Eye the Grant of this my first Court-sute, they shall bee so farre from needing to enuie the Domesticke Estate of their more incommunicable Kindred left behind them, that rather it may bee presaged that the fame of their new happinesse heere abroad, will awake and stirre vp some of the great Remnant of their Courtly Race to craue the Conduct of some second and more able Guide to put them in the way for the like Outlandish Adventure. This, and greater Miracles, your Grace may easily effect with the least Musicall Honour daigned at any time by your incomparable Voice vnto these your first-Deuoted. The most harmonious Rectour of the immortall Quire instruct and perfit your Highnesse for the bearing of a Ce∣lestiall Part in the euerlasting Hallelu-IAH. So prayeth,
Madame,
