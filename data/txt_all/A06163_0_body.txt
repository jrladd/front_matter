HEathen people (Right Wor∣shipfull) lead by Nature, ab∣horred nothing more than a man Ingratefull: The Christians taught from Heauen, com∣mand nothing oftner than to be thanke∣full. To auoid the reproofe of the one, and obey the charge of the other, I pre∣sent your Worship (in signe of my sin∣cere affect) with this small conceit, pend by a Gentleman my deare friend. The matter may at the first sight (I graunt) seeme nothing graue, but in the procee∣ding it will prooue Gratious: Diogenes reprooues the vitious, commendes the vertuous, vnmasks sinne, and sets downe remedies. If you accept it and forget my boldnes, my desire is satisfied, and the Author no lesse pleased.
