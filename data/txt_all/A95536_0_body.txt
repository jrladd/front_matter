JOHN TAYLOR, the Water Poet, who was the Author of this Tract, was long since a Member of Your Company; and, for his singular Loyalty to his Royal Master King CHALES the First, honour'd with his Badg; and like∣wise made a Yeoman of the Guard.
His Conversation was honest and diverting; his Brain was so Fruitful, that it overflow'd with pleasant thoughts and Witty conceits: Who ever Reads his Works, may easily discover he was no Plagiary; bor∣row'd from none; but all his Writ∣ings
were purely Original; touch∣ing always on such Subjects, which none had ever attempted; Altho' he wanted the Imbellishments of Learn∣ing, yet he had so great a Stock of Natural Parts, That Ben. Johnson, in that Age, (the best Judg without doubt) Esteem'd and Valu'd him, as one of his Sons.
In his own Writings, we find him mention Sevenscore several Tracts, publish'd by him: Tho' in the Vo∣lume which passes for his Works, there is but Sixty three; many of them coming to my Hands which are not inserted in that Volume. I have Industriously labour'd to pro∣cure the Remainder; and chose to Publish them Singly, and Gradually, and presume to Dedicate them to You, who claim the greatest Title to them. I shall not attempt to give
Encomiums; 'tis sufficient the Works praise the Author. By this Means, even the poorest may easily obtain so admirable a Collection; and not feel the want of their Mony. (For 'tis pity any thing of his should be buried in Oblivion) I chose to pu∣blish this Dialogue first, between the Pedler and a Popish Priest; to shew his Stedfastness in the Protestant Re∣ligion; which all his time he la∣bour'd, both by his Exemplary Life and Pen, to Testify: For, when the Civil Wars had reduc'd him to great Necessities, his Body full of Infirmities, and loaded with Years; yet still he continu'd with his Pen, to assert his Loyalty to his Prince, and his firm principles of Religion, and Zeal towards his God. If this may find Acceptance, and Appro∣bation
from Your Worships; 'Twill give me encouragment to present You with the Remainder and Sub∣scribe my self,
