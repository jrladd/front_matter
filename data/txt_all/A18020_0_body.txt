THE great desire and godlie delight, which J knowe to be in you both, to heare, reade and meditate in the Law of GOD, with that blessed man, whom Dauid describeth: the bringing vp of your children with Abraham in the way of the Lord, and the exer∣cising of your family in godlines, with your worthie examples vnto others, and vertues thereunto correspondent (besides your manifolde friendshippes towards me, your poore neighbour):
 haue often times moued me to praise GOD for you, and to commend your happie lot: And at this time to vn∣fold some parte of my gratefull good will, by sending vnto you this little token (the complaint of Tyme). I be∣seech you to accept it gladly at my handes, in regarde of my good will, chiefly in respect of the thing itselfe, which (though as briefe a Jonas Ser∣mon to Niniue) expresseth greate matter for instruction, admonition, exhortation, commination, and conso∣lation, in all pietie. The Lord make vs thankefull for his gratious benefites, and so to vse the happie Time of our peace, that our great prosperitie, be∣yond other Nations, may rather fur∣ther vs, than hinder vs in that good
 course of godlines which we haue be∣gonne, to the attaining of eternall life in Christ Iesu. And that howsoeuer all the world be affected, we may fully resolue to serue the Lorde as Josua did, with our families: and not forget to pray vnto GOD with Hester and her Maidens. Then shall wee enioy the benefite of our blessed time with Hezekias, and obtaine that safete ia∣gainst our enemies, which other godlie haue obtayned by the mercie and lo∣uing kindnes of our good GOD. To whose blessed protection I commend you and yours. London, this last of June, 1582.
