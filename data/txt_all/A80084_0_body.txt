TO you beloved the faire and strong hand of heaven hath bin fully manifested, at first plucking you as a brand out of the fire of the enemies fury, that watched for you where you li∣ved, and now again the same hand of heaven hath visited you with new favour, putting the proud adversarie by, and cut∣ting his combe, when he was ready to chop you for the pot, in the place where you sojourned. Remember now Salomons Scripture, The Lord was angry with him, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice. He has twice appeared marvellous in mercie to you, and look'd upon you as no stranger in the place where you were strangers. Remember the day, wherin these thoughts tooke you up continually, what shall we doe, whither shall we goe, what way shall we flie, what course shall we take, that may be pleasing to God, safe for us. And now let me tell you whither you shall flie, even unto the Lord with thank∣full hearts who hath so wonderfully magnified his favour towards you. I have seene a failing in the Towne hitherto, as secure as if never in danger, as proud as if no matter of humbling, as prophane as if great deliverances did not bring great engagements to holinesse, as unthankefull, as if not beholding to God, as superstitious, as if the master of Ceremonies, and not the Father of mer∣cies had saved them. But doe not you faile too, let the Towne be beholding to you for your prayers and your praises, be you their Masons to helpe to make up the breaches of their walls, their country husbands to amend their hedges, and make up gappes where Gods wrath might breake-in. The Lord give you patient hearts in these oppressing times and hard charges, and abundance of thankfulnesse to Jehovah Nissi the Lord your Banner, that both you and the Church of God may be cloathed with the garments of salvation.
