My Lord,
IF I had no particular obligati∣on
to your Lordship, the very
Argument of the following Ob∣servations,
upon a Presumption
at least, that they are faithfully
made and collected, would soon
have determined my choice, and
suggested to me where I ought

to address my self in a Dedica∣tion.
How highly your Lordship
has merited of the Greek Church
by taking it into your care, and
by opening a Sanctuary for the
poor distressed Bishops and
Priests of that Communion to
fly unto, is not unknown at Con∣stantinople:
and whatever the
success of it may be, They
cannot be so unjust, as not
to applaud your Lordships de∣sign,
as worthy of your great
Charity and Piety, to relieve
the necessities of those, whom
either curiosity and love of lear∣ning
shall draw into these parts,
or Turkish cruelty and persecuti∣on
shall drive and force out of
their own Country; and at the
same time to reduce them from
those errours and corruptions,
which have of late crept in a∣mong
them, by bringing them

into a nearer and more familiar
acquaintance with the Doctrin,
and rites of Worship establisht
in the Church of England. It
cannot be doubted in the least,
that the most likely way to effect
this excellent design, was not
onely to permit but to encourage
the building of a Church in Lon∣don
for their Nation; where
they might enjoy the free exer∣cise
of their Worship in all things
that are decent and inoffensive,
and any way essential to their
Religion. That this has been
done with such Christian gene∣rosity
and prudence, they owe,
next to His Majesty unto your
Lordship: whom they must for
ever look upon as their great
Patron. And if the Governours
of their Church have not such a
grateful resentment of the fa∣vour,
as it highly challenges and

deserves, or if They, who en∣joy
the happiness and benefit,
should render themselves less wor∣thy
of it, yet your Lordship will
not lose your reward with God:
and all good men consider it as
the effect of that publick and
generous mind, which has been
so conspicuous in all parts of
your Lordships conduct. With
what a steday courage your
Lordship has defended the
Church of England, in this day
of Trial, against the furious assaults
of her restless enemies, the
Papists on the one hand, and the
Giddy Sectaries on the other,
(who both agree in the same
designs of pulling down the Hie∣rarchy,
and overturning the Go∣vernment,
in order to her more
effectual ruine,) all her true and
genuine Sons, who love and pray
for her peace and prosperity,

cannot but most gratefully ac∣knowledge.
And though the
spirit of fury rages still, and is
not to be charmed or allayed by
that mildness and sweetness of
temper, which is so natural in
your Lordship, yet they cannot
but inwardly admire you, against
whom they have onely this to
object, that you are a Bishop.
It is for the great honour of our
Church, that we can ballance
your Lordship against any of
your renowned Predecessours,
and against the most celebrated
Bishops of the Church of Rome,
as Antonine, Borromeo and Sales:
and it is the great happiness of
our Church too, that a Person of
such Illustrious Birth and Merit
is advanced to so high a Station
and Dignity in it. It will be the
proper work of those, who shall
write the History of our Times,

to transmit a full character of
your Lordships worth to Posteri∣ty,
which, when envy and ma∣lice
are laid aside, and an impar∣tial
judgment is made of Persons
and Things, will always pay a
great respect and honour to your
Name and Memory: and there∣fore
it will better suit with my
Meanness, with my Function,
and with my Obligations, to
pray to Almighty God to conti∣nue
such a publick Blessing to
his Church, and to profess my
self in the highest degree of
duty,
My Lord,
Your Lordship's most Humble
and most Obedient Servant,
