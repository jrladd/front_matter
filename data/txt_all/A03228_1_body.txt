Right Worshipfull, and euery way wor∣thy; Your Armes display'd in the Front of this Show, approue your Gen∣try, and your Trafficke and Commerce, (being free Merchant-aduentures) testifis to the World your Noble Pro∣fession; as Trading in the East-Indies, Turkey, Italy, Spayne, and France, &c. to the Honour of our Nation abroad, and singular Pro∣fits redounding to the Realme at home. Your more priuate Imployments heretofore, aswell in furthering Arts, as in∣coureging rmes, adding no common Luster to these Offices, vnto which Time and your owne Demerits haue at this pre∣sent called you. Then as that Publicke weale is most blest and flourishing where the Gouernours are aswell beloued in their Persons, as feared in their Places: So likewise it be∣longeth to all such as are in Authority, to fieare themselues

by the rule of Socrates, that is, To heare courteously, answere discreetly, consider seriously, and sentence vn∣partially. But I presume not to aduise, where I rather de∣sire to be instructed; shatting vp my present Seruice with that of Seneca, Id facere laus est quod decet, non quod licet.
