THat I give to you an account of this my pre∣sent taske, it is no more then what often I have done in my other studies with your good acceptance and my great profit. When I look back (as frequently I doe with a de∣lightfull remembrance) towards those yeers of my childhood and youth, wherein I did sit under your Discipline, my heart blesses the goodnesse of God, who in a very rich mercy to me, did put almost the white and ra∣zed table of my spirit under your hand, after my domestick in∣structions which were from mine infancy, to be engraven by your labours and example with my first most sensible and remaining impressions, whether of piety or of good letters, or of morall ver∣tue: What little portion in any of these, it hath pleased the Lord of his high and undeserved favour to bestow upon me; I were ungratefull if I should not acknowledge you after my Pa∣rents, the first and principall instrument thereof. I cannot de∣ny, that since the eleventh yeer of mine age to this day, in my inmost sense, I have alwayes found my selfe more in your debt, then in any other mans upon earth.

Among the many blessings wherein God kath made you in∣strumentall towards me, this was one not the least, that by your gracious and most loving discourses, you so seasoned my childish heart with an early love towards the ancient oppressed Dis∣cipline of our Church and the Patrons therof, that no after ten∣tations were ever able totally to extinguish it: You did so re∣plenish me with narrations of the more then ordinary graces of many both in Scotland and England, who had lived and dyed in opposition to Episcopall usurpations, that my spirit was ever thereafter kept in a reluctancy and a kind of aversnesse from the Prelaticall wayes.
I confesse, after you, to my exceeding great griefe and losse, were taken away from my head, and I came to be set at the feet of other Masters, especally Mr. Cameron and Mr. Stru∣thers, my very singular friends and excellent Divines as our Nation has bred, I was gained by them to some parts of con∣formity, which if the Lords mercy had not prevented, might have led me, as many my betters; to have run on in all the er∣rours and defections of these bad times: but thanks to his glo∣rious name, who held me by the hand, and stopped me at the be∣ginning and first entry of that unlucky course; who before I had put my hand to any subscription, or was engaged in any promise, or had practised any the least Ceremony in my Flock, did call me to a retreat.
The remainder of your ancient instructions, and the sight of your sufferings: the happy fellowship and sweet society of that most precious man Master Dickson, of old yours, and now my most gracious Colleague, were to me strong retractives and wholesome antidotes against all the infections of the ayre, wherein I did live; till the Lord sent to me and many others, that soveraigne remedy of all the Episcopal Gangreen, the gra∣cious ungracious Service-book: So soon as that came into my lands, together with some late writs of the Canterburian and Court Divines, which I did carefully look into as the true and
just Commentaries both of that Book, and all the rest of the pro∣ceedings of that party, which then did manage the publick Counsels both Ecclesiastick and Civill of Britaine: I did con∣clude, that their Designe was wicked, that their intentions were cleer to corrupt the Church, and to enslave the State, that all their former innovations were but introductory meanes and adminicles for these ends: Whereupon I resolved by the grace of God upon all hazards, to contradict and oppose (so far as it was lawfull for me to move in my spheare) all not onely their late grosser, but also their former more subtill and plausible corruptions. This ever since has been the greatest part of my labour, and thanks to God, not without some fruit, especially to such who had stumbled more or lesse upon the block of con∣conformity, which was the condition, as you know of the farre most part in the whole Isle.
At this time I did not think of any farther contest with that party; the hand of God by the Counsels and Forces of the Par∣liaments, and by the labours of many gracious Divines of both Kingdomes, having so broken and defeated that enemy, that there was no more feare, and scarce any thought of him among us, yet behold an unexpected necessity of one bout more with him.
The wofull Anarchy wherein the perversnesse of some few men, by the permission and heavy plague of God, has for too ma∣ny yeers kept the Church of England, has produced such a mul∣titude of heresies and schismes, as no heart in the which is the least sparkle of love to God, or of zeale to his truth, can behold without a great deale of griefe and compassion, and now also with some piece of indignation. For to many of those seduced soules, upon their feare and presage of some controlement and restraint of their liberty to beleeve what they list, and preach what they beleeve, if once any government were set up in the Church; they become angry with all whose conscience pousses them after so long patience, to presse for some setling of our so
great and unheard of confusions: And because in this desire the Scots are with the first, according to their interest which they have bought at a very deare rate, there ore upon them with the first, the passions of those misled people does oftentimes break out.
It were long to tell you of the manisold, not onely unexpected unkindnesses, but very injurious contumelies which from this fountaine have flowed out upon our whole Nation; all which we have entertained with so great wisdome and meeknesse, as the Lord did furnish; so much the rather that we did find this folly and unjustice as much resented by the wiser of their own Coun∣try-men as we could have wished: Beside, that this generation of men have served the Assembly of Divines at Westminster the Common-Counsell of London, the Houses of Parliament, the Kings Majesty himselfe, and whosoever else lyes crosse in their way, large as uncivilly as they have done us; the compa∣nions we have in our sufferings, make our other wayes insup∣portable injuries the more tolerable.
But of all the kinds of injustice whereby they have been plea∣sed to deal against us, this now in hand seems to be most strange: they rest not satisfied with all they are able of themselves to speak, write or print for the disgrace of our Church, unlesse they scrape together, and with their owne hands cast upon our face the falsest of the most wicked calumnies which our common ene∣mies the Prelats, either of old or of late have invented against us. We esteemed our selves secure of this kind of dealing from those whom we knew to have solemnly sworne the defence of our Church-Government against the common enemy: I professe I cannot deny myamazement to see men who pretend to more then ordinary piety, fall upon their wel-deserving Brethren so openly before the Sun in contempt of God and his solemn Oath, to en∣force upon them old rotten calumnies, which cannot but fall back upon the head, not onely of the first Authors, but also with
encrease of shame upon the face of the malicious repeaters so much against all piety, charity and wisdome.
You know that one of the most false and wicked pieces that of old was written against the Church of Scotland, was Adam∣sons Declaration in the yeer 1584. it was so vile, that the Author was brought to an ingenuous confession of the shamefull and wicked lyes, whereof it was full; King James at that ve∣ry time did disclaime it under his hand, divers of our Parlia∣ments did condemne the matter of it as erroneous and wrong: That pestiferous carcasse which with all possible infamy was buried so soon as borne, and did lye quiet in its grave of shame till a full Climaterick of three score and three yeers; our good friends have been so wise for themselves, and kind to us, as to dig up its stinking bones, and to carry it from house to house, from shire to shire over all England, and where over else a printed pamphlet can goe, serving their Brethren of Scot∣land with this curtesie according to their Covenant.
And least the antick face of so long buried a body, should not have been looked upon by the multitude with any content∣ment, they did choice to be at the cost of putting it in a fine new English dresse, and setting upon its head the Cape of a royall title: All to draw the eyes of the vulgar upon it, who otherwise might have passed by it wih neglect and disdaine. In this they have put themselves to a peece of pains which I never knew or heard used with any other book: they do print it first in Master Adamsons owne old Scottish language, and thereafter tran∣slated it in good moderne English, setting before both the Ti∣tle of A Declaration made by King James in Scotland con∣cerning Church-government and Presbyters. When all this was told us, we made our addresse to the worshipfull Lycenser, intreating that a Pamphlet so extreamly injurious to our whol Church and Nation, might be smothered upon the Presse, and returned to its pit where so long it had lyen in infamy;
we were told by him that divers persons of eminency, at least for their place and present Station had strongly moved him with great importunity to give his License for its reprint∣ing: Yet that upon our so just and reasonable desires he would doe his best to stop it: hereupon we rested satisfied, being as∣sured of its suppression; notwithstanding, within two dayes after this promise it came abroad, the importunity and emi∣nency of the persons who had drawne from the Licenser his Im∣primatur, with greater ease did draw from the Presse some thousands of the printed Copies, and made them to be sold pub∣likely, to our small contentment.
While this not very pleasant morsell is lying in our stomack scarce halfe digested, behold a second dish is presented to us for to helpe our concoction of the first; Master Jo. Maxwell, late Bishop of Rosse, Excommunicate by our generall Assem∣bly, declared Incendiary by our Parliament, and made unpar∣donable in the Propositions of Peace; did write in the gall of his bitternesse a wicked Satyre against all the parts of the Government of our Church. This some three yeeres agoe the Author did print at Oxford, under the Title of an Answer by Letter, shewing how inconsistent Presbyteriall government is with Monarchy. The Cavaliers there received it with great joy, being extreamly satisfactory to their spight and revengefull humour against Scotland, which they did ordi∣narily damne and curse, as the first and greatest Fountaine of all their woes. In this the Lord gave testimony for us against them; for by a sudden and unexpected fire almost all the Co∣pies of that wicked Booke were destroyed before they were brought from the Printers Shoppe, by the strange and remark∣able accident, the mouth of the Author, and of his malignant friends at Oxford were so stopped, that we heard very little more of that Booke from them. But behold our Covenanting Brethren at London, I meane some of our Antipresbyterian
friends, tooke the courage and charity to plucke out of the fire the remainder of the Prelats labours, and misregarding not onely the sentence of men, the Acts of the generall Assembly of Scotland, and of the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, making the man an excommunicate and unpardonable Incendiary; but also the judgement of God from Heaven, who to their knowledge, had burnt the most of that Impression to ashes, not∣withstanding they will gather what was left out of the fire as a holy relict, and hug it in their bosome, till by a new Impression at London of some thousand copies, they be enabled to make it run over all the Kingdome, and so much farther as a Pamphlet hugely cryed up by their voices could flee. Our diligence to search and find out the Presse, the Licenser, and if we had pleased, the Solicitors of their former Writ, made them a little more cautious in the reprinting and publishing of this; but for all their warinesse it was visible enough, by whose industry the Books were dispersed to the Members of Parliament, and over all the City; it was knowne, by whose serious recommen∣dations, wings were set to the sides of that Fowle, that it might flee with all diligence, much farther and more quickly then the art and malice of the Malignants at Oxford were able to have carried it.
For my part, all the revenge I wish of so grievous a wrong, all the penance I would put upon the Authors and Actors therein, beside the weight of that sin and shame which they have drawne upon themselves by spreading so false and so wicked lyes of them who by solemne oath they were obliged to have defended against such injuries, shall be onely to collation at their conveniency, my subsequent Answer with their owne beloved Writs; when they have compared page with page, if they find not a satisfa∣ctory reply to every materiall passage, then with my good leave let them rejoyce in their work, and goe on to recommend to more hands the serious perusall of these two notable peices; but if so
it fall out that they find it demonstrate to their owne hearts satisfaction, that these imputations whereby they esteemed the honour of the Scottish Presbytery to be most grievously and ir∣recoverably wounded, to be nothing but most impudent calum∣nies, then I trust they will be entreated to repent of their rash∣nesse, and hereafter to be more slow in publishing or recommen∣ding infamous Libels against Nations and Churches (to whom justice, though piety and charity had both been lost, did oblige them to be friendly) before they have tryed from some who can informe what truth may be in these things, which onely enemies in the heat of their rage and revenge of supposed and mis-ap∣prehended wrongs, have invented and spread.
It had indeed been convenient that this Answer had come sooner abroad, and followed the lyars closer at the heels, but the delay was none of my fault: The Work for some time was in another far fitter hand, when necessary diversions had hindred it there to be so much as begun, and I was called unto it before I could purchase and cast over a good many Writs whereupon my discourse was necessarily to be grounded, time did slide over: & when I came to be ready, I found the Presse so much in work, or the work-men in idlenesse, that I was much dis-appointed of my hopes of so quick a dispatch as sometimes I have found; but if what I have done be well, it will not I hope come so late as to be quite out of season.
I may confesse to you, to whom I was wont to communicate the greatest of my secrets, that although at the beginning I was much averse from medling at all with this taske, yet when once I entred upon it, it became to me a very pleasant labour not onely in regard of the pregnant occasion it put in my hand to make the lyes and malice of the malignants, the impudence and rashnesse of the Sectaries against us cleere as the noon day, but specially for the opportunity which divine providence did offer so faire as I could have wished, of bringing to light before
the whole Isle the oppressed innocency of many most precious Di∣vines, who had been halfe martyred in Scotland and lay still buried too much in oblivion under their sufferings: also of re∣ctifying the mis-apprehensions which the Prelaticall party had bred in many well meaning minds both in this Isle and over Sea by their grosse mis-representations of all the opposition which in the Church of Scotland had heen made to their ty∣rannous oppressions. I was glad to be drawn by unadvisednesse of adversaries, to let the world know the plaine truth of that 17. day of December, of the Assembly at Aberdeen 1505. of the tumult at Edinborough 1637. and of many more re∣markable passages of our Ecclesiastick History, which the Prelats during their Reigne, and lately also in their rage for their ruine, were wont to set out in no other habit then of mon∣strous tragedies.
I was also glad of this nick of time when the Presbyteriall Government was comming to be set up over all England, and when a little stumbling-block was apt to make many fall, to be put to the cleering of a number of practicall passages in all the parts of that government, wherein the experience of Scotland cannot but give light to all who will follow, not them so much as the Word of God, and sound reason which first led them into their way of Presbytery, and still has kept them therein not∣withstanding of all the fraud, of all the force which the Court and clergy has imployed sometime to cheat, sometime to beat them out of that path.
It was to me a pleasant service, and abundantly recompen∣sive of it selfe to open the prisons wherein the unjustice of Pre∣lats had too too long inclosed the names and reputations of the most gracious instruments in our Church, condemning them so far as was in their power to lye in darknesse and stink unto the worlds end. I was not a little glad to be imployed in bringing forth and ushering up to the stage of this vast theater where∣upon
now we stand, those great and noble names of John Knox, John Willock, Andrew and James Melvils, Robert Bruce John Welsh, Thomas Smeiton, Iames Lauson, David Black, and divers others, from whose saces a great light does shine, and from their fame a most fragrant odour for the re∣freshing of all that comes neer them, whose senses are not ei∣ther very dull, or much corrupted. I was also content with another part of my taske, to throw downe to the dust of just con∣tempt and wel-deserved disgrace, the unhappy and infamous wretches Adamson, Spotswood, Maxwell, Balcanquell and others, who by the steps of very evill actions and great disser∣vices to their mother Church and Country, had all of them at least in hope, perked themselves up upon the pinacles of the highest honours both of our Church and State, that in the in∣dignation of God, whom they had greatly provoked, they might be tumbled downe into the more fearfull and exemplary pits of ruine.
Many of these stories I learned from your loving and kind discourse in my very childhood; of late I have endeavored to my power to encrease and make certaine that part of my knowledge by searching the chiefe Fountaines thereof as I had opportuni∣ty; for all that I say in my answer, I beleeve if I be put to it, I can give good enough authorities, and if any more be need∣full to be said, if I were beside you, and that living magazine of our whole Ecclesiastick History, most Reverend Master Catherwood, I know whence I should be abundantly furnish∣ed; however, what here I subjoine out of the little store I had at hand, I submit it to your judgement, and rest

Worster-House Iuly 29. 1646.
