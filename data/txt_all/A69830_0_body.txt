I Humbly make bold to Pre∣sent Your Lordship with this little Tract, being an Answer to a Book, Entituled, The Case of Ireland's being bound by Acts of Parliament in Eng∣land stated, Written by Wil∣liam Molyneus, of Dublin,
 Esquire. The Reason which induced me to intermeddle in a thing so much out of my Pro∣fession, as Matters of Law are, was, that I had formerly, amongst other things, discours'd on the State of Ireland, in my Essay on Trade, and offer'd it as my Opinion, That except that King∣dom was bound up more strictly by Laws made in England, it would soon destroy our Woollen Manufactory here: Where∣fore I proposed to reduce it (with respect to its Trade) to the state of our other Plantations and Settlements Abroad, which I supposed the only Means we had left to help our selves, and to
 render Ireland more useful to this Kingdom. This I humbly presented to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, and also to the Honourable the Commons of England then sitting in Parliament; which I presumed to do, because I thought I had Faithfully and Impartially discoursed on the Sub∣jects I undertook, at least I knew I had endeavoured to do so; and supposing that Book might give some beginning to the Bill for Encouraging the Woollen Manufactures in England, and restraining the Ex∣portation of the Woollen Manufactures from Ireland,
 I found my self obliged to consider the Arguments which might be brought against Ireland's being bound by Sta∣tute Laws made in England. What Success that Bill will have, I know not, but I very much fear, if something of that nature be not done, we shall soon loose that part of our Woollen Manufacture now left; which will tend to the Ruining our Poor, the Lessening the Value of the Lands of England, and depriving us of a great Number of People, who will be necessi∣tated to leave this Kingdom, and go over to Ireland, to follow their Employments there; and
 all this without rendring the Gentlemen of Ireland any sort of Advantage, that may not be made up to them another way.
This, I humbly, conceive may be done, and Ireland encoura∣ged on another Manufacture, no way Detrimental to the Interest of England, and carried on by such Methods, as may become profitable to both Kingdoms: Till this be done, I very much fear, both will be uneasie; I humbly beg your Lordship's Par∣don for my Presumption; and that you will be pleased to accept what I here offer, as from a Person who truly Honours your Lordship; and so much the more,
 because you have always Asserted the Rights and Powers of Par∣liaments. I am with all Duti∣ful respect,
Right Honourable,
