May it please Your Lordship,
SInce I am, upon many Accounts, obliged to lay the Studies and Labours of my Life at Your Lordship's Feet, it will not, I hope, be thought Pre∣sumption in me to make this following Address, which, on my Part, is an Act of Duty.

I could not omit so fair an Op∣portunity of declaring how sen∣sible I am of the Honour of be∣ing under Your Lordship's Pa∣tronage. The Pleasure of tel∣ling the World that one is rais∣ed by Men who are truly Great and Good, works too powerful∣ly to be smothered in the Breast of him that feels it; especially since a Man is rarely censured for shewing it, but is rather commended for gratifying such an Inclination, when he thank∣fully publishes to whom he is indebted for all the Comforts and Felicities of his Life.
But Your Lordship has ano∣ther Right to these Papers, which is equal to that of their

being mine: The Matter it self directs me to Your Lord∣ship as the proper Patron of the Cause, as well as of its Advocate. Those that enquire whether there is such a Spirit now in the World as animated the greatest Examples of An∣tiquity, must seek for living Instances, as well as abstract∣ed Arguments; and those they must take care to produce to the best Advantage, if they expect to convince the World that they have found what they sought for.
This therefore being the Subject of this following En∣quiry, it seemed necessary to urge the strongest Arguments

first, and to prepossess the World in favour of my Cause, by this Dedication. For those that consider that the Vertues which make up a great Cha∣racter, such as Magnanimity, Capacity for the highest Em∣ployments, Depth of Judgment, Sagacity, Elocution, and Fi∣delity, are united in as emi∣nent a Degree in Your Lord∣ship, as they are found asunder in the true Characters of the Ancient Worthies; that all this is rendred yet more Illu∣strious by Your Exemplary Pie∣ty and Concern for the Church of England, and Your Zeal for the Rights and Honour of the English Monarchy; and

last of all, that these Vertues do so constantly descend from Father to Son in Your Lord∣ship's Family, that its Colla∣teral Branches are esteemed Publick Blessings to their Age and Country; will readily con∣fess that the World does still improve, and will go no fur∣ther than Your Lordship, to si∣lence all that shall be so hardy as to dispute it.
Justice therefore, as well as Gratitude, oblige me to pre∣sent these Papers to Your Lord∣ship: Though, since I have taken the Freedom, in several Particulars, to dissent from a Gentleman, whose Writings have been very kindly received

in the World, I am bound to declare, that the chief Reason of this Address was, to let the World see, that I have a Right to subscribe my self,
May it please Your Lordship,
