RIght Honorable, and worthy honour'd Lord, as in my Trauailes, I was En∣tertain'd, welcom'd, and relieu'd by many Honou∣rable Lords, Worshipfull Knights, Esquires, Gentle∣men, and others, both in England, & Scotland. So now your Lordships Inclination hath inci∣ted, or inuited my poore Muse to shelter her∣selfe

vnder the shadow of your Honourable Patronage, not that there is any worth at all in my sterill inuention, but in all Humilitie I ac∣knowledge that it is onely your Lordships ac∣ceptance, that is able to make this no∣thing, something, and withall engage me euer.
