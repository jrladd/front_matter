SIR,
WE find that it is Customary for the Bird of Jove to carry up her unfledg'd young ones to the Sun, where if they can with undaz'led eyes, behold the glittering Beams, all suspicion of their being Spurious is taken away, After this example, with due reverence, I approach you, our Sun, and freely expose this off-spring of a penitent mind to your (some∣times) all-blinding Rayes; having a stock of assurance, equal to your own, when you described Don John; that if it can (what persons of the greatest quality formerly were not Eagles enough to do) without trembling behold your shining Case — hardn'd brow, it may pass muster all over the World, and mangre envy and mighty tydes of prejudiced Fanatical Criticks, set up for a Truth.
And truly (Reverend Sir) I should think it Incumbent on me, to be speak your Pardon for troubling you at this time of day, with a thing of this nature, did not Justice and Reason, in some mea∣sure seem to warrant the presumption: For though I must confess, I could not but suppose you as busie as any of the Rats to free your
self from the danger that threatens your Drowning Vessel, and to keep your Neck out of Jack Ketch's Noose: Yet I thought (with∣out being unjust to you and and my own Conscience) I could not rob you of the Dedication of what in every line almost shews you your self. Jupiter est quodcun{que} vides, You can see nothing in it Dirty, False, Black, Treasonable or Treacherous, but it bears your own stamp: And though you cannot properly be said to be the immediate Cause of all, yet the second causes whence those and all our National evils sprang, can be resolved into you, the Pri∣mum Mobile, or first Principle whence they had their being and motion.
There is nothing contained in the following Discourse but what, to your own knowledge, is purely matter of Fact, and an undeny∣able Truth; which therefore I choose to expose to the World, in a stile suitably plain, naked, and destitute of the gawdy flowers of Eloquence and Invention, which makes the greatest Truths more Admired, but less Authentick, more desired by curious and liquo∣rish Palates, (such as yours Doctor) but also more lyable to be suspected by the more solid and judicious part of mankind, which alone I coveted, and have endeavoured to please. And I do de∣clare Religiously in the presence of Him that knows all your se∣crets, and as I hope for any good in that day when there is to be the fulness of Retribution, that I was neither by assed by any In∣terest, nor moved by the Importunity of Friends, or the Threats of Foes, to write and publish the following Narrative; and that I can attribute the doing so to nothing, save an irresistable impulse within me, and the secret Dictates of a wounded Conscience. The load of guilt that was lodg'd in my breast was insupportable, and I could have no ease 'till I vomited up the Treasonable Subor∣natious, Briberies, Perjuries and Evil-practices which lay heavy on me, and to which for some years I have been privy, that at the sight of so much filth the World may for the future nauseate and abandon such lewd and wicked extravagancies.
I do not care for quarrelling with an old Friend, though the De∣vil; therefore I must beg, good Doctor, that you will not take up prejudice against me upon the first sight of my Narrative; for, assure your self, I design not thereby to encroach upon, or usurp any part of your right: I mean, not thereby to assert a Popish, but a
Presbyterian Plot. You are now without the fear of a Rival, left the sole Master and mannager of the former; your leading Nim∣rods are all fled, and your Fellow-Swearers seeing all going down the wind, have shaken hands with you, committing all to your own unwearied care: You may then exercise your Talent in Swearing by your self, and move in the same sphear you used to do, 'till it shall please your juster Stars to exalt you higher.
Think not by what I have said, that I am a Papist; assure your self I am neither Papist nor Presbyterian, so far from it, that I never was within the doors of a Mass-house or Conven∣ticle, but was born and brought up in the True Protestant Re∣ligion, as Established now by Law. To give an account of my Life in this place, I deem very unnecessary; I'll therefore say thus much negatively concerning my self; first, that I never took a Degree in Salamanca or elsewhere, which you are so much famous for. Secondly, that I never admired Sodomy, or spor∣ting my self with a Masculine Brawny Chamber-maid. Third∣ly, That I am not the Son of a Canting Sedition-Preaching Weaver, but of an Honest Loyal Gentleman of the County of Devon; and my Mother of the Family of the Greenfields, whose Loyalty have been always manifested by their Sufferings for His late Majesty; My Grand-father perishing in Prison in London: My Uncle Major Greenfield Murdered by the Rebels at Plimouth, for endeavouring to obtain that Garrison for His Majesty, &c. And most of my Relations falling into the Hands of the damnable Sequestrators, for which my self and whole Family suffer to this day, further I will not mention to vindicate my self, or to take away the stains which guilt left upon my Soul, for
— Quae non fecimus ipsi
vix ea nostra voco —
But to return to the Plot; I dare not say there was no Popish-Plot, though at the same time it is my belief there was not the hundred part of what was pretended; but that the few true cir∣cumstances that were found, were improved to that height by your Industry, and the Treachery of the Fanaticks to serve for a stalking-horse to hide your own, till with more security you
could destroy the Government. Therefore I ll even rest my self satisfied as to this point, with the Opinion of the Author of that Letter to Mr. Settle, occasioned by his Recanting Narra∣tive, which you may see from his own words no fol∣loweth.Postscript Page 14. As for the Popish-Plot, though my ap∣prehensions of it are not altogether so dreadful to make me go mad for fear of Consecrated Knives, Black-Bills, Jago-Pilgrims, French Armies, &c. Yet I am not for ex∣ploding quite the thoughts of some Designs managed by the Roman Catholicks for promoting their own Religion, by extirpating all whom they call Hereticks, since there were many true circumstances, though dash'd with Contradicti∣ons, and now and then a few false Oaths. For we know very well 'tis possible the game may be up, though many of the Eager Mongrel Whelps in the deep mouth'd pack of Evidences out-run the scent and hunted Counter. But on the other hand, I would have men not be altogether so in∣tent upon those glowing Embers, as not to discern the Bel∣lows (that is the Presbyterians) that blew them into a flame.
It may possibly be thought by some, that I dare not assert what I now do, but in the interval of Parliaments; and that this Nar∣rative, were it now Parliament time, dare not look abroad into the World: I declare my resolution of standing by it when ever a Parliament sits; and (if need require) of sealing the truth thereof with my Blood. For it was once my dying resolution, and since I never found my self in the least inclining to alter it. In March last being justly visited for my sins with a severe sit of Sickness from the Almighty, and having little or no hopes or prospect of recovering, I sent for a Friend, and made it my request to him, that if it should please God to call me away at that time, he would take care to have the following Discourse Printed and pub∣lished for the satisfaction of the World, declaring to him upon the word of a dying man, that there was nothing in it, but what was sincere and true; which he faithfully promised to see dome. But it pleasing the all merciful God to raise me up once more to perform this great duty my self; I think I ought not to be either ashamed or afraid to declare those notorious Truths before an
Earthly which then I was willing, and expected, and at last must, lay open before the Heavenly Tribunal.
And I hope the next Parliament will be men of greater, no∣bler and more Loyal Principles than to discountenance any thing that may tend (as the detecting these Subornations, Perjuries, &c. do) to the preservation of His Majesty, the Queen, and his Royal Highness, and to the bringing all Perjurers, Suborners, and other Enemies of the Government, to condign Punishment: Which time when God shall be pleased to grant us; Doctor you may expect to be Famous, as most that ever march'd through Holbourn: till which, I will, what you your self must do at last leave you upon God and your Country, and so
Farewel.
