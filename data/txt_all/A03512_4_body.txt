IOine, Noblest Earle, in giuing worthy grace,
To this great gracer of Nobilitie:
See here what sort of men, your honor'd place
Doth properly command; if Poesie
(Profest by them) were worthily exprest.
The grauest, wisest, greatest, need not, then,
Account that part of your command the least;
Nor them such idle, needlesse, worthlesse Men.
VVho can be worthier Men in publique weales,
Then those (at all parts) that prescrib'd the best?
That stird vp noblest vertues, holiest zeales;
And euermore haue liu'd as they profest?
A world of worthiest Men, see one create,
(Great Earle); whom no man since could imitate.
