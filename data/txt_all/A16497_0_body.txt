THE saying of one (Right Worship∣full) is most true:French hist. 1187. Compare vice with vice, and euill with euill: Ingratitude is the most odi∣ous and the worst. Vitium om∣nium

Theodoric. dom. 14. post. trin. p. 2. d. 3. Ingratum si dixeris omnia dixeris. teterrimorum teterri∣mum, of all foulest vices the most foule, admitting no pa∣ralell.
