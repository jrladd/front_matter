SIR,
THat I presume to present this little Treatise un∣to you, is not my respect

only but your right: your interest in all, the Au∣thor, the Worke, and Publication, doth more then require it: For the Treatise it selfe, besides the matter which is excel∣lent, the art shewed in it, I conceive is such as may bee exemplary. For the Author, as no man knew him better than your selfe, of whom I have heard you say, That you esteemed your selfe much honoured, in presenting him to the Rectory of Brompton∣brian,

where he con∣tinued a burning and a shining light above twenty yeares toge∣ther, so no man can bet∣ter testifie with me, that his name is as an oint∣ment newly powred out, and all the house of God where he was knowne, is filled with the odour of it. The sweetnesse of his voice still Ecchoes in the eares of many precious soules which hung upon his lippes, whilst with the wise Preacher hee taught the people knowledge, yea

gave good heed, and sought to finde out acceptable words, and words of truth, sound speeches sea∣soned with salt, and mi∣nistring both delight and grace to the hearers. And like a wise and faithfull steward of the mysteries of God, he hath left behind him many written treasu∣ries, so plentifully stored with such spirituall Pro∣vision, that future ages would rise up and call him blessed, if his own works should stand forth to praise him in the gate.

Wherein as no man living hath more interest then your selfe, so I know no man more able by experi∣ence to commend them to the Church of God for excellent. If this breake the way, no paines of mine shall bee wanting, if you please to bring any of the rest out after it. In the meane time I should have thought my selfe guilty in some kind of Sacriledge, if I had not given way to the publishing of this un∣to the good, I trust, of ma∣ny, which by experience

hath beene found already, not acceptable onely but profitable also unto some. So submitting the rest of my thoughts and desires in this businesse unto Yours; I rest as I am ma∣ny wayes obliged to be,
