My LORD,
WHere a Truth of Meritt hath
a generall warrant, There
Loue is but a Debt, Acknow∣ledgement
a Iustice. Greatnesse
cannot often claime Virtue by
Inheritance; Yet in this,
YOVRS appeares most Emi∣nent,
for that you are not more rightly Heyre to
your Fortunes, then Glory shalbe to your Memory.
Sweetenesse of disposition ennobles a freedome
of Birth; in BOTH, your lawfull Interest adds
Honour to your owne Name, and mercy to my
presumption. Your Noble allowance of These
First Fruites of my leasure in the Action, embol∣dens
my confidence, of your as noble constructi∣on
in this Presentment: especially since my Ser∣uice
must euer owe particular duty to your Fa∣uours,

by a patticular Ingagement. The Grauity
of the Subiect may easily excuse the leightnesse of
the Title: otherwise, I had beene a seuere Iudge a∣gainst
mine owne guilt. Princes haue vouchsaf't
Grace to trifles, offred from a purity of Deuotion,
your Lordship may like wise please, to admit into
your good opinion, with these weake endeuours,
the constancy of Affection from the sincere Louer
of your Deserts in Honour
