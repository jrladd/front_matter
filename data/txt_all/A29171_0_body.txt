Noble and Learned Sir,
HAd I had no other knowledge of your eminent Worth and Qua∣lity, but what was transmitted to me by common fame (which places you, and that deservedly in the first Rank of our most knowing and Religious Gentry) that alone would have suf∣ficiently warranted me in this Addresse, since those who shine like you, in so vigorous and active a Sphere of constant and unblemished Piety, may easily excuse the careful Beholder, if he turn his body with some kind of parti∣cular Respect & Observance towards them. But when to this general Account, which claimes a Reverence from all, there is super∣added an Intention you long have had, to
shew me some personal kindness (which you have lately performed, with very many Noble and Obliging Circumstances) I could no longer be just, either to my own Resent∣ments of Gratitude, or to the Expectation of others, should I not have taken the very first Opportunity of manifesting to the world, how much I think you are to be honoured; and how fit to be proposed as a Publick Pat∣tern. For others of mean Endowments, and narrow Fortunes, to be well principled in vertue, or to take a little compass of Learning in their way to Preferment; this carries with it no singular commendation, for in such, ne∣cessity may seem to make their choyce for them; but for one in the greatest outward af∣fluence, & in the midst of the most charming Temptations, both from Honour & Pleasure, to preserve an unspotted integrity, and to keep himself free and dis-interessed; for the pursuit only of what is truly Great and No∣ble; this is a degree of Excellence, which God vouchsafes to very few: And, Sir, you are one of those, in whose manner of Life and Stu∣dies, we may read, that such kind of rare ex∣amples are not wholly discontinued; but God shews he hath a Care of this Age also, how corrupt soever, in that he hath given you, as Salt, to season it.

But while others are taken up with admi∣ring, what you set the lowest value upon, your accurate Learning, and through Insight into the profoundest depths of Philosophy, together with a Masculine and Clean Expres∣sion, give me leave to take notice of that, which I have often in private Wondred at, your strict and impartial search into the my∣steries of Christian Religion, which, while o∣thers pass lazily over, or take the belief of them upon trust, you have made it your bu∣siness severely to examine; and thence have arrived to such an height of Assurance, that you can look down upon those Objections & Difficulties, where with puzling Disputers do trouble both themselves and others, with a fixed and steady eye; and only pity those poor mistaken Rationalists, who seek for satisfacti∣on, where it is not to be had; like Saul, who consulted with a Witch, when none but the Lord could truly answer him.
I cannot therefore wish an higher Elogy, to this small Treatise, then that it were as fit for your view, as you are able to judge of it; For you, Sir, are experimentally acquainted with the Truth it contains; and can demonstrate from the most undoubted Testimony, that God hath a little number in the world,
whom in spite of Hell or Heresies, he is resol∣ved to save; and therefore by state-Arts and Politick Contrivances, to labour the Preven∣tion of Heresies, it is as to the Elect, a needless, as to Reprobates an unprofitable care, and un∣warrantable to both, since, when the Scripture tels us, there must be Heresies; they only take the way to perpetuate them, who endeavour their suppression, by waies which that Word hath not warranted. As winds, till they are pent up & restrained from their motion, do seldom any hurt; so nor Heresies neither, till they are imposed and forced, they make no publick disturbance. The world would never have been Arian heretofore, nor Antichristi∣an now, did not Princes lend their Power to the Beast, to make it kill, whom it cannot con∣fute. That all mens Eyes may be opened to see that Christian Religion, which is the Pow∣er of God, needs not any Assistance from the undue Power of man, and that you, whose eies are already opened, may be long Preserved for the Information and Example of others, is, and shall be the constant Prayer of
Drury Lane, Jan. 10, 1661.
NOBLE SIR,
