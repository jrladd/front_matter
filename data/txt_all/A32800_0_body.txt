My Lord,
AFter I had received your Lordships Command for Preaching, which it be∣came me neither to resist nor dispute; debating with my self what Subject were most proper to in∣sist upon in such an Assembly; I de∣termined at last upon this of Confirma∣tion, which for many years hath been much in my thoughts, those excellent words of the Learned and Reverend Dr. Hammond, having long since left in me a very deep impression;
De Con∣firm. Praef. § 7, &c.
That since the Faith it self once delivered, and the two Sacraments of the New Covenant, instituted by Christ him∣self, and strictly commanded unto all; there is nothing which can
more strongly oblige to a sincere, perpe∣tual, and durable obedience unto the Evangelical Law; nothing from the diligent and prudent administration whereof more plentiful Fruits may be hoped by the Christian Church; and nothing, lastly, whose neglect or over∣ly performance (pro forma & ex opere, ut aiunt, operato) seemeth more perni∣cious and destructive unto piety.
When therefore I had digested my Meditations and Collections upon this Argument into the ensuing method, (which is the onely thing almost peculiar to them) I could not easily be divert∣ed to any other Theme, had Time per∣mitted a longer deliberation; though to some this might seem (as matters fell out) the less opportune by reason of your Lordships absence, necessitated by those Infirmities of Age and Bodily Indispositions, which then with a more than ordinary violence arrested your person, to your own regret, un∣doubtedly
upon this account, no less than our unhappiness.
Among the Hearers notwithstanding it met with a candid entertainment and general welcom; and so I hope it may do when it comes thus abroad into the world, (enlarged and attend∣ed with another practical Discourse to the same purpose) on no other design than to promote a common good.
And I am the rather moved to Print it at this juncture of time, because over and above the usefulness of the parti∣cular subject, it contains a most convi∣ctive evidence and demonstration on the behalf of Diocesan Episcopacy, (which some have spitefully renewed their old grudge and quarrels against) and the possibility of exercising Discipline in a Diocesan Church, did not the too culpa∣ble neglects of many among us add too keen an edge to that exception.
Now that it may shew it self with the greater confidence of success, as it
was penn'd and uttered in obedience to your Lordships injunction, so the Au∣thor of it most humbly betakes him∣self to your Lordships Patronage, cra∣ving a benign and favourable recepti∣on from your Paternity, of this small Present and Pledge of that great Ob∣servance, which is ever due from,
