MAdam, behold, your vertues doe in∣tice
The best of art to write the worst of vice,
That as the beautious forme of chri∣stall light,
Opposde to darknesse seemes more richly-bright:
So from the times worst obiects you may spie,
How vertue shines best by her contrarie,
And best doth edifie, when to our sense,
She seemes to vertue in her innocence,
Like some cleare liquid cloud against the Sunne
In proudest formes of opposition,
Heere shall you see the Anatomie of times
And imperfections bowelld with the crimes
Of brazen impudence condemn'd to death,
Like Traytors breathing an infectious breath.
From your sweet fauours I began this booke:
And hope a faire successe from your faire looke:
As earth to heauen presented to our sense

Seemes but a point to the circumference,
Compar'd to his large bodie: so in show
Are these my studies vnto that Iowe,
Vnto your Ladiship: this mite shall speake
My Art and Hart both gratefull, although weake,
As Dwarfes seeme gracious, so may proue this elfe.
This booke, though small, may teach great time it selfe.
