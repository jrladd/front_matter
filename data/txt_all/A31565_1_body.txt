KNowing how great a Lover and Admirer you both are and have been of Learning and Arts, from your Minority, and in how great a measure you have tasted of those Springs of Learning, from one of the most famous Fountains of Education in this Land, did induce and embolden me to present you with a small Product of some studious hours, which I have at vacant times employed in the Art or rather Science of ARITHMETICK, it being

Customary to make an Offering of the First-Fruits to the best of Friends. So an humble Acknowledgment of those many Favours and Obligations I have received from you and your respected Family, I here prostrate these my First-Fruits at your Feet, hoping you will find them both pleasant and easie of Digestion, beseeching your favourable and kind Acceptance, and to vouchsafe it your Protection at its launching forth into the wide Sea of this World, from the Blasts of Ignorance or Envy, and as in Duty I stand obliged to pray for the eternal Happiness of you and yours, I rest
