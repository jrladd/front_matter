VNto the prospect of your Wisedomes eies
I Consecrate these Epithalamies.
Not that I thinke them worthy of your view,
But for in loue my thoughts are bound to you:
I doe confesse my selfe vnworthy far
To write, in such high causes as these are,
Which, Homer, Virgill nor the fluent Tully,
In fitting terms could scarce expresse them fully:
But since the Muses did their bounties showe,
And on me did poore Poesy bestowe,
I hold it best to play the thankefull man,
To spend their guiftes the best wayes that I can,
And not like pedling Bastards of the Muses,
That Like to Lawyers liue on Times abuses.
Thus vnto you I giue it as it is,
Desiring pardon where ther's ought amisse.
Your Worships euer to be comâˆ£maunded in all integritie:
.
