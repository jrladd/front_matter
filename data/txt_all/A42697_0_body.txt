My Friends,
AT the Motion of your late deceased Father, which I could not withstand, this home-spun Discourse was Preached on the Subject, which was his own Choice; and is to satisfie his Desire, (in this plain Dress) now pre∣sented unto you: His Design in Printing it was (as he told you) to keep him fresh in your Memory, that the Proverb might not be verified in you, Out of Sight, and out of Mind; and (without doubt) to remember you of that which was then coming upon him. Plain Discourses, if pertinent, do best suit with Funeral Sermons: Had it been preached in a loftier strain, as possibly I could have done, if the occasion would have permitted it, it might have pleased itching Ears, and curious Palates, but would have been of little Ʋse unto mean Capacities, the Welfare of whose Souls in Preaching ought to be respected. I therefore did think it best to use the plainest Language, that all might understand: And if the Lord will add his Blessing, that all might be pro∣fited thereby, who were Auditors, or into whose Hand it may come to be read. Not making use of Notes in Preaching it can∣not rationally be supposed, that my Memory should be so tena∣cious, as to retain every Word or Sentence that was delivered, or that there should be no Omission, Addition, or Alteration;
yet I have recollected as much as I could: And what is emitted, added, or altered, I hope will be no prejudice to the Truth then sisted on: Neither can it be thought that a pit a Nemen should as much affect the Heart of the Reader, as Preaching, wa vote, might do the Hearer: There is as much difference usually between Reading and Hearing, as there is between cold Meat and hot, although the Meat be the same,  an hungry Stomach may make a good Meal of it; or as there is let een Drink when the Vessel is newly broached, witch is quick and palatable, and when it is at the bottom, and is become flat, and untastable, yet it may serve to quench the Thirst. The Subject treated on is very frequent and com∣mon, and yet too little to awaken and rouse up our sleepy and slothful Hearts to serious diligence in and about the great Concernments of our Souls; for Eternity, was that great and necessary Truth which my Text holdeth forth; throughly be∣lieved, it would produce better Effects in the Lives of Men, than do appear generally in the World. That which will cer∣tainly, and must unavoidably come upon us, and how soon, and how suddenly it may come, and by what means, we know not; and is of the highest Importance, and deserveth the greatest and deepest Consideration, is that which my Text doth acquaint us with, and the ensuing Discourse doth call for, and press unto. That this Ʋse may he made of it by you (my Loving Friends) and many others that heard it, and others that may read it, is the Cordial Desire of
