Right Honourable & Right Worshipfull,
ALthough I very well know, that no man (almost) in handling any politique dis∣course, could euer satisfie the expecta∣tion of such as were skilfull, or vn∣skilfull
 in the exercising, acting, and managing of such affaires: the one, because they could not vnderstand: the other, for that they were (most what) too curious, neuer regarding any thing more, then the vse thereof for seruing the time present: yet for the great re∣spect I haue euer borne to the Ho∣nourable Citie of London (wherein I haue had the most part of my liuing and abiding,) and (in particular) to your Honour, and Worships the wor∣thy gouernours therof (whom I know to be iudicious, yet free from curiosity) I haue aduentured to propound to the world my priuate conceipts touching that subiect. May it please your Ho∣nour and Worships therefore (till bet∣ter grow) to accept these first fruits of my barren-braine, and by your fauou∣rable
 approuing of them, to protect & defend them against the snarlings of blacke-mouth'd Momists, who are euer more ready to carpe at other mens writings, then to amend them, or to suf∣fer any of their owne once to view the light. The matter I borrowed (as you may perceiue) out of the best and most approued Authours and Historiogra∣phers: the forme, frame and dispositi∣on of the worke is mine owne, which (such as it is) together with my best seruices, I commend to your Honour and Worships, and your selues to the grace of God, and so rest,
