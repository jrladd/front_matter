WHEN I came to Marpurg (Most no∣ble Prince) your Doctour promotor layd among positiones of al faculties, this one against me: quidam autumat Descendere ad inferos in sacro Symbolo, esse idem quod ascendere ad coelos, quod nos non credimus. And they re∣quested me to dispute: vvher I shevved that, all dead, be inferi, all vvhose soules be in Heaven: & euerie taking of a lourney is descendere by scripture speach. And yf an horse die: antiquitie held it enough to say, he vvas dead: but for men, they toke more in their mouth: as,
; is he dead & gone to the dwellinges of Hades.
And all Heathen vvold expound our Symbolū of faith to meane as the Gospel▪ that our Lord vvēt from hēce to the most happy lodge of the happy. Ma¦nie

milliones in England think so: your tendered the truly learned D. Fortius thinketh so: & since I ope∣ned the cause, the flour of Christendome thinketh so: though the Cyclopes of Aetna vvold haue svva∣lovved me up in their Gehennean torment. The Se¦natours yelded, and svvare a great oth, that they vvold teach the teachers, to use strangers better. Novv a Ievv hath dealt openly against me: vvher in your Doctours take vvith him, against my E∣brevv bookes to your Highnes and to your Brother the Grave of Hanavv. You haue sene both transla∣ted. I defend the Gospel: Yf Papist or Caluinistes doe cross, I vvil combat. Your Highnes may tell your Doctours of flight or fight. It is not vvell, that men teach, vvhat they haue not learned themselues.
