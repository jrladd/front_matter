MArvell not, Readers, that I set be∣fore
you but this Pittance: I was
loth to cloy your Appetites at the
first, knowing (on the one side)
that mens quesy and squemish stomacks rellish
better the poinant suckets of a Love-Sonnet, or
the Iulips of a frothy Epigram, than a Homely
(though holesom) dish of Satyricall stuffe: And
fearing withall (on t'other side) lest having coo∣ked
a great deale of this hard and sower-Meat
ill, I might have so distasted a truely judicious
Palat, as to have made it even sicke with Loa∣thing,
being not able by Reason of the Quality
(much more the Quantity) without great an∣noyance,
to concoct it. In this therefore (in coo∣king
I meane) if I have greatly failed, I will
willingly cry Peccavi, and herein offend no
more: if not, (God helping) present you with
the second and third course. In the mean-time,
Gentlemen, rest you consent.
