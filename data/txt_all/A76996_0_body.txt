Honoured Sir,
KNowing you to be a true Son of Hermes, and a de∣lightful Student in the Courts of Vrania, it is no small encouragement in this at∣tempt of mine, in chusing you to pa∣tronize this piece of Hermetical Philosophy: it is but a Translation, and, as I doubt not but you are well acquainted with the Authors in the original; so I presume you will a∣ctum agere, peruse them again in

their new Garments; acceptably hearing them speak English. Let me therefore request you to take this little stranger into your tuiti∣on and patronage, and with your judicious eye to examine and cor∣rect my Errata's; relying upon the candor of your ingenuity and learn∣ing, that thereby I may be the better fortified, and securely armed against the batteries of ignorance; and that your protection may quench the fi∣ery Beacons of the envious Criticks. And thus wishing both you and your studies a Crown of happiness in this terrene Theatre, and eternal glory everlastingly, I ake leave to subscribe my self

LONDON, 8 November, 1656.
