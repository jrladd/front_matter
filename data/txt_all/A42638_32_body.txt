DUring your Journeys to Spain, objects of note could not escape your particular Observations; as St. Jeronimo called the Es∣curial, which hath almost as many Courts, as some Pa∣laces Roomes, and is a Bo∣dy Solid like a Rock; Nor will the Magnificent Seil∣ings, and Carved Doors of the Palace at Sigovia have mist your Annotations; So that this Treatise of Buil∣ding,

cannot likewise but be acceptable to you, as directed to a Person who can with more convenien∣cy acquaint his Grace the Duke of Albemarle, of what use it may prove to those that will not spend time, money, nor materials in vain; which is also one of the causes of producing it unto you,
Sir,
