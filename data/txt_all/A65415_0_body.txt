SIR,
THE Great Patrons
of Liberty have not
thought it below
them to become the
Patrons of History:
And any thing of that kind which
concerns England, does naturally

claim the Protection of a Prince,
who by his Valour and Conduct
has not only Restor'd to the English
Nation that Figure they had lost in
the World for near an Hundred
Years past, but has rais'd them to a
Greater than ever they had before:
A Prince, who in all He has done
for the Common Safety of Europe,
could have no Brighter Examples to
follow, than those of his own Fa∣mily:
For when Others have fought
for Dominion and Power, vain
empty Notions, and destructive to
Mankind; It has ever been a Glory
peculiar to the House of Nassau to
have fought for LIBERTY, the
Noblest Cause, and the Greatest
Stake that Mortals can contend
for.
Let some Princes pretend to Fa∣ding
Lawrels, by depopulating
Countries, oppressing their Neigh∣bours,

and enslaving Free People;
The surest and best way to transmit
a Glorious Name to Posterity, is to
relieve the Oppress'd, break off their
Fetters, and set the World free.
These require no varnish to set
off their true Lustre; whilst those
are oblig'd to make use of false
Colours to palliate the highest In∣justice.
Let them value themselves
upon a Greatness that's borrow'd
from Schemes that could hardly
fail, as being transmitted to them
from the long Experience of the
Ablest Ministers, and most Refin'd
Statesmen of the Age: That Prince,
who without these Helps at his first
Appearance on the Stage, has by the
mere Strength of his own Genius
surmounted Difficulties that would
have pall'd any Courage but his
own; and at length has broke all
those Measures that had of a long

time been concerting towards the
enslaving of Christendom; cannot
fail to make one of the Noblest
and Brightest Figures in History.
If it be the Prerogative of an
Almighty Power and Goodness to
set Bounds to the Raging Sea, it
must be the highest and most justi∣fiable
Imitation of It, to put a Stop
to the Ambition of Men, and to
shelter Nations from their Fury.
It is in this sense chiefly, that
Kings may be called Gods: And
it were a pity that the Lives of
such were not as Immortal as their
Deeds.
The Memory of that Prince
must be lasting, who in all the Wars
he has been engag'd in, and in all
the Treaties that have been made
to restore Peace to his Countrey,
has never made any Terms for Him∣self;
except once, when the Interest

of Three Kingdoms, and his Own,
were become one and the same.
When succeeding Ages shall see
scarce any other Coin in England
but of one Stamp, they must look
back with Amazement upon the
Reign of a Prince whose Image it
bears; and wonder how it was pos∣sible,
That during the Heat of the
most Expensive War that ever was,
so vast a Treasure could be new
minted, and at so prodigious a Loss:
While at the same time they will
commend and bless a People, that
with so much Cheerfulness assisted
Him with Supplies suitable to such
Mighty Undertakings. They will
be no less surpriz'd to find, That
amidst a great many Hardships and
Disappointments which could not
be avoided, his Armies follow'd
Him with an Inviolable Fidelity
and Inimitable Courage: And will

hardly believe, That it was within
the Compass of Human Prudence
to Cement so many Jarring Inte∣rests,
and unite so many Princes of
different Religions into one Alli∣ance,
and to influence their firm
Adherence to that Alliance, till the
Glorious Conclusion of a General
Peace.
SIR,
All these Great Things were re∣serv'd
for Your MAJESTY,
which will be Admir'd and Extoll'd
by Posterity, no less than they are
by the present Age: And it's but
reasonable that the Memory of such
Actions should live for ever. The
following Sheets, containing a Short
View of the various Disposition of
Affairs in England for a whole Cen∣tury
before Your MAJESTY's
Happy Accession to the Crown, I

humbly beg Leave to Lay them at
Your MAJESTY's Feet, with
the most profound Submission and
Duty, that becomes,
May it please Your Majesty,
