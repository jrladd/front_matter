Sir,
YOur former favours ob∣lige
me to a votal, if
not total requital, at
least to an acknowledgement,
though't be but in this slight
Commemoration, and so near

alliance may command this Dedi∣cation.
I might have elected some
titular Protector to cherish this
weak Infant of my Braine; but
I content my self with an inferiour
choise, desiring your self my tu∣telar
Patron. Accept of these
my poor labours, which were the
selected object of my Meditations,
on purpose to keep me from idle∣nesse,
the mother of all mischief.
That excellent saying of St Hie∣rome
egg'd me on to these Medi∣tations:
A liquid operis facito,
ut te Diabolus inveniat occu∣patum;
non enim facilè capitur
à Diabolo, qui bonovacat exer∣citio:
Be alwayes doing some∣thing,
that so the Devil may finde
thee imployed; for he is not easi∣ly

caught in the Devils snare, who
is well busied. Sir, were there
not Lectores who be Lictores, or
could all my Readers be free from
the aspersion of critically censo∣rious,
I could well afford to imi∣tate
my Author; Commend my
book to the Reader, and my self to
you: however let it be so, I'l
expose my selfe to charitable
judgements, and venture it.
Inveniat noster Patronum ut ubi{que}
libellus,
Librum Lectori dedico, mè{que} tibi.
Your Worships affectionate
Friend and Kinsman
to commend,
