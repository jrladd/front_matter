SIr, I have, not without smiling, observed how some doating Dogma∣tists of late, pretending to a Gravity some Centuries higher then the Age they live in, have scouled upon intitling Epistles, and by an affected Mo∣rosity have attempted to ex∣plode this honest way of Dedi∣cation. I like not the humour at all; it hath too much of the
Proud, or the Peevish, or both, in it. These sullen Sirs, under pretence that they are afraid to be thought to fawn upon others, do most notoriously flatter them∣selves: He is certainly the Grand Opinator, that dares face this Age of Vertuoso's single, and venture abroad with no better countenance then his own. Let Brutes creep into the World without help: to Convoy a Youngling into its first light, is nearer of kin to Humanity. Away then with such rude severities, let them be Tubb'd up with old Repro∣bate Philosophy! Give me a Patron; and, if I may chuse, give me him that none can give but your self, that is, your self.

Live, Great Exemplar of Piety, Prudence and Loyalty, and whatever may intitle to Glory and Vertue: and live
again. Live in your self, and live in your son; all that know you both, hope so, pray so: there's but that one Copy of you, but it is a fair one, a full one; and may happy Posterity speak you both to the World. Honour, Blessing, and immortality be up∣on your Name. These are no seldom ingredients in the pray∣ers of, Sir,
