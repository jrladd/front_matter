SIR,
IT is not any great Opinion I have of my pre∣sent Performance,

(though there are some who would perswade me, that it is not altogether despicable) that makes me presume to prefix your Name before it.
Indeed, amongst Men of Sense and Learning, Truth for the most Part brings

it's own Recommen∣dation along with it, and finds that Can∣did and ready Re∣ception which it de∣serves. But the Gene∣rality of Mankind will not relish any thing, that bears not in the Front some great and eminent Name.
And for this Rea∣son it is, that I have made bold to make this Dedication.
Your real Worth which hath deser∣vedly placed you in two Eminent Sta∣tions, to both which you do more Ho∣nour than you re∣ceive from them: And the Encouragement

and Favour you shew to all Persons of In∣dustry, Vertue and good Learning under your Government, soon determined me in the Choice of such a Patron; though my small Share of each of the latter, could merit neither of the former.
And here, accord∣ing to the usual Mode of Dedicati∣ons, I might easily enlarge upon so fair a Character; But as it is your peculiar Delight to oblige & do good with all the ease and sweetness imaginable, so with as little Noise and Ostentation possible:

And I should sooner hope for your Par∣don for this Pre∣sumption and the Faults of my Book, than for such an At∣tempt upon your Modesty.
I shall therefore only add, that you would be pleased to accept this as a Testi∣mony

of my Duty and Gratitude, and that I shall always remain,
Reverend SIR,
