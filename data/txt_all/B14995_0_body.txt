MY Muse infor'st by Fortunes first extreame,
To leaue the Eden of my soules desire,
Which Isis waters with her siluer streame,


Vnto my natiue Thames did backe retire;
Where maz'd to see so many various shapes,
Of wanton vice, the Furies she doth raise
With snakie whips to scourge such idle Apes,


But least she proue to weake in these essayes
(Faire Plant of hope) some branch of safetie yeild,
Vpon the which my forlore Muse may lite,
And if for vertues ske you deigne to sheild,
Her poore endeuours 'gainst the powr'e of spight;


More pleasing numbers, she too light shall bring,
Though hoarse with griefe, she now can hardly sing.
