Right Honourable,
I Hope your Lordship will be pleased to pardon the Authors presumption in his humble Dedication to your Lord∣ship, of this small De∣scription of the prime
 Authors and Contri∣vers of the most Horrid Murther that ever was committed in the Face of the Sun; For such I am sure your Lordship did alwaies account that of our late Soveraign, and such likewise was it look't upon by all Truly and Pi∣ously Ingenious in the whole World.
Farre be it from me to have the least thought, that my mean Pen should draw
 a Lively Representation of his late Majesties (both) naturall and acquired ver∣tues shining with so much splendor through the Darke and thick Clouds of his Af∣flictions; yet to the end the world might see the Black∣nesse of the Designes of these Miserable Men, who so wickedly persecuted our Soveraign like a Partridge upon the top of the Mountaines. I have at the close hereof attempted some∣thing
 that might make them appear the more Wicked, by how much they Murthered so Pious, so Incomparable a Prince.
My LORD, You had your share of the miseries in those times, and your Life was hunted after by these Blood-Hounds. The re∣markable passages of whose Lives and Deaths are here presented to your Lordships View; this being but as an Essay to what hereafter shall
 be set forth in a greater Vo∣lume.
And now may your Lordship Live to see Peace Flourish all your time, and may your Children inherit he Blessing thereof, as well as your outward substance; May your Lordships Loy∣alty (which cannot be ex∣ceeded) be Copied out by them; and may the reward of your Fidelity and Con∣stancy be an immortall Crown when God shall
 take you to his owne King¦dome, is the Prayer of,
