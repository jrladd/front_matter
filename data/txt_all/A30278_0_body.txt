Sirs,
I thankfully remember all your old true Love. And, by your frequent Salu∣tations, I am comfortably assured of it's continuance. Having not any thing bet∣ter, I Re-salute you all together, with this Fragment.
I intreat that your Children may be exercised in Learning to Understand them and Recite them. Especially those Chil∣dren whom I Baptized; and do with an especial Affection remember.
This Inscription obtains its end; if it certifie you, that You and Yours live in the affectionate memory, of one that sticks not, to go out of the common Road to fetch in one Soul unto Jesus Christ.
