READER,
SHall I finde thee, this in cap∣tious
Age, but un-biassed, or
unprejudicate, I shall look upon
thee as upon some Rare Philip∣pian,
in the midst of a crooked,
and Perverse Generation. If
Capricious, and Censorious,
I meet with no worse Measure
then I look for, in these Dayes,
wherein Ignorance, and, its in∣separable
companion, Impudence,
are every Day Riding in
their Triumphant Chariots of
Countenance, and Encourage∣ment;

whilest Pure, Ortho∣doxe,
Knowledge is still Qua∣relled,
and Censured; and
therefore is fain, as a poor Pedee,
to stand upon its weak Guard
of Vindication. And this is the
sole Ground of the Publication
of these Ensuing Treaties; for
that some Black Mouths, which
have none, the last, appearance
of Cadour in them, have, Eo
Nomine, Traduced them; for
that they have too closely Troden
upon the Heels of Truth. How∣ever,
the observance of the wind
of any Mans Breath, though
never so strong, and Poisonous,
shall in no wise discourage me
from sowing me Righteousness;
however an Harvest of Mercy,

yea but of Justice, may not yet
perhaps bee expected by mee.
Mean while, as I know, that the
Sermons, Preached, sufficiently
justifie God the Father, in
his Providence; and God the
Sonne in his Just Proceedings:
So am I confident, that Printed,
they will vindicate, the Author,
in the Eyes of all Sober-Minded
Men, against all calumnious
Aspersions. So that, he, that
by the Malevolo's of the Time,
whilest he is overshadowed with
the Dark cloud of their Black
Censure, may appear a Mon∣strous
Bug bear, shall (not
unlikely yet) in these poore
Peices, when they shall come to
be exposed to the Light of Pub∣like

View, not be conceived to
be of so Dreadul a shape. Who,
what ever he may appear, is far
from professing himself
