MADAM,
THE Honour I re∣ceive by Acquain∣tance with YOU, and the Illustrious Vertues with which You
are, I know [Beyond a Stranger's Credit] so Extra∣ordinarily Bless'd, has [since the Departure of that Friend [in Obedience to whom this Trifle was at first design'd] peculiarly obliged me to pre∣sent it at Your Ladyship's Feet.
I am sorry, for Your sake, it is not as I could wish it Compos'd, [I have Higher Thoughts on this Subject, which I cannot yet express.] But Your Honour will consider, 'tis a Work of YOUTH; and for several Private Reasons by none Review'd
till it pass'd from the Press.
I am not for Tedious DEDICATIONS; in them I had rather speak Less than More than the Ingenuous Modesty of such Persons as Your LADYSHIP will permit. [For You are above the want of an EN∣COMIUM, and I may be easily thought guilty of that Flattery I hate,] so I would conclude [with my Hearty PRAYERS to Almighty GOD, that it may please Him to be still Your GUIDE,
till You arrive at Eternal Rest.]

Kensing∣ton, Jan. 12. 1694/5.
