SIR:
THe Capitoll began, and the Louvre hath revived this Historie, which J present to your Majestie, amidst pub∣lique applauses for the happinesse of your Monarchie. It is a Mirror that flat∣tereth not, but rather a pure and Chry∣stalline water, which, at the same instant it sheweth the staine taketh it away. You (Sir) shall therein behold, that a Prince ought to be verie carefull to conserve his Authoritie entire: Great ones here may learne, it is not good to play with the generous Lion, though he suffer it, and that favours are precipices for such, as abuse them.
