GREAT SIR,
To whom can this Complaint, made by the Genius of Ireland, be so justly Dedicated, as to that General, on whom Her Eyes are fix'd, as design'd to be Her Glorious Deliverer? Whose long Celebrated Name gives her joyful Expectations, ev'n in the midst of Suf∣ferings, and encourages Her to an extraordinary Reso∣lution, by an assurance of being speedily Reliev'd, or nobly Reveng'd?
And indeed, it is her Happiness that she cannot pre∣sume too much upon that Patronage; a Patronage that will amply satisfie the largest Hopes she can conceive from it, as well as give occasion to that Prince, who (intending the total Extirpation of the Protestant Re∣ligion from his Dominions) Exil'd the greatest Supporter

of his Throne and That; to repent his rash Ingratitude, when he finds that Religion Establish'd in another Coun∣try, by the very means he used to Banish it his own; and sees the Moses whom he Expell'd his Court, Rais'd up to deliver Israel.
Nor do we expect less than Miracles from that Hand, since we know them familiar to It; and that as there is nothing so difficult which It dares not un∣dertake, so there is nothing It undertakes, which it does not accomplish.
'Tis therefore, Mighty Sir, because you have been a Prince of Wonders, that we depend on You for that of Ireland's Preservation, and 'tis that Dependance occa∣sions you the trouble of this Address.
Pardon then, my Lord, this Effect of your own fam'd Merit, as readily as you face the Dangers to which it now exposes you; And as you cannot be displeas'd with that deserv'd Esteem which renders You our Choice and Option for this hazardous Enterprise, so let it not be less grateful that it brings these poor Endeavours to the Shelter of your Illustrious Name; which because it gives Security to all who are happy in its Protection, makes every one its ambitious Suppliant: In which Throng, may it please your Excellency to admit,
My LORD,
