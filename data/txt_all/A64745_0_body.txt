SIR,
THough I should have no other defence, that near relation by which my

dearest friend laies claime to your person, might in some measure excuse this otherwise unhansome ad∣venture of publishing these weake productions under the shelter of your name. But I was not so much in∣duced to it by that Tye, though very deare unto me, as by your love to Religion and Learning, and the respects due from my selfe to your person, and those reverend years, which by a faire and virtuous dis∣posal

of your time you have happily attained to, and wherein you safely are,
— Coelo dignus canente senectâ Consilioque deûm, —
I know, Sir, you will be pleased to accept of this poore Olive-leafe present∣ed to you, so that I shall not be driven to put forth my hand to take in my Dove againe. And in∣deed (considering how fast and how soone men dege∣nerate), It must be count∣ed for a great blessing, that

there is yet any left which dares look upon, and com∣miserate distressed Religi∣on. Good men in bad times are very scarce; They are like the standing eares of Corne escaped out of the Reapers hands, or the Vine-dressers last gleanings after the first ripe fruits have been gathered. Such a precious generation are the Iust in the day of trouble, and their names are like to afflicted truth, like the sha∣dow of a great rock in a

weary land, or a way-fa∣ring mans lodge in the waste and howling Wilder∣nesse. The Sonne of God himselfe (when he was here,) had no place to put his head in; And his Servants must not think the present measure too hard, seeing their Master himself took up his nights-lodging in the cold Mount of Olives.
By this time, Sir, you may see the reason which moved me to take San∣ctuary

at your name, and now I will acquaint you with my designe. To be short, Sir, It is no other, but that your name (like the royall stamp) may make current and commend this poore mite to posterity: And that the unfained lo∣ver of your Person may in these few and transito∣ry sheets waite upon your memory in the ages to come; when your immor∣tal and precious soule shall be bound up in the bun∣dle

of the living, in the ever-lasting book of life; which is devoutly desired by
Sir,

Newton by Vsk
