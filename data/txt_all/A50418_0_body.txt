My Honoured Lord,
THose learned Jews and Christians,
who have been curious to find out
the reason of some Visions in the
Scripture, do affirme, That the
Bush which Moses saw unburnt
in the midst of fire, was an Em∣bleme
of the Israelites then in
bondage to the Aegyptians, who were not onely preser∣ved
in the midst of Persecutions, but thrived under
their Oppressions, hard Tasks and heavy Burthens;
and grew more numerous from the politick Arts which
strived to lessen and destroy them: till at length God
contrived them a miraculous Deliverance, which with
their Calamitios concluded in a Song.
When I look back upon our late suffering Times,
(the saddest which I think any History hath recorded)
where Oppression backt with Power made the Ruine of

our Church the horrid step and ladder to the Usurpation
of the Crown; and where the name of a Bishop was so
criminal and odious, as to verifie Tertullian's sad com∣plaint
of his brutish Times, Nominis & vocabuli
rei fuimus, We were made guilty of a Word, and con∣demned
for being Christians, and the style was punisht
with publick Sales and Sequestrations: and when with∣all
I do consider, by what unlookt-for way of Providence
your Order and Religion, like a Treasure snatcht from
shipwreck, were stupendiously restored after many years
Confusion: Methinks that Bush which Moses saw
was the Embleme of our Church, kept safe by Miracle
in the midst of hungry fire: and the Ship in the Gospel
was presented to my eyes, where Christ and his Apostles
were tost in an hideous Storm; but he waked and stilled
the Winds, and put a calmness to the Sea.
In these dayes of publick Calamity, I was curious to
observe how several men behaved themselves in strug∣ling
with their dangers. I saw some take for their pa∣tern
the Prophet Jonas in a storm, who slept securely
and untroubled when his Shipwreck rolled about him.
I saw others so much Cowards, that to preserve their
wretched Fortunes they compounded with the Tempest,
and made a League and Friendship with the Winds;
nay, Servilely revived the Religion of those base timo∣rous
Heathens, who worshipt every thing they fear'd,
and sacrificed to Furies, and built Altars to their
Plagues. I saw others of a nobler and more stout and

Christian Temper (whose just reward is now to shine
like Stars of Honour in the Church) immovably reso∣lute
to maintain their Loyalty and Conscience with the
loss of their Lives, as they had already with their For∣tunes.
Yet, I hope, it will be no diminution of their Vertues,
if I say, That your Lordships Carriage in these Times
of Persecution was to me most remarkable; who by your
happy Restitution, and addition of more Honour, have
been made a greater Bishop, but not a greater Person,
then you were in your lowest ebbe of Fortune.
The payment of your Vow in your building of an
Alms-house on the place where you your self so ofter sate,
not wanting of an Almes, but weeping o're the Prospect
not then pleasant to your Eye, because your proper busi∣ness
there was to aske the passers by, If ever there were
sorrows like to the sorrows of this Nation; Your large
Bounty to the College of which I am a Member, which,
if I should name the Summe, would make the world be∣lieve
you meant to found a new College, and not complete
an old; Your dying Liberalities bequeathed to others in
your Will, even to your meanest Servants, who were your
servants in distress, are things which do proclaim you a
great and noble Benefactor. But these are but the
good deeds of your Fortune, done by the Bishop of Win∣chester,
the Charities of one possest with plenty and a∣bundance;
your Rents and Mannors here share with
you as Co-founders: and your new Almes-house might

have it written on the Walls, A poor Bishop vow'd
this House, but a great and wealthy built it.
That which made you truly great and reverend in
my eyes, was to look into your noble Heart, your large
and bounteous Mind, where your Good Deeds now, were
then but Wishes and Designs. You were truly great to
me, when I saw you in your Poverty anticipate your
Almes-house, and be liberal at your door: and the poor
people in your House now, had then places at your
Gate; when being reduced to the last Cruse of Oyle,
you made the drops run to others; and when there was
but a handful of Meal left in the little Barrel, you then
dealt your Loaf to those who wanted daily bread. In
short, when you had but two Coats left, to give one to the
naked; when you had hardly more then one Dish, to
make the poor your Guests; to see you walk up your Hill
with not much money in your purse, and return back
with none; but then to think of laying up Treasures
in Heaven, when you had so little left on Earth, was a
Charity which raised in me a religious Admiration; and
lookt something like the Miracle wrought by our Savi∣our
in the Gospel, where Multitudes were fed with two
fishes and five loaves.
Nor may I, without some Injustice to your Vertues,
forbear to let the world know, That I never saw Affli∣ctions
born with a more serene and even temper then you
did yours; who in the worst of Times stood like a firme
unshaken Rock in the midst of angry waves; your

Courage still the same, unbroken or undisturbed with a∣ny
sad Disasters not more publick then your owne.
The old Church of England still kept up in your
House, with all its Formes and Rites, though pub∣lickly
forbidden; Prayers constantly, and twice a
day, read by you for the King, at a time when such
Devotions were made Treason by the Tyrant; and
Weekly Sermons preacht before you, filled with so much
Loyalty and Truth, as would any where else have cast
the Preacher into Bonds, if not sent him from his Pulpit
to the place of Execution.
To all this your Lordships continued Kindnesses
to me, by which I can compute my self almost grown
aged in your Favours; your encouragement of my youn∣ger
Studies, which grew up under your Example;
your Rescue of me from a Shipwreck in the late un∣doing
Times, when being tost, and stript of all, you
were the Plank to save me, and threw me out a line
which drew me safe to shore; are Reasons sufficient to
let the World know, that of most sins I think Ingratitude
the worst.
Being therefore fairly invited at first to preach
this Sermon, and since by several Hearers of it to
make it this way publick, I beseech your Lordship to
allow it the shadow of your Wing; and to accept it,
not as a full payment of my Debts to you, (for this
very Dedication of it sets me deeper on your score)

but as a Testimony how much greater my Desires are
then my Abilities or Parts, to let the World know
how unfeignedly I am
