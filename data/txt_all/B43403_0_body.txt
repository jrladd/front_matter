May it please your Lordship,
THere is due to the glory of your Il∣lustrious Family a more ample and sufficient Discourse of the sub∣ject
 I have resumed, and I must therefore humbly crave your pardon, that I presume to confine the extended re∣nown of your Name through∣out the Turkish Empire, to this abridgement of its Great∣ness.
Your valorous and victori∣ous Ancestor left the Impres∣sion of English Courage and Honour indelibly visible on the walls of Strigonium, which Town his noble atchieve∣ment did in effect restore to to the German Caesar, whose sentiments of so great a ser∣vice have not onely worthi∣ly ranked you (by successi∣on) with the most Noble Counts of the most sacred Empire, but signalized that merit with an English Baro∣ny,
 conferred as a further reward thereof by our late Soveraign King James of bles∣sed memory.
Be your Lordship favoura∣bly pleased to permit there∣fore your Titles to be inscri∣bed to this Treatise, as by the matter thereof you have been entituled, to your Ho∣nours, and that with more splendid Remarques then the greatest Dignities in Europe can pretend to. And I no way doubt but that your great Name will prove as benign and propitious to this design as it hath been disastrous and formidable to the Turks.
Wishing your Lordship all Prosperity, answerable to
 your own particular Vertue, which hath been no less sig∣nally famous in the late Royal Service, I humbly beg leave to subscribe my self
My Lord,
