My Lord,
OCasions of Addres∣sing
those of your
Lordship's Worth and Qua∣lity,
have as often been a∣bus'd
by the undiscreet Pa∣negyrics,
and fulsom flat∣teries
of cringing Parasites,
as they have been eagerly
catch'd at. My obligations
to your Lordship make me

glad of an opportunity
but I confess, I think a De∣dication
an improper light
for that sacred thing Nobi∣lity,
and the great actions
of Noble Persons: Grave
History, and a good Hand
do that picture a great deal
more to the life; for then
there's no design, it never
sullies, and the colours hold
through all ages; yet if I
had as strong inclinations
to Flatter, as my subject is
tempting, and hands me
fairly into an opportunity,
your Lordship's known and
declar'd aversion to all such
practices and flaunting cu∣stoms,
a true stamp of en∣grain'd

Nobility, that ne∣ver
wanted these false, (and
may I say) satyrical lights of
silly flatrerers, who never
yet made a better Hero,
than Aesop's bird with bor∣row'd
plumes: I say, that
if my desire was as great,
as my subject's inviting, yet
this true Greatness of your
Lordship's would justly
check all such unreasona∣ble
and impudent de∣signs,
that would so tickle
these poor Creatures that
are infinitely pleased with
borrowed Feathers, when
their Gnatho's after a long
study, can find nothing so
good to equip them with,

as a piece of old Marble,
or a Monument only valu∣able
for the want of a Nose
or Lg broke off by time.
But tho your Lordship
hates as inveterately, as you
do not want any such ridi∣culous
praises, and I, of all
things, hate a Sycophant
the most; yet I may ac∣knowledge,
that my Ob∣ligations
to your Lordship
are very great, and that
'tis only Gratitude that
pushes me forward to give
you the trouble of This;
but especially, since your
Favour and extraordinary
Encouragements, have
mightily contributed to∣wards

the productions in
these sheets, that now ven∣ture
into the world under
your Lordship's protection;
and I will hope that you'll
not only protect this stran∣ger,
but accept of my slen∣der
Thanks; till I have a
better opportunity to ac∣quit
my self, as ought,
My Lord,
