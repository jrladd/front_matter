LADIES,
THough there have been many Books extant of this kind, yet I think something hath been deficient in them all. I have therefore adventured to make another, which I suppose comprehends all the Accom∣plishments necessary for Ladies, in  this Nature. For you have here
1. The Art of Preserving and Candy all Fruits and Flowers, as also of making Con∣serves, both wet and dry, and also the prepa∣ring of all sorts of Syrups, Jellies, and Pickles.
2. Here are some Excellent Receipts in Physick and Chirurgery for curing most Dis∣eases incident to the Body: Together with some Rare Beautifying Waters, Oyls, Oynt∣ments, and Powders, for Adornment of the Face and Body, and to cleanse it from all D¦ormities that may render Persons 
 there are also added some choice Secrets and Experiments in the Art of Angling; a Re∣creation which many Ladies delight in, and is not therefore thought altogether improper in a Book of this Nature.
Lastly, You have here a guide to all man∣ner of Cookery, both in the English and French Mode, with the preparing all kind of Sallets and Sauces proper thereunto.
Together with Directions for making all sorts of Pies, Pasties, Tarts, and Custards, with the Forms and Shapes of many of them to help your Practice, with Bills of Fare upon all Occasions. So that in the whole I hope it may deserve the Title of the Accomplish'd Ladies Delight, and may acquire Accep∣tance at your Fair Hands, whereby you will much Encourage and Oblige,
Ladies,
