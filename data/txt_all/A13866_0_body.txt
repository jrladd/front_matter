VvHile I labored to conforte my selfe / and other in the consideration of god∣des prouidēce / you know how one put in his fote / and assaied to impugne / some parte of that / that I had spokē. And though bi your procure¦mēt we met together / and after some debatinge a∣greed vpon the cheife pointes / that before semed to be in controuersie betwene vs / yet afterward it li∣ked him to shew certaine reasons against my affir∣mation / ether for exercise of lerninge / or bicaufe he wold be better confirmed in the truth. Now consi∣deringe that the matter is of great weight / & im∣portaunce / and somewhat scrupulous in this wea¦kenes of mennes capacitee / and suce to the re∣prehensions / and cauillatiōs of licenious heddes / lest anie thinge shuld be bruted otherwise thā I spa¦ke / I haue thought good to putte in prīte al that I said in your presence / that al men maie know / what my meaninge is / not by rehersal sermons / but by mine awne writīge. And in this behalfe I haue par¦tely folowed the counsel of M. Gilbert Barkley / whō you know I haue in due reuerēce / for his great grauite / and singular integrite of life. This poore
 frute of my studies I dedicate vnto you my most en¦tierly biloued master Parker / and to the right wor¦thie matrone your wife. For seīge the perfecte since∣re loue / that shuld be betwene al maried folke / shi∣neth most notably in you / I wold not sondre you in this place / whom god hath so ioigned / and made one in al good thinges. I haue iudged it also my du¦tie for asmuch as the bowels of the saīctes haue bē / and be daily refreshed by you / to rendre this testi∣monie of your singular godlines / and of my good affection towardes you / in the sight of the world. God almightie confirme / and augmente in you the knowlege of his truth / and loue of righteousnes / & blesse my biloued / Wētworth / Peregrine / An∣ne / & Cecile your childrē / that they maie fo∣low the godlie steppes of their Paren¦tes / and that the mention that I make of thē in this place / ie be a spurre vnto them here af∣ter to set them forewarde in the loue of tru religion / and innocentie of life.
Amen.
