My dear Christian friends,
WHen, upon your desires, I had Preached
this ensuing Sermon at the late sad Fu∣neral
of such a Wife, of such a Mother,
as you not long since had, I thought my
work about this Particular had been at a
Period. Since which, through the importu∣nity
of divers my Near and Dear Relations (whose
Request is to me a virtual command) thinking better of
it then I my self, I have been induced to Publish it, for

the benefit of them and other. The good LORD add
his Blessing both to what was then spoken, and is now writ∣ten:
for furthering of their faith, and helping of their
joy. And now I present the SermonRevised, with the help of two distinct coples thereof taken in short-hand when I preached it lest any useful passages should be omitted; there being a diffe∣rent Gift in Writing and Preaching. Revised (and
where it was needful a little enlarged) unto you: Who,
from her own Designation, recommended the present Text
to me. The Jewel in the words deserves a richer Cabinet;
yea and her sacred Dust a better Monument: But till
you meet with Richer and Better, let this be favourably
Accepted.
Not long since,Viz From Jun. 22. till al∣most July 20. 1656. my self was (by reason of a con∣tinuing
Fever) not far from thePsa. 49. 15. hand of the
Grave: but the living GodIsa. 38. 17. hath loved my soul
from the Pit of corruption. So that in this Sermon I
have Preached, mine own Experiences, and her Expe∣ctations
of deliverance. The Gracious LORD,
(whose methods of mercy are many) hath Released us both
from our respective extremities, as from thePsalm 68. 13. Pots:
Me From Death, That I might live to his Praise a
while on Earth: Her, By Death, That she may live in
his Praise for ever in heaven. Thrice blessed be the God
and Father of Mercies, for all the Mysteries of his Mer∣cies.
May I now speak a few words of Advice to you that
survive: especially to you the dear and Hopeful children
of so Happy a Mother? My sincere love to her, mine
rdent longings after your salvation, constrain me: And
I cannot hold my Peace. Let me stand a while as in your
late Mothers stead. O let my counsel be accepted and em∣braced.
1. Become Godly and Religious betimes.1 Chron. 289 1 King. 18. 3, 12. Know,
fear, love and serve God from your very youth.Eccles. 12. 1. Re∣member
your Creator in the daies of your youth.

Early Christians are Happy Christians. Under the Old
Testament God called for theExod. 34. 22, 26. First-fruits of the
ground, and theDeut. 12. 6. 17. Firstlings of the Flock; Much
more he expects the firstlings of our daies, of our youth,
of our strength. Think of1 Sam. 3. 4. to the end. Samuel,1 Sam 16. 7, 11, 13. & 17. 33, &c. David,
1 Chron. 22. 5. & 29▪ 1.  am. 12. 24. 1 King. 3. 3. Solomon,1 King. 18. 3. 12 Obadiah,2. Chron. 34. 1, 3. Josiah,Luk. 1. 15. John
Baptist,2 lim. 3. 15. Timothy, andLuke 2. 40, 42, 46, 47, 52. Jesus Christ himself:
how Religios they were in their very youth, and tread in
their steps. Oh what sins and iniquities are prevented:
What experiences of God are up-heaped: How large a
seed time of Grace and good works is obtained: How
long opportunities of2 Pet. 1. 10. making our Calling and Ele∣ction
sure are enjoyed, by giving up our selves to God
betimes.
2. Be sincerely and entirely Religious. Hypocrisie,
is a meer mockery in Religion: which occasionsMat. 23. 14. & 24. 51. the
deeper condemnation. Content not your selves with
Rev. 3. 1. a name to live, but be alive indeed. Rest not in
2 Tim. 3, 5. the Form, but look to the power of godliness.
1 Chron. 28. 9. Serve the Lord with a perfect heart. Seek, love,
and obey himPsalm 119. 10. with the whole heart. Let the whole
soul be as it were Woaded in Grace. Fill your judge∣ments
with knowledge and truth, your consciences with
purity, your wills with ractableness, your hearts and
affections with heavenliness, &c. Approve your selves
throughout to God: that you may say as Peter;oh 21. 17. Lord
thou knowest all things, thou knowest I love thee, I
fear thee, I trust in thee, &c.
3. Maintain sweet Communion with God in Jesus
Christ. Walk closely with God every day, asGen. 5▪ 22, 24. Enoch,
Gen. 6. 9. Noah,Gen. 17. 2. & 48. 15. Abraham,Psal. 101. 2▪ &c. 1 King. 15, 5. Psal. 18. 22. Acts 13. 22▪ David, &c. Think of
him frequently; Desire him vehemently; Love him en∣tirely;
Be never well but in his Presence. Accept all stir∣rings

of his Spirit, glimpses of his face, tasts of his love.
Open with him every morning, shut with him (like the
Sun-flower) every night, Turn towards him, and pant
after him all the day long. SayPsal. 73. 25. Whom have we in
heaven but thee? &c. Thus you shall recover the lost
Paradise, Thus you shall live as in an Heaven on earth:
and when you come to die, you shall but exchange one Hea∣ven
for another and a better; A Spiritual Heaven of
grace for an Eternal Heaven of Glory.
4. Let JESUS CHRIST be your All:
your1 Cor. 1. 30. Wisdom, to guide you: your Righteousness, to
justifie you: your Sanctification, to cleanse you: your
Redemption, to save you. If you hunger, he isIohn 6. 48▪ 51. Man∣nah:
If you thirst, he givesIohn 4. 10, 14. living water: If you
faint, he isLuke 2. 25. the consolation of Israel: If you pray,
he is1 Iohn 2. 1, 2. an Advocate with the Father: If you conflict
with spiritual enemies, he is your1 Iohn 5. 4, 5. 1▪ Cor. 15. 57. Rom. 8. 37. Victory and Tri∣umph,:
If you live, he is your1 Tim. 1. 1. hope: If you die,
be is yourPhil. 1. 21. gain: If you be buried also, he is your
Ihu 11. 25. Life and Resurrection. O let him be theRev. 1. 8, 11. Al∣pha
and Omega, The Center and Circumference, yea
the veryCol. 3. 11. All in All, your Desires, Loves, Ioyes,
Delights, Endeavours and Undertakings. If you want
Christ, you want all things: If you have Christ, you want
nothing. In all your joyes, Christ is the highest Exulta∣tion:
In all your sorrows, Christ is the sweetest Conso∣lation:
In all your Gains, Christ is the chief Remune∣ration:
In all your losses, Christ is the richest Compen∣sation.
In him make up the loss of Wife and Mother.
All Sweetness, Dearness, Tenderness, Fulness, Content∣ment,
Satisfaction, Consolation and Happiness is a thou∣sand
fold in him more then in these, or all the Relations
of the world. These are but glimmering Lamps, He is

the glorious Sun; These are but broken Cisterns, he
is the living Fountain; These are but little drops, he is
the boundless Ocean. Now therefore turn all your desires
and afections towards him, and be fully satisfied. One
Christ, is beyond ten thousand worlds.
5. Strive after well-grounded Assurance of a good
spiritual state. Labour not only, That God, Christ, Grace,
and Glory may be yours: but also, That ye may know as∣suredly
they are yours. Assurance is possible; For1 Cor. 2. 12. Gods
Spirit is given to help us to it, &c.Iob 19. 25, 26, 27. Heb. 10. 34. 1 Tim. 1. 16. 2 Tim. 1. 12. Many have attain∣ed
it. Assurance is necessary: for God hath charged us to
endeavour after it;2 Pet. 1. 10. Give diligence to make your
calling and election sure, &c. And Assurance is very
comfortable, and advantagious to our2 Pet. 1. 10. Perseverance.
This held upIob 19. 25. &c. Job under all his misery. This cheared
up2 Tim. 4. 6, 7, 8. Paul against approaching death.
6. Contend exceedingly, That2 Pet. 3. 18. Col. 3. 5, &c. Grace may
still be growing; and sin be dying. The more Grace,
and the less Sin: the less like Satan, the more like God;
he further from Hell, the nearer to Heaven. The
Eph. 5. 27. & 4. 12, 13. Abolition of sin, and the Perfection of Grace, are
the suburbs of Glory.
7. Live to God, and upon God in Christ, that you
may live with God and with Christ.Rom. 14. 8. Live to God,
in all holy, heavenly, and blameless conversation;Habak. 2. 4. live
upon God, in all constant faithful dependance: That you
mayIohn 14. 3, 19. live with God and Christ in immediate eternal
enjoyments.
8. Live in1 Iohn 4. 7, 8. love one to another, and towards all
Gods People. Love entirely, love affectionately, love
Christianly in order chiefly to Spirituals and Eternals.
Sincere love is theIohn 13. 34, 35. Badge and Character of Christs
Disciples on earth; and1 Cor. 13. 13. Love will be part of the

Crown of Christs Members in Heaven. Oh ye dear chil∣dren
that tumbled in the same bowels, still retain the
Phil. 2▪ 1, 2. same Mind, Heart and Affection one towards ano∣ther.
You shall have adversaries enough in the world: and
therefore never be one anothers adversaries. So live in
love together on Erth, as those that look to live in ra∣vishments
together in Heaven.
9 Highly prize and frequent All the Means of
Grace in Publick and Private Gods Ordinances are his
Sacred Channels wherein alone in ordinary, his streams
of grace do flow. Haw did DavidPsal. 84. 1, &c. & 122. 1, &c. exult in the en∣joyment
of them! How did hePsalm 12. 1. to 5. & 63. 1, 2. lament in the want of
them! Christians ought toMat. 28. 19, 2. observe all Christs Com∣mandments
and Ordinances. TheyHb. 10. 25. must not for∣sake
the Assembling of themselves together, as the
manner of some is, Psalm 89. 15. blessed is that people that
know the joyful sound! TheHeb. 1. 20. Mat. 28. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 11. 26. New Covenant,
and the Administrations thereof are to continue till the
end of this world: and therefore they ought still to
be attended upon by all Gods New Covenant Peo∣ple.
10. Be1 Cor. 15. 58. constant, stedfast, persevering, and
abounding in Faith, Obedience, and all goodness unto
the End. Be faithful to the Death: ThenRev. 2. 10. you
shall receive a Crown of life; then2 Ioh. 8. you shall re∣ceive
a full reward.2 Thes. 3. 13. Gal. 6. 9. Be not weary of well-doing,
for in due time ye shall reap if ye faint not. How con∣stant
and stedfast to the end was your gracious Mother in
Faith, Patience and Godliness, although no small Tem∣pest
of Pain and Trouble lay upon her. The best of Saints
may be exercised with the worst of sorrows here: But the
Lord isDan. . 25. Exod. 3. 2. Isa. 43. 2. Psal. 23. 4. with them in the furnace of their Tryals, yea,
was with her to uphold her in the valley of the shadow

of Death. Hence, though she was2 Cor. 4▪ 8, 9 Troubled on
every side, yet was she not distressed, though perplex∣ed,
yet not in despair; though cast down, yet not de∣stroyed.
Iam. 5. 11. We count them happy that endure. O
let not sharpest tryals or troubles ever make you faint or
flag at any time. They thatLuke 9. 62. put their hands to Gods
plough, and look back, render themselves unfit for the
Kingdom of God.
11. Lastly, Mourn moderately in the loss of her,
and other earthly comforts. When holy Iacob dyed in
Egypt,Gen. 50. 10. The Israelites the children of Jacob mourn∣ed
seven daies, but theGen. 50. 3. Egyptians seventy daies:
This was not because the Egyptians had more love to Ja∣cob
then the Israelites; but because the Israelites had
more Grace, and Hope, and Moderation, then the Egypti∣ans.
Natural affection is commended:1 Thes. 4. 13. excess in
mourning is condemned.Iohn 11. 35. Jesus himself wept at La∣zarus
his Grave: and yet Christs members1 Thes. 4. 13. must not
mourn as others that have no hope for them that sleep
in Jesus. Were she still lying among the sullying pots, in
midst of her sighs, groans, dolours and extremities, you
might well bleed over her and lament her; but that she is
delivered from all her sins and sorrows; is as the wings
of a Dove, covered with silver, &c. hath laid aside her
earthly sables, and is cloathed in heavenly white: Is in
Luk. 16. 22. Abraham's bosom, inLuke 23. 43. Paradise,Heb. 12. 22, 23. Phil. 1. 23. with
Saints, Angels, and with God in Iesus Christ, which is
far best of all, &c. Now rejoyce in her joyes, triumph in
her triumphs,Intelligeres llum non emori, sedemigrare; & mu∣tare amicos, nonrelinquere. Hicrnym. in Epitaph. Nepo∣tian. p. 25. Tom. 1. Basil. 1553. she is not so much dead, as deli∣vered
by death: she hath (as Hierom said of Nepo∣tianus)
not so much lost her friends; as changed
them, and changed them for better: she is not so much
2 Cor. 5. 4. uncloathed, as cloathed upon, her mortality being

swallowed up of life. Let her have your Imitations,
rather then your Lamentations. Her graces and gracious
deportments towards God and Man, and more especially
towards you, In her health and sickness, in her life, and
at her death were very Christian and exemplary. In all,
1 Cor. 11. 1. do ye follow her, as she followed Christ. Let her
vertues still live in you: so shall she in some sense still live
with you. And inasmuch as,Fiducla Christiano rum, Resurre∣ctio mortuo∣rum. Tertul. de Resurrect. c. 1. p. 31. The Resurrection of
the dead, is the peculiar Hope and Consolation of
Christians, consider; she1 Thes. 4. 14. 15, 16, 17. sleeps in Jesus, she shall at
last awake and be Raised again by Iesus: And ye shall
meet again; meet, and never part; meet, not to sigh
and mourn together, but to sing and triumph together.
Ye shall be caught up with her and with all the Elect to∣gether,
to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall ye be
ever with the LORD. Amen. So prayeth.
