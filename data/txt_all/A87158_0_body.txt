MY LORD,
MANY have labou∣red, and weari∣ed themselves in a restless enquiry after a perpetual Motion, whose

thoughts might have been employed to better purpose in finding out perpetual Rest: There is no Man living but would have Rest, all our labours, all endeavours tend that way: Your Lord∣ships unwearied Active Mo∣tion, in the high place and calling, in which Divine Providence hath set Your Lordship, leads undoubtedly, in a direct line, to this desired Rest; and as all

natural Motions make more hast, as they come nearer their Center, so Your Lord∣ships more vigorous, and cheerful moving in this holy Function, makes us jealous, lest Your Lordship should make more hast to an Eter∣nal Rest in the Church Tri∣umphant, than stands with the interest of the present Church Militant, in which Your Lordships Care and Government, have been so

eminent, and are still so necessary: To no other there∣fore could I more advisedly address these Meditations of Rest, than to the blessed hand of a Patron, whose indefatigable labours have so fairly entituled him, to all the promises of this most glorious and blessed Rest. Nor comes this under Your Lordships Protection with∣out design, for having once taken Sanctuary there, and

past the dread it hath of Your Lordships view, I shall not need for ever af∣ter be sollicitous, what Eye it may be exposed unto for its censure. But if it be asked why I (after so many pious, devout, excelling discourses of this nature) should cast my Mite at last into this Sacred Treasury; the poor Widow in the Gos∣pel shall answer for me, who at the same time when she

beheld the richer Offerings of the wealthy, thrown frankly in before her Eyes, yet held she not her self thereby excused: And that this (though the meanest of all oblations that have gone before it) may yet contribute something, towards the safe conducting some drooping Travellers, that are weary and heavy laden, to their long home, their last and happy Eternal Rest, hath

been sincerely in the desires, and shall for ever be in the Prayers of,
MY LORD,
