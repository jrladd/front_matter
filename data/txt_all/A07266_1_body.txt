MAdam this worke is dedicated
to the publike weale, whether
all Histories goe; to the Kings
seruice, whereat all affections
should ayme; to the immortall
reputation of Henry the Great, whether all
my thoughtes shall tend, and presenting it to
your Maiesty as to the Gouernesse of the
realme, to the mother of my king, to the wid∣dow
of my maister, I discharge my selfe of that
which I owe to the Instruction of Posterity, to
the glory of the Sonne, to the memorie of the
Father, and to the honor of your commande∣ments.
I am sorry that it could not adde the
praise of diligence to the merit of my obedience,
but his slacknesse makes it not vnseasonable;
the subiect is Immortall, the world will neuer

cease to admire so glorious a life, nor to lament
so tragicall and sodaine a death. This fatal day
of the 14. of May, which should haue beene the
period of your mourning, hath been the renewing
of it, and hath reuiued your sorrowes with such
passion as the spirits could hardly bee stayed
from following your teares. Our greefes shall ne∣uer
be so old, but they shall still find new causes
to lament. It is true (Madame) that they are
much eased by the happy effects of your regency
which hath preserued those that held themselues
lost, hath maintained the lawes of the state, rai∣sed
vp the subiects hope, let the world see that
in a Queenes hart you carry the courage
of a King, and that Italy hath brought forth a
Blanch to Lewis the 13. as Spain did to Lewis
the 9. you make that great Prince to liue againe,
for whose departure the Earth weeps, and Hea∣uen
reioyceth at his returne, he raignes in the
King his sonne, he triumphs in the restauration
of France and in the renowne of his vertues,
which liues in you Madam, he breathes in
your sighes, hee is reuerenced in your authority,

he hath left you the force of his iudgement, the
respects of his maiesty, the felicity of his raigne,
the wills of all his subiects, whereof you dispose
in such sort as it seemes the time present hath no
cause to feare the future, nor to greeue for that
is past.
