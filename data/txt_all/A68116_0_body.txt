RIGHT VVor∣thy, and Wor∣shipfull, I (ha∣uing receiued from you in my present afflictions so great fa∣uors, such tender compassions, and knowing how base an euill ingratitude is, that it is, inimi∣ca animae, dispersio virtutum &c.) cannot but shew my gratefull heart, in presenting that to your worships eyes, that late∣ly hath beene sounded in your

eares: a subiect most comfor∣table, and so necessary to bee knowne, delighted in, and re∣sted on, as without it no salua∣tion: for this is life eternall, to know God, and him whom God hath sent, the Lord Iesus.
The Lord (of his infinite mercy) giue you the sauing knowledge of Christ Iesus, to embrace him as your chiefest Lord and King: for to so many as receiue him, giues he power, priuiledge, prerogatiue, to be called and be the sons of God.
