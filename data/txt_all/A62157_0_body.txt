RIGHT HONOURABLE,
THE Hereditary Tyes I am under to the City of Aberdeen, (of which my Father was Recorder several years) where∣in many of my Friends Live, and some whereof have been Honoured with the most eminent Posts in the Magistracy, and of which I my self am a Native and Burger, are so strong, that they need no new motives to raise and preserve in me, the great∣est Honour, and the most sincere Love for the Place: And ye who are the present worthy Governours hereof, have surpriz'd me with such new favours and Personal Obligations, since my last Return to your City, that nothing but a publick acknow∣ledgment, can secure me against the Reproach of Ingratitude.
Those Shelves on which, I and many well designing, but se∣duced Christians had Shipwrack'd the true Faith, could not be sufficiently guarded against, nor those who are already fallen into fatal delusions recovered and restored, otherwayes, then by ex∣posing to the impartial view of the World, the gross and vile



Errours, that ly couched under the mask of Divine Illuminations, and the palpable Contradictions that are maintained by different parties of that Society, which pretends to be guided and influenced in every point, by the unerring Spirit of Infinite Wisdom. And as Love to Christianity and Charity to the Souls of others, has induced me first to Propose, and then to publish the following Queries and Remarks, so I cannot in Justice conceal your Forwardness and Zeal, to Countenance and encourage me in vindication of the Truth, and to allow what ever might be of use to me, in defence of the Truth, which I have endeavoured to doe, with the greatest simplicity. And that GOD may strengthen you and raise up others, to be valiant for Truth and Holiness, shall ever be the hearty Prayer of,
Right Honourable,
