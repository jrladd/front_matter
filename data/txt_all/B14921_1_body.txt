Right Honourable and graue Senators:
IT is recorded by diuers Historians, that many renowned Emperors, Kings, and great Potentates, haue exercised shooting for their recreations; and likewise reuerend and religious Bishops after their painfull studie; and also graue and wor∣thy Senators, after their serious imployments, would sometimes for their recreations take their Bowes and Arrowes and exercise Archery: And still it was maintained, and also by Authority com∣manded to be exercised by all degrees both of old and young, and by Statute-Lawes there were pe∣nalties inflicted vpon all those that neglected the same: The chiefe and principall causes were, there∣by to make men apt and fit for seruice in time of wars, & for restraint of vnlawful games & exercises.

 But now, by reason the Bow is not vsed in the warres, this Exercise is neglected, for which cause, (Right Honourable and graue Senators) my selfe being an Archer, (and knowing well, that in the hands of our Brittish Nation the Bow and Ar∣rowes is a most famous weapon, and worthy to be preferred before any other weapon whatsoeuer) haue by my industry and practice, with an Inuen∣tion, ioyned the Bow and Pike together, whereby euery practitioner may bee a Double-armed man, and so vse them ioyntly or seuerally for his aduan∣tage: Which inuention, if it were authorized and practised effectually, (as I haue with my great char∣ges and industry Inuented it carefully) I doubt not but God will blesse and prosper our warres by it, like as in times past when the Bow was in vse; and our Brittish Bowmen (as formerly they were) will bee a terror vnto all their enemies, bringing home with them victory and conquest; which that it may be effected accordingly, I will euer pray vn∣to the Almighty, who is the giuer of victories; and euer rest
