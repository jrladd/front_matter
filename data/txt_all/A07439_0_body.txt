SIR
MERCATORS Geographicall Historie, fit∣ly Emblematiz'd by the Sunne, hath with refulgent rayes illuminated the Transma∣rine World. But now rising up in our Cri∣ticall Horizon, it feares the Eclipse of Envie, and therefore desires your worthy and learned Patronage, that being free'd from such interposing shaddowes, it may shine forth as the Meridi∣an Sunne. Your great, and good Fame, inviting and encouraging strangers to boldnesse, is my Apologie for this Dedication. For since the world is so much obliged to your Vertue, Learning, and up∣right Integrity, it will appeare a iust gratitude to devote this Cos∣mographicall World to so favorable a Moecenas. The Translator in the performance, and Dedication, is enforced to ayme at an infe∣rior Object; and to descend beneath his owne descent and Birth, which improved in the Ʋniversitie of Oxford, flattered him with hope of a kinder Fortune. But modest ingenuitie permits not a larger Character of himselfe, and the Brevitie of few words is most intelligible to the judicious. The worke in the Originall was written by a famous learned Cosmographer, and a great light of

his time Mercator, whose labours are here humbly presented, & his ashes sleeping in their Vrne (if they could be sensible of joy) would rejoyce in so worthie a Patron. Let the Authors, and your owne worthinesse mitigate my presumption, that J whose life hath beene all Tristia, have presumed to offer up the whole World at so high an Altar. Pardon this double Ambition, and be pleased to accept this Sacrifice, from the hand of the most humble Sacrificer,
