SIR,
ALthough I am a stranger to you, yet the Gallantry of your Vertuous inclinations, together with the nearness of affections to my never to be forgotten Cammander Sir Hugh Wyndham Knight, late deceased, forceth me to present you with a Lively Portraicture of his worth. As to his Military concerns, he made his Souldiers Commanders of the chiefest princi∣ples of War (that is) to be Faithful, Obedient, Resolute to fight, loving to their Country, and loyal to their Sove∣raign: So likwise in the private Exercises of his Troops, those under his Command were as Ornaments in peace, and a guard in War: This only was not the heighth of his ambition, for he made it a principle to himself in Warlike combates, not to have many names, but many
 hands: And for his deportments, I am sure none was more beloved in his Country, nor could command more able and stouter Souldiers for his Majesties service than him∣self: And I hope the Heavens have most largely rewar∣ded him for his blood spilt in his late Majesties service (of ever blessed memory.)
Sir, I humbly beg I might by your favour indicate to the world my Obligements to his deceased person, which was accepted of by him when he was alive, as an Epistle to my Observations for the Military Exercise of Horse and Foot. And what I have truely said of him, your own worth falls not short; in your Paternal affections to your Country, which hath of late appeared (notwithstand∣ing great opposition) in their clear affections to you again, especially in that unparallel'd Election of you for Knight of the Shire: And give me leave to declare to the World your Countries further Esteems of you, to be one of his Majesties chiefest Cittadels (or fort Royall) for their safety: Not that I declare this to lessen any of the beames of those other worthy Heroes that shall joyn with you, when ever his Majesty shall Command.
Sir, I crave your Pardon for my boldness, and con∣clude (with my desired wishes for your Worships tran∣quillity, the increase of Honour here, and what may be merited for you, to make you glorious in the world to come) subscribing in the quality of
July 29. 1671.
