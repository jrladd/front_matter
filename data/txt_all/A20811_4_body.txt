THrice noble and my gracious Lord, the loue I haue euer
borne to the illustrious house of Bedford, and to the ho∣nourable
familie of the Harringtons, to the which by
marriage your Lordship is happily vnited, hath long since
deuoted my true and zealous affection to your honourable ser∣uice,
and my Poems to the protection of my noble Ladie, your
Countesse; to whose seruice I was first bequeathed, by that lear∣ned
and accomplished Gentleman, Sir Henry Goodere, (not
long since deceased,) whose I was whilst hee was, whose patience
pleased to beare with the imperfections of my heedlesse and vn∣stated
youth. That excellent and matchlesse Gentleman, was the
first cherrisher of my Muse, which had beene by his death left a
poore Orphan to the world, had hee not before bequeathed it to
that Lady whō e so deerly loued. Vouchsafe then my deere Lord
to accept this Epistle, which I dedicate as zealously, as (I hope)
you will patronize willingly, vntill some more acceptable ser∣uice
may be witnesse of my loue to your honour.
