Honoured Sir,
THE Civil and Gentleman-like Treatment I met with the first time I saw you, and the many Favours I have received from you since I have been honoured with your more In∣timate Acquaintance, emboldens me to prostrate this Trifle at your
 Feet; not pretending thereby to merit any thing from you, but as a just Acknowledgment of the many Obligations I lye under. It would be a Wrong to you for me to speak any thing in your Praise, your Me∣rits being better known, than I am able to represent them. It was you, SIR, who were (for ought I know) the most early Cultivator of the Doctrine of Acids in the Cure of Diseases, in this Nation; and the Success you have had in your Practice sufficiently makes it appear, that you very well understood what you went about, when you durst contend with the whole World, by treading in a New Path to Aid and Succor Life, which few Physicians ever went before. Macte! SIR, in so Great a Work as in Saving from the Grave; so shall the Name of Baynard not be known to the Widow, nor the Cries of the Father∣less entail Vengeance on your House. And would your Multiplicity of
 Business but permit you to collect your own Observations, and make them Publick, I am sure the Mouths of all your Opposers would be for ever stopp'd, and their Errors cured by your Healing Hand; for I know your Charity extends to Lunacy, as well as other Diseases: For none but the Moon-sick can doubt so known and clear a Truth, as are the daily and most apparent Cures done by (the Happy Discovery of) the Use of Acids. 'Tis well known, SIR, that Nature and Art has sufficient∣ly arm'd you for any Enemy, if such there are; tho your Condonable Dis∣position is like the Sun, which shines even upon the Curs that bark at him. Your Pardon, SIR, for this Trouble, and I doubt not but from you to meet with a Generous Ac∣ceptance and Protection; and if Dr. Baynard espouse my Cause, I care not who is against me. I assure you I bring no common Inclinations to serve you; neither would I by
 ordinary Testimonies express that Passion wherewith I am,
SIR,
