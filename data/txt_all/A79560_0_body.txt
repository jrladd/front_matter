Right Honorable,
IT was hoped, not long since, that the time was come, in which God would glorious∣ly exalt his Truth, and make Ierusalem a praise in the earth; for God seemed to appear more for us then ever in our, or our forefathers days: In assembling so many Worthies in Parliament; in calling an Assembly of so able and worthy Divines; in bringing the Nation into the bond of a Covenant, to root out Popery, Prelacy, Errors, Heresies, Schism, and all that is contrary to sound do∣ctrine; and in subduing the publike enemies of Truth and Peace.
But our iniquities have separated between God and us, and our sins have hid away his face from us; We looked for light, and behold darkness: God hath let loose men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith, who resist the trurh, and bring in damnable He∣resies, and many follow their pernicious ways.
The abounding of Errors, (and in particular, the spreading of Anabaptism,) calling all to contend for the faith, hath compelled me (contrary to my in∣tentions) to make publike this defence ofTanto magis pro infantibus loqui debemus quanto minus ipsi per se loqui possunt. August Poedo bap∣tism, which is the fruit of some hours, spared from my other studies.

I am bold (Right Honorable) humbly to dedi∣cate these my first fruits to your honor, and with all observancy to subject them to your judicious censure.
That which hath made me thus presuming, is your singular goodness, and unparalleld humility, which makes you worthily had in honor of all.
Artaxerxes, the Persian Monarch, received, with a chearful countenance, a present of water of a poor la∣bourer, when he had no need of it, accounting it the part of a truly Noble and generous spirit, to take in good part smal presents offered with an hearty affecti∣on, as wel as to give great things liberally.
This smal present (most Noble Lord) is presented with an intire affection, to one as truly Noble and ge∣nerous as Artaxerxes.
Your unfeigned love to the truth, manifested by your constant cleaving to it, (even in this hour of temptati∣on, which is come upon us, in which many are turned aside after Satan;) Your care to place able and faith∣ful Pastors over people, where you have opportunity to do God this service, and casting honor and respect upon such in these times, in which they are cast down, and filled with contempt: Your great fidelity to your Country, and your many heroick vertues shining in you; Make it our duty (who are Ministers of the Gospel) to celebrate your due praises, for the honor of your noble deservings, and the incouragement of o∣thers to walk in your pious steps.
That your honor may be preserved in safety in these sad divisions of the Kingdom, receive a daily increase of honor, and continue faithful to the death, that you may receive the crown of life; shall be the prayer, until death, of him, who is your Honors
