THESE first fruits of my labours, were purposely commen∣ded to the Presse; for the benefit of you my faithfull flock, who were pleased
(about three yeares agoe) to chuse me (minimus Apostolo∣um) to be your Pastor to feed your soules. And since I came amongst you; I have set my shoulders unto my worke, and according to that poore talent, God hath given me, have laboured to build you up in the know∣ledge of God, in that perfect building, whereof Christ is the corner stone. I blesse God, that I can see the fruits of my labours, in any of you; that you use the means for grace, and the know∣ledge of God, and labour to
thrive herein; hold on, and Gods blessing will guide, and goe along with you; that of babes and children in Christianity▪ you may all grow to be tall Christians in time: therefore have I joy∣ned the following Sermon, to stirre you up to growth in grace. Which shall bee ever my endeavours, and pray∣ers; for God is my witnesse, I have not sought yours, but you, and am resolved with the Apostle to spend and be spent for you. Had I sent this sub∣ject to the publike view, be∣fore these times of troubles;
it would have been distast∣ed, as it was there, where it was first preached; but God (by his speciall providence) having brought me amongst you (a willing people) I am encouraged to recommend it to you, for protection; de∣siring it may finde as much affection with you, now Printed, as it did attention, when it was Preached to you; I confesse my booke is brought forth in a bloody time, when our crying sins have caused clouds to rise every day, and poure down showers of blood on the
land; It comes into a criti∣call age, and will meete with many Annomus, many Antagonists; therefore I have sent it for protection, to my Parish, from whence it came, and where it was most respected; you must expect it will bee carpt at, though it have many friends; yet you know I am not without enemies, who have cast dirt both at you, and me; and shall my booke thinke to escape scot-free; nay, whose malice hath en∣deavoured, to diverse me from you, and to cut a-sun∣der,
the conjugall knot be∣twixt us; but a curse I feare will follow them; who seek to put asunder, those that God hath joynd together; yet Ile leave their censure to the God of justice, and pray for them, that God would forgive them; for they know not what they doe; and that the God of patience,Rom. 15.5. and consolation, would make us all followers of God, as deare children; and grant that we may be like mind∣ed, one towards another in Christ Jesus. And my prayer for you, is that our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, and God even our
Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consola∣tion, and good hope through grace, would comfort your hearts, and esta∣blish you in every good word and worke.
