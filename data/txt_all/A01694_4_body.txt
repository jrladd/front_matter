TO you (deare Nimph) whose wit, and forme, enflames
A world of spirits, with wonder of your graces,
That (in their strength) pursew no higher ames,
Then how to giue your bounties soueraigne places.
I heere am bolde, to make extent of will,
Though not of power. Pardon my first essay:
I goe by night, now to the Muses hill:
But I may liue, to drinke there, at Mid-day.
O then: my soule shall flow through my cleare vaines,
And (taking light from your bright vertues spheare)
Pay richer duties, in farre-sweeter straines,
Tun'd to your worth, and set to euery eare.
Had I a Spencers spirit, a Daniels powers:
Th'extracted quintessence were only yours.
