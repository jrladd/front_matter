RIght Honourable, these pains were un∣dertaken by your command, and your Order was the Midwife to bring them into the light. I hope my imperfecti∣ons shall finde a cover under the vaile of your authority. God knowes my hearts desire was to mind you of your solemne Covenant, (which Lords be subject to a neg∣lect of as well as meaner men) and to stirre you up to a private Reformation, without which yee can look for no blessing upon your publick endeavours. Endeavour I be∣seech you to cast every little moat out of your own eyes, be∣fore you goe about to cast the great beames out of the eyes of the Church and State.

 Sab fol. 32.1. If the Shepheard be lame, sayth the Talmud, the go its will easily make an escape. So will all sorts of Delin∣quents and Malefactors, if your Lordships goe slowly to work.

Give not the people occasion to say, The let of Discipline is, because great men cannot endure a through-reformation. The Lord that called you to such a pitch of ho∣nour, and height of employment, make your Lordships worthy instruments of his glory here, and fill you with glory in his own presence in heaven. So prayeth
