YOU that are thicke sowne and

thin come vp, as if the world were barren of vertue, or past breeding of Goodnesse: you that are as rare as Phenixes, as scare as black Swans or white Negroes, and as much to be held in admirati∣on as Snow in Iuly, Strawber∣ries in December, the Sunshine at Midnight, or a blazing Starre at Noone: I as∣sure you my braue worthy Benefac∣tors, that I your ancient and yeer∣ly Guest (Christ∣mas,) am heartily sorry to see your quondam number so much shrunke in the wetting; and although you are falne into that lamentable con∣sumption

that I with my friends fauourers and followers can scarcely finde the tithe of my for∣mer entertain∣ment: yet (to shew my thanke∣full memory to your worthy pre∣decessors,) with my gratefulnesse to you (too few) that are surui∣uers, and to en∣courage a fruit∣full Spring, en∣ease or multi∣plication of your successors. I send to you this my louing & friend∣ly Epistle. You in your discetions, hold the com∣mendable and golden meane way betwixt the two extreame

Gulphs of Nig∣gerality and pro∣degality, betwixt Hunger & Glut∣tony, betwixt Hide all & Spend all, betwixt wil∣ful Slauery and wastefull Braue∣ry. I wish most vnfeignedly that the dew of Hea∣uen may descend blessedly, that you may fructifie, multiply fruitful∣ly, encrease and ampliffe, like the tree which Nabu∣chadnezar drempt of, whose toppe reach'd to Hea∣uen, and whose branches exten∣ded and stretch'd to the ends of the Earth: you haue the Celesti∣all Graces; your Hope is constant,

your Faith is fer∣uent, your Chari∣ty is frequent: your Hope is in assurance of that neuer faiing pos∣session wherein the vnblasted tree of your Faith is firmely fixed and rooted; and your Charity is the pi∣ous fruit which springs from that faithfull Tree. And he that with his Grace doth plant it, wa∣ter it, and cause it to increase, will crowne his own gifts on your heads, that are his beloued in∣struments; not onely here, with blessings transi∣tory and tempo∣rall, but hereaf∣ter with that vn∣speakable

glory which was, is, and shall bee per∣manent and E∣ternall.
