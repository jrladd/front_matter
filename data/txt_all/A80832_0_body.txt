SIR,
WHen your command gave life to this Sermon, I did not imagine that it could have been expos'd to any such uncharitable censures as might force it to return to your name for shel∣ter and protection; by which means I doubt not but it will find better en∣tertainment then it can deserve, or I hope for: For now unless they resolve to run the hazard of a publick disgrace, they must needs blush to proclaim their dislike of that, which a person of so much honour and judgment as your¦self, was pleas'd (with many other good men) in the hear∣ing to approve of; and therefore I presume will not now dislike of. Sir, I knew when I preach'd it, that telling the truth was not the way to insinuate into many of my Au∣ditors affections, and if I am therefore become their ene∣my, my case is in this no worse then Saint Pauls, Gal. 4. ver. 16. Nor indeed are they such Cato's, as that it should be punishment enough to be condemned by them; but they rather publish the clearness of the light in declaring how offensive it was to their ees. The honey is never the worse, because it made their wounds to smart: If Saint
 John Baptist had been onely a shining and not a burning Lamp, he might possibly have kept his head upon his shoulders: when the truth shews it self, there is none can dislike it; but when it shews them, there are many that hate it, because it gives Check-mate to their interest; and such I hope will appear to be their displeasure, whose sto∣machs could not digest this Sermon almost a quarter of a year after they receiv'd it. Wholesom meat must not be kept from the table, because some agush stomachs nauseate it. It was delivered in as general terms as I could think upon, that so they who are angry might accuse themselvs.
Sir, If there be any thing in it that may be worthy of your perusal, be pleas'd to accept it as your due, and a testimony of my gratitude; for having run so long up∣on the score, till the interest of your favours exceeds the principal of my abilities, rather then I would put off so noble a Creditor with a Non sum solvendo, I thought it more commendable, with the bad borrowers of our times, to begin the paiment of great debts by such a slender com∣position as this; there is a power in your aceptance to make its meanness fashionable, and to teach others to have a more charitable opinion of
Sir,
