POore TOM was set on shore in Kent,
And to the next good Towne hee went;
At whose approach the Bosseldir
Kept a most lamentable stirre
That TOM would offer to returne
Through the good Towne of Syttingborne
Hee askt him; If hee had a Passe?
And told him what the Statute was;
And like a Reverend Vestry wit,
Swore, hee would not allow of it.
But did advise him to resort
To fetch his Passe at Tonstall Court.
Our TOM of all Trades hereupon
Askt what was his condition
Who was the Owner of that place
So farre in all the Countries grace?
For whom (as hee walkt on the way
Hee heard) the poore so much to pray
The Rich to praise. And both contend,
To whom hee was the greater friend.
Didst never meete his name there spread,
Where thou thy selfe didst vse to tread?

No? not Sir EDVVARD HALES? Quoth he,
What TOM of Odcombe may'st thou be?
Hee is a man scarce spends a minute,
But hath his Countries service in it.
Spends more to make them all accord
Then other Knights doe at their boord.
Hee call'd him Knight and Barronet.
Both wise and Iust; And what more yet?
He swore that if hee were but mist
The Countrey could not so subsist.
With that our TOM repaired thither,
Conferr'd Report and Proofe together;
And found Report had wrong'd him much
In giving but an out-side touch,
A tincture of a Painters trade;
Where all was substance and in-layd.
Then TOM resolv'd to walke no farther
To finde a Father or a Mother.
No other Patron would hee seeke,
But tender all at this Knights feete:
If hee accept what's well intended,
Our TOM of all Trades travaile's ended.
Signa virtutum tuarum longe late{que} ferens.
