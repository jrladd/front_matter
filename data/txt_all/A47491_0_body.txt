Honoured Sir.
I hope this Dedicatory Epistle of mine published with∣out your Knowledge, will beget no such Sinister Construction in you, but that the Fault shall be admitted as a veniall Transgression; and this Presumption, find ea∣sie Remission at your most gentle Hands; I am now so well acquainted with your Pleasing Native Disposition, that in things of this Nature, where you are not in quest∣ion, I Dare a little Offend: For its a fixed Natural Max∣ime ingraffted in you, to love your Friends Sincerily, and rarely to take offence upon slight failings; Pardon there∣fore this Boldness of mine, I have now a large Field to walk in, and should I further proceed, I am assured I should move that sweet disposed Temper of yours, which is not easily offended, I am silent, only Sr. I hope you shall have no dishonour to Patronize the ensuing Work, where∣in I lay down the whole natural Grounds of Art, in a fit Method, never done before in England, or by any that could ever speak the English Tongue; that thereby I may undeceive those, who have been miss-led by the received, musty Opinion of Argol, Regiomontanus, and others, and thus much from him, who wishes to you, and your Ho∣nourable Consort all Happyness, and Life Eternal.
