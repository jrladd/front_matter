ANd why all this Noise and Splutter against the Women, Harmless Creatures! what have they done to deserve so many Lampoons, Libels, Satyrs? but methinks Gentlemen 'tis not fair Dea∣ling, to commit Acts of open Hostility before you Proclaim a Warr. And we know what Feats you brag have been done, by your little Fire-ship call'd The Satyr against Woman: This Preface therefore is only to let you know, that we have rigg'd out a Female Man of War (if that been't Nonsence) with 30 Guns of a side, which Egad Gentlemen, (as Mr. Bays has it) wee hope will maul you, and so much for that Point.

But Now—what now? why it seems 'twas Nero, and not Caligula, that made such a Wish mentioned in Page 2d. why Gentlemen I hope you'l excuse the want of Learning in a Woman; since upon my word I never read Suetonius nor Tranquillus, for you all know; That a Box of Marmalade, Culpeppers Midwifery, a Prayer-Book, and two or three Plays, is all the Furniture of a Womans Study.
If any of the Characters suite with some Per∣sons to me unknown? I sollemnly profess, there is not one of them level'd against any person what∣soever, but a Skilful Painter, may by the strength of Fancy, draw a Face representing somebody, tho' no body sat for the Pictrue.
