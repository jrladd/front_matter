My most honoured Lord,
I Haue euer founde that constancie in your Fa∣uours, since your first acknowledging of mee, that their durablenesse haue now made me one of your family, and I am become happy in the ti∣tle to be called Yours: That for Retribution, could I haue found a fitter way to publish your Bounties, my thankefulnes before this, might haue found it out; I craue of your Lordship the patronage of my ELIZIVM, which if the Muse fayle mee not, shall not bee altogether vnworthy of your protection; I haue often aduentured vpon desperate vntrodden wayes, which hath drawn some seuere censures, vpon

many of my Labours, but that neyther hath, nor can euer trouble me; The diuine Poemes in this small volume inserted, I consecrate to your Religious Countesse, my most worthy Lady. And so I rest
The honorer of you, and your noble Family,
