THE Subject-matters of this Book (Most Noble and Generous Patriots!) con∣tain the summe and substance of Humane Affairs; and which concerne the Peace and Tranquillity of the Dominions of Princes. And they are those also which are now upon the Wheele, and more particularly and principally in agitation amongst us, like Balls of Fire thrown to and fro in the mid'st of us. You have more then once Determin'd concerning them: And Your determina∣tions claime this Direction and Submission of them to you. And the more peculiar respects which they bear to the occasions of his Majesties Subjects, the like Direction of them also to them. I have en∣deavour'd the impartial stating of them according to the dictates of the three sorts of Laws currant a∣mongst men: And, where our Affairs Domestick have more particularly occurr'd, have avoided, what
 I could, the intermixing with the Heats and Passions of the Times. I do not presume, in the least, in these things (Honourable, and Renowned SENA∣TOURS!) to interpose in your Great and Publick Councels, those Soveraigne Balmes of ENGLAND. Nor to undertake to instruct many of the able and suf∣ficient minds of others, those more Ethereal and Ce∣lestial Beings amongst men. But only, if it may be for Information, if for Satisfaction, where there is Occasion for the giving of it; I have adventur'd the Representing of those great matters which do so highly concerne the Establishment and Preservation of the Peace of Your Country, and of all Humane So∣cieties.
