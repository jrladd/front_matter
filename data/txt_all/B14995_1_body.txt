THe scourge of Carthage and Augustus were
Two pillers of great Rome and taught her how
To make the World beneath her Empire bow;
Yet they sometimes would state affaires forbeare


Their Enius and their Maroes Musae to heare,
Whose tunefull verse did smooth cares ruged brow;
Which custome since those Worthies did alow.
Be pleased (Sir) to lend a gentle eare


Vnto my Muse, and cease some little space
From serious studies worthie pretious time,
To grauest readers verse is no disgrace,


Good wits reape good by reading idle rime,
But smile on these with gentle entertaine,
And they perhaps will cause you smile againe.
