Right Honourable and Right Worshipfull:
THe many deepe tyes and fast-binding
Ligaments of obliged Gratitude,
which have long time tied me in all
sincere observances to both your
good Ladyships; doe extraordinari∣ly
induce, nay enforce me to most serious study and re∣solution
to lay happy hold on all opportunities (though
but in any small measure, rather than to incur the least
suspect of black Ingratitude, hatefull to God and men)
to manifest the integrity of my most gratefull Heart, in
any, in all my sincere Services and best abilities. And ha∣ving
now composed and compiled this little Treatise,
entituled, Babylons Beautie, or The Romish-Catholickes
Sweet-heart; Even a briefe Description of that impu∣dent

and audacious Whore of Rome, the Great Diana of
these back sliding daies. Me thought I could not pos∣sibly
pitch upon more fit Patrons thereof, than your
good Ladiships, my ever worthily most honoured good
Friends, whom I know by most happie experience to
be two most eminently gracious and grave Matrons in
this our Israel; two most fruitfull and faithfull Profes∣sours
and practisers of true Piety and Holines; yea, I say,
two most hearty and heroick haters and contemners of
this Romish-Strumpet, and all her most detestable Idola∣tries
and abhominable superstitious fooleries and mimi∣call
fopperies in Religion, meer baubles of Babel to mock
and cheat the children of errour & disobedience. Accept
then (Right Honourable and Right Worshipfull) I humbly
pray you, this small Symboll and true Testimonie of my
most gratefull heart, and ever, every way, bounden best
services (for many most immerited sweet favours) truly
and duly devoted to both your good Ladyships. Which
singular favour and accustomed Christian Candour will
(and that most meritoriously) extraordinarily add un∣to,
and mightily augment the, already, deep endeerments
of
