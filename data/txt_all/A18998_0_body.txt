SIR, I haue written of late, not by rea∣ding, but on mine owne experience, a conference and discourse about the trai∣ning of horses, and curing of their disea∣ses, wherin albeit I dare professe to teach a readier & better waie in training horse for seruice & trauaile, than hath bene either yet set downe of anie, or put in practise by the delicate professors of this Art, yet my intention was not further then to serue the priuate vse of my priuate friends, till at the last I offered it to the cēsure of a certain honorable Gentleman, whose singular good iudgement & great experience in this mat∣ter I haue euer esteemed aboue al others, who liked so wel of this my labour, that he not onlie thought good it should be printed for the common vse and profit of our Coun∣try, but also vouchsaft by setting of his hand to testifie the same. Whervpon I haue consented to the printing of it, & so haue made it come to light vnder the good protection and countenance of your W. both because of your great knowledge and experience in Horsemanshippe, and in all other vertues, whereby ye draw to you the harts of euerie one that knowes you, and also for your speciall curtesie shewed vnto me: & therfore I haue thus far presumed, til occasiō of further seruice may occur to present you with other flowers or fruits of my experience, which is the onely compas, rule, and square of this discourse. Hum∣bile requesting that yee excuse or pardon the homelie
 stile and tenor of this conference, either because that true experiēce do need no ornament of words, or other waies because I am vnlettered & haue not Rethoricke at com∣maundement. Which if it please you to accept after the ordinarie of your countenance, I meane to enter further in other new and rare Ingins for warre, all of my owne inuention and experience. And thus I end, beseeching God to blesse your life with all increase of Honour.
