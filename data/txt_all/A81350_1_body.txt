MADAM;
HAving a designe to justifie in this Book,
That it is not permitted to a conscience
which is satisfied in the knowledge of
our Religion, to continue in the profes∣sion
of the Romane; and desiring to con∣firm
that by example, which I think I have proved by
reason; I have not found any more illustrious than that
which you have been pleased to give in the sight of
heaven and earth, in quitting the Romane Communion
(which is so sweet, so pompous and advantageous in
worldly respects) to cast your self into the lap of the
true Church; as low and desolate as it appeareth in car∣nal
eyes. This brave and gallant action highly befit∣ting
your Name and Bloud, hath demonstrated, more
evidently than any words of mine are able, That the
souls of those who believe as we do, cannot enjoy the
peace of God, nor assurance of his grace, nor hope of
his glory, in the communion which You have quitted.
For these things are all that you find among us worth
speaking of; all other advantages do far more abound a∣mong
them; nothing but these can you look or hope for
'midst us, who are destitute of all the rest. But You
have judged, that this rich pearl of the Gospel is alone
worth far more then all other commodities beside; & so
have rather chosen to hazard the rest, to assure your self
of this, than to endure for assuring the rest to run any
the least danger in the world of missing this jewell.
MADAM, It is the Almighty who hath inspired into

You, so holy and so wise a resolution, and hath given
You strength to put it in execution at so unfavourable a
time: Whereat the Angels in heaven rejoyce, whereat
the Church on earth praiseth Him. Amidst so many
evils which she suffereth, and more which she foreseeth,
'tis matter to Her of great comfort, that in an age so full
of ill examples, she can find some souls of your quality
and merit, that have courage to disdain reproach, and
can rank themselves under the Crosse of their Saviour.
Even they who approve not your change, admire your
vertue, and cannot deny, but that 'tis a rare and singu∣lar
generositie, which causeth you to preferre the con∣tentment
of your conscience, before all other considerati∣ons.
But besides the joy that your conversion hath
brought to those of the Church, and the admiration
that it affects them with who are out of it, I hope that
your example will be to the great edification of all;
strengthening the one in the Communion wherein they
live, and drawing in the other. Which (MADAM) is
the cause of my mentioning this to you in my en∣trance:
most humbly beseeching you to take it in good
part, and to suffer your name to shine in the front of this
small book; to give weight and light to its discourse, and
to invite all such as shall read it to imitate You, in pre∣ferring
the grace of Heaven, before the interests of
earth; and the solid hopes of Eternity, before the petty
joyes of these few moments which we passe here below.
Which favour if I may (as I hope I shall) obtain from
your goodnesse; I shall earnestly pray our Lord, that he
would communicate to You more and more of his dear
Sonne JESUS (the onely happinesse of our souls)
and crown that obedience, which you have rendred to
Him by confessing His Gospel here, with the blessings
of this and a better world; remaining inviolably,
MADAM,
