THis Essay is design'd for the Entertainment of those Persons of Honour and Quality, &c. that are the ablest Judges and greatest Patrons of the Noble Art of Painting, as also to vindicate the Reputation of those Great Masters, who long since have obliged the World with the incomparable Stroakes of their Immortal Pensils, from the false and spurious Representations that of late hath frequently been made of them. It's by all confessed, that a very good and genuine Picture hath a real Excellency and Intrinsick Value, and that they are more or less to be esteem'd, as they appear to be the true Productions of those Great Masters whose Names they bear. The greatest Encouragement for Persons of Honour and Quality, &c. to buy what they fancy, or to make an Addition to what they have collected, is, that the Pictures that are exposed to Sale, shall be warranted to be what they are deâˆ£scribed, viz. Originals, and truly painted by those famous Persons whose Names appear in the ensuing Catalogue.
