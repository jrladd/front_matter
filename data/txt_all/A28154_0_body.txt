WIthout the least Flattery to the Memory of our deceased Au∣thor, I may boldly say, His indefatigable Labours need not be usher'd into the World with studied Eulogyes: And I doubt not but you will concur with me in the same Opinion, when you have perus'd this Book, and confess his own Labours to be his greatest Commendation.

Touching the Subject matter, it con∣tains the several Forms of Settlements of Estates to Uses, with power for Cestuy que use for Life, and in Tayl, to make Joyntures, Leases, and, Grants of Rents: Likewise the Forms of Limitation of Uses for Years; for payment of Debts, discharge of Sureties, and raising of Por∣tions for Younger Children: It also treats of Limitation of Uses in Fee, for the Lands to be sold to pay Debts, &c.
