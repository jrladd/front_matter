SIR,
I Might easily bring into the Field, and Muster, a Brigade, if not an Army of Motives, which compelld me to Dedicate this Book to you; but because I know you love Brevity, I shall content my self to declare to the World only one of them, viz.
Amongst the few Friends I have, for Old Men generally out-live their Friends, I could not pitch upon any Patron so fit as your Self.
For you were intimately acquainted with the deceased Bishop, the Subject of this Treatise, lovd him, and was intirely belovd by him.
I appeal therefore to you, as Competent Iudge, and an Eye witness, whether what I have said concerning his Hospitality, his humble and obliging Conversation in
Salisbury, be not rather less, than more than it deservd.
You also, as I find by Experience, bear no small Affection to me, which I humbly beg you to continue, as long as I shall approve my self,
SIR,
