IT is impossible (right honorable) for a man to turne himselfe any kinde of way heere in this world, either in cal∣ling to minde generally, the heauens and earth, either yet particulerly, the glorious garnishing, light, brightnes, & mouings of the one, and the great plentie of all sortes of beasts, foules, and fruits of the other, together with the infinite diuersitie of flowres, wherewith God, by his heauenly wisedome and goodnesse, euery yeere afreshe, meruellously clotheth, and repareth them, as it were with rich, and beautifull attyres and colours: But that hee, as of∣ten (I say) as hee beholdeth these so wonderful works of his ma∣iestie, muste euen so often needes confesse that there is set before his eyes, a most large matter & argument for him, to glorifie thee altogether good, & only omnipotēt God, who hath not created all things for the vse of man only, but also euen for his delight and pleasure. For hee is so good and glorious a Father to all his chil∣dren, as that his very meaning is) so wee take them modestly and thankfully) to haue vs freely vse his benefits for our necessitie, yea, and receiue them with pleasure, and delight, without scruple of conscience▪ For els, to what purpose should we haue created such a number of sortes of fruites, differing in substance, strength and nurriture, & of so sundry shapes, in greatnes thicknes, & colour, in smel, tast, & sauor, except it had bin both to strēghtē & delight vs? For doth wine onely strengthen our bodies? doth it not likewise, as Dauid reckoneth it amōgst the benefites of the Almighty, glad the heart of man. And therefore, what is hee that can bee so bloc∣kish, as not to thinke as much generally, of all the rest of the bene∣fites
 of God, which he dayly bestoweth vpon vs, for the sustening of our bodies. Yet notwithstanding, this were not enough for vs, hereupon to acknowledge, as our dutie is, the fatherly care which hee hath ouer our present life, in administring to vs whatsoeuer is needfull for the same: except wee eftsoones learned also heereby, that hee alone, who principally is the father of our soules, (for, it is hee that hath created and regenerated them) giueth the foode of euerlasting life vnto them, by the bread of his holy word: to the end we might be drawn as it were by degrees, by our bodily food to attaine vnto spirituall life: and thereby eternally liue in blisse, which neuer shal haue end. And in deed, the eternall God brought the children of Israel heereunto, by that Manna wherwith he fed them in the wildernesse. Whereupon, it will come to passe, that if we doe, as many of thē did, who made none other reckoning but of stuffinge their paunches, and thereby looked into none o∣ther matter: that wee also shal die, euen as they did. For as it is im∣possible for vs to liue heere in this world, without the vse of bread and other food, which God the Creator hath ordeined, as means wherby he adioyning thereto his heauenly power, would susteine vs in this corporal life: Euen so likewise is it as impossible for vs to be partakers of euerlasting life, except we be fed with this food of the soule: wherewith being appointed by God, to the same end, the holy Ghoste serueth as it were for an instrument, to cause vs possesse, through a liuely and true faith Christe Iesus, who is a∣lone giuen to vs for life, and without whom, we continually abide in death. Wherefore, seeing the soule is more excellent then the body, the heauenly bread more precious then corruptible bread, and euerlasting life, farre more worth, then the transitory life for a day, it is most certaine, that heauenly benefits are without al com∣parison, a great deale more excellent then corporal, and to be pre∣ferred before them. Now, if wee woulde at the least consider, as in deede wee ought, what a benefite were it, to haue the true feare and knowledge of God, in steede of being altogether igno∣rant thereof, and contemning the same: to trust surely in him a∣lone, in stead of trusting too too muche vnto our selues: vnfei∣nedlye to loue our neighbors, in steade of enuying and hating of them, before wee are regenerate: and to haue a pure and
 sounde heart belonging to euerlasting life, in steade of all ini∣quitie, wherein wee bathe and feede our selues as fish in the wa∣ter? To bee short, if wee thinke it no small matter, that all super∣naturall giftes: altogether abolished in man through sinne, be re∣stored to vs, through Christ Iesus alone: and that, reason, vnder∣standing, iudgement, will, and other such naturall giftes, which man had of his Creator, howbeit, corrupted by the same fall, be likewise, through the same Sauiour renued in vs: and to speake in one word, if the image of God, which was defaced by man his dis∣obedience, bee repaired in vs by our Redeemer, who alone hath recōciled vs to God his Father, cleansing vs from our sinnes, ma∣king vs his brethren, and enheritors of the kingdome of heauen, freed from the tyranny of sinne, and of the Deuill, empouerishing himselfe to make vs Princes, and companions with Angels, and by his death recouering vs life: If these inestimable benefites (I say) be not lightly considered of vs, we should esteeme of them, as it is good reason, aboue all other things, yea, we should leaue & forsake all other things, to seeke and enioy them, and neuer bee wearied with any paine, neither yet faint hearted, seeing it is the bread of the word of God that wee must all, seeke after. And this bread, a∣mongst other vertues, hath this, that is, it maketh him who is daily fed therewith, more and more encrease in the vnitie of faith, vntill such time as hee commeth to the fulnesse of a perfect man. And without fayth there is no saluation, and fayth (as the Apostle witnesseth) commeth by hearing, and hearing commeth by prea∣ching of the word, so that without hearing of the word preached, there can be no fayth, and consequently, no saluation. This bread also of the word hath so pleasant a taste, as that if the sweetnesse of honie it selfe, be compared with it, it shall be as bitter as Gal. Sure∣ly, the godliest and best fruits of the earth, in respect of this which restoreth the soule, reioyceth the heart, strengtheneth the weake, and comforteth the afflicted, are all but rotten, and no whit plea∣sant or delightfull. To be short, ouer and besides, that we are with so great pleasure thereby in such sort strengthened, as no tongue is able to expresse, we are moreouer so enriched therewith, as that all the treasures in this world, in regard of it, can be but filthy and stinking. And therefore, euery one is to consider and vnderstande,
 that the whole felicitie of man, resteth in this spiritual foode. Here is likewise to be ioyned withall, that our labour in trauelling for the same, shal not be lost: For, God the Creator, sendeth vs not at this day (thankes be giuen to him for it for euer) scarcitie of this Manna and heauenly doctrine: But most abundantly giueth and poureth it abroad without money, all the world ouer, to all such as hunger after it: But vnto such as are full gorged and lothed there∣with, so that they reiect it, and cast it vp againe, by reason of their vnthankfulnesse, it turneth to them in stead of good nutriment, in∣to deadly poison. And contrariwise the more a man desireth it, the more it nourisheth, & doth him good. Wherefore our good God, and louing Father, knowing what neede we haue to be strengthe∣ned with this spirituall foode, not for a day only, but euen so long as we shall creepe here vpon the earth, and must haue it put into our mouthes like young children, hath appointed Pastors, & Tea∣chers in his Church, soundly and truly to breake vnto al his faith∣ful ones, this bread of his word, Euen as a father who giuing bread to his children, cutteth euery one such a morsel, as he seeth to bee most necessarie for him. And therefore in this behalfe (my good Lord) the Church of England, hath greatly to thanke the lord our God, in that hee hath furnished it, with such a number of godly, faithfull, and sound Ministers, as distribute vnto his people the worde of trueth: For they in stead of confusedly heaping & hud∣ling one thing in an others necke, doe verie familiarly and plainely handle and dispose the matter by peece meale, and after an excellēt good order: and in stead of cutting, tearing in sunder, wreasting it into a wrong sense, and resting in the Barke without making a through entrance, doe soundly, perfectly, truely, verie reuerently, and without falsifiyng, deliuer it vnto vs, and feed our soules with the marow thereof.
Wherefore (right honourable) seeing this foode of the soule which is the word of God, is so precious a thing, as that all the kingdomes of the world are not valuable vnto it, I haue takē bold∣nesse to beseech your honor to be the Patron and defender of this my poore trauell in the translation of these Sermons following, which I haue done for the benefit & good of the meanly lettered sort of my countrimen, verie notably & learnedly handled by M. Iohn Caluin, whose authoritie, & sound dealing in such causes, If I
 should take in hand to commend, I should seeme, (as we say) with a Lanterne to giue light vnto the bright shining Sunne, & therfore wil hold my peace. Againe, the doctrine set down by him in them, affourdeth vnto all the Readers therof so great commoditie of it selfe, as that it needeth not the commendation of any other. And I haue the rather dedicated this my rude translatiō vnto your Lord∣ship, partly, for that I would shew some peece of my humble dutie vnto your honour, as a publike testimony therof, in respect of be∣ing sometimes, as then verie young, brought vp in your L. fathers house: but especially & chiefly, because (Syr) you seeke by al means possible, (the Lord bee thanked for it, & continue you in the same minde all your life long to his glorie) to vse conference with a cer∣teine godly learned man, for the better reforming of your self and your whole family, to the obedience of the word. Which word as Solomon saieth, Shal guide you when you walke, watch for you when you sleepe, and talke with you when you are awake.Prou. 6.22 And in the verse following hee saieth, That the word is a Lanterne, and Instruction, a light, & correction, for instructions, are the way of life &c. Thus haue I my good Lord, boldly presumed of your noble and gracious cur∣esie, to present these Sermons vnto your honour, beseeching you in the behalfe of the Church of God to accept of them. In the meane while, I shall beseech the Lord our God, the Father of all mercy and consolation, to strengthen you in that good course, which he of his meere loue and singular goodnesse, hath so lately begun in you, that you may bee like vnto a confortable bright shi∣ning light in his Church, to shewe your selfe a constant mainteiner of the trueth of the glorious Gospell of his deare Sonne Christ Ie∣sus our Lorde, for the stirring vp of many thereto. And because I feare that I haue troubled your Lordship with an ouerlōg Epistle, I most humbly take my leaue, committing both you, and all your affayres, to the protection of the Almighties most sacred Maiestie. London, the vi. of May. 1581.
