RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
ABout some two yeares since, I (from beyond the Seas) presumed to send your Honour two severall pregnant testimonies, as well of my affection to your service, as of my zeale to your prosperitie; not that I performed those then, or remember them now, in regard of your fortunes, but of your ver∣tues; for I know, that to flatter, is to betray Greatnesse: a vice most ignoble in it selfe, and therefore most improper for your Honours receit, or acceptance, sith your actions still make it apparent to our Sacred Soveraigne, and his most Excellent Majestie to all the World, that you are truely Honourable, truely Noble: and now to second my two former acknowledgements of zeale and dutie to your Ho∣nour, with this third, I (though in a lesse serious, yet more publike manner) presume to make you the Worthy and Noble Patron of the first Booke of my Tragicall Histories, (some of the meane ob∣servations and collections of my slender Travels,) wherein The Triumphs of Gods Revenge against the crying and execrable sinne of Murther, are so eminent and conspicuous, that (except my hopes be∣tray my judgement) they are made obvious to the sight, and conse∣quently profitable to the soule of a Christian; and not to prophane either your Honours eares, or my penne, with the least sparke or shadow of an untruth; my presumption had not beene so ambiti∣ous, to have committed these Histories to the Presse, except with a desire, that in some sort they might thereby represse that hellish sinne, 'gainst which they solely contest and fight, and which in these our dayes (with as much pitie as griefe) makes so bloudie and so

lamentable a progression, thereby to serve as stops and preventi∣ons, in our England, in imitation of the Cataracts of Nylus, which keepe Egypt from being submerg'd with her Inundation: nor had I aspired to shelter them under the wings of your Honours Patro∣nage and protection, but that thereby they might finde the surer pas∣sage, in conversing with the different Opinions, and the safer, in meeting with the selfe-pleasing Censures of the World; and if your Honour please select some few houres from your more serious and weighty Affaires, and vouchsafe imploy them on the different Ac∣cidents these Histories report and relate, I (with as much humilitie as confidence) presume, that you will esteeme them, if not profita∣bly lent, yet not prodigally, nor viciously cast away, in the perusall and contemplation thereof. Howsoever, they proceed from his Pen, whose Heart not onely admires and honours your Vertues, but rejoyceth in the Reward thereof, your Fortunes; for I live not, if in the sincerity and candour of my Soule, I wish not that your Honour may still remaine firme to these, and these eternally fixed and con∣stant to You; and from your Honour, successively to your Posterity, transcendently to your Name.
