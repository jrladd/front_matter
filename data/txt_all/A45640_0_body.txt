SIR,
IT is reported that when one presented unto Antipa∣ter, King of Macedon, a Treatise of Happiness, that he rejected it with this answer, , I am not at leasure: You shall find this a Treatise tending to Hap∣piness here, and hereafter; yet I as∣sure my self, it shall find better enter∣tainment when it kisseth your hand; not only in regard of the novelty, and use∣fulness of the Design, but also the Au∣thor's good intention.

As to the Novelty thereof, though I confess to have met, dispersedly, with many gleanings in sundry Authors; yet the scattered ears were never heretofore (so far as I have searched) collected into Order; the large field of this Argument, lying as a barren soyl, or a desolate wilderness, untilled.
As to the Usefulness, since all goods may be reduced to Bona animi, corpo∣ris, & fortunae, The goods of the mind, the body, and of fortune, as Divine Providence hath liberally fur∣nish'd you with the last, this Manual presents you with the two former. Which three (and tria sunt omnia) rightly improv'd, will add such a lustre each to other, as will make you shine, not only as a Star of the first magnitude in the Sphaere you are in now, but as the Sun it self here∣after, when you shall be higher and richer

in the reversion of a Celestial Kingdom, whereof your temporal Estate thus san∣ctified, & made comfortable by the health of Soul and Body, becomes an earnest. Certes, he is as happy as Solomon in all his glory, who hath health to enjoy his riches, and grace to preserve his health, and the hope of glory (greater than that of Solomon) to remunerate his grace. Riches without health, is but like meat without a stomack, which the best Cook on Earth cannot make relishing or grateful; And health, unless it relates to Soul as well as Body, is but like a Down-pillow to a restless head, which the best Chamberlain cannot make easie enough or refreshing: But when good∣ness shall run parallel with greatness, and healthfulness with holiness, they must needs concenter in the Pole of Hap∣piness.

As to the Auhtor's good Intention, though I be a stranger to your Honored Person; yet receiving my first breath, and part of my Education within the sensible Horizon of Hill hall in Holkham, and having known, for the space of more than three lives in the Law, the splendid Family of your Prede∣cessors there, and receiving from them (I mean the two last of them) no small Favors and Obligations, and not know∣ing how, better to testify my Gratitude to them, than by expressing it to such a person as may be thought worthy in their room to inherit their praises with their Vertues, as well as their Estate, I have therefore presumed to make this Dedica∣tion of the First-fruits of my Labor, such as it is, humbly craving your Pa∣tronage, or pardon; and also beseeching in my Orisons, that the Almighty

preserver of Men would preserver you and yours in health and prosperity both of Body and Soul, together with length of days, (subordinately) by the obser∣vation of such Rules as are prescribed in this Enchiridion; and that He would bless you no less with accumula∣tion of Honors, and fruitfulness of Loyns, that as your Fortunes look green and flourishing, so may your Name also; to the glory of God, the service of your Country, the hope of your friends, and the joy of every one who is no less devoted to your Service than
SIR,
