Besides, this Project may be performed with very little Charge, and also in a short time; for in two Years and an half, the Plantations will be finished, to the benefit of Your Majesty, and great good of the whole Nation; and in three Years, all the Charges (which is only to the Planters) will be re-paid trebble. Thus, leaving it to Your Ma∣jesties Wisdom, and Princely Consideration, (cra∣ving Your Gracious Pardon for this Presumption) I do hear humbly take my leave, and remain,
