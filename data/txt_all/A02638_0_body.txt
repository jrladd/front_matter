LOrde Thomas of Norffolke duke moste gracious
Of noble auncestrie and blood descended
A captain right woorthie and auenturous
And frō Scotlād euen newely retended
Wher Englandes querele ye haue reuenged
In the behalf of our noble kyng Henry
I wyshe you all health, honour, and victorie


¶ And because it hath pleased almightie God
In the right title and quercle of Englande
To vse your stocke as an iron rod
Wherewith to scourge the falsehood of Scotland
In whom is no truthe ne holde of any bande
Ihon Hardynges chronicle, as me thought was
Moste mete to bee dedicated, to your grace


¶ For Hardyng a true herted Englysheman
An esquier valiaunt hardie and bolde
And not vnlearned, as the time was than
Serched out of chronicles, bothe late an olde
All that euer by thesame hath bee told
How frō the begynnyng, Scotlāde dooeth reigne
Vnder kynges of Englande, as their soueram



¶ And Hardynges owne self, hath the partie bee
That from Scotlande, oft tymes hath brought
Their seales of homage and fealtee
Vnto the kyng of Englande, as he ought
Vnto whom the Scottes then sued and sought
Yeldyng to liue in humble subieccion
Of Englandes gouernaunce and proteccion


¶ But that people of their propre nature
Hath euen from the first, been so vntowarde
So vnstedfast, inconstaunte and vnsure
That nothyng maie possibly bee more frowarde
So haue thei continued from thens foorthwarde
Neuer gladde to bee in quiet and rest
But to defeccion, aye readie and prest


¶ Wherefore Thon Hardyng, to his lorde & mai∣ster
Whom in his tyme he serued without blame
Edwarde, first duke of Yorke, and after
Kyng of this realme, the fourthe of that name
In this chronicle affermeth of thesame
That thei will rebell, till by prouision
The kyng of Englād shall haue made theim both


¶ And in deede Englād, hath oft been cōstreigned one
The Scottes slackenesse in dooyng their homage
To pricke forewarde, whē thei would haue refrei∣ned
With yt sharpe spurre of marciall forceage
And to abate their wantonnesse of courage
With the iron rodde, of due correccion
As oft as thei attempted defeccion


¶ For ye Scottes will aye bee bostyng & crakyng

Euer sekyng causes of rebellion
Spoyles, booties, and preades euer takyng
Euer sowyng quereles of dissension
To burne and steale is all their intencion
And yet as people, whom God dooeth hate & curse
Thei alwaies begynne, and euer haue the woorse


¶ Englande hitherto hath neuer lacked power
As oft as nede wer, the Scottes to compell
Their duetie to dooe, and menne of honour
Englande hath had, as stories dooe tell
Whiche whensoeuer the Scottes did rebell
Wer hable at all tymes, theim to subdue
And their obedience, to England renue


¶ Emōges ye whiche noumbre, your noble father
In the twelfth yere of Henry the seuenths reigne
By aunciente recorde, as I can gather
Beeyng of suche credence as cannot feigne
Yode into Scotlande their pryde to restrein
With sēbleable power (as bookes dooen auowe)
And like commission as your grace had now


¶ That season he did so valiauntely
The Scottes vanquishyng and puttyng to flight
That thei ranne awaye moste shamefully
Not hable of hym tabide the sight
Nor hable to sustein, the brunt of his might
Soondrie castelles, he raced down to the grounde
Whiche to the honour of Englande did redound


¶ Kyng Iamy also, makyng greate braggue and vaūte
Hauyng his armie not a myle of that daie

Your father as a captain valyaunt
Made in a moment, for feare to runne awaye
The Scottish kyng, sēding foorth heraldes tway
Chalenged your father, wt many a proude woorde
Battayle to wage, and trye it by the sworde.


¶ And choose thou sir Earle, {quod} kyng Iamy then
Whether we shall fight, armie against armie
Orelles I and thou, trye it manne for manne
For sparyng bloodshed, of either compaignie
That if it chaunce me, to haue the victorie
Nought shall I demaunde, for Englandes losse & thine
Sauig Barwike toune, for euer to bee mine


¶ Then to the heraldes, saied this noble knight
Shewe to your kyng, that in this place purposely
Battayle for to wage, my tentes haue I pight
I am not come to flee, but to fyght sharpely
As where he standeth, he maye see with his eye
And fyrst where he would, bloodshed saued to bee
Therof am I no lesse desirous then he.


¶ Secundarily, where it is his likyng
That I a poore Earle, and of meane estate
Maye combattre, with hym beyng a kyng
That our two fightes, may ceasse all debate
He dooeth me honour, after suche highe rate
That I must nedes graūt, my selfe bound in this case
Humble thankes to rēdre to his grace


¶ Now as for the towne of Barwike, it is knowē
(Which your lorde requireth in case I bee slaine)
Is the kyng my souereins, and not mine owne

So that graunte therof, in me dodeth not remain
But thys maie ye bear worde to your lord again
My person and lyfe, aduenture I shall
More precyous to me, then the round worlde all.


¶ When kyng Iamy, by his heraldes twoo
Spedefullye returnyng, had due knowlage
Muche otherwyse, then he loked for thoo
Of the Earles stout aunswer and message
Fled out of hand, and would no battayle wage
So that your father, retourned home victour
With coumfort, laude, praise, ioye and honour


¶ The same your father, in the fyfth yere
Of our moost noble kyng Henry the eyght
When hys grace and his armie at Turney were
And the same kyng Iamy, of Scotland streyght
Agaynst England, his banner dyspleyght
Vanquished the Scottes, & wt your helpyng hād
Slew there king Iamy, and brought him to Eng¦land


¶ Agayne in the .xv. yere of the same reygne
Your selfe in proper personne, full courageous
Set forth against ye Scottes, without dysdeygne
Lyke a captayne valyaunt and venturous
Wher ye brēt Iedworth, a toune right populous
Wyth diuers victories, that your grace then had
Whiche made all Englande, to reioyse & be glad


¶ The yere folowyng also, as bookes testify
The Scottes came, with an houge power
Of .lx. thousande men vnder the Duke of Albany
Besiegyng Warke castel, thynkyng it to deuour

But heryng that your grace, dyd approch yt houe
The Scottes trembled, and so dyd theyr Duke
And cowardly fled, to their shame and rebuke.


¶ Sembleably, by thys your last viage
Nowe thys last October and Nouember
Made into Scotlande, to their great damage
It dooeth as me semeth, ryght well appere
That when pleaseth our king to send you thether
Your house in hys ryght, is appoynted by God
To bee to the Scottes, a sharpe scourge and rod


Wherfore thys chronycle of Ihon Hardyng
I haue thought good, to dedycate to your grace
Because the same in euery maner of thyng
Doothe best set out the nature of that place
With distaunce of tounes, and euery myles space
Besechyng your grace to take in good parte
Myne honest labours and beneuolent harte
