THis Book is dedicated unto the most noble, and honourable, and wor∣thy of all things, the Principle of God in every man, knowing that it is the ost excellent in vertue, and that from the  hath loved the best things, and delighe i the plain simple path of Truth, and hath no at any time cunningly devised inventions; it hath ever been vertuous in goodness, and a true Lover of such as hath loved uprightness, it hath ever despised vice and vanity, and never could joyn with any evil thing; it hath ever been of an humble meek nature, and tender in compassion to all people; it hath ever been of a peaceable dis∣position and condescending to the lowest state; it hath alwayes loved the good, and delighted in the best things, and in innocen∣cy and simplicity the most perfect, and in

wisdom the most excellent, and it is most re∣nownable in glory, and full of all riches and treasures, the graces and excellency of its vertue and beauty, doth far excel the praise of men. And unto this principle alone, is this Book dedicated, as being unto me the most lovely, renownable, and for ever ho∣norable; for it is that unto me which is the chiefest good, and it doth communicate from it self, the riches of it self, and that to the glory and honour of its own power and wis∣dom over all; and the matter which in this Book is contained, being received and ac∣cepted by it, I shall rejoyce in my labor, how∣ever men distinct from it, may esteem it, for it is not the praise of men that I seek, howbe∣it I am moved to labour in the work of the Lord; but I desire to be manifest to every mans Conscience in the sight of God, and to be approved by his pure eye that seeth se∣crets; and let all glory, and honour, and praise, and renown, be given unto him alone, for ever and ever: and unto the measure of himself in every man, I commend this Book in all humility, reverence and fear.
