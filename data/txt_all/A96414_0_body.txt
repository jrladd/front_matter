Most gracious Soveraigne,
WHereas we your Majesties most humble Sub∣jects, the Commons assembled in Parlia∣ment, have received first by message, and since by speech from your Majesty a com∣mand of restraint, from debating in Parliament your Majesties right of imposing upon your subjects goods exported, or imported out of, or into this Realme: yet allowing us to examine the greivance of these impositions in regard of quantity, time, and other Circum∣stances of disproportion thereto incident: We your said humble Subjects nothing doubting but that your Majesty had no intent by that Command to infringe, the ancient and fundamentall right of the Liberty of Parliament in point of exact discussing of all matters concerning them, and their possessions, goods and rights whatsoever, which yet we cannot but conceive to be done in effect by this com∣mand,
doe with all humble duty make this Remon∣strance unto your Majesty.
Frist, we hold it an ancient, generall, and undoubted right of Parliament, to debate freely all matters which doe properly concerne the subject, and his right or estate; which freedome of debate being once fore-closed, the essence of the liberty of Parliament is withall dissol∣ved.
And whereas in this case the subjects right on the one fide, and your Majesties prerogative on the other, cannot possibly bee severed in debate of either; Wee alledge that your Majesties Prerogatives of that kinde con∣cerning directly the subjects right and interest, are daily handled and discussed in all Courts at West∣minster, and have been ever freely debated upon all fit occasions, both in this and all other former Parlia∣liaments, without restraint; which being forbidden, it is im∣possible for the subject, either to know, or to maintaine his right and propriety to his owne lands and goods, though ne∣ver so just and manifest.
It may further please your most excellent Majesty to understand, that wee have no minde to impugne, but a desire to informe our selves of your Highnesse Proroga∣tive in that point, which (if ever) is now most neces∣sarie to be knowne; and though it were to no other pur∣pose, yet to satisfie the generalitie of your Majesties Sub∣jects, who finding themselves much grieved by these new impositions, doe languish in much sorrow and dis∣comfort.
These reasons (Dread Soveraigne) being the proper reasons of Parliament, doe plead for the upholding of this our ancient Right and Libertie. Howbeit seeing it hath pleased your Majestie to insist upon that judge∣ment in the Exchequer, as being direction sufficient for us without further examination: Upon great desire of leaving your Majesty unsatisfied in no one point of our in∣tents
and proceedings, We professe touching that judge∣ment, that wee neither doe nor will take upon us to re∣verse it; but our desire is to know the reasons whereup∣on the same was grounded; and the rather for that a generall conceit is had, That the reasons of that judge∣ment may bee extended much further, even to the utter ruine of the ancient liberty of this Kingdome, and of your subjects right of proprietie to their goods and lands
Then for the judgement it selfe, being the first and last that ever was given in that kind (for ought appear∣ing unto us,) and being onely in one Case, and against one man, it can binde in law no other, but that person; and is also reversible by Writ of errour granted hereto∣fore by act of Parliament. And neither be nor any other subject is debarred by it, from trying his right in the same or like case, in any of your Majesties Courts of Record at Westminster.
Lastly, we nothing doubt, but our intended proceeding in a full examination of the right, nature, and measure of these new impositions (if this restraint had not come betweene) should have been so orderly and so mode∣rately carried and employed to the manifold necessities of these times, and given your Majesty so true a view of the state and right of your subjects, that it would have been much to your Majesties content and satisfacti∣on, (which wee most desire,) and removed all causes of feares and jealousies from the loyall hearts of your Subjects, which is (as it ought to bee) our carefull endeavour: whereas contrariwise in that other way di∣rected by your Majestie, wee cannot safely proceede without concluding for ever the right of the subject, which without due examination thereof wee may not doe.
Wee therefore your loyall and dutifull Commons, not swarving from the approved steps of our Ancestours, most
humbly and instantly beseech your gracious Majestie, that without offence to the same, we may, according to the undoubted right and liberty of Parliament, proceede in our intended course of a full examination of these new impositions: That so wee may cheerefully passe on to your Majesties businesse, from which this stop hath by diversion so long withheld us. And we your Majesties most humble, faithfull, and loyall Subjects, shall ever (ac∣cording to our bounden duty) pray for your Majesties long and happy reigne over us.
