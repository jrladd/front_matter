Noble Sir.
THe good assurance of your native worth, and thrice ge∣nerous disposition, as also the continuall manifestation of your bounteous favour, and love towards my selfe in par∣ticular, hath so bound my thankfull acknowledgement, that I count it the least part of my service to present the first fruites of my farre-fetcht experience, to the kinde acceptance of your charitable hands: well knowing that though this my worke, owne not worth enough to deserve your patronage, yet such is your benigne humanity, that I am confident you will daigne it your protection, un∣der which it willingly shrowdes it selfe. And as it is reported of that man whose name was Alexander, being a cowardly milke-sop by nature, yet hearing of the valiant courage of that magnificent Hero, Alexander the Great, whose name hee bore, he thenceforth became stout and valorous; and as he was animated by having the very name of puissant Alexander; so shall these my weake and feble la∣bours,

receive life and courage by the patronage of your much esteemed selfe; whereby they shall bee able to out-face the keenest fanges of a blacke mouth'd Momus. For from hence the world may conclude, that either there was some worth in the booke, that caused so wise a person to looke upon it, and to vouchsafe to owne it; or else if they suppose that in charity he fosterd it, as being a poore helpe∣lesse brat, they may thence learne to do so likewise. If here I should take upon me the usuall straine of a soothing Epistolizer, I should (though upon better grounds than many) sound forth a full mouth'd en∣comiasticke of your incomparable worth: but though your deserts may justly challenge it, yet I know your vertuous modesty would not thanke me for it; and indeed your owne actions are the best Heralds of your owne praise, which in spite of en∣vy it selfe must speake you Wise, and truly Noble: and I for my part, if I may but present any thing, which either for its profit or delight may obtaine your favourable approbation, I have already rea∣ped the harvest of my expectation; onely I must desire you to pardon my bold presumption, as thus to make your well deserving name, the frontispeece to so rude and ill deserving frame. Thus wishing a confluence of all blessings both of the throne, and foot-stoole, to be multiplied upon your selfe, and your vertuous Consort, my very good Lady, toge∣ther with all the Stemmes of your Noble family, I take my leave and rest,
