NOT to insist upon the Publick Approbation wherewith this Discourse was Honour'd; nor tho many particular Engagements lying on me, thus to ap∣pear, and under so general a Dedication: In Gratitude to you, whose Beneficent Examples, give life to the Do∣ctrine asserted, I would only thus far declare to the World thereupon; that where-ever any Obligation lies up∣on a Man, Common Honesty leads him to pay the Debt; so may this be accepted as an honest Instance of my Duty and Thankfulness; tho' it is impossible for me, accord∣ing to my small Talent, to discharge the total Summ; Yet would I make this Publick Acknowledgments to be Just and Thankful: For the Apostle make Ingratitude the Compendium of all Impiety, in 2 Tim. 3. 2. These two words, Unthankful, Unholy. And tho' in ge∣neral all Men, who receive Favours, ought to be Thank∣ful; yet certainly every single Person has as much right to chuse the way of expressing his Thanks, as he has a
Propriety to his Complexion, and Fortunes. Moreover, the truest Notion of Gratitude, is never to give real oc∣casion that our Benefactor should Repent that he be∣stowed his Benefit upon us.
Now, as I would thus live, and behave my self to my Friends; so would I give none any just occasion to be∣come mine Enemies; but yet, we must look for Tribula∣tion in an uncharitable World, and Peace only in Christ; and not expect to fare better than himself, and his Apostles, and the best Christians did here: How Innocent, Peacea∣ble, or Beneficent soever we may be, we shall meet with Foes in abundance, and be ever Persecuted with the Vi∣rulent Tongues, or Malicous Deeds of Selfish, Mo∣ross, Proud, Ill natur'd, Angry Wretches, whom I do heartily Pity and Pray for; as even those, who can Prophanely trample upon things Sacred, Proudly Insult over their Spiritual Guides, and Hipocritically Devour, or Sacrilegiously Invade the Churches Patrimony, which Jews and Heathens have abborr'd to do. How Con∣stantly and Faithfully soever we sow our Spiritual things, in greatest Charity to Mens Souls; yet are we deny'd the Grateful, Just, and Meanest Returns, and basely accoun∣ted Mens Enemies for telling them the Truth. But of you my Friends, have I happily Experienc'd better: As Charity is your Glory, and will be your Reward. So Prayeth your most Obliged Orator,
