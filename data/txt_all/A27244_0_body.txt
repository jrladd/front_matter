SIR,
WHEN the Grand-Juries of the County, consisting of so many Gentlemen of Honourable and Eminent Qualities, Reputation and Estates, (with the Approbation of my Lord Chief Baron) were both pleased unanimously to declare, That their Opinions were, It would be
useful to the Publick that these Discourses should be Printed; I thought my self obliged to comply with their Desires: And the rather, seeing I am neither afraid nor ashamed, to give the most publick Testimony of my Fidelity to His Majesty, and Stedfastness to the true National Inâˆ£terests; and hereby I obtain also this occasion of expressing my Gratitude for your many Years Favours and Civilities, being,
SIR,
