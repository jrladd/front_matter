My LORD,
WHen I had the Honour to present this COMEDY to your Lordships perusall I designed it as an ac∣knowledgment, or rather as my first Fruits in the Dramatic way for the many Favours your Lordship had conferr'd upon me. But now it is forced to beg your Pro∣tection from the malice and severe usage it receiv'd from some of my Ill natured Freinds, who with a Justice peculiar to themselves, passed sentence upon it unseen or heard and at the representation made it their business to persecute it with a barbarous variety of Noise and Tumult, that many of the well meaning Spectatours (for I am sure it had very few Hearers) must conclude it a very Criminall performance. As I should never have been vaine enough to have valued my self upon the opinion of such weake Judges, so I am not much mortified at my falling under their Indignation. But tho' I can easily forgive such an ungenerous way of proceedure in relation to my self, who never expected to subsist by the Stage; Yet it is a precedent of dangerous consequence, and may happen to fall very severely upon those Gentlemen whose ill fortune or Genius shall lead them to attempt this sort of writing. An unrighteous Faction may be formed against the Jastest, and most regular Composition; and no man is safe if these Gentlemen (whom we must allow good Criticks in dressing) shall assume to vent their ill grounded Fury, and spet their venome upon every Authour that en∣deavours

to divert them. At the same time 'tis my comfort that better Plays have met with the like fate from un∣thinking imcompetent Judges: And without vanity seve∣ral of a meaner Caracter have found a reception they ne∣ver merited.
'Tis this Reflexion has somewhat releiv'd me under the late miscarryage of my Play and is a sensible satisfaction to me that your Lordship (who is acknowledg'd by all Parties for the most correct and Judicious writer, the truest Judge, and the most disinterested Partron; to be the delight, the ornament, and support of our Age) has been pleased to peruse and approve it. Your single Suffrage weighs more with me, and the thinking part of mankind, then the repeated acclamations of a numerous assembly.
My LORD, Should I vainly presume to discribe eve∣ry inherent and particular Grace, that shines in the con∣stellation of your Lordships Virtue: or enumerate those rare qualifications that have rendred your Lordship so universal∣ly Esteemed, belov'd and admir'd, both at home and abroad; I should loose my self in the Rapture and Contemplation. But your Lordship has already receiv'd incense from hap∣pyer hands but from none that has a profounder honour for your Lordship, then
My LORD,
