Madam,
THough I am justly tender of exasperating so vehement and unfeigned a grief as your Ladiship hath constantly expressed to the noble Mr. Rich (both living and languishing, dying and dead) by my applying any such Balsame as may seem to renew your wound and pain; yet knowing that your Ladi∣ships greatest comforts (next those of divine infusion) arise from those proportions which your just sorrows bear to your generous affections, which are now become the occasion and measure of your affliction, I thought it would neither be offensive to your honour, nor unbe∣seeming my respects, if I justified your exceeding grief, by representing to the world how diservedly you have loved, and how worthily you have mourned, for that Gentleman, of whose honour and happiness (even from his infancy) I was most seriously ambitious.
Hence it is that I have adventured to dedicate to your Name this Funeral Cordial, which was first devoted to adorn the Christian Interment, and revive the honored Name of your dear Husband; that since You lived not long together in your marriage, yet You might, at least, be inseparable in this monument: which aims not to add any further secular pomp to his dust, much less to gratifie the impertinent curiosity of
this or after ages, touching his life, sickness, disease, or death, but rather to advance the glory of God in his unsearchable ways; also to summon such as yet sur∣vive him to consider their latter ends, that they may betimes, even in youth remember their Creator, and apply their hearts to true saving and eternal wisdom.
To these great and good ends I presume your Ladi∣ships passionate piety will permit me to improve so sad a dispensation of providence, whose aspect not only looks to your Ladiship, but to all that stand within the view, reach and terror of so sharp a stroak, which de∣serves to be so far laid to heart by all spectators, until they find their hearts mollified and mended through that gracious virtue, which may by fear of death and grief for sin make way for faith in Christ and love of God. Certainly a penitent and pious use is the best that can be made of such dreadful monitions; that no seeming splendor of prosperity, no vain confidences of youth and life, no cumulations of worldly contents, no momentary honours and imaginary pleasures should either blind or divert any of us from dayly taking a serious prospect of our sins and our souls, of our death and judgement, of our God and Saviour: Nothing in all my lifes observation (except one unparallel'd in∣stance) hath ever faln out of more pregnant and potent influence, to abate the presumption of human vanity, worldly confidence, and earthly glory, than the sudden Eclipse and fall of this great Star, which was but lately risen to its lustre and conspicuity. The contemplation of his so early death is no small warning to us, that are yet living, especially to those, who most dally with death, while they affect a dilatory indifferency as to any pra∣ctise of repentance and true piety; being afraid of no∣thing so much as of being good too soon, as if they
could be too soon in a capacity of happiness.
I know the folly and madness of many, who have had not only ingenuous but religious breeding, is usually such, that though they please themselves in being civil and accomplist toward men, yet they make no scruple of being neglective, rude, affrontive, yea insolent toward God, and therein cruel to their own souls, forgetting (at once) both their moment and God's eternity: which desperate frolick usually holds with many, not only during the adventerous extravagancies of their youth and spring (which is the chief hour of temptation and power of darkness) but it extends by the hardning habits and deceitfulness of our sinful hearts to our Autumn and decline; God knows our vicious accesses to the vanities, and inordinacies of life are early and speedy; but our gracious recesses in order to an holy life and happy death are very flow and late if ever, unless special grace prevent the best of nature, and God's good Spirit perfect the best of our educations.
Madame, I write not at this rate, out of a Censorian vanity to reproach others; but out of an humble sense of my own infirmities; and out of a Christian sympathy to others impendent miseries. Alas 'tis too evident that many persons (otherways of excellent & useful parts) do live amidst the offers of eternal life, and the terrors of eternal death, as if they had never laid to heart, ei∣ther their own or any others death; no nor the death of their blessed Saviour; by the price of whose blood they have been both meritoriously & Sacramentally, redeemed from their vain conversation; It is both a sad and shameful thing to consider, that the least and last thoughts of many (titularly Christians) are de∣voted to their God, their Saviour and their Souls. These grand concernments are late, unwelcome, and but hard∣ly
admitted after the surfeits of sensual pleasures, the crowds and pester of worldly affairs, the importunities of ambitious designs, and other busie vanities, which so ingross the whole man and time, that there is little place allowed in most mens and womens hearts, or space in their lives (which are always upon the confines and brink of death) for that great point of wisedom and work of salvation, which consists in beginning betimes to resist and retrench those evils to which our depraved hearts do naturally prompt us; that so we might with greater speed and less impediment advance to that Su∣pream and immutable good to which as we are in∣vited and beseeched by the tender mercies and love of God in Christ, so by the principles of true reason and re∣ligion, and no less by the real interests of our own safe∣ty, honour, and eternal felicity.
The promoting of all which being my main design in publishing this grave piece, I hope both your Ladiships great sadness and passion, and my own deep resent∣ments for the dead, may be sufficient Apology for my freedom both of tongue and pen toward the living: not only my natural genius prompting me, but my con∣science commanding me (specially in publique and sacred remonstrances) to speak and write out, that is, to use such honest Parrhesie as will least smother wholesome truths or flatter secure sins. Nothing is more deformed then parasitick preachers, or mealy-mouthed Ministers: He that speaketh or writeth (which is a silent preaching, a speech without noise, or words without a voice) in Christs name and authority to sinful and secure mortals had need be in very good earnest, fervent in spirit, unflattering in speech, chari∣tably serious, yea kindly severe, with all meekness of wisedom. For Preachers of the Gospel are ordained of
God to be Antiparasites, purposely to crosse and en∣counter that pleasing but pernitious humor in mankind, which loves to deceive and flatter, even to the death, both themselves and others: the itching sores which others love to scratch, we must wound that we may heal them; and if ever we (the so despised Ministers of Christ) dare to own our selves in our authority and commission (which is divine, or none) it should be at Funerals, when standinng, as it were, upon the Tombs and urns of the dead, we have more then ordinarily the higher ground above the the living; all whose pleasures, profits, pride, power, and pomp should be then like the Moon under our feet, when (as Gods Heraulds, or lesser Angels) we summon all that hear or read us to Death and Judgement: the due and timely prepa∣ring for which is the great lesson Ministers have to preach and people to practise. For which purpose I have used such pathetick freedom of expressing my self, as may (by Gods blessing) be useful and so acceptable to many, but justly offensive to none, that either are truly wise or would be good and happy in Gods way and me∣thod, which is grace and holiness.
The ensuing discourse is now (as your Honour easily perceives) much inlarged beyond the Horary limits of a Sermon, exceeding in length wosi of the ancient Ora∣tions; I wish it might equal them in usefulness, weight and worth. For in recollecting and ruminating my meditations, they easily multiplied, and in transcribing my notes as I had prepared them, I added with Baruch (Jer. 36.32.) many like words to what I had preach∣ed and had penned, but omitted, being necessarily and so excusably contracted in the Pulpit, but now more dilated in the Press, according to my own design and
the desire of others, who have a great empire over me; What then was in my preaching more massive and rough hewen than I intended, I have now malleated and polished, not only to an ampler, but I hope to a more august proportion. That it may be somewhat answerable to those great respects of love and honour which I have not only to this noble Gentleman, but to his honorable Relations, and particularly to his most virtuous Mother; The few years of whose mortal life, as he oft foretold (in my hearing) he should not exceed, so he did not attain to equal them; God verifying his presages by his immature death; being so far distant from his excellent Mother that she might be said to die in her April, but he (her only child) in the February of his age, as many years sooner as a month hath weeks. Due regard to both their memories, also to Your Ladiships honour, who had neerest relation to him, and so greatest affection for him. These, next my highest and more religious designs, may I hope, not only excuse the gravity and prolixity of this Epistle to so young a Lady, but also patronise my thus publishing my self (Madame)
