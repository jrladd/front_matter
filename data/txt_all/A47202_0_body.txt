MY Miscellanies, I offered, un∣to Aaron (your elder Bro∣ther) who is set over us, by our most gracious King; as a ruler of the House of God; I now thinke it convenient; to offer unto you, as to Moses, a second part of my Studies; such as they are, God blesse them to be, as a spurre to your devotion, and as a partiary meanes of your salva∣tion; and then I have my desire, in this world. Let others joy in other matters: Your worth is knowne, you are inwardly indowed with an ex∣cellent spirit; able to discerne evill from good, sha∣dowes from substance. To you therefore doe I flye; stand but you in the gap, and defend what I have written, I aske no more, and desire no lesse, as you knew the particulars study of my youth; and of late (to my wonder) recalled and recoun∣ted
the very Bookes; in which they were written; so now I beseech your Honour to accept with portion of the Studies of my old age. Lastly, you vouchsafed to me many speciall particulars, where∣of our Westerne parts take notice; which binds me for-ever to acknowledge, and be thankefull un∣to you; and to consecrate the best part of my in∣deavours to the honour of your name, which I pray to God, may be as glorious in heaven, as it is on earth; and that in the meane time, you may daily grow up more and more into favour with God, and his sacred Majestie, and as you doe with all good men.
