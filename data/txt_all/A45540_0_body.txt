AS richest Diamonds when enâˆ£shrin'd in Gold,
And set in darkest Foyls, more Rays unfold,
So stands that beauteous ISLE on Rocks and Sands,
Encircled with Great Neptune's watry Bands;

Who when impell'd with Gusts, make haste before,
Dashing themselves, Enamel all the Shore:
This pleasant PILE's the Subject of my Muse,
That late from raging Seas suffer'd abuse,
Now enters Port, and after dreadful Toyls,
To You (Renowned Sirs) gives up her Spoyls.
The Matter, Place, Occasion, every Section
Are Yours, and therefore claims your just Protection.
Accept (Great Sirs) Your own; for by Your Eye
These Cabbin Sea-sick Lines must live or die.
