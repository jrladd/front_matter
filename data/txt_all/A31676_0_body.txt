IT hath been all along (I praise my God) my Inclination as well as my Duty, to serve my Prince and Countrey the Wars in your ever Renowned Fa∣thers time (wherein I had the Honour as well as the Misfortune (as carrying with it the Sacrifice of a Competent Estate) to be, shall testifie for the One, as this small Tract for the Other; as I am a Native of this place; so also for the better part of Twenty years, I was not a Stranger to many Near and Remote Regions, but never could I meet with, or hear of any such Waters as this your City yields, in reference to the perpetual constancy of their Quantity and Quality; on which reason, I have an Ambition and Desire

to Publish this to the World, what continual and inexhaustible Treasures, are stored up here in the Bowels of the Earth, scarce ever made known (at leastwise made use of) till these very late years, the Publication whereof, will Sans-peradventure, advance your Majesties Kingdoms Interest, as conducing so much, to the Longaevity and health of the Nations: rendring them more Numerous and Hardy, (our Air will make them Valiant) and this being granted, as being an indisputable Maxim the Consequence is, Cum multis Manibus grande levatur opus.
May the good God, keep your Majesty, here (long after our Age) in the highest de∣gree of Honour and Health, and when you Change, give you an Incorruptible for a Cor∣ruptible Crown, which hath, is, and shall be the daily and incessant Prayers of

Bath, 16. No∣vemb. 1673.
