THere is nothing Men are more apt to value themselves upon, than the being descended from Great and Honourable Persons; who have either had Noble Blood running in their Veins, or have signalized themselves by a series of Heroical Actions for the good of their Countrey; and by this means have delive∣red their names down to Posterity, Crown∣ed with those Garlands, which the thirst of Glory made them to desire: And yet many thus descended, stain the Memory of their Predecessors; and as far as in them lies, make all their Laurels wither, by Lives led according to their own humour and fancy, and the contagious Examples of a depraved Age.

But you have the Honour to be akin to one who was on earth related to the fa∣mily of Heaven. Your Good Mother after having with continued Patience, sustained the troubles of her weary Pilgrimage calm∣ly at length arrived at her dearest home, where she longed to be.
The Remembrance of her, I doubt not, is a great help to you in your Christian Race, such an example of goodness, so unaffected and sincere, whilst it is always brightly shining before your Eyes, gives you both light and strength to follow her, in the same happy path wherein she went: The frequent thinking on the Holiness of her Life, will be a great Motive to quicken you to be like her in every commendable and praise worthy thing.

St. Paul rejoyced in his beloved Ti∣mothy, and expressed a very lively plea∣sure upon the thought of one that had very good Parents, and was himself ve∣very good: When (says he) I call to remembrance the unfeigned Faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy Grandmother Lois and thy Mother Eu∣nice; and I am perswaded in thee also, wherefore I put thee in remembrance, &c. I hope that the pure and constant Faith that was in your Mother is passed into you; not by a propagation of Blood, but of Spirit; not of Nature, but of Grace. That you and your Relations may meet her and all the blessed Saints with comfort at the Great Day; live to∣gether in that place where there will be no Sin nor Pain, nor Old Age, but an Eternal Holiness, Spring and Youth;
and where our present Weakness shall be swallowed up of Strength, is the hearty Prayer of
