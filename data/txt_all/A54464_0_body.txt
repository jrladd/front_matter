Madam,
WHEN I was once perswaded to make the ensuing Discourse Publick; I did not in the Least doubt with my Selfe to whom I ought to present it. The Place where it was delivered, (as being part of your ancient Paternall Inheritance for which you have done so much and for which you are still doing more good) the many great Favours I have received from your Ladyship, Since my Lot fell in this Soyle; And the Subiect matter of it, Seeme naturally to direct me at what Shrine to Offer it.
The great Esteeme you ever had for that miracle of Vertue and Goodness, our late most Gracious Princess Queen Mary, (now of happy, and glorious Memory,) the tender concern you expresst for her, during her dangerous, and too fat all Sick∣ness, (according to the account you were pleased to give us here in the Country) make me hope that the Offering tho but Small, yet as being well intended, will in some measure attone for my Presumption in placeing your Honours Name before it.
Besides: your great, and Singular Goodness, and Piety; Your extensive Charity, eminently Shown, not only towards those of your owne Town and Neighbour hood, for whom
you and your truly worthy Husband have set up a Linnen Manufacture at your great Charge to employ the many Poor among us, and to afford them a Competent Subsistence; But also your Signall Bounty, and Liberality towards those distre∣ssed Protestants who left their Country, Relations, and all that they had for Christs and his Gospells sake (in both which Remarkeable Instances, you did follow the noble, and truly Christian Example of our late Gracious, and never Sufficiently to bee Lamented Princess) Challenge this Dedi∣cation as your sole Right from me who am so much indebted to your goodness, and Kindness, ever Since I had the Honour to be known unto you; which I shall ever gratefully acknow∣ledge, and take this Opportunity, (as being the only Publick one I may ever have) to testify the same to the World, But shall ever in Private Pray for the Happiness, Well∣fare, and Prosperity of your Ladyship, and most worthy, and truly honourable Family both in this world, and that which is to come; as is the Duty of.
Madam
