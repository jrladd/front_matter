MAdam, I pray, pardon my boldnesse, in that being vnknowne, I dare thus to presse vpon you with these pa∣pers. My excuse is; he who first moued me to preach, and since per∣swaded me to publish this ensuing Sermon, would needs I should in∣scribe it to your Name. It was de∣liuered at the Nuptials of your hope∣full Heire; in that respect, I know it shall finde acceptance. But yet the maine inducement to me, to com∣mend it by this particular direction to your Ladiship, is the constant

report I haue receiued, of your good affection to the least things. In as∣surance of this, I was the more em∣boldened to present you with this Mite, which if it shall afford any comfort either to your selfe, or to any other truly fearing God, I haue all that I aimed at, in imparting it to the common view. For which end I will follow it with my praiers, and to your Ladiship in particular, will remaine, From Modbury,
