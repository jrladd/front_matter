RIGHT Honourable, and truely Noble, as well famous for all vertues in generall, as valour in par∣ticular: There is no worke can be so worthy, but in this mimike and Spleensike age, it is ready euery mo∣ment to be rackt vpon the racke of a harsh censure, but most especially such as write any thing in the defence of those so much persecuted professions, as the Scholler and the Souldier, the which though none pittie them for their pouerty, yet most men enuy for their worth the one, because they can not attaine vnto it: The other, because they dare not bee of it, it is not then to be hoped for: But this my Treatise will meete with ma∣ny calumnies, and the voyce of the Souldier will haue many soggy misty vapour, which breath proceeding from malicious mouths, will seeke to preuent the passage of it: the couetous Carle, who makes his gold his gold, cries out against it, and cannot endure so much as the Eccho of it, he sayes it is so chargeable, and he had rather indanger his person, then indammage his purse: Another is so loath to leaue his Mistresse to find out honour, that the very voyce seemes to him as thunder, and he cannot suffer it; another hath bathed himselfe so long in the sun-shine of peace, as this storme goes to the heart of him, in so much as these my labours are like to encounter with many aduersaries, and this Treatise of Warre, to haue a multitude of warri∣ours against it, it is forced therefore to seek to shelter it self vnder the wings of your protection, whereby it may be preserued from the sury of all the foes, and enuious darts of all the despisers of it. The reason why I commend
it to your Honours tuition, and become an earnest and humble suter to your Honor for your patronage: especi∣ally, is in regard I hope you will somewhat respect it for the names sake you are chiefly elected of the King, as the most experienc't soldiours of this Kingdome to be of his Counsell of warre, and this is the voyce of a Souldiour which doth concord with your Counsell, being as an Ala∣rum, to awake all men out of the slumber of Securitie, to perswade them neuer so much to desire peace as to detest warre, seeing it is an action not onely lawfull but necessary to assume armes, either for the defence of our selues, or the reliefe of others, whose Dominions are vniustly detay∣ned, or tirannically vsurped. Farre be it from me to be too saucie, as to offer to aduise you that were a sinne of horrid presumption, and as great a follie as for the feet to guide the head, or the Asse to Counsell the Lyon, but my intent is to instruct the ignorant, to awake the secure, to com∣mend the valiant, to condemne the cowardly, to raise the reputation of Souldiers, who are now looked vpon with a contemptfull eye, whose soules are captiuated with want & misery, who fight faintly because they are not rewarded brauely, to shew how in former times they which had be∣haued themselues valiantly were recompensed honorably, whereas now a dayes, the meede of their deserts for the most part is a bagge and a wallet, and there gayne the gal∣lowes to deplore the decay of Marshall discipline, the ne∣glect of warlike affaires, the which for a long time lay blee∣ding and were giuing vp the Ghost, vntill your Honora∣ble Counsell recouered them and gaue vnto them life and action. Vouchsafe therefore most worthy Peeres to Patro∣nize this worke, and to daigne to accept of this mite cast into your treasury, respecting not the greatnesse of the gift, but the might of the giuer, who though he can not present vnto you a worke according to his will, yet to the vtter∣most
of his power, whose onely hope is built vpon your acceptance? Oh then doe you respect this present, as God doth our petitions of whome it is said,
Non vox sed votum, non musica cordula sed cor,
Non clamans sed amans, sonat in are Dei.
T'is not the voice, but vow, the heart, not musickes string,
The loue, and not the cry, that in Gods eares doe ring.
Respect therefore in this worke, not the statelinesse of the stile, but the vprightnesse of the heart, not the well pla∣cing of the words, but the goodnesse of the intent, for it is the intention that crownes the action, & what better drift can there be of a mans designes then the weale publick, the presernation of his Countrie, the honor of his Country∣men, the prouision of an Antidote against forrainefoes & forces, the Centinell hath not an idle or vnnecessary office, the watchman in the Citie is not in vaine, he that fore∣warnes his friends fore-armes them, and surely I thinke then, this can not distast any honest, though it may bee some curious Palates howsoeuer: Howsoeuer let me in∣treate you, nay more obtaine so much of your Honours, that as you are a Counseller of Warre, so you would bee Countenancers of this souldiers voyce: that so by your furtherance a more happy successe may crowne my indea∣uoures, my labours be more fruitfull, causing all men to a∣wake out of Securitie, and to be in a readinesse to make resistance against him that is alwayes ayming to giue an assault. So shall you shew your selues to be worthie Coun∣sellers of Warre, Comsorters of Warriers, Causers of the wellfare of this Kingdome, and make the Author of this worke eternally obliged vnto you, who intreateth you to accept his labours as graciously as he offers it officiously, And rests
