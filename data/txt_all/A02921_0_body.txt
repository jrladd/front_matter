GOD FROM THE BEGINNING, hath as in a most cleare and euident glasse, sette forth himselfe to be beholden and knowne of vs, euen in his creatures, & in the orderly course of the worlde. For when we see and consider the vnmeasurable greatnes of the worlde, and the partes thereof to be so framed, as they could not possibly in beautie be fayrer, nor for profit bet∣ter: we vnderstande thereby the omnipotent power of God in crea∣ting them, his diuine wisedome in ordering and disposing them, his infinite goodnes in continually preseruing them, that they runne not to ruine and vtter decay, but are by him vpholden, euen to the neces∣sarie vse and sustentation of mans lyfe. Although this creation of the worlde, and the maruaylous ordering and preseruing thereof were sufficient whereby men might knowe God, and worship him being knovvne, or else be without excuse: yet it hath pleased God of his great mercie to giue vnto vs his worde, wherein he hath more plainly and fully reuealed himselfe, and his will, to our most singular commo∣ditie and comfort. For we through the fall of our first parentes being become blinde in vnderstanding, corrupt in desiring, and wicked in working, are by the worde of God fruitefully of vs receyued, lightned in our myndes, reformed in our affections, and ordered aright in our doings: in so much as the Princely Prophet Dauid sayth, that the meanes whereby a yong man shall clense his waye, is to rule himselfe after this worde, which worde also he pronounceth to be his delight and his counseller, yea he perceyued it to be of such vertue and excel∣lencie, that he preferreth it before all worldly treasures whatsoeuer: I loue, sayth he, thy commaundements aboue golde and precious stone. Agayne, thy lawe is dearer vnto me then thousandes of golde and sil∣uer. But I mynde not to enter here into the worthye commendation of this worde, or to rehearse the manifolde and most singular commo∣dities, which redounde to the godly thereby. Onely that which I haue mentioned out of Dauid may suffice to declare that it is a treasure of all other most precious.
Forasmuch then as the worde of God is a treasure so excellent, what

shall we thinke or say of the true and syncere Preachers and expoun∣ders thereof? VVe acknowledge great friendship in them, by whose meanes we attayne to an earthly commoditie, and howe shall we be affected towarde them, which open to vs the way to an heauenly trea∣sure? VVe thinke our selues much beholden to those, which minister vnto vs the foode of this fraile life: but vvhat recompence shall we render vnto them, by whose meanes we come to enioy the foode of e∣uerlasting lyfe? VVherefore right worshipfull, if I should render a rea∣son of my labour bestowed in translating this treatise into the english tongue, I thinke it were sufficient if I should say no more, but that the word of God is therein soundly and syncerely expounded. Although I may descend vnto particular pointes, and shew other weightie causes thereof. For you are not ignoraunt howe the Papists both haue bine and also be grieuous enemies to the doctrine of iustification by faythe onely in Christ, pretending for their chiefe defence the testimonie of S. Iames, where he seemeth to attribute iustification to workes and not to fayth onely, whose authoritie they haue wrongfully wrested and misinterpreted. VVhereby they haue not onely erred themselues, but also haue caused many other to erre. VVhich false interpretation of theirs is in this treatise very learnedly and throughly improued, and the meaning of the Apostle truly and playnely declared.
Againe, your wisedome doth well know, that the mysteries of God are wisely and discretely to be disposed, and not onely the doctrine of fayth faithfully to be taught, but also the doctrine of workes diligent∣ly to be vrged, both to stoppe the sclaunderous mouthes of many pra∣ting Papists, and also to remedie many abuses very rife among vs. For whereas the syncere preachers of Gods worde doe according to the Scriptures teach, that the bloud of Christ is a sufficient salue for the sore of sinne, and that we are iustified by fayth alone in him, without mens merits, workes, or satisfactions: many sclaundering Papists are not ashamed most falsly to affirme, that they are louers of lusts, prea∣chers of present pleasure, and giuers of libertie to all licentious liuing, and making no store of good workes, doe cast onely fayth vnder mens elbowes to leane vpon. VVhen as the true preachers haue alway preached, and all the writinges of the godly haue most diligently taught, that that fayth, which is not liuely and fruitefull of good works did neuer profite any but to the increase of their owne damnation: and contrariwise, that that fayth, whereby alone according to the Scrip∣tures, they teach that we are iustified, hath good workes necessarily ac∣companying it, not as causes of our saluation, but as necessarie fruites of a liuely fayth, as is also in this treatise of S. Iames very learnedly and diligently declared. VVhereby not onely the Papists are admonished,

that they doe not open their lying lips so wrongfully to rayle vpon the true preachers of Gods word, but also many other are aduertised of their dutie, who by profession are Christians, but in life more then prophane, who are not ashamed to say: if faith iustifie without works, then let vs worke nothing, but let vs onely beleeue and doe what we list, and so like carnall and carelesse liuers they turne the libertie of the Spirite into wantonnes and fleshly libertie. But let these men vn∣derstand, that such prophane profession and carelesse contempt dooth highly displease almightie God, and is diligently detected and sharpely reproued of his faythfull ministers, both in wordes and writings, whose wholesome admonitions let them carefully regard, and be aduertised and brought thereby to follow in workes that vvhich they profes in vvords, least they deceiue them selues, and at the last reape most bitter fruites of their fayned fayth.
Not onely these are in this present treatise admonished of their dutie, but many other most profitable poyntes of Christian doctrine and godly instructions are learnedly handled and liuely set forth ther∣in, vvhereby the Christian readers may learne to direct their doinges, and order their life according to the prescript rule of Gods vvorde. As for them vvhich obstinately refuse, or at the least vvise little regarde such godly instructions as God hath in these dayes (his name be high∣lye praysed therefore) by his faythfull Ministers both by prea∣ching and vvriting offered vnto them: let them remember that they that are of God heare and receiue Gods vvord, and if they doe the contrarie that they are not of God: let them knovv, if they be novv vvearie of it and come to the lothing of it, that their soule is fallen in∣to a daungerous disease. For as a good appetite to naturall foode is a token of the helth of the body, and to refuse and loth the same is a sure signe of some sickenes or disease: so is it likevvise in the soule refusing or lothing the heauenly foode of Gods vvord. Againe let them call to minde, that it vvas aunsvvered to the rich glutton being tormented in hell, vvhen he vvould haue one sent from the dead to admonish his brethren, least they came into that torment, that his brethren had Moses and the Prophets, vvhom they ought to heare, if they vvould auoyde the like fierie flames and hellish torments. Let them assure themselues that the day vvill come, vvhen Christ Iesus shall vvith vnspeakable maiestie and infinite power come to iudge the quicke and the dead, vvhen from the furthest corners of the vvorld shal be heard the sound of the trumpet, vvherevvith all shalbe called to the iudgement seate, then the secretes of all heartes shall be layde open, and the doinges of euery man playnely discouered. Then the vngodly and vvicked ones, vvhich haue in this life despised the vvord of God,

neglected his commaundements and will contayned therein, and not repented them of their wickednes, shall in stede of comfort on euerye side feele extreme dread and horrour. If they looke behinde them they shall see the world consuming with fire, if they looke on the right hand, they shall perceiue a sinnefull conscience accusing them, if they turne to the left, there shall be the deuel readye to receiue them into endeles paynes, if they looke before them, they shall see a terrible and iust iudge comming to iudge them according to their wicked works. VVhereas the godly voyde of all these dreadefull terrours, shall see a most louing Sauiour, who shall then admitte them wholy into the ful fruition of eternall ioy and blessednes.
Seing then the case thus standeth, it is requisite that all men, which minde to be saued, doe search the Scriptures which testifie of this Sauiour, doe diligently heare and reade the worde of God, doe vse such meanes as God hath appoynted to come to the knowledge thereof, and knowing it, doe follow it in their life and conuersation, yea and doe become most heartely thankefull vnto God, that it hath pleased him in mercy to sende to reigne ouer vs, not a tyrannicall He∣rod to oppresse vs, but a most gracious Princes so in peace and god∣lynes to gouerne vs, that the Gospell of Iesus Christ hath not in any age had freer passage, nor hath bin more abundantly and truly prea∣ched and set forth, which God for his Christes sake graunt long to cō∣tinue. So farre then ought all to be of from despising or neglecting the worde and the Preachers and Ministers thereof, that they ought to acknowledge the enioying of it to be an inestimable benefite of God, and to shewe themselues thankfull for so great a benefite, not onely in hearing, reading, and meditating of it, but also according to their a∣bilitie and power it setting in forth and making it knowne vnto other. VVherefore I, according to that small talent, which God hath be∣stowed vpon me, haue employed my trauell in translating this treatise into our mother toung, that those my godly country men, vvhich are ignorant of the Latine tongue may become partakers of such Christi∣an doctrine, wholesome admonitions, and godly instructions as are contayned therein: VVhich treatise, reuerend Father, I thought good to publishe the rather vnder the protection of your name, that therby it might be the more vvillingly accepted, and the better lyked of ma∣ny, vvho haue of a long time knovvne you to be a learned and fayth∣full preacher of Gods vvorde, and an earnest furtherer of all godlynes vvhich God graunt that you may long be, to the great aduauncement of his glory, the singular commoditie of his Church, and the dayly comfort of your ovvne conscience.
