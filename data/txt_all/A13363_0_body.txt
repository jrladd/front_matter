MOST Excellent, gracious, and sa∣cred Soueraigne, I was mooued to take in hande to compyle out vnto your Highnes (so well as my simple learning would

serue me) a briefe Treatise for the readie vse of the Spheare or Globe: A worke, by your poore obedient subiect, with great paines, labour, and studie, made and inuented: with sundrie additions and formes, not heeretofore deuised by anie: no lesse pleasant than profitable for the benefite of your Highnes Common∣weale, to the studious in the Ma∣thematicall Sciences, and to the furtheraunce of Trauellers in the Arte of Nauigation, and to all other your Highnes subiectes that are desirous of the knowledge of the beautifull frame of the Cele∣stiall Orbes with their quantities, dstances, courses, and strange in∣tricate

miraculous motions of the resplendant Globes of the Sunne, Moone, Planets, and Starres fixed. And where it is a thing grafted in Nature, and naturall through custome (right renowmed Princesse) by manifolde sundrie meanes, either by the faculties of the mind, the qualities of the bodie, or the gifts of fortune, for men that are led on by inward affection, to seeke the friendship of those whom they affectionate, or rather in∣wardly loue: wherein euerie man is so liberall, as the giftes of the minde, bodie, or fortune will af∣foord him. Wherein, although I am not so farre endued with anie of

them, that thereby I may deserue anie thing at all: and although the giftes of my minde are vnperfect, if they bee placed against such an obiect, (as without assentation bee it spoken) your Maiesties Royall selfe is; yet weighing with my self, the bountifull goodnesse of your Highnes nature to resemble a roy∣all and fruitefull Tree, which the more it is loaden, the more it decli∣neth: and the naturall gentlenesse and royal clemencie of your Ma∣iesties courtesie, wherewith your Highnes is wont to receiue fauou∣rablie, to conceaue and iudge roy∣ally, of whatsoeuer your Maiesty perceiueth, either to be ouer-slipt by

negligence, let passe by infirmitie, or inserted by ignorance. And con∣sidering likewise the Prouerbe: Candidae Musarum ianuae, the doores of the learned are free from enuie: I purposed by these small fruites of my skill, to make attempt if I could win anie fauourable ac∣ceptance, within the clemencie of your Highnes fauourable protecti∣on. Perswading my selfe, that I might safely commit my rude work to the presence of your Royall Ma∣iestie, who will wisely winke at my wants, and honorably construe the good meaning of my minde. And the more willing was I ledde on to seale it, and as my faithfull alleage∣ance

bindeth me like a dutifull and obedient subiect, to chose out your Highnes most royall worthines a∣boue all other Princes, vnder the Orbes of the Heauens, to present this small worke of mine: because your Maiestie can learnedlie iudge of that which the ignorant can not comprehend. The onely name of your Highnes royall sacred Ma∣iestie, shall be vnto me a sure target of steele, to beate backe the glaun∣cing strokes of vnskilfull tongues: who when they can not find out, by naturall reason, the quantitie and qualitie of superiour bodies, will vtterly condemn the rules of Arts, and quite ouerthrow al euident de∣monstrations:

against whom (be∣cause they denie principles) there is no reasoning nor disputing at all.
If I should stand vpon termes of Arte, and goe about to vnlock the closet of Astronomie vnto your Highnes, whom I know sufficient of your royal selfe to wade through the deepest flouds and swiftest streames contained in the Mathematikes: your Maiestie might iustly saye, Sus docet Mineruam; & I might rather discouer that I want, than your Highnes want that which I set downe. It is better therefore for me to bee silent, considering with what a wise, learned, royall Prin∣cesse I haue to deale, than by need∣lesse

words to open mine owne de∣fects: humbly crauing pardon of your Maiestie for this my bold en∣terprise hoping that your Highnes will not mislike this simple signify∣ing of my bounden duetie. For like as the myte of the poore widdowe mentioned in the holie Scriptures, which she gaue in all her penurie, is accompted a greater gift than those huge summes that great men laid out of their great store: So this my rude Edition of my simple hn∣dy worke, if it may be accepted in∣to your Highnes tution, it shal in∣courage mee heereafter to practise workes of greater importance; and (as it is my bounden duetie) al∣waies

to praye to the Almightie God to blesse and keepe your Maie∣stie in health, tranquilitie & peace, So my daylie prayer is to the same God, to blesse and defend your Highnes from all your enemies, and to raigne and liue ouer vs Nestors yeares.
