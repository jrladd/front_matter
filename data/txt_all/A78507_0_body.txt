My LORD.
I Have read that great Princes have stooped so low from the height of their power, that they have vouch∣safed their Princely favour to the most abject of their people, & gratefully recei∣ved a few drops of fair water from the palm of a poor mans hand; which act of royal acceptance and respect, hath more enobled their names un∣to posterity, then all their deeds of victorious Chivalry and Magnificence. The Considera∣tion of this hath imboldned me to prefer these papers to your Honours acceptance and pro∣tection. The subject is but light, for it treats of love; but so interwoven with stories of heroical resolution, & examples of high perfection that you can read nothing in this nature more pro∣fitable
 or delightfull. The Author was by birth a Spaniard, the same Gentleman that composed Guzman de Alfarache, and the second part of Don Quixot, who in all his writings hath made it as much his study as his mirth, to represent and deride the vanity of those bold inventors, whose wild glory it hath been, not onely to im∣pose upon, but to torment the imaginations of their readers; and instead of possibilities to fill their fables and the world, with Gyants and with Monsters.
The Spaniard (I know not by what fate) is more happy in his prose then in his verse, whe∣ther his Cuentaes cannot so well be taught to run in numbers, or whether the Genius of that Nation is more promptly inclined to expresse it self in Prose then in Verse. Howsoever though he differs in the manner, yet he agrees in the substance, for as the incomparable Sir Phi∣lip Sidney truely observes, it is not the rime but the invention that crowns the Poet, and verse doth no more make a Poet, then a gown doth a Lawyer. The piece in the Original is dedicated to one of the Grandees in Spain, and of the Pri∣vy
 Councel to the King, which hath more incou∣raged me, to present it to your Lordship in the translation. And though there is no man a more absolute master of his passion then your Lord∣ship, and therefore cannot properly be said, to be subject unto love, yet it shal be no dishonor to you to be a lover of the Muses, and to accept these their flowers into your protection; flow∣ers they are, but so sweetly violent, that as their beauties may arrest all eyes, so I doubt not but their perfume through many ages wil continue to testifie unto the world the influence of your protection, and the most gratefull resentments of him who is
(My Lord)
