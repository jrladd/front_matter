Dear Brother,
THe Dedication (as vvell
as Writing) of Books
being strongly vvarrant∣ed
by Custom (the great
Moderatour of our Af∣fairs
and Actions) it ap∣peareth
not injurious to me, that this
Translation pass into the World under
your conduct; vvhose pretentions as
they stand fair to the Patronage of more
sublime Labours, so I am assured they
vvill not be vvanting in their Indulgence
to the Infirmities of this Trifle, upon
vvhich the Book-seller having prevailed

vvith me to cast avvay some spare hours,
as a Complement to my Countrey (at
least to his Interests) I vvas more easily
tempted to undertake it, as vvhat might
be advertisement to you; so that hovv
cheap soever it appear in it self, my dear
Brother hath goodness enough to con∣sider
it, as exposing me to the censure of
thousands upon the single account of di∣verting
him alone; and that having been
a principal design of my life, I make this
address, vvhere my affection, not my
ambition, leads me.
For the Matter, it is the Author must
stand accountable, not I; (and I can as∣sure
you, he is of a passable reputation
in his ovvn Countrey) but for the bad
English, I hope a Fourteen years Exile
may excuse the Errataes in our very Mo∣ther-Tongue.
I vvill not further be∣speak
your protection, left it be judged
the effect of my importunity, and not
your kindeness; I therefore commit you
to Him, vvho hath preserved you and
me, through no ordinary dangers, to see

the Land of our Canaan, though not to
enjoy the fruits of it; but the happiness
of our Soveraign doth virtually com∣prehend
in it that of all His Creatures;
in vvhich number as it is your honour and
mine, upon the score of an unalterable
loyalty, attended vvith many sufferings,
and our best services to stand ranked; so
is it my extream contentment and satis∣faction,
that I may style my self,
Dear BROTHER,
