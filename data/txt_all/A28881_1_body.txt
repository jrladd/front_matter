Learned Sir,
SIXTEEN Years Edu∣cation in a University, and a great many more im∣proved in succesful and judicious Practice, hath sufficient∣ly

qualified You for a Judge and Patron, when I consider the for∣mer and withal my own Weak∣ness, I confess I have less Reason to desire the latter: But sinoe it usually happens that those that are least subject to Faults are commonly candid Criticks, and most ready to forgive others: I am bolder to beg your Patronage; yet not for it's Faults, since that is below your Judgment, but what∣ever Truth is contained in it, which will scarce be deny'd by One that is so much an Encou∣rager of Learning.
But perhaps I ought to make an Apology to You as well as the World, for deviating from the

Opinions of some Learned Men; especiatly of that never too much Honoured Dr. Willis, who was One of the Greatest Physitians of his and preceding Ages. And truly all that I can say for my self, is, That as it would be be∣low the Character of so Great a Man, to write any Thing upon any other Consideration, than an Improvement of Knowledg and Truth; so, undoubtedly, he would not desire any Thing he writ should be believed except it seemed so.
That then which I hope, will be an Apology for such an At∣tempt, is, That I have conside∣red his Opinion, with no other De∣sign

than an Endeavour after Truth, and have offered nothing against his Opinion, but plain and unprejudiced Reasons; and though I have given Reason enough to prove he was mistaken in this Point, yet I must ever have the greatest Veneration and Esteem for all such Men of unparal∣lelled Worth and Learning, and so candidly Ingenuous.
But whether this little BOOK may pretend to any Reason for what it offers or not, I am more encouraged to ask Your Patronage, it being approved by Men of no∣ted Learning and eminently Ju∣dicious, the President and Cen∣sors of the College of Physiti∣ans,

of which Number that your Self is not a Member, no other Reason can be given, but that Your own Choice of a more reti∣red Life hath fixed you in that CITY, where you are now re∣sident, to the Satisfaction and Good of those that commit them∣selves to your Care.
But, Learned Sir, That I may not press too much upon your Patience, That Patronage which you were pleased to Give my Last, when I was a Stranger to You, both encourages me to hope for it, now You have been plea∣sed to take me into Your Favour; and also, that You'll Pardon me for taking this Liberty, since it

is only designed to testify my Gra∣titude for those Favours You have already been pleased to Con∣fer on
