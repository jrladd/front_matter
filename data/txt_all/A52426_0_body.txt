My Lord,
THE peculiar Ho∣nour I justly have for your Personal Worth concurring with that Reverence I owe to your E∣piscopal Character, and that happy Relation wherein I now stand to you as my Dio∣cesan,

obliges me to lay these Papers at your Lordship's Feet; and that which your Eminent Greatness has made a Debt, your no less Illustri∣ous Goodness incourages me to Pay. Upon which Two inducements (the greatest that can be even in Religious as well as Human Addresses,) I humbly presume to tender these Plain Discourses to your Lord∣ship's favourable Perusal and Acceptance, which as they are wholly designed, so I

hope are in some measure fit∣ted for the Advantage of the Publick; not so much in respect of Notion and Specula∣tion, but what is a great deal more wanted in this very De∣generate, though otherwise highly Improved Age, the promotion of Piety and good Life. Which great and ex∣cellent end that your Lordship may yet much better promote, both by the Prudence of your Government, and by the Brightness and Authority of

your high Example, to the Honour and Interest of our most excellent Church, and the Glory of our common Lord and Master, shall be the Constant and Zealous Prayer of him whose great Ambition is to be esteemed
