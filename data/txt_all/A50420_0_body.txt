Right Honourable,
WHen I do usurpe the me∣mory of your Lordships most undeserved courtesie, in admitting me into the number of your Lordships favourites, by appointing me to attend the Sheriffdom of Orkney, as a publick servant unto your Lordship and
the Gentlemen there; I am perswaded to believe, that since your Lordship hath con∣descended to own me in so considerable a manner already, I shall also be patronized in publishing those following discourses, (al∣though they contain many fragile concep∣tions, and such things as will avert all popular Euges in this age, wherein Mr. Culpeper hath been, by the ignorant, more highly esteemed than both Hypocrates and Galen) and be indempnified for demanding the same; your Lordship being the fittest person upon whom I could pitch for patro∣nizing of them, (the first being a Tran∣slation and enlargement of the description of Moffet Well, which I performed since I was dignified to do service to your Lord∣ship) but more especially, of a description of a Well, which was so highly esteemed of by His Majesty, King James the sixth of blessed memory; and of a reprehen∣sory discourse, of most unchristian and trea∣sonable expressions, which were penned by Mr. Culpeper in the hour of darkness and rebellion: because descended of the most ancient and noble Family of the
Douglass, (which hath ever been most fer∣tile of magnanimous souls, whose signal and singular loyalty and courage, did evect them unto the highest pitch of honour, both at home and abroad, throughout all ages, since ever they were known by that name; so that Fame doth glory in having that name listed in her Legend) and of your Lordships most exact corresponding the most sincere loyalty of your immediat Ancestors; at this time, when the demo∣lished MONARCHIE of Great Britain hath been a re-edifying. I will, in the next place, add this most cordial wish, that it would please the Almighty to preserve your Lordship, in those your younger years, and to prolong your dayes to the utmost extent of possibility; and that all the Ho∣nour and noble Enduements of your Pre∣decessors, being multiplied upon your Lord∣ship, your Fame may never know ano∣ther season than a spring. In the mean time, all that I beg, is your Lordships favourable acceptance of this poor offer∣ing, from him who is most zealously am∣bitious, with all the circumstances of gra∣titude
and possible observances, to make good the Title of,
My Lord, 

Kirkwall,
Apr. 22. 1664.
