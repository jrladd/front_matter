QVINTVS
Curcius,
ye famous
wryter of
the greate
Battayles
that Kyng
Alexāder,
the sōne of
Phillippe of Macedone, had a∣gainst
the moost noble, and ritch
Kyng of the Medes and Persi∣ans,
called Darius (ryght wor∣shipfull
sir) declareth that when
one Philippe the Phisicion vnto

the sayde Kyng Alexander, and
his moste trusty subiecte. By so∣dayne
chaunce, the kyng fell sore
sicke, to the great heauines of all
his royall armie, at whiche tyme
with al speade, this phisicion did
prepare a medicine, moste excel∣lente
for his soueraine Lorde,
whome he so dearly loued, to this
ende, that the great vertue therof
might preuent his present sicke∣nes,
& imenint daūger: but mali∣cious
spite, that wretched enemie
whiche neuer slepeth but wat∣cheth
euer, to bringe vertue and
good fame to destructiō Imme∣diatly
before this gentle Philip
did presente him selfe vnto the
kyng with his medicine: Letters
were sent to king Alexander cō∣teining,
that the said Philip wa
corrupted so with money from
king Darius, that he hadde 

moste deadly poyson and vncu∣rable
venyme into Alexanders
medicine. The king perusing the
letters, kept theim secrete vntyll
he had dronke his medicine, and
immediatly he toke his phisicion
by the hande, and deliuered hym
the letters, that he might rede thē
hauing in him so great cōfidence,
that he did in no maner of case
mistruste him. The cause why I
haue alledged this most worthy
prince kyng Alexāder, & his excel¦lent
phisiciō Philip, is to declare
the great truste in the one, & the
fidelitie in the other, not forget∣ting
the shameles condicions of
the flattryng Parisites, whiche
euer wrlketh with two faces in
one hood, bearing fier in the one
hande, and water in the other: so∣wers
of discorde, reapers of mis∣chief:
which be alwaies enemies

vnto the disciples of Philippe,
whose venemous stynges can
not hurte them, which euer haue
in store the precious Iewel of pa¦cience,
and arme them selues to
do good to euerye good man, for
the preseruation of their lyues,
by the trewe rules of the gouer∣ment
of health, whiche here I
am so bold to present vnto your
worship. For where as there lac¦keth
gouernement in a common
wealth, the people dooe eftsones
fall into ruyne. The shippes that
lacketh good gouernaunce, oftē∣times
be cast awaie vpon sandes
and rockes. And therefore there
is nothinge vnder heauen, that
hath lyfe, but if it lacke good go∣uernemēt
it wil quickly fal into
vtter decaie. For like as the crea∣ture
of all thinges, haue formed
the bodies of al mē into the good∣liest

shapes of euery liuing thing
that euer was, or euer shalbe:
Euē so he hath ordeined for mā:
herbes, frutes, rootes, seedes,
plantes, gūmes, oyles, precious
stones, beasts, foules, fishes, for
the preseruation of health, to be
moderatly vsed with discretion,
whiche preserueth the bodye in
good estate, without whose ver∣tues
the bodies can not lyue, for
they be the noryshers of life. But
misusing or abusing them, brin∣geth
to the body many diseases,
as rumes, catores, dropsies, im∣postumes,
gowtes, flixes, opela∣tions,
vertigos, blyndnes, rup∣tures,
fransies, with many moo¦noysome
diseases, which cometh
thorowe the corruptiō of meates
and ill aire. For what auaileth
ryches, honoures, costly buyl∣dinges,
faire apparell, with all

the pompe of this worlde, and to
be honoured of the people, and in
the meane time to be eaten with
wormes in the breaste or in the
belly, consumed with agues, tur¦mented
with gowtes, sorenes,
boneache. &c. Well I thinke, an
hole Codrus is better than a sicke
Mydas.Codrus. Midas. And seing that to possesse
health is better then to gouerne
golde, in so much that health ma∣keth
men more happier, stronger
and quieter then all maner of ri∣ches,
lacking health: as exāple.
Great princes, noble mē, men of
great substaunce, when they bee
wrapped & enclosed with many &
sundry sickenesses, and in dailye
daungers of death, in their ex∣treme
paynes and passions, they
do more greatly coueit one drope
of health then a whole tunne of
gold, criyng out for the helpe and

counseile of the phisicion. Whom
Iesus Sirack,Cap. 38. in his godlie boke did
counsell allwyse men to honour,
and whome the almghtie God,
did create and ordeine for the in∣firmitie
of mankinde, and also
medicine for his helpe, and that
no wyse man should despise thē.
Therfore yet againe (right wor∣thie
Knight) I shall moste hum∣bly
desire you, to except the good
will of him, whiche wyssheth the
yeares of your prosperous lyfe &
health,Nestor. Galen. Argantō. to be equall to Nestor, Ar∣ganton,
and Galen. Whose lyues
were long, healthful and happy.
And thus wyshing the daily en∣crease
of your worship, with con∣tinuall
health, to gods pleasure:
who euer be your guide and go∣uernour,
Amen. Your worships
alwaies to commaunde.
