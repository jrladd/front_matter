Worthy Sirs,
HAving alwaies had a great Honour and Esteem for Men of your Cloath, being descend∣ed from a
Grandchild to Dr. George Me∣riton Dean of York, in the time of Archbishop Mathew. Clergy-Man my self: I have often debated in my thoughts, how I might lay out some part of that small Tallent which God hath blessed me withall to do you Service. And calling to Mind, that Old saying, Ne Sutor ul∣tra Crepidam, I thought it would best become me to keep my self within the Li∣mits of my own Sphear, and so resolved to present you with some little necessary Collection of the Law, relating to Clergy-Men, and having perused Sir  John Dodderidge's little Treatise, cal∣led A compleat Parson Mr. Hughe's Par∣sons Law, and Sir Simon Degg's Par∣sons Counsellor, all relating to the Clergy, I found many things therein, so brief and intricate, that I thought it well worth my time, to inlarge and explain many of them, and to add several other matters which they have not touched, which I imagined would not only be delightsome to peruse, but very beneficial to and worthy of the Clergy's knowledge: So I have taken their works in pieces, and fra∣med a new Modell of my own, and out of their works, with some materials of my own, I have reared this small New Edi∣fice; I know it will not pass without it's Censures, for those Inconveniences which are not discernable upon the projecting of a Modell, are easily discovered and obvious to the Eye after the House is built. Al∣though I have called this Treatise, the Parson's Monitor, yet I know to the Gra∣ver sort it will appear to be no such thing. They perhaps knowing as much if not more then they will find in this Collection, and so cannot be meliorated thereby in their knowledge, yet to the ge∣nerallity of Clergy-Men, I hope it may  prove serviceable, and not without it's use also to the other, for though it bring nothing new to them, yet I presume it mayprove Memoriae Amicus, by continue∣ing those things that are in Memory, Re∣traxing those that are Elapsing, and Re∣trieving the things that were vanished. It is possible several Persons, especially those who have known my Education, will look upon this undertaking as a great piece of presumption in me, that I (who never had the Honour to assume any great∣er Title then a Practicer of the Common Law) should publish this Treatise, when such Learned Men in the Laws, as those aforenamed have written upon the same Subject already; To such Carpers my Answer is, I desire they would not con∣demn me before they hear me speak, for if they please but to give themselves the trouble to Peruse this little Collection, though perhaps at the undertaking there∣of, they may propound to themselves, that it will be time ill spent, yet when they have done, I hope they will not con∣clude it time lost, for although they have the Books aforementioned, and so think this useless, yet possibly this may serve as a kind of Paralipomenon to the others, for let me tell them, that they  will find several things inlarged here, with Additions of several other matters which are not touched there; for I have here brought in the Canons in force, the Articles of Religion, the Privilege of Churches and Church-yards, the Statu∣tes concerning First Fruits, Tenths, and Mortuaries, the Authority of the Con∣vocation and Privilege of the Clergy there, and their menial Servants, and se∣veral other matters which they will not meet with in the other Authors: but put the Case I had medled with nothing, but what they have taken notice of, yet the same Dish dressed after another fashion, often gives a fresh Appetite, and for my own part, I have found nothing more de∣lightsome or gratefull to my Genius, then to reade the same Case, reported four or five times over in several Books for it is variety that makes a Feast. But some perhaps will ask why I have not said some∣thing relating to Tythes, in Answer to which I say, that Sir Simon Degg hath taken such pains therein, as little or no∣thing more can or need be said in that point, and besides, every Parson studies more to be his own Monitor in those things then in the particulars which I have here discoursed of, although there be several  digressions in this ensuing Treatise, which may seem Heterogeneall to the things in∣tended to be discoursed of, yet they fall∣ing accidentally in my way, I hope the Candid Reader will rather Pardon then Condemn me for incerting them; for though at first they may appear perhaps Impolite, yet upon second thoughts, they will not (I hope) be adjudged altogether Impertinent; my Intentions at the first un∣dertaking of this Collection were honest and good, and if the Book fail in the Effects, I wish that any of the Clergy would be so kind as to inform me, where∣in I might be more serviceable to them, that I might manifest to the World, how ready and willing I am to be,
Reverend Sirs,
