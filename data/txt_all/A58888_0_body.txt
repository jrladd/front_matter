BEloved in the Lord, It is now full eigh∣teen years since that I was placed by the hand of Providnce, as a Spirituall Pa∣stor amongst you, upon the death of Mr. Robert Stennings; three years of which time I was forced by the violence of Souldiers, to absent my self from you: these three years only excepted I have been constantly with you; and as the Lord hath given me much health and strength of nature a∣mongst you, so I have spent much of that strength in my private studdies, and publick imployments for you. In witness whereof I can yet produce diverse volumes of Sermons, written by me and published amongst you: but I account this needless, seeing you your selves can witnesse enough, as touching this matter. I will not compare my self with other Spiri∣tuall Labourers in Gods Vineyard, for I know that they have received, some of them ten talents, some five, some two; yet this I may safely say, that I have not hid my Masters one talent in a napkin, but have improved it with diligence for the advance∣ment of his glory and truth amongst you.

 Wherefore after so long a time, it concerns you all to enquire how ye have profited by my Ministry for be ye well assured, that after so much spirituall husbandry as hath been used amongst you, in plow∣ing, sowing, planting, and wattering; the Lord will expect a plentiful crop of saving knowledge and obe∣dience from you.
For my part, I am prone to think the best of you, as indulgent fathers are wont to think of their chil∣dren, I acknowledge that diverse of your friends and allies have dyed in my time; whose life was precious, and whose death was comfortable unto me: and I hope to be better acquainted with them in the world to come, then ever I was in this world. I ac-acknowledge also, that there are diverse now living amongst you, of whom I am perswaded such things as accompany Salvation; that they do sincerely love God and his truth, and have not received the Grace of God, nor the word of his grace in vain: and my prayer for such is, That they may persevere in grace unto the end; holding fast the pattern of whol∣some words which they have received; and may ne∣ver suffer themselves to be drawn away with the error of the wicked, and so fal from their own sted∣fastness. And I must needs acknowledge a third sort amongst you, whom I have hitherto apprehend∣ed as proud contemners of the Word of God in my Ministery; I pray God to give them Repentance unto life, that they may recover themselves out of the snare o the devil, and may obtain pardon for this sin before their death; otherwise I tremble to think how hard it wil be with them in the great day of the Lord Christ, when they shall be accountable for every good Sermon, and for every wholesome
 truth, which they have thus contemned and tramp∣led under their feet.
And now my beloved, being desirous before my death to leave among you some token and testimonie of my love towards you, I have published this Treatise, which I call A Discovery of the VVorld to come; some matters herein contained have been delivered in the open Congregation, and here your eyes may see what your eares have heard; yea here your eyes may see more, then yet your eares have heard from me, or from any other as I suppose, touching this subject. I am perswaded in my conscience of the truth of such grounds as are here delivered; and my own soul hath felt the comfort of them, for which cause I am the more hopefull that the same grounds may proove usefull and bene∣ficiall unto others. You may perceive with your eyes, that I have not studdied strong lines and lofty expressions in this work, but have endeavoured in plain and familiar termes to unfold a great Mystery unto you. I do not herein perswade you to seek and search after the knowledge of this present world, and the things hereof; neither do I herein perswade you to love this present world, and the things hereof, you are by nature prone enough unto these things: but hereby I do perswade and intreate you to study the knowledge of the world to come, and to be better acquainted with the Doctrine hereof then yet you are: because I apprehend this as a choyce part and high degree of saving knowledge; and that which will profit you more at the last, then all earthly treasures whatsoever, and I am perswaded it is for want of this part of saving knowledge, that many errours in these latter times, are so readily
 entertained an assented unto.
In brief, you have here a price put into your hands, by Gods providence; the Lord give you hearts to make a good use of it: and if at any time I shall perceive this first part of my Discovery to be accep∣table and useful to the Church of God; I shal forth∣with (if the Lord shal permit) studdy to conceive a Second Part; and as soon as I shall have conceived it, I shall be in travel to bring it forth to publick view. In the interim I commend you to God and the Word of Grace which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance amongst all them that are san∣ctified.
