HOnorable Sir, since
I can truely, let me
confidently affirme,
this boldnesse pro∣ceedes
onely from
the sight of your vertues; I honour
you, and reuerence the executions
of your place; I behold not your for∣tune,
but your selfe: and since it is so,
be content to accept these and mee,
both which offer themselues to you,
not for any thing they can, but wil∣lingly
would do you seruice.
