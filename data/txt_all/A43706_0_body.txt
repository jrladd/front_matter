My Lord and Gentlemen,
SINCE you have been so hard upon me, as to make me Preach, without allow∣ing me time to Think; and harder yet, to make me Publish my undigested Thoughts; I hope

the World will pardon this im∣perfect Discourse, and look upon it, not as a Composition but a Voluntary. But I know not how you can pardon me for exposing your Names before it: nor yet how you can condemn me for taking this innocent Re∣venge. All that I can say to pacify you is, that I am sorry there are so many Faults in this Discourse for you to answer for; and all that I can do to acquit you, is to declare, that as you importun'd me to Publish it, so you were importun'd to it by others; and if it does not an∣swer

their Expectations now, upon second Thoughts; they have the liberty to say that the Ser∣mon is not Good; but their saying so is an Argument that it is True; That the excellent Musick which they heard work'd upon their Affections, and rai∣sed their Good Nature above their Judgment, and made them approve that in the Pul∣pit which they now dislike from the Press: so that in truth, it was not the Sermon that com∣mended the Musick, but the Musick set off the Sermon: for want of which Charm to Guard

it, it now comes into the World Naked and Exposed, like Orpheus without his Harp; and like him must expect to be pulld in pieces, unless you please to Patronize it for the sake of its Subject, and allow it some Favour too upon account of its Author; who has run all this Danger, only to show how much he is
