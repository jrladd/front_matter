RIght ancient Professour of the Trueth,
Long time before it came to cōmon sight:
Which perilous time thou passedst not with sleuth.
But hardily didst hazard day and night,
To bring the Trueth to libertie and light.
Life, Land, and geare, thou set them all apart,
Of that true Treasure so joyfull was thine heart.


Thine house was harbour to all that profest,
Thy geare was common to them in time of need:
Aboue all other thou loued thy brethren best:
As thy own flesh thou didst them cloath & feed:
Not naked loue in word, but loue indeed:
VVhich loue the Lord forget not to restore;
The more thou gaue, hee gaue thee aye the more.


And whē it pleasde Christ Iesus King of grace,
To bring his Trueth to light and libertie,
And by the same, proud Papistes to deface,
And them ouerthrow, with their Idolatrie:
Then did hee call thee to this dignitie,

To plant his Kirke in Gowrie, Mernes, and Angus,
VVhich prudently thou hast planted among vs:


And hast the same oft watered with his word,
Perswading euer to perseuerance:
And not to faint for feare of Fire or Sword:
But bee enarmed with Faith and patience,
Builded on Christ, that Rocke of sure defence,
Thus thou ceast not, but traueilledst faithfully,
Till infirme age perforce constrained thee.


Yea, though thou be now warded, as it were,
Frō tedious trauels, which thou wast wōt to tak,
And mayst not from thy Chamber journey farre:
Yet in thy cure thou art not slow nor flacke:
But as the Bee that doeth collect and make,
Her wholsome honey of many Herbes & Flowers,
So thou thy Sermons of sundry sweet Scriptures:


VVhich thou doest forme into most comly writ,
For speciall profit to thy Posteritie:
Thy louable labours therein ere and late,
VVhen thou art dead, shall liue eternally,
And keepe thy Name in blessed memorie:
That as in youth thy tong taught Christs word,
So in thine age thy penne did preach that Lord.


I Can not dite as thou hast done deserue,
In Kirke & Court, Countrey and Commonweale:
Carefull the Kirke in peace for to preserue:
In Court thy counsell was stout, & true as steele:
Thy policie decores the Countrey well,
In planting Trees, and building places faire,
VVith costly Brigs ouer waters plaine repaire.
