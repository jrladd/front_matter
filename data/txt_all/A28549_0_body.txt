SIRS!
I Here Present you the most Profound Medita∣tions of one of the Bra∣vest Spirits, that was e∣ver Cloath'd with Flesh, and Bloud, viz. the CON∣SOLATIONS of the most Honourable BOETIVS in the midst of His Great∣est Sufferings; With My Earnest De∣sires that Your Selves, and Your Po∣sterity (Escaping His Misfortunes) may ever Follow the High Example of His Heroick Virtues: which Virtues who∣soever shall Attein unto, he certainly

will be More than Conquerour in All the Changes and Chances of this Mortal Life, which both in Sacred and Prophane Writt is term'd a WARFARE. That Famous Apophthegm of SOCRATES in Defyance of His Bloud. Thirsty Ene∣mies, might well have been spoken in the like Case, By a Greater Philosopher than SOCRATES, the Renowned BO∣ETIVS: They may Kill Me, but they Can∣not Hurt Me. Though He does not make any Express mention of JESUS CHRIST in this Philosophical Discourse; yet 'tis well known, how Zealously He Contended for the Truth, Against those Execrable Haereticks that Deny HIM to be GOD,
Whom the Ʋniversal Church (According to the Scriptures) Acknow∣ledgeth to be GOD of GOD, LIGHT of LIGHT, Very GOD of very GOD, Begotten, Not Made, Being of one Sub∣stance

with the FATHER, By VVhom All things were Made.
I Pray GOD we may All Hold the Mystery of the Faith in a Pure Conscience: As did this Excellent Man, Whose Thoughts of the Nature of True Happiness (though in a Style, I must confess not Answearable to His Great Wit, and Eloquence) I have Endea∣vour'd to Express in the English Tongue; which has been no less Adorn'd by those Admirable Writings of Our late SOVERAIGN, than the Latine Tongue by those which the Learned BOETIVS compos'd IN HIS SOLITUDES, AND SUFFERINGS. HE, and BOETIUS, and All the Noble MARTYRS, give Testimony to this Truth, so Elegantly Exprest by His ROYAL Pen:
The Assaults of Affliction may be Terrible, like Sampson's Lion, but they yield much Sweetness to those that dare Encounter,

and Overcome them; who know how to o∣verlive the Withering of their Gourds without Discontent, or Peevishness, while they may yet Converse with GOD.
Wishing You al the Experiences of the Unspeakable Sweetness of the onely True Honour, and Virtue, I Rest
