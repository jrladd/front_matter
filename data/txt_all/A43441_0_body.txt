WEll may my Book come forth like Publique Day,
When such a Light as You are leads the way:
Who are my Works Creator, and alone
The Flame of it, and the Expan∣sion.
And look how all those heavenly Lamps acquire

Light from the Sun, that inexhau∣sted Fire:
So all my Morne, and Evening Stars from You
Have their Existence, and their In∣fluence too.
Full is my Book of Glories; but all These
By You become Immortall Sub∣stances.
