HONOURED LADY!
IN that age when wit and lear∣ning were outconquered by in∣jury, and violence; this Poem was the object of love and Commendations, it being composed by an in∣fallible pen, and censured by an unerring Auditory. In this Epistle I shall not need to make an Apologie: for Playes in generall by exhibiting their antiquity and utility, in a word they are mirrors or glasses which none but deformed faces, and fouler consciences fear to look into. The encouragement I had to

prefer this dedication to your powerfull pro∣tection proceeds from the universall fame of the deceased Author, who (although he com∣posed many) writ none amiss, and this may justly be ranked amongst his best. I have re∣deemed it from the teeth of time, by commit∣ting of it to the press, but in more imploring your Patronage, I wil not slander it with my praises, it is commendations enough to call it Massingers, if it may gain your allow∣ance and pardon; I am highly gratified, and desire only to wear the happy title of,
MADAM,
Your humblest Servant,
