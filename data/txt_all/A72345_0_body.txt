SVch loving favours from your sonne I found,
So kinde affection at your Worships hand,
Though undeserved, that I still am bound,
And unto you and yours obliged stand:


And though that green branch, which ay-springing stood,
As chiefest crowne or garland to your wood,
Be by the stroke of Fate quite cut away,
Ne're shall a thanklesse nature in me sway.


No lofty Cedar, though in height he passe
Each sev'rall plant which desert forrests yeeld;
No Laurell, though Apollo's tree it was;
No Pine for shippes, no Oke ordayn'd to build,
Nor any shrub was halfe so deare to me,
As was that branch falne from the Greenwoods tree:
Which though, as dead, entomb'd in earth it lyes,
A day will come, we hope to see it rise.


Here (worthy Sir) doe I present to you
The timely Buds of my frost-bitten Spring,
And though this trifle not deserve your view,
Yet such a trifle once did Homer sing,
Adorn'd with robes, spun from the wooll of Greece,
Homely by me now clad in English fleece:
Albeit no pleasure in this toy you take,
Yet deigne a kinde aspect for Hargreves sake,
