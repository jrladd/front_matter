ABove Seventy Years have Rolled a∣bout, since a Frenchman, who was by a Ship-wreck made a Captive among the Indians of this Countrey, did before his Expration, as if under some Inspiration, tell those tawny Pagans, That God being angry with them for their wickedness, would not only destroy them, but also people the Place with another Nation, which would not live after their Bruitish manners. And accord∣ingly, thô those Infidels blasphemously Replyed, God could not kill them; yet the Almighty God immediately after this vi∣sited them with a Pestilent and Prodigi∣ous Disease, which swept them away in such vast multitudes, that our first Plant∣ers thereby found the Land marvelously Emptied of its Primitive Inhabitants, and yet almost Covered with their unburied Carcases; while the Survivers were smit∣ten into awful and humble Regards of the English, by the Terrors which the Prophe∣sie had Imprinted on them. Thus, Thou hast brought a Vine out of Europe, O Lord, Thou hast cast out the Heathen and Planted
 it! But we are very stupid, if we do not read an Admonition to our selves, in this Ancient and Famous Providence. Indeed I am not without my lively and ground∣ed Hopes, That our Good God will not ever (or at least, as yet) Remove the People which is now enriching this part of the New World, for Another Nation to suc∣ceed in the room thereof; however there are Ill men enough that have desired it. But we are surrounded with myriads of Dangers, and whether we consider our Cor∣ruptions within us, or our Enemies without us, we may see our selves in a Storm, that calls for the Help of every man aboard. Never did my distressed Countrey more want the Service of all that are in the least capacity to Do for us, than At such a time as this! Be∣hold therefore one little Sermon more sent a∣broad for the Direction and Encouragement of us all, to Do all we can for the Service of a People which is well worthy of our All. I now take no further care about it, but Recom∣mend it unto the Blessing of Him, who is the Hope of New-England, and the Saviour thereof in the Time of Trouble.
