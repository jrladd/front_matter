My Lords and Gentlemen, &c.
THE Dutiful and Devoted Children of the Church of England, having in the late Reign with so much Zeal and Courage, as well as with such va∣riety of Learning defended the Doctrines and Reasons of the Reformation, against all the Accusations of her Romish Adversaries, and some of them also exposing, themselves to great Dangers, rather than truckle to Will and Power, against the Laws and Liberties of their Country, did, to∣gether with many others, think, when their Present Ma∣jesties came to the Throne, that great Numbers of those who had sucked in Prejudices against the Church, by rea∣son of their Education, would either, have come into her Communion, as now being convinced the Clamours against her were false, or else at least would have treated her and her Members with a greater Civility and Respect,

then through their false Conceits of Things, they did be∣fore; but we quickly found ourselves mistaken, and that the AEthiopian could not change his Skin, nor the Leopard his Spots; for presently hoping they had an opportunity to play over their Old Game again, out comes two Books, the one against Diocesan Episcopaty, and the other against Liturgies (two. things they themselves knew the most mo∣derate amongst us, that are honest, will not part withal) these Books were carried up and down in Triumph, and the poor Church of England had met with a Blow that not only stunn'd her, but quite knocked her on the Head; but in a convenient time they had their just Doom, and were, I may with great Truth say, unanswerably answered, the one by Dr. Comber, the present Dean of Durham; the other by the late Dr. Maurice, Professor of the Chair at Oxford.
After this, that the State might have a state of their Civility and Breeding, as well as the Church, a leud Pam∣phlet against King Charles the First was sent out into the World, under the name of Ludlow, whom an Act of Parliament calls one of the most detestable Traytors that ever was, and this dedicated to Sir E. S. Kt. which Li∣bel was spread abroad, and cried up with all the Zeal imaginable, and according as it was designed, it had its effects, and the Party who have left the Communion of our Church, in all Places and Companies, opened their wide Mouths against the Name and Memory of that excellent Prince; upon hearing of which, both in my own private and accidental Conversation, and from many of my Friends, whose Reports I durst credit, I having by Reading the A∣ctions and Sufferings of that King, received other Impres∣sions of him, was resolved, if no better Pen prevented me,

to vindicate that Great Man; and accordingly, the lat∣ter end of the last Year, put out a little Book in the De∣fence of that Prince, having nothing more in my eye, then by so doing, to preserve the Honour and Safety of the Pre∣sent Government in Church and State; which Book no sooner was spread, but I was loaden with a thousand Re∣proaches, which, I thank God, I was the less affected withal, because of the Cause I was engaged in; and withal, because I had provided myself against them, and within three Months after, as if Hell had broke loose, out comes a Letter under the same Name of the Traytor Ludlow, directed to myself, and as pretended, occasioned by my ho∣nest Defence; which Letter, when I seriously read over, I could not contain myself from wonder and amazements; yea, I found myself in various Passions, to wit, of Anger and Grief, I, of Ioy too, not I assure you for the sin of the Book, for that I abhor; but that by the Book, the Government might see the Spirit of the Party, and how far to trust, and when to suspect them.
Now, My Lords and Gentlemen, &c. you would ad∣mire to hear, how this Libel was brought up, lent from one hand to another, with the Character of a delicate and unanswerable Book; and the well-meaning Author of King Charles's Defence, was a Knave and a Fool, and utterly lost as to his Credit and Interest in the New and True Friends of King William and Queen Mary, and the Good Old Cause was now revived, and upon its Legs again, and glorious Days are coming, and all by Virtue of the Influ∣ence of this Letter from Ludlow. Well, in a few days I set myself to a more close Consideration of the Book, and presently found the Author an Imposer upon his Reader, and that he had belyed King Charles in plain Matters of

Fact; upon which I was resolved to expose him, and in a convenient time, by a close application, I drew up this Reply, which I now present to you, hoping thereby to have done something to prevent the spreading of this vile Man's Poyson.
And now, my Lords and Gentlemen. &c. give me leave to be so plain as to tell you, That if this Spirit be not discouraged, but once again get within the Walls of St. Stephen's Chappel, back'd and assisted with Power, it will, my Lords Spiritual, Vote you presently out of the House of Peers, and soon after out of your Bishopricks, and afterwards will vindicate its barbarous usage of you, by declaring you the Catterpillars of the Earth, and the Locissts that ascend out of the bottomless Pit. And for you, my Lords Temporal, Gentry, Clergy, and honest Commoners, it will, after it has branded you with the Names of Malignants, Popish Counsellors, and Adherents to the Interest of the Beast; this Spirit, I say, when in the Chair, will force you to Compositions, Sequestrations, Decimations, Banishment, Imprisonment, and some of you to a Scaffold at Tower-hill, or the Palace-yard; and therefore I cannot but upon this Account open my whole Heart to you, and tell you, (and I care not what Cen∣sures I undergo for it) that next to the Eternal Laws of Nature, and the Reasonableness and Excellency of the Christian Religion, founded in, and purchased by the Blood of Christ, God Man, I think we ought to be zealous in the Defence of this Great King, upon whose Reputation, or Dishonour, and the Principles that maintain the one, or those that propagate the other, depend the Being, and Well-being of our present Church and State, and conse∣quently of the Life and Preservation of our present King

and Queen, together with all their Successors in the English Throne; and this I say upon the greatest delibe∣ration of Mind, without passion or prejudice to any Party of Men whatsoever; and upon this score have I taken upon me the Defence of this Great Man, not in the least wish∣ing ill to, or desiring the Oppression of any sort of Men, who will live quietly and peaceably under Their Majesties happy Government, nor any ways envying their Liberty of Conscience, as long as they make a modest and thankful use of it.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
