May it please your Lordships,
AS your Honours bear a particular Relation to that Goodly and No∣ble Foundation, whereof I

design to give an Account: I had been unjust if I had de∣prived your Lordships of the Patronage of That, which is confirmed unto you by a Royal Hand; for which you have his Majesties Letters Patent. Therefore, in your most Noble Breasts is justly lodged the Right and Ma∣nagement of this glorious and weighty Benefaction: and the Trust is so judiciously seated, that all Wise men conclude, our Generous Founder added more Glory to the Reform∣ed Religion, by choosing such Honourable Patrons, than ever he could expect

from the single Instance of his own Bounty; and so he is become a double Benefa∣ctor.
I find, since the first Foun∣dation, a considerable accessi∣on of Revenues, added by the care and diligence of your Lordships Wisdom: as also a numerous Train of Excel∣lent Orders, made for the better Government and Re∣gulation of the Members therein contained.
After all this, I could not satisfie my self, why all these Great and Magnificent Acti∣ons should lye dormant, and be buried within the narrow

bounds of this Religious House, and not appear to the World in their full Beauty and Proportion: Nor could I render any tolerable Ac∣count of this long continued Silence, unless your Lord∣ships labour to be as Emi∣nent for Humility, and a generous Contempt of Glo∣ry, as you have approved your selves for Fidelity and Conduct.
Upon this Account I am bound to beg your Honours Pardon, seeing I not only begin this way to Trespass; but also add another Crime, by presuming to undertake a

Labour so much above my feeble Strength and Capaci∣ty: However, I am resol∣ved in some measure to have a regard to my Duty (as well as I can) and recom∣mend that to Posterity, which it would be a Sin to conceal. For I must needs declare, I could do no less than pay this humble Acknowledg∣ment to the lasting Glory of our Founder, the deserved Honour of your Lordships, and the Memory I owe to that Place, wherein I had the Happiness to be Edu∣cated.
How often has the warm Influence of your Religious Cares visited these Walls of Retirement? and refreshed the fainting Spirits of the poor Inhabitants: This can∣not but make you the hap∣py Returns of Joy and Glory hereafter. For the Interrogations at the last Day will relate to those Duties, which now are the kind Purposes, and constant Entertainment of your Souls.
That Heaven would gra∣ciously bestow on your Lordships, a long Life, and a continued Happiness, with

all the Blessings of this, and the endless Joys of that World to come, is the hearty Prayer of
