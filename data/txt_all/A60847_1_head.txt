The EPISTLE, Dedicating this little Book (as my last Legacy) to my Dear Wife M. Disney, my honoured Moâˆ£ther, Brothers, Sisters, with other my Dear Relations and Friends; who may have the perusal of God's Dispensations towards me, both in Younger and Riper Years, from my own Pen: who though dead, yet thus speaketh.
