RIGHT HONOV∣RABLE,
HAVING finished this little Translation, the Authour of the Worke, whose Will was to me a Commandment to vndertake the same, did also enioyne me to addresse it to the protectiō of some worthy Patron; which once resolued, I made no difficulty of the choyce. For as your Lord.p may of due iustice challeng the whole interest of all my actions and labours, this subiect in particuler hath most proper relation, before any other, vnto your Lordiship. For besides that it containes many pas∣sages of the lyfe, and to the Honour of your Lo.ps most Worthy, and Honourable Grandfather, so neere, and deere vnto your Lordship; this
 Honourable Lady (whose Vertuous Lyfe is the scope of this treatise) though she were not the na∣turall authour of your Lord.ps lyfe, as in Con∣sanguinity descending from her; yet did she proue herselfe a true and tender Mother, and Grandmo∣ther (which many euen naturall Parents neglect) in preseruing both your Lord.p, and your Honou∣rable Fathers lyfe: and what her sincere affection and continuall care, was of your Lord.p in your tender yeares, none can better testify then your Lo.p. And though your Lo.p were not nourished with the milke of her breasts, yet your Lo.p hath sucked the true tast of her Vertues, and made your selfe an heyre of her Honourable talents. I hope therfore that your Lord.p, in regard of the Sub∣iect, will fauour and countenance the Worke, & beare with the rudenes of the stile, which yet I pre∣sume contayneth nothing but Truth: and therein is the more conformable to this Worthy, and Ho∣noured Lady, who though exteriourly affected no curiosity, yea prudently shunned it; yet contayned in her, the sincerity of true Vertue & Piety. I be∣seech Almighty God, to graunt your Lord.p all Happines and Prosperity, for your present Com∣fort, and eternall Felicity for your future Glory.
