YOu have been pleas'd Calista, to command that
my last follies should be made publick, and
have given that to the diversion of the world,
which I had destin'd only to your own; sure 'tis a want
of goodness, to a person that never wanted zeal or re∣spect
to you, and who by this last proof of his obedi∣ence
hath testified with what submission, he hath re∣sign'd
himself unto your will. If you had esteem'd
this Work, you would have been more covetous of
it; and if you had considered it, as the issue of his fan∣cy,
who will never be but yours, you would not thus
have lavish'd it to the people, who truly have no
share in the intention, that made me write it. Besides,
the success of it is very uncertain amongst them, & one
shal very hardly find charity enough there to hope for
the pardon of many faults, wch you have favorably ex∣cused,
or which self-love made you not perceive in a
thing that was so absolutely your own. But why do I
pretend you should take any care of the reputation of
my writings, since you never took any for the conser∣vation
of my life, and that you have shown your self
more sensible of the fortunes of strāgers, thē of one wch
hath ever been of your own making? I have seen you
as it were marry your self to the passions of my Heroe,
and enter into his thoughts with such marks of ten∣derness
and pity, as my real sufferings have never been
able to draw from you. I have seen your fair eies, those
eies which the Court hath, and doth yet look upon
with dazling and idolatry; shed tears at the recital of

some adventures, which are either feigned or which
hapned very long agoe; and I a thousand times have
at your feet vainly implored that pity, which you so
easily granted to imaginary miseries; Yes, at your
feet have I a thousand times set forth the violence of
my passion in tearms both more express, and more
touching then those that did so mollifie you; and (if I
may be permitted to speak of my self in such a phrase)
I have not been less eloquent in declaring my reall
thoughts to you, then in describing those of a Mace∣donian,
or a Scythian; and yet the same words, wch re∣presented
their mishaps to you, with so much success,
have not found in you the least sense of my own mis∣fortunes.
You will tell me I have painted these illu∣strious
persons in colours which give them a very ad∣vantagious
splendor, and that their admirable quali∣ties
made you embrace their interests, by an esteem
which introduced that compassion into your heart. I
know, Calista, that J am very far from that sublime de∣gree
of perfection, which makes my Heroes worthy
of your tears and friendship; but if they have advan∣tages
above me, by the qualities of their mindes and
bodies, and by the glorious marks of their births and
actions, I have above them the glory of having serv'd
Calista, nay of having serv'd her wth respects & adoratiōs
worthy of her, & of having through the whole cours
of my passion, acknowledged with so much justice the
disproportion there is between Calista and my self, that
in that proud elevation of my soul, Calista, as severe as
she is, could not condemn thoughts so full of zeal and
submission, nor finde occasion to threaten me with a
fall which probably I ought to have apprehended.
Behold my glory, Calista, behold my advantages and

if you pardon a little presumption in him, who hath
had so much as to lift up his eies to you, I will take the
liberty to tel you, that by my maner of expressing it in
another, you may judg vertue is not unknown to me▪
and that many only fail to practise it, becaus fortune
refuses thē the occasions; of this you see an example re∣markable
enough in 2 Princes, whom I make to live
in the same times, & whose fortunes are very different,
though their births and vertues be equal; and that
by your own judgement the most unhappy, and the
least known hath very considerable advantages above
the other, who was most favoured by the destinies, &
who by the help of fortune, hath in his glory, eclipsed
the fame of all that followed him, as well as of all that
went before him. You being generous as you are,
have taken the part of the more unfortunate, and if I
dare reproach you with it, after your own confession
of it to me, you have been even in love with him;
blush not, Calista, he was a Prince worthy of you, and
without doubt the fates should either have reserv'd
him till your Age, or made you to be born in his. But
the Gods took care that his reputation should come
unspotted to our times, and that his life should be pre∣serv'd
from a blemish, which you would infallibly
have cast upon it; his Princess deserv'd his affection
wholly, and only you were capable, to withdraw him
from that fidelity, which renders him so dear to you,
and so recommendable to all the world.
Hitherto J have spoken to you, as to Calista, that is
to say, as to the Soveraign Mistress of my life, and of
all my thoughts; now I speak to you, as to her that is
to read this unworthy Piece again, and to whom J con∣secrate
it with my whole heart, and all my affections.

Besides the consideration of my love, J find in you all
that can be desired in persons, to whom works of this
nature are dedicated. Your quality is most eminent,
too eminent for my hopes; it hath hitherto made a
part of my misfortunes, & it is that wch hath made me
pass many years in your service, without anie other
advantage then that of being yours▪ & of being sufferd
by you. An interessed lover (or rather a captive, who
is your idolater) might seem suspected in praising the
beauties both of your mind and bodie; but the eies and
hearts of all France take my part, and bear witness ge∣nerallie,
that you are the most accomplished of all
creatures. 'Tis therefore under your protection, that
Cassandra coms to put her self; she boasts of having som
resemblance of you, and 'tis with you alone, she seeks
for sanctuarie in the various changes of her fortune;
you wil not know her a great while, though she keep
you verie constant companie, and will wonder to see
her give the name to adventures in which she seems to
have no part at all; but you shall see her come out of
the dark, when you hope least for it, and will know
her again, by lineaments that are not common; You in
her face may find a part of that which shines most vi∣siblie
in yours, and in her carriage you shall neither see
anie thing that can injure you, nor anie thing you can
disavow. If this First Part divert you, the designe I
have to mind nothing but you alone, as the mark of
all my thoughts, will oblige me to give you quicklie
the continuation of her Storie; and though I be nei∣ther
Doctor, nor a passablie Learned man, I am certain
you will never inspire me with mean, low fancies,
since you have inspired into me the resolution of li∣ving,
and dying, Your, &c.
