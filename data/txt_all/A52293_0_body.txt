May it please Your Majesty,
FOR some part of that time, which you have been exposing Your Sacred Person and afford∣ing an unwearied Application for the Good of Christendom and the Advantage of the Reformed Religion, which admirable Endeavours God of his Infinite Mercy has been Pleased to Crown with a suitable Success; I have had the leisure, under Your Majesty's Most Gracious Government and Pro∣tection, to the utmost of my poor Abi∣lities to defend the Cause of our Blessed Saviour and his Holy Religion; against

the Blasphemous Exceptions, which A∣theistical Men do raise against it.
And now, through the Blessing of God, having Finished this Mean Work, I humble beg leave to lay my Papers at Your Majesty's Feet, imploring Your Royal Acceptance and Patronage of Them; which may be a Means to recommend them to some, who ha∣ving Thrown off all respect to our Savi∣our, yet their Worldly Interest may oblige them to retain some for Your Majesty; and perhaps the very name of so Good and so Great a Prince, pre∣fixt to this Book, may occasion them to light upon something therein, which may give them better Thoughts of that Holy Religion, which, Your Majesty does so much reverence and they most unworthily despise. I am not so vain to imagine that my poor Endeavours should ever prove in a like measure successful with Your Majesty's Arms and Conduct; yet by the Blessing of God, I hope, since Your Majesty has so Publickly discountenanced Atheism and Prophaneness, I have a fairer Pro∣spect of gaining some Advantage over the Enemies of Religion, than in any

other Reign, which it has been my Lot to live under.
Dread Sir! may the Good God, who has hitherto prospered Your Great Under∣takings continue to incline Your Heart, zealously to oppose that spreading In∣fidelity, which unless a stop be put to it, will be the Ruin of these Kingdoms, and force Heaven to pour out the last Vials of its Wrath upon us. Now You have happily procured us Peace A∣broad and our Liberties at Home, may You go on in a no less Glorious Design, to Maintain the Cause of our Despised Redeemer, treading in the steps of Your great Predecessor Constantine, who when he had setled the Peace of the Empire and established his Throne a∣gainst his Opposers, set himself next to the Noble Work of promoting Christi∣anity, and to make the Cross of Christ Triumph over the Blaspheming In∣fidels.
God be Thanked, Unbelievers are not so Numerous now as then, but they are not inferior in their Wickedness and their spight to Religion, which if Your Majesty by Your Power and Au∣thority,

can under the Blessing of God, happily suppress and reclaim; this will be a new Accession to Your Glories, and will add fresh Laurels to Your Brow; This will render You yet dearer to God and to all good Men of every Persuasion among us, and will recon∣cile the Affections of Your keenest E∣nemies.
Now that Your Majesty may be as Successful in this as in Your other Great Endeavours, that You may enjoy a long and happy Reign in this World, and an Eternal Kingdom in the next, is the Daily Prayer of,
