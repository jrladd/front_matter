Honourable Sir,
THIS Treatise of He∣raldry, though small in bulk, yet large in sub∣stance comprehending all the cheif and necessary Rules in the said Art, which (with no small labour and pains) are digested in a methodical method (in way of an Ordinary) in several Shields engraven on Cop∣per Plates; and for the Explana∣tion
 thereof the several Coats in each Shield are Blazoned with the names of the Bearers, except to those that are made use of only for Examples; and the number of the Figures refers to the Coat in the Shield, which is reckoned from the first in the Dexter cheif. And un∣der the said Heads, Coats of like Bearings may be comprised, whe∣ther of themselves, or between, or charged upon any of the Honoura∣ble Ordinaries; for it can't be ex∣pected that this small Tract should give Examples of all Bearings this being only designed for a small Pocket Book, and only to give the Rules with Examples of Bearings, to teach the way of Blazoning any Coat Armour.

The second Part is a Treatise of the Nobility and Gentry of Eng∣land as to their Priviledges, Dig∣nities, &c. And for Examples of Bearings I have inserted Atchieve∣ments of each Degree compleat, that is, with all the external orna∣ments as Mantle, Helmet, Crest, Motto, and Supporters, hav∣ing given your Honour's Atchieve∣ment for the Example of a Baro∣net that Bears Supporters a peculi∣ar badge of Honour rarely granted to any under the Degree of a Noble∣man.
Sir as on the one hand, I may pre∣sume to say that there hath been no∣thing yet extant of this nature so full in so small a Compass; so on the other it is my ambition to takes this opportu∣nity
 to express the great esteem I have for your Honour, as well in respect of the nobleness of your Family which renders you a person interessed in this work, as to testifie my grati∣tude for your favours showred upon me for the promoting some former un∣dertakings, being indeed a great fa∣vourer of all ingenuous Arts, and in particular to HERALDRY the Subject of this Book. Sir your generous Spirit hath ever aimed at a publick Good, many admire you, and most love and honour you. Sir you are generally beloved for your generous and noble Actions, for your generous and noble Inclinations, and for your ge∣nerous and noble Principles so that I cannot but receive Com∣mendations
 for selecting you to the Patronage of this Work. Sir, if you pardon this my am∣bition I have my satisfacti∣on, and can be no better con∣tented than in that and in being stiled
SIR,
