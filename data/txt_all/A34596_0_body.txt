Madam,
TO whom should this Tract of Devotion fly for Protection, but to your Self, great Pattern and Patroness of Vertue and Religi∣on? The Rules I here recommend to others, your constant Practice makes Authentick. To your Ladyship therefore, whose Ho∣ly Desires, whose Orthodox and daily Prayers aim at nothing but Heaven and Happiness, and the everlasting Glories of
 God's Mercy-Seat, in all humble Reve∣rence I bend my Knee, and beg leave to dedicate these First-Fruits of my Pub∣lick Labours. Which being crowned by your Ladyship's good Example, may tend to the Honour of God, the Instruction of others, and the eternal Welfare and Happiness of your obliged Servant in Christ Jesus.
