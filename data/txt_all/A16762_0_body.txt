SYr, my acquaintance with you hath not beene litle, nor my loue, lesse; which I wold bee glad to manifest in some better matter thē bare words, and yet, since words well weyed, sometime carry matter of good sence; in the words which I write, I pray you wey the sence of my good will; which if it haue not done so well as I wish, beare with it for a litle fault, and it may bee I will mend it with a greater: but leauing comple∣ments, let me entreat you, in your kindnesse, to Patronage this childe of my best choise, to answere the regard of your good discreti∣on; in whom, though you finde not that

finenesse, that is fitting to phantastike hu∣mours, yet it may bee you shall note some such matter of contentment, as may be a lit∣tle worthy entertainment: the best is this; there is a carefull mothers blessing to her be∣loued sonne: the first I know you haue and the second I doubt not you are: who rea∣ding what I haue written, and remembring what you haue read, I am assured will please her that loueth you, and loue him that here∣in hath pleased you: & for that much good that he knoweth in you, will euer loue you: but seeing it were better that I rather do so, then tell you so, I will leaue my hope to a good occasion to manifest the nature of my affection: And so beseeching God to blesse your forwardnesse in all good actions, and to preserue you from all illusions.
