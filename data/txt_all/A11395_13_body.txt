BOund by thy Bounty, and mine own Desire,
To tender still new Tribute of my zeal
To Thee, whose fauour did the first repeal
My proto-BARTAS from Self-doomed Fire:
Hauing new-tuned to du BARTAS Lyre
These tragik murmurs of His FVRIES fell,
Which (with the Horrors of an Earthly Hell)
The Sinn curst life of wretched Mortals tire:
To whom, but Thee, should I present the same?
Sith, by the breath of Thine incouragement,
My sacred fury thou didst first inflame
To prosecute This sacred Argument.
Such as it is, accept it, as a signe
Of Thankfull Loue, from Him, whose all is Thine.
