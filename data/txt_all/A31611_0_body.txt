Madam,
SInce it is not only usual, but necessary, to present things of this Nature to some Female Saint, under whose Patronage they may rest safe and secure from the severe Lash of detracting, censorious Tongues; I thought it my Duty, as well as Policy, to

send the fair Eromena to bear yon Company.
Tho she was a Princess endued with the greatest gifts of Fortune and Nature, (Wealth and Beauty) yet she resembles the Divine Na∣ture in nothing more than a lowly Humility: and there∣fore, Madam, I have good Reason to presume, that she cannot deny you to be one of her Maids of Honour.
As for the Noble Stran∣ger, he desires to kiss your Hands with as great an Ar∣dency

as ever he did the love∣ly Eromena's; and the only Reason he can give, is, be∣cause you resemble her so well. He well knows what Altars ought to be erected to the Shrines of Wit and Beauty; and it would seem too much of Flattery in me to tell you how much you are Mistress of both: only Madam, be pleas'd to give them a candid and a gracious Entertainment. I dare be security enough, they'l be grateful and ingenious; and wherever they shall for

the future happen to come, I doubt not but they will make good that of the incomparable Shakespear;
Not Marble, nor the gilded Monument
Of Princes shall out-live this powerful Line;
But you shall shine more bright in this Content,
Than dusty Trophies soil'd with sluttish Time.
'Gainst Death and all oblivious Enmity,
Still shall you live, your Praise shall still find room
Ev'n in the Eyes of all Posterity;
Were this frail World sunk to its final Doom.
So till in Judgment you again shall rise,
You live in this, and dwell in Lovers Eyes.
