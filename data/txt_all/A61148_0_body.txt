MOST DREAD SOVERAIGN,
THere is not amongst men a grea∣ter
help for the attaining unto
wisdome, then is the reading of
History. We call Experience a
good Mistris, and so she is; but
as it is in our Scottish Proverb,
It seldome quits the cost: Hi∣story
not so; it teacheth us at
other mens cost, and carrieth this
advantage more, that in a few hours reading, a man may
gather moe Instructions out of the same, then twenty men
living successively one after another, can possibly learn by
their own experience. Therefore hath History by all wise
men been ever held in good estimation: and none thought to
deserve better of the Church and State wherein they lived,
then they that have taken the pains to record unto Posterity
the things fallen forth in their dayes: For there is
no new thing under the Sun; what hath been, or is, the
same also shall be, saith the Preacher.
To know the success and event of every course, there
needs onely the knowledge of things past, and a fit com∣paring
of them with the present. Now this knowledge is
chiefly got by History; The want whereof hath bred in our
Church many strange mistakings: For did men under∣stand
how things went at our Reformation, and since that
time, they would never have been moved to think that E∣piscopacy
was against the Constitutions of this Church; One
of the first things done in it, being the placing of Super∣intendents

with Episcopal Power, in the same, and no act
so often iterated in the General Assemblies of the Church,
as that Ministers should be obedient to their Superinten∣dents
under pain of deprivation. Then for the Consistorial
Discipline brought from Geneva some sixteen years after
the Reformation; did men know the troubles raised thereby,
both in the Church and State, with the necessity that your
Majesties Father of blessed Memory was put to for Re∣forming
that confused Government, they would never ma∣gnifie
nor cry it up as they do. To remedy this want, and let
all that desire to be truly informed of things fallen out in our
times, I took the pains to collect this History, which I do now
humbly present unto Your Sacred Majesty: If the same shall
be graciously accepted, as I cannot but presume upon Your
accustomed humanity to all, I have that I desire: for with
me it is a small thing to be judged of others; God knoweth,
I have followed the Truth, and studied to observe the Laws
of History.
The Collection premitted in the two first Books, concern∣ing
the planting and progress of Christian Religion in this
Kingdome, with the worthy Instruments that God raised to
propagate the true Faith, both here and in the neighbouring
Countries, contained no great matters: as of those first
Ages, whereof we have few or no Records remaining, how
should any great things be truly affirmed? Yet the little I have
found and brought together, may let us see the exceeding
goodness of God toward this Nation, having so soon after
the Ascension of our Saviour unto the heavens, made the
Gospel here to be Preached, and a Church thereby gathered,
which to this day hath found a safe harbour under Your Ma∣jesties
Royall Progenitors. Fourteen hundred years and
above we reckon, since King Donald the first of that name
his imbracing the Christian Faith: All which time there hath
not been wanting in the Royall Stock a most kinde Nursing
Father to this Church: or if a careless and dissolute King
(which in so long a succession of Princes is not to be won∣dred)

happened to reign, the same was ever abundantly
repaired by one or other of the Kings that followed; nei∣ther
did this bring them less happiness then honour; For
give me leave, Sir, to speak it, which I hold not unworthy
of your Majesties consideration, the Scottish Kingdom
once the least of nine Kingdoms that ruled in the Isle, by
the wonderfull providence of God, is now so encreased,
first in the person of your Majesties blessed Father, and
now in your own, as the Scepter of the whole is put into
your Majesties hands, which that you may long happily
sway and your posterity after you to the worlds end, is the
hearty wish of all loyall Subjects. For my part (next to
God his undeserved love) I do ascribe this happiness to the
piety and devotion of your princely Ancestors, and to their
zeal in maintaining the rights and liberties of this
Church. Your Majestie keeping the same course (which
blessed be God you hold) you may be confident of God his
protection against all dangers whatsoever, for he will ho∣nour
them that honour him, and never turn away his face
from his Anointed.
God Almighty I beseech to multiply his blessings up∣on
your Majesty and your Royal Progeny, to give you
the desire of your heart, and clothe all your Enemies
with shame.
So he prayeth that is
