ALthough, right worshipfull, my many employ∣ments well knowne vn∣to you, might seeme a sufficient remora to my pen: yet my desire by all meanes to do good, hath more preuailed with
 me, then those lets where∣with I haue conuersed. These meditations (a testimonie of my desires) I make bold to present vnto you, to whom, if they be worthy of any re∣spect, they do belong in many respects; as I might sufficiently manifest, but that I hold it more expe∣dient to remaine a thank∣full silent debter, then to become a publicke trum∣peter of your priuate fa∣uours.
If you iudge them worthie, vouchsafe them, I pray you, your patro∣nage: if not, your pardon:
 at least your acceptance, as a token of his thanke∣full minde, who will euer rest.
