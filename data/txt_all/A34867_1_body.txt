May it please your Grace,
IT's observed, that the best Physicions having cured and cleansd the body from all foul humours, do prescribe their Patient some wholsom diet or admo∣nition for prevnting future Maladies; which directs me to the consideration of England, a monstrous body without it's Head (late your Patient) and so full of grosse Distempers, that all the advice and help of Europe proved fruitlesse in order to its recovery, untill by Divine Providence your Grace alone become the most Excellent Physician, that without violating her Body, or bleding the least Member, ath cured her, to the admiration of the World, and your perpetual honour.
Most Nble Sir, I may not ask what wholsom Diet or Admonition you have prescri∣bed to prevent the like evills, knowing it's filter for me to hear the Proclamation then to peep in at the key hole of your Councel-chamber: Yet if this which I humbly and freely offer (in the behalf of my Countrey) may receive the honour of your Nble Countnance, and (as you finde it to deserve) your furtherance at the Councel of Trade, (whither the Kings Majesty is graciously pleased to recommend it) I have an assured fidence, it will prove a means to raise two Millions yearly, by the ease of the people; which (if well employed) can prove no prejudice to the future well-being, health, and flurishing estate of England.
My Lord, that this so great a Revenue may be yearly raised, and the people eased, is truth, and I again affirm it; not out of design to prejudice or please others, or to gain the favour of any to my self, but only to enduce some to believe, and encourage all to promote, so great a Benefit, that concerns both the King and his good Subjects in general; whose Interest I ever prized before my own preservation, as your Grace is my witnesse, that knew my integrity before you had made known your intentions of giving this opportunity to pray in publique (as I hope all will) for his Majesty, and your Grace to live to see his long and happy Reign over us. I am
My LORD,
