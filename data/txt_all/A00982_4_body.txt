WHen Siluius Post-humus did seeke this soile,
And therin thought to raigne, to rule, to rest,
Trauailes he found, and stormes, with bitter broile:
But little space in quiet he possest.
Since when, what alterations, and what change,
By Conquest, and by Tyrants bloody hand,
To write at large, it would be true; but strange
To count the troubles of now happy land.
Yet, by eight HENRIES, settled in it selfe;
Lastly, vnited to one Kingdome more,
What needeth it to care for Indian pelse?
Gold, Plate, and Pearle it now possesseth store;
And, more then all, a King, a Queene, a Plant,
A Royall Issue, Parents chiefest ioy,
A Captaine that in time will those supplant
That dare attempt Great Britains least annoy.
Ninth Worthy, worthiest next our Soueraigne be.
God grant, long Raigne of both may Britaine see.
