SIR,
I Had more courage
formerly to prefer
these Poems in the
presence of persons
numerous and no∣ble,
then I have
confidence now to
present this Impression to your more
curious disquisitiō, in regard that then
and there they appeared in the Com∣plement
of all their glory, being much
advantaged with the illustrative facul∣ties
of Musick, Painting, and Dan∣cing.

Sir, in the perusal you will find
that I have strayed from the regular
road of Masks as they were formerly
presented on publike Theaters, not
aiming so much at concatination, as
variation; And I have in these con∣cise
Discourses, rather chosen to
make my persons speak properly then
highly, since (according to the rules
of Horace) aptitude is more commen∣dable
then altitude, Versibus exponi
Tragicis res comica non vult. As they
are I submit them (with all their er∣rors)
to your pardon, humbly con∣fessing
that when I brought this
Mask unto you in my hand, I should
have worn another on my face to ob∣scure
the blushes of
Sir,
