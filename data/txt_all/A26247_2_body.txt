May it please your Grace,
IF it was the opinion of anAnaxandridas. Heathen, Qui
contemnunt laudem, ut interim per ignaviam
nihil gerant laudabile, quum eximiam virtutem
honesta fama comitetur ultro, ac generosis ani∣mis
amor laudum veluti stimulus ad praeclara faci∣nora
sit innatus,
Nazianz. apud Anton. & Max. Serm. de laude. A Fathers authority thus
makes it authentick. Praecipuum est beneficium in
rebus honestis laudari. Laus enim parit emulato∣nem,
aemulatio virtutem, virtus felicitatem, quae fi∣nis
est omnium quae desiderantur, & quo omnis viri
boni motus refertur. Whatever then the duty of
humility, or the temper of a well governed mind
may be judged to be, I hope, the mention of
your worth here, need not make me fear to in∣cur
your displeasure, or render me obnoxious

to the disgust of others for presenting it to
your person, as if we were onely (according as
Duplici ex causa utilius est homini memoriae la∣dem
dare quam vit. Qando nec laudantem adula∣tio
movet nec laudatum tentat elatio. Amb. in Na∣tali.
S. Eusebij. some fancy) Hominis memoriae laudem dare
non vitae. I may boldly and truly say (to answer
what they affirm not to be done while he whose
merits indebt us, survives) Nec laudantem adu∣latio
movere potest, nec laudatum tentare elatio.
(Bernard, in Epist.) If humility be contemptus propriae excellentiae,
yet,Max. Lib. 8. nulla tanta humilitas, quae dulcedine glo∣riae
non tangatur. What if this modest and low
esteem of ones own worthAug. Sup. 1 Reg. Magna acta lauda∣biliter

them too; sinceAugust. Lib. 10. Confessio. Cap. 37. laus bonorum operum sit co∣mes.
Nay the greatArist. 2. Lib. Ethic. Stagarite himself will

witness for us, that,Virtus Mater est gloriae: Sola enim est cui gloria
justa debetur, & secura impenditur. Bern. in Serm. Virtuti debetur laus. I praise
not your,In homine laudandum est quod ipsius est. Familiam
formosam habet & domum pulchram, mltum serit,
multum faenerat? Nihil horum in ipso est, sed citra
ipsum. Laud in illo, quod nec eripi potest nec dari.
Sen. Epist. 41. Family, Palace or Possessions,
no such things as these, which may be esteemed

honores quaesiti ex stemmate, ambitione, aut o∣pum

Vessels, and your Virtues; that cross Fate hath
power to divest you of with the Robes you wear

you, and wil propagate the memory of you to all

Lucan Lib. 2. Eternity. ThereforePlut. in Lacon. it having been the
custom of the Lacedemonians before they went
to war, to sacrifice to the Muses (Licet Musis
nihil videtur cum Marte esse commercii) ut rebus
fortiter gestis contingat honesta commemoratio, ut
egregia gesta verbis celebrarentur a Musis, eloquen∣tiae
praesidibus petendis. Let liberty be granted us
great Noble Sir, to sacrifice to the Muses too
now our Warrs be done, in thankfulness to you
our Victor Mars, whose prudent sweet conduct
hath seemed to charm us to Peace with Musick,
and to make you Apollo, the great president over
them. Had I merit to be confident of your ac∣cepting
and liking this Incense I offer you, I
might be excused for being
