May it please Your Majesty,
HAving no Means to attone for my bold Essay to express Your MAJESTY's glo∣rious Acts, and Virtues upon a small Pillar, (as much too narrow to con∣tain, as my Pen was too short to reach them) but by this Poor Sacri∣fice, making one Presumption the Advocate of the other, (as if Offences bore no Proportion to Your ROYAL Notice, and Clemency without accu∣mulating them) I humbly 
implore
GOD's Representative in Mercy, as well as Power, to be a Saviour in pardoning, as well as preserving. I confess my Attempt as daring and assuming, as that of the Arro∣gant, and Sturdy Giants to scale Heaven, being too great a Task or a general Consult of the most xalted Wits on Earth, if not of Angels, and refin'd separate Souls, of whose Number mine, by fre∣quent Ecstasies of Thanks, and Praises, for the Wonders Your MAJESTY has wrought for us, seems as it were ambitious to be one; as well knowing, that such miraculous Ex∣ploits far transcend the Conceptions, and highest Flights of those that are clog'd with Bodies; which had quite balk'd my Endeavours to describe them, but that those uncontrollable Raptures used Violence upon my Mo∣desty, and a long defeated Expectation of better Pens render'd my Impatience outragious, to find Men silent, where

they cannot be loud enough; as if the Impracticableness of adequate Thanks had pall'd their Spirits; Or the vast Cataracts of Blessings Your MAJESTY pour'd upon us had overwhelm'd; Or the consequent Ease, and Security lull'd them asleep; Or our exuberant Prosperity overgrown the Memory of its brave, and generous Author: The Thoughts of which Ingratitude, what Loyal, or Moral Heart can bear without the highest Indignation? The Fret, and Ferment whereof would have even bursted its Vessel without the Vent I gave it in expressing my Thoughts upon that Pillar; to mind the forgetful, excite the Lethargick, and give all a Model by my Paper∣building to erect more sumptuous and permanent Monuments of what GOD, and Your MAJESTY's unparallel'd Magnanimity, Courage, and Conduct, have done for us.
Since that was my Design, Grati∣tude my Motive, Deeds and Quali∣fications,

that have no commensu∣rate Words, my Theme; I hope De∣fects in Expression will not intercept a gracious Aspect.
If the Book affords any Thing new, or useful, Your MAJESTY is the Au∣thor, as Preserver of our Lives, and Establisher of the necessary Tranquil∣lity for Thoughtful Studies, and In∣ventions; therefore I humbly present it to Your most Sacred MAJESTY, as Men do Oblations to the DEITY from whom they receiv'd them▪ making it (as far as in me lies) doubly Yours, as is,
ROYAL SIR,
