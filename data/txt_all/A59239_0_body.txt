MADAM,
IT was the pressing Desire of
Your Pious Heart, which in∣spir'd
me with a Will to sa∣tisfy
your Christian Enquiry
what true Devotion was, and to
write this Piece. A laudable Am∣bition
to dress up Your Soul in

such a manner, as it might look
Beautifully in the Eye of Heaven,
made You strain towards th' At∣tainment
of It; but Your acute
Understanding did not so easily
find out its certain Idea, nor dis∣cover
clearly what was it's proper
Nature. You were too Wise, to
think it consisted in Light Bigot∣teries;
and those Affections which
were built up from Solid Truths,
were apt to seem too Learned,
and too Rigid for that flexible and
Soul-melting Disposition. Manly
Thoughts appear'd too Stiff, Child∣ish
ones too Weak to compound
it; and it bred in Your Ladyship
no small Difficulty, to hit the
Golden Mean between flying Fan∣cies,

and low Dulness. Nay,
You scarce knew Her when she
was high in Your Self; and were
loath, out of a Humble Errour,
to think the prompt Flights of
Your Spirit could consist with the
Heaviness or Distractedness of Ima∣gination.
Your Ladyship might have dis∣cover'd
Her nearer hand, and bet∣ter
exprest than I can do it here,
in the Exemplary Life and Con∣versation
of the Earl of Kinnoul,
Your every-way most Worthy
Husband. What Virtue was there
which, when occasion presented,
he did not readily Execute? What
Duty, either to God or his Neigh∣bour,

which through the whole
Course of his Life he was known
to neglect? His Piety was stea∣dy
and fervent; his Deportment
Noble and Affable; his calm Rea∣son,
fixt by Christian Principles,
was never shaken or mov'd from
it's just Level, by the Whirl∣winds
of Passion, which toss the
Generality, and shipwrack such
vast Multitudes. His Disregard
of the World was Admirable; or
rather, (to speak more properly
for one of his Rank) his just Re∣gard
of it; esteeming it, and be∣having
himself as if he esteem'd
it, to be what truly it is, a Stage
so to act our respective Parts on,
as to please the Great King of

Heaven, and his Glorious Court,
our Spectators. None of it's gay
Follies affected him; no Bribe,
either of Honour, Profit, or Plea∣sure,
had ever the Power to warp
him. Nor had Dulness the least
share in this unmoved Temper of
his Mind: His Wit was piercing,
and wanted nothing but the ram∣bling
Part of it, which shoots
Bolts at Rovers. Nor was his
Judgment less solid: though he
had not the Vanity to blaze either,
or discover them without precise
Necessity; and, I can speak by
Experience, not very many, even
of those who make a Profession
of Knowledge, understood better
either the Grounds of our Faith,

or the Reasons why we ought to
be Virtuous; I mean, the Pro∣portion
the Means has to the End,
Grace to Glory, or a well-led Life
here, to the Attainment of Eter∣nal
Bliss hereafter. No wonder
then, he clos'd so Pious a Race
with so Happy an End, and look't
upon Death as the Treshold to
Heaven. May we not say, Ma∣dam,
That the Remembrance of
his Life and Death, as from some
Luminary plac't in a Higher
Sphere, sends down their Influ∣ence
upon Your Self; prompting
You powerfully with like Steps,
to follow such a Leader. Who∣ever
considers the strictest severi∣ty
of Your Widdow-state, the

total Application of Your Mind
to Devotion, and Your earnest
straining towards Heaven with
all the Powers of Your Soul, will
discern You proceed as if You
made account the Better Half of
Your Self were there already.
But, I must remember Madam,
You are yet alive, and, in that
Circumstance, just Praises are liable
to be esteem'd Flattery. The rest I
ow'd to the Memory of Your dear
Lord; and to my own Duty, not
to let so great an Example of
exactest Virtue, in a Person of so
high a Rank, especially clouded
by his own sober Modesty, and si∣lent
Humility, be lost to us for want
of proposing it to the World.

To return then to my Matter:
Your Ladyship might, I say, have
found a Living Character of De∣votion
nearer hand, and have
sav'd me all this Labour; and
you already saw all was Virtuous,
all was Saintly throughout the
whole Course of his Life. But
it was the exact Knowledge of
what Devotion was, as distin∣guish't
from the Common Natures
of Virtue and Goodness, which
You aim'd at: For, You had
observ'd, that many were held
Virtuous and Good Persons, who
were not esteem'd Devout; and
that this Word Devotion had some∣thing
in it's Notion particularly
Excellent, not found in the o∣ther.

This Excellency Your La∣dyship
aspir'd to; and therefore,
You wisely desir'd in the first
place, to gain a clear Discernment
of what it was, and in what it con∣sisted,
as singled from other com∣mon
Considerations, belonging
to Goodness, which often run mixt
with it.
Hence, I became oblig'd both
to decypher Devotion, and dissect
Her; and not only so to delineate
Her Nature that it might be par∣ticularly
known, but, by dividing
her into her several kinds, and
treating at large of her Chief
Act, Prayer, to acquaint You
more perfectly with her Compo∣sition.

In a word, You have here
at once my Obedience, and Your
own Duty; and that it may be∣nefit
Your Soul towards it's Im∣provement
in Knowing Virtue,
shall be the daily Prayer of,
Madam,
