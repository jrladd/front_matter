WOrld, I was nce resolu'd to bee round with thee,
because of know tis thy fashion to bee round with
euery bodie: but the winde shifting his point, the
Veine turn'd: yet because thou wilt sit as Iudge
of all matters (though for thy labour thou wear'st
Midasses eares, and ar Monstrum horren∣dum,
informe: Ingens cui lumen ademptum; whose great Po∣liphemian
eye is put out) I care not much if I make description (be∣fore
thy Vniuersality) of that terrible Poetomachi, lately com∣menc'd
betweene Horace the second, and a band of leane-witted
Poetasters. They haue bin at high wordes, and so high, that the
ground could not serue them, but (for want of Chopins) haue stalk'
vpon Stages.
Horace hal'd his Poetasters to the Barre, the Poetasters vn∣truss'd
Horace: how worthily eyther, or how wrongfully, (World)
leaue it to the Iurie: Horace (questionles) made himselfe beleeue,
that his Burgonian wit might desperately challenge all commers,
and that none durst take vp the foyles against him: It's likely, if he
had not so beliu'd, he had not bin so deceiu'd, for hee was answer'd
at his  weapon: And if before Apollo himselfe (who is Coro∣nator
Poetarum) an Inquisition should be taken touching this la∣entable
 murdering of Innocent Poetry: all mount Helicon


I could heere ( with the feather of my pen) wipe off other ri∣diculous
imputations: but my best way to answer them, is to laugh
at them: onely thus much I protest (and sweare by the diuinest part
of true Poesie) that (howsoeuer the limmes of my naked lines may bee
and I know haue haue bin, tortur'd on the racke) they are free from
conspiring the least disgrace to any man, but onely to our new Ho∣race;
neyther should this ghost of Tucca, haue walkt vp and downe
Poules Church-yard, but that hee was raiz'd vp (in print) by newe
Exorcismes. World, if thy Hugenes will beleiue this: doe, if not,
I care not: for I dedicate my booke not to thy Greatnes, but to the
Greatnes of thy scorne: Defying which, let that mad Dog De∣traction

bite till his teeth bee worne to the stumps: Enuy feede thy
Snkes so fat with poysoill they burst: World, let all thy Adders
shoote out their Hidra-headed-forked Stinges, Ha, Ha, Nanci;
if none will take my part, (as I desire none) yet I thanke thee (thou true
Venusian Horace) for these good wordes thou giu'st me: Populus
me sibylat at mihi plaudo. World farewell.

Malim Conuiuis quàm placuise Cocis.
