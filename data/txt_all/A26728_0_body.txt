May it please your Majesty,
IF my boldness in this humble Address be of∣fensive, it is not the first time your Goodness hath been abused: and I hope that which occasions the fault, will pardon it. Your Majesties Titles of Defender of the Faith, and Nursing Father of

the Church, are so just by personal Merit, as well as Royal Descent, as may make it a fault on the other side equal to this presumption, if I should not prostrate at your Majesties feet these Memorials of this Reverend and Learned Bishop for your Gra∣cious Protection. I am sure it would be so (if I may have your Majesties leave for it) not to embrace so hap∣py an opportunity as this affords me, to acquaint the world with your Ma∣jesties transcendent Goodness, not on∣ly to this late-languishing Church in general (which the world sees, and admires) but even to the mean∣est person related to it, whom your Majesty hath been pleased first to preserve, and then promote in it. It was such an unparallell'd act of Good∣ness as may possibly fall as far short

of future beliefe, as it exceeds all for∣mer precedents, that a Soveraign Prince should be willing to redeem the life of his meanest Subject with the exchange of one that had endea∣voured to deprive him of his own: and it were a great breach of Cha∣rity to all your Majesties Subjects not to let them see by this one Instance, how great a measure of happiness they may assure themselves of, by living in loyal and dutiful obedience to so gracious a King; which duty none has so great an obligation to teach, as he that was to reap the benefit of that unparallell'd favour, and had hardly lived till this day to give this testimo∣ny to it, if your Majesties Bounty in sustaining him in prison (when your enemies had robbed you even of Bread for your own mouth) had not

been equal to your Goodness in the other particular. The world has so long admired these and your other Transcendent virtues exercised to∣ward your Subjects in general, as now to be at leisure to look upon particular Instances; whereof there cannot be (the meaness of the object consider∣ed) any more remarkable then these: which as they have a long time laid a peculiar obligation upon me as your Majesties Creature and Beadsman, so they do and will perpetuate it, over and above the Duty of Loyalty and Service which is common to others with him who is
