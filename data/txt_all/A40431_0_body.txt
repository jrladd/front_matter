SIR,
WHEN I was prevail'd with to preach this Sermon, I had no Intentions to make it any farther publick. It is wholly in compliance with the Request, His Lordship, Your Self, and those Emi∣nent Persons, the Knights and Gentlemen of the Grand Inquest, were pleas'd in so publick a man∣ner to honour me with, that it comes abroad.
 I confess, could I have thought it in any degree worthy of Your Acceptance, I should have been ve∣ry glad of the opportunity to pay the Respects and Acknowledgments that are due to Your Self, and so many Worthy Persons, who (indeed with the whole County of Northampton) have come be∣hind none in their Expressions and Testimonies of a sincere Affection and Zeal to Their Majesties and Their Government.
Many and wonderful have been the Delive∣rances God in mercy has vouchsafed this Church and Nation; amongst which, this last, consider'd in all the Circumstances of it, may justly be rankt with the chiefest of them: No man can doubt, who considers how furiously the Jesuits drove, and how wholly our late Unhappy Prince, subje∣cted himself to their Will and Councils, but that before now we had been reduc'd to the miserable Condition of the poor persecuted Protestants of France, either to be butcher'd at home, or to beg our Bread abroad, had not God been pleas'd by a wonderful Providence to deliver us out of their hands: A Deliverance so great, that we seem to want nothing but a Spirit of Love and Unity among our selves, of Gratitude to God the blessed Author, and to the King the glori∣ous
 Instrument of it, to make us an happy Peo∣ple. Whoever reads the History of the Children of Israel's Deliverance out of the Land of Ae∣gypt, will find himself hard put to it to deter∣mine, which was the greater wonder, their Delive∣rance, or their Ingratitude under it: Who could have imagin'd, that they who had had so large an Ex∣perience of the Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness of God in working Ten Miracles for their sakes, should have been so ready on every little disap∣pointment, to fly in the face of God, and his Servant Moses, and even to quarrel with their Deliverance? And yet this they did; Would God we had dyed in the Land of Aegypt: Let us make us a Captain, and return into Aegypt: As if their Moses was worse than a Pharaoh; as if the Darkness and Bondage, and Cruel Hardships of Aegypt, were by much to be preferr'd before the Liberties of their Persons, the free enjoyment of their Religion, before the Pre∣sence and Glory of God amongst them: These things were written for Admonitions to those that should come hereafter; and St. Jude makes this Application of them; I will put you in remem∣brance, though ye once knew this, That the Lord having sav'd the People out of the
 Land of Aegypt, afterwards destroyd them that believ'd not.
What I have now to add, are, Sir, my hearty Prayers to God, to multiply upon You, Your good La∣dy, and two most Virtuous Daughters, together with that Noble Family, whereinto you have so happily dispos'd one of them, all the Blessings both of this, and the future State: And that you may live long, as you have hitherto done, a sincere Lover of your Country, a Friend to the Church, an Example of Virtue and Regular Devotion, and a Pattern of unfeigned Love and Loyalty to Their Majesties, In whose Lives and Reign, all that is dear to us in this World, our Religion, our Lives, our Laws, and as to what appears to us, the whole Interest of the Protestant Religion, is in a great measure wrapt up. May God preserve Their Majesties, and bless all that wish well to our Sion. This is the hearty Prayer of all good Englishmen and Protestants. I am ever,
SIR,
