May it please Your Royal Highness,
I Here present to You a Prince, whose Memory, as well by reason of his No∣ble Qualifications, as of the Honour he had to be Allied to
You by the strict Tyes of Blood (being the Only Brother to Your Royal Spouse) cannot but be very sacred to You. If there be any thing in Sympathy, it is certain, that a Soul so Great and Noble as His, would dis∣dain to court the Patronage of any other Person, than Your Royal Highness, whose Emi∣nent Station, You are plac'd in by Providence in this Realm, Entitles You in a most peculiar manner to it. It is this, that has enboldned me to lay the fol∣lowing Treatise at Your High∣nesses feet; which without this Plea, I should look upon as an impardonable Presumption.
And upon this Occasion, I know, I should enter upon the Theme of Your Royal Vertues; but as the Illustrious Rank You bear in these Kingdoms has rendred them so Conspicuous to the eyes of All the World, as to be beyond the due Praises of a private Hand, so I will rather deviate from the common Road of our Modern Dedicators, than fall under the Censure of have∣ing undertaken a Task, I ac∣knowledge my self unable to perform. I will only say thus much in my own behalf, that, as by the exact Harmony that is betwixt both Your Royal Highnesses, You set a Pattern
of Conjugal Love to the Whole Kingdom; so Your Goodness, which is so diffusive to all, and has gain'd to You the Hearts of many Thousands, could not but be so prevailing with me, as to implore Your Protection, which if You will be pleased to afford me, under the shelter of a Prince, whose Life and Reign is the Chief Subject of the ensuing Treatise, You will at once, give an ample Testi∣mony to the World, of the High Value You put upon his Memory, and raise the Au∣thor's Ambition to the highest pitch of Ambition, he ever could pretend to, in affording a
Generous Acceptance to his Endeavours, which without that, he looks upon, as altoge∣ther disproportionable to the Greatness of the Subject he Treats of. I will end with this hearty Wish, that That Conjugal Harmony, which ties both Your Royal Highnesses Hearts with an indissoluble Knot, may be Everlasting; and as by Your Moderation and Goodness You are become the Darling of these Nations, so may the happy Effects of it, redound to Your Both sides Satisfaction, to the Happiness of Your Royal Off-spring, and the Welfare of these Nations.
This is the most fervent Wish and Desire of him, who begs Leave once more to subscribe himself
