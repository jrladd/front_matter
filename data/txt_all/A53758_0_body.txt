Rex si me Argligenis vatibus inseres,
Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.
Hor. Car. lib. 1. od. 1

Great KING if you'l be pleas'd to grace
Me in your heart with a near place
The world to come shall see


My head shall reach Heav'ns lofty Sphere,
And as the stars I will shine there,
Such shall my Glory be.
