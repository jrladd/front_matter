My most honoured Lord,
SEeing it is a Maxime of divine and humane Law, most infallibly true, Suum cuiq. reddere, I hold my selfe obliged in Obedience to it, to dedicate unto your honourable Patronage the ensuing Tract, most truly and humbly acknowledging Tam me, quam omne meum, to be your Lordships Creature, made fortunate by the Rayes of those sweet Influences which have issued from your Lorships ever Candide Aspect, which Bounty (my inability wanting means of any Requitall or other Retribution) doth claime this my poore Infant-worke, together with all other Services, both as a duty of Tribute unto your Lord∣ships high Merit, and as a signall or testimoniall Badge of that ever bounden Gratitude and Recogniti∣on which my Heart and Tongue rendreth unto your Lordships goodnesse.

But my Mo∣dicum (lesser than a meere shadow to that perfect substance) implores both your honourable regard to the Author and worke, and also Fronte serena to entertaine this humble duty of him, whose perpetu∣all suit unto the Supremest is, for all successefull blessings on the Person and state of your honourable Lordship, and noble Posterity both in stocke and branches, as well for health and life, to be happily lengthned here, as for Eternity, to be enjoyed here∣after; & for some manifestation of his Cordiall mea∣ning (the soule of verball expressions) he really wi∣shes for such Imployment as may testifie him to bee
