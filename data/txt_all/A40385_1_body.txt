GENTLEMEN,
I Was somewhat unwilling my Angler
should pass the Press, till sedulously
examined by some of your Ingenious
Society; and the rather, because it's emi∣nently
known, that many amongst you
are experienced Proficients, in the Mysti∣cal
Art and Intrigues of Angling: whose
Approbation will indisputably accommo∣date
my Design, provided it come time
enough, before my Angler encounter the
Press. However if it come short, I shall sa∣tisfy
my self (as if already confirmed) that
you'l please to embarque in these my soli∣tary
Examinations of those Rivers and
Rivulets in England and Scotland, where
the Fields in Winter are paved with
Frost; yet are the Meadows in Summer∣time
beautified with Greens, and deck'd
and adorn'd with redolent Sweets, that
perfume the Air, whose delightful Fords
are furnished with Trout; and to advance
Recreation, the generous Race of Salmon:
an entertainment perhaps not every where
understood, nor is it by every Angler (I

perswade my self) throughly examined.
But, Gentlemen, I have brought you
somewhat else; which for ought I know
may prove a friendly Diversion, if you
please to inspect this Narrative and Sur∣vey
of Scotland, where perhaps you'l
meet with such Entertainment, as may
not only benefit, but in some measure de∣light
you, after your Exercise of fishing
for Trout. What then if you step from
the Water-side, and contemplate Nature;
so raising your Scenes, you'l admire the
Creator, in his rare and admirable Crea∣tional
Work; there you may see the Ope∣ration
of Elements and stellate Influences;
there also you may see the curious and va∣rious
Amalgamations of Earth into Crista∣line
Forms, and Opacous Bodies; and
there you may see how the Luminaries
are adapted Parents of polite Stones, Me∣tals
and Minerals: How Vegetables also
protrude and bud up, because impregna∣ted
with prolifick Vegetation; and how
the Principles naturally operate in Ani∣mals,
inspired and animated by the Soul
of the World.
We have also considered some Moral
Duties, in reference to Men of sober Con∣versation:
Nor are we altogether barren
of Solitudes, and Divine Contemplation.

The Stars we consider as fiery Objects, and
he that made them thus gloriously to shine,
made them also to influence and impreg∣nate
the Universe: for God through Wis∣dom
hung up aloft these bright, shining
and globical Bodies, whereby to illumi∣nate
this stupendous Creation; and that
by reason of their Rapidity and circular
Rotation, they impregnate the Earth with
prolifick Virtue: and as we see the Stars
surround the Earth, the Orbs beyond dis∣pute
immure the Stars; but the Heavens
encircling both the Orbs and Elements,
plainly demonstrate that from the Di∣vinest,
every created Individual has both
Ends and Means naturally and specifi∣cally
appropriated to it self, whereby to
make it visible; and Visibility terminates
in Time. Which Notion to explain in a
philosophical Sense, seems to imply, that
both Matter and Form results in their own
proper and natural beginning. Know
therefore that Corruption is the Child of
Putrefaction, and Putrefaction is the Prison
and Sepulchre of Death; Death therefore
precedes the Resurrection, and the Resur∣rection
is the Clavis that opens Eternity.
But, Gentlemen, pray excuse me if I
wander too far from the Water-side, to
gaze and admire these glorious Metaphors,

the Divine Oracles of him that made them,
so not only lose my Opportunity of
Angling, but endanger to lose my self
in these solitary Meanders; rarely fre∣quented
and trod by the Vulgar. Give
me leave therefore to retrieve my self, and
introduct you into the slender Margin
of this my uncultivated Book; and exa∣mine
the Volume, if provided any thing
may be found there worthy your ingeni∣ous
Entertainment, or the general accep∣tation
of so splendid a Society, that gives
Laws and Rules to all the Anglers in Eng∣land;
that accommodates every County
with Rods for Diversion, and inriches
every River with Hooks and Lines, that
circumspectly prescribes Critical Hours
for Recreation, and consults both the
Mean and Elevation of Angling, where∣by
to augment and quicken the Spur of
Pleasure. But I'm sorry I can raise my
Scenes no higher, to elevate this admira∣ble
Piscatorian Science, beyond the Elizium
of the Angler's Arcadia. For had I that
preeminence of Pen and Fancy, to illu∣strate
what the Art of it self deservedly
requires, I should impoverish England,
nay it may be all Europe, if not all the
World, to select Expressions, to express
and decipher it's deserved Encomium.

But finding my self unable to accomplish
this great Undertaking, I'll silently sit
down satisfied, under the Rhapsodies of
Contemplation; inviting my Associates
so to do, when encountring the Rocks and
Rivers for Recreation.
Now, Gentlemen, since Magnetism is
so little known among Artists, I less
blame the indigency of those that know
not how Nature by innare Quality attracts
her own Likeness, than other inconside∣rate
Rationals, that sport away their time
in pursuit of their Lusts. Let the Ang∣ler
therefore (if he please) select Con∣templation,
and pity such others that are
destitute of those heavenly Advantages,
till the Strokes of Grace and a pious Ex∣ample
or Education, compel them to
write Memorandums of the glorious Cre∣ation,
in the fair and legible Copy-Book
of Wisdom; so imitate Nature in her
daily Progress, till ariving at the Super-excellency
of practical Christianity, which
truly to know, is Wisdom in the Ab∣stract,
that transmutes our Nature into
Grace, and our Humanity into Divinity.
But this you'l alledg is heavenly Trans∣mutation;
and so it is beyond the Medi∣ums
and Discovery of Art, or the Indi∣cation
of Nature (improper therefore to

introduce Undergraduats): It's true, it is
so; but what then? can't they omit the
thoughts of Elements, to mingle some∣times
their Contemplations with things
more sublime? Can't they relinquish their
Exercise, to converse with heavenly Ob∣jects?
This I advise to, and my Book will
instruct them.
Now I have given you a Plat-form for
Contemplation, which opens the Windows
of the Mind to inspectulate (if possible)
invisible Objects; but not to darken your
sight by gazing too much at the Sun; for
the more amiable and illustrious any thing
is, the more astonishing is that thing, and
ought therefore to be the more admired,
consequently desired, before the Methods
of Industry, or the lineal Progress of Art.
But in as much as Angling is a great part
of our Business, let me admonish the more
Ingenious Artist to be mindful of Experi∣ence,
lest peradventure he slide into the
slippery Tract of an Author, so unman him∣self
of practical Demonstration. Against
which Hypothesis I exhort the Angler,
whilst capable to trace the silver Sands, or
florid Meadows of Thames and Trent, to
consort with Ingenuity amongst Rocks and
Meanders, where probably he may meet
with his Friend,
