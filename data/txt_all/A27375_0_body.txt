Madam,
DIvers PROTE∣STANTS ha∣ving sought after Victory through Flight, their Retreat cannot fail of such Adventures as are
surprizing, and that have very much of the Roman∣tick Air. Those poor peo∣ple have been assaulted in so many manners, that they are become ingenious in Intreagues, and in find∣ing out unknown Ways, to deceive the subtlety and vigilance of their Persecu∣tors, which might have forc'd them to serve that which is not God, in its own Nature. This Re∣viv'd Fugitive's a∣version
to a strange Wor∣ship was very great, those attempts which she has made to prevent her ha∣ving any share in it, have been as great. She has overcome her self to master those Obstacles, which were oppos'd to her Liberty, and that Providence which usu∣ally gives its blessing to those Cares which we take not to be separated from the true Religion, has govern'd all the steps which she
has made to avoid so sad a separation, and has snatch'd her more than once out of the jaws of Death, that she might at last secure a Good, which by the Gospel is termed the Good Part, and the sole necessary thing. I address to you, Madam, the Relation of it; with all the respect due to your Merits and Elevation. Di∣vers Reasons ought to make me fear that I may
be blam'd for taking the liberty to offer you so small a thing, and I ought to have fear'd to expose my self in so great a Light. But I take Heart, Ma∣dam, and I despair not, but that you will look on this small Piece with a favourable Eye, and that you will have so much boun∣ty as to descend to this Reviv'd Fugitive, all neglected as she is. I have cause to believe so,
when I represent to my self how great the Love is, and how strong the application, which you have for our Religion; what will not be your joy to see her Triumph in her Person over those terrible Temptations, which Love, and Interest, and the Examples and So∣licitations of a Brother have assail'd her with: That in her Adventures there has been such extra∣ordinary Circumstances,
that are not wholly un∣worthy of your Highnesses Curiosity, and that being of a Province, which the Heavens has honour'd with so Illustrious a Birth, as that of your Highness; she does hope that you will not disapprove her Ambition, to treat you with a Dish of your own Countrey fare; she even flatters her self with the thoughts that you will concern your self in your Country Womans evil
and good fortunes, and that you will be pleas'd to unwea∣ry your self some moments, in the consideration of those dreadful dangers, with which her Life has been threatned, and of the won∣derful manner by which she has been free'd from them. May the Heavens, Madam, cover yours with its powerful Pro∣tection, and continue plen∣tifully to showre on your Highness its Blessings,
and on your Noble Fa∣mily. These are the Vows which are made with all the Zeal imaginable, by
