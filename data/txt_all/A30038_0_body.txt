My Lord,
SINCE by Divine Providence, after my many Years Conversation with the Quakers, I heard the first Sermon by a Publick Minister in your Church, whereby my Understanding was in great part cleared from those cloudy Mists which fell from the confused Notions and uncertain Doctrines of the Quakers; I think my self bound in Duty to return Publick Thanks to God for that his Pro∣vidence and Token of his Especial Favour; as also to his Servants, who labour in the Word and Doctrine, and for the same (however despised by the Ignorant) are worthy of Double Honour. And having been concerned in Conscience to unveil the Teachers of the Quakers, who bring in Damnable Heresies, even denying the
 Lord that bought them; I presumed to present your Lordship with the ensuing Discourse, who, as you know how to re∣buke with all Authority such as wilfully maintain Errors, so you also know how to bear with, and forbear, such as through Infirmity may unwillingly err. I there∣fore do most humbly offer what I have wrote to your Lordships Perusal, and shall most willingly submit to your Censure the Matters therein contained: And if, for want of Judgment in the Matters contro∣verted, I have wronged the Quakers, I shall most willingly Retract, and make them publick Reparation; believing on the other hand, that if they be found guilty of the Errors charg'd, that your Lordship will think it requisite, that they, under their Hands, make an ingenuous Retractation, according to their Pretences in their printed Works. I am,
My Lord,
