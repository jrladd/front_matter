My Lord,
THE Reason why I have not dedicated any of my particu∣lar Books to your Lordship, is, that when I have writ all I mean to print, I intend, if I live, to Dedicate the whole summe of my Works unto you, and not by Par∣cells: for indeed you are my Wits Pa∣tron; not that I lay the Defects, that may be found, to your charge, for upon my Conscience all the Faults are mine own; but if there be any Wit, or any thing wor∣thy of Commendations, they are the Crumms I gathered from your Discourse, which hath fed my Fancy; and though I do not write the same way you write, yet it is like Nature which works upon E∣ternal matter, mixing, cutting, and car∣ving it out into several Forms and Figures; for had not Nature Matter to work upon, She would become Useless; so that Eter∣nal Matter makes Nature work, but Na∣ture makes not Eternal Matter. Thus she

is but as a labouring servant; and as in E∣ternal Matter there lives Spirit and Motion, which is Life and Knowledge, so in your Discourse lives Sense and Reason, in your Wit, Delight and Pleasure; in your Mind, Honor and Honesty; in your Acti∣ons, Valour and Prudence; in your Prospe∣rity, Generosity and Humility; in your Mis∣fortunes, Patience and Magnanimity; in your Friendship, Truth and Constancy; to your King and Country, Fidelity and Loi∣alty; to your Neighbours, Affability and Kindness; to your Enemies, Pardon and Pitty.
But, My Lord, I must do as the Painter did, which was to draw Agamemnon in that posture, as he stood to view his Daughter offerr'd as a Sacrifice; who when he came to Pencil out his Countenance wherein Sorrow sate so lively, he was forced to draw a Veil over his Face, his Grief being too great for his Art to imitate: So I, when I come to describe your worth by my Pen I find your Merit so far beyond all expres∣sion, that I am forced to leave off Writing, only subscribing my self, as I am,
