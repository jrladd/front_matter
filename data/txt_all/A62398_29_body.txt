Most worthy Sir, Sedition and a Common-wealth was intimated by two Lobsters, fighting one with another, the Land-Lobster is a great enemy to the Serpents and Snakes, therefore the Egyptian Priests did put it to signisie a temperat man, who suppresseth his Lusts and wicked Affections, that are the most dangerous Serpents unto his soul.

THis Pamphlet I send to your view,
Is to let your Worship ken,
It's known to be the first Issue
Of my dull idle Brain,
It's known as yet, I could ne're write,
My reading is but small,
For refuge, I flee to your hands,
In hopes you'l warrand all;
Shepherds I thought were three times eight,
Appear'd into my Dream,
Wherefore one to you I dedicat,

A civil honest Man,
He in Analshope doth dwell,
His Mame's Michael Andison;
That Shepherd Swain will no man wrong,
In Religion he is strong,
The foulest Feinds assume the fairest Forms,
The fairest Fields doth feed the foulest Toad,
The Sea at Calmest most subject is to Storms,
In choicest Fruit the Canker makes abode;
So in the Shop of all believing trust,
Lyes Toads invenom'd treason couched fast,
Till like a Storm his toothless thoughts out-burst,
Who Canker-like had lyen in trusts repose;
For as the fire within the flint's confin'd,
In deepest Ocean still unquencht remains,
Even so the false, through truest seeming mind,
Despight of truth the Treason still retains,
Yet maugure Treason, Trust deserveth trust,
And Trust survives when Treason dies accurst,
Since Michael Andison hath great store of Wool'n-fleece,
I wish they more abound than Iasons did in Greece.
