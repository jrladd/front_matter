TO You whom the Peolpe have chosen for the managing of their affaires, I present this necessary Treatise without boldnesse and with∣out feare: for I am well assured, that as it is mine, and every mans duty, to to furnish You with what we conceive will advance the Common good, or bring ease or comfort to any sort of men that deserve well of their Countrey (as You cannot but know the Seperation doe, if You consider with what charge
 and hazard, with what willingnes and activity they have furthered the Reformation so happily begun) so like∣wise it is, Your duty, to heare and put in execution, whatsoever to Your judg∣ments shall appeare conducing to those good ends and purposes. I recommend here to Your vew the oppressed Consci∣ence, and the despised Separation: They have been much wounded (I be∣leive every body can say by whom) and the people have passed by without com∣passion or regard, though they them∣selves must necessarily partake in their sufferings There are none left, to play the good Samaritanes part but Your selves, who as You have power; will, (I make no question) be willing too, when You have once well considered the matter, which this small Treatise will put You in mind to doe. It is not to be supposed, that You (who have so long spent Your time in recovering
 the Common Liberties of England, should in Conclusion turne the Com∣mon into Particular; let the insinu∣ations and suggestions of some in the Synod, be what they will, I make no question, but You will see both through and beyond them; and will never be swayed from a good conscience to main∣taine particular mens Interests.
In the beginning of Your Session, when our Divines (as they would have us call them) wrote freely against the Bishops, & the Bishops made com∣plaint to You for redresse; some of You made answer, that there was no reme∣dy, forasmuch as the Presse was to be open and free for all in time of Par∣liament: I shall make bold as a Com∣mon of England to lay claime to that priviledge, being assured that I write nothing scandalous, or dangerous to the State, (which is justly and vpon good grounds prohibited by Your Or∣dinance
 to that effect) only I humbly desire You to consider whether more was not got from You by that Ordi∣nance then You intended, and that though it was purposed by You to re∣strain the venting and dispersing of the Kings writings and his Agents, yet it hath by reason of the qualifications of the Licensers wrought a wrong way, and stopt the mouthes of good men, who must either not write at all, or no more then is sutable to the judgments and interests of the Licencers. The Sepe∣ration (I guesse) would have tooke it for beter dealing, if the Divines had in expresse tearmes obtained of You an Ordinance for suppression of all Anabaptisticall, Brownisticall, or Independant writings; ent have their mouthes stopt subtlely, so insensibly, and their just Liberty in time of Par∣liament taken from them vnawares. There can be no greater Argument, that
 the Divines intend not well, than their taking uncough, and mysterious, sub∣tile wayes to effect their ends; even such as far better become Polititians, then Ministers.
It is high time O Commons of England, to put an End to the suffe∣rings of the Seperation, who have for many yeares been the object of all kind of tyranny, Papisticall, Prelaticall, and Regall: The first Foundation of honor, and respect was certainly from publike service and protection of the distressed: Make it Your worke, and assure Your selves, You will find not only the uni∣versall love of all good men accompa∣ning You, but a quiet and cheerfull Conscience, which is above all honour and riches, Others may weary them∣selves in plots and contrivances to ad∣vance selfe-ends and interests, to the peoples dammage and molestations; sadnesse and distraction will be their
 companions for it. But make it Your businesse, Ye chosen men of England according to the trust repsed in You to protect, he Innocent, to judg their cause impartially, to circunmvent men in their wicked endeavours; and so You will become the beloved of God, the beloved of good men.
