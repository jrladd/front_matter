SIR,
I Have presumed to present this Translation to your Lordships view, and send it into the world under your Patro∣nage. And though my selfe bee not worthy so great a Patron, yet the Author Count Virgilio Maluezzi his Workes generally are of such esteem, that a Noble and honoura∣ble Penne in this Kingdome hath vouchsafed to English some part of
them. And this particular Historie is so inter-woven with severall grave politick Discourses, learned and pi∣thy Speeches upon sundry occasi∣ons, that I question not but your Lordship may find somewhat in it worthy your reading at vacant houres. This, and your ever knowne love to learning, shewed by your dai∣ly favours continually flowing upon Scholars, hath encouraged mee to prefix your honoured Name to these my endeavours: in which though I come farre short of Maluezzi's in∣comparable stile, or the honourable Translators facunditie, I shall most humbly beseech your honour to cast a gracious aspect upon it, which may encourage mee to attempt higher things, if so great a one shall deigne to accept of this so small present. So praying God ever to blesse you, & all your honorable family, I humbly rest,
