Right Honourable,
VVHen I first engaged in this service, I did it with some reluctancy, not out of any un∣willingness to the thing it self, but the consciousness of mine own unfitness for
it. And when I receiv'd the commands of your Court for the Publication, I found in my self a greater reluctancy; not that I knew any thing in the Sermon that fear'd the light, but because I had sel∣dom seen printing of Sermons attain the desired effect, being generally thrown aside, and the most useful and innocent discourses oftner entertain'd with spite∣ful and disingenuous reflections, than im∣proved to the real purposes of Religion. But in this I over-rul'd my self, lest I should seem to contemn Authority, while I am professedly pleading for obedience to it. If any thing herein may minister to pub∣lic use, confirm men the more in the Pro∣testant Religion, and awaken an honest and prudent care against those, whose principles and practices, as well as their interests, naturally tend to destroy our Re∣ligion, and to disturb our quiet (especi∣ally
that of this great and honourable Ci∣ty, so intolerable an eyesore to them) if it may attain these ends, 'tis the utmost that can be hoped for from the mean endeavours of
Right Honourable,
