MY LORD,
SEveral Passages in this following Sermon, having been maliciously misrepresented by Men who hate the Government, and love Lying, divers Friends have advis'd and importun'd me to make the whole Discourse Publick.
Not that any Hopes are conceived, that it will work much upon those whom Interest or Ma∣lice engageth to be Obstinate, and whom Obsti∣nacy encourageth to be clamorous; especially if there be upon their Consciences any Guilt of that Murther, which on so Solemn an Occasion, we cannot reflect upon, without the greatest Hor∣ror, Astonishment and Indignation. Of such, little Good is to be expected, who have sinned away a great Stock of Grace; which is so com∣monly the miserable case of Inveterate Rebels, that to the Observation of the World they very seldom repent.
But, God be blessed, the Generality of Men among us, mean well, and are so honest in their Intentions, that they cannot easily be rifled of a good Conscience, but by some Cheat, and for want of due Information; because the shedding of the King's Blood was a Crime of that Horrid Nature, and the Subversion of the Establish'd Government, was a Mischief of such ill Effect, that every Sober Man, whose Eyes are open, cannot but tremble, at the Memory of the One, and for the future dread the very Thoughts of the Other (though some few Spirits may be so far possess'd with the Devil, as that they could again be glad and rejoyce at Both.)
Now the Design of this Discourse is, to serve the Sincere and Simple-minded part of the World, by affording a short View of the Sin acted in 48, and of the Methods and Degrees by which the King and the Government were destroyed together; and of the Miseries in Church and State, which by the just Judgment of God this Nation smarted under, that we might be made sensible of our foolish Exchange, and be Disciplin'd into Wisdom for the future. But alas! since we have been healed of our Stripes, some seem to have almost forgotten the Rod, and are not only Willing, but Desirous to come under the Lash again. So unfixt and mutable are

many English Spirits, that the only Center they can rest in, is the Grave: For as the Moon, af∣ter so many Periods, returns into the same Pha∣sis; so some Erratick Humors, after so many Years, revert into the same Motion; and the only Way to save men the Charge of being cured again of their Lunacy, is to prevent the Disease: And for this Reason I did Discourse upon this Theme, because it is presumable, that though there be in the World some Fickle, some Factious, and many Atheistical Spirits, that could be con∣tent to try another Fall for the Government, yet all men that are truly Conscientious and Wise, will beware of encouraging Attempts of that Nature; especially considering what a sad Boo∣ty this Nation did get by its former Wrestlings.
And now, my Lord, I hope your Grace will not wonder, if I present this Sermon to your Lordship as a Patron, though you was not an Auditor. My Great Obligations to your self, and to your Honourable Relations for your sake, do challenge Higher Testimonies of Gratitude than my Skill can Express, or your Modesty will Bear. Yet were there nothing to be considered but that Natural Love and Duty which I owe your Grace, I do most Thankfully Acknowledge, that Your have a Just Right to all the Services which are Possible to be done either by Me or

Mine; because we are All your Lordships Ser∣vants by Birth. So far am I from owning that Principle, That every man is born Free, that I confess my Self, and all that bear my Name, to have Inherited such a State of Servitude to your Lordship, as if (according to the Mosaical Custom) your Noble Ancestors had bored the Ears not of our Progenitors alone, but of their whole Issue. For your Grace knows (and I can∣not without Ingratitude conceal it from the World) that as we have been (of every Gene∣ration One of us at least) Clergy-men, from Father to Son, ever since the Reformation; so we have had the Honour to have been all along Successively Chaplains to your Noble Family: Such a singular respect to the Church, and (God be blessed) to an Honest race of Church-men, as hardly any Nobleman in the Kingdom, but your Self, can Own.
But, my Lord, I am a Debtor not to your Per∣son only, but to your Spotless Virtues, that which makes you Truly Honourable, and, I had almost said, the Rarity of our Age. It is a Common Happiness, that what was Great and Good in your Noble Ancestors, You are the Apparent Heir of; and those Surviving Virtues in You, which were so Eminent in that Excellent Person your Noble Brother, (against whose Memory I should

Sin, should I rob him of that Just Character, that for his Years he was one of the Flowers of the World) do something abate the Sense of that (otherwise Irreparable) loss, which the whole Kingdom sustained by his Ʋnfortunate and Ʋndeserved End. His Piety, Humility, Chasti∣ty, Sobriety, Sweetness of Nature, and (which I could not but observe in Him) His utter Ha∣tred of all Prophane and Irreverent use of God's Holy Name; they were Vertues which do rarely meet in a Gentleman of Twenty years Old: But this is all your Friends Comfort, that while I count up some of your Brothers Vertues, I men∣tion Yours too; and that Your Lordships Name may be ever Dear to all Good Men, I must beg the wonted Freedom You give me, to beseech You with the most Passionate Affection to be to your dying day Carefull of your Vertue, being confident of this, that as it is now your singular Honour, so it will certainly be your Best In∣terest.
One thing I must put your Grace in mind of, that your Noble Predecessors have been Emi∣nent, among other Vertues, for their Fidelity to the Crown, and their Zeal for the Prosperity of our Establisht Church. And this I know to be your Lordships hearty Resolution, and a consi∣derable part of your Lordships Honour. Ʋpon

which account also I crave leave to offer these few Sheets to your Grace; humbly begging your kind Acceptance, and beseeching God to Bless you with all the Blessings of his Right hand, and of his Left; which is the constant Prayer of,
My Lord,
