IF the skill in handling of it had any way answered the excellency and utili∣ty of the subject handled in the fol∣lowing Sermons, there would have needed no Apology for the publication of them. The Parable under consideration comprizeth (in most lively and heart-affecting allusions) many pretious truths. Here are divers My∣steries of Providence cleared, pointing to those secret wayes wherein God carries his Decree of Election under ground a great while, before it rise and break out in effectual Calling: here we learn how far a chosen one may run from God before he turns: here we are instructed in the methods God useth to bring wanderers home, and recover the most profligate Sinners by Repentance: the nature of true Repentance is here curiously limned, and the transactions between God and a Sin∣ner in his Conversion pathetically described:
 yea, how miserable a thing it is to be a Sin∣ner, how happy to be a Saint is wonderfully illustrated. The fountain of Grace is here opened, and the deep streams in which it runs revealed: and all this accommodated to the most feeling apprehensions of the soul. I con∣fess I have but drawn a veil upon the picture, and am deeply sensible of my own insuffici∣ency to Display these Mysteries: all the ac∣count which I can give of the publishing this imperfect thing, is, knowing it the desire and duty of those that fear God, as they have op∣portunity, to do all the good they may in their places; & God having so far afforded his Pre∣sence and Blessing with these Sermons in the Preaching, that many Souls have born wit∣ness to the benefit received by them, some of whom have desired they might have the fur∣ther advantage of their being made publick; I was therefore induced for this reason to consent to it; hoping withal (if God sees meet) that it may be further beneficial to some or other, to shew them to themselves, and instruct them in the way of life: to give light also to, and help some to prove them∣selves and their own state: only let it be (for
 caution) adverted, that I have not here undertaken to confine the Spirit of God in his wayes and methods with his Elect, in bringing them home; but only have signified that something of all that is herein expressed is one way or other done in the Soul that is savingly brought over to Christ. The work of Conversion begins to be thought a small thing; and a matter of little observation or wonderment for a Sinner to become a Saint: Many Commence Believers before they were either convinced or humbled; and that is the reason why so many prove Apostates: The great design of the Parable, and aim of this Discourse upon it, is that proud and se∣cure Sinners may be awakened and humbled, and brought off from their empty and undo∣ing courses; and that abased and self-loa∣thing Sinners may be encouraged, notwith∣standing all their profuse and prodigal wayes, to return to God in Christ for his mercy, and so may tast of the Royal Feast, and be enter∣tained at that noble Table, which God hath prepared for them who come home from their far Countrey, by true Repentance. My en∣couragement is, that out of the mouth of
 Babes and Sucklings God hath orda praise; to his blessing I commend this  and may his Name have the Glory, and  Souls be made so to partake in benefit  as to give him his due acknowledgme shall have reached the utmost of my aim.
