Reverend Sirs
I Do seriously account it a part of my infelicity to see the di∣stractions and divisions among us touching the Worship of Almighty God, and his holy Child Jesus, whom I trust we do all love and fear, and therefore it is the greater pitty that we who differ not about the Godhead, should at all differ a∣bout the things which pertain to his blessed Service. May it therefore please God to move upon all our hearts to consider (laying aside all carnal interest) where the causes on either side are given. And sith, perhaps we are more quick sighted about each others mistakes then our own, give me leave with∣out offence, to shew briefly what I conceive is really amiss on your part, and I shall as willingly consider what may fair∣ly be objected concerning us against that confideration.
First then, when I look upon your reformation from Papall errors, I cannot but heartily congratulate the piety and zeal of your Martyrs, &c. Specially in their being instrumen∣tal to bring that sacred institute of the Lords Table from under manifold corruptions wherewith it had been incum∣bred in the darkness of Popery: But yet withall I must needs condole their shortness in not looking with like diligence to the Pristine Institution of sacred Baptism, by which over∣sight we which survive them, are the more exposed to our present distractions, and I think I may say in this, as David in another case, because they did it not at the first therefore the Lord made a breach upon us.

Secondly, when I consider the articles of the Church of England, I think it very strange that we who agree so firmly in them all save three or four, and differ but in some points touching them neither, should not consider of some expedi∣ent to remove what obstructs our intire agreement.
May it therefore please your Bishops, with their Brethren, to admit of a friendly conference with our Bishops and Past∣ors, to try if by any means away may be found to bring us to brotherly concord, for whatsoever hath happened in the heat of disputation, or fallen from the Pens of passionate Writers on eitherside, yet be pleased to know, we are no haters of the pious Protestant, but sincere lovers of them and the truths by them maintain'd, as indeed we ought to be of all who love Christ, though differing from us in many things. And though it is true we hold a separation from you in our Congregations, yet we do this of necessity, because none among your Leaders will treat with us about the re∣moval of those things which do offend.
I confess, to reform what is amiss on your part touching sacred Baptism is a difficult undertaking, yet not more diffi∣cult then it was to reform what was amiss in the other Sacra∣ment, whether we consider their errors, who for some hun∣dreds of years, gave it to Infants, or theirs who by their transubstantiation changed the very nature of the Sacrament▪
But if no endeavouts of this kind must be admitted, then am I out of hopes ever to see Christian concord among us, for those coercive ways (which some incline to) will but ag∣gravate the breach (which is too great already) & render your cause the more suspitious, and consequently more confirm us in our perswasion against your way. Now the Lord himself di∣rect us all to the way of truth and peace in all things;
So prays; yours to love and serve you in Christ as far as permitted.
