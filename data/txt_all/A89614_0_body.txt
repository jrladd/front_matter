Right Reverend Father in God,
IT was once the complaint of the Sons of the Prophets, that the place wherein they dwelt was too streight for them. The Prophets of the Church of England have for divers years, like a kind of , had room enough to wander about in, though little e∣nough to dwel in. Yet I beleive they never miss'd their houses so much as they did their Pulpits on the 28th.  June. This made me take the
Presse for my Pulpit, and (by a very easie con∣version) my Readers for my Auditors: for my Lord, if we should hold our peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
I present this Sermon to your Lordship, not for any confidence I have of the worth of it (for I know my own size well enough) but to account with your Lordship for the duty I owe you, as your Curate of Soules. I have this then to adde to the greatning of your joy in the day of Re∣compences, that as I have, by the grace of God, through all the intrigues of the late Julian dayes, faithfully kept your depositum down to these very times of the Restitution of all things, so was it the good pleasure of God to pitch upon that little flock, for such Sacrifices as were ready to be offered up for the testimony of a good conscience.
My Lord, the insolence of this address, will hereafter receive an alloy, even in your Lord∣ships own judgement, when you shall be inform'd of your Lordships more individuall concern∣ments upon this Author, who is,
My Lord,
