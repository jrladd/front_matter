SIR,
I Make bold to Dedicate to you a Book, whose Worth has fix'd on its learned Author the Cha∣racter of the greatest Genius that France ever produc'd: Superstition, Tyranny and all the numerous Train

of Vices and Extravagancies being ridicul'd in it with as much Wit as Judgment; a Lover of Britain, envy∣ing to France such a Treasure, has made it a Prize; and now it sets out with English Colours, fearless of its Enemies, under your powerful Pa∣tronage.
Pardon, Sir, the Necessity of this Address: It was not easie to find a Name worthy to be prefix'd to such a Work, which disobliging the blame∣able Inclinations of almost all Man∣kind, had left me but little Room for the Choice of a Patron. I knew none in whom I could be safer than in you, who, by the consent even of Envy, are not only granted to be free from those Defects, which render the generality of the World obnoxious to Satyr; but would have turn'd our satyrical Author into a Panegy∣rist; had he lived now, and, like us, seen every Vertue and heroic Accom∣plishment happily centred in your Person.
These Qualifications endearing you to Mankind made me eagerly embrace this Opportunity, to express in a public Manner my share of the Joy which fills every honest Breast in this Nation; pleas'd, to see you resume the mighty Task, which you have discharg'd so much to its Glory and your own. Not to partake of the Sence of Gratitude, which they would all express, for what you have so bravely perform'd and still under∣take for its Prosperity, would be to resemble those who do not think themselves oblig'd to the Sun, because he dispenses his Light and Heat to all; as, on the other side, to pretend to impart to you a greater Lustre, would be like striving to add Bright∣ness to that glorious Planet, that on∣ly withdraws a while to shine the more, and obscure the Train of Stars that supplied its Absence.
I can hardly hope, that this Book will deserve your Attention at this

Juncture, when the most weighty Affairs in the World wholly employ your Thoughts: Yet, Sir, if your Care for the Welfare of your Country will admit no breathing Intervals, at least, when on your watry Charge you seek an Enemy, who has too deeply felt the Effects of your Va∣lour, not to dread it as much as we love and admire it; this ingenious Satyr may then not be unfit to lessen a while your Impatience in those tedious Moments. Thus when the Heroes of Argos embark'd in search of a Conquest, which the distance of the Prize only delay'd, they had their Orpheus to soften the Tedious∣ness and Toyls of the Expedition.
May your next be no less Success∣ful than theirs and your last; and secure to these Kingdoms Peace and Plenty, that golden Fleece, which we, as well as the Heroes, who are Proud to follow while you lead, may now reasonably expect. Ad∣vance, Sir, to new Triumphs that wait for you: The Enemy who is

to be Conquer'd, is but the same whom you have already Vanquish'd, and seems to have had time to Re∣cruit the mighty Losses, which by your Valour and Conduct he su∣stain'd, only that he might be the more Worthy of giving those Ver∣tues an Opportunity to exert them∣selves in a more glorious Manner.
They are so Conspicuous in you, Sir, as well as that Zeal for your Country's Happiness, the hereditary Attribute of your Noble Family, that it would be an impardonable Vanity in me to pretend to make them more known to this Age, by any thing of the Nature of this Address; and it will be the proper Task of Hi∣story to transmit them not only to the next, but to the latest Posterity. I will not therefore, Sir, tire you with Praises far below those which you so highly deserve and shun: And, since the Best and Ablest Patri∣ots have, by public Acknowledgments of your great Merits, as it were, made themselves your Panegyrists, what

can be left for a Person of my pri∣vate Circumstances to do, but at a Distance to Admire you, and be Ambitious of no greater Name than that of,
SIR,
