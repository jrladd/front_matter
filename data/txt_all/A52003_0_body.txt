My Lord,
THe World will per∣ceive how hasty I am to throw my self at your Lordships feet by this poor Dedication: for rather than bring no Offering, I have fetcht a small Present from

France to pass through England to arrive at the happiness of your Lordships Patronage. I confess my Author inscrib'd it, To the Wits; and I do so too in sending it to Your Lordship; whose large Soul is so brimful of knowledge, that the measure is admired when compared with Your years. But our thoughts are answerd as soon as we remember that immortal Hero, Your glorious Father; whose Spirit was so emminent for Speculation and Practice, that his Camp was an Aca∣demy, admirably replenished with Discourses of the best

and deepest Sciences; whose several Parts were strongly held up, (under Him the Head) by those knowing Noble Souls, the Earls of Kinoul and Airly, the Lords Gourdon, Ogilvy, Naper, and Maderty, and the two famous Spottswoods, (Sir Robert, and his Nephew) whose learned heads were too precious to be cut off by them who knew not how to under∣stand them. This I am bold to mention, because such Noble Discourses banisht from his Quarters all obscene and scur∣rilous language, with all those offensive satyrical Reflections,

(which now are the only cur∣rent Wit among us) and if any such peep'd forth in his pre∣sence, his severe looks told the speaker it was unwelcome. Nor did this proceed from a narrow∣nesse in his heart, being (to all who knew him) one of the most Munificent, as well as Magni∣ficent Personages, in the world: which too well appear'd, when Cities after Victories tender'd large sums to be freed from the present incumbrance of his Army; He satisfied their de∣sires, but refused their Moneys, still saying, that he could not at once have their Hearts and their

Purses; his work was to vindi∣cate his Masters rights, and re∣store them to their wonted happi∣nesse. Nay, his unexpressibly malicious Enemies found that his Mercy transcended their Malice, when those brave Per∣sons (after Quarter given) were butcher'd at St. Andrew's, he refusd to retaliate on the Pri∣soners in his power, saying, their Barbarity was to Him no example; and if the meanest Cor∣poral in his Army should give Quarter to their General, it should be strictly and religiously observd. And after all, when command∣ed to lay down Arms, (though

he then saw it destructive to his Master) he in meer Passive obe∣dience submitted, as soon as he obtained Indemnity for them who ingaged with him without paying one farthing Composition, nobly suffering himself to be banished, which (be it recorded to all Posterity) was put in ex∣ecution at the Haven of Mon∣trose, the Third day of Septem∣ber, a day which twice since hath been registred in bloud, at Dunbar, and at Worcester.
[All this might seem Flatte∣ry to your Lordship, (from me who had the honour of em∣ployment under his Command,

both at home and abroad) if it were not known to the world for Truth; since the Soul of the Great MONTROSE lives eminently in His SON: which began early to shew its vigour, when your Lordship (then not full twelve years old) After the battell of Kilseioh. was close Prisoner in Edinbo∣rough-Castle, from whence you nobly refus'd to be exchanged, lest you cost your great Father the benefit of a Prisoner, where∣in He gladly met Your Reso∣lution, Both so conspiring to this glorious Action, that nei∣ther out-did the other, though all the world besides.

[May both Your Names still live to fill Chronicles, where∣of we dare not doubt, since your hopeful alliance by your in∣comparable Lady to the illu∣strious Family of the renowned DOUGLASSES; for whose Honour here, and Feli∣city hereafter, may Your Lord∣ship accept the Duty, and God hear the Prayers of
My Lord,
Your Lordships most
obedient and most
devoted humble
Servant,
