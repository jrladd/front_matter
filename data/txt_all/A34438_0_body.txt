THrice noble Sir, pardon this bold addresse,
In that my soaring Muse pitch'd on no lesse
A Patronage, than your Renouned Name.
Imboldned hereto was I, 'cause your Fame
Recorded is amongst those Hero's; who
The Royall Cause maintain'd against a Foe
Under pretences specious that Rebell'd.
VVhen (yet a Boy) your Colours I beheld
And Regiment so gallant by you rais'd
Even by my Infant-Muse your worth was prais'd,

An Actor on this Bloody Scene you were,
And an eye-witnesse of most Fields fought here
That blood you lost your valour may declare;
Your judgement this, that no pretence (though fair)
Your intellect could blind; your Faithfulness
In that you fought, till that of Souldiers lesse,
Under your tattered Colours did appear,
Then Cinquefoils in your honours Colours were.
Wounds you receiv'd, and much of blood did lose,
VVhilst on the field, your life you did expose
To do your Soveraign service. Sure that blood
Expended in a cause Royally good
Your Honour is; your wounds then chains of gold,
Are Ornaments more glorious to behold.
Your sufferings since the VVarres who hath not known?
You paid both for your Souldiers, and your own
Loyalty, nor would your brave mind submit
To composition, till much mov'd to it,
By your most vertuous Lady's prayers and tears,
Your name the last in that black Roll appears.
(Except the martyr'd Slingby's) none there are,
Of all your Honour'd House engag'd in VVarre
Against your King: these things induc'd my Muse,
You (as the fittest person) Sir to chuse,
To patronize these her first rude Essayes.
Let not oblivion cancel the due praise
(It's the Debenters we are like to have)
Of all those Sons of Mars, and Souldiers brave.

That for their Soveraign fought and suffer'd too,
In this they live, whilst this doth live by you.
