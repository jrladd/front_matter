May it please your Excellency,
THough I know it a high Presumption in me to affix so great a Name to these Papers, yet I likewise very well know how hainous and apparent a Premunire I should incurr against all Equity and Justice, and in more par∣ticular manner against my bounden Duty to your Lordship, to Entitle any other to their Protection, or to set up any Foreign Power to be Supream and Paramount to that of your Excellency's over them: You my Lord be∣ing at this time seated in the great and honourable Stati∣on
 of Governour General under his most Sacred Majesty, of that Place which the subject Matter of these Papers par∣ticularly relate to.
My Lord, Those many Gracious and Regal Grants and Priviledges which his most Excellent Majesty and Royal An∣cestors (of ever blessed Memory) have from time to time be∣stowed upon this his Majesties Colony of Virginia, since the first Settlement of the English there, have given being to these Laws for the better Government thereof; it being impossible for any number of Men to be at Peace or to flourish and prosper without good Laws, which are the firm Pillars of Government, and the strong Bonds of all Humane Society. One had as good live in a Desart amongst Savage Beasts, as among Men without Law to defend him; for Laws are the Hedges on either side the Road, which hinders from breaking into other Mens Propriety.
Laws are every Mans Civil Armour, that Guards him from the Gripes of Rapine and all other Outragious Assaults and Insolencies, and indeed 'tis for this chiefly that Laws are of use amongst us, not only to be our Guide, but also our Shield.
The Great and Universal Monarch of the World, the Supream Being, at first, in the very Infancy of Time gave unto Man a Law upon Parole, inscribed in his heart, that by those inward Dictates he might be guided and bound∣ed in the whole Course and Road of his Life; but such has the Pravity of Humane Nature been, that this Divine Inscription is in a great measure defaced; so that Kings and Princes have found it of absolute necessity to give Lite∣ral and Prescripted Laws for the Government and Well-being of Mankind in their respective Places and So∣cieties.

These Papers being a Collection of the Laws of this Place, presume not to Instruct your Excellency, who in the fair Volume of your great Mind have all the Laws of E∣quity and Justice engraven, and the vast Universal Idea of whatever can be call'd good in Mankind is there stamp'd. But my Lord, these Papers which contain Laws, and there∣fore ought to preserve others from Calumny and Censures, yet cannot themselves; humbly crave your Excellencies Patronage, which proves a Sanctuary to all Goodness, so well as your Power is a Terror to all Vice.
The Design of this Collection of Laws is the Good of the Inhabitants of this Place, for Laws though Enacted, stand in little stead and use till they are promulgated and made known to all persons concerned in the Obedience of them: Not my Lord that I accuse all the Inhabitants here with ig∣norance of their Duty, but, may it please your Excellency, The knowledg of all things that are good, the more diffu∣sive the better, and I hope my Lord, that my honest and good intent herein will lessen and expiate in some measure my presumption in this Dedication to your Ex∣cellency.
Your Illustrious Fore-fathers have been always famous for their constant and exemplary Loyalty to their Prince, and some of them have received the Signal Marks of Roy∣al Bounty. Your Excellency has eminently and deserved∣ly partaken of both, for his most Sacred Majesty (whom God grant long to Reign) seeing you treading in the same Steps of Loyalty with your Vertuous and Noble Ancestors, hath in his Princely Wisdom been pleased to entrust your Lordship with the Weighty and Honoura∣ble Employment of Lieutenant and Governour General of VIRGINIA.

How happy is his Majesty in so Wise and Faithful a Subject and Minister! And how happy is your Excellency in serving a King whose Wisdom cannot only discern and justly value, but whose Goodness and Power can also Re∣compence the Merits of a Subject never so great!
But my Lord, I dare not extend my self upon your Excellencies Panegyrick, which is an infinite Subject, and requires the Pen of the most Skilful Orator: I shall therefore content my self to admire with other Men what I cannot comprehend, lest I should offend and be injurious to your Excellency by my little and weak Expressions, which are far below my thoughts, and my thoughts far below your great and high Merits; which necessa∣rily forces all Men (whose happiness 'tis to know your Lordship) to aspire, and I more than all others, to take the liberty to write and stile my self
My most Honoured Lord,
