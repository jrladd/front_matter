GOod Sir, (as your sometimes Scholler, & your now substitute) giue me leaue, to shew some part of my dutifull thankful∣nesse, for your many louing fauours re∣ceiued; your kinde instructions, your free helping hand to the beginning of my encouragement, by your louing Certificate (to the right Honourable the Lord Carew Mr. of his Maiesties Ordinance) of my sufficiency to performe the place and Office of a Gunner, for his Maiesties seruice: I therefore haue presumed to demonstrate a part of my duty herein, the rather for the louing respect you haue euer shewed vnto me, and to all others vnder your Commaund, that endeuour to become seruiceable for our King, and Countrey, by the diligent pra∣ctise in the excellent Art of great Artillery: It being my chance of late Sir, to turne ouer Mr. Digges his Bookes, intituled Stratiaticos, and Pantometria, to light vpon certaine dificill Definition, obscure The∣orems, and some subtill questions, concerning the

vse of great Ordinance, which as Mr. Diggs there saith, though he long since publikely propounded them, that none hath yet vndertaken to answer any one of them: wherefore in his last edition with short Marginall notes, yes and no, himselfe hath darkly resolued some of them, as hereafter in the Margent appeareth, whereof I haue vndertaken to make a more plaine Exposition of them & the rest, aswell for mine own, as for others furtherance. And wheras he hath there coated certaine published Er∣rors in this Science, I haue thought fit to ioyne them together, with some other Errors that I haue also e∣spied in other Authors writing of this Art: All which I haue presumed to publish vnder your iudi∣tious Patronage, hoping that my willing pains shal neither incurre disgrace, nor displease, but rather that these my first Fruits wil be accepted with such loue as I truly offer them, whereby I shall be encouraged (with your good leaue) hereafter to proceed further with my Treatise of the Art of Artillery, wherein I perswade my selfe, that the most necessary particu∣lars belonging to the Gunners Art, are more acute∣ly shewed, then in any other Treatise in any Lan∣guage yet extant: And so I shall endeuour to deserue the continuance of your loue and fauour, and will rest at his Lordships, and your Worships command, both whom, I pray God euer to blesse.
