THat princely Prophet whose celestiall Vaine,
In sweetest Measures, & soule-charming Layes,
To his deare Harpe so fealingly bewrayes
Mans perfect Way to Pleasure and to Paine:
Bequeath'd the Skill of his Skie-fostered Braine,
(Whilst he himselfe crownd with immortall Rayes,
Of endlesse Glory rests, not fading Bayes)
Here Phoenix like to be renewd againe.
And as from that Arabian Birds sweet Ashe
One still proceedes of like admired Wing:
The sacred Furie of best Israels King
To Britanes Monarch doth so fully passe,
By which inflam'd He sings, that Heauens Decree,
None worthy DAVIDS Muse, & Harpe but He.
