MAy it please you right Honorable, in some of those few vacant hours which it pleaseth the most high (whose rod and staff you are) to afford unto you, from those ma∣ny, weighty, difficult, and distractfull incombrances, and affairs, that do flow in, and press upon you daily, to cast your eye (at least for recreation sake) upon this Trea∣tise, and the rather, because it contains in it matter of no small concern∣ment, as in it self, so especially to your honoured selves; for in the first part, which is the narrative, you may please to read a tragicall story, wherein I hope your eye will not a litle affect your tender hearts, to see such a discurteous entertainment of strangers, and wayfaring-men that were passing by, and tarried but for a night or two, and that by their neighbours, men professing the fear of the Lord as they also do; who to∣gether for liberty of their consciences, and worship of their God, as their hearts were perswaded, long since fled from the persecuting hands of the Lordly Bishops, your adversaries and ours, unto those utmost parts of the World, to the extreme hazard of their lives, the wasting of their e∣states, and upon the point, to the totall loss and deprivation of their neer and deer relations, and the comforts thereof in this their native land; and the rather to see this acted by that sword, that hand, which from your

honored arm they are betrusted with, and so to see your sword, your pow∣er, your hand misused therein. In the second part, which is the confirmati∣on of my testimony by the word of God, and testimony of Christ Jesus the Lord, and especially in the later part thereof: you that count it your greatest honour, and highest preferment in this world to be servants of Christ (who is indeed the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, whose Sword-bearers you are, as was also that Caesar although he knew it not) you (I say I hope) shall find that he hath not required such things at your hands, as generally they that have been his Sword-bearers before your selves have been apt to conceive; and thereupon have been too deep∣ly engaged in the shedding of much innocent bloud in this Land; being also perswaded thereunto by their teachers, who to maintain their super∣stitious, humane, invented religion and worship, for filthy lucres sake, it being the only curious art, and craft by which they had their wealth and livings as those of old; not having the two-edged sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, to defend themselves, and to maintain their craft, against the poor illiterate and despised servants and witnesses of Jesus Christ, have been forced to call for the sword of stell, the power of the Magistrate, to help to stop their mouthes, to cut them off, and so to take them out of their way, and by casting a mist before their Ru∣lers eyes they have still perswaded them, That this is their office, and duty to do, and that hereby they did God best service with that sword with which they were betrusted, whereas indeed they did but make their sword guilty of the blood of the innocent; and thus were they taken off from attending upon the very thing for which this sword was put into their hands, to attend upon their private, and carnall interests, and so were brought into a double transgression. By whose errataes, Right Honourable, I hope the Lord will teach you to beware, and by giving you a clear discerning of his mind, and will in these more bright sunne-shining daies (wherein the Earth begins to be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the Sea) will give you to understand that as all power in earth is given to him, so he to the glory of God his Father, whose power, and wisdome he is, doth wisely manage the same by a two fold administration of power suita∣ble to the two fold state or being of man, whom in the earth, and in the things thereof he hath appointed Lord; that one may be called an earthly, and outward administration, which suits the outward man, and all those outward, and visible things (in reference unto man)

that do belong thereto, as he is Lord thereof, and is managed by an outward visible sword of steel, and by a carnall or audible voyce, or word of him, or them that holds it in their hand, and to an out∣ward and carnal end, (yet righteous, just, and good, which being diligently attended to tends to the peace, liberty, and prosperity of a civil State, Nation and Kingdom so far as it concerns the outward man and visible state thereof;) which end is the preservation of it self, the whole, and every particular part, and person, belonging thereun∣to, safe in their person, name, and estate from him, or them that would rise up visibly to oppress, or wrong them in the same; Thus in the general; and to instance more particularly, in case by the cauti∣on of a wholesome Law, and just penalty annexed thereunto, which by a carnall hand or way, is presented to a carnall and visible eye, or ear, the Oppressour takes not warning, and will not be deterred from offering violence to the person, name, or estate of his neighbour, then by this power shall he be made responsible, and be forced no∣lens volens, so far as he is able to make it good, and to restore; in case any be impoverished, or faln to decay in their outward man, and estates by age, sickness, fire, or by some other way, or hand of GOD; so far as their present strength extends, by this power they are to be employed, and where it fails, to be relieved, and that by an equall, and just levy of their neigbours estates to be taken also by force in case there be not so much love, and charity in them to∣wards their poor distressed neighbours to constrain them thereunto, and by the same way also to maintain itself, and all other just undertakings that may be presented for the preservation of the whole. And this in brief is the sum of that administration of Christs power in earth so far as it meerly concerns the outward man with respect to others that may up∣hold it, or molest it, and is managed by that sword of steel which in reference unto him is called in scripture the rod of iron by which he rules the nations, and breaks them to peeces like a Potters vessel; and with this administration of his power on Earth (Right Honourable) hath he (who is the Lord of Lords and shall ere long appear as King and Judge of all) betrusted you in these three Nations, having as a manifest token thereof put into your hand that iron rod, and to admira∣tion hath strengthened and upheld your arm for the subduing, and or∣dering of the same.
There is yet besides this, another administration of Christs power on Earth, which compared with this, may be truly termed heavenly and spirituall, it being that which suiteth with, and principally is exercised about the spirituall, or hidden part of man, to wit, his spirit, mind, and conscience, which is indeed the most naturall Lord and commander of the outward, it and all things belonging thereunto being but naturally subject, and readily obedient, from which very consideration it is, that it is more safe, and also more honourable, for the powers on earth to have one thousand souls to be subject to them for love and conscience sake, than to have ten thousand times ten thousand bodies seemingly subject, for wrath sake, and for fear of revenge; this spirit and great commander in man, is such a sparkling beam, from the Father of lights, and spirits, that it cannot be lorded over, commanded, or forced, either by men, de∣vils, or angels, but onely leaving its first station, wherein it came so neer to the light and glory of God, it is now caused to possess death and dark∣ness, and by that means is in a capacity by men and devils to be decei∣ved, and so by perswasion to be mis-led. This spirituall administration of Christs power in and over the spirits and consciences of men, as it ex∣tends to all the inward and hidden motions and actings of the mind, so to all the outward manifestations of its powerfull commands in the out∣ward man, in reference unto God, and especially unto such as appertain to the visible worship and service of God, who hath declared himself to be a Spirit, and will be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and seeks such, and onely such to worship him: This spirituall administration so far as it concerns the outward man, is managed not by a sword of Steel (which cannot come neer or touch the spirit or mind of man) but by the sword that proceeds out of the mouth of his servants, the word of truth, and especially as to the efficacy, and to the inward man, by the two∣edged sword of the Spirit, that spirituall law and light with which these candles of the Lord are enlightned, and that by himself, who is that light that enlightneth every man that comes into the world; and this spiritu∣all administration of Christs power on earth in and over the spirits, minds, and consciences of the sons of men, and also over the outward man as to worship meerly, is committed into the hands of the Spirit of Christ, who is his vice-roy here on earth, and is only able to deal with spirits by way of convincing, converting, transforming, and as it were a-new creating of them, and so to translate them out of the Kingdome of dark∣ness, in which they are by nature, into the glorious iberty of the Saints in light. Who is pleased also to make use of the mouths of his servants, and through them, as empty reeds, and crooked rams-hornes, to over∣turn

the spirits, and spirituall strong holds of men and devils, and by them to convict, avenge, and execute the sentence written, which upon such as manifest the emnity that is in their minds in the highest degree even against the holy Spirit himself (the only sin unpardonable (for all other sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven) I say the written sentence that is to be executed upon such) is anathema maranatha, that is, accursed with this intimation, our Lord cometh, leaving them untill he meet with them; and otherwise than thus the servants of Christ cannot proceed, having ex∣press command not to strive, but to be patient, apt to teach, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves, & to wait if God at anytime wil give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth: Thus if it please the Father of lights to give you (Right Honorable) to distinguish between these two administrations of Christ's power here on earth, and to leave that part to himself in the hand of his Spirit, which cannot be conferred on others, nor yet rightly managed but by the two-edged sword of that Spirit, and wholly give up your selves to improve that part which belongs unto, and well suits with that sword which you are now be∣trusted with, it will much conduce to his glory, your own praise, and the peace and settlement of these three Nations, over which the Lord hath set you.
And whereas Right Honorable, it is in your hearts, to propagate the Gospell of Jesus Christ; the thing is excellent that is in your hearts, and I hope the way to effect it is before you, which is, sith the Lord of hoasts hath said, that works of this nature are carried on, not by might, nor by power, but by his Spirit, therefore to give way to his Spirit for the ef∣fecting thereof: and to this end I humbly propose, that your way to fur∣ther this glorious design, as to the might and power this Lord of Hoasts hath betrusted you with, is
1. Not so much as to touch his Anointed, and to do his Prophets no harm, their ointment being the Spirit of prophecy, and this Spirit of prophecy the testimony and witness of the Gospel of Jesus. And
2. As obedient and dutifull servants to that Lord of Lords, to suf∣fer the Tares (which being by the adversary sown after the Wheat, must needs be ment, erronious, hereticall, and antichristian persons professing the Gospel, I say to let these tares) alone in that part of the field, or world, over which the great Lord of the harvest hath placed your Ho∣nors; sith it is his pleasure they shall there remain to the time of the har∣vest, being the end of the world, and that out of his tender respect to the Wheat, lest in plucking up the tares (though evidently discerned by his servants) the Wheat should be rooted up also. And
3. To the same end not to give your sword, or power to the beast nor yet to suffer your power, neither in these three nations, nor yet in any forreign part of the world to be so misused by any to whom 'tis com∣mitted, as by vertue thereof out of an ignorant zeal, and blind devoti∣on, pretending to pluck up the tares (which yet is contrary to the express mind of the Lord) to root up the wheat also.
4. To countenance and incourage (as through Gods mercifull hand on your hearts in some measure you do) such as are faithful, and up∣right in the land, by this means shall a wide and effectual door be open∣ed, and so shall the word of the Lord, which is the Gospel of Christ go forth, run, and be glorifyed through all those parts of the world that ac∣knowledge your power, and that which is of God shall stand, encrease and be propagated, and that which is not of God shall fall, decay, and come to nothing. Thus shall you also accomplish the words of the Pro∣phets of old, in becoming nursing fathers unto the servants, and children of God, who under you shall lead a peaceable, and quiet life in all god∣liness, and honesty, and shall be greatly obliged to improve their inter∣est in the father of mercies by their presenting to him constant and earnest petitions, supplications, intercessions, and giving of thanks on your be∣half. And for the furtherance of those worthy thoughts of your hearts, they shall not cease to preach, and declare to great, and small what they have seen, and felt, and heard touching the Gospel of Christ, and to pray the lord of the harvest to send forth faithful and painful labourers into his harvest; which is also the constant, hearty, and earnest request of
