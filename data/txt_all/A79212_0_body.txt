RIght Trusty and Right Well-Beloved Cosins, and Right Tru∣sty and Well-Beloved Cosins, and Trusty and Right Well-Be∣loved,
We Greet you Well: We can∣not have a better reason to promise Our Self an end of Our Common Suffer∣ings and Calamities, and that Our Own Just Power and Authority will with Gods Bles∣sing be Restored to Us, then that We hear You are again acknowledged to have that Authority and Jurisdiction, which hath al∣waies belonged to You, by Your Birth, and the Fundamental Laws of the Land: And VVe have thought it very fit and safe for Us, to call to you for your help in the composing the confounding Distempers and Distracti∣ons of the Kingdom, in which your Sufferings are next to those VVe have undergone Our Self; And therefore you cannot but be the most proper Counsellors for removing those Mischiefs, and for preventing the like for the future: How great a Trust We repose in you for the Procuring and Establishing a Blessed Peace and Security for the Kingdome; will appear to You by Our Enclosed Declara∣tion; which Trust, VVe are most confi∣dent You will discharge with that Justice
and VVisdome, that becomes You, and must alwayes be expected from You; and that upon your Experience, how one Violation Succeeds another, when the known Rela∣tions, and Rules of Justice, are once trans∣gressed, you will be as jealous for the Rights of the Crown, and for the Honour of your King, as for your Selves: And then you cannot but discharge your Trust with good Success, and provide for, and Establish the Peace, Happiness, and Ho∣nour of King, Lords, and Commons, up∣on that Foundation which can only sup∣port it, and VVe shall be all happy in each other: And as the whole Kingdome will bless God for you all, so VVe shall hold Our Self obliged in an especial man∣ner to thank you in particular, according to the Affection you shall express towards Us: VVe need the less enlarge to you up∣on this Subject, because VVe have likewise writ to the House of Commons, which VVe suppose they will Communicate to you: And VVe pray God to bless your joynt En∣deavours
for the good of Us all; and so VVe bid you very heartily farewel. Given at our Court at Breda, this  Day of April, 1660. In the Twelfth Year of our Reign.
