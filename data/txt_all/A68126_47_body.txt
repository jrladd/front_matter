Right Honourable:
YOu shall not need to impute it to any other reason besides your vertues, that I haue presumed to shroud this peece of my Labours vnder your Noble Patronage. The world hath taken iust notice how much the Gospell is graced by your reall profession; whom neither honour hath made ouerlie, nor wealth lauish, nor charge miserable, nor great∣nesse; licentious. Goe on happily in these safe and gainfull steps of goodnesse; and still honour the God that hath honoured you; Jn the meane time, accept from my vnworthy hands these poore Me∣ditations, more hie for their subiect, then meane for their author; Wherein Shimeies curses shall teach you how vnable either great∣nesse, or innocence is to beare off the blowes of ill tongues; and how baseness euer molds it selfe according to the aduantage of times. Achitophels depth compared with his end shall shew how witlesse and insensate craft is, when it striues against honesty; and how iustly are they forsaken of their reason, that haue abandoned
 God; The blood of Absalom and Sheba proclaime the ineuitable reuenge of rebellion, which neither in woods nor wals can find safety. The late famine of Jsrael for the forgotten violence offe∣red to the Gibeonites, shewes what note God takes of our oathes, and what sure vengeance of their violation. Dauids muster secon∣ded with the plague of Israel teache how highly God may bee of∣fended with sinnes of the least appearance, how seuere to his owne, how mercifull in that seuerity. If these my thoughts shall be appro∣ued beneficiall to any soule, I am rich. I shall vow my prayers to their successe; and to the happinesse of your honourable Family, both in the root and branches; Whereto J am in all
