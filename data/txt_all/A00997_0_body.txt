MY LORD,
THE Histories of
Lucius Florus,
cōprehending in
foure short Books
the one hundred, fortie and
two of that principall Histo∣rian
of the Romans, Titus
Liuius of Padua, and of ma∣nie

other, written, hard to
say, whether more conceit∣fully
or completely, are here
translated out of their Latin
into English. A labour grea∣ter
farre (as all our learned
know) then for the slender
bulke of the volume. His
Maiesties great example,
and your Lordships feruent
imitation, to increase in the
ful sail of fortune, the balasse
of worthy readings, is here
in part well fitted. For your
Honour cannot possibly find
in so little a room so much, so
well together, of this weigh∣tie
argument. A thing to
your Lordship acceptable,
considering your small lei∣sure,
and to all those other
who haue already profitably

runne through his authors:
himselfe so briefe as it is al∣most
his fault; so neate, and
pithy, as Liuie fares the
worse for it, so desirous to re∣member
what himselfe hath
said, and to haue it vnder∣stood
by others, as he summs
his owne summarie narrati∣ons;
and finally, so worthy, as
seeing the glorie of a great
Historian forestall'd by Li∣uie,
and others, hee held it
more honorable to be (as hee
is) the first among briefe
writers, then one among few
in the large ones. Epito∣me's
notwithstanding are no
other in truth but Anato∣mies,
and all spacious minds,
waited vpon with the felici∣ties
of meanes, and leisure,

will flie them as bane, but this
briefe hath all the requisites
of a perfect body, and appar∣rell
as rich as any; for profes∣sing
Storie, he hath certain∣ly
performed a Panegyrick.
His scope, to kindle the va∣lor
of the old Roman world
in the bosome of the new:
though himselfe, an heathen
man, and liuing vnder Tra∣ian
the emperour, saw the
proportion of valour well-maintained:
that being the
most goodly, and most flouri∣shing
estate, which at any
time vnder heathen princes,
that monarchie enioyed.
Those annotations, and col∣lections,
whose lights will
lead your Lordship into the
wise, and heroik secret of the

most potent, graue, and ho∣nourable,
masters which euer
mankind had, are fittest for
your more leisure. To your
good Lordship therefore, in
whose person the ancient
splendors of the noble fami∣lies
of VILLERS, & BEAV∣MONT
are vnited with ad∣uantage,
doth Luci{us} Florus
offer himselfe in our vulgar
tongue, and brings with him
the plaine, but withall, the
free, and grounded good-will
of his most louing, and care∣full
interpreter, humbly
Your Lordships,
