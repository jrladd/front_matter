RIght wise and curteous gen∣tlewoman, I could not de∣uise to dedicate this Trea∣tise (of the necessary, fitte, and conuenient education of yong Gentlewomen) to one to whome it is more conuenient and necessary, then to your selfe; neither yet present you with any thing that more then this might be agreeable vnto you. For besides this, that in you onely hath consi∣sted the cause that mooued me thereunto, my Present bringeth with it no lesse manifest and notable witnesses of diuers rare and eminent vertues that are imprinted within your vertu∣ous mind, then loue & reuerence, which more earnestly I beare vnto the lord Siluester Ca∣taneo your good father, to whom I haue writ∣ten. And although by so good beginnings hi∣therto apparant & knowen to be in you, we cō∣ceiue a certē & most assured hope, that of your self you wil in short time become as vertuous as we desire: notwithstāding, as the fairest plants
by the continuall labour and expert hand of th husbandman, procure fruites much more delicate and sweete than otherwise they would, so by adding that care and dili∣gence which is meete and conuenient, vnto the vertuous minde and noblenesse of na∣ture, alreadie ingrafted in your heart; wee may expect and persuade our selues, that the fruites of your vertues will soone be ripened, and become of a most sweete and pleasaunt taste: which peraduenture, not beeing la∣boured, would neuer prooue so exquisite. You are to acknowledge the receit of diuers giftes by God bestowed vpon you, which to many others are denyed: among whome, al∣though already you haue made a beginning (as we hope) you shall from henceforth be much more commendable, in that it hath pleased him to indue you with a spirit most richly re∣plenished with all his most goodly and singu∣lar graces, and of Nature (commonly more spating and couetous in departing her rich giftes among vs, then wee could wish) you haue receiued equally both grace and beau∣tie (which in your ancestours was much commended, and which wee hope will be
in you a good beginning of a vertuous and honourable life.) Lastly, fortune hath giuen you Nobilitie, which beeing accompanied with those most goodly vertues that are al∣readie seene too openly in you, will in your riper yeeres (as presently in this newe and springing youth you are seene and knowne among the most excellent maidens of this Citie) make you a singular example to the renoumed and Noble Ladies of this our time, touching all the good qualities that of wo∣men may bee required. And in truth you are most happie, as beeing one to whome it hath pleased God to bee so liberall of his grace, which you shall much more shewe vnto the worlde, if you be alwayes as carefull and di∣ligent to preserue them, as God hath shew∣ed himselfe liberall in imparting them vnto you. And if such as haue gathered and hea∣ped togither great quantities of treasures, keeping them with great watchfulnesse, are neuer so well assured thereof, that they con∣tinue
wholly freed from such care, with how much more studie and diligence ought wee to procure the conseruation of those goods, in the attaining whereof, lyeth and consisteth humane felicitie, and in their losse, all infelicitie and miserie? To that end onely tendeth the good instructions, counsailes, and precepts of those that teach you. and all that which at this present I write, which although it bee lesse then is conuenient for so vertuous a Gentlewoman as you are: neuerthelesse, If you respect the mind and good desire that in me ought to surmount abilitie, the one bee∣ing most great, and the other of little value, you will accept it in good part, and lay it vp amongst those things that are most precious vnto you: In the meane time by this my la∣bour dedicating my affection vnto you (which is great, and not altogithet vnworthy to bee accepted by you) I beseech the Lorde, that guiding our desires with his fauour, hee will supply that which wee coulde not perfite,
who onely can doe what pleaseth him, and will doe nothing but that onely which is for our good and eternall saluation: you to the contrary, esteeming that you can yeeld vs no greater praise or reward, (although wee haue done that for you which in time may turne both to your honour and profit) then to be∣come such a one as we haue taught you to be, you will inforce your selfe by earnest and hear∣tie prayers vnto God (who neuer refuseth to heare such as humble themselues vnto him) that hee will defend and keepe you from the enemies of humain felicitie, which in this life are infinite in number, in such manner, that the clearenes of the puritie of your mind, may in no sort bee soiled nor offended. With the graces and vertues by God bestowed vpon you, you are likewise enioyned to liue well and vertuously: and as from trees we expect and attend such fruite as by secret instigati∣on and their proper vertues wee hope they will bring foorth: so from you are expected
all the good and notable operations that ver∣tue ingendreth, and that alreadie are ingraf∣ted in your heart: The hope that is concei∣ued of you is so great, that although you grow vp and increase in vertue, prudence, tempe∣tance, and generositie, the world neuerthelesse will not therewith be satisfied in you, still pro∣mising it selfe a larger quantitie of your great worthinesse: and therefore following such as hauing a long and difficult voiage to performe, doe make the more hast, so much the more you must inforce your selfe to surpasse those that are your inferiours, as God hath graunted you greater means to attaine thereto, than he hath giuen to them: alwayes fearing, that to your great dishonour you stay not behind, and you shall from day to day aduance your selfe. Where with making an end, wishing you all true and perpetuall felicitie, I bid you farewell.
