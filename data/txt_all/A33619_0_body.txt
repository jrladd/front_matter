Noble Cousin,
AS soon as I had finished this Play of mine, (call'd The Tragedie of Ovid) I sent it to wait upon you, at your house in Berisford; where it found so courteous and generous an Entertainment, that I should ac∣cuse my self of much ingratitude, did I not Dedicate it to you, and in∣treat your Favour that it might visit the world under the secure Patro∣nage

of your authentick Name. I beseech you therefore to afford it so much grace, and to give it leave to lie in your Parlour-window, since you have been pleased to signalize it with two excellent Epigrams. This is but a small Testimony of my Thankfulness to you, for an a∣bundancie of high and obliging Fa∣vours that I have (upon several oc∣casions) received from you: To which you will infinitely adde, by continuing in your good opinion,
Sir,
