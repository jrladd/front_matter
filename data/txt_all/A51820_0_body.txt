Right Honourable:
IT is maliciously observ'd by a late pre∣tender to History, that London has a
great Belly, but no Taste: whereas its Refinement is of such Eminency, and its Judgment so accurate as well in Religious as Civil Concerns, that it must be held for no ordinary atchievement to be Master of any
Discourse that may rise up equal to its Approbation, and strike
gratefully on its palate: And I am per∣swaded, that no man who enters on
this Stage, will ever find any just occasion to fear, lest too much Learning should make him a Barbarian to his Auditory. How this
present Sermon, in the general, has been received, I ought not to acquaint the world; 'tis a sufficient recommendation, that it has been acceptable to your Lordships bet∣ter Judgment, and has made the Author unexpectedly known to your Favour: For whilst I paid my your Favour: For whilst I paid my Reverence to your Dignity, I found a Friendship from your Person. My Lord, I esteem it an extraordinary Felicity, that my first Obli∣gations are so well
plac'd, that it may be said hereafter, that I Lived under your Consulship, and that all my future Gratitude may henceforth run in one Channel. My Lord, I can scarce refrain from publishing very great things of your Honour, but that I think this is no fit Paper wherein to attempt your Cha∣racter; and besides, your Lordships real Worth would go near to spoil the best Ora∣tory: for solid Virtue, like a natural Rock, has always something massy, and bravely rough, which the best polish∣ings
of Art would but deform: Some counterfeit, or imperfect Virtues, might re∣ceive a strange Advantage from Invention and Language; such might do well in Landskip, to be viewed at a Distance; but a true Eminency is better shew'd, than describ'd.
Perhaps I am come abroad in a false Sea∣son, where the best prospect which can be taken is terminated in a sullen cloud of doubtful affairs; however, this is no discouragement in the least; for altho a large measure of Po∣litical Divination may be requisite to make a man cunning, yet a small fore∣sight will serve to make him honest: And every one may rationally presume, that he, who without any worldly Interest, loves and clings to a persecuted Church, loves it as a Church; it being easie to di∣stinguish a person of Naked Valour, and an
unbenefic'd Affection, from such, who grow resolute onely from a
Confi∣dence in their Armour; or who (like
the Tragoedian, that lamented the ruine of this Country over the dead Bones and Coffin of his Son) cast an earnest and
private eye on their dear Prefer∣ments, and then are Nationally affli∣cted. I never found my Pen more ungo∣vernable, or a greater Temptation to write on, than at present. But lest the Epistle Dedicatory (as it usually happens) should prove the strongest Prejudice against the ensuing Discourse, I shall beg leave to subscribe my self,
Right Honourable,
