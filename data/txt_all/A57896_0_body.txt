AS Apollo among the Planets, so, I may say, your Lord∣ship is among Peers: In the vast Firma∣ment of Learning you out shine them all: And under∣standing

that, among other scientificall Speculations, your Lordship hath been addicted to the study of Physick (wherein you have made such an admired pro∣gresse, that you have attain∣ed, not only the Theory, but the practise thereof) I am bold to dedicate this small piece to your Lord∣ship; wherein there are di∣vers new physicall experi∣ments, for the universall health of mankinde: There∣fore I presume no discer∣ning Reader will adjudge this addresse to be impro∣per.
Moreover, ther's another

Reason that induced me hereunto, which was, That I knew your Lordship to have been pleased to admit your self to Gray's Inne, and make it your Musaeum, or place of retirement, (which I hold to be one of the greatest honours that Socie∣ty ever received) and being a Member thereof my self, I adventured to make this Dedication; For which ne∣vertheless I crave your par∣don, and rest,
My highly honoured Lord,
