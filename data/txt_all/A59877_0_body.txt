My LORD,
IN obedience to the Order I received
from your Lordship and the Court
of Aldermen, I Present you with
this plain Sermon, the whole Design of
which is, not to debate any thing, nor to
determine on which side the Truth lies, in
those warm Disputes which have been a∣mong
us, but to convince all those, who
Love and Pray for the Peace of
Jerusalem, how many Controversies

there are, which should be laid aside with∣out
Disputing, and how a little condescen∣tion
to each other, may either happily
Vnite us into oue Communion, or at least
Teach us to Live together in Love and
Charity, notwithstanding some different
Apprehensions of Things; and I hope so
Charitable a Design as this, will raise no
new Disputes and Quarrels among us.
That GOD would preserve his Church,
restore Peace and Vnity among Christi∣stians,
bless this Great and Populous City,
and direct your Lordship in the Govern∣ment
of it, in these difficult Times, is the
hearty Prayer of,
