Dearest Sirs,
I Here Present You with a very hasty and a very imperfect Discourse, which I had neither Time nor Books about me to make better; and I can only attribute it to your kind Affection to me, that you have pressed me to the Publishing it. And, since it has the Fate to go abroad, pray God it may do some Good, and that it may be Read with as much Candor and Affection as you heard it; and then it may possibly somewhat Advance the Cause both of Learning and Religion, which it is too much the Fashion of our Age to despise. I am
Gentlemen
