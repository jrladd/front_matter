GReat and manifold have the blessings and favours of the Lord been to this our part of the Kingdome (loving Countrey-men and Neighbours) ever since the beginning of these miseries and distractions in the Kingdom. For though the first spark of this unquenched fire broke out the first of all among us; our men be∣ing (I think) the first that were called to stand Brother against Brother;At the Leaguer at Paul in Holder∣nes a∣gainst Kingston upon Hull and we the first that saw the beginning of miseries; in the first plant∣ing and using Engines of Warre, to Beleaguer; Batter, and Depopulate, our owne Cities and strong Holds: and therefore, had cause to feare our troubles would be greater then wee could avoyde; yet it pleased God on a sudden to turn our apparent feare into more joy then we could have expected, by the sudden dissolving of that
Army, gathered by our Kingdomes foes, in the pretence of the Kings defence, and releasing of that place which at that time contained the In∣struments of safety to the whole Kingdome; and this was done so suddenly, that our enemies and cruell disposed ones to Church and State, (of which we had many) had not power to per∣forme their intents in raising more forces accor∣ding to their desires; either to obtaine what they longed for, or to bring into subjection those they hated; but even in a moment had all their hopes dashed, by being called away before they expected; to the great comfort of all bea∣ring good will to Sion.
After which time, we, for a good space, only heard of warre and miseries, but were our selves free from them, or the feare of them; and so might have remained, if those, to whom the Countreys welfare was committed, and in whom trust was reposed, had as faithfully dis∣charged that which was committed to them, as with ease they might have done: but God (who disposeth of all things to his owne glory, and knowes how to extract good from evill) seeing our wayes and doings nothing answerable to his benefits and favours, made way to bring up∣on
us a sharper correction then formerly we had felt; and to this end, (because in what they did they aimed more at their own ends then his glo∣ry, and to let us see that men trusting to carnal wit or policy, cannot prosper) he gave our Go∣vernours over to themselves, to be seduced to betray the trust in them reposed, and to give our Forts, Strong-holds and Armies, and with them the Countrey, into the ands of the ene∣my, to be used and abused by them at their plea∣sure; which traiterous dealings, although they wrought not so effectually as was by some de∣sired, and by them sought for, yet did they make way for ensuing dangers; for by the deceitful∣nesse of oneScar∣brough Castle. Hold (which secured our part of the Countrey) that division which then was spred into the most parts of the Kingdome, broke in amongst us, and set one part of the Countrey against another, in great danger to destroy it all.
And by the traiterous dealing of him *, who had the chiefe command of that party from which we expected safety,Sir John Hotham our enemies prevai∣led and got the upper hands afar, as that they had the Countrey at their pleasure, and confi∣ned our Forces into a little strong Hold, which
alone was left of all their former liberty.
Kingston upon Hul which was then again BesiegedAnd here againe begun our miseries, which for a long time we had put far from us; for then were we left in the hands of mercilesse miscre∣ants, whose tyrannicall exactions at that time were so great, that our miseries were unexpres∣sable, and our woe increased to that height, that we knew not which way to take to seeke com∣fort: our condition was lamentable, for even all hope almost of expecting deliverance or safety was excluded, and the Sun of Gods favour see∣med to be set upon us, and the Lord shewed as if he would not be entreated of us.
But then againe, when we were in the low∣est ebbe of adversity, when I say we had no hope left of recovery, it pleased the Lord to rowse up himselfe as a Giant new awakened from sleep, and (even when our enemies thought they'd had all things sure, and us in their wills) to put power, courage, and magnanimity into the hearts of an handfull, which discouraged and bet to repulse an Army seeming invincible; by that meanes raising that Siege that had beene so enjurious to the whole Countrey,Raising the Siege at Hull. and not only were they at that time bet backe; but present∣ly that part of the Countrey was so freed, that
no constant Army durst abide in it.
Here begun the Lord againe to shine upon us with the comfortable rayes of his mercy, and to dispell those clouds of sorrow which so long had over-spread our Horizon; still many show∣ers of troubles rained downe upon the borders (as it were) betwixt the parties, for presently after raising the Siege, and a good space after (our Garrison Souldiers not daring, because of their weake strength, too fast to inlarge their Quarters) the enemy dared to prey upon the Countrey neer them adjoyning by plunder and taxations; making those parts, to which they did resort, to live in continuall feare. In which distresse and feare they continued, untill, by Gods assistance, our Army gained so much ground, and that with so good footing, that they wholly chased them away, and put them in such feare as that they durst not come among us; and at length through Gods good kindnesse towards us, and the care, vigilancy, and courage of that small party, (if they should be compared with the numerous Forces which at that time the enemy had) brought the worke into so good maturity, that they cleared the coast, and brought them, who formerly had with so
much audacity triumphed over them and the Countrey) into such subjection, that they were forced to betake themselves to theirScar∣brough Castle. strong Holds, being not able to abide the Field, to re∣taine and keep their former liberty: which be∣ing done, the Countrey begun to enjoy againe its former tranquillity in some good measure, and at length, through Gods especiall favour to∣wards us, and the infaligable endeavours and unmatched valour of those against it, that which so long had been an occasion of misery and mis∣chiefe to the whole Countrey, was surrendred and yeelded into the hands of our Comman∣ders, to be kept for the Countreys safety.
Since which time, praised be God, we have lived (in comparison of our neighbours round a∣bout us) in peace and tranquillity, without the least feare of danger, not being molested or troubled by unruly guests, or affrighted by hor∣rid Massachres, nor disquieted in our houses by night or day; not having our houses spoyled, our corn destroyed, our horses or cattle violent∣ly taken from us, or molested with any other miseries that goe along with War; but have all things so in peace, as if it were generally pro∣claimed in our Kingdome.
And nor onely we enjoy this favour, but now, when in many places where the Sword hath played its part, the plague of Pestilence fol∣lowes, consuming those the sword hath left; wee still in these parts are freed from any con∣tagious or infectious disease; but enjoy free∣ly our health, wealth and liberty, in a larger measure then any almost could expect in these troublesome times into which we are fallen.
All which favours we must acknowledge we receive from the Lord, of his free mercy to∣wards us, and not for any amendment of life or humiliation that is seene in any of us, more then our neighbours: for truely (I may speake it to our shame) the corrections we have had, have wrought very little humiliation in us for our formers2 Kings 13.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Our cse is like theirs, & as they did so doe we. wayes; and now since his anger hath been removed, we are turned againe to our old by as, and have betaken our selves to our beds of security, sleeping without feare in our sins, putting the evill day far from us, and rest∣ing our selves assured of peace, by thinking no other miseries can come upon us any more; quite forgetting to ascribe unto the Lord due thankfulnesse for his favours, or to render unto him the praises due unto his Name: Nay, in
stead of this, we dare God even to his face again to punish us, and even presume upon his favour, dreaming of, nor dreading any further evill that he hath to send against us.
I wish it were not thus with us, but alas, who is he, though but halfe sighted in spiritual mat∣ters, that sees not this? and yet who is there that seeks a remedy? Who would not be loath to feele the judgement of War againe upon us, and yet who goes the right way to prevent it? True it is indeed,Is. 22.8, 9, 10.11 like the Jewes, we prepare our weapons, and build up our walls, and uses all meanes that earnall policy can invent to save us, but we never looke to doe what God com∣mands; hee calls for weeping and mourning, baldnesse, and girding with sackcloath: But behold among us joy and gladnesse,12, 13 killing ox∣en, and slaying sheep, &c. Is this the way to en∣joy peace? Can we expect to have Gods favour shining upon us and doe thus? Nay, let us not deceive our selves, this iniquity shall not be purged away till we dye, if we thus hold on in our courses.
For what though no danger (to our thinking) is neere, shall we therefore conclude that wee are free from danger? as if God had no other
judgements then those we have already felt? or if he had not, he is the same God he was, and and therefore as able to bring them back again as he was at the first to bring them. Oh Bre∣thren! let us take heed that wee perswade not our selves of peace, and yet walke according to the imagination of our wicked hearts; for then Gods wrath will flye out against us in a fearfull manner; and the greater his favours have been towards us, if we have not made good use of them, the greater will his judgements be when they come. And truely, I say, wee may justly feare that the Lord hath not yet done with us, but that he hath a controversie still with us, and one way or other will bring upon us some fearful jugdement.
Now therefore, that security may not too far get into the hearts of men, or other miseries or judgements come upon this Countrey before it have warning, I have thought good to take a little paines to write, and adventure to divulge this ensuing Treatise, wherein you may see that the Lord hath more plagues then War to inflict upon rebellious and stubborne people; and from that, have laid downe many things which tend to stirre up men to repentance, or to
prepare against future Judgements.
To you (deare Countrey-men) I send it, be∣cause first undertaken for your causes, in hope that it may be to meanes to row seup your dul∣nesse from that security, which too much pos∣sesseth you; It is not for any vain glorious end, or to gaine applause in the world that I have writ it; for there is no thing in it either for mat∣ter or manner that will relish with the worlds appetite: But as I am assured in my selfe that I ade at nothing more then Gods glory, and you my Countrey-mens welfare, so with more bold∣nesse doe I send it abroad, as it is, never doubt∣ing but that it will, not onely finde friends, but be kindly accepted of among honest-hearted and religious people, for the censures or respects of Malignants, wicked and godlesse men, I re∣gard not.
But if there shall be any, who, in stead of ta∣king warning by this alarme sent abroad by me, shall let loose their tongues against me to de∣fame me with any manner of malicious, idle, or wicked speeches, their words shall no further vex me, then that they no more respect their owne safety, in refusing warning because given by me; for I have formerly taken notice of,
and yet doe see, tempora et ingenia hominum ad invidiam proniora, quam ad aequitatem: and there∣fore have put on a resolution to undergoe what false imputations or slanders soever shall be rai∣sed of me, without grieving or vexing my selfe for it.
But if this shall but work that for which I send it into the world, it will rejoyce me excee∣dingly, and cause me to thinke all my labour not onely well, but happily bestowed, and I shall be further incouraged to goe on in my Studies for the furtherance of my Countreys welfare.
Accept of it loving Countrey-men, though not as a worke of eloquence and learning; yet as a worke needfull, as the case now stands with us, and as a worke which in token of my good affection, I dedicate unto you; let it not, I be∣seech you, be in vaine unto you, but as God hath hitherto graciously wrought for your deli∣verance from your enemies, and hath been and is so favourable unto you, that you enjoy such great tranquillity: so likewise account it as a favour, that now, when security possesseth you, he raises up still some to put you in minde of watchfulnesse, and endeavour to answer his ex∣pectation
who lookes now to finde and have some fruit from you, whom so carefully he hath not onely suffered to stand, but even manur'd a∣bout: If he finde none, take heed what follows, he hath more judgements then one, and knowes how to make this part that now flourisheth, an astonishment and by-word to all the earth.
But I doubt not, but as God hath hitherto been mercifull unto us, in sparing us, so likewise he will open our eyes to behold our sinnes with repenting hearts for them, and raise us up from security, that still he may delight to dwell a∣mong us.
That he may be thus mercifull unto us, shall be my daily prayer; and to stirre men up thus to meet him, shall be my constant endeavour, leaving the successe to God.
