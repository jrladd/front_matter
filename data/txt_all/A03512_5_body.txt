TO you, most learned Earle, whose learning can
Reiect vnlearned Custome, and Embrace
The reall vertues of a worthie Man,
I prostrate this great Worthie, for your grace;
And pray that Poesies well-deseru'd ill Name
(Being such, as many moderne Poets make her)
May nought eclipse her cleare essentiall flame:
But as she shines here, so refuse or take her.
Nor do I hope; but euen your high affaires
May suffer intermixture with her view;
VVhere Wisedome fits her for the highest chaires;
And mindes, growne old, with cares of State, renew:
You then (great Earle) that in his owne tongue know
This king of Poets; see his English show.
