them so freely, that they appeared gifts,
not obligations. And so in this Dedi∣cation,
I design to pay, not them, but

my respects. Neither intend I by it,
to recommend you to Posterity, for in

hath resolved, by speaking truth of you,
to repair and atton its former guilt, in
having so oft ly'd of others. But, Sir,
I have chose you to be the Patron of
this Book, because your practice is the
strongest Argument, whereby I can
evince what is undertaken in it, which
is to prove, That there is more ease in
Vertue then in Vice. And seing to
undertake the proof of this, were the
next crime to the doubting of it: And
since your Worthiness, and my esteem of
it, are much rais'd above the frail helps

both, by the innocent vanity I take in
