S th'awefull Child, that long hath truanted,
Dares not return vnto the Schoole, alone;
or Shame & Feare to be there discipled
ith many Stripes for many Faults in One:
ares (my Lord) My long Omission
f th'humble Thanks I ought haue tendered
or kinde Endeuours You bestowd vpon
My Right, my Wrong to haue recouered.
d, as (in fine) He brings his Mother forth
To beg Forgiueness, or his Fault to scuse:
o bring I beere My deer DUBARTAS Worth,
mediate for My too-faultie Muse;
Whom daign to pardon: and in gentle Part
Accept This last of His, not least in Art.
