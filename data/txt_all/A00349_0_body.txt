AFter that I had Englyshed thys Frenche boke incretyng very eligantly and compendi∣ously of the Ciuilitie and good maners of chyldehod and howe chyldren should behaue them selues in the Church, at the Table, in the Scole, in the Chamber, after Dyner and Supper, in commen and pryuate Assembles, to honorable and pri∣uate persones, to theyr Parents and Sco∣lemaysters, what Authours they shoulde rede, & how to repete thē, what raimēt thei should were, and howe to vse it, what dy∣ligence they shulde vse in theyre study and whan they shulde study, what semelye and manerly contenaunce of face gesture of hand and of the hole body should become them, what recreation and pastyme and what playes they shoulde vse and refuse, and wyth whom they should playe, what
they oughte to doe, or euer they prepare them selues to go to theyr reste, and what thei should afterwardes record & imagine wyth manyfold other thynges very mete and necessarye for the educacion and eru∣dition of children. I wyth my selfe reuol∣uynge and remembrynge how rusticallye and rudely the chyldren of thys noble re∣alme of Englande in moste places be broughte up, beynge ignorant of all good maners, thought it no lost time nor labor to translate thys lytle booke in to Eng∣lyshe for the crudicion of chyldren, and to dedicate the same to you a chylde, and yet a spectacle to all chyldren of all good ciui∣litie and pure maners where wyth ye doe manifestlye shewe where & vnder whose wynge ye haue bene nourished & brought vppe, that vnder the ferula and wynge of your father, a lerned and a noble man, adurned wyth all humanite and vertue, wyth all ciuilitie & godly behauiour, wyth wysdome & counsell, with affabilitie and comely gesture, wherfore it shalbe your parte from henceforth to ensue and folow the prudencie and wisdome, the nobilyte and erudicion, the pure and exquisyte ma∣ners
and the liberalite of your moste no∣ble father: for vnsemely it is the father to be serued, and the chylde vnterned, the fa∣ther to be lyberal, and the chyld prodigal the father to be mylde and meke, and the chylde vngentle and churlyshe, Therfore I woulde exhorte you in this your ten∣der age, to apply and to geue youre selfe to honor and to feare god, to erudicion & vertue, to honor and to obeye youre pa∣rentes and elders, & continually to serue God the geuer of al grace and goodnes, fo; so shall ye prosper both spiritually, and temporally, and obtaine the fa∣uour bothe of in nine, and of the immortall God for euer. Thus our Lorde encrease you and kepe you.
