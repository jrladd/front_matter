My Lord,
HOw differing so∣ever have been the Sentiments of Mankind in points of Decency and good Man∣ners, every Nation has
entertain'd and establi∣shed certain Maxims, as the Standards of a Wise and Prudent Conduct, and as things conducing nay necessary to render the Commerce of life as well agreeable as advanta∣geous. But what People have been most happy in the choice of such General Rules, is not very easy to determine; and should We allow the advantage to those who in each Age have laid most Claim to
Politeness, yet perhaps we may remain in some Perplexity thro' the num∣ber of the Candidates. Amongst the Foreign Modern Pretenders, the French seem to have the most General Vogue, which was the most prevalent Motive towards my put∣ting these Instructions into English, being the Essays of one of that Na∣tion, and thought wor∣thy of being dedicated to their King. But I know
not whether they be con∣siderable enough to attone for the presumption in making them an offering to your Lordship, but must be forced to have recourse to your Native Goodness for my Pardon. My Am∣bition to have your Lord∣ships Name in the Head of them, was, that the I∣dea of a Person of so much Honour, would be the means of re∣commending them unto the Good Opinion of the
World, and of making way for their reception, by setting before them the Model of what they only Copy. And indeed, though Greatness of Spirit, Ca∣pacity in Affairs, Solidi∣ty of Knowledge and of Judgment with Courage and Loyalty, in defence of our King and our Coun∣try, seem to be the Birth∣right of your Family; Yet the Modesty, Prudence, Penetration and Affa∣bility, which already ap∣pear
in all your Acti∣ons, show you endued with no less Charming Qualities than those which have acquired to your Family the Popular Glo∣ries you Inherit. Thus I can hardly forbear Tax∣ing my self as a Criminal to a High Degree, for as∣piring to Consecrate so small an Oblation to a Per∣son so every way Conspi∣cuous: But the early Testimonies your Lordship has given of your Gene∣rosity
and Disposition to Countenance all Mankind in things that tend to∣wards the promoting the Empire of Virtue, made me Flatter my self that your Lordship would not deny me your Protection in this Occasion. And brought me to give way to the incli∣nation I had to Honour your Merits: And though an Homage of this Na∣ture may in no wise be ca∣pable to proclaim your Virtues, yet I could no
longer hold from falling in with the General accla∣mations, nor forbear show∣ing the Zeal and Ambi∣tion I have to be accoun∣ted,
My Lord,
