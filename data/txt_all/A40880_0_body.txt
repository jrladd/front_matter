SIR,
IT was at Your Desire that this Discourse was pre∣pared, it appeared at the Assizes with Your Ap∣probation, and now at length in publick by Your Com∣mand. It's aim is to make the Magistrates Duty Chri∣stian, by laying before him the Relation he bears to the great Mediatorial King, the Honourable Trust he is advanced to in his Houshold, what Service he owes his Church and is capable of doing for her; in which consists the great Dignity of his Office, and without which it would remain Heathen still. And how weak soever the performance may be, or how unfit for the Press (for which you are answerable who have pro∣moted the Publication and carried it beyond its Design) yet the Foundation I doubt not will prove good; and this weak Essay, if it can attain no further, may at least provoke some abler hand to set this seasonable Truth in a better Light, whereby some good may ac∣crue
 to the Publick herein, which by whomsoever con∣veyed, will be highly acceptable (I know) to You, and to all the True Sons of the Church of England, particularly to
SIR,
