RIght Honorable, where as mention is made in the twelfth Chapter of the Reuelation of saint Iohn, of a great wonder in Heauen, namely, A woman clothed with the Sun, hauing the Moone vnder hir feete, and vpon hir head a Crowne of twelue Starres, &c. A wonder of

no small maruell amongst men; that was saide to bee a wonder in heauen containing some strange misterie, wherein the nature of the Sunne is not vnaptly to be considered, being a most goodly crea∣ture of God, and glorious in the ornament of hea∣uen, and no lesse beneficiall to all creatures of the earth, wherein also wee may beholde, not by any preposterous comparison of the creature, with the Creator, but by naturall coniecture with more ef∣fectuall motions in part to discerne; the glorious omnipotency and maruelous mercies in the migh∣tie Maiestie of the Creator of all beautie and be∣nefites: namely, in and by Jesus Christ the true Sonne that lighteneth all the worlde. Jn and by whom wee receiue so infinite, so great and ineffa∣ble blessinges, both for body and soule, as also in this world and in the world to come: vnto whom the naturall Sunne with his good gifts doth yeelde obedience as tributarie for his creation. Wherein we are so impotent duely to expresse or discerne the aboundance of his beneuolence: that wee are constrained with griefe of minde, to complaine of this carnall Carkasse so dull and vnapt to per∣forme the same, as a weak and feeble post, that fal∣leth

al to shiuers, vnder the burden of some weigh∣tie frame. By whose most pure and holie lawe, hee hath left vs, the more to moue our vnaptnes in some proportion according to our capacities, to conceiue of his most mercifull liberalitie, in heauen and earth, both now & euermore. Which holy law in generall construction of Christians, is truelie said to be the aparel of the church: that doth inuest hir selfe with the deuine and immaculate Lawe of Christ the sonne of God. And whereby the chri∣stian Church is indued with sounde knowledge to know God aright: and to liue in concord and ami∣able affection with all men. Which may be saide to be the peace of God which passeth all vnderstan∣ding, containing the most perfect harmonie of hea∣uenlie concorde, as also yeelding aspiring mindes vnto inexplicable blessinges: namely, to be deliue∣red from the terrible and the most cruell and ine∣stimable calamities and bondage of Sathan: to bee made a citizen of Heauen, of the fellowship of An∣gels, with most singular delight to beholde the glo∣rious Maiesty and presence of God, to possesse ioyes vnspeakeable, that the eies of man did neuer see, or his eares hath euer hearde, either may bee con∣tained

within the thoughts of his heart. By which corporatiō & number of the christiā Church, the heauens shall be adorned: & the glory of God most magnificētly magnified. The glorious & heauenly apparell aforesaid, not by outward apparāce vnto the eies of carnall men, but by the eies of a deuine mind is to be discerned: and in such wise to be con∣sidered as that which containeth all in all: for so much as it may not be truely said, that there is a∣ny true felicitie to be obtained by man, or to men; or true honour vnto God, but that in and by this saide lawe, is founde out, inioyed, and performed. Which holy lawe so much preuailed within the space of fiue or sixe hundred yeares after Christes incarnation, that the whole knowen Nations of the earth imbraced the same, vntill Sathan had begotten Antichrist his eldest Sonne, who doub∣ting some preuention of his fathers patrimony, ob∣tained the true stampe of his fathers phisiognomie, which is murder; to giue most certain testimonie by what spirit he is gouerned also conseruing vnto himself the very image of his own guilefull father, contriuing deceit, to beguile the diuell himself (if it were possible) by a supposed holines & religion, al∣though

counterfeit and most false. Neuerthelesse, the very cloake and couer of the most infernall drench of deadly poison, so shadowed with the ve∣hement spirite of hipocrisie, the guilefull enemie to all vertue, which the Christian estate both greedily and generally swallowed and deuoured in the darkned daies of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, to the cruell ouerthrow of all true Religion: with the whole frame of all the ineffable blessings afore∣said: And wherewithall by the power of a doubled spirite receiued from Sathan, in the Temple of the euerliuing God, he both forged and placed a newe vnknowen and a Monstruous god, neuer seene or heard of before the comming of Antichrist, a pre∣sumption neuer contained in the heart or thought of any person whatsoeuer, namely to increase and to establish a new God, but in the man of sinne; the son of perdition: which infernal inuention stret∣cheth it selfe beyond all his other wickednesse lea∣uing nothing vndone that was to bee done, either to the blasphemy & dishonor of God, or execrable crueltie against the whole generation of men: res∣pecting either the generality, in which number not one escapeth: or the horrour and the greatnes

of the euill in which hee that escapeth best cheape loseth body and soule. Ʋpon consideration, viewe and newes of which cursed new god, with scorne∣ful derision: All Jewes, Turkes, Mores, Sarazins, all Mahomatists and Jndian Idolaters, are fled as men hunted with a Monster from their salua∣tion. Before the inuention of which wretched god the greatest portion of all these Nations aforesaid, confessed Christ to bee their onely saluation: and doubtlesse otherwise the whole Nations of the earth, had beene submitted vnder the obedience of the gospell of Jesus Christ, but nowe by Gods per∣mission, when it may iustly be saide, that this saide Church of Christ the sonne of God, by the malice of Sathan, is brought vnto hir last decay, and left as desolate but onely in an angle of the world, the en∣gin of man being vtterly incapable of all remedie or reliefe for the same.
Euen then: Time, reuealer of hidden secrets, de∣liuereth demonstration that God himselfe hath e∣rected the woman mentioned in the twelfth chap∣ter of the Reuelation of saint Iohn, that nowe at this instant by Gods great fauour, standeth clo∣thed with the Sunne the right and most true ve∣sture

of the Church, namely, the most pure and holy lawe of Christ Iesus the Sonne of God, who with a most principall portion of fortitude, confirmed with an assured confidence in hir Christ and God, as a maine piller erected by deuine prouidence, to beare the weightie frame of reparation of this de∣caied and desolate Church of God aforesaide, pro∣ceeding with a minde vnappaulled to the daunge∣rous defence of the same, against all the enemies of Europe whatsoeuer, and as by a circle of the Sun, beeing placed, by deuine ordinaunce as a King a∣mongest the Planets, yeelding light and life vnto all signes and Starres of Heauen, euen so that wo∣man, which is said to bee the Reuelation of saint Iohn to bee adorned with the shining vesture of the Sunne, from the brightnes of which garment many Nations hath receiued, doth and shall re∣ceiue: both light and life vnto their great and e∣ternall comfort, and hauing the Moone according to the Text, placed vnder her feete, with great o∣bedience to yeelde assistance with all her force and influences, in strange enterprises by Sea to bee at∣chieued and right happily finished: and vpon hir heade, that Royall shining Crowne of twelue

Starres. In all obscure and difficult causes to con∣duct with a fatall faith, in most certaine, true and cleare direction: vpon which infallible foundati∣on, as an Archtector to aduaunce the most diffi∣cult, deuine and inexpungnable fortification for warfare, that euer was seene or hearde: not after the carnall man of flesh, but mightie through God, to cast downe holds, casting downe imaginations, and euery light thing, that is exalted against the knowledge of God: and bringing into captiuitie euerie thought to the obedience of Christ. This said spirituall warfare, so sufficiently furnished with such deuine armour and munition, yeelding most certaine hope of assured victorie.
Yet neuerthelesse, Sathan which neuer ceaseth his enuious inuasions against the children of God, is nowe constrained, to furnish his agent and eldest sonne Antichrist: not according vnto his accusto∣med manner, to deceiue the Nations with a slum∣bring potion of lethargie; plausible both to the de∣ceiuer and the deceiued, but with the inuention of othes: engines to inuade the houshold of faith, namely, fire, sword, treason and poison and such o∣ther straunge and vngodly tooles, wherewith hee

hath made sufficient proofe of his counterfeit holi∣nes, and whereby hee hath made bloudie hauocke of infinite noble and holie persons and hath daun∣gered the state of sundrie and many Countries, Kinges and Kingdomes, the onely euident reasons and arguments to defende his desperate estate, to vnderprop his decaious kingdome. But God him∣selfe hauing care of his owne causes, prouiding at his owne pleasure safetie and consolation for his elect in all their proceedinges, and also for seruice and defence of that sacred person inuested with the Sunne aforesaide. Certaine engines as yet vn∣knowen vnto the world, for ouerthrow of an hun∣dred thousand of his enemies vpon land: and to confounde a thousande Saile of Ships if they ariue within a mile of anie Shoare of England, as also for doubling of anie Cape, or forland Rocke, or sandie banke, either to pursue, or to escape being o∣uercharged with enemies, to enforce a Shippe to make waie at Sea against both winde and tide.
These straunge matters right Honorable, J thought conuenient (enforced by your Honors re∣ceiued fauour) constrained in longing desire by some laudable meanes, and in some portion to ex∣presse

my duetifull seruice vnto your Noblenesse, to present my humble sute vnto your Honour, both for my selfe and the matter; that wee may iointlie bee receiued into your Honours fauou∣rable protection, whereby the worke it selfe may obtaine generall and friendly entertaine∣ment, and the testimoniall and ornament of my commendation and behauiour, by your Honors good liking no little aduancement: Crauing with all humblenes that desire to doe well may bee mine excuse, for all defectes that herein may appeare: And J your Honors poore Orator shall nowe and alwaies pray vnto the euerliuing God, to illu∣strate your Noblenesse with great encrease and with euerlasting felicitie.
