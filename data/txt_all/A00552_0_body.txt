My very good Lords and Masters.
IF your graue Wisedomes
herein I offend.
My faithfull Muse
did neuer so intend;
For (though but plaine)
shee's honest, and shee's true,
And hath respect to God, King, Church and You.

In all humilitie shee's well content,
For her least fault to be right penitent;
And (of your fauors) craues but this for guerdon,
If well, your boon; if ill, your gentle pardon.
