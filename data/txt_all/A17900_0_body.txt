MOst gracious
& deare So∣uerayne
La∣dy:
as the chil¦dren
of Isra∣el
in ye Deute∣ronomy
were
commaunded to appeare before
God, not with emptie handes:

but to offer to his diuine Maie∣stie,
such thinges as their power
was able to supplie, in token of
their dewe obedience, and loyal
subiection, as of whom they re∣ceiued
al goodnes, so they ought
to render part to the geuer of al
Euen so it be houeth al faythfull
subiects to behaue thē selues to∣wardes
theyr king & gouernor:
especially those that dayly attēd
in seruynge of their deare soue∣raine
lord and king, and receiue
their lyuynge at their Prynces
bountiful, & most liberal hādes,
To whō, for acknowledging of
their Princes goodnes, as they
comenli render not part of their
liuing, for that neither can they
spare it, ne yet the Prince neede
it: so oughte they some meane to
deuise whereby their good wyll
and ial subiection may wel ap¦peare

to their king & maister to
whom thei are most boūden. In
the number of your dayly atten¦dant
seruaunts, most gracius so¦ueraine,
am I, most bounden to
your highnes, To whō my low∣ly
obedience better I coulde not
signify, then to deuise & endight
som what of true obedience. Ne∣ther
could I presēt to your high¦nes
any thinge of my pore store,
more acceptable then ye, wherby
housholdes, cities, cōmēweales
& Realmes are only enriched, &
most happely gouerned & mayn∣tained.
The contrarye whereof
hath brought thinges in a fewe
daies to greter ruine, then wise
and politicke heades could raise
& establishe in a nūber of yeres.
I nede not herein to make anye
discorse of old stories, neither of
Rome, Carthage, Athenes, or

Lacedemon: synce, euen here at
home, in myne owne countrey,
wyth myne owne griefe, I haue
seene suche hurt by disobedience
to haue happened to englād this
little Iland, that hath drawen
all Europe not only to admira∣tion
but also to lamentation, for
that the beautye of thys land by
disobedience hath beene so defa∣ced
& the grouud of al wealth so
shaken, that all other Nacions
by Englande might take exam∣ple,
to exchew the occasion of the
lyke Ruine. The woundes that
we therby haue receiued, beynge
nowe by God closed vp, & conti∣nualli
with the oile of your gra∣ces
goodnes, bathed & suppled,
at this presente to open againe,
I much mind not seing, that the
touchinge of on sinewe not per∣fitlye
healed maye dysturbe the

hole body: and yet I thoughte it
not vnmete to treate of, in suche
wise, as the reader may wel vn∣derstand,
what a fowle, and vg∣ly
monster disobediēce is: whose
faire pretensed enterprises plea∣sant
to the vnwise in the begin∣ning,
in the end brynges the fo∣lowers
to vtter cōfusion, much
like the poison of a scorpion rol∣led
together in the forme of a pil
sugred rounde aboute, and so re∣ceiued
into the bodye to purge yt
same, in steede of purgation brī∣geth
presente deathe. To whose
displeasātnes and wreched end,
true obedience compared, shall y•
better, wyth her swetnes allure¦ech
persō to walke in her vertu∣ous
pathe. And as by cōtraries
most thinges we tryed, so by cō∣parīg
these two most contraries
together: the falshoode of them

shalbe fullye dysclosed: and the
vertue of the other playnely set
foorth. In whyche myne enter∣prise,
mooste Gracious Soue-Ladye
the wante of learnynge
lette my good wyll supplye,
whyche I Dedicate too youre
highnes, rather that other may
receiue it the better, commynge
for the vnder the safeconduite of
youre Graces fauoure, then
to hope therby to atcheue
anye prayse, as kno∣weth
god: who pre∣serue
your Grace
and graunt you
youre hartes
desire.
