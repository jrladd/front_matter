MADAM,
WERE the having receiv'd one Fa∣vour, Encouragement enough for the Person thus oblig'd to beg ano∣ther, and were the Singular Freeness, with which it was confer'd, Sufficient to let him hope that he should not ask in vain; then have I no ordinary assurance, that a New Request will meet with success, who have re∣ceiv'd from your hands more Favours and Greater then I had ever any reason to Expect: of which I Shall only mention the Greatest your CONVERSATION. I am very well satisfied that by one of that Obliging Tem∣per for which Your Self are remarkable, to ask New Favours may be look'd upon as the best way of showing our Esteem for past ones, and returns are not expected from one, whose Power is so little, that he cannot make 'em Suitable; and his Acknowledgments so great that he would not make them otherwise. Such
 Considerations as these, have been the Occa∣sion of this Bold Attempt, and made me pre∣sumptuously entertain some thoughts, that what I had here wrote might not be altogether un∣acceptable to You. This had I Dedicated to any other Person, I might then have reasonably fear'd lest it should Suffer under that Patro∣nage; whereas at present, I believe, it will justly argue a point of Prudence in a Man, who mistrusts the Sufficiency of his endeavours like me, to have recourse to one who is able to main∣tain 'em like YOU. I must confess I have a great deal of Reason to fear you will be too severe in your Sentiments of these Compositions; when You shall give your self the Trouble to read 'em over: both because your Judgment's so Great, and my Performances so Mean. The same apprehensions will those Pieces more particularly that are Imitated from the French, raise in me; your acquaintance with that Language being so intimate, and mine but just Sprung. So that had I not Experienc'd your Candour, I had had no colour for the Pre∣tence of this Epistle, which, if it meet with a kind Reception will be the greatest Satisfacti∣on in the world to,
Madam,
