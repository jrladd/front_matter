My good friend!
You must excuse mee, if I join my thoughts with yours, and further give waie to op∣portunitie pressing the pub∣lishing our heartie short breathings af∣ter the good of the Common-wealth, rais'd and preserv'd even to miracle. Bee not discouraged to continue your contri∣butions. I know wee now desire onely to laie this rough work before better heads and hands: and bee assured this Nati∣on is not barren altogether of self-deny∣ing spirits, and ingeuous Patriots: and though Holland seem to get the start of Us, yet wee may so follow, as to stand

at length upon their shoulders, and so see further. Our present transactions make us look like Martha, wee hope our great end will appear to bee Marie's, One thing necessaie. Bear with us till the North and South have blown peace∣ably and sweetly upon our Garden, and then call for the ripe fruits. For all pre∣sent differences tie up your judgment a while, and know that God reigneth, let the earth rejoice: Doubtless mer∣cie and truth will follow the Saints now deeply engaged. Live and love
