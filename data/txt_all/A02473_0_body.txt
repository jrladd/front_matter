PArdon mighty Prince
my boldnesse, thus
presuming into you
presence vvith o
lame an Oblation.
Hauing a sute to your
Maiestie (which is not for Money,

but a few good words), and hauing
no Friend in Court, I thought a
Petition might miscarry, and this
therefore the safer kind of begging
to make  speake for her selfe.
Whereas therefore I am much im∣pouerisht
through suites of Law
(wherein I haue been tenne yeares
holden from mine owne, by the
malice of a stronger Aduersary) and
many other bad Debtors, who by
their ill dealing, compell mee to
transport my selfe and Familie into
Virginia, or New England; my suit is,
that your Gratious Maiestie would
bee pleased to speake a good word
for me, that I may obtaine the be∣nefit
of Master Suttons charitie for
a little Son of mine, whom I would

gladly leave behind me o increase an
ancient (and not ignole) name again
in your Maiestys Dominions whe∣rein
there is not a man living of that
name beside myself and mine. For
which your gracious clemency, I
shall not fail daily to pray for your
Maiesty's health and prosperity in
this world and eternal happiness
in the world to come.
