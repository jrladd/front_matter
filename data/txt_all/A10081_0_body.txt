May it please your Hurs;
I Prefix your worthy & great names afore this plain and
unpolished Dis∣course: not that I intend to thrust my pen into any quar∣relsome theam, that may provoke the fury of the
Dans of this world,Gen. 49.17 that ser∣pent-like lye in the paths, to bite the heele of every pas∣senger; betweene whom and mee, I should intreat your Honors as a screen, to interpose, to hide me from their rage. For surely, no Chri∣stian
hath so farre changed his huma∣nity with a beast, or cast himselfe so ma∣ny degrees behinde the purblinde Gen∣tiles, as professedly to beare armes a∣gainst a Booke ho∣noured with the ti∣tle of the Feare of God. Neither dare I over-weeningly presume, that there is any thing in the stile or conveyance of the subject in hand, that meriteth
an admission into your Honours clo∣sets, much lesse in∣to the Cabinet of your more serious thoughts, or that may attract an eye of favour from you. My weekly labou∣ring in Gods Har∣vest, forbids pompe in language, and ambition of quo∣tation. Next the advancement of Gods glory (which as our ultimate end, ought to regulate,
moderate, stint, and bound our actions) the scope that I le∣vell at, is the un∣feigned expression of my gratitude, and service, which your constant coun∣tenance, your unde∣served bounty, your propitious accep∣tance of my meane fore-past labours, doth more than challenge from me, who desires no longer to draw his breath, than hee
shall study to ap∣prove himselfe
