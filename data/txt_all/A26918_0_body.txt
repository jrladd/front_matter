Reader,
IF thou think this Trea∣tise
both superfluous
and Defective, when so
many larger have bet∣ter
done the work al∣ready,
I shall not at all gainsay the
latter, nor much the former. The
reason of my writing it was the
necessity and request of some very
upright Godly persons, who are
lately faln into doubt or Errour, in
point of the Sabbath day, conceiv∣ing
that because the fourth Com∣mandment
was Written in Stone,

it is wholly unchangeable, and con∣sequently
the seventh day Sabbath
in force, and that the Lords day is
not a Day separated by God to holy
Worship. I knew that there was
enough written on this Subject long
agoe; But, 1. Much of it is in
Latine; 2. Some Writings which
prove the abrogation of the Jewish
Sabbath, do withal treat so loosly
of the Lords day, as that they re∣quire
a Confutation in the latter as
well as a commendation for the
former. 3. Some are so large that
the persons that I write for will
hardly be brought to read them.
4. Most go upon those grounds,
which I take to be less clear; and
build so much more than I can do
on the fourth Commandment and
on many passages of the old Testa∣ment,
and plead so much for the
old Sabbatical notion and rest, that
I fear this is the chief occasion of

many peoples Errours; who when
they find themselves in a wood of
difficulties, and nothing plain and
convincing that is pleaded with
them, do therefore think it safest
to stick to the old Jewish Sabbath
The friends and acquaintance of
some of these persons importuning
me, to take the plainest and nearest
way to satisfie such honest doubters,
I have here done it according to my
judgement: not contending against
any that go another way to work,
but thinking my self that this is very
clear and satisfactory; viz. to prove,
1. That Christ did Commission his
Apostles to Teach us all things
which he commanded, and to set∣tle
Orders in his Church, 2. And
that he gave them his spirit to ena∣ble
them to do all this Infallibly, by
bringing all his words to their re∣membrance,
and by leading them
into all truth. 3. And that his Apostles

by this spirit did de facto separate the
Lords day, for holy Worship, espe∣cially
in Church-Assemblies, and
declared the cessation of the Jewish
Sabbaths. 4. And that as this
change had the very same Author
as the Holy Scriptures (the Holy
Ghost in the Apostles) so that fact
hath the same kind of proof, that
we have of the Canon and the inte∣grity
and uncorruptness of the par∣ticular
Scripture Books and Texts:
And that, if so much Scripture as
mencioneth the keeping of the
Lords day, expounded by the Con∣cent,
and Practice of the Universal
Church from the dayes of the
Apostles, (all keeping this day as
holy, without the dissent of any
one Sect, or single person that I re∣member
to have read of,) I say if
all this History will not fully prove
the point of fact, that this day was
kept in the Apostles times, and con∣sequently

by their appointment,
then the same proof will not serve
to evince that any text of Scripture
is Canonical, and uncorrupted; nor
can we think that any thing in the
world, that is past, can have Histori∣cal
proof.
I have been put to say somewhat
particularly out of Antiquity for
this evidence of the fact, because it
is that which I lay the greatest stress
upon. But I have not done it so
largely as might be done, 1. Be∣cause
I would not lose the unlearn∣ed
Reader in a Wood of History,
nor overwhelm him instead of edi∣fying
him. 2. Because it is done
already in Latine by Dr. Young in his
Dies Dominica (under the name of
Theophilus Loncardiensis;) which I
take to be the moderatest, soundest
and strongest Treatise on this sub∣ject
that I have seen; Though
Mr. Cawdry, and Palmer (joyntly)

have done well and at greater
length: and Mr. Eaton, Mr. Shep∣hard,
Dr. Bound, Wallaeus, Rivet, and
my dear friend Mr. George Abbot
against Broad have said very much:
And in their way, Dr. White, Dr. Hey∣lin,
Bishop Ironside, Mr. Brierwood, &c.
3. I chose most of the same Cita∣tions
which Dr. Heylin himself pro∣duceth,
because he being the man
that I am most put to defend my
self against, his confessions are my
advantage. 4. And if I had been
willing, I could not have been so
full in this, as the Subject will be∣speak,
because I have almost eleven
years been separated from my Li∣brary,
and long from the neigh∣bourhood
of any ones else.
I much pitty and wonder at those
Godly men, who are so much for
stretching the words of Scripture,
to a sense that other men cannot
find in them, as that in the word

[Graven Images] in the second Com∣mandment,
they can find all set
Formes of Prayer, all composed
studyed Sermons, and all things
about Worship of mans invention
to be Images or Idolatry; and yet
they cannot find the abrogation of
the Jewish Sabbath in the express
words of Col. 2. 16. nor the other
Texts which I have cited; nor can
they find the Institution of the Lords
day in all the Texts and Evidences
produced for it. But though Sa∣tan
may somewhat disturbe our
Concord and tempt some mens
Charity to remissness, by these dif∣ferences,
he shall never keep them
out of Heaven, who worship God,
through Christ, by the Spirit, even
in spirit and truth: Nor, shall he,
I hope ever draw me, to think such
holy persons as herein differ from
me, to be worse than my self,
though I think them in this to be

unhappily mistaken: much less to
approve either of their own separa∣tion
from others, or of other mens
condemning them as Hereticks, and
inflicting severities upon them, for
these their opinions sake.
