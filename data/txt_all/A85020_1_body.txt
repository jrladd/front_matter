WHen I consider the
many worthy works
which had their first
being within the
bounds of this our Parish, I may
justly be ashamed, that my weak

endeavours should be borne in
the same place.
For first, the book of Mr.
Cranmer (afterwards Arch-Bishop
of Canterbury, and
Martyr) containing the Rea∣sons
against King Henry the 8th
his Marriage with Queen Ka∣tharine
Dowager, was
compiled in ourFox Acts and Monu∣ments, page 1860. Pa∣rish,
whilest the said
Cranmer retired hither (in the
time of a Plague at Cam∣bridge)
to teach his Pupils.
Thus did Waltham give Rome
the first deadly blow in En∣gland,
occasioning the Popes

primacy to totter therein, till it
tumbled down at last.
The large and learned works
of the no lesse Religious then In∣dustrious
Mr. Fox in his book
of Martyrs was penned here,
leaving his posterity a consider∣able
estate at this day possessed
by them in this Parish.
What shall I speak of the no
lesse pleasant then profitable
pains of Reverend Bishop Hall
(predecessor in my place) the
main body of whose Books bears
date from Waltham.
And shall my unworthy pam∣phlet
presume to follow such able

works from the same place?
However seeing my publike pro∣mise
is solemnly past to you, to
Print the same (hoping some
profit may thence arise to you
and others) let it as a Page at
due distance wait upon the works
of those most eminent Authors.
Some will say this your In∣fants
Advocate hath almost
been as long in the breeding, and
birth, as Infants use to lye in
their Mothers womb; so many
moneths hath past betwixt the
promise and performance there∣of.
But let none grudge the
time if it appear at last in its

perfect shape, coming forth
soon enough for those who will
reap benefit thereby; Too soon
for such who will take causless
offence thereat.
Some perchance will take ex∣ception
at the plainness thereof
which by me was purposely af∣fected
herein. It is a good leslon
which may be learned from the
mouth of a bad master, even
Rayling2 Kings 18. 27. Rabshakeh,
not to deliver a message
of publick concernment, in a
language which a few Courtiers
only do understand, but in a
tongue whereby all the people

on the wall may partake there∣of.
And seeing the generali∣ty
of our opposers are unlearned,
I conceived it my duty to decline
all difficult words and phrases,
that all might more easily and
perfectly perceive the truth ther∣in.
Some perchance might expect
a confutation of their practice
which are Re-baptized; a task
needless for me to perform. For
such repetition of Baptism will
follow of course to be vain, if not
wicked, unneedful if not unlaw∣ful;
where the lawfulness and
needfulness of Infants Baptism

hath formerly been proved. Bap∣tism
once wel done on Infants,
I may say, is twice done, which
twice done is once ill done,
namely when it is iterated the se∣cond
time without any just rea∣son
for the same.
What remains (dear Pari∣shioners)
but that I pray that
my weak Preaching may be
powerful and profitable unto
you, that you may do and suf∣fer
cheerfully according to the
will of God; Remember the ad∣dition
of the name of your Pa∣rish,
HOLY CROSSE: It mat∣ters
not though Crosse be the

sur-name, if Holy be the Chri∣stian
name of our sufferings:
whilest that God who sendeth
them sanctifieth them unto us,
which is the daily prayer of
