Anagram
 So fame doth raign.

SO Fame doth raigne with Anagram's so fit
As if that Nature had inuented it:
For he that knowes thy Vertues and thy Name,
Will say all raigne in thee, all ring thy Fame.

Thomas Gainsford. 
Anagram
Shade t'Honours game.

A pale for shelter of her game is made,
And thou to Honours game art made a shade,
Thy Huntsup's Vertue, and thy Beagle grace,
Which (well in winde) hath still the game in chace.
