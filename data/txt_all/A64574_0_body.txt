POndering often in my Mind (High and Mighty Princes, and my Noble Patrons) the Great and many Favours which Your Grand and Prince∣like Liberality hath most Graciously heaped upon me, and thereby Eternally obliged me to Your Excellencies; I became solicitous and concerned in my thoughts, with what Veneration and Industry of Wit (answerable to the Obsequiousness of my Devoted mind) I might declare by some Testimony, at least, an endeavour of Gratitude for Your Benefits bestowed upon me. 'Tis the guise of Others in Dedicating their Lucubrations to Princes and Nobles, chiefly to concern themselves in Blazoning their Ge∣nealogies, and in Decyphering their Praises and Heroick Acts, in an high Method of Elegancy, thereby extolling them (as we say) with an open mouth to the Skies. But I (well knowing that the full-blown Elogies of Talkative Fame, do displease Your Excellencies, especially since glorious and me∣morable Vertue it self, for so many Ages backward (toge∣ther with Magnanimous Bounty) have flourished in the most August House of Brunswick and Lunenburg, and by God's
Blessing will ever flourist in the same) I, I say, waving there∣fore all such Proceedure do come only furnished with a gift not large, nor great (though you are worthy of both) nor glit∣tering with Gold, Silver, or Precious Stones, Ornaments which (Divine Bounty hath aboundantly replenished Your Highnesses withall, but) are denied to me, and persons of my condition: Mine is only a Paper gift, but extracted from the true Protochymick Art, which is most Ancient, and hath more in the Recess than it promises in the Front: Yea it is That, by which the uncreated Spirit, the Founder of the World dd order and distinguish the (otherwise) confused Natures of things. Hereupon I perswaded my Self, that I could offer no gift more grateful to Your Highnesses, than a new work of this most Vetust, yet Wonderful and Necessary Science. A Work most curious in it self, which hitherto Envy hath forborne to restore, and to gratify the World with: For although the unconquerable Truth comes commended only by its own strength, and is sufficiently fortified by its proper and native Vigor (for nothing can subsist, which is not fir∣med in the very Foundation of Nature) and so enjoys this invincible Patronage; yet the plain Purity of my Writings being Dedicated to Your Eminencies, and thereby armed with so great Splendor, thus doubly strengthened, will appear more boldly in the sight of the World. Accept therefore (most No∣ble Princes) this Diminutive Gift for the bare Title's sake, and go on, if not entirely to love, yet somewhat to respect and favour,
VENICE the Ides of May, 1666.
