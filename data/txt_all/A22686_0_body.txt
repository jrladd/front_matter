FOrsomyche as a∣mong
many, ther
is on corrupt sort
of heretiques, &
malicious despis∣ars
of the moste
benigne, and liberat grace of God
(right godly disposed Ladi) which
wyl haue, that hys, omnipotent, &
almighti maiesty sholde be (as it
wer) after a certain fashion bound
to ther viel fragylyte and wea∣knes,
and not rather them selfe to
hys omnipotency and infinit po∣wer,
deneyeng hys eternal prede∣stination

makīg it none otherwise
to be certain, thā as, they wyl haue
yt them selues: yea, many of them
vtterly denieng, that there is any
predestination, at al, which are of y•
great masters: & stout defendars
of fre wyl, hauing in ther heddes y•
eyse of cocarices in ther tōgs the
stings of adders, and in ther sto∣machs
the poyson of, todes, kiuer∣ed
and cloked ouer with goodly
wordes, such as a man wold think
did com from the mouth of god
hym self with outward religion,
and sanctimony of lyfe, being able
to deceaue yea those which at wise
men, iche more the simple & vn∣lerned
people: I haue therfore ta∣ken
vpon me to shew vnto them,
yea, not to them, but to those whō
they go about to deceaue, y• this do¦ctryn
of predestination, whiche the
goly men do reche, and they most

wyckedly denied, is no straunge &
new doctryn, but sice as the old
church hath alway firmly beleued
& constantly defendid, translating
this noble worke of the great doc∣tor
saint Augustin, entituled, of y•
predestination of sayncts, whiche
at the elect and chosen people of
god, foorthe of the laten, into oure
mother tong, that al men maye se
before ther eyes, how rank & dedly
ther poyson is, and so take hede &
beware therof in time. And lykwis
as this boke is to be set abrode to
conuince them which do stond in y•
denial of the predestinatiō of god,
which this godly doctor dyd wry∣ght
agaynst certayne heretiques
that denied the grace of god to be
a fre gyft, proceding of hys owne
goodnes, & not of our deseruings
euen so, it semed to me a thing ve∣ry
necessari, for this present tyme,

against these venemose beastes
which do enfect al most al mē, whō
they do but look on, with the dedli¦eys
of ther poysonos docryn I do
mean the anabaptysts and fre wyl
masters▪ whych are so mych more
daungerouse, as ther myschefe is
cloked with a dobl face of holines
ten tyms more religious to sem to
than were y• supersitious & arro∣gant
papystes: whych beastes (&
say) do holde a contray heresy to
those whō saynt Augustin did im¦ponge,
graunting that the begin¦nyng
of our belefe is the gyfte of
god which theye denied, but with
toothe and nayle defendyng, that
al good workes are of our selfe,
(which thother ascribed to ye gift of
god) and that al good workes are
in our own power ether to do thē,
or to leaue them vndone, procedīg
of our owne fre wyl, affyrmyng al

so moste erronyosly, that his wor¦kes
do none otherwyse take effect
in vs, than we wyl of oure selfe re∣ceaue
them, making his heuenly
maiesty bound to a sorte of encar¦nate
deuyls, (for how maye he be
called omnipotent, if any parte of
his omnypotency stondeth in the
wil of man?) I thoughte it I saie,
necessari to ioyn to this his forsaid
boke of y• predestination of saints
the seconde boke which he wrot of
the vertu of perseuerance, or con¦tinuance
in goodnis to the ende, ye
forsomiche, as they do condemne
al men of thys age whiche are of a
contrary iudgment vnto them, we
might nowe se what fault they can
fynd in thys great doctor by what
reasō ther erronyos opiniōs shold
not be condemnid as moste detesta¦ble
and dangeros to be, sufferyd &
born ye lytel flok of Chryst But I

suer they wil not come abrod. For
they do lork ī cornats, they do crep
secretly into mens bosoms, seking
whō they may sting lyke vnto sna¦kes
which do lye hid vnder y• gre
grasse. I wold coūsel al men to be∣ware
of thē. For the end of al there
studys and labors (how holy a pre¦tence
soeuer they haue) at, not only
the destruction of y• souls of men
but also the vtter confusion & sub¦uersion
of whol commen welthes:
declaring therby, y• they at a more
pestelent sect than euer wer the pa∣pistes.
Which papistes althoughe
they were right nought for y• soul
yet were they good and profyta∣ble
for the body for ciuil common
welthes, for the mētinaunce of cy∣uil
iustice, & al good politique or∣ders.
But as for thes, thei ar nether
good for ye body nor for the soule
yea they ar most mortal enemies

and cruell murtherers to both.
Forthermore, by these two smalle
workes, your grace shall perceaue
howe necessarye a thynge it is,
that the predestinatiō of god shul∣de
be knowen amonge the people,
y• ignorance wherof, what is it els
but the veri lacke of knoledge of
y• grace of god. And that not kno∣wen,
as it ought to be, how can the
glori of god be praised as it shold
be, yea howe is it not by that mea¦nes
obscured, and hidde frome
them whiche shoulde haue it, and
so geue to god his right praise?
To the confusion therfore, and
shame of thos detestable & shamles
heretiques, and for the erudition
of the rest of the people, whiche are
vnlerned and easi to be deceaued,
I haue brought thes workes into
oure mother tounge that all men
maye▪ vnderstonde them, beinge so

boulde vnder your graces fauour
as to dedicate them to your grace
as to a faythfull mother of all
good workes, that thereby the
trewth may be knowen, and god
praysed in all thinges: whose
spiryte I beseche to be with youre
grace that your soule maye be
edefied and made strong
in hym whiche is the
only author of al
godlynes So
be it.
