Dear SIR,
WHat that sad occasion of the Funeral of so near a Relation offered me to impart, for the refreshing and comforting of the spirits of many mournful Friends, and for the sa∣tisfying of many raised expectations, in bringing to their remembrance some things which ought to be every days thoughts, as they are every days hazard, your effectual request

hath drawn forth to a common review: and if some witty censurer should pretend to know already all that can be said on this Scripture, and Subject, it being of so common a Concern, I only say, I am glad he hath been so well in∣structed; yet I fear he may need a Remembrancer, to whisper in his ear, Abi tu, & fac similiter; for it fares with Sermons and Doctrines now adays, as with Seamens dangers, their commoness causeth their disregard; and hearers are as the Catadupi, who are deaf with the frequent falls of Nile. Sir, I have been told of the desires of many to have the fight of these Para∣graphs; and I am willing to comply with; and to gratifie every such pious desire, if it be their piety indeed, and not their prejudice or partiality; and it were happy if the reading eye, as well as the hearing ear might be busied in bringing in more Traffick to enrich the Soul, ut you easily apprehend the great disadvantage of a dead let∣ter, in comparison of that life and energy which elocution adds to any discourse; such scribling of Sermons is but meer Paper-work in comparison of the powerful utterance of the Preacher; and I more than conjecture, that these Notes will lose much of their efficacy, by Transcription

with reference to the different time, place, and tem∣per of Readers now, and Hearers then; for when Chri∣stians attend at Funerals, and sit over Graves, and are a∣mused with the doleful passing Bell, and look upon Skulls, and dead Bones, and Ghastly Spectacles, upon the drop∣ping eyes and despondent looks of Mourners, they have, if ever, some suitable self-humbling apprehensions of their own mortality, and accordingly have more penetrable, and more penitential spirits, apter to take impression from, and to make a more lively expression of the more mortifying Doctrines.
And the same must Readers be of when they take in and to traverse such a Subject as is here presented: they must go up to Mount Calvary, and walk up and down at Golgotha. I mean, their high minds must be, as 'twere mortalized, and they must with that Disciple stoop down,i. e. morti∣fied. and look into the Sepulchre, and turn the Grave cloaths off the Holy Jesus, who was dead, and is alive, that they may learn from him, as the great Exemplar, the Mystery of dying whiles they live; may every one that shall read these lain Pages be thus disposed, that his profiting may ap∣pear,

and the Subject lose no weight by the levity of the Reader; else all that is written may unhappily be resented no better than a Riddle, or a waking Dream to drowzie reason, which is to the faith and practice of a lively Chri∣stian, the most material concern of his whole life. Sir, whatsoever this well meant Essay may be, or howsoever it be taken, it is my first fruits of tendering such kind of Presents, which I offer to you in testimony of my Religi∣ious Affection to you the principal of all my dear Kindred, to be made more publick from my hand to yours and theirs, and any ones else to whom you shall please to recommend it; for it challengeth entertainment, (which is a bold word) but not from any thing on the Auohors part, but from its own excellent and Catholick Obligation. And that the Discourse may meet with the like reception, as when first delivered (for God gave utterance, entrance, acceptance, and all of his Grace) I have caused and confined my con∣ceptions, as near as I could to go back to the very plain stile wherein I then expressed them; as thinking it better, (though not easier) to fetch up those very words I let fall, than to start a new strain, and follow the chase of a more polite and better studied language; wherefore

what it pleased my dear Friends to hear with patient atten∣tion, and with so good liking to approve, and with so hearty affection to desire, I do not repine, and hope shall not re∣pent that it should come abroad; that this Paper may pre∣sent those things to the eyes of all our Relations, and o∣ther Christian Well-willers, which in the Delivery (for which I bless God) sounded so well in the ears of your experienced Auditors, (and I hope in God) found an e∣al room and residence in so many gracious hearts.
I confess it is an easier Task for a Preacher, Writer, Reader, than for a practiser of this Discourse, Sic vi∣ere, sic mori. And there's no cause to fear it, one  S. Peters , things hard to be understood, as it  hard to be undergone; for like all other necessary Go∣pel Truths, it is plain in its own simplicity, and may  have a free passage, (not through the ears, but) rough the life in a free practice,Act. 17. else it will be used as a  thing (as at Athens) only to be admired and talk∣d of.
But I trust this fault of Men, and Fate of Sermons will be amended and prevented by this Doctrines Enter∣tainment; for although it be foreign and formidable to self sparing nature, yet is it highly pertinent and prevalent in order to the advances of Grace, and a sober, just, and pious life; and although it seems to be all Mystery, and Theory, and Paradox for the living daily to die; yet S. Paul reduceth it to a practicable State: As dy∣ing,2 Cor. 6.9. and behold we live. In short, it is a Task, though difficult, yet possible (as all Salvation work is.) It is an excellent Art, and a necessary comprehensive Duty, of vast Extent; and as a rich Merchant of co∣pious correspondence, and brings home to the Soul upon good assurance a vast Revenue of Wisdom and good Works.
And I do rejoice, Sir, that you told me this Sermon was by many most passionately craved in Copy, which is a pledge, and likely presage, that all which may have the

draught of it, may, and do resolve to write and walk af∣ter it in duty; which that they may, the God of all Truth and Grace go forth with it, and prosper it, and bless those that read and hear it, so as to learn and live it, and all in the rare exercise of Daily Dying.
For me (dear Sir) whatsoever I am, or have, or can speak, write, or act in the utmost of my poor Facul∣ties, which are any ways communicable, you have justly merited that all shall be yours: so as this, and whatever Service I shall be capable to do for you, is devoted to your self, not only upon the account of so near Relation, and so notable Benefactions, but from the confidence I have that much of this Mystery is already transcribed, and become legible in your own heart; and these severer Truths make deepest Impresses, and find best reception upon the Heart-Tables of experienced Christians, such prize them best, practise them best, and prove them best. And that you and I and all that read these Lines may be of this number, and we all may set upon this Work, and

do it well, for it is our Master-piece for Eternity, is the Hearts desire, and prayer of
Dear Sir,
