Right Honourable Lord,
WHereas your Il∣lustrious
Ho∣nour
is not ig∣norant,
and
all the World
knows, that as Divinity and
essential truths are therefore

eternal and 
because such; so falshood
must needs decay and va∣nish,
and that the learning of
our late reforming Divines
consisting onely in some su∣perficial
Talent of preaching
language or elocution, and
not in deep knowledge of
Philosophy, Metaphysick,
and much less of that most
solid profitable and subtile
method call'd School Divi∣nity,
aims onely at non proce∣dere
ad perfectioneni sed ad per∣mutationem,
still teaching to
go forward not to perfection
but to perpetual change, lea∣ping
from ignorance to a
prejudicate opinion and ne∣ver

taking a good judgment
in their way: and this, for
that the enemy of mankind
moving Hereticks to deride
and sleight School Divinity
looks at no less then the to∣tal
ruine of all Religion and
faith—Hence most Honou∣rable
Lord, I thought it no ill
Office of a Patriot for the
undceiving of many to con∣trive
this succinct Methodical
Treatise of School Divinity,
which now runs for shelter
to the glorious protection of
your Honour, a person in∣comparably
Illustrious and
accomplish'd in all royal and
moral virtues, nam geminas
animi nobilitate genus: the

general report, fame and ap∣plause
of your rare genius,
transcendent worth, and
known abilities in most part
of all learning hath invited
me to the boldness of this ad∣dress;
for to whom more fitly
should a small Treatise in∣tended
for to establish truth
(now when most malign'd &
despis'd) run or Patronage
then to your most illustrious
Lordship, a Vigorous ho∣nourer
and indefatigable In∣vestigator
of truth, the na∣tural
pleasing object of our
understanding! Pray Hea∣ven
it prove worthy your
acceptance: for my part I
shall ever acknowledge your

greatness, admire your glory,
and from your goodnesse
raise to my self a hope that
you will vouchsafe to cherish
these weak fruits of my elu∣cubrations;
for such is the
sublime, and magnificent
amplitude of your soul as it
will harbour with benign
indifferencie what is spoken
against your own sense,
judgement, and consent, my
scope being to serve and ho∣nour
not to instruct you, nei∣ther
to engage you in the
Patronage of what I deliver
more then truth shall con∣vince
your judgement. Vale
& diu feliciter vive Nobilium
decus & magnae Britania orna∣menium

—This shall be the
constant humble supplica∣tion
of
Most truly Noble
And
Right Honourable
Lord,
