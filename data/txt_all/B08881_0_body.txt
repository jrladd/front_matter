MOther your Love to me was shown
Before that I could go alone,
For with Nectar then you fed me,
And in tender manner bred me:
Till perceiving once that I
Was able on my wings to flie;
I did descend unto the Earth,
With my Bow to make some mirth:
For all the World is my park,
Where when I shoot I hit the Mark;
Young Men and Maidens are my Game,
While I the little Bowman am;
Yet lest you may think my leasure
 do only waste in pleasure:
These Posies I have writ of late,
Which to you I dedicate:
That so the love may be exprest,
Of your son that loves you best.
