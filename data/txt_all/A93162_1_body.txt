SIR!
IT was a sufficient sa∣lute for the A∣therian Prince, to entertain the Ro∣man Emperor in bidding him welcome to a banquet of Orations. Strange dain∣ties indeed! And a new in∣vented Rethorick to expresse Congratulation: I wish it
were so now, then might I onely go into the Verdent Bowers of Helicons Elizium, to gather the Crimson Roses floreate in their chiefest blos∣some, to crop the gaudy Lil∣lies Liveried, in the rich Di∣apry of Flora's Wardrobe, to make Sallets for the feasts of your appetite, but such shadows please not with re∣freshing coolnesse, nor can the Painted Superficies of Apol∣lo's Language court a nice Daphne; that is, allure your Fancy in the Enamouration of
this beauty. I have, Read it was a Veneration for god∣desse Fortuna, if the Romans could have leave to expresse their Engagements, as if the Flexanimous Suada of their Complementive Eloquence, could cancell all obligations, and Cramp the Largest Indentures into Articles dormant, but here (though a Nobler favo∣rite is my friend) that is, the smiling Oratory of your goodnesse gives an invitati∣on, if I should break forth into a confession, it would be
the confusion of lisping Elo∣quence. Yet grant the insuf∣ficiency, Humane instinct concludes the Epilogue of our lives, with the Epiphonema of gratitude, if a Cobler's Crow (taught by an Eloquent Grammar) Natures docu∣ments, could Complement this Languae with a salve Caesar, if the melodious Queristers turned Papists in their wooden cloisters can express their hum∣ble addresses to the Spring-Deity, with the cantation of an Ave-mary as we see Philo∣mel
in melancholly devotions adoring her shrine, and the rest like courtiers, enamoured on her beauties when she appeares in the Ʋirgin gayities of Mai∣den blushes; well may Ratio∣nality teach me a new Logick and make it the onely Proprium of a man to be gratefull, the si∣lent Rivers, who in their soft murmurs already speak the tone of affections, can return their derivations to the Primitive Fountain, and you, who are the Originall spring from which my Rivolets do flow, may well ex∣pect
a returne with usury, whereas my mites Widowed from other monies adds no∣thing to your treasure. Yet I see you expect congratulati∣on. Poor Phoebus, thy Castaly runs not with the same Nectar, as Pactolus his streams: our Parnassus has nothing but the regall Gar∣land, and that is no suf∣ficient present to commend your favours, or speak the Highnesse of your deserts; I should have with Hercules pursued the golden fruit (if I
would follow the famed Querps of those brave Po∣liticians, whom Love could never out wit) and present those Hesperides which times past, and Virgill's Amorist thought, sufficient to allure a lover, thus he Vants.
Aurea mala decem misi, cras altera mittam,
I should have with Trojan He∣roe attempted the Auriate bough which transported his ravished Genious before death to glorious Thessaly, and inoculate it in the Garden of your bountyes,
that so by the sweet breath∣ing Zephirs playing two and fro it's leaves, your plea∣sures being wafted to a Paradise of smiles; I might find a mild Purgatory to re∣fine mee to gratitude. But that is a second Aeneas his labour to performe; therefore I cannot sleep the same Dream, (that is) have the like felicity. How then shall I Ransack Indy of it's Opall glories, for a satis∣factory Done; When as the Ship of my intelligence cannot
imbarke necessaries for so long a Voyage, or how should I Rifle the Phoenix her Fragrant Cabinet to offer Per∣fumes as a gratefull Heca∣tombe? when as our Pe∣gasus Icarian wings faints in the Sunne-shine, and my Short-handed expres∣sions, cannot reach the Incense treasured on the sub∣lime Magazine. I must con∣dole my hard infortunes, or else invoke the Benigne Stars for a more favourable influence. Yet stay darling
Muse, Why so mleanchol∣ly? Here's one preserva∣tives whose Balsam Ingre∣dients will cure the mala∣dy; Here's a fortunate Or∣pheus, that by his powerfull melody will make thee return from those Stygian shades of dispaire, the pale Violet can be entertained in the same Symposie, where the Ruby Roses have their sweetest allay. The Jesamine can re∣fresh it's homely Colours, where the pure Lillies re∣soliate their Superlative beau∣ties,
and so may the Rai∣sin-tree of thy desires grow in the Felix Arabia of his breast, and consequently prove the  perfume, in which the chaste Phoenix of his goodnesse, intends to suffer expiration, though by a Pro∣methean coal she gets a second birth, as he who leaped in∣to the Sea, left his Morta∣lity behind him coming forth, animated with a new Creati∣on; the Elephant adores the Sun in rejoycing under those glorious Rayes, and I shall
pay your favours a requitall while this Dia dresseth her bra∣veries in gay smiles at the Sunshine of your Coelestiall eyes, I will not therefore spin a Web of Eulogiums, and inter∣weave it with fine threads of Hyperbolies, to praise you for those courtesies I cannot congratulate, least I should be (like the pretty Ora∣tor makeing a Panygerick in Hercules his Commendations) bafled with a Quis Unquam Vituperavit. Onely I will intreat Dame Rhetorick, to
dresse me in her gawdy attire∣ments, that I might still Ravish your Genious for more gifts of smiles, though I still Remain,
