Honour'd Countrymen,
THE chief thing which I have to say to you at present is, To beg your pardon for my telling the World, how poorly you were provided with a Ser∣mon,
 who had taken such excellent care in all things else, to the Honour and Content of your Countrymen. However you may partly thank your selves for it; since being straitned in your time, I knew not upon what occasion some of you were pleas'd to hope, That I could in 13 days provide any thing worthy your selves, or the Honour of your Assembly. It might indeed have been more both for your Credit and mine own, if I had declin'd this publick Service, till Age and Experience had added Strength to my Eloquence, and Autho∣rity to my Person: But I must confess, I took this Task upon me, out of that eagerness and fondness which I had to be publickly known and own'd as one of your Countrymen. And herein I consulted more my own Credit than yours; since 'tis more real Honour to be reckon∣ed among you, my Countrymen, than I can possibly lose in the Printing this Sermon, though it were far worse than it is. Wherefore I again intreat your pardon, and good opinion for me. Nor is it to be suppos'd, that while I am pleading for Charity and good Nature, I my self should be excluded from having any share in them. When you go on to read this Sermon, as you will find many faults and
 weaknesses in it, so you will I hope find some Arguments which may perswade you to excuse them. So that you have here a very just op∣portunity to practise what I have recommend∣ed to you. Now having said this, I take my leave of you: Beseeching Almighty God, to increase the Honour and Gallantry of your De∣sign, by continuing this Yearly and Charitable Solemnity; by furnishing our Country with Stewards as Generous as Faithful, and as Good every way as you are; And with far far better Preachers than I was:
Who am, Honour'd Countrymen,
