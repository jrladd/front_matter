OH that my counsell might become acceptable to you all, that you would breake of your offences by repentance, and your crueltyes by mercy to Gods saints and people, and that you would leave lording of it over your fellow brethren, let not the Lord when he shall come in the cloudes, finde you smiting Ieremie on the cheek, lest Pashurs portion prove your inheritance, and the Lord make you a terrour to your selvs, for know you all for a certain, that your vinyards are most ripe to the winepresse, and that the Angell wbo hath that sharp sickle in his hand, is coming forth to cutt downe all the vines of the vineyards of the earth, and to cast them into the winepresse of the wrath of almighty God, therefore let me again and again intreat you, to leave lording of it over Gods inheritance, and rob not the Kings Majesty of his maintenaunce; nor the nobility of their titles and dignityes, nor the magistrates of their power and authority, nor the subjects of their rigths and inheritances, take not the garmente from the widdow, nor the bread from the fatherles by your extortions, eate not up the Lords people like bread any longer, lest the Lord bring a plague upon you, out of which you shall not hee able to pull your necks, let the Lord Christs name be honoured and sett up in all his offices and ordinaunces on Sion his holy mountain, jussel him no longer out of his Kingly throne; lest he reckon you among his enemies, and so slay you all before him, build not up your Syon with bloods, nor your Ierusalem with crueltyes, lest you make a fruitfull land become an heap, or a desolate wildernes, think not by cruelty to suppresse Gods truth, for rather then it shall want witnesses, God wil make the stones to doe it, and so raise up witnesses out of the dust of them, whom you and your forefathers have slaine, digge no longer so deep to hide your counsells from the Lord, for the Lords knowes, and hath revealed it to his saincts; that you are no other, then the very bellowes of Antichrist, by which he blowes up and kindleth that fire of superstition and idolatrye in our English nation, therefore display no longer the coulours of Antichrist in the

Lords camp, hold no longer up the ensigne staffe of that man of sin, by which you have so long beaten the Lords people, lay down your bucklers now at the length at the Lords feete, that if it he possible you may finde mercy; oh hear, hear, and be not proud, lest your bonds increase; let not the soules of Gods saints (whom you contemne) weep anie longer in secret for your pride, be not you a means to cause the Lord to forsake his people and to suffer his people to be led away captive and to sing the songs of Sion in a strange land, and be not so in love with an Italian Lord, as for him to ingage your soules, King and coūtrye; But why doe I thus speake unto you? can a blackemoore change his skin? Not unlesse it be flead of, no more can you, unlesse the Lord change your na∣tures, and make you of wolvs, sheep, and of lyons, lambs, which the Lord in his time will either effect in you, or els will give you your portion with the beaste and the false prophet, and with all those that with you have received the marke of the beast, in their foreheads and hands. Thinke not that I aime at anie mans person, but at the unlawfullnes of your callings and standings, for my soule pittyeth your persons to see so manie excellent natu∣rall parts, which manie of you are indued withall, bewitched with those strong delusions, which the just God hath sent for the damnation of all those that receive not the love of the truth, yea the Lord knows I would be glad to become anie thing to doe you good, but of that I have little hope therfore farewell.
