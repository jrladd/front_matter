MOst indered and right vertuous Ladie, and you the rest of the right VVorshipfull these kinde Cheshiere Knights; After my long beeing at Chester, in the time of this reported trouble. I in my mellancholie walkes be thought me of the strange inuasion of Sathan, lately on the persons of Elizabeth Caldwell, and her bloody louer Iefferie Bownd, together with that vntimely actor Isabell Hall widdow, howe that vglie fiende (euer mans fatall opposite) had made practise, but I hope not purchase, of theyr corruptible liues, & brought them to the last steppe of mortall miserie. And then revoluing with my selfe, the great goodnes of God, in calling sinners to repentance, and withall, admiring his gifts in the pe∣nitent, I could no lesse then write my harts trouble, as well to pertake the world with my meditation, as to make them vvon∣der at this Cheshiere chaunce; and thereby to plant or to engraft a kinde of feare by this way of example, howe murder should heereafter beare any braine in sensible creatures, considering how the very stones shal bewray the inward thoughts of massa∣ker. All these considered, when I had coted this wonder, thin∣king how incredulous our Nation is in things true, and how vn∣certaine they are to beleeue fopperies fayned, I could no lesse for the certaintie heereof, but call you to witnesse of the proofe, because sith such an example was preferd vnto vs, that others,

not eye witnes therevnto, might the rather assure themselues of the same. First, I knowing your generall griefes for the fall of so good a Gentlewoman, and when no remedy could be, to comfort such a godly soule, aswell in her time of imprisonment as at the houre of her death, my owne occasions also for that time considered, and beeing your true and naturall Country∣man, I could doe no lesse but ostend my dutious loue to you all in this kinde, desiring you to accept my poore mite, onely considering this, the poore mans plenty is prayer to regrate your worthy loues, & as truly as I liue, that shall be no niggard; for that night wherein I lie me downe, and pray not for you all, let my rest be broad-waking slumbers, and my quiet, waking dreames; and that will be punishment more then I would en∣ioy for so regardlesse a good as I so late and so happily recea∣ued. True it is that diuers reports passed vp and downe the streets of Loudon as touching this act of murder, but how scan∣delously, as fiue murdred, three murdred by the meanes of six persons, which your VVorships know is false, only three mur∣dered one; marry the intent was to him that now liues. There∣fore being an eare-witnes to this false alarum, it made me more diligent in the setting foorth the truth, whereby GOD in his power might be knowne, sathan in his meaning no doubt ouer∣throwne, and the worlds idle fabling by a contrary meaning knowne. For as it was, it was, and no otherwise, and thus it was, as your presences both at the examination, arraignement, and execution can iustifie; and how odious it is to heare any truth rackt by slaundering tongues, iudge or imagine; onely this, pardon my boldnes, witnes the right, accept my good will in the publishing; and so I commit you to Gods protection.
