MADAME,
The noble favours I have received
from your Ladishipp have not onely made me studious to preserve a gratefull mind in my selfe, But also encoura∣ged me to vndertake these smal paines in your Ladyshipps behalfe. I know good MADA∣ME, that by your day∣ly exercise in prayer, you have atteined to a great perfection in that art: Yet with all, I know your Ladis∣hipps humilitie to be such, as you will not scorne nor disdeigne
to better your know∣ledge from the instru∣ctions of the most able, and most pious vn∣derstanding of the age in which he lived. MADAME, I pre∣sent heere vnto your Ladyshipp a Treatise of the most Reuerend Fa∣ther Iohn Fisher Bishop of Rochester, Preist & most eminent Cardinall of the holy Roman Ca∣tholike Church; as you see, MADAME, suf∣ficiently recommended hy those titles he deser∣vedly
obteined, corre∣spondent to the ver∣tues of his most holy and blessed life. My care hath onely been to render him faythfullie and for your Ladishipps benefitt, as the gravitie of the argument requi∣res, not giuing him any other ornamēt the that of truth, which I supposie makes it more agrea∣ble to your Ladyshipps vertues, and with all I desire, it may be ac∣cepted from him, who glories in nothing mo∣re
then the title of bein∣ge
MADAME,
