MOst worthy Sir, I have with pain and labour took,
To search some Histories for this little Book,
I have it all gathered from thence,
Especially things of greatest consequence;
And though the Volumn, and the Work be small,
Yet it does contain the sum of all;
To you I give it with a Heart most fervent,
And rests your humble and obedient Servant.


For Shepherd Swains they have been long
The Glory of their Land,
The best of men has been a Swain,
Behold brave Tammerlane;
Then Walter Scot now of Todrick,
Since thou'rt a Gentleman,
I'm sure thou'll not offended be,
To be call'd a Shepherds Swain;
Thy Father Thomas did the like,
Since he to Todrick came:
Thomas thy Good-sir was a Swain,
When he from Whitslade sprung:
Thy Grandsire brave Walter of Whitslade,
Was call'd the Hawk compleat,
A man of note and good report,
Yet had many Flocks of Sheep;
His Father Robert thy great Grandsir,
Of Stirches was design'd,
Because his Father Walter Scot
Liv'd at Whitslade, in his time
He was a worthy Gentleman,
And kept a great Menzie:
There was ninety years past o're his head

Before that he did die,
The rest of thy Genealogie,
I can you well declare,
They were all worthy Gentlemen;
But I will talk no mair.


To speak of Whitslades Family,
Or when it did begin,
It's above two hundred years ago,
It was in the fourteen hundred eighty seven,
VValter the first of VVhitslade then,
VVas Hardin's elder Brother,
He married a fair comely Dame,
Daughter to the Laird of Riddel;
Robert his Father did succeed,
In Heretages, Mains and Miln,
And married with one Rutherford,
Daughter to the Laird Hunthill;
His son Walter, sharp as a Hawk,
For Valour he did pass,
He married with a comely Dame,
Daughter to Cavers of Dowglas;
His son Sir Walter Scot, if I should forget,
I should be much to blame,
He married with Susanna Scot,
Daughter to the Laird of Thirlston,
And after her he married again,
Which I do know for truth,
Unto a very comely Lass,
Sister to Sir Iohn Scot of Newbrugh;
His son Robert Scot of worthy note,
Hollands Iean married he,
Natural-daughter to Walter Lord of Buckcleugh,

She was a frugal Lady.
Sir Walter Scot brother to Robert,
He married a Lady fair,
Daughter to Sir Robert Stuart of Ormstoun,
Which is Brother to Iohn Earl of Traquair;
Thomas his Brother did him succeed,
A man of worthy fame,
A vertuous Lady he did wed,
Madam Mitchel was her name.
Thomas his son doth now remain,
The eight Laird of that part,
He's married to a frugal Dame,
Daughter to Sir Iohn Hay of Park.
Thomas the last that of Whitslade we lost,
Was a man of good esteem,
He departed in the year of Grace,
Sixteen hundred and seventy one.
Sir Walter Scot his brother, that
At Innerkeithing was slain,
It was into the year of Grace,
Sixteen hundred and fifty one;
His brother Robert that bold Baron;
It was an woful hour,
At Yorks great Fight he lost his life,
In the sixteen hundred and fourty four.
Their Father brave Sir Walter Scot,
The chief of Chivalry,
In the sixteen hundred twenty eight year,
At Whitslade he did die.
Of Whislades worthy Family,
I will no further dite,
For he does know assuredly,

I can neither Read nor Write.
Ulysses was a happy man of men,
In that his acts were writ with Homer's pen;
And Virgil wrote the Actions of the glory,
Of brave AEneas and his wandring Story;
The Shepherds live, and thus they end their lives,
With good and brave and just prerogatives.
