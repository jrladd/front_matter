MOst worthy Sir, I hope I do no wrong,
In dedicating to you one of my Shepherds Swains;
Take not a Shepherd Swain to be a vulgar name,
For Kings and Emperors have gloried in the same,
Therefore no Shepherd Swain my Muse will e're deride,
And far less VVilliam Elliot the good Laird of Swoonside,
Since thou art a worthy and a lovely one,
Not like Envy, all consum'd to Skin and Bone.
Sir, I do declare what Labour thou hast spent,
VVas neither to Honour nor Vertues detriment;
And thrice worthy Sir, thy Vertues do proclaim,
How Honours noble mark it is still thy aim,
And when thou the head-strong Taurus soon forsakes,
And to his summering Progress thou haste makes,

Then shall the Earths celestial light afford,
And in sad darkness clad the ample Glob;
Since I was born, when Wit was out of Town,
That's the reason that I have so little of my own;
Pardon me, I cannot writ, and very litle read,
Or else in thy worthy praise, I further would proceed;
As for Swoonside, I wish his Golden-fleece,
May shine as bright, as Iasons did in Greece.
