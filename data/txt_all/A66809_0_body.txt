My Lords,
I Am once more ingaged to appear again in Publick, in defence of Scarbrough Spaw, which is now accused to be a dangerous Water; and what fitter Judges of this Controversie can be found out then your Lordships, who have tried it, and found it not only most Innocent, but Excel∣lent. My ultimate and highest Appeal is therefore to your Honours, since two of your Lordships do bear its Testimony within you.
As for you my Lord Annesley, though I cannot say this last of your Lordship, since you did not drink of it out of any necessity, but for company of your Noble Brother the last Summer: yet this I may say, your Lordship
had an ill share of it, if it have the faults that some have ascribed to it. And farther, your Acute Judgment and Excellent Lear∣ning wherewith you are qualified for the Highest Service of your Prince and Country when called, renders your Lordship a most competent Judge of this Subject, beyond all Imposition. And the Favourable Aspect which then both your Lordships were pleased to Grace this Discourse and its Author withal, do justly challenge this my Thankful and Publick Acknowledgment. I humbly beg of all your Lordships the Acceptance of this, in token of the great Service and Honour I owe you, for all your Noble Favours vouch∣safed to
York June 3. 1671.
My Lords,
