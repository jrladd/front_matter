SIR,
YOu being not only my Auditor and Parishioner, but also a great incourager of my studies, and a liberall con∣tributor to this poor labor of mine, do chalenge from me an especiall remembrance among the rest of my well-wishers, though I know you neither desired nor expected any nominall acknowledgement of your favour to me∣ward, but gratitude required to make you as exemplar as you are good. And none will grudge this to you but the
spirit of envy, which unwillingly makes good men happy: which happinesse may he encrease, that hath prospered you in all your enterprizes, and make it a step to eternall glory, through Jesus Christ; so praieth he that is,
SIR,
