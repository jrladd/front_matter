My Lord,
I Could be very glad that I had less Reason to justifie the publi∣shing of these Sermons, and that they were altogether as
unseasonable, as the putting out of Bills to Cure the Plague, when no Body is
Sick or Dies of it, but Treason is a Disease that
Rages amongst us, and though it be not like the
Sweating-Sickness of old, a Malady peculiar to English Men, yet the
plenty and Luxury of our Country may perhaps make us more Subject to it then others: Were I able to prescribe any thing, however ordinary, that was likely to be either a
Remedy or an An∣tidote against it, I should think it my Duty as a Lover of the Peace and Sal∣vation of Mankind, as a Lover of my King and
Country, and as a Minister of that Church and Religion, which has been often the Mark, but never the Author of any Treason; and I hope the good meaning of this Endeavour will compound for the weakness of it, and its
Honesty and Charity cover the Multitude of its Faults and
Imperfecti∣ons; I thought my self more then ordi∣narily concerned to do this when the
In∣fection
had so largely spread at our end of the Town and in my own
Parish, where two of the Conspirators that are Executed, and two others that are in the Proclamation had their last Abodes; for though this, does not like other
Con∣tagions, begin in Alleys and the Out∣parts, among the Poor and Ordinary Persons, yet the Great ones make it their Business to spread it among those, and there it settles, and there it generally breaks out. Had
these Men come to our Churches they had learnt other Prin∣ciples, then what I am afraid, they have done elsewhere; and that none may be so ma∣litious as to think we calculate our Sermons merely for the present Circumstances, as if the
Pulpit were but a kind of wea∣ther-glass, wherein the Doctrine of
O∣bedience to Governours is higher or lower according to the temperature or
Varia∣tion
of outward Affairs, I have put out a plain Sermon without any addition or alteration, that was Preacht long before the Plot, when I little thought of having any such occasion to make it publick; I thought then, and do so now, that those Obvious and Familiar things, which every one must use on that Subject, would do good; but there remained a harder part, which was to keep the good Seed I had sowed clear from the Weeds that are apt to grow up and choke it, for Treason has
stood so long, without being cut down, especially in the late Times that it has
run to seed, and scattered its Principles that will not fail to
nourish and make it grow again, and I thought the only way to
destroy it, was to pluck up those by the Rootes.
 I know, My Lord, the Subject will commend it self to your
Patronage, whose Loyalty to your Prince is so well known to all, that as it was always your vertue, so it has been sometimes your Crime; and who have so well shown your Zeal and Abhorrence of all Plots and Treasons in the late Popish one, where your Justice and Eloquence were too hard for the cunningest of
Traitors, and the Priests found your Reason out∣doe their
Infallibility; yet I should not have presumed to offer these Discourses unto your Lordships hands, who is not only so great a Judge but so great a
Master of sence and of speaking, but that I know your
Candour and Mercy is equal to your Judgment, so that what has inclined you to approve and encou∣rage me in some other things of this na∣ture,
will I question not, prompt you, at least to excuse me in this.
The Extraordinary kindness and Ci∣vility you have been pleased to show me, would require a much better Testimony of my Observance and Gratitude, then this, which is the only one I can pay at present, and therefore must beg you to ac∣cept it from, My Lord,
