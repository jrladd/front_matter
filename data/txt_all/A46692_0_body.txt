Dread Soveraigns,

IF Angels wrapt in Direfull Chains,
And Princes doom'd to servile Pains;
If a Creation lost in Waves,
And Cities sunk in Fiery Graves,
Be Treasons worth Your Royal Eye
To Glance upon, and cause to Dye,
Then Seal the Warrant, or Command
The Tyrant to Depart the Land:
For (Sin's Dominion Feeble grown)
God will Confirm and Fix Your Own.
