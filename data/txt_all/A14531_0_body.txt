VUho sowel fe¦leth
the duties,
that belong to
an honest hert,
& is any thynge
aqueinted with
those three la∣dies,
which wonderfully main∣tein
the ioyful societie of mans
lyfe, called amonges the Gre∣cians

Charites, among the la∣tines
Gratie, he can not moste
gentill maister Crumwell, but
se infinite causes, why I ought
with all force of bodie, all
strength of mynde, all alacritee
and cheerefull promptnesse of
courage, studie to gratifie you,
studie to make you beare with
one, that fayne woulde, and ne∣uer
can bee able to come out of
debte. The firste of these three
dames, is Bountifull benefi∣cence,
a ladie of louely counte∣nance,
and noble stomake, one
that alwaies longeth, still ha∣uynge
that she longeth for, al∣waies
with childe, and still de∣liuered,
alwaie profityng, and
still lustyng to profite, alwaie
helpyng some, and still desire∣full

to helpe mo. The Grekes
name hir sometyme Eurido∣mene,
whiche signifieth a large
and a plentifull giuer, somtime
Aglaia, which soundeth amon∣ges
vs gladnes, teachynge men
euen by hir name, that of dutie
benefittes oughte to bee geuen
cherefullie. The second ladie is
Thankefulnesse of minde, ne∣uer
forgettyng benefittes recei∣ued,
hir name is Thalia, whi∣che
signifieth fresshenesse or
grenenesse, because duetie and
honestie woll, all pleasures, all
benefites stil to be freshe in me∣morie,
still to bee greene, neuer
to wyther, neuer to fade, all
tyme to florishe. The thirde
ladie is Euprosine, muche lyke
hyr syer Aglaia, a damoysell

full of solace, full of delectaci∣on,
continually deuysyng, by
what meanes she may do plea∣sure
for pleasure, recompence
kyndnesse with kyndnesse. Au∣thors
of great name and much
wisedome, make these three, to
go all hande in hande, the first
lokyng still forward, not once
castyng hir eie backe, neuer im∣braydyng
benefites geuen and
past. The second and the third
euermore beholdyng the firste,
with amiable countenāce, with
faithfull eie of remembraunce,
and full intente of recompence,
as farre, as power furthered
with moste desire maie or can.
Under suche cloudes, sage and
graue writers ar wont darkely
to insinuate thynges of great

weight, thinges verie necessary
for the quiete and honeste lea∣dyng
of mans life, things wor∣thy
to be of all men imbraced
worthy to be set fixed and en∣grafted
in all mennes hertes.
They perceyued, that morall
preceptes pleasantlie set out in
feat colours of wittie phanta∣sies,
both crepe faster into our
bosomes, and also tary there
with muche more delectacion
and profite, than they would,
beyng playnly spoken. Wher∣fore
as you nowe se, what they
mente by those thre ladyes, so
you muste also nedes see, howe
I am bounde, to owe you my
herte, my seruice, with all that
they both maie dooe for you.
For howe can I, my lord your

father, beyng so far in amours
with that louely ladie Eurido∣mene,
leaue mine attendaunce
vpon thother two damoisels,
before life leaue me? How can
I, beeyng enuyronned with so
manie and ample his benefites
not desire Thalia and Euphro¦sine
that thei both report me, to
lacke power, but no good wil,
I truste they bothe shall haue
good cause so to do. Certes, if
I had sene, where either my lit∣tel
witte, or poore herte mighte
better haue serued his lordship
than in openyng vnto you his
dere and entierly beloued sōne
suche preceptes of vertue, as
maie make you moste like your
noble father, there are no pei∣e
that coulde haue kepte me

from doyng of it. Assure your
selfe, maister Crumwell, if la∣boure
and herte maie paie the
tribute, that loue oweth, you
shall neuer nede to arrest me.
This boke, was gathered by
Ludouicus Uines, a man great
lie conuersaunt in all good au∣thors,
and excellentlie wel sene
in all kindes of learnyng. The
boke hath vndoubtedly, muche
more liyng in his bosome, than
the title promiseth in the fore∣hed.
It is not onely an Intro∣duction
to wisedome, but if ye
goe as it leadeth you, it intro∣duceth
wisedom into you, roo∣tyng
the loue and desire of ver∣tue
in your hert, extirpyng frō
it all maner of vice, and all vn∣clennesse,
furnishyng you with

generall preceptes, for all kyn∣des
of life, for all ages, for all
degrees and condicions, whi∣che
preceptes, if you harbou
in your breaste, must nedes be a
great slaie, helpe, and comfort
vnto your tender age. They
shal bryng to passe many thyn∣ges
in your life time, with gret
pleasure, and no peyne at all,
which otherwise experience oft
tymes poudred with bitter re∣pentance,
shuld scace at length
teache you. It is as wise So∣crates
saieth, Preceptes of ler∣ning
were inuented at the first
as a nedefull staie and succour
vnto mans mynde, wantynge
knowlage & experience: euen as
a staffe is geuen of necessitie, to
staie vp a feeble body, assured¦ly,

I knowe no one booke vn∣translated,
that hath halfe so
many holsome documentes, as
this hath, none that mai so wel
leade you the right way to true
honour, none where ye maie
either with more delite, or more
hope of your game, trace true
nobilitie. Folowe your leader,
goe on with your guide, you
shall finde all the steppes and
grices, whereby not onely my
Lord your father, honourablie
hath climed to nobilitie, but all
other, that in dede are or were
at any time noble you shal find
manie thynges here, that maie
bee to men in wealth and wor∣ship
an ornamente, many that
ar to mē assauted with the sur∣s
of sower fortune, sure coū∣sailours,

bringyng with theim,
besides righte and honeste con∣solacion,
muche delectable do∣ctrine
finally, manie that are
a souereigne medicine almoste
for all diseases. The booke is
nowe yours, I truste as the ie∣welles,
whiche it offereth vnto
you, bee great, rare, and preci∣ouse,
that so ye wyll see theim
laied vp in place mete for suche
richesse. Locke theim fast in the
cheste of your herte, geue the
keie to remembraunce, that she
maie lette theim out, and carie
them home againe, at suche ti∣mes
as ye shall thinke conue∣nient.
If ye make these precep∣tes
yours, by vse of them, spea∣kyng
as they teache you, wor∣kynge
as they aduise you, who

shall haue more cause to reioice
of it, thā you your self? Wher∣in
can you more please my lorde
your fathers minde? What
thynge can more satisfie his de∣sire?
What greatter comforte
can come to his Lordship, than
to see you most like him in con∣dicions?
What greatter wor∣ship
to you, than to treade in
his steppes? What higher ple∣sure
to al them that loue both?
your countrey knoweth what
noble feates my lorde your fa∣ther
hath wrought by wisdom,
ladie gouernour of all vertues
who knoweth not, howe hone∣stie
maie reioice, howe trueth
and religiō may holde vp their
handes to heuen, that god hath
sent to so gracious, so prudent

and wise a prince, so good so
wise and so faithefull a coun∣sailour?
to so noble a maister,
so diligente a mynister, to so
high couragious and vertuous
a kyng, a subiecte of so noble
an herte and stomacke? I must
leaue of, I am entered into to
longe a matter for a shorte epi∣stle.
Wherfore I can no more,
but with all herte, desire god,
that it maie please hym long to
preserue noble Henry the .viii.
styll in all welthe, in all honour
to reigne ouer vs, to the setting
foorthe of goddes honour, to
the spreadynge abrode of his
glorie, to the magnifiyng of
his name in all places, longe to
preserue my lorde to the furthe∣rance
of the same. Finally, that

ye maie bee heire of his Lorde∣shippes
qualities and vertues,
as well as of his honour
and wordelie digni∣tie.
And thus our
Lorde send you
euer wel to
fare.
