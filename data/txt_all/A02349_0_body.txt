MADAME,
THE sedulitie of the emis∣saries of that Aposta∣ticke Church of Rome, who like the Pharisees of olde, did compasse Sea and Land, to make a proselyte to them-selues, should teach vs, who are Teachers of the Trueth, to bee ashamed to bee lesse iligent in a better Cause, and for a better Master. These are busilie di∣spersing their Manuels, and sowing
 their Pople and Tares (lyke that wicked Adversarie) secretlie in the LORD'S Field, to draw men from the Trueth: and why then should no wee bee busie by Voyce, and Writ also, in sowing the good Seed of th Word, to keepe Men with the Trueth This hath moved mee to pen thi COMPEND OF CONTROVER∣SIES, which the simplest may vn∣derstand clearly, the busiest-employe may peruse frequentlie, and the wea∣kest memorie may retaine easilie: for it is not vnknowne to anie, how our greater Bookes of Controversies, penned by their graue and godlie Au∣thors, are neglected for the most part, and thought a tedious Taske, once to reade over: but as for this, each on (who hath but the least care to know or byde by the Trueth) may count i but an easie exercise, there-by to re¦create them-selues at anie occasiona vacancie. And therefore I haue here in put GOD'S Sword chiefelie i
 Man's hand, to maintaine GOD'S Cause, and contented with the most selected places onlie in each head of Doctrine; which for the solide secu∣ring of the Conscience, in the know∣ledge of the Trueth, and powerfull convincing of seducing Errour, as the Gleanings of Ephraim were better than the Vintage of Abie∣zer; so are these few smooth Stones, taken out of the Brooke of the Booke of GOD, more fit for the little Davids of the LORD'S People, to sling against the fore-head of brag∣ging and blaspemous Errour, than Saul's vnwealdie Armour, or the wearisome weight of cunning forged reasons, and hudge heape of humane testimonies.
And yet, lest that Antiquitie (where-of Babel's brood causeleslie braggeth) should seeme al-together eyther neglected by vs, or not to make for vs, I haue joyned some testimo∣nies of Fathers, that are clearest
 for vnderstanding, shortest for me∣morie, most punctuall for convincing, and a few of manie, to avoyde te∣diousnesse.
Where-vnto is at last added, for the full triumph of Trueth, the cleare Confession of our Adversare Partie; that so out of his owne mouth, the wicked servant may bee condemned, and it may be seene what is the force of prevailing Trueth, even our Enemies being Iudges. And so in summe, that there is no point of Papall doctrine, but that First, it is against Scripture: Secondlie, contrarie to the fayth of the primi∣tiue Church: and Last, taught, and acknowledged with vs, by the Do∣ctors in the Romane Church it selfe, farre other-wyse than the Ie∣suits now anie-where professe: such is their bragging of Vnitie, or ra∣ther the confusion of the speach of those builders of Babell.
Which paines of mine heere-in,
 for the profit of others, I haue hūbly dedicated to your religious honour, whome all the godlie who knoweth you, as a Patterne of zeale, and con∣stancie, affecteth dearlie, praysetb truelie, admireth justlie, honoureth deservedlie, prayeth for earnestlie, and thanketh the LORD for his rare Graces bestowed vpon you vnfeigned∣lie, to the great good of his Church, and your eternall glorie. Where-with also mine heartliest apprecations shal joyntlie concurre, that the bountifull hand of that good GOD, whome in the zeale of His Trueth, ye haue con∣stantlie followed, may beape vpon your honour, your most noble, and he∣roicke Husband, and that happie off∣spring of those hopefull Oliue Plants, which the Lord hath givē vnto you, all the blessings what-so-ever, that ei∣ther Heaven can afford, or mortalitie may bee capable of.
