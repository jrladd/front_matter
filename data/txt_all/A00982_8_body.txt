THe primier Worthies, which we Worthies cal,
Were worthy, three for godly exhortation
(Iosua, Dauid, Macchabeus): and all
The other sixe for valours imitation.
Nine worthies more behold; eight Kings, a Prince,
Yong, Tender, Sweete, Great Britaines hopefull Ioy:
Who will in time his fathers Foes conuince,
And worthy prooue, as Hector was of Troy.
Then eighteen Worthies, with the Prince of Britain,
This booke doth note: Loe here their stories written.
