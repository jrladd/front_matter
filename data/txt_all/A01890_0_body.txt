WIse Counsellours (great Lord) as Sages say,
Haue three faire Markes to make their best blest aime;
First, Gods due glory; next, their Princes Fame;
Lastly, to be their Countries Staffe and Stay.


God His exacts; by whom, they're first elected:
Kings, Theirs expect; vnder whom they haue Grace:
States, Hence their Fates extract; for whom that Place
They exercise, to see them safe protected.



How well your Lordship hits this triple-White,
How well your Worth's approu'd to God and Man,
Your God, your King, your Countrey witnesse can,
Whose Goodnesse, Grauenesse, Greatnesse, All delight.


Your Goodnesse to your God, your Faith makes knowne,
Your Grauenesse to your King, your Wisedome showes;
Your Greatnesse to the State, in Vertue flowes;
Faith, Wisedome, Worth, combin'd, conioynd in One.


A faire Paire-Royall in a Loyall Peere,
Whom Heauen hath happifi'd for's Piety,
Whom his great King loues for his Loyaltyâ–ª
Whom all his Countrey, iustly, holds most deere.


O, may this three-fold Twist be ne're vntwin'd;
May Piety your Pilot euer bee:
O, may your Prince your Prudence euer see;
Long may your Countrey your good Counsaile finde.


That as you GOD, GOD may you euer houour;
That as you grace your King, your King may grace you;
That as you fight vnder Faiths blessed Banner;
Your God, your King, your Countrey may embrace you:
His humble Heart and Voice, this sayes, thus prayes;
Who in his Prayers, his Best, doth rest alwayes.
