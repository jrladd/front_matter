Worthy Sir,
IT is well known that, that fa∣mous Lacedemonian Legi∣slator, would not establish (a∣mong all others) a Law against Ingratitude, Quòd prodigiosa res esset, benificium non repen∣dere, and of all ingenious spirits, it was ever accounted monstrous, to make slight of favours, and easily forget Pristine benefits; for neg∣lect of favours, makes all favour void, and should I come under this sensure, by my dis-ingenuous and impolite carriage, I might from you justly incur the ignomi∣nious
 title of an ingrateful person: Your complicated kindnesses con∣ferred upon me, do perpetually ob∣lige me, whilst not being capable of sutable returns, yet to publish my humble acknowledgements of them, and if the Laws of God and Nature injoyne and require the homage of due respects to be given unto our earthly Parents, I know no Reason or Law which ex∣empts from attributing the like to our Spiritual. It was the saying of Alexander, that as we have our being from our Parents, we have our well being from our instructors, and if he could esteem himself happy for terrene knowledge, how much more then ought I for that Divine, in which you have been my Teacher; and if that earthy knowledge may so much conduce to a well being here, what will Celestial Science do, but safely
 carry the Soul to an everlasting Weal, a happy being, which never knows end to terminate its satiate∣ing and abounding comforts. Sir, I shall not blush to own, or be ti∣merous to declare, that (which I know to you, is matter of joy) al∣though I have had many Instru∣ctors) you are he that has begotten me unto Christ; and I may truly call you, as Cyprian did Cecilius, Vitae novae patrem, your sweet invitations and divine Rhetorick (being accompanied with the bles∣sed influences of Heaven) drew me out of the Womb of this world, and from the power of Satan, into the gracious imbraces of the Lord Jesus, it was eternally the design of the Father, but you were the Instrument (by the Word and Spirit) in time to call me home to Christ. Moreover, you did not only beget me to a second birth,
 but also constantly entertained me with those heavenly dainties, with which Christ does nourish his be∣loved ones. But to add to these the remembrance of your private instructions and care for me, are not to be obliterated by Times swift Motion, or Diurnal vicissi∣tudes and mutations. But Sir, as an addition to the former fa∣vours, I have here presumed to prefix your Name, and make a-Dedication of this little Treatise to your self, not for your Instru∣ction, but a manifestation of my submissive respects due to you.
I know that I have here ex∣posed my self and labours to the view of no less a censuring, than a sinning Generation, therefore by your favourable Aspect, it may in some measure abate (if not al∣together prevent) the hard speech∣es of a calumniating world. It is
 too perspicuous that our Age a∣bounds with such, who study more to carpe at, than gather the sweet fruits of the Gospel; but Momo satisfacere, would be an endless work; therefore, if I can but ex∣alt the Lord Jesus, and help im∣mortal Souls to glory. I shall not value the foul aspersions of a dirty World, for in this Generation, there are such, who will not spare the tallest Cedars in the Lebanon of God, much less the lowest shrubs. Therefore, I will not fondly pro∣mise my self better entertainment then Christ and his Apostles, and his faithful Labourers have ever met with. Neither do I so much address my self unto you, to shroud me from the frowns, or hereby to silence the perverse sayings of Men, as that I would study to declare my gratitude, in humble acknowledgements, and thankful
 returns, like gliding streams, that swiftly move toward the abounding Ocean, from whence their origi∣nal sprang. I am not ignorant that the world is copiously furnish∣ed with Books, yet these Muti Magistri (as Alphonsus called them) are not totally in vain, for I have extracted benefit from some of them, which I hope others may do from this. I have ad∣ventured to cast my might into the Treasury, and my grain into the field, leaving the increase unto God. This Book I may call my Primitiee, for when the Lord first called me forth to publish the Gospel, he sent me with this Message, to call and invite Sin∣ners unto Christ, which found entertainment with some then, wherefore it gives me some mat∣ter of encouragement that it will not prove now as water spilt upon
 the ground. I was unwilling for a time to suffer it to see the light, being conscious of my own defecti∣ons and imperfections, but at last being prevailed with by some, and having it long by me, I was wil∣ling to send it forth into the world, although not invested with splen∣did cloathing of rhetorical Phra∣ses, yet I trust (like pure Gold) it will bear the Touchstone of Di∣vine verity, and so prove for the advancement of Gods glory, the exaltation of the Lord Jesus, and the Salvation of immortal Souls. All which I am certain are the ardent desires of your Soul, and that these may receive a gracious answer, with all true prosperity to you and yours, shall be the sincere and constant requests of him who will for ever acknowledge, a firm obligation to subscribe himself,
SIR,
