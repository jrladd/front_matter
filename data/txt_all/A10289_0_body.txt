GOOD Madam, it hath not proceeded of anie vndutifull forget∣fulnes, that I haue not before this time testified my most dutiful deuo∣tion towards your Ladiship. No man can cary a more thankful remēbrance of your great kindnes and vndeserued bounties; and indeede it is the onelie thing I am able to perform. These poore exercises presume not to supplie this want of better abilitie, onely they come vnto your La. to present you with a little scantlin of the greatnes of my du∣tiful affection, and desire to accomplish some grea∣ter things more woorthie of your most Christian vertues. It may please your La. to accept of them: a better measure of knowledge may haply bring foorth more acceptable matter heerafter. If this pamphlet shall content your La. I hope others to whose view I haue in respect of my bounden dutie towards you made the same subiect, will not ouer∣curiously censure my poor endeuors, but giue them such construction as I am willing to deserue, al∣though I cannot performe that which I earnestly desire. And thus I commend your good La. to the mercifull protection of the Almightie.
