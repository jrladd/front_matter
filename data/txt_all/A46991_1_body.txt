RIght Reverend Father, the sweet refresh∣ing your Honourable Favours did yield to such of my labours as hitherto enjoy the light, when a suddain uncomfortable blast had sorely nipt them in the very setting, makes these last gatherings of that spring seek that comfortable warmth under your benigne Protection, which the uncon∣stant frowning season would hardly afford them in their growth. Besides these and other my personal Obligements, that Famous and worthy Founder of this Attick Bee-hive (of whose sweetness would God I had been as capable as I have been long partaker) had never allotted any Cell there∣in for me or other Countryman of mine, but with particu∣lar relation to that seat of dignity, which he sometimes did, r Lordship now doth, and, to the encrease of Gods glo∣ good of his Church, long may enjoy. Seeing this our  Foster-Father is now ignorant of his childrens de∣, and knows not me; it shall be my comfort, to have  honourable successors witnesses of my care and industry

to fulfil his godly desire, whose religious soul in his life time (as his written Laws do testifie) did detest nothing more then idleness in the Ministry, specially in his adopted-Sons. The matters I here present unto your Lordships and the worlds view, are sometimes in themselves so harsh and hard to be concocted, as he that would strive to make them tooth∣some unto nice tastes, should put himself to excessive pains; unless his judgement be much riper, his wit readier, his inventi∣on pleasanter, his opportunities better, and his leisure greater then mine are. But it is one and the same point of judge∣ment, not to require exact Mathematical proofs in discour∣ses of mortality, or a smooth facile Rhetorical stile in Logi∣cal or Scholastick conflicts. And, as by the Statutes of that Society wherein I live, I am bound to avoid barbarisme: so my particular inclination moves me, in controversies especial∣ly to approve his choise that said; Fortia mallem quam for∣mosa. If any professed enemy to the truth we teach, will an∣swer me from point to point, or attempt (not as their custom now is onely in scoffing sort but seriously) to avert those un∣supportable, but deserved imputations, I lay upon the foun∣dation of his Religion, I shall (I trust) be able to answer him; the better by continuance of your Lordships wonted fa∣vours, whom I still request the Christian Readers, as many as reap any profit from my pains on my behalf to remember with such respect as is due to Honourable Patrons of religi∣ous studies, or cherishers of painful endeavours in good cau∣ses. From Corpus Christi Colledge, March 25. 1614.
