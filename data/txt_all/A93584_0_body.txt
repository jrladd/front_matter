SIR,
I Here present un∣to you, the pain∣full delivery of a long travaile; I hope you wil hold my bold∣nesse excused, that I have presumed to send it forth in∣to the World under your Name; as that also you
will bee pleased to accept this as a tribute, of the Af∣fection and Ingagements, due unto you from me, for those many Favours I have received of you, and which still oblige me to remain.
