SIR,
I Here present to You a Gentleman very consider∣able in his Extraction, but unfortunate under his present

Circumstances; who, after having, in vain, sought for Relief among his Country-Men, whom he served to the prejudice both of his Honour and Estate, has now taken a Resolution to try his Fortune once more in England. The Character wherewith You have been lately dignify'd by the Metropolis of this Kingdom, is an ample Testimony of what share this Noble City bears in Your happy Success in wea∣thering the late Storm raised a∣gainst You, and Your Splen∣did Appearance in this Station, (beyond what was ever pre∣tended to by any of Your Pre∣decessors) but above all, Your

Noble Mind in Relieving those in Distress, as it sufficiently justifies their choice, so it en∣titles You in a most peculiar manner to the Protection of a Gentleman, groaning under the weight of Affliction. True Generosity is like a large Ri∣ver, which sending forth its Branches into the circumjacent Countries, renders them Fruit∣ful and pleasant.
'Tis true, Vertue is its own Reward, and a Man truely Vertuous, will scarce ever make the Popular Ap∣plause, the Standard of his Actions, but it is also undeni∣able,

that there are certain Vertues, such as Succouring the Unfortunate, Relieving those in Distress, and affording sea∣sonable Food to such as labour under heavy Afflictions, which as they tend to the general Benefit of Mankind; so they ought not to be bereaved of their due Praises, but to be made Conspicuous in their best Lustre, to excite in o∣thers a most commendable Emulation of doing Good. Of this we have seen the happy Effects in Your own Person, Your Bounty and Charity towards so many Prisoners in Distress, has had

so powerful an Influence up∣on others, as to serve them for an encouragement to follow Your Noble Example. This happy Influence is so far from being confined within the Bounds of this Nation, that it has extended its Effects to our neighbouring Kingdoms and States. The Worthy Magi∣strates of Dublin are amongst the number of those, who being stirr'd up by Your generous Example, have endeavour'd to follow Your Foot-steps in Releasing a good Number of Prisoners of that City; and who knows but it may have some good Effect upon the mi∣serable

in France, since the Fame thereof has pass'd thi∣ther, has penetrated the Walls of the Bastile, and reach'd the Ears of those under the closest Confinement there.
It is this, SIR, which has encouraged our Gentleman in Distress, to Court Your Patronage, in hopes, that Your favourable Acceptance of what he offers to Your Protection, may at least prove a seasonable Comfort to him in the Extremity of his Affli∣ctions, since by his ill Desti∣ny, by the Remoteness of the Place, but above all, by the

severity of those for whom he had Sacrificed all, he is bereaved of that Relief which he might reasonably expect from the more happy Consti∣tution of our Government, and from the Generosity of such a Patron as Your Self, I cannot but promise my self a favourable acceptance from Your Generosity, which has been so universal, as not to be comprehended within the narrow compass of an Epistle, which obliges me to Acquiesce with an intire confidence in Your Protection which next to a hearty wish for Your everlasting Prosperity, is the

most fervent Desire, and highest Ambition of him who Subscribes himself,
Honoured SIR,
