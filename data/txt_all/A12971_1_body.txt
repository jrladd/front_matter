HAuing dedicated this litle Booke to the Right Hon. the Lord high Admirall of England, to whom the gouernement of sea causes next vnder her Maiestie chiefly appertaineth (with whom also it hath found such fauourable ac∣ceptation as of so honorable a per∣sonage might be iustly expected) I thought it meete in the next place to commend the same to your Wor. societie also, as to them who haue best occasion in your so manifold nauigations to make most plentifull and sufficient triall thereof, and to whom it may assuredly doe most necessary and profitable seruice. But least you should stand in doubt of this my commendation, the Right Honourable Count Maurice, Lord high Admirall of the vnited Prouinces of the Low Countries, hath not only commended the same to all Masters of ships and their companies (or brother∣hoods as we may call them) that are vnder his iurisdicti∣on; but hath also commanded them to make diligent and continuall obseruation in all their voyages, according to the directions prescribed herein. He also, as not content that the fruit which may spring here of should be conteined within the narrow boundes and compasse of the Lowe Countries, hath caused this booke to be translated into the

French and Latine tongues: endeuouring as it may seeme hereby to make the same knowen to all nations in Chri∣stendome. Amongst whom as the Latine translatour M. Hugo de Groot hath chosen the Venctians for their excellencie in Nauigation (as he conceiueth) to whom he might especially dedicate this small Volume togither with his owne labour in translating the same: So I thought it meete to make choise of your worshipfull socie∣ty, whom I take to be nothing at all inferiour to the Vene∣tians either for excellencie of skill, or for vse and experi∣ence in that facultie: and to whom I may more iustly com∣mend this little Booke, euen almost with the same words which Hugo de Groot vseth to the Venetians as fol∣loweth.
Therefore that we may enter a little more deepely in∣to the matter, Aristotle the wittiest of all philosophers and the most famous Lawyers doe witnesse that all arts were founde, out of the necessitie of mans nature, that what is wanting in one, might be supplied by that which is abounding in another: and that because euery countrey yeeldeth not all things, there might be a mutual exchange of one thing for another by way of merchandise. But now because diuerse countries are very far distant each from other, that there can be no carriage of any wares or mar∣chandise from the one to the other, either on beasts backs or in cartes: the art of Nauigation was therefore inuen∣ted, that the sea might supply the want of dry land. Yet surely skilfull nature hath done all this in vaine, if a cer∣taine way how to sayle cannot in some sort be found, but that mariners must be constrained to make their voyages doubtfully not knowing what course to keepe. Therefore

the ancient nauigators (thinking not without cause that there was great affinitie betweene Astronomie and Na∣uigation) directed all their course by the starres, the Si∣donians by the lesser beare which is the certainer, the Gre∣cians by the greater which is the clearer. But because nei∣ther star truely shewed the North part of the world, they were oftentimes deceiued in their coniectures: and be∣cause the night is not alwayes so cleare that those starres may be seene, if the skie were at any time ouercast they had no meanes wherby they might know which way they ought to guide themselues. Hereof it commeth that in ancient authors oftentimes, & in many places we see the mariners complaining of the darknesse of the nights, and that the greatest and most famous nauies haue beene dis∣persed and discomfited, by reason of the vncertaintie of these things.
But assuredly it seemeth to be so ordeined by nature, that all things should not be brought to light at one time: but that after a long continuance of times the certaintie of things should be knowen. There is a stone which for the exceeding great strength thereof is called Herculeus, that is the stone of Hercules, & because it draweth iron vnto it, is by the Grecians called , cōmonly it is cal∣led by the name of him that first found it, Magnes, that is the Magnete or Load-stone. For it appeareth out of Ni∣cander and Plinie, that one Magnes found it sticking to a sharpe pointed piece of yron. After a great number of yeeres a new propertie of that stone was reueiled, that be∣ing rubbed vpon yron, or rather vpon steele, it would make the same point to the North. Therefore when by this marueilous pointing the mariners knew the North,

and ouer against it the South, and making account by the eleuation of the pole they learned also the latitude: then they had (as it was thought) means sufficient of infallible direction how to guide thēselues at all times. But neither did this ioy (as many times it commeth to passe) continue long. For when they sayled from the East westwards, the Loadstone was found by litle and litle to decline from the North; which thing strooke no small doubtfulnesse and vncertaintie into the mariners mindes. Yet nowe at the length, by long obseruation of the declinations of the load∣stone that haue bene diligently sought out in diuerse pla∣ces and times, the matter is brought to that issue, that they which are most skilfull in the Mathematicks, and amongst them the said Count Maurice of Nassau, haue supposed that this declination of the Loadstone happeneth not by chance, but is caused by some certaine reason in na∣ture, that according to the varietie of places the pointing of the needle should also varie.
Wherefore the said Count Maurice sent this exhor∣tatorie iniunction (for so I may call this litle booke writ∣ten by his Mathematician Steuinius) to them that take charge of ships, that if these things were not found in all points to be so as his obseruation importeth, they should do so much as in them lay, that out of diuerse experiments some certaine reason and rule of the variation might be gathered: which if it may by diligent obseruation be obtei∣ned, then there shall not onely be a more certaine way to knowe the course from place to place by the instrument made to finde the variation (of which way more shall be spoken in the booke it selfe) but the longitude also, or ra∣ther the effect of the longitude shall be giuen by the varia∣tion;

which thing also shalbe shewed more at large in the Treatise it selfe following. Because therefore it is cer∣taine that this knowledge cannot otherwise be found but by the experiments of diuers men compared togither, and that by diuers obseruations a more easie way may be pre∣pared for science (which from the particulars ariseth vp vnto the vniuersall) I thought good to present vnto you this iniunction of the worthy Count Maurice, that if you (which are most expert in Nauigation) be of opinion that there may be so great profite of this matter as we (which thinke it to appertaine to the principall state of the com∣mon-wealth) you might doe your best endeuour vnto what place soeuer you shall come (taking with you needfull in∣struments for that purpose) to obserue diligently the va∣riation of the magneticall needle, that at length we may come to that certaintie, that they which take charge of ships may know in their nauigations to what latitude and to what variation (which shall serue in stead of the longi∣tude not yet found) they ought to bring themselues, that by this meanes they may assuredly finde what place soeuer they will in the midst of the maine Ocean sea. And al∣though this bee the end for which principally this Booke was made, notwithstanding we make no doubt that there may many more be found no lesse profitable then this; of which sort is that which wee of late haue found, which may also be of very great profit vnto vs: To wit, that when any nauie (for which cause our common-wealth hath obteyned exceeding great renowne) is prepared a∣gainst the enemie, a certaine place may be appointed in the midst of the sea, into which (if perchance too great a force should come vpon them vnlooked for) all the ships

after a certaine time might assemble themselues. Where∣to I may also adioyne a third vse of the variation, that is, the reforming of many errors which must needes be in the ordinarie sea-charts, because the coasts of all countries and the courses from place to place, haue beene set downe in them by direction of the varying compasse, without a∣batemēt or allowance answerable to the variation; wher∣of there must needes follow much deformitie and confu∣sion in many parts of the chart, especially where the va∣riation is great, as it is vpon the coast of Newfound∣land; where the variation being two whole points of the compasse (as it is reported) there must needes be so much error also in laying out all the sea coast of that countrey, and in the courses of all places neere adioyning in the or∣dinarie sea charts. All which errors may be amended, if the variations be first truely obserued, and then abated from, or allowed to the courses of all places, as neede shall require.
But the variation cannot serue to so great vse as other∣wise it might, except other errors also aswell in the chart, as in other instruments and meanes of nauigation be also auoyded. For the chart as it hath beene hitherto gene∣rally made with right-lined rumbes and degrees of lati∣tude euery where equall, must needes be very erroneous, especially in the Northerne parts thereof, that although all the foresaid errors arising by the variation were cor∣rected, yet for this cause onely you may bee deceiued one, two, yea three whole points of the compasse, in the courses of many places: and in measuring the distance you may erre one halfe, yea three quarters and more sometimes, accounting the same to be twise, yea thrise greater then

indeede it is, especially in farre Northerly nauigations. If therefore these so notorious errors be not also amended, the correction of the errors arising by the variation, can∣not be to so great purpose as otherwise it might.
Neither can that be so fully performed which in the Treatise following is chiefly intended (that is, to find any place at sea by the variation and latitude) ex∣cept the meanes that haue beene vsed for finding the la∣titude be also amended. For in obseruing the heigth of the sunne and starres, with the small crosse-staues which are most vsuall for that purpose, there may be error of halfe a degree, and more sometimes by neglect of the pa∣rallax or eccentricity of the obseruers eye. The Regiments or Tables of declination of the sunne that haue bene most commonly vsed by English mariners doe erre oft times ten, eleuen, or twelue minutes. The rule of allowances and abatements to be added to, or subtracted from the heigth of the pole-starre for finding the heigth of the pole (being grounded vpon a false position, to wit, that the pole-starre is three degrees and an halfe distant from the pole, when indeede it is almost 40 minutes lesse) must needes be false many times more then halfe a degree.
The declinations of the principall fixed starres as they are set downe in the bookes of Nauigation, that haue bene heretofore published, are for the most part erroneous; ma∣ny of them differing from trueth aboue halfe a degree, & some of them an whole degree, yea two whole degrees and more. All which imperfections of so excellent an art, I haue since the time of my first employment at sea (now more then tenne yeeres since) by diligent search with no small labour discouered and amended, not onely by tenne

whole moneths experience at sea, but also by often and di∣ligent obseruation on land, as it may more at large appeare in my booke of errors in Nauigation (which at mine own charges is also published for the common good of you all) wherein the way is shewed how your charts and crosse∣staues may be freed from the errors aforesaid; and the de∣clinations of the sunne and fixed starres are set foorth vn∣to you, agreeably to the trueth of the heauens found out by often and exact obseruations, whereby the latitudes of places may be found much more truely then hath beene accustomed. This Booke therefore, because it may affoord needfull ayd for accomplishing the sayd renowmed Count Maurice his desire in finding the latitude more exactly, and may also deliuer you from much inconuenience and daunger, which may necessarily be expected to follow out of so many and notable errors as hitherto haue beene in the vsuall meanes of Nauigation alreadie mentioned: I commend the same togither with this small Treatise now following vnto you all, to be dayly tried and examined by the touchstone of your long and skilfull experience at sea: nothing doubting but as they haue endured the more ex∣quisite triall of exact obseruation, and Geometricall de∣monstration both by seamen and landmen on shore, so they shall be found agreeable to the heedefull experiments of all skilfull Nauigators at sea. And so with my whole heart commending you all to him whose worde both seas and windes obey, I end.
