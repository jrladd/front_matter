MY honoured Lords, it is a true saying, that Conscientia est mille testes, which sen∣tence makes me confident, because I know the vprightnes of my heart to God, and faithfull and obedient loyalty vnto my King, and loue to you the honourable Peeres and Princes of the State, toge∣ther with my honest zeale vnto my coun∣tries benefit, is, in the presence of heauens Maiestie testified by a thousand witnesses, and therefore in the iustice of my hopes re∣solue, I haue aduentured, vnto your honours to dedicate this lit∣tle booke, and in the clearenes of my consciencs, I cannot but ex∣pect a kind acceptance at your Lordships hands.
The last vntimely fruit, which by a publicke print I rashly published▪ gaue iust occasion to procure your dislike: and my a∣misse there in, was greater, then at first I could conceiue, for it is an euill not to be borne with, when the greatest (much more, when so meane a subiect as my selfe) shall dare to call in qresti∣on, things formerly determined, by the iustice of the Law, iudg∣ment of the honoured Peeres, and prudent wisedome of a king∣domes most honourable Councellers: and too high doth their

presumption clime (especially in a cause of so great consequence▪) whose words would seeme as if they did desire, so to extenuate an offence, as that in respect of the offendor, opinion should bee taught, eyther to taxe the Lawe with crueltie, or the State with inhumanity: he therefore whose actions shall but beare a shew, as if they were directed vnto some such purpose, iustly deserueth to be punnished. And yet may it please your Honours; I must needes confesse, my punnishment was compounded of an absolute Lenitie, without (in the least sort) beeing mixt with any appa∣rance of Seueritie:  as I am in this respect, bound vnto you all (my Lords) so principally my thanks must humbly runne, vn∣to the Right Honorable the Earle of Salisbury, by whose loue and bountie, my cause was fauourably censured, my liberty procured, and my wants relieued. Concerning the worthinesse of whose euer honourable disposition, I would largely speake, but that I know; true honoured vertue, whose euer constant wis∣dome, and approued Iudgement, laboureth to performe each vertuous and well commended office, so as it cannot, but by a certaine kinde of supreame excellence, worthily deserue worlds praise, yet will it not indure to heare it selfe praised.
As iust cause there is, so now I doe reioyce to see, that Mars and Mercurie, are in Coniunction ioyned, the powerfull Venus, Lady of that house, and mightie Iupiter, with kinde Apect, Predominate: Maiestie, Honour, Wisdome, loue, and wisdomes gouernment, haue wrought a happie worke, vnto them all, be still continued and increast, the glory of each best esteemed happinesse. And that Emperiall greatest vnion ma∣ker, whose prudent iudgement, laboureth in peace for to vnite, great Brittons Monarchie, in him, and in his Royall line, shall most Princely and potent Monarches be establishd, by  Empires and Kingdomes, shall bee vnto their Christ vnite Conquest and Triumph, shall for euer waite vpon the Regall Scepter of their awfull gouernment, Oh let the loue of all good Subiects, vnto them remaine as constant, as they are constantly of heauen beloued.
In this little worke which I haue called, Times Anotomie, (the first part wherof was finisht by me almost two years since) I doe with a religious anger chid, the violont, and pre∣sumptious rage of vnrul'd abuses, because I greeue to see the grosse impieties which our time commits; breeely therefore, I haue Anotomis'd those euills which do assct the world, And in the prosses of my bookes discorse, my reprehentions, may par∣aduenture be accounted round, and sharpe. But Cosiue vseth not to be applied vnto the slesh that is sound, and where it hath no power to toch, it procures no smar, and therefore cannot be offensiue vnto you my Lords, whose iudgement, wisdome, vertue, and Iustice, alwaies bouded n the most honorable life of vstained vprightnesse, labreth by all meanes pssible to purge our land from those iniquities, against which my poore and vnrespcted words complaine. But when they shall from your perfection passe, vnto the generall, much disordred mul∣titude, where imperfection swelles with misdemeaners sure∣ting▪ if the it be there chance to light vppon an ill compoun∣ded outside closed vp vlser, whose vnseene hollownesse in it selfe containes,  payson of some grosse corruptions Coare, there let them sinke and worke, and purge, and by the rootes pluck vp that which puts done the race of man; from heauens eternal most glorious and vncompared felicity.
Some litle part of my most pih-lesse worke is drawne from obseruation Philosophicall, the rightly termed Agar. seruant to Saray, ad hand-made to diuinity; for signes of times and seasons,  the starres created, and sonne and moone were made times gouernors: all which do by a speciall influence vn∣to time, presage times future accedents, and doe prescribe right well opproued, and most worthily commended documents, so far forth as the al pourful Maisty of the Creator, be not tyed to the  included in the Creature, and what in this case I hau breifly specified, I hope my pen hath vsed such modera∣tion, a that no word in this vnworthy worke shalbe offensiue to your honored wisdomes.
Against the Sea, and seate of Blasphemy, I do (in this my writing) most desire with greatest force to beare y selfe be∣cause

from Rome, that cursed Babilon, proceeds each ell∣borne dangerous mischiefe, by which our King and State is, ( alwayes hath beene) menaced: I haue therefore directly poin∣ted, a the approued neerenesse of proud Romes destruction, farther shewing, that both Gog, and Magog, shall be  extinct, and vtterly caste out, by the wrathfull furie of a mer∣cilesse confusion, and haue briefly giuen an Index vnto the man∣ner how, this mightie worke shall be accomplished, grounding the truth of my discription, vpon obseruations grounded on holy Writ, that most Sacred and Diuine authoritie. And though that in a plaine and moderne verse, I haue describde the waigh∣tie Accedents of Time: yet if your Honors will vouchsafe to read, I hope you shall finde me much to differ, from an idle Poet vsuall course▪ for without hauing respect to a vaine varietie of words, or painted circumstance, I haue onely applyed my inde∣uours, vnto the effectuall life, and materiall Substance, of that which I desire to describe.
Though time receiues disturbance, by some, neither valiant, wise, nor honest, but in their hearts, no lesse then State distur∣bing Catalines, for Libellers are meerly such, whose thoughts be in themselues rebellions, and actions tend vnto rebellion, but in despight of them, and treasons treacherie, God will bring his purposes to passe, by the instrumentall meanes of Humane go∣uernment, and Britton shall (as now it is) by a prudent wisdome, iudgement, and prouidence, be for euer vprightly gouerned.
Thus may it please your Honours, I haue once more aduen∣tured, by my vnworthy (and yet well meaning) Pen, not to pre∣sent this booke alone, but therewith to dedicate my poore and vnrespected selfe vnto your Lordships: and though my labours doe neuer chance to meet with the approbation of this sentence, , yet I hope my now indeuours shall not make me say, Solabaratis, contraria Fata repen∣dens, for my labour doth but desire to liue, to the end my liues imploiments may wholy be deuoted to my countries benefis. But, vnto that all powerfull prouidence, which holdes the hearts of Kings within his hand, do I commit my hopes, and you my Lords to heauens eternall happinesse
