THE fame (right honora∣ble) of your magnanimous and he∣roical minde, togither with the pre∣sent accident of your reported pur∣pose, in traueling beyond the seas, hath imboldened mee to present your Lordshippe with this treatise of the Estate and Description of Germanie: the which (peraduenture) may serue your honor in some steade, for discerning the seuerall partes of Germany with their scituations.
The worke (I confesse) was not of mine owne colle∣ction: but the one parte I receiued in Italian, the other in Latine, both collected by men of great woorth, af∣ter that they had beene much imployed in forraine Landes, about their Princes seruice. And now hauing

ioyned both togither, and clad them in English attire, I humblye craue your Lordshipps patronage to priui∣lege these new pilgrims against their peeu persecu∣tors: Which, yf you shall vouchsafe to graunt, your honors Bongre shall be as a bulvvarke vnexpugnable to fafegarde this booke: and your acceptable allovving hereof, shall encourage me, not onely to be readie to celebrate your name, most vvorthy of your pro∣genitors, by dedication of greater vvorkes hereafter: but I vvill also be ready to deuote my vvhole skill, seruice and life to bee at your Lord-ships com∣maund.
