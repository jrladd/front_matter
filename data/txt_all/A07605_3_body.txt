HAuing Right worthy Gentlemen, for∣merly made knowne to euery of you: by such simple remembrances as my power could aford, how much I desire & day∣ly studie in perticuler to serue & ho∣nor you: I thought it now not amisse, treating of one argument comd of the same kindred, & deriued from the general obseruations which euery where with profit in these three first bookes are to be gathered, thus ioyntly to you all to perticipate this common good: For if the vse which euery one ought arightly to make in the reading of Histories, be grounded chiefely in the electi∣on of taking, or leauing, the better, or worse, of such things as by examples are faithfully propounded: which vpon occasion should be applied either to the well gouerning of a priuate life, or to the inabling of our vnderstanding for counsell in our countries seruice: In either part I say I know none, (of many who haue had these Turkish affaires with the perpetuall feli∣citie in consideration) to whome with more credit a man may giue beleefe, then to Hubert Folieta the Genuoys, whilst with much wisedome, grauitie, and discreation, he handleth though briefely, the causes of the greatnesse of the Turkish Empire, to his deere friend the famous Captaine Marcus Antonius Columna. A treatise I suppose to euery conceauing man, or such whome the care of a common good doth possesse very ac∣ceptably.

This same therfore for the former alleged reasōs, haue I heere annexed▪ so faithfully as I could persuade the nice Ita∣lian tongue to speake our proper language. To which I haue fur∣ther added, (that the occasion of this discourse might the bet∣ter be apparant,) the narration of the war of Ciprus, held be∣twixt the Turk and Venetians, some xxx. yeeres agoe. In which their wars, the Venetiās being excedingly ouerborne, (notwith∣standing that notable victorie obtained by them and their con∣federates in the Gulfe of Corinth,) made priuely their peace, without knowledge giuen therof either to the Pope, or king of spaine, who in these wars had ben their associats: whilst Marcus Antonius Columna, Pope Pius quintus general, alwaies in opinion against the same, persuaded to his power the contrary: & that so worthy an occasion of further victory, should not so vnworthely be relinquished. Of which matter imparting his mynde to his friend Folieta, it became the subiect of this en∣suing discourse: wherin Folieta not intermedling with what the Venetians had done, onely layes downe in general such cau∣ses, (as by great reason may be thought) of those fortunate suc∣cesses which hourely attend the Turkish Ensignes. To which I had rather remit you, then longer to deteine with the harshnes of an ill pleasing Epistle. And now hauing for the present done that due obseruance to you all, of me long both determined, and desired: I most earnestly beseech you to take my boldnesse in good part, void of all saucie presumption: my meaning as it is, clothed in a sincere will alwaies to serue & honor you: & my request as I shall deserue, for euer to be preserued in your good opinion. Wherwith if you shall so much grace me, I protest there can no one thing giue more fulnesse to much of that happinesse which in this world I affect: wherof nothing distrusting, though meanely deseruing, I take my leaue and rest.
