SIR,
HAving upon your reiterated
instances (which are ever
commands with me) pre∣pared
this Treatise concerning the
History of Chalcography &c. I
thought my self engag'd, to signifie
to the rest, that may possibly re∣ceive
or Satisfaction, or Benefit
from it, to whom they are obliged
for the Publication of it. The
truth is, as it respects the pains
which I have taken, it bears not

the least proportion with my ambi∣tion
of serving you; but as you are
pleased to judge it useful for the
encouragement of the Gentlemen of
our Nation, who sometimes please
themselves with these innocent di∣versions
(Collections worthy of
them for divers respects) and, es∣pecially,
that such as are addicted
to the more Noble Mathematical
Sciences, may draw, and engrave
their Schemes with delight and as∣surance,
I have been induc'd to
think it more worthy your Patro∣nage,
and of my small Adventure,
who professe to have nothing so
much in my desires, and which I
more avow the pursuite of, then
to employ the whole remainder of
the life, which God shall assigne
me, and that I can redeem from its
impertinencies, in contributing to
that great and august designe, which

your illustrious, and happy Genius
do's prompt you to, of cultivating
the Sciences, and advancing of
useful knowledge, emancipated from
the strong contentions, and little
fruit of the former; Envy, and
imposture of the latter Ages.
Sir, This is not in the least to
flatter you, nor can I have other
aime in it, then that by your great
Example, I might excite such as
(like you) have Parts and Fa∣culties,
to things that are glorious,
and wortby of them. Your studies
are so mature and universal, your
travels so highly improv'd, and
your Experience so well establish'd;
that, after I have celebrated the
Conversation which results from all
these perfections, it is from You a∣lone,
that I might describe the
Character of an accomplish'd Ge∣nius,
great, and worthy our Emu∣lation.

But though your modesty
do's not permit me to run thro∣ugh
all those Transcendencies;
yet, the World is sufficiently instru∣cted
by what you cannot conceal, that
I say nothing of servile, and which
will not abide the Test; so as I have
been often heard to exult in the fe∣licity
of this Conjuncture of ours,
which (since those prodigies of
Virtue, the illustrious Ticho, Bacon,
Gilbert, Harvey, Digby, Gali∣leo,
Peiresky, De Cartes, Gassendi,
Bernier [his Disciple now in Per∣sia]
and the late incomparable Ja∣como
Maria Favi &c.) has pro∣duc'd
us nothing, which will sup∣port
the comparison with you, when
I shall pronounce you (and as in∣deed
your merits do challenge it)
the Phaenix of this latter Age.
And now that I mention'd Sig∣nor
Favi, I will not conceal with

what extasie, and joy I lately found
his memory (which I have so much,
and so often heard mention'd a∣broad,
by such as had the happiness
to know him intimately) consecra∣ted
by the eloquent pen of Monsieur
Sorbiere, in a discourse of his to
Monsieur Vitre, concerning the
utility of great Travel and Forreign
Voyages; because it approches so
neer to the Idea which I have pro∣pos'd,
and may serve as an encou∣ragement
and example to the Gen∣tlemen
of our Nation, who, for the
most part wander, and spend their
time abroad, in the pursuite of those
vain and lower pleasures, fruitless,
and altogether intollerable. But
Sir, I will crowd no more into
this Epistle (already too prolixe)
which was only design'd to accom∣pany
this piece, and some other use∣full,
and more liberal diversions

of this nature, which I cannot yet
produce: But every thing has its
time, and when I would redeem it
to the best Advantage, it is by en∣tertaining
it with something that
may best declare to all the World,
how greatly I account the honour of
being esteem'd
Sir, 

Sayes-Court 5. April 1662.
