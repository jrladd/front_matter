HAuing obserued (Right Honorable) that since the publishing in print, of my last labors in Mu∣sicke, diuers persons of great honor and worship, haue more esteemed & delighted in the exercise of that Art, then before. And being perswaded, that the same hath the rather encreased, through their good acceptation of my former endeuors: it hath especially moued and encouraged me to take further paines to gratifie theyr curteous dispositions therevnto, knowing that the varietie and choyse of songs, is both a prayse of the Art, and a pleasure to the delighted therein. And finding no person to whome the dedication thereof so fitly and properly belonged, as vnto your Lordship, by whome (through the honorable office which you exercise about her Maiesties person) both my selfe (for my place of seruice,) & all other her highnesse Musitions are to be commanded, and vnder your high aucthoritie to be protected. And for many fauors to me shewed, being most deepely bound vnto your Honor, hauing not in me any other powre of seruiseable thanckfulnesse then in notes & tunes of Musicke. I most humbly beseech your Lordship to take into your Honorable protection, these my poore trauells in that Art, accepting them as seruants redy to giue your L. delight, after you haue bene forewearied in affayres of great importance. Besee∣ching almightie God to giue you a long, healthie, and happie lyfe, with a blessed end. I humbly take my leaue.
