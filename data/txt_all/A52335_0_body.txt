MY LORD,
INstead of prefixing so great a
Name to the following Papers,
I had thoughts of craving Your
Grace's Patronage for some others
which more nearly relate to the Af∣fairs
of Your own Province. But, I
know not how, these have gotten the
start; and, tho' I may (for the pre∣sent)
have some Reason to vary my
Subject, I hope, I may be allow'd to
put those also under Your Prote∣ction
hereafter. I am deeply sensi∣ble
of my own Insufficiency to per∣fect
what is here begun, without
such Assistances as Your Grace (a∣bove

all others) can best afford me.
My great distance from Libraries,
and the narrowness of my Acquain∣tance
with our English Historians,
will render my best Performances
very scanty and imperfect. Yet,
if the Design be approv'd and meet
with acceptance abroad, I shall not
despair of such helps as will rectify
all my mistakes, and supply the
defects of this first Essay. To this
purpose, I now humbly offer it to
Your Grace's View and Censure;
being very ready to acknowledge
all your Corrections as so many
Particular Obligations and Honours
conferr'd upon,
MY LORD,
