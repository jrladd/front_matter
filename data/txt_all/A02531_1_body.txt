SIR,
Besides all priuate
obligations, your
very name chal∣lengeth
from me
all due seruices
of loue, and ho∣nour;
If I haue receiued mercy to
beare any fruit, next vnder heauen,

I may thanke the stocke wherein I
was ymped; which was set by no other
then the happie hand of your right Hono∣rable
Grandfather; How haue I so long
forborne the publique Testimonie of my
iust gratulations, and thankfull respects
to so true an heire of his noble vertues.
Pardon me that I pay this debt so late;
and accept of this parcell of my well-meant
labours; Wherein you shall see
SALOMON both in his rising and set∣ting;
his rising hopefull and glorious, his
declination fearefull; You shall see the
proofes of his early graces; of mercie, in
sparing ADONIIAH, and ABIA∣THAR;
of iustice, in punishing that riuall
of his, with IOAB, and SHIMEI; of
wisdome, in his award betwixt the two
harlots, and the administration of his
Court, and state: of pietie, in building
and hallowing the Temple; all dashed in
his fall, repaired in his repentance. I
haue no cause to misdoubt either the ac∣ceptation,
or vse of these mine hie pit∣ched
thoughts; which, together with your

selfe, and your worthy and vertuous
Lady, I humbly commend to the care and
blessing of the hiest; who am bound by
your worth and merits to be euer
