Right Honourable,
THe wrath of God so variously and dreadfully revealed from heaven of late against this Nati∣on; and all the ungodlinesse and unrighttousnesse of men therein, for which Gods wrath hath been so revealed, do call and cry aloud to all the Kingdom for mature and true Repen∣tance. To the making up of true Repentance (that holy change of the sinners person and conversation) these Four necessary and eminent ingredients seem principally required: viz. 1. Conviction of sin, Joh. 16. 8, 9▪ 2. Contrition for sin, Psal. 51. 17. Acts 2. 36, 37. 2 Cor. 710. . Avorsion, or turning away from sin, both in inward Principles, and outward Pra∣ctices, Isai. 1. 16. and 55. 7. Ezek. 18▪ 30, 31 32▪ And 4. Con∣version to God in Christ, both in hear and life, Isai. 557. and

1. 17. Hos. 14. 12. Jerem. 4▪ 1. Joel 2. 12, 13. For till the Con∣science be convinced of sin, how shall the heart be contrite for sin? till the heart be contrite and kindly broken for sin, how shall it forsake and turn away from sin? Till the beart truely turn away from sin, how should it acceptably convert or re∣turn to God? And till the sinner do return even unto God, how can he be said compleatly and truely to repent?
1. In Conviction of sin, these things seem specially impli∣ed: viz. 1. A sin-guiltinesse wherewith the sinner may be charged. All have sinned, Rom. 5. 12. and Christ alone was ho∣ly, harmlesse, undefiled, separate from sinners, Heb. 7. 26. and none could convince him of sin, Joh. 8. 46. 2. Clear and evi∣dent Manifestation of that sin-guiltinesse to the soul, by the divine light of the Word and Spirit of God, Psal. 50. 21. Joh. 3. 1920. Ephes. 5. 13. 3. Reflection, and the turning in of the soul upon it self, to take a deliberate view of sin manife∣sted. If they shall bethink themselves:  Heb. If they shall return unto their heart: or, If they shall bring back unto their beart, 1 Kings 8. 47. 4. And finally, a self-sentencing, upon this self-reflection, as clearly guilty of such sin, or sinfulnesse; as 2 Sam. 12. 13. with Psal. 51. 4.
2. In Contrition for sin, these things seem peculiarly to be contained: viz. 1. The souls deep apprehensivenesse of the hatefulnesse, abominablenesse, and sinfulnesse of sin wherewith it is convinced, seriously laying it to heart, as being most live∣ly and clearly sensible thereof. Psal. 51. 3. My sin is ever before me. 2. The hearts hating, detesting and abominating of these iniquities with indignation, so deeply apprehended, as the greatest burdens, diseases, deformities, evils or enemies in the world, 2 Cor. 7. 11. 3. The spirits inward relenting, melting, and mourning bitterly for sin thus detested and ab∣horred, Zech. 12, 10, 11, 12. 2 Cor. 7. 10. 2 Chron. 34 27. 4. The sinners deep debasing humbling, loathing and abhor∣ring themselves for their iniquities so abominated and lamen∣ted. 2 Chron. 33. 12. Ezek. 6. 9, and 20 43. and 36. 31. Job 42. 6▪
Now these inward acts of Contrition oft-times have been of old represented by Gerh. loc. com. De Poenitent. Tom. 3. c. 11. §1. outward discoveries and expressions of 1. Fasting, as counting themselves unworthy of all food,

Joel 1. 14. 2. Rending of garments, denoting the renting of the heart, Joel 2. 13. 3. Tears, which are as the blood of a wounded spirit, Matth. 26. ult. Luke 7. 38. 4. Lying on the ground, in self-debasement, 2 Sam. 12. 16. 5. Covering their eads with ashes, as counting themselves more vile then dust and ashes, Nehem. 9. 1. Job 42. 6. Luke 10. 13. 6. Sack∣cloth, coursest garments, Esth. 43. Jonah 34. 7. Smiting up∣on the thigh, through inward anguish and anxiety, Percutere fe∣mur est signum doloris, sicut mu∣lierculae in puer∣perio facere so∣lent. Luth. in Glost. margi∣nal. as a tra∣velling woman in extremity of pangs, Jer. 31. 19. 8. Beat∣ing of the brests, as deeply discontented at themselves. So the prodigal smote his brest—Luke 18. 13.
Sometimes these external expressions are without the in∣ward acts of Contrition, and then they are but as Crocodiles tears, but meer hypocritical paintings. When outward ex∣pressions and inward Contrition go together, they are melody delectable even to heaven it self.
3. In Aversion from sin, are remarkable, 1. A new and secret antipathy in the soul against sin, from an oppsite prin∣ciple of grace infused, Gal. 517. These two are contrary one to another. 2. Ceasing to do evil both in the elicite and impe∣rate acts of heart and life, Isai. 1. 16. called denying ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, Tit. 2. 11. putting away all filthinesse and su∣perfluity of naughtinesse, Jam. 1. 21. putting off of the old man, Col. 3. 9. casting away of abominations as a menstruons cloth, saying to it, Get thee hence, Isai. 30. 22. &c. 3. Breaking off the occasions, inlets, inducements and temptations to evil for time to come, Psal. 119. 115. as Peter fled from the high∣priests hall where he was tempted, Matth. 26. ult. 4. Main∣taining a constant intestine combat against sin, that it may be mortified, killed, extirpated at last out of the soul. Gal. 5. 17. the spirit lusteth against the flesh. See Rom. 8. 13.
4. Finally, in conversion or turning to God in Christ, are considerable, 1. The Motives inclining and alluring the sin∣ner unto God; viz. extreme want and misery in himself, but compleat fulnesse and felicity in God: How many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough, and to spare, and I pe∣rish with hunger? Luke 15. 17. 2. Resolution upon those in∣citements to turn unto God. I will arise, and go to my Father,

Luke 15. 18, 20. 3. Self-denying groans, desires, cries, for admittance and acceptance. Father, I have sinned against hea∣ven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thine hired servants, Luk. 15 18, 19. 4 Sweet closing with God as his God in Covenant; st out in these pathetick expressions: And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.—said, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his ft: And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry, Luke 15. 20. 22, 23. O when Repentance thus leads the poor soul into the presence of God as a Father, with what unspeakable contentment do they embrace and enjoy one another!
Thus you have (Right Honourable) a dim portraiture of some lieaments of that amible grace of Repentance: The Lord draw a perfect character of uneigned Repentance up∣on every one of your souls, both for your own and Englands sins. Touching the Second of these; viz. CONTRI∣TION, or brsse of bears, and the peculiar grateful∣nesse thereof to God, some plain and familiar meditations (as the narrow scantling of time allotted for preparing them would permit) have been represented in your Honours hear∣ing, and now ate (with some small and necessary amplificati∣on about the opposite hardnesse of heart infected) again hurr∣ly tendred to Your, and the publike view. May any hard heart be softned, or any soft heart supported thereby, how should my spirit be refreshed▪
God hath brought Two of his Four soe Judgements upon the Land; viz. word, and Pestilence; and a Third of Famine may overtake us ere we be aware. How highly doth it con∣cern us all, to present God daily for Englands sins, with bro∣ken hearts, his well pleasing Sacrifices▪ who knows how God may repent him of the evil?
To engage more fully your hearts and others in such Contri∣tion for the sins procuring these publike Judgements, give me leave to lay before your eyes, out of the Scriptures, a Lit of

such sins as God hath been wont of old to Threaten or Pu∣nish with SVVORD, PESTILENCE, or FAMINE; or with all at once: That the wo of former ages may be our war∣ning: For All these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come, 1 Cor. 10. 11.

Thus have I briefly indigitated out of the word of God some of those sins and abominations in these several Catalogues, for which the Lord hath heretofore threatned and plagued his people with SVVORD, PESTILENCE, and FAMINE, (two of which this Kingdome of late hath adly flt, and the third is greatly feared;) That your Honours may cleerly see the equity of Gods severest proceedings with us in all this that is come upon us: and the necessity of our breaking our hearts, and humbling our soules greatly in this Land for all those Sins and Rebellions wherewith we have already pulled so much, and are like to pull down more and more vengeance upon our selves and our Posteritie. For, which of all those Abominations fore-mentioned is not England deeply guilty of? And shall England think to commit the same sins, and yet escape the judgements of God?
Wherefore I most humbly and earnestly beseech your Ho∣nours, that as you tender the glory of God; the true happinesse of this Church and State; the removing of present, and pre∣venting

of future judgements; the treasuring up of blessings for the present generation and for posterity; and the re-im∣barquing of England again in the bosome of Gods favour; you would be pleased in your great zeal and wisdome, to think of some way, how with the advice of the Assembly of Divines, a more full and impartiall Catalogue (then hitherto hath been made) of the Publick sins and provocations of Eng∣land may be drawn up, and published by Authority of Parlia∣ment; and that a most solemn Day of Humiliation for the whole Kingdome may be peculiarly set apart for afflicting of our souls deeply for those sins, from Dan to Beersheba: And let the Lord accept us. Now the Father of mercies and God of all consolation, lift up your hearts in the wayes of God, and make you strong for all the work of God that remains upon your hand. So prayeth
