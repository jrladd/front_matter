SIR,
YOƲR account of the
speedy dispersing of this
Little Tract, encoura∣geth
me to hope, it hath
not only been accepta∣ble
to the World, but also blessed

by God to the reducing some from
the Roman Opinions, and the
establishing others in the Prote∣stant
Faith; And that it may
more effectually serve to these de∣sirable
Ends, I have been content
to obey your Request, in review∣ing
it in order to another Impressi∣on,
which (You tell me) is now
desired. In which Review, I
have rectified the Method of the
whole, and illustrated and streng∣thened
every part, with the Ad∣dition
of so many of the most con∣vincing
Instances and Authori∣ties
as could be put in without too
much swelling the Bulk. I con∣fess
I did suppose the things to be
so evident, and so plainly proved
in larger Discourses, that I was
not curious before, always to bring
Proofs for my Assertions: But
now your Letter acquaints me
both that some Romanists (who

resolve boldly to deny, what they
cannot otherwise evade) have
questioned the Truth of some parts
of this charge; And also that those
Protestants whose Charity hath
invited them to seek their Friends
Conversion, have desired I should
add my Authors to confirm these
Allegations: Therefore for the
full satisfaction of both Parties
I have proved all the particulars
by the Testimony of such Authors
whose Evidence is unquestionable,
chusing usually the plain Confessi∣ons
of Popes and Cardinals, or
other approved Writers of the
Roman Church, that so those of
that Party may believe these
Matters from the mouth of those
whom they esteem their best
Friends, which they would sus∣pect,
if we related upon our own
Credit, whom they unjustly account
their Enemies; And though their

present Romish Priests should deny
those things, which the most E∣minent
Writers of their own
Church have formerly acknow∣ledged,
they are not to be doubted
of upon that account, since the
Confession of former Writers a∣gainst
their own Party is better
Evidence, than the denial of the
later can be for it; for No man
will lye (saith Tertullian) to his
own disgrace, but rather for his
credit: And it is more fit to be∣lieve
such as confess against them∣selves,
than such as deny for them∣selves
Tertul. Apol. cap. 32.. So that
none can justly
doubt of these
Truths thus atte∣sted:
And he that once believes
them, and yet retains the Reli∣gion
of Rome, must be of a humor
differing from the rest of Man∣kind,
who cannot chuse a known

delusion, nor delight in sitting
under apparent abuses. I must
expect the Admirers of that once
famous Church will entertain
these just and necessary Accusati∣ons
thereof with some little heats
of Passion; but I hope it will calm
those hasty motions when they de∣liberately
consider, that since I
say no more than Truth I do no
injury to Rome, and the Charity
which I have for them obliges
me to say so much. And why
(saith the Philosopher) art thou
displeased at me, who have done
no more than a Looking-glass doth
to the deformed, having only
shewed thee to thy self as thou
art? Shall the Physician be said
to reproach him whose disease he
discovers to him
Arrian. in Epict. l. 2. c. 14.? They will re∣member
I hope that
I have undertaken

the office of a Friendly Counsel∣lor,
whose duty (according to the
Graecian Sage) is, Not to advise
that which is most pleasing, but
that which is most
profitableDiog. La∣ert. in Vit. So∣lon.. And
if in compliance
with this Rule I
shall somewhat dis∣please
them to their Advantage,
I shall not only obtain a Pardon,
but merit their Thanks also in
the end: However, I ask no
more, than that laying aside their
Prejudices, they will put on so
much affection to their own real
interest as to weigh the Reasons
and Arguments upon which my
Advice is grounded, and if they
be convincing and perswasive, I
desire them not to resist their own
Freedom, nor despise him that
sincerely seeks their good; but
if they absolutely resolve the most

rational and just Motives shall
not perswade them to alter their
Old Opinions, I shall pity and
pray for them, but can use no
other Methods in this case; for
it is Counsel and not Command
which I give, since men should be
reasoned and not forced into a
right Faith, and would God the
Roman Church had never obtru∣ded
her Opinions upon the world
by any other means, but these
gentle and rational perswasions,
her Neighbours then would not
have had so just cause to complain
of her. And now, Sir, since I
write, and you and other zealous
Protestants act by these fair Me∣thods,
if our endeavours for our
Countrymens Conversion be not ma∣liciously
misconstrued, they cannot
be censured to tend to the harm of
any, but must be confessed to aim
at the present and future happi∣ness

of all that we shall address
our selves to in this Matter: And
I shall rejoyce if my pains herein
may attain these blessed ends, and
let you particularly understand
how gladly I would encourage
your Love to the Church of Eng∣land,
and comply with all your
Pious desires, since I am,
Sir,
