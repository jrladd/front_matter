SIR, to forget your vndeserued kindnesse, were
a note out of my nature: & yet how kindely to
requite it, is many notes aboue my ability. But
as a lame man, that striues to goe, shewes hee
would runne, if hee had legges: so, in the hu∣mour
of my good will, imagin a Desire of a grea∣ter
matter. But leauing these complements, and to come to
my purpose; as I haue found you a kinde Spectator of my La∣bours,
so let mee entreat you, at my hands to accept this trea∣tise,
with a foolish title. Where, if VVit haue plaid the Wagge,
let him not haue his name for nothing: and where you finde a
head fit for this Cappe, either bestowe it vpon him in charity,
or send him where he may haue them for his money. I know
you are acquainted with many that well deserue it: whome,
least they should be mistaken for better men, I pray you giue
them the Cappe for their Cognisaunce. And so, hoping that
your discretion will beare with my imperfection, to finde no
better worke, to giue notice of my good will; I rest, with much
thankfulnesse, in more Affection than Protestation.
