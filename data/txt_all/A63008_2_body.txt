My Lord,
I Am now at an end of a long, and laborious Work, begun and car∣ried on in the more prosperous times of our Church, but finish∣ed with no less Zeal for that Re∣ligion, which she professeth, and with an equal, if not greater regard to Your Lordship, who to your own immortal Honour, and the satis∣faction of all good Men, have so firmly adhered to it.
The Argument, that is now before me, hath (I doubt not) been handled by much bet∣ter Pens, and, if I may judge by those few Treatises which I have seen, in a way worthy of the Age we live in, and of that Religion, which we have the honour to profess. But whether any one Man hath spoken to the several parts thereof, which is my proper Business, is
more than I my self have observed, or receiv'd any intimation of from other Men. However, I have been so fearful of transcribing the Con∣ceptions of others, that I have avoided to look into many things, which I my self might have profited by; As conceiving that a Man's own natural thoughts, how slight soever, may be more useful, and acceptable, than a repetition of far better ones of other Men. If, whilst I too eagerly pursue my own thoughts, I some∣time happen to stumble, they, who consider the honesty of my Design, will, I hope, be more ready to pity, and pardon, than any way in∣sult over my Infirmities. Which hopes I am the more confirmed in, because I have all along had the Scripture in my Eye, and particularly those parts thereof, which give an account of the Institution of this Sacrament, and by which, if by any thing, we must attain a due under∣standing of it.
If what I have offer'd upon this, and the other parts of our Churches Catechism, may be so useful to its Members, as to furnish them with a General Idea of the Doctrines it contains, and sufficient Arguments to confirm them, I shall think my Pains to have been as profitably be∣stow'd, as a Man of my Circumstances was ca∣pable of employing them: That, which in my poor Opinion hath been the great Bane of the Church of England, being the necessity the Members thereof have been under of laying the foundation of their Knowledge in foreign Sy∣stemes, which have not only much alienated their
Affections from the Religion profess'd among us, but so prejudic'd their Minds against it, as to make them proof against the greatest Convicti∣ons, which the best of our Writers have been able to offer to them. Which therefore if these my Labours may serve in any measure to pre∣vent, I have as much as I desire; But however, shall rest satisfi'd in this, that I have done the best service I could to the Church of England, and have therefore little left me to do, save to pray for the Prosperity thereof, which is, and shall be the daily employment of
