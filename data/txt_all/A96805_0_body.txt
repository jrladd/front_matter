My Lord,
I Have been long indebted both to your Lordship, your noble Lady, and your hopeful Son Mr. Watson, for your favours and good will towards me; I have therefore adventured (not by way of requital, but of acknowledgement) to pre∣sent this Theological Epitome to You, which is the most exact and compendious of any that hath been yet done by Protestant Wri∣ters: I may say of this Edition, as Philoso∣phers speak of Nature; that, It is neither de∣ficient in necessaries, nor abundant in superflui∣ties: What was in the Latine Copy dark, I have cleared; and what was contracted, I have unfolded. How needful Epitomes are  in all Sciences, chiefly in Divinity, I need not write; if either we consider the short∣nesse of our time, or the largenesse and mul∣titude of Volumes which have been written of this Subject, or the weaknesse of our me∣mories, or the fastidiousnesse that is begot in us by reading tedious and voluminous Discourses. God who knows what is best for us, hath epitomized all Practical Divi∣nity into X. Precepts, and our Saviour hath reduced those ten into two, and all that we can pray for or against, into six heads or Pe∣titions. The traveller that desires to be soon at his journeys end, will seek out the most compendious way: He is an unwise traveller that will clog himself with Silver, if he can epitomize it into Gold; sure a weak stomack will better retain the smal quantity of an extract, then the large draught of a nauseating potion: He that with judgement doth contract the vast body of Divinity in∣to an Abridgement, doth imitate God, who having the first day diffused the light through the whole Hemisphere, contracted it, and as it were epitomized it the fourth day within the body of the Sun: He that will condemn Epitomes, condemns himself;  for man is the epitome of the world. But I must avoid prolixity in commending this Epitome, lest my practise thwart my words. My Lord, This Book is the Epitome of Divi∣nity; and this Epistle, the Epitome of my true affection, and many thanks I owe you and yours: on whom I wish the influ∣ence of all happinesse, which is the hearty desire of
