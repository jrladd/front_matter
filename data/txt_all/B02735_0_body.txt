SIR,
ALthough it may seem a presumption in mee, to present so small and poor a thing unto the world under your Name, yet I have suffi∣cient reasons, to Justifie my self as to others therein; that albeit you have shewn your self a Master in Historie, as also in a fluencie, and comptnesse of Language, and stile, making all things firm, and uncontroleable even to your adversarie: so that it was repor∣ted
abroad (even then in those daies) that sure you had (which is well nigh a miracle in writing) converted him unto a righter Judgement. Yet seing this small piece is a kinde of Historie, though, if there be any truth in me, but of few hours; com∣posed meerly, as you may see, out of a sad memorie of things past, and is meerly historical; it being methought (considering the duty of the day) he best argument could possiblie be used, to any that had the least shew of ingenuitie, to bring them to a heartie mourning, sorrow, and re∣pentance, to hear agen what evils have been done in these unfortunate times past; though I wanted some small helps even for this, to do those honourable persons, and others, right
in naming them in particular, who ever suffered in the Cause. But it being (as I was saying) a matter of historie, besides the particular application to the present occasion, to whom should I present it, but as in the Schools they use to do their exercise, even to him that is the very Master of the Sci∣ence? and besides, I have other Ob∣ligations, you being the head of that loyal, and persecuted Family, next to your Right Reverend Aged Father, the learned Lord Bishop of Ely, that great Confessour of the Church of England. I having (as I was saying) been obliged to the other line of your Family manie yeares since, by the greatest indearments that a Sober man can phansie: how can I but be offering my respects, in tendring some signi∣fication
of my observance unto you? Against what else may be said, I have only this to answer in General, That Parents are wont to love their weakest Children most, and to seek for them the best favour they can get, it may be so perhaps with me, for I'le assure you, I have not been altoge∣ther idle, and could prove it too, were it not for some trouble I find in this; by something able of it self to stand alone. But if, most worthy Sir, you can pardon this present Bold∣nesse of mine; you shall adde to the other Obligations in my account; and I shall bee bound to pray for your Happiness, and remain
