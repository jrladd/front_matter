CRATERVS contending with Ephestion (most gracious Prince) which of them two loued Alexāder best, appealed to the king for iudgement, who iudged that Cra∣terus loued the king, and Ephestion loued Alexander: but both alike loued Alexan∣der the king. So the Brytaynes and the English loue your Maiesty in like sort, that you can hardly iudge which of them loues you best, vnlesse you do as Alex∣ander did, to iudge the English as Craterus, & the Brytaynes as Ephestion. but both Brytaines & English with equall loue and loyalty loue King lames alike, that all hauing the like cause of ioy, all should so reioyce to enioy such a Iewell, that in one day enriched England & Ireland with a king, and the whole Empire of Brytayne with a Prince, to whome it was reserued and continued from Brutus the first King, to your Maiesty the second King, not as to a stranger, but to a iust & a lawfull king of the stocke and linage of Brutus, to succeed and sit on Brutus seat 2800. yeeres after Brutus, where your Maiesty may better say then Caesar, Veni, vidi, vici, for that you haue conquered Time, came to your owne kingdomes, and may see in your selfe such a succession, that neyther the Macedonians, who much bragged of their Hercules, whose lyne ended in Alexander: neyther the Romanes, who much gloried of Gens Iulia, whose stocke extincted in Nero: nor any nation vnder heauen (which can boast of their antiqui∣ties most) can say so much.
The Scythians with their Acornes in their heads, and the Athenians with their Grassehoppers in their haires, may wel bragge of their Acornes and Grassehoppers, but not of the like Empires: for as Anaxagoras sayd to Pericles of the Em∣pire

of Greece, so Cratippus spake to Pompey of the Romane Empire, that periods of times are limited.
Embrace you therefore (most mighty Prince) the great blessings of God, which so embraced your Maiesty, & elec∣ted you King, to gouerne his people, and to maintayne his lawes, without which, neither king nor kingdome can stand, for that is the rich Tablet, which Moses brought from Mount Sinay, to set about Israels neck. It is that long ladder, which Iacob saw in his dreame at Bethel, that reached frō the earth into heauen: and it is that bright-shining Starre, which guyded the kings from the East, vnto Christ at Bethlehem.
The only Pearle that we should buy, and the only Iewel that wee should weare, not as gards on our garments, or frontiers on our forheads, as the Iewes wore Phylacterium, but rather printed in our hearts, where we ought to giue thanks for our King, which for 50. yeeres haue bene without either King or Prince, and now wee enioy a King, a Queene, a Prince, and Princes, with no lesse blessings by the comming of your Maiesty ouer the riuer Tweede, from Scotland to England, to incorporate both to the ancient name of great Brytaine, then by the comming of Israel from Mesopota∣mia, ouer the riuer Iordan, to alter the name of Canaan into Iuda; whose posterity, as they were wrought on Aarons garment, to remember Israel, so your princely progeny may bee sure set on the vnseamed coate of Christ, to remember the house of Iacob.
