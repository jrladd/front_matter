My Lord,
I Doubt not but your known worth for learning, soundness of judgement, piety, and conscience-satis∣fying skill and ex∣perience hath singled you out as a fit object of eminent honour, from

the publick Authority of this Na∣tion, who yet do appear more ho∣norable in the esteem of conscien∣tious Christians, in regard of that truly Christian frame of Spirit re∣markeably in you, by your ready propensity in promoting of unitie, manifest by your willingness to the taking away the hinderances thereof in these divided times; the like disposition of mind would al∣so be justly honorable in all of your ranke, that substantial good in Re∣ligion might more be advanced, but shaddows and seeming appear∣ances less, and the glory of Gospel grace above all other glories; for which, the Apostles rule is both ge∣neral and peremptory, 1 Cor. 14. 26. Let all things be done to edify∣ing: How might truth and peace by that means soon be settled in the Church, which ought of all men to be esteemed of far greater va∣lue,

then all their worldly interests, yea, then a mans own dearest pre∣sent life: And truly so much as I know my own heart in my most re∣tired thoughts, I have often offered in these distractions amongst good men, even my life as an expiation unto God, if he would take it in any way of his faithful service upon that account, so that I dying, truth and peace might live and flo∣rish in this our Israel; & yet I may happily amongst some be deem∣ed an obstructer of both; but as according to my measure, I have been studious of the one, so accor∣ding to your Honours ancient testi∣mony of me, I have followed the things that make for the other, to the utmost of my power, neither am I changed from my former principles, though now, in sundry respects, I may not (perhaps) have the same freedome: I confi∣dently

beleeve the soveraign hand of divine providence, in special fa∣vour, (not only to my self, but to many much better deserving per∣sons) hath in this juncture of time given you the inspection over us; the consideration whereof, with o∣ther special favours, which you rea∣dily, & chearfully, aunciently vouch∣safed unto me, with the observatio∣on of such your Christian frame of spirit still abiding in you, whom new and eminent honour, known learning, sound judgment, worldly interest or engagements appear not to have made either less humble, meek, peaceable, or charitable; and that man that is well moulded up from such materialls, and in his better part (as it were) fitly com∣pounded of four such elements, must needs be of a good constitu∣tion; such living Christians adde a glory to Gospel glory: I would

my small Mite here offered could adde unto your store, yet if it doe but occasion you better to weigh and value what you already have, to the praise of him that gives us all, it may prove some advantage to you, & then I should be well ap∣paid, and shall thankfully returne the praise to him, by whose remar∣keable grace I have been carried on therein; who as the Apostle spea∣keth, Colos: 1. 29. striving accor∣ding to his working, who worketh in me mightily. Yet one thing more doth move me to this address: I have long since known you a strong Champyon of sound truth against Popish errours; witness your anci∣ent conditions of dispute against Mr. Ford, well worthy of the worlds view, and profitable for such use, which happily deterred him from proceeding: In the same general cause many times appeared

your reverend father, and my wor∣thy friend Mr. H. Nelson, to whom about thirty years now past, I com∣municated a short but pithie dis∣course of Mr. E. D. a reverend person related to him, from whom I received it, and since also to my self, which hereunto I have annex∣ed, which your good father so well approved of (notwithstand∣ing all Antichristian flourishes to the contrary) that he was pleased to write some notes of his own upon it, some of which I transcri∣bed into the margin, I cannot say all; and whose collections to like purpose, as an Appendix, I have also subjoyned thereunto, which after many years lying aside unthought of, upon my late removal, were offered to my view, upon the pe∣rusal whereof, I considering the known gravity and piety of both the Authors, with the worth of

their workes fit to antidote such weakelings (as are lyable to that danger) against the strong conta∣gion of that popish pestilence, by beating down the main pillar of that foundationless fabrick; no wonder then the prophetical spirit, Rev. 8. 18. 1. reitterates her ruine, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, [Ʋt ingens pondus mole sua ruens] as an huge and mighty pile wel∣tring downward by its own weight, since her supposed foundation failes her, yea is discovered to be but a lye; which I here likewise tender unto your Lordship, but not with further expectation from your self, in respect of this or the other to be approved, then as they will endure the tryall by the Touchstone of all saving truth, the written word of God, and consonant to sound judg∣ment and reason; and answerably thereunto, a blessing from his di∣vine

Majesty thereupon, to whom (in that case) all the praise will be due; and to whom in the mean time, his prayer shall be presented before the throne of grace, in the behalf of your self, your deare yoakefellow, and all yours; that he would largely display the spiritual glory of Gospel grace, in and un∣to all your soules, to a greatertrans∣formation of them into the same Image, by the Lord the Spirit, (as followeth) to the inlargement of all your eternal glory, who is,
My Lord,
