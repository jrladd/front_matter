IF we may credit the di∣ctates of Venerable A∣strology, we are to im∣pute the happy or un∣happy conduct of our Lives, to the benevolence, or malig∣nancy, of those Aspects, which guide our Nativities. What Pieces of the most Co∣mical,
and most Burlesque Monsieur SCARRON have come forth in my Dress, I fell upon under your Roof, and they had their Birth, in English, under your Patronage, and accor∣dingly prov'd fortunate in the World. But since, in the production of the least Effect, there is a gene∣ral concurrence of all natu∣ral Causes, I am to attribute that success (besides the precedent Direction) to the just perswasions of the more ingenious, who voted something of more then or∣dinary excellency, in what
they saw Dedicated to so precious a name as STAN∣LEY.
When the former NO∣VELS came first abroad, you were acting Lord Chan∣cellour among the Ancient Philosophers, assigning the several Sects, their proper Sentiments and Opinions, and, in a Decree of Two large Volumes, deciding all the differences between them. But This (if I am rightly in∣form'd) will find you con∣sulting the Oracles of our Municipal Laws, of which Study, since you have over∣come the severity, I am
only to wish you the Sweet∣ness and Advantages.
It were easie for me to apologize for the smallness of the Present I now make you, by alledging, that Books, like Essences, derive not their value from Quan∣tity, but Vertues, and that a little Pill, or Cordial, pre∣scrib'd by a HARVEY, or SCARBOROƲGH, outvy, in esteem, all the voluminous Recipe's of the ordinary Class of Physici∣ans. But I would rather let the World know, by this Address, that your Kind∣nesses to me have begot this
Familiarity; that they have excited in me a presumpti∣on of your Acceptance, though I waited on you with the Copy of a meaner Original; and that I am, notwithstanding this Confi∣dence, with the greatest sub∣missions and respects,
Honoured Sir,
