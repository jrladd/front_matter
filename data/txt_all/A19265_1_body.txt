CAll vppon me (sayth God) in the day of thy trouble, and I will de∣liuer thee. Greater troubles with lesse comfortes than in the raging Seas, can not be founde, as those with Dauid must confesse which occupie their busines in greate waters. This daungerous Iourney, as among many others ye are in the Lordes name to aduenture, so vouch∣safe this preparatiue to your godly hart, and by and with the same in assured hope of Gods assi∣staunce for his Christ, approche his mercy seate. The hast we haue, and gaping hope for Wester∣ly winds, will not permit long leysure, to proyue this sodayne frame. Take it (Right Worship∣full) as it is, and accept the good will of the Ge∣uer, vse it at your neede to the Lordes prayse, and your present comfort, which is my harty de∣sire. And I shall dayly pray the Lorde for you, and vs, that we may speedely imbarke, and safely arriue in Englande through Chri∣stes ayde, the master of our ship. 
At Holme Patricke in Irelande. 17. October. 1575.
