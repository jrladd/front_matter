Noble Sir;
THE God of Armies hath done great things by you as an instrument, for the peace and security of his people in this bleeding Kingdome; I may speak it (without flattery) that you are the glory of England, and so you will be ever esteemed by all true English-men; your place is honourable; your birth is noble: but much more your spirit which God hath raised and fitted for great and honorable acheivements. When
Saul was made King of Israel the Lord gave him a royall spirit fit for Kingly government; and sure∣ly when your EXCELLENCY was appointed Generall of the Parlia∣ments Army; a fourefold portion of the spirit of wisdome, courage, and meeknes, was poured out upon you; that you might be as bold as a lyon, and yet as meek as a lambe; which two excellent vertues have shined forth in your conversation.
The Lord hath given large te∣stimony to your faithfulnesse by ma∣ny unparelled successes, so that the Army under your EXCELLEN∣CIES command since they were first modelt'd have not been frustrated in any warlike attempt; and how∣ever some discontented spirits that are engaged to a faction) censure your proceedings, yet I am confi∣dent there is no man that hath a drop of true English blood runing in his veines, or that hath a right
understanding of the privileges of the subjects of England but will blesse God for you, and make an honorable mention of the very name of the Lord Farfax, and the army under his command.
You are yet on the stage, and many eyes are upon you; he that hath hitherto enabled you to play your part wisely for the preservati∣on of three bleeding Kingdoms, will (I doubt not) in his own good time bring you off honourably, and all those under your command that are acted by the same principles of pub∣lique interest.
Tis true (deare Sir) there are divers members of your Army (as there will be in such a numerous bo∣dy) that are slight-spirited and hold many heterodox and unsound opinions, which no sober Christian can approve of; yet this I can speake (uppon mine owne certaine knowledge) That there is a preti∣ous
publique spirited people in your army; a people that mourn for the divisions of the times; a people that seeke the glory of Christ and not their owne honour; a people that walke much with God and have a close communion with him; and who recount continually (with much thankfulnesse) the sweete providences and dispensations of God towards them and the whole Kingdome by them.
As for your Excellency. It hath pleased the Lord to try you severall waies not only by the malitious slaunders of open adversaries, and by your own bodily weaknesses; but also the unChristian and ungrat∣ful censurings of pretended friends: and of these their are two sorts (i) those that are riged in their opini∣ons and practice touching, Church goverment, and (2) another sort who are or were lately menbers of your army that pretend to be above
formes, and to have an extraordi∣nary knowledge of divine misteries but to speake the truth, they are low and carnall and disobedient to lawfull authority both civill and martiall: and indeed the power of our good God hath wonderfully ap∣peared, in carying you through these great temptations and difficulties with much settlenesse and chearfull∣nesse of spirit: If the Lord had not been on your side (may you say) you bad been swallowed up ere this; and the prosperity, and happinesse of three Kingdomes in you: Let the Lord have the glory of this, as hee hath had of his other mercies from your Excellency.
Sir, I am bold to tender this little treatise to your Excellency: if I did not look on you as humble and spirituall, I should not present it to you, for it is not sutable to the wis∣dome and greatnesse of the world, but to the experience of humble
Saints; with whose hidden privi∣ledges and comforts (I doubt not) you are well acquainted. Now the Lord stablish you in the truth, and blesse you and yours with all spiri∣tuall and heavenly blessings in Christ.
