Most dread Sovereign,
THough your Court be now much fuller of Gratulations To You, than once your Camp was with Bullets A∣gainst You; though your Royal Palace be as much be∣set with the cheerfull Du∣ties of Men, as your Royal Oake was pitch'd about with the Ministry of Angels, and the trembling Prayers of three Kingdoms: Yet I humbly crave leave, that one Shrub amongst so many Cedars, may testifie his joy, that the Powder-fire hath not come out of the Bramble to destroy those Cedars, nor to do violence to
the persecuted Defender of them, and of the helpless Shrubs too. Nor do I much fear the repulse of my loyal Suit, since a good Prince will be as accessible and exorable, as his great God; That God hath humbled himself to hear my constant Prayers for the King, and the King will stoop so low to hear my Petition to the King; since 'tis no more, than that your Majesty may be acquainted, that we who contributed to the dulling of the edge of the sword, to the quenching of the Vollies of fire against you, with lowder vollies of those primitive weapons (the one fervent enough to melt the Sword, and the other moist enough to extinguish the flame) Tertullian's Preces & Lachrymae, have now chang'd our armor into Preces & Praeconia, Praises to God for your Majesty's unbloudy Victory; Good will towards men, for that the same Voices, and the same Guns, which before made a separation from amongst us, and breath'd out slaughter upon us, have now clos'd with us, in shouting out the common joy, and vollying out the Triumphs of the King, His leige People and themselves; a joy too
big to be understood, and we that feel it, can∣not tell all the joy we feel; who, unless some Angel, will dare to recount the fulness af honor which God hath done to your Majesty beyond all the Princes in Christendom! To unite two Kingdoms into one Britain, was a great and wise work of your Royal Grandfather, for which he deservedly wears the Name of The wisest Monarch of all before him; but this was brought to pass in his riper years, in his dayes of Peace; what will not mature judge∣ment and much plenty do, when the very lack of judgement, the very desire of plenty hath made one (with whom I would not exchange my Curateship for all the Crowns he now hath,
Aliter cineres mando jacere meos) wade through bloud rebelliously shed, through oaths, forsworn, all of them, some, in not being kept, the rest, in being taken, till he climb'd into a Throne, Ut lapsu graviore ruat?
But what greater wonders hath God done by your Majesty? your tender years have over∣come so vast miseries which would kill him, whom the Devil tempted to murther, and God suffered to Martyr the best of Kings: Your
yonger days have reduc'd three States, & three Protectordoms into three Realms, and those three Realms under one King, and that one King the lawfull head of them all: Come An∣gels and speak; we, over-master'd mortals, must sit down and wonder. Nothing else is left for us, besides to pray, that God would continue to make you wiser than your wisest Grandfather; to make you as holy (for our conceptions cannot imagine any thing to have been (besides the Man Christ) or to can be more holy) as your Royal Father; to bless your Ma∣jesty, and your Kingdoms under you, with all the blessings which God hath ever bestowed upon good and suffering Kings, or will ever grant to reform'd and penitent People.
