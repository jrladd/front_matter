READER,
WHat may be the Fate of
this Book, I can't Di∣vine,
nor will I be soli∣citous
concerning it:
But I expect, and also claim at
thine hands so much Candour, as
that, how meanly soever thou
mayest think of it, thou wilt not
judge uncharitably of the Au∣thor's
Design in writing it. I
(that may best know it) am able
to assure thee, that it was not to
gratifie those Persons (he wish∣eth
he may not rather offend
them) whom he therein giveth

a true account of; but to serve
a more noble Interest: Nor is it
his desire, that their Adversaries
would entertain a more favoura∣ble
opinion of them, upon their
reading the following Lines, but
onely in order to their being re∣conciled
to their Spirit and Prin∣ciples.
This is an Age wherein plain
and open-hearted Dealing will
be by no means endured, and
must look for no better thanks
from the generality, than Calum∣nies
and down-right Rayling.
But I am very sure that no man
can be easily provoked by any
thing in this Dialogue, but he
that accounts Moderation a great
Crime; and is conscious to him∣self,

that he is, in the way it hath
pleased him to espouse, a hot spi∣rited
and violent Zealot. For
neither Theophilus nor Philale∣thes,
have taken a course to exa∣sperate
any one of the contesting
Parties, but only (and much a∣like
too) the high and fierce men
of each Party. And as for such,
they could not perswade them∣selves
to be over-careful not to
displease them; as too well know∣ing
that it would signifie nothing
so to be; they being a Generati∣on
of people whose waspish and
testy (not to add proud) Spirits,
can by no means brook a Dissen∣ter,
scarcely in the smallest, and
most trivial matters. Whereas
Theophilus, as he passeth along,

doth engage himself in the Con∣futation
of certain Opinions, I
desire thee to take notice, that he
is, notwithstanding, so far from a
disputing or contradicting Geni∣us,
that I know no man more a∣verse
than himself thereto: And
he thinks time infinitely better
spent in the serious practice of
true Piety, than in disputing or
studying Controversies: and that
there is no such life, when all is
done, as that which is chiefly
employed in mortifying Cor∣ruptions,
and making our selves
more and more like to God, and
fit for the enjoyment of him.
And, indeed, if all our Professors
of Christianity did sincerely
love God; and made it their great

business to keep Consciences void
of offence towards him and men;
it would be scarcely worth the
while to concern our selves much
about curing them of any of
their mistakes: For so long as they
are careful to exercise themselves
in so doing, to be sure they can∣not
possibly be such as would so
far injure them, as to render them
uncapable of Eternal Blessedness.
But seeing there are several Opi∣nions,
very highly cryed up a∣mong
us, which do apparently
make many of the Embracers of
them much worse, and have an
extreamly bad influence upon
their Lives, and therefore much
more upon their Souls, it must
needs be a work of great Charity

to endeavour to undeceive those
that hold them. And they are
such Doctrines alone, as Theo∣philus
is assured are of very bad
consequence, that he hath much
troubled himself about, in this
Discourse. As for the last Opi∣nion,
that he spends any conside∣rable
time in endeavouring to
shew the falsity of, it was at first
his intention to take no notice of
it: But (to deal freely with thee)
he could not, upon second
thoughts, gain leave of his Con∣science
to let it pass: for that told
him that he would shew but lit∣tle
love to his infinitely Good
God, or concernment for his Ho∣nour,
should he not take advan∣tage
of so fit and proper an occa∣sion

as was then offered him to
vindicate him from the most un∣worthy
Representation that Do∣ctrine
giveth of him. And he
solemnly professeth that he
would have said nothing of it,
were he not constrained to do o∣therwise
by his Love to God,
and the Souls of Men: And by
his earnest desire to give his Te∣stimony
against the abuse that is
thereby put upon the best of Bee∣ings,
& also to contribute his little
Mite towards the utter silencing
of that Plea for Carelesness and
Irreligion, that very many (if
not most) men from thence make.
Whoever they be that shall take
offence at that Person for freely
speaking his own mind, because it

hath the ill hap not to jump with
theirs, I would fain know of them
why he may not be as much out of
humour (though he is resolved he
will not) with them again: For
surely he doth not more differ from
them, than they do from him.
Well, Reader, it is high time
to be reconciled to Moderation
and Sobriety, to lay aside our un∣charitable
and (therefore) un∣christian
heats against each other:
And to labour to preserve the
Unity of the Spirit (if it be not
already quite lost) in the bond
of Peace, and throw water up∣on
those Flames that threaten our
destruction, (and but for God's
Infinite Mercy would have ef∣fected
it before now) instead of

adding more fewel to them. And
that is the great Design (as thou
wilt easily perceive) of the ensu∣ing
Discourse.
Moreover, I most humbly en∣treat
thee to consider, that as
God was not in the Whirlwind,
but in the still Voice; So Divine
Truth is far more unlikely to be
found among men of violent and
boisterous Passions, than among
those that are soberly and sedate∣ly
considerative. Passion doth
cloud and darken the understan∣ding,
it casts a thick mist before
the eye of the Soul, and makes it
altogether unapt to discern a dif∣ference
betwixt Truth, and the
error that is nearest to it; and to
distinguish it from one of the ex∣treams

which it lyeth between.
I have another Request to
make to thee, viz. If thou shalt
vouchsafe to cast an eye upon this
Discourse, that thou wouldest not
only read here and there some part
of it, but take the small pains to
run it through: For by this means
thou mayest understand the Au∣thors
sence in several Passages,
which otherwise thou wilt be lya∣ble
to be mistaken concerning:
And also to go away with a false
notion (in some Particulars) of
the Persons therein represented.
Whom, should they judge it an
over-bold attempt to give the
VVorld, without their own con∣sent
or knowledge, a Character of
them, he knows to be Masters

of so great ingenuity as will easi∣ly
encline them to put up such
faults (how great soever they
may seem in themselves) as are
mitigated by the Circumstance of
well-meaning.
The Author is aware that the
matters discoursed might have
been digested into a more accu∣rate
Method; but yet he is not
like to apologize for it, till thou
canst convince him, that the neg∣lect
of Formalities, and curious
exactness of any kind, in Dis∣courses
between Friends, is blame
worthy. Nor yet will he plead
excuse for the plainness of his
Style, till he hath reason to be∣lieve
that the Vulgar (whose
benefit is here principally in∣tended)

are capable of under∣standing
higher Language.
I shall detain thee no longer,
than till I have told thee, that he
saith, may this trifle be instrumen∣tal
to beget in but any one a more
free, ingenuous, and amicable
Temper, he shall not think he
hath cause to repent his permit∣ting
it to be exposed to publick
Censure.
