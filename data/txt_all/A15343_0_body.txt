AMongst the great, vnmeasurable and infinite bene∣fites, that GOD most rich in mercie and faithfull in performance, hath giuen vnto men of all estates and degrees, in this last (though worst) age of the world, as euident and infallible testimonies of his singular loue and bountie towards them, and as notable in∣struments to drawe and allure them soundly to knowe, vnfeignedlie to loue, and reuerently to feare him alone that is the only giuer there∣of: this in my poore iudgement (good Madame) seemeth vnto me (and I hope that others inlightned from God are of the same minde with me) not the least nor to be reckoned in the last place, namely, the excellent and most wonderfull light, not of manifold tongues onely, as Hebrew, Greeke, Caldee, Siriake, Latin, &c. neither yet of sundrie arts alone, as Grammar, Rhetoricke, Logicke, Musicke, Arithmetick, Geometrie, &c. but of the holy Scriptures and Christian religion spe∣ciallie: all which doubtles being heretofore through Sathans malice and mans ignorance, not cast aside amongst wormes and moathes, by little and little to wast and consume them; but sumptuouslie laied in graue, and deepely buried, & that almost without hope of quickning, God (that alwaies had and hath the fulnes of power in his hand) hath been pleased now at the last, for the ouerthrowe of superstition, ido∣latrie, and wicked life, and for the aduancement of his glorie, and fur∣therance of mens saluation, to recall as it were euen from the graue it selfe, and to reuiue from the dead. Wherin howsoeuer the Lord haue graciouslie vouchafed to declare his incomprehensible power, accom∣plishing so miraculous a worke, and to manifest his vnspeakable loue not onely in the multitude and varietie, but in the euidencie thereof; so that euen bleare eyed men & barbers (as is in the common by word) may cleerely perceiue the same, yet the strength of sinne hath so not onely obscured, but as it were defaced, though not the sight, yet the power and efficacie of Gods fauour, with the fruites and effects which should followe therevpon; that some through naturall blindnes and dimnes of their eyes, cannot behold them: other some againe through
 dumnes of mouth, and hauing their tongues tied, will not acknow∣ledge them: other some againe through want of good iudgement, do with polluted hands irreuerently receiue them, and almost all through prophanenesse of hart, & cursed corruption vnsanctifiedlie (if not irre∣ligiouslie) vse them. So fewe are there found in the world now adaies that profite by them to faith vnfeigned, and humble thankfulnes be∣fore him that plentifully hath prouided the same for their good, if they could tell how to accept and vse the same. The contemplation and memorie wherof (I willingly and vnfeignedly confesse it) leaueth behind it no small skarre, but a great wound rather in mine heart, and that not only so much for mine owne iniquitie in that behalfe (though I knowe the same to bee high and hainous) as for the common abo∣mination, that euery where as a mightie streame that will not be stop∣ped, and forcible floud that cannot be withstood, ouerfloweth all; and for the fearefull desolation that in all probabilitie and likelihood of mans iudgement will ensue therevpon, because howsoeuer God be of long suffering and of great goodnes, yet he cannot, nor will not (for we are sure he is zealous ouer his owne glorie) continuallie suffer the vile and abominable of the world to trample and tread vnder their beastlie feete his exceeding blessings and singular fauours. And yet I cannot hide this within my selfe, but must of necessitie breake foorth into the declaration thereof, that I am againe somewhat recomfor∣ted, in that whether soeuer I cast mine eyes whether at home or a∣broad, I certainlie beholde, and that without deceit of sight, some a∣mongst all estates and degrees of men, high, lowe, rich, poore, young, olde, noble, vnnoble, magistrates, ministers, and people, and sundrie of them of my Christian acquaintance, on whose behalfe I daylie offer vp vnto God through Christ the duetie of thanks giuing, perswading my self further, that there is vpon the face of the earth a mightie num∣ber besides (though not known to me) whom God hath pleased in the multitude of his mercies doubtles, and for much good towards them and others in them, not onely to single and cull out as it were from the huge heape and wicked fellowship of the polluted and prophane, but richlie to replenish and adorne them (as it were with most precious pearles) with the singular graces of sound knowledge, stedfast faith, comfortable feeling, vnfeigned obedience, and sundrie such like holie and heauenlie gifts. Amongst whom, your sexe rightly considered, and the place you haue been in wisely respected, and your present e∣state well weighed, I know few matchable with you (good Madame:
 flatterie is farre from my words, I humbly thanke God for it, & I hope pride remoued farre from your selfe in hearing your owne praise, as I wish enuie may bee from others as in regard of your due commenda∣tion) and not many to go beyond you. For though to be borne not on∣lie of worshipful parents, but of a sanctified stock, be some thing both before God and man: and though learned and holie education bee a good helpe towards the reformation of our corruption, and as it were the instilling of another nature into vs: and though to be richlie ioy∣ned in holy matrimonie be a token doubtles of Gods great fauour and loue: and though to haue in the vndefiled mariage bed, a blessed seed and lawfull issue, be a special blessing & mercie from God: & though to leade and liue a vertuous and vnreproueable life in the sight of men (who are wont neglecting themselues, with euill and curious eyes to looke vpon others) bee a happie thing: (with all which fauours you haue by the diuine prouidence, been euen laden as it were in your birth, bringing vp, youth, old age, virginitie, mariage, widowhood and posteritie) yet because many bee degenerate and start aside from their ancestors godlines: & some through carelesnes cause to perish the cost that hath been bestowed vpon them in good bringing vp: and others make themselues both in single and maried life lothsome to the Lord, and infamous before men, because either they haue not begun well, or haue not held on vnto the end: and other some by euill example, haue done the children of their wombe more hurt in the world, than they haue done them good in bringing them foorth to behold the light of the Sunne: and other some haue added to the weakenes of their sexe, not watchfulnes against sinne, as their duetie required, but laied the raines of their seuerall iniquities and manifold inticements to euill in their owne neckes: and many haue misused their places of honor and credit to all licentiousnes of the flesh, and carelesnes of God, and of the waies of his worship, and so consequently of eternal saluation: (from all which inconueniences and mischiefes the Lord hath mercifullie kept you in euerie condition of life wherein he hath been pleased to place you) me thinketh you haue wherein to reioyce, and that not on∣lie so much in the things themselues, freelie and plentifullie bestowed vpon you, as in the happie continuance and mightie encrease of these his goodnesses in you, you also hauing receiued grace from God to beautifie them with an vnblameable & holy conuersation. By meanes whereof it is come to passe, that as you are much beloued at home in the midst of Gods saincts and faithfull seruants here, and these not on∣lie
 common professors, but many worthie ministers: (for kindnes to∣wards whom, and particularlie towards my selfe, I doo humblie here in all our names thanke GOD, and you as his gracious instrument) so you are made truely famous abroad in forraine Churches and coun∣tries, & highly reuerenced of many worthie men there, indued doubt∣les with singular graces for Gods glory, and the building vp of the bo∣die of the fellowship of Saincts. But what meane I to enter into this broad field of your Christian commendation, where breath would rather faile me, and time I am sure, with abilitie to wade into it as I should, than matter any manner of way bee wanting. Giue me leaue therefore (good Madame) I beseech you to desist from your praise, (which I knowe you doo not willingly heare, though it be deserued as on your part, and though perhaps it might bee as a quicke spurre in the dull sides of others to prouoke them to good things) and to turne my speach to exhortation rather and comfort. The course that you are entered into, and the race that now you haue a long time runne in, is holie and honorable. Hold on therfore in the same chearefullie, not∣withstanding the manifold hinderances that within and without bee cast in your way to turne you aside, if it might be: and bee not wearie of well doing at any hand, for as you knowe that your profession re∣quireth it, so God hath promised that the time wil come wherein you shall reape (as the saincts of God haue done before you) if you faint not. Let the assured faithfulnes and infinite power of him, that hath in his word made you large promises, be a pricke vnto you herein. And forasmuch as he hath giuen you grace to begin well, and to hold on hetherto, doubt not, but he that hath both the will and the deed in his owne hands to bestowe them where and as it pleaseth him, will make perfect in you euery good worke, euen till the day of Iesus Christ. Is it possible, that that incorruptible crowne of eternall glorie, which in his onely beloued he hath prepared for you, should fade away? Vpon these things I beseech you (hauing cast away worldly cares) fixe cōti∣nuallie the eye of your faith, that you may end your old yeeres in the Lords peace, and be indeed gathered vnto your fathers comfortablie, saying, as that holie Apostle old Paule saied: I haue fought a good fight, I haue finished my course, I haue kept the faith: from henceforth there is laied vp for me the crowne of righteousnes, which the Lord the righteous Iudge shall giue me at that day; and not to me onely, but vnto all them also that loue his appearing. Your learned father, your honorable husband, your lo∣uing brother, your deare sisters some of them, and (if I bee not decei∣ued)
 some also of your owne holie seede (all of them hauing yeelded vp their spirites in the faith and feare of GOD) are I doubt not gone thether before you: and why should you your selfe, or any other thinke that you should be sundred from them? As for the lengthning of your life, aboue many before reckoned, surely God hath done it for his owne glorie, and the good of his Church, into which also you be∣ing religiouslie gathered as a sound member thereof, you haue euen in that an assured testimonie giuen vnto you, that warfaring here with his saincts as you doo, against sinne, the world and the diuell, you shall in good time, through him that hath loued you and washed you in his bloud, become more than a conquerour, and eternallie triumph toge∣ther with them and the rest in heauen. Till which time, as I rest resol∣ued, that God the author and perfecter of euery good thing in all his, will not withdrawe his gracious hand from you in any grace, speci∣allie spirituall and heauenlie: so I am certainlie perswaded that manie such as are led by his spirit, & know you in Christ Iesus, and loue you in the trueth, will not (GOD ayding them) neglect any duetie either outward or inward, that possiblie they can performe to further that worke. Amongst whom I, though the least and most vnworthie, as in respect of my selfe, yet tied thereto by the duetie of my profession from God, and bound to it by sundrie fauours receiued from you, will in my poore measure striue to do, though not so much as others, nei∣ther yet so much as I owe (which I freelie acknowledge as being pri∣uie to mine owne disabilitie and insufficiencie that way, and not vt∣terlie vnacquainted with other mens fulnes and vpheaped store) yet what God hath or shal be pleased to enable me to accomplish. Which that your good Ladiship may be the better assured of, I am bold now to present vnto you, and to publish vnder your name some short notes and meditations of mine (long since written for the dearest friend I had in the world) vppon that worthie booke of Salomons Prouerbes. What it is, I leaue to you, and the Church of GOD to iudge of: and yet this much I hope I may without pride protest, that though it bee not exquisite like vnto the worthie workes of manie Bezaleels in our age, yet it is sound; and though it bee not finelie polished, either in fit∣nes of wordes, or great store of arte, yet the trueth it is I hope, and ne∣uer a whit the more to be misliked, because it is naked and plaine, but the rather to be imbraced of Gods people; who I hope will shewe me
 this fauour, that as they wil not reiect any good thing in it for any euil that may be found or suspected to be therin, neither yet admit any euil for the goods sake, but in a discerning spirit refuse the one and receiue the other: so they will assist me with their praiers to God for the in∣crease of any good thing that is within me, to Gods glorie, and the be∣nefite of his people; and in much loue, according to the spirit of loue wherwith they are replenished, either Christianly couer that which is amisse, or curteouslie cure it. And as for you (good Madame) though I rest perswaded that it shall bee well accepted of you, yet can I not but againe & againe beseech you to receiue it, not only as from the hand, but as frō the heart of him, who, if either his poore praiers in absence, or speach in presence, or any thing els either within him or without him, could any many manner of way, either further you, or answere some part of that christian kindnes which he hath receiued from you, would not bee wanting in any duetie toward you or yours that GOD shal inable him to performe. Now the very God of peace sanctifie you throughout; and grant that your whole spirit, soule and bodie may be kept blameles vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ. London, the xxv. of this September. 1589.
