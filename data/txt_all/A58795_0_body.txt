My Lord,
I Here present to your Lordship the first Vo∣lume of a second Part of that Treatise of Christian Life, which I published some years since, and which under the Protection of your Venerable Name hath found good acceptance



with the World; and to make an ingenuous confession to your Lord∣ship, my design in this second Dedication is not purely to ren∣der you the due Respects of a Presbyter to his Diocesan; nor to tender those just Acknowledg∣ments I ow to your Lordship for the happiness I have enjoy'd, with the rest of your Clergy, under the auspicious Influence of your se∣rene and watchful Govern∣ment; no nor yet to express the grateful sense I have, and shall always retain, of the personal Obligations you have laid upon me; no, my Lord, though these were all of them sufficient Induce∣ments, yet I confess that together



with these I had a certain Poli∣tick end in my eye. For I thank God I can truly say my main De∣sign in composing this Treatise was to benefit the World; but reflecting upon the manifold de∣fects it abounds with after all the pains I had bestowed upon it, I found that, to palliate its internal blemishes, it was but needful to grace it with some external Or∣nament, and could think of none so proper for my purpose as this of affixing your Lordships Name to it; a Name that carries with it power enough to recommend any thing to the World that is but pi∣ous, and honest, and well-de∣signed, and all that, I am sure,



this is, how defective soever it be in other respects; which toge∣ther with the experience I have had of the great candor and be∣nignity of your Lordships tem∣per, gives me encouragement to hope that you will not only accept but approve it; and then I am sure your Lordships approbati∣on will give it credit and au∣thority enough with the World to enable it to effect those good and honest ends for which it was sincerely intended by
