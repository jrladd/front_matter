My LORDS,
WHen I seriously reflect upon the stupendious Providence of the Al∣mighty, in bringing to pass the late and unpresidented Under∣taking of his Highness the Prince of Orange, now King of Great Bri∣tain,
 I cannot do less than Com∣memorate those Noble Persons, that both favour'd and joyn'd in so good a Work, among whom your Honours had a considerable share, which made me prefume to lay this short Compendium of that Expedition at your Feet, hum∣bly craving your candid Accep∣tation and Patronage of it, (tho' not varnish'd with quaintness of Phrase, or Elegancy of Wit and Rhetorick, but in a lame and plain Stile). Your Honours are not insensible how near we were to Ruine, nor how his Sacred Majesty King WILLIAM, ha∣zarded all that was dear, for our good, which should oblige the most ungrateful to make some answerable returns of Gratitude and Loyalty. Your Honours have
 fully convinced the World of your uprightness and steadiness in this Cause. All that I can say cannot add to, but will rather de∣tract from your Honours innate Worth and Goodness I heartily wish this good Work, so far alrea∣dy advanced, may be fully com∣pleated, so that we may have no reason to fear a relapse. And that the God of Heaven may preserve our gracious King and Queen, and prosper their good Inten∣tions with suitable success, and convert all their Enemies, or make them fall before them, is the daily Prayers of,
May it please your Honours,
