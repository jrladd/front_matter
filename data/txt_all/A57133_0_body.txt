SIR,
IT hath not been without a special
providence of God, that this Ser∣mon
preached above a year and an
half since, at the Funeral of your
most religious Lady, should now
by your earnest desire, come abroad
unto publick view. For hereby a just Accompt is
given to the world of those deep and permanent Im∣pressions
of Love, Sorro and Honour, which the me∣mory
of so matchless a Consort have made upon your
soul, when a wound so long since inflicted, doth not
yet cease to bleed afresh upon the continually recurring
thoughts of so inestimable a loss. I have read in the
Civil Law, That if a woman married again before
the expiration of ten moneths after the death of her
former Husband, she did Subire maculam Infamiae:
But after such a space of time, it was presumed she
might overcome the pressures of so great a sorrow,
and yet still retain her Honour. You have passed
over double that time, and yet not at all out of an
unmanly softness, but out of a just and most judicious
esteem of those eminent graces, which did so beautifie

the soul, and perfume the name of that excellent La∣dy,
you do, not without redoubled Honour, often resume
the view and sense of that divine stroak whereby you
were deprived of so unvaluable a Treasure. Nor
am I my self without a special Advantage acrewing
unto me by this Publication, having so good an op∣portunity
to let the world know that great debt of Ho∣nour,
Love and Thankfulness wherein I stand bound
to your noble Father, your self, and all the branches
of that worthy Family for those many Favours, those
real and great bounties, which ever since I have had
the Honour of an acquaintance with you, have been,
and yet are enmulated upon me: I have no other way
of paying back the Tribute which I ow to you all,
then by beseeching the God of Grace to make all his
Grace abound towards you all, and plentifully to sup∣ply
you with the choicest f his heavenly Treasures,
according to his Riches in Glory by Jesus Christ,
which is the unfained prayer of
