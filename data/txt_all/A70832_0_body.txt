My Lord,
YOUR Lordship's Universal Skill in Languages, is so well known to the World, that it may appear a Presumption in the high∣est Degree, to lay this Translation at the Feet of so great a Judge, both as to the Faithfulness of the Version, and the Purity of the Expression. But when I consider, that Your Character is as Eminent for Charity and Candor, as for all manner of Literature, I eck∣on
 my self safe under the Favor and Protection of so much Generosity and Goodness; especially, where the Dif∣ficulty of the Work, will in some Mea∣sure excuse the Imperfections of it: For, it is a Thing utterly impossible, for an English Traduction to come up to the Life and Force of this Illustrious Origi∣nal, and to reach the Inimitable Excel∣lency of our Author's Thoughts and Conceptions. Insomuch, that whe∣ther we consider the Glorious Lives of so many Great and Gallant Men, which Plutarch has set forth with a Spirit equal to the Dignity of their Actions; or, whether we reflect upon the Phi∣losophy of his Morals, where we find many Things in his Physical Remarks, that for want of a true Key, may seem
 somewhat obscure to the Age we live in; it will be a hard Matter to support the Credit of this Undertaking.
But, my Lord, whatever Diminu∣tion this Author may have suffer'd by those that have adventur'd to expose him to the World in our Language, he is yet more than recompens'd under the Patronage of so great an Orna∣ment, both of the English Church and Nation, which shall ever be acknow∣ledged with Infinite Reverence and Gratitude, by
My Lord,
