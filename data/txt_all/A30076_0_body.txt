Right Honourable,
HAD those worthy Gentlemen been so happie, to have laboured for the set∣ling a iust & equall Government, and designing the best advantages, as in discovering the Countrey, this labour had beene spared; Wherefore he humbly prayes, that you'l looke on this Piece as through a Prospective, by which you have these places rendred at a neerer distance, & you may easily find the impediments of their happinesse; which, with as much ease as turning of the Glasse, you may remove farre off, or out of sight: I must confesse, 'tis some bold∣nesse for a private person to deale with Govern∣ments; but when you shall finde I speake your thoughts, for having lustice impartially dealt, and this from a smarting sence of iniustice done, I am confident you'l excuse me, and the rather, for that I have shortned your Lordships studies, which as I have often heard, are for settling such a Government in these places, as might keep the Ballance even: and if your Lordships, upon per∣usall, shall find me onely to aime at the Generall good, I am confident you'l owne me to be,
