O Thou holy one of Israel, and preserver of men; I the worst of thy creatures, all sullied with the dirt and blood of my own, and the sins and Transgressions of my poor Family, do here offer up to thee the sacrifice of thy beloved Son, and dejection of my sinful heart, beg∣ging of thee humbly, but earnestly, not to marke strictly what is done amiss (being of purer eyes) but on the former, being an Oblation sufficient for the sins of the whole world. O great God of wisdome, and Lord of Hosts, renew thy holy Spi∣rit in me, purifie me throughout; and as thou hast preserved me to this, teach me, not onely to glo∣rifie thy Sacred Name, but also as thou hast (at first faint desire upon occasion) taught my hands to War, and fingers to Fight; so now teach my heart to indite a good matter, and make my Pen the Pen of a ready Writer: and whereas formerly a Petitioner to earthly gods, whose breath is in their nostrils, so now to thee onely, that it may turne thine eyes from my sin, to thy own righteousness. O thou that art my onely true beloved now in the
Cloud, proclaim thy holy Name as in former dayes, The Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keep∣ing mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and trans∣gression and sin: O reserve yet a good proportion of mercy for thy Israel: why should they be de∣stroyed by worse then themselves? make them all, O God, seek and finde thy Kingdome, and then ad∣minister to them all good things: Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my strength and my Redeemer. Thus begging of thee to hasten all that is convenient to thy poor afflicted people, and thy most unwor∣thy servant, I desire to render to thy blessed Name but what is most due; all honour, praise, glory, Power, and Dominion, now and ever.
