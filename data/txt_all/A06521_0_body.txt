COnsydering (right VVorshipfull) that saying of Dauid
alleaged by the Apostle Paul, that there is none that vnderstandeth, none
that see∣keth after God, that all are gone out of the vvay and become
vn∣profitable: me thinkes it doth liue∣ly set forth the blindnesse of
mans vnderstanding, the vvickednesse of his vvill, and his peruersnes
and vnhabilitie vnto that vvhich is good. VVhereof if vve had not many
testimonies of Scripture, yet common experience vvere able to confirme the
same, vvhen vve daily see men so carefull to liue, and so carelesse
to liue vvell. Hovvbeit this is no meruell: for as a tree vvhose roote is
rotten and infected vvith venimous sappe, bringeth forth none but corrupt and
naughty frute: so from mans hart vvhich is corrupt and infected vvith the
venim of sinne, can proceede nothing that is good.
Novv mans vnderstanding being blinde, he is not able of him
selfe to attaine to the knovvledge of God, and conse∣quently vvithout
some other meanes or helpe can not be sa∣ued: for this, as our Sauiour in
the Gospell sayth, is life euer∣lasting, to knovv one onely true God, and
him vvhom he hath sent Iesus Christ. Againe, mans vvill being corrupt, he
is not  able to serue God as his dutie requireth, as to honour
him as his Lord, to obey him as his father, to trust in him as his Pro∣tector
and preseruer, to be thankefull to him for his infinite benefites, &c.
VVherefore leste man being ignorant of God should be excluded from
saluation, or lest through the vvic∣kednes of his vvill and inclination to
euill, he should disho∣nour so high a Lord, disobey so good a father,
distrust so care∣full a preseruer, and be vnthankefull to so gracious
a giuer, vvho doth not see hovv requisite and needefull it is, that he
should by good instructions be brought to the knovvledge of the Lorde God,
and by godly exhortations and admonitions be reclaimed from his vvicked vvayes
to the performance of his dutie? Novv forasmuch as God hath in his vvord
reuea∣led so much of him selfe as is expedient for man to knovv, & hath
therein also prescribed that maner of seruing him vvhereof be accepteth,
man must out of it learne the true knovvledge and right seruice of God, and
therefore most ne∣cessary it is that this vvord be preached & taught,
that ther∣by man may learne to knovv God, and truely to vvorship & serue
him being knovvne. So shall his minde be enlightened vvith diuine knovvledge,
and his vvill reformed according to Gods vvil, so shall this vvord be a
lanterne vnto his feete, and a light vnto his paths, vvhereby he may be
directed in al his vvayes. But (alas) this is a thing to be lamented, that the
haruest is great, but the labourers are fevv. For among them vvhich supply
the places of labourers in the Lordes haruest, some there be vvho doe vvith
diligence discharge their du∣tie, many moe there are, vvho albeit they be
able, yet doe ey∣ther quite neglect it, or very sclēderly execute it, but
greatest is the number of them, vvho for lacke of skil & knovvledge are
not able at all to performe it. VVherefore there is great neede to pray the
Lord of the haruest, that he vvill send forth labourers into his haruest,
vvhereby many moe then doe may receiue the Gospell of Christ Iesus euen
to the saluation of  their soules.
The premisses vvell vveyed, I thinke (right VVorship∣full)
there may a sufficient reason be gathered, vvhy I did purpose the
publishing of these Sermons of D. Martin Lu∣ther in our vulgar tongue, and
vvhy at the last I haue by some labour and paynes brought the sayd
purposed publishing to passe. I vvas in deede at the first procured
thereunto by a learned Father of this lande, vvhose vvordes and iudgement I
make no small account of, but aftervvard entring into dee∣per consideration
of the matter, and vveying on the one side the great ignorance of many euen
in matters of saluation, to∣gither vvith the dayly dishonouring of God by
vngodly life: and on the other side the diuine doctrine and most vvholsom
exhortations vvhich these Sermons conteine, I vvas more forcibly stirred vp
thereunto, and thought that the painefull perusing of them, and frutefull
follovving of that vvhereof they entreat, vvould be a souereigne salue to
help to cure such daungerous diseases. For by them may they learne to
knovv one onely true God, and vvhom he hath sent Iesus Christ, and the
infinit riches vvhich are comprised in him, and offered vnto vs through him
of God his Father: that he humbled him selfe to exalt vs, that he became a
seruaunt to set vs at liber∣tie, that he vvas empouerished to make vs rich,
that he dyed for our sinnes, & rose again for our iustification, that
through his meanes mercie hath svvallovved vp miserie, and bounty hath
ouercome all euill, finally that vvithout him there is no ioy nor
consolation, no peace nor quietnes, no felicitie nor sal∣uation, but that
he is the onely meanes by vvhich all good thinges are attained: so that they
vvhich enioy him receiue not one gift alone, as vvith Salomon vvisedom, vvith
Sam∣son strength, vvith Iob patience, vvith Paule zeale, &c: but for
pouertie they receiue riches, for vveakenes strength, for folly vvisedom,
for seruitude freedom, for griefe ioy, for sinne righteousnes, for death
life, yea all good thinges vvhat∣soeuer.
VVherefore if the faithfull man be pressed vvith
pouer∣tie, he may here learne that by Christ he is adopted to be the Sonne of
God, and so may be comforted, saying to him selfe: Hovv can he be poore
vvhich hath God to his Father? vvho both is able to giue all thinges
necessary, for his is the earth and all that therein is, and also vvill
giue the same, because he is most louing and gracious to his children.
Againe, if he feele in him selfe vveaknes, he may learne here that he is not
able of him selfe to attaine vnto strength, but that it is the gift of
Christ, vvho strengtheneth such as beleeue in him, & so may be
stirred vp by harty prayer to aske the same of him, that he vvill
vouchsafe by his holy spirit to strengthen and confirme him, that he may
be able to performe that by grace, vvhich by nature and of him selfe he shall
neuer be able to doe: as mightely to subdue the rebellious flesh, strongly
to re∣sist, and at the last valiauntly to ouercome the tentations of
Satan, patiently to beare the troubles of the vvorld, and con∣stantly to
contemne the allurements of the same. Moreouer, if he thirst after diuine
and heauenly vvisedom, (vvhich is to knovv God aright, and those thinges
that are necessary to be knovvne to the attaining of saluation) he may
finde here largely and liuely set forth, that Christ came his Fathers
Em∣bassadour and Messenger to men, that by him they might be brought to
the right knovvledge of God, and into all truth, so that by him vve are
enlightened vvith the knovvledge of God, by him vve are instructed in all
truth, and consequently by him vve obtaine diuine and heauenly vvisedom.
Here al∣so shall he learne that Christ vvas made vnder the lavve, that he
might redeeme them vvhich vvere in bondage vn∣der the lavve, & of seruile
bondmen make them free sonnes, euen the children of God.
Furthermore, if griefe and heauines come vpon him, he is here
taught vvhere true ioy may be had, euen in Christ  Iesus alone,
that in him onely he may fynde sure comfort, so∣uereigne medicines,
present remedie, true ioy of heart and quietnes of conscience. Finally,
vvhereas vve are synnefull, and haue by our synnes iustly deserued Gods
eternall vvrath and most heauie vengeance, he shall here learne that Christ
hath payed the ransome for our synnes, and pacified Gods most grieuous
vvrath and displeasure iustly conceiued against vs. And because it is
not sufficient that due satisfaction be made for synnes, and Gods vvrath
appeased, but vve must also ap∣peare righteous before God, it is here
shevved, that as by one mans disobedience many vvere made synners, so by
the obe∣dience of one, namely of Iesus Christ, as many as beleeue in him
shalbe made righteous, inasmuch as his righteousnes is imputed to them as
their ovvne, vvhereby they appeare per∣fectly righteous before God, and are
accepted of him: so that vvhereas they had of themselues deserued
eternall death, they are through Christ accounted vvorthie of euerlasting
life. But vvhat doe I goe about to rehearse the infinite trea∣sures vvhich
the faithfull enioy through Christ? it shall be sufficient to conclude
vvith the Apostle Paule, and say: If God spared not his ovvne Sonne, but
gaue him for vs all to death, hovv shall he not vvith him giue vs all thinges
also?
Novv forasmuch as these thinges, and the right meanes to
attaine vnto them, are in these Sermons of that most lear∣ned Diuine Martin
Luther most learnedly, yea euen diuine∣ly set forth, they may vndoutedly be
a singular meane, not onely to instruct them vvhich be ignorant in matters
of sal∣uation, but also to increase and confirme the knovvledge of
such, as haue already vvell profited in Christian religion. Hovvbeit there
is annexed hereunto sound and absolute do∣ctrine concerning good vvorkes
and godly conuersation, as being most necessary to be of all
Christiās perfectly knovvne, and effectually follovved. For Christians
through Christ being become the Sonnes of God, hovv vnmeete, yea hovv 
 abhominable a thinge is it that they should resemble Satan in
their doinges? being novv made the members of Christ, hovv detestable a
thing is it that they should be instruments of iniquitie? being novv the
temple of the holy Ghost, hovv beastly a thinge vvere it to defyle the
same vvith the filthi∣nes of synne? Finally hauing receiued so many and
so great benefites of God through Christ, hovv vvicked and shame∣full a
thinge should it be, to be vnthankefull to so gracious a God, to be
disobedient to so louing a Father, in any vvise to displease so
mercifull a Sauiour? But it shalbe needelesse much to stand vpon this
point, seeing it is not vnknovvne to the faithfull vvith hovv great endeuour
they ought to auoyde that vvhich is euill, and embrace that vvhich is good, and
therefore shall syncere & perfect doctrine concerning good vvorkes be
vnto them no lesse commodious and profitable, then needefull and
necessarie.
For the causes aboue specified especially among other, I
haue (right VVorshipfull) though not finely, yet faithfully translated
these Sermons into our vulgar tounge, and haue done myne endeuour for the
publishing of the same, vvhich I doe humbly dedicate to your VVorships
protection, by your zealous godlines and godly zeale chiefly moued thereunto,
vvhereby I am induced to thinke that you vvill vvell ac∣cept of them. For as
the godly do vvith Dauid delight in the Arke of the Couenant, in the Tabernacle
of the Lord, in the holy Mount Sion, that is, in the Church of God: so doe
they vvith the same Dauid desyre the building of this house of God, the
florishing of this vine, the peace and prosperitie of this heauenly
Ierusalem, and therefore that vvhich is a meane and furtherance hereunto they
doe not onely loue and like, but also hiely esteeme, and hartily praye for.
VVhere∣fore (right VVorshipfull) I thinke it altogether superfluous to goe
about vvith vvordes to procure your vvell liking and accepting of these
Sermons, forasmuch as they tend onely to  this ende, that the
Church of God may by them be edified, as in the premisses is of me
declared. VVhereas in translating them I haue vsed a plaine kynde of
stile (yet such as suffi∣ciently expresseth the meaning of the
author) and not stu∣died for curious vvordes & eloquēt phrases, the
cause there∣of is, for that I preferre plainnesse vvith profit, before
much curiositie vvith smaller commoditie, so that I nothinge at all feare
that in this respect they shalbe misliked of the godly, vvhose
misliking onely I endeuour to auoide.
Thus (as it seemes vnto me) hauing intreated sufficient∣ly of
those thinges vvhich I thought pertinent to my pre∣sent purpose, I doe
here conclude, desyring the Lord God, that he vvill by his holy Spirit
alvvayes gouerne and direct you in the true obedience of his blessed
vvorde, to the glorie of his diuine Name, to the profit of your neighbours, and
comfort of your conscience, so shall you assuredly haue pro∣sperous
successe in all your affayres, and at the last obtaine euerlasting
ioyes and endlesse felicitie, by the onely meanes of Christ Iesus our
Sauiour.
