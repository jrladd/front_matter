THrice-hopefull Earnest of a Royall Race,
Whom Art and Nature, to returne Compleate,
Haue pray'd the Aide of a Diuiner Grace,
Whereby thou art a Prince, as Good, as Great;
Nature and Art haue both been proud e're since,
In their Composure of so Rare a Prince.


Rare Prince,
Oh! let the Influence of thy quickning Ray
Affect these faint, and indisposed Lines,
That they may flourish, as the Child of May,
And clime, like fresh Aurora's Eglentines;
That, by the smell, the World may know, this Flowre
Hath had th' aspect of such a Sunne, as You are.



Before the Luster of so pure a Light,
My prostrate heart (swolne big with Loyaltic)
Presents this Legend of a sad Delight;
Which if made Glorious with thy pleased Eyc,
My Workes are crowned with like Honour, done
By Princely Caesar, and his Princely Sonne.
