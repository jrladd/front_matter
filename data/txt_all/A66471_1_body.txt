Valorons and Victorious Martialists,
IT was the pleasure of Almighty God, as being the Tutor of Valiant Da∣vid and other Famous Worthies, of Heroick Spirits, before he instructed them in the Art of Military Discipline, by teaching their Hands to War and their Fingers to Fight (being Atchievements fit for Combatants, and such as are train'd in Gladiatory Affairs) to assume unto his Sacred self the Champion Title of a Man of War, in Exod. 15.8. where his Servant Moses declares in the same Scripture, that the Lord is his Name: Thereby importing that Power, Courage, Success, Victory and Triumph, are all of them Endowments proper and peculiar to God alone; though by his Condescensive and Permissive Pleasure a communicative Respect in a participative manner (having its Com∣mission from himself) is supernaturally instrumental, in causing admiring Mor∣tals to Praise God, and to Blazon the Braveryes, Adorn the Acts, or Fame the Feats of Military Men. This sort of Martial Honour eminently appear'd in the Publick and Princely persons of Saul and David, whose magnanimous and magnificent Victories over their numerous Adversaries embellished the Tro∣phies of their Conquering Triumphs, with resounding Acclamations of Royal Renown and Popular Applause, which as lasting monuments of their Hostile Exploits are Register'd (to inform all Humane Posterities) in the Canonical
Chronicle of Sacred Histories, witness the first Book of Samuel, Chap. 29 Ver. 5. where it is reported—That the Israelites sang one to another in Dances, saying, That Saul slew his Thousands, and David his Ten Thou∣sands, to Memorize the Fame of Fate and Fortitude.
This Accompt of the Slain amounting to Thousands, and Ten Thousands, seems to intimate an unknown, innumerable, or numberless number; but as to the Armies or Militia that were destroy'd by the Generals, Chieftains, Centu∣rions, and Soldiers of David, we find that the Divine Warriour ascrib'd the Success which attended his Arms and Weapons of Warfare, to the concurring and corroborating Power of God, as it is apparently evident in the words of my present Text, where he speaks these Couragious and Religious Expressions, —Through God we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down our Enemies. The Valiant Acts here mention'd, or Valour derivative (in this Verse from God to Men) I Christianly Conjecture was Experimentally ob∣serv'd by many Worthies, to whom I Dedicate this Epistle, in their Warlike Enterprizes relating to the late Affairs of Ireland and Flanders, who with the rest here hinted, may lay a just Claim to the Discourse issuing from the fol∣lowing Subject; which having the Approbation of numerous attentive Audi∣tors, and also their Importunity to have it made publick for the Benefit of the Army, I have by forcible Obligations yielded to the sway of prevalency, and adventur'd (as far as Moderation allow'd me) to comply with their reasona∣ble Request: And if it meet with some Thwarting and Carping Dispositions of Captious or Conceited Criticks, too much intermedling and busying themselves in this Censorious Age, I assign Armed Men, whose Cause and Right it is, both to Patronize and Defend its Innocency, leaving such Causless Quarrellers on the Forlorn Hope of doing Injury, either to Ministerial or Martial Authority. In ample Satisfaction or full Assurance whereof, I commit the Army, the Fleet, my Self, and all that desire the Welfare of our Three Kingdoms, to God's Gracious Protection and Providence; remaining,
