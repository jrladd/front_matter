Right Worshipfull,
IT cannot but be most true of our times, that the blessed Apostles spake al∣most sixteene hundred yeares since; 1 Iohn 2.18. Hora est nouissima; The last houre is now a running. And, 1 Cor. 10.11. wee are those on whom the ends of the world are fallen. Towards the end whereof, we were also long since forewarned by our Sa∣uiour himselfe, That Matth. 24.12. Charitas refriguit valdè circa ifla tempora in ni statu: & iniquitas plus solito caepit abundare. Fascicul. temp. ad an. 879. Iniquity should grow rife, and Charitie waxe cold. That

which had it not beene foretold vs, yet Reason might enforme vs, and our own daily Experience doth too euidently enforce on vs. For .

I need not make any long appeale to Ex∣perience, for the iustification of this Charge. For the rifenesse of Iniquitie, of all kinde with all sorts; Quando etenim vberior vitiorum copia?

And the generall broiles as this instant in all parts almost of Christen∣dome, may well perswade vs, that euen the . Apoc. 8.2. bottomlesse pit is broken vp, and set o∣pen; and Apoc 20.3, 7.

Saluian, de prouid. l. 6. c. 7. A great coldnesse, and a strange numnesse indeed,

arguing an vtter want of zeale to Gods Truth, and loue to his flock, when nothing affecteth men, but what they personally feele, or feare may befall themselues. Yea euen a∣mong those few, to speak of, that seeme to take these things to heart, hard it is to finde a fel∣low-feeling affection any thing proportiona∣ble to the occasion giuen of it, or such as could not but possesse vs, were spirituall life and heat so fresh, and so vigorous in vs as it ought.

Censer, and in that regard not mine owne. Which howsoeuer it may seeme, be∣ing so little as it is, likely of it selfe to do little: (And yet . Eu∣stath. ad Hm.

Did not our hearts glow within vs, while hee talked with vs?) Howsoeuer, I say, of it selfe it may be deemed vnlikely to doe ought; yet it may doe something, and not a little, by prouoking some others, better stored in this kinde then my selfe, to bring in greater plenty of fewell, toward the raising, maintaining, and feeding of this Fire. Some little effect. I found of it, (which the rather encourageth mee now to publish it) by some that seemed to be affe∣cted with it at that time, when it was deliue∣red in your Worships hearing among others. Since which time, the notes of it lay by me, not looked after, among my loose papers, till of late requested to reuise M. W. Teelinck of Middlebrough his Ballance of the Sanctuarie. the worke of a Reue∣rend Diuine, somewhat of the like subiect, translated out of his owne language, wherein he writ it, into ours; (which worke I wish had lighted on a more skilfull Translator) I was therby put in mind of them, and hauing as well as I now could (being aboue a twelue-month since it was preached) by helpe of mine owne

memory, and the notes of some that then writ, supplied them, and so farre foorth perfected them, as my present imployments would per∣mit, I thought good to adde this my Sparke to that Fire, which that worthy man had so hap∣pily begun to kindle, and I wish many others may second him and me in. That being so done, I make bold to present vnto your Worship, partly as to one that are, I doubt not, affected seriously with Iosephs Afflictions; and will therfore, I presume, like well of the Argument therein dealt with; and partly also as to one, from whom I haue at diuers times receiued sundrie fauours and kindnesses, my thankful∣nesse for which, I doe willingly take occasion hereby to acknowledge. Wherewith conclu∣ding, I leaue your Worship to Gods gratious protection, and rest
