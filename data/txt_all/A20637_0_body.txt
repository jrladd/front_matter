Most dread and gracious Soveraigne,
IN this rumor of VVarre I am bold to present to your sacred Majestie the fruits of Peace, first planted by the hand of your most Royal Father, then ripened by the same gracious influence, and since no lesse cherisht and protected by your Ma∣jesties especiall favour vouchsafed to the Author in so many indulgent testimonies of your good acceptance of his ser∣vice: VVhich grace from your Majestie, as he was known to ac∣knowledge with much comfort whilst he lived, so will it give now some excuse to the presumption of this Dedication, since those friends of his, who think any thing of his worthy to out-live him, could not preserve their piety to him, without taking leave to in∣scribe the same with your Majesties sacred Name, that so they may at once give so faire a hope of a long continuance both to these VVorks of his, and to his gratitude, of which they humbly desire this Book may last to be some Monument.

I shall not presume in this place to say much of these Sermons; on∣ly this, They who have been conversant in the VVorks of the holiest men of all times, cannot but acknowledge in these the same spirit with which they writ; reasonable Demonstrations every where in the subjects comprehensible by reason: as for those things which can∣not be comprehended by our reason alone, they are no where made easier to faith then here; and for the other part of our nature, which consists in our Passions, and in our Affections, they are here raised, and laid, and governed, and disposed, in a manner, according to the Will of the Author. The Doctrine it selse which is taught here, is Primitively Christian; The Fathers are every where here consul∣ted, with reverence, but Apostolicall Writings onely appealed to as the last Rule of Faith. Lastly, such is the conjuncture here of zeal and discretion, that whilst it is the main scope of the Author in these Discourses, that Glory be given to God, this is accompanied every where with a scrupulous care and endeavour, that Peace be like∣wise setled amongst men.
The leave and encouragement I have had for the publishing these Sermons from the Person most intrusted by your Majestie in the go∣vernment of the Church, and most highly dignified in it, I think I ought in this place to mention for his honour, that they who receive any benefit from hence, may know in part to whom to acknowledge it; and that this, what ever it is, is owing to him to whom they stand otherwise so deeply engaged for his providence and care (next un∣der your Majestie) over the Truth, and Peace, and Dignity of the Church of England, for which he will not want lasting acknowledg∣ments amongst Wise and Good Men.
And now having with all humblenesse commended these Sermons to your sacred Majestie, from the memory of the Author, your Ser∣vant, from the nature and piety of the Work it self, and lastly, from the encouragement I have had to give it this light, did I not feare to adde to my presumption, I should in this place take leave to expresse the propriety betwixt your Majesties royall Vertues, and the tri∣bute of such an Offering and acknowledgement as this; A Work of Devotion to the most exemplarily pious Prince; a Work of modera∣ted, and discreet zeale, to the Person of the most governed affecti∣ons, in the midst of the greatest power; a Work of deep-sighted know∣ledge,
to the most discerning spirit; a VVork of a strict doctrine, to the most severe imposer upon himselfe; and a VVork of a charitable do∣ctrine, to the most indulgent Master of others: But I dare not enter into this Argument, these excellencies requiring rather tacite vene¦ration, then admitting any possible equall expression; and therefore with my prayer for your Majesties long and happy raigne over us, I humbly aske pardon for this presumption of
