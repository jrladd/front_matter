TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL The Major, Recorder, Aldermen, Common-Council, and the rest of the Citizens of the Ancient City of CARLILE, THEOPHILVS POLWHEILE Presenteth this his Treatise of SELF-DENIALL, PARTLY As an expression of his reall and unfeigned Thankfulnesse for the many favours which hee received (both while he was a
STUDENT in the University, and afterwards a PREACHER in their CITY) from divers of them:
BUT CHIEFLY As a Testimony of his exceeding great and earnest desire of the Spiritual and Eternal good of THEM all.
