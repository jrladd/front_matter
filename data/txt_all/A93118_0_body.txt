GENTLEMEN.
I May perhaps have been so long out of your sight that I may be also by this time out of your minde. Ne∣verthelesse it is not out of my mind, that I having received the seed and growth of that little knowledge in the lawes of this kingdome which God hath given me in the seed-plot of your ancient and honorable So∣ciety, doe no lesse (by a naturall equity) owe the fruit thereof to you then the Rivers doe their tri∣bute to the Ocean, and the trees their fruit to the planters and pruners. This therefore (such as it is) although unworthy of so great a name, I am bold to dedicate to you, and put forth under the shelter of your favourable wings; beseech∣ing you to accept thereof, and my well meaning therein, and to honour it with your patronage and countenance. And it shall much oblige,
(Gentlemen,)
