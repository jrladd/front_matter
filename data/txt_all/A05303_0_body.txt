Most gratious and dread Soveraigne;
AS it is a duty imposed vpon parents by Na∣ture, to provide for the education and maintenance of their infants: so it is a pri∣viledge allowed vnto the studious, both by reason and custome: to secure the fruits of their studies from the detractions of the envious, by the countenaunce and patronage of some great personages, either excellent for their vertues, or eminent for their greatnesse. Vpon this ground (as also vpon some other speciall inducements) I have presumed to
present vnto your Highnes this Treatise touching the Apparition of Spirits: and discoursing of the Nature, properties and power, both of Angels, Divels, Sorcerers, Witches, and such like. One of the speciall reason; inducing me herevnto, is: for that as the first Authour thereof, a Frenchman and a Civill Lawyer, did dedicate it to the Queene mother of Fraunce Katherine de Medicis, a great Princesse: to whom (it seemeth) in regard of his particular preferment he was specially obliged: so my selfe, his like in profession (though wanting the meanes of like hope and fortune) had a desire that this French stranger (now made an English Denison) might soiourne here vnder the royall protection of your Greatnesse: whose excellency of puissance, surpassing knowledge, and princely vertues exempted from comparison, have made you observed of the greatest, admired of the wi∣sest, and endeered in the love and hearts of all good men.
A second Motive was, the desire of the partie by whose Motion I vndertooke to bring him ac∣quainted with the English: who being a man worthily regarded of the best, and not vnknown to your Maiestic, did wish to have him presen∣ted to your Highnesse. The third and last (though not the least cause) which drew both our desires to concurre in this point, was: that I may vse his owne wordes written to a great Peere of this Realme, touching this Treatise: Because your Maiestie hath heretofore most religiously and lear∣nedly written of this Argument, and hath con∣cluded, That Witches are the generation of Vipers,
and the seede of the wicked Serpent: whose head you have also bruised, both by divine lawe, and by Act of Parliament. Wherefore seeing this straunger is not onely a professed foe to all these damned artes, and diabolicall illusions of Witches, Sorce∣rers, and Coniurers, and to all their fauourers and adherents: but like a stoute and most worthie Champion, hath also overthrowne all their for∣ces, and troden their defences vnder foote: All these reasons put togither, do yeeld me a full assu∣rance, that as your Highnesse is best able, so you will most graciously bee pleased to patronize and protect him; and the rather, because he is a straun∣ger. This fauour if your most excellent Maiestie shall vouchsafe him: for mine owne part, as my heart was long since vowed yours in all dutie, love, and fidelitie; so my soule shall power it selfe foorth in prayers for the blessed preserva∣tion of your Maiestie in all happines, both of temporall and eter∣nall felicitie.
