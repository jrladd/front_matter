Right Honourable;
HAving presented the first part of my en∣deavours of this nature to an honoura∣ble Peer, and finding his noble accep∣tance with respect in the world, above the desert of the Authur, or merit of the work, which with some other encouragements made me bold to tender this second Part, as a free-will offe∣ring (in love) to your Lordship: being ambitious that it should beare the name of so truly a noble Patron (honour ed of all) who have beene and still is such a great pillar to uphold this tottering State, whose gal∣lant, faithfull, and successfull service, will render you famous to all posterity.

I confesse the humble wing of my Muse lights upon a low-borne Subject, yet modestly possest with fury, in the midst of temptations, keeps her Virgin beauty; al∣though she hath to doc with the workes of darknesse, (ripened with the corruption of these times) yet your Lordship may justly judge it too light for your serious meditations. However I doubt not but it may prevaile in the intermission of  employments, so as to in∣vite a favourable looks from your Honour, which will preserve it from the  of envy.
I am not so soobe-hardy, as to plead the worth of my Muse, whereby to match her to the mits of the time; (nor will she think her self preferred by it, unlesse they be wisely honest as well as ) but her true intention free from flatterie, trimmed in a plaine dresse, only som∣what of a strange new fashion: yet so, as the fancies may be pleasing to some, the discoveries, usefull to o∣thers, and the moralls profitable to all, who will consi∣der them.
All which I leave to your Lordships protection, and you, to him that will never leave you, till he hath gi∣ven you the complement of all . So prayes he that desires to subscribe himselfe,
