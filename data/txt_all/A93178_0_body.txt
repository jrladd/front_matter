SIR,
COmpositions of this nature, have here∣tofore been graced by the acceptance, and protection of the greatest Nobility (I may say Princes) but in this age, when the Scene of Drammatick Poetry is changed into a wilderness, it is hard to find a pa∣tron to a legitimate muse. Many that were wont to encourage Poems, are faln beneath the proverbiall want of the composers, and by their ruins are only at leasure to take measure with their eye, of what they have been. Some extinguished with their fortune, have this happiness, to be out of capacity of further shipwrack, while their sad remaynes peep out of the sea, and may serve naked marks, and caution to other Navigators, Malignant stars the while! In this unequall condition of the time, give me leave to congratulate my own felicity, that hath di∣rected this Comedy unto you, who wear your no∣bleness with more security, than titles, and a name that continues bright and impassible among the constellations in our Sphear of English honour. I 
dare not detain you, Sir, with too long a Preface; if you please to entertain these Papers, as the modest tender of my service, I shall receive it as a most kind influence upon me; and you will engage to all your commands, the humble heart of
Sir,
