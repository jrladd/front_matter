VVHat I had a
long time
sought for in

others (excellent La∣dy)
and could neuer
find, of my selfe, at
last I found in you. I
meane, Madame, a
true definitiō of Ho∣nor:
Which, as I first
found in you; so at
last I honoured you
for it, and will do to
my last. And should
I not, I were as worth∣lesse
as you are wor∣thy;
sith I neuer in a∣ny,
but in you, disco∣ver'd
the height of
Blood, of Beauty, of

Vertue, of Spirit, and
(which vvonder at
World, or thou thy
selfe wilt be wondred
at) with all these, the
height of lowe Hu∣mility:
Of Humility,
Madame, in you to
bee admired; not to
be imitated: or if to
bee imitated, not to
be equalled. I know,
your Ladishippe (in
whom Mildness and
Modestie haue made
a Mariage) will ra∣ther
mislike than ad∣mit

these prayses.
Pardon me, Madam;
you should not doe
so. For, as Vertue
cānot be ouerpriz'd;
no more can she euer
be ouer-prais'd.
Were it not the
world would thinke
that Partialitie did
prompt mee, I would
yet ad to yor praises;
not that you might
reade them; but
that after Ages, by
them, might knowe
howe faire was the

fairer part of fairest
you; and knowing
it, admire it; & with
admiration, imitate
it. It would be long
(incōparable Ladie)
it wold be very long,
before wee shold win
any one to belong to
Vertue, vvith the
meer praysing her in
abstract, should vve
not praise her in som
person gracious in
Gods eye, and the
Worlds.
I know, Madame, I

shall bee prays'd for
praising you; & dis∣prays'd
for offring to
expresse the infinite
honour and seruice
I owe you, vvith so
poore a present, so
little a labour, as this
vnlicked Work. The
truth is, Madam, that
finding my Booke to
haue little spirit, or
life in it, I made vse of
your Name to make
it liue. For, it could
not liue long, with∣out
your euer-liuing

vertues to relieue it.
I am so farre from
expecting thanks; as
that I humbly craue
pardon, for presu∣ming
so much to a∣buse
your Name, as
to sette it before so
weake a Worke. If I
liue, most woorthy
Lady, I heer promise
you and the Age, a
farre greater, and a
farre better. If in the
meane time I die, I
die infinitely indeb∣ted.
Thus, with my

vncessant prayers for
your Ladiship, and
your thrice honora∣ble
Lord, I rest
