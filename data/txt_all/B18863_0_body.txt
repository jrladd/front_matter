My Lord,
THE Story of Don Quixote de la Mancha, no less pleasant than gravely Moral, has been always highly Favour'd and Ca∣ress'd by Personages of most Illustrious note in all the Learned Parts of Europe; to which it has been made familiar by frequent Translati∣ons. And therefore it is, that your Lordship being equally Eminent, if
 not Superiour to any of them, for your Ancient Decent, and the Politeness of your Hereditary Learning and Judg∣ment, I humbly presume to lay this Oblation at your Lordships Feet; not knowing where a Work so generally Applauded abroad, could find in Eng∣lish Dress a more generous and safe Protection, or my self a greater Ho∣nour then to be,
My Lord,
