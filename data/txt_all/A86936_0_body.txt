Right Reverend,
ALbeit I sufficiently know you are not desirous of such addresses as this is, nor is the Piece it self, (as to what is mine in it,) of such worth as to deserve the

Patronage of so many Reverend, and Learned men; Yet the reasons that have moved me to present it first unto you, and under your name to the view of the world, have been so pressing upon me, that I could not incline to make any other choice. One of you was the first mover and solicitour of me to any under∣taking of this kinde, when I little dream'd of such a matter, and hath continued a constant en∣courager of me in going about it. Others of you have been particularly assistant and very refreshful unto me, in your perusing this and the former pieces before they came to publick view, and in your brotherly and free animad∣versions upon them, according as ye saw cause, which I do look upon as a very special kindnesse and favour. And all of you have been so indulgent toward me, while at any time I have been necessitate to retire my self for perfecting what I had undertaken, that I should account my self very ingrate, if I did not take hold of an occasion to give some pub∣lick testimony of my special obligations unto you upon this very account. Next, Seeing it is the will of God, that the spirits of the Prophets be subject unto the Prophets, I hold it my duty in this Piece to give you an account of the substance of some of my labours in the common work of the Ministery with you in this place, as acknowledging that ye with the

rest of the Reverend Presbytery, and other Judicatories established by CHRIST, are over me in the LORD, and as a testimo∣ny that I look upon subjection and orderly walking, as a very special ornament of a Mi∣nister of the GOSPEL. Withall it is one of my speciall purposes in this work, that not onely these of my particular charge might have presented to their view, for their further edification, what they once heard in publick: But that (as our work and charge in this CITY, is in many respects common, so) I might make what was delivered to one Con∣gregation, common to all. And I could not think of a more fit mean to render it acceptable to them, then by its coming to them under your name, and with your approbation. Finally, (that I be not tedious,) I am much convinced of many obligations laid upon me to acknow∣ledge the mercy of GOD toward me, that in this dark time of much confusion and di∣stemper, he hath cast my lot in the society of so many faithful Servants of CHRIST, whose Company, Example, Counsel and Encouragement hath been so often refresh∣full and edifying unto me; and that (what∣ever differences there are,) the LORD hath keeped our Society free of many of these woful and scandalous distractions which

have miserably rent this afflicted Church; and which are a lamentation, and (if mercy prevent not,) will be for a lamentation, even to those who for present look upon them with another eye. This mercy hath so often re∣freshed me, that I could not but upon this occasion leave my acknowledgement thereof upon Record, as not knowing when I might again have the like opportunity.
As these reasons, I hope, will plead for your candid interpretation of this application, and your favourable acceptance of this small token of love and duty; So I purpose not to insist in prefacing upon any subject unto you, to whom I rather professe my self a Scholar and Disciple. Onely my desire is, that as hitherto ye have re∣ceived mercy not to faint in the exercise of this Ministery, notwithstanding the times that have gone over some of you; so ye may continue, and abound more and more, in feeding the flock of GOD which is a∣mong you, and being examples to them, in acquitting your selves as his wise and faithfull Servants, whose aime is to ad∣vance the KINGDOME of CHRIST, and the Truth of Piety, and to follow Truth with Peace and Sobriety, without

a byass or selfish and carnal designe: And my prayer to GOD for all of us shall be; that we may be daily more and more rooted and established in the Truth, and in these wayes, that are well pleasing in his sight, and may be made willing and ready to un∣dergo any lot wherewith it shall please him to exercise us. In which petition I know you will joyn with
