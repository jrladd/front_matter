WHile I was at Norwich, in
the yeere 1597. I writ
this Treatise vpon such
occasiō as appears there∣in,
and deliuered it vnto
that Heretike, that by himselfe, if
God would, he might consider and be
perswaded Since which time I haue
kept it by me: and though some of my
priuate friends desired copies; yet al∣lowing
that wisdome of Solon, who
would make no law against Patricide,
least the mention of the fact might

giue occasion to commit it: and withall
considering that it is too smple and
poore for the publike view; I haue hi∣therto
refused to make it common.
Yet now perceiuing a present necessi∣tie,
because that s me of late haue
wandered in this labyrinth: & with∣all
remembring, that of any weak∣ling
shall hereafter entertaine this
opinion, he may, before he be wholy
possessed therewith, find the absurdi∣tie
of it and be reformed▪ that many
a nouice in Christianitie, who
therefore doubts of the truenesse of
his Religion, because he findes no fa∣miliar
reason to perswade, but onely
the racke of authorities to 
him to acknowledge it; may perhaps
be hereby satisfied and find comfort:
and that they who are already strong,
may by this ouerplus, triumph in the
goodnesse of God, who requires them
to beleeue no more, then they may by
that vnderstanding, which he hath gi∣uen

them, be perswaded of: I haue for
their sakes, who may reape benefite
thereby, set at nought all other Cen∣surers,
not guilty vnto my selfe of a∣ny
offence which I can commit in ma∣king
it publike. Such as it is, accept
(good master White) as a parcell of
that assertion, which may hereafter
follow, of euery article of our Chri∣stian
faith; if God shall vouchsafe
me vnderstanding, leasure, and main∣tenance
thereto. I therefore offer it
vnto you, both because I know you
are diligent in reading bookes of good
argument; and because I haue none
other meanes, whereby to shew my
selfe thankefull for your manifold
kindnesses and your loue. At Lon∣don,
this 20. of April. 1601.
