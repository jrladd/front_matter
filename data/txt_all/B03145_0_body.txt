Madam.
HOw much I am obliged to your La∣dyship for that large interest you have been pleased to let me find in
your affections, I could wish the world were not ignorant; And as a de∣monstration of my grate∣ful acknowledgment, I humbly dedicate this Ma∣nual to your Honours Pa∣tronage; It is the result of a few pensive hours, set a part for dressing the Herse, or singing the Dirge of a deceased friend; I mean for a sad Solemnization of your dear sisters Funeral, whose name and fame, I am sure, is, and ever will be preci∣ous to the memory of all that had but the least competency of acquain∣tance with her; so that I
hope the near Relation of this Honorable Personage to you, (which was as close and conjunct, as either nature or grace could make it) besides that affection and estima∣tion which my self hath plentifully received from you, will apologize for this intruding boldness, and warrant my adven∣ture of shrowding this paper under the wings of your Honours protecti∣on, there to hatch some lustre, and countenance, that it may pass the Pikes of a censorious world with more freedome and less affront.

I have in the Sequel of the Sermon endeavoured to present your Ladyship with a compend of her gracious qualifications, and Picture of her choyce perfections, which my eyes have viewed, and memory registred from frequent observance. The Portraicture is unpolisht, because drawn by a young and unexperienced Artist; had either my opportuni∣ty been larger, or abili∣ties been greater, the peice should have been fi∣ner, somewhat more like the person whom it re∣presents, and somewhat more fit for your honours
perusal, whose pardon it courts. But good Madam, what is defective or faul∣ty in the composition, let your Ladyship correct in a Candid construction; and if ever my obligations to your Honour should end in Ingratitude, may this Inck turn blood to blush my baseness, and blazon my unworthiness to all spectators.
It may (I imagine) be queried by some carping Criticks, what I mean to trouble the press with this Instance in hand, since it is already like to surfeit with plenty of better Pro∣ductions, to whom I ren∣der
this submissive retort, that it is not popular Euge that I am seeking, nor the peoples Encomi∣um that I am Courting; All the world may see, even by the work it self, (which is Rudis indigesta∣que moles, an unpollite and home-spun peece) that I am not consulting with my credit, nor wooing the worlds ac∣clamation, by what I write; but for these and the like reasons I appear in publique.
1. That I might accost your Ladyship with some publick acknowledgment of these private civilities,
which you have sown and I have reapt, which I could not do better; then by this Paper present, which pro∣perly is a Scholars gift.
2. That I might grati∣fie and be civil to the en∣deared Husband of the deceased Saint, whose importunity and reitera∣ted solicitations extorted this from me, which else had not been published by me.
3. That I might not smother in the ashes of oblivion, those sparks and Scintillations of grace, those growing and ac∣crewing vertues, which concurred, and were con∣centred
in this Honorabl Gentlewoman; now step aside and faln asleep; I being pitty that any thin of hers (her unavoydabl frailties excepted, whic yet were as few as can b imagined) should dy with her: but that thos bundles of Cypress, thos Garlands of graces whic did dress her closet, an deck her person, shoul come upon the Stage o publique observance, t win people to wa as she her self walkt and to act their parts wit no less exactness then sh did, that when their la Exit comes, they ma
quietly with-draw, and make that happy conclu∣sion which she made.
There's an unhappy Proverb amongst us, viz. That a little religion goes a great way amongst great ones, and though (proh dolor!) it be too true in the general, yet theres no rule so general, but it admits of some exception; and lo here is one, her greatness, and her goodness, (like Tha∣mars two twins) contend∣ing for precedency, and contesting for predomi∣nancy; yet with so much order and regularity, that the one was no curb or
hinderance but a spur of furtherance to the o∣ther, her vertue advan∣cing her honour, (like David, who the more he honoured God, the more God honoured him) and her honour inviting her to vertue, (according to Pauls expression, the bounty of God leading her to repentance) thus hath she confuted the Proverb, and convinced the world that greatness is not always out of the road of goodness; but that (honorabile & honestum may convenire in uno) To be holy and to be ho∣nourable are not so irre∣concileable,
but they may be perswaded to dwell in one house, yea to lye in one bosom; And now Madam, as by my Pen I desire to do right to the memory of her that is dead; so by my prayers, I will endeavour that the reading of this may be of use to you that are alive, I pray let your Ladiships life be like hers, and in death you shall not be divided; you have so fair a copy left you in the example of this worthy and reli∣gious president, that to scrible after it would cloud your Honour, and
eclipse your reputation you have begun well, ride on most Noble and ver∣tuous Saint; continue sted fast unto death, that none beguile you of your Crown of life; you are, blessed be God, bottomed well upon fundamenta principles, and have made a considerable progress in the superstructure o Religious practices; you are in your way, like a true traveller; keep it; you are on your journey to Heaven, tire not till you come at the end; rest not, till you come at your everlasting rest; take heed that your morning sun,
that looks so smilingly, nay your noon-tide brightness, that shines so clearly, (to the great comfort and interiour complacency of all that love your Ladiship) take heed that it overcast not in the conclusion, nor shut up with winter weather, in the closure of your days: This advice can∣not be impertinet to Chri∣stians, whose temptati∣ons to Apostacy are so urgent. The good Lord grant that as he hath be∣gun a good work in you, so he would proceed to perfect it till the day of Jesus Christ, Phil. 1.6.
That he would strike up so much light in you judgement, beget so much heat in your affections, that neither the power of hell, nor the shadow of death may be able to damp or darken it; do you about Religion, as worldly men do with Riches, against a dear year, they lay up plenty of Provision for say they, We know not what need we may have before we die; so the time may come, when your temptations and tryals may be such, that you will make use of all your grace, though you
should have a Benjamins ortion, a double quan∣ity to what you have. O then get your soul good Madam) well sto∣ed, well fortified, well urnished with a full stock f spiritual Ammunition, nd with the impenetra∣le Armorie of grace, hat may conduct you hrough all oppositions, o the Mansions of Glory, here you shall meet ith your friends that e dead in the Lord,Who are non missi, sed Praemis∣si, n lost, but laid up (ac∣ording to that of David oncerning his dead ild, I shall go to him, ough he cannot come to e,) where (as an im∣provement
of your com∣fort and contentment) this merry meeting shall never be sowered more by any sad parting.
Here the Almighty hath thought good to exer∣cise you with mixtures o providences; as he hat mounted you high in ho∣nour, and other tempo∣ral concernments, s hath his Majesty though fit to throw you low i afflictions, and to giv you a great share in th unpleasing incidences o this your Pilgrimage  while almost every annu revolution of your life hath been imbittered b
some sad instance of a ying friend: but bear p bravely but a little onger, against the af∣righting Surges of these ransient sufferings; chear p but a little, and the ndignation of the Lord will be over and gone; wink but a while, and ou shall see a blessed hange; for these light fflictions which last but a moment, will work for you a ar more exceeding and e∣ernal weight of glory.
And now Madam, since ou lately heard the pas∣ing bell, tolling the mortality of others in our ears, and calling
them to a grave, it  high time that your ho∣nour and my self shoul look upon our selves  persons concerned in th Tragedy; death ha made a near approach t your Ladyship, while  hath fetcht a drop  your own blood fro you; I am sadly sen∣ble you know my mean∣ing, and that withou pointing at particulars your thoughts will refle upon a sad change, vi the departure of a dea friend, which is no dressed for the brighte glory, and invested i the highest felicity, an
ut of heaven, as it were alls to you to fit your lf for that time, which  all mingle your bones ith that beloved dust ats gone to bed before ou; and convey your ul to that Colledge of horisters above, where ou shall sing? victory, ctory, to the Lamb hrist for ever.
But my pen hath out∣n my purprose, which as to have treated your adiship with Lines, not eaves. I pray Madam, rdon my prolixity, and ith all my silence and ta∣turnity, in both which I ay probably seem faulty;
in the former as speaking too much; In the latter, as speaking nothing,  mean nothing of your perfections, not at all acquainting the world vvith your vvorth and accomplishments, vvhich particular I omitted upon a double account.
1. That I might keep my self from coming un∣der a suspition of flat∣tery.
And secondly, that I might not any vvay offend your Ladiships mo∣desty, vvho (I knovv) are better pleased to de∣serve then to hear your
vvn encomium; there∣ore I resolved to turn my raising of you into pray∣g for you, as being ore suitable to my Mi∣isterial profession, and cceptable to your in∣enuous disposition: ow therefore the God f all grace be with you, nd sanctifie all the eans of grace to you, hether they come from e Pulpit or the Press, at by these, as by con∣uits, more light may be nveyed into your head, ore heat into your eart, and more fruit ay grow up in your e, which is the prayer
of him, who desires to be accounted your Ladi∣ships Servant, and per∣sist,
