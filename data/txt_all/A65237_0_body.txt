May it please Your LORDSHIP,
THOUGH the proof of Your ob∣liging and generous Virtues hath fixed in Wisemen a confidence of Your favourable acceptance of whatever Wisdom and Worth (under the Patronage of Your endeared Name and Greatness) presents to the Publique;

and that it cannot but be thought rather a cer∣tainty then presumption, that You will treat those with ingenuous kindness, who are am∣bitious to perpetuate Virtue, and to adorn the dead Monuments of it with all those Tropheys of revival and amplitude, which their greatest parts and most elaborate endeavours to that honestly-ambitious end can possibly arrive at: Yet may it (My Lord) be doubted how this enterprise of mine, by which I humbly (under the favour of Almighty God and Your Lordship) design to revive the Me∣mory, and illustrate the Learning of that Ve∣nerable and Profoundly-Scientifique Antecessor in the Office of the Chan∣cellourship, Sir JOHN FORTESCUE, may be from my hand accepted, who am none of the first Three in adaptation to such a Service. But since it pleased God as to im∣pregnate me with resolutions to attempt, so to vouchsafe me health to finish what I proposed in these Commentaryes, I trust Your Honour will accept the Protection of them, though they be but the Umbra and Eccho of the various

and transcendent Learning that the Text of the Chancellour FORTESCUE abounds with.
For truely (My Lord) had I not well∣weighed my Reverend Original, and found in him that Pondus and Affluence of general and well-digested Science, which would exer∣cise the pains and curiosity of a Gentleman and generous Artist, I should never have ambition'd the exploration of what God would enable me to, in so incessant a progress of study as this has occoasioned. Yet forasmuch as by the as∣sistance of God I have in such proportion as his merciful indulgence has favoured my hum∣ble industry with, perfected these Commenta∣ryes, and obtained the favour and encourage∣ment of an Honourable, Learned, and Grave Permission of them to the Press for publick View; I humbly beseech Your Lordship to pardon me while in pursuance of those primitive resolves of my first undertaking them (which was above five years since) I devote them to Your Perspicacious and Oracular Self, Whom of all His most Excellent MAJESTY'S Favourites and

Ministers of Estate, I foresaw, by the au∣gury of a very affectionate and well-instructed experience, the probablest to succeed to the op∣portunity, and exceed in the ability to propa∣gate FORTESCUE in all the latitudes and advantages of his Sage, Legal, Civil, and Politique Counsel and Conduct of Greatness, to that which is the most Royal termination of it, Iustice; and by that Impartial Ar∣biter of Iustice, which wise and well-advised English-men call, The Law of England.
And therefore (My Lord there being so true a Parallel between my Noble Text-Master and Your Noble Self, Both Gen∣tlemen by birth, Both Lawyers by breeding, Both Knights by degree, Both Wisemen by experience, Both loyal Attendants on your Sovereigns recesses abroad, and Both honoured by your Sovereigns with the trust and state of Chancellours: these Instances of likeness relating to, and uniting in you both, make me bold to conclude, that to no VVor∣thy alive are these Commentaryes so properly

to be addressed as to Your Highly valued Person, Whom I believe to be not onely what the Learned Parisian Chancellour Bu∣daeus once wrote of the French Chancellour Deganai,In Epistol. Dedicator ante Annot. in Pandect. (One Qui per omnes aeta∣tis progressus totidem honorum Civi∣lium gradus suopte nixu, nullo manum porrigente scandens, non antequam ad culmen honorum evasit, scandendi fi∣nem fecit, ut non fortunae beneficio, sed suo merito pervenisse eo credi pos∣sit, cujus ea vis suisse ingenii atque ani∣mi cernitur, ut quocunque loco natus esset, in quodcunque tempus incidis∣set, fortunam ipse sibi facturus videre∣tur) but also what may as truely without de∣generous flattery be added, That very Happy Hee, Who has concentred in Him so much of the Eloquence of Tully, the Gravity of Ca∣to, the Iustice of Aristides, and the favour of Mecaenas, as renders You meet to obtain the utmost Honour, a Sovereign Master can reward a faithful and approved Subject and Servant with: Which that Your Lordship

may long deserve, and live to enjoy and to bless this Nation and every worthy Interest and Concern in it, with the rayes and diffusions of that Prudence, Piety, and Loyalty which are concluded eminent and exorient in You, is and shall be the earnest and sincere Prayer of
From my Study in Syon-Colledge.
