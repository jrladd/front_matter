THE reall Lover, burning for the Fair,
Rather than offer up a Fawning Pray'r,
Owns his Demerits, owns his Just despair.
Crowns her with parting Praises, all her due;
Blushing she Hears them, but Believes them true;
The Poet so should to his Patron move,
And sue to Honour as he sues to Love.
No constant Youth a Second charm can Boast,
They feel not Fierce desires, who Court the most,
Should I lose thee, then every Patron's lost.
No more to Greatness would the Poet sue,
Honour's indeed A Name, if such in You.
All but my constant humble Faith is gone,
Yet, my sole Claim, is, I pretend to none.
Beneath your Gen'rous smiles assur'd I grow;
Who makes me Happy will confirm me so.
Well may he own his Fortunes once deprest,
Who finds his late past Ills can make him Blest.
Let others Quarrell with exalted State,
Tis mine to Praise, who know thee more than great.
O what return can you, my Lord, receive?
Or what can Poets to their Patrons give,
What, what shall I who thro' your Favour live.
The Muses off'rings to your Fame I owe,
That taught me Verse, and to Despise it too.
No guift, no recompence, can Fancy make,
You only give whence you can never take.
Others are pleas'd with Gain, you pleas'd, Bestow,
Generous, alone because you Will be so.
All I can be, to you, my Lord, is due,
Ev'n my best Hopes have been Deriv'd from you.
If e're to active Good I bend my Pow'rs,
Mine is the Profit, but the Glory yours.
