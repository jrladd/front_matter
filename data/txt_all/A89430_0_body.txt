SIR,
WHereas in the midst both of our own parti∣cular grievances and of the generall judge∣ments, which (lik the waves of the Sea) do so succeed one another, that they seem to strive which of them shall first make an end of this idolatrous and sin∣full nation, we look with sorrowfull hearts upon your deplorable conidition, with all those that are nearest and dearest unto you; and that for no evill, but for your well∣doing; which tendeth greatly to all our comforts. For in regard of your Fidelity, Magnanimity, and Constancy, you were chosen by the wel-affected party in your Coun∣trey, to present their grievances to the House of Com∣mons, it being one of the chiefe ends wherefore the whole Kingdome hath chosen and assembled them.
But the house of Commons in stead of hearing and re∣dressing your grievances, have added new grievances unto those which formerly you have suffred in their owne quarrel against the cōmon enemy, they have unjustly im∣prisoned you these 12 months, protected traytors amōgst themselves from the Law, permitted them not onely to set up malignants and other traytors in chiefest places of trust and command in your Countrey, but left an o∣pen passage there, both for Montross and his wicked ce to goe through and oppesse Scotland, and for the Irish rebels to enter England; so tht by these and such means they hastened the desolation of both Kingdomes, if God had not a gracious protection over his own, and did not both continue Kingdoms, and reprove Kings and States for their sakes.
Yet we shall rather with teares seek their repentance, then their persisting in such courses, seeing they are pla∣ced in lawfull authoritie, and have a good cause, though they seek too much their own, and too little the King∣domes good in managing it▪ and that they might be first reformed at home amongst themselves, before they goe abroad to reform others: otherwise if they shall still ad∣vance themselves, and not heare the cries of the poore, nor pitie the Widow and Fatherlesse, nor the heavie groanes of the oppressed, nor the sighes of the prisoners, they themselves shall cry and not be heard.
And as for their lamentable submission to the Bishops servants, the Presbyterian Synodians (as if the servant were above the Lord) in establishing that wil-worship and Popish maintenance which now themselves do well know to be jure Dibolico through these blinde guides, their Diviners and Sooth sayers inability to answer their querees (wherby to prove themselves ure divine) surely, if they will notwithstanding obstinately persist in such wilfull, dangerous, and unwarrnbl courses (not being any longer blind folded as at first it might have seemed) they will doubtlesse shew themselves to be fighters a∣gainst God, his truth and pople to ther own destructi∣on, without speedy conversion.
Farewell.
