THou great Peace-Keeper, whom the greatest King,
That our great God of Peace did euer bring
To rule these Westerne Iles, in happy Peace,
For Honours, Arts, and Piety's increase,
Thou, whom this mighty Monarch doth intrust
With his Great Seale, as Prudent, Faithfull, Iust;
God to thy outward blisse, adde inward Peace,
That Goodnes with thy Greatnesse may increase.
May but thine actiue Spirit now descend
FroÌ„ high affaires, and high-straind thoughts vnbend,
To walke in Muses gardens delicate;
Wisest Apollo thou shalt imitate,
And Martiall Pallas, whom the Poets faine
To leaue Olympus Mount for Tempe-plaine:
Thus Dauid leaues his Throne, to sit with Graces,
The Preacher after Trauels, Hymen paces.

These Precedents imboldned haue my Muse,
For Patron of the Graces, thee to chuse,
Whom great Augustus with his Seale doth grace;
Oh be a true Mecenas in thy place:
Seale vp for euer Ianus Temple doore,
And let Bellona's voice be heard no more:
I of some Graces onely meditate,
But they are all in thee habituate;
Then my defects excuse; when we oppose
Darknesse to Light; the day more glorious showes.

Your Lordships humble seruant, Robert Aylet.
