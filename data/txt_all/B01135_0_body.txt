Sir,
THe worth of the Author, the respects I
 owe you, and your owne Innate good∣nesse have incoura∣ged mee to chuse you the Patron of this Post-humus.
For the Author, as hee was a Divine sound and orthodox in judgement, so hee was peaceable in the Church, and sincere in his life; for his learning, though him∣selfe (it may bee) was a stranger to you,
 yet as hee that by Hercules his foote drew the proportion of his whole body, so in this little Mir∣rour (if J mistake not) you may perceive him to bee one that was brought up at the feete of Gama∣liell, mighty in the Scriptures, and well studied in the Fa∣thers.
The respects I owe to your selfe,
 are such as that ha∣ving this opportuni∣ty to manifest my acknowledgement of them, I had (doubt∣lesse) incurred the censure of ungrate∣full negligence, if J should have let it slip and not improoved it to this end from your owne goodnesse. I gather an assu∣rance of your favou∣rable acceptance, both of this Orphan
 and the presenter, who am put in trust to commend the pa∣tronage of it to some one, whose emminen∣cy in the World for vertuous quali∣fications might some∣what shelter it from these blacke-mouth'd Calumniators that these times are pe∣stred with.
These are the reasons (worthy Sir) why I have (though
 without your fore∣knowledge) prefix∣ed your name in the Front of this tract. I humbly crave your pardon, if here∣in I have tres∣passed any thing, and that you would bee pleased to doe the Author and me, so much honour as to suffer His Israe∣lite to come abroad into the world un∣der your worthy pa∣tronage;
 In the as∣surance whereof I crave leave to re∣maine,
