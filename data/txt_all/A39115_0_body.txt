SIR,
THE Importunity of Friends and the Command of Superiors, hath generally pass'd as an allow'd Apo∣logy for committing Discourses of this nature to the Press. You best know how much this is my present Case. And if this be not sufficient to excuse me to the World for Publishing a Sermon which gives so little Advantage to that excellent and most useful Subject about which it treats, you are one of those who must answer for it: for I have this to say for my self, that your particular Commands herein were too peremptory to be withstood; and the many endearing Obligations which you have
heaped upon me, have put me so much within your Power, that you left me no liberty to pur∣sue my own Inclinations.
However, since you were resolv'd it should be so, I cannot but with some inward kind of Com∣placency lay hold on the Occasion, to publish to the World what a general Satisfaction you gave in the Administration of your Office; and how eminently you distinguished your Respect to those of my Gown more especially: which altho it was no more than what was suitable to the natural Generosity of your Temper, and to that known Civility wherewith you have always treated those of our Profession; yet so publick an In∣stance of it as this deserves no less than a pub∣lick Acknowledgment: And this you are hum∣bly desired to accept of, in the behalf of all those whose Gratitude and Respect you have hereby engaged; and from the hands of one, who of all the rest is more particularly intituled to the Character of,
SIR,
