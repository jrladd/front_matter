My good Lord:
MVltiplicity of
words begets
multiplicity of
errors: especi∣ally
in those whose tongues

were never polished by Art.
It is true, I have much Lear∣ning,
but that is in my Shop,
and it is as true that I am ig∣norant,
having not the happi∣nesse
to bee bred a Scholler.
Non cuiuis homini licet ad∣ire
Corinthum. This little
Booke (my Lord) being former∣ly
printed, hath received good
entertainement: and now that
it goes under your protection▪
I doubt not, but it will be much
more welcome. The cause of
this dedication is to expresse
part of my thankefulnesse for

the goodnesse I have received
from the Noble Earle your
Father, the right vertuous
Countesse your Mother, and
your Honourable selfe, for
which the height of my ambiti∣on
is onely to be stiled
