ALthough I do see it by ex∣perience (Right Worshipfull) that it hath alwayes been, and yet is the manner and custome of those which indeuour to publish their workes and deui∣ses, (whether they be sleight or serious; pleasant or profitable,) to make choyse of some worthy person to whom they might dedicate and commende them; and vnder whose coun∣tenaunce they may be protected from the carping tongues of malitious detractours: Yet haue I iust cause to doubt, whether it would stand with your Worships good liking, to be made Patrone of this so simple and vnpollished a Pamphlet, considering I am but a stranger, and not knowne to your Worship by any kind of acquaintance or conuersation. Notwithstanding, seeing the Booke it selfe doth carry with it a deuice of some Noueltie, and matter of varietie: wherein, had there been vsed any kind of learned skill in the penning, mought (peaps)
 haue bred some pleasure in the reading: Yet such as it is, I haue presumed vpon the report both of your vertu∣ous and godly disposition, and singular elemencie; and also of your zelous care in the administration of Iustice, and abolishing of diuers Abuses, which seeke to shrowde themselues in those, and such like places, where your Worship (by reason of your place and calling) haue to deale in: I haue, I say, presumed to present it vnto your wise and graue consideration. And though your wise∣dome and worthinesse deserueth to be presented with a gift, farre more excellent then my little learning can any way affoord; yet my hope is, your Worship will rather esteeme the intent, and goodwill of the giuer, then the basenes of the gift: and more regard the matter, then the manner of the handling thereof; not doubting but that this shall seeme to men of good iudgement, more worthy the Printers trauell, and the Readers paines, then many vaine Pamphlets of Songes, and dallying deuises, ten∣ding to the artificiall cloaking of Vice, and nuslyng of amorous heads therein. Therefore, crauing your Wor∣ships fauourable acceptation hereof, and pardon for this my bould attempt; fearing to be tedious, I humbly take my leaue.
