Very Dear Brethren!
MINE Hand was at the Proposal for your Associating, and mine Heart is with you in all your Meetings for your strengthening of one anothers Hands in God. With what delight I have comen amongst you when younger, and fitter for Travel, he knoweth, who is All-knowing. I have no such vanity, as to expect (or deâˆ£sire) to be counted an Author, yet am not unwilling that when dead I may yet speak in such Papers as this is prefixed to. Pardon (I pray you) my mentioning you in this Address. If to your solid Judgment, my proceeding further appear unnecessary, and unprofitable, I beseech you, hint so much. The Good Lord who hath taken down many Lights that were in his Golden Candlesticks, continue you long as Burning and Shining Ones! and bless all Related to you. This is the Heart's desire, and Prayer, of
Choice Sirs!
