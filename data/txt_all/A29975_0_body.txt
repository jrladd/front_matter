Sir,
HAving collected these papers out of their dust, I was bold to hope, there might be somthing in them of a bet∣ter fate (if mine obscure pen dar∣ken not that too.) Please your Lordshipp to let your name, make them another witnesse of your noblenesse, it may re∣deeme and improve them, to a clearer opinion and ac∣knowlegedment of these times, in which I am to meet every Critick, at his owne weapon, who will chal∣lenge the Book at the very Title: The Malicious and Malevolent, with their blotted Coments; the Capti∣ous & Incredulous, with their jealous praecisiansines, whose inclinations shewes them of envious perplexed natures, to looke at other mens actions and memory by the wrong end of the perspective, and (me thinks) I fancy them to our shaddowes, which at noone creepe behind like Dwarfes, atevening, stalke by like Gy∣ants; they will haunte the noblest merits and en∣deavors to their Sun-set, then they monster it▪ but to the Common-rout, they are another kind of Genius, or
