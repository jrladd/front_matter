Gentlemen,
IT hath beene a common fault of late, to commend things to the Presse taken up by heare∣say and report, which fre∣quently prove untrue. This common course makes many trueths doubted, specially in dif∣ficult discoveries. That this ensuing dis∣course is true, I need no other witnesses then your selves: your paines was used in the dili∣gent Examination of the Offenders, and the
 witnesses against them. You were present, and Judges at the Tryall and Conviction of them, more full and cleare confessions, more satisfactory Evidence, and a clearer Con∣viction, could not be in a case of this nature. By particular service, I was attendant in most of the Examinations: and waiting on you all at the Tryall, know what I assert to be true, and dare presume to make you Patrons hereof. Knowing your integrities most rea∣dy to attest truth, and to maintain and coun∣tenance herein
