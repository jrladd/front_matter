Right Reverend Father in God,
MEmorable, if not Miraculous, is the Story con∣cerning the Dumb Son of Croesus, how that see∣ing an Assassine about to kill his Father, though he never spoke before, yet then cried out, : So our Political Father, Cor, Sol, & Anima Regni, the Heart, Sun and Soul of the Kingdom, being translated from us, in a Fiery Chariot, Who can but cry out with Elisha, My Father, My Father, the Chariot of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof?
Should Subjects neglect to sing the Obsequies of their Murdered King, the
Wals of the Royal Palace would be mo∣numents of their shame; even as the
Stones would have sup∣plied the defect of the Childrens Hosanna's to the Son of God; & the dust of the ground where the bloudy Tragedy was act∣ed, would testifie against them, as the dust of the Apostles Feet against the unbelieving Jews. Seeing Rebels have been so industrious in forming Cyclopical Weapons, in an∣velling out Diabolical Machinations against Monarchy, and have published so many bitter Invectives and Satyrical Li∣bels against the Sacred Persons of Kings, to enchant and in∣toxicate the English Nation, and to seduce us from our Alle∣giance, God forbid that we should omit the Confection of An∣tidotes, and Counter-medicines against this Poyson.
 Wherefore I have attempted to vindicate the Royal Pre∣rogative of King wherewith they are invested by a Divine Charter, and which is a Jewel fixed in their Crownes by the King of Kings, to wit, Their exemption from the vio∣lence of Subjects; and likewise (though indeed the Acts and Monuments of our Royal Martyr deserve rather to be registred by the Golden Pen of some Able Martyrologer, another Fox) to commemorate that Fatal Blow, which caused an Earth-quake of Desolation in England, and as it were unhinged the Earth from its
Center. The Lord grant, that it may now produce an heart-quake of Lamentation, and prove d Lymbeck to distil our hearts into tears, to extract the
Quin∣tessence of our spirits, and to sublimate our Affections, and Faculties into the height of Sorrow.
Now my Lord, the Beams of your Favour accented and enamelled with manifold
Amplifications, have so influent ∣ally shined on me, that they cannot but work indelible Impres∣sions of Gratitude in my heart, unless it were petrefied, and most strenuous endeavours after testification thereof.
Wherefore I present unto your Lordship this ensuing Book of Lamentations, as a
Pepper-corn by way of acknowledg∣ment of my great Obligations unto you: Humbly imploring your candid Acceptance and Patronage of this unpolished piece, in imitation of the Divine Majesty, who accepted of Badgers Skins, Goats hair, a Cup of cold water, and the Widows Mite, as well as more magnificent Oblations. As I am conscious of many Imperfections, which your judicious eye will discern herein, so I am confident of your Indulgence.
I have endeavoured more to manifest the Affection of my heart, then the
Affectation of Art. Sackcloath and Ashes is a fitter Garb for Mourners, then
Gorgeous Attire. Who can be eloquent on such a doleful Theam, as the Murder of a Christian, Protestant King, which like Opium is enough to stupifie the the Faculties of all that study on it? and at the Tidings whereof, (as David wished for
Absalom: O my Son Absalom, my Son, my Son Absalom: Would God I
had died for thee, O Absalom, my Son, my Son) Your Lordship with many more
English Hero's, could (I believe) have cried out, O my King Charles, my King, my King Charles: Would God I had died for thee, O Charles, my King, my King.
I think it Honour enough, to be vouchsafed, to bring but one Pin to the decking of Christs Spouse, while others adorn her with more costly Jewels, and rich Medals, said a Reve∣rend Bishop: So I account my self superabundantly honoured, if this Threnodia may be accepted by my Dread Sovereign, through your Lordships Intercession, as the smallest Testimo∣ny of my Cordial Lamentation, for the barbarous Decolla∣tion of his Royal Father, though but like the casting a Branch of Rosemary into a Grave, while others erect more Glori∣ous Tombes and Statues; and as a pledge of my great exul∣tation, for his own Happy Restauration and Coronation.
My Lord, it is my Intention, to write an Eucharistical, not a Panegyrical Epistle; because I know, that Flattery, as it is abhorred by my self, so it would be nauseated by your Modesty. However, without contracting any such guilt or censure, I may record it for your perpetual Renown, That while so many have proved Erratick Stars, somtimes Pro∣grade, somtimes Retrograde, never
Stationary; you have been a fixed Star in the Firmament of the Church of
Eng∣land: And while others have courted their Sovereign, with Parasitical Friendship, for saking him in Adversity, as Rats and Mice do a Barn, when the Corn is spent, your Soul hath cleaved (like Jonathan, Ittai, Barzillai and Zadok, to distressed David) to an afflicted Prince; that you have reverenced the
Setting Sun of Martyed Majesty, King
Charles the First, and the clouded Sun of exiled Majesty, King
Charles the Second.
I have read concerning Agrippa, that being imprisoned for wishing the Empire unto
Caius, he was afterwards gra∣tified by Caius with a Chain of Gold, as heavy as that of I∣ron, wherewith he was loaded in Prison: So, that your
Lordship, who have magnanimously endured the Malignant Influences of Blazing Comets, during the dismal Eclipse of the Proper Light, may as a Blessing unto the Church of God. long sit under the vivifical and salutiferous Beams of our Royal Sun, now Triumphant in his Noon-day Glo∣ry, is the Prayer of,
