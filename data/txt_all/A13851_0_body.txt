R. HONOVRABLE.
I HERE adven∣ture to present to your Lord∣ship this Ser∣mon of the Praise and Worth of Wisdome. Were the Discourse answera∣ble to the Subject, it were
 a Treasure indeed and well worth the keeping, but the emptinesse of that may well giue the World just cause to think it to be, as it is, too far below the acceptance of so great a Personage, and my selfe so much the more unadvisedly bold in presenting the same unto You.

God direct the hearts of all men to seek after that wisdome, which is
 acceptable and makes them such, who love it: and may the Gift there∣of be ever multiplied on Your Honourable Fami∣ly, to the magnifying of God's glory here, and Your's hereafter: which is the true desire and un∣fayned Prayer of
