THE Sacrifice by the Law was to be delivered into the hands of the Priest, and to be offered by him: and since your hands, Reverend Prelate, vouch∣safed to offer my , Petitions to the Kings Majesty, I now become an humble Petitioner, that those hands would please to offer also my , These Testimonials of my thanks.
I bring the first fruits of my replantation, which the Royal favour indulged me, by the intercession of your Honour, when I had been rooted up. For since by that Favour I am restored to these Seats, to peace, and my studies, there is nothing I now desire besides, nothing more, than that that most ex∣cellent Prince may perceive, that he hath not been a Benefactor to an in∣grateful person, however unworthy, however obscure: and that your Honour may see, that you have not interceded for a forgetful person, howsoever un∣deserving.
I shall never forget, Great Sir, with how much kindness and candor, your Honour received me in my straits, altogether unknown to You, and whose face You had never before seen: with how great concern You pleaded my cause before the Kings Majesty, before the most Honourable the Lord Chancellor of England, and before the right Reverend my Diocesan: how your Honour consulted for me, wrote Letters, laid Stops, that my ruine might

not proceed beyond a possibility of restoration. All which while I reflect upon, which I ever do, and while together with that reflection I consider what obligation lays upon me on one hand, and my own meanness on the other; on one hand how unworthy I am of so great favour, and how altogether un∣able to make any recompence on the other; what else is left me, but to fly again to the same Kindness, humbly imploring it, that as it at first so obli∣gingly received me, a person unknown and unworthy; so it would now enter∣tain me, known and bound by so great obligation, and approaching with all the thanks, I can give. Those thanks, so due to your Honour, I have com∣mitted to these papers; unlearned indeed they are, and undressed; but such as carry Sincerity with them, though not Learning, Thankfulness, though not Eloquence. And I have intrusted this charge with them, the rather, because I suppose they may disperse themselves far and near, and perhaps may live to posterity; and that which I desire of them is, that they would declare to all, how endebted he is to your Honour, and to your great Humanity, with how great obligations he is bound to You, and with how grateful a mind, and inward affection he professeth all this, and will ac∣knowledge it for ever, Who is,
My Lord,
