MY Muse is now in four parts. Would they were writ,
With full as much dexterity and wit,
As Harry and Will Lawes did once compose,
Or you, my sweerest friend, can write in prose.


Yet, Though my Muse be not urbane, but rough:
As Cotswold folks, you know, are hard and tough:
At stately Harvell, when you doe her meet,
You'l bring her in, to kisse The Ladies feet.
