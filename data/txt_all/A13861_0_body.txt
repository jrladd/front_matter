I Heard with great griefe of minde, how a countrefaite papiste labored shame¦lesly to deface your most honest, and godlie behauior towardes him, with the foule name of simuled frenship, & flatte∣rie. And I know the tendernes of your herte, and how much it euer iustly grieueth you, that the good name, that god hath gi∣uen you, shuld be blemished with false re∣portes, & impudent lies. But I trust your wisedom is such, that you wil not be longe trobled, with the barckinges of so foule a mouthed mastife. Wherefore I exhorte you to staie your selfe against this open in∣iurie vpō the ground of an honest vpright cōscience, whereof sondrie, that be here p̄∣sent, & haue longe time knowen you, giue vndoubted testimonies, & haue seen most certaine frutes. This mastife, whose na∣me I wil not vttre, though it signifie, that he came of a wilie generatiō, hath opened his mouth against me also, and hath enfor¦ced himselfe to scratch, and teare me with his nailes. But god of his goodnes, hath giuen me alwaies, where with to defende
 my selfe. The defence that he hath now ministred vnto me, against this three hea∣ded Cerberus bred, & longe fed in the po∣pes kennel, I dedicate to you my dere frēd master Barckley, bicause you haue sustai∣ned parte of this crosse with me, and haue aswel at this time, as at manie other stode so ernestly in the defence of goddes truth, that you haue therefore prouoked a slaū∣derous tounge against you. God shal su∣rely requite you with his fauor, & the lord Iesus shal giue you a good reporte in the last daie. Praie for me, and cease not to loue me, as I loue you, both for your o∣ther singular good qualities, & also for your honest godlie zeale, that you haue shewed in this matter. The lord Iesus con¦forte you. Amen.
