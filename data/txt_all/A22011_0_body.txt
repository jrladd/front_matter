WHAT tyme as, moste graci∣ous
Prince, your highnes this
last year past, tooke that your
moost honorable and victori∣ous
iourney into Fraunce, ac∣companied
vvith such a porte
of the Nobilitie and yeomanrie of Englande,
as neyther hath bene lyke knovven by experi∣ence,
nor yet red of in Historie: accompanied
also vvith the daylie prayers, good hartes, and
vvilles of all and euery one your graces sub∣iectes,
lefte behinde you here at home in En∣glande:
the same tyme, I beinge at my booke
in Cambrige, sorie that my litle habilitie could
stretche out no better, to helpe forvvard so no¦ble
an enterprice, yet vvith my good vvylle,
prayer, and harte, nothinge behynde hym that
vvas formoste of all, conceyued a vvonderful

desire, bi the praier, vvishing, talking, & com∣municatiō
that vvas in euery mās mouth, for
your Graces moost victoriouse retourne, to
offer vp sumthinge, at your home cumming to
your Highnesse, vvhich shuld both be a token
of mi loue and deutie tovvard your Maiestie,
& also a signe of my good minde and zeale to∣vvarde
mi countrie.
This occasion geuen to me at that time, cau∣sed
me to take in hand againe, this litle purpose
of shoting, begon of me before, yet not ended
thā, for other studies more mete for that trade
of liuinge, vvhiche God and mi frendes had set
me vnto. But vvhen your Graces moste ioifull
& happie victorie preuēted mi dailie and spe∣die
diligencie to performe this matter, I vvas
compelled to vvaite an other time to prepare
& offer vp this litle boke vnto your Maiestie.
And vvhan it hath pleased youre Highenesse
of your infinit goodnesse, & also your most ho¦norable
Counsel to knovv and pervse ouer the
contentes, & some parte of this boke, and so to
alovv it, that other mē might rede it, throughe
the furderaunce and setting forthe of the right
vvorshipfull and mi Singuler good Master sir
Vvilliam Pagette Knight, moost vvorthie Se∣cretarie

to your highnes, & most open & redie
succoure to al poore honest learned mēs sutes,
I moost humblie beseche your Grace to take in
good vvorthe this litle treatise purposed, begō,
and ended of me onelie for this intent, that La∣bour,
Honest pastime & Vertu, might recouer
againe that place and right, that Idlenesse, Vn∣thriftie
gamning and Vice hath put them fro.
And althoughe to haue vvritten this boke
either in latin or Greke (vvhich thing I vvold
be verie glad yet to do, if I might surelie knovv
your Graces pleasure there in) had bene more
easier & fit for mi trade in study, yet neuerthe∣lesse,
I supposinge it no point of honestie, that
mi commodite should stop & hinder ani parte
either of the pleasure or profite of manie, haue
vvritten this Englishe matter in the Englishe
tongue, for Englishe men: vvhere in this I trust
that your Grace (if it shall please your High∣nesse
to rede it) shal perceaue it to be a thinge
Honeste for me to vvrite, pleasaunt for some to
rede, and profitable for manie to folow, conte
ning a pastime, honest for the minde, holsome
for the body, fit for eueri man, vile for no man,
vsing the day & opēplace for Honestie to rule
it, not lurking in corners for misorder to abuse
it. Therfore I trust it shal apere, to be bothe

a sure token of my zeele to set forvvarde shoo∣tinge,
and some signe of my minde, tovvardes
honestie and learninge.
Thus I vvil trouble your crace no longer, but
vvith my daylie praier, I vvil beseche God to
preserue your Grace, in al health and feli∣citie:
to the feare and ouerthrovve
of all your ennemies: to the
pleasure, ioyfulnesse and
succour of al your sub∣iectes:
to the vtter
destruction
of papi∣strie
and heresie: to the con∣tinuall
setting forth of
Goddes vvorde
and his glo¦rye.
