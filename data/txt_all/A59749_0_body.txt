My Lord,
INtending to present You and your Noble Consort with something that may bear a more suitable Correspondence with your Greatness and my Obligations, than this Trifle can pretend to, I humbly request your good Lordship, while That is preparing, to accept of This, as an Earnest of What, if God grant Life and Health, shall in due time follow.
Your Lordship was pleased to honour this Discourse with your Presence, and, (as divers other competent Judges did) with your Approbation. I hope its Defects will now meet with the same Candour and Pardon, which divers other failings of the Author have frequently experienced.
I have subjoyned a Just Vindication of my Self and of a Treatise I writ about three years and a half since, from the silly Cavils of some Bigotted Papists and some indiffe∣rent Protestants. The Latter of which as little Care for their Religion, as the former Understand Theirs.
The Sermon was not easily Perswaded to the Press; but I assure you, the Apology was altogether extorted from me: For I am so great a Lover of Peace, that I can hardly prevail with my self to take up even Defensive Weapons.
And even now, like him in the Poet, Clypeum post Vul∣nera sumo.
For your Lordship and many Others can bear me witness how rudely I have been treated by my Implacable and Restless Adversaries; and that, when I have expressed the most Obliging Civilities to their Persons, and treated them with far more Respect, than ever I animadverted upon their Tenents with severity.
My design in Publishing these Papers (next to Gods Glory) is to evidence my self a sincere and Loyal Pro∣testant against all Exceptions: and to Demonstrate that your Lordship could not give a more convincing Argument of your Zeal for the Church of England, than by recei∣ving into your Protection one that shall consecrate his Life and Studies to the service of his Holy Mother; and his Noble Patron, in the Quality of,
My Lord,
