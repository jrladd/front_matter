Most Dread and Gracious Soveraign,
IN this great Re∣volution, when eve∣ry body is come to pay unto Caesar, those things that are due unto Caesar, I am bold to present to Your Sacred Ma∣jesty these Sermons, not only due unto You, as You are Head of the Church, but as they were most of them preached in Your Chappel, and approved by Your Royal Progenitors. Your Statues, Pictures, and Med∣dals, famous for their Workmanship, and Anti∣quity, cannot pretend to a greater Elegancy or a nobler Descent, then the Doctrine that is here taught; For, it is primitively Christian, not depending upon the absolute Authority of

any present visible company of Men, nor, yet refusing to be guided by those Antient Fathers of the Church, that concur with the Apostolical Writers, as being the Supreame Rule of our Faith; And, though the Author be many times very severe against the Roman-Church, yet he is never very indulgent to her Rigid Oppo∣sers, not being desirous to make a rent in that Garment, which is to cover and keep alive the Flock of Christ, which being immediately com∣mitted to Your Majesties Care in these Your Realms, cannot be better preserved, then by that exemplar Piety, that reigns in Your Sa∣cred Majesty, which will be a Living Sermon, even to those Reverend Pastors, that Your care, and Gods Providence has now appointed to re∣store His Church to her antient Splendor, and to have awakened that Light of the Gospell, which we could never have expected, but by Your Glorious Return, or a new Fiat.
