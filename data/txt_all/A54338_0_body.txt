My Dear Friends,
YOƲ may remember, that some Years ago (which was I think the second Summer af∣ter the Providence of God had cast me a∣mong you) I did insist Copiously upon this Subject, which I have now presented you with a Brevi∣ate of; and forasmuch as the Kindness I then received from you, gave me cause to hope, that my poor Labours found acceptance with you, I took encourage∣ment to present you with this Paper, in order to the helping of your Memories with some Hints of those Truths, which some of you have acknowledged to have been conducible to the Illumination of your Ʋnder∣standings, in that great Doctrin of Justification, by
the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness; and it is the earnest desire of my Soul, that the Lord will be pleased so to attend my poor Endeavours (in this Work) with the powerful Assistance of his Spirit, that they may conduce to the Mortification of your Sins here, and the Glorification of your Souls here∣after; for without Holiness in this VVorld, you must never expect Happiness in the VVorld to come; which Internal and Eternal Happiness of yours, is the earnest desire of him who is,
