SIR,
TWo Things have Emboldened me to Dedicate this Book unto You; The First is your known Loyalty, and Integrity to the Royal Cause, which hath made Your Name as Conspicu∣ous as the Sun in the Firmament in a serene day, not only since the Happy Restauration of his Sacred Majesty, but in those Times of Rebellion when Loyalty was accounted a Crime of the Highest Nature, which as it made you one of Those Loyal Confessors, that by your Sufferings have indeared your Me∣mory to all Posterity; so no doubt, had not that Gangreen of Rebellion been the sooner cut off, your Eminent Parts would by those bloody Regicides, who were Enemies to Worth and Loyalty, have brought you into

the Number of These Royal Martyrs who laid down their Lives in Defence of Gods Laws, and his Annointed's Cause, of both which you were so Gallant an Assertor. The Second is the Relation you had to that Reverend Mar∣tyr, Arch-Bishop Laud, who laid down his Life in Defence of the Church, and is now involved in that Glorious Company who Suffered for the Testimony of a Good Conscience, of whose Worth and Abilities to speak, were to show the light of the Sun by a can∣dle; Daigne Sir, to Accept this Mite of Ac∣knowledgement of Your Worth, from him who Subscribes himself,
