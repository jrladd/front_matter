SEcundae cogitationes are euer (they say) meliores; and why may not then secundae Cantiones be as well dulciores? I presume they are so, and that makes me resume this vaine, with hope that I shall not consume in vaine my labour herein.
For first, the kinde acceptation of the former Impression is as a new invitation to this latter Edition, though not of the same things, yet of things of the same condition; full of the same de∣lectation, made to please, as the other were; to please I say, and that with as much ease, as the other; made truely Musicall with Art by my correction, and yet plaine, and capable with ease, by my direction.

But, though there bee but little to bee gotten by them, yet pittie were it, such Mirth should be forgotten of vs; And therefore to make an end, I say no more but—Siquid nouisti dulcius istis.
Candidus imperti; si non, hijs vtere mecum, either commend me, or come and mend me, and so I end me, as resolute as thou art dissolute.
