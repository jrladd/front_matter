Worthy SIR,
THree conside∣rations have induced me to offer these rude and un∣polished

lines to your Patronage and favourable accep∣tance. The first is, the Learning and fame of the Author of this Treatise, who carrieth the same Title as Your Self. The second is, the worthinesse and great esteem and acuity of spirit

of that Person of Honour, Sir Ke∣nelm Digby, to whom it was offer∣ed by the Author. The third is, the worthiness, wisdom and deep Learning wherewith You are indued & adorned, which that Noble Knight well know∣ing, for an acknow∣ledgment

thereof, hath presented this Book to your view, as a piece of great novelty. I shall not presume to implore your Protection for the subject, but onely for this my rash attempt in the translating of it; which if it may auspiciously be ad∣mitted

into Your friendly estimati∣on, doubtlesse 'twill find an universall acceptance amongst Persons of greatest Eminency; All I humbly crave for the present is, my boldnesse might be favourably excu∣sed, since 'twas my lawfull Ambition

thereby to avoid Ingratitude; How∣ever this Work be esteemed, may your deserved good name and honor en∣crease more and more; which is and shall be the constant Vote of, Sir,
