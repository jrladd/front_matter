SIR,
A Most learned Dutch writer hath maintained that Birds doe speake and converse one with another: nor doth it fol∣low, that they cannot speake, be∣cause wee cannot heare, or that they want language, because we want understanding. Bee this true or false, in Mythologie Birds are allowed to speake, and and to teach Men too. We know that a man cannot reade a wiser,

nor a child a plainer Booke then Aesops Fables.
These Birds now come to make their nest under the Bowes and Branches of your Favour; Bee you pleased Sir, to extend your shadow over them, and as they shal receive succour from you; you may be assured you shall receive no hurt from them: And thus Sir, I wish you all happinesse, not only to converse with Birds in the lowest Reion of the Aire sometime stiled Heaven, but that a better and higher place may bee reserved for your entertainement.
