SIR,
YOƲR Integrity, Conduct and Zeal for the Ho∣nour
and Interest of your Country, the due Ad∣ministration
of her Affairs, Engrandizing her
Publick Assemblies, and Courts of Judicature,
hath been evidenc'd by your Care, in singling out and
returning, for the Grand-Inquest, Gentlemen, for Qua∣lity,
Estates, Integrity and Parts, the most Eminent
Berks can boast of: Remark'd on as a fit President to
be followed, and best Expedient to prevent, for the fu∣ture,
such kind of persidious Addresses as were (of late)
wont to be hatched at the Assizes, by Men of as despe∣rate
Faith as Fortunes; and sent from thence to the Court
to flatter and deceive their Prince (with their own
Senses instead of his Peoples), betray their Religion and
Country; in hopes by those sordid Crafts, to raise them∣selves
on the Ruins of both. A second Lustre beamed
on this our Restoration-Assize, was the appearance of so
many Noble Lords, as also other Persons of Quality,
who, as abhorring, or ashamed of late Lycaonick Pranks,
had for some time, with Astrea, withdrawn or hid them∣selves,
but now appear again with joy, to welcome her Re∣turn.
My Part being in the Temple, to publish and am∣plifie

our great Deliverances, and cry Hosannah to their
Author; I was in hopes, when my Breath and Glass were
both out, my Task had been done too, until surpriz'd by
your joint repeated Requests, I found my self run on
this Dilemma, either to bid you Defiance, and proclaim
my Rudeness (to all the World), by a churlish Deni∣al,
or my Weakness in granting your Request; which
latter part I have chosen, to let you see what a high
Valae I set on your Merit and Friendship, whilst I am
thus content to expose, and so renounce my self to serve
your Commands; and therefore (factum defendite ve∣strum)
you have herein your Request. Now I pray
God and you (Gentlemen) to grant me mine, (viz.)
That Berks and her Gentry may ever do worthily,
and faithfully serve their God, their Prince, Religion
and Country, be Famous, and flourish, which is and shall
be the Prayer of,
Gentlemen,
