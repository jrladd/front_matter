Madam,
HAd not the invitation of a worthy friend (that first gave life and being to this so small a Treatise) invited me (though unknown) to present the same unto your so Vertuous a Personage and Family; it might have been a free will offe∣ring from my self.

Let it find entertain∣ment by you and your Family, and if it shall any way conduce to the crowning of your Ver∣tues, be directing you to the New Jerusalem, it will be your profit and advantage; and the greatly rejoycing
