My Lord,
WHen I consider the Perfecti∣ons and Sublime Qualifica∣tions wherewith Nature hath so

advantagiously adorned Your E¦cellency, I cannot but think, would be an injury to the Public should I omit to attempt some de¦lineation thereof. And seeing  is no new thing for others to b ambitious of describing the Actio of Great Men, it is but reasonab that I, who for sometime have bee an ocular witness of those of You Lordships, should erect a Mon¦ment for Posterity of the same. Up¦on this account it is that I no publish this Work, under Your Ex¦cellencies favourable Protection, b which it is manifest, that Your Ex¦cellency hath born the Charact of Your Prince thorow three fo¦raign Nations with all imaginab Prudence and Honour. There is no¦thing to be seen in the whole S¦ries of Your Lordships Conduc but what is generous and Noble

and in which Your Excellency makes it appear with what Rea∣son and judgement His Majestie made choice of Your Person for the Representation of his own, un∣der the Illustrious Title of His AMBASSADOR EXTRA∣ORDINARY. Which same Ho∣nour, being now conferred upon You again, is a sufficient Proof of the Verity of my Sentement: and, without further Enlarging upon Your Lordships Worth, I believe the Knowledge alone of Your Lordship is sufficient to render You beloved: which yet one cannot do, but with a most profound respect. For my part, my Lord, if I have any Ambition in the Publication of this Work (of which Your Ex∣cellency is both the Subject and Ornament) it is onely that I

may have the Advantage to te¦stifie to the World with how much Zeal and Devotion. I am
MY LORD,
