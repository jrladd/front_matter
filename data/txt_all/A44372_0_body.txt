YOur desires are (worthy Sirs) to have your Sons gain a fa∣culty of speaking Latine, as well as English; a thing which I observe many parents wish for, and some School-masters more studious∣ly labour after; but the many difficul∣ties that attend the work (especially in a Mort Language, and with Children not throughly grounded, many of whose Parents, being illiterate, or intending som∣thing else, doe not care, or afford any en∣couragement

to have their Sons brought up in a Scholar-like way) hath made most of our Profession, either not at all to undertake the task, or not till a perfect knowledge be had of the Grammer Rules, which is very rare, (I had almost said impossible) before dis∣cretion.
To helpe forward your good wishes herein, I have formerly furnished them with store of words; and some neces∣sary Rules, or directions, how to put them together in forme of Speech, imitating ever and anon the expressions of those Authors, whereof they were then capable. And observing that Colloquies are most suitable to children, (who like nothing serious long) and excellently pro∣fitable to attaine ability of discourse, by comparing Language with language: I have purposely translated so many of the

choicest Books of them, and disposed them in such method, as may readiliest enable young learners (as they pass the Grammer Rules, and lower Authors) to write or speake properly upon any occasion, that so being acquainted with the Language aforehand, they may more cheerfully Proceed in Authors truly Classicall, and excerpt and note from thence such Grammaticall, Rheto∣ricall, Morall, and other quaint pas∣sages, as themselves are able to observe or their Masters bid them minde.
And because a man that keeps not the road, is likely many times to be left to go alone, and Children must be led along by an easier (though perhaps it be not a shorter) way then men may pre∣sume to take. I make use of such Books especially, as are generally received in Grammer Schools; and have begun with Pueriles Confabulatiunculae, writ

heretofore (as is propable) in Dutch and Latine by Evaldus Gallus, and with us commonly taught in Latine onely, to young-smatterers in that tongue, because it seems cheap and pleasant.
This therefore at present, I beseech you, be pleased to accept on your Sons be∣halfe, whom I thus study to benefit at a distance because I am engaged to you by speciall favours here, whereof I ought not to be backward to let the world take notice, however your selves account it enough to have done a courtesie.
And now the God of al goodness sup∣ply you and yours with meet gifts and graces to doe him service: and increase your comforts here and herefter: Let me remaine.
