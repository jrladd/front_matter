RIGHT HONORABLE,
A few years ago, that I might approve my self no less an ob∣servant
Citizen, then a provident Parent, being invited by the desires of some,

allured by the kindness of others, and encouraged by the expectation and good
hopes of the usefulness of the thing it self to the Place; I did lay down my First-born
as a fondling, at the feet of Your Honorable Bench; solemnly engaging, that as it re∣ceived
its being from BON-ACCORD, and its growth from Your Goodness,
so it should period its stature with Your Pleasure. This Promise hath pressed me, that
my Press might always bear the Impress of Your Vertues; and express (though in a
smal type) my thankfulness, according to the laudable custom of Votaries in all
Ages, after a few years growth, to represent the same to Your Sanctuary, that it
may be confirmed in Your favor. For that I may confess ingenuously when I
looked deliberatly on this my first Mephibosheth, I offered the same as an object of
pity, being so mank and maim in its chiefest parts, like a pittiful Embleme of Or∣pheus
teared by the Thracian women, its vigor seemed to wither, its tender hands
to dry up, and whole body to vanish in a consumption; had I not called a Tymous
Counsel of the most Expert in this Place, who diligently turning over their old
Records, and rifling the labors of their Ancestors, unanimously and so chearfully
did contribute all their pains, that now being fred of all the noxious humors that
were preying on its vitals, its wants are made up, defects supplyed, its dryed
hands received moisture, and strength diffused so thorow the whole limbs, that it
dare show it self to the Publick on its own leggs, if Your Wisdoms command; yea,
run to the Schools to warble the Anthems of Your Liberality. Seeing it is natural to
children to lisp out first their Parents names, why should it be singular? If it did
so when on the Nurse breasts, why not in the flower and prime of its youth?

Though it be silent, it hath a voice, and could sing its own pedegrie, and the
fruitfulness of its Mother Science; yea, with Strabo, Pindarus, Plutarch, Aristotle,
and all Antiquity demonstrate, how much brutes, as well as men, are born obse∣quious
subjects to this Queen, whose charming Melody was only able to enchant
Barbaritie, civilize Savages, secure Societies, and so give matter to the significant
Apologues of Amphion, Linus, Orpheus, and the building of the Theban walls,
were it not the fear of being tedious, it would not be afraid to assert with
Divine Plato, and his Followers; that the Heavenly Soul by which the Vnivers
is animate, doth owe its Origen to this Lady; and narrate how much the great
Solon, that Sun of Greece, bestowed on his Nephew, for teaching him one Sa∣phick
Tune: and how much pains the wise Socrates, though full of years, did gree∣dily
bestow upon the Lute; and how much that greatest Captain, and Magi∣strat
of Athens Themistocles, after he had accomplished himself in all Vertue, and
most of Arts, was dashed with the sharp Sarcasme of a fellow Magistrat: How
can he keep men in Harmonie, and people in Concord, who hath not learned as
yet to tune a Citeron? It were no difficultie to show how much the Ancients used
this Science, as a remedy and amulet against all Fascinations: as the Harp of Da∣vid,
to alley the fury of Saul; and the greatest auxiliarie also in time of Battle, so
that the famous Stratonicus did discern the courage of his Souldiers, by the musi∣cal
and saliant motion of their Bodies; and therefore, bearing a Citeron in his En∣signe,
did adde this motto, Adversus male canentes Cythera; as if none deserved
Victory and Triumph but Musicians.

And now, seeing it hath pleased Providence in Your Wisdoms Persons, to bless
the Bench of BON-ACCORD with such an Harmonious Consort, of as many
Musitians as Magistrats, that all under Your Magistracie may descant on Your
Labors, and Posteritie sing Your Praises to coming Ages: Admit this Poor Pre∣sent
to Your Acceptance; its Breath and Being depends on Your Brow, being willing
to receive its Sentence from the same, whether it shal be smothered in the Birth,
or view the Publick under Your Patrocinie: However, that the best Blessings and
Out-bearing of the ALMIGHTY, may accompany Your Wisdoms in all Your
Honorable Designs, Shal be the dayly Prayer of
