Right Honourable,
IF, in the great crowd of de∣dications, that daily flow in upon your Lordship (the general Patron of Arts) there be

yet a roome left, I would endea∣vour to break through the press, to throw my self, and this small Treatise at Your Honours feet.
It is in You, my Lord, that Galen and Helmont are reconcil'd, and made friends; and that  or wrestling my Authour dreams of, is nothing else, but coming to a close for their mutuall Support; that thus United, each may stand the faster, both pitching on Your Lordship, as upon a Common Pillar. And since this League and Amity of Galcnicall and Chymicall Physick is no where else to be found more Conspi∣cuous, Justice it self must plead my Excuse, if there be any

Presumption in my Humble Desire of Your Lordships Patro∣nage.
I must confesse it was not matter of long dispute or study put me upon this choice; it was of the same date with my Re∣solution to say something to this Bold Pretender; For, be∣sides, that in Your Lordship, having not onely a Powerfull Patron, but a most proper and competent Judge, I was bound in Gratitude to make use of this opportunity, to witnesse to the World my particular Obli∣gation to Your Lordship for the long Encouragement I have re∣ceived from Your Honour in

my Profession of Chymistry.
Your Lordship cannot be igno∣rant, how numerous these Pseu∣dochymists are now grown; who whilest they would be thought, not onely Sons of Art, but Do∣ctors in Physick, Viper like, eat out her very bowels: And though never so Unskilfull, yet they presume to boast themselves and their Juggling Faction, as the on∣ly Friends and Zealots for Chy∣mistry; whereas indeed, ignorance alone is the Mother of their De∣votion: This Crew I would sum∣mon to receive their Sentence at the bar of your Lordships perfect Knowledge and Experience, where I doubt not but these Pre∣tenders

to Pyrotechny, not able to undergoe the Fiery Tryal, will, like their own false preparations, vanish in fumo; and they be dis∣covered to be neither Physitians nor Artists, but meer Impostors. As an Appendix to this Sentence, I hope your Honour will absolve me from my feares of having dis∣pleased your Lordship in my pre∣sent Address, and vouchsafe still to continue me according to my Great Ambition, in the favour of being,
My Lord,
