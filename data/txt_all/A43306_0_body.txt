My Lord,
This Poem was composed by a worthy Gentleman at hours of his recess from happier employments. In his life he was above the Sphere of common Writers, and though at death he left greater Monuments of his worth and abilitie, yet this piece had justly gain'd an esteem with men of excellent judgement; and having suffered very much by private Transcripts, where it past through many hands as a Curiosity of Wit and Language, it is now emergent from darkness, and appears in a publike dress, having shaken off some dust and imperfections that too usu∣ally waits upon multipli'd Copies.
My Lord, If we had not confidence that the, merit of this Poem would excuse the boldnesse of this Dedication, we would not have attempted so great a flight as to your name. We humbly beseech your Honour to peruse it when you will descend to a recreation of this nature: And let not our Names that attend it, by our lowness and want of Or∣nament, be thought a stain to what we have presented; for though our sails are not filled with so much happy air and breath of the World, yet our small and plain Vessels are fraught with as true faith & humility to serve you, as that which carries more fire and noise to proclaim their devoti∣ons: And in the assurance that your mercy will vouchsafe us your protection, we cast our selves at your feet,
My Lord,
