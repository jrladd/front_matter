Honoured Sir,
THE kind reception you were pleased to afford a small Pa∣per of mine, that had lately the ho∣nour to have your Name prefixt,
 hath given this encouragement to present to your view, a further Col∣lection of Experiments touching the same Subject, relating to the Waters of Bathe, a place you were pleased once to grace with your Practice, and still with your Favours, for which a more than ordinary respect is, in gratitude, your due.
Besides, Considering you have so far favoured my late Enquiries, as to assist me by your presence, and be an Eye-witness of some of the Experiments, and are a suffici∣ent Judge of them all, I could not fix on any fitter than your self, and the Learned Body you have Relation to, to make this Address unto, or give the Trouble of this present Dedication.

It hath caus'd me sometimes not a little to admire, That the Me∣tropolitan Waters of all England, (as I may term Them) to say no more, should lye 2000 years, and it may be much longer, in so narrow a Diocess; for the dis∣covery I have made of many Things relating to Them, (of which in part here is some Account) that were never taken notice of by for∣mer Persons, and those few Wri∣ters that have Treated of Them, will Justifie the Expression.
The Principles formerly were accounted Sulphur, Copper, Iron, and a little Marcasite; of late, Bi∣tumen, Nitre, and some Sulphur, which last I endeavour to Confirm, with the Addition of many more, which will partly Constitute, and partly evidence the Nature of these
 Waters: Besides the beneficial dis∣covery of the Rational use of the Bath-waters in Potion, which hi∣therto having been but as a good Back-Sword, are now become a Single-Rapier, ready to save, and not destroy, unless ill manag'd by a distemper'd hand.
I confess I did not think to have appeared in this Dress, having de∣signed, and in part compleated, as you know very well, something else, that would have better suited with my Condition, the Dignity of the Subject, and Reputation of These Waters. But finding some hasty Chirurgion that hath already launced what I intended should have had a longer Time to digest, and expecting, as none but in rea∣son must, the Pretences of many others, I found my self oblig'd to
 appear, though in a careless habit, and in a manner undrest, rather than too much to exercise the Pa∣tience, if not justly incur the Cen∣sure of those friends, whose kind∣ness shall induce them to give me a Visit.
And although my Nature in∣clines me rather to a diffidence, than presumption on any thing that is my own, yet I must be so far confident as to believe, that the Existence of Nitre in the Waters of Bathe, so much question'd by some, and my particular Concern, is so fully establisht by the fol∣lowing Experiments, made with my own hands, as to keep those words upright in my late Letter to your self, wherein I assert it to be un∣deniable. And whoever shall take the pains to satisfie himself in that
 Particular, as I have done, and shall let me know wherein he is dissatisfied, and can convince me to the Contrary, whom I will as∣sure he shall not find obstinate, he shall have the Honour, if that be any thing, of making me his Convert, (for I think my sin∣gle Reputation a small Sacrifice on the Altar of Truth;) but if not, it will appear, which is no great matter on either hand, that some Body hath been mistaken.
However the Satisfaction is not little, nor the Omen bad, that I have already gained the Appro∣bation of a Person so Judicious as your self, who have formerly taken pains on the same Account, and on which side soever the Scales shall turn, I have had this
 opportunity of doing something to oblige my Countrey, as well as acknowledg my self
Sir,
