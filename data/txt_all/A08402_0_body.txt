RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
MANY yeares haue expired, since these Sermons began first to haue their life in this Famous Vniversitie. They haue hitherto lyen in obscurity. Only, a few copies of some of them haue beene tran∣scribed, for the vse of a few. Now they all see the light. They were penned with intent, to worke honest & good mindes in Gods people. If they shall so farre prevaile with the Chri∣stian Reader, they haue their happynesse. Their maine Sub∣iect is, the greatest of Sinnes, the SINNE against the HOLY GHOST. I describe it to be, (not every sinne of presumpti∣on, or of desperation, or against knowledge and Consci∣ence, but) such a kinde of presumptuous offence, where∣in, the profession of the Christian faith is totally renoun∣ced, and that, of set purpose and resolved malice against the very Majestie of Almighty God himselfe, and his Christ, our ever blessed Saviour. A sinne absolutely vn∣pardonable: There remaineth no sacrifice for it. The more
 neede is there, that every man be armed against it. For this purpose at this time is this poore mite cast into the Lords trea∣surie. It's the best I haue in readynesse. Such as it is, I dedi∣cate it to your HONOVR, vnder whose protection it may lodge in safety, as vnder the covert of Minerva's shield. I may not seeke to any other to Patronize it. It is your Honours of due. The liberall maintenance, which it pleaseth your HO∣NOVR to extend to the Reader of Divinitie for the Ladie MARGARET for his further encouragement and support, challengeth MORE from me. Meane time, accept this, my good Lord, as a gratefull agnition of your so rare bounty. GOD Almighty, the great recompenser, who rendreth to e∣very one according to their workes, keepe you, giue you life, make you blessed in this world, and when the resurrecti∣on of the just shall be, giue HE vnto you that never-fading Crowne of glory.
From my Study in CORPVS CHRIS∣TI COLLEGE in OXFORD,  March 25. 1615.
