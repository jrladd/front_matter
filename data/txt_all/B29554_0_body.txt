MOST MAGNIFICENT, &c.
WHsoever doth behold clearly with the eyes of his Ʋnderstanding the wonder∣ful works of the Eternal Moderatour, and Governour of all things, he is m∣mediately delighted with the sweetness of that Contemplation; and the more he is delighted, the farther he searcheth into them. By searching daily
 he learns the more, and is the more ready and willing to consecrate his knowledge to the publick good; and by the help of drawing and engraving to transmit his ex∣perience to all posterity. The Antients discovered much, and yet left much more still to be discovered. My Ʋncle, of Pious Memory, first led by the admirable di∣rection of God, devoted his mind to the study of Phy∣sick from his youth, and without vanity, I may af∣firm, that he attained to no small glory, in the happy per∣formance of Chyrurgical Operations: and whilst that he chose that stupendious Miracle of Nature, the Fabrick of Mans Body to be his Subject, and did con∣template it with great delight; he collected every day new Observations, which he committed to Writing in∣tending one day, after having revised them, to make them Publick; and I wish to God a milder Fate had spared his Life for some years, that those Productions of his might by himself in their due time have been brought forth into the world; But God disposing it otherwise, upon his untimely departure out of this Life; and dying intestate, I came to be one of his Heirs; and having been ever observant to him, and of the same Profession, I thought it would be a high offence, to in∣volve, as it were, in Cimmerian darkness the works of him, to whom I owe my education; and as his Heir I hold my self obliged to perform the desires of the deceased, which I hope in this work, I have in some measure satisfied: as also the desires of friends, who, by Letters, have earnestly requested the Publication of it, but the chief motion which hath induced me to set it forth is, that I might Dedicate it to you my most
 honored, &c. Finding it by divers Writings which he left behind him, that it was the intention of my Ʋnkle, if he had continued alive, to Consecrate this work to your Lordships; and therefore, I should be very much to blame, if I refused too perform this ser∣vice in honour to his pious ashes.
But that which hath ravished my Ʋnkle and my self with admiration in your fair City of Ulme is, your still more fair order of the Senatours; which in the three Estates, Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Military, flourisheth in the highest degree of honour; and as the understanding in the mind, in the body the eye, and in the eye the pupill, or sight: so in Ulme, the eye of Suevia. The Senators Order, as the pupill, and sight of it directeth all things: your most excellent Com∣mon-wealth, is free from putting an imperious yoke upon Mens consciences: your Court is free from flat∣tery, and all impartiallity: your Walls are free from forreign Forces; and in your free City, speech, and all things else are free: who therefore hath not the same Veneration for you, Fathers of your Country, as he hath for the Country it self? and who doth not testi∣fie all manner of acknowledgement and submission to you. These thirty years Warrs which Christian hath waged against Christian: under the wounds of which, almost all Germany still groaneth, by your directions, under God, have not shaken our Walls, have not vio∣lated our Temples, and Altars, and have not ravish∣ed our Virgins; all these your most constant care, your inbard sedulity, and your high prudence, have preserved: you have vouchsafed to allow both my
 Ʋnkle, and my self, an honourable Sallary out of your reasury: without which liberality of yours, I could not have been at the Ʋniversity: especially the Venetian, nor have lived three years there, and fol∣lowed my Studies. You have since received me into the Counsell of Physitians, and have commanded me to be fellow of their Colledge; These, and many other benefits heaped up upon us, my Ʋnkle while he was alive, did always most gratefully acknowledge and his quiet Ashes at present do confess them, and I my self who have out-lived him, shall at all times retain a me∣mor an due sense of them. Your singular humanity al, and incomparable civil obliging nature, worthy enatours hath enboldned me so far, that I have ventu∣red to trouble you with the Dedication of the Chyrurgi∣ons Armory, and Store-house, and to defend these Physi∣cal Meditations with your Patronage, as with the Shield of Aiax.
I beseech you therefore, Governours of your Country, to accept kindly, this small Pledge of a grateful mind; which I most humbly present you with, and pray to God to preserve you, protect you, and defend you ever, in peace, happiness, and prosperity; together with this Common-wealth, and all the Members of it, that you may rule to the benefit and good of ours, and after Ages.
