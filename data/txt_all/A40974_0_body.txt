My LORD,
DID this Book treat of any other Subject, I should begin with ask∣ing Your Lordship's Pardon
for the Liberty I take of pre∣fixing your Name to it; but since it is an Abridgment of the Actions of our August Mo∣narch, I dare assure my self that I need no Apology on that account: For what more ac∣ceptable thing could one offer to your Lordship, whose Zeal and Affection to his Majesty can hardly be parallel'd?
I likewise think I may dis∣pense with another usual Me∣thod of Dedications, and there∣fore I shall not attempt your Lordship's Character, nor speak of your Valour, Generosity, Civility, and innate Inclination to do Good to Mankind. These
and many other excellent Qua∣lifications, are so conspicuous in your Lordship, that those who know you, would take it ill from me to insist on a Truth they are already convinced of. And for others who know your Lordship only by Fame, they cannot but have a great Idea of your Merit, when they consider, that the most Judici∣ous, as well as the most Glorious Prince that ever wore a Crown, finds you worthy of his Esteem and Confidence, of which the great Titles of Honour he has lately conferred upon You, are a publick Demonstration.

I beg your Lordship to ex∣cuse the Ambition of this Ad∣dress, and to give me leave to assure You that I am with a most profound Respect,
My Lord,
