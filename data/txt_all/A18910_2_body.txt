HAuing (Right
vvoor shipfull)
receiued such a
Christian help
at your hand,
as lately I did,
in hauing you so ready, to stir vp
her Honourable Counsell (if not
also her Maiesties owne Person)
to commiserate my dungeon E∣state:
whereby, as by an * Ebed∣melech,Ier. 38.
I obtained (in all good

Conscience) happie deliverance.
I could not but therefore (openly
before all the World) broch from
my breist a Symbole of gratitude.
That I haue done, in this my bold
offer, of the Gospels breviarie,
in which blessed vvrit, is health
convaied to all that worship God
in Spirit and Truth: not in an I∣dole
& Falshood. The worthines
of the subiect, may shadow my im∣perfect
pen; and your Worships a∣miable
construction, shal giue vi∣tall
power to my over-saples sen∣tences.
And so (beseeching the Al∣sufficient,
to remember your dai∣lie
zeale, for her Maiestie and the
Common-weales good) I end,
