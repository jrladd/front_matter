REuerend, and Belo∣ued in our Lorde Iesus, It hauing pleased the Almigh∣ty to vouchsafe mee to bee a member of these his chur∣ches: both by a generall bond of my ingraffing ther∣to, as also by a more speciall calling to engraft others
 therein: I haue therefore endeauoured since the Lord hath vouchsafed light there∣to, to improue my best meanes and occasions, thogh in great weakenes, for the supply thereof, in what is most necessarie. And ther∣fore finding our Times to be ranke, & so indeed rankle with vnnecessarie conten∣tions; and yet to bee too much barren of that fruite, which is most necessarie: namely, the powerfull prac∣tise of godlinesse. I haue laboured by Gods mercy, as occasion and ability hath serued, to cast in my mite ino that Treasurie, in dis∣couering the by-pathes of hypocrisie and Apostasie, & strengthning the weake,
 with such holy directions, as may happily build them forward to perfectiō. Wher∣in though I must needes ac∣knowledge to Gods glorie, and mine owne abasing, that I haue been for a time much interrupted, by reason of the Differences in our Church; as beeing a long time carri∣ed with the contrary wind of such, who haue bin dazeled with the beauty therof, & so haue stūbled at her seeming blacknes, & pretended defor∣mities; & so therby haue bin much distracted in iudge∣ment, and so different in practise, and so thereby ex∣posed to manifold afflicti∣ons; yet seeing our gracious God turnes all things about to the best vnto his poore
 children, as I haue had ex∣perience in my opposition of much deceitfulnesse and vanitie in men; so hath this sent mee gratiously for sa∣tisfaction to him alone, who hath mercifully resolued my vnsetled mind, & fitted mee thereby to a more free, and comfortable renuing and pursuite of my mayne endeauour, euen to strength∣en the thinges that remain, and to keepe my selfe and others in the way of Life: Wherein because I haue had comfortable experience of your Worships loue and piety, both in refreshing me formerly in that long and tedious distresse of my body, as also in furthering lately my liberty in the Gospell,
 and so thereby reuiuing, as it were, both of Soule and Body: I haue thought it fitte to consecrate vnto you these first fruites of my renu∣ed calling, as to whom vn∣der God I acknowledge my selfe especially bounden for the same. What the subiect hereof is, and intent of the same: I desire you heartily to take notice of in the Trea∣tice ensuing, and to weigh the worth of the Argument equally with my weakenes in the handling therof. And if herein you shall perceyue any power of God in the weakenesse of man, any hiddē pearles vnder the rub∣bish of humane infirmitie, as this shall bee an occasion to giue God the onely glo∣rie:
 so may it also prouoke you by Gods mercy to lend your helping hand, that such defects may be holpen, and such weakenesse strength∣ned, Blessed bee GOD, that hath giuen you an hart and place in the Church of God, whereby as you are a∣ble, so are you willing to supply any good means, for the furtherance of the trueth, and peace of our Churches. Whereunto seing by the grace of God, I am now returned from many daungerous outgoings of Schisme, and separation. My humble request vnto your Worshippe is, that seeing I haue long trauelled of ma∣ny such other burthens, which are euen ready for
 the birth, but there wants stength to bring the forth, and otherwise am desirous, and in some poore mea∣sure, by the grace of God able to bee seruiceable in Gods Church. It would please you still to enlarge your accusto∣med loue for my furtherance herein, in performing some Widwife-like office hereun∣to, that the soules of Gods people may blesse you, and the blessing of the Al∣mighty may be multiplyed vpon you, and all your ho∣ly endeauours to the perfec∣ting of his gracious worke, for your eternall saluation. And so commending my selfe and labour vnto your gratious acceptance, and protection, and your Wor∣shippe
 vnto the euerlasting mercy and protection of the Lord, I humbly take my leaue.
 From my house in Whitecrosse streete, Feb. 5.
