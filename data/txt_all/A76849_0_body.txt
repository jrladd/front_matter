ROYAL SIR,
THe Author of this book if living, doth as yet conceal his name, but however the work doth speak his worth: it now happily came into my hands, and if your title and office did not warrant me, I had not presumed to make your Majesty the Patron to so small a book (although of great consequence.) But (as you are the Defender of the Faith,) you have some obligation upon you to patro¦nise it; For when had the Faith of Christ more need of Defence then now? and when was it more assaulted, and adultera∣ted by Blasphemous tenets, and Heretie
 opinions especially by Anabaptists, and Quakers then now? which none but a re∣gal authority can stifle; They are grown so exceeding high and daring, that if your Majesty put not out your royal hand of power suddenly to restrain them, they are so numerous, and so seducing, that they will (in a little time) diffuse their poyson over the better part of your Kingdom; I beseech your grace to pardon the pre∣sumption of,
