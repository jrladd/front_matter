AS no riches doe better enrich the soule of man, then learning, and no learning doth better instruct the life of man, then Historie; so (right Honorable) no Historie can bet∣ter beseeme your knowledge, then that of this noble Cittie; and since examples pre∣uaile more then precepts as patternes to follow, I haue broken some sleepe to awake from sleepe the worthie deedes of many your Honourable prede∣cessors, who before you haue swayd the sword of Iustice in Londons Tribunall, which with her His∣torie of auncient and moderne times, Chronogra∣phicall description, polliticall gouernment, milita∣rie exercises and natures of armes all taking begin∣ning from the worthie practise of your now hope∣full Infantrie, I haue published as the map of my natiue Lōdons glory, before neuer delineated in the like form or method: the cause why I haue conse∣crated
 it vnto your Honor is my naturall loue and duty to my natiue Countrie and your proper inte∣rest in my worke as gouerning that Cittie, whose Historie is my subiect; and though I know, that such a Cittie-subiect cannot want enuie in court and countrie: yet if your honour vouchafe it your gra∣tious acceptance, I craue no further fauour of pro∣tection, then within the liberty of my natiue London to liue.
