THe Summers Haruest, (right Honourable) is long since reapt, & now it is sowing time againe: behold, I haue scattred a few seedes vpon the yong ground of vnskilfulnesse, if it beare fruit, my la∣bour is well bestowed, but if it be bar∣ren, I shall haue lesse ioy to set more. The husbandman obserues the cour∣ses of the Moone, I, the forces of your fauor: he desireth sun-shine, I, cheere∣full

countenance: which once obtay∣ned, my haruest of ioy will soone bee ripened. My seedes, as yet, lodge in the bosome of the earth, like Infantes vpon the lappe of a Fauourite, want∣ing the budding spring-time of their growth, not knowing the Est of their glorie, the west of their quietnesse, the South of their summer, the North of their winter: but if the beames of your aspectes lighten the small moytie of a smaller implanting, I shall haue an e∣uery-day-haruest, a fruition of con∣tent, a braunch of felicitie.
Your Honours addicted in all obseruance,
