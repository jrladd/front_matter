HOw many there are (most Noble King) that have aimed at the unfolding of this divine and hidden Prophecy, would require the skill and vertue of a Prophet to refer. 'T sufficeth to know they have all left the mark very faire and open for o∣thers to hit; Wherein. howsoever their Zeale, by privi∣ledge of charity, may find excuse, yet their ignorance and errour, within these cases ( no lesse hurtfull to the Rea∣der, then dangerous to the Writer) may not find the like grace.
What I have seen or dreamt, I feare not to offer to the censure of time, the discoverer of error, and Mother of truh, appointed from above, th' only indubitate touch stone of all divine and Propheticall enterprises.
And although your Highnesse may doubt of my bold and hardy direction in this dangerous and scopulous sea, wherein so many great and learned Pilots have overshot the Cape, as one that feareth all Physitians for that he hath fallen in∣to the hands of so many unskillfull; yet forasmuch as the Church is sicke, and the physick of this prophesie needfull, I could not chuse but speak the things I know, leaving to your Princely gust to iudge whether the Needle of my Compasse bee truer toucht then theirs.

And for this prophesie was directed chiefly unto Kings, unto a King I have the rather presumed to recom∣mend the same: and unto You (most noble King) before all other, whofe fame of wisedome, Justice, and goodnesse, hath advanc'd your name and Scepter higher then any power of greatnesse can doe.
And although it bee presented by one awaked out of time, yet if it may find but litle protection under your gracious favour for a season, yeares and age, I doubt not, will give it airation and honour enough.
 hope of which grace most humbly I reverence your most Princely hands, commending all their labours to the God of Heaven, who hath exalted your arme so high and made you so honourable throughout his world.
