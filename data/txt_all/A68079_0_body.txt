THink not Appelles paynted péece,Appelles.
ne yet Pigmalions skill,Pigmalions.
In present volume here to view,
fine fanes to fulfill.
But rather think a homly worke,
wherat grose heads may grope:
And finde therin some nedefull thing,
for their behoofe I hope.
Thus thinking, shall ye surely haue,
that which ye think to finde:
A worke that may right well I trust,
content the indifferent mynde.
And such a worke as nedefull is,
so doeth experience proue,

Whre vrgent matters of our own,
or frends to write vs moue.
As for example when our frende
in any foren land
Farre distant is, and we desire
to let him vnderstand
Of this or that, of warres, of peace,
of strangie newes or else
Of other things that nede requires:
this work the practise tels,
And shewes by louing letter how
the mynde shal be discust,
What order, and what Methode eke,
therein obserue we must.
How to begin, how to procede,
and how the finall ende▪
Must ordred be in ech affaire,
to foe, or else to frende.
So that obseruing of this worke
in euery point throughout,
A Letter, or Epistle well
compose we shall no dout.
The vse whereof so nedefull is,
in vttering of our mynde,
That no wie we may want the same,
as dayly proofe doth finde.

For why? by letter well we may
communicate our heart
Vnto our frende, though distance farre
haue vs remoud apart.
By Letter we may absence make
euen presence for to be,
And talke with him as face to face
together we did see.
By letter we may tell our ioy,
by letter shew our griefe:
By letter from our frende thereof,
we may receiue reliefe.
By letter what so heart can think,
or what can head deuise,
To frende, or foe, the same we may
present before his eyes.
Our stéedeat home in stable standes,
our purse also we spare,
When louing letter trots betwene,
and mynde to mynde declares.
It blabbeth not abrode the hid
and secrete of our mynde,
To any one, saue vnto him
to whome we haue assignde.
And looke what so we charge it tell,
it misseth not a iote:

When messenger by word of mouth
might hap forget his note,
And either tell somewhat to much,
or else leaue some vntold:
Therefore the littel Letter well
to trust we may be bolde.
More might I proue in praise thereof,
but sure it smally néedeth:
For very nede it selfe the profe,
in euery brayne now bredeth.
Therefore although perhaps this work
be not so finely pend,
As such a matter might require,
yet pardon do me lend.
For know you sure, I meane not I
the cunning clerks to teach:
But rather to the vnlearned sort
a few precepts to preach:
A nedelesse thing of truth it were
vnto the body sound,
To minister Phisitions ayde,
where no disease is founde.
But if disdaining tongues do saye,
'tis proudly doon of thée,
To take in hand so great a thing,
thou shouldest haue let it bée:

That other some more learned hed,
or man of yeres▪ more graue,
Might haue depainted out the same
with words both fine and braue.
Ile say againe it's better that
the body should be fed
With bread of Barley, than it should
for lack of foode be ded.
So yet if Momus hap to mowe.
or Zoylus chance to chide,
(Whose churlish checks eche painfull pen
of force sometime must byde)
Then to your worships I appeale,
for iust defence therin,
Requesting that your lawfull ayde,
and fauor I may win.
Which once obtainde, I know right well
Will fully conteruayle,
The basenesse of my simple Stile,
that else might hap to quaile▪
Through baneful bit of stinging tongs
which neuer ceasse to clatter,
In corners darke with depe despite,
against ech modest matter.
Therefore I say your worships ayde,
and patronage I craue,

From rude and ranck reproches all
this simple worke to saue.
So shall you still encorage me
to practise further paynes,
And pray for your prosperities,
to him that rules and raignes
In heauen aboue, where I do wish
(when ye haue run this race
Of mortall life) your worships all
to haue a dwelling place.
