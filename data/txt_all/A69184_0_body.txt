GAllants, (and yet I hope no Gulls neither) As on a time I sate musing on the very verticke point of Hie-gate-hil, (with as little coyne in my Pocket, and as much cunning in my Craneon, as most of our Starre-gazers haue) To make experiment of my skill, if it could reach so high, as to take the iust Altitude of the Blindmans Bottle-ale at Holloway. I spied such a cluster of Knaues below in the valley, (like so many Danske Crowes summon'd on Douer sands against a storme) as that by my A∣strolabe I began to collect; That this Producing more won∣ders then Pla∣to's Mirabilis Annus.Yeere would proue intemperate, by reason of an extreame heate in Summer; insomuch that the stones in Cheapside shall

be so hot, that diuers Steeletto-bearded Scape-thrifts shall feare to goe from Paules to the Counter i'th Poultrie: Whereupon I betooke me to my Ephime∣rides, and erecting a figure, haue found such strange Accidents to fall out this yeere (Mercury being Lord and predominate in the house of Fortune) that many fooles shall haue full Bellies, and cramm'd Coffers; when wise men shall walke vp and downe with hun∣gry stomackes▪ and emptie pockets: and that many (who haue newly buried their Sires, and leap▪t into their Lands, before they be come to their wits) shall this yeere drowne many an Acre of their Ancestors, in the bottome of a wine-seller; and burie their Quae malè parta, malè dilabuntur.De∣mesnes in the Bellies of Brothell houses: More∣ouer, if Iupiter were not ioyned with Mercurie in a more fauourable aspect, Butchers wines should haue little or nought to doe all Lent, but ride out of towne with their Iourneymen, and prouide Prickes against Easter: Seeing therfore the wonders that are like to ensue this succeeding yeere, I haue taken vpon me (for the beneficiall content of all my Countrymen) to com∣plie this Prognostication, discoursing & discouering briefly the disposition of the foure Quarters of the yeere 1623. the Ecclipses both of Sun and Moone, with their dangerous and subsequent effects: by which (if Pisces play not the Porter) many poore men, wan∣ting money, are like to fast on Sundayes for Lacke of food; and such as haue no Shooes, to goe bare-foot; if certaine deuout Coblers proue not the more propici∣ous: Yet Astrologie is not so certaine, but that it may faile: and therefore diuers Ale-stufft-beleeuing

Hostesses, may perhaps chalke vp more this yeere, then shall by their Customers be wiped out in two yeeres af∣ter; But V. P. for that: Monedula capiet muscas, and digest them as easily, as some Church-men doe two liuings, and neuer surfet on them neither. Now as touching my Dedication; I was at first halfe way suggested to haue cull'd out some Church-warden or other for my Maecenas, who perhaps would haue bid me once a yeere to dinner, or haue fisted me with Forty-pence out of the poore-mans Boxe: But in the very rumination on this merry-thought, steps in a good Starre, and plainely told me, that Cum insipi∣entibus ludere, insipidum est. Therefore, with the rest of my weather-beaten brethen, I must needs con∣clude, that Sapiens dominabitur astris.
