SIR,
IN observance of your Request, and to
perform my Promise upon it, I have
permitted the publishing this Discourse:
But as to what induced you, with some o∣thers,
to desire it of me, I am yet to seek,
how to make a tolerable Conjecture. Only in
this I satisfy my self, that whatsoever is
found defective in it, so as not to deserve
a Publick View, may possibly be shelter'd
under an interpretation, that it was desi∣red
of me as from your own Personal kind∣ness
to me; improved perhaps, for the

sake of an Excellent Person Your worthy
Father, my most Especial Friend, now
with God.
And for that reason, tho' I might please
no body else, I should be bery unworthy of
your Friendship, and his Memory, if I
should not think it sufficiently satifactory
to my self, that I have pleas'd you.
This is the true Figure of my Mind and
Thoughts, by which I am always ready
to approve my self
