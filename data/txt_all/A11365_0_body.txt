RIght Honoura∣ble,
the con∣templation
of
your Worth reflected
from the circumstance of
report and action, toge∣ther

with that respect,
which I owe vnto that
Illustrious Family, with
â Branch whereof you
haue contracted alliance,
haue inuited me to ten∣der
this Translation of
Salust to your Noble
hand, vnto which no
vulgar thing ought to
bee presented. If this
Romane Master-peece
be clothed in an English
habit, without losse of
his primitiue elegancie,
the Renderer may boldly
claime this praise, that
olet lucernam, his worke

smelles of the Lampe.
Thus desiring the God of
all power to blesse You,
and your most Honoura∣ble
Lady, with a nume∣rous
and hopefull Issue,
with a long and prospe∣rous
life, and after that,
with eternall happinesse,
I nd, and remaine,
