SIR,
I Doe here present to you that Sermon, which the Lord ena∣bled me to deliver at the fune∣rall of your gracious Lady, now a glorified Saint in Heaven. Of right it belongs to you; for your desire, which the receipt of many favours obliged me to satis∣fie, brought it first to the Pulpit, now to the Presse. The consciousnesse of my insufficiencie in the Worke of the Ministerie, and of the weaknesse, and unworthinesse of this Sermon, so suddenly conceived, made me for a time most unwilling to expose it to the publike sight, and
censure of this queasie, and distempered time. But your importunitie hath now drawn it from me, and you have it in the same forme, wherein it was deliverd, And though it be a plain dis∣course (according to my countrey course of Preaching) yet, as it did affect the Hearts, and Consciences of the Hearers, so I hope it will not be unpleasing, or unprofitable to the Readers. And may it, by the good blessing of God, affoord any comfort to your self, or any other truly fea∣ring God, I have that, which I expect, and pray for. Sir, I am bold to inscribe it to your name, as a testimonie of my Gratitude for your unde∣served respect to me; and a pledge of my true desire to further you in your journey towards Heaven, by commending this Sermon to your Meditation, this Saint to your Imitation. These, with all other means of grace the Lord so blesse to you, that you may be sanctified throughout; and I pray God your whole spirit, and soule, and bodie be preserved blamelesse unto the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ. And with this Prayer I end. resting
