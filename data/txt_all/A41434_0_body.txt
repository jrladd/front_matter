MY LORD,
FIfty years since, or thereabouts, the name of Socinus and Socinians in Italy first began to be known: They are a Sect so carried away with their own fancies, under pre∣tence and colour of adhering to their own Natural Reason, that they deny the My∣steries of our Christian Faith and Religi∣on; which are indeed above Reason, be∣yond the reach of Reason, but no way contrary to Reason. This Sect of all others I have ever most hated and detested; the rather, because they pretend Philosophy and humane learning to back and to second them: which I know to be otherwise, and so I hope I have made it appear, and by Gods grace I will yet make it more manifest: for about 45 years since I had a publick disputation against them, and not resting there, I did resolve to examine every Mystery of Faith, and every Miracle wrought

in confirmation of those Mysteries (for so it pleaseth God that works above natural power should witness the truth of words above natural knowledge) according to the Rules of Philoso∣phy; and I began with the first, proving the fall of Adam from Paradise by Natural Reason. Not that I was able to prove the manner of the fall, as that it should be by tasting the forbid∣den fruit, by the tempting of a Serpent; but I shewed the truth and certainty of his fall, by those many punishments of sin, which are yet extant, and may be seen in Nature. And about 40 years since I set forth a book to that purpose; and although I say it, I had then the approbation and encouragement of those whom we did esteem to be the most learned men, as Bishop Andrews, Bishop Overall, Bishop Mountaine, and others. Then I proceeded to examine the rest of the Mysteries and Miracles, but especially the Wonders which Moses wrought in Egypt, whether they were sufficient assurances to the Natural man, for admitting and introducing the Mosaical Law. I did likewise examine the Resurrection of the dead, and the general Judge∣ment; and truly with these King James of blessed Memory was acquainted, and did not dislike them. I did then proceed to other Mysteries, and I did examine the several Visions of Scripture in Daniel, Ezekiel, the Apocalypse, how far they did agree together, and how necessary it was that there should be such Visions, to withdraw the Jews from their carnal conceits, and their expe∣ctation of Temporals. And after Scripture, I did then fur∣ther proceed what had continually hapned in the Church, and in succession of times did serve for the proof of Christianity. This I could not conveniently do, unless together I should write an History of the Church, how God had planted and preserved it. And here I reduced it as much as possibly I could, to this Island, wherein we live: but when once I came to the year 1517. being the eighth year of Hen. 8. then I made Annals, and set down every year constantly and particularly, what was done in the Church of England: First, I set down the then present state thereof, what liberties they had in respect of our common Laws, what Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and what great Reve∣nues; then what alteration did yearly befal the Church, and

so I had composed a great volume, which I did forbear to print in this regard; I thank God for it, I did never flatter any man, and I made a conscience to relate the truth; and doing it, I should have cast very foul aspersions upon some great Fami∣lies, which would have drawn much envy and hatred upon me whereupon I did resolve, that it should not be published, till after my death, and then it should serve as a Memorial of my Stu∣dies and Labors, and as a Testimonial of my Faith and Religion▪
Thus far I proceeded before the late Wars began. I hac then five several houses in my hand, and a little houshold-stuff in each house, (and now I have not one in all England▪ I thank God for it:) but in every house, what with fire and plundring together with other losses, my Notes and Writings miscarri∣ed (a just punishment of God upon me for my sins:) And in regard of my great age, I had thought never to have stirred any further, but to have prepared my self for my grave, and to desire God to be so merciful unto me, that I might die in quietness and peace, for my wants and troubles were great. And while I was thus resolved, it did plainly appear unto me, that the Socinians did increase; for I take no notice of any par∣ticular persons, but of publick acts: Some have been que∣stioned before the Parliament for denying the Trinity, and blaspheming Christ, yet I never heard that any were put to death, or greatly punished. I finde that the Fonts where we are baptized, and make profession of the Trinity, and the In∣carnation, they are generally pulled down. I finde that the solemnity and joy at Christs Nativity, was forbidden; that Fasting in Lent, and sorrow at Christs Passion, were by pub∣lick Order neglected; I found that all the Memorials of Christs Passion, the harmless Crosses▪ were demolished; I found no honor was given to the Name of Jesus, no setled form of Prayer, but every one left to his own inventions; nor was there any time appointed for prayers, but onely a little prepa∣ration for preaching; I found that in very many Parishes the Church-doors were locked up, and there was not so much as any publick Meeting, the Churches generally decaying, and ne∣ver repaired; that many men would not have their children Ba∣ptized,

and that many were Dipped, it should seem into some other Church; for if they were Christians, it is impossible they should deny the virtue and efficacy of their first baptism, no more then they can deny the Original sin, derived unto them from their first Parents. And I will insist in one parti∣cular, the White-thorn at Glastenbury, which did usually blos∣som on Christmas day, was cut down, yet I did not hear that the party was punished; certainly the Thorn was very extraor∣dinary, for at my being there, I did consider the place, how it was sheltred, I did consider the soyle, and all other circum∣stances, yet I could finde no Naturall cause; this I know, that God first appeared to Moses in a bramble bush; and that Aarons Rod being dried and withered did budde; and these were Gods actions, and his first actions; and tru∣ly Glastenbury was a place noted for holinesse, and the first Religious Foundation in England, and in effect it was the first dissolved, and therein was such a Barbarous inhuma∣nity, as Aegypt never heard of the like; it may well be that this White thorn did then spring, and began to blossom upon Christmas day, to give a Testimony to Religion, that it might flourish in persecution, as the Thorn did blossom in the cold∣est time of Winter (though the Sun in so great a distance might seem to want heat to bring forth the sap) so Religion should stand, or rather rise up, though Religious houses were pull'd down. I never heard nor read, that any Ancient Author did mention this Thorn, which certainly they had not omitted, if there had been any such thing; and by the growth of the Thorn, truly I did judge the age thereof to be much about the time of the dissolution of that Abbey.
I do accuse no man, but if I may judge of the inward faith, by the outward tokens and signes; then I must needs say, that it is high time (the Church being now undermined,) to set up props, and to raise up Buttresses, for the support of Christian Religion; and I bethought my self to whose office this did pro∣perly belong, Christ being the head-corner-stone, laid the foundation of his Church, the Apostles did finish the building; they were very carefull in the choyce of their successors, the first

thing they did after the Ascension of Christ, was the Electi∣on and choyce of Saint Matthias; and generally they had the Authority, Posuit vos regere Ecclesiam Dei. So then I did con∣ceive, that the generall care of the Church did belong unto them; and where things were not setled, and that there was no superiour amongst them, that then it did belong to every one of them in particular, but especially to the Eldest; for so in the state of Nature, the primogenitus had ever the care of Gods service; and in the Law Aaron was the eldest brother to Moses, and the High-priest hood was setled on him, and his Sons; and here I bethought my self, that having been these ten yeers, the ancientest Bishop in the Province, I was bound in conscience to do my uttermost indeavour, to strengthen and support Religi∣on; or at least to enter a Protestation, and to make a Publick confession of mine own Faith, that such as would might fol∣low my example; this I took as part of my duty, and office, to which I was bound, and obliged in conscience, and to have neglected this, I thought I should have greatly sinned; then I did think my self bound, to do the uttermost of my endeavours; and when I considered, that the custom of the Church in such like cases, hath ever been to implore Brachium seculare, to whom should I address my self, but to your Lordship, and humbly crave your assistance, and furtherance herein; and whereas for∣merly there was a course of Law, for the punishment of open and scandalous blasphemers, and that there were severall writs, de Excommunicato capiendi de haretico comburendo, &c. There being now no Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, that your Lordship would be pleased to be a means to the Honourable, and Reve∣rend Judges, to supply those wants; and to settle a course, where∣by there may be a legall proceeding against these publick and scandalous blasphemers, according to the true intent of the Law. Thus both in composing this Treatise, and for the De∣dication thereof to your Lordship, I have done no more, then what I thought my self bound in conscience to perform, and the rather to express my joy in some things, which have lately hapned; for living here in the Church-yard of Saint Margarets in Westminster, which was the Church proper to the Parliament,

for here they kept their thanksgivings, their humiliations, and all other their solemnities; when as in their time the Font was pulled down, and so continued demolished and in ruines, it is now set up again in a most decent and comely manner▪ and I hope it will be an example for other Churches to follow: so likewise they had a very solemn perambulation in Rogation week, according to the old manner; which had been omitted during the sitting of Parliament: and Holydayes begin to be kept; thus with joy and alacrity, not without hopes of good times to suceed, I thought fit to publish this Treatise, as containing the grounds of Christian Religion; for these are the two great and principall Mysteries, which all others pre∣suppose; and herein if we should waver, in the least kinde, then Christian Religion would faile and come to nothing; and by the publishing of these, it will appear what satisfaction I gave in all the rest of the mysteries; for these are the hardest and most difficult, and as I have performed in these, so let men judge of the rest; and if God shall inable me, and that I may have any competency of meanes to subsist, together with the use of a library; I shall then proceed in the rest God willing.
Thus much in generall, though I am a stranger, utterly un∣known, and never deserving the least favour from your Lord∣ship, yet I make bold to become a Petitioner. When I under∣took to write the History of the Church of England, especially in the time of Henry the eight, wherein there was the greatest Alteration and Change; knowing that the Lord Cromwell (your Lordships great Unckle) was then in great favour; for I have seen the Archbishops, and the Lord Chancellor Audley, their Letters unto him, to desire his help in furthering their suits to the King; and that he was then the only man imployed, espe∣cially in spirituall causes; for he did exercise the whole Ecclesi∣asticall jurisdiction under the King; and by virtue thereof, he took place of the Arch bishop of Canterbury, which never any subject did, and sat on the Bishops side in Parliament; I thought it very necessary and fit to hearken after his writings; and by the meanes of Sir Robert Cotton the great Antiquary (now with God) I had the perusall of his study, where I read all his Let∣ters,

Notes, and Papers; and where I found that it was the Lord Cromwell, who made that Order in the Church, that eve∣ry one should learn in the English Tongue the Apostles Creed: which may be some example and encouragement to your Lordship, to defend these mysteries of our Faith and Re∣ligion; which hath hitherto been my whole suit.
Amongst other Letters to the then Lord Cromwell, I found one from John Fisher Bishop of Rochester, a man famous for his devotion, learning and courage, when he was in far greater distress then ever I was (I thank God for it;) the effect of the Letter was, To desire his help for his relief: the Letter is yet extant, and may be produced. What effect it took, I cannot say; but I do not finde that it was ever seconded with any o∣ther Letter, which is usual in cases of distress, nor did the Bi∣shop complain at the time of his execution, when he was be∣headed; and therefore I conceive he found some relief. This hath encouraged me to become a Suitor to Your Lordship. I shall not here acquaint you with any particulars, (for this were to be over-troublesome) but I call God to witness, that I know no man, nor have I heard of any man, that hath suffered so much, in such several kindes, so unjustly, in proportion, as my self have done (though things are onely known to God and my self) and I have as fair Testimonials for my innocency, as any man hath, or can have in this world. I have been now five years petitioning for a hearing, if at length by your Lord∣ships good favour, I might prevail, you should for ever oblige me, that either I might know my offence, or otherwise that I might have some means (out of mine own) to subsist: The hearing cannot possibly take up half an hour, and I hope to dispatch it in less then half a quarter: for I will demand no∣thing for what is past, but do as heartily forgive all men, as I desire God to forgive me. And I will likewise make this mo∣tion, in behalf of my Brethren the Clergy, that what hath been violently taken from them, their cause never heard, or what a Committee hath done, being no Court of Record, being not upon Oath, and their power lasting onely during the Par∣liament, that men upon slight pretences might not lose their

Freeholds, to the great prejudice of the Liberties and Laws of this Nation; and Sequestrations, which are but for a time, might not be continued for ever, contrary to their own nature, but that men, upon submission and satisfaction, might be re∣stored to their own possession, until some just cause be shewed to the contrary in a legal way. Hereby your Lordship shall do God good service, discharge your own conscience, you shall for ever engage them, and give an earnest of your Justice and compassion. So humbly craving pardon for my boldness, with my prayers to God for your health and happiness,
MY LORD, 
June the 4. 1653. being the Eve of Trinity Sunday.
