COnscience; how thou wilt
take it I know not: however
I have adventured to write
a few lines unto thee, because
I know thou art well acquainted with
my Reader, and canst do much with
him if thou wilt; and if thou be a Good
Conscience thou wilt. Naturally good
I know thou art, I would hope that thou
art Spiritually good, purged from dead
works by the Bloud of Christ, Heb.
9. 14. and made good by the power of
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ,
1 Pet. 3. 21. and art able to give a rea∣son
by thy hope to be saved, 1 Pet. 3.
15, 16. and that thou standest upon
thy watch and ward against Sin, Sa∣tan,
and the World, 1 Tim. 1. 18, 19.
However thou art naturally good;



something thou hast retained since the
Fall, all is not lost: Reason, Know∣ledge,
and the power of Reflection thou
hast; and to speak according to thy
Knowledge, and to tell every one with
whom thou hast to do the truth how 'tis
with them, is thy essential property.
Even those (John 8. 6, 9.) that tempted
Christ, that they might have something
to accuse him of, were convicted of their
Consciences; their Consciences dealt
plainly with them, and told them the
truth, that they were not without sin.
Conscience, thou art the Candle of the
Lord searching the inward parts, the
most secret thoughts, desires, and in∣tents
of the heart, Prov. 20. 27. accord∣ing
to that of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 2. 11.
What man knoweth the things of a
man, save the spirit of a man within
him? Thou didst tell Pharaoh that he
was wicked, Exod. 9. 27. and Josephs
Brethren, that they were guilty, Gen.
42. 21. and Judas that he had sinned
in betraying innocent bloud, Matth. 27



3, 4. I pray thee do as much for my
Reader if thou see cause for it. It may
be thou art a well read Conscience in the
Law of God, enlightned and rightly in∣formed:
If thou be so, thou knowest
my Readers estate Godward, whether
good or bad, in the state of Grace or
Nature. Thou must needs know, for
thou art always at home with him, and
there is not a thought in his Heart but
thou art privy to it, nor a word in his
tongue but thou hearest it, nor a work of
his hand but thou seest it. God hath
made thee his Spy and Overseer, that so
thou mayst be a true Witness for or a∣gainst
him.
Conscience, thou canst tell whether
my Reader be a Child of wrath, as he
was born, Eph. 2. 3. or whether he be
born again, and so be a Child of God
by Faith in Jesus Christ, Gal. 3. 26.
Thou canst tell whether he be as yet
to this day in the gall of bitterness
and bond of iniquity, as he Acts 8.
23.


Thou canst tell whether he be in the
flesh, and do live after the flesh, or no.
Whether he be the same that ever he
was, or whether he be a new creature,
the workmanship of God by a second cre∣ation,
born of God and of the Spirit,
sanctified throughout, cleansed from fil∣thiness
of flesh and spirit.
Whether he worship God in spirit and
truth.
Whether he have onely the form of
godliness, or the power also.
Whether he be a Christian outward∣ly
onely, or inwardly also.
Whether a hearer onely, or a doer
also.
Whether he have onely a name to
live, or be alive indeed.
Whether he be barren and unfruit∣ful,
or fuitful in every good work.
Whether his Knowledge be effective
and operative, and so saving.
Whether his Faith be unfeigned, the
Faith of Gods Elect, working, purify∣ing,
conquering.


Whether his Repentance be Repent∣ance
unto life, bearing the fruits of
Carefulness, Clearing, Indignation,
Fear, Vehement Desire, Zeal, Re∣venge,
2 Cor. 7. 11.
Whether his Obedience be universal.
Whether he esteem all Gods pre∣cepts
concerning all things to be
right, and whether he hate every salfe
way, Psal. 119. 128.
Conscience, thou canst tell whether my
Reader have laid aside all malice and
all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies,
and evil speakings, as he is required,
1 Pet. 2. 1.
Whether he desires the sincee milk
of the word, that he may grow there∣by,
ver. 2.
And whether he do grow or not.
Whether he be contented with what
he hath attained, or whether he press
forward, after Pauls example, Phil. 3.
13, 14.
Whether he make Religion the great∣est
business he has to do in the world.


Whether Gods Word be his Rule in
all.
Whether Gods Glory be his end in all.
Whether he seek his own things, or the
things of Christ, most.
Whether his Heart be Godward,
Christward, Heavenward.
Whether his Conversation be in
Heaven, and his Affections upon
things above.
Whether he have oyl in his vessel as
well as in his lamp.
Whether he can prove his Vnion
with Christ.
Whether he has made his Calling
and Election sure.
Whether he be yet made meet for the
inheritance of the Saints in light.
Whether he love the appearing of
Christ.
And Conscience thou canst tell me
whether my Reader does live by the
Faith of the Son of God, as Paul did,
Gal 2. 20.
Whether he shew out of a good con∣versation



his works with meekness of
wisdom, Janies 3. 13.
What work and labour of love he
hath shewed towards the Name of
Christ, whether he have ministred to
the Saints, and do minister, Heb. 6. 10.
Whether he fulfill all the Wills of
God, as David did, Acts 13. 22.
Whether he follow God fully, as Ca∣leb
did.
Whether he be righteous before
God, walking in all the Command∣ments
and Ordinances of the Lord
blameless, as Zechary and Elizabeth,
Luke 1. 6.
Whether he be holy in all manner of
conversation, as he is required to be,
1 Pet. 1. 15.
Whether his Conversation in this
World be in simplicity and godly sin∣cerity,
2 Cor. 1. 12.
Whether he be zealous of good
works, Tit. 2. 14.
Whether the zeal of Gods House
do even eat him up.


Whether he be contented to be no∣thing
that God may be all, and to be
accounted vile so God may be ho∣noured.
Whether he deny himself, and take
up his Cross and follow Christ, Matth.
16. 24.
Whether he rejoyce in hope, and be
patient in tribulation, and continue
instant in prayer, Rom. 12. 12.
Now (Conscience) I have an earnest
request to thee; and seeing thou always
lodgest in the bosom of my Reader, thou
canst not want an opportunity to do
what I shall request of thee. My Re∣quest
is this, That thou wouldest deal
honestly with my Reader, and tell him
the truth of his estate what it is.
If he be a child of wrath, and in the
gall of bitterness and bond of iniqui∣ty,
tell him so, and say to him as Peter
to Simon Magus, Acts 8. 23. I per∣ceive
thou art in the gall of bitter∣ness
and bond of iniquity, a child of
wrath, and the wrath of God will come



upon thee if thou continue so, Eph. 5. 6.
If my Reader do live after the flesh,
(and sure thou canst tell whether he does
so or no.) Good Conscience, tell him
that he does so, and that if he shall con∣tinue
so to do, he shall die; and shew him
Rom. 8. 13. and bid him read it.
If my Reader do the work of the
Lord negligently, deceitfully; if he
offer to God a corrupt thing when
he has a male to offer, tell him of the
curse which hangs over his head, and
make him read Jer. 48. 10. Mat. 1. 14.
If he have no prayer in his Family,
cause him to read Jer. 10. 25.
If he remember not the Sabbath day
to keep it holy, give him no rest, till
thou hast gotten him to read and ponder
upon what is written Jer. 17. 27.
If he be an idle, slothful, unprofita∣ble
servant in the Lords work, shew
him Matth. 25. 30.
If he be an unfruitful tree in the
Lords vineyard, prevail with him (for
thou canst do it) to read again and



again the words of Christ Luke 13. 7▪
8▪ 0. shew him also Matth. 7. 17. and
Heb. 6. 7, 8. Say to him, Why dost thou
not take the Bible and read it?
Conscience, if my Reader believe not
in Jesus Christ, if he do not obediential∣ly
rest upon him alone for salvation, tell
him that if he do not believe the sooner
he must be damned, Mark 16. 16.
If he have not repented, if he have
not confessed his sin, and mourned
for it, and turned from it unto God;
tell him he must do it or perish, and shew
him Luke 13. 3, 5.
If he be unrighteous, good Conscience
tell him, that if he continue such, he
shall never inherit the Kingdom of
God. Compell him to read 1 Cor. 6.
9, 10.
If he be unholy, tell him, that he shall
never see the Lord; and let him not
be quiet till he has taken the Bible and
read it in Heb. 12. 14.
If he be unregenerate, tell him, he
cannot, (if he continue so) see the King¦dom



of God. Put the Bible into his
hand, and bid him read John 3. 35.
Conscience, if my Reader be a neg∣lecter
of that great Salvation profer∣ed
in the Gospel, and continue so, tell
him that he cannot escape damnation,
and shew him Heb. 2. 3.
If he turn away from him that
speaketh from Heaven to him, tell him
that he cannot escape the wrath of
God; and shew him Heb. 12. 25. and
Acts 3. 23. and ask him whether he be
not afraid of destruction?
And if he shall still refuse to hear∣ken,
and still pull away the shoulder, and
stop his ears, and make his Heart like
an Adamant stone, tell him that great
wrath will come upon him, Zech. 7.
11, 12.
Conscience, if my Reader be one of
that black catalogue 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. or
a doer of the works of the flesh, Gal.
5. 19, 20, 21. tell him, that he shall
not inherit the Kingdom of God.
And if he ask thee what warrant thou



hast to say so, refer him to the forecited
Scriptures.
Conscience, if my Reader should be
fearful, unbelieving, abominable; if
he should be a Murderer, a Whoremon∣ger,
a Sorcerer, an Idolater, a Liar;
tell him that if he continue such, he
must have his part in the lake that
burneth with fire and brimstone: and
make him read Rev. 21. 8.
Conscience, if my Reader be a proud
person, tell him from God, that God is
able to abase him, Dan. 4. 37. and will
be above him, Exod. 18. 11. and bring
him down, Psal. 18. 27. and low, Prov.
29. 23. even to destruction, Prov. 16.
18. and 15. 25. Get him also to read
Isa. 2. 11. to 18. and Isa. 3. 16. to the
end.
If my Reader be a covetous person,
good Conscience, let him know from the
Word of God,
1. That he is a troubler of his own
house, Prov. 15. 27.
2. That he is in Gods account an



Idolater, Col. 3. 5. Eph. 5. 5.
3. That he is hated and abhorred
of God, Psal. 10. 3.
4. That he is sorely threatned Isa. 5.
8. Isa. 10. 1, 2. Job 20. 15, 19, 20.
and 27. 16, 17, 18. 1 Cor. 6. 10. And
get him to read 1 Tim. 6. 9, 10.
And (Conscience) if my Reader be a
voluptuous person, an adulterous un∣clean
person, I must intreat thee to send
him to the Bible, and to see that he
read and consider these following Scrip∣tures
of the Old and New Testament;
Prov. 2. 18, 19. Prov. 5. 3, 4, 5, 6, to
14. Prov. 6. 26, 32, 3. Prov. 7. 21.
to the end of the chap. Prov. 22. 14.
Prov. 23. 27. Prov. 29. 3. Eccles. 7.
26. 1 Cor. 5. 9. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Eph.
5. 5, 6. Heb. 13. 4. Rev. 21. 8. and
22. 15.
Good Conscience, be at him again
and again, and never leave him till
thou hast gotten him to go into his Clo∣set,
and there to spend one quarter or
half an hour in pondering on these Scri∣.


Conscience, do thy office; thou art
Gods Deputy, fail not to be faithful.
Possibly thou mayest say, That thou
hast done it again and again, but they
will not hear, they are deaf to me as well
as to you. But Conscience, if thou be a
good Conscience, speak louder, speak not
with so low a voice, lift up thy voice
like a trumpet, for thou art ordained a
Preacher to shew my Readers their
transgressions and sins.
Be not silent whether they will hear,
or whether they will forbear, yet speak
unto them. I know my Readers, many of
them, will endeavour to silence and stop
thy mouth; they do not love to be told of
their faults, or what their estate is: but
Conscience be not thou rebellious, but do
that which is thine Office to do. I know
thou hast much to charge my Readers
with.
Some of them (thou knowest) do nei∣ther
read the Sriptures, nor pray in
their Families, nor Cathechize them
that are committed to their charge.


Others pray not in their Closets, nor
do they commune with their own hearts
about their spiritual estates; they exa∣mine
not themselves, whether they be in
the Faith, or whether Christ be in them;
they compare not themselves with the
Word of God, to know how it is with
them.
Some spend their time and strength,
and Estates in Rioting and Drunken∣ness,
in Chambering and Wantonness, in
Strife and Envying
Some trifle away their precious time
in Taverns, Ale-houses, Play-houses
Coffee-houses.
Some embrace this present World with
Demas.
Some are lovers of Pleasures more
then lovers of God.
Some acknowledge God in their words,
and in their works deny him.
Some have left their first love.
Some are lukewarm, neither hot nor
ld.
Some say, Lord, Lord, but will not do



the things that he says unto them.
Some believe not with their Hearts
what with their Mouth they say they
do believe.
Some confess sin with their lips, but
do neither mourn for it, nor hate it, nor
turn from it with their Hearts.
Some pray for that they would not
have.
Some hear the Word, but will not do
it.
Some love in word and tongue, but
not in deed and in truth.
Some fashion themselves according to
this world, yet would not be thought to
be of the world.
Some Dedicate and Devote their
Children to God, to the service of that
one God who is Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost; and when they have so done, they
alienate them from his service to the
service of the World, Flesh, and Devil,
breeding them np in Idleness, Pride, and
Wantonness. Never, or never to any
purpose minding them of their Baptis∣al



Covenant and Engagements, to be
holy and only the Lords.
Some neglect relative Duty, (as thou
Conscience knowest very well.)
Are not some Husbands bitter to
heir Wives, and some Wives disobe∣dient
to their Husbands?
Do not some Parents provoke their
Children to wrath? and do not some
Children dishonour their Parents?
Do not some Masters deny that which
is just and equal to their Servants? and
are not some Servants unfaithful to
their Masters? Dost thou not know all
this to be true, Conscience? Doubtless
thou doest, and doubtless thou doest of∣ten
nip and twinge them for it. But
good Conscience make them feel, make
them smart, let them not go on in peace,
disturb them, hannt them continually,
tell them their own, and take a fit time
and season for it.
My Reader does frequently, or some∣imes
at least, hear Sermons. Sermons
of the necessity of the New-birth, Faith,



Repentance, Holiness. Take this op∣portunity,
Conscience, of telling him the
truth. Say to him, Hearest thou what
the Preacher sayes? hath he not clearly
proved the necessity of New birth, Faith,
Repentance, Holiness, unto Life Eter∣nal.
What wilt thou do, Man, Wo∣man?
Thou art not New-born, thou
hast not believed nor repented, thou art
not Holy. Sure thou canst not enter in∣to
the Kingdom of Heaven, Joh. 3. 3.
Sure thou must be Damned, Mat. 16. 16.
Sure thou must perish, Luke. 13. 3. Thou
canst not see the Lord to thy comfort in
that unholy Estate thou art now in Heb.
12. 14.
My Reader prayes constantly, or some∣times
at least, and sayes, Lord give me
a better Heart, a new Heart, a clean
Heart, a soft Heart, a single Heart.
Lord, write thy Law in my Heart,
plant thy Fear in my Heart, put thy
Spirit into me, cause me to walk in
thy Statutes. Now, Conscience, tell h
the truth; say to him, Thou drawest



igh to God with thy lips, but thy Heart
is far from him. Thy Lip doth ask
these things of God, but thy Heart does
not desire them; thou art well enough sa∣tisfied
and contented, though thou be
denied.
My Reader is sometimes busy in his
Calling: Conscience, go to him and say,
O how busy thou art for back and belly!
what provision makest thou for thy soul?
My Reader is sometimes at a Feast,
or at his own Table: go to him, Consci∣ence,
and say, O how sweet this meat is
to thy taste! when shall the Word of
God, and the meat indeed, and the drink
indeed, be as sweet?
My Reader is sometimes in a Tavern,
Ale-house, or Coffee-house. Conscience,
when he has done his necessary business
there, go to him and say, Is not thy Fa∣mily,
or Closet, a fitterplace for thee to
be in?
Sometimes he is walking in the fields:
Conscience, go to him and ask him what
e is meditating on, and put him in



mind of Isaac's practice, Gen. 24. 6.
My Reader is sometimes sick: go t
him, Conscience, and say, This is th
just hand of God upon thee: and bi
him take his Bible and read Jer. 4. 18▪
Sometimes my Reader takes Physick▪
go to him, Conscience, and say to him▪
When wilt thou be at so much cost for
thy soul? when wilt thou spare so much
time from thy business for thy soul?
when wilt thou keep thy Chamber a day
or two for thy souls health?
Possibly my Reader has lately been
recovered out of a dangerous fit of sick∣ness:
go to him, Conscience, and put him
in mind of is sickbed prayers and pur∣poses,
and say to him, Sin no more, lest
a worse thing come unto thee.
Conscience, have but a very little pa∣tience
more, and I have done. Some of my
Readers, thou knowest, have lain under
the meanes of Grace a long time Vncon∣verted;
would I could perswade thee 
force them to read Heb. 6. 7, 8. Jer. 
29. Ezek. 24. 13, 14. Mat. 23. 37, 38.



Luke 19. 41, 42. 2 Cor. 13. 5. and not
let them be quiet until they have mused
a while on each. Conscience, I am in
care and fear about my Readers, lest
that dreadful Message be sent to them,
that once was sent to Israel of old, Isa.
6. 9, 10. with Rom. 11. 18. I beseech
thee, Conscience, suffer them not to eat,
drink, or sleep in quiet, until they have
fixed their thoughts a while on this
Message after the reading of it. Con∣science,
I am out of hopes of my Readers
welfare, unless thou be the more vigi∣lant,
agent, and faithful in doing thy
office. Wherefore I beseech you, nay I
charge you, as once Paul charged Timo∣thy,
2 Tim. 4. 1. before God and the
Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
quick, and the dead at his appearing
and his Kingdom; preach the Word
to my Reader, be instant in season, out
of season; Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort
him, and continue thy speech to him (as
once Paul did to his Hearers Acts 20.
7.) until midnight, rather then fail of



prevailing with him. There are a few
other Scriptures, which I desire my Rea∣der
might peruse, viz. 1 Sam. 2. 25.
2 Chro. 25. 16. Pro. 29. 1. But, Con∣science,
if thou wilt not by earnest and
continual urging compel him, he will
not bestow the time, nor take the paines
to do it. In hope thou wilt be faithful
to my Reader, I shall add no more save
only the promise of my prayers that thou
mayst be so.
