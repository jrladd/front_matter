HOsanna's only we could once Aspire;
But now Sing Hallelujah's in the Quire.
The KING Return'd, and with him Halcy'on dayes,
Turns mournfull Elegies to Psalmes of Praise.
Your Foes a Fall receiv'd, but You a Palme,
n such a Juncture David penn'd a Psalme.
en Royal Psalmes (Dread Sir) to God your King;
You ours, and give Your Subjects leave to Sing.
ee'l take our Harps, which on the Willowes hang,
Our KING in a strang Land, no Song we Sang.
ardon (Great Prince) what's rudely here Compil'd,
Tis not a Man presumes thus, but a Child.
