SIR,
IT may make you the more to admire at my boldness, that in a midnight as not known to you, I shall nevertheless present these more then ordinary respects; I acknowledge till the Magi of those that rightly knew you had crown'd my tenders with the Laurels of your deserts, I had not laid down this Dedication otherwise, then at the feet of your Eminent Qualifications, as of a proxi∣mity to what still remains of the surviving Nobili∣ty. Sir, I have plac'd you in the Front of my He∣roe's, not disputing after so confirm'd a survey of you by your Friends, that I could not chuse a more fortunate Star to direct these my services, then to your self; as I am informed with your own Pen you have begun with the life of Adam, the creation of History, give me leave after your Italian Victory, to entertain you with these Brittish Triumphs, which take their rise from the Christian Cross of Constantine the Great, and sit down within the Herodian short-liv'd Protectorships. Sir, as to the undertakings of History, you are not unac∣quainted that Judgement and a signaliz'd Imparti∣ality
eternizes an Historian. That oyl is adjudged the best that hath no taste; that Authour should be the most preferr'd that hath the least tongue of inte∣rested affections, a candour of course being due to him that waves the chiding of the present times, in hopes that after Ages may excuse him. Seamen ob∣serve that the waters are the more troubled the near∣er they come to the Land, because broken by reper∣cussion from the shore; I am sensible (though that I cannot imagine wherefore) of the same danger, the nearer I approach to the times, and the end of this History, the more subject some will be to censure what they have so little wit as to interpret to them∣selves. One writes, if he did not invent the words himself, that Machiavel used to say, that he that un∣dertakes to write a History should have no Religi∣on; if so (sayes he) glossing on his own wit, Ma∣chiavel himself was the best qualified in his age to be an Historian; the Gentleman is much mistaken, alas he was but a simple fellow to the Religious Je∣suites of our times, as he wanted the Holy Vest∣ments, the Vizards of Scripture to gild over his designs. Some entertain this position, that the Hi∣story of these present times must not be written by any one alive, which in my opinion is disgraceful to an Historian, and very prejudicial to posterity; as if they were to write at a distance, that obscuri∣ty might protect their mistakes from discovery: others also say, the Truth is not ripe enough to be writ in the Age we live in, which proves too rotten
for the next generation faithfully to report: these men are extreamly mistaken, for when Impresses of memorable matters are almost worn out, the Hi∣story having more of the Authors hand then foot∣steps of truth therein, must needs suffer; sure I am that the most informative Histories to posterity, and such as are highly priz'd by the Judicious, have been written by eye-witnesses; such Historians as live in the Times, not by the Times; thus Thu∣cidides reports impartially of the Pelopenesian War. Indeed St. Peter followed Christ afar off, so Politicians would not have the Historian to tread on the heels of the times, lest the times tread on his heels; the truth is, we live in such a warlike tra∣gical Age, best to write of, but not to write in. Sir, if Wit be such a Plant that it scarce receives heat enough to keep it alive in the Summer of our cold Climate, how can it chuse but wither in the so long and sharp a Winter of our Civil Uncivil Discon∣tents. If my endeavors meet with any acceptation in this our English world, it must be from such un∣derstanding Persons as your self, as it will remain a perpetual memorial to your name, as first brought forth under the Sphere of your tuition and Good∣ness. Worthy Sir, together with the respects I tender to your honoured self, I have entertained it as a Case of Conscience to transmit to the next Age some short Intimations of these times, as any wise Historian may justly fear that Records are not so carefully kept in these so many changes, as they
have been in former Ages; as to the breviary of these Lives, I can only apologize, that no wise man can expect to cut and pollish Diamonds with so little pains as we do Marbles; the chiefest matters contained in Gyant-like Volumes is to be found in this, like a little Watch showing the time of the day as well as a great Clock. Sir, lest having written a Preface in respect of these tedious Lines, you should mistake them for another, I shall end with this short ejaculation, that as Fortune, whom the Poets have so long feign'd blinde, hath opened her eyes to look upon you as to your desires and deserts, so I wish you may enjoy her favours as many more happy Years as there are Lives in this Book. Thus Sir, at the high Altar of my Respects, I lay down this Sacrifice, be pleased to accept the Oblation from the hands of
