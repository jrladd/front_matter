SIR,
WHilest every one meditates some fit Offering for Your Majesty, such as may best agree with your happy



Exaltation to this Throne; I presume to offer, what my Father long since writ, to shew the weight and importance of the English Crown.
It was by him stiled Poli∣tical Arithmetick, in as much as things of Govern∣ment, and of no less concern and extent, than the Glory of the Prince, and the hap∣piness and greatness of the People, are by the Ordina∣ry Rules of Arithmetick, brought into a sort of Demon∣stration. He was allowed by all, to be the Inventor of this Method of Instruction; where



the perplexed and intricate ways of the World, are explain'd by a very mean peice of Science; and had not the Doctrins of this Essay offended France, they had long since seen the light, and had sound Fol∣lowers, as well as improve∣ments before this time, to the advantage perhaps of Man∣kind.
But this has been reserved to the felicity of Your Ma∣jesty's Reign, and to the expectation which the Learned have therein; and if while in this, I do some honor to the Memory of a good Father, I



can also pay Service, and some Testimony of my Zeal and Reverence to so great a King, it will be the utmost Ambi∣tion of
SIR,
