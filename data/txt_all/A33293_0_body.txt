My Lord,
TO whom could a Discourse of this nature (I mean, A Thanksgiving Sermon, for the happy Deliverance of our Royal David from the hurtful Sword) be more fitly Dedicated, than to your Honour, who so deeply shared in the Dan∣ger with His Majesty?
Accept of it, Noble Sir, not for its own Worth, but as a Specimen of the Author's Sense of Your's, and his Obligations to You.
You, by that of Vertue, are arrived at the Tem∣ple of Honour. Sir, I beseech Almighty God, that You may be ever in the Ascendent, and that no malign Aspect may intervene, at least to sully, much
less Eclipse Your Splendor; till this Mortal shall have put on Immortality, and You your Self become a Fixed Star in Heaven, where is no Vicissitude or Alteration. Thus Prayeth
