SIR,
THough I know your Character is adorned with so much Goodness and Humility, that it could dispense with, and excuse even such a pre∣sumption as a Dedication of the following Piece, yet I must with Modesty decline such Pretensions, and own, That tho' its innate Defects are not so ob∣noxious as are supposed, yet its publick Misfortune has so lessened its Reputaion, as has made it unca∣pable of deserving such an Honour.
My whole Extent of Ambition then is, having ths Opportunity of the Press, (instead of it) most humbly to dedicate my self, a Presumption perhaps litle inferiour to the other; nor can I forbear to brng you what all the rest of my Tribe do to In∣dulgent Patrons, viz. an Inconvenience—whilst Poetical Impertinence attends the good Offices you do, and Generous Condescension and Good Nature creates your Trouble.
But Sir, be pleased to remember however, That you are the Cause of this Inconvenience—Had you been less affable and obliging, I had been more imorous and modest. Had your eye shot the haugh∣ty Austerity upon me of a right Courtier, great i Dignity and Office, mine had quickly been dazled and had seen no farther; nor had your valued mi∣nutes ever been disturb'd with dilatory Trifles o this Nature; but my Heart, amongst the rest of th World, on dull Consideration of your Merit, had supinely wish'd you Prosperity at a distance, tha now, warm'd by your Influence, and embolden' by your Smiles, can be contented with nothing les than laying it self at your Feet, and pretending to the particular Honour of your Favour.
Condescension to grant Admittance, and Gene∣rous Will to do good Offices, are rare Virtues in Great Men at Court; and he is fortunate whos Dependance there answers his Expectation. Bu when a Poet's happy Stars guide him to one who not only is glad to meet occasion to befriend him, but that eagerly seeks it out, who though continu∣ally fatigu'd with great Employments in the State, and hourly busied in the noble Service of his King and Cuuntry, yet will generously spare a few Mi∣nutes from publick Affairs to do an humble Suito a good Turn; one that never entertain'd such a on without a welcome Smile, if he could effect his

Desire, or a good natur'd, courteous and modest Dismission, if he could not: One that, tho' a Cour∣tier, never forgot his Promise, but perpetually gives the World occasion to own his Word as sacred as his other Virtues. Tis to a Mecaenas like this my Heart devotes it self; 'tis him it will admire; nor is it possible for me to suppress its Ambition.
Now Sir, since every discerning Judgment must allow this to be your Character, be pleased to par∣don me, who write it as a plain Truth, not as Praise, but your undoubted Due: For I dare no more pre∣tend to praise you, than presume to equal your Wit or other Excellencies. My Design is only grate∣fully to acknowledge and publish to the World how much I am obliged to your Virtues, without les∣sening their Value by my unnecessary Applauses.
Amongst all good Qualities that seem Praise-worthy in human Nature, the most proper and most reasonable is Gratitude; and amongst all persons, on whom for Benefits received there is a Duty In∣cumbent, I, Sir, am most obliged to own my Ac∣knowledgments to you: for never had any one less Opportunity to deserve your Kindness, nor ever had any one more generous or hearty Proofs of it. And since 'tis decreed that my humble Fate will permit me to express my Gratitude no other way than by Expression, Thanks, and verbal Acknowledg∣ment, That, Sir, whilst I live be pleased to believe

you shall hourly receive, large and unbounded as your Generous Intentions to me.
Amongst all your numerous Favours, be pleased, Sir, to let me own the first, (which shall eternally grow to my Heart and Memory,) which was your sending for me to introduce me to The late Adored Queen of ever Glorious Memory: Of all whose graci∣ous Smiles on me, enrich'd with Royal Bounty, you and your good Lady, my ever honoured Patroness, were the happy Causes. When Majesty, like the Sun, shone with a Heavenly Influenee, you took care to plant me in the View, and gave me the Op∣portunity of receiving the Grace that follow'd; nor did you stop there, but afterwards made me known and honoured me with your good Word to most of the principal Nobility, the true Patrons of Po∣ets and their Art, by whom I have not since been forgot, and whose Favour is a certain Fortune to any Son of the Muses. And this most generous and uncommon Grace, Sir, when I cease to remem∣ber, or fail in point of Duty, you may certainly take it for granted, I am ceased to be at all.
And now Sir, That my Ambition may know its bounds, and soar no farther, let me beseech you to accept of this Dedication of my self and Duty; and likewise be pleased to receive this Trifle of a Play, ack'd to it to divert you a Minute, when such a

space from Business will permit: For I am not ig∣norant, no more than the rest of Mankind, of the troublesome Diligene your Zeal for the King and your Country exacs from you, the Care of your great Charge and Offices, or of the Envy your Virtue raises in ill Men; yet I am confirm'd it can∣not possibly turn to your Prejudice, but that as you was an Honour to the last Parliament, you will still be acknowledged so to this, and raise your Reputation yet higher, (if possible) to an Emi∣nence equal to your Merit; whilst I with Pride fix my Fame at its Ne plus ultra, in bearing the Title of,
SIR,
