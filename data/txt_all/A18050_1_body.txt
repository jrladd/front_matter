RIght Worshipfull, after I had prea∣ched this Sermon, I conferred with some of my brethren about the pub∣lishing of it, and some aduised me to print it, others to conceale it for two causes: First, because the world is full of bookes: Se∣condly, because it would make me lyable to many censures and imputations.
For the first, I answer, that the world is full of bookes, but that it is too full of godly bookes, I could neuer heare it prooued. Se∣condly, I know that I shall bewray mine own weakenes exceedingly, and expose my selfe to many hard censures, by publishing this Pam∣phlet; and yet for all that, I choose rather to
 be hated, to make my selfe a by-word, and a reproach, then to neglect any course that may turn to the good, though but of one soule; yea, and if it should turne to the good of none, yet shall I sing but to the same tune that o∣thers of Gods seruants haue done before me: I haue laboured in vaine, and spent my strength to no purpose, Isa. 49. 4.
Whatsoeuer I haue done, I haue made bold also to present it to your Worships, as a testimonie of my thankefulnes vnto you all, and a meanes to reuiue and continue, (as much as in me lies) the deserued memorie of your godly brother, whome from my soule I loued in his life, and from my soule desire to honour in his death. If this poore mite may be accepted of you, and profitable to Gods Church, I haue my desire: which that it may be, I haue praied: and so praies still,
