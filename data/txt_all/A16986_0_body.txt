THe Eternal testified of Abraham, how he would teach his house to keep holy wayes. That hath story in Iobs book: where most learned Princes, five of his howse, shew Gods wayes for Christ: in such eloquence, that may argue applying of all knowledge and their dayes that way. The stile is in his language for verse, shortnes, and strange words, as Pindarus in Greek: and fuller of difficultie, then all the other books of Adams tongue: And hath cost me time and paines accordingly: more then my translation of the Prophets volume into Greek: which work I think your Maiestie hath: & more then my shewing of Scripture concent: and defending of it, against D. Reinolds and Mr Livelie, having 2000 yeres Libraries on their side: and more then my clearing of Daniel, and Apocalyps, to admiration of thowsands. God would have this book as a Iewel hid in the ground, not seen playn without paines. What I have done for your nations use, the King should judge & re∣compence accor∣dingly.
