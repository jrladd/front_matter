SENECA that noble Christian E∣thnick (for so doth ERASMVS for his singularitye of profound wysedome & iudgemēt terme im) willeth vs in bestowing of any gift o bee carefull, that it bee both such, as s fit for the estate of the Gyuer, and al∣so meete for the Cōdition of the Recei∣er. Els, in steede of expected thankes, isgrace may growe: and what the Gy∣er meaneth of goodwill, may (perhaps)  the Receiuer (eyther lymping in iudg ent, or freezing in delight) bee litle garded, & lesse coūtenanced. For my rt I haue (as I thīk) not much swerued erein, frō the soūd aduise of the afore∣named

Philosopher, in makīg you Patrōs of this litle worke, and that for two spe∣ciall respects: the one, for that, it trea∣teth of such matter, as is peculierly ap∣pendant to your worthy faculty, where∣by you are in profession best able there∣of to iudge: thother, because it was pen∣ned and gathered by one, whose name is to mee vnknowen, who neuerthelesse seemeth heereby to bee a hearty embra∣cer and well. VViller of your excellent Arte and function: and therefore in that respect, are you the meetest, and in my opinion the fittest to defend his la∣bours, & to become Guardiās to this his poore mangled and forsaken Orphane. The faults which (in deed) through neg¦ligence or ignorance of them that had the charge and ouersight of the Prynt∣ing thereof, are vnhappily chaunced, I am to request you being shilfull, eyther gently to amend, or friendly a whyle to tolerate, till eyther letter oportunitie serue to refourme them, or that the au∣ther and compiler (if hee be liuing) may

hymself peruse and recognyze the same. The holy Ghost blesse you and your La∣bours in that your so noble an office & profession, hauinge so excellent a Sub∣ject to worke vpon, as Man is, the per∣fectest and excellētest of all Creatures, and for whom al others were made and created.
From Butley in Chesshyre, the
19. of October. 1580.
