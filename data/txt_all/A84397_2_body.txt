WHereas (my brethren) I am very sinsible of the great taxes and burthens that do at present lye upon you, and all the whole Commonwealth, occasioned partly by divers of your stubbornesses to the honorable Parliament of England, who either Jew-like, or Herodian-like, desired ra∣ther to have a temporal King, called Cesar in that age, and Charls Stuart in this age, then to have their King Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, who hath shed his innocent blood for to re∣deem your souls from eternal damnation, albeit it was expresly against the second Petition of the Lords prayer, which you stand so much for; and whereas his Excellency and the present English Armies, I am confident, be right sorry to see you so e∣very day taxed and rated, Sequestred or plundered, if you would live peaceably and quietly in the present Commonwealth, and joyn together, and repaire to his Excellency or his Counsel of war, to Petition his Excellencie and armies to be a means to help to take off your taxes and burthens, upon condition you will joyn with them for the fitting and setting out of the ship describ∣ed by the ensuing remonstrance, to bring home Justice and Mer∣cy again into this land; for after they be seated in their proper places in this Commonwealth, there will be little or no use for
 further taxes or burthens in this Commonwealth; for of a truth then will the Lamb and Lion couch and lie down together, ac∣cording to that ancient prediction of the Prophet Esay. There∣fore, that Gods Judgements may be turned from this Nation, and your selves in particular, threatned this month, by the un∣usual Solar Eclipse happening the 29 of March 1652, and other eminent dangers besides, if you follow this seasonable advice, your taxes vnd burthens shall be taken off, and so I rest,

Given from my quarters this 7. day of March 1651. in the 16 week of my abstinance from food, for yours and the soldieries sakes, and the glory of Gods mercy in Christ.
