SIR,
THE Knowledge which I acquired by my Study and Experience in the Art of

Glass, has Retriev'd several Im∣portant Secrets, which for a long time lay Buried in Obli∣vion: Of these I at length re∣solved to Compose a Treatise; and I here make bold to In∣scribe it to your Illustrious Name, that they may be once more Restored to this King∣dom. If your Honour pleases to look over the Wonders here∣in delivered, you'll be satisfied I have found out and added se∣veral Curious Things of my own Invention, as well relating to the Secrets of Nature, as the most profound Science of the Adepti, or Ancient Philoso∣phers.
Hence it is, Sir, I am to hope You'll Receive this Fa∣vourably; that under the Ho∣nour of your Protection, it may meet with Acceptance A∣broad: For if You grant Your Approbation, the World will not deny it Theirs. Permit therefore, Illustrious Sir, that I may Impart the Secrets of this Noble Art to the Publick, un∣der your Auspicious Patronage: Which is the Most Humble Request of him who Subscribes himself with all Imaginable Respect,
