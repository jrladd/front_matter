Most Gracious, and Dreadfull Soveraign,
THE Pretended Parliament of England having their Agents la∣tely in the Low Countryes, trea∣ting with the United Provinces about conditions of an offensive and defensive war, my resolution was to have set out this Remonstrance in the Dutch tongue for the satisfaction of those Provinces: but the treaty ended almost as soone as I began to actuate my resolution; whereupon I altered my purpose, and have now set it out in English for the satis∣faction of your own Subjects, hoping the truth
being here clearly illustrated, may have some effect upon their Consciences, which cannot but have great sway over them in ordering and directing their Actions. Experience teacheth that most men act lesse boldly and resolutley, (e∣specially where their lives must be engaged) when they act against their Conscience, then when they are perswaded of the lawfullnesse and justice of their cause. There hath been more blood spilt by civill war in your Majesties do∣minions within the space of ten years, since those pernicious principles touching the Supre∣macy of the People and lawfulnesse of re∣sistance have been instilled into mens mindes by some who fetched their doctrine from Hell to furnish the world with tragedies, then formerly in an Hundred. I conceive the nearest and rea∣diest way to reform such un-christian practises, is to reform the Conscience; although I deny not but more sharp and violent remedies must also be applyed: for some have lost all sense of Conscience, whom your Majesty, I hope, assist∣ed by the almighty providence of God, shall re∣form
by the Sword. This is that which Religi∣on calls for at your hands, now oppressed by such a multitude, and confused swarm of Sect∣aries, that I should think it impossible for so many men of severall Religions to live together in unitie, did not the Likenesse of their Na∣ture and Manners reconcile their affections, as much as their differences in Religion can alie∣nate and estrange them. And this is that which all your faithfull Subjects pray for, who desire nothing more in this world then to see your Ma∣jesty seated in your Royall Throne, and able to protect them from the insolencies of the Re∣bells, who make their will their law, disposing as freely of mens lives and fortunes, as if they had created them and given them their Be∣ing.
It is a rule in Opticks, when a dark body is greater then a light to which it is directly op∣posed, it casteth a shadow in infinitum: Such a shadow (if the continent were capable of an infinite shadow) will the dark body of the Re∣bells cast upon the Kingdome of England, whilst
it is interposed between your Majesty and your loyall Subjects, depriving them both of your fa∣vourable Aspect, and of your Light and Influ∣ence, without which they can look for nothing but a continuation of their present miseries: for should the Rebells prevaile and prosper in their designes, what else can be expected, but that which is wrested from others by Force and Vi∣olence, should be maintained by Tyranny and Injustice? But whilst they wade in blood to places of preferment and command, the Lord shall overthrew them in the middest of their course, as he overthrew the Aegyptians in the Red-sea; I usurp not the name of a Prophet, but I speak as one believing God to be a faith∣full observer of his promises: He will not always be deafe to the prayers and complaints of those that are oppressed, but send them diliverance in his due time, and supply your Majesty with all things necessary both to vindicate your own Rights, and free your People from their op∣pression.
