KNowynge youre
Honor amongst o∣ther
your good de∣lyghtes,
to delyght
moste in reading of
Hystories, the true
Image and portrature of Mans lyfe,
and that not as many doe, to passe
away the tyme, but to gather there∣of
such iudgement and knowledge
as you may therby be the more able,
as well to direct your priuate acti∣ons,
as to giue Counsell lyke a most
prudent Counseller in publyke cau∣ses,
be it matters of warre, or peace:
I that haue no other meane to shewe
my thankfull mynde towardes your
Honor from tyme to tyme, but with
yncke and Paper: thought I coulde
not wryte of anye thing more plea∣sing,
or more gratefull, than of those
preceptes that belong to the order

of wryting and reading Hystories,
which preceptes I partly collected
out of the tenne Dialogues of Fran∣cisco
Patricio, a Methodicall writer of
such matter, and partly out of a lit∣tle
written Treatyse, whych myne
olde friende of good memorie, Ac∣contio
did not many yeares since pre∣sent
to your Honor in the Italian
tongue, of whych my labour and
good wyll, I most humbly beseech
your Honour to allowe▪ wyth that
fauourablle iudgement, which you
haue alwayes heretofore vsed to∣wards
me, and therwith to continue
my good Lord vntyll I shall
deserue the con∣trary.
