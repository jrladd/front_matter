THERE want not (Deare Mother) vvho vvith their newe gifts, wil impart to you the hopes of an hap∣py yeare: vveary I no lesse then your selfe, of nouelties, present you rather with a jewell of no lesse antiquity, then price: which long hath vnworthely layen hid, when most of all stood the ver∣tue thereof in request. Stale it is not, nei∣ther doth the age thereof diminish the esti∣mation, but enhaunce it: quality of writers

and Authors being now at that passe, that by proportion of antiquity their value commeth to be rated. No otherwise then as in pretious stones and gold is common∣ly accustomed, the first whereof the more families they haue enriched and beautifi∣ed, lesse are held in suspect; the later, howe much farther yeares it pretendeth in the stampe, fayrer currence it common∣ly findeth in the exchaunge, countenance being deriued from the continuance. Meruaile not if to you a woman, I tran∣slate a Diuine; to one nothing curious in controuersies, send a Father of the primi∣tiue Church. No Author this aboue your reach; no high discourse of difficile que∣stions: but being deliuerer of a playne hi∣story, fuller of excellent examples, and pithy motions to perfection, then of subtle points or intricate matters; I judged no∣thing more worthy on which you might employ your vacant houres, or I my time and trauaile. Great plenty of things deser∣uing mature cōsideration herein you haue: peruse them, vse them, print them in your minde; and what you admire in others, apply to your selfe.
