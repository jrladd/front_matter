IF the care of a most compassionate,Dr. Cox and in∣genious Physitian: If the prayers of good men in this City, and in the University, had been sufficient preservatives against the assault of death, there had been no occasion for the preaching, or publishing of this Ser∣mon: That I should preach at his Funeral was his request, to whom I might lawfully deny nothing: that I should publish it, is the request of his Friends, whom I heartily respect, whom I was the more induced to gratifie, that I might have an oppor∣tunity to tell you what thanks my dead Friend had for all the expressions of your love to him; how deeply hee resented them, and how much resolved hee was to testifie his thankfulness by a serious and conscientious care of your souls.
