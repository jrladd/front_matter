Humbly Sheweth,
THAT for many Years last past, your said Petitioners have labour'd under great difficulties; and many Inconveniencies, in Adventuring for Tin, even to the wasting of our Estates, and ruine of our Families, who have been distinguish'd from others of your Majesties Subjects only by our Suffe∣rings: as more at large Appeareth in a Narrative hereunto Annex'd (tho' we have alwaies practis'd (under all Governments) That Passive Obedi∣ence, which others have only talk'd of.
Therefore humbly pray; That your Majesty would be graciously pleas'd to grant us the like freedom with other of your Majesties Loyal Subjects, in the disposal of our goods; And that we may stand on an equal foot with all other Tradesmen, which will enable us to Carry on our deserted Adventures with Alacrity; To the Advance∣ment of your Majesties Revenue; and the Support of our Languish∣ing Families: And your Petitioners shall ever pray (as in duty bound) for your Majesties long and happy Reign over us.
