IF such a haue paynefully and fayth∣fully of long time ser∣ued their Prince and Countrey abroade, doo most of all others de∣serue, beside their con∣digne reward, the be∣nefite of a quiet and contented life at home, I knowe no man (good Syr VVylliam Fitzwylli∣ams) that of right may better chalenge it, then your selfe: who for the long time of your painefull seruise, the trustie discharging of the treasureship of Ireland, and your woor∣thy gouerment (whyle it pleased her most excellent Maiestie to appoynt you for the saide Realme her highnesses Deputie) haue so bhaued your selfe, as euen your very enimies (whereof I knowe you had goo store) haue been forced to geue you, wyll they nyll they, your iust deserued commendation. I leaue to remember your sundry and troublesome trauayles, your Gentelmanly minde, al∣wayes vnweeried and vnmated with what so euer peril or hazard happened: I passe ouer (because I knowe you delight not in hea∣ring your prayses) that honourable, and woorthy for euer to be Chronicled, charge geuen vpon the Oneale at Monham in the res∣cue of your miserably distressed and slaughtred companions, and countreymen, of which there be sundry yet remayning, that wyl attribute the hauing of their liues (next vnto God) to the prospe∣rous

successe of your valeaunt enterprise: Neither hath this your loyall seruice to your Prince and Countrey at any time been vnac∣companied, without a feruent and zealous affection towardes the Almighty, the cheefest and only beauty of all mans actions. Since thus (as I said) you may iustly chalenge for the good seruice you haue done in your youth, a place and time of rest and quietnesse in your greater yeeres, and that there is, in my fancie, no life so qui∣et, so acceptable to God, and pleasant to an honest mind, as is the life of the Countrey, where a man, withdrawing him selfe from the miserable miseries, vanities, and vexations of this foolish and nowe tòtoo much doting world, may geue him selfe to the sweete comtemplation of God, and his woorkes, and the profite and reliefe of his poore distressed neighbour, to which two thinges we were chiefely created. I thought it good to send you here (as a token and testimony of my thankfull minde, for your sundry freend∣shippes and curtesies shewed vnto me) a rude draught of the order and maner of the saide Countrey lyfe, which you may vse (yf it please you) for your recreation: and afterwards (if so you thinke it meete) publish vnder your protection, to the commoditie and be∣nefite of others. Fare you well in great haste, from Kingstone, the fyrst of Februarie. 1577.
