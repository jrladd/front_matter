May it please your Majesty,
THIS Defence of the Albigen∣ses, the Antient and Illustrious Confessors, who some Ages ago enlightned the Southern Parts of France, is laid down at your Majesty's Feet for Your Protection, as well as their Successors do now fly into your Dominions for Relief. That Charity which moves your Majesty to protect them by your Gracious Favour, and support them by your Royal Bounty, makes me presume to offer this Histo∣rical Apology to your Sacred Ma∣jesty.
Their Faith was in most things the same with that which our Reformers taught in opposition to the Church of Rome; and after all the Endeavours that have been used to blacken them by the most horrid Calumnies, as well as to destroy them by the cruellest Inqui∣sitions and Croisades, the Innocency of their Lives, and the Exemplariness of their Deaths, makes them to be justly gloried in as the true Authors of the Reformation.
It was from them that this Church (now so happy in your Majesty) re∣ceiv'd the first Beams of that heavenly Light, which it now enjoys, and which it of late maintained with such vast Advan∣tages, that it is deservedly esteemed the chief Body, as well as the justest Glory, of the whole Reformation. The Perse∣cutions of those earliest Restorers of the

Doctrine of Jesus Chirst, drove them out of their Country, and forced ma∣ny to fly into this Kingdom for shel∣ter, who brought with them the first Seeds of those Truths which have since yielded so plentiful an Encrease. There is nothing in this History that will ei∣ther strike or charm. Those true Dis∣ciples of their crucified Master, were considerable for nothing but the Purity of their Doctrine, the Innocency of their Lives, and the Patience as well as the Constancy of their Sufferings. But the Glories of this World which sur∣round your Majesty, do not darken or lessen in your Esteem these distin∣guishing Characters of the Religion of Christ our Saviour, and of those his Suffering Members, in whose Afflicti∣ons you are pleased to take so great a share, that you do very much dimi∣nish

their own sense of them, and make them so much the easier by those vast Supports you give them.
May that God who has raised up your Majesty to support Religion, and protect its Confessors in their lowest Cir∣cumstances, and who has so miraculously preserved and prospered the King and your Majesty in Opposition to the E∣nemies and Persecutors of his Truth, still pour down the richest of his Blessings upon your Majesties; May You perfect what You have so gloriously begun; May You be Long, Great and Happy here, and infinitely Greater and Happi∣er for ever. These are the daily Wishes and most earnest Prayers of,
May it please your Majesty,
