WHen I had first gathered together these fewe simple Sonets, I tho∣ught nothing lesse, then to commit so vnskilful a collectiō of fond phan¦sies, vnto the Printers charge, hauing perswa∣ded my selfe before, that they were growen in a more frutelesse soile, and vnlearned head, then may well answer, either the expectacion of the freindly Reader, either the iudgements of the learned either the freidly eare to which I now commend thē, whose chearefull ledes of freind¦ship soen n me a frutelesse Feilde, do iustly require more profitable, & more plentifull  then these trifling toyes are. But afterwardes I had purposed to imprinte them, being requi∣red esones, by such a freind, to whose earnest request in this matter (after many denials) I did seeme (as reason wold) partly to yelde▪ ad∣uenturynge rather the blasing a brode of these few Phansies, to the plaine declaring of my vn learnednesse and ignorance, then by vnfreind∣ly denial to repel the earnest desiers of such my approued freinde. I thought none more meet

to whom I should present thē then, vnto you) my frend good Maer Lasiels) being a frend faithfull a hartie helper▪ & a welwiller of mine, not doubtyng, that you will as well accept the purpose of my Penne herein, as I do already conceiue of you by offering the same the only good will of my welmeaning harte. Though they be in deede bare toyes of small effecte, yet take them as chearefull as Lewes once King of Fraunce, accepted the hartie gift of a poore man, but a rude present for a Prince, being only a slender Radish roote, which he yet (conside∣ring not the value of the root but the good will of the geuer rooted in his hart) highly estemed before all other costly iuels. So if small gifts en crease a good opinion and a good opinion aug menteth loue, and loue by proofe establisheth freindship, and doth ratifie the same, I doubt not then, but that this signe and small gift, or rathe simple shift shalbe an occasion to ratifie that good will of yours with, my entent is ei∣ther to requite if I might, or remember as I can, or at the least wise not to treade it vnder foote as I will not, to shew such ingratitude,

the sauadge beast the Lyon woulde not, wher of Aulus Gellius maketh his reporte. Wherfore good Maister Lassels, receaue these my base and baraine labours, which in signe of this new returned yere I geue vnto you, commit∣ting it to the iudgementes of the skilful, whose fauour I craue, for that my Pen is not as well perfected as I would wish it, both for the Rea∣ders commoditie, and also the pleasure of you my freinde, for whose cause I knowe it shall beare the lesse reproche, and of some more accep¦ted, in doinge wherof I shall confesse a token of your friendship more added to the number of proofs which I haue at sundrie times recey¦ued of you before. Fare ye well.
