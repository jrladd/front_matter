SIR,
I Did not expect, when by your Command I had preach'd this Sermon of Obedi∣ence from the Pulpit, to have had the Point of my own Arguments turn'd so far upon my self as to be oblig'd also to send it to the Press, in perfect submission to your Authority, and

my own Doctrins. But I was loath to enter a Protestation against my self, and be the first that should resist a Person so much above me, and that ought to have an absolute Power o∣ver me, having pass'd such great obligations upon me. I shall not be so unreasonable, as to beseech you to protect what you have been pleas'd to bring forth; nor indeed am I much solicitous what fortune I meet with, being sa∣tisfied, that no man can hinder me from ac∣quiring that end I propounded in the Publica∣tion, which was onely to testifie what defe∣rence I bear to your Commands, and that by a more solemn notice, I might declare how much I am,
SIR,
