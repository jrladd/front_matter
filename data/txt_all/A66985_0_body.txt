'T Will need no Excuse, that I should lay any part of my Labours at your Majesties Feet, where all I can perform is so just a Debt, and but the natural effect of that Duty I owe, both as a Subject to the best of Prin∣ces, and as a Servant to the best of Masters; nor, I trust, will it be a Presumption in One, who hath had the Honour to stand by Your Majesty in some of those Dangers, where nothing, but that Divine Providence which preserv'd you for a Crown, could have been your Shield, to presage, that 'tis for some great and extraordinary Blessing to these Kingdoms, that you are now seated on the Throne. And it is most reasonable to expect, that, so much natural Good∣ness, so great Courage, and Bravery of Mind, so sacred a Reverence for your Word, so tender a regard to your Dependants, so true a Love to your Country, so invio∣lable Faith, and Allegiance to your Sovereign, all which made you so much admired whilst a Subject, should receive the greatest Lustre from a Royal Diadem; for they are but the same Vertues You have still to exercise in a larger Sphere.

These are the things that will now fill your Majesties Thoughts; and these the great things that will hereafter be registred by that Fame which al∣ready speaks you so great at home and abroad, and hath by your mighty Actions carried the Glory and Terror of the English Nation to the remotest Parts of the Universe: and I question not, but the nearer Parts of it, France and Spain, and those other your Allies, who have seen or felt your Cou∣rage, will dread to awaken it. 'Tis only Treachery (the heinous nature whereof I treat on in this following Discourse) can disturb your Reign: 'tis that which hath done so much Mischief already among us, and threatens more under the new Name of Trimming. God, who hath set you upon the Throne, and advanced your Triumphs by Sea and Land into an Absolute Sovereignty in both, grant that no Storm may from thence arise to infest you in either.
