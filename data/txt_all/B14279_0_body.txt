And that makes me so farre daring, as to presume to offer this Dedication to your faire acceptance; And howsoe∣uer my defects therein may happily (or rather vnhappily) be many: Yet am I most confident (and that growes from the worthinesse of your owne nature) that your Honourable minde will be pleased (since it casts it selfe most humbly in your armes) to giue it willing entertainement, and to countenance it with the faire Liuerie of your noble Name, It may bee slighted in respect of its owne valew, but your fauourable acceptance, will both grace it, and my selfe, as a poore Table hung vp, euen in Princes Gallories, not for the Wood, but for the Picture, And so (Noble Lady) not daring to bee iealous of your Honourable entertaine∣ment, I rest
