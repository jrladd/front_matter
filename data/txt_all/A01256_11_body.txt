YEt more (thrice worthy Lord) more of that vaine,
My idler times and youthfulnesse affected;
Agarb which 'mongst the gracefu'st wits doth raigne,
Whereto the choicest spirits are addicted:
Not that I place my wit amongst the pregnant,
And yet your Lordship, when that you haue seene them,
Shall see my starres haue not beene so malignant,
But my conceits do carry salt within them:
Though not like some, in such aboundant measure,
I may bee named, though they bee more noted,
To whom the Muses haue vnlockt their treasure;
Ennius (as artlesse as hee is) is quoted,
But hence vaine-boasting, Ile bee no Suffenus;
Onely your Lordships liking, and delight,
And pardon when there's any thing obscenous,
I hope, and craue; and where all goes not right,
Your Honour rather pitty then reproue,
Since Duty showes her ignorance for Loue.
