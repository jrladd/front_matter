AMong the Spartanes
right noble Lord, and sometime
my honorable Maister, nothing
was accounted more odious,
then the forgetfulnes of the ser∣uaunt
towardes his Maister:
which made Mucronius, who
had beene seruaunt to Hagar∣bus
a poore Artean, and for his vertues afterward cal∣led
to the office of a Senatou, in all assemblies to reue∣rence
his poore Maister, so that he would often say: It was
honour to Mucronius, that he had beene seruaunt to
Hagarbus.
Though this example (my good Lord) be vnfit for me,
in what respect, beseemes me not to speake: Yet that excellent
opinion of the Spartanes, I count it religion for me
to immitate. For if this vice was so despised among such
famous persons, what reproch wold it be to so poore an ab∣iect
as my selfe, beeing once so happy as to serue a Maister
so noble: to forget his precious vertues, which makes him
generally belooued▪ but cheerfly mine owne dutie, which
nothing but death can discharge, In remembraunce ther∣fore
of my officious zeale, I present your Honour the wil∣ling
endeuours of your late seruaunt: howe simple soeuer
they be, right perfect shall you make them by your fauoura∣ble

acceptaunce, this being added, that were I equall in a∣bility
with the best, all should be offered to my noble Mai∣ster.
If Palmerin hath sustained any wrong by my bad trans∣lation,
being so worthely set downe in other languages:
Your Honour hauing such speciall knowledge in them, I
hope will let slip any fault escaped, in respect I haue doone
my good will, the largest talent I haue to bestowe.
And seeing the time affordes me such oportunitie, that
with ending this first parte, the olde yeere is expired: I
present it my noble Lord as your seruauntes New yeeres
gift, and therewithall deliuer my most affectionate dutie,
euermore ready at your Honours commaundement.
Needelesse were it, by tediousnes to growe trouble∣some,
when a woord suffiseth to so sound iudgement: I sub∣mit
my selfe and my Booke to your gracious conceit, and
the second part, now on the presse, and well neere finished
I will shortly present my worthie Patrone.
In meane while, I wish your Honor so many New yeers
of happines, as may stand with the heauenly appointment,
nd my modestie to desire.
