MOst vertuous and woorthilie beloued daughter, Euen as from your first birth and cradle J euer was most careful, a∣boue any worldly thing, to haue you sucke the perfect milke of sincere Religion: So willing to ende as I beganne, I haue left to you, as my last Legacie, this Booke. A most precious Iewell to the comfort of your Soule, being the woorke of a most good,

learned, and worthy man; Made aboue fif∣tie yeeres since in Germanie, After by tra∣ueile a French creature, Now naturali∣zed by mee into English like to his learned Author, to whom from my part most Ho∣nour and seruice is due. Surely at the first I meant not to haue set it abroad in Print, but my selfe onely to haue some certaintie to leane vnto, in a matter so full of controuer∣sie, and to yeeld a reason of my opinion. But since by my lending the Copie of mine owne hand to a friend, I am bereft thereof by some; And fearing lest after my death it should be Printed according to the humors of other, and wrong of the dead, who in his life approued my Translation with his owne allowance: Therefore dreading, I say, wrong to him aboue any other respect, I haue by Anticipation preuented the worst. J meant this to you, good daughter, for a New-yeeres gift, but altered by griefe for your Brothers broken arme. Farewell my

good sweet Nanne. God blesse thee with the continuance of the comfort of his holy Spirit, that it may euer worke in you, and perseuere with you to the ende, and in the ende.
