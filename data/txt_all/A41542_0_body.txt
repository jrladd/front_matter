I Knew none to whom I could better di∣rect
this Discourse on the Mournful
Occasion of your Worthy Father's
Death, then you his Son. Do not fix your
Mind too deeply on your Loss of him to ag∣gravate
your Sorrow, but turn your Thoughts
to a Review of the Example of his Life
which he hath left you, and which deserves
to be imitated. Be Good and Generous,
ready to do kind Offices to all, and be true
to Friendship as he was. Seek the God of
your Father to be your God in Covenant,
and devote your self with all Sincerity un∣to
him. Love Jesus Christ, and his pure
Gospel, espouse his despis'd Interest, and dare
to vindicate his Truths so much invaded on
every side, tho' to do so may be contrary to
your Interest in this World. Value Humane

Learning in subserviency to Divine and
more sublime Knowledge, industriously pur∣sue
it by close, and unwearied Studies, and
after all dedicate it to Christ's Service, and
zealously employ it for the Defence of his
Truth, as your Father did. But never let
Learning through any Vanity of Mind make
you to disgust the Plainness, and Simplicity
of the Gospel. That a double portion of the
Spirit may rest upon you. That you may
stand up in your Father's room. That your
Mature Years may produce that Fruit which
your Blooming Youth promiseth; and that
the God of all Grace would establish, streng∣then
and settle you, and make you useful,
and serviceable in the Churches of Christ, is
the Hearty Prayer of
