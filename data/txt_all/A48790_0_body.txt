May it please your Honour,
IN this Collection (which is humbly ad∣dressed
to your Lordship, as one of the
most eminent surviving Instances of
that Loyalty it treats of) is contained
Remarques and Observations upon a∣bove
a thousand Persons, in which
number may be accounted no less than
two hundred Peers and Prelates, be∣coming
the Excellency of that Royal Cause, most Sacred
in the two Branches thereof, Government and Religion.
As the Slave in the Historian, gathered up the scattered
Limbs of his Great, but Conquered and Murthered
Lords, burning them on some vulgar pile, and repositing
their Ashes in some poor room, till more equal times
should erect them a becoming Monument; Covering them
with a Pyramid, or inclosing them in a Temple: So I, from
the perishing and scattered Pamphlets and Discourses of

these times, have Collected some choice Memorials of
those Heroes, who deserved not to be forgotten in that
Kingdom, whereof I am a Subject, and that Church,
whereof I am a Member; which Collection may serve for
a just, though brief account, of the great actions and suf∣ferings
of these Worthies, till time shall produce a better
History, more lasting than its self, that shall be a reproach
to the weakness of Stone and Marble.
History, (saith my Lord Bacon) which may be called
just and perfect History, is of three kinds, according to
the object it propoundeth, or pretendeth to represent; for
it either representeth a time, a person, or an action. The
first we call Chronicles, the second Lives, and the third
Narrations, or Relations.
Of these, although the first be the most compleat and
absolute kind of History, and hath most estimation and
glory; yet the second excelleth it in profit and use, and
the third in verity and sincerity. For History of Times
representeth the magnitude of Actions, and the publick
faces and deportments of Persons, and passeth over in si∣lence
the smaller passages and motions of men and matters.
But such being the Workmanship of God, as he doth hang
the greater weights upon the smallest wyars, Maxima e¦minimis
suspendens, It comes therefore to pass, that such
Histories do rather set forth the pomp of business, than the
true and inward resorts thereof. But Lives, if well writ∣ten,
propounding to themselves a Person to represent, in
in whom actions, both greater and smaller, publick and
private, have a commixture, must of necessity contain a
more true, native, and lively representation.
I do much admire, that the vertues of our late times
should be so little esteemed, as that the writing of Lives
should be no more frequent; for although there be not
many Soveraign Princes, or absolute Commanders, and
that States are most Collected into Monarchies; yet there
are many worthy Personages, that deserve better than di∣spersed
Reports, and barren Elogies.
There are Pyramids erected for the Maccabees (those
great sufferers for a good Cause) at Modinum in Palestine,

the bottom of which contain the bodies of those Heroes,
and the tops serve for Sea-marks, to direct Marriners,
sayling in the Mediterranean, towards the Haven of Ioppa,
in the Holy-Land; not unlike whereunto, for the use and
service thereof, is this following Volume, partly to do
justice to those Worthies deceased, and partly to guide
and Conduct their Posterity to the same happiness, by
steering their course according to the honourable patterns
of their Lives, and the resolved manner of their Deaths;
being moreover useful intimations to oppressed vertue,
when neither Law nor Government can neither encourage
or support, and successful and prosperous Vices, which
neither is able either to suppress or restrain; yet is History
able to do Right to the one, and Justice on the other;
History that holds a Pen in one hand, that can set the most
neglected and despicable goodness eternally beyond in∣jury,
and (being the greatest awe over great Villains on
this side Hell) a scourge in the other, that shall give the
most powerful and domineering Villany perpetual wounds
beyond a remedy; a fair warning to all men, that have a∣ny
sense of fame or honour, to take as great care of their
deportment before their death, as the Roman Gladiators
did of their postures before their fall.
Neither am I without competent hopes, that it will
be a cosiderable pleasure to those worthy Persons still
surviving their former sufferings, to see the Kings friends
in a body in an History, as once they saw them in the
Field; and be able upon the view, to make a judgement
what Families and Persons are fit to be employed and en∣trusted,
what deserving men have been neglected, and
who may be encouraged and rewarded; without doubt
many will, with great satisfaction, look on this Catalogue
as K. Charles I. did on Essex his Army at Edge-hill, when
he gave his reason for his long looking upon them, to one
that asked him, What he meant to do; This is the first
time that I saw them in a body.
And the rather, because, though not mentioned them∣selves,
as being alive, (Nec tanti est ut memorentur perire,
Nor is it worth their while to dye, that they may be re∣membred)

yet by this poor attempt may guess, that
when other means prove ineffectual, (Monuments of
Wood being subject to burning, of Glass to breaking, of
soft Stone to mouldring, of Marble and Mettal to demo∣lishing)
their own Vertues, and others Writings, will
Eternize them.
If any Persons are omitted (as possibly, in so great a
variety, there may be some) or mistaken, or but briefly
mentioned, be it considered, that the Press, like Time
and Tide, staying for no man, and real Informations
(though diligently and importunately sought after) com∣ming
in but slowly, we were forced to lay this Foundati∣on,
and intend, God willing, if an opportunity shall
serve, to compleat, or at least more amply adorn the
Structure.
One of the greatest Encouragements whereunto, will
be your Lordships gracious acceptance of this weak, but
sincere Endeavour of,
My Lord,
