MY LORD,
IT is hoped, Your Excellency may par∣don
this boldnesse, upon the conside∣ration,
That this poore mite offered
in zeale, may longer beare Your super∣scription,
then choicer pieces cast into
the Treasury of Your desert, by greater
and more popular pens: However
his Election cannot be blamed, that
seekes shelter under that Tree of Honour,
which, during the stormes of so many contrary Factions,
hath not onely shadowed all formerly owned by Antiquity,
but may chill the hands of Posterity with despair, of ever being
able to match Your Actions hereafter. For those most ce∣lebrated
for their Valour and Conduct, did but gleane repute a∣mongst
the thornes of contrary and doubtfull Successes; Whereas
You, being the true Master of the Harvest of Honour, never were
knowne to returne without bringing Your sheaves with You;
Which may be the lesse wondred at by those who observe
how just an Accomptant You are to Your alone Captain, the Lord
of Hosts, in summing Your Bils of Victory to his glory, not Your own;
Who hath now not onely suffered You to build, but to shut the
Gates of the Temple of Warre; And will no doubt inspire
you with a patterne for that of Peace; so that as you have be∣gun
with Joshua, you may end with Solomon: Jethro hath long

since layed the platform how to make a people happy. And it were
presumption to offer to prescribe farther unto Master-Buil∣ders;
Yet in particular for Oxford, of which Providence hath
made you Chancellour, may it be spoken without offence, That
the Ʋniversity, however represented, retaines no surfeit of
Obstinacy or Riches; Your Reformation being as sutable to her
desires, as Your Protection: if Your wisedome apprehend a su∣perfluity
in one place, the next glance may possibly discover hun∣dreds
that want it: Her misfortune is, to be look'd upon as
having laboured so long of a Malignant Feaver, that she is
run past recovery in the bookes of prejudice, having nothing
to redeeme her from ruine, but Your pity and power; if You
would be pleased to take Her into Your more peculiar Pro∣tection▪
and not suffer Her any longer to lye committed unto
other Hands then Your Owne, and such as under You, and nearer
Her, shall be thought fit to put Her into. Which she hath
the greater hopes to obtaine, because more then ten times the
number of good men assigned by God for the stoppe of the
severest sentence ever pronounced against a City, Listed them∣selves
in one day under the Noble Governour that then was,
without looking backe upon any thing of their own Interest,
esteemed vile in comparison of the Publique Safety, and
Your Honour.
There needs no more interruption be given to Your weigh∣tier
affaires, then to acquaint You, that the Author absents
his Name out of no other feare, then to keepe himselfe in a
condition to doe You farther service. For though Kings fall
before You, their Instruments may rise up against others that
endeavour to give evidence to an opposite Government; especially
having no Legions to defend him but Your Name, and the
assurance he hath to be owned, as truly he is
Jan. 1. 1651/2.(My Lord)
Your Excellencyes most humble and
obedient Servant.
