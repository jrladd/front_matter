HAVING (Right Wor∣shipfull) the industrious labours of a willing pra∣ctioner, in the discourses of Morall Philosophy, (the same comming by chaunce into my hands to be imprinted) which said matters beare the Title of The Court of good Counsell, wherein the duty of all sorts of people is most Lyuely set foorth: Which for th'ex∣celencie of the discourse, deserues a Patron of a Iudiciall censure. And now your Wor∣ship beeing one whom my secret thoughts deepely affect, I haue boldly dedicated the same vnto you, wishing the same as worthy of your VVorships acceptance, as my de∣sire most humbly requireth. Thus leauing your VVorship to the Tuition of the Al∣mighty, whom I pray to blesse in this world with much prosperity, And in the life to come with blessed Eternitie.
