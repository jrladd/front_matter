(BY THE GRACE OF GOD)
KING OF GREAT BRITAINE, FRANCE, & IRELAND: TR VE DEFENDER OF THE TR VE, ANTIENT, CHRISTIAN, CATHOLIKE, AND APOSTOLIKE FAITH &c.



From ZEAL-Land, sayling▪ with the Winde of Loue,
In the Bark LABOVR, stirr'd by Theorems,
Laden with ope and with DESIRE t'approve,
Bound for Cape-Comfort in the Ile of IHMMES;
In such a Mist, wee fell vpon the Coast,
That sodainly vpon the Rock Neglect
(Vnhappily) our Ship and Goods we lost,
Even in a Place that we did least suspect.
So, Cast▪ away (my LIEGE) and quight vn-don,
We Orphan-remnants of a wofefull Wrack,
Heer cast a-shore to Thee for succour run:
O Pittie vs, for our deer Parent's sake,
Who Honour'd Thee, both in his Life and Death,
And to thy guard his POSTHVMES did bequeath.



These glorious WORKS, and gratefull Monuments
Built by Du BARTAS, on the yrenaeis
(Your Royall Vertues to immortalize,
And magnifie your rich Munificence)
Haue prov'd so Charge-full to Trans-port from thence
That our smal Art's-stck hardly could suffize,
To vnder go so great an Enterprize;
But is even beggerd with th' vn-cast Expense.
So that, except our Muses SOVERAIN
With gracious Eye regard her spent Estate;
And, with a hand of Princely Fauour, daign
To stay her fall (before it be too-late)
She needs must fail: as (lending Light about)
Self-spending Lamps, for lack of Oyl, go-out.
