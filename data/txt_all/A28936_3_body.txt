May it please your Grace,
THE Great and No∣ble Character which you have already obtain∣ed
in the World, hath justly obliged them both to applaud and admire You; and no Wonder then, that it should raise in me an Ambition to lay this at Your Feet; where whilst I lye secure from the Censure of the World under your Grace's Pa∣tronage, I have this great Advantage, that in what∣ever I can say, in relation to your Illustrious Cha∣racter, I cannot be Guil∣ty of Flattery; since the World universally agrees, that Your Noble Quali∣fications are not unworthy
so Noble a Prince; Your Sagacity and Judgment not being less conspicu∣ous in State Affairs, than your Virtue and Piety in Divine things; the For∣mer having rendred You both acceptable and ser∣viceable in Council, as the Latter have made You an Eminent and Illustri∣ous Example of Christia∣nity; so that You be∣come serviceable to your Country upon a double score; Your Virtues in∣cite your Admirers to pur∣sue and emulate Good A∣ctions, and your Wisdom
and Prudence contribute to the well Governing of a People, who are the more disposed to be Loyal and Good Subjects, the more by Example you promote Religion, which teaches them to obey: Upon which Account we may truly say, that You act not the Politician, but, what is much more diffi∣cult, like a Wise and Pru∣dent States-Man; You gain the People not by Stratagem, but Exam∣ple.
But on this Ocasion I can make use of no great∣er
Encomiums than what his Majesty hath been plea∣sed to Honour You with, in the Preamble to the Pa∣tent which creates you Duke, where He declares, in better Words than I am now Master of, that, as there was no Family in En∣gland more conspicuous in Virtue and Piety, so he thought himself obliged to give Testimony of it, by conferring that Ho∣nour on You, which You long before deserved.
But not to enlarge too much on a Subject which the World is so well ac∣quainted
with, I shall need to say no more, than that in Your Illustrious Person we may see all the just Qualifications of an English Nobleman concentered; since your Honour is sup∣ported not only by Titles, but Actions; so that Your Character is pure and un∣spotted, in a World ready to take the least occasion of Calumny and Aspersi∣on.
Let me therefore rather admire than endeavour to delineate so Noble and so Great a Character; which be it never so well copyed,
must come far short of its truly Illustrious Origi∣nal.
I shall therefore only add, that all Your Admi∣rers wish that You may long continue an Orna∣ment of the English Nati∣on, and a Standard of Ho∣nour and true Nobility; which are more particu∣larly the Wishes of,
