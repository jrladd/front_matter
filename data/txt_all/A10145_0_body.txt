BY knowledge true I did preferre,
vnto your highnesse proiects three
Of mickle worth, exceeding farre
the subtill sleight of Enmitie.
Shee seekes my truth for to suppresse,
And I to Wisdome for redresse.


Where reason is by knowledge found,
your highnesse pleasure to fulfill:
Extending many a thousand pound,
in secret knowne to Arte and skill,
Should single wits thereiudge or deeme
where knowledge wants or hath not beene.


I am not of that learned lore,
of Riplie, Kellie, and other moe;
Whose learned worke are gone before,
figuratiuely, Imeane not so,
But plainely in a homely stile,
shewing the truth deuoide of guile.


In plow-mans painefull toile,
my skill is something good:
And in the arte deuoide of guile,
my minde not wauering stood.
Loe yet my heart could not discearne,
by glosing wordes that skill to learne.







By duety I doe bow and yeelde,
by rigors rage I nothing see:
By guilefull guiftes that hath been sild,
brought to the baites of flatterie:
My sight not dim, though blinde I am,
and liues on earth a simple man.


I am not knowne, nor will not be,
but as the Bird who seeth the net:
I fall into each ieopardie,
and none but God the same can let,
Therefore good King know most iust,
in God aboue I put my trust.


For if with golde I had beene fedde,
my sellfe had had a passing parte:
And eke my sences had been led,
from learning of that noble arte
Of knowledge, which so many knowe,
vnto the end it proues not so,


For knowledge is a sccret thing,
and knowledge is a vertue great:
And knowledge doth make wisdome spring
and knowledge tis wherof we treate.
The loue and life of euerie thing,
with due obedience to our King.


Blisse-full thy hap, thy life, and eke the daies,
as Dauid did to God, giue thou thy praise,
Who was, who is, euerlasting seeing,
Rules Princes dead, and those now aliue being.
