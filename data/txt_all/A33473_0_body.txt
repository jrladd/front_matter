SIr, though to me unknown your person be,
Your better parts my soul doth plainly see,
In your fulfill'd predictions, and in those
Which shall fulfilled be, how soon none knows,
But he who them inspir'd: Yet I dare say,
I'm sure they shall; and hope to see the day
Of their fulfilling: when our Rulers here
Shall hearken to a slighted Engineer:
And shall have ears to hear, and eyes to see
The wayes of truth, of peace, and unity,
And walk therein. Mean while, dear Sir peruse
This Widows Mite of an old Maiden-Muse:
Wherein, what you approve, let stand: what not,
Razeout: If all be faulty, all out blot,

And blot my folly too: let silence shie
Make its remembrance in your censure die.
I much desir'd to be a Witness true
Unto these Nations (long since warn'd by you)
Of God's proceedings with them: and that he
Call'd you of old, their Watchman here to be;
And that you faithfully discover'd to them,
Time after time their ways, that would undo them,
And shew'd their way of peace: yet we march on,
On the wrong fork of your Greek Ypsilon:
The Lord sound our retreat: for he alone
Can guide right who so long astray have gone.
And here I testifie unto these Nations,
That (though they fall) you sought their preserâˆ£vations;
And that their fall is wilful; but however,
You have a sure reward laid up for ever:
And this, I hope, will some small comfort be
To your oppressed Muse, when she shall see
An English man attest that she's divine,
And sun-like, shall in Britain henceforth shine,
When future Generations unseal'd eyes
Shall see accomplish'd your past prophecies;
Which if our souls with patience can attend,
Gods glory and our good shall be the end.
