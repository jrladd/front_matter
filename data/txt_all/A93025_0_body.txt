Honoured Sir,
WHen I consi∣dered the Greatness of your Merit, and the suitable Character the

World gives you, I was in doubt with my self whether I should adventure to dedicate this small Piece to you, had not I been well as∣sured of its real worth.
Your liberal and in∣genuous Education, re∣fined by your being bred up to Arms, and your Employment at Court, the two chief Schools of Experience (Advantages which by

your Industry you have to the utmost im∣proved) makes you the only Person I could at present think of as a fit Judge of it; and the only Person (having born a Publick Cha∣racter abroad) that I could believe could imitate or out-do our Author.
You, as well as our Sacredo, have laid Foun∣dations adapted to a

future Greatness, and the excellent Qualifica∣tions and Perfections you are Master of, have made you sufficiently known to be an expert Souldier, and a com∣pleat Courtier, highly esteemed and beloved by all; so that when His Majesty shall think fit to raise you to a higher Station, you will sit easie: For you will have this Happiness ad∣ded

to the other you enjoy, to be Great, and not Envied.
The Freedom you have allowed me, made me give you some small Account of my future Studies, and here you have the first Essay of it: And as you are pleased to afford a Diversion to the pre∣sent Course of them, by an extraordinary Favour and Kindness

to me, I shall endea∣vour to make up the Loss of Time by my future Diligence. Yet can any one be said to lose his Time, who is in the happy Oc∣casion of an Example of so great Vertue, whose Care and Industry is so early, that it seems to out-strip the quickness of his Master's Bounty?
All my aim in this my Dedication to you,

is only as I have recei∣ved great already, and am still in the opportu∣nity of receiving greater Obligations from you; so I am in Gratitude and Duty bound publickly to own, and upon all occasions shew my self,
January 24, 1684/5
Honoured Sir,
