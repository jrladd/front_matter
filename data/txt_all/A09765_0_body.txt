COnsidering with my selfe the in∣comparable be∣nefyte of good spirits (most so∣uerain prelate) thorowe whose most worthy diligēce & meanes a moste aboundaunt and plen∣tifull fruite, is owen thorowe the vniuersal worlde, not one∣ly by the meanes of the Greeke and latine Rethoricke, but also by ye celelebration of our french tongue, the which dayly more

and more most aboundantlye flourisheth. I could not by any meanes restrayne the heate of of my good wil, but that in this present worke, being (a traduc∣tion of Plinie) thy most Illustri∣ous name shoulde be spoken of, to the ende that with more di∣ligence it might be brought to light, and presented before the eyes of those cleare beholders, that in good erudition & lear∣ning, haue most sound and per∣fecte knowledge: among the which foreseeing, that thy na∣ture is inclined to support and maintain those that are the lo∣uers of Muses, I haue therfore boldened my selfe to dedicate or direct vnto thee this newe traduction, it is a little labour of my father, which after his deceasse, among other of hys

workes is fallē into my hands. It is a summe of the secretes of Plinie, abstracted out of the six∣tene first bokes of his naturall historie, so that the matter is so requisite and necessary to man, that I thinke the publishing thereof to be very delectable to the Readers. And bicause I would not defraud the author of this same so profitable a tra∣duction, I am constrayned to cause it to be opened, & vnder the title of a most mightie and soueraigne prelat to put it for∣warde. For I thought it not good to preferre any one to thy magnificence, which hath such an ardente zeale, towardes those that battayle or warre vnder the standarde of Pallas. Receyue therefore (my good Lorde,) this my fathers worke,

and accepting it in good parte, excuse thys mine enterpryse, es∣teeming that of a good will and due obedience, this presente worke most worthy vnto thy noble priest∣hod is de∣rected.
