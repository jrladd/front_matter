THe severall and strange Works of Divine Pro∣vidence, which (in our days) appear thorow∣out the Christian world, are a Theam worthy of the best Historians pen, and of the best Christians meditation: Although former Ages have not wanted variety of Experi∣ences; (which their Ecclesiasticall Writers have gathered up and preserved for us) yet the singular Occurrences of this present Age afford Occasions of choiser Observation and ri∣cher Discourse: For, besides the various Turns in Germa∣nie, and the many Floats in Scotland, and the Artificiall De∣solation in Ireland, there hath also burst out such an Inte∣stine Calamity within our own England, the like whereof our Ancestours never knew; although they had (sometimes) a large share in Broyls and Troubles. In all which heavie Ac∣cidents now begirting us, all sorts of men have let slip so much of men, and God hath laid out so much of God, as that a judicious and faithfull Collection of the Attempts by the one, and of Events from the other, would compile a Book (next to that of All Books) fullest of worth and use. And whether such an History of Providence (clasping at least the wonders of this time) would not be a fit Monument of Thanksgiving for your many and strangely-received mer∣cies, I humbly submit (Right Honourable) to your Wisedom.

Of this I am confident, that such a Work (well done) would be as the golden Pot which preserved Manna, and (if I mistake not) The Picture of Policie, The Depths of Popery, The Sum of Men, The Account of Projects, The Map of Miseries, The Cries of a Church, The Pities of a God, and The Magna Charta of Miracles.
Now that Divine Providence which is an Eye to see All things, and a Wheel to turn All things, and a Hand to rule All things, for ever guide, and preserve, and prosper you and all who prize Jesus Christ and his Kingdom above All other things. So prays
