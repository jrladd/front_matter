SIR; although I neither haue, nor ought to haue any other prime inten∣tion in the Publishing of these two Sermons, then I had in the Preaching of them, and then euery Minister that fore-casteth to make his last account with comfort ought to haue in the whole course and exer∣cise

of his Ministerie, viz. the building vp of the people of God in Faith and Godlinesse: yet I can∣not but desire withall, that as they passeth abroad in the world, they may stand vp euery where as a publique testimonie of my priuate obligations to you. Whereof (omitting those dai∣ly kinde offices of Friendship and Neighbourhood, which you are euer ready to doe me and mine vpon all occasions; as also your zeale vnto Iustice and the Common-good, aboundantly manifested in mana∣ging the affaires of your Countrey with singular skill, Industry, and Faithfulnes:) I neede produce no other argument then this; that li∣uing so long vnder my Charge, as I doe also vnder your Patronage, you neuer yet gaue me the least cause to

thinke my selfe, either despised in the Worke, or defrauded in the Wages, of my Ministery. Which, as it is a gracious euidence of a pious and sincere heart in you; so it is a Circumstance, wherein I am happie beyond the condition of most of my Brethren in the same Cal∣ling. God make me truly Thankfull to him for his good Prouidence ouer me therein, and for all other his Mercies towards me: and both continue and increase your Com∣forts amid all the Afflictions of this present euill World; and in the end make you partaker of the Ioyes of the world to come:

Boothby-Paynell, Linc: 1. Iuly. 1628.
