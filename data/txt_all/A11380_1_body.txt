SIr, I have observed you active in your conversa∣tion abroad and at home, and I could not study any thing I thought more sutable, and congruous, than these pra∣cticall leases, which may at once recreate and instruct your retirement, instruct you not as mine but Gods, for his words are my ground and foundation both for place and sense, and in this course I fore∣saw

saw most security, for heere I have his Word for what I say, and I give you his Word for what you are to doe, and my lines are but onely drawne here to point you to the center of the Scriptures: there your de∣signes, your projects, may rest and relie.
Sir, I know you have a breast-plate rich enough of your owne, yet to set an higher rate upon your counsels, bee pleased to let these holy jewels of Gods Word (which will bee a bright Urim and Thum∣mim to your bosom) have a place, and that I may be just to the brevity I professe in my Booke, I hasten to bee as I am ever bound, Sir,
