THat a peculiar Deference is payed to Your Noble and Honoured Persons and Families, at the En∣trance to the following Essayes, is but what both Justice and the Authors De∣sign, do necessary oblige unto; For, as Divine Providence hath made you to move in Orbs above others, So it can∣not be denyed, but that, in proposing
 things of great Moment and Universal Concern, a Special Notice is due to you, and that not oly, in reguard of your Quality and Eminent Stations, but in re∣guard also of that great Judgement and Penetration, that Ingenuous Candour and Freedom of thinking, that very Obser∣vably are Entail'd upon you, and are more Generally discoverable among you, than among those of a meaner Birth and Education, whose Judgements are commonly so Prepossessed with false Byasses, their Minds so Narrow and Hampered, and so Confin'd to these O∣pinions, which either Custom or a Blind Implicit depending on the Authority of their Teachers, have Conveyed to them as Truths, that they become almost un∣accessible to any thing that might Re∣dress their mistakes, or beget Juster thoughts in them. Nothing can be more obstinatly Pertinacious, and more Uncapable of being Reclaim'd from Er∣rour, than the Vular, when they have Surrendred their Understandings to the
 Conduct of a sort of very Confident Spiritual Guides, who pretend that they are Entrusted with all the Secrets of Heaven, and Warranted by Divine Commission to deliver them, to the Ex∣clusion of all others that are not of their way from so great a Priviledge; and who, tho' they strangely declaim against Pretences to Infallibility, yet will have whatever themselves affirm, to pass for Oracles, and to be received by their Proselyts, without Doubting or Dispute, One may easily see with what Assure∣ance the Credulous and Undiscerning Votaries will Drink in, and how Stifly they will adhere to and mantain the Dictates of their Teachers, whom they hear so often, and so Solemnly bespeak∣ing Attention and reguard to their say∣ings as being the Words, not of Men, but of GOD, that is, as this sort of Language imports, the Words of Per∣sons immediatly Inspired and directed by GOD, and Commssion'd to declare His Will, Tho' in effect they may be no∣thing
 else but the Products of a De∣luded fancy or blind Prejudices, The Dictates of Passion and interest, and a Factious Zeal; of the Truth of which all Ages have affoorded too many sad instances. Not but that it is readily acknowledged that there may be in eve∣ry Age, Souls, Immediatly Illuminated, by GOD, but then it cannot be denyed that they of this Character are infinite∣ly Rare; And the reason is, because there are but very few who Practise the Self-denyal, that introduces into that State of Purity which Qualifies for Di∣vine Illumination. It were indeed Ex∣treamly to be wished, that the Real Pos∣session of so great a Blessing, were as Uni∣versal as the Pretences to it are. How∣ever, it is certain that One's giving out himself as thus highly favoured by Hea∣ven, is a proper Artifice to catch the Multitude, and to secure their Subje∣ction; For when they once fancy them∣selves to be under the Conduct of In∣spired Teachers, They will hardly ever
 listen to any thing that would discover unto them the falsehood or uselessness of the Doctrines which they have Im∣bib'd, tho the greatest evidences imagi∣nable were adduced for their Convict∣ion. And if it happily falls out, That any of a Lower Rank are Candid and Pe∣netrating, Impartial, and Disengadged, Modest, and Docil, as they do thereby rise above the common Level, and ap∣proach those of a higher Sphere; So on the other hand, when one of a Noble and Gentile Original is found destitute of the mentioned Qualities he doth in so far Sink and decline towards the Dregs of the People; nothing being more Ig∣noble than a Mean and Indocil Spirit, a mind that is very Weak, and yet very Peremptory and Decissive in its Judge∣ments, that is so Limited and tyed up to a set off thoughts and Opinions that it becomes Uncapable of being better informed, and making free and Ingenu∣ous Inquities, and that imagines these Conceptions of things, which it hath
 already intertained, to be so very Just and full, that they need no Emendati∣ons, nor can admit of being improven by Additional discoveries.
It is true indeed, One ought very carefully to Guard against a Wanton Le∣vity and being tossed too and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, And more especially this Caution ought to b used with reguard to the Radical Principles of the Christian Religion These great Points on which it turns, and without whih it cannot subsist, but then a Pe ish and Obstinat Pertinacie, in cleaving to our former Apprehensi∣ons, and which dispses us inconsidetat¦ly and Promiscuously to reject whatever Contradicts them, is equally to be E∣vited and exposed: Since, as it bewrays ou having become Wretchedly insen∣sible of the weakness and darkness and Fallibility of our minds. So also, on Supposition that we are mistaken, it inevitably obstructs our being diabus'd and pecludes all Entrance to Juster
 Thoughts. No doubt, one great Or∣stacle that kept the Jews and Heathen Philosophers from acknowledging the Messias, and from Embraceing his ex∣cellent Doctrines, was their Stiff adhe∣rence to their former Apprehensions and prejudices, and Arrogantly presuming of the Truth of them. But this Obsti∣nacie is never more intolerable, and accompanied with more fatal Conse∣quences, than when it is found in those, who, not contenting themselves with Pure and Simple Christianity, have mul∣tiplied Articles of Faith to such Vast Numbers, that whole Volumes cannot contain them, and who, Tho in the Judgements of all thinking and impar∣tial Persons, these Additional Articles are for the most part either very False, or Uncertain, or useless Speculations, yet obtrude them on the VVorld with such eagerness and Zeal, as if they were the very Marrow and Substance of our Holy Religion, and Persecute with a Fierce and Bloody Violence, and load
 with ill names, such as are of other thoughts in these lesser Matters; because they will not pay the same Regard to these impositions and inventions of Men, that they do to the most indisput∣able Maximes of the Gospel. This this hath been, and still is one great Source of these Lamentable Schisms and Animosities, these Divisions and Subdivisions that disturb and distract the Christian World, that sullie the Beauty of our Religion, and render both it and us a Scorn to our Neighbours, and a reproach to all that are round about us. 'Tis this that hath stiffled Charity, bro∣ken Unity and Concord brought forth a Spirit of Malice and Faction, of Blood and Persecution, and banished not only from the Hearts, but from the Memories of Men that Benignity and mutual Forbear∣ance, which the Gospel so frequently and so passionatly urges and Recom∣mends. They are the Superadded Ar∣ticles that the different Parties contend with, and persecute one another for,
 Now to be sure these cannot All be Es∣sential Points, that is, Truths on the Belief whereof Eternal Life depends, since at this Reckoning, the whole Christian World must be damned, for the several Parties of which it consists do reciprocally disbelieve, and even condemn for Errors and Heresies one another's distinguishing Articles. But in effect, so far are they from being of this Moment, that, very often, they are not only downright Triffles and Logomachies, but in many instances ne∣cessarly false; For since the particular Doctrines which distinguish Sects, are not only different from, but also contra∣dictory to one another, It is impossible that Truth should be on all sides. Some must be infallibly mistaken; And seing the Matter stands thus, why should not we let our Moderation be known to all Men? Why should we not rather sus∣pect our selves, than rashly censure and judge others? Are not all of us lyable to Mistakes? Dare any lay claim to
 Infallibility? Ought we not then to think soberly of our own Sentiments, and construe charitably of the Opinions of such as differ from us? Would it not be infinitly more our Advantage, to be pushing one another to the Belief and Practice of the great and indispensable things of our Religion, than to be eter∣nally wrangling about doubtful, uncer∣tain, or unprofitable Speculations? Shall we forever exhaust the Vigour and Mar∣row of our Spirits in Controversies and Debates, in things at a Vast distance from the Vitals of Piety, and in the mean time faintly pursue, and continue Strangers to Self-denyal, to the Morti∣fication of our Lusts and Passions, to the Imitation of Our Saviour, to Con∣tempt of the World, to the Love of GOD and Man, to a Life of Faith, to the Operations and Influences of Divine Grace, in purifying and Regenerating our Souls? Ought these great Things to be put in the Ballance with the su∣peradded Articles? Which shall be most
 regarded and enquired into at the Great Day? Our Speculations or our Practi∣ces? Our Opinions, or the inward Dis∣position of our Minds? Our Arguments or our Graces? Who are they whom the Son of GOD shall more especially Notice in destributing his Rewards? They who have imitated his Life, or they who have defended some Opinions which they have called his Cause? They who have lived Holily, or they who have disputed Subtily? They who have Re∣futed Errors, or they who have Purified their hearts? They who have profited most in the Contentious Divinity, or they who have advanced most in Self∣denyal? They who have contended Zealously against an opposite Party, or they who have Wrestled vigorously a∣gainst their corrupt Natures? They who have extirpated some disorders of the Church, or they who have Rooted out the Vices and Impurities of their Souls? O that some Brave and Generous Souls,
 such as we justly conceive you, Most Noble and Honoured Patriots, to be, would begin to baffle and disgrace these barbarous and uncharitable Dispositions and Practices, which so dishonour our holy Religion, which divert Men from minding the more necessary things, and cheerish & propagate discords and Ani∣mosities, and the blackest Passions; And that they would exemplifie and Recom∣mend to all within their Reach and In∣fluence, that Impartiality and Disengag∣edness, that Charity and Forbearance, which would not only adorn our Com∣mon Christianity, and tend to re-unite our divided hearts and interests, but also shame and reprove the pertinacious Bigotry of Sectarian and divisive Spi∣rits, whose ignorance of the Nature and designs of Religion, makes them waste their Zeal and time and Thoughts in asserting and vindicating some small things, in which Religion is so little concerned, that it had lost nothing tho the World had never heard of them.

It is certainly the Character of a great Mind to preserve its Freedom; Not to suffer it self to be so enslaved to a Scheme of thoughts, as peremptorly to resolve never to change any of them, to be do∣cile, and in a Disposition to receive Truth as soon as ever it presents it self; And in fine, to guard against illusive Byasses, to take care that neither Custom, nor Education, nor Lusts, not Passions, nor Interest, nor the Favours or Frowns of Men, nor any Human Regards, do impose on it: For these are the things that rob us of the Freedom of our Minds, and determine us to espouse Opinions without having any solid Evidences of their Truth. They whose Minds are thus free, docile, and unbyassed, are capable to make ingenuous Enquiries after Truth, and such as shall be success∣ful too, providing always, that in a just Dissidence of their own Understand∣ings, of whose Weakness their Experi∣ence cannot but sufficiently convince them, they resign themselves to GOD,
 ardently desiring, and humbly depend∣ing on his Divine Conduct and Influen∣ces. Without doubt we ought to make use of our Reason and Understanding in order to discover Truth, but then, if we wholly trust to our own Faculties, with∣out acknowledging and addressing the Sovereign Fountain of Truth, o if our Minds be prejudicat and vicious we may search for it long enough, and yet never solidly possess it. Truth is the Portion of Pure and Humble Hearts, who seek it in Simplicity, and in a pious depen∣dance on the Adorable Source of it, firm∣ly resolving to obey its Dictates. When we only consult our Reason, and rely on its Industry and Endeavours, in a proud or reless disreguard of the Father of Lights, it is no wonder, that in stead of Truth, we inherit nothing but Vanity and Error. Reason indeed is an excellent Faculty, but if it is soli∣tary and unassisted, and without the I∣radition of a more certain and fixed Light then its own, especially now in
 its state of darkness and degeneracy, and when it is under the Influence of depra∣ved Inclinations and corrupt Byasses, its Products at best are but lean and superfi∣cial, and very often, not only defective, but also false, and even pernicious. Of this we have but too many deplorable Instances in the Opinions of not a few, which are so sensibly gross and false, that it is not possible for any disinteressed Person, tho' otherwise very Charitable, to put a favourable Gloss upon them; and the inauspicious Influence which they visibly have either on Religion in the general, or on the great designs of it, is a just prejudice against them. We have endeavoured to lay down such Principles as if carefully attended unto and incul∣cat, will sccure the Youth from being infected with these that are of the most dangerous Tendency. And as your great Judgements, Right Noble and Honour∣able, will soon discern their Solidity, so it Is justly hoped, your generous Candor, will easily pardon the defects that ac∣company
 the Management of them.
As to the Author's Design, The seri∣ous Perusal of the ollowing Essays will, he doubts not, abundantly convince, that he aims at nothing else, but to con∣tribute his poor Endeavours to the Re∣vival and Propagation of True Christian Piety, which, in the Confession of all that are Serious, labours under a very Visible Decay. He concluded that a Pious and Diligent Care to Educat the Youth, according to the Spirit and Max∣imes of the Christian Religion, would have a singular Tendency to advance this Design, especially considering that in Order to manage happily so impor∣tant an Affair, the Parents, and others, on whom the Care of it may be devolv∣ed, must themselves labour to be pract∣ically acquainted with Religion, since it is this that will both inspire them with Zeal and Diligence in prosecuting it, and give Force and Authority to what they Recommend; For the Youth, when once they are capable to make Remarks,
 will be but very little affected with these Exhortations and Instructions to which the Lives of those that give them are perpetual Contradictions. They will be naturally apt to imagine that the Rules, which are set before them for the Conduct of their Lives, cannot be of such Moment as is pretended, since they who prescribe them, pay no regard to them in their own Conversations. Wherefore the Matter is here so stated, as that the Directions are in the first place addressed to the Parents, that they may solidly digest and practise them, and then, having had Experience them∣selves of the Consolations and Advan∣tages of a Serious Piety, communicat the Rules of it to their Children with Life and Power.
It is doubtless a Great Blessing, when any Families, how mean so ever their Rank & Circumstances may be, become Nurseries of Piety; when the Heads are not only truly Religious and Devout themselves, but vigorously labour also
 to encourage and propagate a Serious Devotion and a solid Vertue in the Members. This may prove very bene∣ficial to those in their Neighbourhood; who may be induced to transcribe their Laudable Examples. But when this is the Charactet of Noble and Eminent Fa∣milies, the Advantages are singular, and the Blessings diffusive: For their Piety, by which they are Luminaries fixed in higher Orbs▪ shines on their Inferiours with an auspicious and winning Influ∣ence, which insensibly gains Ground on them. The Examples of Superiours have in them I know not what strange and Charming Force, that secretly draws and engages these unde their Dependance to imitate their Carriage and Practices. Wherefore, You can not but be Sensible, Right Noble and Honourable, how Sacred the Obligations are which ly on You to be Patterns of Piety in every Capacity you bear. The Advantages, you see, which attend your being such, are very signal; They
 are not confin'd to your own Persons and Families, but redound to others, who are gained to become Votaries to Religion by the Endearments of your Illustrious Examples. The great and E∣minent Priviledges and Blessings which accompany a serious Piety, with Re∣gard to your Selves, cannot but infinit∣ly recommend it to you; It will make your Faces to shine, and add Lustre to your other Qualities; It will adorn and perfect your Souls, and Grace your Conversations: All other Accomplish∣ments and Breeding, in Comparison o these which a Genuine and an unaffected Piety inspires, are but mean and Con∣temptible Vanities; For what more Noble and more Valuable Ornaments than to be Meek and Humble, to be Pure and Chaste, and Self-denyed, to be Modest and Gentle, Patient and Contented, Just and Charitable, Spiritual and Heavenly Minded, Compassionat and Merciful? 'Tis in these things that the Beauty and Per∣fection of the Inward Man consist. Fur∣ther,
 it will rescue you from Ignoble and base born Lusts, and make you Par∣takers of the Divine Nature. It will beget Serenity in your Mnds and Peace in your Consciences, affoord you Solid Pleasures, and entitle you to durable Riches. It will turn you away from the Love and Esteem of Earthly things, and raise up your Minds to the Contemplati∣on and Desire of more Noble and more excellent Objects, even Eternal and In∣visible Realities, whence you will look down with a Generous Disdain on the Pleasures of Flesh and Sense, and the Glories of this World, as things vastly unworthy of your Notice and Pursute. In a word, by it you become the Mem∣bers of JESUS CHRIST, and his Living Images, the Favorites of Heaven, and the Heirs of Glory, the Care of Angels and the Joy of Saints. In the Sacred Exercises of it, the Blessed GOD will often Visite you, and give you such sen∣sible and affecting Indications of his Pre∣sence, as that you can no more doubt
 of his being near you, than you can that the Sun shines, when you see its Light, and feel its heat. He will give you Discoveries of his Amiable Beauties, and endearing Tastes of his Goodness, and so∣lace you with his Love, and by the mighty Operations of his Spirit and Grace will so more and more refine and purifie, quicken and Corroborat, dilate and enlarge your Souls, as that they shall become still more and more capable of fuller and more ample Communicati∣ons out of his unexhausted Fulness: Here you shall be, as it were in the very Sub∣urbs of Heaven, where you shall mount up towards your Divine Original, in the Flames of a pure and vehement Love, and on the Wings of mighty Desires, where you shall be enteriain'd with the joyful Antepasts of Eternal Life, and unite with Seraphims and Cherubims, in their Hea∣venly Imploys of Love, Praise, and A∣doration; And where, in fine, you shall improve and grow in these Blessed Dis∣positions, which will qualifie you for
 entring on the possession of the Undefiled Inheritance, and for Relishing the Joyes of the other World. And thus your own Experience will effectually convince you that the Pleasures of a Religious and Devout Life are not imaginary and Phantastick, as the prophane World would give it out, but Solid and Real and well grounded, and such as infinit∣ly transcend these sordid and despicable Satisfactions, which the Votaries of De∣baucherie and Vice are so fond of, which are attended with Disquietments, and shall end in sorrow, leaving the forlorn Soul nothing to inherit, but its vitious and perverted Dispositions, the only things that can accompany it into the other World, where its ever craving, and yer never satisfied Lusts, being now disunited from the Objects that are suited to its corrupt Gust and Relish, and uncapable of Nobler and more Excellent Enjoyments, by Reason of its habitual Disaffectedness to them, will become a certain Source of ineffable Calamities.
 Moreover, Your Experience of the Life and Power of True Piety, and the Joys of Devotion, will give you more solid and permanent Assurances both of the Being of GOD, and of the Truth, and Excel∣lencie of the Christian Religion than all these that can be obtained by the Me∣thods of Speculation, and such too, as all the Wit and Sophistrie of Atheists shall never be able to shake or elude.
Now, as true Goodness is Communicative and tends to Reproduce it self, so when once you are practically acquainted with Religion, when its Sacred Principles are vitaly and habitually rooted in your hearts, and, as it were, interwoven, with your Natures, it will powerfully incline you to endeavour the Propoga∣tion of it every where, and more espe∣cially among your own Offspring these future hopes of your Noble and Honour∣able Families, to whom you cannot possibly give more Emient and more endearing Instances of your Love, than to consecrate them betimes unto GOD to
 disciple them unto their Redeemer, by acquainting them, as soon as may be, with the Maximes, and by initiating them into the Practices of the Christian Religion; to labour by your Pious In∣structions, by your servent Prayers, and Vertuous Examples, that they become New Creatures, and be made Partakers of the Divine Nature; For, by so doing you will be instrumental to entail upon them more Glorious Inheritances, and a Nobler Birth than what they derive from your selves, because to be born of GOD, and to be Joint Heirs with JESUS CHRIST▪ excells inconceivably all that the World calls great and magnificent. O how vast a Satisfaction will it affoord you to see your Children breathing no∣thing but Piety and Devotion; to see them burning in the Love of Jesus, ena∣moured of his Cross, transcribing His Example, desiring his Grace, and still aspiring after greater Measures of Con∣formity to Him in every thing, to see them despising the Maximes of the World,
 and trampling on the Momentany Va∣nities of this Life, and fixing on the Glories of the other World, as their Portion and Inheritance. Then it is that they shall be as Olive Plants round about your Tables, shedding furth the Savour of Gracious Dispositions and an agreeable Converation, and at last be∣come publick Blessings, the great Orna∣ments and Pillars of the Nation.
But as hath been Remarked, the happy Consequences of your Pietie are not limited to your own Families, but reach all that are round about you; For when others observe that you, who have the greatest Advantages of gratifie∣ing all the Inclinations and Appetites of Flesh and Blood, do notwithstanding embrace the Stricknesses of Religion, and prefer the pleasures of Devotion to the Satisfactions of Sense, they are power∣fully invited to try the Experiment and to write after your Copie. Your Con∣spicuous Pietie will not only lay Re∣straints upon, Shame, and dash Propha∣nity
 and Irreligion, but also secretly draw these that converse with you, to cast a favourable Eye on a Holy Life. But your Zeal and Charity will not let you rest in meerly Examplifieing a serious Pietie, they will moreover push you, when a seasonable Juncture offers, to speak honourably of it, and to assert it against the Attacks of Atheistical and Prophane Witts; to disparage a Vitious and Sensual Life, and represent it, as indeed it is a Reproach to Human Na∣ture, as well as a Dishonour to the Chri∣stian Religion.
Among the many other Excellent Dispositions, which a Vital Religion will beget in your hearts, it will inspire you with a mighty Love to, and render Concern for the Souls of Men; whence you will be prompted to contributc what possibly you can for the Promoval of their Eternal Salvation, and conse∣quently to imploy all your Interest that Christian Piety be encouraged and pro∣pagated every where, and among all
 Persons, and that none want the Means and Advantages of becoming Devout and Vertuous, as far as your Influence can reach. And there is one thing which your Pious and Charitable Inclinations will not allow to escape your Notice; Namely, the deplorable state wherein some poor People, and particularly the many idle Vagabonds, who go up and down, and make a Trade of Begging, are in as to their Spiritual Concerns. It is certain that generally these are a very profligat Crew, and live in a profound Disreguard of GOD and of their Souls; that they practise all sorts of Villanies themselves, and propagate their Vil∣lanous Practices to their Unfortunate Issue, and so, from Generation to Gene∣ration, they are not only a Reproach to the Nation, but the Plagues and Bur∣thens of it too. A Pretence to seek their Bread, engages them to wander to and fro, tho in effect the true Reason is, because they love not to work with their own hands, and to gain their Bread with
 the Sweat of their Brow, but choose an idle & libertine way of Living, & to be maintained at the Coast and on the La∣bour of others: And their wandring Circumstances put them out of the reach of all Order and Regular Subje∣ction, Seing they are not the fixed Mem∣bers of any Community or Congregation, whence it comes to pass that they lead lawless and prophane Lives, and carry as if they were in the same Rank with Brutes, being wretchedly unconcern'd as to their Immortal Souls, and aiming at nothing but to get the Supports of the Animal Life. O! how Signal an Instance of your Charity and Zeal would it be to take care that this great evil be re∣dressed, and that not only by laying down Methods and enacting Laws, when you meet together in the great Court of the Nation, whereby Competent provi∣sions might be allotted them, such of them as are able for it obliged to work and labour, and all of them put under Discipline and good Order, instructed
 in the knowledge of GOD and their Redeemer, and exhorted to look after their Souls; Their miserable Offspring, and other Orphans, and such whose indigent Parents are forced to abandon to shift for themselv∣es, tmeously educated in the Principles of Christian Religion, and, when ca∣pable of it, set to honest Trades and ways of living, according to their dif∣ferent Inclinations and Capacities; But also, after that these Laws are enacted, by effectually procuring that they be put in Vigorous Execution, without which however Excellent and well contriv'd the Laws may be, they will contribute as little to rectifie the Abuse, as pre∣scribing and making up good Modicines will contribute to remove a Distemper, when Care is not taken duly & seasonably to apply them. As your Great Wisdom will soon determine the Measures how to manage successfully this Charitable Concern, so your Zealous Piety will make the Work easie to you, and the
 Consequences will be very happy; For by these Means you will rid the Nati∣on of a great many unprofitable Burdens, and they who are now as sore places in it, will become useful Parts and Steddible Members of it. And moreo∣ver your Pious Endeavours to promove the Glory of GOD, the Interests of Re∣ligion, and the Good of Souls, will not only derive manifold Blessings on your own Persons and Families, but also entail Prosperity and Success on the Projects that are, or may hereafter be set on foot for the Benefite of the Nation. Almighty GOD will espouse your Inte∣rest, and secure them by the Interposal of a Special Providence, against the At∣tempts of your Encroaching Enemies. And however Melancholy and Discour∣aging the prospect of Affairs at present may be, yet He can soon give such a Favourable Turn to the Wheels, as will quite alter the Scene, and make your Fears quickly to evanish; Yea, thô Things should seem to be sunk, and in
 a desperat Case, yet let not even that utterly damp and dishearten you, but resume your Courage and your Hopes in a Trustful Dependance on GOD; For He can suggest unto you such Counsels, direct you unto such Measures, and provide for you such Assistances, as all the Crafts and Power of your Enemies shall not be able to defeat. Only let his Glory and Interests be very dear unto you, and while you are contriving how to advance the Temporal Advan∣tages of the Nation, be not forgerful to do all you can to promove  Spi∣ritual Concerns; Nay let the great and principal Motive which shall influence you to design and endeavour that the Nation prosper and flourish, be not so much the procuring its outward Splen∣dor and Glory, as that by its Flourish∣ing Circumstances, you may have great∣er Opportunities of doing Works of Cha∣rity, and of evidencing how cheerfully you will consecrat all you have, nor to the gratifying of Lust and Vanity, but
 to the Honour of your great Benefact∣or; And in fine, of leaving to Posterity, for their Imitation, lasting Monuments of your Piety and Virtue.
If what is Humbly Offered to you in the following Essays, Right Noble and Honourable, will affoord you any plea∣sure or profite, add to the Esteem which you have for Religion, give you any further Discoveries of its Beautie and Excellencie, and of the Necessity of be∣lieving and Practiseing according to what it delivers and Prescribes, or con∣tribute in the least to advance the design aim'd at, the Author will extreamly Rejoice. They are not, You will find the Interests and Opinions of a Party, not outward Forms and Circumstances, nor uncertain and doubtful Speculations, that are here urged and recommended. Alace! these are poor things; And it is sur∣prizing that the World hath not long since been convinced of the unaccount∣able Folie, of making such a Noicredge and Busle about them. They are the
 great and Essential Truths, and Duties of our holy Religion, its Inward Life and Power, those things that have Immedi∣at Influence on our Eternal Happiness, and without a Liveing Conformity of our Hearts and Lives, to which we do but in Vain assume to our selves the Name of Christians, or pretend to the Gloris of the other World. These are the things that are here treated off and inculcat, and as they cannot but be very acceptable unto you, So 'tis hop'd you will Generously Vouchafe to pro∣tect, Countenance, and Encourage the Prosecution of them, And that Almigh∣ty GOD may long prosper and preserve Your Illustrous and Honourable Persons and Families, Enrich You with His most Valuable Blessings, make You Eminent In∣stances of Piety. Continue You to be Pa∣trons to the Vertuous, and Terrors to Evil Doers, to be the Supports as well as the Ornaments of the Nation, the As∣sertors of its Rights, and the Instruments of its Prosperity; And finally receive
 you to inherit the Bliss and Joys of His Everlasting Kingdom, shall be the Author's daily and servent Prayer. In the mcan time he begs Pardon for his Rudeness, in detaining you so long at the Entry. The Number and Importance of the particulars which he was willing to set before you, have forced him into a Length, which otherwayes would have been an inexcusable Impertinency; And he hopes that the Sincere and Well-meant Expressions of his Zeal, for your greatest Concerns, will be taken in good part; And that it will not displease you, that he gives such instances of the great Regard he has for You, and of his in∣clinations to serve Your Interests, as his small Abilities could afford.
