Most Gracious Sovereign,
HAving spent many years in the study of your Majesty's Laws, and conceaving that several for whom I was concern'd as Councel had been much wrong'd a while since by Decrees in Chancery, and finding that they were past hopes of being Righ∣ted There, I advis'd Petitions to be pre∣ferred to Your Majesty, the Fountain of Justice, thereby beseeching Your Majesty to relieve Your Petitioners, either by re∣hearing the matter in Your Royal Person, or by referring it to such fit persons as Your Majesty should nominate: where∣upon it was declared by some near Your Majesty, That Your Majesty could not le∣gally grant your Petitioners Request; and that no Relief could be had against Chance∣ry-Decrees but by the House of Lords as∣sembled in Parliament; which thing I ap∣prehended
to be a great mistake, and tended (as I conceiv'd) to the Outing of Your Majesty of that Just and Necessary Jurisdiction, Preheminence, and Authori∣ty which is united and annexed to your Imperial Crown, and which to assist and defend to my Power I am bound by Oath: In discharge whereof I have made diligent search for what evidence could be found in the Authorities of Law to make out Your Majesties just Title to the premisses, and what I have found I have made a methodical Collection of, being, I hope, sufficient for the purpose; whereunto I have also added some instances of the great mischief it is to your Subjects, and may be to Your self, your Crown and Dignity, that Your Majesties Power in that matter is not put in practice. All which I humbly lay at Your Majesties Feet, begging Your Majesties acceptance and consideration thereof, as it is the product of the unseigned Fidelity and Al∣legiance of
Dread SIR,
