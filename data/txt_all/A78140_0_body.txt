My Lord,
THis short discourse being at first conceived, and formed by your Lps special command, and afterwards enlivened and quickened by your noble and gracious acceptance, is since grown bold to beg a further Boon of your Honour, which is, that under the Sanctuary of your Name and Patronage, it may walk a little abroad, and vi∣sit
 the Neighbour-hood. Indeed I can discover nothing in it, which I can warrantably and with confidence conceive worthy your Noble eyes, save onely the necessary justice and gratitude of my design therein, (viz.) to pay all dutifull respects and Honours to the precious Memory of the Best of Ladies, & to burn a little Incense before her Shrine. And though I am very sensible what great difficul∣ties I am to encounter with, (for the fame of her great worth has long since spread it self far & near, and the world does every where ring of her piety, and her example is solemnly propounded and quo∣ted by those who are desirous of the Best things, and would fain improve into Excellent; and peoples expectations do begin to swell and grow big here∣upon, and will not easily be put off with a sparing and slender report, where so much (in truth) may, and in justice ought to be spoken.) Yet am I not∣withstanding no whit discouraged at all this, but am resolved to go on howsoever, & to make up such an Offering as I am able, my two small mites, and a little Goats hair; having an Heart large and willing enough to offer with the freest, had I but where∣withall. And besides, I must not deny it, that I my self also am a man, subject to like incidencies of grief and sorrow, of passion and sadness in common
 with other people; neither indeed (as yet) have I throughly recovered the free command and use of my Parts, nor perfectly wrought my spirit out of those huge discomposures and indispositions, which the apprehension and remembrance of so signal a loss did at first cause in me; yea and to this very day the wound continues bleeding a fresh upon every uncovering of it: so that if either my expressions be disturbed, or language indigested, or stile not so even & methodical as is fit: it should rather move resentments of Pitie and Pardon in the Reader, then expressions of Censure and An∣ger: and especially there, where the mind (which should prevent, and rectifie all these transgressions) is it self so much out of Order. Howbeit, (my Lord) if you shall but please to smile Graciously upon this poor and little Oblation, which I here humbly cast at your Lordship's feet. I shall the less value the report and censure of the World; as having in some measure fulfilled and observed your Lp's commands, which were to preach a Sermon, (and that you know, is confined to Minutes and Houre-glasses,) and not to write a full and com∣plete history of all the virtuous Acts and Merits of this most excellent Lady. And yet neither have I been wholly wanting in this latter: for though
 I have not indeed spoken of Her, what either in justice I ought, or of my own knowledge and Ob∣servation I might in Truth have said, yet have I said so much, as will (I fear me) put the greatest part of the World to the blush, and (I hope too) provoke an holy Zeal and Emulation in all. And now (my Lord) give me leave to beseech you to reflect a little upon the great advantages of your Relation; You are Heir to a Blessed Martyr, and the Eldest Son of a most Excellent Mother; so that Honour and Nobility, and Worth and Piety are (in a manner) intailed upon you; and you do de∣rive them, and claim them (as it were) by inheri∣tance: and this must needs (doubtless) provoke very great Emulations, and continue most earnest desires and endeavours in you, to resemble and be as like these two Excellent Parents, of yours, as may be. And (blessed be GOD for it) you have in great measure attained to their perfections al∣ready; and those people, who (knowing you) do not take notice of your singular Temperance and Sobriety, your rare Humility and Condescen∣tion, your exceeding Courtesie and Affability, are either wilfully blind, or worse. And though I know your great Modestie doth not love to be told of your Virtues; but had rather do
 things Noble and Excellent, then hear talk of them: Yet herein do I humbly beg your pardon, if I tell the World of one, it was so eminent and remarkable in you, and gave such perfect content and satisfaction to your dear Mother; and That was your signal dutifulness and complyance with every request and command of Hers, in the time of Her sickness; and since that too, your most exact and punctual observation of Her last Will and Testament hitherto, even to the smallest tit∣tles and minutes: And doubtless you have taken the right course to secure a blessing to your self and family; for GOD Almighty who is so particularly mindfull of our lesser Charities, and payes us still present money for every cup of cold water given in his name, will not questionless be forgetfull of such signal returns & demonstrations of filial Duty and Obedience; but will in his time and manner, abun∣dantly reward them and recompence them; And besides you have the first Commandement with pro∣mise (as the Apostle calls it) for your security, and you may confidently build upon it, and con∣clude and argue from it. And therefore (my Lord) go on still in these pious and noble resolutions, and recover every day more and more of the likeness and resemblance of your Parents: and, May the
 Blessings of Heaven continually descend on you, and attend you, both in your Person & Relations, and May there never want one of your Name, and (if it be the will of GOD) out of your own Loins too, to keep up & perpetuate to the World's end, The Renowned Memory of your famous Progeni∣tours, which is, and shall alwayes be the prayer of
My Lord,
