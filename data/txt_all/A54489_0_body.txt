Gentlemen,
AMongst the many Decent and Suita∣ble Demonstrations of your Joy on the late Thanksgiving-day for Peace, I cannot but with great Pleasure and Satisfaction call to mind, what a full Congregation we had at Church, and how devoutly every one performed the Publick Service for the Oc∣casion.
You were then pleased to approve of this Sermon, as a Discourse suitable to the Oc∣casion,
and apt to stir Men up to a thank∣full Reception of so great a Blessing. Tru∣sting it will he thought so still, and have the same effect now it is Printed; I do in particular dedicate it to you, as a thank∣full Acknowledgment of the kind Welcome you have me at my first coming to you, and of the many great Civilities and Favours I have received from you ever since.
I should have presented you with it soon∣er, but that my great Indisposition would not suffer me to transcribe it for the Press.
I pray God requite you for all your Fa∣vours, and bless you both in your Spiritual and Temporal Interests, which is, and ever shall be the hearty Prayer of,
Dear Sirs,
