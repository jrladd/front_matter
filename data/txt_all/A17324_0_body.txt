RIght Honourable,
the importunate
desire of diuers wel
affected Christians
which heard these
sermons in London, and chiefe∣lie
of some that haue beene hum∣bled
with affliction of conscience,
hath preuailed with me for the
penning & publishing of the same,
which through the blessing of God

may bring cōfort & profit to more
then to those that heard them. In
regard of many honourable fa∣uours
and good encouragements
receiued from your Lordship in
the worke of my ministerie where
I dwell. I haue presumed to of∣fer
this my mite vnto you as
a poore testimonie of a minde
willing to be thankefull if it were
in my power, which both for the
matter that is handled therein,
as also for the manner of hand∣ling,
I deemed of right to be∣long
chiefelie vnto your Lordship
which (together with my good
meaning herein) if it shall please
you (which I humblie craue) to
construe and accept in good part,

I shalbe not a little encouraged to
take more paines in greater mat∣ters
then these come to. Thus cra∣uing
pardon for my boldnes. I
humblie take my leaue, commen∣ding
you to the aboundant and
gracious blessing of God. 1598.
