SIR,
THough Poems of this Nature have sustain'd such cruell fate, as if the (seeming) Catoes of the stage had judg'd the world, grown to a Plurifie in Wit, and no meanes left to Cure, save onely wounding; This Play, (I dare not say how worthy) was received generally well upon the Stage, which begets a hope, that having parted with my interest in it to the world, it will not fall under your Opinion, whom I pre∣sume to Elect as Iudge, not Patron: The latter being growne, by servile imitation to a word of forme descends beneath your worth: But by the first, your Candid cen∣sure has power to curbe that faction,
 which swelling to be Criticall, extends (like bubbles) to such Ayrie thinnesse, that seeming all, they lose themselves to no∣thing. As for the name of Poet, it is a stile I never aimed at, (though afarre off I have admired their sacred Raptures) and therefore will not be injurious to your Expectation, to bribe your Acceptance with promising Workes of a higher strain hereafter, this being only the Issue of some vacant houres, which if you vouch∣safe at like times to smile on, there ends the ambition of him, who at becom∣ming distance, desires to be knowne
