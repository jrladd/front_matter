ABstracted Soul, ravish'd with extasies,
Gone back, and now familiar in the Skies.
Thy former Host, thy Body, leaving quite,
Which to obey thee always took delight;
Obsequious, ready. Now from motion free,
Senseless, and as it were, in Apathy.
Wouldst thou not issue forth, for a short space,
From that Divine, Eternal, Heavenly place,
To see the third part, in this earthy Cell,
Of the brave Acts of good Pantagruel.
