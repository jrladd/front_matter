MY LORD,
WHEN I first compos'd this Discourse, I had not the least Thought of sending it abroad into the World: But partly thro' the Importunity of such as gave it a patient and favourable Audience, and partly thro' the Reflections of some, who, with∣out cause, are Enemies to our Great and Triumphant Prince, and partly thro' the Incredulity of others, touch∣ing

a Principal and Necessary Branch of true Repentance; Restitution: as also thro' the Hopes of its proving, in some measure, a happy Instrument to bring back into the Fold such Sheep as are gone astray; I have adventured its Pub∣lication.
And now, My Lord, this humbly begs the Honour of Your Grace's Pa∣tronage, and implores the Favour not to interpret the prefixing of Your Great Name to so mean and defective a Piece, as great Boldness and Presumption, but to accept it as a Specimen of Grati∣tude and Sincere Affection for all Your Kindnesses unworthily conferr'd upon me.
I am, My Lord, incapable of ma∣king Your Grace any other Return than this Publick Acknowledgement of them; with Fervent Prayer to the Great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, to protect You and Yours, and to conti∣nue

so Great a Blessing, as Your Grace is, amongst us.
I am sure all the Flock, committed to Your Pastoral Care, have the Highest Obligations to render unto Almighty God and His most Excellent Ma∣jesty, their hearty Thanks, as well as gratefully to commemorate the late most Pious and Incomparable Queen, for sending so burning a Light, so bright and shining a Luminary amongst them.
In what an Ocean of Peace and Tranquility doth the Great Ship (Your Large Diocess) now Swim? of which God and the King have constituted You the Supreme Commander: You not only Direct and Govern, but You pull at the Ropes and Sails with as much Vigour, as any Common Mariner that Sails therein: So Great is Your Lordship's Talent, so Indefatigable is Your Industry in Preaching, that Your

Grace might justly, with the late Lord Archbishop of Armagh, make this the Motto of Your Archiepiscopal Seal;
Woe is unto me, if I Preach not the Gospel.
That a Prelate, so singularly Eminent for Great Parts and Abilities, for Piety and Vertue, Care and Diligence, Meekness and Humility, for Love and Charity, may long Preside over and Adorn the Church of God, is the Affectionate De∣sire and Ardent Prayer of
My LORD,
