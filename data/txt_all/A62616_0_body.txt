GENTLEMEN,
THIS Sermon, which was first Preached, and is now Publish∣ed at your desires, I dedicate to your Names, to whose prudence and care the direction and management of this First general Meeting of our Country-men was committed; Hear∣tily wishing that it may be some way serviceable to the healing of
our unhappy Differences, and the re∣storing of Ʋnity and Charity among Christians, especially those of the Protestant Reform'd Religion. I am
Gentlemen,
