RIght Honourable Lords,
though vnworthie and
vnknowne (as nt wor∣thy
to be known to your
Lordships) I want that
good opinion begot by
foreknowledge, which,
like a pleasing glasse that
makes any thing that is seene through it seeme
better then it is, might set a faire glosse vpon
the forefront of this rude Poem; yet not doub∣ting,
but that your Honours will vouchsafe to

looke vpon my imperfections herein, with
more affection out of passion for the deads sake,
whom here I honor, then iudgement out of
reason to discusse, how vnworthie I am to dis∣course
of such Honor. I presume to offer vp in
my Walthams Complaint this funerall Obsequie,
or mournefull Mnodia, at the shine of your
Fauours, as the Sacrifice of my last dutie to that
most Noble, and to you most deare, dead Ladie;
of whom liuing, by her Sisters teares, my Muse
in her first Infancie of being knowne, finding
gratious acceptance, but depriu'd the fruition
thereof through ineuitable chaunce, and ho∣ping
with her weake breath to reuiue those
sparks that my inforc't absence had rakt vp in
the ashes of obliuion, lately singing the Image
of her Honer, was (alas tha: I should say shee
was) too suddainly thunder-striken by that
vnlookt for Dart of Death, in top of all her
hopes. Wherefore both of that consecrated to
her Honor, then liuing, and of this, deuoted to
your ordships, in honor of her now dead, most
humbly crauing your gracious Protections,
I liue
