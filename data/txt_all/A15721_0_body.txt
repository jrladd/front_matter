SYR: the combination of Zeale and Learning, wherewith GOD hath honoured you: together with your Loue, imparted kindly to mee by Letter, haue beene the Al∣lectiues to this small Remembrance. Where∣in I couet to shew my Thankefulnesse, and the great Respect I deseruedly beare you. I know mine insufficiencie to performe much on the best tearmes; much lesse, at this time, being worne with tedious Sickenesse, by the meanes of a grosse and cruell Ayre. Yet, it pleas'd the Lord to prosper this poore Indeauour at the Deliuerie; and who can tell, if hereafter Hee will blesse it, to the winning of some Soule? O, if Hee doe, what a sweet Addition shall it be to his
 former mercies. This gracious GOD assist vs by his Spirit, incourage vs daily in the course of our Ministerie; that spending our selues for the good of his Elect, wee may one day shine like Starres, for euer and euer. Amen.
