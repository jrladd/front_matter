SIR,
I Doubt not but diuers doe direct the Dedications of their Hea∣uenly Labours, according to earthly respects. But in∣congruous and vntunable Dedications, haue euer been harsh to my Iudgement, and it hath grieued mee much,

when I haue seen a heauenly parle offred to the hand, but trodden on by the foot of an earthy and sensuall Patron, To auoyd this Incongruity, I thought it best o dedicate a Worke that concernes the prosperity of the Church of Christ Iesus, to a louer of the same Iesus, of the same Church, and the same Pro∣sperity For such a one beares the face and presence of Ie∣hosaphat, which being seene incourageth a Prophet to speake, and not seene, dot make him speechlese. And surely I doe but testifie the Truth, when I say, that by ancient and inward know∣ledge,

I haue beene assured of your loue vno Sion, and your wl-wishg to the pro∣sperity of Ierusalem. And euen from this Root of Hea∣uenly Loue, doe I beleeue that our particular Friend∣ship hath suck most part of its nourishment; which I thinke the rather, because it hath beene hitherto durable, whereas worldly Friendships do vsually alter with world∣ly Changes. Wherefore as to a louer of Gods House, I present vnto you these par∣cels of Purple and blue Silk, which I haue consecrated to∣ward the reparation of the Tabernacle. And I desire

that when you receiue these words from mee, I may re∣ceiue Prayers from you; that God will daily adde to the Beauty of his Church, and that hee will prosper these and the like Workes, that in∣deuour to increase it. Ney∣ther shall your Prayers be al∣together vnrequited, for I will offer vp my hearty de∣sres, for your inward and outward Aduancement, and that as you grow outwardly in the World, you may grow inwardly in Christ Iesus. For growth in Christ, is the growth of a holy happinesse that shall flourish for e∣uer.
But growth out of Christ is the growth of Fuell, euen of an euer-burning but a neuer∣dying Miserie.
