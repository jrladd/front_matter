My Lord,
IT was a very easie thing for me to de∣termine, to whom I should present the following Discourses; as it was from your Lordship's Sermon before Their Ma∣jesties the last 5th of November that I had the hint of your Lordship's having seen the Memorial, that we had sought, but in vain, so earnestly after in the late King's Time; so it was by your Lordship's Interest that I obtained not only the happiness of seeing it, but the permission to publish it from the most authentick, if not the only Copy in England, from that which had been presented by the Jesuits to the late King James himself.
And since, my Lord, Decency requires the concealing from whose hands your Lord∣ship received this Copy of the Memorial, and the Leave for me to publish it; it was ne∣cessary for me to address it to your Lord∣ship, from whose hands I received it, that thereby any Objections against my Fidelity or Truth herein may be prevented; as all will, when my Lord Almoner's Name is seen at the Head of it.
Some indeed will wonder to see a Jesuit's Book dedicated by a Minister of the Church of England to a Bishop, that hath been always most zealous against Popery, and especially against the Jesuits Order; to such persons I hope this Apology will be sufficient, I am sure it will be to your Lordship, that I publish this Jesuit's Memorial, because I am fully perswaded that I am by it doing a greater service to the Protestant Interest a∣gainst Popery, than I was ever able to do by any thing I wrote against Popery during the Controversie in the late Reign.
In this Memorial we have naked Jesu∣itism, and the several Projects laid down, by which our Protestant Religion was not only to have been rooted out of England, but the very possibility of its ever reviving here prevented: and this I hope will teach some of the discontented People among us

to acknowledge at least, that our danger from the Jesuits Faction in the last Reign was as great as we made it, and that our Deliverance by their present Majesties was a far greater blessing upon the account of our Protestant Establishment, than they have hitherto been pleased to believe it.
I have had so much experience of your Lord∣ship's goodness towards me, that I do not in the least suspect your pardoning me the trouble of this Address. Had I had no other reasons to make it, the many favours I have re∣ceived at your Lordship's hands, would have engaged me to make this publick acknow∣ledgment for them, since I cannot but reckon it one of the greatest blessings of my Life, that I have the honour to be known to your Lordship, who are so eminent for your ex∣traordinary Learning, Piety, Charity and Moderation; I mention your Lordship's Moderation, because some Men of late have been pleased to be very angry with your Lordship for it: had your Lordship, and those Eminent Persons that continued of your Judgment, been as willing to part with Episcopacy as with the Apocrypha, and as desirous to lay aside the whole Liturgy, as they were to improve it; I should have excused their anger against you, for which I can see no other reason in the World,

but that your Lordship, and those of your Mind could not forget so fast and so entirely, as some others did their discourses, their promises and intentions about accommodating matters with the Moderate Dissenters, as well as giving ease to the rest of them.
That your Lordship may be blessed with a long continuance of health, and enabled thereby to finish those excellent Designs that you have under your hands; that you may long continue an Ornament to the Church of England, and to Protestant Episcopacy, and may be blest with success in your endeavours for the Establishment and Glory of both these, is the most sincere Prayer of,
