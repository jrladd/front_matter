MIne Honourable Lord; having Tran∣slated
some five or six years agoe, the
Historie of Don-Quixote, out of the
Spanish tongue into the English, in the
space of fourty dayes; being thereunto more then
half enforced, through the importunity of a very
deer friend, that was desirous to understand the sub∣ject:
After I had given once a view thereof, I cast it
aside, where it lay long time neglected in a corner,
and so little regarded by me, as I never once set
hand to review or correct the same. Since when,
at the entreatie of others my friends, I was content
to let it come to light conditionally, that some one
or other would peruse and and amend the errours
escaped; my many affairs hindring me from un∣dergoing
that labour. Now I understand by the
Printer, that the Copie was presented to your Ho∣nor;
which did at the first somewhat disgust me, be∣cause
as it must pass, I fear much, it wil prove far un∣worthy,

either of your Noble view or protection.
Yet since it is mine, though abortive, I doe humbly
intreat, that your Honour will lend it a favourable
countenance, thereby to animate the Parent there∣of
to produce in time some worthier subject, in
your Honourable name, whose many rare Virtues
have already rendred me so highly devoted to
your service, as I will some day give very evident
tokens of the same; and till then I rest,
