Sir,
THis Second Edition of my Hortulan Kalen∣dar is due to you, mindful of the honour you once con∣ferr'd on it, when you were pleas'd to suspend your no∣bler Raptures, and think it worthy your transcribing. It appears now with some ad∣vantages which it then want∣ed; because it had not that of publishing to the World, how infinitely I magnifie your contempt of (not to say) revenge upon it; whilst you

still continue in the possession of your Self, and of that re∣pose which few men under∣stand, in exchange for those pretty miseries you have es∣say'd: O the sweet Even∣ings and Mornings, and all the Day besides which are yours,
—while Cowley's made
The happy Tennant of the Shade!
And the Sun in his Garden, gives him all he desires, and all that he would enjoy: the purity of visible Objects, and of true Nature before she was vitiated by Imposture or Luxury! You gather the first

Roses of the Spring, and Ap∣ples of Autumn:Prim ve∣re rosam, atque au∣tumno car∣pere poma. And as the Philosopher in Seneca, desir'd only Bread and Herbs to di∣spute felicity with Iupiter; You vie happiness in a thou∣sand easie, and sweet Diver∣sions; not forgetting the in∣nocent Toils which You cul∣tivate; the Leisure and the Liberty, the Books, and Medi∣tations, and above all, the learned and choice Friend∣ships that you enjoy: Who would not, like You, Cacher sa vie? 'Twas the wise Im∣press of a Balzac, You give it lustre and interpretation: I swear to You, Sir, it is what in the World I most inward∣ly breath after, and pursue,

not to say that I envy Your felicity, deliver'd from the guilded impertinences of life, to enjoy the moments of a solid and pure Contentment; since those who know how usefully You employ this glo∣rious Recess, must needs be forc'd either to imitate, or, as I do, to celebrate Your Exam∣ple.
