CVstome which ma∣keth this claime of Dedication, and the goodnesse of your noble and worthy Natures, stirres in me a bouldnesse

to call vpon your names, and to fixe them to the Frontispiece of this small and little Treatise, that as a safe Armour they may shield it from the bitternesse of En∣uie. What the worke is, or how profitable it may be, either to the present times, or those of the future, your owne iudgements can better tell, then any defence in mee make perfect; It is sufficient that I haue haue brought it into the world to doe you Seruice, at which ende if it haue the happinesse to arriue, it hath the full gaine of all mine owne wishes; if otherwise it stumble on mischance, the obliuion which shall couer me shall bee no greater then the patience which I haue long since made mine owne and onely companion. Howeuer my hope which cannot sincke, and your goodnesses (which is the strong ground-worke of this my poore

endeauour) shall keepe mee thus confident that what I haue done is both honest in it selfe, and whole∣some for others, and with that Li∣uory I send it into the World to doe you and yours seruice, both here, and in other forraine places.
By him that is the true admirer of your Vertues.
GERVAS MARKMAM.
