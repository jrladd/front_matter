Right Honorable, Right Worshipfull, and Worshipfull:
WE here humbly present you with a True, though late
Relation, and Vindication of your impartiall Justice, in
the Tryall of Nathaniel Fiennes, the Unfortunate Go∣vernour
of Bristoll, which hath been over-long tra∣duced,
misreported, by the licentious Pens, the slande∣rous
Tongues of him and his, which will not yet
learn silence.
It was his own vainglorious humour that first inevitably enga∣ged
us, by publike Proclamations to be his Prosecutors, and now
inforceth us to become the Registers of his deserved Doom. Had
his Tongue or quill been discreetly silent, and not misreported his
ignoble surrender of Bristoll to the world, the memoriall of it had
been dead ere this, at least our Lips, our Pens would have conti∣nued
mute. And had he not returned to his former folly, in ju∣stifying
himself again in Print, after your Honorable just sentence
denounced against him (to the insufferable derogation of your
most upright Justice) this History of his Tryall and Condemnation,
(truly collected out of our broken Notes and Memories, without any
Sophistication of Additions) had never seen the light: But his
pertinacious insolency, first in appealing privately from, and since
in Writing openly against the Justice of your sentence, against the
Ordinances of War themselves, as summum jus, yea summa Injuria,
in his late Check to the Checker, to palliate or extenuate his own
Cowardize and Treason, for which he was condemned to lose his

head, hath now obliged us (in point of honour, of duty, both to
your Honours, the Parliament, Kingdom, Justice, and our selves)
to publish the reall verity of all the proceedings in this publike case,
under your Noble Patronage: to whom as we both resorted for Ju∣stice
in the Tryall of the Cause; so we now appeal for the Truth of the
ensuing Debates, Relation, Testimonies, as to the most equall Judges,
who tooke Notes of all the Passages, Arguments, Depositions on
either side, the true publication whereof will scatter all the mists of
Prejudices, Mistakes, Misreports, wherewith they have been
hitherto clouded.
Our desire is, that your eminent Justice may shine as bright in
this Relation of it, throughout the Realm, as it did in the Councell-Chamber
at Saint Albans, in the pronounced Sentence: from whence
the desperate Malefactor (who hath lost his braine, or modesty at
least in stead of his head) I know not by what prodigious Chymistry
endeavours to (*) abstract Arguments of his Innocencie,In his Check to the Checker. Integrity
Valour, against all sense and reason. If he will not henceforth
learn better manners, and submit himself to your publike Justice,
with humble acknowledgement, and Recantation of his former
Calumnies, we presume you will be so sensible of your wounded
Honors and Integrities, as to make this stout affronter of Justice, and
Cowardly Opposer of the common Enemy, a President to posterity in
point of exemplary Execution, as well as of bare Conviction; since
others of better extraction and desert then he,See here p. 118 (as Van * Hemert,
with two of his Captains by name) have lost their heads, for sur∣rendring
places of lesse consequence and strength then Bristoll, af∣ter
a longer, sharper siege by far then it sustained.
Thus submitting both our Canse and this unpolished Relation
to your Honorable, impartiall Censures, We humbly rest
