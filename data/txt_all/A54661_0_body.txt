SIR,
HAving by your generous Favour had the Honour of being introduc'd into His Majesties presence, where I delivered the substance of this following Narrative, and being press'd by the importunity of Friends to Publish it to the World, to which mine own incli∣nations were not averse, as which might tend to the infor∣mation of my fellow Sea-men; as well as satisfying the curio∣sity of my Country-men, who delight in Novel and strange Stories; I thought I should be very far wanting to my self, if I should not implore the Patronage of your ever Honoured Name, for none ever will dare to dispute the truth of any mat∣ter of Fact here delivered, when they shall understand that it has stood the test of your sagacity. Sir, Your Eminent and Steady Loyalty, whereby you asserted His Majesties just Rights, and the true Priviledges of your Country in the worst of times, gives me confidence to expect, that you will vouch∣safe this condescension to a poor, yet honest Sea-man, who have devoted my Life to the Service of His Sacred Majesty and my Country; who have been a Slave, but now have at∣tained my freedom, which I prize so much the more, in that I can with Heart and Hand subscribe my self,
Honourable Sir,
