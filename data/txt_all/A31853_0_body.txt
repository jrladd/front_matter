Right Honourable, &c.
SO many excellent Books have been of late Written in defence of Loyalty and the Government, in answer to those virulent and Seditious Pamphlets and Libels that have been Published amongst us, that we might reaso∣nably hope there should be hardly now left one disaffected Man
in the Nation: Yet it appears by those discontents that are still whisper'd, that there is great need of an anniversary meeting of this Illustrious Society, which not only by their Example doth encourage others to be Loyal, but can also force those to be such, who perhaps might have but little mind to it otherwise. And notwithstanding all that hath been said or Printed for obe∣dience to Lawful Authority, there are many so slenderly con∣verted, and so ready on all occasions to Relapse, that there can∣not but be frequent use of some plain Discourses, to shew the wickedness, as well as mischievousness of all disloyal Princi∣ples. To do this in some measure, is the honest design of the following Sermon, which is now humbly presented to your favou∣rable acceptance, By
Right Honourable, &c.
