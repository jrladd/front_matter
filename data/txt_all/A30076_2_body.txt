Most loving Friends,
DIvers of you having been pleased, to think me able to advise in Cases of this nature, (when in truth, I have been more inabled by your questi∣ons put, then you could by my resolves) I determined to joyn my own experience with such Collections I had made from you, to compose a Tract, which might be usefull; wherein I intended to shew, how Love, Profit, and Pleasure might be raised, and after maintained by a sweet and orderly Government; and this is that which I present yee: sure I am, if you weigh it well, 'twill be like a pleasant Garden, where you may gather sim∣ples for many speciall uses: and although the Scene be laid in Virginia, yet it may be applied to divers other places. Pray believe, I have not done this for the ad∣vantage of telling you in Print, I am your Servant; but the necessity of a Work of this nature, at this time, there never being any before, spur'd me on: And since in this, I do but trace your steps, in labouring for the publick good, I doubt not but you'll entertain it kindly, and give the Author leave to style himselfe,
