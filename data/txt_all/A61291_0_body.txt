SIR,
I Send this Book to you, be∣cause
you first directed me to
this design. The learned Gas∣sendus
was my precedent;
whom neverthelesse I have
not followed in his Partiality: For he,
though limited to a Single person, yet gi∣veth
himself liberty of enlargement, and
taketh occasion from his Subject to make
the World acquainted with many excel∣lent
disquisitions of his own. Our scope
being of a greater Latitude, affords lesse
opportunity to favour any Particular;
whilst there is due to every one the com∣mendation
of their own deserts. This
benefit I hope to have received from the
Variety of the Subject; but far more are
those I ow to your encouragement, which

if I could wish lesse, I should upon this oc∣casion,
that there might seem to have
been expressed something of choice and in∣clination
in this action, which is now but
an inconsiderable effect of the gratitude of,
Dear Uncle,
