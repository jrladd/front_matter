I Not respect the pride of common prayse,
Nor the disdaine of Fooles, abusing kind;
Rude Ignorance her thoughts could neuer raise
To iudge of Wisedome, or to know the Minde:
My heart in this, shall euer be precise,
To wish the loue of few, so they be wise:


Thus to the wight, whose thoughts are still deuine,
In whom a worthy honour'd heart doth raigne:
Where Wisedome in her best attire doth shine,
And all the vertues, voyde of all disdaine:
To such am I transferd, my Muse doth vow
To honour such a wight; and such are you.
