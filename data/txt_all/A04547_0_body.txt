THe very Arts (Right Honora∣ble and Worshipfull) which were wont to beare the attribu∣tions of [honestae & libera∣les] seeme now to temporize, and to haue learned the new-found skill of equiuocation. For, howsoeuer the former of these denomi∣nations adhereth censtantly vnto the Pro∣fessors of Mathematick Sciences, yet the other, which was once deriued [a liberali∣tate] and then intimated, that they were

anciently accustomed to performe liberall recompence to their louers and followers, hath now (to spare cost) purchased a diffe∣rent etymologie [a libertate] as properly accommodate to such as are [liberi] free∣borne, or (as our peculiar terme carrieth) Free-men. Which being so, and seeing that in this particular, as well as in many other of greater consequence, Tempora mutan∣tur—: I am thereby enforced to make vp the old verse, adding—e nos muta∣mur in illis; and to apply my long experi∣ence, together with tedious studies bestowed in this present art of numbers, to the vse and be hoofe of those persons, to whom by the generall appellation it properly belongeth, namely, to the studious thereof in this hono∣rable Citie. Which is the cause that I pre∣sume (without farther selfe-praise, of what I haue brought more vsefull, more easie, or more certaine and delightfull in the opera∣tions, then hath been seene before) to pre∣sent my Labours to your Hononrable and Worshipfull iudgements, to whom I owe of

dutie, whatsoeuer can be of mee performed, to the furtherance of Art, and the honour of this noble Citie, and the worthie Com∣panies therein.
