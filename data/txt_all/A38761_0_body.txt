SIR,
YOU have certainly the
best Right to this small
Present, which gives me
an opportunity to declare the
great Esteem, and Value I have
for you, since your two Sons are
amongst the Translators: and
all that know you must own
that your Latitude in the know∣ledg
of Men, Affairs, and Books
is very great; by the scrutiny of
which, the conduct of your Life
is so exact and eminent. To
these from my particular obser∣vation,
I must add, that your

Friendship is excellent, your
Worth unspotted, and your Ho∣nor
unbiass'd: yet lest I should
seem to lay the common Var∣nish
of Dedicators, I shall ra∣ther
contract my self, and at
present unite all these Rays, that
illustrate you, into one Point of
an incomparable Father, where∣by
you transmit, and kindle
these Virtues in your Posterity,
and labor to gratifie the present
and future time. The Hopes
and Advantages of your Sons,
besides my management, are
much to be ascribed to your pri∣vate
Care. If your true Tender∣ness
towards them, your search
for the best methods, and your
Zeal in the performance was
more follow'd, as 'tis exempla∣ry,
the sleepy Genius of our Na∣tion

would rouse it self, and we
should not only read Stories of
Noble Predecessors heretofore,
but view them living. Then
Horace's words might not be
ominous.
Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit
Nos nequiores, mox daturos
Progeniem vitiosiorem.
Your nice assistance in Educati∣on
well imitated, might adorn
our Country within it self, and
save many the trouble of dry∣nursing
their Youth abroad. Pro∣vidence
has ordain'd us all things
at home necessary for our Bo∣dy,
and why not for our Mind?
May not the Muses as well de∣light
themselves in our Rivers of
Cam, Isis, and Thames; as the
Sein, the Loire, and the Tiber?

To the gaining of this greatpoint,
in my experience, I never found
any motive more charming to a
Youth to prosecute his Studies in
any Language than History,
which insensibly draws on the
Student to gain the Tongue, and
insinuating an Appetite from the
beginning, continues it to the
end. All our Learning termi∣nates
in it; and in allusion to
History, I might say with the
Platonist, That Science was
only reminiscence of things
past. But laying aside their opi∣nion,
I am sure, the Wisdom of
the greatest Scholar, after all
the Labors of his Mind extends
no farther than to know the
Actions of former Ages, when,
where, and how they were per∣form'd;
that is, History rais'd

up with the two Wings of Chro∣nology,
and Geography: hence
from Observations, and Infe∣rences
he gains the name of Pru∣dent
to regulate his present Af∣fairs,
and wisely to foretel others
by consequences; what may fol∣low.
Why does the young Gen∣tleman
visit Forrein Countries,
but to learn History by the eye,
and to observe Actions and Pla∣ces?
History cultivates the Me∣mory,
and improves the Judg∣ment;
without which, Conver∣sation
is either dry or vain. Well
might the Roman Orator say,
That not to know what has been
done before us, is always to be
a Child. Wherefore he stiles
History, Testem temporum, lucem
veritatis, vitam memoriae, & nunci∣am
vetustatis.

The remembrance of Alex∣anders
Actions warm'd Caesar no
less than the sight of Miltiades
Trophies excited Themistocles;
and it as much deters Vice, as it
inspires Virtue. Livy tells us,
that, Inde tibi tuaeque reipublicae
quod imiteris capias, inde foedum in∣ceptu,
foedum exitu, quod vites. And
Dionysius Halicarnassaeus excel∣lently
describ'd its nature, when
he said ,
that History is Phi∣losophy
teaching by examples.
I am sure Homer's Wise man un∣der
the Character of Ulysses un∣dergoes
incredible dangers to
gain his experience in many pla∣ces,
whilst the Historian in his
Study without trouble enjoying
what others have smarted for,
may repeat these Verses of Lu∣cretius.

Suave mari magno turbantibus aequora
ventis,
E terrâ magnum alterius spectare laborem:
Non quia vexari quemquam est jucunda
voluptas,
Sed, quibus ipse malis careas, quia cer∣nere
suave est.
Wherefore for these reasons,
since 'tis the humor of the Age,
and to promote private dili∣gence
with mutual aemulation,
I thought it highly advantageous
to have this Historian Transla∣ted
by a select number among
us. The usefulness of Transla∣tion
I know you much approve
of, who are so good a Judg of
Letters: it procures two Lan∣guages,
and discovers their pro∣prieties
the easiest and quickest
way. I am sure the reputation

of the thing made them study
hard, which was a pleasant sa∣tisfaction
to me, and perhaps
may push them on all their life
to a true love of Books, since
they have already found the
conquest of an Author not dif∣ficult;
and Eutropius so easie by
their former Conversation with
Florus: The Translation may
very honestly be called their
own, with the Geographical In∣dex,
which they composed, suf∣ficiently
known to some Friends.
Then be pleas'd to excuse the
Style, if the Sense, and Gram∣mar
be true, as we hope, 'tis as
much as should be expected. Let
this Edition rather be natural,
and the second more artful.
Sir, 'Tis high time to free
you from this trouble, and to

beg pardon for it; yet conclu∣ding
with my sincerest Wishes
for your constant Happiness in
all your concerns, especially
with me, which I shall always be
most ready to advance; being
by Inclination and Gratitude,
SIR,
