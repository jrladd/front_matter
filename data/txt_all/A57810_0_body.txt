My LORD,
TO publish this to the World, to pre∣sent it to your Lordships hands, and by your hands to
the Church, is a Duty of such Exigency, that to seek leave to do it,
 or to make Apology for it, were as great a Folly, as to omit it were a Crime. For I
present nothing of my own, (all that, if any thing, is nothing worth:) but I pre∣sent what God
in great Wisdom for ma∣ny Ages laid up in the inmost Treasury of his Prophets, peculiarly, of
Solomon and Isaiah; and what now in good Pro∣vidence he hath discover'd in
the Very season of Time. The Discovery is his own, and nothing is owing to me, but I am an
hundred fold more than before indebted to his Fatherly Goodness, whereof this is not the first
Experiment of a Thousand. My Lord, however this may appear at pre∣sent; I dare here engage my
Reputation for ever (which is the greatest Engage∣ment can be expected) that in a short time
this will appear to be of God in∣deed, and every man that knoweth the
 terms of this Discourse, will judge it a vain thing to seek any other Account of
the Name or Number of the Beast. This is the End of that Great Controversie of the
Antichrist, Who he is: and I hope may prove an effectual end of all Controversie
between Protestant and Pa∣pist. It is the Key of all the Prophe∣cies concerning Antichrist,
and for ought I know, may serve to open all those My∣steries of Scripture, Old and New, which
are yet lockt up. Sure I am it will be very comfortable, profitable, and of present use to the
Whole Church. I have a greater and fuller Demonstration of this to make in my next Discourse.
But I would disco∣ver the Whole in the same Order to others, as God has chosen to discover
it to me. And I desire the help of all my Fellow-labourers in the Vineyard of Jesus
 Christ; and in the first place the Blessing of God, and the assistance
of the Great Witness of Truth, by your Lordships Pray∣er and Intercession for
My LORD,
