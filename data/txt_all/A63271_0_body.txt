My Lord,
IT is said by the Philosopher, that he merits more
Honour, who can maintain a City in Peace,
then he that defendeth it in Warr, which is
rather fear'd then belov'd, And Plutarch re∣ports
that Pyrrhus (though a Mighty Vaunter) con∣fest,
that Cyneas had won more Citties by his
Wisdome, then he had Conquered with his Sword.
Corona Civica, and Corona Ovalis, the one of
Oake, the other of Mirtle, were ever held more law∣dable
by the Romans than their Corona Aurea,
the Golden Crown, otherwise Corona Triumphalis
when the Chariot Wheeles swet Blood; When a Ci∣ty

is to be punisht with Warr, Sword, and Flame, any
hair-braind Phaeton will serve the turn, but to pre∣serve
it in Peace and Vnion, requires the Manage∣ment
of a solid and wise Magistrate. My Lord, it is
your happiness in this days Triumph to come with
Corona Civica, the Cities Love, and (I may
say, and flatter not) the soberer and better part of the
Nations, The Company of Merchant-Taylors,

acceptance of this Dedication as the early tender of
my serviceable affection who am
My Lord
