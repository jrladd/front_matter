MY LORD,
THough Ambition is one thing, that carries me to address my self to a Person of your Honour, and Ingenuity; yet there is a more common Prin∣ciple of self-preservation, which concurrs, and directs me to seek that Patronage, which will bespeak not only the Justice, but
the Candour of every Reader. And seeing the Royal Society have so great a sense of their happiness, when they are to act under the influence, and conduct of so Wise, and Honourable a President, I cannot question my own safety under the name of so great a Patron. When I reflect upon my self, that am a tender, and an infantile Author, I find nothing but fear, and discouragement, as I am in danger of being Overlaid by every little Censure; but when I consider my self under the Umbrage of a Person, whose Ex∣ample, and Authority may prevail with the World to be generous, and to imitate those Vertues, which they so much admire in your Lordship, this frees me from that diffidence, and timorous concern, which the censorious temper of the Age, and the sense of my own weakness are apt to create.
But although it may reasonably be thought, and I have confest, that I now design my own safety, that this Treatise carries your Lordships name as an Amulet against those cen∣sures,
which I expose it to; yet it will at the same time appear to be my duty to present to your Lordship, that, which the Relation you bear to the Royal Society, gives you a Title to. I do therefore humbly offer, and dedicate these Discourses to your Lord∣ship as a testimony of that profound respect, which is due to a Person of your Quality, and extraordinary Character, and it is certain, that every Member of the Society speaks the Sense of the whole, when he expresses the greatest deference to your Honour.
Having therefore consulted my Duty, as well as my Interest in this thing, I hope there is no one will think my addresses a rude transgression of the Laws of Decency. I must confess, that these Discourses are too mean, and unpolished to deserve your Lord∣ships Patronage, but since the desires of the Society did incourage my design to pub∣lish them, this seems not only to make them capable of it, but to bless them with a Ti∣tle to it. I do therefore presume humbly to
beg they may not offer themselves to the World without the advantage of your Fa∣vour, which will render them more ac∣ceptable, and gratifie to the utmost the am∣bitious desires of,
My Lord,
