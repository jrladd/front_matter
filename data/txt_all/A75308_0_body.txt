Worthy Sir,
I Cannot performe so much as I promised, but by performing more. I undertook upon your request to present you a Copie of this Ser∣mon in writing, and accordingly I set pen to paper, but my great distractions came so fast upon me, that in stead of writing I fell to scribling, so that if J had offered you my written copie, J should have exhibited un∣to you unknown mysteries in the letter, though I speake but plain things for the matter. So that I saw, I could not make this Sermon fit for private vse, but by exposing it to publique view. And so lodging in a Prin∣ters house, I did addresse my selfe to the presse, and that which others make their choice, I made my refuge, therefore if any blame me for sitting in the Printers stocke, let him take this for an Apologie. And since I am cast into this dilemma, that either I must be a fool in print, or be guilty of the breach of promise, let the most censorious criticks know, that I esteem that follie wisedome, that doth exempt me from the guilt of unfaithfullnesse, which in this short discourse I have stig∣matized
 with the black brand of Hell. But if there be no remedie, but this short treatise must be marked out for censure and reproach, I passe not for it, for it shall run but the same fate with the Author, and per∣haps for no other cause, but for that I desire to be acquainted with the subiect I treat of: And truly I expect to have this Sermon censu∣red by some for the Authors sake, and by others I expect to have the Author censured for the Sermons sake. However I desire to be no worse dealt witha, l then Salomons Temple was by Nebuzardan, who though he destroyed it, yet he took the gold. So if men will but own the subiect of this Sermon, and realize it in their practice, let them make me an Anatomie of reproach. I have prepared my back and shoulders to beare it. But as for you worthy Sir, I doubt not, but you will owne this discourse with all faults, since you have so often urged me to own my promise, and I am glad it shall lodge in the bosome of him, who in these staggering and declining times, hath made his brest the Sanctu∣arie of this grace of faithfullnesse, in adhering to Gospell principles, which will be your Crown, and your reioycing in the day of the Lord Iesus, in whose hand I leave you, who will be your Iacin and your Boaz, your strength and establishment, resting
