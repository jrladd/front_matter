GOod Sir, If Fortune frown or smile, thou art content,
Thou bears a Heart that is still ready bent,
God is thy Captain, thy Defence and Hold,
Through Faith in Him thou art still armed bold,
To thank Iohn Elliot I humbly thee desire,

He dwells in Unthank, he's Brother to Dunlibire,
When kind-kissing Phoebus was gone to her rest,
In a Winters-night in a most furious blast,
I driving Beasts because I wanted Fodder,
I did assault his House into tempestuous Weather,
For god AEolus biew, and Boreas did assist,
And Neptunes wat'ry Planets he brake in betwixt,
The Snow being deep, the Weather tempestuous ill,
I was five days in driving twenty Mile;
In great distress into his House I came,
He with his Wife made me kindly welcome,
With Bed and Board, good Brandie and good Ale,
Which might have serv'd the best in Tiviotdale.
I wish Iohn Elliot never want such Fleeces
Which yearly may bring in ten thousand golden pieces.
