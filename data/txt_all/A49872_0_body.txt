THe Establishment of the restored Sion-Church cannot be by Man or after Manly Wisdom, but by the holy Spirit, which Christ our Prince and Saviour hath sent in his own Name, to build upon the Foundation of the Father and the Son; a Rock indeed, which remaineth steady and unshaken from Time to Eternity. And indeed, who else is found suffi∣cient for the gathering and building of these holy Temple-Stones, that are to be fitly compacted together, to make up this glorious Church, that may be presented all fair, without Spot, as becomes the Spouse and Bride of the Lamb, which you will find the whole subject of the following Revelations tend to, even to the bringing out of all that are found in Lifeless Forms, into the very substantial Life and Ministration of the holy Spirit, where the Increase and growing up is known, into that Body, in which God will move and work all; for the which end all Prophecies that have been from the foundation of the World, may have their fulfilling in this last Age; for the which, good Assurance is given, from the fresh springing of the Word of Wisdom, that may produce a sealed Commission, not only in Letter, but from the feeling fiery-breath of the

true Unction, which is the living Epistle, by which alone I de∣sire to be made known to you, and from thence do send pure Love-greeting to them whose Ears are opened to hear and re∣ceive what the Spirit of Truth hath declared and unfolded in this little Volumn, which now is presented to publick view, contrary to the intent and purpose of the subordinate Author hereof, who, as I was waiting in my continued course and order, upon, the heavenly showring, and to feed, and be refreshed in this all-fruitful and pleasant Pasture, being satisfied here to take my lengths and breadths in all free conference with the Lord, the Spirit, whom I did well know by his inward flaming Body, which at certain times did stir and rise, and then I could hear and distinctly know the Voice of his Mouth, which came as a soft melting Fire-breath, and said, Record what since October 1679. hath been seen, heard, tasted and felt, and shun not to declare it, for it hath a peculiar ser∣vice on Gods behalf to do, though at present hid from thee; only observe and be watchful, and I will certainly Follow this at the Heels. And thus you may perceive under what constraint I am, and by whose Commission these deep and mystical Revelations are now published, who fore-sees what effects they are to have, and what Souls and Spirits are to be touched and enkindled from the same burning-Ray, which will surely over-shadow the believing. And for the doubtful, I have only this Caution, and that from the holy and just One. That henceforth they cease from rash and uncircumcised Judg∣ment, which doth arise from the rational Will and Spirit, and above all to put on the meek, simple and child-like Spirit, and so cease to be injurious to their own Souls; for nothing is more prejudicial to the growing and springing Life and Light, than to give way to Incredulity, and an evil Suspition raised from the dark Mists of Sense and worldly Wisdom, which can never reach the deep things of the Spirit. Therefore, if there be

any force, power or authority in that Word of Life that was from the beginning, and is now come to bear his own living Re∣cord in our day; which Word and Spirit of Truth and Wis∣dom let none resist, but open the everlasting Doors of their Souls and Minds for to take it in, and so you will of the lively Hope partake, and bear the true and living Testimony with us, That the Morning Star is risen for to lead us out of our selves, where nothing but Darkness is, and where the fallen Spirits keep their strong Hold, binding and putting out the Eyes of Sampson the Nazerite, the figure of the eternal Spirit, which is in all the Sons of Adam, against which the grand Apollyon hatcheth his treacherous Conspiracy; for he hath great Indig∣nation against us, because such Love, Grace and Goodness hath now abounded to us in Christ Jesus our Lord, who is come to offer himself an effectual Salvation in all; there is not a Door that he passeth by, but that at one time or other he knocks at it, and would find entrance in, to redeem and fetch out his own eternal Spirit, from under Bondage, Death and Misery: But such are the subtil Wiles of that Enemy of all Mankind, that he provides a Dalilah for some to steal and draw away their Minds, and to seduce their more Noble part to that which is vile, base and sensual. And then, another more subtil Bait he casts out for those who are mortified, and have escaped those worldly Charms, and are come to a sober and lawful use of the things of this Creation, and yet are held Captives through the Multiplicity of Mortal Cares, Businesses and Concerns for the outward Man, whereby they are so overcharged and weighed down in their Spirits, that they cannot get up to shake off this carthly Dust, to walk with God in Enoch's state, not observing that counsel of the Lord Christ, First to seek the Kingdom of Heaven; and with all getting, to get Wisdom: The contrary to which is most universally practised, in making sure first of the Beasts Kingdom, and the perishing Mamon of Un∣righteousness;

and then if the Kingdom of Heaven will fall in and be added to them, it shall be welcome; but alas! this will not do, Christ will not be served last. Wherefore, let not the Serpent beguile any who seek the Pearl of Christs Kingdom, but be wise, to avoid the choaking Earth and drowning Floods, and trust the Lord upon his Word, who will certainly make good whatsoever we part with on his account, as there are some who can witness to Gods Truth and Faithful∣ness in this matter.
A Third Caution is, for those who are got out of the Throng and Incombrance of worldly Multiplicity, and have thrown off all those weights and sins which do so easily beset them; they must know that all this will not fully secure them, though it be a very good Ground-Work, and greatly advantagious for the rearing up of Gods perfect Tabernacle within them, for the fol∣lowing Glories to rest upon it; but be advertised from the holy and true fore-sight of the Spirit of Jesus, who knows the Dangers and Perils which attend this state also; which though they have escaped the worldly Bondage and earthly Pollutions, yet spiritual Defilements may remain, which are of more danger∣ous consequence than briary Cares and worldly Distractions; for we have not only to do with a Birth of Flesh and Blood, but there are internal Powers and Principalities of an higher Descent, which joyn their Forces with the rational Spirit, which is the more wise and sober part in man, and therefore most readily take upon them, to prescribe Laws and Rules for the superior Soul to walk by, who finding it self fallen, stands in great need of an Help and Guide, to bring it out of this wretched Plunge and confused State, being convinced by Christ the true Life and Light risen within, how the case stands with it, and thereby made eagerly desirous to be set free from those inward usurping Powers, which come with all deceiveableness to circumvent and keep the Soul in the strong hold of a rational

Sense, which must be quitted. And now the enlightned Soul feeling the Malady so great and so painful, looks out diligently for a speedy Relief, and is ready to embrace every Physitian that doth profess to be skillful in the curing of Souls; where∣upon comes in a second danger, of which ye will do well to take heed, that is, to be cautioned from whom you receive Spi∣ritual Medicine, and whether they be such who have the true Balsom and Tincture of Life to give forth from the very Unction of God resting in them; for no other can be profitable unto you. All who have not this Soveraign White Stone, which knows only how to pour out his Name as precious Oyntment from Vessel to Vessel, are Physitians of no value. Therefore while ye in the state of Minority are, and have need to be under Pastors and Teachers, till you are come up to the highest Form, ready prepared and qualified for the great Master Teacher to undertake you, even the holy Spirit, who will perfect whatever was lacking in other Teachings, and through other Mediums, for which direct your Eye, waiting in a peactable Concord and silent Harmony, in your own Jerusalem within, whereupon written is to be, Holiness to the Lord in every Property; and then you will come to know the fresh Pasture∣springs, which are only under the breaking-up-Seal of the holy Unction, where no defiled foot hath ever come to raise the Dust, to discolour this golden Stream. This is the Ministration which you will find the following Openings to point out and lead to; and though as yet it be an unbeaten Path, which the Lord hath by his Instrument now declared, and made known in way of Vision and Prophecy; yet it is the true Day-star that will give its own light and witness: Therefore let the Won∣derers, Despisers and Contemners take heed of making a Mock of that which the Alpha and Omega will own and stand by, as his express Mind, who prohibited the publisher hereof from altering the way and manner of the revealing of these great and deep things. Therefore you have them unpollished, in their own

naked Simplicity as they were every day revealed & given forth, not in the dress of humane Wisdom; no, they are of another de∣scent, and the spiritual Ones in God will feel, know and taste from what Treasure-House they proceed: And as for others, we do not heed their Judgment, only shall be found in hearty Prayer for their true enlightning, that all may come to know what the Love-Trumpet doth now sound for, is it not that both Earth and Sea may give up their long buried Dead, and that his cursed Ground may no longer shut up the dead in Christ? Are not these Tidings brought from the bright East? that the Lord is coming to bring forth himself, in a new and marvellous. Re∣surrection, such as never was yet, and therefore hath before∣hand, sent his holy Spirit of Prophecy, to proclaim what he in∣tends to fulfil, according to his antient Purpose and Decree, and for this end hath shewed what Gates are to open, to give entrance into this All-fruitful Sharon, where the scattered love-Flock hath been hunted and chased as panting Harts, shifting their Pastares, and yet not finding where to lie down and be at Rest, which indeed can never be expected, till through the Seven Seals ye do come, where the full glorious Resurrection Day ye shall witness, through all things becoming New, where the holy Spirit, your Over-seer, and feeling Life, shall ever and always be known for fixation in the Resurrection State? And though the Saduces be numerous, that have no Faith ever to see this first Resurrection, which is from the Body of Sin to be made free, giving witness hereunto first, by being begotten alive from the Dead, according to the Scrip∣tures; You hath he quickned, who were dead in Tres∣passes and Sin: Therefore it is not incredible to us that God should raise the Dead, (see Rom. 4, 5, & 7 Chapters) but each one in Christ's Order; for allowance must be given for degrees; for as the Death is gradually, so is also the Resur∣rection

perfected through received Acts of Power; a Simili∣tude whereof we may see in the visible Sun, which doth not at∣tain its Meridian height at his first rising; and so the Body of the Resurrection doth not at once, but by degrees, advance to its full height of Lustre and Glory; So as we must give way to Measures and Degrees in all sorts, whether in dying or ri∣sing, all opening one Everlasting Mystery of Glory in the Powers of our Lord Jesus, who will bring all, one after another up to Glory. Now then let each one prove his own Work wrought in God, whether in Death, Resurrection, A∣scention or Glorification; for these are all linked together, As you may see in the Book, enti∣tuled, The Heavenly Cloud, by the same Author. though not attai ned or reached but in their own Order, still going on from the first Step to the last; the way for the Attainment of which, you will find described ac∣cording to the measure of the Spirit, given for Manifesta∣tion of these long hidden Truths that have lain under the Seals, where you will find the Path that leadeth into the Death, and the loosing therefrom, through the seventh Seal, opening for the Resurrection, which the seven Thunders do plainly express, and so proceed on to the ascending Reign in Christs Kingdom, which is great and magnificent, giving its own signal Demonstration, by opening the divine Magia, whereby the holy Spirit comes to act in his own place, viz. in the ascended Body of the Resurrection, from thence to go forth and work his Wonders, such as yet were never wrought, which will be the Introduction into the fixed Glorification, for to be Co-centred in the ascended triumphant Spirit, the Glory of which is attributed to the Lamb of God, of whom it is said, That he is worthy to receive Blessing, Wisdom, Power, Strength and Glory, for the effecting of so full and perfect a Redemption; all which shall be assigned to the glorified in Christ, who in the Royal unchangeable Priesthood

shall be confirmed, as going up from Glory to Glory, till swal∣lowed up in Glory, Power, Might and Excellency, the manner of which is defined as the Close of all that hath been treated of in this Book, as the finishing Testimony which at present was given me from the Lord of Glory. Therefore so receive them in Faith and Love, for this is the day of Gods Revelation, who sends forth this as a fore-going Harbinger, who according to his Promise will soon follow to fulfil all the rich and precious Things prophested herein; and therefore calleth upon his scattered Stones to get together, to Harmonize in the Eternal Light, Love and Purity, provoking each other to go on forward in this four-fold Process of our Lord Jesus, arising out of this long Night of Slumber; for the Day is broken, and the Morning-Star may be discerned. Consider to what a Life of Glory and Immortality ye are called, it is great and wonderful indeed; yet know, the East-Gate now will open to those that earnestly knock thereat; so that there is a certain possibility to get up unto all these Degrees of Glory: Where∣fore let none doubt, but be girded with the Omnipotency of Faith, which will rid the way swiftly, leaving all unbelieving Loyterers behind. A Race we have to run, some may not be yet set out, others newly engaged, and others a good way in the Race; but blessed are they who shall at the Price first come, that so they may return to strengthen, and encourage their Com∣panions in the Race, who may see the Rosie-Garland of Vi∣ctory in their Hands, and the Diadem of precious Stones, as the Price which they have won, which doth well deserve to be run hard for, not delaying so much time as to look behind, being once set out, but so run that we may obtain. But it may be questioned, Who, and where those are which are so resolute and strong in Spirit, as to hold out to the end of the Race? For this, none can be found indeed, but such as are arisen with Christ from the dead, he is & must become the Racer

in us; for all other Legs we run with will soon tire and be weary; therefore set not out till Christ your Life and Strength be ri∣sen, as a Gyant refreshed, to run out this conquering Race, where ye may come to lie down under the encompassing Glory, as in an everlasting pleasant Shade, possessing all those high and wonderful Immunities, Glories, Crowns, Joys, Gifts, Powers in the Holy Spirit, who will magnifie his Office in acting and working all in the Body of the Resurrection, con∣cerning which I shall no further enlarge, but refer you to what is treated of in the former, and this the following Revelations. I shall now cease, and shut up all in that springing Fountain, from whence this bundle of Revelations did proceed, having a good Hope and certain Perswasion, that the Lord will be with his own Testimony in a light Ray, spreading over all the Darkness of those Minds that shall attend and receive without Prejudice what is written, though to some it may appear Ob∣truse, Deep and Mystical, and hard to be understood, yet to others, who are come under the teaching of the same Unction, it will appear plain, and easily apprehended, and that the Spirit will bear record with us, of what was, and is, and yet is to come. Now the things yet to come, is that Powerful and Princely Reign unto Glorification, which hath long been prophesied of, and now again with an Affirmation, that the Lord will sud∣dainly be upon us, to take unto him his Kingdom, which no∣thing of the Beasts Reign shall mingle. Oh! Holy, Pre∣cious and Elect, let us not Sleep, but set our Morning-Watch, for Tydings are come to make all things ready for him: Let it appear who the Wise Virgins are, by their making themselves ready to meet the Lord, not only for a Visit or Salvation, but for an Eternal Marriage, and an un-inter∣rupted Nuptial Fruition, and so to be ever with the Lord, or rather the Lord to be ever with us, as his dear Bride, per∣fectly redeemed from the Earth, as it becometh her thus Holy

and Blameless to be found; for the everlasting Priestly Ce∣lebration and Holy Ministration, in no other Temple but what is called God and the Lamb where the only true Spi∣ritual Worshippers are found, and from whence our Praise-Offerings will spring, as from the bright Sphere of Glory, that swallows up Darkness, Death, Sorrow, Contempt, and the Curse in a full and total Victory; for the Hopes of which, and first budding Fruits now shall conclude with high Accla∣mation, Glory, Salvation and Praise to God and the Lamb, that cometh to Reign evermore; even so and Amen.
