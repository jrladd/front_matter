AS when of old in the triumphant Times
Of Poetry, before the Plague of Rhimes,
Apollo's Sons the lov'd Maecenas-chose
To Patronize the Labours of their Muse:
Nor were the greatest Wits his only Care,
The lower Orb had a becoming Share.
So in this Age, where-e'er Parnassus stands,
Your Lordship all the Region commands.
Her eldest Sons, with flowing Numbers crown'd,
Descend to Earth, and compass you around.
Nor must You take it ill from younger Wings,
A stronger flight from Dorset's Favour springs.


Accept, My Lord, a Youthful, humble Muse,
That, labour what I can, my Thoughts pursues.
My busie Mind, with Loyalty possest,
Dislikes it close and hid within my breast.
Nor should the rest, so much oblig'd to Write,
Forbear their Pens, when Themes, like this, invite.


Others, my Lord, with Pegasean Force,
Are able to attain the labour'd Course:
My following Muse, more humble in her Strains,
Attempts no Goal upon the crowded Plains.
Enough for me, whilst others scoure the Place,
And swiftly measure out the bounded Space,
Not to be last in the contending Race.
