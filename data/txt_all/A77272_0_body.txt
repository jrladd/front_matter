May it please Your Highness,
THE unspeakable Honour which your Highness is pleased to bestow up∣on this Trifle, is such, that a Pen more powerfull than I can pretend to, is not in any measure able to express it; But as your Highness has been pleas'd to Illustrate it by your Patronage, I have no reason to doubt, Sir, Your Pardon for the Authors presumption, in aspiring to such a Heighth, as Dedicating a work so worthless in it self, that it has nothing but
 Your Highnesses Espousal to Recommend it; And as it is Honour'd with so Glo∣rious, and Youthfull a Champion, to fight its Cause, I need not dispute, but may with confidence assure my self of its Success and reception; For tho' it may want Beauties to Insinuate its self into the favour of some, yet the Nobleness of the Patron will assuredly plead for its Defects, and make it passable to all. And since Your Highness has been pleas'd to Patronize this, I dare not question, but Your Highness will also give the unworthy Author the liberty of Subscribing him∣self,
