THE Design of these insuing Epistles was, at once to show the Misfortune of the Poet, and (by three Illustrious Virgins) the supreme Excellency of the Female Sex, in the glorious and elevated Rank of which, both Myrtilla and your self claim the highest respect, Homage and Adoration, that possibly can be paid to the Transcendent, and ingageing Charmes of Beauty, Innocence, or Goodness. Man in his first State in the delightful and exuberant Garden of Eden, where (as Milton expresses it) He was on every side surrounded with enor∣mous Bliss; yet notwithstanding all those paridisaical Pleasures he injoy'd, there was something still wanting to add too, and compleat his Happiness: Wherefore upon the mature and deli∣berate Thought of Heaven, what should this remaining part of his Felicity be, but the privation or absence of his afterwards? So admired Eue, and verily the best and greatest of Men in all Ages of the World, since the Times of the original Pair, have ever acknowledg'd as justly due the greatest difference to Your most beautious Sex. For indeed, let the smaller Poets discant ne∣ver so much on the Praise of Mau, or let the Orators by the Elo∣quence of the Chair, magnifie him to the highest Degree and pitch they are able, yet I will be bold to Affirm, Woman in Beauty does as far surmount and exceed Man, as the more pure and bright Regions above surpass these the more thick and gross here below. Kings have laid their Crowns, Princes their Scep∣ters, and Generals their Wreaths at the Feet of the fair Cleopa∣tra: Numa, (who instituted the Holy Fire) had his Mountain Nymph, and if I may be allow'd to say as much, it being my aim only (I assure you by Apollo and his silver Bow) to manifest the extream force and power of Beauty, Henry the Second of England had his admir'd Rosamond, and from whose very Room out of which she went to Woodstock Bower and was there Poisoned by Queen Elinor, I am now writing to you this Epistle, yet Cleopatra the delight of Emperors and joy of Kings was inferiour to; and had not envious Time (the mortal Enemy to all Beauty's) by placing these two lively Images of the Deity
at so great a distance the one from the other put it out of the reach and height of compare, Cleopatra surely might have borrow'd Charmes from the more beautiful Cesaria, and Rosamond have supply'd with the clear shining Light and Fire of Myrtilla's Eyes, those of the yet infinitely more feeble and languid Flames of her own; nay, even the Grecian Hellen, were it possible for her to behold in these sweet Arcadian Groves, the noble and ex∣quisite Form of the incomparable Cesaria, with the no less won∣derful Myrtilla, would easily confess, and readily grant, that the united Charmes of the whole fair Sex together, was immensly visible (in these two Virgin Sisters) nay, almost wholly consisted in Cesaria's and Myrtilla's Eyes: Wherefore fair Nymphs, may it please you to accept of, and Patronise these few Poems, and by the condescending to which request, you will greatly oblige him who is, with all imaginable Zeal, Sincerity and Respect, O immaculate Nymphs and fairest of all Women,
