MADAM,
UPon Your Request I have adventured to appear in Pub∣lick, and expos'd that to common view, which I thought would never have gone farther than my Study. Not to have yielded to your desires had been uncivility; and though I am sensible of the weakness of the Discourse, yet to pleasure you, I have resolv'd to deny my self in that thing we call Credit and Reputation; the rather because in this Sermon I have prov'd it to be Vanity. The Text was of your Daughters choosing; whether she regarded the sound more than the sense, I will not enquire; but as the different sentiments of Divines about this passage, have allow'd it a place in the Catalogue of the sublimer mysteries of the Gospel; So if I had had more time to view and correct my Comment, it might have come abroad more polish'd, and fitted more to the palate of the Age. What nicer men would have made the Scene of curious Speculations, I have endeavour'd to make as practical as I can, being sensible that our work is to convert Souls, not to paint them. In an Age so loose as ours, so full of Vanity and Sin, we had need be very serious and earnest with men to come away from these

Idols, to serve the Living God, and as this shall be my sin∣cere endeavour, while the Great Master of my Life is pleas'd to continue me in the station I am in; So if I can contribute any thing, either to your Ladyships, or your Relations Spiritual Advantage and Edification, it will be no small Satisfa∣ction to
MADAM,
