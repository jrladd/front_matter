My LORD,
YOur Patronage, like your Self, is Hono∣rable; the true merit, and high repute of whose piety and learning, is voice enough to speak my Summary of Truths Orthodox. It is not (then) without design, that I am solicitous to present Sion's Prospect to your Lordships sight, it be∣ing my confidence and aim, that this View of Divine Truths, having had its review by so clear a judgment for its approbation, I may not hereafter fear what eye it shall be exposed to, for its censure. Besides (My Lord) in this general maze of the Churches troubles, affrigh∣ted Truth, seeking safety, I directed her to take San∣ctuary

in the Temple of Honor, and to offer her devoti∣ons at your Lordships shrine; Let (then) a propitious goodness deign acceptance, and give protection to the humble Suppliant, not to be violated by the profane hands of ignorance and of error. If any question the con∣fidence of this my Address to your Lordship, it is enough that I point them to theApud Anti∣quos, Quercus Jovi, & Lau∣rus Apollini Sacrae, virum nobilem tàm de Ecclesia, quàm de schola litera∣ria optimè me∣ritum, emblema∣ticw̄s loquuntur. Oak, and the Lawrel standing at your Gate, with this Inscripsion of honourable Fame, Here dwels the Clergy's Patron. But, besides this, (My Lord) mine (once near) relation, to your (late de∣ceased)Ds. T. G. Eques felicis memoriae. Uncle, as it gave me my first admission into Your Lordships presence, so will it countenance my pre∣sent presumption of Your Lordships Patronage; and it will be no error, if I think at once to engratiate my Ser∣vice to Your Self, by his Memory, and ennoble my Work unto others by Your Name. This in publick, as to a formal Dedication; I retire into privacy for the more real devoting my self, in the sincerest fervour of my heartiest Prayers.
My LORD,

Richmond in Surrey, pridiè Non.
Maii, 1651.
