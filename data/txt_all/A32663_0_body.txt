My Lord,
THe Principle Induce∣ment to the making your Lordships Name Preliminary to the ensuing Publication, proceeds from a Contemplation in me, that

nothing could be more pro∣per in the prosecuting such an Attempt, than to Dedi∣cate that to your Lordship, which comprehends, not onely the Royal Charter. and Priviledges, granted by Our Gracious Soveraign King Charles the Second, but also those of all his Royal An∣cestors and Predecessors, to one of the most Ancient and Glorious Cities in Europe, in which City your Lordship now attains the Highest and most Eminent Place of Ho∣nour and Authority. And the main reason of the Publi∣cation

it self receives its Rise, First, From a Desire in me, to make it appear to my Fel∣low Subjects, how far this Famous and Celebrated Me∣tropolis, hath been Esteemed and Honoured by those Great Monarchs of this Isle, who have been pleased again and again to illustrate the same, by many Eminent San∣ctions under the Great Seal of England (for I may be bold to aver that no City or Cor∣poration in the Christian World (and so consequent∣ly in the Universe) did ever arrive to a more immense

Greatness than this City of London hath derived from the Gracious Inclinations of the Prince, which have been va∣lidated by so many Acts of Parliament, and their Laws and Franchises thereby made (as it were) unalterable, by the unanimous Consent of the King, Lords and Com∣mons, the Body of the whole Nation, for the establishing to them a more lasting Estate and Condition of Wealth and Prosperity in Ages to come:) And Secondly, To the intent that the several Members of this great Body

might the better know how to yield an Entire Obedience to those sacred Laws, under which they are so strictly bound for the Common-Weal of the City; and so live in Peace and Quiet un∣der the Government of an Indulgent and Gracious Prince, to whom they owe their Protection and Sup∣port. For these Reasons, my Lord, I hope you will vouchsafe to grant me your Pardon for this Presumption, and accept the same as the Offering of him, who is a hearty Well-wisher to the

Prosperity of this Great and Opulent City, and who shall ever remain, with all respect,
MY LORD,
