THou, thou that art the Muses Adonie,
Their Pyramis, adorner of their mount,
Thou Christalizer of their Castalie,
Thou Lillian-rose, sprung from the horse-foote fount,
To thee, Artes Patron, Champion to the highest,
That giuest the Sunne a fairer radiance,
To thee Musophilus, that still appliest
Thy sacred soule, to be Trueths esperance.
To thee (this Epinyctall register,
Rasde out by Eos rayes) I write to thee.
To thee (this hoarie Hiems, kill'd by Ver:)
To thee (this metamorphosde Tragoedie)
To thee, I write my Apotheosie:
Moecenas, strengthen my Tyrocinie.
