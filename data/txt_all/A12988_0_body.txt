SVCH (RIGHT WORSHIP∣FVLL) haue been the manie and manifold bounties and fauors, euer since my first being acquainted with you vntill this day, extended from your W. in most courteous manner not onely vnto my selfe, but also vouchsaued sundry other of my good friends at my request, that howsoe∣uer vnto others I haue peraduenture giuen such woorthie testimonie of the same, as wherewithall they haue been contented, and supposed me to be a thankfull recounter of benefits receiued, yet could I neuer heerwithall satisfie and content my selfe, bicause the greatnes of your deserts towards me and my friends hath seemed woor∣thily to be further published vnto the knowledge of all posteritie, vnto whom (as dutie bindeth me) I do most willingly acknowledge, that the gratefull remembrance of the same, so long as life doth last, and breth not faile, shall neuer be extinguished, nor buried in the lothsome lake of odious obliuion, but alwaies be reserued fast locked vp in the safe custodie of a most dutifull and thankfull mind. And to this end hauing no other means of better value, to testifie my thankfull dutie, I haue presumed vnder your worshipfull and learned patronage to send abroad this plaine and easie laying open of the English rules of Construction for the yoong Punies of the Grammar schoole, in so familiar and euident a maner, as the meanest wits, and slenderest capacities may to their no small benefit and profit (as I am perswaded) vnderstand and beare away the same. And heerin though I haue chiefly framed my selfe vnto the simplicitie of the little ones and yoonglings that are occupied in these kind of studies, yet some thing here and there I haue inserted, not vnwoorthy altogither of the obseruation and marking of those which are of further reading.

If it shall of any be laid vnto me for a fault, that I spend time in these small trifles, and Grammar matters, the which might better be imployed about things more serious and of greater moment and importance, my de∣fence is, that to haue laid well the ground worke, and as it were the founda∣tion, whereupon the whole frame and building in a manner of the Latin toong must be setled, is not in deed and in truth, to be deemed a light and toyish matter, but that shall bring great ease vnto the master, and also good furtherance vnto the yoong beginners, if with diligence and heedfulnes they looke into the same. Besides that I know not how it commeth to passe, that as, Nauita de stellis, de bobus narrat arator, and euery one as he hath been brought vp, deliteth to be talking of those things for the most part wherein he hath been most exercised: so I hauing spent many yeers about the in∣structing of youth in the principles and rudiments of the latin toong, can not choose but euer now and then be harping on those matters, with the which in former times I haue been so long and well acquainted. If any be∣nefit may grow thereby vnto those little ones, for whose sake, as well to saue them from the rod, as also to encourage them by this plaine laying open of the meaning of their rules, with more willingnes, and cheerfulnes to goe forward in their studies: I shall haue obteined my desire, submitting in all humilitie this my simple trauell, such as it is, vnto your wise and lear∣ned censure, whom I most hartily pray and beseech after your accustomed and wonted clemencie in such sort to accept of the same, as by me towards your W. it hath been ment, namely an vnfained token of most dutifull and hartie good will, the which for many curtesies I owe vnto your Worship, whom I pray the Almightie long to preserue in peace and prosperitie to your good contentment, and benefit of your Country. Tunbridge this 16. Nouember, 1590.
