Worthy Sir,
THat which is report∣ed
of Egesias the Phi∣losopher,
that he
could so accurately
decipher the miseries & wretch∣edness
of Life, as to make Men
out of love with it, and so
colour over the grim face of

Death, as to make it desirable;
that is only really performed by
this Text: A little Rhetorick
may serve to perswade a poor
man to forsake his thatch'd Cot∣tage,
if you can assure him that
by so doing, he shall have a bet∣ter
habitation: The most effe∣ctual
way to make a Christian to
despise Life, and desire Death,
is, to present him with a sight
of his Heavenly Mansion, and
then with S. Paul, He can groan
earnestly to leave this earthly
Tabernacle, when he knows he
hath a building of God, a House
not made with hands, eternal in
the Heavens; for though nature

abhor a dissolution, yet it covets
happiness; so that Reason it
self may well assent to the desire
of being dissolved; when Faith
hath rightly informed it that it
is far better; for it is wisdom to
admit a change, when we are
sure it shall be for our greater
advantage.
Sir, if you thus look on Death
(though as a dark entry) yet as
the ready passage to our Hea∣venly
Mansions, then I shall
need to say no more, either to
quiet your Spirit concerning the
Death of your dear Wife, at
whose Funeral this Sermon was
Preached, or to make you more

willing to entertain more fami∣liar
thoughts of your own disso∣lution;
If it be far better to be
with Christ, than to linger still
on Earth, then what remains?
but that we patiently bear the
departure of our dearest Friends
and nearest Relations, and cheer∣fully
expect our own; that we
may be so far from fearing death,
as rather to welcom it: who
baulks a friends Invitation, be∣cause
he imployes a Blackamore
to be the Messenger? What
though Christ send his Negro
(Death?) seeing it is to invite
us to a Feast with him in his
Kingdom; We know Christ is

our best Friend, and though at
first we may startle at the Mes∣senger,
yet the very Message
shews that Death be-friends us
too; If God make this Sermon
useful to be your remembrancer
in these great duties, let him
have all the Praise while you re∣ceive
the profit.
