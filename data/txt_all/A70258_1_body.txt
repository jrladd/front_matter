Madam
SInce for Persons of Your Quality
and Merit, it is usual to suffer
Afflictions of this Nature; there
is now a necessity that you un∣dergo
Your Fate, which is so much the
sadder, in that all those Excellencies
which in you shine in their Meridian,
and might command Reverence from
the most Savage World, serve only to
incourage my Rudeness, and with me
to become accessory to your own Per∣secution.

But it may be (Madam) after an
humble Acknowledgment of the guilt,
that Goodness of Yours (which ex∣cepts
no Sinners) may be gain'd to
think the Crime Venial, and that par∣ticular
Condescension which hath here∣tofore
showr'd Obligations upon Your
most humble Servant, may stretch out
Your saving Hand to receive a Present,
that would live onely in and by Your
favour.
'Tis true (Madam) that the Worth∣lesseness
of the Present might very
well have dispirited the boldest attempt
in this kind▪ had I not considered that
I should thereby better Consult for
Your Glory, when the World shall
take notice that my greatest Ambition
hath been not to raise Trophies to my
self by Writing well, but only to pay
my just and respectful Devoirs, and
that by publishing Your Names and
Vertues, I might shew a Pattern of all
that is Excellent and Good; which
(Madam) if I should strive to embellish

with what Art of Words can add to
render any thing Illustrious, yet would
all fall far below the Dignity of the
Subject, and I should be constrain'd at
length to leave it as altogether unaffa∣ble.
If then (Madam) what is wanting to
the true payment of Justice and Obliga∣tion
to Your Vertues, Your Goodness
will allow my Zeal of owning to supply,
please to accept this trifle as the best
Testimony I can at present make of it,
which when receiv'd into Your choice
Closet, and sometime turn'd over by
Your fair Hands (when you please to
give Your own quainter thoughts leave
to rest) will give me just cause to call
my self the happyest man living, and for
ever fix me
Madam
Your most humble and most
obedient Servant.
