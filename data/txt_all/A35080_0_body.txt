SIRS,
IN an Age wherein Religion and Loyalty have been of late so much out of fashion, I could not but be very well pleased to find such a Dis∣course as this, so acceptable to a considerable part of the greatest County in the Kingdom, as that You not only gave it the hearing, (though I tryed your patience, more than would have be∣come me upon any other Subject than The Whole
 Duty of Man) but were also pleas'd una imously to command the Publication of it for the benefit of others who might need the counsel of my Text, more than your selves. How unfit I was to per∣form the Task which you laid upon me, my own Reason (though exceeding weak) does sufficiently resolve me; but the Subject is such as will recom∣mend it self, and the weaker my Discourse upon it is, the more pregnant Testimony will it be of my Obsequiousness to your Commands, when I shall have given up it and my Understanding to your Pleasure If it help to make any better Chri∣stians or Subjects, I shall think my Pains very well bestowed, and be very thankful for the Honour you have done me in laying your Com∣mands upon me to undertake this Imployment, and giving me this fair opportunity of testifying to the World, how ready I am to approve my self,
