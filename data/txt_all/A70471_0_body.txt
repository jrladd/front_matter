MY LORD,
WHen the dark night of our con∣fusions was by Gods wonderful mercy, (never to be forgotten) well nigh at an end, by the near approaching of our Sun, the breath of our nostrils, our dread Soveraign Lord the Kings Majesty, unto the horizon of his paenitent and loyal Subjects in his hereditary Kingdomes and Dominions, where∣by
all began to be revived, & to be prepared for the receiving all good impressions: in this beginning of our happiness, (considering with my self by what best means men of different apprehensions concerning Ecclesiastical things might be brought unto godly unity and meet uniformity therein;) I thought that the knowledge of the state of the Church of Christ in the Apostles dayes, and in the four Centuries following their times, (as to the form of Ecclesiastical Government, Discipline, Liturgy and Rites, used in them) would very much conduce to the attainment of that blessed end. For in those dayes many thousands of holy Con∣fessors and Martyrs flourished; in those times lived the most reverend Fathers of the first four general Councils, of Nice, Constantinople, E∣phesus and Chalcedon, celebrated over all the Christian world; of whose wisdome and godly care, to do nothing in those particulars against the institutions of Christ and his Apostles, but rather to do all things as might be most pleasing to God, and most conducing to the edification of the Church, no prudent and charitable man can enter∣tain the least doubt: Men they were, and might erre; but that so many men of extraordinary ho∣linesse and wisdome, compared to the best men of these latter Centuries, should unanimously agree
for the space of two, three or four hundred years in setting up and practising superstition, is incre∣dible to them who believe that God hath promised to teach the humble his way, and shew his cove∣nant to them that fear him, and not to forsake them which have not first forsaken him. Having therefore reason and religion to assure me, that all understanding and sober men, if they could once see the form of Church-government, with the Liturgies and Rites used by those Primitive Churches, demonstrated by undeniable testimonies of pure antiquity, would easily be induced to em∣brace them so far as they should appear to be con∣venient for Christian unity and edification, in the present circumstances of time, place, and persons, (whereof not private men, but the Governours Civil and Ecclesiastical are the onely Judges on earth) I made what inquiry I could, if any book were extant in the English tongue containing a brief, full, and plain demonstration of all the said Ecclesiastical things, which might be had at a cheap rate, soon read over, and easily understood by all men of indifferent capacity, whereby the knowledge of those things might be the more divulged: But, after diligent inquiry, finding none, I resolved (being the work was within the limits of my vocation, and in reading
the ancient writers, I had with no small diligence noted the passages conducing thereto) invocato Dei Opt. Max. Nomine, to use my poor talent with my best indevour to write such a little book, which should comprehend in it the sum and substance of all the matters above specified, as briefly, fully and plainly as I could. And this was the beginning of this small Treatise; which, being ended in convenient time, was offered to worthy men of excellent indowments to be perused by them, in hope that one or other of them (knowing the usefulness of the matter treated of, and obser∣ving the too plain, low, and uneven manner of writing) would be moved to put forth a work upon that subject; which (being replenished with good variety of well ordered matters, adorned with convenient eloquence, and commended by the worthy name of an Author famous for his lear∣ning, eloquence, and vertues) would be by all rea∣dily entertained, greedily read, and would sweet∣ly convey the things desired to be published, to the knowledge of all men. But herein my hope failed me: For those worthy persons were so im∣ployed in the high and weighty affaires of the Church, that they had no leisure to go about this, (although an useful work, yet) of less profit to the Church and less proportionable to their great abili∣ties,
then the sublime imployment, wherein their time was spent. What remained then, but that either that needful work must be altogether want∣ing, or this poor treatise so void of due ornaments must be suffred to go abroad. I had indeed once in a manner resolved to bury it in my study, but an occasion bringing the matterr into a new debate, I suffered some reasons to prevaile with me to give it leave to present it self to the view of the world; yet not without some honourable Pa∣tron the glorious lustre of whose great learning, Excellent Vertues and pretious name might both illumminate it, and conciliate for the mean and obscure author some room in the good esteem and affection of learned and good men. For which end I thought it most convenient to make choise of one of those very bright stars, which his Majesties wis∣dome and goodness had been pleased to set in the firmament of our Church: among whom your Lord∣ship was first presented to my thoughts in your ve∣ry learned, elegant and eloquent works, especially both in your testification of your great and very remarkable zeal for the now most blessed and glo∣rious Saint and Martyr our late glorious King CHARLS the first, and in your no less zealous fidelity to our most dear and dread Soveraign Lord King CHARLES the second, manifested in
times of greatest peril, and also in your sighs, groans, complaints and prayers for and of the Church of England in her deep distress, in your prudent & indefatigable endevours for her restau∣ration, in those parts of your Lordships most learned writings, wherein, as in exceeding fair monuments more lasting then brasse, you consecrate the blessed Memories of many very precious names, viz. of the right reverend Fathers, Bishop Andrews, Bishop Morton, Bishop Potter, Bishop Hall, Bishop Brownrigg, and other honourable persons, never to be remembred without due acknowledgement of their transcendent worth: and especially, of the most reverend Father in God, Dr. James Usher late Arch-bishop of Armagh, and Lord Primate of all Ireland; who, in an exact knowledge of all good learning, in depth of judgment, in the due stating and well cleering controversies of Religion, and in sanctity of life, was not much (if at all) inferior to any the best of Bishops since the Apo∣stles dayes; And lasty, in an acceptable tast which I have had of the sweetness of your vertue in a particular favour, for which I present my humble thanks to your Lordship.
May it please you, right reverend father, to take this small work into your honorable patronage and protection, and, pardoning my boldness in this at∣tempt,
to take in good part the very humble and hearty tender of my best service to your Lordship. God Almighty long continue your life and prospe∣rous Estate, and make you a happy instrument of much good to his Church.
