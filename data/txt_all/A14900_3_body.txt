RIght worshipfull, it is no small comfort the Musicke pro∣fessors conceiue, when they consider the euer misdeeming multitude to brand them with infamy, whom the most Ho∣norable spirits haue alwaies honored: and although pouer∣tie hath debarred them their fellow arts mens companie, yet nature hath set their better part at libertie, to delight them that loue Musicke. Amongst so many worthy men dayly labouring to call home againe the banished Philomele, whose purest blood the impure Minstralsie hath stained, I must presume to remember one of your wor∣ships least labours, (your greater deedes greater men must seeke to re∣quite) the entertaining into your seruice the least proficient in Musicke, who with all dutifull obseruancie, humbly commend my poore labours to your worships protection. My yeeres yet vnripened, and this worke not a little hastened, cannot promise any choice notes of Musicke, yet notwith∣standing I presume that gentlenes which accepts my seruice, will neuer reiect the labours of his seruant: Thus humbly taking my leaue, I leaue these to your worships fauours, and you to the keeping of him that best can keepe you.
