Right worthy Sir,
IT was your pleasure to lay this taske upon me, to preach this Sermon; and that done, it begat another farre greater then it, that was to Print it; to whom then should I returne it but to your selfe who hath the best Right to it? I wil not make my Epistle swel by trumpetting out your Fame and Praise, in the remembrance of your noble and prudent carriage and deportâˆ£ment in all the great Offices of Honour and Trust which you bear, (which renders you so worthy a Patriot) but only (with tender of this Paper present) Subscribe my selfe.
