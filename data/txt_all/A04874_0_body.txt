Sir,
THinking of amends
to expres my grate∣fulnes
for those ma∣ny
Favours You
have shown me, I could pitch on
no other more fit than this my

Genius prompted me, it was well
thought on, if Yours give it the
like acceptance I am happy: for
Workes of this Nature, I dare
affirme, have beene acceptable
to most men, contemn'd by
few, unlesse it bee those of the
more Stoicall disposition, whose
rigid Fronts cry downe all things,
but what themselves approve
of. For this Worke of it selfe, I
may say thus much without
blushing, it received the rights
of a good Play, when it was
Acted, which were Applauses &
Commendations, whether it
merited them or not, I leave to
your Judgement: the Nature of
the Worke, being History; it con∣sists

of many parts, not walking
in one direct path, of Comedy, or
Tragedy, but having a larger field
to trace, which me thinks should
yeeld more pleasure to the Rea∣der,
Novelty and Variety being
the only Objects these our Times
are taken with: the Tragedy may
be too dull and solid, the Comedy
too sharpe and bitter; but a well
mixt portion of either, doubt∣lesse
would make the sweetest
harmony. But this Worke as it is,
and my wishes that all defects in
it, to my desires, and your con∣tent
were supplide, I commend
to your perusall, my selfe, it, and
resting, to bee commanded by
you in all friendly Offices,
