THe long trauell and tracing out of life in this wearisome pilgrimage (right honorable) hauing brought me now almost to the ende of my iourney, makes me glad (with a restles desire) to be rid of the burthens of my minde and the labours of my body, the one neuer free from studie, and the other seldome voide of toyle, and yet both of them neither brought great benefite to the life, nor bles∣sing to the soule: in which small rest and vnquietnes, many sorrowfull discourses in my dayes I haue written, and num∣bers of bookes I haue printed: and because they shall not be buried with me, I challenge them all as my children to abide behinde me in the worlde, to make them inheritors of such fame & dispraise as their father (which begat them on sweet inuention) heere enioyes or deserues: hoping they shall not be called bastards, nor none aliue will be so hardy as to call them his babes, that I haue bred in my bowels, brought forth and fostred vp so carefully at mine owne charges, and hazard of an enuious worlde. And now indeede for that diuers (of disdainfull disposition) doo or may hinder the good reporte

of those labors which I thinke well bestowed among my freends, I haue set forth while I am liuing a great number of my works in this booke named my Challenge, that after my death shalbe witnesses they were mine owne dooings: not for any great matter in them, but for the iustnes of troth and true triall of all my honest exercises, and so to purchase cre∣dit and the more freends and fauourers to prop vp my poore reputation: I not only dedicate this booke (and all therein) to your honor, but haue made also in the same booke diuers de∣dications to sundry honorable and worshipfull personages, protesting that there is nothing heerein but came from mine owne deuice, which inuencions (spoken as becomes me) shal be in all honest sorte defended by pen or any way I may to the vttermost of my breath or abilitie, ioying much (with all gladnes of hart) that they are presented to so honourable a personage and one of such singuler learning, whose worth and value by a worthy and vertuous Princes is seene into, and throwly considered of, which gracious Queene hath al∣waies made her princely choice in such an excellent and vn∣speakable maner, as God himselfe should deuinely appoint and direct to our great wealth and his great glory: and in whose rre commendation all the pen men of the world may write. Now good sir vnder your excellent fauour and coun∣tenance, I shielde my presumption and boldenes, that hath offred a booke of so many discourses, to the iudgement of such a multitude that quickly can discouer the weakenes of my labors: but hauing ventured so farre as to publishe them in print, I must now of necessitie commit them to the com∣mon opinion of the world. So in hope the best will fall out, I present you with my studies and take leaue of your honor, desiring of God what goodnes can be wished, to be alwaies at your commaundement.
