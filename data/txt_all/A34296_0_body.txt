My LORD,
I Humbly entreat your LORDSHIP to throw an eye upon these few Papers I have written about the Congress at the Hague, upon the eager sollici∣tations of some worthy persons of my acquaintance, who being curious to

know what had past there, were not per∣haps left at liberty to consider how unca∣pable I was either to refuse, or to satisfy them, especially in so nice a Language, as the English; for I am afraid that by some uneasie Words, and by some struggling Expressions, it will be easily discovered that I am a Stranger to that Language, and consequently I run the hazard to be thought a Stranger to the Subject too. In fine, I am between fear and hopes; and I humbly beseech your LORDSHIP to redeem me from that pain. If your LORDSHIP can persuade your self to be∣gin to read this little Book, and if you do not throw it away before you have finisht it, that will be an infallible sign of my success; and your bare indiffe∣rency will do me more Honour, than the applauding-Praises of an infinite num∣ber of others. And in this case, I

humbly desire your LORDSHIP to present it to Her Majesty; to tell Her that the Author does humbly dedicate it to Her, and that if he has not done it in the usual manner, it is only because he endea∣voured well to manage the profound Re∣spect and Veneration he has for Her Majesty's Sacred Name. I do not que∣stion but Her Majesty will peruse it, seeing it is recommended by so Great a hand; and I shall think my self extream happy to have once in my Life, for one half hour, entertained the most Pious, most Vertuous, and most Beautiful Queen in the World. It is, I confess, a very great presumption in a Foreigner to desire so signal a Favour from the chief Minister of State; but that very Name of Foreigner seems to soften the boldness, and carries with it an Argu∣ment so much received by all Civilized

Nations, that pleads for your generous Patronage. The mighty weight of the publick Affairs, lies indeed very heavy upon you; yet, by reason of your LORD-SHIP's vast Capacity and Courage, you seem still to be able to bear a greater one; you have still some Moments to distri∣bute amongst your Friends and Clients; and I humbly beseech your LORDSHIP to be pleased to receive me amongst the Number of the last. I shall be very careful not to render my self unworthy of that Name; and I intend to make it mybusiness, to convince your LORDSHIP, by all my Thoughts and Actions, That there is no body in the world with more respect and submission, than,
My LORD,
 London, May 5. 1691.
