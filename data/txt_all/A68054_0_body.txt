MADAME:
BEcause there are
not many worthy
such Epithets,
therfore amongst
so few, and those so disper∣sed,
it is not hard for any
man to know you, as well by
your iust titles as by your
Name. Pardon my bold∣nesse,
who owing my best
seruice vnto your vertues,
though not knowing your

person, nor knowne unto you,
vnlesse peraduenture the re∣port
of my disasters haue
come vnto your ares; doe
humbly offer vnto you, what
I am assured, when you vn∣derstand,
(if euer God in∣cline
your heart to the
search, and open your eyes
to the sight thereof) you wil
esteeme as the greatest and
most vnualuable secret,
which amongst all vnder-Moone
things, was euer
imparted and communica∣ted
to man. Your Piety and
Almes deedes, proceeding
from that boundlesse foun∣taine
of burning Charity,
which disperseth it selfe in
all formes, according to the
necessities of the poore, haue
inforced mee to tell the
world, that for you, and such

as you are, I haue caused
these little Bookes to bee
published in our vulgar
English, custome excusing
the most of your sexe from
the knowledge of the lear∣ned
Tongues, in which Ca∣binets,
these secrets are or∣dinarily
locked vp, though
there want not examples of
many women, who, by the
impartiall grace of God,
haue attained to the thing
it selfe. But it is not my
purpose to flatter any body
with the hope of that, which
I well know how rare and
reserued a blessing of the
Almighty it is: Onely, if
you will bee but pleased, by
this occasion, to cast your
eyes vpon that triumphant
Chariot, wherein Nature
rideth through her Minerall

and vnder-earth kingdome,
you will easily see what dif∣ference
there is, between the
plenteous vertues of heauen,
there thrust and crowded vp
together, (as lines though
farre distant in their first
setting foorth from the
Circumference, yet touch∣ing
one another when they
come neere the Center) and
the loose and weake compo∣sition
of Vegetables, which
being of another imposition
of Nature, are not able ei∣ther
to receiue or to hold
such plentie of those hea∣uenly
Spirits, which are the
life of euery Elementary bo∣dy,
no where idle, and there
most abounding where it
seemes most to bee hidden.
For the rest, if any of my
busie vnletter'd Countrey∣men,

who are in great num∣bers,
as bold pretenders to
this blessed Science, as they
are blinde practitioners
therein, shall by the reading
of these Treatises bee per∣swaded
(as I wish they may)
to forbeare the losse of their
time, and the expence of
their monyes, vntill they be
taught by the one of them,
the true matter to worke on,
and by the other, the true
manner of proceeding there∣with;
let them in their hearts
blesse God for you, to whose
noble deserts (that chalenge
a due acknowledgement
from all good men) I haue
paid this small tribute of
my labours. For mine owne
part, the helpe and comfort
which I haue so plenteously
reaped from these studies,

in the middest of many pres∣sures,
which without the ex∣tra-ordinary
assistance of
God, had beene insupport∣able,
hath already made
light and easie in my reso∣lution,
whatsoeuer I shall ei∣ther
doe, or suffer, for God,
or goodmen, or the trueth.
The father of the fatherlesse,
the Iudge of the widdowes,
and the hope of the helpe
lesse, bee to you and yours
ALL THINGS. So prayeth,
