SYR:
TO excuse my selfe for wriâˆ£ting, is the excuse of all Writers: You know it, I omit it. This Sermon was lately preached before you, now printed for you: your intreaty had the one, your command hath the other. Such as it is: it was in the Eares of some, shall be in the Eyes of others, and God grant it may be in the Hearts of all.
