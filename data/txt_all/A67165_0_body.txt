FEW Months are not yet past, from
my presenting Your Majesty an Ac∣count
of this Great Embassy, in the
Italian Tongue; since which, the
importunity of several honourable
Persons, for the having it in English, so far prevail'd, that
there seem'd a kind of necessity, of complying with their
desires.

And before whose Feet could it be more justly
laid, than Your Majesties? and that in a double respect:
The one, in that the former, first appear'd in the World,
under the Patronage, of Her most Serene Highness, The
Late Dutchess of Modena, your most Illustrious Mother;
The other, in that you are not only Heir of Her Vertues,
but so Exquisite a Judge in both Languages.
Nor has it yet been ventur'd on as a Transla∣tion,
but a new Original, with several Alterations, and
Additions to the former (which the streightness of Time
would not then permit) and in that respect also, implores
Your Gracious Acceptance.
But I detain Your Majesty too long: Let not
The Queen be angry, and I'll speak this once: Live Royal
Madam, The Great Example of Your Sex! Live, The Joy
of England, and Eternal Glory of the House of Este!
And since nothing less can add to it, make it yet more
Glorious, in a Prince of Wales.
Your Sacred Majestys
Most Obedient, Devoted,
Loyal Subject, and Humble
Servant,
