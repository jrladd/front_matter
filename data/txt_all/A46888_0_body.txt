THe Scriptures declare of a Man which had an Ʋnclean Spirit, who had his dwelling among the Tombs, and no man could bind him, no not with Chains; because he had been often bound with Chains and Fetters, and the Chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the Fetters broken in pieces; And being dri∣ven of the Devil into the Wilderness, he was so unruly and fierce, tearing his Cloaths, and cutting his Flesh, that no man could tame him: But after the Lord Jesus had healed this poor Crea∣ture, and effected such an extraordinary Change, as caused A∣stonishment and Admiration in the Beholders; for it is said, That when they who had known him before, now saw such a palpable Al∣teration, he that was called Legion Sitting, and Cloathed, and in his Right Mind, they were afraid: and Jesus said unto him, Go home to thy Friends, and tell them how Great Things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had Compassion on thee.
And truly Friends, this day in my Particular is this Scripture fulfilled in your Eyes; my Ʋngodly, Dissolute, Debauched and Extravagant Course of Life hath been known to most of you, when I sinned after strong Convictions, serious Admonitions and Re∣proofs, Vows, Promises and Resolutions, against known Scrip∣ture-Rules, Inward Light and Religious Education, breaking and violating all these Bonds and Obligations (which as so many Chains and Fetters one would think might be sufficient to tame and restrain the unruly Lusts of Youth) whereby the Souls of some of the ten∣derest and chiefest of you have been grieved, exceedingly wounded and exercised, endeavouring and earnestly travelling with Prayers and Tears for my Recovery. Wherefore seeing the Lord hath pas∣sed by me when I was in my Blood, and pittied me, and said unto me, Live; For it was the Lord only who saw my Way, and healed me, and restored Comforts to me and my Mourners by the effectual Calling of his Grace, REVEALING HIS SON IN ME, and hath spared me as a Living Monument of his Patience, Endless Mercy and Compassion: I therefore in the powerful Constrain∣ings of this Love, am unwilling to eat my Morsel alone, or to hide my Talent in the Earth; but with Sampson, having tasted some Sweetness and Strength from the Lord, do commend my Ex∣periences unto you my Friends and Relations, declaring unto you how great Things the Lord hath done for me, and had Compassion on me, in turning me from Darkness into his Marvellous Light, and from the power of Satan into the Kingdom of his dear Son; To whom be Glory, Praise and Obedience for evermore.
