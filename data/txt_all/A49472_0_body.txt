My Lords,
THe Sun affords his comfortable Raies, and Influence upon the lowest Val∣leys, as the loftiest Hills, as well to shrubs, as Cedars; I hope the same from You, who by Divine Good∣nesse are placed such Glorious Lights in our Church and State.
I crave leave to Apologize, in rendring an account, for this Dedication, it is not Presumptuous vain-glory, or Sordid flattery, or Covetous desire of gain that procured it; but first, this Countrey is in some measure come into your possession; secondly, the weighty Actions on foot therein, have been, and are steered, and guided by your prudent Heads, and victorious Armes. Thirdly, this Countrey delineated, is that, in which you have good foot∣ing, and stout Forces: being likely to shake off the Spa∣nish heavy yoke, and acknowledge Obedience to your Civil and Military Commands.
Fourthly, 'tis tendred to your hands as the first fruits of what you will, 'tis hoped, comfortably enjoy: the first fruits have always been favourably accepted of God, and good men.
Lastly, Princes Names, and fames are transmitted to posterity by writing: Scripta manent, and how just it is to have your grave, wise, and Religious Actings regi∣stred with eternal honour, this generation, if not utter∣ly void of reason and conscience, cannot but acknowledge, and succeding Ages reading them, admire.
However should men turn ingrate, ye: God will not forget your labours, but will justifie his Word, that, such as honour him, He will honor; and he hath spoken it, of the righteous, his Name shall be exalted with honour, and the upright shall be had in everlasting re∣membrance, 1 Sam. 2. 30. Psal. 112. 6.
As God hath made this good in our eyes at present upon your persons, so I humbly pray his infinite goodnesse to continue it to your selves, and posterities, even to the perfecting of it in the sight of Men and Angels; for such honour have all his Saints, Psal. 147.
Most Illustrious Lords,
