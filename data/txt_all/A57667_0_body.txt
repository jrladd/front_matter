SIR,
AS Michael and the Devil strove
for the dead body of Moses; and
as seven Cities contested for Ho∣mer
when he was dead, whom
none of them cared for, whilest he lived;
even so doth it fare with Religion; for
the Carkass or Skeliton of which, for the
bare sound whereof (being now made a
meer Eccho, Vox, praetereaque nihil)
there is so much contesting, and digladia∣tion
in the World; whereas few or none
care for the life and substance of Religion,
which consisteth in works, not in words; in
practicing, not in prating; in Scripture du∣ties,
not in Scripture phrases: She is as
our Saviour was, placed between two
Theeves; to wit, Superstition on the right
hand, and Atheism on the left. The one
makes a puppit of her, sets her out in gaudy
accoutrements, bedawbs her native beauty
with painting, and presents her in a meri∣tricious
not in a Matron-like dresse; but
the Atheist strips her naked of her Vesti∣ments,

robs her of her maintenance, and
so exposeth her to the scorn and contempt
of the world. But let these men esteem of
her as they list, she is notwithstanding the
fair daughter of the Almighty, the Queen
of Heaven, and beauty of the whole Earth.
Religion is the sacred Anchor, by which the
the Great Ship of the State is held fast, that
she may not be split upon the Quick-sands
of popular tumults, or on the Rocks of Se∣dition.
Religion is the pillar on which the
great Fabrick of the Microcosm standeth.
All humane Societies, and civil Associa∣tions,
are without Religion; but ropes of
Sand, and Stones without Morter, or Ships
without Pitch: For this cause, all Societies
of men in all Ages, and in all parts of the
Vniverse, have united and strengthened
themselves with the Cement of Religion;
finding both by experience, and the light
of nature, that no human Society could be
durable, without the knowledge and feare
of a Deity, which all Nations do reverence
and worship, though they agree not in the
manner of their worship. All their wayes
and opinions in Religion, I have here pre∣sented
to the publick view; but to you Sir,
in particular, as to one, whom I know to be
truely religious, not being carried away

with the fine flowers and green leaves, but
with the solid fruits of Religion, consisting
in righteousnesse, peace, and holinesse,
without which no man shall see the
Lord; this is that which will embalm your
name here, and crown your soul with true
happiness hereafter, when all humane feli∣cities
shall determin in smoak: in this book
are set before you, light and darknesse, truth
and falshood, gold and drosse, flowers and
weeds, corn and chaff, which I know you
are able to discriminate, and to gather ho∣ney
with the Bee, out of every weed, with
Sampson to take meat out of the eater,
with Virgil to pick gold out of dung, and
with the Physitian to extract antidotes
out of poyson: Thus beseeching God to en∣crease
your knowledge and practice in Re∣ligion,
and your love to the afflicted profes∣sors
thereof, I take leave and will ever be
found
Sir,
