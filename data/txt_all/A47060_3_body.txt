Heroïck Sir!
LOng and earnest have been the de∣sires and prayers of many thousands of faithfull hearts for your safe and happy return
into England, which God for his own glory, your honour, and our comforts, hath now opportunely brought to passe with such testi∣monies of his blessings upon your actions, ma∣nifested by your succes∣ses in his battails, as may be justly terrible to all his, and your Ene∣mies; and truly joyfull to all his servants, and your friends; of whom it is to be feared, that asGod hath but few firm in his election, so you have but few faithull in your assistance. Be plea∣sed therefore that it may be inquired in the As∣sembly, whose promises to your self, and your de∣pendants, whose Votes in publick, and Vowes in private have most wilfully failed you and yours: I shall not pre∣sume to inquire what breaches have bin made of performances in mat∣ters
most nearly concer∣ning you, and your Ar∣mie, best known to your selfe: but what hath been performed of those promises made to you and your Army, for the relieving of your dai∣ly Orators, Prisoners for Debt, wrongfully re∣streined, contrary to Magna Charta, and all the true Laws of the Land, which men sitting in Parliament publickly profess, and have oftensworne to maintein: what ridiculous Acts even those men have made to delude you and your Orators, their own and all Gods people, to cross those Laws more than before, and to sup∣port their extortions, & mercenarie practices in all the waies of Iuju∣stice, in an higher mea∣sure than their Predeces∣sors: what Justice can be expected from such Justicers? what merciecan bee exspected from God to continue upon that Land that shall suf∣fer such Mountibanck-mock-lawes to live, much more to sit, and be Legis-lators amongst them? oh! let such buy∣ers & sellers of Law and Justice be thrown out of the Temple, and the House of the Lord be purged of such abomi∣nations. The valiant and Religious Patriot Collonel Pride (in yourabsence) indeavoured to work some proportion of grace into those men, to foresee and prevent their owne confusion; but the Adders would not hear: O make them (Sir!) make these subtile Serpents innocent a∣gainst their wills; un∣sting them, unskin them; for their Cases are far more precious than their Carkases. I have here following demon∣strated their uselessnessin this Common∣wealth? which may it please your Honor to peruse at your leisure, protect in your favour, correct in your wis∣dome, and act in your Justice; so God shall fur∣ther prosper you & your posteritie, the Common∣wealth honor you and them, and with the rest of your Orators, and theirs, I shall bee ever yours to Command du∣ring life,
