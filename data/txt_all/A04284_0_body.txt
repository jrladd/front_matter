WHen the watchman (Right Worshipfull) said to Dauid, The running of the foremost is like the running of Ahi∣maaz; then the King said, He is a good man, and commeth with good tidings. Now I would it could at this time be truely testified of me, in both particulars: but it may not; it cannot. For I am like to him that addeth fewel to the flame; rubbeth a greene wound; or that presents, before the eye, some fearefull, and to-be forgotten obiect. The tidings I bring, are like the Amalekites to Dauid; Iosephs brethren to Iacob; or Ionah his Sermon to the Niniuites: Notwith∣standing, beare with me, for I cannot helpe it: It's God that did it; and good vse may be made of it.
Wee must all fall in the wildernesse of this
