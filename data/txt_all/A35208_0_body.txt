Good Brother,
IT hath ever been the Ambition of Writers to climb as
high as they can to an Honourable Patronage, even to
Heaven it self, if the Nobility of the subject might autho∣rize
the Presumption; Now Poets, rankt (especially by the
more earthly part of the World) amongst the most airy of
Pen-men, are priviledg'd by common Opinion to soar up
with the Highest: But my present Obligations instruct me
to the contrary. As Loyalty was the Muse inspir'd this
Poem; so Love shall appoint the Dedication. Though
my weak Muse hath sometimes borrowed the expeditious
Aids of the Presse, yet not till now appeared in publick:
As she never knew the triumphs of Fame, so she never felt
the blushes of Dishonour, was never injurious to any per∣son
but her self. But in this subject, Secresy had been
a kind of Combination, Privacy a privative Treason; so
ill do clandestine joyes become an universall Jubilee. That
I come behind in the reare of our Poetique Forces, must
be imputed to some unkind contingencies; my thoughts be∣ing
conceived with the first, but by some misprisions met

with hard labour from the midwifry of the Press. Never∣thelesse,
it will be honour enough for me, if I may have leave
to wait upon (as their obsequious shadows) the heroick Poems
of those 3. Seraphims, Waller, Cowly, & Lluellin, whose
sudden march alarum'd both Ʋniversities. Mine, if they
come not too early, will come soon enough to blush. But in
earnest, I must thank the Presse for a second benefit, besides
the manifestation of my Allegiance, that it furnisheth me
with a kind occasion of acknowledging unto the ungrate∣full
world, even in Print, the many kindnesses I have recei∣ved
from so good a Brother. In fine, You, whose Heart and
Sword so long maintained the Royal Cause, are obliged
to protect the Heraulds of it Accept therefore, Good Bro∣ther,
(which compellation I prefer before all Titles) accept
of this Poem (whose onely merit is its Subject) as a mark
of Loyalty to my Prince, and as a Token of my Love to
your self, from
