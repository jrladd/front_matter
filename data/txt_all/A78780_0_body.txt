My Lord,
I Cannot forget, nor yet
forbear gratefully to re∣cognizance
that most
kind and noble violence
your Lordship vouchsaf'd
to practise upon me in a
foreign Country, where the
guilt of many years undeser∣ved
exile had rendred me
morosely jealous of all that
had more lately breathed

in English air; and the con∣science
of discharging faith∣fully
my duty in that trust,
which with much affection,
and obligation, was com∣mitted
to me, had made
me somewhat obstinate in
my retirement, and half a
Separatist from Conversati∣on,
what honour or advan∣tage
soever might be ob∣tained
by it, until your
Lordships more than graci∣ous
condescention had rais'd
my blush at what before I
esteem'd my vertue; and
your more than peremptory
Commands forced me to
the honourable fruition of

that happiness, whereof I
should have been most am∣bitious,
in a near aquain∣tance
with your excellencies,
such as I confess unfeigned∣ly,
I more admired upon
my experience, and infal∣lible
observation, than I
could have credited upon the
most authentick character
might have been given me
by any whom your Lord∣ship
earlier admitted to that
discovery which had no
veil: all which, though I
must not here enumerate to
affected minutes; nor wind
up, though without slat∣tery,
to the strain of reproach▪

yet there are three I shall not
omit to instance, if to no
other purpose, at least (which
implies no doubt) to oblige
your Lordship to perseve∣rance,
the apostasie from each
being no less desperate, than
frequent; and that from
one or two, sometime so
countenanced or rewarded,
as it has almost the impu∣dence
to plead merit, which
should beg a pardon; and to
expect to have what should
be most abhorred, and dete∣sted,
either imitated, or com∣mended.
The first, my Lord, was
your conscientious and ear∣nest

care to be better satis∣fied
in the grounds and rea∣son
of that Religion, which
you did, and were most in∣clinable
to profess, and pra∣ctise,
when most persecuted
and depressed; and, this ef∣fected,
your humble and
obsequious resignation to
the Canon of our Church, and
that in some particulars,
wherein few persons, ever
prejudiced, have been coun∣selable;
and such as were
not, thought unnecessary▪
or, because of desuetude, im∣proper
to be observed.
The second, was your
Lordships generous and loy∣al

resolution, in a time dif∣ficult
to be taken, and no
less dangerous to be owned,
to adventure life, upon any
reasonable and justifiable oc∣casion
at an age, but then
mature for the gust of world∣ly
pleasures; and a noble
Estate, into the possession
whereof you were but newly
entered, whensoever both,
or either, might be hop'd
effectual toward the restitu∣tion
of your banished, and
every way injured King;
wherein although your
Lordship are most happily
prevented by the powerfull
hand of Heaven, which,

without humane assistance,
has over-rul'd the change;
and, by some sweeter influ∣ence
than that of a Marial
star, hath softened the most
obdurate hearts of aged Re∣bels
to a capacity of peace, and
the impression of allegiance
to their Prince that brought
it home to their doors, with
so much clemency, and such
munificence, as scarcely has
been, or ere will be paral∣lel'd,
if Posterity should
play the wanton in bloud for
the like reward: yet I can∣not
but erect upon that sin∣cerity
of your intention
(which I humbly crave your

leave, without arrogance,
thus publickly to attest) a
Monument of Honour to your
Lordships name and person,
unto which I wish all the
indulgence of Royal favour,
that can be expected, or
may be hoped from Him,
who is more likely to be
endowed with Power, and
Plenty, answerable to the
greater objects He has for
Royal bounty, and more cau∣ses
for sumptuous Magnifi∣cence
and State, than ever had
any of our preceding Britan∣nike
Kings.
The third was your most
intent and affectionate en∣deavour

(in the privacy you
could possibly reconcile to
the eminence of your Honour,
and the importunity of that
Nation) to recover what the
malignity of Times, ac∣companied
with an inveig∣ling
discouragement to all
select and exquisite Studies,
had in part deprived you of,
and wherein you had been
prevented, to improve your
knowledg to a degree worthy
your high birth and fortune,
and necessary to the future
interest you may have in af∣fairs
of State, and Regency
of your Country: unto which
by the ascendent prompt∣ness

of your Lordships parts,
and faculties, such your
quickness of apprehension, vari∣ety
of fancy, solidity of judg∣ment,
tenacity of memory, and
all else that Nature could fur∣nish
(as if in design) you
might easily have attained,
and may yet, the sphear of
science you have in your
aim, if your engagements
otherwise could leave you
free for that steady method,
and those early hours, which
you were prone, my Lord,
most exemplarily to observe,
as also for the choyce of a
person qualified with learn∣ing,
loyalty, prudence, and

integrity, for that your Lord∣ships
service and assistance,
and such a one, whensoever
you find him, I dare assure,
will be as much obliged by
the singular ingenuity and pe∣culiar
sweetness of your Lord∣ships
disposition; as by the
nobleness of your entertain∣ment,
to advance your pur∣pose.
For so much, or so little, as
you were pleas'd, my Lord,
to make me concerned in it,
when you found me other∣wise
imploy'd abroad, I con∣fess
I never was more satis∣fied
in any thing of like
nature, than when I could

suggest at any time what
won upon your opinion, or
would be of improvement
to your studies in the use. Nor
was I thus affected only
while your stay was on
the other side; but easily
induced to promise, and ear∣nest
enough to performe, some
part of the same duty after
your Lordships departure
thence.
The Collection I at present
dedicate with much assu∣rance,
unto your Honour,
I am not now to certifie
you, was first attempted,
in compliance with your
Lordships kindness for such

Maximes, and Corollaries, and
sententious Brevets, which
by ordinary observation, and
less considerable essayes, I
had sufficiently discovered:
and when you please to re∣member
how much you ex∣pressed
your self transported
with the first sheets I sent
you over, you will not
wonder that the little ma∣nual,
I first intended, is be∣come
a Volume; that I have
reviewed and passed beyond
the principal Book, to a
general survey of all the
Writings I hear of published
in the name of that most
Wise, and now, indeed, by

the merit of his intellectual,
and moral; Christian, and
Regal; active and passive
vertues, most Glorious King.
The benefit I mean you by
it, my Lord, is not only the
too-late-admiring the super∣excellency
of that Royal Soul,
which was the Casket of such
Jewels, the Treasury of such
divine and humane Wisdom,
as if He had been heir of all
the concealed riches of this
sort, that had been amass'd
forVid. H. Grot. ad cap. 1. Proverb. Solomon, or since
for the whole suc∣cession
of Emperours
among the Greeks; Nor to
give you some short diver∣sion

between the periods of
your Studies, or stages of
your Lordships most serious
and urgent business; but your
modelling and forming by
it, at your choicest and se∣verest
hours, a Christian Ca∣non
both for a practick and
contemplative holy life; a
litle Rationale of the Doctrine
and Discipline of that Church,
into the Communion whereof,
(after an unavoidable con∣flict,
and intrinsic contesta∣tion,
with the importunity
of Presbyterian, Independent,
Anabaptistical, and other fal∣lacies,
the principles of all
which Sects and Heresies had

been for many years lowdly
sounded by the Trumpet of a
bloudy Rebellion in your Lord∣ships
ears) with how much
devout affection, with what
profess'd satisfaction, and re∣solution
you know, you en∣ter'd;
The best Exemplar and
fairest Copy that was ere pre∣sented
unto the Princes, and
Great Peers of the World, for
regulating their Councels,
Words, and Actions, by Con∣science,
Reason, Honour; for
your abominating all Sacri∣ledg,
as that which would
be the Cancer no less of your
Soul, than your Estate; chu∣sing
rather, if put upon it,

to part with your inheritance,
than with so much breath as
may form your vote to the
prophaning and sequestring,
what the religious Charity of
your Ancestors dedicated to
pious uses; of adhering inse∣parably
to the Holy Order of
Episcopacy, never questioned
by any, but such Wretches,
as had desperately plunged
themselves into either He∣resie,
Schisme, Sacriledg, or
Rebellion; A Caveat, never
to make the counterfeit of
religious zeal, serve the pur∣pose
of Ambition; nor to tor∣ture
your King's Conscience,
under a pretence to ease your

own; A Monitory, how much
the prudence of Nobles may
fix a due temperament in the
Commons, as likewise how
their chief interest consists
in their fidelity to the Crown,
not in their ignoble compli∣ance
with any factious Party
of the People. A perpetual
Memorial of the affronts and
injuries done to so excellent a
King, no otherwise now to
be repaired and recompen∣sated,
than by paying and ex∣acting
all possible duty and al∣legiance,
accumulating all
honour, and state, and wealth,
that each one can contribute
to his Royal Successour, who,

it may be hoped, will per∣severe
in the happy govern∣ment
of his Nations, accord∣ing
to the incomparable
Maxims of piety and policy, that
are scattered in those sacred
Oracular books and papers,
composed not according to
Plato's Ideas, or other specu∣lative
conceits and fancies, but
out of Divine emanations, by
what means, in what man∣ner,
instilled, need not be
enquired; out of the various
alternate experiments of a flou∣rishing
and fading condition,
a calm and stormy season of his
Reign; a quiet, and scrupu∣lous,

a self-clearing, and some∣times,
a self-condemning, dis∣position
of Conscience; the
sense of love and loyalty from
some, of Rebellion and malice
from other of his Subjects;
the several events from pru∣dent
results, and mistakes, in
his Councel; the flattery and
folly, the sincerity and sapience,
in the diversity of his Nobles;
the learning and ignorance, zeal
and moderation, luke-warmness
and absolute coldness, in his
Clergy; the steady resolution
and giddiness of his Commons;
the courage and cowardise, the
conscientious care and negligence

of his Sldiers; the liberty and
restraint, the entredeux or state
of indifference, such as may
be call'd the Royal durance, or
free Imprisonment of his per∣son;
the apprehensions of a
violent death, and hope of a
kind reconciling deliverance;
finally, such variety of all
sorts in Himself and others,
that were, or should have
been under His Majesties Do∣minion,
that no Prince of
like natural endowments, of
so just and pious inclinati∣ons,
had such Religious, Ci∣vil,
and Military advantages,
to raise such a fabrick of Po∣licy

and Religion, such a stru∣cture
of Lawes and Counsells,
of secur'd assertions, and
weigh'd experiments, as by
which not only the Princes
and People of our age, at
whose ports and Palaces the
rumours and terrours of our
Troubles have arriv'd; but all
Posterity may prevent, if they
please to regard and practise
whatsoever misery and mis∣chief
the infernal Spirits of
Discord and Confusion, may in∣tend
them.
All these, my Lord, and
many more (which I leave
to your own discovery) be∣ing

the natural issue of emo∣lument
from the book; my
advice is, that you would
improve and multiply them
in each particular, by your
Lordships reading, and hear∣ing,
and observing, applying
to each Oracle or Apharism,
here presented, whatsoever
may occur, relating with
any significancy, unto it,
whether in ancient or modern
History; in the Policy of our
own or other Nations; in the
Relations and Discourses of
wise and understanding
men; in the practises right
or wrong, of any whom∣soever

your Lordship may
have reason and opportu∣nity
to regard. This done,
my Lord, and ought else
your Lordship may see ne∣cessary,
if after some few
years resolution, I have the
honour to kiss your hand, I
shall expect, with much
confidence, your Lordships
thanks, which I desire not be∣fore
you shall have reapt the
profit of my pains; and be∣come
sensible of the service
done you by this Collection
(how affectedly indigested
soere it be) toward the re∣gulating
your Life; whether

in publick imployment, or
private conversation; toward
the confirming you in the
still-opposed, still undermi∣ned,
Religion of our Church;
toward your conduct of any
Government, or Command, you
may have in your Country,
and your influence upon the
well or ill-affected People
there; toward the honour may
be, I hope, conferred upon
you, for promoting the in∣terest
of the Crown to the ve∣ry
uttermost extent and effi∣cacy
of your own: and after
all, above all toward your re∣ward
in heaven, for your de∣votion

to God, and fidelity to
your King, which no man
wisheth you, with more af∣fectionate
unfeigned zeal,
than,
My Lord,
 From my Friends
Lodgings, in
Doctor's Com∣mons.
