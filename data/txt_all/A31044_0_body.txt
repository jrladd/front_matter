My Lord,
WHen I had the ho∣nour
to attend
your Lordship in
your Embassy to the States of
Venice, it was my fortune

there to meet with a small Piece,
entituled Viaggio Pittoresco
d'Italia, the Task being of no
very great difficulty, and alto∣gether
agreeable to my own in∣clination,
I have gratified my
self; and I hope not disobliged
ingenious Artists in a faithful
rendition of it into English;
which I have done the rather
because the Book is rarely to
be found in Italy, and I can∣not
remember I have seen any
Original in England but that
which is in my own hands. I

have taken courage to prefix
your Lordships honourable name
to this Translation to render it
acceptable to the world, under
the Patronage of an acurate
Judge, and a zealous lover
and encourager of the noble Art
of Painting. If it may serve
to put your Lordship in mind of
the pleasure you received by a
personal view and admiration
of those great Masters elaborate
Pieces when your Lordship
was abroad; and in any mea∣sure
testifie my desires to serve

your Lordship, 'tis the greatest
Honour and satisfaction can be
wished for, or is attainable by,
My LORD,
