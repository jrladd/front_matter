May it please Your Grace,
AFter so many Honourable Titles (some due to you by Inheritance, some given you by your Prince his Favour, All Your own, besides that of Your Virtue and Loyalty, which is Your greatest Character) it might justly be ex∣pected, that some Considerable thing (something more than an Ordinary Ser∣mon) should be presented to Your Noble Patronage: and I have only this to say in my Excuse, that it comes from the hands of him, who has nothing Great enough to lay at Your Feet. My Lord, I am bound to tell You, that the reason of Publishing these Papers, is my own Vindication; some Passages therein being so mis-re∣presented, as if I had made several Rude

and Unjust Reflections; from which no∣thing can clear me, but the submitting of the whole Sermon to Publick Cen∣sure.
And now, My Lord, I cannot blame that Necessity, which obligeth me at once to do my self Right, and to express my Duty to Your Grace, whom I am bound to Honour particularly, not only for the sake of the same Loyal Principles, but also in the Bond of Natural Affection, which is no more than a Just and Necessa∣ry Homage from me.
I most humbly beg Your Favourable ac∣ceptance of this my Duty, beseeching God to Bless Your Grace, and Your Noble Consort, with a long Continuance of the Dearest Love, with a Noble Train of a most Prosperous Issue, and with all the Blessings of This world and a Better: it is the Hearty desire, my Lord, of
 Sept. 13. 1683.
