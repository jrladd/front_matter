RIght vertuous and woorthily worshipfull, after I had spent some yeares past in this kinde, the most vnprofitable and vnpleasant studie of searching words for a Dictionarie, in such sort, Vt nec tem∣pori, nec rei familiari, nec mihi parcerem: but Come la candela, far' ben' a gli altri & male a mi stesso; with the candle to light others, and burne out my selfe: at last looking backe to repentance, I be∣ganne to addresse my endeuours to some good happe, and founde you among many as fower principall pillars that haue supported my declining estate, and giuen life by your liberalities to my dying pen. Wherefore I thinke reason biddeth, nay dutie rather bindeth, or your due challengeth, what I presume heere to dedicate. And although each of you deserue much more then euer my abilitie will bee able to reach vnto, yet according to the common custome of badde debters, I deuide my substance, desiring my creditors euerie one to take his part. If any cauill about the number of fower; let him bee ad∣uertised, There be fower elements placed in the world: likewise fower seasons in the yeere: also fower humors that possesse the bodie; and fower vertues that shoulde gouerne the minde: and you fower principall corner stones to support the building of this present worke, without which it could not haue yet beene finished: Wherefore let the honour be yours, and the labour mine. When I had waded so farre in it, as without helpe I could not get ouer, nor without dan∣ger and shame returne backe: then did you curteous entertainer of vertue, right woorthie and valorous sir Iohn Scot, of your owne good nature, bountie, and kindnes (the like whereof in one person is hardly to be matched) plaie the Vnicorne for the rest to drinke. Next you curteous and vertuous sir Henry Bromley, louer and liberall to all good letters, whose purse and paines is alwaies open for your Prince and countrie; so is it neuer shut to the aduancement of vertue, who as you are endued with an excellent memorie, and well read in all kind of learning, so are you a true Mecaenas of learning and vertue, and a bountifull benefactour to the same, as sundrie schollers at the vniuersitie (some whereof at your owne charge you maintaine) can better testifie. You the third,

not second to any, well accomplisht and woorthie knight, sir Edward Greuel, beloued in the court, and honored in the countrie, among the great, great, and ouermatching your equals with the greatnes of your bright shining ver∣tues, giue exceeding cause to all, especially to me, not to forget the honor of your name: for who knoweth not that knoweth you, that the fower cardinall vertues, vpon which the rest doe depend, haue their aboundant influence in∣to your minde. Last, you the mirror of a good minde, right vertuous Master William Fort Escu, for all vertuous actions and goodnes, a strong shielde as your name in French doth import; whose right honorable father endued with singular memorie, learning, and excellent vertues, (by which especiallie he hath beene aduanced) in those gifts of the minde you succeed and follow: haue bound me by your bountie and exceeding curtesies to make some pub∣like testimonie of the same. But what go I about to decipher that which is im∣possible sufficiently to be set downe, and to praise them whose peeres as yet I haue not found, whose many qualities and exceeding vertues do so farre sur∣mount the greatest parte of men, as the glorious sun with his bright beames the lesser celestiall bodies: whereof for me to speake with condigne praises, is a thing more due to your deserts, then easie for my rude pen, and rather ap∣pertaineth to my dutie, then standeth with my abilitie: but as the French saith, Bonne volonté supplie a la faculté: if your worships receiue me and my meaning with that vertue which is woont to be in you, I shall not onely be encouraged hereafter, but others will labour to honor you for this example. And herewith I do most humblie and faithfully commend vnto you my selfe and these my labors with an vnfained hart, and humble deuotion, to be commanded as best pleaseth you: Whom God long keepe and preserue to your Prince, countrey, and friendes.
