as yours will be in Pardoning this first Attempt: And where may Services well meant, hope Forgiveness, if not in your Honourable Family, which, as it has always met, and deserv'd, Honour from the Supreme Fountain of Honour; so those who've had De∣pendance on You, have in their pro∣per Stations found its kinder Influ∣nce? And I beg your Lordship would permit me own my self what I really am,
