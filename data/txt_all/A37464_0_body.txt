My Lord,
SInce my late Lord Warrington your Father trusted me with the care of your Education, your Lordship has made so great a Progress in all things which I Taught you, that I am now forced to procure you another Tutor: You are become in a little time a great Master of several Languages, and most parts of Philo∣sophy, and I may say without flatte∣ry,
that your Lordship hath Genius, Learning and Piety enough to make one of the Best and the most Accom∣plish't Gentleman in England: But yet your Quality requires something more; for it is not enough for one in your Lordships High Station to be Humanist, Geographer, Histo∣rian, (and I may add) a good Man too; he must be also a States-man, and a Politician; but being neither, my self I must repeat the same thing over again to my Shame, and to your Credit, that your Lordship wants a better Master. Amongst several of the most Eminent Men which I could recommend to your Lordship, I found none so Learned, nor indeed so fit to make deep Impressions upon your Mind as your Lordships Noble Father, whose Writings belongs to you as well as his Estate; I don't doubt but you will strive to get the
best share of his Learning; nor can you fail of an Extream Delight by drawing Sciences but of the same Spring from whence your Noble Blood did flow. His Book then be∣ing yours both by Inheritance, and by the particular gift of its Authour, it would be unjust to present it to any other but your Lordship; and needless to recommend it, or beg your acceptance for't: Therefore omitting any longer Preface, in Re∣commendation of these Golden Re∣mains, I'll only take leave to make this Observation upon them, That as there is nothing wanting in them for your Lordship's Instruction both by Humane Learning and Solid De∣votion, I have fitted you with the Master that I look't for, and whom you wanted: From whom having obtained all the Qualifications which your Noble Soul is capable of;
you have no more to wish for, but that you may live and practice 'em; and it will be to me both a great Sa∣tisfaction and Honour to see my Work finisht by the same Artist who put it first into my hands, and trusted me with the beginning of it. It will be enough for me that I have put my hands to such a Master-piece, and shall be highly honoured if your Lordship take notice of my Endea∣vours, and sufficiently Rewarded if you grant your Protection to him who has no other Ambition than to be,
