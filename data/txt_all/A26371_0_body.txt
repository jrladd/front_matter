SIR,
I Do not here imploy your Name either to rescue these Papers from con∣tempt, or to raise in the Reader an expectation of meeting in them something fit to be offer'd to such a Personage; but out of great assurance that your Honour will rea∣dily grant them your Protection, as beeing honestly designed for the Vindi∣cation of that Order of Men, toward
whom your Respects are constantly ma∣nifested; and through the sides of whose Contempt both Church and State have ever received their deepest Wounds.
If by this short Discourse I may serve God and the Truth, I have my End: but shall think my Return full of Reward, if Your Honour shall please to approve thereof, and give me par∣don for the Address.
That you may long live to be un∣der Our Gracious Soveraign, an hap∣py Instrument of Peace and Prospe∣rity to this Church and Nation, is the hearty Prayer of,
