THrice noble and my gracious Lord, the loue I haue euer borne to the illustrious house of Bedford, and to the honourable familie of the Harringtons, to the which by marri∣age your Lordship is happily united, hath long since deuoted my true and zealous affection to your ho∣nourable seruice, and my Poems to the protection of my no∣ble Lady, your Countesse: to whose seruice I was first be∣queathed, by that learned and accomplished Gentleman, Sir Henry Goodere (not long since deceased,) whose I was whilst he was: whose patience, pleased to beare with the im∣perfections of my beedlesse and vnstaied youth. That excel∣lent and matchlesse Gentleman, was the first cherisher of my Muse, which had been by his death left a poore Orphane to the worlde, had hee not before bequeathed it to that Lady whom he so deerly loued. Vouchsafe then my deere Lord to accept this Epistle, which I dedicate as zealously, as (I hope) you will patronize willingly, vntill some more acceptable ser∣uice may be witnes of my loue towards your honour.
Your Lordships euer,
