SIR,
WHEN Mr. Boyle, with my
Partners, and my self attended
Your Majesty with the Experi∣ment
of Reducing Salt Water
into Fresh; Your Majesty seem'd so well
pleased with an Invention of that Ʋni∣versal
Benefit, that we cannot but with our
Humblest Duty acknowledge Your Gracious
Reception of it; However, as Your Great
Wisdom and Judgment is not easie to be
surpriz'd, and Your Royal Approbation ne∣ver
known to be Your hasty Act of Grace;

Your Favour and Patronage was not fully
obtain'd, till with the strictest Scrutiny you
had first examin'd those Hopes and Proba∣bilities,
you vouchsaf'd to incourage in Ʋs.
But, when upon jurther consideration, We
had obviated all Difficulties, and solv'd all
Objections against this Ʋndertaking, (which
We hope will appear in this Printed Paper,)
Your Majesty was Graciously pleas'd to give
us your Approbation, and to order us your
Letters Patents; which Grace and Favour
ought to be, and is receiv'd by Ʋs with the
deepest sense of our humble Acknowledg∣ments
and Gratitude.
And if the Fruits of your Royal Grant
has not hitherto been deriv'd to Ʋs, 'tis
partly by some Obstacles we met from the
suggestions of a private Person, but more
especially by the late Horrid Conspiracy,
when, not only our Loyal Apprehensions
for your Majesties Danger, diverted our
Thoughts from all other Concerns, but like∣wise
we judged it a part of our Duty not
to be pressing on your Majesties Goodness,
or on your Ministers of State, in so Impor∣tant
a juncture of Affairs: But having now

regained Leisure and Fredom, after the
dissipation of the greatest part of our Fears,
We presume a second time to lay these En∣deavours
at your Feet, as best Entituled
to the Patronage of so great an Ʋnderta∣king
by your own Subjects, and best able
to Recommend it to the World by your Roy∣al
Approbation.
This Experiment is in a great degree
owing to the Eminent Mr. Boyle, and in∣deed
well worthy so Ingenious a Promoter
being so much the more the Favorite of his
happy Genius, as it is Ʋniversally useful to
Mankind; But whatever Advantages this
Country, or indeed the World, may receive
by it, his whole Ambition is bounded in the
publick. Profit, contenting himself with no
other Benefit from it, than the satisfaction
and pleasure of seeing it accomplish'd by his
Friends.
The Advantages in regard to Navigati∣on,
especially in long Voyages, which are
subject (through often Calms, and on se∣veral
other accounts,) to distress for want
of Water, and the Benefits to Sea-Towns;
which are incommodated by Brackish Wa∣ters,

Together with the Easiness, Cheapness,
and Wholsomness of this prepared Water,
are the principal scope of these ensuing Pa∣pers,
which are Humbly Dedicated to Your
Majestys Perusal, Favour, and further Ap∣probation,
by
