SIR,
I Would scarce have ad∣ventured the Publishing of the following Sheets, if after a particular and care∣ful
Perusal you had not been pleased to Advise and Encourage me to it; and I desire the Favour of pre∣fixing your Name to them, that the World may know your Approbation, which will sufficiently secure me from Censure, and recom∣mend them as containing something Exact and Ʋse∣ful: for your Skill and Judgment in this Subject is well known, and abun∣dantly demonstrated by those Treatises with which
you have obliged the World, and the Publick Lectures, by which you have adorned the Honourable and Ʋseful Office you have held for se∣veral Years. But yet I am not so Vain as to think there are no Slips nor Errours in this little Treatise, nor will I impose so far upon your Goodness and Civility as to expect your Patronage of them. I only hope, that after your Example, others will be so Candid and Civil as to pass them over.

I do also readily accept of this Occasion, to pay my most hearty Acknowledg∣ments for your private Fa∣vours and Civilities. And as I have a true Esteem for your Merits, so I shall be always ready to shew my self,
