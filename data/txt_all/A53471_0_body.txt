My Lord,
THE greatness of Your Lordships favours conferred on me since the first of your Honours acquaintance with my poor self, hath obliged me from time to time to consider of some return; and upon due consideration I find, that it is next to an impossibility for me to perform that to Your Lordship, to which the Laws of Duty and Respect ob∣lige me; yet, My Lord, I thought it my Duty, (although my Returns will appear inconsiderable) not to omit any oppor∣tunity of making my Just acknowledgments. All good men have highly resented Your Lordships Favour to me in this Great Affair: And the whole Kingdom judgeth it self en∣gaged to Your Lordship for standing by its Evidence and Cause; to the great Confusion of the Romish Beast, and those that wonder after it: from all which I conclude, that it becomes me to make to your good Lordship some Ex∣pression of my Gratitude: And although, My Lord, it be in me a great boldness to make this Address to your good Lord∣ship, yet for all that, since I have Your Lordships Counte∣nance,
I pray your Favour and your Patronage for this poor Piece: In the Publication of which, by many Reviews and Remarks, I have been at some pains; and now, My Lord, it is upon the Travel, Your Lordships Countenance may beget the Countenances of many more Persons of Ho∣nour; so that I may not to all intents and purposes be discou∣raged in this War that I have vowed to make against the Whore and Dragon of Rome, and all her Votaries, as long as I have a day to live; and will, to the utmost of my power, discover her Cheats and Villanies.
My Lord, this Tract is a Catalogue of the Romish Lies and Cheats, many of which are, to mine own knowledge, maintained and practised to this day in the Romish Syna∣gogue, to the great Dishonour of God, and Contempt of Chri∣stian Religion; great occasion being given by such inordi∣nate practices, to the Enemies (both Jews and Turks) of Jesus Christ, to Blaspheme our Holy Profession; so that if Your Lordship shall persevere in this good work of opposing this Devilish Interest of Rome, to its ruine, you may be an happy Instrument, under God, to preserve this Kingdom from its Superstition, Idolatry and Tyranny: And Your Lordship may remember what pains Your Honour hath taken, whilst in place, to suppress it, and the growing Greatness of that French Tyrant; for the which, Your Lordship hath abun∣dantly drank of the Cup of Afflictions, which you may as∣sure your self hath redounded highly to your Honour in this your Countrey: Therefore may it please Your Lordship to continue your Care and Zeal for the securing of the Pro∣testant
and English Interest, to the Honour of God, the Safety, Welfare and Advantage of our King and His Kingdoms, then Your Lordship may assure your self of a lasting Repute in this Life, and of Peace at your Death, and a joyful Resurrection to the World to come. As for Apostates and Traytors, though they flatter themselves; and for their own Applause, suffer Parasites and Hypocrites to do the like, yet they are the Objects of good mens Scorn and Contempt; and will certainly, without true Repen∣tance, of which, God knows, there is but little hope, suffer the Vengeance of God upon them and their Posterities in this Life, and Eternal Vengeance in the next; and though Your Lordship hath not had one Popish Mass said for the preservation, either of your Body or your Soul, or both, yet it is not to be questioned, but that Your Lordship will grow as great in the Esteem of your Country, and in the Favour of your God; and greater than he, who for the Safety of his Per∣son, hath had above One Hundred Thousand: And though Your Lordship, I believe, never bestowed one Farthing for a small quantity of Romish Reliques, I question not, but your Name and Fame will endure to the end of the World, when his, that gave 600 l. to Endow and Adorn an Altar with stores of such stuff, shall Perish: Yet this fowl Mon∣ster goeth for a Protestant; and I suppose, and verily believe, he is permitted so to do by a 'Dispensation from those Dogs, whom he hath suffered to devour the Childrens bread. My Lord, I crave Your Lordships Pardon for this my boldness, which I protest, is out of the sincerity of my heart to Your Lordship, and it is because I do ear∣nestly
desire your Honours welfare; and in order to this, I will not cease my humble Addresses to Heaven in the behalf of Your Lordship and Family; and so concluding, I hum∣bly take leave to subscribe my self,
My Lord,
