LIke to a Young Student in
Negromancy, whose Itch to
Rarity makes him Attempt
the raising what hee wants
skill to lay, I have adventured in this lit∣tle
Common-wealth of Poetry to beget
some Distractions that cannot be recon∣cil'd
without your Patronage. Sir, you
have the fame for Piety and Love to
your Country, and have so equally bal∣lanced
your Actions in these distemper'd
times, that you have not only Merited
the title Apollo gave to Socrates, but

drawn all mens eies, Loves, and admira∣tion
upon you. Amongst the number
of which your honourers, A Stranger
tenders his offering; And though it is
naked of worth, Yet the Property of
your acceptance will be shelter sufficient
to it, and him, who, next to your par∣don,
shall endeavour to deserve the title
of
Sir,
