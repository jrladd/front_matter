AS it pleased god of his prouident purpose in his mercie to call mee (your poore kinsmā) to that notable place and honourable Au∣dience at Paules Crosse, to sound forth the word of his Grace, whiche in the simplicitie of my soule, I carefullye there deliuered: So his wisedome hath further vsed the godlye, and of good iudgement, (and not a fewe) to drawe from me my promisse, to profite hys people further abroad, by the same his holye worde in the office of this my
 willing pen: whiche laboure of mine therein, I haue (by the Lordes good∣nesse) now so faithfully here set down, as I suppose, neither anye Methode is altered, or matter omitted, that by me then was there spoken. Happily some other wordes in some places are vsed, (as otherwise it were not possible, vn∣lesse I shoulde haue firste penned, and then conned my Sermon by hearte, whiche had bin a heauy laboure, bothe lothsome, & needlesse I praise God of his mercies, to whose glorie I speak it) but the felf same substāce of doctrine, matter, maner, and order, which both your worships with the rest thē heard is here continued. If therefore it nowe seeme to obtaine lesse, consider the a∣ction is past, yet here is the same mat∣ter, but wanting the voice, gesture, and person of hym that spake it: But no doubt Gods spirite shal open the harts of the Readers to receiue it (his seede) to their comfort, if they with desire of gaine to their consciences, turne ouer these little leaues. And I praie God,
 (in and by our Christe) that it maye fructifie as muche as my desire is, and that is so much as possibly I can craue. And were it of much more valor (as it is for the handling, but in midle sorte) no other choice woulde I make, than to bothe your Worshippes (my good cousins) as to them, to whome I owe my selfe, for your louing and continu∣all friendships towardes me. This my poore gifte, therefore accepte of your good natures, as from the heart of him that wisheth you the whole treasures of God, for euer to enrich you, in bo∣dy, spirite, and soule, to eternall life: Whose defence be euer yours, and your for euer his, in Christe our Lorde, Amen.
 At my Chamber in London, Iune. 6. 1581.
