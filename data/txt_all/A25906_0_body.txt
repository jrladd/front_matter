SIR,
THe Interpretation of Dreames is of the same Origi∣nall and Extent, as is the inspira∣tion or Divine Vertue by which they are infused. That God appeared in Dreams and in the Visions of the night, the sa∣cred Text doth plentifully testifie▪ And that GOD unto some selected

men, by a peculiar spirit, did give the perfect knowledge of the Inter∣pretation of Dreams; the same Di∣vine Truth doth give remarkable demonstrations. I need not to de∣clare unto you the admirable guifts of Joseph, almost in the first Age of the world; and of the Prophet Daniel in the second. Their In∣terpretations in those dayes of the Dreames of the Egyptian and As∣syrian Monnrchy, do sufficiently declare the praescience of their spirits, and how near of kinne they were to God, Our Author being a Philosopher, and working onely by second causes, by the light of Nature; had not that happy inter∣est to be so immediately, so divine∣ly inspired.
SIR; I make bold to present him to you in an English dresse: And although by the Ignorance of Antiquity he had the misfortune to be a Heathen, you shall finde him through the Excellence of his merit, to be clothed in the most refined Languages of Christendome. I have the rather been induced to devote this Book unto you, because your Candor to the Arts, and excellent Experience in the great and choise affairs of Peace and Warre, is of a wide Latitude, and not to be confi∣ned within the English bounds. Your Experience beyond the Seas, doth sufficiently declare your worth, both when you travelled first by your self, and when being Major Domo, you afterwards took with

you (the lively image of your self) your most noble and hopefull Son; whose understanding in the know∣ledges both Polemicall and Politi∣call you increased by foraign obser∣vations, and admirably inlightned it by your own example. According to your noblenesse, in this tempest of Warre receive this Present of the Arts, and be pleased to protect re∣vived Artimedorus: And also, (though the Subiect be of Dreams) to excuse his zeale, who will ever be awake to expresse himselfe to be
(SIR)
