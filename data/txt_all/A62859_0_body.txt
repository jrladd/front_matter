OUt of a love to truth, and respect to my Engage∣ment
by Solemn Covenant I framed, and out of
desire to prevent (if possible) the oppression of
men, for holding a truth, I printed (some years
since) Two Treatises and an Appendx to them, and
after that an Apology for them, with a Postscript; which
were presented to some of your hands by me. Finding that
great hatred is against such as dissent from the Assemblies de∣terminations,
specially in the two points of Baptism, & Disci∣pline,
(which this writing treats of;) and those that shelter
them from violence; and that a great part of the quarrel
between England and Scotland is, for not establishing
Presbyterial Government, with rigour, which is thus ex∣pressed
in the Scottish Assemblies Reply to the  Declara∣tion,
Edius. 22. Julii 1650. Sess. 17. That Jesus Christ be Lord
over his own house, and that his Ministers keep Courts and ex∣ercise
Jurisdiction and discipline, and all the censures of the Kirk
from the lowest to the highest, in his name only, against all that
depart from and do oppose the truth; or that walk loosely as doth
not become the Gospell: and hoping this writing to one of the
Chief Presbyterians in Scotland▪ may contribute something
to discover the unreasonablenesse of their violent proceed∣ings
in their way; and some Truths, not commonly dis∣cerned;

I have yielded to the publishing thereof, in this
sad time of a bloody warre, raised much from the foremen∣tioned
hatred.
Such as it is, I humbly present to your Honours, in testi∣mony
of my thankfulnesse for the favour and pitty to me,
vouchsafed by some of your Honors in conferring on me, &
others in being eminently instrumental in the quiet settling
of me in this place; in which, after plunderings, and many
tossings up and down, I have had some abiding: wherein
I still endeavour to be serviceable to the publique, and to
acquit my self

Ledbury-Hospitall
