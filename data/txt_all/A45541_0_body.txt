IT hath been the Lot of this following Dis∣course
(as well as its Author) to passe
through good and ill Report. Your Self
with many other worthy Gentlemen of the
County, so candidly accepted it, as to desire its pub∣lication,
and yet some ignorant or malevolent Audi∣tors
have fastened upon it, the heavy charge of Super∣stition,
whether justly, or caulesly, let the impartial
Reader Judge. The truth is, when I reflect upon the
persons offended, I have reason to believe, that not the
Popery, but the Loyaltie of the Sermon; not so much
that part of the Discourse about praying for the dead,
as that which perswadeth prayer for, and subjection to
the King and his Government, both Civil and Ecclesi∣astical
was the Crime; and if so, what they account my
fault, I shall ever esteem my duty and my glory.
In the mean time, I cannot but congratulate you,
worthy Sir, those honours which our gracious Soveraign

hath confer'd upon you, particularly, in that having so
plentifull a choice of Able Gentry, he cul'd you out
(as it were) to lead the Van in that high Office where∣with
you are invested, which how you have hitherto ma∣naged,
I need not tell the world. The fame of your
Noble Entertainments, numerous Attendants, and
especially your impartial deportment, hath already fil∣led
City and Country: and I may justly affirm, your
place hath not so much honoured you, as you the place.
Go on (Good Sir) to do worthily, and be famous in
Essex, and by serving faithfully your God, your King,
your Country, to gain to your Self greater honour,
not only in this, but the world to come, which shall be
the constant prayer of,
