In Italie your Lorship vvell hath seene
Their manners, monuments, magnificence,
Their language learn't in sound, in stile, in sence,
Proouing by profiting, where you haue beene;
Bemantling graue conceits in colours greene:
A Dictionarie yet, which might dispence
Of euery worde, the true intelligence
Of that toong, erst of toongs the Peerelesse-Queene
You saw not there: Now see and ioy the sight,
It matcht, and ore-matcht by an English mate:
That he, whom in good grace your Honor placeth,
Graced by you, may grace you with your right.
"By ancient manners stood the Romane state;
From th' ancient stock yong Manors England graâˆ£ceth.
