SIR,
HAving lately, it may be later
than most men in England who
are inquisitive after Books, had
a view of a little Book (in an∣swer
to a Book of Yours which
I had not then seen) Intituled, Fanaticism
Fanatically Imputed by him (Dr. Stil∣lingfleet)
to the Catholick Church; I
had read very few leaves in it, when I was
able warrantably to say, that Mr. Cressy
was the Author of this Book; a person whom
I had long known, and familiarly conversed
with, before he was perverted in his Religi∣on,
aud had often seen since; and upon the
whole I must confess (if there had not been
some particulars in it, which could not suffer
me to be deceived) I could hardly have be∣lieved
that so much pride, and bitterness,

and virulence could upon so little provocation,
and with so little excuse have dropped
from his pen. The confidence of it amazed
me, as much as the rudeness; and though I
could not expect that a man who had treated
his own Mother with so little respect, could
have much reverence for your Person, who
have so vigorously defended her, and fully
vindicated her from all the reproaches that
Classis of men have been able to cast upon her,
and exposed their malice and their ignorance
more nakedly to the view of the world, than
I think hath been ever done before, for
which all her true children are, and always
must be indebted to you, and to your memory:
I thought the little angry Book fit to receive
some answer, and the Author of it worthy of
reprehension and admonition, which he might
receive with less disturbance from an old
Friend; and I thought it likewise unreason∣able
that you, whose studies are so wholly en∣grossed
by, and dedicated to the publick,
should be put to the trouble to free your self
from these feeble calumnies, which every
man who hath read your Works is able to do,
and every man who loves the Church, is
bound in justice to do: Besides, I was willing to
invite other Lay-men to shew with more effi∣cacy
their concernment for the Church, and
the Protestant Religion, so variously and ma∣liciously

assaulted on all hands, though God be
thanked impotently enough, that the defence
of it may not be looked upon as the sole duty of
the Clergy. These were the motives that
invited me to undertake this little task, which
I was not long performing, and yet even when
I had finished it (if so imperfect a draught can
be called finishing) I chanced to have the plea∣sant
sight of your Answer to several late Trea∣tises,
&c. and I can with a very good consci∣ence
assure you, that mine was dispatched be∣fore
I did see it, and therefore, especially since
you have only taken a slight notice in the Pre∣face
of Mr. Cressy's waspish invectives, I
am willing, if you please, that my short Ani∣madversions
may be likewise presented to his
view, which is intirely left to be communica∣ted,
or suppressed, or corrected according to
your judgment, by,
SIR,
