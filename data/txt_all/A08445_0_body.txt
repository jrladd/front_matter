SInce the Orygynal of what so euer is, or may be cō∣uerted to a¦ni good vse in me, hath frelye proceded (thoughe as the minister of GOD) of youre La∣dyshypes mere carefull, and Mo∣therly goodnes, as well in procu∣rynge all thynges thereunto be∣longeynge, as in youre many, and most Godly exhortacyons, where∣in amonge the rest it hath plea∣sed

you, oftē, to reproue my vaine studye in the Italyan tonge, ac∣compting the sede thereof, to haue bene sowen in barayne, vnfruitful grounde (syns God thereby is no whytte magnifyed) I haue at the last, perceiued it my duty to proue howe muche the vnderstandynge of youre wyll, could worcke in me towardes the accomplyshynge of the same. And for that I haue wel knowen your chyfe delight, to rest in the destroynge of man hys glo∣rye, and exaltynge wholy the glo∣ry of God: whych may not be vn∣les we acknowledge that he, doth fore se and determyne from wyth∣out begynnynge, al thynges, and cannot alter or rewarde after our deserued worckes, but remayne stedefaste, accordynge to hys im∣mutable wyll, I haue taken in hande to dedicate vnto youre La∣dyship this smale number of Ser¦mons

(for the excelēt fruit sake in thē conteined, proceding from the happy spirit of the santified Bar∣nardyne, which treat of ye election and predestinacion of God, wyth the rest (although not of the selfe title) a perteynig to the same effect to the end it might appere, yt your so many worthy sentences touch∣ing the same, haue not vtterly ben wtout some note in my weake me∣mory, & al be it, they be not done in such perfectiō, as the dignitie of ye matter doth requyre: yet I trust & know, ye wil accept ye hūble wil of the presēter, not weghing so much the excelnecy of the translacion, al thoughe of ryghte it oughte to be such as should not by the grosnes therof depriue the aucthor of his worthynes. But not meanynge to take vpō me ye reache, to his hygh style of thealogie, and fearyng al∣so, least in enterprisynge to sette

forth the bryghtnes of hys elo∣quence, I shuld manyfest my selfe vnapte, to attaine vnto the lowest degre therof. I descend therefore, to the vnderstāding of myne own debilitye. Only requiring, that it may please youre Ladyshippe to vouchsafe that thys my smal la∣bor may be alowed at your hādes vnder whose proteccion only it is commited wyth humble re¦uerence, as yeldyng some parte of the fruite of your Motherly ad∣monicions, in this my wyllinge seruyce.
