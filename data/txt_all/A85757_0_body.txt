May it please your Grace,
THE golden-Apple, on which was this Inscri∣ption, be it given to the fairest, Paris presented to Venus, as surpassing the others in beauty. The same condition is annexed to this History, which belonging of right to the fairest,

most justly is presented to your Grace, as surpassing all others in the beauty of the body, and mind. And whom should a Queen so renown'd for her vertues, and e∣minent qualities, make her addres∣ses to, if not to your Grace, who like the glorious Sun among the lesser lights, out-shines all other Ladies with the rayes of your Graces rare vertues, and admirable parts. These reflections (Madam) in∣vited this great Princess to recurre to your Grace, who like the River Nilus, disdains to mix the waters she brings from a Paradise, with any other streame. Since the offer∣ing then (Madam) is no waies unworthy of your Graces noble

Altar, where Hecatombs are only to be sacrificed, be pleased not to lessen it in your Graces esteem, be∣cause presented by,
Madam
