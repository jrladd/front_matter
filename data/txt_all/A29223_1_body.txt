TO you, though younger, yet the same in blood,
Send I this ptterne of parentall good:
Whse imitation shall you more advance
Then Fortunes portion, or Inheritance.
For those to Meales of worthlesse mindes are given,
Where these Lies halke you out your way to heaven:
Whose lineall-lustre if you doe not smother,
Makes you Corrivall with your Elder Brother;
Whom as I live I love; and in him you:
"This shall my Muse in richest raptures shew.
While Memory o're your dead Father reares
A Shrine bedewed with Astraeas Teares.
