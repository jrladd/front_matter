MADAM,
WHen the Curious hand of Nature draws
Perfection, when Beauty like yours ap∣pears,
all are inspired with Wonder and
Delight, every Heart is filled with Pleasure, because
every Heart is full of you; Pardon my Ambition,
Pardon the daring of a Pen, too weak to Coppy in∣imitable
Graces; but if none may aim at your love∣ly
Picture, unless they have Power to do you Ju∣stice,
your Praises must be left unsung, and you for
ever adored in Silence.
I own the following Play claims not the least
Merrit to such a Glorious Protection, but that is all
I have to boast, all the reward my Towring Fancy
covets, is centred in my Illustrious Patronesses; this
will to after Ages make my Trifle Sacred, when
they behold prefix'd such Names, whose Virtues
Historians, Poets, and never dying Fame shall join
with me to Eternize.

The Play is partly a Translation from the French;
what I added, if it had not the power to please, had
no Immodesty to offend, which I hope will be an
attonement with your Grace, for other Defects in my
Younger Brother; I wou'd have perswaded the
World to prize Desert, before the Gifts of Fortune,
but the major part are too sordid to like the Example,
few are so truly Noble to fix without Intrest, which
makes so very few truly happy in their Choice.
I wou'd have deferr'd Addressing to Your Grace,
till I had aimed at an Offering more Worthy, but
my Charmed Eyes being lately bless'd with the sight
of You, have let into my mind such a Beautiful Idea,
that I liv'd in pain till I express'd my Admiration.
To be Great and Good, and Exquisitly Fair,
are the happiest Epethets Fate bestows on Mortals;
that they are justly Your Graces due▪ will, I am sure,
be confirmed by an Universal Voice; and that you
may Live long to adorn the Titles, whose Lustre
receive addition from that Beauteous Fame, is the
Eternal wish off
Madam,
