RIght Worshipfull, and the rest of my friends and acquaintance,
I here present you with a short Relation of the taking of Win∣chester;
which is (though easily accomplisht, yet) worth the hea∣ring.
I confesse these are not times for men to spend in writing
or reading Histories: But this being matter of discouragement
to the foe, and of great encouragement to us, I thought good to
divulge: and so much the rather, because I know it hath beene published already
by a false Copie, which mentions the enemies issuing out of the City to meet us;
which is no such matter, and deserveth a checke rather then approbation. Worthy
Gentlemen, the respect and duty that I owe to you all, doth enforce me to make this
Dedication to you, knowing you all to be Patrons to all vertuous actions, in the
Towne where I was borne, and well-wishers to me: and therefore I presume, that
though it be but slenderly compos'd, (the Subject being a known truth, and I your
native Countriman as well in affection as by birth) you will with the more tender∣nesse
passe by any blurre committed in the penning thereof, and censure more fa∣vourably
of my blunt and weake expressions. And no question but that you (set∣ting
Winchester before you for an example) will with the more courage and un∣wearied
resolution defend your (yet unplunder'd) Corporation from the barbarous
cruelty, and from the ambitious pride and insolency of so destructive an enemy;
who if he once enters will leave you nothing to take pleasure in, but the ruines of
an once flourishing Corporation. Thus barring complements, I remaine your must
affectionate and faithfull friend,
