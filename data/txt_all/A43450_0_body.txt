SIRS,
I Have now at last been able to comply with your request of making this Discourse publick: I heartily thank you for the good will you entertained it with at first, for the satisfaction you are pleased to say you received from it, and for the respect and kindness to me

(for that I know you intend) in your repeated wishes it might be pub∣lished.
I am pretty well assured of your respect to what your own desires have formed, but I have no great reason to be so of others; whom therefore I must beg to consider that it was delivered in a plain, popu∣lar, Pulpit-way at first; and that as I have not concerned my self to alter it, so I could not have done it, without more time, and labour than I was willing to allow to it.
You must be pleased to stand accountable for it, and for my self I shall be no further concerned, than to wish it may have that effect up∣on others, that it hath had upon most of you; and I should not wholly despair of it, if Men were willing to receive satisfaction, as certainly they ought, in a matter of this moment.
I pray God Almighty preserve our excellent Church: open mens Eyes to see the truth of our Re∣ligion, and incline all our Hearts to comply carefully with this, and all other institutions of our great Lord. To whose protection, and Blessing I heartily recommend you all.
