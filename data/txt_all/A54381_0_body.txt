FOr thy benefit I
have here taken
the pains to abre∣viate
the body of Mr.
PERKINS Divinity; what
before thou couldst not
have but in a large vo∣lume,
and at a great rate;
Here, thou hast substan∣tially
in short for the bet∣tering
of thy knowledge,
for the directing of thy

lise, and for thine obedi∣ence
in what ever is thy
duty; Take it, & as thou
dost thereby reape pro∣fit,
so lift up thine eys to
Heaven, and return God
thanks to whom alone
its due, & I shall still en∣deavour
thy best good,
wishing to thee thine
everlasting reward, and
labouring to live, and
die, a sure friend to thy
Soul's happiness.
