SIR,
IT was one day, as I was Walking
in Your MAJESTIES Palace
at WHITE-HALL (where
I have sometimes the honour to refresh
my self with the Sight of Your Illu∣strious
Presence, which is the Joy of
Your Peoples hearts) that a presump∣tuous
Smoake issuing from one or two
Tunnels neer Northumberland-House,
and not far from Scotland-yard, did so
invade the Court; that all the Rooms,
Galleries, and Places about it were
fill'd and infested with it; and that to
such a degree, as Men could hardly
discern one another for the Clowd,
and none could support, without ma∣nifest
Inconveniency. It was not this

which did first suggest to me what I
had long since conceived against this
pernicious Accident, upon frequent
observation; But it was this alone,
and the trouble that it must needs pro∣cure
to Your Sacred Majesty, as well
as hazzard to Your Health, which
kindled this Indignation of mine, a∣gainst
it, and was the occasion of what
it has produc'd in these Papers.
Your Majesty who is a Lover of
noble Buildings, Gardens, Pictures,
and all Royal Magnificences, must
needs desire to be freed from this pro∣digious
annoyance; and, which is so
great an Enemy to their Lustre and
Beauty, that where it once enters
there can nothing remain long in its
native Splendor and Perfection: Nor
must I here forget that Illustrious and
divine Princesse, Your Majesties only
Sister, the now Dutchesse of Orleans,
who at her Highnesse late being in this

City, did in my hearing, complain of
the Effects of this Smoake both in her
Breast and Lungs, whilst She was in
Your Majesties Palace. I cannot but
greatly apprehend, that Your Ma∣jesty
(who has been so long accusto∣m'd
to the excellent Aer of other
Countries) may be as much offended
at it, in that regard also; especially
since the Evil is so Epidemicall; indan∣gering
as well the Health of Your
Subjects, as it sullies the Glory of this
Your Imperial Seat.
Sir, I prepare in this short Discourse,
an expedient how this pernicious Nui∣sance
may be reformed; and offer at
another also, by which the Aer may
not only be freed from the present In∣conveniency;
but (that remov'd) to
render not only Your Majesties Palace,
but the whole City likewise, one of
the sweetest, and most delicious Ha∣bitations
in the World; and this, with

little or no expence; but by improving
those Plantations which Your Maje∣sty
so laudably affects, in the moyst,
depressed and Marshy Grounds about
the Town, to the Culture and pro∣duction
of such things, as upon eve∣ry
gentle emission through the Aer,
should so perfume the adjacent places
with their breath; as if, by a certain
charm, or innocent Magick, they
were transferred to that part of Ara∣bia,
which is therefore styl'd the Hap∣py,
because it is amongst the Gums
and precious spices. Those who take
notice of the Sent of the Orange-flow∣ers
from the Rivage of Genöa, and
St. Pietro dell' Arena; the Blossomes of
the Rosemary from the Coasts of Spain
many Leagues off at Sea; or the ma∣nifest,
and odoriferous wafts which
flow from Fontenay and Vaugirard,
even to Paris in the season of Roses,
with the contrary Effects of those less

pleasing smells from other accidents,
will easily consent to what I suggest:
And, I am able to enumerate a Cata∣logue
of native Plants, and such as
are familiar to our Country and Clime,
whose redolent, and agreeable Emis∣sions
would even ravish our senses, as
well as perfectly improve and melio∣rate
the Aer about London; and that,
without the least prejudice to the Ow∣ners
and Proprietors of the Land to
be employ'd about it. But because I
have treated of this more at large in
another curious and noble subject,
which I am preparing to present to
Your Majesty, as God shall afford
me Leasure to finish it, and that I
give a Touch of it in this Discourse,
I will enlarge my Addresses no farther,
then to beg pardon for this Presump∣tion
of
SIR,
