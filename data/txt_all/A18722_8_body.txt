GOod madame for that the vertuous and good Ladie Carie your sister, honourablie accepted a discourse of my penning, I beleeued your Ladi∣ship would not refuse the like offer, humbly presented

and dutifully ment, I bethoght mee of a Tragedie that long laye printed and many speake well of, but some doubting the shallownesse of my heade (or of meere mallice disdaineth my doeings) denies mee the fathe∣ring of such a worke, that hath won so much credit, but as sure as god liues, they that so defames me or doth dis∣able me in this cause, doth me such an open wrong as I would be glad to right with the best blood in my bo∣dy, so he be mine equall that moued such a quarrell, but mine old yeares doth vtterly forbid me such a combat, and to contend with the malicious I thinke it a mad∣nesse, yet I protest before God and the world the pen∣ning of Shores wife was mine, desiring in my hart that all the plagues in the worlde maie possesse me, if anie holpe me either with scrowle or councell, to the publi∣shing of the inuencion of the same Shores wife; and to show that yet my spirits faile me not in as great matters as that, I haue augmented her Tragedie, I hope in as fine a forme as the first impression thereof, and hath sette forth some more Tragedies and Tragicall discourses, no whit inferiour as I trust to my first worke, and good Madame because Rosimond is so excellently sette forth (the actor whereof I honour) I haue somewhat beauti∣fied my Shores wife, not in any kind of emulation, but to make the world knowe, my deuice in age is as ripe & reddie, as my disposition and knowledge was in youth, so hauing chosen a noble personage, to be a patrones to support poore Shores wifes Tragedie againe, I com∣mend all the verses of her (olde and newe) to your good Ladiships iudgement, hoping you shall lose no honour

n the supportation of the same, because the true wri∣ter thereof with all humblenesse of mind and seruice, presents the Tragedie vnto your honourable censure, wishing long life, and encrease of vertues fame, to make your Ladiships daies happie.
