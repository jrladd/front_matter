I Make bold likewise worthy Lady, to joyn you with your dear and much honoured Husband, craving your tui∣tion of this Treatist of the knowledge of Christ (being the first fruits of my weak indeavours) And that you would be pleased to accept of so small a present, as
 a little monument of that great respect I deservedly beare you.
And although I know (Noble Lady) your holy and dayly communion with God, your humblenesse of mind, and ten∣der affections mourning under sin, your zealous longing after, and delight in the word of God when most sincerely taught, your heavenly communication and con∣versation do render you elect, holy, and beloved, amongst all the Saints that know you, and your works praise you in the gates: Yet good Madam, give me leave I humbly beseech you to stirre up and warn your pure mind, that you take heed of loosing your first love, and the things that you have done, but that your works may be more at the last then at the first, that you may shine as the Sun which shi∣neth more and more unto the perfect day, that you may grow in grace and in the
 knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je∣sus Christ, that he may be your all in all, that so you may at last receive your full reward.
The Lord grant this poore little Trea∣tise of mine may kindle a fire within you, to warme your heart with the love of Christ, & be as a means with the blessing of God upon it, to increase your joy and comfort in him, to sweeten your dissolu∣tion when God shall please to finish the period of your dayes, and to fill your heart dayly with more and more lon∣gings to be with Christ, which is best of all, So prayeth
From my study at Mich. Cornhill March 25. 1648.
MADAM,
