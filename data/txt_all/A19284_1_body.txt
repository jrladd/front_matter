RIGHT Hono∣rable,
the prince∣lie
charge that the
Lord hath hono∣red
your elder yeares with∣all,
that your age may bee a
crowne of glorie, beeing
found in the way of righte∣ousnesse,
as it hath laid vp∣on
your Honours, a greater
care for the discharge there∣of:
so hath it prouoked also
those (who as in priuate they
wish your well-fares, so e∣specially,
they desire your

happie sucesse in that pub∣licke
Charge, as being in all
heartie loyalty obliged ther∣to:
These, I say, haue bin stir∣red
vp to deuise all holy and
profitable meanes whereby
your Charge may be more
Honorable, and your care
more comfortable. Among
whom, seeing it hath pleased
your Honours formerlie to
accept of me, & daily to bind
me therto by renued fauours
I haue therefore endeuored
to testifie the heartie conti∣nuance
of my dutie towards
your Honours in this Briefe
of holy rules, and instructi∣ons,
which I haue been bold
to dedicate to the hopefull,
and happie dayes of your
Gracious Charge: not therein
presuming to teach your

Honour what you should
doe: but rather proposing
the same as a Glasse, wherein
you may view, what you
haue done well; and so both
to encourage your Honours
in a happie proceeding, and
to giue you sound comfort
in the good successe thereof:
which as I shall not cease to
pray daily vnto the Almigh∣tie
for; so I doe most hum∣blie
beseech your Honours
thus to conceiue of my ende∣uours,
& to continue, as you
doe, the true paterns of ver∣tuous
nobility, & the Hono∣rable
patrons of religion &
learning. And so I most har∣tilie
commend your Honors
to the grace of God.
