AS perhaps I am the first
who ever presented a
work of this nature to the
Metropolis of any Nation, so
is it likewise consonant to Ju∣stice,
that he who was to give
the first Example of such a
Dedication should begin it

with that City, which has set
a pattern to all others of true
Loyalty, invincible Courage
and unshaken Constancy.
Other Cities have been
prais'd for the same Virtues,
but I am much deceiv'd if
any have so dearly purchas'd
their reputation; their fame
has been won them by cheap∣er
trials then an expensive,
though necessary, War, a con∣suming
Pestilence, and a more
consuming Fire. To submit
your selves with that humili∣ty
to the Judgments of Hea∣ven,
and at the same time to
raise your selves with that

vigour above all humane Ene∣mies;
to be combated at once
from above and from below,
to be struck down and to tri∣umph;
I know not whether
such trials have been ever pa∣rallel'd
in any Nation, the re∣solution
and successes of them
never can be. Never had
Prince or People more mutu∣al
reason to love each other, if
suffering for each other can
indear affection. You have
come together a pair of match∣less
Lovers, through many
difficulties; He, through a
long Exile, various traverses of
Fortune, and the interposition

of many Rivals, who violent∣ly
ravish'd and with-held
You from Him: And certain∣ly
you have had your share
in sufferings. But Provi∣dence
has cast upon you want
of Trade, that you might
appear bountiful to your
Country's necessities; and
the rest of your afflictions are
not more the effects of God's
displeasure, (frequent exam∣ples
of them having been in
the Reign of the most excel∣lent
Princes) then occasions
for the manifesting of your
Christian and Civil virtues.
To you therefore this Year of

Wonders is justly dedicated,
because you have made it so.
You who are to stand a won∣der
to all Years and Ages, and
who have built your selves an
immortal Monument on your
own ruines. You are now a
Phoenix in her ashes, and, as far
as Humanity can approach, a
great Emblem of the suffering
Deity. But Heaven never made
so much Piety and Vertue to
leave it miserable. I have
heard indeed of some vertuous
persons who have ended un∣fortunately,
but never of any
vertuous Nation: Providence
is engag'd too deeply, when

the cause becomes so general.
And I cannot imagine it has
resolv'd the ruine of that peo∣ple
at home, which it has bles∣sed
abroad with such successes.
I am therefore to conclude,
that your sufferings are at an
end; and that one part of my
Poem has not been more an
History of your destruction,
then the other a Prophecy of
your restoration. The accom∣plishment
of which happiness,
as it is the wish of all true
English-men, so is by none
more passionately desired then
by
