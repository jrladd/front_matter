VNto the magnipotent, the renowned princes of Europ,
Emperes Elizabeth, this petie libel I giue.

Which I present to thy Grace, as a prime Primirose or a Couslop,
Onely the flow-er of all our Chronicles, I beleeue:
Skilfuly pend by the knight Sir Thomas Moore then a Courtie'r,
Learned in arts: who delin'd that, that he knew to be trew,
Grounded on experience: requisite to be read of a Ruler.
This donatiue, Soueraigne, deigne to receiue to thy view.
Giue but a grace to my verse, it mounts, O Queene, in a moment,
Vp to the spang'd Element, vp to that ayry Lion:
Giue but a check to the same, it falles downe (throwne with a contempt)
Downe to the Tartarian riuer of hell, Phlegeton.
