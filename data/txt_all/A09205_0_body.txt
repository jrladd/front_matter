HONORED SIR,
MY THALIA well knowing that you are the Trasuer of the Shire, for that (I mean not mony) which a number want, is bold (if her pas∣port bee not ut of date) to visit you in her iourney: she knoweth you, she tels me, for your excllent parts frm among fiue hun∣dred, and is verily perswaded you will stand her friend. Her entertaiement erto hath beene none of the best, which I can impute to no other thing, then as in Barbary the rility of the Soyle, otherwise rich enough. Sir, in bife, shee is sure you are the man can iudge: to put her selfe vpon the Countrey, were to appeal to IGNORANCE, and hazard her Innoence, which dare approach euen the most seuere Tribunll: whatsoeuer she



is, shee submits her selfe vnto your censure; in the meane time, humbly requesting you to take the praeemenince (as you deserue) and vpper-end of er Table, she taketh leaue,
