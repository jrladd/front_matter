Madam,
THere are none of an Illustrious Quality, who have not been made, by some Poet or other, the Patronesses of his Di∣stress'd Hero, or Unfortu∣nate Damsel; and such Ad∣dresses are Tributes, due only to the most Elevated, where they have always been very well receiv'd, since they are the greatest Testimonies.

we can give, of our Esteem and Veneration.
Madam, when I survey'd the whole Toor of Ladies at Court, which was Adorn'd by you, who appear'd there with a Grace and Majesty, pecu∣tiar to Your Great Self only, mix'd with an irrefistible Air of Sweetness, Generosi∣ty, and Wit, I was impatient for an Opportunity, to tell Your Grace, how infinitely one of Your own Sex ador'd You, and that, among all the numerous Conquest, Your

Grace has made over the Hearts of Men, Your Grace had not subdu'd a more in∣tire Slave; I assure you, Madam, there is neither Compliment, nor Poetry, in this humble Declaration, but a Truth, which has cost me a great deal of Inquietude, for that Fortune has not set me in such a Station, as might justifie my Pretence to the honour and satisfacti∣on of being ever near Your Grace, to view eternally that lovely Person, and here that

surprizing Wit; what can be more grateful to a Heart, than so great, and so agree∣able, an Entertainment? And how few Objects are there, that can render it so entire a Pleasure, as at once to hear you speak, and to look upon your Beauty? A Beauty that is heighten'd, if possible, with an air of Negligence, in Dress, wholly Charming, as if your Beauty disdain'd those little Arts of your Sex, which Nicety alone is their great∣est Charm, while yours,

Madam, even without the Assistance of your exalted Birth, begets an Awe and Reverence in all that do ap∣proach you, and every one is proud, and pleas'd, in paying you Homage their several ways, according to their Ca∣pacities and Talents; mine, Madam, can only be exprest by my Pen, which would be infinitely honour'd, in being permitted to celebrate your great Name for ever, and perpetually to serve, where it has so great an inclination.

In the me an time, Ma|'dam, I presume to lay this little Trifle at your Feet; the Story is true, as it is on the Records of the Town, where it was transacted; and if my fair unfortunate Vow-Breaker do not deserve the honour of your Graces Pro∣tection, at least, she will be found worthy of your Pity; which will be a sufficient Glory, both for her, and,
MADAM,
Your Graces most buinble, and most obedient Servant,
