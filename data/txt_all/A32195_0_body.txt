RIGHT VVORSP.LL SR & SRS
Hauing beene often sollicited by the Consuls of the seuerall Factories in Tury, & by other priuate merchants my esteemed friends, for true coppies of the Capitulations, vvee haue vvith the Grand Sig. as they vvere last renevved, & enlarged vvith aduantagious additions, & priuiledges by his Excellencie the Earle of vvinchilsea Our present Lord Ambassadour; I apprehen∣ded that printing some coppies thereof, vvould excuse mee from a greater paines, then transcribing so many vvould bee, as might satisfy my friends, & vvould serue for a good light, & information to euery member concerned in the Leuant trade, of the true extent of the articles vvee hold vvith the Turkish Empire, that so they may neither omit to take those aduantages in their trade, vvhich Our Capitulations allovv, nor ignorantly con∣fiding to vvhat vvas neuer granted, & agreed, runne into those errours, vvhich your com̄on purse hath so often been forced to rectify, & repaire.
These Capitulations, or articles of peace first opened our traffick vvith the Turkes in the Reign of Queene Elizabeth, about 80 yeares past, & since haue beene explained, & enlarged in the time of allmost euery Ambassadour vvith such alterations, as the state of affaires, & the abuses, & iniquitie of the times suggested: And yet all the uigilance, & caution of the many vvise, & resolute Mi∣nisters,
 that haue acted in his Embasse, could neuer (nor neuer vvill) bee able to prouide those prudent remedies, that may bee proofe, & a guard impregnable against the pretences, & uiolence o the Turkish auarice. The present mbassadour, my most estee∣med Lord (vvhom I haue the honour to serue as Secretary of his ovv, & the afaires of your Right VVorshipfull societie) hath contributed an affectuall addition to this vvorke, vvhich by auice, & information from all the Factories in Turky of their respectiue agreiuances, is as amply cofirmed, as the hand, & authoritie of the Emperour, & lavv of nations can establish: to vvhich proposalls tendered by the mercants, the vvarre then hot vvith Algier, occasioned his Excellencie to insert oher cau∣tions, against the pyracies of Barbarie, vvhen at Adrianople hee encountred the messengers, that broug complaints of the assault his Maiesies Fleet against the Capilatio, & Articles of peace had made upon the Grad Signors to vve of Algier, to vvhich al∣legations, his xcellencie made those prudent repies, that neither the priuiledge of their Sect, nor their late presents, nor relation as subiects, could prevaile to afford them matter of fauour, or countennce: And at hovv easy, & cheap a rate your threaned esates vvere then protected, the accounts sen you home vvill iustify: & the inconsiderable Auances that haue happened since his arriuall, are a testimonie of the great vvisdome, & care of his Excellency; That if it please God, to con inue the same successe to him, in the remainde of his time, blesed vvith the present florishing estate of your trade, his returne may bee celebrated vvih the same, & glory of the most happy, & fortunate of Embassadours.
These Capitulations being thus compleated, to vvhich nothing can at present, bee thought or, to make more, perfect, or no oppresson imaginable, vvhich eet not a prohibition herein, untill the maitious inuention of the Turkes (vvhich is ingenious in nothing but in matters of their intere) espy some unarmed part, in vvhich to vvrd Vs: It is the vvidome, igilance, & reso uion of the Embas adour to maintaine them in reuerence, & obseruation: in vvhich that course, & method is to bee taken, as is not practised in the Courts of Christendome, & is of that different forme, in matte & proceeding, as vvill render an experi∣enced Minister in the treaties of other countries a Nouice in this, untill tie & conuersaion hath instructed him in a nevv science & unacqinted Maximes of State, & policie.
The Capitulations the Grand Sig.r giues to us, & other Christians tha tff ck vvith im, are (in my opinion) of an other nature & forme, then articles of peace are usuall to bee betvveene tvvo
 nations; for hee requires no counterpart from his Maiestie, vvhe∣reby to oblige him to performe the ame conditions vvith him∣self, but as if hee needed, & expected nothing from the English conferres on them seuerall Imperiall im̄unities, & priuiledges, as his Charter, & Acts of grace, vvithout demand of any returnes vvhich hee accounts as a diminution to his all containing Maiesty to bee needfull, or vvanting of. And this pide, is o naturall to the Turkes, & so necessary to bee flattered by those, vvho vvould maintaine the intercourse of peace, & trafficke vvi h them, that it is no meane Art to knovv vvll, how to nourish, & dlly vvih their barbarous humour. But it is beyond, I must confesse, my capacitie, to bee more, then superficially acquainted vvith these mysteries, it is for my Lord, to bee Master, & profoundly uersed in them; vvho knovves the times, both to threaten, & to flatter, & vvhen vvith resolute vvords, or soft speeches to dispearse, & calme those stormes, vvhich vvee vvho liue, under the arbitrary vvill of Tyrants, doe often foresee, & yet dissolue, before the fury reach, & arriue you. This is the care, & study of his Excel∣lencie, vvho hath many times occasion to bee more tender of your safetie, then his ovvne, & to interpose himself, & his, betvveene you, & the barbarous rage. And vvhen I, vvho am one of the meanest of those concerned in your interest, an bee of seruice, & se to the publick benefit of the Right vvors∣hipfull societie, I shall thinke my life too meane a sacrifice to ofer to you; for hauing receiued so many obligations from your vvorships & testimonies of your bountie, I iudge my self for euer bound to subscribe my self.
