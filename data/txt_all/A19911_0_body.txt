WIT, and my Will (deere Lord) were late at strife
To whoÌ„ this Bridegroome I for grace might send.
Whose Bride was erst the happiest husbands wife,
That ere was haplesse in his Friend, and End.
Wit, with it selfe, and with my Will, did warre:
For, Will (good-Will) desir'd it might be YOU:
But, Wit found fault with each particular
It selfe had made; sith YOU were It to view.
Alledging YOU had all his Vertue got,
And left him gracelesse: so, was loth t'appeare
To your cleare eyes: wherwith good. Will grew hot,
And said her loue, to YOU, was all as cleare:
Then, both agreed YOU should, for lasting-life,
Sith best YOU could, make this man match that Wife.
