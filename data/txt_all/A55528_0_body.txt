Right Honourable, and Honoured Gentlemen,
HAving amongst many others, obser∣ved
your constant proceedings; and
being no less convinced of the just∣ness,
than of the publike safety that your
successes tend unto; It was a great bur∣den
to my spirit, that your Actions
should be so publikely and so fouly mis-represented, as by
many they have bin, especially of late: Now fearing
lest through the subtilty of our common enemy, the De∣vil,
who fails not to endeavour by strong delusions to de∣ceive,
if it were possible, the very Elect: (Though I was
informed and assured you undertook not so great a work
without strong prayers, hearts plyable to the light you
should receive, and sufficient premeditation) yet I say,
fearing least any one of you (through the strong Assaults
of so many Temptations on every side, both Spiritual
and Temporal) should be in the least measure discoura∣ged:
And perceiving what a floud of weighty Affairs are
at once fallen upon your shoulders: I did humbly beseech
God (who for the most part makes use of weakest means)
at this time to enlarge my small Talent beyond its ordi∣nary

capacity, in the vindication of you, against such more
than ordinary aspersions (which nothing but the meeknes
of true Christians would enable men of your power and
trust patiently to bear) the justness of your proceedings
being grounded upon Principles as cleer, as the faculty of
human understanding can evince. Yet being much pressed
for want of time, I could onely touch upon such general
heads, as necessarily tend to the true state of that act for
which you are so highly and with such strong presumption
condemned: whereby (although finding that much
more might have bin said to your vindication therein; I
was necessitated to cut my way shorter than otherwise I
should have bin willing. Thus humbly taking leave
of your Excellency, and your Honourable Councel, I
rest.
