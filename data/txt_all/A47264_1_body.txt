Most accomplisht LADY,
THe many singular favours, which I have received, not onely from your worthy self, but also from your thrice noble progenitors, justly ob∣lige me by all the due tyes of gratitude, to tender a just acknowledgement: I wish the same heart, that for many and just causes truly honours you, had any present worthy your acceptance. Now shall it be your singular goodnes to pa∣tronage this small Treatise, which (if I mistake no) carries with it two parts, Delight, and Utilitie. I doubt not then, but that it will find a generall ac∣ceptance

among all those, who are any way the least Lovers of such pleasing and all delightfull studies. I intend not to paraphrase upon its worth, its use, and singular profit, which abun∣dantly speaks it second unto none that have been published of the like nature: So hoping you will accordingly esteem of it, I begg pardon for my boldnes, and rest ever,
