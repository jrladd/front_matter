CHristian Reader, at the urgent impor∣tunity of some both Pious and Judicious, the relict of the Authour, with the con∣sent of his nearest Relations, hath pre∣sented these Theses and Sermons to publick view (as is hoped) for thy good: and would have thee advertised, that these onely are all his labours as yet extant, or published to the world, and there∣fore none else to be owned as his, unless attested by the said Relations. If these few shall be found acceptable, and be∣neficial to thee, it is probable that more hereafter will be made publick in the same volume: in the mean time it is heartily wished that these may be as effectual to the Reader, as they were affectionately intended by the Speaker; and it is hoped then God will have glory, and his people good by them, which is the utmost aim of the publishing of them.
Farewel.
