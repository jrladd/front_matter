BY this Table (right Houourable and Worshipfull) strangers that blame our tongue of difficultie, and vncertaintie, may hereby plainely see, and better vnderstand those things, which they haue thought hard. Hereby also the true Orthographie, that is, the true writing of many hard English words, borrowed from the Greeke, Latine and French, and how to know one from the other, with the interpretation thereof by plaine English words, may be learned & known. And children hereby may be prepared for the vnderstanding of a great number of Latine words: which also will bring much delight and iudgement to others, by the vse of this little worke.

Now when I had called to minde (right Hoâˆ£norable and Worshipfull) the great kindnes, and bountifulnesse, which I found in that vertuous and godly Lady, Lucy Harington, your Honors and Worships mother, and my especiall friend in the Lord. When, and at such time as the right Worshipfull Sir Iames Harington Knight, your Ladiships Brother, was my Scholler (and now my singular benefactor) when I taught the Grammer Schoole at Okeham in the County of Rutland: In consideration whereof, and also for that I acknowledge my selfe much beholding and indebted to the most of you, since this time, (being all naturall Sisters) I am bold to make you all ioyntly Patrons hereof, and vnder your names to publish this simple worke. And thus praying, that God of his vnspeakeable mercies, will blesse both your Honours and Worships, I do with all good wishes to you all, with all yours, as to mine owne soule, humbly take my leaue.
