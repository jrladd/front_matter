My Lord,
I Humbly beg your Lordships Favourable Acceptance of this Address; which is design'd as a Publick Expression of the Great Veneration I have for your Lord∣ship, and of the Grateful Sense I retain of the Favour and Incou∣ragement you have hitherto been Pleased to shew me, since your Happy Accession to this See.
I do not, cannot think this a Pre∣sent worthy of your Lordship; but being induc'd to publish these Dis∣courses, in hopes that the Novelty of the Dress they appear in, may in∣cline some to look upon them, who seldom take notice of things of this
nature when in the usual Garb: I could not but Dedicate them to your Lordship, as my Diocesan, and as an Account in part how I discharge my Duty in my Cure, under your Lordships Inspection and Government.
If I shall be so Happy as to do any Service to God and Religion by this Publication, I am sure your Lordship will not disapprove of it, and I shall have what I aim at: I therefore beg your Lordships Blessing, and your Prayers, that these my well-meant Endeavours (however otherwise Deficient) may be Successful to that Great End: And with all due Deference to your Lordships Eminent Worth as well as Station, I am, and shall make it my Care to Approve my self,
My LORD,
