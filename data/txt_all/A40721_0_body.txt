May it please your Lordship,
YOU cannot but remember in how difficult a Post I stood, when you came to Exon with the Prince of O. (our now most Gracious King) I being, with some of my Brethren, the first Clergy-men that were summoned to appear before him. And I cannot forget, but shall ever, with all due Gratitude, acknowledge your Lord∣ships then great Tenderness and Care of us, when in those new and strange Circumstances, we did not readily observe the Orders sent us.
But seeing I soon afterwards (perhaps the First that in Print) endeavour'd to perswade my Bre∣thren to recognize this Happy Government, may I not with the more Freedom observe the Prejudi∣ces
 it yet labours with, and that the least of them are not the Fears of too many among us, that the Church of England may suffer under it.
I have read over your Lordships late Excellent Treatise, called, The Pastoral Care, with no small Satisfaction, and presume to take this Occasion to give you my particular humble Thanks for the same▪ verily believing, that if the Rules therein given us, were in any good measure observ'd and put in practice, it would Cure most of those Fears.
Since your Lordships greater Wisdom saw no necessity, in a Treatise of that nature, of taking much notice of the Socinian Leven, 'tis not fit for me to wish you had done so; yet if I may have leave to judge by my own Experience, I fear, not the least of our Danger is threatned from that Quarter: However, I doubt not, but in the Exer∣cise of The Pastoral Care, your Lordship, with the rest of our Venerable Fathers, will, by the Blessing of God, timely prevent it, after the Example of the Ancients.
I know your Lordship will pardon this Bold∣ness of,
My LORD,

Litton, near Dorcester▪ Octob. 14. 1692.
