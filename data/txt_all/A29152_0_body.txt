My Lord,
WEre I not sufficiently assured, that your Candour is as great as your Judgment, I should not have expos'd the follow∣ing Trifle to your Lordship's Censure; whose dis∣cerning Eyes would not fail to discover the small∣est fault, did not your Goodness draw a veil over them: It is to that I humbly offer up this youth∣ful Essay, which aims no higher than to obtain your Pardon, since it cannot pretend to your Appro∣bation, having nothing to recommend it, but the Zeal of the Presenter: And this, my Lord, has been growing up with me from my earliest Years; that extraordinary Genius, and those admirable Qualifications, which distinguish your Lordship

from the rest of Mankind, having created in me a proportionable respect and Reverence for their Owner, as soon as I was capable to taste true Sense, or to relish the excellency of those Writings with which your Lordship has sometimes been pleased to oblige the World. But as these Considerations gave me a very great Esteem and Veneration for your Lordship; so that which raised them to the high∣est degree imaginable, is that hearty Zeal, and unaffected Sincerity, with which you daily labour to support the Interest of that Government, for which I have been no inconsiderable Sufferer: And as this engages me in your Lordship's Service with all possible Devotion, so give me leave to hope that it entitles me in some measure to your Lordship's Protection; since the very same Principle causes us mean ones to suffer for it, which engages those of your exalted Quality to strengthen and up∣hold it; namely, a true Affection to the Pro∣testant Religion, and the English Li∣berties; Both which were visibly struck at, and had infallibly been overturned, had not Pro∣vidence made use of their present Majesties to rescue and relieve them. But I forget that I am robbing the Publick, while I detain you from your more serious Employments; I shall only beg

your Lordship not to judge of the respect I bear you by the meanness of this Present; but to be∣lieve, that I shall always look upon the Honour of your Lordship's Patronage, as too great a Recompence for all my former Sufferings; and that no Title can be more considerable to me, than that of,
MY LORD,
