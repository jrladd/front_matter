SIr, I willingly acknowledge that by two assured bands of loue and duty, I am obliged vnto you. The former arose from that vnsained affecti∣on which I euer bare from my first acquaintance in our Colledge towards those three Gentlemen your sonnes: In whom I haue alwaies both entirely loued and honoured those excellent vertues which giue an assured promise of much comfort to their Parents, and fruit vnto their Countrey, and of their happie succeeding in those vertuous steps of piety and true honour, which both your selfe, and their most re∣nowmed Grandfather of honourable and blessed memo∣rie, Sir Walter Mildmay haue trode before them.

I am further engaged vnto you by that most louing re∣spect it pleased you to haue of me, when contrary to the corrupt custome of many Patrones in this age, of your owne accord you called me to this place, my selfe being farre absent, and neither knowing nor once dreaming thereof. In regard of both which, if I present vnto you these small fruits of my studies in that place, which by your meanes I quietly enioy, I nothing doubt but you will receiue them not onely as an assured pledge of my loue vnto you, but specially as a fit argument whereon to exercise your religious meditations and retired thoughts amids those manifold encombrances and trou∣bled affaires which you now sustaine: to all which wishing an happy end and issue, and to your selfe encrease of all Gods graces and blessings, I take my leaue.
From Black Notley in Essex this first of Decemb. 1607.
