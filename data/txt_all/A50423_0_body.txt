SIR,
THough the happiness which I formerly enjoyed in your Converse, hath been, to my great loss, for some years discon∣tinued; yet I easily perswade my self, that the Favour of a Great Prince, and the Best Master in the World, has not wrought such a change upon your even Virtue, but that you will still descend to remember him whom you were once pleased to honour with the Name of Friend. This Confidence has embol∣d'ned me to present you with this small

trifle; too mean indeed and trivial for your acceptance, but that I know you are wont to admit of any thing that proceeds from an honest undesigning Gra∣titude. And though I am not at all inclin'd to vanity from the merits of the Work it self, yet I am proud that it affords me an opportunity to discover the lasting impressions, which your many Favours have made upon my Breast. Geometry, with Arithmetick her Wo∣man, are Beauties, that having Truth written in their Foreheads, dare ap∣pear in the Court of the greatest Mo∣narch, and I doubt not but they will find very easie and courteous admit∣tance into your Appartment; where if they shall afford you any divertisement when you return wearied from your ingenious Elaboratory, I shall then ac∣compt that I have written to very good purpose. However, they certainly as∣sure you, that it is impessible the teeth of Time should obliterate the honourable esteem conserved for you, in the heart of,
Sir,
