SIR,
GOd, who
from all
eternitie
hath had
an infinit
Masse of
grace and glory lying by
him, to bestow upon his
Church: and did according∣ly
provide a treasury and
Magazin sufficient wherein

to store up all, [the Bosome
of his Sonne:] in whom
are hid,Ephes. 3. 8. riches so un∣searchable,
as cannot bee
told over, much lesse spent to
all eternity.
Hee hath as richly shed
his holy Sprit on us: Tit. 3. 6. that
we, who could never have
known of any thing bequea∣thed
us, nor what to pray
for as wee ought, might
both, fully from him know
all that God hath given
us; and through him lay
claime thereto, who ma∣keth
intercession for us;
and so doth furnish us with
a privy key to all that Trea∣sury,
which otherwise, is fast
shut up to all the world.
Through which Spirit of
of prayer, and supplicati∣ons

thus powred foorth,
beleevers come to bee at once
anointed to the fellow∣ship,
and execution of those
three glorious Offices of
Christ their head. Not only
1. of Priests; by offering
up their prayers, as spiri∣tuall
sacrifices, acceptable
to GOD, through Jesus
Christ: but 2. of Kings;
to rule with God, Hos. 11.
12. Being hereby made of
Privy Councell to the King
of kings,Psa. 20. 4, 5 so as their Coun∣cels,
and desires exprest in
their Petitions, are said to
be fulfilled; and their de∣crees
in their Praiers
made,Iob 22. 27, 28. ratified, and esta∣blisht.
Nay further, by ver∣tue
of this priviledge, ad∣vanced
to such height of fa∣vour,

Hos. 12. 3, 4 as by their strength
in praier alone, to have po∣wer
with God himselfe;
and not onely with him, but
also over him; and in their
wrestlings to prevaile:
Yea to command: Himselfe
hath said it; Thus saith
the Lord, the holy One of
Israel and his Maker,
ASKE of me, of things
to come, concerning my
sonnes, and concerning
the worke of my hands,
COMMAND ye ME,
Isai. 45. 11. which so trans∣cendent
priviledge of power,
is likewise by the expresse
words of this great Charter,
universally extended unto all
transactions of this lower
part of his dominions; whe∣ther
Ecclesiasticall, which

doe concerne his sonnes,
that is, his Church: or what
ever other, the more ordina∣ry
works of his hands,
that appertaine to common
providence.
And for as much as these
grand affaires of this his
Kingdome,Mat. 6. 10. as future, and
to come, are commended to
their praiers, as their most
proper subject, about which
they are to treate, Aske of
mee of things to come:
in this respect, they doe be∣come
as truely. 3. Prophets
also: though not in so full
and compleate, yet in some
kinde of true resemblance;
not by foretelling, yet by
forespeaking in their pray∣ers,
things that come to passe.
To demonstrate which, God,

who made and upholds this
world, and all things in it,
by the word of his power,
doth likewise rule and go∣verne
it, by the Presidents,
and prescript rules, of the
word of his will: exactly di∣spensing
unto men,Psal. 25. 10. both re∣wards
and punishments, ac∣cording
to the tenour of some
or other, of his promises and
threatnings, and former like
proceedings therein recor∣ded:
though with such va∣rious
liberty, in respect of
the particulars, that his
wayes remaine unsearcha∣ble
and past finding out:
That looke how he appointed
in the heavens, those ordi∣nances
of the Sunne, Moone,
and Starres, by their light,
heate, and motion, to rule

the day and night, to di∣vide,
and cause the severall
seasons of the yeare, and all
the changes and alterations
that doe passe over this ani∣mall,
and naturall world▪
in like manner hath hee
stretched out that so excee∣ding
broad expanse of his
word and law,Psal. 119. 96. (to which the
Psalmist doth assimulate it)
over this rationall world,Psal. 19. 1, 2, 3, 4. compared with Rom. 10. 18. of
Angels and Men; and
therein set his Statutes,
and his Judgements, that
by the light of Precepts, and
their influences in rewards
and punishments, they might
order and direct these his
creatures reasonable, and all
their actions; also dispose,
and set out all the issues of
them. And seeing his Saints

they are a people in whose
hearts is his Law; and
their delight is to meditate
therein, both day and
night, they daily calculating
and observing the various
aspects, conjunctions, and
mixt influences of those in∣numerable
precepts, promi∣ses,
and threatnings, which
themselves and others, Na∣tions
or Men, stand under;
and by a Judgement thence
resulting,Ier. 8. 7. so farre as they
have attained, endeavou∣ring
to frame their suppli∣cations
and petitions accor¦ding
to Gods will: Hence
their praiers oft, full hap∣pily
succeed, and aforehand
doe accord, to those issues and
events, that afterwards fall
out. That like as it some∣times

falls out, that the
earth comes to bee just under
the Sun and Moone, in
some of their conjunctions;
so their desires and praiers,
sometimes in a direct line
fall under, and subordinate∣ly
concurre with Gods secret
purposes, and some revealed
promise met in conjunction,
to produce such and such ef∣fects.
The Spirit also, here∣in
helping their infirmi∣ties,
sometime so guiding
and directing them, by a
gracious preinstinct, though
unbeknowne to them, to pitch
their requests upon such par∣ticulars,
as God hath fully
purposed to bring to passe;
becomming thereby, as it
were, the Spirit of prophecy
unto them; respectively, in

some measure and degree.
Thus doth that great
King, imploy his nearest ser∣vants,
as his under-Officers,
and Sherifes to serve his
Writs, & executions upō his
Enemies; to execute the
Judgement written in his
threatnings, Psalm. 149. 9.
and to accomplish his mer∣cies
written also; by putting
all the promises in suit; to be
as man-midwives (as He∣zekiahs
allusion, when hee
sent a visiting to the Prophet
Esay,Esay 37. 2, 3, 4. for his voice and suf∣frage,
seemeth to import) to
help and assist his promises
and decrees in their travell
with mercies and delive∣rance,
Zeph. 2. 2. when these their chil∣dren
doe come unto the
birth, and there is no

strength to bring them
forth.
In all which, they shall
therefore have the honour to
bee accounted Co-workers to∣gether
with God, in his grea∣test
works of wonder. And
at the latter day, when that
great and last Edition, both
of all Gods works, and like∣wise
ours, then compleate
and finished, shall be publi∣shed
to all the world, they
shall finde their names put
to them, together with his
owne; and the same by him
acknowledged, to be as truely
the works of their hearts and
prayers, as that they are the
sole worke of his hands and
power. Such honour have
all his Saints.
And if all the workes of

GOD are so exceeding
great, and his thoughts
therein so very deep, Psal.
92. 5. that every Iota of
them, doth deserve our dee∣pest
studies, and intentions;
and thereunto require a pro∣per
skill and wisedome, to
reade his hand, peculiar unto
the Saints, ver. 6. whereun∣to
there must be adjoined the
most diligent search,Psal. 77. 6. and
attentive observation to
finde out his meaning in
them; and withall a speciall
inclination, and delight to
be conversant therein, Thy
workes are very great,
sought out of those that
have pleasure in them,
Psal. 111. 2. And if, of all
the rest, those choiser pieces,
his workes of mercy may

challenge our best regard:
in which his heart and de∣lights
are most;Mich. 7. 18. on which
his wisedome hath laid on
the richest workmanship, in
the most curious contrive∣ments
of his love: Then
surely that selected volume
of more speciall mercies [His
Epistles:] vouchsafed in
answer to our prayers, is a∣bove
all other, most exactly
to be studied, and most dili∣gently
to bee perused by us.
Wherein God doth unbo∣some
himselfe, and lay open
his heart, more sweetly, more
familiarly unto us; which
are directed, and in a maner
dedicated more particularly
unto our selves alone; Many
of them written with his
owne hand, in a more imme∣diate

maner discovered and
appearing in them: and all
of them come sealed with
the impresse of everlasting
love, and downe laden with
the enclosure of the most
precious tokens of his speciall
favour.Ps. 107. 43. Who so is wise,
will observe these things;
and they shall understand
the loving kindnesse of
the Lord.
Neither have such fa∣vours,
onely more of mercy
in the things themselves be∣stowed,
but are further in∣deared
to us, by being made
our owne mercies, by a
more peculiar title to them:
by which the kindnesse in
them is rendred double. For
therein wee have that royall
liberty to become our owne

choosers, and contrivers of
our owne condition; having
all the promises throwne
downe to us, with blanks for
us to write our names in
which of them wee please;
which is the greatest liberty.
And Wee have withall his
Spirit secretly directing,
and fixing the needle of our
desires, to the same point,
wherein his great intentions
towards us doe meete with
our best good: which is in∣deed
the truest liberty. And
to be made our selves, whom
we love so well, and there∣fore
delight to do good unto,
the chiefest instruments un∣der
him of our owne greatest
happinesse, is a priviledge,
then which, the creature is
not made capable of a more

transcendent royalty. And
yet when the greatest love,
thus rectified, which possibly
we can beare our selves, hath
opened its mouth widest,
and stretched our desires in
praying, to their utmost com∣passe;
then will Gods infi∣nite
vast love, not onely fill
them, but doe for us above
all that we are able to ask,
yea to thinke; exceeding
abundantly above all; as
farr above, as his thoughts
are above our thoughts;
which is farre more then
the heavens are higher
then the earth.
All which, when put to∣gether,
(if well considered,)
how would it provoke us to
call in all that precious stock
of our time, thoughts, and

intentions which wee cast a∣way
on trifles, to lay out the
choisest portion of them in
this thriving trade of enter∣course
with God; the re∣turnes
whereof, are better
then the merchandise of
silver, and the gaine ther∣of,
then fine gold. It is the
praying Christian that alone
imployes the riches of the
promises, which wee usually
let lie by us like dead stocke
unimproved: whilst hee,
like a wise and diligent
Merchant, looks abroad up∣on
all the affaires of Iesus
Christ, that are afloat here
in this world, and adven∣tures
in them all; is watch∣full
to spy out all advanta∣ges,
and with an holie
, intermedleth

in every businesse that
may bring in glory unto God,
good unto the Church, grace
and comfort to his owne
soule. And how infinitely
rich must that man needes
become, that puts even Gods
riches out to use, with the
increase of ten Talents for
one, yea an hundred fold!
The due estimate whereof,
would no lesse quicken us to
as diligent an inquiry, what
becomes of all those goodly
adventures, the prayers we
make; to listen what haven
they arrive at, how, and
when, and with what
fraught they doe returne.
In which great duty, and
most necessary property of all
true Merchants, yet many
of the best and greatest dea∣lers,

that are diligent enough
in praying, are still found
failing and deficient; that
omit no gainfull opportunity
of adventure, but are care∣lesse
and unobservant of
their returnes.
Some through ignorance
(it may be) that this is at all
a duty, or of any such im∣portance,
are carefull onely
how to lade in praiers enough,
not expecting to finde any of
this bread cast upon the
waters, untill that great
and generall returne of
themselves, & all the world,
with joy bringing their
sheaves with them. O∣thers,
though at present,
many of their praiers come
home after a few daies, and
richly laden; yet through

want of skill to reade those
Bills of Exchange which
God often writes in an ob∣scurer
character, they lie un∣regarded
by them. Many
when voyages prove long,
(though to their greater ad∣vantage,
when once they doe
returne, yet in the meane
time) through discourage∣ment,
they give all for lost,
as we doe ships at Sea we can∣not
heare of. The most are
commonly complaining, that
their adventures still misca∣ry,
and that little or nothing
comes of all their prayers.
And All are negligent of
keeping their bookes of ac∣counts,
to cast up their com∣mings
in, and goings out, the
one with the other. By which
they lose the chiefest portion

of that comfort, which for
the present, God hath here
allotted us to live upon [the
revenues of their prayers.]
And God also, is not onely
robbed of that Custome
of his glory which should
thence accrew; but wrong∣ed
also by standing still as
debtor in their accounts to
many prayers, in the return
of which he hath been credi∣tor
long agoe.
I have endevoured there∣fore
in this small Treatise to
convince beleevers of the
grand importance of this du∣ty,
which is so full of gaine:
To discover likewise the
causes of the neglect herein,
and remove the temptations
and discouragements which
doe occasion it; and have

briefly resolved such cases
as doe more usually occurre
in the practise of it. But
principally, my desire was to
give in some few experi∣ments,
and observations,
which may help to teach the
weaker sort, though not per∣fectly
to reade, yet here and
there to spell, (and especially
out of the impressions in
their own hearts) Gods mea∣ning
towards them in his
answers. I have cast in some
scattered calculations of
broken praiers cast up, which
though they wil not amount,
to make generall and per∣fect
Tables out of, yet may
serve, as Instances and ex∣amples,
for yong beginners,
to direct them in the exer∣cise
of this most usefull skill,

and wisedome, how to com∣pute
and ballance their ac∣counts
by comparing their
prayers and their returnes
together.
This small and imperfect
embryon, I have presumed to
send forth into the world;
and directed it first of all to
present its service unto you;
and make an honourable and
thankefull mention of your
Name. Your worth deserves
a more costly, large, and la∣sting
monument for this in∣scription.
Your owne abili∣ties
of learning, eloquence,
and depth of wisedome in
humane affaires, would you
be perswaded to lay them out,
as you are able, would erect
such a remembrance and
sumptuous memoriall of

you, when you are gathe∣red
to your Fathers, as
would beare some proportion
to your great worth. But
that which emboldned me
was the neere affinity which
meditations of this nature
doe hold, with those other
your more retired thoughts
you thinke to none but God
and your owne soule. You
have beene long a frequent
and constant dealer in this
blessed way of entercourse
with God in private: Those
that know you, know your
strict observance of those
exchange houres you have
devoted to meet with God,
and enjoy communion with
Him. But above all, it was
that personall obligation, un∣der
which a great and speci∣all

all favour from you long
since brought me, upon which
I devoted (with my selfe)
the first of my labours unto
your service. And it be∣came
one great reliefe unto
my thoughts, weighing the
many inconveniences of ap∣pearing
thus in publique,
that it gave so full occasion
to pay my vowes thus openly
before all the world; which
having now done, God that
is rich in mercy to all that
call upon him, fill you with
all Grace, and grant all your
petitions; so prayes
