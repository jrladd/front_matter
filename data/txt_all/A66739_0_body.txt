TO thee, great Britains, France & Irelands King,
To thee, great Faith's defending Soveraign,
To thee, great Patron of Parnassus spring,
To thee, great Neptune of our Northern Main,
To thee, great Owner of th'Hesperian Plain,
To thee, great Patron both of Armes and Arts,

To thee, great Mover of great Albion's wain,
To thee, great Monarch, both of hands and hearts,
To thee, great Sun, who to our soyle imparts
Light, vegetation, life and influence,
To thee, great Pan, who break'st Bellona's darts,
To thee, great Mirrour of Magnificence,
My pure Urania sacres those poor drops
She suck'd from Pindus and Parnassus tops;
'Tis true, to thee she can no good impart,
Yet shall she sing, Thy servant's
