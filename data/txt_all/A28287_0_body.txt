SIR
THE Author's untimely death preventing his Desire of ad∣dressing this Piece to your Patronage, I thought my

self obliged (the Copy being left in my hands) at once to make good his Intentions, and gratifie my own Inclination. It being therefore a Posthu∣mous Work (though the first Fruits of his Fan∣cy) your favourable Pro∣tection will be the more generous. His Ingenui∣ty might have made some proportionable Offer at your Character; and in∣deed where so many Ac∣complishments

of Mind and Person are happily united, the most modest Account that could be given, would have made no small Panegyrick with∣out any Assistance of Ar∣tifice or Rhetorical Co∣lours. I dare not un∣dertake to draw you to the Life, nor can pre∣tend to touch those many shining Graces wherewith Art and Nature have made you admirable. Be∣sides,

Sir, your own Mo∣desty (that inseparable Companion of ingenious Tempers) might think that too much, which all that know you will find too little, and short of the fair Original. The Charms of Behaviour, Civility and Courtesie, (especially when they are the Result of a good Nature) in a Person of Quality, are no small Inducements to attract

the Love and Esteem of Mankind. But if, besides the Accomplish∣ments of a Gentleman, the strongest Dispositi∣ons to Vertue and Know∣ledge, with an early and eminent Progress there∣in, be enough to cre∣ate an Expectation in the World, your best Friends and nearest Re∣lations have only this to wish on your behalf,

that your ripe Manhood may make good the Promises of your Youth, and render you (as un∣doubtedly they will) an Ornament to the Na∣tion. But, Sir, my pre∣sent Design being not to present you with an Encomium, but only to beg your Favour to an Orphan-Piece of Ingenui∣ty, if it have the good For∣tune to divert your lei∣sure

Hours (as it was the Author's Ambition) it will be no small Sa∣tisfaction to,
Sir,
