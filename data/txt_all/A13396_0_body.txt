RIGHT Honorable my
good Lord, it was my bap
lately to light vpon a Book
dedicated vnto your Lord∣ship,
by one M. George
Churchey, intituled, A new
booke of good husbandrie, and intreating of
fishponds, and ordering of the same: which
booke, as it should seeme, was first written in
Latine by one Iames Dubrauius, but transla∣ted
into English by the industrie of the said
Maister Churchey, wherin his good meaning
and trauell is greatly to be commended. I
thereby gathering that your Lordship tooke
some delight in that practise, & being before
that time minded to put in writing certaine
experiments, that my selfe had obserued con∣cerning
those matters, did presently conclude

with my selfe, humbly to craue that the same
may passe vnder your L. protection: your
vertues also deseruing that I should make
choise herein of your Lordship before others,
as one vnto whom the whole commonweale
of this Realme in general is greatly bounden,
for the great and painfull watchings, care and
trauell you take in administration of Iustice in
your place and calling: and therefore I in par∣ticular,
find my selfe willing (if by any meanes
I may) to moue vnto your Lordship any de∣light
or liking, though neuer so litle. And if
your Lordship haue bene any practiser of
these delights, I meane making of fishponds,
or planting of fruite, I doubt not but you shal
in this litle Treatise, find somewhat that you
knew not before, and thereby your delight
that way augmented, which, if it so happen to
be, my expectation herein is most amplie sa∣tisfied:
Beseeching the Almightie, to blesse,
preserue and keepe you and all yours, with
such felicitie, as your heart desireth.
This 22. of Ian. 1600.
