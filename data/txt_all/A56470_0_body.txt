Right Honorable,
YOur Ladiships, or any else, cannot think meaner of this Performance than I my self do; for besides the great hurry and disorâˆ£der that I was in upon the loss of such a Patron us my Lord, I am sufficiently conscious how unfit I am to appear in public, especially upon such a nice and great Subject. As his Lordships particular Commands brought me to the Pulpit, so Yours only have brought me to the Press. And therefore I hope, whatever usage the following Discourse may meet with abroad; I shall always find a shelter in your Ladiships Favours: and the rather, because you can, both of you, largely attest the truth of most of the remarkable Occurrences that I have taken notice of during his Lordships Penitential sickness.

I shall adde nothing more, but wish You may never forget the goodness of Almighty God, who (through this whole melancholy Scene) has signalized his good Providences to You both: and that You may ever live under the special protection thereof, is the constant prayer of

Adderbury,
Aug. 30. 1680.
