SIR, as soone as I had preached this Sermon, it pleased the Lord Bishop of London last deceased, both by his Letter, and by word of mouth, to re∣quest a Copie of it for the Presse. The like did diuers others also. But in truth I had

beene hitherto continued. And so crauing your honourable acceptance of my faith∣full endeauours, I humbly take my leaue, from Saint Iohns Colledge in Cam∣bridge the first day of Febru∣arie, 1595.
