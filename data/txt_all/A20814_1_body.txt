MY verie good Lord, let mee not need by tedi∣ous protestation to expostulate the long con∣ceiued desire I haue had to honour you: your owne noble inclination can best conceiue, what greater testimonie coulde bee demon∣strate: and I had rather abreuiate what I woulde say, then by saying too much, to giue doubtfull construction, of vn∣doubted well meaning. Let this my Epistles be one staire or little degree, whereby I may ascend into the entrance of your good opinion, as one whom I haue chose, amongst the num∣ber of mine honourable friends, whose patronage may giue protection to my newe aduentured Poesie. Thus leauing your honour to your hopefull fortunes, and my Muse to your gracious acceptance, I wish you all happines.
