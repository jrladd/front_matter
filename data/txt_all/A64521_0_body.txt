Right Worshipful!
THE knowledge of your Piety and Virtue, Candour and Benignitie, emboldens me to address these Reflections on our Calamities, with their Cause, and Cure, to the world, under the shadow of your Name, and favour; presuming that with the regularly devout, and truly pious, such as you are, they may find favour, though per∣haps not pleasing the nicer Wits of this curious Age, who will mind more the strain of Poetry than Piety, and like Children throw away the kernel to play with the shell: and since they so freely and impartially taxe the Vices of all, yet only the humble, and pious will endure to hear of

their faults, and there? are few such in these A∣theistical dayes, possibly distasting many licentious and erroneous persons, which yet discourages me not from endeavouring to amend our sad Times, the com∣plaint of all mouths, by reforming our evil Manners, the care of few.

sufferings since: Besides, you have been no small sufferer in these woes, chiefly in the fire, in reference to your own Concernments and your Relations: and therefore I conceive a Poem of the nature and design this is, may not be unacceptable to you.
And since I have had thoughts of making my Re∣flection on these things publick, thinking to contri∣bute something to the return of our prosperity, by turning if it may be, some from their iniquity, I have been glad hereby to catch the opportunity, to testifie to the world my due resentments of your manifold undeserved kindnesses; a grateful acknowledgment being the only requital I am able to make for all your accumulated favours, a poor requital indeed, when thus by paying my old score I run but farther into your debt, begging your acceptance from him, who remains
