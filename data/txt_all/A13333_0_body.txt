THE woorthines of this Author well knowen vnto your honor, putteth me in some hope of pardon for my presumption: in presenting vnto your Honors view, and crauing a fa∣uourable acceptance of my bold vn∣skilfulnes. For if Historie be the treasure of times past, and as well a guide, as image of mans present estate, a true and liuely pattern of things to come, and as some terme it, the work-mistresse of experience, which is the mother of prudence: Tacitus may by good right cha∣lenge the first place among the best. In iudgement there is none sounder, for instruction of life, for al times, to those which oft read him iudiciously, nothing yeel∣ding to the best Philosophers: no woord not loaden with matter, and as himselfe speaketh of Galba, he vseth Imperatoria breuitate: which although it breed difficul∣tie, yet carrieth great grauitie. I present him therfore to your Honors fauourable protection in regard of him∣selfe: but yet no otherwise then as a glasse, representing in liuely colours of prowesse, magnanimitie and coun∣sell; not onely woorthie personages of ages past and gone, but also your L. owne honorable vertues, wherof

the vvorld is both vvithes & iudge. If your L. vouch∣safe to receiue him (though greatly darkened of that he first was, and verie much dimmed in respect of the Hi∣storie alreadie in our toong) into any degree of fauour, I little doubt but others will both looke on him, and the better like and allow him; for here belovve we receiue either light or darkenes from aboue. Vespasians exam∣ple wrought more than a lawe: for obsequium in princi∣pes, and aemulandi amor, to speake with Tacitus, maketh that to be in greatest request, which perhaps in it selfe deserueth least. VVhatsoeuer my vnskilfull paines hath beene, my zeale and deuotion to your Honor I present vvith it; vnto whom I wish al good hap and fe∣licitie, with the accomplishment of vertues and Hono∣rable desires.
