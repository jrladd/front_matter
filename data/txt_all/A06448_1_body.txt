TVVo motiues, right wor∣shipfull
and vertuous La∣dy,
haue induced mee to
dedicate this short, but
sound and diuine exposition vp∣on
the one and fifty Psalme vnto
your most Christian Ladyship.
The first is, your tender care, &
louing regard extended to my
Loue, my deare and espoused Se∣cond
selfe. The other is, your
mindfulnes of my preferment,
which if your Ladiship shall ef∣fect,
I shall continue my Thank∣fulnes
for all curtesies, in more

spacious & ample manner. In the
meane season, let mee entreate
your VVorship, curteously to ac∣cept
this small Present.
The Lord Iesus, in whose hand
is the length of dayes, grant vnto
your Ladiship a long, peaceable,
and quiet life vpon earth, reple∣nished
with affluence of the best
thinges, especially of that one
thing, that our Sauiour in the 10
of Luke told Martha was need∣full;
Luke, 10. that you may instruct my
Mary to choose the good part,
which shal not be taken away from
her: that you with al the elect of
God, may be pertaker of that e∣uerlasting
ioy,Esay, 64. 1, Cor. 2. which neyther eye
hath seen, nor eare hath heard, nei∣ther
hath entred into mans heart.
From your Ladiships house nere
Dowgate in London this 24, of
Nouember. 1598.
