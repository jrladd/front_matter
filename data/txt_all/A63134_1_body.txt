IF I a Poet were, I'de undertake,
To write some Verses for the Authors sake.
And give him commendation for his pains
For I beleive, no more will be his gains.
For such men as do mind the publique good
Their merits are but slightly understood
Yet unto lasting age their fame shall bud.


The Author of this Book who took the care
Exactly to observe the great affair
Of this our Kingdome, which consists in Trade,
Of Clothes and Stuffes which of our Wooll are made,
Hath here the profit clearly shewn to us,
And what advantage yearly cometh thus
If we were wise to be industrious.


Together with the mischiess that do come
On the whole Kingdome by neglect of some,
And treachery of others which is worse,
(A heavier and more Prodigious curse
Cannot well lighten on the English Nation)
To send away our Wooll by Transportation,
This if not cur'd will bring to desolation.


As much as in them lies for selfish ends
Such bring destruction to their best friends,
First to the Soveraign Majesty of the King,
Then to the Common-wealth, for this doth bring
The Nation to be exceeding poor
And many Clothiers forced to give ore
Their Trading, and follow it no more.


But now I hope for better things to come
By the removal and displaceing some
Of those that were in trust, and put in such
As are upright, and won't comply with Dutch,
Nor any Forreign Nation to invade
The Ancient Priviledges of our Trade
The want hereof makes England greatly fade.





Goe little Book into the world and see
Who thou can'st find therein to welcome thee,
I'm sure thou mean'st as well to every man
Of all degrees and sorts as any can:
From King to meanest, thou dost wish them well
And therefore this thy Book doth truly tell
Of wrongs and of Abuses done to all.
Then let them in whose compass it may fall
Soon rectify the same, and bring on Trade
A fresh, this is the end this Book was made.
