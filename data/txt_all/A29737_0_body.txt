SIR,
THE Dedication of Chronicles hath in all times been thought worthy of the greatest Princes: Gulielmus Gemiticen∣sis writ a Chronicle of the Dukes of Normandy, and Dedicated it to Willi∣am the Conquerour. Thomas Walsing∣ham writ a Chronicle of the Kings of England, and De∣dicated it to King Henry the sixth: And of late time, Sir Francis Bacon, Viscount Saint Albans, and Lord Chancellour of England, writ a History of the Reigne of King Henry the seventh, and Dedicated it to Your Royall Grand-Father of blessed memory, King Iames: For indeed, as nothing makes Princes more Illustrious then Learning; So no Learning makes them more Ju∣dicious then History; Other Learning may fill their mindes with knowledge; This onely with Judgement: And seeing it is Judgement that must sit as President o∣ver all their Actions, it is fit that History should sit as President over all their Studies. History gives an An∣tedate to Time; and brings Experience without gray haires: Other Knowledges make You but see Quod antepedes est; History is the true perspective Glasse, that will make You see things afarre off: And though it

make not men to become Prophets, yet it makes their conjectures to be little lesse then Oracles But most Illustrious Prince, there accrues to your Highnesse, by this Chronicle, a greater benefit then all this; For if it were an Excitation of great force to vertue, to have it said, Et Pater Aeneas & Avunculus excitet Hector; of how great Force must it needes be, when You shall reade the Noble Acts of so many your worthy Proge∣nitors; Some Eternized for their valourous Atchieve∣ments in Warre: Some for their prudent government in Peace: Some Renowned for Mercy, some for Justice: And although the Example of your Royall Father be not amongst them, yet it may be sufficient that while you have the Acts of others upon Record, you have his under View, by which he seemes to say unto you, Disce Puer virtutem exme, verumque laborem; Fortunam ex a∣liis. And if in any of your Progenitors, there appeare, as it were Maculae in Orbe Lunae, will it not invite you to a higher Orbe, that Your Actions may shine with the clearer Beames? and then how happy will the eyes be, that shall see you sitting in your Throne? For my selfe, I should account it happinesse enough, that I have lived to see the dayes of your Illustrious Father; if it were not a great unhappines to see them overcast with clouds; & yet when these clouds shal be dispel'd, will it not make him shine with the greater Splendor? And this as old as I am, I doubt not to live my selfe to see, and having once seene it, shal then willingly say my Nunc Dimittis, and lave the joy of your glorious times for another Age: In the meane time prostrating my self humbly at your feet; and wishing to your Highnesse, as Diphobus did to Aeneas;—I Decus, I Nostrum, Melioribus utere Fatis.
