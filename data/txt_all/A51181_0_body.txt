MY LORD,
IF I have set down, the only opportunity I ever had of kis∣sing your Lordships Hands, amongst the happy Encounters of my Life, and take this occasion, so many Years after, to tell you so, your Lordship will not, I hope, think

your self injur'd by such a Decla∣ration from a Man that honours You; nor condemn my Ambition, when I publish to the World, that I am not altogether unknown to You. Your Lordship, peradven∣ture, may have forgot a Conver∣sation so little worthy your remem∣brance: but the memory of your Lordship's obliging fashion to me all that time, can never dye with me; and though my Acknowledg∣ment arrives thus late at you, I have never left it at home when I went abroad into the best Com∣pany. My Lord, I cannot, I would not flatter you, I do not think your Lordship capable of be∣ing flatter'd, neither am I inclin'd

to do it to those that are: but I cannot forbear to say, that I then receiv'd such an impression of your Vertue, and Noble Nature, as will stay with me for ever. This will either excuse the Li∣berty I presume to take in this Dedication, or, at least, make it no wonder; and I am so confi∣dent in your Lordships Genero∣sity, that I assure my self you will not deny your Protection to a Man whose greatest Publick Crime is that of an ill Writer. A bet∣ter Book (if there be a better of the kind (in the Original I mean) had been a Present more fitly suited to your Lordships Qua∣lity and Merit, and to my De∣votion:

I could heartily wish it such: but as it is, I lay it at your Lordship's Feet, together with
My Lord,
