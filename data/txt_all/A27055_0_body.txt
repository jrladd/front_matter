SIR,
THough your great Kindness and Care of the health of me and mine, much oblige me to you, and your Perso∣nal Worth much more, and your worthy Chil∣dren command my great Respect and Love; yet none of these should have moved me to say a word of all that I have said of your deceas∣ed Wife, which I had not verily believed to be true: And it was Gods Grace in her, which much more commanded it, than all my debt to you and yours.
She was so Exemplary, as that I think it my Duty for the good of others, to make this Pub∣lication of her Character, and of this Ser∣mon.
But one great Defect is here to be notified to the Reader, That almost all her secret way of Duty, and particular Converse is omitted, which you that were still with her, could have described; For I thought meet to say no more than I either knew my self, or was obvious and known to many.
The words which I heard but yesterday from the mouth of your Brother in discourse, were such as I doubt can be said of few, that in so many Years, from the hour of her Marriage, to her Death, she was never known to do one disobliging action, or speak one disobliging word, of or to any one of her Husbands Kindred or Relations.
Had it seemed meet to you, or to your worthy and ingenious Son, and your pious Daughter (the true image of her Mother) to have been the Describer of the Soul and Life, of this Exemplary Saint, how much more fully could you have done it, than I, that was so much less acquainted with her.
She is gone home, and you and I are at the door; The Lord give us so to live by Faith on the Promise and Love of God, and the things unseen, that thence we may daily fetch our ruling Motives, and stablishing Consolations, and not from a transitory deceitful world▪ and following Christ and his Saints under the Cross, may with them possess the incorruptible Crown; and be found at his Call among those that love his appearing, and be for ever with the Lord. Amen, Amen.
