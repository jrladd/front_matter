Most gracious and dread Soveraign,
THat ingenuous and true Loyalty which is due to your most Sacred Majesty (if it can yet be as du∣ly rendred) is the truest and surest foundation of the whole peoples civil happiness and safety.
That which is most opposite to that true Loyalty, is the late unchristian policy, most perniciously pra∣ctised in these Nations, upon the false ground of this most erroneous and seditious Principle, That the Supreme Political power is both originally from, and still inherent in the People.
In the Confutation whereof (which may by some other be much more irrefragably done.) All these persons that have from the very beginning of our late miseries) in any Way, or in any Capacity acted (directly or indirectly) against your Ma∣jesties Royal Father (of ever blessed and most precious me∣mory,) and against your most Sacred Majesties own Person and just Right, will find themselves not a little concerned. They will easily see, that, if this Principle be proved false, the only pretence of lawfulnesse for all their lawless actings is ut∣terly taken away. For even to themselves and to all other men it is most apparent, (if duly considered,) that from this Principle arose the Confidence or Pretence of lawfulness so, the most unlawful usurping of the power of the Militia, their taking Armes by their pretended Authority from the People, their making pretended Acts of Parliament without the Roy∣al Assent, their most impudent accusing and most scelerati∣ous
condemning of Your Majesties Royal Father expresly in the name of the People, and (which was the root of all the evil) their first Covenanting to alter the fundamentals of Govern∣ment, and to abolish that which stood fully established by all the Law of England without any Concurrence of the Royal Authority, and in a forcible and violent opposition against it; their Ejecting the whole House of Lords, and most unrighte∣ous banishing of Your most Sacred Majesty, upon pretence of sole Soveraignty in the People, whose Representatives they would (even in despight of the
People) be then esteemed; For all which unrighteous practises, and many other, most nefa∣riously perpetrated against all Law Divine and Humane, the Authors, Actors, Abettors, and Approvers have no other pretence of Apology, (by which they yet continue in impe∣nitency,) besides their own Opinion or Dissimulation of this most false, Antiscriptural, and most seditious Principle. There∣fore any confutation of this, will, perhaps, irritare crabrones, too much irritate the whole nest of Hornets, with all their dis∣loyal and Antichristian Faction; there being but little hope of more than forced Repentance from them that have sinned wilfully after they had received the knowledge of the truth; and hence it is, there is so little appearance yet of any such thing. How seasonable therefore such a Corrosive may be to that old Sore that is but newly skinn'd, it is not easie for any private person to determine. Yet the Conscience of my necessary du∣ty to serve God and Your Majesty, and to defend Your most Sacred Authority (in my way) to the uttermost of my power hath enforced me to this Endeavour; which I most humbly submit to Your Majesties Censure, pleasure and Pardon, as becomes
