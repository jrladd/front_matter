MADAM,
AS never any Stranger
was more oblig'd than
I, unto the King your
Father, of glorious
Memory; so never any had great∣er
desire than I, to make acknow∣ledgement
of it to your Majesty: but
living in obscurity, retyr'd from
the light of Court; and making

no Figure there, I imagined it
would have no Grace for such a
shadow and Cypher as I, to pre∣sent
my self unto your Majesty;
and other presents I had none,
but onely this, which by its little∣ness,
shews the greatness of my de∣sire
to declare my self,
MADAM,
