Gentlemen,
THis little Piece is dedicated to you by a true Lover of
your Souls, being an Abstract with Remarks, of an
excellent Sermon formerly preached by your now Reverend
Doctor, as a Test of whose Veracity this is presented to you.
And as it is hoped you will be careful to examine the Doc∣trines
of your Preachers by the Word of God, the holy Scrip∣tures,
which is the prime and chief Rule to try the Doctrines
of Men by (like the noble Bereans, who search'd the Scrip∣tures
whether those things were so; i. e. Whether the Doc∣trines
of the Apostles did agree with that Rule and Standard,)
so likewise that you will consult as a subordinate Rule, the
Books and Writings of your said Reverend Doctor (to whose
Conduct you have resign'd your Souls) which he made and
wrote before these Backsliding and Apostate Times; wherein
Men have learn'd to prevaricate, and prefer their Interest to
their Duty, (your Spiritual Guides themselves having stum∣bled
and fallen,) that you may be the better able to judg
whether he gives you the true Interpretation of the holy
Text, according to the Analogy of Gospel Faith and Man∣ners,
or preaches , another Gospel, which will
Anathematize an Apostle or an Angel, it being your Duty to
hold fast the Form of sound Words, and to be Followers of
Men as far as they are of Christ.
You'll pardon this Address, coming from one who seeks not
yours but you; and who is,
Gentlemen, Nov. 6. 1693.
