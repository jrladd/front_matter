THis Author is by Face wholly unknown to us; but we have with much satisfa∣ction and delight perused his ensuing Treatise, finding it to be solid and judicious, and full of Scripture-light and strength, and singularly adapted and suited to enlighten and establish plain Christians, whose Consciences are de∣termined by, and Faith bottomed on the Scriptures.
As to his Opinion, that nothing should be sung in Publick Worship but Scripture Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, thereby ex∣cluding Hymns of humane composure by a private Gift, which some sing in their solemn Assemblies; We do freely concur with him; and heartily wish that those who practise other∣wise, would a little better consider what they do. We know not any thing that such can alledge for their way, seeing God hath fur∣nished us with such a full supply of Spiritu∣tual Songs of his own inditing, and seeing there is not any intimation in the Scripture that it was ever practised among the People of God of old.
