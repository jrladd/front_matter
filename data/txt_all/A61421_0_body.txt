SIR,
WHEN I first came in to you to Sherborn, I came with as much Ap∣petite, though in an infirm Condi∣tion, to engage in the same Cause with you, as I could have done to a good Meal when an hungred. And though you are now set∣led in the Throne, and the Storms of War which then threatned this Nation, long since blown over: Yet I have reason to believe I may run some Danger in what I now do for the Service of your Majesty and my Country. And though I doubt not of the Protection of Almighty God, and the powerful Supports of Truth, Justice, and a good Conscience; yet because it is my Duty to neglect no honest Means for my Safety and Quiet, having here performed an Act of Great Fidelity to your Majesty, and the Go∣vernment of my Country, I do claim as my Right
the Protection of both for my self, and my Labours. I have not written one Syllable which I do not be∣lieve to be true; nor have I forborn a Word, which I thought pertinent to my Subject, and necessary to your Service. And this being done, not out of Dis∣content for any Disappointment Ʋnworthily sugge∣sted, not without the Check of his own Conscience, by the Writer of the Vin∣dication. p. 30. in quest of some Place, (for I ne∣ver sought any, though I my self, with Five Sons, are all ready to serve you, if you please to command it) nor to serve any Faction or Party; but sincere∣ly to preserve one of the Noblest Governments in the World, (as I have long thought it) to serve a Just and Noble Cause, (as I have else where, though briefly, proved) to serve my Country, to serve your Majesty, and, which is above all, to serve Almighty God, is such an Act of Fidelity, as is too rare to be met with in this Nation at this time: And I know you cannot desert me in it, without deserting (more or less) all that I have endeavoured to serve: Nor can any one hurt or molest me (an innocent Man, and endeavouring to do good) without bringing greater hurt upon themselves: Whereof he who gave occasion of this Writing may be an Example:) And besides, without striking at your Majesty and the Government, to say no more.
For the same intent and purpose, besides what I have said in the following Sheets in common, I must
crave the Favour of a few Words to your self in par∣ticular: God by his Providence has brought you to one (as I said) of the Noblest Governments in the World: That You and these Nations may enjoy the Compleat Benefit of so great a Favour, these things, I will presume to say, are necessary, nay absolutely necessary, on your part. First, That you be very careful to keep up such a firm and quick Sense of the Providence of God in these things, that your Heart be neither so lifted up with any high Conceit of your self for what you have already gotten, nor so involved in Cares and Endeavours to keep that, or get more, that you forget him, and either take up with the Enjoyment of these things, and neglect the further Prosecution of his Service; or deserting your Confidence in him, decline to vulgar Policies for your own Security or Advantage.
Secondly, That often contemplating the uncon∣ceivable Excellence of the Divine Majesty, which hath given Being to, and governs this vast Uni∣verse, whereof the whole Earth is in comparison of the rest but a Point, and raising your Soul above these transient things which the Vulgar admire, you look upon the Acceptance of a Crown as an Act of Cha∣rity to poor Mortals, but your only true Glory to con∣sist in the Approbation of that excellent Majesty, and of his Glorious, though to us Mortals Invisible, Ministers. Such as is the Applause and Admiration
of the Rabble to a great King; such, and no more, is the Applause and Admiration of the greatest of Mortals to a truly Wise Man, without the Appro∣bation of the Celestial Spectators.
Thirdly, That assuring your self that you are rai∣sed up by the Providence of this Glorious Majesty for his Service in these Nations at least, if not further, you generously prosecute the same with all Fidelity, according to his Will and Pleasure, that is, his Eternal Laws of Righteousness, his Express Instructi∣ons and Commands, and the Constitution and just Laws of this Government and Nation, which is the special Ordinance of God for this People, that is, ordered and preserved by his Providence.
Fourthly, That for that purpose you generously and faithfully endeavour to improve all the Advan∣tages put into your Hand, and Talents committed to your Trust, for the Honour of his Name, Wor∣ship, Laws and Institutions; that is, the Exempla∣ry Authority of your Royal Person, and of your Royal Family, (conniving at no vitious Persons there, though otherwise never so great or necessary) the Dispensations of your Honours and Favours, and the strict Execution of the Laws, which is your proper part in the Government. The doing of this magnanimously, slighting the vulgar Prudentials of Animal Polititians, is that which in the Sacred Scrip∣ture is called Faith, and highly recommended. But to
boggle at any of this, will be dangerous to you, and may produce as great Disappointments as those of the last Year, and make your Counsels prove Abor∣tive, and it may be as destructive as King James's did by the like means. You have begun well in your Letter to the Bishops; but the like Care is to be taken that the Laws be strictly executed by the Judges and Civil Magistrates. Nor would this De∣base, but Improve your Military Discipline, and make it more prosperous and successful.
Fifthly, That to this end and purpose also you in∣form your self, as well as may be, concerning the true Constitution of the English Government, and your own Part therein, that you neither neglect, nor exceed your Duty, or fall into any of the unhappy Mis∣carriages of some of your Predecessors, but wisely and religiously contenting your self with what has been conferred upon you, and justly belongs to you, to the others you generously secure to each their own.
Sixthly, That for Information in these matters you rely upon no private or secret Counsellors, but in the Intervals of Parliament, consult the Privy Council and Judges; and the great Council of the Nation, as soon as may be: This it was which raised you to the Throne. It is their Interest to preserve the Her∣nour and Majesty of the Monarchy, and they will cer∣tainly do it. And it was nothing but the Craft of ill Men, who kept our late Brinces in continual Jen∣lousies,
of Parliaments, to hold up a Faction for their own Advantage.
Seventhly, That if upon good Information you find that this is a mixt Government, composed of the Three Simple Forms, the Enquiring Part belonging more specially to the Commons, the Judiciary to the Lords, the Consultary and Legislative to the King, Lords and Commons, and the Executive to the King, which I believe is the truth, upon this Considera∣tion, you look upon the Whole as one great Body, whereof your self is indeed the Head in Honour and Degree, but in effect rather the Hand, or if you will, the Right Hand; but however a Part: And therefore that you always retain a great Respect for this Noble Body, treating them with all Honour and Affection, reputing their Honour and Interest your own, as Yours is Theirs, and will be so treated by them, if a fair Correspondence be kept up be∣tween you; which will make you not only beloved at home, but dreaded abroad.
Eightly, That you be very tender and cautious of invading their Rights, or neglecting their Counsel, in any matter of Importance; but especially of holding up any Favourites against them; and to that end that you be very jealous of that Generation, and those particular Persons, who have been the Authors or Propagators of False Notions concerning the Con∣stitution of this Government, or of Evil Counsels
and Courses among your Predecessors; and more especially those, who have already by any Evil Coun∣sels or Unfaithfulness in not well informing you, betray'd your self into any Inconvenience: Whereof, if you please to command me, I shall be ready to give you some plain Instances.
Ninthly, That you endeavour wisely to compose the Dissentions, and allay the Heats and Animosities of the Nation, and to unite all in a mutual Assistance for the Common Interest. Our Divisions, and the Heats of our Dissentions, are for the most part the Re∣liques of Popish Practices, and Effects of Evil Policies of Courtiers. These have both conspired for different ends to divide us both in Church and State, and to impose upon the People; so that it is the truest Wisdom and greatest Interest of this Na∣tion to endeavour so much the more for an Union; and to that end to detect their Impostures. This Government is in truth a Noble Commonwealth in the Root and Body, accommodated with the Ad∣vantage, and adorned with the Honour and Majesty of a Monarchy in the Execution. Crafty Men ob∣serving this, have practis'd the Division in this man∣ner. First, By putting the Kings upon illegal Pro∣jects, till that produced Jealousies of Arbitrary De∣signs, and then improving those to the raising of the like Jealousies in those unhappy Kings of Republi∣can Conspiracies. Thus were multitudes imposed
upon: Whereas the Subversion of the Commonwealth to support the Monarchy, is no less Foily, Madness and Treachery in an English Man, than is the pulling down the Monarchy to support the Commonwealth. Nor can any thing endanger our Monarchs but them∣selves, by adhering to Evil Counsellors, rejecting or declining the Advice of the Great Council of the Na∣tion, and violating their Rights.
Lastly, That to this purpose you avoid all Favour and Encouragement to any Faction; and make no other difference between Persons, but what the Law hath made; except only between the Virtuous and the Vitious, and between such as may safely be trusted, and such as may not, (for which end for Parliament-Men, and persons admitted to great Offices of Trust, and Bishops, a Recognition by Act of Parliament may be necessary;) but by a constant tenor and course of your Actions demonstrate a cordial and universal Affection to All, and a great Zeal and Activity for the Service of God, and for the Peace, Safety and Prosperity of the Nation.
By these Means you will be a compleat King, and rule in the Hearts of the People: These will pro∣duce in them such a Trust and Confidence in you, as will make your Government exceeding easie; and such a Government will make your Name Honou∣rable in the Roll of our English Kings: But if you once set up for a Separate Interest, strike-in
with, and make your self the Head of any Faction, give your self up to the Conduct of particular Fa∣vourites, suffer the Publick Revenue and the Trea∣sure of the Nation to be squandred away without any Account, and the People to be injur'd by Ex∣actions and Delays of Officers, and tread in the steps of your Predecessors of the last Race, you will ipso facto cease to do the part of a King, violate the Trust reposed in you, and your Coronation Oath; and deceiving the Expectations of all Men, after such a Succession of Kings, raise such Prejudice against Monarchy it self, as may indanger this Noble Government, and the Settlement of the Nation, and make your Name inglorious to all Posterity. But these are things so inconsistent with the Reasons, for which you was invited hither, the Causes of your Expedition expressed in your own Declaration, the Ends for which the Crown was first offered to you, and after set upon your Head, the Honour and Safety of your Government, and, which is more than all, the Righteous Laws of God, (who, as we hope, raised you up to be an Instrument of Mercy, not of Ven∣geance to This Nation) as no Man, who believes the Character we have received of your great Vertue, can easily fear from you, though the notorious Mis∣carriages of the late Reigns may have left some Im∣pressions upon the Minds of some, which yet I hope Experience of your Prudence and Justice will
totally expunge. And I pray God give you (as I hope he will) true Wisdom to know Him, to discern His Hand in these things, and what He expects from you; to know what is your proper Part in this great Affair, and to be more careful to discharge it well, than to enlarge it beyond its just Bounds; and that all true Happiness may always attend your Majesty.
