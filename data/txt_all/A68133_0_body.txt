RIGHT HON:
FInding these Pa∣pers
amongst o∣thers
lying aside
in my Fathers study,
whereof I conceiued
good vse might bee
made, in regard of that
Spirituall aduantage

which they promised; I
obtayned of him good
leaue to send them a∣broad,
whereto he pro∣fessed
himselfe the
more easily induced,
for that his continuall
and weighty imploy∣ments
in this large and
busie Diocesse will not
yet afford him leasure
to dispatch those his o∣ther
fixed Meditations
on the Historie of the
new Testament; In the
meane time, the expres∣sions
of these voluntary
and sudden thoughts of
his, shall testifie how

fruitfully he is wont to
improoue those short
ends of time, which
are stolne from his
more important auoca∣tions;
and (vnlesse my
hopes faile mee) the
Patterne of them may
prooue not a little be∣neficiall
to others. Holy
mindes haue been euer
wont to looke through
these bodily obiects,
at spirituall, and hea∣uenly;
So SVLPITIVS
reports of S. MARTIN,
that seeing a Sheepe
newly shorne, he could
say; Loe here's one that

hath performed that
command in the Gos∣pell;
hauing two Coats
shee hath giuen away
one, & seeing an Hog∣heard
freezing in a
thinne suite of skinnes;
Loe (said hee) There
is Adam cast out of Pa∣radise,
and seing a mea∣dow,
part rooted vp,
part whole; but eaten
downe; and part flou∣rishing,
hee said, The
first was the state of
Fornication, the second
of Marriage, the third
of Virginity: But what
doe I seeke any other

authour, then the Lord
of Life himselfe? Who
vpon the drawing of
water from the well of
SHILO, on the day of
the great Hosanna,
tooke occasion to speak
of those Liuing waters,
which should flow frō
euery true beleeuer,
Iohn 7. 37; and vpon oc∣casion
of a bodily feast▪
Luke 14. entred into
that Diuine discourse of
Gods gracious inuita∣tion
of vs to those Spi∣rituall
viands of grace
and glory. Thus, mee
thinkes, we should still

bee climing vp in our
thoughts, from Earth
to Heauen; and suffer
no obiect to crosse vs
in our way without
some Spirituall vse, and
application; Thus it
pleased my Reuerend
Father sometimes to
recreate himselfe, whose
manner hath beene,
when any of these Me∣ditations
haue vnsought
offerd themselues vnto
him, presently to se
them downe; a course
which I wish had beene
also taken in many
more, which might no

doubt haue beene very
profitable.
These, as they are, I
send forth vnder your
Honourable Name, out
of those many respects,
which are, in an heredi∣tary
right, due to your
Lordship, as being ap∣parent
heire to those
two singular Patrons
of my iustly Reueren∣ced
Father, The emi∣nent
vertue of which
your noble Parents in a
gracious Succession
yeelds to your Lord∣ship
an happy example;
which to follow is the

onely way to true Ho∣nour;
For the dayly
increase whereof here;
and the euerlasting
crowne of it hereafter,
his prayers to God shal
not be wanting, who
desires to bee
accoun∣ted.
