My Lord,
THO' I could have wish'd that the Gentleman to whom the following Papers are directed, had prevented me in the Trouble I am now giving You; yet I cannot but lay hold on this Mournful Occasion, to acquaint the World what a Share it has in Your Lordship's Loss, and what a Concern the Muses should have shewn, who have seen it so visible in Your Lordship.
A general Silence indeed shews the Consternation to be also General; our Silence among those whose very Sorrows should speak, Silence a∣mong Men of a Profession who are not us'd to hold their Peace in Ex∣cesses of Ioy or Grief, is much more a Crime than an Inadvertency; and if I am late in my Offerings to the Memory of the deceas'd Noble Lord, Your Lordship's Father, it is out of the respect I bear to it, having been in hopes some Pen or other of a more establish'd Reputa∣tion would have acknowledg'd it self a Debtor, tho' it could never dis∣charge the Debt, and have made an Attempt towards the Description of those Vertues which no Describer can do that Justice to which They deserve.
The Vniversity near which He liv'd, and the City in which He dy'd, had both of 'em Gentlemen, who being of Merit Themselves, were ca∣pable of setting it out in Others; and if both had employ'd Them∣selves in recommending those Vertues to our Practice, which are so deserving of our Esteem, they had not laid under the Imputation of being idle, as well as ungrateful.
Their Remissness, My LORD, has added Wings to my Diligence; and tho' I am sensible Your Lordship's Father's Character is fall'n into ill hands, yet rather than not say something of One, who deserves to have so much said of Him, I must put in for a Petitioner to Your Lordship,

and beg Your Acceptance of a Present, which has nothing but the Zeal of its Donor to recommend it to Your Lordship's Hands. That the Great Man who gives Being to the following Poem, by losing His own, was Loyal to His PRINCE, and Affectionate to His COVNTRY, unwearied in His Alms, and incessant in His Prayers, deserving the Highest Honours from His KING, yet retir'd from COVRTS to commune with His GOD, are Excellencies worthy of His Muse whom the following Poem is perswading to the Recital of 'em; and there will want nothing to add to their Perfection, and crown 'em with their due Commendations, after I shall have said, He was Your Lordship's FATHER. For to give Being to a Gentleman who is exercis'd in preserving that of others, is as great as if the Noble Lord continued to preserve them Himself; and what was reckon'd as a Com∣pliment in the Poet to the greatest of Emperors, viz.
—Nec enim de CAESARIS actis
Vllum Majus opus, quam quod Pater extitit Hujus.
may be very applicable to Your Lordship, and receiv'd for a Truth.
But I am running into the Character of a Gentleman, who has Me∣rit enough to lose me in it; I shall therefore only add my Wishes. That Your Lordship may continue the Pursuit of those Paths, which Your Lordship's Deceas'd Father has mark'd out for You, That Your Lordship's Noble Brothers may still practice those Vertues, which They have already given such Specimens of: And that Your Lordship may be an Honour to that NAME which has furnish'd us with as many Instances of its being Illustrious, as it has Owners, is the hearty Prayer of,
My LORD,
