THe suff'ring SouldiEr, that with sliGhted pray'r,
Has Often sought His just Arrears of war,
Shows his Maim'd boDy to the gazing Croud,
ProclAims his services and Wants aloud;
Is pity'D and whEne'r the story's nam'd,
The valour's prAis'd, and the iNjustice damn'd;
So all by whoM Amintor'S Love is read,
Will praise his Faith and blaMe the cruel Maid.
While by this Name secuR'd, more close tO veil
YouR blushing guilt, Against your self yoU rail;

PerhaPs the fRequeNt cheat may Make you kind,
And with your language Change yOur cruel miNd.
Strong NatUre does LovEs secret Paths oRdain,
But Pow'rful custom doeS o're NAture reign.
And those coMplaints wHich singly wanted Art,
May thus unitEd, melt yoUr fRosen heart.
Swift time maY bring the blessings Chance deny'd,
And we May glory in thoSe cHains we hide.
Pardon mY daring hopeS—
And do Not what your Beauty mAde despIse;
If to onE soaring thought—My faNcy rise,
It Was inspir'd—By Celia's ch Arming eyeS.
