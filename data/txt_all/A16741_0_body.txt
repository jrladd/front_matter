RIght Honorable, matter of most worth, to most worthy mindes, is most worthily presented. What matter, in worth may compare with di∣uine meditation? What minde more worthy honour, then the heauenly enclined? and whose minde more truly worthy of that blessed Title, then your Ladiships, I would there were many; but I know too fewe. Being thn, in that excellent sense, truly your selfe, whom (for more worth, then I will speake of) the wise admire, the lear∣ned followe, the vertuous loue, and the honest serue; vouchsafe me leaue among those poore people, that being throwen from the world, looke only towards heauen & heauenly graces, to lay before your eyes a diuine humour of a rauisht soule: which (be∣ing aboue it selfe caried into the heauenly meditations of the mercies of the Almightie) by the blessing of his Holy Spirit, hath brought forth such fruits of his praise, as I hope wil be plea∣sing to your good fauour. To the honour of whose commaunde∣ment auowing the duty of my hearts seruice, in al humble thāk∣lnesse for your bountifull vndeserued goodnesse, praying for your eternall happinesse, I take my leaue.
