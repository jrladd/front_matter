IF what is truly Morall, serious, graue,
May (clad in Rimes) but gracious fauour haue:
From your Right worthy selfe, then am I crown'd,
As if with Laurell, for in you abound
All that make man compleate; t' is you therefore
That my Muse for her Patron doth implore:
T'was by your meanes that I was first instructed
In Grammer learning, since which time inducted
To some more knowledge, I most humbly pray
You, to accept this Tributarie pay,
From him (who though his Muse) bee yet vnnoted,
Vowes all her studies are to you deuoted.
Nor should it bee a blemish to your Fame,
To haue these Pages waite vpon your Name.
