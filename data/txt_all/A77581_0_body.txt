Since Madam,
BOth your Bloud, and Vertues do so strong∣ly Intitle you to this well-limb'd Piece; it would be a stain upon the Publisher,

to enshrine it to any other Name but yours. Who can protect the story of a Sidney, but a Sidney's Name? Thus his Matchless Poem, seem'd providentially by him impa∣tronag'd unto his Peerless Sister. And this (Madam) being another of his meaner Monuments, disdains Ad∣dress to any other Alliance but his own. Here at your feet (by no despicable Pen) the History of our Nations Won∣der lies; Whose large spread

Fame, your noble Meene im∣proves, and convinces the World of this Truth, That not only the Endowments of Nature, but even the Enoble∣ments of the Mind, and Ge∣nius, are many times inherent in the Bloud and Linage. Some Families are privileg'd from Heaven in Excellen∣cies, which now and then in particular Branches, like new Stars, appear and beautifie the sphere they shine in. And doubtless if the departed into

Happiness, have any know∣ledge of our humane Vicissi∣tudes, his gallant Soul looks down with Contentment, to see the Honour of his House continued in your unblemisht Merit. Which, taking all, may excuse the presumption that I can be charged with, who not pretending to the Au∣thorage, have thought I could not doe more right, either to him, or the subject of the dis∣course, than to inscribe it to Her, who like day in this Ec∣clipse

of Honour, enlight∣ning our Western Orb, hath ambition'd me to make this offering from,
Madam,
