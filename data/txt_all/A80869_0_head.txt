TO THE VVORSHIPFUL ROBERT COCKRAM Esquire, his honoured Patron; with the rest of my constant Audiâˆ£tours in the Town and Parish of Columpton, The dew of Heaven be your portion, as the beauty and fatnesse of the earth is your habitation: grace, mercy and peace be upon the heads and hearts of you all, that love Christ Jesus in sincerity.
