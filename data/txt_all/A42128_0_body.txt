MADAM,
I Humbly Confess, It is a great Presumption in Me, to Offer any thing to a Person of so Great Majesty and Judgment; but the Assu∣rance I have of Your excellent Dispo∣sition

to favour the Meanest Thing from a good Intention (besides the Greatness of Your Charity towards many of my Relations) gives me this Encourage∣ment.
I am confident of Your Highnesses readiness to promote the Peace of All People; which makes me conclude, That whatever is tending thereunto, will be graciously Accepted.
One of Your Deceased Servants hath often told me of Your Highnesses Zeal to God, and to Your Country; which nothing here below can sufficiently Re∣quite; therefore I doubt not, but the Almighty will give You the Fruits of Peace, which can only answer so much Piety and Goodness.
It is impossible, but there must be Diversity of Opinions so long as the World endures; Mens Dispositions being

generally as various as their Tempers and Complexions; but methinks this should not cause Difference in Affection, which is the only thing that gives Occa∣sion to our needless Quarrels and Super∣stitious Scruples: To prevent which, it must be the Work of Heaven only.
And so far as it may be lawful for me to Judge. I think there can be No∣thing more proper than to consider, how agreeable the Constitution of Our Church is to the Commands of GOD; which all must of Necessity comply with, if they would but lay aside all Passion and Pre∣judice, which hath all along given Birth and Growth to our Divisions. And it is sad to think, That our Gall-less Reli∣gion should by this means he Entituled to so much War and Bloodshed.
It is a Blessed Thing to be an Instru∣ment of Peace, and the least Hopes of

promoting it is very pleasing to the Minds of all Good Men; and I am sure Your Highness will to the uttermost Encourage it, having always the Fruits of it in Your own Breast.
That Your HIGHNESS may always continue Stedfast and Un∣moveable, (as You have hitherto done) and in the End obtain Everlasting Life, is the Hearty Prayer of,
MADAM,
Your Highnesses Most Humble, and Most Obedient Servant,
