IN all humility, I present this Book to your Majesty, and to you Most Reverend, Right Reverend, Archbishop, Bishops, Deans and Doctors of the Church of England: 'Tis no wonder I joyn your Illustrious Majesty with persons spiritual, because as well the Head must not be separated from the Members, as the Nou∣rishers of the Church, from them who are the

Light of the World, and the builders of Jeru∣salem.
I beseech (therefore) your Most Sacred Ma∣jesty to accept of this present (as Cyrus did of a little cold water from his Subject) And you spiritual Lords, as a testimony of my true Con∣version.
