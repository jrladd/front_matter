IT is no newe
thinge in these
latter daies of
the world now
first put in vre,
but for long continuance a∣mong
all sortes of the learned
a most ancient custome, to de∣dicate
their labours vnto some
one or moe, who in respect of
their virtue, zeale, wisedome,
athority, or one consideration
or other them inciting, are

deemed worthy the patro∣nage
of the same. In the doing
whereof, as in all other things,
if a good fore-sight be not v∣sed,
by obseruation I doe find
that the recompense is either
priuie scoffes, or open, either
scornes of the wicked, or
blame and reprehension of the
godly: the former they come
by which without all regard of
their patrons disposition, hand
ouer head, doe dedicate
good bookes vnto ill men; the
latter, that blush not to offer
ill bookes vnto good men: the
former he gat (to leaue exam∣ples
of this time) which vnto
Antigonus, being then in
Armes, presented a booke of
Iustice, as though warriers
were not to thinke of Iustice
in time of warre: the latter they
purchase who dedicate ouer∣boldly
the carnall books of Italie,

and other vaine inuentions,Aschams. school. 1 booke pa. 26. b.
vnto vertuous and honorable per∣sonages.
The greater the danger is
by misse-dedicating, the grea∣ter
should bee mens care both
of the matter which they pub∣lish,
and of the persons who
are to patronize their doings;
least for want of good patrons
they bee discouraged by ill
wordes, or thorough diuulga∣ting
ill matter, especially vn∣der
the names of good men,
they heare ill, and deserued∣ly.
I am bold, worshipfull, to
gratulate your good and safe
returne from those daunge∣rous
places and persons, with
this treatise ensuing: and as I
know it is not in your natures,
who are no Antigonists, to re∣iect
it, as comming out of sea∣son:
so I haue good hope that

the godly wise, as many of
them alreadie haue, will ap∣proue
the same by their good
acceptation, the matter be∣ing
sounde, and most necessa∣ry
to bee reade and regarded
of all sortes of men in these
loose daies of the world. Yet
because the disposition of ma∣ny
is so peruerse and croo∣ked,
that oftentimes euen
good thinges are contem∣ned,
because the doers of
them are not liked; and they
whose hands haue beene in
this worke, are diuerse, especi∣ally
for religion, the author
being of one, and my selfe of
another; I thinke it very ne∣cessarie
something to say in
this place, that neither the
good Christians may shunne
this as a Serpent, because of the
author a PapistF. Dic∣go de Stella of the order S. Ir.; nor the
papistes condemne it, as here∣ticall,

in respect of my selfe, a
Protestant. For seeing the
ground, subiect, and substance
of the booke is such, as both of
vs, yea all the wisest of both
sidesdoe agree in, namely that
the world, and the vanities there∣of
are to bee contemned, me∣thinkes
the circumstance of
persons is not so to bee regar∣ded,
as that any sound perswa∣sions
vnto godlinesse, and vn∣to
the crucifying of our selues
to the world, whosoeuer doe
moue them, should bee despi∣sed,
especially when such care
hath beene had, as neither any
thing is added which might
either grieue, or nusle the Pa∣pist
in superstition, nor any
thing left out, but what would
offend the godly Christian, if
it were still in; nor any thing
published, but may like them,
whosoeuer they bee, as haue

growne, and would more and
more, into a detestation of
this world, and the vanities of
the same.
If any aduersaries doe say,
that much I haue ommitted,
and therefore take offence: I
answere, the thing is more o∣pen
than that I can deny it,
and my grounds so good, that
I neither am, neither neede to
be ashamed for so doing. For
hath nature taught the Bee out
of all flowers to chuse those as
are meetest to minister the
sweete hony and waxe, and to
leaue the rest? and shall not
grace mooue Christians to
make choise of that which
may bee to the comfort and
profit of the Church of God?
Haue Carpenters such wise∣dome,
as they will not build
with euery tree, but chuse one,
and leaue another, as may bee

most for the profite of the
builder, the safetie of the inha∣biters,
and their owne credite;
and shall not the spirituall
builders haue the same for the
edifying of the house of God?
Shall the holy Spirite com∣mand
vs to Trie the Spirits1. Ioh. 4. verse 1.,
to Trie al, and keep that which1. Thes. 5. vers 21.
is good, and are such commen¦ded
that would receiue no
more, no not of the Apostles
wordes than could be iustified
by the Scriptures of GodActs. 7 10. 11.,
and shall they bee blamed
which obey so holy a com∣mander,
and imitate such di∣uine
examples?
But Authors must haue
their wordes, and Readers are
to vse their iudgement in re∣fusing,
or taking as shall bee
most for their behoofe.
The Philosophers many of
them wrote much, yet is it law∣full

for Christians, in the iudg∣ment
of S. AustineLib. 2. de doctri∣na christi∣ana., to take
from them, as from vniust de∣tainers,
the riches of true wis∣dome
which they enioy, and
translate the same into the tre∣surie
of the Church of God.
For whatsoeuer the Philoso∣phers
and Poets did writ that
was vnsound, it came of them∣selues;
but, saith TertulianIn Apo∣bloget.,
whatsoeuer they published that
was good, they either drew it im∣mediatly
from the holy Scriptures,
or they learned the same of them
which had reade the word of God.
That which the Fathers haue
thought of the Philosophers
and Poets, we may iudge of all
other aliens from the Church
and heretikes; and therefore
we doe them no wrong, when
we take but the trueth, which
is our owne, and leaue them
the errors, wherein wee haue

none interest.
Againe, whasoeuer is saide
of our aduersaries, sure I am
the time was and still is, that
they themselues do so much as
we doe to others: so that with
what wordes they doe either
commend their own, or dislike
our doings, with the very same
they cōmend vs, & condemne
themselues. For, in proofe here∣of
though I might aleadge the
oet Martial purged by Ed∣mondus
Augerius a Iesuit: & of
our owne writers among o∣thers
the tables of Spangenberge
not reformed, but deformed in
many things by Villamicentius
a Frier; & of there own sid Ludo¦uicus
Viues, whose goldē locks
are shaken off, as were Samsons
by dalila, euen by the deuines of
Louaine (sufficient profes that
if they haue done well therein
we do not ill that do the very

same which they doe, or if wee
doe ill they cannot be iustified
which doe to others, either
more then we will offer, or as
much as we do vnto any of thē)
yet this very booke shal suffice
for all, which is so translated
both by G. C. into English, &
by Petrus Burgundus into La∣tine,
both following one and
the same Italian translatiō (for
the Author himselfe was a Spa¦niard
R. P. Fr Didaci Stellae, Hispani &c. saith Bur∣gundu., and wrote in the
Spanish tongeRecen∣ter ex His¦pani ca¦lingua in alicam. traducti per Hiere¦miam For resti, &c▪ thongh in the preface of G. C. it is said to be written in the Spa¦nish or I∣talian language doubtful∣ly., that hee
which hath but one eye, suffici∣ently
may perceiue that either
the English is meruailously
augmēted, which hath a great
deale more than the Latine; or
the Latine hath left out very
much for it is but an Epitome.
or an Abstract, as it were, in
respect of the English. Nowe
if G. C. hath truely expressed the
letter, and deliuered the Authors

minde faithfully, which he trauai∣led
to do both for his owne honestie,
and the Readers satisfactionG. C in the pre∣face to his translat.,
surely Burgundus hath neither
truely expressed the letre, nor
faithfully deliuered the authors
minde, and so neither dealt ho∣nestly
with the Author, nor sa∣tisfied
the christian Reader for
he wonderfully varieth frō the
English, not onely in respect
of the letre, but so in respect of
the matter, as if purposely it
were done to shred off many
things that were superfluous, I
say not onely in the English,
but also in the authenticall
copy. Again if Burgundus haue
done well (for he is but a tran∣slator
netherEx Ita∣lica in La∣tinā trā∣slati, a re∣uerendo petro Bur¦gundo., and no para∣phrase)
then doubtlesse G. C.
is much to blame which inser∣ted
so much, I say not simply
matter, but errors too, as are
not to be read in the Latine co∣pie.

Now whether of them
haue dealt the more sincerely I
leaue it to their iùdgement
which haue the Italian & the
Spanish copies & the Authors
owne wordes, which I neither
haue, nor can get: but their
owne doings, as they haue, &
may, I trust, deliuer me from
blame, so they troubled me in
such sort when I tooke this
worke in hand, that I was en∣forced
to vse a Christian liber∣tie
in the doing hereof, & ther¦by
to cul from them both such
things as were for the bene∣fit
of the Church: and in them
both to ouerpasse whatsoeuer
was to much redounding in
words, or otherwise erronious
for matter, & out of thē both
to frame such a treatice, varie∣ing
so little as might bee from
the Authors purpose, as shold
be profitable or the Church

of God, and offensiue to none
that haue any sparkles of true
wisdome in their mindes.
And though the diuersitie
of translations, and in the trā∣slations
the great diuersitie had
not moued: yet the errors were
so many, and the scriptures in
many places so vainely appli∣ed,
so vntuly expounded, so
dangerously wrested▪ and ma∣ny
things so falsesly collected
from the word of God both
in the English, & also in the La¦ten
copp (as any may perceiu
by those Tables ānexed to the
end of this book) that howso∣euer
they might be tolerated
if the book were of cōtrouersies
in Religiō, yet being purposely
penned, to stir vp the affectiōs
of Christians to the loue of God
and of heauenly thinges, I
cold not discharge the duty
of a true seruant in the house

of God, if I did not both cut
off many thinges which they
had, and vse an extraordinary
liberty in citing, expounding,
applying, alleaging of Scrip∣ture,
and in the whole matter,
least vnder the pretēce of mo∣uing
the godly readers to loue
the good thinges of the spirit,
they were allured withal to the
likeing of most dangerous er∣rors,
& vntruthes, which God
abhorreth: and so they should
reape not so much benefite by
that which is good, as hurt,
which is the drift of Sathan, to
their soules by that which is
wicked.
The dooing whereof if it
please not mine aduersaries, to
make thē to like it I will spend
noe more wordes at this time:
I trust none that be truely reli∣gious,
and godly wise, (whom
I chiefly respect) but will in∣terpret

my paines in the best
parte, and withall wish that
what else any of the contrary
side in respect of Religion, shal
publish to this ende & effecte
if it cannot for some causes vt∣terly
bee expressed, which is
impossible yet it may carefully
and wisely both be perused &
reformed, that good, & none
hurte may redounde vnto the
people of God.
And this I haue thought
good to dedicate vnto your
worshippes, as in that respect
before cited, so partly to signi∣fie
that the good will & friend∣ship
which from the first time
I was acquainted with you, I
haue found at your handes, is
not forgotten, though little
spoken of on my parte; and
prtely by some work of mine
own, hauing none other thing
so good, to requite in some sort

the benefits receiued from you
both: and, though I desire you
not to take it in good parte,
because I need not, not in re∣spect
of the worthinesse of the
thing, so much as of the good∣nesse
of both your natures; yet
most earnestly I beseech the
almighty God namely for you,
that as by the greate wisedome
wherewith yee be inspired frō
aboue, and by the experience
yee haue gotten in the world,
yee knowe how vaine, and
deceitful the world, and the
things in the world, are, so
more and more yee may grow
both into a detestation of
all the vanities of the same
whatsoeuer, and into the like∣ing,
and louing, and longing
for those thinges which are
truely glorious, and to be de∣sired:
and for the which we
are createdEphes. 1. verse. 4 in the heauens;

and that which I pray for you
by name, I desire also not one∣ly
for my selfe, but besides
for all the rest of our
friendes whereso∣euer.
