Worthy SIR, MADAM,
I Presume to affix your Venerable Names in the Frontispiece of this Treatise, not upon my own ac∣count, or upon any such interest I can challenge in your Worships, being much unknown to you; but as acting the part of the deceased Author, who had upon great reason conceived a very high estimation of you, as I doubt not but your respects to him were reciprocal, being grounded both upon long acquaintance and experience of each other, his dis∣course of you with grateful acknowledg∣ments

of your multiplied kindness to his person and family in my hearing, and his affectionate prayers for you, were clear testimonies that you were engraven up∣on his heart; and if his unparallel'd mo∣desty had permitted him to have com∣mitted any thing to the Press, doubt∣less his cordial affection would have issu∣ed it self in such an Epistolary inscripti∣on. But since I am necessitated to sup∣ply his place in handing these Discour∣ses to the World, I prostrate this expo∣sed Orphan at your feet, and question not your candid reception, and resolute protection of what was the genuine product of his mind and mouth, which I will confidently assure you these Trea∣tises are, both for matter, method, words, without the least addition, substraction, or alteration, being taken out of his own notes as he preacht them, writ at large with his own hand.
The matter of these Sermons is of greatest moment and importance; fun∣damental truths they are [of the gift of God in our blessed Redeemer, and Christs Lordship and Soveraignty] which are

truths of the first magnitude, most neces∣sary, like wool and corn, the staple-com∣modities of this Kingdom; like bread and salt that must be set upon the Ta∣ble; like ground-Cells upon which lyes the weight of the fabrick; these are com∣prehensive and extensive truths; without this gift sinners had not been pardoned, accepted; without this Lordship souls would wander and rebel; the former brings us into favour with God, the latter conquers rebellious wills, subdues enemies, regulates Saints, and crowns them with glory. The manner of hand∣ling these subjects is plain, exact, nervous, and very pathetical, which took great impression on the hearers vvhen first de∣livered with the lively voice of that fair spokesman for Christ, whose heart was much taken with this lovely and beloved Lord, and took great delight to recom∣mend him to poor sinners. which he did with great advantage and success, where∣by he became a spiritual father of many children, whom he begot in the bonds of the Gospel. Indeed he excelled others

in other subjects, but in this he excelled himself, especially in this swan-like song, which savours of Heaven, and seems to be calculated for the height of Sion, to be sung by that heavenly host in the praises of our dear Redeemer.
But neither do these weighty subjects, nor the lively colours wherein they are set off, need my recommendation; nor yet the Authors gifts, graces, industry, fidelity, and other imitable properties, well known to you and all that were ac∣quainted with him, need at all be menti∣oned by me, at least at this season, his singular accomplishments and conversa∣tion shine too bright to be darkened by any black-mouth'd Momus; as his soul and body are beyond the reach of Satan and Sorrow, so his name is above any just censures and calumnies.
I make bold to put these Posthumous works into your hands; may your Wor∣ships in the first place reap the benefit, and by your experiments thereof in your souls, and conformity thereto in your lives, incourage others to come and see

how good our Lord Jesus is; this is a lovely Song of one that could play well on an instrument; may your hearts eccho to this Gospel-tune; here's solid food well cookt, rendred delectable with the sweet sauce of acceptable words; may your stomacks be keen and sharp, and nourisht by it to eternal life. These are goads and nails fastened by this master of assemblies (now rewarded by his Ma∣ster) given out by one shepherd; may Gods Spirit fasten them as a nail in a sure place upon many consciences; I have then attained my ends in this underta∣king; may God be thereby glorified, and souls edified, we have enough. The Lord bless you both, and make you rich bles∣sings to your Country in your publick, domestical and personal station and rela∣tion. The Lord drop down this choice gift into your laps and hearts, that you may give up your selves to him again as his bored, devoted servants for ever. God Almighty, that hath been the stay of your Youth, be also the staff of your old age, and maintain you as choice in∣struments

of his glory in the land of the living, and in a good old age conduct you through the valley of the shadow of death, into the land of life; so prayeth

Febr. 1. 1678/9.
