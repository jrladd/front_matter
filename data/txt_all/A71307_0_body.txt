HAuing presented to the Princes Highnesse a World of Histories composed into a Historie of the World, I durst not set saile with so great a Fleet of Sea-voyages (a principall part thereof) before I be∣came humble Sutor to Your Grace for li∣cense from the Admiraltie. Pardon this presumpon, which Your Greatnesse requireth, Your Goodnesse inuiteth and the nature of the Worke exacteth. His Maie∣stie, the breath of our nosthrils, the Life and Rule of our a∣ctions, hth by many graces otherwise, and by exemplarie dedica∣tion, tatht Others Bookes there to seeke delightsome shaddow, where s gaue so glorious light.
Nther may any Name stand so neere That of His High∣nesse, oecially in a Booke of Sea and Land Trauels, as His

who hath beene so late and faithfull a Traueller with Him by Sea and Land; Nor the Kings honor (here aymed at) bee more welcome to any then the Kings Friend, whom the King will honour; Nor can acts of Nauigation bee any where more sutable then to a Noble mind, now fixing his best and blest thoughts on discouering a neerer passage to the remoter World, and vnder whose Charge the Nauie Royall more flourisheth then euer. By some of Yours also the Author was encouraged to vndertake this great worke, which now therefore returneth to your Grace, as that Sea whence the Springs first flowed. May it please your Graces taste (more from such employments cannot be expected) to incite inferior appetites: and I hope that to such sweetnesse of Nature, this Historie of Nature will not be altogether distastfull. God Almightie blesse and pro∣sper your Grace, and all your Loyall seruices to His Maiestie, with increase of Diuine, Royall, and Princely fauour.
AMEN.
