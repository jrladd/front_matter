SIR,
IN the midst of the giddy and rapid turnings of the Affairs of this World, the Malignity and Pre∣dominancy of Vice, clowding and ob∣structing Reason, violently agitating the purest of its spirits and succors into the same commotions and con∣fusions: He that can stand steady and immoveable is a greater Mi∣racle, than could have been the sub∣ject of Archimedes his bold Boast; That he would unfix this whole Globe of Earth, might be have but a footing off from it. For beside his vanity to promise the uncentring of that vast Body and unweildy, when he could not give his own small active Carcase one remove from it; He would have been as far to seek for a convenient distance and station where to effect the ope∣ration: So that thorough the incer∣tainty and impossibility of his postu∣latum, the grand design must ne∣cessarily fall to the ground, as ob∣scurely as himself was erelong cast down, to measure his own lines and narrow dimensions in the Dust. But granting it a demonstration, I must pay far greater Admiration and Esteem to those brave Souls, who when the whole course of Nature is under impetuous motions and tumults remain unconcern'd and fixt, and, by the conduct of singu∣lar Virture, retain their Sobriety and Prudence, when all about them is mad, and under the fatal hur∣ries of the great Disturbers of man∣kind, or the furious Tempests of their own uncontrouled passions: This
'tis to bear up a manly head a∣bove the Ruines, though the whole Fabrick of the World be sinking, and rowling into one Confusion.
That the slender supports of these few Lines are oppos'd against these threatned mischiefs of bolder Vice, with ambition to act the part of a∣ny Atlas (for our declining Age seems to want more than One) would be a presumption I need not acquit my self from, by assuring you I dwell not so much abroad, and from the notice of the dangers menacing my own Cottage: And indeed I here expect the whole world to be my Compurgators, and fearing no such Calamity that eve∣ry one will excuse me that Labour, and as readily engage against any other such Ʋndertaker. The truth is [Sir] these short reflexes on Vice do exceedingly enhanse to me the Beauty and Dowry of Virtue; the more I contemplate the vacui∣ties and deformities of that, I ad∣mire to find not so much as the least shadow of either in this; And I am willing to proclaim aloud, That Virtue alone is that noble and undaunted generosity; which not any single Engineer, but were e∣very vicious person an Archime∣des, with all their Stratagems and force they could not in the least shake or undermine. And where should I expect, however wish, to find this Gallantry of Spirit, if not among our Nobless? I look on them to be the Spirituous bloud of the Body Politick; not their Purpurate descent alone, but the unquestionable verity that the Bloud is the vitals of the Creature warrants my assertion; and it would be an ungrateful Argument to e∣vince it, from the infallible approa∣ches Death, once enterr'd here, makes upon all the fortresses of the Garrison, in every tide the bloud beats up, to and from the Heart. The fortyfying therefore of this Archeus, may it be as cordial and acceptable, as if I now brought some nobler Liquor to be transfus'd into the veins, and drein'd off the sheepish and vitu∣line qualities so long fed upon and imbib'd, that, though we scorn the cloathing, betray the sound of Wool in our language.
But Sir I must stop here to meet your wonder, when under∣standing perfectly my temperament, you see this close conception expos'd and enduring the sight of the Sun, and every ones readiness in Physi∣ognomy: and that He you know me to be, when the World can be no more advantaged by his mean capacity, than he is like to be by its unexpected kindness; will yet put himself under the power of suf∣fering from it: why he is not con∣tent to sit still in private digesting his resentments of the follies a∣broad, with the freedom they al∣low him to be quiet? and if some will ever be found doing amiss, what should make him do worse, to say he likes it not? He will first tell you every day produces some∣thing as strange as this, and what may equally be the object of your wonder; unless you are wholly ex∣empt from it, and He from saying more of it. But if He much more wonder at this himself and (if the regard He cannot dissemble for himself would permit) do hugely condemn himself and it: Will you or any other like him, or it, the better? If neither, Sir believe it, he will keep a little more good opini∣on in store for himself, which shall make him esteem no better of himself and the world, than if there were no relation intervening; He means so much to favour himself, that that shall do him as little hurt as he can do it good. And if you look for your friend, Sir, he is not yet turn'd Anchorite, he will sooner be a Pilgrim with good Company, and the excellent Guide he is lately acquainted with. Nor are his resentments in fear of Fermenta∣tion next Spring; Nay he hopes to be as serene in the Canicular daies, as now, when the humors are close with the Earth lockt up in the cold and in∣nocent embraces of the Snow. And let this clear him from being thought too invective to the evils of our times; that as he is sensible of a monstrous conflux of instant vices, his thoughts are calm, and pen but mild, to those fears he has of the next age, in dan∣ger to be orespread with the Superfe∣tations of that Impiety, which will be too obdurate to feel the edge of a Satyr.
Sir all but your self will now ex∣pect large Encomiums to recommend you to the view of the multitude; But I am sensible they stand but ready to devour you, and this I call you to pa∣tronize For your self, Sir, I averre not so much Jealousie over your inclinati∣ons to these vices, as Hopes that your life will be a fair copy of all Virtues, presents you to this place, to supply the draught I should haue added to them: and may your Auspicious be∣ginnings continue me in acknowledg∣ment of my defects and tenuity, de∣terring my pen from entring on the Commendations will be your due. And for your Family, it is so illustrious, that I shall be taxed by those that would find nothing good in it, for da∣ring to affix this Name to so mean a Front: and they will leave you in hast to come and revenge themselves upon me, if I cannot escape their stomach. However be pleased my wishes, and well wisht directions may be favoura∣bly interpreted by your Noble mind, and all of your truly noble qu lity.
And Sir, for your friend, pray wish him well also, now faln to be employ'd in such a publick Character; for you cannot tell what change he may not dare venture next in his life, (if you will with him suppose it of his Life, which every day changeth; not of himself and his vow'd constancy and integrity) for there must, and will be found some so foolish, as not to fear the Printers nor Readers Press they are to pass, any more than others doe Matrimony: and there may be Fatali∣ty to be pleaded for that also; which to fear is the next way to the curse of continuing a Miserable Life, out of all hopes of a kind Reprieve of Death to cut the halter of our fears. And me∣thinks I am now acting my own De∣parting; and have two words to say for my self before the last Farewel: wherein (Pardon the digression) I seem to represent many of those we have seen too much personating a publick (not to say republick) death, as if their deaths too were to be none of their own: not unlike to me they appear to the poor Widow, who went out to gather two sticks to pre∣pare a small cake, that they may at least dye with a good morsel in their mouths. But not to forget to leave off, though I doe it less formally: For first I will not supplicate your favour, no more than expect your thanks, for being prolix, but tell you my design is honest, and an effect of my Honour to your Name and Person. Next I know not how to intreat a good opi∣nion or pardon of the Language, only assure you, I took what words I thought most full and near to my Conceptions; and I can sooner alter the natural Tone of my voice, to coun∣terfeit any others, than chuse to fall into the Rectifiers or Body-makers hands, and suffer my Mind to be pinched and shaped into the con∣straint of anothers dress and Mode of expression. I shall but add, that all of it is but a Christmá Letter: And you know we are allow'd our Masquerades, and longer festivous entertains of a Carnival; So as you will admit it over your threshold, when I tell you under the vizour in a whisper, That I am none other than Your very known Servant
