Worthy Sir,
I Cannot but be deeply sensible, and much affected, and sympathize with you in your great Loss; but the Consideration of the Happy End and Triumphant Death of your dear Yoke-fellow may greatly moderate your Sorrow. O with what Rap∣tures of Joy was she filled! it may well be said of her, she went away Singing; if any thing may convince this Atheistical Age of the Truth or Verity of revealed Religion, one would think the beholding how some Be∣lievers in Christ go out of the World, might do it. Sir, forbear Mourning, She is not Dead, but sleepeth, and that in Je∣sus too; Her better Part could not Die, because she truly believed in Jesus Christ; She has left you, but is gone to him, which to Her is far better. I hope you and others will never forget that wholesom and Christi∣an Advice she gave, to Love God, and to
 live to him who willingly became a Sacri∣fice for our Sins. I was much affected, when I heard what a Text she had left to be opened at her Funeral; But since it was your Purpose and Resolution to Publish the Ser∣mon, it would have been well, had I had a little more Time for my Study, and Pre∣paration (for the Lords Day intervening, I had indeed but a few Hours) so that I hope you and others, who either heard the Sermon or now shall read it, will over-look my weaknesses; some few things are here added, which were then omitted for want of Time; and that a Blessing from the God of Truth may accompany it, and make it profitable to all that Love the Lord Jesus in Sincerity (who shall vouchsafe the Pains to peruse it) shall be the Prayers, Sir,

Horsly-Down, March 23d. 1699.
