My Lord,
I Do heartily wish, that your Lordships desires had not been so Earnest and Pressing as they were, to have this Discourse made Publick, which I assure Your Lordship was not in the least by me designed to be sent abroad into the World. Your Lordship knew those Obligations I lye un∣der to Your Lordship as my Kind and Noble Friend, and the Principle I go upon of submit∣ting to Authority; so that Your Lordship had me under a double tye, both of Gratitude and Obedience.
I expect to bear a great many more hard Cen∣sures and Invectives for this, though I have done no more then what I think was my bounden Duty to do: But those things I have been so accustomed to hear, that I am now Clamour-proof; I had almost said, that mine Ears are somewhat like a Traytors Conscience, past all feeling. But (if I may have leave to express my Real thoughts) I cannot but pitty Your Lordship and your Reve∣rend Brethren, for Causing this Sermon to be Printed; because hereby you have made it your own, and are Oblig'd in Honour to undertake for it, and to be my Defendants, if ever I should be
 Threatned to be brought upon my Knees, or to ho up my hand at the Bar for this, as I have been threatned formerly for things of the like Nature.
And this I may think to be Security good e∣nough. But the mischief is, that if ever tho Canicular days should come again, Your Lord∣ships will be in greater Jeopardy then my self and then God help my Advocates as well
 Your Client.
Let times be as it shall please God: It is, my Lord, your Honour that you are true to you Duty; and it is my satisfaction, that I can in any thing Obey your Commands: And I do it with the more readiness, because it is observed how ready your Lordship and the rest of the Judg∣es are to stand by the Interest of the Church, and upon all Occasions publickly to Vindicate the Honour and Integrity of the Conformable and Loyal Clergy.
That the God of peace, for whom you Judge, will Vouchsafe to preserve you in your Great and Honourable Station, and support your Courage, and Bless your Labours in the Ministration of Justice, and Eternally Reward your Faithfulness to the King, to the Church, and to the whole Na∣tion, is, My Lord, the hearty Prayer of
