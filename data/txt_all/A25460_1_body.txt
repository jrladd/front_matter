SIR.
BEing necessitated to divide where a uni∣on was both principally and primarly intended, I am emboldened to divulge my thoughts of the Churches Sacra∣ments, under the umbrage and tuiti∣on of your name and eminent vertues.
To despond of your favorable Acceptance, were to make my self the Subject of their Censure, who are more acquainted with that innate candor which attends your refined Abilities.
Your Education being in the same Colledge with my self, makes me more intencely ambitious of

your Happinesse and Honor, of which last Divinity shews (and to her in this Philosophy agrees) there are four species or sorts.

1 Naturall by birth, Our Saviour being of the Royall Trybe, was born a Gentleman; of this you have a part.
2 Civill by riches, Abraham was a mighty Prince, of this you have a Competency.
3 Moral by a vertuous life; this made Jabez more honourable then his Brethren, in this you have outstrip'd many of your companions.
4 Celestial by being Crowned with glory, and such honour have all Gods Saints, which to ob∣tain a firm standing unto, and a worthy receiving of the Churches Sacraments, are essentiall helps and furtherances.

In this tract you have their natures Catholical∣ly handled, and purely, though plainly, taught, un∣to which, if you take heed, you shall do well, and passe for a true Son of the Church, in the Register of the faithful, and receive the sure reward, of a Saint in the new Jerusalem the Mother of us all, which is the prayer of him who is.
SIR.
