My Lord,
EVery man who hath not been out of his Wits or his own Country, or like the Poet Epimenides, who is said to have slept more than Twenty years.
And hath but understood or experimented the many Miseryes and Confusions which our new Reformers and Modellers of Go∣vernment, (who like unskilful Architects, cannot amend a part of an house without over∣turning the whole Fabrick upon the heads of

the Owners) have treated the Faction and Ignorance of too many of the seduced peo∣ple of this Kingdom withal; And sitting by the Waters of Babylon had not forgot Je∣rusalem, or but remembred the happi∣nesse of the Condition we before enjoyed under a gratious and pious Prince in an Antient, and for many ages past, most happy Monar∣chy, and with Tears of Joy welcommed it again in the Return of his sacred Majesty, and all our peace and plenty from a sad and long oppressing Captivity, must needs think himself obliged not only to pray for the Peace of our Syon but to endeavour all he can to uphold the Kings Rights and Jurisdictions.
Who being our Lex viva, and guarding Him∣self, us and our Laws, is with them the sure support of us and all that is or can be of any Concernment to us and our Posteri∣tyes; And therefore when we are taught by our Laws, and the sage▪ Interpreters and Expounders thereof, That every Subject hath an Interest in the King as the Head of the Wele Publick, and as the in∣ferior Members cannot estrange them

selves from the Actions or Passions of the head,Hollands Case in Coke 4 Reports. no lesse can any Subject make himself a Stranger to any thing which toucheth the King or their su∣preme Head, And that not a few but very many knowing and able men are of opinion not ushered in by Fancy or first Notions, but well weighed and built with Reason and good Authorities that the exchanging of the Tenures in Capite and by Knight Service, for a constant yearly payment of 100000 l. will level the Regality, and turn the Sove∣raignty into a dangerous popularity, and take away or blunt the Edge of the Sword, by which his Majesty is to defend his people; I could not but conceive it to be my Duty (and a failer of my Duty and Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy not to do it) to offer to consideration the antiquity and right use of Tenures in this and other Kingdoms, that they are no Slavery nor Grievance, how from a project in the beginning of the Raign of King James, it came to trouble several Par∣liaments, the small benefits will come to the Subjects by altering those Tenures, and the

many Inconveniences and Mischiefs which will inevitably follow, and that it is such a flower of the Crown, as the power of an Act of Par∣liament, and consent of the King and his Nobility, and people cannot take away, wherein, though I may well say it is a matter, as Livy said of his undertaking to write the Roman History Immensi Operis, and that the disquisition of it requiring greater Abilities than I can lay any claim unto; and the excellent Order heretofore used, that all Books of the Law, or very much concerning it▪ should be perused and allowed by the Reverend Judges of the Law, before they should be Printed and published, might have been e∣nough to have made me either to desist, or have attended their approbation; Yet when the good intentions of many Parliament men of the House of Commons to make the King a con∣stant Revenue were so busy to prepare an Act of Parliament to dissolve those more useful and honourable Tenures into a Socage, which will never arrive to the Salus Populi they aim at. I have like some well-wishing Roman to his Countries good, in my Cares,

and fear least any thing should hurt, dislocate, or disturb, that well ordered and constituted Government, under which our Progenitors en∣joyed so much Honor, Peace und Plenty, hasted Currente Calamo, to a modest inqui∣ry into the grounds and motives, for the disso∣lution of them, and the Court of Wards, and an examination of that to be prepared Act in the General (for as to the Preamble, Clu∣ses or Provisoes, they are not permitted to be seen before the Act passeth) the Rogatio Le∣gum as it was amongst the Romans, being not here in use in some cases as it may be wished it were, and when none else would publiquely endeavour to rescue them, have without any Byasse or partiality as well as I could, represented what hath been the right use of them, and what may be the Inconveniences if they should be changed or altered, and that they are not guilty of the charge which is supposed, but never will be proved against them.
And confesse that it deserved a better Ad∣vocate than my self, who having attempted to do it horis Succsvis & interturbationes re∣rum, am Conscious to my self that much

more might have been said for it, and that the matter was capable of a better form, and might have appeared in a better dresse, if my care to do something as fast as I could, had not for want of time hindred me from doing what I might.
But I hope that your Lordship who hath trod the Pathes of Affliction, and in the at∣tendance and care of a persecuted Monarchy, and an Afflicted most Gracious Prince, who hath born the burthen of His own Sorrows & Troubles, as well as of a Loyal party that Suf∣fered wih & for Him and His Royal Father▪ have in Your Travails and residence in many Kingdoms and parts beyond the Seas, viewed and seen the Fundamentals and Order of o∣ther Kingdoms, the Policies and good Reigle∣ments of some, and the Errors and Infirmities of others, will with your learned Predecessor the Chancellor Fortescue in the Raign of King Henry the 6h. the more admire and love the Laws and excellent Constitutions of England, which as a Quintessence of right reason, may seem to have been Limbecked and drawn out of the best of Laws, and choice

of all which might be learned out of other Na∣tions, or the Records or Treasury of Time, and find reason enough to be of the opinion of that well knowing Statesman,Fortescue de laudibus Le∣gum Anglae. that non minime erit regno accommodum, ut Incolae ejus in artibus sint experti, & quod domus regia sit tanquam gymnasium supremum nobilitatis regni schola quoque Stre∣nuitatis probitatis & morum quibus reg∣num honoretur, & floret ac contra Irru∣entes securatur, & hoc revera bonum ac∣cidisse non pottuisset regno illi, Si nobili∣um fili Orphani & Pupilli per pauperes amicos parentum suorum nutrirentur, and greatly approve as he did of our Tenures in Capite, and by Knight Service (which have heen since better ordered, and more deserve that, and a better commendation) and to put forth your hand to rescue them, who have hi∣therto as great Beams, peices of Tymber, or Pil∣lars, helped to bear up and sustain the Fabrick of our Antient and Monarchical Government, and have no other fault, but that they are mis∣understood and misrepresented to the vulgar, who by making causelesse complaints & multi∣plying

them, have done of late by our Laws and best Constitutions, as the Boys are used to do when they hunt Squirrels with Drums, shouts and Noyses; And that your Lordship who is able to say much more for that Institution and Right use of Tenures, will be pleased to accept of my good Intentions, and pardon the Imperfections of
London
23. November 1660.
