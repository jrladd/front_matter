SIR,
IF these papers liue, it is because they deuote themselues to you, in whom alone they gratulate the happinesse of your Family, which is ennobled by soe safe and so pure a Vertue, that as no Enuy dares ap∣approach it, so no Flattery can corrupt it, a Fa∣mily which hath enioyed the fauour of your
Soueraignes by descent, and which hath pro∣ued your Vertues as hereditary as your honours. But because it did appeare to cheape a glory to be absolute in that Court which the King doth daily crowne with the diuine exam∣ples of his Vertues, and where hee is no Sub∣iect whose practise expresseth not the loyalty of obedience to such his most royall inclinations, it hath beene your Businesse to transplant them into remote Kingdomes and Courts, who haue admired the method of his Gouernment by your Discourse, and beleiued it by your Con∣uersation, a Truth which their Jmitation hath illustrated, and which the Pirat and the Infi∣dell hath vnderstood and beene guilty of it, who taken more by the more victorious sweetnesse o your Nature, then you were by their insolence forgate that they were Turkes and made your Deliuerance as famous as your Wisdome. You haue enioyed by this a reflecting happinesse, and haue improued our Practice at home, by being
such a studied and an elaborate Example a∣broad and teaching dispersed Nations the English Vertue, you haue made the World in∣debted to your owne. These are the Garlands which doe crowne your praises, which your loue to learning doth perpetuate & aduance as much in excellence as number, but the modest grati∣tude of learning being Compendious alwaies in the Panegyriks of her liuing Benefactors doth become to them more absolute and more iust by Death, for Eternity being the Obiect and the End of Learning, their Memory must rather be her Subiect then themselues. But your loue vnto Religion as it is vnbounded, so will your Reward be, which hath inuited Blessings to de∣scend vpon you, Blessings which shall raise you high as in their Centre from whence they flow, and leauing your Story a mirrour to Posterity, shall giue life vnto your Epitaph, when the Ru∣ines of your Tombe can remember it no more. This I do not presage, but demonstrate, for Fame
is but the herauld and the voice of Honour, and Jmmortality rather a Debt then a Reward to Vertue. But I forbeare to afflict you with your praises, which are therefore the more due, the more vnwilling you are to heare them. Pardon my imposed Errour, the assurance of your Ver∣tues did giue vnto my knowledge that it was a sin to conceale them and my insufficiency to ex∣presse that knowledge hath made my language as guilty as my silence. But I presume these few leaues deliuered in what forme soeuer will be acceptable to you, not for any beauty that this rude hand of mine can lend vnto them, but for the primitiue excellence of their Authors, who meet as admirably in their eloquence as they differ in their sence. The smallnes of the Pre∣sent shall the more ennoble and crowne your Ac∣ceptance. The Sea receiueth the smallest drops with as much acknowledgement as the greatest Riuers, & the like liberality of entertainment hath renowned the Assyrian Monarch, and in∣deerd
him more to Immortality then all the Glory of the East or the Maiesty of his Em∣pires could. Be pleased to entertaine this with your leasure and your patience, which shall ob∣lige mee ere many moneths be expired, to pre∣sent you with a larger volume, as deuoted euer to expresse my selfe,
