LOrd, my first fruits should have been sent to thee;
For thou the tree,
That bare them, only lentest unto me.


But while I had the use, the fruit was mine:
Not so divine,
As that I dare presume to call it thine.


Before 'twas ripe it fell unto the ground:
And since I found
It bruised in the dirt, nor clean, nor sound.


Some I have pick'd, and wip'd, and bring thee now,
Lord, thou know'st how:
Gladly I would, but dare not it avow.


Such as it is, 'tis here. Pardon the best,
Accept the rest.
Thy pardon and acceptance maketh blest.
