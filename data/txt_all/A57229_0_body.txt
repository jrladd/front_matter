Madam.
AFter I had determin'd to let the following Discourse go abroad in∣to the World, I never deliberated about the choice of a Patron, nor spent any time in considering to whom it should be Dedicated. What I have there Wrote, be∣longs to your Ladyship upon divers Ac∣counts, and especially upon these, that it was drawn up at first in obedience to your Commands, (for, under that notion I do and ought to receive the least Intimations of your Pleasure) was originally design'd only for your Service, and has already been admitted in Manuscript to the honour of a place in your Closet, for several Months. I hope therefore, Madam, you'll not be displeas'd, if I present you the same again from the Press, a little enlarg'd. For it's
obvious to apprehend, that these Papers, being now expos'd to the View of the Pub∣lick, may easily fall into the hands of many Readers, who have not that Candour of Temper, that Quickness of Parts and Appre∣hension, which every one admires in your Ladyship; and therefore it was advisable, that I should make what convenient Pro∣vision I could, by a few Alterations and Additions, against Cavilling and misunder∣standing. And if, notwithstanding all the care I have taken, the Work still fall under Censure (and strange indeed it must be, if it does not with some,) the severest Criticks, I doubt not, will however be so just, as to acknowledge that the Design, which is all your Ladyship is concern'd in, is good, and fit for a Person of Honour and Integrity to own; since it aim's at the vindicating the most Venerable Records of our Religion from the Objections, that are urg'd against their being Genuine. And whatever faults or defects there may be in the conduct thereof, for want of due Learn∣ing or Judgment in the undertaker, I don't in the least desire your Ladyship should justify or defend, but leave them all to be charg'd on the account of,
Madam,
