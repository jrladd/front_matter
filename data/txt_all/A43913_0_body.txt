MADAM,
'TIS to be hop'd that your Ho∣nour will not take it ill, that a Soldier of Fortune here pre∣sumes to appear before you; one who, with the Hero of the ensuing History, has been Partaker of the Toils and Fatigues, which are inseparable from the Art of War;

and who consequently, has had an opportu∣nity to be an Eye-witness as well of the Amorous Exploits, as Military Atchiev∣ments, perform'd by him in several Coun∣tries; where either the King's Service, or the Glory of Arms, have call'd for his Presence. I have consider'd with my self, MADAM, for a long time, about the choice of an Eminent Person, to whom I might properly Dedicate this Historical Commentary, without being able to come to a final Resolution, as to that Particular: And indeed, there are different Motives, which induce Authors to act on the like Oc∣casions: For some do it, with a design to pro∣cure for themselves some powerful Patrons at Court; others, by way of acknowledgment for Favours already receiv'd; others, only to get the Name of an illustrious Personage prefixt before their Works; and lastly, others, purely out of a Principle of Candor and Generosity, without any manner of Af∣fectation.
MADAM, I have reason to boas̄t, even without Vanity or Ostentation, that I am of the number of these last; since it is

not to insinuate my self into your Favour, nor to sollicit you to make use of your In∣terest with the King in my behalf, that I have at last determin'd to make you a Pre∣sent of these Gallantries of the Marshal de Boufflers. I do not (Thanks be to Heaven) stand in need of any of these, or the like Ad∣vantages; but rather, on the contrary, am in a condition to slight the Court-Favours, and to look upon the capricious Events of Fortune with Contempt. The true Motive, that has excited me to Dedicate this History to your Honour, is the dis-interessed Desire I have, to give you some sort of Satisfaction, and to afford you in some measure, an agree∣able Diversion for a few moments, in your Retirement at St. Cyr; by the Reading of a considerable number of very remarkable Adventures relating to a Hero, for whom you have a most cordial Affection, and whose Fortune you have taken care to advance, by causing him to be promoted to the principal Preferments in the Army, and very near, to the highest pitch of military Glory. Here your Honour may observe your Darling-Fa∣vourite, ever since he was able to trail a Pike in the King's Service, till his advancement

to the Dignity of Marshal of France, and even till his Marriage with Mademoiselle de Grammont; sometimes expos'd to the greatest Misfortunes that can be imagin'd; and sometimes appearing Triumphant, as it were the most fortunate of all Mortals; ac∣cording to the variety of Accidents caus'd by the capricious Humours of the God of Love. Indeed the strangeness of the surprising Events, of which we are inform'd by this not able History, might at first sight, give occasion to suspect it to be a kind of Ro∣mance made at pleasure, much rather than a Narrative of Matters of Fact; were it not that your Honour has divers faithful Wit∣nesses to assert the Truth of the various Oc∣currences related in it. For you have re∣ceiv'd an Account of a considerable part of these Adventures, from Monsieur Bouffler's own Mouth, altho' they are such as have been hither to unknown to the World, and the Dis∣covery of which, as I presume, cannot but be very acceptable: Neither will it be any diffi∣cult Task to justifie some other particular Circumstances, of which you may possibly doubt; since the Hero himself of our present History, will make no scruple to

be my Voucher as to the reality of those Events.
However it may be taken, 'tis evident, that Truth may be discover'd by certain Li∣neaments, which cannot be hid from the sight of the more judicious part of Mankind; not with standing the Endeavours that some Authors have us'd of late, to conceal from the publick View, such precious Fragments, which give us an Idea of the good and ill Fate that attends mortal Men in this sublu∣nary World. 'Tis well known, MADAM, that you are the most sagacious, and most accomplish'd Lady in the Court of France, and therefore you may easily discern that this History does not contain any thing that is fabulous or fictitious: Nevertheless, your Honour's Approbation will be of very great moment to recommend it to the World, and will not a little contribute to cause it to be sought for, by all ingenious Personages; espe∣cially by those Honourable Ladies, who have a great Esteem for Monsieur de Boufflers, and will not be displeas'd at the care I have taken to communicate to 'em a considerable number of private Love-Intriegues, ma∣nag'd

by a Hero, who is at present the Ado∣nis of France, and the greatest Warriour that that Nation can boast of, since the Death of the famous Duke of Luxemburg. I shall no longer trespass upon your Ho∣nour's Patience; only while I beg leave to stile my self, with all possible Respect and Submission,
MADAM,
