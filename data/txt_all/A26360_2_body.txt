SIR,
THE following Papers were at first only designed for the Help and Service of my own Parishioners, (your Te∣nants;) and being resolved to ex∣pose them to publick Censure, I need∣ed not deliberate to whom they were due; nor did any Thought inter∣pose, but this one, That they were not worth your eye or owning. How∣ever, I conceived they might serve as a Witness of my deep apprehension of your Generous and Friendly Patronage.

And therefore, with all hearti∣ness and height of Gratitude, I put these. Papers into your hands, ho∣ping that when you read them o∣ver, you may meet with something besides my Frailties, even those Truths which will make you for ever happy.
And now, Sir, being no great Friend to the common Vanity of Letters Dedicatory, pardon me, that for making Court to you, I humbly apply my self to your gra∣cious Maker, That you may enjoy Health and Prosperity, and be long, long happy in the inviolable Affection of that Honourable La∣dy, your truly Noble and Pious Consort: and that the God of Blessings may daily bless you both.
