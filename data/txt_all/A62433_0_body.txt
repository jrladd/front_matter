May it please Your Grace,
AMong the many Moecena's of
Hermetick Philosophy, I
conceive none more fitting to
protect the Medicinal Veri∣ties
here set down, then Your Grace; who
hath been pleased to express very much
kindeness and love for this Noble Art,
to the no small encouragement of the Pro∣fessours
thereof. And all things duly
pondered, where can Chymical Physick
better shelter it self against Maligners

and Opposers of it, then under the wings
of Divinity, on which it ought to attend
as an Hand-maid? yea, there should be a
Synergie, and conspiration of all Arts and
Sciences to advance Theology, which
makes the better Part of us happy.
How can the Soul act aright when
there is an Atonie, Ametrie, and Dys∣crasie
in the Body? Sith as the Chyle
is, such is the Chyme, or rubified juyce;
as is the Chyme, so is the Sanguis, or
purest part of the Blood; and as this is,
so are the Vital Spirits (the immediate
instrument of the Soul) either luminous
and clear, or dark and muddy; and so
capable to act well or ill: How sollicitous
then should we be to search out those
great Arcana's in Nature, which the good
Creator hath ordained for the preservati∣on
and redintegration of these Bodies,
(which upon slight occasions from within
and without, are obnoxious to be valetu∣dinary,

and put out of frame) that the
Diviner part may operate the more
freely, vigorously, and orderly.
Certainly there is no better way to at∣tain
this then by Spagyrick Philoso∣phy,
which separates Tribulos & Spinas,
what is Hurtful and Superfluous in every
Concrete, from the profitable, pure, and
sincere; bringing it to such an Entelechie
and Excellency, that it is able to display
that radiant Virtue which God hath im∣planted
in it for the good both of Body
and Soul. And were this course closely
followed, and generally countenanced,
those rebellious and enormous Vices of
the Minde, too grassant at this day among
us, which in great part arise from the Fe∣ral,
Anomalous, unheard of Prodigious,
and untractable Diseases of the Body,
might in some measure be reformed; and
certainly if there be not some timely pre∣vention,
mox daturi progeniem vitio∣siorem,

most of our Posterity is like to be
born diseased.
Seeing therefore no Medicine is able
to mortifie these Seminal Principles of
Diseases, or wash off those Radical
Tinctures which have been traduced to
us from our Parents, but the best sort of
Chymical Preparations exalted to the
highest degree of perfection; some of
which have been of late years brought to
light by the indefatigable industry of
some Ingenious men, whom the Galenists
have endeavoured to eclipse, and despite∣fully
to suppress by Calumnies and Re∣proaches;
we humbly beg Your Graces
favour to stand up for the defence of our
Art, so far as truth, sound reason and Op∣tical
Experiments shall permit; and that
Your Grace would be pleased to joyn with
some other Heroes of the Nation, either
to stop the mouthes of these Anti-Chymists,
or to constrain them to make

good by matter of Fact, and fair equal
Trials here proposed, what they alledge
against us; that there may be a full dis∣covery
made who are the Physicians, quos
creavit Altissimus, and who are they that
go about ludere cum corio humano:
And this present and future Age shall be
bound to celebrate Your Praises;
My Lord,
