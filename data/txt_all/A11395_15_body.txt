HAuing new-mustred th' HOAST of all this ALL:
Your Royall Father In our Fore ward stands;
Where (Adam-like) Himself alone Commands
A WORLD of Creatures, ready at his Call.
Our Middle-ward doth not vnfitly fall
To famous Chiefs, whose graue-braue heads & hands
In Counsail'd Courage so Conduct our Bands,
As (at a brunt) affront the force of Baal.
Our Rere-Ward (Sir) shalbe your Princely Charge,
Though last, not least (sith it most Honour brings)
Where Honour's Field before you lies more large:
For, Your Command is of a Camp of KINGS,
Some good, some bad: Your Glory shall be, heer
To Chuse and Vse the good, the bad Cassier.



IEwel of NATVRE, Ioy of ALBION,
To whose perfection Heav'n and Earth conspire:
That, in Time fulnes, Thou mayst bless thisâ–ª Throne
(Succeeding in the Vertues of thy Sire)
As happily thou hast begun, goe-on;
That, as thy Youth, we may thine Age admire;
Acting our Hopes (which shall revive our hearts)
Pattern & Patron both of Arms & Arts.
