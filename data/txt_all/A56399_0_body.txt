SIR,
BY many Titles you claim
my poor Endeavours, but
by none more than that of
the Example you have given me;
on which account, how much soever
the World is oblig'd to you, I,
for my part, must acknowledge
my self more especially indebt∣ed;
since of our Moderns, none

has afforded me a more perfect
Idea of Genuine Eloquence and
Reason than Mr. Collier. Kind∣ly
therefore receive a Creature
thus in an inferiour Sense your
own; encourage its Address, and
protect it from the Censures and
Criticisms of a squeamish Age:
Protect it, I beseech you, la∣bouring
under so great Disad∣vantages,
as its Author's Imma∣turity,
the Impediments of his
present Circumstances, and the
burden of its own Defects; Ob∣stacles
that must have prov'd in∣superable,
but for the benign In∣fluence
and Condescensions of that
Learned President and Society
under whose Discipline I live,
and by whose Instructions and Con∣versation
I endeavour to improve.

Instead of troubling you with
any occasions of my ensuing Per∣formances,
I shall only inform
you of the occasion of a remark∣able
Omission, I mean my neg∣lect
of Mathematical Arguments,
of which the World is become most
immoderately fond, looking upon
every thing as trivial, that bears
no relation to the Compasses, and
establishing the most distant parts
of Humane Knowledge; all Spe∣culations,
whether Physical, Lo∣gical,
Ethical, Political, or any
other upon the particular results
of Number and Magnitude. Nor
is it to be question'd, but the
Dominion of Number and Mag∣nitude
is very large. Must they
therefore devour all Relations and
Properties whatsoever? 'Tis plain∣ly
unreasonable. In any other
Common-wealth but that of Learn∣ing,

such attempts towards an
absolute Monarchy would quick¦ly
meet with Opposition. It may
be a kind of Treason, perhaps,
to intimate thus much; but who
can any longer forbear, when he
sees the most noble, and most use∣full
portions of Philosophy lie
fallow and deserted for oppor∣tunities
of learning how to prove
the Whole bigger than the
Part, &c.
I expect also some Doctrines
of that Essay, which treats of the
Certainty of Things, and the De¦monstration
of a Deity, will be
disrelish'd by a Party of Men
amongst us at this time not incon∣siderable.
But the Author assures
all such, that as he understands
his Inferences in that Essay to be
just and sure, however agreeable

to this or that Hypothesis, so he
has neither taken advantage of a∣ny
Errors, nor from any Acquisi∣tions
of Mr. Lock, having not
read that Gentleman's elegant Es∣say
of Humane Understanding, till
some time after he had compos'd his
own Discourse, wherein he resolv'd
to quit all Authority for the simple
Evidence of his own naked Reason.
And here I cannot chuse, but hint,
how much it were to be wish'd, your
self, Sir, would put an end to the
Dispute now prosecuted by that
Gentleman. I am confident a Iudg∣ment
so penetrating, adorn'd with
a Rhetorick so powerfull, might ea∣sily
decide that subtile Controversie
both to the satisfaction of the Anta∣gonists
and their Readers. But, I
confess, I cannot handsomely urge
this mòtion, when I recollect how

vast a design you are already form∣ing,
a design which will redound
as much to the Credit of your Coun∣try,
as did once the Athenian Co∣lumns,
the Egyptian Pyramids, or
the Roman Registers to the Glory
of those States, and from the pur∣suit
of which, to detain you longer,
were altogether unpardonable in,
Good Sir,
Trin Coll Oxn.
Febr. 20. 1699.
