RIght Honourable, my good Lorde: If affectionate dutie shall be held presumption, or any taxe me of rashnesse, for still troubling your Lordship with my rude labors; I plead mine excuse, with the Poet Affranius: who (blamed for guilt of like crime to Traian) yet dared to present him, with homely Poems: excusing himselfe still, with the curtesie of the Emperour, which as Princely accepted, as the other poorely offered: And so shrow∣ded with the shelter of your honorable cur∣tesie, I shall be shielded from the stormes of

idle imputations, stop (as did Affranius) the mouthes of my Taxors▪ and aduenture once more to present vnto your Lordship, my pri∣son-night-watches, as a simple token of my thankfulnesse, and pledge of further dutie: then deeming my selfe happie, when I may acknowledge your honourable goodnesse, with any performance of dutie, or accepta∣ble seruice to your Lordship, to whom, both my self, and poore endeuours, are wholy de∣uoted. The worthy and necessary vse of this Treatise, I leaue to the graue iudgment of lear∣ned Censors: and in all dutie and zeale, do of∣fer it to your Lordships Patronage, & assure me of your like good (as former) acceptance. For a good vine yeeldes grapes, still answe∣rable to it nature▪ and an honourable mind, the fruits of an honorable disposition. Long liue, and prosper (ho. Lord). Pater sis Patriae, & Ecclesiae, & Reipublicae charus. So in all hu∣militie, I take leaue. Fleete this 25. of March. 1602.
