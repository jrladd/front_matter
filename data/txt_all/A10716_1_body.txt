ALthough I haue vndertaken (honorable gentlemen) to set down directions for younge Souldiours not yet ful∣ly perfected in Militarie Practise, yet for the bet∣ter experienced (of whō my selfe would gladly be instructed) as I haue not presumed to offer them prescriptions, so I hope they haue no cause to mislike of this mine enterprise. It is now 24. yeres agoe, sith I first vndertooke Armes & serued at New hauen, vn∣der that most honorable Earle of VVarwicke (a father to Souldiours at this day) sithe which time, what I haue either practised by experi∣ence, seene by example, or gathered by Historie concerning Martiality, I haue here set them downe, to the benefit of my countrie men, that are not yet practiled in so honourable and exer∣cise, what faultes I shall commit through ig∣noraunce. I hope you will pardon of curtelie, when they shall proceede rather of the zeale I haue to please, then of any desire I haue to of∣fend: thus submiting altogether to your dis∣creete corrections, I ende.
