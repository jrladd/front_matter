GReat and manifold were the blessings (most dread Sovereign) which Almighty God, the Father of all mercies, bestowed upon us the people of England, when first he sent Your Majesties Royal Person to rule and reign over us. For whereas it was the expectation of many, who wished not well unto our Sion, that upon the setting of that bright Occidental Star Qu. Elizabeth of most happy memory, some thick and palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land, that men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk; and that it should hardly be known, who was to direct the unsettled State: the appearance of Your Majesty, as of the Sun in his strength, instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto all that were well affected, exceeding cause of comfort; especially when we beheld the Govern∣ment established in Your Highness, and Your hopeful Seed, by an undoubted Title, and this also accompanted with peace and tranquility at home and abroad.
But amongst all our joys there was no one that more filled our hearts, then the blessed con∣tinuance of the Preaching of Gods sacred Word amongst us; which is that inestimable trea∣sure, which excelleth all the riches of the earth, because the fruit thereof extendeth it self, not onely to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth and disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.
Then not to suffer this to fall to the ground, but rather to take it up, and to continue it in that state, wherein the famous Predecessour of Your Highness did leave it: nay, to go for∣ward with the confidence and resolution of a man in maintaining the truth of Christ, and propagating it far and near, is that which hath so bound and firmly knit the hearts of all Your Majesties loyal and religious people unto You, that Your very name is precious among them; their eye doth behold You with comfort, and they bless You in their hearts, as that sanctified Person, who under God, is the immediate Authour of their true happiness. And this their contentment doth not diminish or decay, but every day increaseth and taketh strength, when they observe that the zeal of Your Majesty, toward the house of God, doth not flack or go backward, but is more and more kindled, manifesting it self abroad in the fur∣thest parts of Christendom, by writing in defence of the Truth, (which hath given such a blow unto that man of sin, as will not be healed) and every day at home, by religious and learn∣ed discourse, by frequenting the house of God, by hearing the Word preached, by cherishing the Teachers thereof, by caring for the Church, as a most tender and loving nursing Father.
There are infinite Arguments of this right Christian and religious affection in Your Majesty: but none is more forcible to declare it to others, then the vehement and perpetua∣ted desire of the accomplishing and publishing of this work, which now with all humility we present unto Your Majesty. For when Your Highness had once out of deep judgement appre∣hended, how convenient it was, that out of the original sacred Tongues, together with com∣paring of the Labours, both in our own and other foreign Languages, of many worthy men who went before us, there should be one more exact Translation of the holy Scriptures into the English tongue: Your Majesty did never desist to urge and to excite those to whom it was commended, that the Work might be hastned, and that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner, as a matter of such importance might justly require.
And now at last, by the mercy of God, and the continuance of our Labours it being brought unto such a conclusion, as that we have great hope, the Church of England shall reap good fruit thereby, we hold it our duty to offer it to Your Majesty, not onely as to our King and Sove∣reign, but as to the principal Mover and Authour of the Work: Humbly craving of Your most
sacred Majesty, that since things of this quality have ever been subject to the censures of ill-meaning and discontented persons, it may receive approbation and patronage from so learned and judicious a Prince as Your Highness is, whose allowance and acceptance of our Labors, shall more honour and encourage us, then all the calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us. So that, if on the one side we shall be traduced by Popish persons at home or abroad, who therefore will malign us, because we are poor instruments to make Gods holy Truth to be yet more and more known unto the people, whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and darkness: or if on the other side, we shall be maligned by self-conceited brethren, who run their own ways, and give liking unto nothing, but what is framed by themselves, and hammered on their anvile: we may rest secure, supported within by the truth and innocency of a good conscience, having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity, as before the Lord; And sustained without, by the powerfull protection of Your Majesties Grace and Favour, which will ever give countenance to honest and Christian endeavours, against bitter censures, and uncharitable imputations.
The Lord of heaven and earth bless Your Majesty with many and happy days, that as his hea∣venly hand hath enriched Your Highness with many singular and extraordinary graces; so You may be the wonder of the world in this latter age, for happiness and true felicity, to the honour of that great God, and the good of his Church, through Jesus Christ our Lord and onely Saviour.
