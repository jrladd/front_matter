Right Honourable,
THE great and undeser∣ved
Favours for many
years conferred on me
by your noble Ance∣stors,
with those which I
still receive from your self, and o∣her
their Survivors, encourage me

to present to your Lordship this
Piece, now called to be made pub∣lic
a second time; humbly begging
your acceptance and protection of
what I tender in acknowledgment
of my Duty and Service. The Part
formerly printed, and what is ad∣ded
thereto, are most fit to be laid
at your Honour's Feet, having recei∣ved
allowance from your Honoura∣ble
Family to be made public, and
most of it practised among them,
for the special use of those Noble
Persons, who are now gone from us;
and for whose memory I could not
transcribe with dry eyes. What
their Loss vvas to the Public, is
vvell known, and no less lament∣ed;
and so great to me, that I can
never forget it.
The Right Honourable, your
Father, was pleased to shew me
greater Favour than I do pretend

to deserve. Your Right Honoura∣ble
Mother was seldom ill at home
or abroad, without commanding
my attendance: The same have the
Right Honourable your Brothers and
your Lordship done. By whom
scarce any thing was taken without
my thoughts, from the most eminent
Physicians, till they became ac∣quainted
with their Bodies. In all
which Services it pleased God, I so
ordered my self, that I have had
from your Physicians, not only thanks
but commendation. Which I have
always looked on as proceeding more
from the Favour of your Honour's
Family, than my Deserts.
These Obligations under which I
lie, have given your Lordship the
trouble of this Dedication, and this
poor Piece, which I here present with
my hearty and humble Prayers for all
and each of your Honourable Family,

that they may receive the greatest of
God's Favours here, and the full en∣joyment
of Himself in Bliss hereafter:
Which is and shall be the continued
Petitions of,
Warwick,
March 25.
1679.
