I Doe not dedicate these to delight
Or profit you, both are the Authors right:
Nor is it that your Highnesse may protect
My part, it merits not so much respect;
Nor that you may examine and compare,
It lesse deserves such serious Princely care:
Nor is it gratitude, because y' have been
Pleas'd to approve some others you have seen:
Since retribution so farre below
Proportion, would be worse then still to owe:
Nor vanity, that thus I may have leave
To tell the world the honour I receive,
In that my name hath reacht your sacred eare:
I hate that emptie vice; yet need not feare

The censure, were it just since 't would make proud
The staidest thoughts to be by you allow'd.
If any aske me, What is then my end?
'Tis to approve my selfe a reall friend
To chaste Lauretta, whom since I have tane
From the dark Cloyster, where she did remain
Unmarkt, because unknown, my aime is now
To make her happy, by attending you:
Where she may see her truest worth outgone,
And learn more vertue then she yet hath known
