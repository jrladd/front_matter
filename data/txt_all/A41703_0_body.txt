SIR,
I Need not here the Servile Path pursue,
By doing what most Dedicators do;
Lay out their Patron's Vertues on a Stall,
Like Pedlars Ware, to please the Crowd withall,
And be despis'd by the Judicious Eye,
Which does but look, and loath, and pass regardless by:
Your Merit speaks itself; A Poet's Care
In lofty Praise wou'd be superfluous there:
What need that Man in a Fool's Coat be shown,
That has one very graceful of his own?
I wave that Subject then, your gen'rous Mind,
Wit, Judgment, Converse, and what else we find,
So Lov'd, Admir'd, and Courted by Mankind,
And humbly at your Feet this worthless Tribute lay,
I owe You much, and blush I can so little pay.
Sir,
