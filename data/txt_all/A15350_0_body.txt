MOst dread Soueraigne:
GOd which hath put the Globe of this little world into the hands of your rule, doth in the bottomlesse graces wherewith he hath imbrodered your Scepter, merite your thankefulest recognition of his diuine goodnesse, in whose bosome their Spring ariseth, and oblige the Christian Nations of your Kingdomes in straightest bonds of loyaltie vnto your Sacred Person, the next and immediate Conduit by which all happinesse is deriued vnto them.
Your Highnesse religious affections to the seruice of God, experienced in those effects of your royall desires with best offices to glorifie his eminent and eternall being,
 hath a most sure promise of blessings from the immortall rewarder of holy workes. And for so much as your Ma∣iestie in your admirable wisdome studying by all meanes to continuate the tranquill peace of the Gospell, hath seene it necessarie to propose, and by intimation of your gratious pleasure inioyned one vniforme order of wor∣ship due to Gods diuine excellencie. The Subiects of your Dominions whose toungs are the true witnesses of their hearts, to acknowledge that supreame Power which is in existent in your princely rule, will not faile by their cheerefull obedience the true workemaister of happy State, to manifest their religion to God, and submission to your iust commaund!
If any through a wanton Superfluitie of fancie, shall disaccustome their deuotiue actions from the traine wherevnto your Lawes would range them: God shall in time reueale better things vnto their apprehension, and by their industrie, whom your Maiestie hath deputed for the administration of gouerment, frame them to that method of deuotion which in the Prerogatiue of your wisdome is prescribed vnto all.
In meane time, I know he which shall oppose himselfe against this euill, now growne headdie by custome and suffrance of time, lyes open for the racket of mallice to band him into the hazard of vndoing, the thoughts whereof se∣conded with the knowledge of my owne disabilitie, to write in a matter of so great consequence, had kept me resolute in my resolued silence, but that my priuate cons∣cience, and sorrowe to see this vnnaturall distraction, wherein the body doth refuse to follow the will of the head, counterpoized the validitie of all other opposite
 respects, and gaue confidence in your Maiestie for my pro∣tection, who hauing nothing better then my selfe to bestow vpon your Maiestie, do with best alacrity of spirit, de∣uote and giue my all, to be disponed at your Princely pleasure.
God which ballanceth the times, prolong the time of your most glorious Regiment, and so strengthen your sacred power in the continuance of that vnmatchable goodnesse, wherewith he hath honoured all your liues time, that when the time of times shall come, wherein time shall be without time, you may be receiued into his timelesse eternitie.
