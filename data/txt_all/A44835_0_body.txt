John Tombs,
IS it not a shame for thee, who art ealled a Baptist, thus to manifest thy sel, and divide thy self from thy own people? Hast thou not taught people to swear, first one way, and then anther? Did ever any of the Apostles so in the Primitive times? But on the contrary, that people should not swear at all. And why dost thou bring the Scrip∣ture that was spoken to the Jewes, and apply it to the Christians? And why dost thou bring the Scripture where the Angel sware, but brings not the Scripture which saith, All Angels must worship the Son who saith, Swear not at all? So is not this like Anti-christ, and Anti-Apostle, that preaches up that which Christ and the Apostles denyed, as in Matth. 5. and James 5. And whereas thou saist in thy Epistle, that thy writing is short and indigested, in that thou hast said truly; for how can they that fear God digest it, seeing it is so contrary unto Christ and the Apotles Doctrine? And so both thou and it are become an ill savour to God and them that love him; but thou shalt be rewarded according to thy work But God hath made thee manifest, who hath so long been hiding thy self under so many false coverings, but now art dis∣covred, that thou should no more deceive the Nation.
