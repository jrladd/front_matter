IT is not out of ambition (most excellent Prince) to get vnto my selfe a more particular name, then the mea∣nest Groome in your Highnesse Sta∣ble, which hath moued me to offer vn∣to your sacred handes, this poore vo∣lume of mine experience in this Arte, which euen from mine infancie I haue pursued so farre forth, as either mine abilitie or obscuritie had power to extēd it self. But because it hath pleased God through the glorie of your countenance to giue a new life to this Art, which not long agoe was so much neglected, that I thinke (if it had beene possible for vertue, to haue receiued so greate a staine) it would haue drawn neare to the danger of dispising; so many vnfurnished stables, like vnpeopled townes, and so many worthie spirits (ignorant in the noblest action) beeing prophetique signes of following desolution, but by your high∣nesse fauours it is not repayred (for that were but to pecce vp olderuines) but there is (as it were) a new and an eternall foun∣dation

laid, which will continue til al the corners of the world be consumed: which as it hath inflamed mee to offer vp this tribute of my zeale and knowledge, so I wish it would like∣wise kindle some sparkes in others, who hauing attained the top and height of all best perfectiō, might leaue vnto the world some famous recordes of their worthie admirations; and not by their neglect, suffer a deuine gift to perish with their na∣turall bodies, knowing that if either Xenophon, Russius, or Grison had beene so vncharitable, they should themselues with much more difficultie haue attained to that in which nowe they haue no equall; and being by them manifested vn∣to the world, they shall not onely blesse and make happie poste∣ritie, but also so acertaine vncertaine resolutions, that how euer the world shall boast eyther Spaine, France or Italie, yet it shall then be knowne, that they haue not brought foorth so good Horsemen as haue beene bred, and are now liuing in this Empire of great Brittaine, to whome albe the world may im∣magine I haue broken the way with too great bouldnesse, yet mine humble soule knowes, I haue doone it with such care and zeale, that they shall neither taske me for absurditie, or misaplycation, to which I will not be able eyther by arte or de∣monstration to giue an account or satisfaction; holding it in my selfe a sin vnpardonable to offer to your gracious presence that which shall not taste both of true art, and true duetie: and how euer the first may be mistaken, yet the latter shall be so much vnblemished, that (though a wor me) yet my faith shall not be exceeded, but I will liue and dye your highnes Beades-man and vassaile.
