OWing to your pro∣tection, supream Senat, this libertie of

writing which I have us'd these 18 years on all occasions to assert the just rights and freedoms both of church and state, and so far approv'd, as to have bin trusted with the representment and defence of your actions to all Chri∣stendom against an

adversarie of no mean repute, to whom should I ad∣dress what I still pub∣lish on the same ar∣gument, but to you whose magnanimous councels first opend and unbound the age from a double bond∣age under prelatical and regal tyrannie;

above our own hopes heartning us to look up at last like men and Christians from the slavish de∣jection, wherin from father to son we were bred up and taught; and thereby deserving of these nations, if they be not barbarously in∣grateful,

to be ac∣knowledgd, next under God, the au∣thors and best pa∣trons of religious and civil libertie, that ever these Ilands brought forth. The care and tuition of whose peace and safety, after a short but scandalous night

of interruption, is now again by a new dawning of Gods miraculous provi∣dence among us, re∣volvd upon your shoulders. And to whom more apper∣tain these considera∣tions which I pro∣pound, then to your selves and the debate

before you, though I trust of no difficul∣tie, yet at present of great expectation, not whether ye will gratifie, were it no more then so, but whether ye will hearken to the just petition of many thousands best af∣fected both to religi∣on

and to this your returne, or whether ye will satisfie, which you never can, the covetous pretences and demands of in∣satiable hirelings, whose disaffection ye well know both to your selves and your resolutions. That I, though among many

others in this com∣mon concernment, interpose to your de∣liberations what my thoughts also are, your own judgment and the success ther∣of hath given me the confidence: which requests but this, that if I have prosperous∣ly, God so favoring

me, defended the publick cause of this commonwealth to foreiners, ye would not think the reason and abilitie, wheron ye trusted once, and repent not, your whole reputation to the world, either grown less by more maturitie and longer

studie, or less avail∣able in English then in another tongue: but that if it suffic'd som years past to convince and satisfie the uningag'd of o∣ther nations in the justice of your do∣ings, though then held paradoxal, it may as well suffice

now against weaker opposition in mat∣ters, except here in England (with a spi∣ritualtie of men de∣voted to thir tempo∣ral gain,) of no con∣troversie els among Protestants. Nei∣ther do I doubt, seeing daily the ac∣ceptance which they▪

finde who in thir petitions venture to bring advice also and new modells of a commonwealth, but that you will inter∣pret it much more the dutie of a Chri∣stian to offer what his conscience per∣swades him may be of moment to the

freedom and better constituting of the church:) since it is a deed of highest charitie to help un∣deceive the people, and a work worthiest your autoritie, in all things els authors, assertors and now recoverers of our li∣bertie, to deliver us,

the only people of all Protestants left still undeliverd, from the oppressions of a Simonious decima∣ting clergie; who shame not against the judgment and practice of all other churches reformd, to maintain, though very weakly, thir

Popish and oft re∣futed positions, not in a point of consci∣ence, wherin they might be blameles, but in a point of co∣vetousnes and un∣just claim to other mens goods; a con∣uention foul and odi∣ous in any man, but most of all in mini∣sters

of the gospel, in whom contention, though for thir own right, scarce is al∣lowable. Till which greevances be re∣mov'd and religion set free from the mo∣nopolie of hirelings, I dare affirme, that no modell whatso∣ever of a common∣wealth

will prove succesful or undi∣sturbd; and so per∣swaded, implore di∣vine assistance on your pious councels and proceedings to unanimitie in this and all other truth.
