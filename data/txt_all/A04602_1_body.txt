WOrshipfull and beloued my parishioners, hauing found out God-mothers for this infant of mine, it remaines now, that I intreate you all at once to play the God-fathers part for the na∣ming of it. And so much the rather I intreate you, and hope you will be wil∣ling, aboue others, to performe this duty, because you, best of all others, know the birth of it, being conceiued and brought forth especially for your sakes: the originall being Sermons which I preached here amongst you; and you I hope somwhat haue profited by them. The law prouides, that where the childe is borne, there (be it neuer

so base) it should be kept, and you must foster what is hatched amongst you. Accept then kindly what is kindly meant towards you, and continue to loue him whose prayer is for you all to loue one another. Almightie God in∣crease his loue towards you, and cause you, that as you are ioyned together in friendly neighbour-hood, so you may be ioyned in heartie affection one vn∣to the other: so that when this life shall haue end, as you haue liued and loued together here, so you may all ioyne with the rest of the heauenly quire in singing louely hymnes vnto the God of loue. And in that confi∣dence I take my leaue, and commit you all to his protection, who for his power is able, and for his exceeding loue, wil keepe you all in the bond of loue. Fare∣well. From my house in S. Nicholas lane, this ninth of March. 1615.
