SIR,
WHen I look on the
Crest of your ancient
Arms, (A Mitre
powdered Wth Cros∣ses)
I read therein an abridgment

of the Devotion of those darker
dayes: the Mitre shewing your
Ancestors actions in Peace; the
Cross, their atchievements in the
Holy War: the Mitre, their
doings at home; the Cross, their
darings abroad.
Yea I fancie to my self each an∣cient
Lord Berkly, like one of the
Israelites at the walling of Jerusa∣lem,
Neh. 4. 17. With a Trowel
in one hand, and a Sword in the
other. We alwayes find him ei∣ther
fighting or founding, either in
a Battel or at the building of some
Religious Fabrick, as (besides
others) the intire Abbey at Bri∣stol,
(afterwards converted into a

Cathedral) was solely founded by
one of that Family.
This was the Devotion of those
dayes, wherein the world knew no
better, and scarce any other. Since
the Reformation, your Noble
House hath not had less heat for
having more light. Your Charity
hath not been extinguished, but re∣gulated,
not drained dry, but de∣rived
in righter channels; and
flowing with a clearer stream free
from the mud of superstition.
As for your particular, that
your ancient Crest is worthily born
by you, the Mitre speaking you a
Patron of Learning; the Crosses,
a Practicer of Religion. Qualities

which encouraged me to present
this small Treatise unto you.
Acceptance is more then it can ex∣pect,
pardon being as much as it doth
deserve, being so long in coming,
so short when come. But because
it had its first Being by your Com∣mand,
it hopes to have its well∣being
by your Countenance.
Should I desire so many Lords
of your Family hereafter, as here∣tofore
have flourished in a direct
line, by desiring a particular Hap∣piness
to your House, I should wish
a general mischief to mankind; that
men should live so many years in
sin & sorrow before the coming of
the necessary and comfortable day

of Judgment. My prayer there∣fore
shall be, That the lustre of your
House may continue with the last∣ing
of the World, (so long as God
will permit the badness thereof) in
that honourable Equipage of your
Ancestors: May Perfection here,
and Peace hereafter light on you,
your vertuous Lady, and hopeful
issue; which is the daily desire of
