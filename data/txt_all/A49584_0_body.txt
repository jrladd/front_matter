Right Honourable and Worshipful;
WHAT open Defiance hath of late been given to all the Sacred Mysteries of the Gospel, what barefaced Opposition hath been made to the Christian Faith, is well known, and is sadly Lamented
 by every serious and considerate Man. The labouring Press doth, almost every day, produce some sly Pamphlet or other; the design of which, is to Un∣dermine our most Holy Religion, and Ridicule and Scoff at all the Professors of it: Nor do these things steal secret∣ly into our Hands, or by their Privacy betray an inward Shame in the Au∣thor, but every Page doth publickly declare, that the Publisher of it is a profess'd Enemy to the Faith of Christ. The Opposition is made with so much Courage and Boldness, that a meer Stranger would hardly believe Christi∣anity to be the Religion of our Country, or that the Gospel had the Protection of the Law to guard it. The design therefore of the following Discourse, is, to point out and discover some of these Adversaries, and by showing how  dangerous they are, to raise our Spirits, and call up that Courage which so well becomes those, who ought to be the Assertors of it, and whose Duty it is to contend earnestly for the Faith. That God would please to assist and protect those who stand up vigorously in Defence of our most Holy Religion, and at last bring us all to an Unity in the Faith, is the hearty Prayer of,
Right Honourable and Worshipful,
