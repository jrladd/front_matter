Honour'd SIR,
IF so considerable a Name as Mrs. Behn's did not justifie my Choice of your Pa∣tronage, Sir, for the following Novel, I might perhaps be thought too presump∣tuous, in sheltring the Unhappy Fortunate under your Name: But being secur'd by her establish'd Reputation from injuring yours, I gave way to that Desire I had to shew my self in the Number of your Admirers. For there being a sort of Merit in admiring Me∣rit, every one that has the least Ambition, wou'd desire to shew himself Master of that Desert.
Your Vertues as well as Fortunes are too conspicuous not to be observ'd by all; your Af∣fability, Generosity, Goodness are what give Hope to your Inferiours, and Comfort and

Satisfaction to your Equals, and Admiration to all: For 'tis seldom that Fortune alone can draw our Hearts tho' it draw our Eyes, but when embellish'd with such Qualifications it makes the Possessour truly Great and Happy, as well as Rich.
'Tis well, Sir, I am no Panegerist, I shou'd else, on so engaging a Theme, be apt to forget the Violence I did your Modesty, in the Satisfaction I found in the Contempla∣tion of your Excellencies: But I leave that Task to happier Pens, and content my self with the generous Ambition of what my Stars deny me, and only heg leave to subscribe my self, Sir,
Your most obedient and devoted Servant,
