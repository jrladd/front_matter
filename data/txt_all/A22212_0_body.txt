SEinge the tyme and sea¦son
of gostly & spiritual warr̄ / that
is the holy tyme of lente
approcheth nere / & with his
gostly trumpet calleth euery
man and woman to his stan¦derd
and place / thereto resist
by harde & sharpe penance / by continual prayer
and fast / by abstinence from iniquite and volup∣tuous
pleasure / by gyuynge of almes / & doynge
other charitable dedes / our gostly ennemie the
dyuell / whiche with out reste / by nyght & daye / by
see and lāde sercheth whom he may deuoure:Luc. 3.
and brynge to perpetuall payne:Luc. 21. I thought hit
therfore very necessary and greatly expedient to
inuent and fynde some wayes and crafte (speci∣ally
for the vnlerned people) to withstande the
forsayde disceytfull and pusant ēnemie:Tob. 4. 1. Pe. 5. whiche
thynge this my littel boke (if I be nat disceiued)

and so that ye reder all though he haue but small
lernynge / diligently listen therto / and folowe the
frutefull preceptes therof / shal be with fewe wor¦des
so instructed / and so strongly armed / that he
shall quickely {per}ceyue hym selfe to be inuincible / and
of habilite to fight / also (by goddis grace) to
withstande his ennemye and optayne victorie.
This kynde of spiritual warre is nothinge lyke
the warr̄ of this worlde. In this spiritual warr̄
(if we wyll) be hit neuer so tedious / we be euerSap̄. 7
more sure of victorie / of good name and fame / &
by cōtinuance / of ioye euerlastynge. Whiche ioye
and {per}petuall pleasure they that ensue your wise
dome / your good and vertuous disposition / do
highlyer esteme than any worldly rychesse / whi∣che
worldly thynges be euer more as fletynge / as
celestial be stedfaste. O than what a differēce
is this / yea what a pleasure to be sure of victory
and ther with ioye euerlastynge? And bicause I
haue consydered / that your vertuous lyuynge / your
continuance in goodnes / and perfit loue to
the cōmunaltie / may besydes the goodly and me
dicinable preceptes of this boke / the sooner pro∣uoke
the people to folowe goddis cōmandemen∣tes
/ to leaue their vicious lyuynge / and to arme
and prepare them selfe to withstande the mali∣ciousnes
of our myghtifull and horrible ēnemy
the dyuell: after I had longe ymagined / I vt∣terly
determyned to dedicate this my rude trās∣lacion
to your grace: that if neyther for goddis

sake / nor by meanes of this boke they wyll nat
refrayne frō vice / yet they redynge your name / and
remembrynge your vertuous disposytion / your
clene lyfe and chastite / shalbe the redyer to
hate yll and ensewe vertue / the prompter to for∣sake
vanishynge pleasure / to enioye parpetual:Ro. 12.
and so either folowinge Christis standerde / that
is Christis preceptes / orels the clene and pure
lyfe of some good christen womā / that is of your
grace / they shall at the laste victoriously opteyne
(by goddis grace) the crowne and glorye of he∣uen.
For truely who so wyll opteyne victorie and
the fauour of god / and {per}ceyue the feates of this
spirituall warre / he muste leaue all vicious ly∣uynge
and grondly obserue goddis cōmaunde∣mentes
/ & folowe vertue.Mat. 19 For as vice is distroy∣er
of all thinges / so vertue in this felde / as in al
other causes is chiefe gouernour and maistres.Mar. 10
And to them parauenture that shall maruayle / wherfore
I haue dedicated this my boke vnto
your excellence / rather than to any other man / I
saye that I can nat parceyue / but that womē
and specially in this goostly warre / yea or in any
other / maye and haue gyuen to euery creature
bothe spirituall and temporall instructions and
ryght great lernynge. What instruction and ex∣ample
of vertue gaue to all Christen people the
noble warriour saynct Catharine? The inuinci∣ble
martyr saynct Margaret? The hardy cham¦pion
saynt Barbara? The wyse captayne saynt

Vrsula / with suche other? And howe strongly
warred (I speake of pagannes)Iust. li. 2. Penthasilea / quene
of Amazons?Prop. li. 3. Cleopatra quene of Egypt?
Cannubula quene of Volscorum?Verg. li. 7 And Hasbi∣tes?
With suche other noble womē?Sil. lib. 1. What hun∣ger
/ what thyrste / what heate / and what colde
enduredde they for a lyttel vayne glory of this
wretched worlde? If they than for these worldly
vanites / so wauerynge / so inconstant / and so ca∣duke
/ suffred with good wyll and gladly / all he∣uynes
/ all paynes / and all sorowe: What labour
& trauayle shulde be greuous yea or seme peyne
full to vs Christis soudiours and seruauntes to
conquere vertue to folowe goddis cōmandemen¦tes / and
to enioye / ioye euerlastynge? Consyde∣rynge
than / that this warre for mannes soule
helthe is very necessary and holsome / I praye
and exhorte eche one to rede this lyttell treatise / conteynynge
the armour therof / and grondly to
folowe and continue in the profitable exhortaci∣ons
of the same. For why to rede only and nat to
practise that thou haste redde / is nothynge. So
it maye be redde and folowed / that for vice man
shall opteyne vertue / and after the calamite and
wretchednes of this myserable worlde / perpetu¦all
ioye and pleasure. Thus I commende me
your dayly oratour to your excellence / desi∣rynge
your grace fauourably
to accepte this my
small boke.
