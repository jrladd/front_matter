THIS Sermon by me tran∣slated
out of latine into en∣glysh
I dedicate vnto you,
not so moch for instruction
as for a token of the good
mynd I beare you. For whā
I consyder your syncere affection to god
and his holy worde, your great fidelytie
and dilygence towarde our moste gracy∣ous
souerayne lorde the kyng, your pure
honest and lowly behauiour to all men in
worde and dede, your faythful, wyse, and
frendly councels, your continuall exhor∣tations
and perswasyons to vertue, your
lyberall and moste gentylle nature, I can
not chose but vehemently loue you, and
therfore I ofte thynke what I haue, or
howe I a poore man myght doo you any
pleasure. Wherefore suche thynge as I
maye gyue, with my entier hartes loue
I sende you. And as this my booke go∣eth
on prayer, soo pray I, God sende you
abundaunce of all welthe and good For∣tune
this newe yere.
