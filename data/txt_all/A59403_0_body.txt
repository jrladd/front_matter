Beloved Brethren,
IT is altogether needless that I should tell you, our great Benefactor, from whom we derive the Original both of our Being and Well-being, and receive all the Mercies we enjoy both as Men and as Christians, hath not only called us to do, but to suffer likewise. Nor is
 there any occasion for me to remember you, that our Blessed Redeemer hath left us an example for the one as well as for the other; I question not but your Ʋn∣derstandings are sufficiently furnished with the knowledg thereof; but since you are at present silenced, and by the Com∣mand of Authority forbid to Preach, and hindred from the Performing the Publick Part of your Ministerial Work, I have presumed to collect some things out of what you have formerly written, for the benefit and support of those who are for the same Cause of Noncon∣formity involved in the same Suffer∣ings with your selves, that so you may speak to them even in your silence, and furnish them with Arguments to bear up their Souls from sinking in a day of Perplexity and Trouble. Your Preach∣ing and their Hearing, is now become a Crimc, in the sence of the Law; but by this means you may Preach, and they may Hear, you may instruct them how,
 and they may safely learn to imitate the great Example of their Lord and Ma∣ster Jesus Christ, in a patient and joy∣ful bearing of the Cross, without mur∣muring or repining, & that too, without so much as the pretence of a Crime. For any number of Dissenters to meet toge∣ther in a solemn manner, to Pray and Preach and hear Sermons, is now be∣come dangerous; but blessed be God there is no Law as yet that forbids the Read∣ing of those Books which are written by Dissenting Ministers.
Suffering is an unpleasing, but no un∣usual thing to the Followers of Christ, for we find them in all ages scorned and derided, Persecuted and Afflicted, and accounted unworthy to live. And the Blessed Jesus himself informs us, That those who will be his Disciples must take up their Cross and follow him; Telling us, That the World will hate us, because, we are not of the World, and that we shall be Persecuted for
 his Sake, and cast out of the Syna∣gogues. And the Apostle assures us, That through many Tribulations we must inherit the Kingdom.
And indeed it is no wonder that Chri∣stians meet with Persecution and Trou∣ble in the World, since our Lord him∣self, when he was on the earth, met with no better entertainment; they have been often charged with many horrid and malitious Crimes, so was our Savi∣our; they have been said to be enemies to the Church and State, so was he; they have been accused not to be Caesars Friends, so was he; nay, there is scarce any Crime how horrid and false soever, that has been charged upon Christians, but was first charged upon him; his ve∣ry Miracles were affirmed to be the effect of Magick, and his Mercy and Com∣passion to Sinners, interpreted a con∣niving at, and favouring of their wickedness. His Goodness in Heal∣ing the Sick, Releiving the Possessed,
 and Restoring Limbs to the Lame, and Eyes to the Blind, was ungratefully rewarded with attempts to Stone him, and frequent Consultations and Plots to bereave him of his Life. And indeed his whole Life from the Manger to the Cross was nothing else but a continued Series of Trouble and Misery. As soon as he was Born, Herod sought to kill him, and the Jews afterwards; Judas he Betrays him, the Chief Priests and Elders apprehend him. Some bind him, others lead him bound to the High-Priests Pallace, there he is scorn∣ed and derided, Buffeted and Spit up and forced to linger out a whole nig in Pain and Torture. He is haled a∣way to Pilate, Pilate sends him bound to Herod, Herod aend his Men of War set him at naught and deride him, and return him bound to Pilate: Pilate notwithstanding he knew him to be innocent, yet he first scourged him, and then condemned him to be Crucified,
 in order whereunto he was delivered into the hands of a company of Cruel Tormenters, who never left Torturing of him, till his Soul left his Body, and they saw him hang dead on the Cross. So that I hope none will wonder if Religion cost them dear, and expose them to to the scorn and derision, ma∣lice and hatred of the World.
And it is worth our observation, that in all or most of the Persecutions which had been raised since Christ, there hath ever been many false and malitious Reports raised upon the Sufferers as if by being guilty of strange and horrid Crimes, they had justly deserved the se∣vere usage wherewith they were treated. When Rome was burnt by Nero, it was malitiously reported that the Chri∣stians had done it, and thereupon a severe Persecution against all the Pro∣fessors of Christianity immediately fol∣lowed, and so in all the rest of the Ten Persecutions; If there was a Famine, the Christians procured it; if a Pesti∣lence,
 the Christians were blamed as those whose wickedness pulled down the Judg∣ment upon them; if their Armies were beaten, the fault was presently laid at the Christians door, and the most vio∣lent Persecutions stirred up against them.
Now to direct those in, and support them under their Sufferings, who either are or may be called thereunto, is the design of the ensuing Tract, which con∣sists of two parts; First a brief Relati∣on of the Sufferings of Jesus Christ, which as they are an Example for us to imitate, so they afford infinite encou∣ragement to us in our Sufferings. The Second is a Collection of several of your Worthy Sayings concerning Persecution; carefully gathered from your several Works. And all of them serving ei∣ther to incourage us under, or direct us how to improve our Sufferings, so as to be gainers by them, and prove the un∣just and scandalous Reports of our Ene∣mies,
 who affirm us to be a seditious and a disloyal people, false and malitious, by a patient and a quiet submitting to the Cross, and thereby leave a Testimony of our Innocency in the Consciences of our most inveterate Adversaries.
And in the mean time presuming upon your pardon for thus intruding upon you, that which many of you will know to be your own so soon as you have perused it; I heartily wish that the Peace of God which passeth all Un∣derstanding, may so fill your hearts and minds, as to preserve you from being either disquieted or disheartened by your present Sufferings, and sub∣scribe my self
