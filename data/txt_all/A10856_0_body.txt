WAlking in my Garden of good will (Right Honou∣rable,) I could find no bet∣ter Flowers, then those that spring from faithful Loue, bound with the bond of dutie, to make my labours gracious in your thoughts. Loue to your Honour, sprung from the roote of your Lord and Grandfa∣thers bountifull and most Honourable kindnesse to∣wards my Father, who was (vntill his dying day) his true and obedient Seruant. Duetie bindeth me, for that I was my selfe sometimes Seruant vnto the

Right Honourable, THOMAS Earle of Excester, your Honours vncle, and alwaies haue tasted of the comfortable liberalitie, of your Honours Father; for whose sake (next vnder God) I craue your Ho∣nours Pardon, for this my bold attempt. Thus bree∣ding (Right Honourable) as it were a protection from your Pardon: I most humbly leaue you to the Lord, and betake my selfe to my Prayers for your Honours health and prosperitie in all con∣digne dignitie.
