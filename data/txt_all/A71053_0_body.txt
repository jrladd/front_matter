I Have but the thoughts of an afternoon to spread before you, for I examined the same pace that I read; that if it were possible, a truth might over∣take an errour ere it got too farre. It is not a little encouragement that I may sit like the Prophetesse under the Palmetree, under such a shade as your selves; and what weaknesse soever may ap∣peare in these my assertions, This ayring them un∣der your Patronage will heale them, for so they brought forth the sick into the streets, that at least the shadow of Peter might touch some of them. Thus

have I suddenly set up my Candle for others to light their Torch at; and I hope you will pardon me, if my zeale to the truth, made mee see anothers faults sooner than my own.
