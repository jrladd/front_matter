LAdyes, in Elder times your sexe did neede,
Knight-hoods true valour to defend your rights,
Of admirable actions wee doe reede,
Haue beene atchiu'd in cruell bloody Fights.
Fell vgly Serpents were destroy'd and slaine,
Strange moÌ„sters mangled, Gyants hew'd in twaine.


But who deseru'd more in such enterprise,
Then worthy English, bred where wee are borne?
Such as did ease and idlenes despise,
For Armour more then Silke by them was worne.
These were the Champions that for Ladyes good,
Would bleede as long as they had drops of blood.


Such was Sir Guy, whose story heere wee tell,
Valours renowned honourable man:
He lou'd your kinde (in heart) exceeding well,
How can you chuse but loue his legend than?
Bestow the Reading of it if you please:
Gainst melancholy, that same dull disease.
