And as nothing is more agree∣able to the Office of a Magistrate, or to the Duty of a Christian than Justice, so I do most heartily re∣commend this great Truth to the serious Consideration of all; and particularly of your self: Adding my Prayers unto God for you, That he would endow you with
all those Gifts, that are necessary for your Office, and make you faithful in it; which is the most proper Expression of my Regards to you, who am,
