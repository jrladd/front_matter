THe Consideration, that
to finde out a certaine
Rule for this Princely
Game of Chesse, is generally,
(and I think, justly) estee∣med
to be impossible, was
the first cause that invited me
to publish these Gambetts,
which doe, in a very great
measure, supply the defect of

such an advantage, which in
respect they were in the De∣lights
of his late Majesty,
and many of the Nobility of
these Kingdomes, I presumed
to dedicate unto your Ho∣nour,
whom I have under∣stood
not onely to take plea∣sure,
but to be very judici∣ous
in this Incomparable Re∣creation,
beside the particular
relation of the Duty I have
to submit my self, on all oc∣casions,
unto your Honours
Censure and Commands,
and the necessity I have of

desiring your Lordships Pro∣tection
for that I have at∣tempted
to publish, that which
some Gentlemen have alrea∣dy
in Manuscript, and perad∣venture
to their displeasure;
Instructions also for Learners
being already in Print, and
very plaine, might have de∣terr'd
me from medling, as it
were, wth another mans work;
but for these, I have excuse,
that these Gambetts being so
beneficiall, cannot but be very
acceptable, and also give in∣vitation
to those who are but

small Proficients, to take a
greater delight, than formerly,
in this Pastime; and alterati∣on
of the Instructions being
made more brief, are conse∣quently
more usefull. I am
onely therefore to crave your
Honours Pardon, for distur∣bing
your Honours more se∣rious
Contemplations with
these trifles; which if I have,
I shall rest secure from Ca∣lumny,
that can be throwne
upon
