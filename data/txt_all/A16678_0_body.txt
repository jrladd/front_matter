TO sit secure and in a safe repose,
To view the crosse occurrences of those
Who are on Sea; or in a silent shade,
To eye the state of such as are decay'd;
Or neere some siluer Rill or Beechy Groue,
To reade how Starre-crost louers lost their loue,
Is best of humane blessings, and this best
Is in your worthy selfe (Deere Cuz) exprest,
Who by your fathers vertues and your owne
Are truly lou'd, whereseuer you are knowne:
In State secure, rich in a faithfull make,
And rich in all that may secure your State.
Now in these dayes of yours, these Halcion daies,
Where you enioy all ioy, peruse these layes,

That you who liu'd to loue, liue where you loue,
May reade what you nere felt, nor ere did proue;
Poore Swainlins crost where they affected most,
And crost in that which made them euer crost.
Receiue this Poem, Sir, for as I liue,
Had I ought better, I would better giue.
