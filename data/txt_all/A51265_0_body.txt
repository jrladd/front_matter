FRee Accesse (Sir) the Muses plead. Repute
This boldnesse, as conceiv'd to contribute
By Strong desires, that while all eyes observe
Your Motions, famisht hopes no more may starve.
God and your Kingdomes Call. The set tim's come
For Christ, in your Dominions to make rowme.
Beside our Violated Mariage-Band,
Blood cryes for vengeance, 'gainst the Traytrous hand
Of impious Parricids. To plead the last,
And act for proper intrsts, Christs o'repast,
Or judg't but next in Order, (as a way
Prepostrous) your designes endanger may.
Go to, Brave Prince; by heavens thy Heart be gain'd,
Seal'd for the Work, that (surety thus obtain'd)
Thy hand attesting, Thine, in Truths defence
Thy Standart may attend, with confidence.
This Solstice breeds amazement: How all eyes
Wait till thou mount thy Coach and climb the Skyes,
That Influence and Vertue, issueing thence
Inferiour Bodies, brought again to sense,
Long in the generall death detain'd, may see
Day once more dawne, renew'd by light from Thee.
Weigh with delayes the consequences fear'd,
Remembring, that attempts which scarce have dar'd
Peep forth at first for their deformity,
Have gain'd, upon acquaintance of the eye.
And when to ripenesse and full strength attain'd,
Smiles have alike and frownes been entertaind.
