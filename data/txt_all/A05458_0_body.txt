MY Lorde, epigrames are a scarse worke, they haue e∣uer had but fewe writers, and yet too many; If my booke please not, yet this, I shalbe sure of rare discommendations, the grea∣test

aduenture that I knowe: is to write, mens iudgemēts are of so many fashions, yet this is my comfort that my booke is of the fashion. If the com∣mon manners commend him, he hath giuen them no cause. If anie obiect to my calling this kinde of writing: in other things I woulde be glad to ap∣proue my studie to your good Lord∣shippe. These are the accomptes of my Idlenes. Yet herein I may seeme to haue done somthing worthy the price

of Labour, that I haue taught Epigrams to speake chastlie besides I haue ac∣quainted them with more grauitie of sence, and barring them of their olde libertie, not onelie forbidden them to be personall, but turned all their bitter∣nesse rather into sharpenesse. But the worke it selfe, (in regard of which I most humbly craue your honors patronage) doth in the nature and kinde thereof deliuer me of an Epistle, and bidds it giue place to an Epigrame,

IF I my Pen an higher taske should set,
Great Lord, what better matter could I finde,
Then of thy worth and vertue to entreate,
Of thy heroicke spirite and noble minde:
Now take my gnatt, and try me in a toye,
Whether hereafter I may sing of Troye.
