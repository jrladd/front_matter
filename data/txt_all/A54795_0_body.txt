Honoured Sir,
WHen I resolv'd to addresse these Curiosities to your self, there was nothing which more emboldned me than your owne Ingenuity and worth, which I speak not after the com∣mon strain of Epistles Dedicatory, but in confirmation of a Truth well knowne to many. As for the Book it self, I may give it this character, that is containes Fancies as happy as the Muses could infuse into the choicest of our English Wits, and so or∣der'd, as not to distast the most serious, yet to be as blithe and merry as youth it self

could expect. And therefore if you are pleased to look favourably on it, and to bid it welcome, I doubt not but it will live securely under your name, not a little to the honour of him, who desires to profess himself,
SIR,
