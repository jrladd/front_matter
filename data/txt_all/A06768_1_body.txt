Right Honorable, and worthie Sir:
HAving after a long calculation found out tyme of my conception, almost doubting of the father, (as few ho∣nest women doe) I knew in end the childe belonged by right to you, which (yet honest woman like) I present to you, willing it should carie your name in the fore-front: Reject it not Sir, either by reason of the vnlawfuluesse of the tyme, being now eleven yeeres past since my first conception, where others take but eleven months at the most: the first li∣neaments being drawne, and carefully: yee,

fatherly, vnder the cover of your wings by heate till it tooke lyfe, hatched in the Vni∣versitie of St. Androws eleven yeares since: or because of the vnlikenesse of the birth, which doth not resemble you the father, (yet it is no wonder Sir) it being (babe like) toothlesse, tonguelesse, sightlesse, noselesse: yea, wholly senslesse, and so vnable to bite againe the back∣bytter, or make answere to the Critick babler, to flee the Viper in the way, r smell a farre of the sclanderous Censurer, whose throate is be∣come an open sepulcher: You Sir the father, having with the proportion of the members the sharpnesse of the senses, and sweete harmony of these outward decorments, that inward or∣nament of all, to wit, these eminent faculties of the soule, which kithes in your concepti∣on, graue and solideratiocination, and memo∣rie furnished from former observations, with a copious matter to all sorte of wholesome dis∣course, so that in-bred naturall wisedome, and painfull acquired learning, hath made you Sir (absit verbo invidia) justly to be thought by me (who scarcely seeth any thing clearely) , a just dimension of all things, required in a noble generous mynd, and a pro∣perly proportioned person. Receaue therefore this silly babe Sir, and let the perfections which are in you, supplie the defects that are in it

maintaine it by your authoritie from the vn∣christen: yea, vncharitable railing tongues and ryving hands of all Waspe-like searchers of poysoun amongst hony flowers, divel-like by invy hinderers never authors or furthe∣rers of any good enterprise, aiming at the well of the publick, but them I regarde not: laugh you Sir, and let them lightly it; receaue you it, let them reject it: to you Sir only being con∣secrate, I doe offer it as a sure badge of my constant desire out of ardent affection Sir to liue and die,

Doctor in Medicine.
