IT is well knowne (right Wor∣shipfull) how great a benefac∣tor and furtherer you haue been to many good workes and profitable to the Com∣mon-wealth: for by your im∣ployments, the inhabitants of sundrie parts of England and Wales, haue gained for many yeeres, many thousand pounds yeerely. How much then those poore are bound to praise God for you, and such as further the like good works, all wise men acquainted with your great charge and trauell can testifie, which I thought worthy to be published, and left in memorie for other ages yet to come, to your great commendation and incouragement of others, to follow your good example. And now (right Worshipfull) calling to minde my former time spent in Hus∣bandrie;
the most sweete and comfortable kind of life to all vertuous minds (that Adams poste∣ritie can enioy) if it were not for the wickednes of seruants, who discourage many industrious minds; and seeing an vnskilfull Pamphlet (cal∣led God speede the Plough) to be so long vnan∣swered, set foorth by some Nouice in Husban∣drie, as should appeare as well by his writing, as that he saith in the same, it is none of his profes∣sion; which hath and may doe much hurt by disswading men from so profitable an imploy∣ment as the setting of Corne; which when I considered, and remembring that I had spent the most part of thirtie yeeres in Husbandrie: I aduentured to publish this little Treatise, for the instruction of those that will be perswaded to practise this kind of excellent and profitable worke: which with my selfe I desire to be protected by your accustomed lo∣uing fauour towards me.
