RIGHT Worshipfull, right dearely beloued and reueren∣ced in the Lord: the regard of my bounden dutie first, and then that perswasion which I haue of your fauourable good-will and liking toward me, as also of the ioynt-willingnesse of ye both, to yeeld the credite of your names both in and for the profession and furtherance of Gods holie Religion and worship, by euerie good and Christian meanes in the sight of all men; and finding herewith∣all, that God of his rich mercie hath by meanes of your encouragement blessed my poore indeuors, that
 you might (as I trust) enioy some fruite of them: these considerations haue both incited and also em∣boldened and confirmed me (though the vnworthiest of all the Ministers of Gods word, whose wise, faith∣full, and learned labours are honorable and precious in the Churches and assemblies of Christ Iesus a∣mong vs) to make no doubt of dedicating this booke vnto you, and of publishing it vnder the credite and as it were the protection of your names. Desiring hereby to testifie my speciall thankfulnesse to ye both, and to helpe both you and yours, and as many others as I might in the right way of the kingdome of hea∣uen.
Howe worthie a testimonie of such my speciall thankfulnesse to you my so right worshipfull and be∣neficiall good Patrons, as I haue found ye to be vnto me; and consequently how worthie your credit and protection, and how profitable a helpe to further ei∣ther your selues or any other in the way of Gods king∣dome: and chiefly how this booke may be to the glory of God, which aboue all things ought to be most re∣spected in euery enterprise we take in hand, I leaue it to be determined by that gracious blessing which God himselfe of his infinite goodnesse and mercie, ac∣cording to his owne diuine counsell and wisedome, shall vouchsafe to giue vnto it.
Neuerthelesse seeing I do present to you an inter∣pretation of that part of the most excellent Lawe of the Lord our God, which containeth the fundamen∣tall rule and ground of all true wisedome, righteous∣nesse and holinesse before him; and therewith also a manifold collection of diuerse necessarie and profi∣table discourses incident to the same, from the rest
 of the holy Scripturs of God: such as are the equitie of the same most holy and righteous Law; the curses threatened against the trangressions thereof; the bles∣sings promised to all perfect obedience, not onely in generall, but also concerning euery particular com∣mandement of the Lawe; with a declaration likewise of the onely perfect obedience of our Sauiour Christ to all and euery commandement; and of our owne perfect disobedience, as well in corruption of nature, as in error and transgression of life, vntil we be ingraf∣ted into Christ, and sanctified by the holy Ghost: as also after we are so ingrafted, sanctified and renued vn∣to God, that our obedience at the best, is onely (as we may say) inchoate and but begunne, alwayes in this life remaining still vnperfect; so that it is of grace on∣ly through our Lord Iesus Christ, and not by worth and merite, that either it or our selues are accepted with God. Finally, seeing the excellent vses of the Law of God in all these respects, are here presented vnto you, and that in such sort, as all these points haue not bene so fully gathered together, as it were many la∣bours into one, as, by the grace of God, ye shall find them here gathered and sorted to your hands, all ten∣ding to instruct vs to true humiliation in our selues, that we might most happily reioyce and glorie in the Lord, and be partakers of his glorie in the end. I haue now good hope vpon the premises, that with your fa∣uorable construction of al things, and without iust of∣fence to anie other, I may in such modestie as may well beseeme an humble seruant of God, desire ye to esteeme this booke, as worthie for the Lords cause, not onely that countenance and safegard which your worthie names and credite may procure it, but also
 your verie diligent and carefull reading, perusing and pondering of it; as that treasure which God would haue in speciall manner weighed out, tendered, and appropriated to you.
I beseech ye therefore, right Worshipfull in the Lord, receiue ye this writing, not so much from me vnworthie poore wretch, as from the gracious good hand of God, who hath (as I trust) prepared and fur∣nished it from the treasurie of his riches, for the spiri∣tuall inriching of your soules to his heauenly king∣dome; as a fruite and blessing vpon you, for your speci∣all fauour to me, and other his seruants for his sake; how frayle and earthen soeuer the instrument is, which it hath pleased him to vse in this ministerie & seruice toward you. And for the same cause also do I humbly beseech ye, to make the best spirituall gaine of it, to the vttermost of that, wherunto it may possibly be improued by you.
To this end, as I began, so do I still, and by Gods grace shall so long as I liue, as humbly and instantly as I shall be able, beseech God our heauenly father, who onely hath the full treasurie of spirituall riches, fully sufficient for all that be his; that it may please him of his bounteous mercy, more and more to re∣plenish you and yours, with all heauenly graces, bles∣sings and comforts, vntill ye may together with the rest of his Saints, attaine to his euerlasting kingdome of glorie, euen for his most deare sonne our Lord Ie∣sus Christ his sake, of whose fulnesse onely we must all receiue, euen grace after grace, whatsoeuer we re∣ceiue.
To him therefore together with the Father and the holy Ghost, one onely true God, almightie and
 most wise, most righteous, and most mercifull ∣nall, infinite, and incomprehensible, be all bleng and thankes, all praise, honour and glorie both now and for euermore. Amen.
