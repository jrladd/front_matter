Right Honorable,
MEns actions have not their difference alwayes from the relation of their persons, for hee that presented his King with a dish of water, having nothing else, made the gift ac∣ceptable. I would use the application to my selfe,

having been one amongst your meanest followers in your Lordships practicall life of a Souldier: what I haue I bestow upon you, and doe hope though it be clothed in the light dressing of a Play, it will not be denied your Lordships accep∣tance since it contains the Character which Hi∣story hath left to Posterity of your own truly va∣liant Countriman: I most humbly beg pardon for my boldnesse, and that I may continue knowne to your Lordship, at the becomming distance of your Honours truly honourer, and humblest ser∣vant.
