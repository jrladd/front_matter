Right reverend Sir,
IN token of that humble respect which I owe to your selfe, I am bold to dedi∣cate these poore endea∣vours to you; hoping that as my studies long agoe abetted by your furtherance, so a tribute of their fruits shall bee now accepted at your worthy hands: for though I reckon my selfe bound to
render more than what's contained in these few papers, yet (as Plutarch speaketh) non Minus regium sum∣mae{que} humanitatis, parva lubenti facili{que} suscipere animo, quam magna largiri. And this I shall the rather hope, because herein I have chiefly laboured to cast out that filth and rubbish, wherewith the Philistims have stopped Abrahams wells: for they bee not the ancient, but the later times against which wee find a just complaint. And I would to God there were no cause: But (alasse) 'tis otherwise; insomuch that hee now is said to bee unsound, who will not side with factious opposites, nor yeeld to soothe the idle fancies, and needlesse feares of not a few. But as to a rot∣ten mouth all things relish with a rot∣ten
tast, Oris non elementi vitio; so things wholesome and good, appeare contrarie to corrupt judgements: and therefore it makes not much what such men censure; especially the Author being sheltered under the favourable wing of your protection, which cannot but adde more life to the warrantable proceedings of him who wisheth both your happinesse here and glorie hereaf∣ter, And shall ever remaine at your service to be commanded,

Novemb. 5. 1638.
