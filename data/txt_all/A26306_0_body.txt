I SHALL not excuse my Adventure, by extolling this Author's Worth, lest I should seem both Un∣just, and Impertinent: For should I go to enumerate his Praises, I might fail of render∣ing him all that is his Due; and to repeat his Fame, whom the World sufficiently knows, and this very Work not a little commends, would be foolishly Vain and Impertinent.
I hope, by my pouring his fragrant Essences, into a new

Vessel, they are better expos'd to the Sense of my Country∣men, and have not Lost much of their genuine Odour: How∣ever I am pretty well assur'd, That the Majesty of the Sense, will shine thro' the Meanness of my Expression; and that, so, whilst it gathers new Prai∣ses to its Author, 'twill obtain, at least, a Pardon for me.
'Tis not my Design, in pre∣senting you with a Treatise of this Kind, either to Inform your Mind, or Reform your Manners; since I doubt not, but you already understand the Rules for Knowing Your-self, and carefully Transcribe 'em into Practice: I offer it to you as a Part of that Homage, which all Men Owe, and, those

that Know you, justly Pay to your real Merit; and particu∣larly as a Token of Gratitude, to that Generous and Friendly Temper, which I always Ad∣mir'd, and frequently Experi∣enc'd in you.
As you have hitherto, even in Prosperity, freely embrac'd an useful Knowledge of your Self, as related both to God, and the World, surely the Heavens will see no Reason to Frown upon you, with whom their Smiles have been so prevailing, and that they never may, is the hearty Prayer of,
SIR,
