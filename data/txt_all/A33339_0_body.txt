Dearly beloved Friends,
I Have much desired, and longed for an opportunity to expresse, and make known my gratefull heart unto you, for those many favours, and expressions of love which I have received from you: For whereas by rea∣son of the iniquities of the times, and the cruel∣ty of the common enemy, I was banished from my home, and that station wherein the Lord had seated mee with much comfort, it pleased God to direct your hearts to make choyse of mee for your Minister; and since that time (being now eleven years) I have never found your affections cooled, but rather more, and more inflamed and increased towards mee: No small mercy in these giddy, and unstable

Doctrine. Ye therefore, Beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastnesse, 2 Pet. 3. 17. And the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by Jesus Christ, after that yee have suffered a while, make you perfect, strengthen, and settle you: which shall ever be the hearty prayer, and earnest endeavour of him who is
