MY Name being to appear in publick with this Translation in an age that flourishes with Pens, and Criticks; conscious of my disad∣vantage, I apprehended a Patron necessary; whose Name in the Front, like a Princes stamp upon Lead, might give authority and make it cur∣rant coyne. In my low condition I have often heard your Name glorious for worth and goodness, which made me hope though far transplanted, and obscure, you would grant me priviledge to claim a Title in your favour, and let the Reader opening this Book, see it is something be∣longs to you; it will I am confident keep him modest, and prevent his discharges at my defects. The Authour I dare say will, for gravity, novelty, and variety be accep∣table to your conversation: for though divers have set forth accounts of this nature, I have not met with any, in my opinion, of such credit as this.
Le Blanc was a traveller from his infancy to his grave, 64. years surveying the Master-piece of his maker: was a person of capacity, judgement, and integrity; one

seems as it were framed and designed to be sent forth, and to bring home a perfect discovery, and the truth of things fables and vanity have so much abused. You will finde him a person of morall and religious principles; one who kept select company; one, who in all parts he arrived at, took not his information at the shore or Suburbs, but either for occasion or curiosity, visited the intestines and supreme, whence he might the better look below, and round about him. I do ingeniously acknowledge I have injured him in the rudenesse of translation; which, next to my want of faculty, I beseech you attribute to the haste was pressed up∣on me, for I had no more dayes allowed to translate it, then would sufficiently have served to transcribe it: and it was the first piece I ever attempted. As it is, I peti∣tion you would afford our aged Traveller to take up a rest∣ing room at last in your study, and me the honour to be owned.
