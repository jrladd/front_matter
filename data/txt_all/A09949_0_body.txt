VVHen I vnderstoode your attention in the heating of this sermon, & diligēce in noting certaine principall points, & paines in conferring to give, penning, acquainting & sending your collections vnto many your wor∣shipfull friendes, & at the length vnto the right honorable Sir Edmund Anderson knight. Lord chiefe Iustice of the common Pleas, with in∣tent (as I gesse) to make my simple skill liked and allowed of them, I thought it my duty to accept your endevour very kindly, and to re∣quite you with procuring the same sermon to be imprinted, that all men might giue you de∣served commendations, and note your names amongst the number of vigilant hearers to your immoratall praise. Thus, not doubting of your good acceptance of the same, I end. Eg∣gington, the 28. of Ianuarie.
