SIR,
I Have examined your Treatise, (entituled Truths Conflict with Error,) and find it to be no other, but Error and Insolency stri∣ving against Truth and Innocency; and is found to be no more ablier to stand, than Dagon was to stand before the Ark of the Lord. I had writ a very conside∣rable Piece in Answer to the several Particulars in your Trea∣tise, and was at the Press with it long since, but taking these things into consideration, I did return back again with it, and have it lying by me at this time: the Reasons that caused me to lay that aside at present; was,
First, because I found very little asserted by you more, than what I had before answered and disproved. And,
Secondly, because the answering of petty or inconsiderable Objections in controverted Points, is but of little profit to the Reader. And,
Thirdly, because your self far remote, and also saying, that you would not appear in the Press, or otherwise with me in this Controversie any more, as I was informed by one that

said they had it from your own mouth. And,
Fourthly, because I find that it is most profitable to the Reader, (for whose sake I have written this) to lay down things in particular Points or Positions, and to confirm it by Scriptures, and Reasons drawn from the Scriptures, which is my method in the following Treatise; nevertheless I have answered every thing cited by you, that hath any weight in it, or at least that which appears of any weight unto me. And,
Fifthly, because I had other Points to speak to, being de∣sired thereunto by some Friends; and such like occasions calling me thereunto, the which caused me to be more brie∣fer in the several Particulars than I would have been, and to omit that large Discourse which I had written, and to contract my self into a briefer method, and yet large enough to clear up the Truth, and unvail the falsity of that long deceiving Doctrine of Infants Baptism; together with several other Doctrins, which do attend it; the which being read and weighed with an impartial heart, will appear to be the truth as it is in Jesus.
But Sir, what may I say to animate you to that thing? for as much as the way of Truth is every where spoken against, and your self, and your Brethren the greatest Persecutors thereof: Let not (I pray you) vain imaginations deceive you any longer, perswading your selves, that you are the peo∣ple whom God hath revealed his secrets unto; and that you are wise, and the knowledge of Gods Mysteries are in your hearts, because of your parts and education; Remember such may be deceived, and that the Priests of old were the greatest Enemies that our blessed Saviour had upon earth, how that they were the men that took counsel, and gave Judas Thirty Pieces of Silver to betray his Master; and also that it was the Priests, that gave the Soldiers large Money to make a lie, to say that Christ was not risen from the dead, but his Disciples came by night while they slept, and stole him away; which saying is reported amongst the Jews to this day: and yet

doubtless these men had human parts and learning, and also zeal, and yet for all this had not the knowledge of the Myste∣ries of God; for indeed it is the fulfilling of the Word of the Lord, which saith, that God hideth his Wisdome from the wise and prudent, and revealeth it to babes and sucklings.
Sirs, Let these and such like Scriptures as these be, (of which there be many) put you upon serious tryal, with pray∣ers and supplycations, that (if peradventures) God may o∣pen your eyes, that you may see the Truth, that so you may bring glory unto his Name, for it is not learning will do it, (although it be good in its place) without the inspiration of the Almighty; and let not Antiquity or Customs be your guide, for the aged do not alwayes understand judgment; but wait (at Wisdoms gate) on God by prayer, sighs and groans, lay aside pride and vain-glory, be not conformable to this world, in its pleasure, honour, fashions, and friendship, and the like; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds, and put on the Lord Jesus, and make no provision for the flesh, to ful∣fil it in the lusts thereof; and by so doing you shall come to know what is that good and acceptable, and perfect will of God, and your eyes shall see out of obscurity, and your ears shall hear a voyce behind you, saying, This is the way walk in it, when you turn to the right hand, or to the left, which shall guide your feet into the way of peace, and having served your God and your Generation in the way of Truth, the gates (that the King of Glory shall enter in at) shall be set wide o∣pen unto you, and all such as keep the Truth with uprightness of heart, shall enter in thereat, to their everlasting joy and feli∣city, never to have end; Which is the desire of him,
