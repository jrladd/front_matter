NOblest of minds, here do the Muses bring
Vnto your safer iudgements tast,
Pure iuice that flow'd from the Pierian springs,
Not filch'd, nor borrow'd, but exhaust
By the flame-hair'd Apollos hand:
And at his well-obseru'd command,
For you infusde in our retentiue braine,
Is now distild thence, through our quilles againe.


Value our verse, as you approue the worth;
And thinke of what they are create,
No Mercenarie hope did bring them forth,
They tread not in that seruile Gate;
But a true Zeale, borne in our spirites,
Responsible to your high Merites,
And an Inuention, freer then the Times,
These were the Parents to our seuerall Rimes,
Wherin Kind, Learned, Enuious, al may view,
That we haue writ worthy our selues and you.
