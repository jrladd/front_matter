TIs not in expectation of reward,
That I this booke vnto your hands doe tenâˆ£der;
But in my humble dutie, in regard
That I am bound my daily thanks to render.
And though my stile be harsh my learning slender,
My Verse defectiue, and my Accent rude;
Yet if your Patronage be my Defender,
Iam defended'gainst a multitude.
Thus (to auoyd Hell-hatch'd ingratitude,
My dutious Love) my Liues, and Life shall be,
To you deuoted euer to conclude,
May you and your most vertuous Ladie see
Long happie dayes, in Honour still encreasing;
And after death, true Glorie neuer ceasing.
