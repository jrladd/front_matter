THe message sent by those
two sorrowfull sisters in
the Gospell unto our Sa∣viour
(with the change
onely of one sickly word)
is the ground of the sad newes which
I bring to your Lordship: (if at least
that which is already knowne every
where, may be called newes) the friend
whom you loved is dead, which is the
cause that these few plaintive leaves
present themselves to your Lordship
in their funerall blackes; his true love
and affection to mee, hath perswaded
mee to proclaime my griefe in this


manner, for the losse of so worthy a
deare friend, to the world. And your
Lordships love to him hath prompted
me, a meere stranger to your Lordship
(with boldnesse enough without your
knowledg) to send them abroad under
the countenance of your Honourable
Name. If your Lordship question my
over-much daring herein, in fastening
my poore scriblets upon your Protecti∣on,
I have nothing to say for my self, in
excuse, but to flye behind the traverse
of his Name, where your Lordship
will be pleased either to see no faults
at all, or willingly to over-see them.
To this my simple memoriall of him, I
have (as a poore Post-script) added di∣verse
Emblemicall Essayes, which for
mine owne private entertainment of
idle houres, I have long since at se∣verall
times composed and layd by
mee (amongst many other of severall
subjects) unseene of any, save of him
whose absence I now lament: which,
seeing they received approbation from
him, I am the more confident to ad∣venture
to your Lordships hands, and
next, to the publike view; especially
conceiving within my self, that it will


not seeme altogether unsuitable or im∣proper
(after the naming of a particular
friend) to fall into some few short dis∣courses
of friends and friendship in ge∣nerall;
neither (after the lamentation
for a lost friend) to let fall some scatte∣ring
meditations of death, by whom
this so deere friend is reaved from the
sweet communion of so many his good
friends, who doe still love him, and
misse him. The conclusions which I
have fetcht out of these Italian pro∣verbiall
maximes, I must confesse are
but as the first faint drops which Chy∣mists
are wont to extract out of preti∣ous
Simples and Mineralls, through an
earthen Limbecke or a Bolts-head, of
brittle glasse (at the best) and so of
themselves neither greatly usefull or
pleasant, but as it is in the Proverbe,
Chi beve vino, beve sangue, al meno
quadagna il colore; he that drinks wine
drinkes blood, (at least) hee gaines the
colour cleere to himselfe: so this my
collection of so many elegant Pro∣verbs
in a language so delightfull, stan∣ding
in the front of my barren conceits
like a curious nosegay of fragrant
flowers, with their stemmes hid in


the hollow cane of a silly fennell-stalk,
may hope to win favour & acceptance,
for the pleasant sent which they bring
with them; the Diamond (by being set
on a dark dull foile) losing yet none of
the naturall worth, though much of
that pretious lustre, which Art could
have added unto it. And thus (having
given up this account of my selfe to
your Lordship, and fearing to adde
prolixitie to my boldnesse) I humbly
commend my selfe and my worthlesse
paines to your Lordships pardon, and
acceptance: in the one applealing to
the goodnesse of your owne Noble
Nature; the other beseeching you to
vouchsafe mee for his sake, for whose
I have herein cast my selfe upon the
necessitie of craving your Lordships
favour and pardon, and so rest.
