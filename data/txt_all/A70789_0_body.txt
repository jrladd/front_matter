My LORD,
GOod Men think the meanest Friend no more to be dispis'd, than the Politick the mean∣est Enemy; and the Generous

wou'd be as inquisitive to discover an unknown E∣steem for 'em, as the Cau∣tious an unknown Hatred: This I say to plead my self into the number of those you know for your Admirers; and that the World may know it, give me leave to Present you with a Translation of Petronius, and to absolve all my Offences against him, by introducing him into so a∣greeable Company. You're happy, my Lord, in the most Elegant part of his Chara∣cter, in the Gallantry and Wit of a Polite Gentleman, mixt with the Observation

and Conduct of a Man of Publick Employments; And since all share the benefit of you, 'tis the Duty of all to confess their sence of it, I had almost said, to return, as they cou'd, the Favour, and like a true Author, made that my Gratitude which may prove your Trouble: But what flatters me most out of the apprehensions of your Dislike, is the Gentleman∣like Pleasantry of the Work, where you meet with variety of Ridicule on the Subject of Nero's Court, an agreea∣ble Air of Humour in a Ramble through Schools,

Bagnio's, Temples, and Mar∣kets; Wit and Gallantry in Amours, with Moral Re∣flections on almost every Accident of Humane Life. In short, my Lord, I shall be very proud to Please a Sidney, an House Fertile, of extraordinary Genio's, whose every Member deserves his own Sir Philip to Celebrate him; whose Characters are Romances to the rest of Mankind, but real Life in his own Family.
I am, my LORD,
