May it please Your Grace,
HIS Majesty having been Graciously pleased
not only to take a view of, but to allow the
Publication of this Treatise of Muscular
Dissection; Now after Him it waits at
Your Graces Feet, imploring Your Pardon
for its Presumption: But Your Generous Spirit always
encouraging the Industrious Man, breathes Life into my
Ʋndertaking, by which Your Grace does declare to the
World Your valuable Goodness, as well as Your substan∣tial
Honour: You never exercising Your self in little
Designs, but in the Publick Service of Your King and

Countrey; These being the main Columnes of Your Great
Lustre, all which when Greatness shall be shrivel'd
into nothing, or at least into a cold Remembrance, will
raise Yours into everlasting Praise, and force future
Ages to speak well of Your Merit.
And were my Performances equal to my Wishes, I
might not doubt of a happy Reception; but since the
knowledge of my own weakness forbids the entertainment
of such thoughts, it waits on Your Grace with all Hu∣mility:
And whilst You have so much of that Heaven
about You, I shall fear little dammage from any Earthly
defects of my own.
And Noble Sir, As You are not only the true Heir
of the Fortunes, but of the incomparable Worth of so
Great a Father, and so Renowned a General, whose
Character being too big for my Pen, I dare leave it to
any Impartial Reader of this Age to Judge, whether
You do not most worthily participate with him, both in
Your Benign Temper and Honourable Conduct; The
delineating of both whose Heroick Spirits, may well
challenge the best of Orators to describe; Whose Goodness
joined with most noble Qualifications, may as deservedly
Entitle You both to that which was once given to the
great Emperor Titus: (THE DELIGHTS OF MAN∣KIND.)
But why should I strive to tell the World what they
already know, and what I am confident none will Dispute?
'Tis an Honour too great for me, that Your Grace hath
(by laying this Command upon me) given me an occasion
to publish the hearty desires I have to acknowledge all Your
Graces Favours, and to assume a liberty (few Men li∣ving
but will be proud to share in) of declaring my self,
