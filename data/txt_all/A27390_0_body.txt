SIR,
THE kindness you have for
an Apostate (for certainly Iu∣lian
was never better treated
than by you) makes me think Con∣stantius
hath a particular title to your
Protection, especially since we are
sure he revolted to Arrianism, and
not to Popery. Now whether these
kind sentiments proceed from a dif∣fusive
Charity, or rather a Natural
inclination whereby every thing fa∣vours
its like, I shall not presume
to determine, though the latter is

he more probable, since, like Iuli∣an,
you took holy Orders, and like
him too have, in effect at least, de∣nied
a Passive Crucified Saviour: this
will be plain to any one that consi∣derately
reades your book, and is
the onely thing hath induc'd me to
say what I have; for I declare I am
wholly unacquainted with any thing
that belongs to you, but that, your
Name and your Character in the
Church; so that no personal grudge
could be the occasion of these pa∣pers;
but a just sense of what I owe
to my Religion, and the Civil Go∣vernment
under which I live; from
which I ill deserve the Protection
and Liberty I enjoy, if I should not
use my utmost endeavour to sustain
it, when it is so evidently supplanted
(as now it is) by your pernicious
principles. And I cannot think but
your Religion is as indifferent to
you, as you would have the World
believe that of the Rippon-Addressers

is to them, since you so palpably ex∣plode
the glorious end of it Obedience.
I say this after a due and carefull
reading of your papers; and I was
more exact in the perusal, because
your prejudic'd friends gave it out,
that your book ought to be the per∣fect
measure of our conduct in rela∣tion
to his R. H. and the true State
of that Civil Obedience we owe to a
Tyrant; and added likewise, that
the Authorities you quoted were un∣questionable,
your inferences and
deductions necessary and pertinent,
and your arguments unanswerable:
but after the most diligent and im∣partial
search, not a syllable of all
this appear'd; and indeed when I
considered the Vouchers, I laught at
my self for giving credit to any thing
they so confidently asserted, since o
late all that have not a mind to b
impos'd upon, understand what they
say, with the same precaution they
believe women, or interpret dreams;

and indeed they have that quality of
great Lyars to have the contrary of
what they affirm generally true.
I hope, Sir, you will not take this
for a too severe reflexion upon your
friends; I am sure they value them∣selves
upon these pious artifices; and
it would have been unkind in them,
when you had taken so much pains
in publishing so many notorious fal∣sities
to advance the cause, if they had
not advanc'd the credit of your book
by the same means. After these un∣welcome
truths I can expect little
favour from you, and indeed entreat
none; all that I desire is, that you
would reade this as patiently as I did
yours, and then, if you please, cen∣sure
as freely: but of all faults, I am
confident you have no reason to ac∣cuse
me of that, which is almost na∣tural
to Dedications, Flattery, and
which would have been an unpar∣donable
crime in
