With Submission,
IN humble Respect to his Majesties
most gracious Speech, I do most humbly
offer these following Proposals, for the
encouraging of Seamen, in order to fur∣nish
their Majesties Royal Navy on all
Occasions: Wherein is briefly set forth

the great Hardships and Sufferings of
those imployed in Sea-Service, together
with proper Remedies to prevent the same;
whereby their Majesties, and the Pub∣lick,
may save those immense Sums of
Money yearly expended on such Occasi∣ons;
the Seamen be happy and easy in such
Service; the Merchants enjoy a free
Trade, without Interruption; the whole
Nation be happy under the present Influ∣ence
of a War, many Grievances attend∣ing
thereon be redress'd, Vice punish'd,
Vertue promoted, our Enemies terrified,
and our selves encouraged, by the Blessing
of the Almighty, to prosecute this so
great and glorious Ʋndertaking, and there∣by
regain our former Honour of being
Master of the British Seas, to the Glo∣ry
of their Majesties, the Peace and Hap∣piness
of the whole Nation: Most humbly
begging your Honours to pardon this my

Ʋndertaking, to pass by my Errors with
Patience, and to correct all that is amiss
with Prudence, and to consider my former
Proposals, humbly offered for the saving
100000l. per Annum in building and
repairing the Royal Navy; which by his
Majesty's Order of the 22d of March
last, was referred to the Right Honoura∣ble
the Lords Commissioners of the Admi∣ralty,
and at the writing hereof is yet ly∣ing
under their Lordships Consideration. All
which (out of a hearty and zealous Incli∣nation
of serving their Majesties and the
Publick) I do most humbly recommend
to your Honours Consideration (as the on∣ly
Physicians under God, from whom a
Redress of all our Grievances are desired
and expected) in Hopes of your favoura∣ble
Acceptance and Encouragement there∣of,
for the Service of their Majesties, the
Benefit of the Subject, and the Good and

Welfare of the whole Nation, most hum∣bly
praying that a Committee may be ap∣pointed
to examine and consider the same;
and that I may be admitted to give Reasons,
and answer to all Objections. I humbly
submit my self,
