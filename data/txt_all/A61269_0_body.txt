SIR,
THis Discourse was meant honestly, (at least) and so far from the least thought of giving just Offence, that an awful regard of God, and a due respect to man, are the two main wheels it moves upon, for it was designed chiefly to assert, and main∣tain that Reverence which Men of all Nati∣ons and Languages have ever with one con∣sent agreed to be due to the House of God, the Place where his Honour dwelleth; and
next to that, to congratulate and applaud the the voluntary, seasonable, and exemplary Zeal of those two Honourable Societies, who being grieved to see their Sion lying (somewhat) in the dust, spared for no cost or charges to renew the Youth, and add more Grace and Beauty to that incomparable Monument of ancient Piety.
Before I made one step towards drawing the Platform thereof, I considered with my self that the Subject was a little nice, and the Age we live in not a little captious; and therefore resolved to take better Judgments than my own along with me, lest I should be new and singular in my Notion, or be thought to lean wholly to my own understanding, against Solomon's express and safe Caution. For this end and reason I consulted and perused some of the best Authors thereupon, and of our own Church, and chose to speak their sence (and that in their own very words sometimes) that I might neither stand nor fall alone, nor want sufficient Bail in case of an Arrest upon an Acti∣on of Scandal.

This abundans Cautela notwithstanding, some of my Hearers (as it should seem) were offended at me, and others more by hear-say, as if I had gone beyond my line, stretched a point of the Divine Law, and transgressed the bounds of Modesty, Truth, and Soberness.
I must confess Sir I do hold Sacrilege to be not only a Sin, but one of the first Magni∣tude, and if any man be contentious, whose interest bids him think otherwise, we have no such Custom, nor the Churches of God.
I acknowledge further (if that be my crime) that I do restect upon those late goodly Reformers of ours, who presumed to buy and sell our Churches with their appurtenances, as guil∣ty of that sin; but that, not so much to rub up an old sore, as to prevent a new wound, and dishearten allwise men from invading the Churches patrimony for the future.
Bolder Stroaks then these, or more un∣wary Passages I do not find in the whole Peice; and therefore least a groundless noise
should grow into credit to mine and my Fun∣ctions prejudice, as unpolished as it is, I am forced to make it Publick, without any man∣ner of alteration, diminution, or addition of one syllable therein, excepting only the marginal Quotations.
And now Sir, since You were pleased to give your self the trouble of reading over my Notes, and to declare you found nothing in them but what might admit of a very fair construction, I take the humble boldness to send them abroad un∣der your Patronage; not doubting but that, as it is the business of your high Place, and Royal Trust, sometimes to implead and prosecute the Guilty, (as you are Procurator Caesaris, in the old Roman style) so you are ever at leisure to acquit and protect the Innocent.
In the number of which I presume to rec∣kon,
Sir,
