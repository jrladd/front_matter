Most Reverend, and my ever Honoured Lord,
I See it incident to Personages of high Place and Deser∣ving, to win by their Living Fa∣vours many obse∣quious Followers; who, after their decease, prove but cold Remem∣brancers

of their Bounty, or other Virtues. Which slackness in others forced that boldness in me, ra∣ther to chuse the hazzard of disreputation to my Pen, which was never cunning, than to my Heart, which shall never be un∣grateful. And therefore I have presumed to set down the Godly and Religious Courses of the most Reverend Archbishop WHIT∣GIFT, your Grace's late Pre∣decessor, to shew mine own ob∣ligation to his Memory, and to make known his worthy Parts to future Ages. And because your Grace's beginnings shew how careful an Embracer you are of his chiefest Virtues, as well in your industrious Studies, as in your private and publick Go∣vernment; I held it my Duty to present both this, and my best Services to your Grace.

That here you may see, if no∣thing else, those Virtues in ano∣ther, that are so aimed at by your Self. Which make many true affected Hearts pray, that by your godly, vigilant and pru∣dent Guidance, his Church may long and happily flourish among us, To
