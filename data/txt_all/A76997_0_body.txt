Honoured Sir,
THe successful experi∣ence and large pra∣ctice which you have had in the Operations of Nature, (I mean in the pra∣ctical part of Physick) hath in∣vited me to present this piece of

that most renowned Physitian Paracelsus to your Patronage; which I have endeavoured to bring into a garbe suitable, as neer as I can, to our English fa∣shion; though perhaps it's not so finely accoutred, and dressed A la mode, as to suit with every critical or captious Fancy: But as this Author in his time was too learned and sincere in the method of his practice, to suit with general Sophistry of the wil∣fully ignorant Conclave of Phy∣sitians; so I doubt not, but you have met with some Invectives amongst our common Collegians, who ground the greatest reason

of their Recipes from a Galen's or a Pliny's Probatum: But as this famous Author made Rea∣son and Experience his greatest Guide, so I am assured you do; and therefore valued not the Ca∣lumnies, Oppositions, and Ob∣trectations of his Adversaries. Sir, this little Treatise presents you with the rare secrets of Al∣chymy, and the miraculous Cures of Diseases by Sigils and La∣mens, made in their proper sea∣sons, and attributed to the nature of Celestial Bodies; which to many Ignorants seems impossi∣ble, and is by them vilified be∣cause not understood: I there∣fore

make bold to crave your pro∣tection, which may sufficiently arm it against all Opposites. And be pleased to pardon my boldness herein, and admit of this my la∣bour into your Patronage; that your favourable acceptance here∣of may be a future encourage∣ment to
August 20. 1655.
