SIR,
I Assure my self you cannot be surprized to read your Worthy Name prefixed to the few following impolite Pages. I dare not tell the World, especially without your leave, how much this mean offering is due to you. Tho' it were ten times more valuable than it is, I know no person can make a juster claim thereto. I never thought any thing of mine worthy of publick Cognisance, and have therefore constantly declined the Press, into which at this time I am tantum non pressed. Of two Evils I have chosen the less, judging it better that this should go abroad from my own Pen, rather than from an∣others. Such as it is, I humbly offer it to your hand, which gave me no small occasion to preach it. I con∣fess I had another Argument which somewhat in∣clined me to this Publication. I have so much sa∣tisfaction
in what my Congregation hath done, tho at their great Charge, in Building such a conveni∣ent and decent Synagogue for the Solemn Worship of God, that (if I may speak it without vanity) I was willing to leave behind me, now that I am going out of the World, being in my Seventy Seventh Year, something that might be a Memorial of this Building to Posterity in the next Generations: For it may be said in this sense, Littera scripta manet. And I pray God to remember them for good, and all that assisted them in this Work, and not wipe out all the good Deeds which they have done for this House of God, and for the Offices thereof. Sir, I am far from pretending to add any Honour to, am only de∣sirous to make this small Testimony of the greater Honour I have for Sir T. C. whose savourable Ac∣ceptation and Patronage thereof, shall always be e∣steemed, by me, a very great Honour to, and strong Obligation upon,
SIR,

Barking, June 3. 1700.
