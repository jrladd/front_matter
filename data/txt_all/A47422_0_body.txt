May it please your Lordship,
I Have been for some time in debate with my self, whether I should pre∣sume to prefix your Lordship's Great Name before this Treatise. That which at last weighed down the Scales with me, was that of Varius Geminus in Seneca.
Caesar qui apud te audent dicere, magnitudinem tuam ignorant, qui non audent Humanitatem.
The principle Motive which I had for Publishing the same under your Lord∣ship's Name and Protection, (besides the Testification of my bounden Duty, as being a Presbyter of your Diocess) owes its Original to your Lordship's great Zeal for the Truth; and your great Auersion from those monstrous and Atheistical Opinions, which are now so common among us.
Neither can I in the least doubt of your Lordship's gracious Acceptance; provided that the Matter contained in the Book, makes good (as I hope it doth) its Title.
What other Motives I might truly have, with Respect to your Lordship's good Government, and the great Hap∣piness that we of your Clergy enjoy un∣der the same (as things generally known) I willingly pretermit, least I may seem too prolix and troublesome. That ex∣cellent Saying of Lipsius, having made a deep Impression on my Mind: Bre∣ves Sermones apud Daeum saepe, apud magnos viros semper grati & accepti sunt.
