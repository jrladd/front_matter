IOhn of all Iohns, I am bould heere to bring you into a guest-house or Hospitall, and to leaue you there; not as a Patient, but as a Pa∣tron or Treasurer: I could wish, that vpon this sudden calling to such an office, you would not (like one swolne with the fatnesse of your place) grow bigger or prouder, nor (indeede) more couetous then you are: but like a man within compasse, whose bare (or rather thread∣bare)

content is his kingdome, tread all Ambi∣tion vnder your Ancient shooe soales, now the sixteenth time corrected, Et ab omnibus mendis purgatas. Stay now; for your charge: you shall sweare to the vttermost of your endeuours, without fraude or imposture to releeue and cherish all such creatures as are by the hand of Fortune committed to your custodie, as also to elect and choose officers of good reputation and sincere practise to supply inferiour places vnder you as: a Porter, who shall refuse none that are willing to enter; a surgeon, that will protract the cure long ynough vpon them, and that if any desperate Censurer shal stab either at you or me, for vndertaking, or assigning this office or place, you presently take him into the darke ward, and there let him be lookt to, and kept close as a concealment, till some bodie beg him; all this you shall faithfully protest to ac∣complish: So helpe you a fat Capon, and the Contents of this Booke.
