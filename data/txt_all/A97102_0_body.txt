MEN, for the most part, of all opinions, are bread up with so much feare and scrupulosity, that they no sooner arive to some measure of knowledge in their perticular way, but they become meere Pedants; fierce and violent censurers of all things; they are not accustomed to themselves, instantly en∣gaging, and condemning, before they have deliberately examined, or maturely debated the thing they judge: which is an evill and unhappy temper of mind, because unsciable: and proceedeth from want of that generall knowledge, which freedome of consideration would beget.
It is therfore worth our labour, to study how to reduce our minds into the most friendly disposition, to be ready, and alwayes provided of harmelesse and friendly thoughts of men and things, untill evident cause appeare to the contra∣ry; not to looke with an evill or a growling eye, as if we desired to find matter to except against it is a shrewd signe of desease, when the stomock hankers after unhol some things.

It cannot proceed from true Religion rightly understood, to beget malancholly, moody, angry, frampoll Imaginations, for that rightly understood begets cheerfulnesse of spirit: which is ever accompanied with love, and maketh the best construction: for love thinketh no evill: but hopeth all things: and is very kind to all men.
The ensuing discourse, would not need this preparative, but that there is an aptnesse in the most to misconster; and a readinesse to giveeare, gladly to any that shall shew either wit, passion, or mallice, in finding fault: it is pittie good peo∣ple should so easily be deluded: or evill men so easily worke their ends upon them: or good intents be so easily frustrated: the unusualnesse of the Title and method of this discourse will minister occasion to the Weake and to the Perverse: but if the authority, antiquity and use of Parables, be consi∣dered with some ingenuity, the Author will not loose the end of his discourse, nor of this preface, which is, to worke a∣mendment in some, where there is cause enough.
