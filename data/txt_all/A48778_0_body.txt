MY LORDS,
IT was deliver'd to me as a Message from your Lord∣ships, that it was your desire I should print the Sermon, which I had the honour to speak in the hea∣ring of your Lordships last Assi∣zes at Northampton. All I gather'd from it then was, that I was oblig'd to have a grateful Sence of the In∣couragement I thought your Lord∣ships intended to give me, by ex∣pressing so favourable an opinion of my weak, though well-meant Performance. But afterwards,
when I receiv'd a second Message of the same import, I concluded it was a Command your Lordships expected should be observ'd. In all dutiful submission therefore I send it abroad, but humbly beg that it may pass under the Protection of your Lordships Names. For I so well know my own Inability to write any thing that will bear a de∣liberate reading in this critical Age, that I should never have had the confidence to expose this to it, if I could any other way have made it appear, that I am,
My Lords,
