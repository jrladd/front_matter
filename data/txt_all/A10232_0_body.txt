Right VVorshipfull.
THat of Artaxexres King of Persia, was never too highly

set and prised, which said; that it was of no lesse kingly bounty and humanity, to accept of little things, then to give great: I have re∣ceived great things from you, and now what have I to offer unto you, but even these poore Meditations? which if it shall please you to accept, you shall more enrich and fill my de∣sire by this receaving, then by giving. For to an honest minde it is sweeter to be regarded, then rewarded, and

what greater reward can be given unto him that striveth to bee thankfull, then to finde himselfe accepted in that, in which he seeketh most to please? Accept them I pray you fa∣vourably, and censure them charitably: for my part I intend especially (though I be of all men most unworthy) to fur∣ther Christs Kingdome, which if it may, I have my desire: howsoever I shall leave it to the blessing of God, and your worthy Patronage.

Now the God of all consolation, according to the riches of his mer∣cy, blesse you and yours with all externall, inter∣nall, and eternall bles∣sings of his spirit, that all your actions may bee prosperous, your troubles few, your com∣forts many, your life long, your death bles∣sed, your elections sure, and yur salvations cer∣taine. Amen.
