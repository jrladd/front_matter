IN order to adorn my departure from you (worthy and ho∣nored Gentlemen) with a Beno decessit such grateful respects and civili∣ty as becomes me, to your emi∣nent and worthy Societies, I have formerly prepared, and now de∣dicated this following Treatise, as my fare-well Present to you, or a second monument of mine, yea and of your Honor, after

that, which was by me the last year of Englands captivity, con∣secrated to the memorie of my reverend and renowned Predecessor Bishop Brownrig, under the pa∣trocinie of your Name; that was as the Urn or Conservatory of his and your reciprocal kindness, and mutual merits, with whose mor∣tall remains your piety hath ador∣ned your Temple: This second piece is the substance of those two Sermons which I first prea∣ched among you, after I was invited  in those dark and dangerous times to bestow my pains with you in the Term time.
The main subject of this is, the The true Cause of God, and the right pleading of it. Which Theam I then chose to preach on, because I observed in the whole course of our English tra∣ged, that evey party still pre∣tended,

to act their factious con∣fusions upon their several stages, in these three Kingdoms, under the specious dress, colour, title and pretence of Gods Cause, and the high zeal they had to plead it.
This, this was always inscri∣bed on the most bloody banners; with this their tongues and pens were whetted who sought to build their Counter-Babels on the foundations and ruines of Zion: With this Mark of the Lamb were those ravening wolves marked, who drank the blood, and eat the flesh of their Fathers and Mothers, of Kings and Clergie of Church and Country, with this Motto, The Cause of God and Christ, their false tongues, their crazie heads, their cruel hands and impudent faces were to be set off to popular reputation; when no∣thing indeed was further from

their hearts or works.
O the Cause of God, the Cause of God, the Cause of Iesus Christ cries every tatling and teeming faction, when prostitute to, and impregnated by the Incubus of some novel lust and new fancy, as if it were now in travel, and rea∣die to be delivered of some ho∣ly birth, or sacred prodigie. This language or fallacy non causa pro¦causa, of urging the Cause where no Cause of God was, the rigid Presbyterian learned in Scotland; this the puny Independant brought from Arnheim or New England: This of old the Anabaptists cried up at Munster, when to encrease their Faction they multiplied wives: This the silly Quaker now peeps and mutters in every cor∣ner: This the more bloody Papists boasted of in Ireland▪ and other Bigots of that perswasion do

every where magnifie the Ro∣mish cause, as the only Christian Catholick Cause.
Mean while all these parties joyntly and severally labour to o∣verthrow the true Cause, and ex∣cellent constitution of this Church and Monarchie of Eng∣land: That is the truth, peace, honor and order both of these Brittish Kingdoms and of our Re∣formed Religion, as it is conform to the Word of God, to our anci∣ent good Laws, and to the customs of the true Catholick Church: In which, the learned, loyall and Religious Nobility, Gentry, Clergie and Commons of this nation, with their Kings, have ever judged that the true Cause of God, as to justice and Religion, holiness and peace, the divine glory and welfare of mankind, was and is most eminently contained.
I confess I was then wearie and ashamed of the counter∣pleas & counterscufles of those bold and divided harlots, who did each pretend with great zeal the Cause of God against the o∣ther, in order to oppose Gods righteous cause, which certain∣ly ever was and will be but one and the same for ever, as to the main of truth and peace, of faith and good works, of justice and ho∣liness; I evidently saw by many years sad experience, that these rude rivals already had, and e∣ver would first divide, then de∣stroy the true cause of God, and the publick interest of this Church and Kingdom only to advance their private and partial causes, which were evidently leavened with most illegal ex∣travagancies, with sacrilegious covetousness, with immoderate

ambitions, with inhumane reven∣ges, with implacable cruelties, and with impudent exorbitancies, and with most eigned neces∣sities.
Hence it was that I adven∣tured in so great and illustrious an Auditory (even before the day of our redemption dawned, or that day-star of the North appear∣ed, which afterward ushered in our Sun of Righteousness) I say I then adventured truly and fully to set forth my sense of Gods Cause, with such a resolution as our learned Bradwardin Archbp. of Canterbury sometime took up, when he set forth his large and elaborate Volume De Causa Dei, of which he thus says in his Preface, De Causa Dei Scri∣pturus sciens manum in ignem ter∣ribilem mitto, &c. That he well knew into what flaming fires

(with Scoevola) he put his hand; how many enemies he should contract and exasperate, by his honest stating and asserting the Cause of Gods grace and glory, a∣gainst the Pelagian pride and pre∣sumption, who sought to ad∣vance the impotent power of nature, the cloudie twilight beams of Reason, and the maim∣ed liberty of mans will (which is clogged, corrupted, and ham∣pered with many sensual lusts) above the necessity and against the only sufficiency of Gods grace in order to his glory, and a sinners salvation▪ yet that good Prelate did both proceed and speed: he did his work and had his reward, both in a good con∣science and in great successes, as to his repressing that petulan∣cy of poor worms, exalting them∣selves against the great God,

without whom they can do no∣thing but sin against him, and damn their own souls.
In like manner have I lived to see in a few months, after that bold essay of mine among you, the wonderful revolutions of Gods providence, pleading at once his own, the Kings, this Churches, and this Kingdoms cause; the Cause of our Laws, Liberties, Lives and Religion; the cause of all honest men, for their souls and bodies, for themselves and their posterities, in their temporal and eternal great concernments: All these great and good Causes are at once pleaded by our wise, just and mercifull God, against those strong delusions, those false pretensions, those rebellious usur∣pations, and those novel intrusi∣ons, which under the lie and hy∣pocrisie of setting up Gods Cause,

and the Cause of Jesus Christ, made prophane men abhor the very name, & godly men to pitty the reality of Gods holy cause, which they saw so miserably mistaken by some, and by others so shamefully deformed, so sordidly defiled, so impudently blasphemed through the wicked policies, and horrid practises of some monsters of men, most unsanctified Saints, who were so diametrally contra∣ry to the Word of God, to the laws of this Land, and to the exam∣ple of Iesus Christ, and all rue Saints▪ and so no more capable to set up or promote Gods righ∣teous cause (except that of his punitive Iustice for our sins, to which the Devils themselves may serve as Executioners) then the sparks of hell can add to the light of heaven, or the falling Stars and Meteors contribute to

the lustre of the Sun, or the crook∣ed winding of the Dragons ail could give protection to the Woman and her childe, against whom his mouth vomited those black floods▪ and Stygian eructati∣ons, which by Heretical or ch∣matical, or Heathenish, or A∣theistical persecutions seek to o∣verwhelm them.
The great and blessed God hath taken the matter into his own hand; what you then faithfully heard, and devoutly prayed, for with me, as to Gods pleading of his own Cause, you have lived to see fulfilled, as it was then by me discoursed and foretold, while the poor people of England were halting between man opinions, all eagerly pretending to be for Gods Cause: one for Aristo∣cracy, the other for Democracy, one for Presbyter, the other for

Independency; one for their Antiepis∣copal Covenant, another for their Anti-regal Engagement; one for aburation of Kings, the other for extirpation of Bishops, a third for setting up the Kingdom of Ie∣sus Christ, in which they might rule instead of both King and Bishops (and all this (forsooth) in order to advance the Cause of God, though in ways quite contrary to the eternal rules of charity, justice and religi∣on, the Laws of God and this Nation) amidst this confusion, the Lord from heaven hath on the sudden convicted, confuted and confounded all those speci∣ous, but spurious pretenders to Gods Cause, which is not to be begun or carried on (as I after declare) by any means but such as are pure & peaceable, just and oly, either by an orderly doing

good in our places, or by a pati∣ent and humble suffering of evil inflicted on us, though it be for well doing.
It is most evident, that as in natural, so in civil and Ecclesiasti∣cal motions, all things magneti∣cally move, as they are moved by their chief cause▪ or grand con∣cern, which by a circular kind of influence studies to unite the fi∣nall to the efficient cause, that the power of the one may enjoy the good of the other.
This Cause is the first and last mover of every knowing agent▪ it is the weight and spring of all rational activity; it is a pulse ever importuning the spirit, and beating upon the heart, the one thing necessary, to which men seek to make all other things subser∣vient, or at least subordinate, the centre from which and to which all lines are drawn.
The better to compass their respective designs, every Agita∣tor for Faction did cunningly en∣title God to their Cause (as some that are cautious of the crackt titles of their estates resign the Fee to the Crown, and take from them a Lease of a thousand years) o did the counterfeit and contra∣riant Causes (larely so scusing in England, for place and power) set themselves up under the name of Gods Cause, while they were indeed the causeless corrupters of our Laws, the Nations hea∣vie curse, the Churches moth and corrosive, and confounders of all; yet each of their pretended cau∣ses were impudently pleaded by ome men▪ in Churches and Courts of Iustice as Gods Cause, y & by ome suppositiious Par∣aments they were voted for, till they had run themselves and all

of us (like S. Pauls ship in the storm) upon such rocks of A∣narchy and confusion, as were past humane hopes of recovery, if God himself had not arose by a pro∣vidence (scarce ever paralleld in any age or instance of the world) to plead by a still voyce, after all our foregoing earthquakes, fires & tempests, the Cause of his own great Name, and the honor of our blessed Saviour, with the sanctity of our Reformed Religion, and the Loyalty of our English Nation, the rights also of the Crown, with the double honor of our Church, and in sum the just restablish∣ment of all our long shaken and overthrown foundations; the cause of all which was pleaded more effectually in a few calm Months, when the voyce of Law and Reason, of Loyalty and true Religion, came to be heard in our streets, then they had been, or ever could have been in many

years, by plunderings and seque∣strings, by killing and slaying, by illegal covenanting, and perjuri∣ous engaging, by devouring and destroying both Church and King∣dom.
I am piously ambitious (though my station be now re∣moved from you, & made (with∣out my seeking) much uneasier, though somewhat higher, then it was before) to deposite thi work with you, O worthy and honourable Gentlemen, among whom it had its first productions of whose love and favor, as you know, I never made any merce¦nary gain, or pecuniary advantag (as that wretched Libeller,  Creticus Borborites enviously sug¦gests, my charge of attending your service being beyond any benefit I ever received,) so I mus own this, as the greatest rewar

and only satisfaction, which I ever had, or expected for my pains among you, that I had there∣by an happy opportunity, in so no∣ble an Assembly, and in so despe∣rate paroxysms of our distempered times, to set forth with my won∣ted freedom, the great concern of all good men, which is the true Cause of God, which must be pleaded against our own and others lusts; and to discover those potent epidemical cheats which under that name had so long abused these British Nations and Churches.
I well remember, that some of my more touchy and guilty hearers (men of name at that time) were at once scared and scandalized to hear me preach so freely and smartly of that sub∣ject; they feared their practice and craft would soon fail, if

once the true Cause of God were rightly stated and pleaded: yea some men of the long robe, and of large consciences protested af∣ter the hearing of the first Ser∣mon they durst not hear me preach again on that subject, least their silence should make them guil∣ty of High-treason, by their no complaining of me to the Traytor then tyrannizing over us: In¦deed they were justly jealou that the true Cause of God, like Moses Serpent, would eat up al those of the Magicians: That the Cause of Christ, of the tru heavenly Jerusalem, would either batter down or undermine those bloody Babels of their Common wealths, which were indeed the common woe, though it made for some mens private wealth by the prices of blood and wages of ini∣quity which they greedily recei∣ved.
I thank God, I never feared the frowns nor affected the smiles of such servile Sycophants, who durst plead any Cause but what was truly Gods, the Kings and the Churches. I had then sufficient en∣couragement from the love and ap∣probation of the most and best of their Society (without which, yet I ought and should have done my duty, upon the account of consci∣ence and inward comfort) Hence is this my confidence of inviting you again to review the Cause of God, which hath been now mightily pleaded beyond what we could ask or think, God himself conquer∣ing the monsters of our sins and mi∣series, by the miracles of his mercies▪
My aim is to retain and engage as Counsellors, Advocates, and Ser∣vients to this righteous cause (yet without any other Fee then that of a good conscience in this world)

not only men of my own profes∣sion, as Divines and Ministers, but you s o that are either the Sages and Iudges, or the Students and Practisers in the Laws; because I look upon you as Masters of great Reason, and no less careful (I hope) of true Religion, best acquainted with the constitutions of this Church and Kingdom; persons ge∣nerally adorned with ingenuous education and good literature, yea and, which is more in vulgar eies and esteem, with good estates; Gentlemen related by birth, or alli∣ance; or clients or acquaintance to the best Families and greatest af∣fairs of the Nation; you either fill the one or attend the other house of Parliament (while no Bishop or other Clergie-man never so wor∣thy is admitted to come there, unless as a Supplicant or Delin∣quent) your counsels and examples

are not onely influentiall in your country retirements, but also effica∣cious in all the Cities and Courts of England.
It is your custom, and no less your wisdom and honor to keep to, and plead for the , the Magna Charta, fundamental Laws and ancient and excellent constituti∣ons of this Church and Kingdom (not therefore good because anci∣ent, but therefore ancient because they were judged and experimen∣tally found by our wise and pious Progenitors to be very good, yea best for this Church and State:) It becomes the freedom of your spirits and estates, as Lawyers and Gentlemen (however the poor Clergie are oft compelled to po∣pular dependancie, yea and some of them (like leeches) thrive best when they hang most upon the skins of people) I say it becomes

you to be the furthest of any men living from flattering or abetting any factius novelties, or Fanatick Novellers in Church or State, which you cannot do without greater sin and shame then other men, because you have more knowledge of good and evil, of Law and Iustice, of Reason and Re∣ligion; the guilt and burthen of other mens sins, which are lead and deluded by your counsel or ex∣ample must needs lie heavie up∣on your souls (as well as ours of the Clergie) when being their guides, lights and oracles, you or we prove their deceivers and se∣aucers.
Certainly if the poyson of some Lawyers teeth had not venomed the wounds which some Preachers tongues first gave to the life and welfare of this Church and King∣dom, we had not run to such hor∣rid

ulcers, such in veterate and incu∣rable gangreens of disloyalty and ir∣religion of faction and confusion, nor endured so various, ridiculous, and superfluous Tragedies; which then began when Pulpits rang Aarons bels backward, as to the Cause of God; and Courts of judi∣cature meanly conformed to the vilest lusts of men, such as have gi∣ven horror and astonishment to the modest part of mankind; and which threatned (except the Lord had been merciful to us) to have tor∣mented Kings and Parliaments and people of all degrees in the hell fire or Tophet of everlasting fewds, factions and confusions, under the specious name, but most putid fallacy of Gods Cause, the good cause, and at last the good old cause: though nothing was more vile and novel, less ancient or more ar∣rantly wicked, for perjury, perfidy,

Sacriledge and Regicide, void of all fear of God, or reverence of man▪ contrary to the Word of God and Laws of that Nation: A Cause, the zealous Martyrs for which are only fit to be put in the Devil Diptych or Calendar, or in God Black book, not in the Book of lif
Against all which presumptuo imposures in Church and State You (O worthy professors of the La and of our reformed Religion, a well as we Preachers of the Gospel have now all honorable and saf encouragement to oppose ou selves under the protection of God and the King, that both you a Iudges and Iustices by the civil sword, and we as Bishops and Presbyters, by the spiritual sword▪ may be as valiant for the honour and order of the established Religi∣on and Laws of England, for the ancient and excellent Government

Regal and Episcopall of this Church and Kingdom, as others have been impudently pragmatick to broach those novel errors, most illegal in∣juries and high indignities which they brought upon us, more by our own cowardize perhaps then their courage. Let us dare as much to be Loyal and religious, honest and orderly, as others have dared to be false and base, insolent and irregular, injurious and sacrilegious.
They wanted not many black mouths, vile tongues, and libellous pens to plead for the Baalims which they set up (meer Idols and Teraphims in Church and State) which are now (blessed be God cast out to the moles and bats. O let not us, for I would have no difference between your learned Tribe and ours, let none of us who are most versed in God

or mans Laws, be wanting to the true Cause of our God and Savi∣our, of our rightful King, of our reformed Religion, and of our fa∣mous Church, in its Doctrine, de∣votion, discipline and Government, In the cause of which, all your and your posterities happiness are included. Since then by the goodness of God the monstrous and many-shapen Dagons of our late Philistins and oppressors, are now faln to the ground and bro∣ken off head, hands, and feet, a meer fanatick stump; let us turn Israelites unanimously set our selves, as we have done, to the welcome reception of his Maje∣sty, so to bring home with truth and peace, honor and order, joy and jubilation the Ark of God, the Church of England, restoring it to its place, and adorning it with all the beauties of holiness, worthy of

the wisdom and piety, munificence▪ courage and honor of our Ancestors who were famous both for their loyaltie and Religion; the fruits of whose care and constancie we enjoyed heretofore, as men and Christians, in a wel-reformed, uni∣ted and setled National Church, till some men lost their wits and hearts, their credits and consciences, their sense of duty to their God and their King, yea and their first love of our reformed Church and Reli∣gion, for which our famous Fore∣fathers had so notably pleaded, not only in the Pulpits & at the Bars, but in prison also, and at stakes, when they were able to say with truth and comfort, as the royall Martyr of admired memory, did now dying That they thanked God they had a good Cause and a gracious God.
Certainly tis better thus to suf∣fer for God cause (inpietie, justice

patience and charitie) then to prosper in the Devils with sacri∣legious usurpation and injury; this as a fire of thorns may blaze for a time, but it will soon be extin∣guished, the other carries the lawrells and crowns of eternal victo∣ry; for though we die for it, yet we shall live by it; the greatest tro∣phies of Gods cause are in another world; there our Lord Iesus Christ with the Prophets, Apostles, Mar∣tyrs, Confessors, and all the true Pro∣fessors set up their victorious ban∣ners, and rest in eternal Triumphs▪ O let us all cast anchor in Gods Cause, and we shall have no cause to fear the tossings of this world, which was and ever wil be a rest∣less Sea. Let us keep Faith and a good conscience from shipwrack by preservation of our Laws and reformed Religion, so shall we and our posteritie, Kings and Subjects be most safe on earth, however

we shall be sure to gain our main cause and process at last in heaven, tho in other things we be less advanta∣ged as to this world, for all our care & pains in pleading Gods, the Kings, and the Churches Cause. In which I hope I have not been wholly wanting to my duty in the worst of times; nor shall I be now discouraged in these more Halcyon days, however my sun may seem to be in its Western decline, wher I find my self preferred as to much more love, civility and honor from the Gentry, sober Clergie & ingenuous peo∣ple of that Diocess then I can well de∣serve, so I am exposed to much more business and fatigue of life, sweeted with far less worldly comfort & tan∣quillity then formerly I enjoyed, when I had the happiness of a more convni∣ent as well as a more private and re∣tired condition, but Iow my self more to the publick cause of God and his Church, of my King and Country then to my own ease or private interest,

for those we must be willing to do, suffer, and deny our selves in any thing short of heaven, sin and hell; faithful seruice of them is our greatest free∣dom, highest honor, and will be at last our greatest reward, if we can but have patience to wait a few years till we pass to another world, where the crown of eternall glory shall be set on the head of that vertue which en∣vie here may depress: That you with my self may persevere in sincerely pleading and promoting Gods bles∣sed Cause (which is our own) is the earnest prayer of, Your very humble Servant
