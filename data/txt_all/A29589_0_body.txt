SIR,

COuld I but use my Pen, as You Your Sword,
I'd Write in Blood, and kill at every Word:
The Hogans then my Muse's Pow'r should feel,
And find my Verse as fatal as Your Steel.
But sure, Great Prince, none can presume to Write
With such Success as You know how to Fight:

Who carry in Your Looks th' Events of War,
Design'd like Caesar for a Conquerour.
The World of Your Atchievements is afraid,
While Neptune's Watry Kingdoms You Invade;
And that much-courted Mistress th' Ocean's now
Not by th' Venetian-Duke Espous'd, but You.


And now, Great Prince, may You Victorious be,
Your Fame and Arms o'er-spreading Land and Sea:
May You our haughty Neighbours overcome,
And bring Rich Spoils, and Peaceful Laurels Home;
Whilst They, Their Ruine or Your Pardon meet,
Sink by Your Side, or fall before Your Feet.
