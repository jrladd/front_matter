May it please Your Honour,
BEING to expose this Translation to a
World, who generally have a great indifference (not to say
a∣version) for the Mysteries of OUR RELIGION, es∣pecially
That of the HOLY EUCHARIST, and have espoused
Maxims quite op∣posite to Those here laid down, I had
reason to be∣lieve it would stand in need of a Powerful Authority
to support and vindicate it a∣gainst the Cavils and Pre∣judices, that in
the minds of many may rise against the Subjects it treats of. And
as I was looking about for such a PATRONAGE, which (at once) might as well by
its GREATNESS au∣thorize and commend, as by its GOODNESS ex∣emplifie 
and attest them, it was my happiness to fix up∣on YOUR
HONOUR, who is so signally and in∣contestably possest of both
these Advantages. This, MADAM, was the Con∣sideration made me
aspire to the boldness of craving YOUR ILLUSTRI∣OUS NAME, to counte∣nance
these Papers; in conde∣scending to which, as your HONOUR will do
ma∣nifest Justice to PIETY, so will it be interpreted a 
transcendent Favour to, and ever acknowledged as such
by,
May it please Your Honour,
