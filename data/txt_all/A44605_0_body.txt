Great Caesar, and Senators.
In all Humility, most Humbly I inform You
THere is nothing more Certain and True, Than that there are ma∣ny
extraordinary Rich Veyns, Mines, and Mi∣neral Countries, in some Parts of America, which are now Annexed to and Dependant on the CROWN of England; (the Experience and Truth of which, nothing but want of Skill in Mineral Af∣fairs, and Incredulity, can or will deny); which Veyns and Mines, if they was Sought for, and
Set to Work, by any that understands them, would undoubtedly, in a little Time, prove as Rich as any the Spaniards have in Peru, or on the North Side of the Aequinox, in New-Spain; and, in a few Years, would pro∣duce and raise great Quantities of Silver, Gold, Copper, and o∣ther Valuable Things, to the great Content and Sa∣tisfaction
of the English; provided there was any Regular LAWS, RULES, and METHODS Settled, for Working, and Carry∣ing on the said Mines; by which LAWS, the En∣terprisers, or Under∣takers thereof, might Enjoy and Secure their Rights, Interests, and Properties therein, to Them, their Heirs, and Assigns, after they have
been at the Cost and Char∣ges of Finding and Dis∣covering the said Mines. But, as the Royalties there∣of stand, at present, (in their respective and sepa∣rate Grants from the CROWN) to a few PRO∣PRIETORS, who formerly hath not, at present doth not, nor hereafter, in all Probability, will not use any effectual Ways and Means to Work an Dis∣cover
the same; whereby this excellent Underta∣king hath hitherto been Neglected and Slighted, and is yet rendred Impra∣cticable to all English-Men; and so will remain to Posterity; by which) many Rich Veyns and Mines have been, are, & will be of no Benefit; but continue Void, and utterly Lost, unless some further Care be taken, than yet
hath been, for Settling and Methodizing the same: The evil Circumstances of which; hath been, is, and will be, if not remedied, an unvaluable Loss to the English Nation, in Ne∣glecting to give all due Encouragement to improve this Honourable Enter∣prize; which would greatly encrease the Revenues of the CROWN, and advance the English Nation's In∣terest,
to an unspeakable Degree, in a little Time. Therefore, that the King's most excellent Maje∣sty, in his Princely Wis∣dom, together with this Present Parliament, would be Graciously Plea∣sed to take it into Conside∣ration, and amend this Mischief, by making the following ARTICLES, (or some such other, as the Government shall approve
off) for Standing LAWS, and CUSTOMS, to be Ob∣served and Practised by all the KING's Subjects in America; whereby the Enterprize would become National to the English Posterity, and every Free-Born Subject have Liberty to Seek, Find, and Enjoy the Fruit of his Labours; Paying to the CROWN, the Duties and Reser∣vations here-after men∣tioned,
Is the sole Desire, and earnest Request of.
