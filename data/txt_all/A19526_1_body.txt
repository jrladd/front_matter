ZEuxis painted a Childe bearing Vine clusters in his hand so per∣fectly, that the Fowles of the ayre were deceiued, & descended there∣to in vaine: But angrie at his worke, he cry'd out, I haue painted the Clusters more liuely then the Child, and the burthen better then the bearer; for had the Child seemed as vine as the Vine Grapes, the Fowles had bin affraied at his face. I haue in these amorous Sonets and Songes matchles Idea, virtuous Cynthia, graue Lithocardia, sweete Kala, louely Erantina, lasci∣uious Lais, modest Pandora, liberall Penelopae, painted my Loue; but haue (allasse) taken more paines on the Passions, then the Poyems; and more

worke on my woes, then the Verses. But had my Lines been as liuely as either they should, or I wish they had been. No Momus affraide at the beau∣tie of my Verses, had presum'd (to my disgrace) to gather the Grapes of my Errors. Nor had I nee∣ded (which necessarily I must doe) to employ the Patrocinie of your protections. Were I an other Hercules, I could not cut off all the hissing heads of Hydra: & were I as perfect a Painter as Apel∣les, some sawsie Souter shall censure aboue the Sho. But with Agatharchus (who did all in haste) I humbly craue at all your handes (which with all reuerence, and analogike seruice I kisse) and looke you will excuse
