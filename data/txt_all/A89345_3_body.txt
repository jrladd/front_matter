SIR,
IN the Garden and Para∣dise of God (not that Terrestrial which long since perished, but the Heavenly which hath not suffered by any Cataclysm) grows the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Know∣ledge, which God as the chief Husband∣man and Gardener both planteth and watereth, and causeth to encrease: Though it hath pleased Almighty God to plant and sow semina quaedam &

frutices, some seeds and shrubs of Knowledge and Life in this earth∣ly Garden, and set Man therein to dress and keep it, whose fruits (though in this life they come not to full maturity and perfection, yet) serve us for a tast of those spiritual & never fading fruits in Heaven; since by the pains and indu∣stry of some Labourers in this Vine∣yard, and the blessing of God, the Sun of Righteousness shining upon their la∣bours, some fruits have been here ga∣thered relishing much of the Heavenly perfection. The Fruits ensuing are of this nature, which I as a Gleaner have gathered from others, and dedicate as the choicest of my labours, and as I hope the welcomest present unto you; the former Treatises adding little benefit, but what you have formerly reaped from your own experience, being ever the best School-mistris: The two parts

of this Rational life, the Practick and Speculative you may read in the Hi∣story of your own life, who have well nigh by the course of Nature finished both; the Clue of your thread being almost spun out, and drawing on a∣pace to the period set by the Prophet David, Psalm 90. Wherefore leaving those things that are behind, looking not backward at time past, you press for∣ward to the things that are before, if by any meanes you can attain to the Resurrection of the Just, to that state of life which consists in Beatifical Vi∣sion to come, which this ensuing Trea∣tise, though in much weakness points unto; May it lay the way open before you, and give you such a tast of the joyes of Heaven, as may sharpen your stomach, and quicken your appetite, but not hasten your progress thither; for serus in coelum redeas, may you

enjoy a long life here, and Heaven at the last, are the hearty wishes, and day∣ly prayers of,
Sir,
