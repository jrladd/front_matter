My LORD,
THIS Play, which I humbly here present to your Lordship, was, at first, only meant as a private Tryal to my self, of what I cou'd do in this kind of Poesie; I had not the least hope of ever seeing it on the Stage. After 'twas finish'd, it lay by me for some time, as a thing forgot and totally neglected; till an Ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who took the pains to peruse it, gave me incouragement to look it over a little heedfully, as seeing something in it (he was pleas'd to say) that, with Improvement, might make it accepted on the Stage. I took his Council: But after∣wards found so much interruption and discouragement from some prejudic'd Gentlemen, who ought to have us'd me better, or, at least, had no reason to use me ill, that I repented I had bestow'd any time upon it, tho' indeed 'twas but little. But they now, however, see the Folly and Arrogance of being positive before hand; and that 'tis not a private Taste, but the general Acceptance that ought to determine in these Matters. In spite of 'em, my Lord, it was kindly receiv'd, and that too, at a time when the Town was never known thinner of Nobility

and Gentry; a▪ Fortune, I neither expected or deserv'd: For I must do my Enemies the Justice to declare, they can't have so mean an Opinion of it as my self. And this Consideration, my Lord, obliges me at once to beg Pardon for making You a Present of such a Trifle, and to reflect on what I am doing; for I have hitherto rather entertain'd your Lordship with an Advertisement than a Dedication: But, I confess, it was purposely so intended; for your Lordship, I am sensible, had rather hear any thing than your own Praises. Never was so much Mo∣desty joyn'd with a Temper so Heroick and Noble; Ne∣ver was so engaging a Condescention seen, in One of so great a Fortune and Extraction; Never was there a Zeal for Religion more stedfast and temperate than your Lord∣ship's; or a Charity, ev'n in the Primitive Times of Chri∣stianity, more diffusive and impartial; and never, indeed, were our Dedications directed to a more Judicious and Generous Patron, where the Merit of Authors is cer∣tainly rewarded, and their Failings as certainly for∣given. I cou'd here, methinks, with a great deal of Ardor, go into your Panegyrick: But tho' I my self, in respect to your Lordship, am silent upon that admirable Subject, the many Books laid at your Feet in this Age, will be Testimonies to the succeeding, how much your Lordship is the Delight and Esteem of it: Whatever be∣comes of this Piece, Posterity will there find You, and in more shining and durable Colours than cou'd be laid by the unskilful Pencil of,
My Lord, Your Lordship's entirely obliged and most humble Servant,
Robert Gould.
