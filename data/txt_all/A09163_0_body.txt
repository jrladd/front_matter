SALOMON that pereles prince of prudēce (right Wor∣shyppfull) amonge his pithye Para∣bles perswading to the searchīg forth of wisdom & her fruits, sayeth: The path of the Righteous shineth as the light, that is euer brighter & brigh∣ter, vnto the perfect daye: But the waye of the vngodlye is as the darcknesse, they knowe not where they fall. Doubtlesse as euery Age hath eyther had his integritie or imperfection, wherein aswel the felicitie, as indempnitie of humane estate hath appeared, more or lesse, to be praysed for the worthynesse, or pitied for the wretchednesse: So is it a true testimonye of the inestimable loue of Godlent towardes those which beinge duely directed in the path of perfection doe nothinge digresse there from, but persist constant vnto the ende, rather encrea∣singe then empairing their felicitie: And on the other part, where suche as eyther reiecte their calling, or withstande the wisedome of God, doe walcke in bywayes, and wander in wilful darcknesse. Who hath not seene that the indignation of God hath bene euidentlye poured vppon them, scattringe them, & ouerthrowing theym euen in their own wickednes? the profe whereof approcheth euen vntill these present dayes, in suche sorte among Christians, that if Heraclitus the heathen phi∣losopher were now agayne liuing, and should but once step out at his dores, to view the state and condicion of the tyme pre∣sent (wheras in his dayes he wept but hy fittes, to see the infe∣licitie of that age) I verely suppose he would now continually

shede teares abundantly without stinting, to see the ruinous de∣cay of Christianitie in this later age: and I doubt also, if De∣mocritus were again liuing, & did behold the doinges of bothe sortes of people in the world, whether he wold laughe for ioye in contemplating of the prosperous estate of the best christiās, or deride the froward fortune of the most wicked & vngodly at this day. Albeit throughout Christendom now, what king∣dome, coūtrie or cōmon weale appeareth altogether so peace∣able and prosperous, which hath not bene lately, or is not pre∣sently encōbred with obscuritie and absurditie of lyfe, & ma∣ners? as some walking in the righteous path, haue their lighte emblemished by others of the house of Iniquitie: some faine would walke the true path, and with ciuil dissention are sepe∣rated frō their godly purposes. But the greater part no doubt, refusing light for dirknesse, do so nuzzle thēselues in wicked¦nesse, that they laboure with malignitie, to worcke a confused Chaos of christianitie in general. In the midst of whom, behold (right Worshipful) greately to thadmiration of the rest, about vs▪ but more to our priuate consolacion, and most of all to the glory of thimmortal God, the vnspeakeable loue and eternall good grace of his blessing, appeareth in most bright beames of his blisful bountie, ouershadowing this our natiue countrie of England, with far more superabundant felicities, then many other naciōs: namely by so lōg, peaceable & prosperous course of Christes Gospell, that infallible lampe of light, directed and protected by so pereles & precious a prīcesse, so godly & grati∣ous a gouernesse, our most christian & dearest soueraigne La∣die Quene Elizabeth, assisted with so many christal starres of stately light vnder her, garnishing and sauegarding the good gouernment of this her maiesties Realme & dominions of the same, with most holsome, godly, & politique lawes, and consti∣tutiōs, for the cōtinual cōseruatiō of the publique weale ther∣of vniuersally, free frō all priuate preiudice and publique per∣turbation. This then so surpassing felicitie dulye considered, what subiect is not throughly enforced, freely to vtter & ex∣presse the receiued cōfort which he feeleth inwardly & seeth

so apparauntly? Verely when I the meanest member of thou∣sandes, reuolue this benefite in my mynde, and see how far be∣yond the expectation and desertes of man, the prouidence of God dealeth with vs, thus stil preseruing vs, & sufferig others to quayle in their froward fortunes & calamities: beinge in∣wardly lightened with a certayn secret consolation in the one respect, & outwardly with painful pen pitying & deploring the state of the other: As duty chiefly byndeth me, I haue at this presēt enforced my studye (thoughe as a Pigmeian in simple power) to practise somewhat with Hercules, or as otherwise desirous to trauel with Vlisses, to win (albeit with wearines) somwhat if it were possible by any good meanes, to benefit this bulwarke of beatitude (this my natiue coūtry I mean) which with such multitude of worthy practisioners notwithstanding, is alreadye made famous, yet ceassed I not with Sysiphus to roule the stone, but in such penury of power as, Architas the Philosopher attributinge to be the appropriate discommodi∣tie to dexteritie of witte, which I denie to be remaynīg in me, I haue hazarded my pore hap in such simple hādiworke (as I could, though not so wel as I would) in translating out of La∣tine into English, nine Bookes of the Godly, reuerend and lear∣ned FRANCIS PATRICIVS Bishoppe of Caie∣ta in Italie: whose workes in the worthines thereof reuiuinge the aucthor, deade three score yeares agoe and vpwardes, were in the Latine tongue by him left & intituled by the na∣me of Commentaries of the institution, state, and gouernmēt of a commō Weale. Whiche albeit it conteine prophane prin∣ciples of olde time, enterlaced with the actions, opinions, exā∣ples, Counsels, Sentences, and Sayinges of Heathen Empe∣rours, Kinges, Princes, Captaynes, Oratours, Philosophers, and suche lyke, for the direction of Mundane matters, in Ciuyll gouernmente, with the Learned opinion of the Auc∣thour discoursing vppon-euerye particularitye: Yet there∣in is Copie of matter worthye Memorye and Imitation for euery estate and member of a good christian cōmon weale at this daye. And because it briefly so toucheth good order, in mayntenaunce of a Monarchye, and the gouernment thereof:

I haue entituled it, A Morall Methode of ciuile Pollicie, prefixing the particuler contentes before euerye booke, wyth annotatiōs in the Margin, reducinge the same into one Ta∣ble Alphabeticall, for the more direct assertion of the particu∣larities in euery seuerall booke. But this y my rashe attēpte at the first so boldely begon, in continuaunce so bluntlye done and finished, neyther beautified nor burnished with anye bux∣omnes of apt & eloquent English phrase: fearing much mine owne imperfection therein, I laboured not onelye, to haue the same surueig hed, but also supplied, with more learned skille and aucthority, before I would hazard the publishing therof. Whiche when I had obtayned, euen then bethinkinge mee on whō I might best bestow the benefite of this my simple trauel: beyonde the desertes of all others, consideringe with my selfe the manifeste benefites whiche I haue receyued from tyme to tyme these twelue yeares at your worshippes bountiful hands: I deemed my selfe a debter euen in dutie to dedicate the sa∣me vnto you, as a testimonie of my thanckefull, seruisable, & well wishinge hart towardes you, as a pledge of the faythefull zeale that I beare to this famous Cittye of London, whereof you are an auncient Magistrate, and I your poore seruaunt a simple member of the same: and consequentlye, as an earneste token of my vnfayned good will and true meaninge towar∣des this my natiue country. Beseeching your Worshippe, and all other well meaning Magistrates to pardon my bolde rude∣nesse herein, and to accepte well in woorth my poore good will, and well meaning minde, as wishing vnto you especiallye that this my simple Myte, were in value more worth thē Mi∣das his golden Diademe, to bee throwen into the treasurye of your worthy deserts: and as if this my pore present, were more in price, then a purchased prize of precious Smaragdes from India (had they so luckely light in my lot) I could willingly at this present vouchesafe to thenriching of this my natiue coū∣trye: yet neuertheles (such as it is) pretending simply & syn∣cerelye, wishinge herein to profite, & pleasure all men, & not

to disprofite nor displease anye, I yelde the same to bee shiel∣ded vnder Gods good pleasure and youre worthie patronage. Cōcluding with dutiful and hartie praier vnto the almighty, for the long and prosperous preseruation of our most gracious soueraigne Lady the Queenes maiestie, and her honourable Counsellours: for the florishinge estate of this oure Publique weale in euery degree, where, including the welfare and feli∣citye of this honourable Cittie: by duetifull remembraunce I praye especially amongest all others, that your Worshippe, my good Lady & Mistres, your louing wife, and al your Childrē, may enioye longe and happie dayes on earth, and in fine, the most assured habitacle of perdurable felicities. Amen.
