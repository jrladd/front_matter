SIR,
ERe diverted by more serious Studies, which the benefit of an excellent Education espous'd to a natural inge∣nuity, will soon render the rathe-ripe fruits of Your pregnant Wit, I hope it wil in me appear no unbecoming boldness, whilst your youth claimes the priviledge of Recreations, to present you with this, which though trivial in it self, improved b your acceptance, may become worthy the view of others; who beholding your Name beautifie its front, may give it as fair an esteem as if they saw it adorned

with all the advantages of the Publique Stage; which since this rigid Age hath silenced, (if I may be so happy to ob∣tain) I shall value your single acceptance beyond the loud applause of a Theater. If the Reading afford you but as many minutes as the Composure did me hours of retired content, I shall think these low delights of youthful fancy worthy the esteem of my maturer thoughts, to which the burthens of imployment ha now added (if not more Judgement▪ yet more Solidity. Nor shall I repent to have rowz'd it from its so long ly∣ing dormant, it being then in the embryo, when with us, War first made the pre∣sent Age unhappy, so may have some∣thing to exscuse the roughness of its style▪ its production being whilst I sacrifice to Minerva in the Temple of Mars Deities, which we have fair Prog∣nosticks

may be both propitio fu∣ture Achievements; for which, toge∣ther with an affluence of all other per∣fections, shall ever be sacrificed the hear∣ty prayers of
SIR,
