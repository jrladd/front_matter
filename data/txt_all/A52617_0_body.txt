Dear Brother,
I Began this Translation in the Circumstances of an uncomfortable old Age and ruined For∣tune, brought upon me, rather by publick Calamity than private Vice, or domestick Prodi∣gality. And I undertook it to divert the melan∣choly hours, arising from the consideration of ei∣ther. And as the intention was private, and with∣out the least thought of making it publick; so I judged it every way best not to exceed those limits, till some, acquainted with the affairs of those times, desiring it might see the light, and I then consider∣ing the Friendship that hath always been betwixt us, and that particular owning a share in all my misfortunes, and a readiness to be assistant to me in them: I thought it did of right belong to you; and that I might without vanity owne also so much of

publick, as to publish to whomsoever shall read this Book the true value and sense I have of your Love and Kindness to me and mine, exercised with a Generosity without many Examples.
I therefore desire you (Dear Brother) to accept it, not as that whereby you receive any thing but the Testimony of the Respect I bear you, and re∣tribution I owe you; yet I presume I shall not de∣ceive you, if I promise you, that are a heedful Rea∣der, that you shall find in it Reflections useful for the way you are in both of Court and Camp, and matter to give you occasion to acknowledge, it may deserve a place amongst the best of Modern Writers, if not the first, unless it have received too much disadvantage by the unskilfulness of the Interpreter. But I will not raise that expectation by so weak an Argument as mine own Judgment, but leaving it to yours, subscribe my self
