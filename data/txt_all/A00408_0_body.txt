HAuing (good Madam) at the vrgent im∣portunitie of some of my best Friends, reared vp the walls of this simple Edi∣fice, as you fee, and fearing (the weakenesse therof being such) that it needed some sup∣port to keepe it from falling: At length my ambiguous thoughts seized vpon your worships patronage. I haue long registred in my heart a gratefull acknowledgement of your (and my good patrones benefits ex∣tended towards mee:) and wanting worthie meanes in reall requittance to expresse the same; I presumed (which is all I could) in this dedication to manifest. Not forgetting your worthie and Right worshipfull Father Phillip Beuile, with your vertuous Mother, whose bountifull Hospitalitie, charitable li∣beralitie, religious gouernment of their Fa∣milie, plainely sheweth to the worlde, that they hold thēselues, not borne vnto them∣selues, to liue to themselues, but as good

Stewards of Gods manifold blessings, plēti∣fully powred vpō them, to diffuse the same to the good of manie; which (I assure you) hath wonne the loue of the rich, the praiers of the poore, and the applause and praise of all farre and neere in your country. If the reading of these my poore Labours at ydle houres may yeeld you any contēt or com∣fort, it is the thing I wish: yet more then I can promise, saue only in regard of the sub∣stāce. Small (I confesse) is the gift in regard of the Author, but great indeed, in respect of the worthines of the subiect, which (if no thing else) I am perswaded, will giue it good acceptance with the well inclined. These my labours I commit to your worships fa∣uorable protection: promising that if time & industrie shall bring forth more mature fruits of my studies (by Gods assistāce) here∣after, you shall also bee partakers of them.
In the meane time, take (I beseech you) in good part, these my well wishings to your welfare, and praiers to the Almightie, that he would cōtinue his blessings towards you in this life, & after this mortal race run out, grāt you the fruition of his heauenly kingdome.
