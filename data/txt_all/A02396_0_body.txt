SIR: I request you to bee God-father vnto this In∣fant, as you haue beene sometime vnto my selfe. It is thought an abruptnesse to imprint anything without a Dedication, which makes me thus bold with your name. I hope you will take it at my hands no otherwise then as a token of my thankefulnesse for your manifold and fatherly affe∣ction. In which respect I principal∣ly commend it vnto you: as also

vnto your two Daughters, my Co∣sen Yeluerton, and the Ladie Strange: I must also commend the perusall of it vnto Mr. Ro∣bert Rudde of St. Florence in Southwales, and Mr. Henrie Godly of Onehouse in Suf∣folke, my very good and learned Tutors, togetherwith my singular friend Mr. Doctor Porter of Cambridge. Finally, the vse and benefit of it I commmend, as vnto my Christian Friends the Pa∣rishioners of Edgfield, so also vnto as many as loue the single, gentle, and powerfull truth, espe∣cially in the Text following.
