Beloved,
THere wanted not strength of discou∣ragement to stifle this weak birth, but the thoughts of my heart, thorow divine assistance, gave strength of incouragement to
 bring forth; My heart told me, how much the Saints have blessed God, for the pious, and plain books of the godly, which were more hearty, and lesse specious, breath∣ing Christ crucified, and hearts crucified, and what a power my soul hath found, in that plainnesse and simplicity, wherein they have sent abroad their pious, practi∣call discourses, as in their na∣tive dresse. An over-bearing flood of thoughts followed, speak∣ing out the cause I have to set up, some such pillar of thank∣fulnesse to my God, who carried the work of my Ministry, tho∣row inhibitions, suspension, ex∣communications, in time of the height of the power, and persecu∣tion of the Bishops; Though I might not runne the race of one year at Ringly-Chappel, whether I was first called: and in that
 imperfect year was twice inhibi∣ted: though in nine or ten years at Denton Chappel, I preached not above two separated years, (to my best remembrance) without interruption, and in that time was twice excommunicated; Though Sabbath-Assemblies were sundry times distractedly, and sorrow∣fully broken up, and my depar∣ture fm habitation and people, often forced, no means left in sight of returne, yet thorow the fervent praiers of the Church, (whereto these hard afflictions were appa∣rently serviceable,) God was gra∣ciously and effectually moved, con∣tinually to renue liberty, as they continually interrupted it, they shut, and God opened, they shut, and God opened, till God would no more be troubled with them, but took the keys of power, out of the hands of upstart proud Shebna,
 to give them to outed, despised, faith∣full Elakim. And no lesse cause have I to set a starre of observation (to advantage Gods pra se,) upon divine providence, preserving to admiration myThe like mercy God shevv∣ed me, when the Parle of Derbey lay about Manche∣ster al∣most a vvek, though the plun∣dering Souldiers went as frre some other waies, yet God turn∣ed them from us, and gave us leave to keep the Nationall ast in blique, t very w. house, study, and papers, when some of Prince Ruperts plundering forces passed nigh the door, in the year of our heavy visitation, when his whole Army entred Stockport, within three miles of us, and no opportunity left for removing any thing, nor any durst stay in the house; to him we com∣mitted all by praier, and at our returne we found nothing wanting, not a door opened, not a window broken; Though in times past, scarce a year passed but I was driven from home, yet in these troubles I have rest∣ed at home, thorow the multi∣tude of his mercies all the time,
 save one Moneth, when the Princes forces ranged and reign∣ed in our Country; My soul shall make her boast in the Lord, the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name to∣gether, Psal. 34.2, 3. For your sakes also, having found help from God, to labour so long and suffer so much, I was willing to combate with mine own discou∣ragements unto victory. God hath kept you hitherto, blessed, blessed be his name, in truth, piety, love and peace, to my great comfort and incouragement, in all my troubles and straight∣nesse, in outward, and earthly respects: but I am afraid, out of the abundance of my love to you, and care for you, in these dan∣gerous times, (wherein many evil
 spirits are let loose, forI lok upon the distēpers of these times, as a sharp correction to god∣ly Mini∣sters, for their hu∣miliation, and better prepara∣tion for some o∣ther work, as an effe∣ctuall tē∣ptation to the peo∣ple, to discover those cor∣ruptions: that being covered with the cloak of profssion, have lived and grown under powerfull Odinces, and as a signe and means of the removing of the Gospel, at lest by such instruments to desolate places, the work of his servants fag, God will provide new, and when wanton people are wer ed with their own wayes, the wayes of God will be the more precious. affliction to godly painfull Preachers, and for temptation to their hearers) lest you being led away by the errour of the wicked, should fall from your own stedfastnes; and doe therefore pray, and indeavour, that you may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ. If the quickning spirit shall quick∣en your affections and graces, unto duties of communion with Christ, the fountain of life (the matter laboured in preaching and printing these Sermons,) he will quicken those duties to be con∣du-pip s of life: whereas, in
 ordinary experience, dead hearts are suited with dead and unfrut∣full Ordinances, the sad and dangerous experience of the pre∣sent times. I have sadly ob∣served, after the beginning of these unexpested, glorious, joy∣full times of liberty, after some more lively springings, and workings, both of hearts and Ordinances, when the light brake out of darknesse, and li∣berty out of bondage, great dead∣nesse hath fallen, continud, and increased, upon both hearts and Ordinances; A main reason I take to be this, the sharpning, and whetting afflictions of the Church, which forced their gra∣ces, unto frequent and fervent exercise, in holy duties, being re∣moved, they have remitted their fervency, not improving their liberties, to that end, that God
 improved their afflictions, and God hath remitted his Spirit in Ordinances, they have not stir∣red up their harts to take hold of God, they have not rejoyced to work righteousnesse, as some∣times: and God hath not offered himself in Ordinances, sent his Spirit to meet them, nor given them his loves, as sometimes. To passe by the evidence of this sad rprt, found in the unhum∣blednesse, and unaffectednesse of the godly, in midst of so many pressing causes, and under so great helps, and the generall ineffica y of the Ordinances for conversion, stay your selves, and wonder, fear and tremble, at the evidence given in, by the abounding of errours, desertion of Gods pub∣lique wrship, contempt of that Ministry God hath so highly ho∣noured, and so richly blessed, e∣ven
 by those that have been in∣grafted into Christ, and nourish∣ed up in hm thereby, with much tendernesse, pains, and patience, the exchange of duties of piety, expressing and increasing the pow∣er of godlinesse, for hot and wrang∣ling dsputes about strange do∣ctrines and governments, and the bitter fruits of these disputes and differences, the seperation of hearts, and communion a∣mongst the truly godly: th fear∣full out-breakings of wrath, en∣vy, evil speakings, the uncha∣ritable, unchristian provoking censures of estates and actions, the almost incredible propen∣sity to fall out with, and fall upon our loving and faithfull brethren of Scotland, together with deceitfull, dangerous, over∣weening, and bold confidences of excelling light, grace, spirit,
 inlargements, comforts, &c. Here is room enough for a large heart to powre out bitter soul-breaking expostulations. O where is the spirit of the Lord, that was wont to possesse the hearts of the god∣ly, to strengthen grace there, to keep good order in the soul, to keep in and under, these masters of mis-rule? O where is that spirit that was wont to fill the Ordinances, and in them cleerly to discover to the godly, the distempers of their hearts, and disorders of their waies, and powerfully to break their hearts for sinne, and from it? Is it possible the spirit should be in the hearts of Gods peo∣ple, and in his own Ordinan∣ces, in as plentifull a mea∣sure as sometimes, and so much of the flesh, and so little of the spirit appear in these times of so
 many, and great, unlooked for, unthought of, amazing, astonish∣ing, Nationall mercies, Gospel-inlargement, wonders of provi∣dence, Humiliations, Thankesgi∣vings, Covenants, and indea∣vours for thorow Reformation? Sure it cannot be. O where is the wisdome, love, humility, meeknesse, tendernesse of consci∣ence, compassion, patience, for∣bearance, long suffering, that was wont to triumph in the godly, and to be the glory of Religion, even in the eies of the irreligious? My dearly beloved sadly think of these things, and let such sad considerations work unto serious search, whether some of you also, have not lost your first love, that you may remember from whence you are falln, repent, and doe your first work: or, unto an wholsome preserving fear, least
 you should depart by degrees from God, in the lively ex∣pressions of love, and he should by the same degrees, depart from you in the life of Ordi∣nances: you were never in so much danger since your profes∣sion began as now: That of our Saviour is abundantly ve∣rified: Matthew 12.43. The unclean spirits that were gone out of men, finding the rooms empty, swept and gar∣nished, are returned with se∣ven spirits more wicked then themselves, and they dwelt there: And that of Paul, Acts 20.30. In many parts of the Kingdome is acted o∣ver again: Of your own selves shall men arise, speak∣ing perverse things, to draw away Disciples after them. Therefore watch and remem∣ber
  have formerly preac , not without tempta  d tears, and what I  now written to you, that ye lose not those things that ye have wrought, but that ye may receive a full reward. It is in the desire of my heart, that I may not be negligent to put you al∣waies in remembrance of these things: yea, I thinke it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to stirre you up, by putting you in remembrance, knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle: And in this work I have indeavour∣ed, that you may be able after my decease, to have these things alwaies in re∣membrance, 2 Pet. 1.12, 13, 14, 15. If the Lord shall keep
 you from despising  Ordinan∣ces, which I ta  ve∣ry beginning of  pers of the times, and  eep up in you an honourable esteem of Gods Ordinances, (and parti∣cularly of those Orthodox, god∣ly, painfull Ministers, that have brought home your own souls, or the souls of others, and led on the people of God towards perfection for many years, bearing the burden and heat of the day, and not be bewitched, as the foolish Galathians and Corinthians, with flourishing high-flown, flash∣ing men, whose piety lies in parts, whose power lies in no∣velties, and whose baits lie in gilded words, and dissem∣bled carriages, who vapour for a little while, and then ex∣tinguish for want of substance)
 that will keep you in a prepa∣red, attentive, profitable at∣tendance upon them, in which way God will converse fami∣liarly with you, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, set∣tle you. All that I now de∣sire in recompence of my re∣newed pains for your good, in a time when my body was not very fit for it, is your purposed fervent praiers, to him that hath the seven spirits of God, that he would pour out his spirit upon his people, that they may discover how woful∣ly their own hearts, and Sa∣tan have deceived them, clear∣ly discern Gods bitter anger in their strange affections, ex∣pressions, and carriages one to another, that with Ioseph and his brethren, they may meet and weep one in anothers bo∣some,
 humble their souls before God together, seek of God to∣gether the wayes of communi∣on, being troubled at, and wea∣ry of the wayes of separation, from their approved beloved brethren, and not rest till they have recovered their love to God, and reunited their affecti∣ons and societies, that their hu∣miliations and supplications, re∣covering their former vigour, they may prevail mightily with God, to poure out his spirit up∣on his Ordinances in greater measure then ever, to the in∣lightning of the ignorant, con∣verting of the prophane, cleer∣ing of doubts, reconciling of differences, increasing of the pow∣er of godlinesse, perfecting of Re∣formation, and edification of the body of Christ. In joyfull expecta∣tion of your ready, and unanimous
 concurrence in this desire: I doe heartily take leave and remaine, whilst the chief shepard shall con∣tinue my commission, and work amongst you,
