TO make one slender somme (a season) to suffice
two creditors, for two long-dew deepe debts J owe,
I am perforce constraind to part my paiment so;
which vse (I grant indeed) is but bad marchant-guise.
Yet when through wrack by sea, or hindrance otherwise
great worlds of massie wealth doo into wanting go
right honest men (of force) in such sad ouerthrow
to please all parties, thus their rests must portionize.
As I, alas! (the ship of mine hopes treasure rent
on ruthlesse ragged rocks, in seas of swolne despaire)
seeke as my rest will reach, your bonds (deer-loued paire)
Of count-lesse courtesies, and kindnesse to content:
take thus much in meane while, I call not in my bill,
if fortune chance to smile, J stand your debtor still.
 After the dawne, comes day.
