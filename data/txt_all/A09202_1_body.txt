NOW strike wee Saile, and throw aside our oare,
My wearie Muse, the worst is well nie past:
And take a while, our pleasure on the shore,
Recounting what wee overcame at last:
To what deepe danger were our fortunes cast:
What Rocks, the greatest, & vnknowen shelues,
We dar'd to touch, and yet did saue our selues.


HENRY, who art both Load-stone, and the starre,
Of Heartes and Eies, our wished Loue and Light:
By thee conducted, we arriue thus farre;
That now OPINIONS vttermost despight,
Nor ENVIE, that the iustest one doth bite,
We doubt at all; but forth into the maine,
With doubled courage, put our selues againe.


And you great PRINCESSE, through whose Christall brest,
ELIZAS Zeale, and Pietie doe shine,
Heire of her Name, and Virtues, that invest
You in our Heartes, and Loues immortall shrine:
Oh send from that pure Maiestie of thine,
Those beames againe, from whence (as PHOEBVS bright)
Our feeble Muse, deriues her life and light.


Eeke pardon (PEERES,) that heere my ruder verse,
Vnto your worthes, and greatnes dares aspire;
Or out of course, if I your rankes reherse:
But as i'th Presence, twixt the Lord and Squire,
(He neere the state, the other by the fire,)
Small difference seemes; so heere most Honord traine,
Ye take your lots about your Soveraigne.


Ad whatsoever EIE shalt else peruse,
These ruder lines, devoid of skill and Art;
Reserue thy good opinion of our Muse,
That may heereafter wore of worth impart:
And though she tstes of Countrey and the Cart,ININATVS a noe Roane, cald from his plough, t the Dictaorship.
(As that DICTATOR) all in time she may,
Within the Citie beare a greater swey.
