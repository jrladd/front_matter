Right Honorable,
I Often meditating with my self, to whom I should (according to the ancient and well approued cu∣stome of the best learned of all ages) consecrate these my labours, I at length resolued, in te∣stimonie, of my deuoted affections to your Honour, as also in regard of the worthines and vtilitie of the subiect (which is the Die∣teticall part of Physicke, that for preserua∣tion of health appertaines to all men, but to none, as I suppose, more then to your Honour, who vnder his Maiestie, doth cheifly weild the state of our Reipublique)

to commit them to your Honours prote∣ction. Whereunto, your benigne Nature, excellent learning, and singular respect to∣wards learned men, haue not a litle also en∣couraged me. If the worke shall yeeld any manner of delight or profit to your Ho∣nour, I haue my ayme and contentment. The God of Heauen grant you a long and healthy life, with a prosperous fruition of your Place and Dignities, to his Glory, your owne Comfort, and the Good of his Maie∣sties subiects. Thus referring both my self, and this worke to your fauourable accep∣tance, I in all obseruance humbly rest
