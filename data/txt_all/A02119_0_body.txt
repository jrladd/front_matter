MOST HONOURED LORD,
I Shall perhaps move Envie to say, Quae te tam laeta tule∣runt secula? but for my selfe, I am bound to say it, who have re∣ceived from your Lordship, indeed
 a great Favour, the remission of a great Debt; for which notwith∣standing I account my selfe to stand obliged still, though in a lesse profi∣table, yet in a more binding Obli∣gation, to bee your perpetuall ser∣vant. I am called upon by Grate∣fulnesse, to erect some Monument in honour of your Bountie; and a more lasting Monument, I could not thinke of, within the compasse of my poore abilities, then to Dedi∣cate these Psalmes of David, to the memorie of your Name: for though your owne Heroick vertue have made you a Monument of the same mettall that Fames Trumpet is made, which is likely, and worthy to last long; yet this
 perhaps, may prove Monumen∣tum Fama perennius; a Monu∣ment that will continue your memo∣rie, when Fame it selfe shall be bu∣ried in oblivion. But how long soe∣ver it shall continue, yet not so long as my Devotion to be, as my Desire to be accounted to be.
