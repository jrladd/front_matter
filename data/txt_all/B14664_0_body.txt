YOVR Maiesties Greatnes, Nobi∣litie, and Digni∣tie (descended vn∣to you from a King of France,
 your Father, surnamed Great, from a Great Queene your Noble Mother, from Kinges your Brothers, from Queenes your Sisters, and from the Great Monarch of Great Britaine, an other Charles the Great for his Princelie vertues, whose Beloued Spouse you are) daunteth me, & maketh me afrayd to approach to so great Maiestie with so litle a Present, as is this litle Pamphlet. But your Be∣nignitie, affabilitie, yea and Princelie Humilitie, which graceth your Maiestie, and is graced by it; as it hath wonne you the loue of all your Subiectes, euen of them
 who differ from you in Re∣ligion, and hath made you not onelie amiable, but also admirable to all the world: so it encourageth me, and biddeth me be bold, and euen assureth me, that this my Present, though litle and im∣proportionate to your Great∣nesse, will be Graciouslie ac∣cepted of so Gracious a Prin∣cesse, as proportionate at least to your Benignitie and Pietie.

This Myrrhine Posie of Christ his Dolours, your Maiesties pietie will daine to place in the bo∣some and breast of your de∣uout Soule, and your Blessed

God Almightie, who hath endowed your Maiestie with many guifts of Grace and nature; who hath giuen you such Constancie in the Ca∣tholike Fayth, that amon∣gest many contrarie winds of Doctrine, you haue not beene so much as shaken; VVho hath conserued you pure as a Lillie amongest thornes; VVho hath blessed you with a Royall Issue, which, though as yet it be younge and litle, is no litle strength to
