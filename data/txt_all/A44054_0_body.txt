Right Worshipful GENTLEMEN,
THE immense Priviledges and Immu∣nities, wherewith your present Sove∣reign, and indulgent Father, WILLIAM the Second, hath invested your Company, by that Octroy of the Year, 1695, argues his good Inclinations towards you so far, that whilst he was in the warmest Trenches of Namure, (and not sure but that Act might be his last Legacy) authoriz'd you and your Successors to Plant, and maintain Colonies in whatever Part,
or Parts of Asia, Affrica and America you pleas'd, provided these Places or Territories were not the Propriety of such European Princes or States, as were in Alliance of A∣mity with His Majesty; and freed you for the Space of Twenty One Years, from all Du∣ties on the Product of such Plantations, &c. You were not only impower'd to defend your Colonies and Trade by Force of Arms, but likewise had His Majesty's Promise to in∣terpose the Regal Authority, to do you Right, in case you were disturb'd in such Legal Possession or Trade, and that at the pub∣lick Charge (to be presum'd) of the Ancient Kingdom.
His Majesty having thus granted you so large and glorious a Patent, no to be para∣lell'd by that of any Company or Society in the Ʋniverse; much less by any of his Royal An∣cestors, your Native or Ʋnforeign Kings; both the present and after Ages will expect that the same should be transmitted by you, the present Directors, to your Successors, with∣out any Stain or Blemish that may incur the Hazard of a Forfeiture: And that by your Management, your Children may reap the Be∣nefits of it, with the same, if not with more Ad∣vantages.

This emboldens the Author (who was the first Person employ'd in your Service for your Foreign Expedition, and the first who left it) to lay the following Sheets at your Feet. And he takes upon him to put you in Mind, that if you had not misapply'd the Money intrusted to your Management (the Want whereof is so much felt at Home by the great Number of needy Persons, who expected their Dividends before now.) And if you had listen'd to the whole∣some Advice of Mr. Douglass, an eminent and experienc'd Man in India, who offer'd himself for your Pilot, and his Substance for your Security, which was more than the Three best Shares in your Capital Stock; and had not been bewitch'd to the Golden Dreams of Pa∣terson the Pedlar, Tub-preacher, and at last Whimsical Projector; you might e'er now have been possest of a good Colony in India, where no Body could disturb you: And not have run on an Airy Project, which (altho' you should have met with an Opposition from the Spani∣ard) four times your Capital Stock could not have brought to any reasonable Pitch of An∣swering the End. And had you been Masters of so much Management and Temper, as to have sav'd that Fifty Thousand Pounds, which you squander'd away on those Six Hulks you built at Amsterdam and Hamburgh, purely to make a Noise there of your Proceedings, where∣by
you thought to decoy the innocent Dutch Men, or at least their Gelt, into your Net; and had therewith bought a Couple of Second∣hand Ships in the River of Thames, and dispatch'd them to India with a suitable Cargoe, (not of Scotch Cloth, Slippers, Periwigs and Bibles) you might have had such Returns e'er now, as would have buoy'd you up so far above Water, as you needed not proclaim to the smi∣ling World so many publick Ropings of the Shares of your Capital Stock.
—Sed quos Deus or Jupiter perdere vult eos dementat.
If you were thus perswaded to run head∣long on a blind Project, at which the Trading Part of the World stand amaz'd; the India Companies of England and Holland laugh at in their Sleeve, and the rest of Mankind ad∣mire, that People in their right Senses should be guilty of: And if the same should miscarry by your own ill Management (to say no worse on't) 'tis not fair you should snarle at your Neighbours, who have no other hand in your Misfortune, than that they would not be accessary to any Act, which the World might judge Feloni∣ous; and wherein they could not join without ingaging themselves in an unreasonable War,
and in the End to assist you with Weapons, to break their own Heads.
WILLIAM the Second, who, as you say, in an untainted Line, is the 112th King that hath wore your Regal Diadem, has wrought and fought sufficiently for the Gift, your Nation prudently thought their Interest to make him. Or admit it should be true, that there was no private Interest consulted by those generous Do∣nators, yet it is obvious to the World, that by being Subjects of the King of Great Britain, you are not only shaded from the Insults of all Nations, but by the Authority of your British Sovereign, you are freed from the daily Feuds, and bloody little Wars, which, before the Ʋni∣on, for a Tract of Time, not less than 1900 Years, were continually raging amongst your selves; which unnatural Massacres your Na∣tive Princes were so unable to suppress, that when the contending Clans or Parties were glutted with one anothers Blood, and desir'd the Benefit of the Princely Mediation; those were pleas'd to accept of the Office of Ʋm∣pires, in Patching up the Feuds, till such time as the young Fry came of Age, to fight it out. These Barbarities have been quite turn'd out of Doors since the Ʋnion, and they are now, either almost or altogether forgot; neither are they to be reviv'd, unless it be by
this so-much-wish'd-for Separation of Three or Four Months Date. Your People now enjoy the Blessings of Heaven, and Product of the Earth, and Ocean without any interruption; and where∣as formerly they liv'd on the Mountains, and under the Shelter of some strong Rocks or Castles, they are now come down to the Plains, and can sleep sound in Beds, without the least Apprehension of Blood and Rapine. And to Crown your Felicity, you have now a free En∣joyment of the Gospel, in the Fulness and Pu∣rity thereof, which has ever been reckon'd the chief Care and Blessing of all Political Bodies. You are at Liberty to say your Prayers, either in Form, or out of Form, which you please, without any Dread of Sophistical Impositions by Romish or Malignant Priests. And now you praise your Maker in stately Churches, whereas, formerly these gallant Men, your Ancestors, were oblig'd to offer on such Altars as Jacob made, and to whisper their Prayers or Carrols through the Cliffs of the Mountains, or the Chimney of some House, whose Wall was some Twelve or Fourteen Foot thick. All these Blessings you owe to Heaven, and the British Monarchy, whatever some vitiated and de∣prav'd Palates perswade you to the Contrary.

The mask'd Champion of your Company, whose Tongue is much too big for his Mouth, is in Pain because he cannot spurt out all his Ve∣nom at one Blast. However reasonable it be, that the Gentleman's Zeal should atone for his want of Power, yet I must acquaint you, that his Quarrel with the English Nation is as un∣just and groundless, as your Settling a Colony in another Man's Dominions; unless by Virtue of your Presbyterian Tenent, viz. of Dominions being founded in Grace, you who are the Presumptive Elect pretend a Divine Right to the Goods of the Wicked, and so take upon you to cloath the Seven Councellors of your Colony with such another Commission, as God gave the Hebrews when they departed out of Egypt.
I have no Inclination to offer any Thing in Opposition to the Gallantry of your Ancestors, who took so much Care to keep themselves in∣dependent of another Nation. And altho' I pretend to know the Thread of the Scotish and British Story full as well as the Author of the Defence, yet out of Respect to the Coun∣try where I drew my first Breath (tho' I owe it nothing else) I will offer nothing to the Pre∣judice of it's Ancient Fame: But if I point at some Errata's of this Author, I do it purely to reconcile Mistakes, and to make a Distincti∣on betwixt the Scotch Company, and Scots
Nation; I being so much the Latter's Friend, as to wish them not to embrak in so rot∣ten a Bottom as this of your Company, un∣til you are on an honester Footing than you appear to be at present, that the Honour of the Ancient Kingdom mayn't be sully'd with so no∣torious a Mistake. I shall only say in Answer to this Paragraph, that altho' your Ancestors were never sparing of their Blood in defending their Country, nay, oftimes in making Reprizal when they could conveniently; yet I must put you in mind, that they were far better pleas'd with enjoying themselves in their old Caledonian Mountains, than you are now with both Hills and Plains: And I dare say, they had such a Value for their Native Blood, that they would not have been guilty of sending so many inno∣cent and worthy Gentlemen (like Sheep to the Slaughter, or Spanish Mines) so far from Home on such an April Errand.
'Tis both hard and unaccountable that this Gentleman, who sets up for your Champion, should use the English Nation so familiarly, and take such Liberty, not only of frightning them into an Ague, but to Bully a great Gene∣ral, who was never hitherto known to be daunt∣ed by more formidable Giants, than the Quix∣ots of your Company. He, honest Gentleman, mean'd no Harm at the Granting of the Oct∣roy; for, 'tis to be believed, that he could
scarce hear what was whisper'd to him for the Noise of the Namure Guns. And as for this Project of yours to Darien, I dare be posi∣tive, that he knew nothing of the Matter till it was Five or Six Months done; and then he had it from other Hands.
If your Colony has left Darien for Reasons not as yet publick to the World, 'tis your Fault, Right Worshipful Gentlemen, in underta∣king to manage a Project you so little understood, and not of the English Nation, whose Interest it is to advance and preserve their own Colonies, and to keep them from being render'd desolate by the Clandestine Artisices of yours, who industri∣ously and tacitely spread their Declarations over all the English Islands and Plantations, making use of the King of Great Britain's Name, to give the more Authority to the Thing: And by these indirect Manifesto's, such Prosits, or rather Plunders were insinuated; that if the Govern∣ment of England had not taken early Measures to prevent the ill Consequences, 'tis to be questi∣on'd, whether the greatest Part of the English West-Indies had not e'er now quitted their Set∣tlements, and been decoy'd into your Colony, un∣der a Cover'd Notion, that you had a Patent from the King, to pick a Quarrel with the Spa∣niard; and to devide the Spoil of Mexico and Peru amongst the Servants and Adventures of the Company.

This Project and Settlement, you know, was so secretly carried on, that it was not known to England, till the same Wind that brought the News likewise, inform'd the Nation, that the Scots were march'd over to Panama (the chief City on the Isthmus of Darien, and the Trea∣sury-Chamber of all the Spanish. Riches on the South-Sea) and had planted Eighty Guns a∣gainst it. These Proceedings were enough to startle this Nation, who had heard of no War with Spain, and who had no great Reason to suf∣fer their own Subjects to desert their Plantati∣ons, to advance the Scotch Colony in their own Wrong. As for this Nation's curing into a War with the Spaniard, on the Score of your Company, who besides their Loss of Trade, must throw away more English Pounds (thrice over) than there's Scotch, in your Capital Stock; I'll leave it to any Man of Half an Ounce of Politicks, to find out the Jest on't, save this Hot-headed Author of your Colony's Defence.
As for these ridiculous and bugbear Stories, which both you and your Champion insinuate, viz. that if the Scots should lose, or be ex∣pell'd out of Darien, the French will cer∣tainly possess themselves of it. This Story is so far vain, that the French have another Game to play at present with Spain; and if they had any such Inclination that Way, they know that Coast far better than the Scots,
and might have secur'd Carthagena, when they had it in their Power, and a Legal Title to it by their Arms in the Time of a declar'd War: Which Fortification is as far before your Fort St. Andrew, or any Thing that can be made of it; as Dunkirk is before Deale-Castle. But still, if France or Holland had any such Design (as you would make the World believe) why mayn't they still go sit down with∣in a League of either Side of your Colony with as good a Title as yours, since you will coop the Spaniard up within his Wall'd Towns and Garrisons. But to leave this unnecessary Dispute.—
And proceed to the oblique Threatnings wherewith he frightens King William, to wit, the Fate of those Mean-spirited Princes, who blemish'd, and were unworthy to wear the Im∣perial Crown of your Nation; I'll espouse His Majesty's Cause no further than to be confirm'd, that he has been ill serv'd by some Persons; and I am of Opinion, that he does not merit one Half of this ill Language at their Hands. Further, I dare say so much in his Behalf, by what has past already, that the Scots Crown will receive no Blemish or Disreputation by his wearing of it; altho' he does not think it either sit or just to Countenance an indirect Action of any of his Subjects.

By the Beacons which your Author sets up to scare him, to wit, of the Two Baliols of James the First, and William the First; any Man without the Help of Spectacles may plainly perceive that he sticks at nothing to advance his Cause, either by wresting or perverting the Truth of the History; by reason there can be no Parity in the Example, between the several Cases of these dead Kings, whom he now brings on the Stage, and King William; nor is there any Colour of Allusion to introduce them here for Scare-crows. For the Truth of the Story runs thus: After the Death of Alexander the Third, Ten or a Dozen far-fetched Relations of the Royal Family standing Competitors for the Scots Crown, it was agreed on by the different Parties (to prevent the Effusion of Blood) that the Trial of their several Claims should be re∣ferr'd to Edward the First of England. Ed∣ward accepting the Office came to Berwick, then a Scots Town, where, after a long time spent in canvassing the several Titles, he found Bruce, Baliol, and Cummin stand fairest for it. To make a long Tale short, he now found it in his Power to accomplish that which his Predecessors struggl'd for, for some Hun∣dred Years before, to wit, a Submission of the Scots Crown to that of England. He felt Bruce's Pulse, but it did not beat to his Mind; then he sounded Baliol, who had more English Blood in him by half than Scotch, who easily
condescended to his Terms. Edward declares John Baliol, King of the Scots; and the Scots Nobility having swore Allegiance to him in his Presence, proceeded to his Coronation. That being over, the new Scots King, with his Nobility, came to King Edward, to thank him for his Civility at Newcastle; where ha∣ving been splendidly regaled for some time, and the English King being to set out for London, John Baliol, with his Train of Nobles, came in a full Body to kiss his Royal Fist; where on a suddain, King Baliol claps down on his Knee, and swore Fealty to Edward as his So∣vereign Lord, and to hold the Scots Crown for ever, of him and his Successors, Kings of England. Baliol having ended this Ceremo∣ny, pointed to his Subjects to follow his Ex∣ample; which being needless to dispute on that Ground, no Body stumbl'd at it, save a peevish Old Gentleman, by Name Douglass, who was Caged up for the Remainder of his Life, for want of good Manners. Baliol and his No∣bility march'd home to Scotland, as chearfully as Half a Dozen Citizens Wives return to their Husbands, after they have been decoy'd into a Ramble, and kiss'd by strange Fellows; and they being all alike Scabby, made no Words on't for some Years, and, perhaps, had not then, if a rash Sentence had not been pass'd by Baliol in his own Court, in Prejudice of a certain Thane or Earl; who thinking himself
injur'd, appeal'd to Edward as Sovereign Lord: King Edward being willing to show his Grandeur, summon'd Baliol up to London, and being seated on a Throne in his Court of Judicature, his Fellow King had the Honour to set by him, till such time as the Tryal came on, and then he was oblig'd to step down to the Com∣mon-Bar, and Plead for himself. The Gentle∣man had got so much Scotch Blood in him, by his Three Years Government of that Kingdom, that he stomach'd the Disgrace, and could not tell how to digest it, till he went Home and con∣sulted his Nobility, who were all alike tardy with himself: It was soon agreed on, to bid Ed∣ward Defiance, declaring, That their King and they were only trick'd into their Submission by his foul Artifice. Both Nations Arm'd, but Edward got the Better on't; for having over∣run Scotland, and made them once or twice swear heartily anew; and having caught John Baliol by the Neck, would never afterwards trust him with such an Office; but kept him Prisoner at London for many Years, till at the Intercession of the Pope and French King, his Imprisonment was enlarg'd to France, where he died a Quondam King.
Now, whether this Fate of John Baliol has any Relation to what your Author designs (since 'tis plain, that Edward both made and unmade him, and not the Scots) I refer it back to him∣self
to reconcile. As for the other Baliol, by Name Edward, and Son to this John, he finding that Robert Bruce was the Second time dead, came from France to England; and, there having Edward the Third's Leave to raise what Men he could, to seat himself on his Father's Old Throne, found Voluntiers e∣nough (who were the Relations of those who were foil'd at Bannocksburn) and with those, and a few of King Edward's Ships, he lands in the Heart of Scotland, and set young Da∣vid Bruce's Crown on his own Head, without asking the Scots Leave; and kept it till D∣vid, with the Assistance of his Father-in-Law the French King, took it from him again. Neither can I see the Paralel in this with King William's Case; for Edward Baliol took the Crown at his own Hand nolens volens, where∣as King William had it press'd upon his Head by the unanimous Consent of the Scots Nation. As for the other Two Examples of James, and William the First, what they did while it was their Misfortune to be Prisoners in England, could not stand in Law; neither did I ever hear, that after their Freedom, and Re∣stauration to their Dignities, their Scots Sub∣jects did ever reckon it to them for Sin.
But as there's no great Advantage or Credit to be purchased, by ripping up such old Sores, so I am willing to leave tracing this Gentle∣man's
Evidences, and rather take Things on his own Authority, than foul Paper about it. Mean while, I'll be as impertinent as he is with his Earl of Strafford, and some others, and acquaint you with something that may be nearer the Case. It has been observ'd in Scotland, in the Course of several Ages, that it hath been ever fa∣tal to Families when they became so powerful as to swell beyond their Proportion: Witness that of the Cummins, in Robert Bruce's Reign, the greatest that ever has been in Scotland: Wit∣ness that of the Gouries, of a latter Date: And if I should add that of a latter Family, within the Reach of our Memory, which might have reasonably been reckon'd in the same Class, had it not been for the happy Accident of the Revolution, I cannot be far mistaken. I say, most of these Gentlemen being too great for Sub∣jects, lost themselves with Jearus in their Flight: Some got red-hot Iron Crowns, and o∣thers Halters; but that which was more Tra∣gical, their whole Families and Dependants were hung up like Haddocks to dry in the Sun, that they might never afterwards rise in Judg∣ment. I heartily wish there may no such Ex∣amples happen in our Age; and that no suspect∣ed Persons sit so close to the Machine of your Colony, nor wind up its Spring further than it will go, least it should snap, and the Ingineers get o'er the Fingers End.

Being sensible that I have trespass'd in the Epidemical Crime of my Fellow-Scribblers, by swelling my Dedication beyond its Proportion, and, perhaps, said more than some Persons care to hear; I'll proceed to the Reasons, why the Gentlemen of the Colony have dropt off by de∣grees; praying, that the same may serve, if it be true, that the whole Body has follow'd their Example; as likewise, that you mayn't hang those Two poor innocent Gentlemen, Mr. Mont∣gomry and Mr. Jollie, late Councellors of your Colony, whom you have been pleas'd to find Guilty of a Design, to desert Caledonia, and run away with one of your Frigats. And, al∣tho' I cannot profess my self a Friend to your Project, nor to your Way of Managing of it; yet I declare, that the Prosperity of the Ancient Kingdom, as likewise, that a true Sense of your Mismanagement of that great Octroy, be deep∣ly ingrafted in every Scots Man's Heart, is the hearty Wish, and Prayer of,
