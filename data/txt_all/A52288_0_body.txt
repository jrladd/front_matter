Sir,
IT is my knowledge of you, and your entire Affection to the best Interest, that embold∣ens me to this Presumption of inscribing your Name to the following Discourse, drawn up in hast, Preach'd in much pain, and now at a venture expos'd to the World. Not for any thing of worth in it, but only the suitable∣ness of it to the present dispensation. I confess I might well blush at the apprehension of your Sa∣gacious Eye, were I not secur'd in the sweetness of your Temper; And that you are too great to pass censure on what is so much beneath you, and too well enclin'd to the great work of God, now on the wheel, then Critically to fasten on the weakness of any attempt to display it.

Dear Sir,
I have here a fair opportunity to let the world know, how much stand obliged to you. What a refreshing shade you have been to me, my dis∣consolate Wife, and poor Children▪ but I know your modesty will not bear my running any far∣ther this way, and therefore I shall stop. On∣ly beseeching the God of Recompense, to return all your undeserved kindness treble-fold into your own besome; And you that have given more then a cup of cold Water, to me a poor unworthy Creature, yet to me as a Prophet. Oh may you receive a Prophet's Reward. Thus committing you, your Virtuous Lady, and your hopefull Branches to the Divine Protection of the Holy One, in whom▪ I desire to be esteemed, as I am,
