ANd to whom should
I more fitly cōmend
this pious worke of
the Imitation of
Christ, then to thee
good Christian Reader whosoe∣ver
thou art, and wheresoever
thou dwellest; I say wheresoe∣ver
thou dwellest, for nowa∣daies
it is an hard matter to find
a good Christian: the Prophet
bid them run to & fro, through
the streets of Ierusalem, and
seeke in the broad places there∣of
if they could finde a man, Ier.
5. 1. They were not so much
troubled to find out a man as we

shall be to find out a Christian.
We so busie our selves about
Controversies, that we forget
to be good Christians. There
was a time indeed when the
name was first given at Antioch,
Act. 11. 26. that it was then
well set by; but this lasted not
long, for presently after they
fell a sideing amongst them∣selves,
and one cryed I am of
Paul, another I am of Apollos,
and another I am of Cephas, and
another I am of Christ, and
much adoe had S. Paul 1. Cor.
1. 12. to appease these factions:
for presently after they fell to
them againe, and have so conti∣nued,
yea and encreased in them
even unto this day. But Christ
is not divided, saith the same A∣postle,
neither is this to imitate
Christ the God of love and
peace, who loved us when we

were his enemies; and the A∣postle
makes a good inference of
imitation upon it. 1. Iohn. 4. 11.
Beloved, if God so loved us we
ought also to love one another:
Nay as though there were no∣thing
else required of a good
Christian, and a follower of
Christ, our saviour saith, Ioh. 13.
15. by this shall all men know
you are my disciples, if you have
love one to another. Seeing then
this is the proper and peculiar
badge and cognisance of a dis∣ciple
of Christ to love his fel∣low
disciples, what preface
would be fitter here, then an in∣troduction
to all Christians to be
in peace and charity one with a∣nother.
But alas how unwelcome a
taske is it, to entreat of peace
and charity! For he that goes a∣bout
to part a fray, in all likely∣hood

will have blowes on both
sides, especially where the op∣posites
& combatants are fierce
and violent, he that is eager on
any one side shall be sure to finde
some fast friends, but he that
bewaileth the miserable distra∣ction
of the whole, and doth but
set a foote forward to make up
the breach, will finde few to
take his part, but shall be sure to
have many about his eares: And
therefore we may observe that
presently after our Saviour had
said, Blessed are the peace-ma∣kers,
Mat. 5. 9. 10. he immedi∣atly
addeth, Blessed are they that
are persecuted for righteousnesse
sake: knowing well enough that
if a man will undertake to be a
peacemaker, he must presently
prepare to suffer persecution,
and I know none greater then
that of peace-makers in religion

for they suffer on all sides, either
by sharpe and bitter words, or
by scoffing & jeering speeches.
For although the hot-spurres of
these times be at deadly fewde
and bitter enmity one with ano∣ther,
yet will they like Herod
and Pilate, joyne together and
muster up their forces against
those who labour any kind of
pacification and desire to be qui∣et
in the land. Wee is me (saith
David Ps. 120. 4. 5 6. that I am
constrained to dwell with Me∣sech,
and to have mine habitation
amongst the tents Kedar: my
soule hath long dwelt among
them, that be enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace but whn I speak
unto them thereof, they make
them ready to Battell. Never
could the pious and peaceable
Christian more truly cry out
then now, My mothers Chil∣dren

were angry with me. Cant.
1. 5. A strange speech to call
them Mothers children: had it
not been a more easy & familiar
way to say my Brethren or my
Sisters were angry with me (for
so they must be, if they were
her Mothers Children) why
then doth she make such an in∣volved
speech of it, My mothers
children were angry with me.
True indeed though they can∣not
choose but be her brethren,
(as being her Mothers children)
yet she doth not, she dares not
call them brethren, for they
will not acknowledge it, they
hate the name of brethren, and
make themselves professed ene∣mies,
and therefore she is for∣ced
to leave out this loving and
affectionate compellation of
brethren, and say in a kinde of
strange phrase, My mothers chil∣dren

were angry with me. Yet
should no man be discouraged,
from performing so worthy a
duty, for though there be a per∣ecution
that attends upō peace∣makers
here, yet is there a bles∣sing
promised them hereafter.
And seeing our blessed Lord and
Master Christ Iesus, when he
was about to leave his Apostles
and Disciples, he left unto them
this golden legacy: Ioh. 14. 27.
Peace I leave with you, my peace
I give unto you, O how well
would it become us his Priests
to be men of peace, to write for
the peace of Ierusalem, to pray
for the peace of Ierusalem, for
they shall prosper that love it.
Psal. 122. 6.
I will begin this exhortation
unto peace and Charity, from
that common name which we
all beare in that we are called

Christians, and doe all pretend
to imitate Christ in our doctrine
and practice. There was a time
indeed when this name was
much taken notice of and great
danger for any man to owne it,
when they had no other argu∣ment
then, nor any other cause
of their cruell persecutions, but
to heare a man confesse Christi∣anus
sum, I am a Christian: But
when these stormes were
blown over, and the Church be∣gan
to be in peace, this name
of Christian was not so much re∣garded.
And yet methinks the
very name of Christian is not al∣together
to be contemned, for,
unlesse I am deceived whosoe∣ver
hath but this appellation
may challenge a brotherhood
with me, for in Scripture I find
a brother and a Christian to be
the very same, so that whosoe∣ver

is a Christian will necessari∣ly
be my brother. 1. Cor. 7. 12.
13. If any brother hath a wife,
saith the Apostle, that believeth
not, and she be pleased to dwell
with him, let him not put her a∣way;
and if the woman hath an
husband which believeth not, if
he be pleased to dwell with her, let
her not leave him: But if the un∣believing
depart let him depart,
a brother or a sister is not in bon∣dage
in such cases. Where the
Apostle plainly sheweth that a
brother and a sister are such as
are Christians and opposite only
to Infidels and unbelievers. Nei∣ther
ought we to take that ex∣hortation
of Saint Paul 1. Pet. 2.
17. when he saith love the bro∣therhood,
in any narrower sense,
but that we should love every
one that is a Christian, not only
because he agreeth with me in

some opinions concerning reli∣gion,
but I ought to love him in
that respect he is a Christian,
and professeth Christ crucified.
Neither ought we to love him
thus with an ordinary kinde of
love, in wishing him well and
doing him good, for so we ought
to love and doe good to all, but
there is a more strict tie of love
that lies upon us Christians one
to another; and therefore al∣though
the Apostle wisheth us
to doe good to all men, yet especi∣ally
to the houshold of faith, Gal.
6, 10. that is, to such as be Chri∣stians.
Were this precept of the A∣postle
practised as it ought to be,
there would not be so much un∣charitablenesse,
nor peradven∣ture
so much dissention amongst
Christians. Why can wee not
consider one another as united

in this blessed name of Christiā,
and set aside for a time those
names of faction and division
why should wee not rejoyce a∣while
in those things wherein
we agree, and not alwaies be
wrangling about those things
wherein wee differ? Of what
moment those opinions are
wherein we disagree I am not
able to determine; this I dare
be bold to say, that the points
wherein we are friends are of
farre greater consequence, then
those are wherein wee fall out.
And yet we so eagerly contend
one with another, and damne
each other to the pit of hell, as
though our differences were ve∣ry
important, & our agreement
not worth the talking of. For
my part I should be loath to ex∣clude
any visible Christian
Church from all hopes of salva∣tion,

and if I must needs offend,
I had rather give account to a
mercifull God for too much
mildnesse and Charity, then too
much fiercenesse and severity:
yet I hope to make it appeare
that my opinion of Charity shall
not exceed the bounds of verity.
A chiefe cause of the conti∣nuance
of these dissentions is,
that men minde not so much the
common cause of Christianity,
as their own particular engage∣ments,
nor stndy how they may
agree one with another, as how
to uphold the side they are on:
whereas would they set aside
prejudice and partiality and cast
an equall eye upon all the Chur∣ches,
they would not spye so
many faults abroad, and so few
at home, but would freely con∣fesse
there might bee greater
concord amongst Christians then

now there is. No other unity
doe I labour for at this time but
that of charity, that Christians
would not for some differences
in opinion, pronounce such an
heavy sentence upon one ano∣ther,
as is that of Damnation. If
God should deale with us as we
deale with one another, if he
should censure us all, as we cen∣sure
one another, I know not
who should be saved: The Pa∣pist
damning the Protestant, and
some among us the Papists, and
both of them any other that shall
differ from them both. But my
hope is, and my hearty prayer
to God shall be, that he would
be more mercifull to all these
then they are one to another.
When I consider with my selfe
the manifold distractiōs of Chri∣stians
about Religion, and the
great fiercenes and violence u∣sed

on all sides, every one think∣ing
his own opinion truest, and
consequently damning all others
that differ from him, I could
not but call to minde that pro∣phecy
of our blessed Saviour
Mat. 24. 12. concerning these
latter and worser times, Because
iniquity shall abound (saith he)
the love of many shall waxe cold:
for although charity of it selfe
be of a hot and diffusive nature,
yet now clean contrary to the
nature of it, it is in most men
grown cold; it being the nature
of cold to contract and combine
to congeale and draw into a nar∣row
roome; thus is it now with
our charity. For whereas like
the heat in our naturall bodies,
it should diffuse it selfe into all
the members thereof, unto the
whole Christian Church, yet I
know not how it hath, taken

cold, for men contract their
love now into a very small
compasse and narrow roome,
that is, to no more then to such
who jumpe with them in the
same opinion about Religion,
leaving others who differ from
them, to nothing but death and
damnation. For not only in se∣verall
countries but in the same
Kingdome, in the same City,
nay in the same family there are
severall Religions, or at the least
severall opinions about Religi∣on
raigning: So that what Saint
Austine complained of in his
time is truly verified in these,
Epist. 147. Thou seest (saith he)
with how great and miserable di∣straction
Christian houses and
families are divided & troubled;
husbands and wives can agree
well enough to goe to bed toge∣ther,
but they cannot agree to goe

to Christs Altar together: There
they sweare peace one to another,
but here they can have no peace.
Parents and children live well e∣nough
together in one house of
their own, but one house of Gods
will not hold them both. Their
desire is that those should succeed
them in their own inheritance,
who yet think they have no inhe∣ritance
with Christ. Masters &
servants divide the cōmon Lord
and Master of us all, who yet took
upon him the forme of a servant,
that so he might free all: I say
never more fully verified then
in these daies; For in how many
families shall we observe this
great division, the husband goes
to Church and the wife staies
at home, or the wife goes to
Church and the husband staies
at home, and so between pa∣rents
and children, Masters and

servants. The father will give
his sonne the portion of his
land, who yet thinks he shall
have no portion in the land of
the living.
The great division of the
Christian world, was first be∣tween
the East and West Chur∣ches,
and this West hath been
since subdivided into the Romā
and the reformed Religion: So
that the division amongst Chri∣stians
which is considerable is
but into three parts, the Eastern,
the Romanist, & our Reformed.
All Christian Churches, and so
farre forth the members of
them brethren and sisters; and
not only Christian Churches,
but also Catholike & Orthodoxe
in these points wherein they a∣gree
one with another, & with
the Primitive Church. Why
may it not be with these Chur∣ches

as it was with those seven
Churches of Asia which S. Iohn
wrote unto, in which there
were some things commenda∣ble,
& other things amisse? they
were encouraged in the former
and reproved for the latter.
And although some of them
were better then others, yet
you shall scarce finde one of
them to which he doth not say,
habeo adversus to pauca, I have a
few things against thee: And yet
we shall finde that Christ him∣self
was in the midst of all these
seaven Churches, for he was in
the midst of the seaven golden
candlesticks, Revel. 1. 13. and
had in his right hand seaven
starres. Revel. 1. 16. For writing
to the Church of Ephesus, he
maketh this one of his attri∣butes:
Apoc. 21. These things
(saith he) who holdeth the seaven

starres in his right hand, who
walketh in the midst of the sea∣ven
golden Candlesticks. So that
our Saviour walked in the midst
of all these Churches, even in
that lukewarme Church of Lao∣dicea,
which he threatned to
spue out of his mouth. And let
Rome tell us never so much of
her infallibility and unerring
chaire, yet questionlesse there is
none of our Churches, no not the
best of them, that our Saviour
may not say to her, habeo adver∣sus
to pauca, I have a few things
against thee. And as those seve∣rall
Churches, though some of
them very faulty, yet were all
severall members of Christ, and
helped to make up one body: so
all those Churches, though some
of them much to blame, yet may
all help to make up one Chatho∣lique
Church: and why may it

not be so in these. Churches I
speak of? For first they all agree
in that one and only foundation
of Religion, Iesus Christ as the
Apostle calleth him, No other
foundation can any other man lay,
then that which is laid, to wit Ie∣sus
Christ, and this no doubt is a
sure and good foundation, and
this maketh them to be Christi∣an
Churches, they are all bapti∣zed
into Christ, and looke to be
saved by his sufferings: And
think not this to be a small mat∣ter;
for S. Paul desired to know
nothing else, I esteemed not (saith
he) to know any thing among you
but Iesus Christ, and him cruci∣fied,
and it worked upon his af∣fection
as much as upon his un∣derstanding.
God forbid that I
should rejoyce (saith he) save in
the crosse of our Lord Iesus
Christ, Gal. 6. 14. that is in Christ

crucified. Besides this one foun∣dation,
they all embrace the
two Testaments, the three
Creeds, and the foure first gene∣rall
Councells, and many other
very materiall points. The
discord amongst us Christians
hath been long agoe objected
to us; and certainely there
hath nothing so much drawn
some out of the Church, and
kept others from comming
to the Church, as these quarrels
amongst our selves; Vnto whom
I briefly answere: If they like
not our differences, let them
joyne with us in those things
wherein we agree, and that is
to be Christians, to beleeve in
Christ and him crucified, and
those other principall points
whereof I speak, and to strive to
imitate Christ to their power,
and then our discords will lesse

trouble them. It is true, we have
not all built alike upon this
foundation, but some no questi∣on
have built wood and straw,
as well as silver and gold; yet
all of us no doubt did strive to
imitate Christ as neare as we
could, both in our doctrine and
in our practice: and certainly
in these superstructures of reli∣gion,
good intentions must goe
farre, or else it will goe hard
with many of us; not that they
altogether excuse the fault, but
doubtlesse they take off much
from the punishment. There is
a difference between the East
and west Churches, in what
kinde of bread the Eucha∣rist
is to be receaved; th
East receiving in unleavene
bread, the west in leavened. And
herein though they differ a∣mong
themselves, yet the

both strive to imitate Christ, be∣cause
the one Church thought
our Saviour used then the bread
that was leavened, the other,
that which was unleavened.
Either Church is the lesse
blameable because they think
both that they follow our Savi∣ours
example.
S. Austin in like manner doth
prettily reconcile a difference
between some concerning the
time how often we should re∣ceave
the holy Sacrament of the
Lords supper; for some it
seemes in his time thought we
were bound to receave the Eu∣charist
every day, others but
now and then. Some (saith he
Epist. 118.) communicate daily,
others but upon certain daies,
some will omit no day, others will
only receive on the Sabbath, and
the Lords day. There is a free∣dome

to be used in both these:
Some will say we must not daily
receive the Sacrament, because
we ought to select and set apart
some daies wherein we must live
more carefully and religiously, and
so come to the Sacrament more
worthily and with greater devo∣tion:
On the other side, another
tells us, yea but if the plague-sore
of sinne and violence of the disease
be so great and dangerous, such
soveraigne medicines as these are
not to be deferred. Of both these
saith he let every man take his
choice, and doe that which he
thinks in his conscience he may
best and most piously performe;
for neither of these dishonour the
body and blood of our Saviour,
but rather both of them doe strive
to honour this saving Sacrament.
For Zacheus rejoyced greatly to
entertaine our Saviour in his

house. The Centurion said, Lord
I am not worthy thou shouldest
come under my roofe; both of these
did worship and honour our Savi∣our,
though after a diverse, and
as it were a contrary manner, both
of them being miserable by rea∣son
of sinne, both of them obtain∣ing
mercy for their sinnes. Thus
one man to honour Christ dares
not receive every day, another al∣so
to honour Christ dares not o∣mit
any day. And although these
be but petty differences, yet
why may I not apply it to con∣troversies
of greater moment,
especially seeing that ancient
Father S. Salvian lib. 5. de Pro∣videntia,
hath found a good in∣tention
in the Arians the most
pernitious and most dangerous
hereticks accounted that ever
have been in the Church▪ They
whom we account hereticks (saith

he) account not themselves here∣ticks,
for they so much esteeme
themselves good Catholikes, that
they defame us with the note and
appellation of heresy. That there∣fore
which they be to us, the very
same are we to them. We are cer∣taine
that they injure the divine
generation in that they say the
Sonne is lesse and inferior to the
Father: They think us likewise
injurious to the Father, because
we make the Sonne equall unto
him. The true honour of God is
amongst us, but they think that
to be the honour of the Deity, to
believe as they believe. They are
undutifull but they think it the
greatest duty of their Religion:
They are impious but they think
this to be true piety. They erre
therefore, but they erre with a ve∣ry
good minde and intention, not
with a hatred, but with a good

affection towards God, verily be∣lieving
that they honour and love
God. Although they have not the
right Faith, yet they notwith∣standing
think this to be perfect
love towards God. In what man∣ner
they shall bee punished in the
day of Iudgement for this very
error of false opinion, no man can
tell but the judge himselfe.
A good lesson for the hot∣purres
of these times, with
whom it is a very easy matter
to pronounce damnation upon
the very least disagreement in
Religion, whereas this good Fa∣ther
would not determine any
thing concerning these great he∣reticks
the Arians, but leaves
them to the mercy of the judge,
not being able to discerne what
they did deserve. You see that
this holy Father findes out a
good intention even in these

hereticks. And if there was a
good intention amongst those
that were so grossely erroneous,
why may there not be good in∣tentions
found out amongst us
also, who are not at such great
oddes, and acknowledged on all
sides to have no such dangerous
opinions amongst us.
I speak not this any whit to
countenance that opinion of the
Arians, which is creeping into
the Church againe, but leave
them to stand or fall to their
own master, and shall in the
mean time be perswaded that
they goe not against their con∣sciences,
and so farre forth hit will
goe better with them: yet with
this holy Father, not free them
from punishment, but must re∣ferre
the manner and measure
thereof to the time of judge∣ment.

Those of the Church of
Rome are so impatient of this
doctrine, that they care not for
being saved unlesse they may be
saved alone; And their writers
generally agree upon nothing
so much, as that out of their
Communion there is no Salvati∣on.
One of their late writers,
(Barckly Paren. l. 1. cap. 1) can
professe thus, We (saith he) pro∣claime
with the whole Church,
and we command with Moses
that Heaven and Earth would
heare us, that there is no commu∣nion
between God and Belia, &
that these Protestants doe so far
differ from us in matters of faith,
that they altogether in vaine ex∣pect
those mansions of happinesse
which are prepared for us. And
afterwards he saith, Hee that
dares believe a stubborne and ob∣stinate
Protestant can be saved,

doth by so believing fall from the
Catholike Faith. And that this
is no private or obscure sentence
of the Church, but that all Ca∣tholicks
are of the same mind, that
none of them are ignorant of it,
nor any can dissemble it, unlesse
he be an unexpert Divine, or for
feare or ambition preferres some
mens favour before the truth.
Another of your company
Camp. rat. 10. averres the same,
with a very great and solemne
protestation, I call to witnesse
(saith hee) Gods Throne, and
that tribunall at which I shall
sand to give an accompt of these
my reasons, and of whatsoever I
have spoken or done, that either
there is no heaven at all, or that
it peculiarly and properly belongs
unto us.
I Campian, must yee be sa∣ved,
and none but yee? what is

not heaven able to hold us as
well as you? Or will our salva∣tion
be any disparagement to
yours? It seemes it will. But
to come a litle closer to you: Is
it nothing with you at one
breath, to throw so many soules
headlong to hell, for whom
Christ died; and which is more
who are already incorporate in∣to
Christ by Baptisme? It cost
more to redeeme their soules;
but you will let that alone for
ever. Our comfort is that though
you passe such sentence upon us
here, yet you are not to be our
Iudges hereafter, but must your
selves come to give an account
as well as we, & peradvēture of
these speeches. Account us not
men of so desperate and deplo∣red
an estate that wee would
wittingly and willingly runne
into hell▪ why should not out

salvation be as deere unto us, as
yours is unto you? or why should
you not think us to have as great
a care of our salvation, as you
have of yours? For could wee
be perswaded that wee were
in heresie, and that there is no
salvation out of your Church,
how quickly would we fly unto
you? How gladly would we be
entertained by you? what means
and moans would we make to
be members of your society?
Who can endure such peremp∣tory
pronunciations of Iudg∣ment,
of God's eternal wrath
and condemnation upon us, be∣fore
wee come to our hearing?
And seeing, God's mercy is over∣all
his workes, who can endure
that you should interdict God's
mercy, and judge what the sen∣tence
of the Iudge shall be, be∣fore
the day of iudgment. Lib. 1.

advers. Pelag. So that if God
had a mind to spare such sinners
(as you say we poore Protestants
are) yet by your verdict and pre∣scription
he could not be suffered
to doe it as S. Ierome long agoe
complained of Critobulus the Pe∣lagian.
Were we such tares in
the field of the Church, as you
would make the world be∣lieve,
yet if you would imi∣tate
Christ, Mat. 13. you should
let us grow till the harvest,
lest you plucke up the good
corne with us.
Neither are you thus fierce
alone, there are some of our own
side, to requite you in your
owne kind, are as confident that
you cannot be saved, as you are
that we cannot; so that the
Question now is, In which of
our two Churches salvation is
to be had? For taking for gran∣ted

that wee have excluded all
others, and got heaven between
us, we cannot be content to
share it, but we must confine and
ingrosse it to one of our Chur∣ches,
as though it could not be
had in both, nay as though it
could not be had out of both; for
I am verily perswaded, and
dare undertake to make it good,
that those poore Easterne Chri∣stians,
who differ from us both,
will yet come to heaven assoon
as either of us: which were it
well considered might be a
good means to pacifie this Que∣stion,
and to abate the heate of
many moe betweene us.
But this monopolizing of
Christ, although it be generally
entertain'd by the Romane Par∣tie,
yet are not all our reformed
Divines so straite lac't, but ma∣ny
of them, and those of no

small note can be content that
others should be saved with
them, and therefore they are
called by you, by way of derisi∣on
(Preface to Charity mista∣ken)
good fellow Christians. As
though they had so much of the
good fellow in them, that they
have too little of the good Christi∣an.
And indeed you have most
reason to be angry with these
good fellow Christians, for they
are like to doe you all the mis∣chiefe,
for having found that
there may be salvation in our
Church as well, yea, with more
ease then in yours, we shall ne∣ver
be thinking of going any
further. As for those who are
so eager, `that will confine salva∣tion
to one certaine Church, you
have some hope of them, that in
time they may come over to
you: And what you object to us

as a crime, wee esteeme as our
great glory, and account it one
of God's speciall blessings that
wee live in the bosome of a
Church that is so charitable, and
we are willing to have so much
of the good fellow in us, because
we would not have too litle of
the good Christian: for though
our Creed be compris'd in a nar∣row
roome, yet our charity ex∣tends
farre, not only to you, but
the Easterne Church.
We have a litle Sister, and shee
hath no breasts, what shall we doe
for our Sister, in the day when she
shall be spoken of? We have a litle
Sister. Cant. 8. 8. Though the
Church of Rome call the
Church of Greece Hereticall
and Schismaticall▪, yet we of
the Church of England, esteeme
her to be a Daughter of the Ca∣tholique
Church, and our Sister,

though now she be litle, yet she
was a great one, not inferiour a∣ny
waies to the Church of
Rome, she brought forth many
children, and gave milk plenti∣fully;
but now alas she is litle by
reason of her long persecution,
and her breasts dried up, for
now she is in a manner barren
and able to bring forth but few
children. And although Shee be
in this poore and desolate estate,
yet the Church of Rome will
doe nothing for her, for when at
the Councell of Florence shee
desired aide of them against the
Turkes, they gave her no suc∣cour
at all, but left her in misery
here, and adiudged her as they
doe us to death and damnation
hereafter. What shall we doe for
our Sister? so long as we acknow∣ledge
her for our Sister, wee
should be willing to doe some∣thing

for her in the day when she
shall be spoken of; for as yet no
body speakes for her, no body
laments her, but lets her alone,
as if she deserved no pity, no
succour, no commiseration, the
Romanists have perswaded so
many that she is schismaticall
and hereticall in her tenents.
But all those who esteeme of
her as a sister, I hope will doe
some thing for her in the day
when she shall be spoken for,
when her cause shall be plea∣ded,
and she cleared from hol∣ding
such dangerous and dam∣nable
Doctrines, then certainly
she will have many to pity her,
many to helpe her.
But the confining of salvati∣to
your owne Partie, hath not
only sharpened the pens of ma∣ny
Writers to much bitternesse
and condemning one another,

but also hath unsheathed the
swords of many Princes and
Potentates to the great and la∣mentable
effussion of much
Christian blood. S. Paul thought
it a strange thing in his time for
a brother to goe to law with a
brother: I speake to your shame
(saith he). Is it so that there is not
a wise man amongst you, no not
one that is able to judge betweene
his brethren, but brother goeth to
law with brother, and that under
the Infidels? 1. Cor. 6. 5. 6. What
if S. Paul lived in these daies,
wherein not only a brother go∣eth
to law with a brother, but a
brother goeth to warre with a
brother, yea, and which is more,
maketh that to be a motive un∣to
his warre, to wit, Religion,
which should be a forcible
meanes of peace and reconcile∣ment:
Tantum religio potuit sua∣dere

malorum? Is it possible that
Religion should ever be the
true mother of so much mis∣chiefe?
No, no, ou true mother
the holy Catholike Church doth
not further such designes, but la∣ment
them, and doth more just∣ly
complaine then Rebecca did
when twinnes strove in her
wombe, seeing it is so, why am I
thus. For shee could be content
would her children but strive,
and struggle one with another,
but when they come to blowes
and blood, yea much effussion of
blood, as we see at this day, how
can she be but like Rahel wee∣ping
for her children and not be
comforted because they are not?
Mat. 1 18. When was that e∣ver
more truly fulfilled then
now, they that kill you shall think
they doe God good service! Ioh.
16. 2. Doe you not think you

have done God good service in
those many massacres in France,
in every of which how many
thousands of poore Christians
have you swept away with such
a suddaine destruction, that had
they been willing, you gave
them not so much time as to re∣pent
them of their Protestancy?
Doe you not think that you had
done God good service, if that
horrible designe of the Gun∣powder-Treason
had taken ef∣fect,
a prodigie not to be spoken
of without horrour and amaze∣ment,
void of all humanity as
well as Christianity. But doe
what you can, call us Heretiques
Schismatiques, and what other
disgracefull name you can in∣vent,
imprison us, banish us,
strangle us, stifle us, burne us,
hang us, wee are yet your bre∣thren.
Certainly had our Savi-intended

to begin or propogate
his Church by this meanes, hee
could as easily have sent forth
mighty men of warre to com∣pell
others to believe in him, as
poore fishermen who catch
none but such as come to net,
or are fairly allured to lay hold
on the bait. If this open hostili∣ty
were used against the Turks,
the common enemy of the Chri∣stian
name, there were some
pretence for it; and therefore
we read that Moses, Exod. 2.
when he saw the Israelite and
the Egyptian fight, he did not
say, why strive you, but drew his
sword, and slew the Egyptian,
but when he saw the two Israe∣lites
fight, he said, yee are bre∣thren
why strive yee. What a glo∣rious
sight would it be to see
the red Crosle once againe ad∣vanced
as it was in the daies of

Constantine? and if wee did not
see it written in heaven, I hope
wee should finde it true upon
earth, in hoc signo vinces. Vnto
this holy warre I suppose all
they would come, who have
promised to fight under Christ's
banner. And set aside for a while
this private interest of Prote∣stant,
and Papist, and Grecian,
and Lutheran, and Calvinist, and
Arminian, and Socinian, and if
there be any other division a∣mongst
us, and take upon us that
generall livery of Christianity,
and so joyne together to rescue
our brethren from that wilde
Boare of the Forrest which hath
laid wast this goodly vine; & af∣terwards
we might see how we
could decide the Controversies
amongst Christians: For whosoe∣uer
is in the right, I hope wee
are all well enough perswaded

that he is in the wrong. Could
Herod and Pilate, otherwise
deadly enemies be made
friends, and agree together to
condemne Christ, and shall not
those, who are already brethren
and therefore should be friends,
combine together to save
Christ: I say to save Christ, for
so long as we save and preserve
his members, we save and pre∣serve
him; but so long as we suf∣fer
his members to be thus per∣secuted
and oppressed, hee can∣not
choose but suffer with them:
But wee in steed of bandying a∣gainst
the common enemy, mu∣ster
up our forces one against ano¦ther,
and find that to be true by
lamentable experience, there is
no greater hatred then of bre∣thren
that are falllen out.
Seeing then that all Christi∣ans
are brethren, I say brethren,

as having one Father of us all,
brethren as having one faith, one
Lord, one Baptisme, whereby
we are borne into the Catholike
Church, and one food by the Sa∣crament
of the Eucharist, which
makes us groane to be perfect
men in Christ; seeing we are all
these waies brethren, I may
well say as Moses did, yee are
brethren why strive yee? or if yee
must needs be striving about
matters of Religion, strive and
strive earnestly for the faith
which was once delivered to the
Saints.
And because I say we are
brethren I would not have you
think we like not the cause we
have in hand, or that we are rea∣dy
to yeeld unto you, and pre∣sently
joyne hands with you, as
some of you imagine, and many
of our side causelesly suspect, but

this is all, we would have the
breach no greater then it is, and
would not have the world be∣lieve,
because we differ in some
things, that wee agree in no∣thing.
And although we call
you brethren, wee will not
winke at your faults, or joyne
with you in them, but this doth
put us in minde to admonish
you more gently of them as bre∣thren,
though you rage never so
fiercely against us, for by this
meanes wee shall expresse our
charity towards you, and so heap
coles of fire upō your head. God
he knowes we are farre enough
from yeelding to you as Roma∣nists,
yet should we not be cha∣ritable
to you as Christians, we
were much to blame. But ee
how you mistake, or rather in∣deed
pervert and abuse this our
charity: For (say you) by your

own acknowledgement, there may
be salvation in our Church, but
we all deny there can be salvation
in yours, therefore all if they had
care of themselves would have
recourse to us, for it is the safer
way to be a member of that
Church where both sides yeeld
there may be salvation, then in
that where one side denies it. This
were something if Salvation or
Damnation depended upon opi∣nion,
but I suppose that charita∣ble
opinion of ours in hopeing
you may be saved, makes you
never a whit the nearer heaven,
but our selves, and that rough
censure of yours in setting us all
out for damnation, makes us no
whit the neerer hell but your
selves. And I had rather be a
member of that Church which
holds there may be salvation in
both, then of that which holds

there can be salvation but in
one. For holding with the first
I am safe wheresoever I am, but
holding with the latter, I must
be in danger wheresoever I am.
I say wheresoever I am; for I
am not only in danger of my sal∣vation,
if I be in that Church
wherein I think there is no sal∣vation,
but also in that out of
which I think there can be no
salvation, because I confine sal∣vation
to one of these, which
though I think it be in this a∣lone,
yet it may be in the other
alone.
Many other motives unto
charity might be shewed, but
these briefly shall suffice for me,
The one is, that we are Christi∣ans,
and therefore brethren, and
so ought to love as brethren; A∣nother
is, in that I hope our in∣tentions
are good, and that none

maintaines a false opinion per∣versely
against his conscience▪
and this last is, that for some opi∣nions
that are not so orthodoxe
yet there may be hopes of salva∣tion,
although it be not without
smart and punishment.
Now let me say unto all
Christians, as S. Paul doth to the
Corinthians 2. Cor. 6. 11. 12. 13.
O yee Christians, our mouth is o∣pen
unto you, and not only so, but
our heart is enlarged, not only to
the Roman, but even to the East
Church, and to as many as call
upon the name of our Lord Ie∣sus.
Ye are not straitned in us, but
ye are straitned in your own bow∣els,
now for a recompence in the
same, I speak unto you as unto
Brethren, be ye also enlarged.
Let me bespeak all learned
Prelats and Pastors on all sides, as
S. Austine Epist. 147. doth Pro∣culianus

a Bishop and a favourer
of the Donatists, I pray and be∣seech
thee (saith he) if there be
any good disposition in thee, which
many doe extoll, and commend, if
it be not a counterfeit courtesy by
reason of worldly honour, that
the tender bowells of pitty and
compassion begin to yerne in thee,
and that you would have these
controversies discussed between
us at the length, not by wrangling
and railing one at another, but by
fervent prayers and earnest sup∣plications
unto Almighty God,
and by comparing all things
peaceably and examining them in
the spirit of meeknesse, lest the
poore ignorant people which now
yeeld to and willingly obey our
jurisdiction and command over
them, presse us with this their sub∣mission
and dutifull obedience to
us in the day of the Lord Iesus,

and say, they did as their leaders
directed them, but rather by our
unfained love and charity, being
together with us drawn from
those by paths of errour and dis∣sention,
they should be directed
into the right way of truth and
peace. I will conclude all with
our Churches prayer, that it
would please God to inspire con∣tinually
the Vniversall Church,
with the spirit of truth, unity and
concord, and grant that all they
who doe confesse his holy name,
may agree in the truth of his holy
word, and live in unity and God∣ly
love! And although we can∣not
at the first attaine to that
perfection to be of one minde,
yet let us beginne to be chari∣table,
and beare with one ano∣ther;
for who knowes but that
by entertaining this bond of
peace, we may in good time

come to the unity of the spirit;
which he heartily wisheth, and
daily prayeth for, who is
