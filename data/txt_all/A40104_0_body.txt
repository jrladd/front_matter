MY LORD,
THE remembrance of having read, that a Great Emperor was once graciou∣sly pleased to accept of an Apple from the hand of a poor Peasant, hath en∣couraged me to the presenting of the ensuing Discourse unto your Highnesse.
As that Prince was (doubtless) induced to daign the reception of so slight a Gift from  mean a Giver, not for any merit either in the Person or Present, but by the conjecture he made of the dutifull affection wherwith it was Offered; so, I am willing to hope that, the boldness of this address may be the more ex∣cusable, in regard, the like affectionate duty is, in the most of submissiveness, herewith tendred.
Your Highness hath moreover (I humbly con∣ceive) a Peculiar right hereunto, as being the sole adae∣quate Paralell to the famous Princes of the Gustavian Line, mentioned in the following Narrative; for if they were great in Armes, which none can deny, and that their Heroick Actions have rendred their Memories renowned to Perpetuity; Your Highness Name is certainly engraven in Characters indeleble upon the never decaying Pillars of immortall Fame, whose Trumpet hath sounded your more then Ad∣mirable

Successes, unto the most Remote Regions: Nor, is Caesar's Veni, Vidi, Vici, lesse illustrated by your Highnesse Pourtraict than it was by his Statua.
As Victory did constantly accompany the Second and great Gustavus whilest living, and attend him even in death, contrary to that observation of the famous Marquesse of Malvezzi, That the death of valiant Leaders is the losse of Battells; So, it is truely affirmed, that whensoever your Highness hath led on your Forces, your Foes have as often fallen before you, and the most Numerous Enemies that have ever hitherto dared to look you in the Face, have been al∣waies constrained to turn their backs: Neither can the most black-mouthed Detraction gaine-say this Truth.
Your Highnesse hath one Advantage more, which was not by Providence permitted unto that Great Monarch; in that by the Protection of the All-migh∣ty, you live to reap the Fruit of your Labours, in Praising the God of your Salvation.
May your Highnesse, Religiously and Magnani∣mously, still goe on to doe worthily in this our Judah, and to be famous in our Israel; and after a continued Series of Glorious Tryumphs here below, remain Try∣umphantly Glorious above in the Mansions of Eternity.
