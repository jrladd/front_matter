WHereas not long since great Endeavours had been used to render the Militia of this Kingdom useless; and an Account, of the Annual Charge every Coun∣ty was lyable to by the Acts of Parliament, was de∣manded, in order to the
keeping on Foot so many (more) Forces in con∣stant Pay, as the said Expence would have de∣frayed. To the end there∣fore the said Militia may not seem so useless, this Method is compiled; in the doing whereof no new thing is offered, but only a placing of such Authori∣ties and Directions, as are contained in the seve∣ral Acts, under respective Heads, for the more ready charging of Estates, and
putting the whole in Ex∣ecution, at such Times and Places as there may be Occasion, to charge E∣states, impose Penalties, hear Complaints, qualifie Persons, and Train or Ex∣ercise, when the Acts of Parliament, at large, may not be at hand; which is all that is designed by the publishing this Abstract. And it is presumed, that none will be Offended at the Annexing an Exercise of
Arms, which may be use∣full, and be practised by the Trained Bands, with∣out Offence to the Royal Army.
