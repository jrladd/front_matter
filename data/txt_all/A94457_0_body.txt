Humbly shewing
THat whereas we are informed, that a Petition, toge∣ther with a Remonstrance, hath in the Name of this County, beene heretofore presented to this Honou∣rable House, for the abolishing of Episcopacie, and other alte∣rations in Church-Government.
We doe humbly crave leave to certifie your Ho∣nours, that the same was done without our know∣ledge, or consent, and that we doe hereby dis-avow the same. And with the like humility, doe desire That the long established Government of the Church may still continue, and that the abuses and errors of some particular persons, may not cause the alteration of the ancient Government; but rather, that such persons should suffer according to their Demerits. And we likewise humbly crave, the Booke of Com∣mon-Prayer, by Law established, may continue in force, with such alteration (if there be cause) as to your Honours Wisdomes shall seeme meet.
And as in Duty bound, We shall dayly pray, &c.
