THough some (right Honorable) haue with no smal industry & study set forth bookes & pamphlets most false, yea and ridi∣culous, for the seducing of the simple, & hurt of many, & also though diuers do daily pub∣lish fond & fantastical bookes, neither tēding to the publike profit, nor common commodity of any, but only to feede the foolish fancies of fond heads: yet I, as Christian charitie com∣mandeth, & as one that detesteth such wic∣ked & erronious writing, and vaine and vn∣profitable inditing, haue now in this perillous time, when no good admonition wil be accep∣ted, neither any godly thing practised, of very zeale, set forth a dreadfull dreame of the di∣uell & Diues, to terrifie the wicked, to feare the faithlesse, and to stay the Atheistes and the sinfull worldlings from going to hell, fea∣ring that many are so diuellishly bent & re∣gard God so little, that they will not be the better for it, but weigh it rather as a false & foolish dreame, (who if there be any such as I feare there be too many) wil wish they had ta∣ken

warning therby, if they come once in hel, and though the booke seeme little and light, yet the matter therein contained is of great importance & weight, if our euerlasting sal∣uation and damnation, and the losing of the kingdome of heauen and the winning of the dungeon of hell, may be so counted: a more curious worke and cunningly contriued I might haue penned, but a more necessarie booke I could not haue published: and as the same is most worthy to be marked and regar∣ded, euen so I thought meete to dedicate it to your honour being a zealous and worthy per∣sonage, trusting your Lordship will not onelie pardon my boldnes herein (though I so sim∣ple a person and vnknowne of your honour, haue so rashly presumed:) but also that you will respect the gift, not the Giuer: the mea∣ning, not the penning: and the marke that I shoote at, and not my vnskilfull shooting, and thus briefly I commit your honour to the li∣uing God, whose mercie is maruellous, whose power is infinite, & whose loue doth exceede.
