Noble Sir,
THe Dedicati∣on of this piece to your Name, may seem strange to one that is a stranger to

you. But the truth is, your interest in this young Gentleman deceased, gives you too great a title, to this poor, imperfect memo∣rial of him, while your great love to the worth and goodnesse that was in him, invited your Noble Spi∣rit, to adopt him into the Relation of a Son-in-law, a choice, which truly ren∣dereth you as honourable, as it would have rendered him happy, had he lived to enjoy it. But oh the in∣stability of all sublunary felicities. You expected a Marriage, and behold a

Funeral. Vanity of vani∣ties! how fitly hath that great Apostle phrased all terrene fruitions,1 Tim. 6.17 uncer∣tain riches! Ixion-like, they vanish while we hug them in our armes; yea, we lose them before we are possessed of them. This is the Doctrine, the living God teach us the Use; To do good,Ver. 18, 19 to be rich in good works, &c. to lay hold on e∣ternal life.
To your interest in these papers, your conde∣scension in pressing me to print them, as it hath laid upon me another engage∣ment

to publish, so it hath given me a new encou∣ragement to put them un∣der the protection of your Name, which though it cannot (I know) secure them from the just censure of many defects; yet it may free me from the un∣just censure of presumpti∣on, in this Dedication.
Accept them, Honour∣ed Sir, as an evidence of that great respect, which your integrity hath merit∣ed, as with others; so with my self. And if in the ensuing lines there be any thing that may either

alleviate your losse, or di∣vert the sense of it. It shall be a great satisfa∣ction, to
SIR,
