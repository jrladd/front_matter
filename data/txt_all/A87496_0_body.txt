Dread Soveraigne,
WHat your gracious Majestie hath practised of Humiliation (the subject of this worke) is not unknowne to your people; how full and frequent in Divine Supplications, joyned with many singular Attestations, to compose your subjects with godly and universall Re∣formation both in Church and State: And now also, because it was your Majesties speciall Command, after the delive∣rie hereof, that this Sermon should be published; there∣fore, according to dutie, it is here presented to your Royall hand. Notwithstanding this small Paper be in it selfe means and worthlesse; yet as Artaxerxes from a gratefull minde received a Cup of cold water, where a better Present could not be had; so your Majesties knowne Candor will entertaine and cherish this Mite, and by indulgent Princely acceptation adde worth unto it. The King of Niniveh
here bespeakes you (Gracious Sir) and as his, so may your Practice of Pietie keepe off Judgements from this Age also; and as Niniveh at the Command of her King turned to Repentance, so may these your Realmes doe the like, obeying God and his Vice-gerent.
This unfainedly wisheth he, who in all words and workes desireth to write and speake such things whereby him∣selfe and all the House of GOD may be saved; de∣siring also, that your Majesties Soule may bee ever bound up in the Bundle of Life, and kept from wicked assasination, that after a long and happy Fruition of your Kingdome here, you may be translated into a more glorious one hereafter.
