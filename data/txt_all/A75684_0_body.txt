MY LORD,
I Can make no Apology to the Publick, for sending this Dis∣course abroad; nor to Your Grace, for its appearing under Your Patronage; but that I believe the Occasion of it suf∣ficiently Agreeable and Satisfactory to Both, to gain Your Approbation of the Design: For the Sincerity whereof, I am induced to hope You will Accept the Performance, and Par∣don its Imperfections.
'Tis true, His Majesty has done so Great Things for our Na∣tions, that He needs not the Help of any Weak Endeavours to Support His Interest, or Endear His Person and Government to their Inhabitants; Yet since He who was above all Praise of Men, did vouchsafe to Accept it from the Mouth of Babes and Suck∣lings, to still the Enemy and Avenger; Why may not as mean an Orator prove Serviceable to put to silence the Ignorance of Foolish Men, who have said of our Soveraign, as those in the Parable, of their King, We will not have this Man to Reign over us?
The Hope of such Good Success, and some little Good Liking that my Hearers discovered to this Sermon, after its Delivery from the Pulpit, encouraged me to venture it to the Press: And that Presumption drew me into a Greater, to shelter it under Your Graces Name.

But, Since Men that fly to Altars for Sanctuary, ought to bring Offerings thither with them; I humbly beg leave to Assure Your Grace, That in this Dedication, I aim no less at an Acknow∣ledgment for Your past Favour, in Collating me to a Considerable Benefice, than at Your Future Countenance and Encourage∣ment.
And I esteem my self under the Greater Obligation to Your Goodness, that notwithstanding Your Grace's Extraordinary Care to provide an Able and Deserving Clergy for Your Diocess, You have however Admitted me into that Learned and Reverend Society; my Unworthiness of which, makes me seem to my self like Saul among the Prophets.
Might I be Improved by the Advantage of such Excellent Conversation, to Prophesie to the Edifying of the People whom I have in Charge, I shou'd be Happy in several respects: But in none more, than in making Your Grace, by that means, the Best Return within my Power, for all Your Benefits; Since no∣thing is so pleasing to You in Your Clergie, as the Diligent and Exact Performance of their Duty on their Cures.
For the Continuance whereof, May Your Grace live long, to Oblige and Encourage them to it: And as You have Honourably Born, and Faithfully Discharged, the Highest Offices in our Church and State; So may You, when You shall be taken from this World, Arrive at a Proportionable Degree of Glory in the Coelestial Hierarchy, to receive Above, the Reward of all the Good You bave done Below; and particularly to,
My Lord,
