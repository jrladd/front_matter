To the most Honourable, the exemplarily Devout and Vir∣tuous Lady, DOROTHY, Countess of ARRAN, &c. MADAM,
THE Substance of the ensuing Discourse was for the main, delivered in a great Audience, whence
 an unhappy Indisposition caused your Ladiships Ab∣sence: which at once hin∣dred me of the Honour, and (as it was suggested to me by a discreet and pious Lady) your Ladiship also of the satisfaction of being an Hearer of it. Coming therefore now into the pub∣lick, with a design of pub∣lick Good, it is humbly presented and dedicated to your Honour, in an Epistle as plain and homely, as it self; with hopes it may be as welcome out of the Press, as 'twas supposed it would have been out of the Pul∣pit.

The other Reasons, which moved me to inscribe it to so great a Name, were, partly, that it having receiv∣ed a kind of sacred Autho∣rity by passing through so August Hands, might be admitted with more Advan∣tage and Facility into the Closets of other Persons of Condition; and partly, that there might be extant some poor Testimony of my Gratitude to some of that Illustrious Family, which has been happily, and may it be much more, multiplied, by your Ladi∣ship, now become a Glori∣ous part of it.

As bounden, I daily pray all Accession of Splendour, Felicity, and Stability to your Ladiship and the whole Noble House: and beseech this (however mean) expression of Duty may be accepted from,
Madam,
