THere is nothing (most noble & mighty Lord) which hath more incited me to this weary la∣bour (which I hope I haue to good purpose effected) then the grace which I haue noted  your  selfe and other princes of your ranke liberally bestowe vpon the Arte of horsemanshipp both by your wne practise and the incouragement of others, which doth not only assure  that no peace shal make the glo∣rie of wae neglected, but doth also make me hope to liue to see in  as famous a nurserie of horsemen and hor∣ses,  euer hath bene  in Italie or Naples, and though my boldnesse in darring to present my ruder skill to your honor able iudgement may iustly be challenged to haue no garments but a naked boldenes, yet the loue I am bound to beare to that moste honorable house (into which you haue now moste happily planted your selfe) I hope wil be both my defence and protection, by which I knowe you will both take delight to pardon, and my selfe be proud to esteeme myselfe your srruant.
