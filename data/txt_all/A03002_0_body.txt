MADAME.
YOVR approoued loue to that
great house which I most ho∣nour,
and a true loue more
grounded vpon right kindred
of vertue, then of blood, which
generally maketh you com∣mendable
to all the world,
challenges yet a more speciall duty of me; besides
that good will you vouchsafe to our Nation. I wish
I could witnesse respect and gratefulnesse where I
owe it, in a better matter, or of mine owne; But since
I am not able, and yet will not forslow that duty, I
giue you that which hath ben giuen me, and with
that, the earnest of the earnest seruice which most
humbly vowes to you,
