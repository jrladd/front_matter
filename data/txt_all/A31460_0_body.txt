LEARNED SIR,
DEDICATIONS are now a days so much in fa∣shion,
 so frequently made use of, to recom∣mend all manner of Books to the World; that should any Ma∣nual, though never so small, appear barefac'd without one, our Nice and Critical Age would be apt to cast severe Reflections upon it; to condemn it, as mean and contemptible; and its Authour as Friend∣less, and a Person of no Account.

To avoid these mis∣fortunes, I have made choice of so Eminent a PATRON for this following Tractate; whose Merit cannot be controverted, but by those, who have none: and whose Candor ren∣ders Him Gracious to all, but those who are prejudic'd with Envy and Ill-nature.
The Principal end of prefixing Your Great
 Name to it, is to give a public Testimony of that deep obligation, which Your repeated Favours have laid up∣on me. Particularly, Your Diligent Peru∣sal of this very Manual; by whose warrantable Recommendation it was brought to the Press. Should I there∣fore have Dedicated it to any other, I am sen∣sible, I had done quite
 contrary to the Laws of Justice, and Grati∣tude.
Sir, without any For∣mal Compliments, or Fawning Addresses, I ac∣knowledge my self to be highly oblig'd to You; and upon that Account You might justly challenge ei∣ther this, or any other of my best Perfor∣mances.

To You therefore, I with all Modesty and Humility recommend this TABLET, as a Gem of great Value, being Compos'd by so Elegant an Author; Beseeching You to Shelter it under the Umbrage of Your most safe Protection. And then I shall be inclin'd to think, it must neces∣sarily flourish under Your PATRON∣AGE:
 which will therefore more strictly engage,
SIR,
