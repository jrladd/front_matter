NOt to draw any more teares from your eyes doe J publish vnder your Graces Protections, this FVNERAL ELEGIE. J could not haue thought it worthy your view, but that it aymes at the conser∣uation of the glorious fame of that lamented Duke your noble Brother, which is to you most deare. J know none can set truly forth his diuine Ʋertues, for his praise is a high-going Sea, that wants both shore and bottome: J doe onely shew my dutie in my broken English, both to awaken and incourage Great Britaines Poets, who were strucke into a Lethargy by this Princes sudden ascension to Heauen, to la∣ment (in singing his due praise) their irreparable losse, vntill I can honor France (desolate for his death) with the bright Patterne of his matchlesse life, more fully in my natiue Language.
