Great LORDS,
IVlius Caesar wrote his owne Commentaries, holding it no lesse honour to write, than fight; much hath bin writ concerning the art of war by land, yet nothing concerning the same at Sea. Many others might better than my selfe haue done this, but since I found none endeuourd it, I haue aduentured, encouraged by the good enttainment of

my late printed Accidence. This I suppose will be much bettered by men in these things better experienced, others ignorance may fault it: I haue beene a miserable Practitioner in this Schoole of Warre by Sea and Land more than thirty yeeres, howeuer chance or occasion haue kept me from your Lordships knowledge or imployment.

Thus humbly crauing your Honours pardons, and fauou∣rable construction of my good intent, I re∣maine
