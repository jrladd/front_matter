My Lord,
THE end of this Book is on∣ly to shew how Jesus Christ our Saviour hath been repre∣sented in and before the Law. What∣soever I did write in my weakness,
though it be not an Argument of my Scholarship, yet it is a Testimony of my Profession. I desire your Grace to accept of it, and effectually to shew you have no less Kindness for a poor Convert, than for him he is Conver∣ted to. I wish the Lord may bless your Grace, and endue you with all these Gifts as are beneficial to your Graces Felicity here, and hereafter. So I rest
