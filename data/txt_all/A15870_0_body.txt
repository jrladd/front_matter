Right Honorable:
MY resolued assurance, that the mouths of Infants may reueale a truth, makes me who haue not attain'd that perfection of speech, which is reputed worthie to be openly heard, yet hopefully ambitious to be beleeu'd. And truely, I desire no more, but that this sim∣ple Intelligencer, who hath brought in a relation of the WORLD to me, may re∣port me againe to the world, one who wish the good of all who are studiously affected, and Honour of those who haue put life in∣to

my poore indeauours. How much I am bound both in my selfe, and those whom I esteeme as neare, to your Lordships fa∣uours, I should blush in this idle manner to make profession, did I not thinke that those noble ends, which haue giuen beginning to all your actions, haue enabled you to enter∣taine with constancie, the slender acknow∣ledgements of great deseruings. But what your Honour did neuer expect in the great vnthankfull, and cannot meet in this little imperfect world of mine, may you finde eternally remembred, in that more glorious and incorruptible to come.
