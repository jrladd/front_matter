MY LORD,
THis work is Yours by more then one Interest, and therefore it returnes naturally unto YOU, for to lay aside my particular respects, (it being by Your Lordships favour that I serve his Majesty in this place,) You are Pater Patriae, and not more by Your Office, then by your love to this nation, and your most equall, and indifferent dispensation of Iustice, (next under his Majesty) the Father of this Church, and Common-wealth; And for whom can an oblation of this nature be more proper? besides, all that is heere, as it was at first spoken, in an humble obedience to Your Lord∣ships Order, so it was after upon a noble invi∣tation from You digested into this forme, and it is now made publique by Your Comman∣dement;
 so that in all the passages of it, it car∣ryes Your Image, Your Superscription, and therefore by this dedication, I doe not so much give it, as restore it. If there be any thing in it, that is mine, that answeares Your expectation, even in that, that it answeares Your expecta∣tion, I have my reward; for all that are below Your Lordship, I hope it shall have this use, it shall satisfie them, that Your Lo: procee∣dings in this businesse have bin in all points agreeable both to Honour, and Iustice; God leade Your Lordship by the hand, untill You have finished those great, and heroicall workes so happily begun, May they all prosper to the high pleasure of Almighty God, the encrease of Honour, and Revenew to his Majesty, of peace, and prosperity to this Kingdome, and to Your own immortall glory.
