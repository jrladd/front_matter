Honoured Madam,
IT was my Proposal, that if there were any thing acceptable in this Sermon, Your Lady∣ship might have it first transcrib'd for your own use, and in that manner communicate it to what Friends You pleas'd. But since Your Lady∣ship is of another Judgment, as that
the Character of one, who was every way so worthy, and so univer∣sally known and belov'd, deserves to be made more publick, I humbly sub∣mit. Only I have one thing to re∣quest, that if at any time I should be accused of Flattery in the manage∣ment of this Subject (and if I should, it can be by such Persons only, as envy all Commendations that are given to others, or were very igno∣rant of the Worth of Sir John Nor∣ton) Your Ladyship would be ready to vindicate me from that Aspersion; and to witness, that as my Pastoral Behaviour towards my Honoured Patron, both in the time of his Health, and of his Illness, had never that Guilt upon it; so now likewise, though it be less dangerous, I have
not bestowed upon Him any unde∣served Praise: But though some parts of His Character may seem warmly, and very affectionately represented, yet there are none of them above the Truth.
Madam, I shall not here attempt any Consolatory Discourse; neither shall I undertake, either to describe, or to renew Your Grief; but I shall rather chuse to draw a Vail over it at present, or leave You to declare it Yourself; not by fruitless Lamenta∣tions, and dark Retirements, as if You were discontented at Providence and the World, but (what is a clea∣rer Argument of Your Wisdom, and Your Love,) by doing all things in Honour of the deceased, the whole remainder of Your days. And as You have hitherto been, not only a
Companion with Him in all his com∣mendable Actions, but an Encourager too; so I doubt not, but Your Lady∣ship will continue the same Acts of Charity, keep up the same decent Hospitality, improve the same Friendships, respect the Clergy which He so truly lov'd, maintain the same Constancy in attending on the publick Worship of God, and perse∣vere in the same Faith: Then the Almighty will bless Your Ladyship with the Prosperity of this Life, and afterwards admit You to the same Place of Joy and Rest, whither Your Dearest Husband is gone before. Which that he may do, is the hearty Prayer of,
Madam,
