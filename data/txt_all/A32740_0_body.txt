SIR,
THIS Book I look upon
as a Present so far from
worthy of your High∣ness,
that I cannot but charge my
self with Presumption in the ve∣ry
Dedication of it. But as the
Work it self was written under
your Roof, and the Author of it

had the honour at the same time
to be generously obliged by your
Highness. As it is properly the
Life of an Hero, whom you your
self have encountred with his Sci∣mitar
in his hand; an Hero whose
Victorious Course was then stop∣ped
by your assistance, when our
brave French gave that famous
Defeat to the Grand Visier near
the River Raab; the place where
you gave so many signal marks of
that extraordinary Valour, which
is essential to the Character of
your Illustrious Family, and he∣reditary
to all that bear your
Name; to whom, Sir, should I
inscribe this Book but to your
self, either upon the point of glo∣ry
or protection? To sum up the
number of your Ancestors, whose
great Actions fill the best pages

of our History; to present you
with your Pedigree, or the pour∣traits
of so many Princes who have
made your very Name immor∣tal;
to insist upon those that bear
it now, and by their own merit,
and the great Charges they pos∣sess,
are so considerable; that
in your Highness and your Bro∣thers,
one may behold all that is
high, and exalted in France; to
say that in your Family those
Dignities are at present united,
which never met in any Kings
Reign before, as the Office of
Great Chamberlain, Great Almoner of
France, and Colonel of the Light
Horse. I am not, Sir, now to
learn, that these are Truths
would offend your Modesty, and
that it is peculiar to your House
to reject all praises, how just so∣ever.

This is the reason that
makes me sparing upon this sub∣ject;
and to content my self
with this humble profession, that
I am with all respect, and venera∣tion,
as I ought to be,
SIR,
