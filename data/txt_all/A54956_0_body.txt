WHat shall I say, or how excuse my Boldness,
in venturing to make so mean a present, and
without permission too; I am full of fears, tho
hitherto I have still run the same risque, and
always found my Friends so good both to forgive and accept
my worthless trifles: Nay even her Royal Highness shew'd
such a benign Condescention, as not only to pardon my am∣bitious
daring, but also Incouraged my Pen, why then shou'd
I fright my self with the apprehension of your Frowns and
Anger, when at the same time I know you to be the most
Generous and best tempered Man in the World.
I look upon those that endeavour'd to discountenance this Play
as Enemys to me, not that, and had the Play been never o
good they wou'd have shew'd their Teeth: Yet sure, if you
be so Noble to protect it, their good manners (that is, if they
understand any) tho their spite remains will make 'em cease
to Cavil at the Work, when such a worthy name Adorns
the Frontispiece. I must not trouble you with the little Ma∣lice
of my Foe, nor is his Name fit to be mentioned in a
Paper addrest to Sir Robert Marsham, he has Printed so
great a falshood, it deserves no Answer; yet give me leave
without being thought Impertinent or Prolix, to say I now
am pleased and treated by those who please every Specta∣tr
with a Candour and Sweetness not to be exprest.
If I followd my inclinations, I shou'd now proceed to recite

hose Vertues which all the happy World that have the
Honour to know you daily see, but that I am sure woud be
the way to offend, for you scarce hate Vice more than to
hear of your Merits, therefore I shall only add, as you are
Happy in your Lady, Happy in your Children, which are
Lovely and Hopeful as an Indulgent Parents wish can form;
Happy in Fortune, Capacious like your Soul; Happy in
your Friends, who love you even to Fondness: That Hea∣ven
may continue all these Blessings many succeeding Years,
is the earnest and daily wish of,
SIR,
