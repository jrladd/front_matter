SIR,
THE Engagements We lay under at the Com∣mencement of those Differences wherein the Greater Part of EUROPE stands at pre∣sent Concern'd, being by Divine Providence, and your Sacred Majesty's Great Prudence hap∣pily Withdrawn; You have Laid Open to Ʋs all those Maritin Itineraries, Whereby We Trade and Traffique to the several Parts and Ports of the World, through the Two and Thirty Points or Bearings of the Universe.
Conformable to Which, Influenc'd by Your Majesty's Approbation and Munificence, I have Attempted to Improve Our Commerce and Correspondency at Home, by Registring and Illustrating Your
Majesty's High-Ways, Directly and Transversly, as from Shore to Shore, so to the Prescrib'd Limits of the Circumambient Ocean, from this Great Emporium and Prime Center of the Kingdom, Your Royal Metropolis.
Precedents of this Nature Divine Authority is not wanting to afford; Had not the Constant Practice of the Greatest Princes, even in the Achma of the Three Last Empires of the World, and We may Presume the Assyrian also, Highly Recommended It a Work truly Great and Political.
For, The Persian Princes had the Stationary Distances through Their Vast Extended Territories exactly Registred and Enume∣rated; The Macedonian Conqueror had His Mensores Itinerum Alexandri; And the Illustrious Founder of the Roman Greatnes, JULIUS CAESAR, not only Compos'd an Universal Itinerary, but Order'd That Great Survey of the World, that became the Work of Two and Thirty Years: Lastly, the August Emperor, Antoninus Pius, in that Celebrated Collection of His, of the Consular Ways and Stations, Mansions and Mutations throughout the Whole Roman Empire, Has Oblig'd Ʋs more especially with an Iter Britanniarum, a Distinct Itinerary of that Part of Britain which Added so Great a Lustre to the Roman Diadem.
The Excellency of such Tables, equally Corresponding the Compliances of Peace and Rufflings of War, has through all Ages found an Ac∣knowledgment; And yet the most Accurate Ones of this Kind, even those Peutingerian Military Charts so Worthily Admir'd, appear too faint a Resemblance, whereby an Idaea might be Fram'd, of what We have Wrought This Our Essay to, by Actual Dimensuration.
Here then I Present Your Sacred Majesty with an Important Novelty, the Scale of Peace and War, whereby (not to Prescribe Your Majesty) a True Prospect of This Your Florishing Kingdom may be Taken, Pregnant Hints of Security and Interest Gather'd, and the Considerable Augmentation of It's Extent, beyond Vulgar Esti∣mation, more Certainly Collected, than from any the Notional Accounts, Impos'd heretofore, by the Erroneous Computations of Latitude, Longitude, or Proportion.
I might here be Bold to Tell Your Majesty, That We, who have hitherto seem'd to Truckle under the Fame of France and Belgium, for Performances of this Nature, may Presume, by the Propinquity of This Our Design to Perfection, That perchance no Attempt at first came nearer, to have Given such Measures to The Virtuosi of the World, as Forein Princes and States shall be Glad to Imitate.
But I, Dread Soveraign, Choose rather to Consecrate It, as An Earnest to The Succeeding Volumes of My BRITANNIA; That Your Majesty and The World may See, how Effectually Ope∣rative Your Royal Countenance is, in Adapting such Mean Abilities to so Great Performances, That perchance no Library in The World affords a Parallel.

May the same Influences Tend to the Culminating all other Arts and Sciences, and the King of Kings Crown Your Sacred Head with Peace and Plenty, Raising up the Splendor of Great Britains Mo∣narchy, and Rendring It The Grand Exemplar of Industry and In∣genuity, even to the more Polite and Civiliz'd Nations of the World.
