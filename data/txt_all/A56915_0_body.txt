Gentlemen,
SInce the Dedication of Books is so much in fashion, you may justly claim this of mine; For the Ichnography of this Translation was drawn by me, at the sweet and delightful Habitation of your Vir∣tuous Mother, in Milton aforesaid, while she was pleased to make use of me to preside over your Educa∣tions for a season, till better Help
could be procured: I presume therefore to prefix your Names be∣fore this Tract; partly out of Gra∣titude to your most Worthy Mo∣ther; and partly too, as an ac∣knowledgment of your personal Re∣spects to me; and also, as far∣ther Encouragement to your stu∣dies, wherein I hope and believe you have already made so great a Pro∣gress.
