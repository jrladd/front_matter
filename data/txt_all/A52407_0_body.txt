My most Honoured Ladies, May it please your Honours,
THese Sermons, though they have not the honour of their Authors Pen, ei∣ther in transcribing, or in correcting of them; yet they breathe so much of his Spirit, that whosoever was not a stranger to his Ministry, may easily perceive whose
labours they are, without an Interpre∣ter. They are now come forth, by the labour and diligence of them that priz'd his Person, and honour'd his Ministry; whereunto, although I was not in a Capacity of contributing any furtherance, yet I could not in Con∣science let them pass into the World without doing this right to the Au∣thor, Publishers, and to the Papers themselves, as to give in my poor Te∣stimony, That they are the genuine issue of him whose Name they bear; whereby, though dead, he yet speak∣eth. My humble Prayer to God shall be, That into what hand soever Pro∣vidence may put them, the same Bles∣sing which accompanied the hearing of them, may go along with the read∣ing of them also; for the rendring of them effectual to their spiritual and everlasting good.
As to my presumption in Dedica∣ting
of them to Your Honours: I am not ignorant to how much censure I am liable in the Opinion of Standers-by; neither can I suffer more preju∣dice abroad, than I have suffered con∣flict in my own Spirit at home.
But the deserved Honour I bear to the Name of my Dear Husband (now with the Lord) and the deep sense of my Duty to Your Honours, hath pre∣vailed against all discouragements.
May Your Honours be pleased to ac∣cept of this solemn acknowledgment of the various Obligations which your Ladiships have laid upon me, and to pardon this boldness, it shall not at all trouble me what censures others may pass upon me.
The Father of Mercies abundant∣ly recompence all the kindness you have shewed to the Dead and to the Living; and may the Golden Oyl of Grace, which he hath abundantly
poured out upon your Heads, descend upon all the Branches of Your Noble Families, and render them truly Ho∣nourable to many Generations. I cease further to trouble Your Honours, and humbly beg leave to subscribe my self, in all sincerity,
