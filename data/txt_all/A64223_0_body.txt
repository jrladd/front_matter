My Lord,
SInce the trifling Treatise of an
Almanack hath usurped a custom
to pinnion some Honourable
Name to the Patronage of the Authors
Follies; had we not certain evidence
from the uncertainty of their Predicti∣ons,
that their Brains (like their great
Oracles the Planets) are often wan∣dring;
it might be deemed a Crime,
beyond the benefit of the Clergy, to
prefix before any Book, a dedication to
a Noble Person: Or when I read the
unreasonableness of others in those Ad∣dresses,
imploring their Patrons to be
their Dii Tutelares, and prostrate their

reputes to the unmannerly mangling of
every Censurist, under the notion of
protecting (that is adopting) the Au∣thors
Ignorance, or negligence; its
enough to tempt the whole world to
turn Democritians, and hazard their
spleens in laughing at such mens mad∣ness.
My present design is only to give
your Lordship my observance of your
Commands about the Description and
Improvement of the Sector; and
wherein I have erred (through mi∣stake,
or defect) I despair not, but
from your Honor I shall meet with a
pardon of Course to be granted unto
