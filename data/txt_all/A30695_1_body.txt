THe winged Lion's not so fierce in fight,
As Liberi's hand presents him to our sight:
Nor could his pencil make him halfe so fierce,
Or roar so loud, as Busenello's Verse.
But your Translation does all three excell,
The Fight, the Piece, and lofty Busenell.
As their small Gallies may not hold compare
With our tall ships, whose sailes employ more aire:
So does th' Italian to your Genius vaile,
Mov'd with a fuller and a nobler gale.
Thus while your Muse spreads the Venetian story,
You make all Europe emulate her glory;
You make them blush, weak Venice should defend
The cause of Heaven, while they for words contend,
Shed Christian blood, and populous cities raze,
Because th' are taught to use some different phrase.
If listning to your charms, we could our jars
Compose, and on the Turk discharge these wars,
Our British Arms the sacred Tomb might wrest
From Pagan hands, and triumph o're the East.
And then you might our own high deeds recite,
And with great Tasso celebrate the fight.
