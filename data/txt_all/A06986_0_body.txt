I Haue heeretofore (Righte Ho∣norable and my very good Lord) presented you with Marlorat his collection vpon the E∣uangelyste S. Mathewe, and I had longe ere this offered vnto you the same Authors collec∣tion vpon Marke and Luke, had the Printer with as much spede passed the same through the presse, as I vvyth dilligence translated it. But time hauing at the last ouercome all delayes, this Exposition vpopn the Gospell of S. Marke and Luke, necessarily setteth it selfe betwene that of Mathew and Iohn alre∣dy prynted: whereby a pleasaunt harmony and perfect consente of the fower Euangelistes doth the better appeare. Howe necessarye and profitable this deuine Exposition will be vnto the Church, the grauity, credit and Authoritie of those Godly Fathers, both old & new: out of whose workes and labors the same hath bene collected, by that blessed Martir of Fraunce Augustine Marlorat do suf∣ficiently testefie. Therefore as the learned in the Latine Tongue haue, and doe reape great Profite by this Theologicall Exposition, so I thought good for the more generall profite of my country men to translate the same into the english tongue, The which my labor of all the rest the least, I haue thought good to dedicate vnto youre Honor most humbly beseching you to accept the same accordyng to

your wonted goodnesse, and to pardon my bouldnesse. Thus I ceasse, beseching the god of all glory to make you Partaker of that Honor which is prepared for the Sayncts by Iesus Chryst in the Kingdome of Heauen
