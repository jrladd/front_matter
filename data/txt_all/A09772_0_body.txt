MAdame, among other bookes of holy scripture, that of the Psalmes wel deserueth to bee singularly recom∣mended to vs. It is nowe some time, since hauing bestowed some payne in translating and expounding the same, I gaue my selfe also to take some more libertie of dealing with them by way of meditating vpon that subiect, choosing (as it were for an as∣saye) the seuen Psalmes called some time Penitential, because they were appointed to such as after hauing sa∣tisfied open and canonical penaunce, were reunited to the body of the Church: wholy doing it for my par∣ticular
instruction and consolation. After this, beeing required by a great & vertuous princesse, to frame for her some forme of prayers: I tooke them afresh into my hands, polishing them ouer, and that with hope of pu∣blishing them: which being letted by the sodayne decease of that Lady, I reserued them among my papers as things of no great price: where they had lyen still, had not bene the com∣ming of master Anthony Bacon your sonne, into these partes: whom when I sawe to take pleasure in this litle piece of woorke, and againe know∣ing by the latin letters wherewith it hath liked you to honour me, the great and singular, yea extraordinarie gra∣ces wherwith God hath indewed you, and whereof I acknowledge a very paterne in your said sonne: I perswa∣ded my selfe that it should not be dis∣pleasing
to you, if this small vo∣lume carying your name vpon the browe, were offered to you, in testimo∣nie of the honour and reuerence I beare to the vertue of you and yours: hoping withall that this estate of widowehode whereunto it hath plea∣sed God to call you by decease of that right vertuous and of right renow∣med Lord, my Lord Nicolas Bacon your husband, & most worthy Keeper of the seale of England, you might perhaps therein finde some consola∣tion, after the reading of those great and holy doctors Greeke and Latine so familiar to you, for your better con∣firming in the meditation of spiritual things, and in this constancie and Christian patience wherewith God hath so beautified you, that in you is verily acknowledged that Christi∣anly high minded courage which I
sawe in these partes shining in the de∣ceased, of very happy memorie, Syr Anthony Cooke Knight, during those great calamities publique to the realme, and particular to him & his whole familie. See the ground of my purpose, which if it may please you to take in good part, which I very humbly craue, it may be perhaps an occasion of proceeding in this busines, our Lord ayding, whom I beseeche, Madame, that increasing in you his greatest graces, he will preserue you and all your verie noble familie, long in all holy and perfect prosperitie. From Geneua this first of Nouem∣ber. Anno. 1581.
