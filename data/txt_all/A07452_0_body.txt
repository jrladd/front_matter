RIght Honourable: my desire is to cast my Mite, into the Treasury of the Church: and for want of Gold, Pearle or Pretious stones: to bring a Rams skinae or twaine, and a little GoatsExod. 35. 23. haire, to the building of the Lordes Tabernacle▪ I may seeme (perhaps) to passe the boundes of modesty, in crauing your Honors protection for so smal a thing. The smaller it is, the more needefull to be pro∣tected. And sithence you vouchsafed not long since, to heare part of it with patience: I will now presume vp∣on your L▪ fauoure for the whole. I doe not dedicate it vnto you, as doubting of your Honours care, in this point of Repentance, your loue to Religion: Zeale to the Truth: practise of Piety: haue made you Honou∣rable, not in your selfe alone; but also (as Samuel1. Sam. 9. 6. was) in the heartes of the people. Yet giue mee leaue2. Pet. 3. 1. (Ibeseech you) to stirre vp and warne your pure mind,

That as you haue begun to cleaue vnto CHRIST, with a good purpose of heart: So you would continue to aoe it still: and to do it more and more. Remember alwayes (Noble Lord) that bloud vnstayned before Men, is stayned bloud before GOD; if it be not continually restored by the bloud of CHRIST. This Sermon then, I commend vnto your Honour, and it, to the good bles∣sing and holy protection of GOD. Hadleigh in Suffolke, May the 26. 1607.
