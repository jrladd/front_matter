AN Epistolar Address prefixt to any Trea∣tise, is so Modish, that a Discourse looks somewhat unornamental without it: yet in this Dialogue between the Essexian Triumviri and T. Otes, there is somewhat more then a Custom or Fashion to be pleaded by way of Apologie; for indeed there is reason the Reader should understand the bare design, without any speci∣ous Masque or Veil; which in short is this: The very words, or the genuine sense of them, between the three Colchester-Gentlemen and Otes, in any part of the Discourse or Dialogue, are really true, and will be attested upon Oath, if requir'd. What else is added, as to the substance, will be aver'd and maintain'd by persons of Loyalty and Integrity.

What is additional, by way of Amplication, is the Latitude which the Amanuensis assum'd to himself, and is as willing to undergo the Test, as any other person whatsoever, upon a strict Examination. All this tends only by the three Loyal Colchester-Gen∣tlemen, to advise all persons in the County of Es∣sex, to be as unanimous in the Election of Loyal and Serviceable Members, for the service of their King and Country, as Otes and his Party are in∣dustrious to promote those of the Dissenting Faction, to bring all (provided other Counties should follow his Example) to a detestable Anarchie and Confu∣sion; which it is reasonably supposed all His Maje∣sties Liege Subjects will religiously deprecate, and venture their Lives and Fortunes to prevent, in vindication of Monarchie and the best of Govern∣ments, Ecclesiastical and Civil, as now by Law esta∣blished, against all Traiterous and villanous oppo∣sers.
