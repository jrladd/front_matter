My dearest friend,
SInce it is the hard fortune of these glow-worms to see day, I wish they might have passed your examination; for I know you to be a severe Critick in Poetry, aswell as in Philology, and the Scien∣ces: But since others importunities, and mine own pressing occasions, have denied it, I must present them loaden with their own blemishes, that being fitter Objects of Pardon, they may draw in par∣doning, more demonstrations of your Candor, and adde to my Engagements, could they receive Aug∣mentation. I will not commit a Rape upon your modesty by any praises, though Truth her self might be your Panegyrist, and yet continue na∣ked; give me onely leave to tell you from mine own experience, that Love is more then a mere

Sympathy: for admiration did first attract my thoughts to you, and after fix them; though it were onely your innate sweetnesse that received them with an undeserved entertainment. Sir What I was first endebted to you at Durham I en∣deavour to acquit in part here at Cambridge: for the Totall, though it be rather above my ability, then desires, yet should I hate the thought of a Generall discharge, let me onely beg of you that these Cherrystones may draw from you your own Pearls, which cannot but break themselves a day through that darknesse to which you now confine them. Let us once see Fancy triumph in the spoyls of the richest Learning, there will many (no doubt) presse to follow the Chariot, yet shall none be more forward then
Sir,

St. JOHNS Jan. 6. 1646.
