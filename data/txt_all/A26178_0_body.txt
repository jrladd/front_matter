May it please your Excellency.
SINCE among the many subjects of just Praise,
which make up your Excellency's distinction,
it is not the least, that the true Religion, and
Loyalty, are known to have been chosen with a
Judgment properly your own; my ambition
could not carry me to a fitter Patron for Truths, which
are to encounter a strong Pre-possession, in Men taught
to object novelty against this Revolution: tho' with as
little cause of triumph, as the Papists have for their que∣stion,
where was the Protestant Church before Luther?
As your Excellency's wise and vigorous dis∣charge,
of Offices of the highest Trust and Consequence, un∣der

self to justifie our present Settlement; I beg leave to ap∣peal
to your Excellency's early and eminent Example:
which will weigh more, with Persons acquainted with so
illustrious a Character, than any Argument from pass'd
Times.
And yet, what I here offer, being for the most part,
the Result of the Collective Wisdom of the Nation;
may not be wholly undeserving of your Excellency's
Patrondge: nor can I apprehend, that you will refuse
these Fundamental Truths, the benefit of being recom∣mended
to the World under so Great a Name: which,
tho' it will set my faults in the clearer light; if your
Excellency shall be thought to bear with 'em, cannot
but moderate the Censures, against
