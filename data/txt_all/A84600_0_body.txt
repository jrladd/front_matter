GENTLEMEN,
I Conceive it will not be accounted any presump∣tion to present that unto you, which without in∣justice, and breach of promise, I cannot detain from you; for howsoever when I heard you had designed me to this solemn Service; of being Gods mouth unto you, on the day of your pub∣lique Thanks-giving; the consciousness of mine own weakness, caused me to entertain the message with fear: yet when you were pleased to give life and incouragement to this plain and unstudied Sermon: First, by your cheerfull and affectio∣nate attention in hearing, and then by your earnest importunitie, That it might be made publick, when you had heard it: I must confess I was overcome (contrary to mine own inclination) to pro∣mise, that if my reverend Brother, who joyned with me in the work, did send his Sermon to the Press before, that mine in due time should follow after: in performance whereof, and in answer (if not satisfaction) to your desires therein, I have tendred it unto you without addition or alteration of one materiall passage, that was
then delivered unto you. I was intended to have added a Doctri∣nall Explanation, of the remaining part of the Psalm; with Scrip∣ture Resolutions, to some Questions that may serve to be obvious therein, before this mangled and imperfect peece had come to your hand: but upon the advise of some godly judicious friends, I have suspended the same (conceiving it better to speak enough, then to speak all) accept it therefore as a testimonie of my complyance, rather to your pleasures, then mine own will (who am not so great a stranger to mine own weakness, as to think any thing of mine worthy of publike view) wherein if mine obedience shal appear bet∣ter then my sacrifice, yet this is my comfort, That the same can∣dor of Spirit, and ingenuitie, that put me on the Service; and gave so undeserved approbation, unto the weak performance; Knows also, how to pardon my weakness, and imperfection, with favorable acceptations: then which indulgence, as when I reflect upon my self, I dare desire no more; So when I look upon you I can hope no less: All that I would further say unto you, you shall receive at large expressed in the Book; which I will not anticipate by any earnest solicitation of your forward mindes, to raise up themselves by the reading of it to wel-grounded determinations, and constant resolution, dayly to act and practise accordingly; only this I must add, That the Subject is so excellent, that it is as worthy of your dayly remembrance, and deepest consideration; as my Pen is un∣worthy of so excellent a subject: and withall, That as your desire of publishing of it, hath obliged me to present it to the world; so hath it engaged you also to walk more answerable to the Intents, and directions of the same, before the world.
The Discourse is yours, the Duty therein is yours, and my ut∣termost Indeavours, Service, and Prayers, are yours; which shal speak that unto God for you, which (to avoyd the appearance of flattery) I dare not speak unto you. The most high God, that hath highly honored you, with his highest dispensations, enable you al joyntly, and severally, with his grace and blessings, to honour him again, with your highest prayses and thanksgivings; which shall be the constant Prayer
