My Lord,
WHen the orbe of learning is illustrat by the irra∣diation, and benigne a∣spect of Princes favours, then all things in a

Kingdome are conspi∣cuous and beautifull; but when the great Lumi∣naries and Patrons of knowledge are eclipsed, the orbe must needs bee obscured, and every thing within its circum∣ference darkned; hence (as in the darknesse of the aire) men are trou∣bled with strange and mishapen apparitions,

which they veryly be∣leeve are reall visions, whereas indeed they are but phantomes and ima∣ginations of our brains, which upon the intro∣duction of a candle are easily dissipated; even so in the intellectuall dark∣nesse, men are troubled with uncoth and hideous opinions, beleeving and embracing them as re∣all

truths, whereas in∣deed they are but il∣lusions.
Morte obita quales fama est volitare fi∣guras,
Aut quae sopitas de∣ludunt somnia sensus.
Which upon the ap∣proach of the light of Scripture and Truth, do vanish into nothing. In this time when dark∣nesse

hath overwhelmed the minds of many men, who are molested with strange fancies, which they call new lights, whereas indeed they are but the glating of rotten wood, or of glowwormes, or those skipping lights (which wee call jack in the candle) I have ad∣ventured to bring in this little tract, as a peice of

waxe candle, after so many bright torches, that men may be unde∣ceived, and that the true abjects both of faith and practice may be mani∣fested; to which small peice J have prefixed your Lordships name, as being bound in the obligation of duty and affection to Your good∣nesse and eminent parts

in generall; whose know∣ledge, judgment, con∣science, and sincerity are such, and so well known, both at home and abroad, as they need not the help of any pen; so likewise, J am tyed by this small mite to expresse my gratitude, in particular for your Lordships favorable a∣spect on, & respect to me;

which I cannot better testifie, then by acknow∣ledging my selfe.
