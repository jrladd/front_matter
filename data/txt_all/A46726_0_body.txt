May it please your Lordship,
ALthough the preaching of this Sermon, occasioned very great Clamors against me, by those from whom I little expected any such thing, and of whom I thought I had deserved better, yet I am not in the least sorry for it upon my own account, not only because I am well enough assured of my own innocent and Just intenti∣ons in it, but also because it hath given me an opportunity of being known to your Lordship, in which, tho' at the first, I may perhaps appear under the notion of a Crimi∣nal, yet I do not in the least question but that your Lord∣ship's great Judgment and Integrity will easily acquit or
justly Convince and Censure me, either of which, I hope I. shall bear with Modesty and Submission; and there∣fore I am the more bold to appeal to your Lordship as my proper Ordinary, by whom alone I ought to be ordered, and to whom, as I have already sworn; so I am resolved to perform Obedience in all things that relate to the Dig∣nity of your Lordships Place in the Church, or the Du∣ty of my own; and therefore am,
My Lord,

Newland,
Jan. 29 1681.
