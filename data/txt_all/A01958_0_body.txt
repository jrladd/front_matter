PLEASETH IT YOVR GRACE: There haue beene two arch-enemies that haue euer molested the Church in her periods of peace; the Heretique, and the Atheist. The first in matters of veri∣tie, obducing a cloud, and spreading a curtaine of ignorance and error, before the eies of Gods people: the latter in things of pietie, withdrawing the cloud, and opening the vaile of maiesty and honour, to euery vulgar both hand and eie. Concerning the first, as requiring more of the head, I leaue to those learned pens and selected soldiers, whom God hath endowed with greater measure of vnderstanding to fight his battels. But for the second, that aske more of the heart, I presumed, with the poore widow in the Gospel, to cast my mite into the donaries of God, to the vse of the godly. A subiect I am well assured as necessarie, as distast∣full for these times: For whether it be that gaine hath ob∣turated mens eares, or guilt hath obdurated their hearts, I find abroad men much recalcitrant to this doctrine: yet how

needfull it is to be touched, I report me to Christian hearts. But who am I, that I should irritare crabrones; whose im∣pudencie notwithstanding, or ignorance, or importunitie, for so did such vermin signifie in hyeroglophicall learning, if they prooue obstreperous, I most humbly craue your Grace to protect me, if not from their buzzing, yet from their stinging. Whose height, beeing placed in the Zenith of this hemisphere, albeit they cannot reach with hands of iniurie; yet I feare me, they will not forbeare to barke at with hearts of enuie. To your Grace therefore, in the behalfe of all this Church, I offer this simple Treatise: for whose vigi∣lancie and indefatigablenesse, as we thanke the Lord; so we pray him for your long continuance, and happy sitting.
