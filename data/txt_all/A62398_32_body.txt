MOst worthy Sir, do not disdain,
That I my Dream so oft explain;
Unto your hands I do it commit,
The Issue of Barren Wit,
A great deall more from me might appear,
Within this seventy and two year,
But what is past, I cannot now recall,
I hope ye'l think this makes amends for all,
I never was at Shool, I cannot write,
Pardon my Lines though they be unperfyte,
The best of Gallants indeed may controul,
A wise man will ever countenance a fool,
Although in wrong he will not bear him up,
Yet he will laugh at his foolish sate;
The four and twenty of my Dream,
William Grieve of Common-side was one,

Which I have dedicat to you,
He is an honest man and true;
A worthy Shepherds Swain, who lives upon his Store,
And relieves the Poor and Needy, as I have said before.
I wish his Golden-fleece with him may still remain,
While I fetch Iasons Fleece from Greece into Scotland.
