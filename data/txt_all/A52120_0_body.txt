My Lord,
THIS small Tract comes to
Your Lordship, not as to a
Patron to protect its Errors
(if any such there be) but as
to a critical noble Friend, that will be
sure faithfully to tell the Author of
them. Which favour, together with
a chearful acceptance of this poor pre∣sent,
he humbly hopes for, because of its
Relation, being writ at Dunham, by
Your humble Servant, who besides his
domestick dependance, cannot forbear

without ingratitude to tell the
World that Your Lordship's kindness
hath very much encouraged and assist∣ed
him in Mathematical Studies, not
only by a free Communication of ma∣ny
a choice notion both vivâ voce, and
by the loan of Manuscripts. But also
by a Considerable number of excellent
Books and costly Instruments bounti∣fully
bestowed upon him: Who wanting
other ways to express his many singu∣lar
Obligations, and deep sence there∣of,
humbly offers this Punie Treatise
for Your Lordships diversion at spare
hours; and is ambitious to write him∣self,
Oct: 26. 1681.
MY LORD,
