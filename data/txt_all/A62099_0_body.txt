My Lord,
I Confesse it might cause wonder that so weake, and worthlesse a creature as I am, should expose a∣ny thing to publike view, did not the custome of the present tim, plead a certaine liberty of the Presse, even for weaknesse it selfe.
Three speciall reasons are usually given of divl∣ging Sermons in this kind: First, to helpe and benefit Gods Church and people: Secondly, to manifest that

inward respect, which the publishers owe to those Ho∣nourable or Worshipfull persons to whom they are dedi∣cated and presented. Thirdly, to vindicate the truth against the mistakes and traducements of ignorant or ill-affected hearers: and truly (my Lord) these are the reasons that have imboldened my weaknesse thus to discover it selfe, in thrusting these following Sermons from my private Cell.
1. I know that the wise God doth sometime sur∣ther the greatest affaires of his Church, by the poore indeavours of his meanest servants; and at this time, one of the great matters in hand, is to reforme the Clergy, and to constitute such a Ministry, as should on∣ly seeke the things of Jesus Christ; and he that knowes all hearts can witnesse, that mine aime when I preach∣ed the first of these, did tend to that thing, and I now conceived that (with Gods providence and blessing) the samemight (haply) at this present, afford some under service towards that so pious and necessary a worke.
And mine indeavours in the second of these were, by perswasions out of Gods booke, to tie peoples tongues to their good behaviours, (as I apprehended did be∣come a Minister of Christ to doe) in those evill and barking dayes, and the conditions of many are still the same, they take and keepe to themselves, I know not what strange liberty of bold speaking, whereby these unsetled times are likely to prove exceeding miserable;

for evill tongues as they discover evill men, so they doe make evill times, and therefore I conceived that that Sermon also, if it come into some hands (and God please to say Amen to my prayers with it) may not altogether at this present prove unprofitable, or un∣seasonable
And in third, mine aimes were, when I first utte∣red it, to move my fellow-members and sufferers in the cause of Christ, to make use of that soveraigne preservative of patience, which experience hath al∣wayes found to be so truly effectuall against the hea∣vie blowes of potent hands, and the smarting wounds of poysonous tongues: And I dare boldly say, that while sinne and sorrow hath a being upon earth, it will never be improper to heare or read a discourse of that subject; for we have all, at all times, yea, at this time, need of patience; nay, I dare add further, that even your Lordship in the midst of your Honours, (since you have resolved to follow only the dictate of Gods word, and conscience, in your walke, and way) while mens tongues runne at liberty, will have occasi∣ons sometimes to thinke upon it.
And in the last of these, I have (though briefely) handled a matter, most needfull also (I am sure) for this present age to be acquainted with: it is the right temper and nature of the spirit of the Gospel: I prea∣ched of it onely to mine owne Parish, but I pray for the

inlargement of it in all places, and I know your Ho∣nour and all others, that have religious and loyall hearts, truly aiming at the Gospels glory, and the Kingdomes peace, doe in like sort desire the same: to the end therefore that I might be a meane to awaken others more able, of my profession, to make more am∣ple discoveries of it, as their duty to God, and their Prince commands, and these times require, I have beene here bold to publish my notes upon that subject also: And this (my Lord) is my first reason.
2. My second is, to manifect by this occasion to the worlds eye, that true inward respect, which I acknow∣ledge of long time, to have duly owed unto your Lord∣ship; your Noble Grandfather of pious memory, be∣ing quickened by your most friendly solicitation, did freely bestow upon m, that place of maintenance, wher∣in (as yet) I have my dwelling, upon this sole condi∣tion and charge, that I should truly labour to winne soules to Christ: which godly care of his, as it spake him a true friend of Christ, so it may expose him for a patterne to all Patrons, and your Lordship herein is his true successour: so that if these my first fruits of this nature, were of any worth, I am bound by a double tye to Dedicate them onely to your selfe, as to mine an∣cient Noble friend, as to my present Honourable Pa∣tron.
But (my Lord) there is yet another reason that

doth challenge this duty from me of manifesting my selfe unto the world to be your servant, and that is this,
When I was questioned, and much menaced for the first of these Sermons, and did upon that occasion (to the end you might not be mistaken in the cause of my troubles) present a copy of it to your view: you were pleased upon the reading thereof, to proffer your selfe like a true Patron, to be my defender in that businesse; and you would also make use of all the friends you had in England, (that was your owne expression) in my behalfe, rather then I for that matter should suffer dammage.
Truly (my Lord) the consideration of that your Noblenesse, in being so freely ready to engage your selfe in the cause of Christ, for me so mane a person, the times being then so conflicting, hath more deepely captivated my heart to your Lordships service, then my hand or tongue is able to expresse: yea, should some crafty Zibaes (unhappily) so farre prevaile (as I hope they never shall) against your poore Mephibo∣sheth, as to move my Lord, in aftertimes, to thinke amisse of his servant, and as David did, to judge him unworthy of former favour, yet I would have all men know, that of necessity I am bound, and therefore must, and shall, from the remembrance of that your good∣nesse, for ever honour you.

And (my Lord) whither now should that poore wounded Sermon retire her selfe, at this her second and more publike appearance? whither should shee flie for shelter? but onely to that wing which did not disdaine of its owne accord, at her first flight, to open it selfe unto her in the middest of dangers: And behold (my Lord) she comes unto you, and your free bounty hath made her bold, to bring three of her sisters with her, who have all in their measure tasted of her sorrowes, and desire now to partake of that rest, which she begges to enjoy under your shade, your protection is large enough to defend them all foure, wherefore bee pleased my Honourable Lord to give them all leave to∣gether with their Author to boast themselves still and for ever, in your Noble Patonage.
3. And my last reason of publishing these Ser∣mons, was and is, to rectifie (if it may be) those mis∣apprehensions, which some hearers had of certaine passages in them, and still have of me for the same: I doe not intend to Apologize for my selfe, I am a man, and may transgresse, and doe so daily against my will, (the Lord be mercifull unto his servant;) And I know besides, that it is tedious even to good men sometimes, to heare wronged innocence beginne to speake in her owne behalfe, when themselves have had a hand in af∣flicting of her, as appeares by Davids words to Me∣phibosheth, 2 Sam, 19. 29. Why speakest thou

any more of thine owne matters? but the Lord commands us to indeavour the reformation of those that erre, and therefore for the sake of such as did not at first rightly heare what J spake, J have now so spoken as they may see: Seneca saies, that people doe give better credit to their eyes then to their eares, and therefore here is Audibile turned to Visibile, what was transient, is become more constant, that (if they please) they may consider by seeing, whether they did not before mistake in hearing.
I hope in your Lordships judgement, an equall eye may herein discern such an impartiall spirit, as becomes a Minister of Christ to exercise in the discharge of his office: I blesse the Lord for it, I can say (with Elihu Iob 32. 21, 22. in Iob) J know not how to give slattering titles, J know not how to accept any mans person in speaking for God, or from him: He that will seeke to please Christ, must not seeke to please men, and he that will shoot at both extreanes, must looke to be shot at by both them: but peace at the last, will make amends for all, that crowne of righteonsnesse which God the 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. righteous Judge shall give to him, that from the te∣stimony of a good conscience can say at his death, I have fought a good fight, I have kept the faith, will more then recompence all sorrowes.
And (my Lord) although I will not attribute to your Honor Gods due, who alone doth frame and

governe spirits, yet this I must truly confesse, that your Lordships judgement, and the temper of your spirit, ath afforded much support and incouragement to mine, in that even, upright, and hated way: your constant dislike of the too much formality, and su∣perstitious incroachments of late times, did secretly animate my heart against that extreame, and strength∣en me under the pressures of it; And your fearefull tendernesse of walking in mens crypticke wayes, of set∣ting your foote among painted Sepulchers, hath on the other side given me much boldnesse in the discovering & opening them, and hath been as a speciall Antidote to preserve me from being over-daunted with the damp and paysonous infection which from thence hath sumed out upon me.
Thus (my Lord) it pleaseth God to make the good∣nesse of great persons (sometimes perhaps unwitting to themselves) to be as life and cordials to his Ministers.
I know your Lordship had rather be, then seeme re∣ligious; to doe good in secret, and then forget it, was your custome long ago; I remember ot the times past, (being a servant in your Grandfathers family, and an under Minister in that Parish) when I knew of any in want or misery, that were sicke, or lacked bread, for them and theirs, and did but goe in secret and tell you, the least intimation stirred your bowels, you appeared to my thoughts, aglad of an occasion to shew

your pity and bounty, as those afflicted were, in tasting of it; which was to me the language, not onely of a ge∣nerous, but also of a gracious spirit, for such kind of crypticke wayes doth God allow, herein his hidden ones delight to walke: And let the blessing of that God ever attend your Honour in them, and let the blessing of him that was ready to perish come upon you daily, Job 29. 13. let your goodnesse alway out-shine your greatnesse, for the comfort and incouragement of Gods servants, let sincerity and loyalty still remaine your constant sup∣porters, let them make you exemplary to all men here, and fit you fully at length, to weare the Robe and Diadem of perfect honour; so prayeth

From Rayne,
