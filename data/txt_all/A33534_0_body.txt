IN all Dedications, there is something of

design, self and interest; and to be true to you, that which made me single you out for a shield and shelter, was partly to gratisie the Stationer, who must needs thrive and fare the better, for coming under your Roof. And had the Book, no o∣ther worth in it, than that it bears so great a Flag and Canvass, as the name of your illustrious Father, it were enough

to make it sell, and re∣compence the Reader for buying it.
Another End I have in it (though you do  Epulari) is, to set before you some whole∣some and necessary Di∣rections for Diet; That being indeed, the best Physick and Physician, you and your Amiable La∣dy can ever hope to meet with, both to preserve your healths, and Pro∣long

your Lives; which so much concerns the Poor of this Town, City & Coun∣try, that they may call me cruel, if I do not all I can, that you may (to imitate in true Charity and Mu∣nificence your Renown∣ed Ancestors) long live and Prosper, which is the most passionate desire of your Servant and Neigh∣bour.
