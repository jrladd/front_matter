May it please your Grace,
IN Circumstances which put Men beyond the possibility of return∣ing Benefits, it is a Felicity that they are not as well deprived of means to testifie their Gratitude.
And were it my Happiness, that the

Dedication of this Book could con∣tribute to produce as kind an Effect for me, Your Grace would be intitu∣led to it by a manifold Claim and Right: Since as I began my growth in a Seminary of Learning plant∣ed by the late Memorable Duke of Ormond, so I have continued it un∣der the benign Influences of his Fa∣mily, and the House of Beaufort, in YourGrace's Service; and to the Ad∣vantages I have received from that, owe the All that I pretend to.
But, Madam, I could never hope that so mean a Present as this Trea∣tise, should find Acceptance with Your Grace, as a Testimony of my profound Respect and Gratitude, did not your eminent Practice of the Duty which it recommends, give me the assurance that a Subject so agreeable to your Inclination, will

prevail with you to excuse the weakness of my Performance, and that I am as happy as just, in my Application to your Patronage.
For, Madam, the refined Purity of your Life, which renders it the Subject of our Praise, as well as a Pattern for our imitation, con∣firms us, that your Thoughts have been successfully employ'd in the Care and Regulation of it; and that, because you want no Admo∣nitions to remind you of a Business so pleasing and familiar, you will encourage those Endeavours that tend to make it as much the World's, as it is Your Grace's Practice.
By this Piety, as exalted as your Quality, you make as glorious a Figure in the Church as in the Court, and are equally the Bles∣sing and the Ornament of those Illu∣strious

Families from which you are derived, and to whicd you are united; but Your Grace is withal so studious to avoid the Applause which you deserve, that unless I could as easily excuse my self to your Modesty and Humility, as those and your other Vertues would justifie me to the World, I must not attempt your Character, but pass in silence the Perfections which endear you to all who have the Happiness to know you, and make them as zealous to divulge your Excellencies, as Your Grace is to conceal them.
And though thus I seem unjust to Your Grace's Merit, I shall best consult my own interest, by this means; since the most successful Measures I can take to obtain your Pardon, and Acceptance of this

Address, will be not to mention the extraordinary Qualifications that require it from,
MADAM,
