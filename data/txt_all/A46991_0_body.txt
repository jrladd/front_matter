RIGHT HONORABLE,
THough few others would, I trust Your Lordship will vouchsafe countenance to these Commentaries, rude and imperfect I must confesse, but whose untimely or too hastie birth (if so it prove, and must be censured) hath not been caused by any inordinate appetite, but onely from a longing desire of testifying that love and duty which I owe unto your Honourable Familie and Person, as in many other respects, so chiefly in this: That being inga∣ged unto a more gainfull, but not so good a course of life, and well-nigh rooted in another soil; I was by your Lordships favourable advice and countenance trans∣planted to this famous Nursery of good learning. Wherein (by his blessing who onely gives increase to what his servants plant or water) I have grown to such a de∣gree of maturity, as these raw Meditations argue, or so wild a graft was capable of Course and unpleasant my fruit

may prove: but, whiles it shall please the Lord to continue his wonted blessings of health and other opportunities, alto∣gether unfruitfull (by his assistance) I will not, altogether idle I cannot, be. Such as these first fruits are (much bet∣ter I dare not promise,) the whole after-crop (I trust) shall be: both, for the sincerity of my intention, accepta∣ble (I doubt not) to my God; the later, I hope, more ripe in the judgement of men, then can in reason be expected the first fruits of the same mans labours should be. Thus hum∣bly beseeching your Honour to accept these as they are, and to esteem of them (howsoever otherwise) as an undoubted pledge of a minde indeavouring to shew it self thankfull for benefits already received; and much desiring the conti∣nuance of your honourable favours: I continue my pray∣ers unto the Almighty that he would multiply his best favors and blessings upon you.
