Right Worshipfull,
I Am bold to present you with these Papers, because you were not only audi∣tors of, but also much interessed in what they contain, they present you with a me nortall of a late head of yours, though untimely (as to your wished be∣nefit by him) cut off by the hand o death, providence so ordering that the lesser body should therein be the praeludium and forerunning reprelentation of a greater, of whom you bear the image and superscription: what was wan∣ting to his honour here by the shortnesse of his Maioralty, I have endeavour∣ed herein to supply, by adding to his memory, which though he need not for himself, yet in some things may be usefull for us, something it may afford us for instruction, something for imitation. He was a man of parts, that's known I think to all of us, and yet I have heard intelligent men say they were known to few; what they were would best have appeared in their improvement: but before you and he came to that point (as to Magistracy) he and they too were almost gone: there is something in that worthy of our instruction; when God gives you men of parts, make use of them (as to office) while ye may enjoy them, chiefly such as are also exemplary for piety, and worthy imitation: and such as have parts, be ye willing to improve them while ye have opportunity Post est occasia calvae.
When God presents us with a mercy, it's wisedom to meet i in the face, and not let it slide by us, till it be past recovery. He was a man of integrity, mercy, piety, one that affected ho∣nesty more then his honour, in these things he was worthy imitation. It's wisdom (so far a we may) to imitate in our selves whatsoever we are convinced of is good in others But have these Papers nothing else but a mention of him? perhaps your wisedoms may pick out something else, though through my little ability but weakly handled, yet that may afford some spirituall profit. If it be but to put you in minde of death: that's worth the thinking of, that well considered may make you the better while you live, but ndeed there are some other things that inclined me to the publishing it, chiefly the witnesse herein born against a threefold spreading and overcommon malady, one that deme, the extent of the Gospel-dectine of the death of Christ, and good will of God to sinners, something akinne to the old Pharisaison, that would tie it up to the elect, the lews and people proselvted into themselves, whom they therefore also judged of the same election with themselves: denying it to Publicans and sinners not so regulated, and to uncircumcised gentile (the body and generality of them) not so proselyted. The second is the common prohannesse of superficiall Christians and turners of the grace and Go∣spel f Christ into wantonness, that rest in a name and notion of Christianity, but deny the pow∣er of it, of which sort there are every where too many, The third is the sect of the Sadduces, that deny the resurrection, the visible coming of Christ personally again, and the glorious per∣formance of the promises at that his appearing, a too too spreading generation. May God make it usefull to you to leade you besides all these tocks, in the true ancient Scripture-doctrine and faith formerly also attested to in the Church in England, so to embrace and love the promised salvation, and so to follow the steps of this good man, and of other Worthies that have gone before him, in the belief of and hearty love to, closing with an entertainment of the Word of God, that it may produce like fruits in you as in them, unto death and in death, that you with them also may partake of the glorious resurrection unto life and happinesse, I shall have cause of much rejoicing: The fountain of mercy and wisedom flow down upon you, sill you with truth, with peace and righteousnesse, direct and blesse you, and make you blessings in your places and generations, So praieth,
