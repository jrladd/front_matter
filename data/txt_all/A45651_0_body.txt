IT is common with many Poets to Varnish o're the defects of their
Poems either by a little aected Satyr in the Preface and Prologue,
or by the Nobility of the Patron; but for an under-graduate, the fit∣tist
Sanctuary to receive and protect his first fruits, shou'd be the Elder
Choire of Poets, for there the Subiect may more aptly improve his
Thoughts, and there (if any Genius glimmers through the Clowds) the
Gold is entertain'd, and the dross either refin'd or forgot. I speak not
this to excuse the many errors of this indigested, trifle (for indeed such
confusion and uncertainty attended it, both at it's conception, and birth,
that they became unavoidable,) but to render my boldness more law∣full,
at least more pardonable, in committing all together to your Pa∣tronage.
But yet to intitle you to Poetry, were too mean an acknow∣ledgment,
who have engrost all that can be call'd A description of Nature.
Poets at best but give a distant View of her to our purblinde imaginati∣os,
which often doubles, or falsifies the object, confounds Chimera's
with the most simple beings, and so rather represent her in her infant
Chos, than her present perfection. But you Sir, draw the Veil and ex∣pose
her bare-face to our senses, the most proper and Adaequate Judges
of it. Here we see Art tryumphing over her, and waiting Cupids pour∣ing
all their mothers Charms into your Pencill; here we may behold
more Divinity in one draught, then in that Peice for which Apelles
ransack't all the Beauties of the Earth and his own fertile imagination
to cll out a Veuus. Of this you have given a sufficient evidence, in a∣dorning
the Court with so many Stars, which shall shine thro' your co∣lours,
when time has faded, and the Grave immured their own. For
Painting being at such a noble height as you Sir have rais'd it to, carries
more prevailing influence, than all the languid efforts of our enervate
Pens. But it were as vain to attempt a particular Encomium of what I un∣derstand
not, as to deny it's excellency, which the greatest Stupidity
must confess with silence, and the greatest malice with a forc'd admiration.
Pardon me Sir, If in dwelling upon so pleasing a Subject, I have for∣got
that I am arguing for what is beyond the Verge of dispute, and kept
you long in the Portall, that I have reason to fear you may be tir'd be∣fore
you Survey the whole building; but if it affords you any diversion,
I shall not complain of any reception it has already, or may meet with
in it's more publick dress, but content my self that it gives me this op∣pertunity
to testify how much I am
