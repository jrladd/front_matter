May it please Your Highness,
SHould I either of ignorance, or as fearing to presume (as it may be call'd) not Dedicate this to You, yet the thing it self so relates to Your Highness, as that it self∣ly doth it, do I what I can: I hope then it will not be notion'd Presumption, if I bear it company, and come along with it in these Lines, reverently to dictate for it, as Aa∣ron for Moses, also, as so postur'd, to wait
on your Highness, and withal, to crave pardon, if I make bold to subscribe my self
