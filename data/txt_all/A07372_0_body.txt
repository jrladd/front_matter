YOur approbation of that Sermon which was preached at the Assises last in Dor∣chester, with your good countenance, and louing speeches, which it pleased you then to vse vnto mee for the same: hath emboldened me, and made me pre∣sume, to let it come to the view of the world; for which I humbly intreat your fauourable acceptation, and your Patronage and Protection against them that shall bee found auerse or with any sinister affection to taxe or tra∣duce the same. Thus wishing vnto you yours, many good and ioyfull New-yeares, with the best welfare and happinesse, that can be desired or imagined, I leaue you to the Shepheard and Bishop of our soules; and rest,
Catistocke, Ian. 1.
