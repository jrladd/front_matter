Most Reverend and Honoured,
I Beg leave humbly to present you with these First-fruits of my Labours in that Station which you have been pleased to assign me for this Year; Taking this Occasion both to acknow∣ledge publickly, and with all Thankfulness the Honour you have done me in appointing me to this Work; and likewise to give you Assurance that the After-fruits shall also in due Time be offered to you, if God shall be pleased to give them a Season to ripen; And I heartily wish they may be better and more worth your Acceptance than I am sensible these are.
However, I hope the same Goodness and kind Opinion of me which moved you to nominate me to
 the Employment will incline you to forgive all my Failings in the Management of it.
And if my Labours shall be well accepted by you; And especially, If by the Blessing of God, (who only giveth the Increase) they shall any Ways contribute toward the Promoting the pious Design of the Honourable Founder of these Le∣ctures, of blessed Memory, I shall be very easie under the too just Charge of Insufficiency for such an Ʋndertaking, which I make no Doubt will be cast upon me by those who will be inwardly glad that I have performed my Task no better, and will earnestly wish that the Christan Cause may never have an abler Advocate.
But that by your wise Choice of Persons to succeed in this Employment, they may see them∣selves every Year disappointed in this their Wish, is the hearty Desire of,
Most Reverend and Honoured,

Feb. 26. 1699/700.
