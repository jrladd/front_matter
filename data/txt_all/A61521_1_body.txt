My Lord,
SInce Your Lordships going from
London, Mr. Cressy's Epistle Apo∣logetical
to a Person of Honour
touching his Vindication of Dr. Stil∣lingfleet
came to my hands; and bears

date, from his Cell, March 21. A. D.
1674. being the Anniversary day of
S. Benedict. And he is not only
thus punctual in the date of his
Epistle, but he begins it with a very
particular account, in what man∣ner
the Person of Honour's Book
was sent to him; viz. by the Letter-Post,
but partly to abate charges and
likewise to disguise the shape of a Book,
it was folded up in loose sheets with all
the Margins close pared to the very
quick. After I had observed so
much niceness in these, not very
material circumstances, I could
hardly expect that the least
line of the Book should escape
without numbering the words,
syllables, and letters in it, and
giving every one a distinct and
punctual confutation. But I
soon found several considera∣ble
parts gently passed over,

and indeed by the very bulk of his
Book, I presently perceived, that
he was more curious to give the
World an account, how the other
came to him, than careful to an∣swer
it. For if he had treated
every thing that was of like mo∣ment
with equal exactness, it
might very well have passed for
the Second Tome of his Ecclesiastical
History. And in truth, the matter
of some part of it, is not much un∣like,
for he tells so long a story in
the middle of it of the Kindness of
some and the unkindness of others in
England to him, and of the Books he
had written, that it looked very like
a Legend of himself; only I do not
find any Miracles he had done in any
of them.
Before he comes to his Apologie
for himself, he takes great care to

make me understand the mighty
obligation laid upon me, by that
Person of Honour, who was pleased
with so much Kindness to under∣take
my Vindication from the im∣petuous
assaults of an enraged Ad∣versary.
Which I was so justly
sensible of before, that Mr. Cressy
might have spared his pains; for
surely it was no small Favour to be
delivered from the paws of so fierce
a Creature, as he appeared to be in
his former Book; but to have it
done in so obliging a manner, by
a Person of so great Honour and Abi∣lities,
was as much beyond my pre∣sumption
to hope for, as it is now
above my Power to requite. I
with I were a Person of that Credit
and Interest to be able to express
my Gratitude in that very way
Mr. Cressy directs me to; for of all
things I desire to avoid the odious

character and brand of Ingratitude.
But since I make so small a Figure
in publick affairs, the utmost I can
do, is to save that Honourable Per∣son
the farther trouble of making
Animadversions on this Epistle Apolo∣getical.
Which is written with that
shew of humility and respect, that
those who look only on the appear∣ance,
would imagine him strange∣ly
come off from the rage and fury
he was in, when he writ his for∣mer
Book; but if we observe more
carefully his sly reflections and
crafty insinuations, we shall find
that he hath only learnt to dissem∣ble
his passion, and to do the same
mischief with a fawning Counte∣nance.
The first part of his Epistle is
wholly spent in Vindication of him∣self
as to the sharpness of Style and

bitter Invectives he had used against
me, which I shall briefly consider
before I come to the more material
parts of his Book.
