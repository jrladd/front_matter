May it please your most Excellent Majesty,
THE Subject of the subsequent discourse,
(For which I shall incurr the Jesuits Curse)
And that brave Duke (chiefly concerned) too,
Illustrious Prince, no Strangers are to you.
I could not (when his Letter I had read)
Forbear (though something late) his Fame to spread.
Whose zeal for true Religion here I have
Display'd too meanly, for a Prince so brave.
However, for His sake I do request
Your Highness Patronage (which is the best)
Of this Encomium, written by the hand
Of him that ever rests at your Command.
