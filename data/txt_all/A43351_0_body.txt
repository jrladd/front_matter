My Lord,
YOur known indulgence, even of the meanest Essayes to the advance of Pi∣ety, Peace, and Prudence; gives boldness to these imper∣fect

lines to implore your Lordships Correction; not that this Glow-worm means an addition of Light to so great a Sun, or to instruct a person so transcendently qualified with all knowledge: it only beggs the dew of your benigne aspect, that it may live; and if by its Glimmerings there may be an encrease of light to the darker World, I have my reward; however this Mite of my first endeavours owes its being to your Lordships favour; upon whose Per∣son, Family, and Concerns, that all kind of Blessings may be multiplyed, shall be

the continued Intercession of him who prayes to be ac∣cepted
