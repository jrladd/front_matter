To whome
ON Earth, rather then to you, (blessed & bles∣sing Mother) should I direct my Supplicati∣ons, Deprecations, and my Thankes? Seeing by Gods grace and your prudent patience amidst so many sore tryals, I haue yet a breathing time left; & may for a while sit downe, contemplate and admire: O the vnspeakeable loue of God, in reducing me in∣to

nesse of my pollutions, made mee both afraid and a∣shamed to point at mine owne deformities. Incum∣bred I was with many thoughts how to discouer my minds change; & how to walke for the time to come, and yet after a few daies, I could not but disclose it: It was within me like a fire in my bones, I was weary with forbearing and could not stay, and I resolued that it was both my duty and safetie to addresse my selfe to those whose lips preserue knowledge, and hands authoritie. If a Leaper was to shew himselfe to the Priest, and such as were full of vncured Blaines and Sores, to shew themselues to the High Priest: why should I bee afraid to present my selfe in my Scars to the Guides and Gouernours of this Church, for the glorifying of that grace which purged my Corruptions, and healed my Sores? I therfore forth∣with addressed mee to the most Reuerend Father of this renowmed Church, by him imploring reconci∣liation to my iustly offended Mother: And since, how open hath her bosome beene to her returning sonne, how ioyfully hath shee receiued, readily in∣structed, and willingly restored me to my sacred Of∣fice againe: and how blessedly haue some beene re∣duced by my weake helpe into the the way of peace: from which they had swerued with me, (though not all by me) I am not able to expresse with Pen. Nei∣ther shall I cease to vse all my industrie to bring again all that haue straied by my word or example, as by my Mothers leaue I shall bee authorized so to doe: seeing through Gods Mercie they are not manie, and those that are, no way dangerous, being such as haue little force to perswade any, and the most such as im∣braced

those things, without my aduice, and some contrarie to my iudgement at that time: and as I haue publiquely by preaching againe proclaimed my true change, so shall I priuately by practise con∣firme it to all with whom I shall conuerse (by Gods grace) vnto my liues end.
And who am I, that I should be any more trouble∣some to so indulgent and gracious a Mother? No verily, I shal neuer forget her mercie, wisdome, boun∣tie, and meekenesse towards one so farre gone, though I should participate no more of her loue: And I am the more bold to disclose my whole heart vnto her, because she knowes that greater, more emi∣nent, learned, and glorious members, haue had their foule slips. And though I for beare to name any, lest some should think I doe parallel my selfe with them: nor had we any to name either vnder the Law or Gospel, as examples to induce vs to be willing to ac∣knowledge own our deformities; for the magnifying Gods Mercie, edifying his Church, and humbling our selues: yet we cannot but know, that there is no∣thing so couered that shall not be reueiled, nor hidden that shall not be knowne. Neither shall hidden things of darkenesse, lurke alwaies in secret. The Lord will come, and all mens sinnes shall be layed o∣pen: such as goe not before to iudgement to their sauing, they must follow after to their eternall tor∣ment. Neither can I conceiue, that in this light, and loue of the Gospel, in the middest of true Israelites, in whom is no guile; especially in the knowledge of my tender Mother, any derider shall be suffered to disport himselfe with the nakednesse not of a father,

but a failing brother: or any scoffing Ismaclite, to mocke at Isaacs minoritie, or any vncharitable incon∣siderate brother, to vpbraid with what hath beene formerly done; much lesse, any Idolatrous Rabsa∣keh, to raile on the least seruant of God. But that on any such iust occasion giuen, it shal be lawful for such as haue an heart to the combate, to enter the lists a∣gaine, in the spirit of Meekenesse, though onely with a sling, and such smooth stones as may be chosen in our holy riuer of life. And in the confidence of this later, with the excitement of those former motiues, I am incouraged to penne what is done, concerning the Christian Libertie I doe now vnderstand. And though I am yet farre short of what my most iudici∣ous Mother may expect for my large time; yet well knowing, that she is so like our Lord of glorie, that she hath learned long since, to accept of weak works, where she perceiues willing mindes, according to what her children haue, and not according to what they haue not: I now rest, and am resolued to re∣remaine, though of late seemingly departed for a sea∣son, yet sincerely returned for euer,
