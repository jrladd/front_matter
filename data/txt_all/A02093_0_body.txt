NEwes▪ and greene Bushes at Tauerns
new set vp; euery man hath his Penny
to spend at a Pint in the one, and euery
man his Eare open to receiue the sound
of the other. It is the language which
at first meetings is vsed in all Countries,
What Newes? In Court, tis the Mor∣ninges
Salutations; and Noones table-talke;
by Night it is stale. In Cittie, tis more common, then,
What doe you lake? And in the Countrie, Whistling at Plough
is not of greate Antiquitie. Walke the middle Ile in Pauls,
and Gentlemens teeth walke not faster at Ordinaries, then
there a whole day togeather, about inquirie after Newes.
Newes then, being a Fish that's caught euery day, and yet a
Meate for euery mans Table; I thinke it not amisse to inuite
all men to a Feast of such Newes, as haue of late come in shoales
into my Net. I will not hold a Bird in a Cage to sing strange
Notes to my selfe, but let her foorth to delight others: And
albeit (about some two or three yeares past) the vgly faces of

diuers dambde abuses, were set naked vpon euery Post, their
Vizards being flead off, both by  and Candle-light,
and by the Belman of London: Yet Villanie when it runns to
seed, being of all other Graines the most fruitefull and luxuri∣ant,
the Candlelight was burnt to a Snuffe, and the Belman fast
asleepe before these Monsters which now are hatcht foorth,
creeped out of their Dennes.
In Westminster, the Strand, Hlburne, and the chiefe places of
resortes about London, doe they euery day build their Nestes,
euery hower ge▪ and in Teare  especially fltter they
abroad in flockes: You shall know them by their Fethers. And
because for the most part, they flye in payres, (a Cocke and a
Henne togeather), Behold a couple newly alighted on the
Pearch; a Hee-Foyst, and a Shee-Foyst: What they chirrup out,
their owne Voyces can best deliuer▪ and therefore listen to
them. Suppose you heare the first of them setting foorth a
throate thus.
