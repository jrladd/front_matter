THE Ends I aim'd at in this Dis∣course were, to do the Church right, to take off unreasonable Pre∣judices, and to perswade Men to the Com∣munion of the best established Church in the World. And the same (I humbly presume) were intended by your Order for the pub∣lishing it: I do not apologize for the weak∣ness
(though I am conscious of it) yuor Commands warrant its Publication; and Obedience is part of the Religion of every Member of the Church of England. I therefore only add my Prayers, that God would bless all Endeavours that tend to the undeceiving the People, and settling them in Unity, Peace and Loyalty; not only for your Lordship and the Honourable Court (whose Ʋndertakings in this kind are very remarkable) but also for every good Man in the Nation.
