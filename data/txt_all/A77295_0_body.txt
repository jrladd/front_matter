TO the Saints of God in all the world, especially the Godly Ma∣gistrates and Ministers of this Land, and the Kingdom of Scotland: To you do I earnest∣ly desire of God grace and Peace may be day∣ly multiplyed; beseeching each of you in your severall places, to have especially care of preser∣ving the peace of the people of God, knowing how easie a matter it is to occasion a War, Re∣ligion being made the ground thereof: How were the Heathens stirred up to fight for their Idol-gods; how did Papists fight for Popery? And its not long since we had a War for Epis∣copacie; the Lord grant our War end not in a War for Presbyterie or Independencie. I have written this ensuing Tract without leaning to any partee, desiring a friendly acceptation of al; desiring, if possibly, to have here by the truth discovered, which is onely able to unite us in
Iudgement, and make us one, which War can never do, but rather bring us all to nothing; and remember Christ dyed to prevent the death and destruction of Saints, and God is stiled the preserver of men, whom we ought in this to imitate: let us lay aside all affected∣ness to any way of our own, and diligently search after truth, though never so much con∣trary to our selves, our way and practise sub∣mitting to the way of God in the Scriptures, as that onely is to be walked in, though never so difficult to be erected, in which onely is peace and Righteousness to be found; and if there be any thing contained in the ensuing Tract, that may farther the ends proposed in the Church of God, I shall greatly rejoyce, for which I shal earnestly seek the Lord night and day, as in du∣ty I am bound to do, and rest,
