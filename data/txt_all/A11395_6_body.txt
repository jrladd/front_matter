GReat Strong-bowe's heir, no self-cōceipt doth cause
Mine humble wings aspire to you, vnknowne:
But, knowing this, that your renown alone
(As th' Adamant, and as the Amber drawes:
That, hardest steel; this, easie-yeelding strawes)
Atterrs the stubborn, and attracts the prone:
I haue presum'd (O Honors Paragon!)
To graue your name (which all Iberia awes)
Heer on the fore-front of this little Pile;
T'inuite the vertuous to a sacred feast,
And chase-away the vicious and the vile;
Or stop their lothsom enuious tongues (at least).
If I haue err'd, let my submission scuse:
And daign to grace my yet vngraced Muse.
