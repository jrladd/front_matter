MY LORD,
YOUR Grace being not
only by Your Place and
Station, but by Your own
Choice and voluntary Act,
the Grand Patron of our Reli∣gion,
it cannot be improper
to present You with these
brief Papers, which, though

in themselves very mean and
inconsiderable, and unworthy
of Your Grace's View, are
a Vindication of that Holy
Cause against the repeated
Cavils and bold Insults of
Atheistical Spirits, who (as
Your Grace with a very deep
Resentment and RegretSermon of the Folly of Atheism. Sermon at the Queen's Funeral. ob∣serves)
are of late grown ve∣ry
numerous. How vigorous∣ly
Your Lordship hath attack∣ed
this sort of Men, is well
known to the World; and
that hitherto they have not
been able to bring about their
impious Designs, is in great
part owing to Your Lord∣ship's

successful Attempts. I
presume, from the Encourage∣ment
which so Illustrious an
Example hath given me, to
engage in the same Cause,
that is, to lay open the Folly
and Absurdity of their Preten∣ces,
and withall to discover
some of those Heads and
Springs whence the Atheistick
Apprehensions of these present
Times arise, and whereby
they are fed and nourished.
Which I hope will be of good
use to those who desire to be
caution'd against the Venom
of this Raging Evil, and will
in some measure operate even
on those who are infected and

corrupted with it already.
I am sensible how Precious
Your Grace's Minutes are in
this time of extraordinary Bu∣siness
and Emergency; and
therefore I will not be injuri∣ous
to the Publick by any
farther Applications to Your
Grace. Only I superadd my
hearty Prayers for Your
Health and long Life, where∣in
the Common Welfare and
Happiness both of Church
and State are so much invol∣ved:
And so I subscribe my self,
