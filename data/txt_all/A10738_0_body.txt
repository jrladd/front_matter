Right Honourable,
AS it pleased God to giue better approbation to this poore Ser∣mon in the de∣liuering of it, then I expected: I haue beene

earnestly intreated since, by some of my good friends, to giue way that it might bee printed. And though I am not ignorant of mine own inability: yet because I know that God can, and doth worke, as well by weake, as by greater meanes; I haue yeelded to their request. I confesse it is written in a rude & homely stile, and I doubt not, but the curious censurers of this age, who like nothing but that which is for their owne humors, will carpe & cauill at the plainenesse of it: but my desire was to make it appear, that as Barnard sayeth, in the like case, I rather sought Edi∣fication then Ostentation. Now be∣cause the meanes of that mainte∣nance

which I haue, is chiefly by your honourable fauour, I haue therefore presumed to publish it vnder your Honours name. And howsoeuer there be nothing in it worthy your Honours contem∣plation: yet I beseech you to ac∣cept of it as a poore testimony of that dutiful affection which most deseruedly I owe vnto you. The Lord blesse your Honour with increase of all sauing graces, that you may long be a profitable in∣strument of his glory, both in the Church, and in the common wealth.
