BY how much the more I know my self obliged in gene∣ral, and in particular to your most noble Country, and the more I go about accusing my self a Debtor for so many Favours and Benefits in the same con∣tinually received, so much the less I have always hitherto found my self in a Capacity to express that great and inward desire I have to do some Act that may be grateful to you; and con∣sidering with my self I ought to give you some little sign of my good Will, and of my great regard and good Remembrance of you; and that the longer I defer it, the more it ought to answer the debt I owe: Newly returned from his Holiness's the Popes Pallace, and fearing I might seem to be like the e∣vil Servant, in the Gospel, who hid the Talent received at the Courtesie of his Patron, I here present you with a List, (I there obtained) of the publick Treasure, that although it be yet so much unknown in many other Cities, it may be now known to you, who are the holy Company of our habit, given by the ever Virgin, the Mother of the Son of God; the which you accepting, as I hope you will, and Conjure you that ye so do, you have all the Indulgences, may be gained by the
Brothers and Sisters of our Company, in this little Book; which giving to you, together I dedicate and consecrate to you, beseeching you to place this laudable Inscription in our Church of the Servants, accompanying the same to the Altar of the most holy Crucifix with your Society; to the end that in Life and in Death you may obtain a double Treasure, and Patronage, and so Precious as these two are; the which joyntly in the dangerous Navigation of this world, the one will be the Ship, and the other the Star, to the port of Sal∣vation. The gift is not small because it is a gift Spiritual; neither ought the respect to be small that is had thereto, in regard of the great Benefit that may accrue thereby. And for a Credit and truth of what is therein contained, I have caused the same to be confirmed with the great Seal of our Office, and have subscribed the same with mine own hand. Dated at Florence in our Convent della Nonciata, the ninth day of February, 1599.
