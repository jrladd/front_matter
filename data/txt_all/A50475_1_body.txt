CHop-fallen Plaintiffs or Defendents;
Sectists, Separists, Independents,
Presbyterians that are whiter
Then Lawne-Sleeves or any Miter.
Crop-ear'd Zimri's, Sequestrators,
Statists, Truckers, Timists, Traitors.
Haxsters, Huxsters, or Promotors,
Farriers, Furriers, or Free-booters,
Broakers, Breakers, Brewers, Bakers,
Braggadoches, High-way-takers.
Sergeants, Catch-pools, or Regraters;
Cheats, Comittee-dis-estators:
Or Assemblies curst for ever
Make a Preacher of a Weaver.
All who headlong by their medling
Make our whimzed State a Bedlam.
Counting it lighter then a fether
To ruine Church and State together.
Trepenners, Pimps, Prinadoe's, Nippers,
Tarpaulins, Currers, Quakers, Dippers,
Whifflers, Shufflers, Heavers, Hectors,
Sharks, Excisers, Ale-Collectors.
Spanger, Spooner, Spurrier, Spinster,
And our Saintlings at Westminster.
With that Royall-loyall true sort
That of late did treat at Newport.
Et complere vatis Somnium,
CAESARI, uni instar omnium.
