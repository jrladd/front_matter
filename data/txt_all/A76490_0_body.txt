My Lord,
THAT I take the Boldness to make this Dedication to your Lordship, is not, that I can make the least pretension to be Known to, or to Know your Lordship; but as you are on such an Eminence, you cannot be hid; and as a Luminary of the Nation, every Eye is upon you.

 But yet I have made this Presumption on Great Reasons.
First, That, the Truths I offer in the en∣suing Treatise, are so little consider'd, or Receiv'd; that they are under a Necessity to remove from the Rigor of Prejudicate Opinion, and to make Appeal to the Chan∣cery of a most Equitable Review.
Then, that I have much Reason to be perswaded, your Lordship hath in pecu∣liar manner, in the Greatness of your Ap∣prehension, the Noble Freedoms of a solid Judgment, and most condescending Chri∣stian Temper, a truly High Court of Chan∣cery in your own Breast; and will allow it to sober Proposals of Truth, Analogous to Faith, and Christian Morality, however Old Bottles, and Palates refuse New Wine; New to them, not so in it self; but spoken of by All the Prophets since the World began.
Another Great Reason I have, is, That tho I pretend to no Prognosticks, except Ju∣stified
 by the Sure Word of Prophecy; yet, speaking humanely, it is very probable your Lordship shall continue in your High Administration till 97. and then I have Great Assurance, it will be capable of be∣ing made much Higher, and more Ho∣nourable, by the Kingdom of that Great Prince of the Kings of the Earth coming in∣to its Succession: Wherein, undoubtedly, every Character of Humane Honour; Ap∣pointed, and Justified by his Word, and seated in Persons ready to Kiss the Son, and pay Homage to him; will receive un∣expressible Additions.
And hereunto I add, That it is most Reasonable, so publick a Personage, and that bears, as is said, the Conscience of the Go∣vernment, and so fittest to make Judgment on such a Point; should have both the No∣tices and the State of so great a Thing laid before him, and before the whole Nation in him.

 Lastly, Although I very well know how Great a Prince I herein serve, and do most Freely, submit, as to my self, to his turning your Heart this way, or that way, as the Rivers of Water; yet I think it no way disagreeing to my Duty, according to his present Dispose, to desire such a Patro∣nage as that of your Lordship; that I might rest under your shadow; and wait for the mighty Ratifications of All I have writ on so great a Subject; by Mighty Power.
It is now (My Lord) Ten Years, since I first made Publick the Prophetick Calendar of Time; and I have not found Reason to Vary from the First Moments, on which I Fix'd it; but have receiv'd Greater Addi∣tions of Light, and Assurance, as I have continually, and publickly Remonstrated; and yet I have always, and do ftill disown all things Enthusiastick, and am upon the plain Principles of Letter of Scripture,
 Scripture Arguments, according to the most undoubted Chronology, and History; and so offer my self Freely to the Attack of All that can bring Contrary Reasons: And have now, as in a Chancery Proceed∣ing, presented the Case to your Lordship; Let him that finds Reason, in the same Way, put in his Answer.
A Greater Cause, than this cannot come before your Lordship; Whether the Books of the Prophets of the New and Old Testament have declar'd such a Glorious, Visible King∣dom of Christ; Whether they have declar'd it shall be First in Succession, preparing for its Glory by an Universal Preaching of the Gospel, as by a Flying Angel, seal'd with the Return of Miracles; For All this I af∣firm; And whether they have given a Line of Time, Determining that Succession to 1697. For such a Line I affirm also, and have produc'd it, from the Sure Word o Prophecy, by a Charter for Interpretation.

 Now may that Supreme Prince, whom I declare, who is Essential Wisdom, by whom Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Ju∣stice; Even the Judges, and All the Coun∣sellors of the Earth see in his Light; (And who is so nigh Coming, as I affirm, to Reign in his own Name;) Guide your Lordship in all the things, that concern your own immortal Spirit; in all the Ar∣duous Matters of so High a Judicature; and particularly a Rich and Glorious entrance into his Everlasting Kingdom I now present, as,
My Lord,
