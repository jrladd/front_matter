RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
Truely; though I am vnder tender yea∣res:

yet my ambition so∣re's so high, as to call your Excellence the Pa∣tron of this my Treatise. My lovv degree, then myne age, to censure strictly, alas, suite not properly, to offer vp aught in this nature vnto your Honour: Deigne though in your benigni∣ty, to connive at this my boldness: for vvhich I cannot produce express defence: vnless this may agree vvith your propi∣tiousness,

that it may not seeme vnto you amiss, to bee honour'd by each one, even from shrub to Cedar.
Right honourable,
