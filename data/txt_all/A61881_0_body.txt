WHen I first entered upon the pra∣ctise
of Physick, I had the Ho∣nour
of your Testimonial: and
I now publickly acknowledge as
well your favours, as that worth,
which is universally known, and admired.
Were I to celebrate your Panegyrick, I should
not doubt to represent you as a second to Har∣vey:
and I should not fear the resentments of
others, if I compared him to Phrynis, whilest
you are the Timotheus in Physick. But this
is not my present Designe; but to tell you, I have
finished the Discourse I promised you, of Cho∣colata:
and I have augmented it beyond my
thoughts, or yours. This Writing, as well
as the Chocolata I presented to His Majesty,
wants that perfection, which Time was to give
it; I wish it have so good fortune, to please,
as that did. I shall from Jamaica give you

a better Book, and (I believe) better Cho∣colata.
And it is my resolution so to employ
my self there, that I may not fail the expecta∣tion
so many Eminent Persons have of me;
nor will I ever see England, but with the satis∣faction
of having done something considerable.
That you may know how great Incentives I
have to study, besides my own unspeakable
inclinations; There are more then ordina∣rily
interested in me, besides the King's Ma∣jesty;
who alone is so great a promoter, and
so competent a judg of merit, that to an In∣genuous
Person there needs no farther induce∣ment
to deserve. But, besides Him, there is
the Honourable Robert Boyle Esquire, Dr.
Quatremain, Dr. rasier, Physicians to His
Majesty, and several other Honourable and
Learned Personages. But, amidst so many con∣curring
favourers, and abettours, if I tell you,
that I allow a peculiar esteem, and remem∣brance
for Dr. Willis, it is no more, then the
real sentiments of one, who infinitely admires
you, who is
Sir,

London, April
12. 1662.
