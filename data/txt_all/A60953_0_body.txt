Reverend and Learned Sirs,
SInce the Work, I here present you with, needs so great a Patronage, it were to be wished, that it could bring something with it, besides the Cause defended by it, worthy of such Patrons, as I address it to. But, as much below you, as I know it to be, I could think of none, to whom I could so properly apply my self, as Those, whose emi∣nent Stations in our Vniversities have made them the Fit∣test, as well as Ablest to countenance a Defense of so high a Point, and so vital a Part of our Religion. Our Church's Enemies of late seem to have diverted their main Attacks from her Out-Works in matters of Discipline and Ceremo∣ny; and now, it is no less than her very Capitol which they invade; her Palladium (if I may allude to such Ex∣pressions) which they would rob her of; even the Prime, the Grand, and Distinguishing Article of our Christianity, the Article of the Blessed Trinity it self; without the Be∣lief of which, I dare aver, that a Man can no more be a Chri∣stian, than he can, without a Rational Soul, be a Man. And this is now the Point so fiercely laid at, and assault∣ed both by Socinianism on the one hand, and by Tritheism or rather Paganism on the other. For, as the former would run it down by stripping the Godhead of a Ternary of Persons, so the other would as effectually, but more scan∣dalously overthrow it by introducing a Trinity of Gods; as they inevitably do, who assert the Three Divine Per∣sons to be Three distinct Infinite Minds, or Spirits;

which I positively affirm, is equivalent to the asserting the said Three Persons to be Three Gods. And I doubt not of your learned Concurrence with me, and Abettment of me in this Affirmation.
And I do moreover refer it to your profound, and known Learning, to consider and to judge, whether ever the Catho∣lick Church explained the Trinity by Self-Consciousness, as that [wherein] the Personality, Personal Unity, and Distinction of each of the Divine Persons does proper∣ly and formally consist: and by Mutual Consciousness, as that [wherein] consists the Essential Unity of the said Persons, and [whereby] they are all Three essentially one God: together with several other such like Terms set down in the Collection immediately subjoined to this Epistle: And lastly, whether the Primitive Church having decreed, and denounced an Anathema to all Vsers of any  in these Mysteries, the Church of England, and the Nurseries thereof, the Universities, ought to suffer the greatest Mystery of our Christian Faith to be perplexed, confounded, and even ridiculed by this Man's pretending to explain it by such odd, Vncouth, as well as new Expressi∣ons; which were never entertained as Terms of any Note or Vse even in Philosophy, till Des Cartes and his Fol∣lowers introduced them; and that without the least thought (that appears) of applying them to the Trinity. I desire, I say, all our Learned Divines seriously to consider, what this must tend to, and will, in all likelihood, end in.
The Arguments which this daring Innovator (whom I write against) pretends to support his Tritheism, and In∣novations by, are but slight and trivial; or rather indeed bare bold Assertions without Arguments: And those also (in the Opinion of most) so throughly broken, and confuted already, that what they need more, is rather a Discounte∣nance, than a Confutation. Nor indeed is there any

thing formidable in the whole Book, (which I have here answered) but that one word appearing in the Front of it, viz. [licensed]: and that I must confess looks very formi∣dably and threatningly, both upon our Church and Religion: and it cannot but go to the heart of every Well-wisher to Both, to consider what Advantage our watchful Enemies the Papists will be sure to make of it; who in such Cases never fail to take whatsoever is given them.
And now, Reverend Sirs, what can my design be in thus applying my self to you? Surely it is not so to offer you my poor Iudgment, as at all to prescribe to Yours. No; I understand you and my self too well, to be guilty of so sottish a Presumption; Nor is it to put you upon writing Books against this Innovator; for that I think extreamly below you. But since the World has heard of such a Thing, as the Decretum Oxoniense (and that so justly to the Cre∣dit of that Vniversity;) If now, Both our Vniversities would concur in passing their Theological Censure upon such Propositions as have of late so much impugned our Faith, and disgraced our Church; as that of Oxford had passed before upon such Doctrines, as undermined and struck at our Civil Government, (as I think all Christians should be at least as zealous for the former, as for the lat∣ter) it could not but highly vindicate the Honour of the Church of England, the Orthodoxy of our Clergy, and of our Two great Seminaries of Learning; which, I assure you, many Foreigners (how undeservedly soever) begin to be something suspicious of, and dissatisfied about, by rea∣son of some late Books published amongst us, and not yet answered by us. And for what concerns this Author's first Discourse concerning the Trinity, I have been assured from a very Authentick hand, corresponding with several Per∣sons of Note for Learning in Germany, that it had gi∣ven no small offence to the Divines abroad; and particu∣larly,

that those learned Gentlemen at Lipsick (who write the Transactions) would have censured the new, Heterodox Notions, and equally new, and unjustifiable Expositions of Scripture (which it is full of, and those not wholly unreflect∣ed upon by them neither,) at much another rate, than they have done in the Remarks of the Year 1691. p. 216. but that out of a peculiar respect to the Church of England, they forbore, in expectation that some Divine of her own Com∣munion would undertake the Confutation of it. And there∣fore since those Animadversions upon it, came out so oppor∣tunely, as an Answer to so just an Expectation, as well as to so Ill a Book; which had both given such offence to foreign Churches, and brought such Scandal upon our own, I hope this Defence of them will find an Acceptance worthy of Those Great Injured Truths asserted in that Discourse, and re-asserted in this. For, high time certainly it is, for all who heartily espouse the Concerns of our Excellent Church (so Practised upon on all Hands) now, if ever, to appear for Her; Considering, That from a New Christianity (the Grand Project of some of late) the Natural and Next step is to None.
And so, Reverend Sirs, to create you no further trou∣ble, having with all the Respect and Reverence due to such great and renowned Bodies, given you an account of the Oc∣casion of this Address to you, as a Thing well deserving your most serious Thoughts, and representing the cause of our Venerable, Old Religion now at stake, (as in truth it is) I humbly leave the whole matter before you, and remain
