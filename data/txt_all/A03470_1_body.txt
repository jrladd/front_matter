WHat is she that like siluer Cynthia shoeth
Amidst the hoast of heauen,
But fairer three times seauen?
It is the Queene of Loue, see where she goeth.
The Queene of Loue and Beauty, (lo) together
With her faire son the Prince of Loue comes hether



The Southpole that in our Horizon shined,
And made the Earth to wonder,
Gone is that Earth all vnder,
And to the Northpole hath her roome resigned:
On whom to waite our Eyes and Harts perseuer,
And may they cease, Ã´ neuer, neuer, neuer



Thou in whose Zodiak of white armes enchained
Our Sunne so oft hath shined,
In whose wombe was confined
What in this Isle scornes to be long contained;
Liue thou and he, and maist thou see him rather
Copartner then Successor to his Father.
