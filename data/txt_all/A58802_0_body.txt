MY LORD,
THose excellent Trea∣tises of Christian Life, which were publish∣ed some years since by the learned Author, have, I doubt not, in a great measure an∣swered his Design, in writ∣ing them, which was to do as much good as he could to the World; and had he

lived to finish the other Parts of it, we might have had such a compleat Body of Christian Institutions in our own Language, as would have highly contri∣buted towards a Revival of true Piety among us. For, besides those Pieces which have already seen the Light, 'twas the Author's design to proceed to a particular Ex∣plication of the several re∣spective Duties which Men are obliged to render to God, their Neighbours, and Them∣selves; and for a Conclusion of all, he proposed a distinct Treatise of Ecclesiastical Du∣ties.
The two Discourses of Iustice and Mercy, which I now present to your Lord∣ship, were intended as a Part of that Duty which we owe to one another, and which, with other Enlargements, had the Author liv'd, would have made a Volume of themselves. And the Dis∣course of Mortification is like∣wise a Part of what He de∣signed for the Explication of that Duty which Man owes himself, which was also intended for another distinct Volume. Besides these he proposed a particu∣lar Examination of those

great Duties, which God requires; which together with the other Volumes would have compleated the whole Design. In Justice therefore to the Memory of this incomparable Person, I thought my self obliged to communicate to your Lord∣ship this short Account of him. The Design which he proposed was Great and Noble, and I'm sure those Pieces which he hath al∣ready published, do loudly speak the Excellent Quali∣fications with which God had endowed him to com∣pleat it, had not a laborious

Station, and, what was worse, a very sickly Constitution at last interrupted him from the Prosecution of it.
As for these Remains, they are faithfully transcribed from the Author's Manuscript; and your Lordship may easily discern that they are his true and genuine Off-spring by your Perusal of them. I know your Lordship hath a very high Value and just Esteem for the Memory of that great and good Man, and that is a prevailing Induce∣ment to take into your Pro∣tection those Works which he has left behind him. To

You they address them∣selves, and I doubt not but under that Character which your Lordship bears, they will be sufficiently recom∣mended to the World; and that they may effectually promote the Good of it, is the hearty Prayer of
