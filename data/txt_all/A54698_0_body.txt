MY. LORD,
THE welfare of Mankind hath so necessary a De∣pendance upon Laws, and the Administration of Justice, that by the Vote of all Ages, The Profession of the Law hath ever

been rank't amongst the most Honorable Callings. Perhaps in the Judgment of many, it would not have become any Person, less eminent than Cicero, to have said, Cedant Arma Togae; And yet, if a good Peace be the end and only justifiable ground of War, and if it be true what Philoso∣phy teacheth us, That the End is always more noble than the Means, I do not well see how the Consequence will be avoided, in Favour and Preferrence of the Gown. But this small Treatise hath nothing to do with such Polemical Debates; It only de∣signs to set down, and enume∣rate those Illustrious Families of our Nation, which have been raised to Honor and Wealth by

the Profession of the Law: The very Nature of the Subject, does in a manner entitle it to your Lordships Protection, who are in your self the greatest Example of this kind, and the greatest Ornament of the Law, in this, or any Age. Others have owed their Preferments in Honor and Estate to the Law, To which your Lordship is much more a Creditor, than a Debtor: When we consider your Nobi∣lity of Extraction, Eminency of Parts, and above all, your Invio∣lable Integrity, we are all bound to confess, that you brought with you more Honor to the Gown, than you receive from it. But these great Truths are not fit to be spoken by so mean

a Person, as I am who shall be too much honored in being permitted to lay my self with this small Tribute at your Lord∣ships Feet, and to make a Pro∣fession of being,
My Lord,
Your Honors most Obedient and most humble Servant
