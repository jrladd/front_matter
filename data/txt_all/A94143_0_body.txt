MY LORD,
WHen I consider your Honours great em∣ployments, and what weighty thoughts and deliberations those are incumbred with, who steer at the helme of so mighty a Nation as this; I blush to thinke how much time I shall steal from the Publick good, by diverting your Lordships thoughts to a survey of this Chronologie; and if you please favourably to looke upon it, you may make it rather a digression to your other Bu∣sinesse, then a supply of vacant hours. For if History be called (as learnedly once she was) the Schoolemi∣stris of life, what honour must Chronologie have, who is so neare of kin to her, that she gave her both life and eyes to walke by. What emboldens me to this attempt, my Lord is, the opinion that your Noble∣nesse is far more eminent then your Place, and you are known to be so great a Maecenas to the Muses, as men begin to dispaire of any miscarriage in their at∣tempts, that are but able to entitle your Honour to their protection. I have adventured to put it forth in a plaine English dresse, in a phrase (not subtile e∣nough
to ensnare) but as far beneath your Excel∣lencies, as in esteeme my scant Vicarage comes short of your Honours high tribunall at Westminster. It will be no dishonor, I hope, to protect such a Work where the learned Scaliger, Petavius, Calvisius, and others, have made their Dedications as durable as the Matter they wrote of. I conceive what they have outstript me in, by the lustre of their own Names, shal be regained by the worth of a Patron; & though I came after them in time, yet a Dwarfe set upon a Gyants shoulders, may see further thē he that bears him Pardon me, my Lord, if in that Chapter concer∣ning our Saviours Birth, I have spoken the sence of Antiquity, rather then mine owne. These great al∣terations, which are able to arrest the eye of a sober Reader, will shew you, that Providence hath left many Monarchs nothing but their Name; and to some few where you cannot finde their ashes, a Mo∣nument of Doing Well. But I keepe you too long in the Porch; let me crave pardon for this presump∣tion in the first place, and then I will engage my selfe that Posterity shall make as much of your Me∣mory hereafter, as you can possibly pay to Antiqui∣ty at present. So wisheth
