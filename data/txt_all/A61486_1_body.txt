SIR,
TO present so generous a friend
such a Trifle, such a Faroe of
Folly, in return of Favours,
of such Value as Yours, were to deal
with You as an Indian; Class, for
Gold; shadowes for substances:
My blushes sure (if I have any left)
must needs detect the treachery of
my traffick; and, for a Cheat, ex∣plode



me Elsing-Hall, (which hath
hitherto been my Indies) whil'st
these Papers rough and impolite, I
present as Pearls, which are, and let
me be for once ingenuous; Not bet∣ter
than those petty Pebles, I pickt
out of the Park Beck, would they
were half so solid, or so clear! How∣ever,
Sir, deigne it acceptance, may
be I have told You the worst, if no∣thing
else prevailes? You'l find in
it the beauteous brace of Elsing,
which will, I am confident, be so far
my sweet and amiable Advocates,
You cannot but accept it for their
sakes, if not his, whose highest am∣bition
aims but at the Honour of
continuing,
SIR,
