SEeme you content, be discontent who list,
My chiefest studie is to please my frend,
Your liking scares the byting Satirist,
What foole dyslikes where vertue doth commend.
Vertues firme stay is resident in thee,
And I from vertue seeke Appologie.


Vouchsafe then thou admired to descend,
Downe from th'imperious rich skie threatning throne,
Of all subdewing vertue, (honours friend)
And grace the Roofe of my poore mansion.
Herein's contain'd the house of my goood will,
Like it and take it, so be Land-lord still.


Yf the foundation shrinking chance to faile,
And strongest posts the builder doe beguile,
Suppose it then the Cottage of a Snaile:
That tottering falls: so that her ruine smile.
Decay in such poore creatures breeds delight,
For their ambition sauors not of might.
