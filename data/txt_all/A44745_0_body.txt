SIR,
I Have many thanks to give you for the Book you pleased to send me, called The Popish Royal Favorite; and ac∣cording to your advice (which I value in a high degree) I put Pen to Paper, and somthing you may see I have don (though in a poor Pamphleting way) to clear my self of those aspersions that are cast upon me therin. But truly Sir, I was never so un∣fit for such a task; all my Papers, Manu∣scripts, and Notes, having bin long since seized upon and kept from me. Adde here∣unto, that besides this long pressure and languishment of twenty three Moneths close restraint (the sense wherof, I find hath much stupified my spirits) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of sicknes, a high burning Feaver, with the

new Disease, whereof my Body as well as my Mind, is yet somwhat crazy: So that (take all afflictions together) I may truly say, I have passed the Ordeal, the fiery Tryal. But it hath pleased God to reprieve me to see better days I hope; for out of this fatal black Cloud, which now oresets this poor Island, I hope ther will break a glori∣ous Sun-shine of peace and firm happines: To effect which, had I a Jury, a Grand-Jury of lives, I would sacrifice them all, and triumph in the oblation.
So I most affectionately kisse your hands, and rest
Your faithful (though afflicted) Servant,From the Prison of the Fleet.
