MOst Gracious, Sacred and dread Sove∣raigne, and most Honourable pious Peares and Commons in Parliament Assembled: The despicable conditi∣on of my poor Estate (ruined through envy, malice, and revenge abroad in India, and cruelly oppressed by deep ingratitude, partiality and in∣justice at home in England;) the weaknesse and infermity of my decrepit person (debillitated by along continued sicknesse now almost six yeares compleat) with my simple Ignorant and weak un∣derstanding (yet true loyall hearty affection to my King and Countryes glory and renowne) right Humbly, and in all Lowly and Reverend Submission to Your Highnesse, and Honours Vertues and Authority, craves pardon and remis∣sion for my boldnesse, in interrupting your most

serious and most weighty affaires of State, with the dull apprehension of my zeale and affection to Gods glory, the Honour of my gracious Sove∣raigne and his most Royall Posterity, and the wel∣faire and accommodation of my indeared native Country, which hath induced or rather impulsed, and coacted me to come to counsell before I am called, and to lend the opinion of an unintelli∣gent and unfortunate Merchant, concerning the aptnes, accommodation, and assured great bene∣fit of this Kingdom of England by settling a con∣siderable Plantation in the most famous Island of the world (Madagascar or Saint Lawrence) and that thereby the glory of Almighty, your Majesties Honour, and the Common-wealths happinesse may redownd to all the world, as well out of A∣sia as Affryca (or rather more and better) in hope∣full or assured expectation) as out of America and other parts of the world. May it therefore please your Highnesse and Honours, to pardon my servent zeale and affection to this worthy designe; which if the Lawes of England did forbid or give causion to the projectors of new busines to the Common∣wealth, under paine of losse of life if their projects proved hurtfull to the same (as that (as I take it) of the Lacedemonians or some otherwell govern∣ed

Common-wealth (and such law perhaps not hurtfull to this Kingdome) yet would I adventure without any hope or expectation, to my selfe of reward or accommodation to) exhibit this project (so apparently beneficiall to the common-wealth in my own strong confident opinion) if so be it should please, his Royall Majesty and the Honou∣rable High Court of Parliament, to undertake it as abusinesse of State and of great consequence to this Kingdoms its welfare and Indempnity.
To insist upon a large Epistle were obnoxious to Your Majesty, and Honours weighty and im∣portent affaires, and my dull apprehention, with the tymorousnesse of my deep offence in such bold presumption, forbids me to take that unplea∣sing task upon me, I verily acknowledge it a trans∣cendent, haughty presumption in me to exhibit so rude and unpollisht a Pamphlet to Your High∣nesse and Honours perusall (yea to the meanest of the Honourable House of Commons) which though it cannot expect gracious acceptance from any, yet if it incurre not unto me thereby Your Majesties and Honours just indignation, for my impulsed zeale to my King and Countryes good out of the small experience and weake iniuditi∣ous apprehention of my unfortunate travels, untill

such time as more juditious and better intelligent persons by their more skilfull prevalent perswa∣sive pens give better incouragement, for speedy and effectuall means to proceed in so weighty (yea most hopefull successefull) a businesse, I shall have some cause (yet) to rejoyce in the depth of my misery and affliction; in the meane time my daily earnest Prayers to God, shall be for his abundant blessings, spirituall and temporall to his Sacred Majesty, and his most Royal Posterity, the Right Honourable High Court of Parliament, and all His Majesties true Loyall Subjects; and that the Lord Jesus would please to break in peeces the most hurtfull Cords of Contention with the spirit of truth and concord, and put away from all them that prosesse his name the offence of quarrels and dissention among them, that we may be joyned together in one minde, in truth love and Christi∣an Charity, to the praise honour and glory of God Almighty; and such shall be ever the prayers,
