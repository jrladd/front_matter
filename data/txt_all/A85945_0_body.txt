Sir,
THough my occasions are many, yet I cannot be wanting to answer so pious a motion as that of Yours, to give you my judgement touching Drinking of Healths: desired, as I suppose, in re∣lation to a mean for suppressing that unchristian, yea unnaturall custome. A custome which though it deserve rather flagella, then argumenta. And is fitter to be expulst Christian society, (as Christ expulst the Money-changers out of the Temple) with a whip, then with words; it is so against Natures light. Yet because evill practises never want pleas: and penalties are not onely then
most just, but most prevalent to restrain, when they are accompanied with Arguments to con∣vince. I shall briefly draw up an Indictment against this Monster, wherein I doubt not to evince it in many respects unworthy to live in a Common-wealth. But whether it be billa vera, I shall submit to Your mature judgement: and rest,
From my Study in Ivy Lane: Febr: 1. 1647.
