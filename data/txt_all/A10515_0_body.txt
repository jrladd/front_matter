RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL,
I Haue tendered these Meditations to your so generall Patronage, be∣cause you all haue one interest in them; In as much as you all make one bodie. I am not ignorant, that they are neither accommodated to the excellencie of these times, nor the curiositie of such as will not abide wholesome Do∣ctrine; I doe know, that (to guiltie consciences, and car∣nall mindes of men not so much proposing to themselues reformation, as formalitie in hearing) all plaine and home-put reproofes are like acrimonie of medicines to greene wounds: I remember that truth, by reason of our corrupt will and peruerse affections, is fruitfull in be∣getting enemies; neither am I to learne this out of mine owne particulars; it was euer so with the Prophets, A∣postles, Martyrs▪ yea and Christ himselfe: yet haue I (without care, what the vnreformable shall thinke, or say of my plaine dealing) addressed these exhortations to those few of many amongst you, who (duely considering how heauily it importeth vs to admonish sinners,Ezek. 3.20. lest their blood be required at our hands, to cry aloud and spare not, to shew the people their transgressions,I 8.1. and the house
of Iacob their sinnes) will not therefore thinke we are be∣come their enemies, because we tell them the trueth, but re∣member how necessary the greatest instancie, and roundest warnings now are in these dangerous times, wherein the dreadfull hand of God, hath in our late visitations, pon∣ted out the neglect, conniuence, and impunitie, begetting that cursed libertie of sinning, for which the wrath of God commeth on the children of disobedience: and, that (since we must all indifferently appeare before the tribu∣nall of Christ) they are not friends, Cor. 5.10. who passe by our vn∣regarded faults, as the Priest and Leuite by the wounded man, but they who like the good Samaritan, powre in Wine and Oyle, to clense and heale, and consequently to prepare vs against the strict examination of the most holy Iudge: Consider therefore what I say, and the Lord God giue you vnderstanding in all things, that vpon a present reforma∣tion, the Lord may make fast the barres of our gates, turne his indignation from vs, and set the cloudy pillar, day and night, betwixt vs and our insolent enemies: in which hope I rest
