I Doe not doubt (most worthie Sir) but that, as well in a generall opinion, as in your owne iudicious and approued cen∣sure, it may bee held for a part of little wit and lesse manners, (vpon so weake a ground, neither my selfe, nor my poore deseruings being knowne vn∣to you,) to present vnto you these slender labours, as the fruits of my affected studies. But vnder the fauour of your grauer wisedome, I humbly beseech both your vertuous patience, and pardon heerein: for a generall worlds report both of honour and your de∣light in this kind, hath so thoroughly possessed my well pleased eares, as hath (forgetfully of my poore selfe) enboldned my spirits, to make your onely selfe, the true iudge, and patron of these my vndeseruing papers. Humbly crauing heerein, your gracious accep∣tance, and in their litle worth to nourish them, as bee∣gotten for, and to your onely honorable selfe. Wher∣in, my heereafter times shall euer bind me to acknow∣ledge it in all due & reuerent thankefulnesse, & in my best wits, deserue it as I may. Euer resting, as best shall become mee.
