Honorable Lady,
VVHen sorrowes nights are ouer-past,
There followes ioyfull day,
Haplesse extreames can neuer last,
But styes and posts away,
To bring glad tidings in sad times,
I hold it wondrous fit;
And so doth all our best diuines,
"And you may thinke of it.
I do present you with a gift,
Fit for a Princes hand:
Pray take it, 'tis the meanes to lift,
Soules to the holy land;
The full redemption of mankind,
I offer to your view,
A subiect to translate the mind,
From th'old man to the new.

I know you seeke Gods holy place,
And clothes you for his feast,
With pious loue, purenesse, and grace,
True zeale, and all the rest,
Of those rich garments faire and meete
For such a Princes Court;
And doubtlesse you shall one day see't,
Though now my by report,
Imperfectly you are but told,
Yet quickly you shall see,
In Syons City, (wall'd with gold,)
The Lambe in's Maiestie:
Aduance your thoughts to heauenly things,
And you in the end shall soare
Vnto that Court, where's none but Kings,
Reioycing euer-more.
