Right Honourable,
THis age is by them whose pen haue a gift of conti∣nencie accoū∣ted the scrib∣ling age, and therefore he that appeares in print
 had neede bee vshered with a good apology; yet doe I pleade for this my doing, neyther importunity of friends, nor feare of imperfect cop∣pies, nor any other of those thread∣bare excuses, whereby so many (as may bee feared) haue lyed to the world. Neither would I consent that any other should publish my sermon as without my consent, and so com∣mit a modest hypocrisie: but ouer∣striding aldiscouragements, I hoped it might (if not please) yet profit, the first of my aimes: The next was to do your Honour some seruice, wher∣in I haue beene too too much defe∣ctiue, sauing in my daily prayers: wherein still I humbly craue, that this little one may liue by your pro∣tection, and your true noblenesse by Gods, and your owne pious vertue: and that I may still rest
