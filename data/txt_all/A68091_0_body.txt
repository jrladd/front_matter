RIght honorable. Not many yeares since, your louing accep∣tance of the translati∣on of a French trea∣tise, hath imbolde∣ned me to do the like againe, & to Dedicate this small worke vnto your L. For my purpose is, neuer to change for any other Patrone of my labours, seeing that vnto you of right they do belong. I had thought to haue published some other thing, of mine owne breeding, but that this French man pulled me backe, and vr∣ged me to teach him to speak the Eng∣lish
 tongue: Being somewhat capa∣ble, hee was not long in learning the same. If hee speaketh not so eloquent∣ly, as many of our Orators vse to doo, the fault is to bee imputed to his bad schoolemaister. But in my opinion, he speaketh, although plainly, yet pro∣fitable things, and necessarie for our estate. Let the work commend the au∣thor, and at your leysure I hope your L. Will vouchsafe him the reading. Thus committing your L. my good Lady your wife, your kinde Brother, your vertuous and godly chidren (my worshipfull friendes) vnto God, his most mercifull protection, I humbly take my leaue.
