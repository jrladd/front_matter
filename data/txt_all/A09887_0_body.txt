RIght Honorable, I make bolde to pre∣sent vnto your Lo. patronage this smal Trea¦tise: the Subiect whereof, affoording store of wea∣pons, to fight against the allurements of the world,
the frailty of the flesh, and the feare of death, is ney∣ther triuiall nor vnprofi∣table: the maner of hand∣ling, furnished with sen∣tences of holy Scripture, fraught with exampls, & garnished with variety of familiar similitudes, not affected nor vnpleasaunt: the Vse, to recall the vn∣ruly worldling, to comfort our distressed frend, & to
solace our owne soules, ve∣ry fruitfull & necessary: & the End, to strengthen the faithful, to arme them with Faith & Patience, against the serpentine as∣saultes of the Children of Babylon (who long since haue heated their furnace hoter than that of Na∣buchad-nezzars, wherin they are ready to throwe all those that will not fall
downe and worship their golden Image) a strong & necessary prouision. Thus not doubting of your Lo. good liking, & acceptance hereof, such is your zeale to Vertue and Piety: and humblie entreating that your L. good fauor which hath bene so much enlar∣ged towardes Doctor Po∣wel my Father (who now with the Lorde hath rest
from his labors) wil not be straightned vnto vs, his poore Children: I beseech the Lord Iesus blesse your Honour, and make you zealous more and more, for the Gospel: giue you a swift foote to hunt out the Bulles of Basan, and the wily Fox-cubbes that de∣stroy the yoong Ʋines: heape vppon you his bles∣sings spirituall and tem∣porall,
that in a good hope you may runne your race, and in the end, obtaine the high price of your calling.
