My Worthy Friends;
I Have at length yielded to your
Importunity; and do here offer
these Sermons to publick view,
and your own; which were, one day the
last Summer, preached under your
roof; attributing more to your pious
design herein, than to my own rea∣sons
against it. I no farther insist
upon the incongruity, having divers
years ago published a small Treatise
of Self-dedication, now again to

send abroad another on the same
Subject. For the way of Tractation
is here very different; this may fall
into the hands of divers, who have
never seen the other; and how∣ever,
they who have read the other,
have it in their choice whether they
will trouble themselves with this or
no. And tho' your purpose which you
urged me with, of lodging one of these
little Books in each family of the
hearers, might have been answered
by so disposing of many a better Book
already extant; yet you having told
me how greatly you observed them
to be moved by these plain Discour∣ses,
considering the peculiar advan∣tage
of reading what had been, with
some acceptance and relish heard
before (through that greater vigour
that accompanies the Ordinance of

Preaching to an Assembly, than doth
usually the solitary first reading of
the same thing) I was not willing to
run the hazard of incurring a guilt,
by refusing a thing so much desired,
and which, through God's blessing,
might contribute something, tho' in
never so low a degree, to the saving
of mens Souls. I could not indeed,
as I told you, undertake to recollect
every thing that was spoken, ac∣cording
to that latitude, and free∣dom
of expression, wherewith it was
fit to inculcate momentous things,
to a plain Countrey-Auditory. But
I have omitted nothing I could call
to mind. Being little concern'd
that the more curious may take no∣tice,
with dislike, how much, in a
work of this kind, I prefer plain∣ness
(tho' they may call it rude∣ness)

of speech, before that which
goes for wisdom of words, or the
most laboured Periods.
May you find an abundant bles∣sing
on your Houshold, for the
sake of the Ark, which you have so
piously, and kindly received: And
whereas, by your means, the parts
about you, have an help for the
spreading the Knowledge of God
among them, added to what they
otherwise more statedly enjoy; may
the blessing of Heaven succeed all
sincere endeavours of both sorts;
to the more general introducing of
the new man which is renew'd
in knowledge—where there is
neither Jew nor Greek, Circum∣cision,
nor Uncircumcision, but
Christ is all, and in all: To whose
Grace, you are, with sincere affe∣ction,

and great sense of your kind∣ness,
earnestly recommended, by
