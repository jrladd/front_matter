THE picture of Puritie, and patterne of Piety (most gra∣tious and dread soueraigne Lord) holy Bernard by name, deciphe∣reth out at large, the grosse enormity of that vgly vice Ingratitude, saying: that it is Inimica animae, exinanitio meri∣torum, dispersio virtutum &c. An eni∣mie to the Christians soule, an exile of merits, a ruine of vertues, and a consu∣ming fire, that scorcheth vp the foun∣taine of all godlines. Lest therefore I should cōdemne my self of this sensual

sin, and challenged be of grosse ingra∣titude: I haue presumed (crauing par∣don for my arrogant audacitie here∣in) in token of my loyall dutie, to your sacred maiestie, to transport these lines Laconicall, and letters impolite, to the happy hauen of your Princely heart, wishing to your royall grace, the siluer of all earthly prosperity, & the gold of all celestiall felicitie. If your highnesse respect the matter, it is celestiall, if your supremacie the manner, it is too too terrestiall: Yet pardon (most religious Prince) this my bold attempt, partly weighing the compulsion of entire affection, and partly considering the necessity of your simplest subiects erudition. Thus ceassing further troubling your maie∣sties sacred eares, prosterning my selfe vpon the knees of submission, at your highnesse footstool, for pardon for my presumption herein; I beg without in∣termission before the throne of grace, that it would please the almightie to blesse, protect and defend your royall maiestie, your blessed bedfellow, and all your royal issue, in this life present,

and in the life to come, crowne you all with the Crowne of immortall glory: and that for Iesus Christs sake our onely Lord, and euerliuing Sauiour, Amen. 
From Sampford Magna in Es∣sex, this 16. of October. 1608.
