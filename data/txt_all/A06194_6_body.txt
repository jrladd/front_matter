Ioy of both vvorlds.
LOuing frend. If you vvould die vvell, you must endeuour to liue vvell. Then let your death be neuer so suddaine, It vvill not come vnexpected neither vvill you be vnprepared. The daies, & houers of daies that you haue spent in gods seruice either in praying, or praysing him shalbe

so many cordialls of comforts,  consciences of vvell led purposes, & vvill so take vp your hart in ioye, & solace, that noe terrour of death, or darkenes shall appale yt. Who vvould not then be busie in this so serious, so sacred a busines? Let vs neuer thinke to be soundly merry, if this be not our musique. Reason, & Religion guides vs here vnto. For veary Reason shevveth vnto vs that vve must all die, & Religion enlighteneth vs hovve vve may dye vvell. Fooles iudge actions by euents, But the vvise for see by iudgmeÌ„t of reason, & faith vvhat vvill inevitably ensue. To this purpose all this is sayd. That as I haue in myne endeered loue sent you an introduction herevnto in this paper token so you vvould

accept, & practize it. So shall I euer rest your votary praying to god for your eternall happines in Christ Iesus his sauing mercies.
