May it please your Ladiships,
BEing pressed in spi∣rit to divulge this insuing discourse, the maine scope whereof, being to make this present age more sensible of the late past, and present footsteps
 of God in the world, in order to the setting up of the kingdom of our Lord Iesus; and the ma∣king of all dominions to serve and obey him.
And observing, how that a∣mong the many pious, precious, prudent, and sage Matrons, and holy women, with which this Common-wealth is adorned; as with so many precious jewels, and choice gemmes, (which God having here and there pla∣ced in it, doe set out the glory and lustre of the This Nation so farre excels in glory, and happi∣nesse all other Na∣tions, because of of those numbers of precious Saints that are in it; and for severall other respects: As it made a Reverend See Mr. Tho. Good∣wins Sermon, preached before the Parliament in Feb. 1645. which is in print, and intitu∣led, The great Inte∣rest of States and Kingdomes. Which in many other respects is worthy the serious view of the best saints. Divine of this Nation, thus to expresse himselfe concerning it: That if wee had stood at Gods el∣bow, when he boun∣ded out the Nati∣ons, and appointed the times, and sea∣sons, that men should live in; wee should not have known, in what na∣tion, or kingdome, or age wee should have chosen to have lived in, ra∣ther then in this kingdom, for whom God hath done such great things: un∣lesse when Iesus Christ himselfe was alive, and the A∣postles in those pri∣mitive times; un∣lesse in Iudea it self, where all the Apo∣stles were together. Nation) God hath selected and chosen out your Ladiships,
 and placed you in some of the highest places of honour (accor∣ding to your present capaci∣ties) in the three Nations; where∣in you have more then ordi∣nary opportuni∣ties to honour him.
And obser∣ving withall, how that as God hath placed you in the stations wherein you
 are; so hee hath fitted you for them: the ten∣dency of your aimes, studies, and endeavours, (as it is well knowne) being to the exaltation (as far as lies in you) of that great King of Saints, the Lord Iesus; whom you love in sincerity, and for the setting up of whose glo∣rious Kingdome in the perfecti∣on of it, you longingly waite:
 which frame of spirit in you, hath not been of yesterday only, but for many yeeres together hath shined conspicuously, and gloriously in you all; demon∣strating to all Saints, that in∣dwelling presence of the holy spirit which is within you.
I have therefore chosen, (be∣ing of your own sex) to dedicate these Treatises to your Ladi∣ships, (whom I honour because God hath honoured) and under your favourable aspects, to pub∣lish them to the world; being assured both,
First, of your ingenuous, and gracious acceptation hereof; seeing that these treatises tend to
 the quickning, and refreshing of the hearts, of those which waite for, and expect the com∣ming, and the kingdome of our Lord Iesus Christ: Knowing that every thing of this nature, from how weak an instrument soever it be, (so it bee with the plaine, and cleer demonstrati∣ons of the holy Scripture, and the holy spirit) is very accepta∣ble unto you, who are in that waiting and expecting posture.
And also secondly, of your owning, and defending, and maintaining all the truths, which are therein laid down; as far as they shall appear, in the ener∣gie, and evidence of the holy spi∣rit
 unto you, who have already so plenarily (compared with many other Saints of these pre∣sent times) received of that spi∣rit.
And now right honourable; that as your God hath graciously loaded you both with internall and externall glory; under which he keepes you in a sweet, meek, and humble frame, which crownes all the favours which he hath conferred upon you; so that you may more and more a∣bound, in every grace, and bles∣sing of the Lord, enjoying yet more full, spirituall, and sweet communion and fellowship with the Father, and with his
 Sonne Iesus Christ, through the spirit; that as transplendent stars you may shine gloriously, in the severall spheares wherein. God hath set you, or shall set you; while in this world, untill you are advanced unto that beati∣ficke vision, which is to bee in∣joyed, among the glorified Saints, and Angels, with Iesus Christ in another world, shall be the prayer of,
My Ladies,
