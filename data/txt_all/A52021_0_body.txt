THis Turkish Breviary and Abstract, as of right and due
ad∣dresseth it self to your Hands, in which the
Ad∣ministrationof our Intelligence and Commerce with
that Na∣tion is very worthily and pru∣dently placed. Be pleased
therefore among other lesser Concerns of your
Surinten∣dence therein, to suffer your Name to be
interested in the Pa∣tronage of this Brief SƲRVEY.
The Prefixing whereof was partly designed to compose
and civilize those horrid and dire conceptions we
have of those Barbarous Arms; by letting the World see, that persons of
the greatest Humanity have and do maintain a constant and amicable
Corespondence with them; partly to let their present Dread and
Puissance do service to those fair and obliging
atractions for which your Name is no less Famous,and partly to vindicate the Truth of the
Discourse ensuing, when we offer it at so known an
Altar, and to so competent a Judge and
Patron.
And that advantage with your own Eminence will just∣ly
engage an Ambition to sound your Name in the
gene∣ral Voyce and Discourse of the World, which is now
bu∣sied with this Mighty Mo∣narch; whose Glories and
Successes will have this further felicity, that they have
harm∣lesly reached us, under your particular
Protection.
And under that let the World also be taught, the great and
admirable effects of Sobriety and Abstinence, and the
mischiefs of Ryot and Excess: For this AsianPeople,
once the nauseated and basest dregs of the World, odious for their
Luxury, and Infamous for their Slavery, (the necessary consequents
thereof) are now by their temperance and abstemious∣ness, (the injunction
and Dis∣cipline of an absurd Religion) become the Mightiest Nati∣on, and
greatest Lord of the Universe: and by irresistible and over bearing
approaches, have given the Empire of Germany (the reeling,
stagger∣ing Remnant of the Fourth Monarchy a Cup of
Trembling.
God in his good time heal those Breaches, and pardon the many
provoking sins of Christendom, and continue us in our undeserved peace, 
and your Noble Self and Fa∣mily therein, in all Honour and
prosperity.
So prays
