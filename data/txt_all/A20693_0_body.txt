THE estimation and kindnes which I haue e∣uer
bountifully receiued from your fauour,
haue mooued me to present this nouelty of
musick to you, who of al others are fittest to
iudge of it, and worthiest out of your loue to
protect it. If I gaue life to these, you gaue
spirit to me; for it is alwaies the worthy re∣spect
of others that makes arte prosper in it
selfe. That I may therefore professe, and make manifest to the
world both your singular affection to me, and my gratefull minde
in my weake ability to you, I haue here prefixt your honourable
name, as a bulwark of safetie, and a title of grace, thinking my selfe
no way able to deserue your fauours more, then by farther enga∣ging
my selfe to you for this your noble presumed patronage. He
that hath acknowledged a fauour, they say, hath halfe repaide it:
and if such payment may passe for currant, I shal be euer readie to
grow the one halfe out of your debt, though how that should be I
knowe not, since I owe my selfe (and more, if it were possible)
vnto you. Accept me wholy then I beseech you, in what tearmes
you please, being euer in my vttermost seruice
