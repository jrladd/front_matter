Gentlemen,
WHAT it was that should make you so earnest for the Printing of a Dis∣course, which was only designed for that parti∣cular Audience unto which it was preached, I cannot possibly imagine, un∣less it were thereby to make your Meeting more publickly known, in hopes that your good Example might prevail upon others, and stir up a for∣getful People, to celebrate the Day with that Solemnity which is due unto it: If so, I must confess your Design

is necessary and good; and I am content thus at the expence of my own Repu∣tation to become serviceable unto it: though I could wish you had made choice of some better Pen for that pur∣pose, and laid your commands on such a person, as was able to have spread abroad your Fame, without the immi∣nution of his own. However you see I have obeyed and (which is all I do pre∣tend to) shew'd in that, how much you have at your command,
Gentlemen,
