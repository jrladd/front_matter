BEsides old Bonds which my best Vowes engage,
To your deere Parent; and besides the Due
Which to your Selfe might iustly thence accrew;
Th' apparant Vertues of Your April-age,
Challenge of right this PoÃ«ms Patronage:
The rather, sith we first receau'd from you,
The speedy Notice (no lesse quick then true)
Of HENRY'S Death, through Hells despightfull Rage.
You saw this Sunne, at his High-Noone-shine Set,
In sodaine Clowd of his owne Royall Bloud.
O Horrid Hap! Who euer can forget
Such Fate, such Hate, of one so Great, so Good:
O iust Reuenge, roote out th' Ignatian Pack,
The Moule that moou'd in Faux and Rauaillac.
