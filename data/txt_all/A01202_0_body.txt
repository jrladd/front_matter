THIS excellent sum∣marie of spirituall life (Right worshipfull and trulie Religious) hath gained so great credit with all deuout minds, for the excee∣ding profit and delight which they haue found by perusing
 it: that no booke whatsoeuer hath been in so short a time, so often, and in so manie places re∣printed; none by so manie men, and those of so great iudgement, and in such varietie of bookes treating of the same subiect, so much commended▪ Litle indeed it is in quantitie, but in substan∣ce, and effect, (as I may say) infi∣nite. Like the philosophers stone, which being but small in bignes, and not verie beautifull in shew, conteineth in it the seedes of all metalls, & with the onely touch, changeth baser metalls into the soueraignest of all, which is gold, the sole gouernour now, of this iron world. For euen so truly not onely in my iudgement, (which in these heaueuly mat∣ters reacheth but low) but in the iudgement of great diuines, and
 very holy men, thre hath not come out any abridgement of deuotion like this, conteining so copiouslie in few leaues, so plain∣lie in sweet language, so profita∣blie and aptlie for practize of all men, the rules and instruction of spirituall perfection, nor so pre∣gnant in efficacie, to conuert the iron affections of our soules, into the golden virtue of charitie, and true deuotion the queene of vir∣tues, that enamoureth God him self with her heauenlie beautie. This made me desirous to peruse it carefully, for the bettering of my owne soule; and to translate it painfully, for the benefit of manie soules in our poor distres∣sed countrie: which more then any other countrie, standeth in need of such good bookes, for counter poisons against so manie
 venemous writings, as worldly and fantasticall heads daylie pu∣blishe. This also made me so bold, as to dedicate the booke, and my labour, taken in transla∣ting of it, vnto your good selfe: as a treatise likely to be most pleasing to that excellent dispo∣sition which inclineth your mind to all holie & virtuous exercises: and an argument almost proper and peculiar, to the feruent zeale of Gods glorie, descending vnto you, and all your worthy familie by inheritance, and naturall affe∣ction receaued from your glo∣rious progenitour, that excellent true states-man, & learned coun∣cellour, englands honour, faithes zealous champion, and Christs constant martyr, SIR THOMAS MOORE, your great grand-fa∣ther. His admirable virtues may
 easilie persuade any man, that you neither would nor could de∣generate from so liuelie a pater∣ne: and your deuout and vir∣tuous life, doth as easilie proue you to be descended from that faire roote, by so goodly braun∣ches as your worshipfull father and grand-father; of whome as you haue taken the worthines of your bloud, so haue you learned their pietie and godlines, which maketh you delight in nothing so much, as in the practize of deuotion and Christian perfe∣ction. This I say, makes me so hardie as to desire you to ac∣cept of this my labour, and not onely to patronize it with your title, as a thing vowed to your seruice: but also at your best lea∣sure to read it, and practize it; that so I may be, not onely repayed by
 your courteous acceptāce of my good will, but likewise be parta∣ker of those spirituall ioyes, and increase of pietie, which I doubt not but you will reap out of this fertil field of deuotion: which is the principall fruict that in this my poor labour, I desire to haue, generally in all deuout soules that shall read this book, and more particularlie in yours; to whome I dedicate it, and my self, to re∣maine allwayes,
