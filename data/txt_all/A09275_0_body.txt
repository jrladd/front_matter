Noble Sir,
LEt none marvell, or thinke it strange, that I have made my wor∣thie choise of you to Patrenize this Tractate of Charitie. For who ever tasted more deepely, than my selfe; of the Charita∣ble liberality, and singular bountie of that right Honou∣rable Ladie, the Ladie Fran∣cis,
 Countesse of War∣wicke Dowager lately de∣ceafed, who first sent me unto, and planted mee in the Uni∣versitie. How bountifull like∣wise was the hand of that Noble Lady Isabell, the Lady Darcy, to many, and to me in particular, while my abode was in those parts, with my loving Parishioners at Workesop. I cannot but commemorate so transcendent goodnesse of these your Right honourable Ants to you, so Noblie minded friends to∣wards mee, imitating therein your worthy Father, and your blessed Mother, Sister to that my honourable good Lord, The right Reverend Father in God, Iames the Lord Bishop of Winche∣ster,
 who when hee was Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, sent for mee into these parts, where now I dwell, not by sol∣licitation of friends, but onely out of his former remembe∣rance of me in Cambridge, where hee was then to me a li∣berall and memorable Bene∣factor. Give mee leave thus to make mention of these ho∣nourable Personages, and to prefixe theirs and your names, and the memorie of you all before this (it may bee) my last worke, that so I may leave behinde mee, when I am gone to my long home, a deserved and true testimonie of my un∣faigned thankefulnesse, and my very high esteeme (which was and is due from mee) of and unto those Noble Fa∣milies
 of the Mountagues, and Wrayes, of both which you are so happily descen∣ded. I shall not neede to commend the Subiect matter of this Treatise to you: The very name of Charitie is Load-stone like, the grace lovely, and the fruite most delectable: its honourable among men, and the re∣ward of it in Heaven a∣mong the Saints unspeake∣able.
Accept it (Sir) as now its presented unto you, I beseech you, and let your charitable practice both grace it, and therein com∣fort mee, as it will your selfe abundantly, so shall I hold my labour fully re∣compenced, and will ever
 acknowledge my selfe yours (worthie Sir) in the Bond of all serviceabe dueties to bee commanded
