I Do not here vpon this hum'rous Stage,
Bring my transformed verse apparailed
With others passions, or with others rage;
With loues, with wounds, with factions furnished:
But here present thee, onelie modelled
In this poore frame, the forme of mine owne heart:
Here to reuiue my selfe my Muse is lead
With motions of her owne, t' act her owne part
Striuing to make, her now contemned arte
As faire t'her selfe as possiblie she can;
Least seeming of no force, of no desart
She might repent the course that she began,
And, with these times of dissolution, fall
From goodnes, vertue, glorie, fame and all.
