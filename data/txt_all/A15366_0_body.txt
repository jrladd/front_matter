RIght Worshipfull, though my vnskilfull Muse, praesuming in her infancie to soare aboue her reach, feared at first the vulgar view of her vnpollish'd lines, least her wings scortched like those of Icarus, her downe-fall should be as great as Phaetons; knowing that snarling Zoylous will sooner bite with his blacke tooth of enuie, then any well-willer can read and iudge with fauoura∣ble censure: yet soone resoluing to make choise of your worships for her Mecaenas, the aduancers of the vertuous, the maintei∣ners of the learned, friends to the Muses, and helpers to all for∣ward proceedings, thus farre she is bold to peepe foorth her head: assured neuerthelesse that some Agesilaus will tell her, he will ne∣uer prooue sutorem expertum, qui paruo pedi magnos in∣duat calceos, and that she is no way to be commended, who tunes
so high notes with so slender an Oaten Pipe: But such she will an∣swer that her will was better then her worke, and as the Painters  sometimes handles his Pensill, when he should but grinde his colours, so he that will prooue his craftes-maister, must ayme at the famest: but those which shall be such cynicall censorers of her first simtes, let them take the like taske, mend hers, and she will yeeld vp the Bucklers. Thus not doubting of your worships fa∣able acceptance, crauing no more: friendly censure, hoping no  kinde countenance the chiefe of her wish: all which shall arme her against each foule-mouthd Momus, or carping Diogenes, she commits the tuition of this her poore Orphan to your most worthie protection.
