HAVING receaued the honour, and hap∣pines to be a member of your Holy Com∣munion; and on the other side, hauing done you no∣thing but dishonour, by leading
an vnprofitable life at least, and most vnvvorthy of the high vocati∣on of being a Catholike; I haue had too much reason to cast my thoughtes vpon thinking, hovv I might make you some little part of amendes. Nothing came to my mind (vvhich might also be vvith∣in the measure of my povver) but the presenting you vvith this Book; vvhich, togeather vvith my selfe, I cast at the feet of you all, vvith an humble and most reuerend affecti∣on. Our Lord doth knovv, hovv much need I haue of all your pray∣ers, and the high account, vvhich I make of them; vvhereby you may ghesse, hovv much in earnest I de∣sire the same.
And because there is amongst you a Religious Person, a true ser∣uant & spouse of Christ our Lord,
by vvhose meanes, through the goodnes of God, I am grovvne to an increase of some good desires to doe him Seruice; and vvho made much impression vpon my mind, tovvards the making me translate this very Booke; I do also dedicate it, to the same person, in a particu∣ler manner, as a token of Eternall Gratitude. And I beg of that Soule, that vvhen, by vvay of Exchange, for the great Treasures, vvhervvith God hath trusted her, she shallbe remitting her deuout Petitions to that diuine Maiesty; the necessityes of myne, may not be layd aside.
Our Lord Iesus graunt, by the precious merits of his bitter Passion (vvhich I beseech him to apply to vs all, by the intercession of his Im∣maculately conceaued Mother, the Queene of Heauen) that vve, vvho
by his grace, are in these difficult tymes, made members of his Mi∣litant Church (vvhich to vs indeed is so truely Militant) may one day, by his goodnes, arriue to be also mēbers of the Triumphant. Where clearely, and, at once, vve shalbe sure to see, and vvonder, at the inestimable riches of Mercy, vvher∣vvith our Lord did choose vs fevv, out of so many millions of soules, to professe his Truth and Fayth, vvith so much preiudice to our sel∣ues, in all those thinges, vvhich the Foolish and Childish World is vvont to hold so deare. Only vve must take care, that vve continue in it, to, and in the end; and in the meane tyme, also to accompa∣ny our Fayth, by such good vvorks as may become this high Profes∣sion; for else vve shall but double
our damnation. Our Lord deli∣uer vs from falling into that Abys∣se of misery; and enable vs by his holy Grace, so to serue and suffer for him heere, that Eternally vve may adore him in Heauen.
