Right Honorable.
CAESAR did adventure to write his owne acts, & hero∣icke deedes by commentary (and very well he might) I, that with Virgils gnat, have nothing to write of my selfe (save misery) have assaied to write the lives, Pious, and vertuous deedes of others (not that by this they are immortalizde) for their owne Worthes, Vertues, Hospitable, and Pious deedes united have eter∣nized themselves. My full scope, & modest aime is to perpetuate them on Earth, that posterities unborne may not let such Honorable, Religious, & vertuous acts, as your nobleprogeni∣tos have done, & daily do performe,

slip into oblivion, but as in a christ∣all mirror we may here behold them (as from the beginning we had our sa cred lawes in the first table writte) your Honour is the Sanctuary to whose high Altar of goodnes, I al∣waies flie too for redresse in all ex∣treames one, whom I know with
Anaxeritis had rather receive a cruse of cold water from your Poore Sinetis, then a goblet of rich aroma∣ticke, or cretan wine, from a flatter∣ing Gnatho, the God of Heaven, & earth blesse you, my honorable. Lady my Honorable Mecenas, and all your noble, and Honorable families, and posterities, sending you your harts wish Temporall, & Eternall.
