FAire Branches of a Stock as faire
Each a sonne, and each an heire:
Two Ioseph-like, from Sire so sage,
Sprung in Autumne of his age;
But a Benjamin the other,
Gain'd with losing of his Mother.
This fruit of some spare hours I spent
To your Honours I present.


A King I for my subiect have,
And Noble Patrons well may cra
Things tripartite are fit for three,
With Youths, things youthful best 
Take theÌ„ therfore in good part,
Of him that ever prayeth in heart,
That as in height ye waxe apace,
Your Soules may higher grow 


Whilst your Father (like the greene
Eagle in his Scutcheon seene,
Which with bill his age doth cast)
May longer still and longer last:
To see your Vertues o're increase
Your Yeares, ere he departs in Peace.
Thus I my Booke, to make an end,
To You: and you to God commend.
