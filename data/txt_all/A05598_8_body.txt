THese meane abortiue lines, of my Lament,
On my low-bended knees I sacrifice them
To thee, on whome my greatest loue is bent:
They gladlie come, and I doe authorize them.
And so this simple mite with loue receaue,
If thou affect good will, no more I craue.


To paye the debt I owe of my great duetie,
Which in large bondes, lies bound to thy great worth,
Is more than I can doe, vnlesse by fewtie,
I striue (though weake) thy vertues to set foorth:
Yet for my debt, my duetie, and my prayer,
I'me bound on earth, and GOD will bee thy payer.


Thy noble feasting of our gracious King,
And kindlie wellcome, to the ENGLISH Kinde;
O! had I time, the trueth that I might sing,
Thy great desert, a just reward should finde:
But my Farewelles mee poste, yet by the way,
Thy Vertue, in thy Worth, triumphes each day.


Compendious workes, on high stupendious thinges,
Which brauest wittes, wring from inuentions braine,
No knowledge yeeldes, but admiration bringes,
To vulgare sortes, and to the wisest pane:
I sing but plainlie in Domesticke verse,
The watrie accents, of a pilgrimes herse.
So (worthy earle) protect my Lamentado,
And done, I scorne the wretched worlds Brauado.
