THE Arcanums of Paracelsus be∣ing applauded by many men with so many and such am∣ple Encomiums, yet not enough, incited me Ten Years since, first to under∣take the consulting of Paracelsus him∣self about his Medicines. Two Years thereof had elapsed, in which I turn∣ed over his Books day and night, with an indefatigable and invincible Mind, yet with unequal Success, and scarce any Benefit at all: For in the Books of Paracelsus, besides the usual way of concealing Secrets, common
 to the Adepts, I found another much greater difficulty withal, yet less fre∣quented by the Adepts; Paracelsus, as Corrector of the Adepts, having pro∣pos'd to himself therein, the instruct∣ing of not only raw initiated Scho∣lars, but even expert Masters of the more secret Chymy, and for this reason he abbreviates his Receipts with wonderful Accurtations, Learned in∣deed to the Learned, but to us seem as lame and impefect; and besides, they are so disguised with most in∣tricate Terms of the true Philosophical Chymy, as to illude not only shallow, but profound Capacities: Which Im∣possibility (I had almost said) of un∣derstanding, Paracelsus aggravates, by intermixing Common with Secret Receipts; which is not for a Scho∣lar, but a most experienced Master to distinguish.
But of these Difficulties, the first and greatest Obstacle withal, was my own unhappy Preconception of some
 Alkahest: For being now out of the hope of attaining to the preparation of this Liquor by other mens Books, as well as Paracelsus his own De Viribus Membrorum, I betook my self to other places, treating of the Circulatum mi∣nus, and Specificum corrosivum (as synoni∣mous Terms of the Alkahest with some men) to which I added the Aqua or Oleum Salis, Aqua Comedens, Aqua Regis, Circulatum majus, and one after another, being perswaded that some one only universal Menstruum was intended by all, that I might find the Method of preparing this Liquor in all places compared together, which I could not in each severally; but at length despairing, and being overcome by the manifold and almost incredible, yet unsuccessful pains I took, I re∣solved to decline Chymy and Medicine, as Arts too deep for my understand∣ing: When behold! on a sudden the Eyes of my Mind were opened, and I saw all these things differ, not in name only, but also in matter, preparation
 and use; so instead of one Liquor Al∣kahest, which I sought for, I found in Paracelsus many Menstruums, with the several Uses of them all in Medicine; now knew I how to prepare, and ac∣cording to Paracelsus, distinguish things into Essences, Magisteries, Astrums, Arcanums, and those which he calls the less Medicines; so that which was in Paracelsus most difficult to be under∣stood by others, became more clear to me than any thing else; and so I obtained the End sooner than the Beginning: Yet the Joy from thence accrewing, fell shorter than expecta∣tion; for having tried several Expe∣riments in vain, I came to understand that these Menstruums of Paracelsus con∣tained something abstruse and un∣known, to be understood, not in the least according to the Letter: where∣upon, examining them more exactly, and comparing their Qualities with the Nature of the Liquor Alkahest, I found a vast difference between it and them; for it is said, There is one Li∣quor
 Alkahest, and that universal; but many are the Menstruums of Paracelsus, that indestructible, that destructible; that not mixing with Bodies, these abiding with them; that preserves the Virtues of things, these alter them; that ascends after the Essences of things in destillation, these before their dissolutions, &c. I was at a stand sometime which part to take; one while I wish'd for one indestructible Liquor, rather than many destructi∣ble Menstruums, supposing that one better than many; another while changing my Mind, I desired the Menstruums, as sufficient for many Uses I knew before.
Truth overcame at length, enabling me now to demonstrate the most, if not all the Medicines of Paracelsus in Guido and Basilius: On the contrary, I perceived the Arcanums of Paracelsus, (commonly so called) as prepared by that Liquor Alkahest, or the like, to be more and more different, yea con∣trary to the Authentick: wherefore
 as to the Preparation of Medicines, I began to abstain, yea desisted from further enquiring into the obscure Matter, Preparation and Use of that Liquor Alkahest, namely, that which I find described in one place of Pa∣racelsus as a Medicine, but not in the least as a Menstruum: Which Obstacle being removed, I found an easie way from Paracelsus to Lully, Basilius, and other Philosophers of the same Fa∣culty, who I saw agreed all unani∣mously in confirmation of the Para∣celsian Menstruums; yea Light adding Light to Light, appeared so clear, that their preparation, variety, simple and literal sense shewed themselves all at once, one only Word remaining un∣known, yet expressing the universal Basis of all the Adepts, and that is Spirit of Wine, not Common, but Philo∣sophical; which being known and ob∣tained, the greatest Philosophical, Me∣dicinal, Alchymical, and Magical My∣steries of the more secret Chymy, will be in the power of the Possessor. In
 no Books of the Adepts, hitherto known of me, have I found any thing rare, that owes not its original Being to this Spirit; so that I dare affirm, that whatsoever Chymical Spirits lower and higher, fixed and volatile, are a∣ble to do, the very same, and more will this our Spirit perform: This it was that moved me to employ all my Study and Endeavours, turning over every Stone in quest of the Spirit of this Wine, and continually ruminating upon those abstruse, and variously disguis'd Terms whereby they cloud∣ed it, as the Key of all Philosophy, behold the Fame of your great Name welcom'd me to Wilde, the Metropolis of Lithuania; and observing that You in expounding Natural Philosophy, ab∣stained from all manner of Intricacy, and as the first and only Person in∣deed using a plain and candid Series of Words in applying common Ex∣amples of Vulgar Chymistry, I rejoyced with my self, thinking, What could not this great man do, if Master of
 the more secret Chymy? I resolved with my self therefore to take a Jour∣ney into England, for your sake alone, that I might confer with you about the Menstruums as well as Medicines, and other Secrets of Paracelsus; from whom also I promised to my self very great Assistance in some other things not yet known: Nor indeed has my hope deceived me; for besides the easie admission, common to all Strangers and Foreigners, you have been pleas'd to vouchsafe me a more free Access, received me courteously, and com∣mended my Studies, and thereby rais'd my Mind to greater Things: Which Favours do oblige me to Dedicate this part of my Studies to you your self; Earnestly and Humbly beseeching you kindly to accept it, and continue your Love and Friendly Countenance to him that is and ever will be
