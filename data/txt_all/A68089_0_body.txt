REdyng somtymes these Dialoges of Gelli (right honourable, and my singuler good lorde and maysters) and fyn∣ding them not onelye thought worthy trāsla∣tion into other languages, but also dedica¦tion to kynges, and Princes, I fell lyke∣wyse together with the instigation of dy∣uers my frendes, in suche desyre to see the same in oure toungue, that others haue brought to passe in theirs: the whiche ha∣nynge nowe finished, as I haue best bene able, and considering how goodly a glasse it may be to them that knowe none other language then their owne, to see herein howe lyke the brute beast, and farre from his perfection man is, without the vnder∣standing and folowinge of dyuyne thyn∣ges: And what his perfecte beinge is, ha∣uynge

that, and maye thereby set aparte, and leaue those base and sensual appetites led with mordinate wyll, takynge a free course guyded by reasonne, by the meane of the vnderstandinge: and threewithall remembryng aswell my bounden duetie, both for benefite receaued by the goodnes of your ryghte honorable father, and the most gentle affection (I perswade my self your selues bear towardes me) as also the prose of the vndoubted towardnes vnto al vertues and knowledge, the myghty ma∣ker of all hath put into you, in this tyme of your tender ages, as an assured hopo of your most nyghe comminge to very true perfection: I haue thought it my part, as one desyrous rather indedes then wordes to shewe myne assured seruice towardes you, euen as I haue of longe time hereto∣fore serued in your educatiō, in one equall sorte, so likewise to unpart vnto you these my small trauelles: though not aunswer∣able to your honoure and merites, yet of the best of my lytle power, and somewhat apte for your conference in the Italion or other tounges, the whiche alreadye you

well taste and sauour of. Mooste humbly, therefore besechyng, it may please you, to accept this my meane traduction, not so muche for the qualitie of the gifte, as for the great desyre I haue to shewe, not one∣ly my labours and pains bound vnto you, but my life also as it may stand in stede: The eternal God pre∣serue you, with much en∣crease of honor.
From London, the .xv. day of March.
