Noble Senators,
THat in the Frontispiece of this Treatise, there are humbly presented to your Honours and this Nation, a Colle∣ction of those many desirable consequences, which will follow upon the practise of this enterprise; is not, that I (so inconsiderable an instrument) do delight in professing things strange or unusuall, (which to doe, were neither rare nor difficult) being very sensible, that great underta∣kings do many times weaken the credit of the best Authors, far more of such as my selfe, even to the rendering of their Proposalls by preju∣dice, to be cast off as impossible, before any due triall or deliberate exa∣mination thereof.
But observing, that in regard of the diversity of your weighty affairs, the multiplicity of books, and the vanity wherewith they are general∣ly fraught, your Honours have just cause to be discouraged from ta∣king notice of any books, except such as (at least) seem to be of some speciall concernment, I thought it necessary (though with much wa∣rinesse, least I should exceed in expressing the particulars) to premise a summary of the severall advantages, which would, as J conceived up∣on solid grounds, appeare to be the necessary effects of this attempt, as
it may be managed in a way, that is not onely practicable, but free from much difficulty and danger to the Undertakers, or any damage at all to others.
In confidence therefore, that your own wisdomes will direct you to suppresse all prejudice, that might arise from the consideration of the great desparity betwixt any such as my self, and that which is here pro∣fessed, untill by a serious perusall of the whole work, your Honours be able so far as need shall require upon just grounds, to reject what is a∣misse.
And having nothing to expect, but (which to crave would imply a greater willingnesse in me then in your Honors) even a furtherance of this work, so far forth as in your discretions ye shall judge the good of this Commonwealth to be therein concerned; there remains onely the reasons for making publique, and thereby exposing to the view of all Nations, a work of such a Nature, as if being first set on foot by any o∣ther people in the world before our selves, may through multiplying their strength put them into the better capacity to disturb the peace of those who not having also imbraced the same, are the lesse able to de∣fend themselves; as was well objected by a member of Parliament, tru∣ly honorable.
In answer to which, it is to be considered, not onely that this argu∣ment tendeth (if I may in this allude to those words of the Apostle in another case) to provoke to emulation those who are my flesh, and thereby to save them; but that the undertaking it self is of such a nature, as to have attempted any thing therein, without first preparing the minds of men, by publishing a ful and free description of the whole en∣terprize, with the mysteries thereof, the manifold reasons for the same, the solution of doubts, and answer to objections, would through the subtil insinuations of those who desire not the prosperity of this distres∣sed people, have occasioned (without question) many fair pretences, to have been spread abroad, for stifling the same at the very birth.
And the rather, in regard that as innocency needs no corner, so in∣genious men desire to be guided by their own light, in things which themselves are to practise, insomuch as the want of full satisfaction to all men (which without printing could not easily have been given) might both amongst your Honours, and those that should engage in this undertaking (besides others) have been interpreted a just ground of jealousie.
Whereas an accompt of the whole being first divulged, if this Nati∣on should then slight that, which other people make a profitable use
of; the guilt which otherwise truly (I being perswaded in conscience of the reality of the thing, would have been heavy upon my self) doth no longer lie at my doore, whatsoever the event should be.
But to remove this danger of being prevented by other Nations, I have yet (as by the sequell doth appear) concealed one principall Adjunct, the ignorance of which, will make fruitlesse the endeavours of any, that without further direction, should either here or in any other part of the world, undertake this practice; wherein, notwithstanding when need re∣quires, I shall not faile (God willing) to give full satisfaction.
And although upon publication thereof, I conceive it not neeessary, to seek any Priviledge, Pattent, Broad seal or the like, as other Authors upon such occasions (in reference to the satisfaction of their manifold expences of time, pains, trouble, charges and hazard, which in such enterprises are not usually small) apprehend they have just cause to do.
Yet (Renowned Patriots) it is not, for that in this endeavour, I have been lesse necessitated to any of all these inconveniences, then others in such cases generally are; but rather being confident (from experience) that if any within your Honours Jurisdictions, offer so great an affront to Justice, as (endeavouring to reap what others have sowed) should thrust themselves into those imployments, which are pertinent to this undertaking; your Honors will assuredly vouchsafe, upon an appeal, to interpose your Authority, whereby to suppresse all such attempts, and that in as ample and effectuall manner, as if the same had been desired, before any publication of this Enterprise.
All which, was in duty thought fit, to be humbly submitted to the ju∣dicious and grave consideration of your Honours, By him,
