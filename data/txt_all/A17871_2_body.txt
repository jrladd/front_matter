IF to be sprong of high and princely blood,
If to inherite vertue, honour, grace,
If to be great in all things, and yet good,
If to be facill, yet t'haue power and place,
If to be iust, and bountifull may get
The loue of men, your right may chalenge it.


The course of forraine manners far and wide,
The courts, the countries, Citties, townes and state,
The blossome of your springing youth hath tried,
Honourd in eu'ry place and fortunate,
Which now grown fairer doth adorne our Court
With princelie reuelling, and timely sport.


But if th'admired vertues of your youth
Breede such despairing to my daunted muse,
That it can scarsely vtter naked truth,
How shall it mount as rauisht spirits vse
Vnder the burden of your riper dayes,
Or hope to reach the so far distant bayes?


My slender Muse shall yet my loue expresse,
And by the faire Thames side of you sheele sing,
The double streames shall beare her willing verse
Far hence with murmur of their ebbe and spring.
Bnt if you fauour her light tunes, ere long
Sheele striue to raise you with a loftier song.
