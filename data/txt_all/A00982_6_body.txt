THe drift and scope of princely Subiect this
Is bent to very perfect honest end.
The Writer thought, he could not write amisse,
In writing that which formerly was pend.
Nine former Worthies Stories theirs extend
Some of them vp to heauen, with endlesse praise:
All of them liv'd most worthy in their dayes.
But all were not of one, nor oneselfe sort:
Three excellents, of God ordaind before:
Three other valiant, famous by report.
The first three Kings, one Prophet, valour store:
All three commended heauenly vertues lore.
Three other were profane, but valiant men:
Three Christian Kings, that vsed pike for pen.
