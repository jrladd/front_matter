TWo things (right Hono∣rable) are vsually the Apologicall subiects
 of most dedications, the worthinesse of the Patron, and the selfe-distrusting insuf∣ficiency of the Wri∣ter; the one concer∣neth mee, the other your HONORABLE SELFE, whom each generous Spirit hath so iustly made the aemulated patterne of true Nobility and Virtue that I could not easily containe my selfe, but was in∣wardly constrayned with an affectionate desire to dedicate this small mite of my
 poore endeauours, this handfull of Morali∣ty vnto you, though no desert in my selfe can euer bee worthy inough to make mee knowne to your HO∣NOUR, nor any thing so well handled in this concise volume, but may either bee con∣trouled by your riper iudgment, or else be corrected by the inte∣grity of your life: yet (assuring my selfe that your generous and truly ennobled minde will willingly enter∣taine whatsoeuer is
 well intended) I pre∣sume to shelter this little compendious Tract vnder your Ho∣nourable patronage, sic non Zoilum metuo, non inuidiam.
