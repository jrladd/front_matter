My LORD,
I Present you here with a handful of fruits ga∣thered out of your own Field, which I humbly desire may be acceptable to you, as I am accountable to you; so I will en∣deavour continually to please God and your self: this auditory
among whom you have been plea∣sed to give me a place, and whe∣ther so many noble persons do re∣sort, shall be an everlasting mo∣nument of your Charitable piety. My Lord, our souls bless you, and our bowels which are refreshed with the shadow of your name, shall carry the acknowledgment thereof up to Heaven. In these dayes full of horror and confusion, the foxes hav holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the son of God hath not, in regard of us, where he may rest his head, if you had not lodged him amongst us: even so may you lodge with him in his highest habitation. But my Lord live here first many ages, and in the end live eternally.
