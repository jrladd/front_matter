SVCH pictures (Right Worship∣full)
as were presented to Alex∣ander
the great, had Arte to please
the eie, and conceit to please the
wit: Such as writ to Iulius Caesar
discourses of Warres: Those that
dedicated ought to Traian of peace
and to Seuerus of Iustice: aing
the effectes of their studies to
the affectes of those worthye men whome they resolued to
honour, with the Patronage of their laboures: The conside∣ration
of these premises (Right Worshipfulfull) emboulde∣ned
me to make choise of your worshp as a Maecenas, fit∣test
for a worke of such grue import, perswaded therunto
by the report of a friend, whose opinion I craued, for the
choice of a Patrone: and made the more resolute by the
generall Censure that Fame sets downe, imblasoning your
vertuous disposition, in the care of the common weale, and
fauour to good letters: Incouraged by these causes, I present
vnto your worship the Masquerado of Spaine, a deuise con∣teining
the discouerie of the Spanish insolent pride alaied
with a deepe disgrace, and their presumptuous braues pul∣led
downe with the resolution of English souldiours: which
worke, if your worship receiue as gratefully, as I present it
hartelie, I haue the desired ende of my labour: In which
hope resting, I commit you to the Almightie,
