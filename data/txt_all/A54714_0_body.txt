Reverend Fathers,
I Know my self too well (though not so well as I
should) to think any of my Labours to be wor∣thy
of Publick, especially your Awfull and
and Judicious view. This plain Sermon was
preach'd in my own Parish Church, without
the least thought of ever exposing it to the critical censure of
the world; onely the importunity of some that heard it, and
the approbation of some Judicious Friends, that have since
perused it, and a willingnesse (I confesse) to take occasion to
present my dutifull respects unto you, have prevailed with me
for the publishing this (otherwise) worthlesse Piece; Such as
it is (with some addition that passed memory or meditation
in the first delivery) I humbly send unto you, rather for
your Pardon than your Patronage. The true reason why ti

staid so long from the Presse, is this: I disputed with my self,
whether I should Print my sins (as they were reputed) with
my Sermon or not: After much deliberation, I concluded
for the affirmative. Whether I be the first that herein have
lead the way, or no, I know not: yet I do with all sub∣mission
of judgment leave it to the Grave consideration of my
Reverend Brethren, who have drunk of the same Cup, whe∣ther
a modest and seasonable vindication of their innocent
and spotlesse Conversation, from the black-mouth'd slanders
and unjust accusations of a reviling people, would not conduce
to the Honour of God, the Glory of the Church, the promoting
of the Gospell, the winning of Souls, the great content of the
Kings Majesty, the healing of our breaches, the setling of
our peace, and their own comfort in the day of their account.
I have spared Names, cut off Impertinencies, corrected some
mistakes: The rest is faithfully offered to your favourable in∣terpretation,
by
