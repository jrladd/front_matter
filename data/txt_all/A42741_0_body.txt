SInce it is Generally
known, that no Man
lives without Fault;
but that We all Trans∣gress
daily, even against Our
Soveraign Good, from whom
notwithstanding, we Receive
Innumerable Benefits, with
large Promises of Forgive∣ness:
So in this Case, I have
a Matter of Encouragement,
that, although I may have of∣fended,

thus rashly appear∣ing,
to offer These follow∣ing
Lines to Your view,
(no wayes to be compared
to Your Great, and Masculine
Spirit;) yet that I should not
doubt of Your Obliviating
this my present Offence; but
also obtain (from Your Re∣al
Generosity) a Favourable
Acceptation, and Reception
of these first-Fruits of my pub∣lick
Endeavours: I have ta∣ken
the Boldness to make this
Dedication, hoping that my
Presumption (taken as an Er∣ror)
may be understood to
proceed from the Assurance
of Countenance, under so
worthy a Personage; where∣by

it may more safely appear
upon the Stage of the World,
encounter the greatest Op∣positions,
and rest Secure
from the Cruelty of Envy.
The Great God, who hath
hitherto Blessed You with
Health and Means, continue
the same, and multiply it to
Your last Period: and when
You shall Cease to be among
the Living, give You the full
Fruition of Eternal Glory;
So wisheth,
SIR,
