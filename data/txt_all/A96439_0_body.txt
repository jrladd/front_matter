THE Reason why I presume so high in my Dedication, is, you being his Vicegerents on Earth, are the great Instruments in GOD's Hand, who can Cure the Nation of its Malady, and Heal the Languishing Diseases, and so make up the Breaches thereof; which if GOD is pleased (tho' now at last) to honour you with this great Work of Reformation, to advance the Kingdom of CHRIST in the Earth, you will not only give occasion to your Dearest Friends, but your greatest Ene∣mies shall Bless, Praise, and Magnifie the LORD of Lords on your behalf, for then shall that Prayer be answered, Thy King∣dom come, and Thy Will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven; and will not this be a Glorious Day, when instead of Killing
and Destroying one another, we shall Pray one for another? Then we shall be Christians indeed, not only in Name, but in Nature. Oh Blessed Day will this be, to love the LORD above all things, and your Neighbour as your selves; here will be an end of Covetousness, that great I∣dolatress, Abomination of the Land, and Merciless Idol of all the World, an end of Lust, the Mother of Penury, which ne∣ver obtains what it seeks, an end of Ma∣lice, Deceit, and Discord: Here the Work of Justice shall be Peace; here you will be Just, and do that which is Law∣ful and Right; here you will not Oppress the Poor and Needy, nor Spoil any by Violence, but will restore the Pledge, eve∣ry one to his Neighbour, and so do Justice to the Widow, and give your Bread to the Hungry, and Cloath the Naked with a Garment, and will execute true Judg∣ment between Man and Man; Whore∣dom, and Wine, and New Wine, shall not take away your Hearts; here you will not Oppress nor Vex the Widow, Fatherless, the Stranger, nor the Poor, neither will you respect Persons, nor re∣ceive Gifts nor Rewards, because the Gift
blinds the Eye of the Wise, and pervert∣eth the words of the Just, that you can∣not see to reprove Sin in the Gate; for behold the Eyes of the LORD are upon all the Earth, to shew himself strong with them that are of a perfect Heart toward GOD, to love him, and keep his Commandments; and here you shall be the Blessed, If you walk not in the Counsel of the Wicked, nor stand in the Way of Sinners, nor sit in the Seat of the Scornful; but your Delight to be in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law me∣ditate Day and Night. Oh Happy People who are in such a Case; yea, Blessed for Ever are they whose GOD is the LORD! Then Blessed shall you be in your going out, and in your coming in, if the KING and his PARLIAMENT join together Unanimously in this Great VVork, to exalt the Name of GOD in the Earth, and for the perfecting thereof, take to them the Zeal of Josias, the Courage of Jehosaphat, the Love and Zeal of David, who said, The Zeal of thine House hath eaten me up: And, Oh how I love thy Law, it's my Mitation all the Day: I love thee dearly, Oh LORD. And thus he goes on expressing the Indearedness of his Affecti∣on






to the LORD, and his Holy VVays, making Vows and Promises, saying, I will walk in my House before thee with a per∣fect Heart; I will set no wicked thing before my Eyes; I hate the work of them that fall away, it shall not cleave unto me: A froward Heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil: Him that privily slandereth his Neigh∣bour will I destroy; him that hath a proud Look, and a high Heart I will not suffer; mine Eyes shall be upon the Faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way, he shall serve me, there shall no deceitful Person dwell in my House; he that telleth Lies shall not remain in my sight; thus will I destroy all the Wick∣ed of the Land, that I may cut off all the Workers of Iniquity from the City of the LORD: Mark how he would destroy them; not by taking away their Lives, but by putting them out of their Offices, to depose them from their Trusts: Oh! that I might be so happy to prevail with the King and his Parliament, to try this way of winning the People of this Land; first, by their own Pious Lives and Con∣versations, the King in his Court, and every Member in Both Houses of Parlia∣ment,
particularly, every one in his own House, (and Both Houses of Parliament to purge out the Atheism and Antichri∣stianism) and when this is done, the greater number will be on the LORD's part, to set up CHRIST, and to throw down Antichrist, that you may prosper and live long in the Land which the LORD hath given you; for David Reigned Forty Years by taking this way of method, to purge his own Heart, House and Kingdom; and you hear how highly the LORD stiles him, to be a Man after his own Heart; and will you, Oh ye Princes! be negligent in so great a VVork both Internal and External, wherein so great a Happiness doth consist, as your Prosperity in this VVorld, and your E∣ternal Joy and Heavenly Felicity in the Life to come, for a Momentary Life of sinful Pleasure, which you know not but that Moment may be the last of your En∣joyment, as Christ said, Thou Fool, this Night shall thy Soul be required, and you know that it was David's true Repen∣tance, and deep Humiliation, that brought him into so great Favour with GOD; you hear how great the inward Travail
of his Soul was, to bring forth the VVill of GOD in all things as he required, which was the Ground from whence all his good External Actions of Government in his House and Kingdom did proceed: Nor did David hide his Light which he had received of GOD under a Bushel, but set it up to all the VVorld; for that end, no doubt, that all might see wherein he fell, and by what means he obtained Mer∣cy, and so he came to sing of Mercy and Judgment, unto thee, Oh LORD, said he, I will sing: He was not ashamed to Con∣fess the GOD whom he serv'd before Men; no, no, before the Gods will I sing praise unto thee, exalt the LORD our GOD, and fall down before his Footstool, for he is holy. Holiness becomes thy House, O LORD, and the place where thine Honour dwelleth; and thus was his whole Life a Life of Prayer and Praise, and admiring the LORD in all his wonderful VVorks. Again, as David was, as it were, proud of the LORD, in making his boast of him, in vehemently loving him, praising, ad∣miring, and exalting him above all things Visible or Invisible; even so doth GOD own David before all the VVorld, and
makes his boasts of him; and the good that he did to Israel was for his Servant David's sake; for, said the LORD to the Prophet Ahijah, I will not take the whole Kingdom out of Solomon's hand, but he shall be Prince all the Days of his Life, for David my Servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my Commandments, and my Statutes; but I will take the Kingdom out of his Son's hand, for his Father Solomon's Sin; yet I will give him one Tribe, that David my Ser∣vant may have a Light always before me in Jerusalem; and so the Mercy goes on in his Line till it comes to Christ: But was this a bare Historical Service or VVorship that GOD was so well pleased with in him; was it his going to the Temples, and offering Sacrifices? No, for he speak∣ing in the Person of Christ, said, Sacri∣fice and Offering thou wouldst not, therefore I come to do thy Will, Oh GOD, in a Body which thou hast prepared; and, said he, the Sacrifice which God requires, is a broken and a contrite Heart, and this Sacrifice David offered plentifully to the LORD in GOD's House, within him in his Soul, in his most inward parts, which is GOD's Temple and Dwelling-place; for Heaven is my
Throne, and the Earth my Footstool, then where is the place of my Rest? for all these things have I made, saith the LORD: And saith the Apostles, God dwelleth not in Temples made with hands: So then that out∣ward Temple was but a Figure of the in∣ward Temple, which was destroyed with the Glory thereof: And the inner∣most Sanctuary, where the High-priest was only to come, was a Type or Figure of the inward or innermost place in the Soul, where GOD will be worshipped, and whose Right it is to have his Habita∣tion there, in the Holiest of Holies; as our Lord and Saviour said to the Samaritan Woman, Ye worship ye know not what, the time cometh, and now is, that the Father will be worshipped neither in this Mountain, or that Mountain, nor at Jerusalem it self, but in Spirit and in Truth; for such the Fa∣ther seeks to worship him; altho' they were to wait at Jerusalem to receive this Pro∣mise of the Father, the Spirit of Truth, which would lead them into all Truth, as their Lord said to them, when their Hearts was fill'd with Sorrow at his de∣parture from them, It is expedient for you, saith he, that I go away; for if I go not
away, the Comforter will not come unto you, and when he is come, he will reprove the World of Sin. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Here you may see how weak and ignorant the Disciples of our Lord were, whilst only his Bodily presence was with them, tho' pure, chaste and holy; how ignorant were they of Divine Inspiration, Heaven∣ly Revelation, and the Secret Mysteries of the Kingdom? Which made Christ say, It's the Spirit that quickens, the Flesh profiteth nothing: And so saith the Apostle Paul, Altho' I once knew Christ after the Flesh, yet henceforth know I him so no more. So here you see he leaves the outward, and comes to the inward, saying, The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death: Here's a great change in Paul, since he was crying out of the Body of Sin and Death, saying, Who shall deliver me? Yet in this deplorable state, from a sight of Sin under the Law, there arises a little Comfort; I thank GOD, saith he, that with my Mind I serve the Lord, tho' my Flesh wars against the Spirit, and tempts me to Sin; yet here is no evidence that
Paul yielded to the Tempter, but contra∣ry, overcame the Temptation. I besough the Lord thrice, said he, and who can te but that thrice was threescore; and th Answer makes good the Effect, My Grac said GOD, is sufficient for thee: So her was the Grace presently at hand to help and strengthen Paul to overcome th Temptation, The Grace of GOD which hath appeared to all Men, teaching them to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live righteously and holily in this present evi World; so that if you join with the Grace as Paul did, and give up your strength and might to it; but if you deny to give up your strength and might, and join to the Temptation, then you resist the Grace where the Power is placed, and can have no Benefit thereof; for it's no Sin to be tempted, but to yield to the Tempter is the Sin; for our Lord himself was tem∣pted, but he powerfully resisted to the Death; and so did Paul, and so he fol∣lowed Christ, and bids us all do the same, Follow me, saith he, as I follow Christ; so Christ is the Captain, the Leader, the Law∣giver, and his Souldiers receives the Com∣mand from his Mouth, to follow him the
Captain of our Salvation, resisting power∣fully and manfully, fighting our way through all the Snares of Hell and Death, as that worthy Person of the Church of England said in his following Letter.
And thus, Oh King and Princes, you have the Example of all the Holy Fathers from Righteous Abel, and of all the good Kings, from David until this time, whose Names and Acts are upon Record, to be in Everlasting Remembrance before the Lord, and throughout all Generations, for a Memorial and Praise to all who follows their steps, in loving the Lord, and ful∣filling his Commands. But on the con∣trary, they that followed their pernicious Ways, both Kings, Princes, and People, that disregarded the Lord, and sought not the Honour of his Glorious Name, because of which, their Names became a Stink, a Proverb, a By-word of Reproach, not only to themselves, but all the Hea∣then round about them, till at last he cast them as Dung from his presence.
But before it came to this, how long was his Righteous Soul grieved with their Rebellions against Him and his Ho∣ly Laws, yet still he sent Messenger after
Messenger to reclaim them, declaring b them his Will and Pleasure; but the slighted his Messengers, and evil-intrea∣ted them, and so went on so long till hi pure Spirit was as it were weary with striving; and thus they sinned out the Day of their Precious Visitation, till the fier Indignation of the Lord took hold o them, and then as Dindimus said to Alex∣ander the Conqueror, They shall know th Pains justly inflicted by GOD upon unju Men; for he is a Judge of all Injuries, an the Sighs of those that are injuriously treated become the Pain of those that injure them
Then Oh ye Rulers of the People, see ing it is to be so, how great is you Charge, to make Laws for the Glory o GOD, and with all your Power to pu them in Execution; and to this you mu take his Jealousie for your Armour, an put on Righteousness for a Breast-plat and take true Judgment instead of an He met, and put on Holiness for an Invinc∣ble Shield, and sharpen his fierce Wrath for a Sword to Fight with him again the Unwise, as that great Champion Ph∣nehas stopt the Plague from the Childre of Israel, by his Valour, and fiery Zea
for GOD against the Workers of Iniqui∣ty; and if you do the same, who knows ut that GOD of his Infinite Mercy may top the Decree [that is gone forth against these Kingdoms of your Dominions] which are Great Plagues, and Amazing Judgments, and are just ready to break forth, if a speedy Reformation doth not prevent them? Then Wo and Alas what will become of all your Gallantry, Pride, Pomp, Ostentation, and Inordinate Lust that captivates Men, which now a whole World is not able to satisfie? Will the Honour and Glory of a perishing World avail you then! No; but be a gnawing Worm in your Consciences, which will make you Curse your Lovers, who were the Cause of your fooling away so Great a Glory, for so frivolous Vanities, and false Delights.
But will the destroying Angel pass by you because of your Greatness? O no, the Great and the Small, they are all one to HIM; but the Greater you are in Power, being Officers of HIS Kingdom, if you Judge not right, nor keep the Law of the Most HIGH, to fulfil the Will of GOD in all things, then horribly and
suddenly will he come upon you, to giv you the Reward of your Works; for th Lord will not hold him guiltless that bea his Sword in vain, and so Blasphemes h Holy Name.
And indeed it's dreadful to consider th Original of these things, which are, whe Men send their Sons to the Ʋniversities t learn something that is good, to be se viceable to GOD and the Common wealth; but instead of learning good they often learn all manner of Evi as Pride, Cunning, Craft, Subtilty, ho to over-reach the Simple, and to depriv him of that which he hath gotten by hi Sweat and Labour; and here they lear to Mock, Scoff, Blaspheme, Curse, Swear Cheat, Lie, with all shameless Vices, &c. If but one among them appear that fear∣eth GOD, they shout and wonder at him as if he were an Owl, and count him a Fool or Mad-man; and here they learn all Impudence: And these are they that must be Trusted with Churches, Schools, Uni∣versities, and Ordained to be the Shep∣herds of Christ, also these are preferred to Civil Governments, and Places of Trus and Authority in Common-wealth; and
such Superiors commit the greatest Wick∣edness, and the Inferiors learn of them: For as it was said, the Superior by his Craft and Subtilty gets the Estate of the Inferior to himself, by his Oppression and Extortion, and so constraineth the poor Glly Souls to labour hard, to maintain the Pride and Luxury of the Rich, and must be the Slave, Afflicting and Consuming his Body, when, at the same time, the Rich Man's Dogs fares better than the Needy Soul, and all this must be counted Equal, Just, and Right, altho' it be con∣trary to Nature it self, but having its Centre in the Dark or Bottomless Pit, where one Property of Darkness afflict∣eth, tormenteth, and tortureth the other, nd where the Life is at Enmity with it elf; and then another sort of Inferior earns of the Superior to maintain a Luxu∣ious Life, by Covetous Couzening, Cheating, Lying, Over-reaching the Sim∣le, and so Robbing one another of their Rights, Measures, and Weights, with∣ut Pity or Compassion to their poor di∣ressed Neighbour; and if notice is ta∣en of it, by way of Reasoning or Re∣roof, the Answer is, they are forced to






do so, to exact more Profit, and  to extort from their poor Neighbou without Mercy or Compassion, becau of the Oppression they lye under them∣selves, thus breaking the Precious Com∣mands of Christ, who saith, Love th Neighbour as thy self; and whatsoever  would have Men do unto you, do ye that un them; but contrary to this Heaven Maxim, the Inferior doth all this to follo the Superior in Riotousness, Luxury Pride, and the like; for what the Superi doth in State and Delicacy, that the I∣ferior doth in a Beastial manner of Lif and thus wickedness is wrought by wic∣edness, till the World is fill'd with Vi∣lence, and the Devil becomes Prince ov the Body and Soul of Mankind.
Wherefore seeing this to be the Cou of the World, their Force to be evil,  their Course not right, I thought it  Duty to Cry unto you, Oh ye Princes  the People! as the Woman of Abel cry to Johab for Mercy, even so cry I un you, that you would be Merciful  your own Lives and Liberties, by Enco raging and Establishing Righteousne and Suppressing all Vice and Wickedne
that ye may be able to stand before the Almighty and most Terrible GOD, who shall come to Judge the Secrets of Mens Hearts, together with their Publick Acti∣ons; in his fiery Zeal, and severe Judg∣ment, when the Superior and Inferior's Works must be put into the Fire, and here tried; or otherwise, how will the uperior be able to indure, when the Infe∣or-shall Cry out in the Anguish of his oul, saying, Wo, wo, be unto you Supe∣ors, for giving me occasion by your Exam∣ples to be Wicked, Lewd, and Ʋnrighteous: o be unto you that did not restrain us from ning against our Creator.
Oh then how will the Superior be able  stand before the Judge of all the Earth,  render an Account of his Office, where∣ he hath been set and placed for that d, to hinder Injuries, and all Unrigh∣usness, and to keep the Wicked in ve, by Reproof, Correction, and Pu∣hment; but alas! instead of taking s way of method to save Souls from struction, it hath been the study of  Superior how to satisfie his Covetous terprize, by getting the Estate of the erior to himself, and so hath coveted
his Money more than the good of h Soul; this is the Rule of the World, th is the Course both of Superior and Ins∣rior, of the Shepherd, and of the Shee devouring one another, as the great Fish in the Ocean devour the small, and a this under a Notion of Religion; Christ Passion and Sufferings must be the Cloa for all these Abominations: Here if the can but Confess themselves to be Christ ans with their Lips, tho' they lodge t Whore of Antichrist in their Hearts, th are secure: But Oh! ye False Shepherds  all sorts, throughout the World, who pr∣fess him in words, but climbs up into t Sheepfold another way than by Chr the Door, who are the ground Cause  all the Errors which the People lye inta gled in, by casting the Garment  Christ's Sufferings over the Hypocri and Deceivers, who have hardly the sh dow thereof, how much less the su stance? How will you Answer it, wh Christ shall require an Account of  Sheep from you, who have wittingly a wilfully for Favour of Money, Rich Honour, and Reputation, cover'd the S both of the Superior and Inferior? I
Christ do so, who told every one the Truth to his Face? He did both bruise and heal, not for Favour or Respect to the Person of any, but according to the Will of his Father, and ought not you to do the same? Ought not you to be their Pattern in well-doing, as he was? And then truly tell them they must Fight a∣gainst Pride, Lust, and an Hypocritical Life, that they must with speed go out of themselves, and enter into Righteousness, Love, and Humility; telling them plain∣ly, that the Passion of Christ will bene∣fit none, unless they turn from their evil, false, wicked Ways and Purposes, with a true and unfeigned Repentance; for so said our Lord, He that repents and forsakes shall find Mercy; and to him the Sufferings of Christ are powerful and profitable; and here he enters into Covenant with GOD, and is partaker of the sure Mercies of David; thus you would stand for GOD, and be a Witness against all Un∣righteousness.
Wherefore, I beseech both Old and Young, Superior and Inferior, in the Bowels of the Love of GOD, whilst it is called to Day, that is, whilst the Door
of Mercy is yet open to you, which I am a Witness for the Lord is; turn you,  turn you this Moment, put it not off til another time, but whilst it is to Day har∣den not your Hearts, for you know no but this may be the last Visitation of th Love of GOD, that Ever may be te∣dered to you; for the Earth is now fill' with all manner of Wickedness, the fier Wrath of GOD is at hand, the last Judg∣ment is at the Door, GOD will purge  sweep the Earth with Fire, and then giv every one his due Reward.
I have seen the Harvest ripe, th Grapes and Fruit just ready to drop; an it was said to me, This Crop of Wicked ness shall not stand, meaning througho the Universe; therefore I humbly be that you will not neglect this great Salva∣tion, which the Holy GOD tenders  you at this time; and say not in yo Hearts, Who shall ascend to fetch it fro above, or descend to fetch it from b neath, because it is in you; the Word  Faith is in you, the Power to do  VVill of GOD is in you, because Chri the Hope of Glory, is in you, and in hi is the Power placed; so that you need 
go to the Universities for it, or Travel beyond the Seas in far Countreys to seek for VVisdom in remote places, for she standeth at the Door of your Hearts knocking, saying, Open to me my Beloved; and if she find a Soul that is emptied of it self, hungering and thirsting after the Love of Christ, as David's was, when he said, As the Hart panteth after the Water∣brooks, so panteth my Soul after thee, O God, then she there reveals her self; but if the Soul yield it self to her for a full Possessi∣on, then she penetrateth through it with her inflaming Fire of Love, and unlock∣eth Mysteries to the Soul; so that there is no more need of searching, and painful toyling about it, for every simple Man may attain it, if he do not hinder himself by his own willing and running from GOD to the Creatures: As for Example, the Prophets and Apostles who were sim∣ple ignorant Men, before they were cal∣led, and then after they were called, they waited to receive the Promise, and in this waiting state they received the Blessing; for said Christ, Blessed shall that Servant be, who is found waiting; so here the Soul witnesseth what John said, That which we
have tasted and handled of the Word of Life, we declare unto you: They declared it to them, but they could not give it to them, they could only give direction how to at∣tain it, but could not give them the Life and Vertue thereof, that they must seek themselves; as Christ said, Seek, and ye shall find, knock, and it shall be opened to you the Mysteries of the Kingdom of GOD, the Heavenly Wisdom, which is first pure, and then holy; and whose awakeneth to he betimes, saith Solomon, shall have no great Travail, for he shall find her sitting at his Door. To think upon her, saith he, is per∣fect understanding, and whoso watcheth for her, shall be soon without Care, for she i the School-mistress of the Knowledge o GOD, and a pure influence that floweth from the Glory of the Almighty, there∣fore can no defiled thing come unto her I loved her, saith he, above Health, an purposed to take her for my Light; for he Light cannot be quenched, because Love is the keeping of her Laws, and the keeping of he Laws is the assurance  Immortality, and Immortality maketh  near to GOD there∣fore the desire of Wsdom leadeth to the King∣dom.

 If your Delight be then in Thrones and Scepters, O Kings of the People, Ho∣nour Wsdom that you may Reign for Ever; for if Riches be a Possession to be desired in this Life, what is Richer than Wisdom, that worketh all things? I, said Solomon, preferred her before Scepters and Thrones, and counted Riches nothing in comparison of her, neither did I compare Pre∣cious Stones unto her; for all Gold is but a little Gravel, in respect of her, and Silver shall be counted but Clay before her; where∣fore I prayed, and understanding was given me, I called, and the Spirit of Wisdom came into me; for when I perceived I could not enjoy her, except GOD gave her, and that that was a point of Wisdom to know whose Gift she was, then I went unto the Lord and besought him, and with my whole Heart, I said, O GOD of my Fathers, and LORD of Mercy, which hast made all things with thy Word, and ordained Man through thy Wisdom, that he should have Dominion over the Creatures, which thou hast made, and govern'd the World with Equity and Righ∣teousness, and executed Judgment with an up∣right Heart; give me that Wisdom which
sitteth by thy Throne, and put me not out from among thy Children; for, tho' a Man be never so perfect among the Children of Men, yet, if thy Wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded: Thy Wisdom, O Lord, which was with thee when thou made the World, which knew what was acceptable in thy sight: O send her out of thy Holy Hea∣vens, and from the Throne of thy Glory, that she being present may labour with me, that I may know what is acceptable in thy sight; for otherwise who can know thy Counsel, with∣out thy Holy Spirit; for so the Ways of them which are upon Earth are reformed, and Men are taught the things that are plea∣sant unto thee; and are preserved through thy Wisdom.
So far the VVisdom of Solomon, which may give you to understand the way he came by all his Excellent and Unheard of VVisdom; he prayed and sought the Lord with his whole Heart, as David his Father did, daily waiting at VVisdom's Gate; and well had it been for him if he had never departed therefrom; which may be a Caution to all Princes to watch and pray, lest they enter into Temptati∣on:
So this is that VVisdom and Power from on High that you are to wait for, O King and Parliament, even the Spirit of Truth to lead you into all Truth, to be with you in Council, to go before you in all your Acts, whether Internal or Ex∣ternal; for without this you can do no∣thing which will be Acceptable to GOD, or Good Men.
VVherefore, O Parliament of England, let my Council be Acceptable to you, and break off your Sins by Righteousness, and your Iniquities by shewing Mercy to the Poor: But if you will not receive this Admoniti∣on, I'll weep in secret for your Sins; therefore I beseech you, let not such a Spirit be found in the Parliament House, as shall presume to make a Mock or a De∣rision at these great and weighty Truths, as knowing the Penalty thereof, That whosoever falls on that stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever he falls shall be broken to pieces.
The next is, if I may be so bold to ask, VVhy the Tax is laid so heavy upon the Commonalty? I know the Answer may be soon given, Because the Nation is much
in Debt, and the King greatly necessita∣ted for Money to Pay off his Fleet and Army: VVell, but why then do you les∣sen your own, by Taxing your Lands lower than before, whereas you ought rather to have made the Peoples Burthem lighter, and your own heavier, as all o you being Men of Considerable Estates, and best able to bear it, which would hav tended not only much more to your Ho∣nour, but also lessened the Peoples Com∣plaints and Murmurings against you which I hear daily to my great Grief.
Oh that the Wisdom from above had been with you, to have directed you more equally to have laid them; which  humbly propose, Whether the High Heads, Black Patches, Rich and Costly Apparel, Playhouses, all sorts of Gaming Drunkenness, Whoredom, Swearing, Cursing, taking the Name of GOD in vain, Feasting and Rioting, Couzening and Cheating, Over-reaching the Simple False Weights and Measures, Long Pe∣riwigs, a great Tax to be laid on them Washes, Paintings, all sorts of Sports Perfumes, Packs of Dogs, Costly Furni∣ture
in Houses, Jewels, Rings, Neck∣laces, with all the rest of those needless Vanities; and all Taverns, and other Houses, that suffers any to have more than their Necessity requires, to be large∣ly Taxed, both the Giver and Receiver; and the Cursed Playhouses to be severely Taxed, and Players greater, and every particular Person, Men, Women, and Children, that goes to them, greatly Taxed, according to their Quality; also many other things of this kind, which your VVisdom may find out to lay heavy Taxes upon; and here no Mouth justly could have been opened against you, ex∣ept the wicked, whose Mouth GOD hath determined to stop; and, by these Noble Acts of Righteousness and Justice, your Name would have been as Precious intment poured forth, the Perfume hereof, as a good Savour, would have ast forth its fragrant Smell, to the fur∣hermost parts of the Earth; and here GOD would have Honoured you, O arliament of England, with a Name and ame beyond your Predecessors, as the ord hath promised, saying, They that
Honour me I will Honour, but they that Disregard me, shall be by me Disregarded, Samuel: So whether you will hear, or forbear, I have Discharged my Duty and am a VVitness for the Lord, that he is clear of your Blood.
