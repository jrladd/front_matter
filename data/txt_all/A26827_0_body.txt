My LORD,
IN Obedience to your Lordship I have here taken the Confidence to present a very mean, and imperfect Discourse to the View of a most Critical, and Discerning Age. And yet might I be allow'd to plead the Hastiness of its Com∣posure, without being thought to urge a Crime in excuse of a Crime, and to defend One fault by Another; possibly it would need no other Apo∣logy. But if that may not be insisted on, I have only this Favour to request of the World, that they would believe the Author to have as mean an Opinion of these Sudden Thoughts, as They can have, and that They would look upon them only as an instance of the incomparable Candor of Your Lordship; In pure compliance with whose Pleasure it is, that they are thus made
publick. And since they are so, may it please that God, who can work His ends by very small, and contemptible (for He has oft times done it without any) Means, to bless them for some Good to those who have not yet learn'd duly to revere their Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Supe∣riors.
And may the same God long continue your Lordship A Blessing to his Church, An Ornament to this See, and an Eminent Example of Virtue to All that know You. In which Prayer, I am perswaded, there is not a Person in Your whole Diocese, that Fears God, Honors the King, or Bears any Affection to the Establish'd Religion, but will heartily concur with,
My Lord,
