YOVNG, Ancient Seruant of our Soueraign Lord,
Graue Maister of thy Maister's minor-years;
Whose Prudence and whose Piety appears
In his Perfection, which doth Thine record:
Whose loyall Truth, His royall Trusts approue
By oft Embassage to the greatest Peers:
Whose Duty and Deuotion He endeers
With present Fauours of his Princely Loue:
In Honour of these Honours many-fold,
And for memoriall of Thy kinde regard
Of these poore Orfanes (pyn'd in Hope-les cold)
Accept these Thanks for thy firm Loues reward;
Wher-in (so Heav'ns prosper what we haue sung)
Through euery Age thou shalt liue euer YOVNG.
