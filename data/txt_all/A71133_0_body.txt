IT did not need any long Dispute with me to whom I should present this Account of the Reve∣rend Mr. Trench's Life, drawn from his own Breviate of it; when I consider'd not only your Relation to him, (the one by Marriage, the other by Blood;) but that extra∣ordinary peculiar Affection to you both, which his Di∣ary so frequently abounds
