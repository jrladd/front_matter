May it please your Honour,
TO admit this Act of Re∣cordation, that 'tis full Fourteene yeares since the happy Aspect of your gracious Favour did reflect upon me, for my good both by Sea, and Land:

which left in me such an Impression of the Character of your Noble and Reli∣gious Disposition, that to this very Day edgeth a fresh desire to take this advan∣tagious (though in another respect, a sad) Opportunity to testifie my dutifull re∣spect to your Honour. It may be, this Art of Building Comfort is not so arti∣ficially, and laboriously composed, as you have heard, and was pleased to countenance some Vniversitie-Pieces of mine: there might be more oyle be∣stowed on them, to varnish the Face of their style; but this Treatise is allow∣ed more Wine to comfort the Heart of the Reader. This induced me to present to your gracious Acceptation, this Ear∣nest of that Debt of Thankfulnesse, wherein both your Favours, and Deserts (tàm Arte, quàm Marte) have bound me to you: a small Earnest is sufficient to binde the greatest Contract 'twit a bountifull hand, and a thankfull Heart. Let this be such of my Gratitude, and not onely a Pledge of Mine, but a Re∣membrance of Hers, (I meane my dead

Wife) whose Living Thankfulnesse to God for your Favours to me, you had, though not made knowne unto you. And if your more then ordinary Em∣ployments will permit you to read over, either Her deserved Commendation: or Her Epitaph which is much too nar∣row for her worth, (both are in the ad∣joyning Pages) then I hope your Lord∣ship will have no cause to repent the De∣dication of this Treatise. In the meane time my Experimentall knowledge, that in you the Nobilitie of Descent and Minde concurre: the Eminencie of Parts in your selfe, and Affabilitie of Dispo∣sition to others do mutually reflect each on the other: which Harmonie may well challenge this my voluntary Obla∣tion, as a necessary Obligation, that for ever tyes me to fixe my Devotions on Heaven, and heartily to pray for your temporall, spirituall, and eternall Hap∣pinesse.
