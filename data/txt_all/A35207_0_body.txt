May it please Your Majesty,
IT is not a Desire to appear
in Print hath made me to
write, or a fond Opinion of
what I have written, to affix Your
Great Name to these Papers, but a
true Affection to my Native Country,
and the Cause Your Majesty is now
ng ag'd in; A War, on whose
good Success depends the Securi∣ty
of Religion, Liberty, and Pro∣perty,
both to Your own Subjects,

and likewise to all the Protestant
Interest in Europe; A War, as it
is absolutely necessary, and must be
carried on with Vigour, so it is like
to be long and chargeable, and so
much longer, as we abate in Our
Vigorous Prosecution; A War,
which may strain the Nerves and
Sinews of our Treasure before it
be ended, and therefore as in Mar∣tial
Discipline great Wisdom must
be used to secure those Posts where
the Enemy bends most of his
Forces, so here 'tis Prudence to
strengthen our Treasure, by advan∣cing
and securing our Trade which
must bring it in; If this was done,
Taxes would be easily paid, and
little felt, and without it this Na∣tion
will at last become Bankrupt,
when its Expences exceed its Pro∣fits.
The Foundations of the Wealth
of this Kingdom are, Land, Ma∣nufactures,

and Foreign Trade, these
are its Pillars, which ought not
to be overshaken, they have hi∣therto
borne the Burthen, and
felt the Smart of the War, and
'tis time now they should slide
their Necks out of the Collar, other
ways may be found out to raise a
greater Summ annually than Your
Majesty's Occasions will require,
without Four Shillings per Pound
on the first, Excises on the second,
or a Tunnage Bill on Ships on the
last, an Act which lighted heavy on
the Merchant, and left no room to
consider whither he gained or
lost by the Voyage, or whither
the Ship returned home full or
empty.
The Methods for Raising Mo∣ney
must be easie, when the annu∣al
necessary Summs are to be so
great, therefore it would be Poli∣cy
in our Law-makers to make use

of those which may least hurt any
part of our Vitals, such as Land
and Trade are; I mean that part
of Trade which is useful to the Pub∣lick
God, not that which is ma∣naged
only for private Men's Ad∣vantage;
it may be possible to
rate the Trader, and yet to spare
the Trade.
There are two things which
seem to be of great Importance
to this Nation, and very necessary
to be look'd into.
First, The better securing our
Plantation Trade, so as it may more
absolutely depend on this King∣dom
than it hath hitherto done;
this will not only encourage our
Navigation, when all their Product
shall be imported hither, but also
much advance Your Majesty's Re∣venues,
when such quantities of To∣bacco
shall not be carried thence di∣rectly
to foreign Markets; to prevent
which, and secure Your Majesty's

Duties when Imported, plain and
practicable Methods may be pro∣posed;
and the Consequence there∣of
would be, that this Kingdom
being the Mistress of that Commo∣dity,
Your Majesty's Coffers would
be filled, not only from its Home
Expence, but also by a Tribute
raised from Foreign Nations, where
it would very much lie in Your
Majesty's Power to set its Price;
I do not think new Imposts upon
the Importer will so much advance
Your Majesty's Revenue as they
will discourage the Merchant,
'twould be better to take away
those already laid, and instead
thereof to raise a far greater Summ
on the Consumer, which may be
done without the Clog or Oppres∣sion
of Officers, in such a manner,
that it shall scarce be felt, either by
the Retailer or Spender.
The next thing is the securing
our Wool at Home, and making

this a Market for all the Wool of
Christendom, whereby England would
soon become the Queen of Europe,
and flourishing in its Manufactures
grow Rich by the Labour of its
People, and consequently might
better afford to import Commo∣dities
to be spent on Luxury; I
take it to be one great Reason why
the Kingdom of Spain still continues
poor notwithstanding its Indies, be∣cause
all that the Inhabitants buy is
purchased for its full Value in
Treasure or Product, their Labour
adding nothing to its Wealth, for
want of Manufactures; I am apt
to think greater Steps may be made
in this than have hitherto been done,
and our Wool may be kept at
home, not by punishing the Ex∣porter
with Death, but by apt
Methods to prevent his doing it;
and when a Lock is put on Ireland
and Rumny-Marsh, Foreign Coun∣trys

will more easily be prevailed
on to send us theirs.
These things seem worth the
Consideration of the ensuing Par∣liament,
a great many Members
of the last to my certain Know∣ledge
began to be much in Love
with Trade, and have often lament∣ed
the dark Notions That House had
of it, for want of being put into
a better Light by those who ought
to have represented it truly to
them.
Which hath been a great Induce∣ment
to me in the writing this
Tract, that I might set forth the
Interest of England in Relation to
its Domestick and Foreign Traffick,
and how both may be better impro∣ved
to the Advantage of the Nation.
King Solomon, who was pleased
to encourage Trade in his Domi∣nions
by his Royal Example, soon
found it to be the weightiest Jew∣el

in his Dyadem, bringing him
in more Treasure from abroad,
than all the Tribute he received
from Judea; The Trade of this
Kingdom hath always been a pro∣fitable
Ornament to the Crowns
of Your Royal Predecessors, Kings
and Queens of this Realm, and
it may be still so to Your Maje∣sty's,
if the Causes of its languish∣ing
were inquired into, and apt
Methods applyed for its Recovery.
That it may please God to make
this Nation happy, by giving Your
Majesty a long Life, crown'd with
Victories over the Enemies of its
Peace and Tranquility, is the Pray∣er
of
