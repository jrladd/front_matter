IF GOD HIM selfe so bitterly in∣ueieth against the extreame ingrati∣tude of his people by his holy Prophet Esaias, saying: I haue nourised, & brought vp children, and they haue re∣belled against me: yea, if hee preferreth bruite beastes in the re∣turne

of their duetie before them, saying: The oxe knoweth his owner, and the asse his mai∣sters crib: but Israel knoweth not me.
If the Persians likewise, so wor∣thily abhorred this vice of Ingra∣titude, so as they extremely puni∣shed such as they found more wil∣ling to receiue, than readie to re∣quite, adiudging them execrable vnto God, iniurious to nature, and vnprofitable members of a common wealth.
If the Ciuill Lawe also, with good reason bindeth men by nature ad antidora, to requite a good turne receiued in duetie.
I trust no reasonable man will blame me, if I seeke by all meanes possible, to shunne so foul a blemish as vnthankefulnesse is, so hatefull to God, so lothsome to man, and so

repugnant to nature.
Wherefore, finding my selfe deepely indebted (by your onely meanes) to all the name of Hassel∣wood, and namely to master Ed∣ward Hasselwood, your good brother, and to that vertuous gen∣tlewoman his wife, (a rare example of godlines and modestie) but espe∣cialy to your worship, both for them and all other your kindnesse, curte∣sie, and great frindships shewed to∣wardes mee a stranger. And ha∣uing no other way in the world, to requite any part of the same, then by leauing a publike testimonie to all posteritie, of my loyall loue, and hartie good will towardes you like∣wise, to stande for the meede of so great a merite: I haue presumed to dedicate to your worship, this litle booke of S Augustines, translated by me into English, and with great

labor quoted, & confirmed by scrip¦ture in the margeant, as you see, very profitable to the Christian Reader, that can finde in his heart, to sequester his mind from the vice of vaine-glory, (that proceedeth from the ignorance of our owne e∣state) the very snare of Satan, the puddle of pride, and the fountaine from whence distilleth all kinde of poysoned infection, as by the viewe of this glasse may easily appeare.
Wherfore the premises due∣ly considered I doubt not, but that you will of your accustomed curte∣sye, pardon my presumption, and of your wonted Zeale to godlines, accept of my trauaile herein, and thinke me rather vnable, then vn∣willing any way to discharge my dutie whereof I am carefull, as knoweth the Lorde, who euer pre∣serue your worship and that ver∣tuous

Gentlewomā your wife long to continue amongest vs with increase of godlinesse, and worshippe in his feare.
