MY LORD,
YOur late Entertainment at Oxford, was all on a suddain, and therefore no marvaile if something meane & unsuitable (My Lord) unto your Excellencies merit, as unto our de∣sires and well wishes. If your tri∣umph here bore any proportion to your Victory abroad, it was on∣ly in this, that the one was as quickly over, as the other, your work short, your triumph short, both done in such hast, as if you cared for neither. Well may you on such an occasion as this, take up the Emperour of Romes three words, who to set forth how speedily all his work was done, wrote down thus in short, Veni, Vidi, Vici: So may you also say, adding one word to his Ve∣ni, Vidi, Vici, Triumphavi, all was speedily over, you went out, you looked on, you overcame, you triumph∣ed, you returned, and the newes of the first could scarce runne before, and get a foots ground of the last. Whiles you were here, every one most gladly brought you his Present, and all places strove to yeeld you some requitall for past kindnesses: The Schooles prepared a Banquet, remembring they had bin of late yeares con∣verted to Granaries, but you had purged them of their
 Leaven: The Convocation-house called you to the Scarlet Robe, but that Reverend Senate there could not but acknowledge, that whil'st they gave you a Robe, by this last Victory they owe unto you even their owne. The Orators on all sides presented you with their rich and choise Eloquence, but they are these who must confesse, but for you and the worthy Champi∣ons that are with you, might have sung the songs of Si∣on in a strange land.
I speak not this, that you should glory in your selves who are nothing all of you, but in the Lord Christ who hath drawn his sword, and musters the battaile & is the Generalissimo of his Church in those latter daies. Now whiles others like Arauna to David, thus made a noble offering, so it was with me (I must confesse) who am daily spent with publike services here, that I could not make you better provision on so short war∣ning, then Ahimelek did for that same David, setting be∣fore you and your Captaines a little Shew-bread, & to bring you forth Goliahs sword, and the Armes of the old Warriers, which hang up in the Sanctuary, Gidions, and Baraks, and Sampsons, and Davids experiences, that may strengthen your hands in battell, and by holding forth this discourse of the atchievments, and admira∣ble workings of Faith, to proclaime from God unto you, In hoc Vinces: which sithence you have so well ac∣cepted, I again recommend it to your remembrance, and to the blessing of Almighty God, to whom only be all Glory, and strength, and victory, and wisdome ascribed for ever
