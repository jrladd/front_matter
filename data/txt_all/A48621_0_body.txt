AS soon as my spare
houres were deli∣vered
of this birth;
I resolved it should be
yours. Not that you
cannot converse with
Lipsius when you please,
without the help of an
Interpreter: Nor that I
pretend by so slight
a present as this, to dis∣count
with him; who

ha's ever been ready to
perform me all the best
Offices that can be ex∣pected
from a generous
and disinterested friend∣ship.
But, to speak
truth, I have done it in
a kind of tenderness to
my self: I know you
will look upon my pre∣fixing
your name to this
Essay with other Eyes
than some others would;
and will interpret that
to be the Fruit of a
well-meaning affection;
which perhaps they

would have called the
bold effects of an unpar∣donable
presumption. Being also conscious to
my self, in what man∣ner
I have humbled that
mighty Genius, which
moves it self (with a pe∣culiar
and happy ele∣gancy
as well as reason)
throughout almost eve∣ry
page of our Authour,
by the cheap and base
allay I have brought un∣to
it: I determined to
appease his Manes, and
make him some amends

at least by the choice of
such a patronage as pos∣sibly
himself would not
have refused: I am sure
I do not flatter you,
when I say you are none
of those degenerate Brit∣tains,
whom Gildas their
own Country-man calls
aetatis atramentum; but such
a one as Lipsius himself
dothelse where describe.
—In quo, veteris vestigia recti
Et mores, video, ductos meliore metallo.
In whom the prints of ancient worth
appear,
And the choice draughts of manners
are as clear.
Go on Sir, and as
you have hither to very
happily avoided those
Rocks, whereupon
some others (in an Age
like yours, and through
the dangerous allure∣ments
of a fortune at
command) have fatally
split themselves: So let
every new accession of
years, bring along with
it such improvements,
as may force us to ac∣knowledge,
that you have more than acquit∣ted
your self of all that

your youth had so libe∣rally
promised. These
are such wishes as he
shall ever be prone to;
who is
Coventry,
Octob. 1668.
SIR,
