SIR,
THis Book was engendred in a Cloud, born a Captive, and bred up in the dark shades of Melan∣choly; He is a true Benoni the son of sor∣row, nay, which is a thing of wonder∣ment, He was begot in the Grave by one who hath been buried quick any time these five and fifty months: Such is the hard condition of the Author, wherin he is like to continue, untill some good An∣gell roll off the stone, and raise him up, for Prisoners are capable of a double Resurrection; my Faith acertains me of one, but my fears make me doubtfull of

the other, for, as far as I see yet, I may be made to moulder away solong among these walls, till I be carried hence with my feet forward: Welcom be the will of God and the Decrees of Heaven.

From the Prison of the Fleet. this May day 1647.
