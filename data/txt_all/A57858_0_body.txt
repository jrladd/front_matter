Reader,
AFTER I had finished these Sheets, I mett with a Paper
in Answer to the same Pamphlet that here I deal with,
which at first made me lay aside thoughts of publishing this
Piece: Yet I after considered, that few things are coincident
in that and this Paper: And that tho' the Pamphlet it self
deserveth no such notice: Yet some may either through prejudice, and a by∣ass
to the one side, or through unacquaintedness with our Affairs, receive
undue impressions of Presbyterians and their way from the confident affir∣mations
of that Author. For, Calumniare audacter, aliquid adhaerebit.
Therefore I was willing to suffer it to go Abroad after it, and the Appen∣dix
to it, had been ready for the Press, now more than 13 or 14 Months: Se∣veral
things concurred to occasion this procrastination, which I shall not
trouble the Reader with.
