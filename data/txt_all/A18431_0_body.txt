AS amongst all humane things (right Honorable and most renowmed
Lady) vertue & learning are most excellent, euen so (in mine opinion) the
daintiest Diamond set in the purest golde of this world is not any way
cōparable to the worthy graces which spring of either of them. Wherfore,
hauing made trial of the most honorable affection & god∣lie zeale you beare
to them both, and know∣ing how wonderfullie and laudablie the rare flowers of
the same, deck and adorne you on euery side, I thought good by your singular 
 and most splendent vertues therunto moued and perswaded, so much
to imbolden my self as humbly to beseech your honor, to vouch∣safe the
patronizing of this slender pamphlet; and to take vpon you the keeping of this
litle sweete Garden, that neither the wilde Boare destroy it, neither carping
Knights, or any of Momus wightes deuoure it, but that it may haue free
passage (by your Honourable assi∣stance) amongst all godly Christians. And they
viewing the same, maye the easier see the abhominable vices, and vaine vanities
of this lothsome Laborinth, and the better per∣ceiue the most miserable
calamities and end∣lesse tortures and torments of hel, that fierie lake and
kingdom of Satan. And also behol∣ding the vnspeakeable felicities & most
glad∣some ioyes of heauē, may so run their course in this life, that they may
eschue the vanities of the one, and after death escape the dangers of the
other, & with the holy Angels & saints of God eternally enioy all happy
and most comfortable felicities in the blessed kingdom of heauen. The premises
therefore dulie con∣sidered, and my good meaning discreetly pondered, I doubt
not but that you will ac∣cording  to your accustomed curtesie
to∣wards all men, pardon my presumption, and of your woonted zeale to godlines,
accept of my triuiall trauell which in my idle houres I bestowed herein, and
thinke me raher vn∣able then any
way vnwilling to discharge my duetie, whereof as I ought, so I haue bene euer
most carefull, and pleasing God) will during life, so remaine. Thus referring
my labours to your godlie censure, I beseech the Almighty to graunt you,
whilest you liue in this troublesome soile, most prosperous health, and perfect
strength of body to gods glorie, and your hearts desire, and after this life
ended, most happy arriual vnto the bles∣sed hauen of eternall felicities, and
that your soule may there with the holie Angels and Saints of God, for euer
haue the pefect frui∣tion of all ioyes.
