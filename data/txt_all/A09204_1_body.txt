DEare Henries losse, Eliza's wedding day,
The last, the first, I sorrowed and song,
When laid my reedes for euermore away,
To sleep in silence, Isis shades among:
Dead to the Muse, and many-headed throng,
Through hard constraint of fruitlesse Hope compell'd:
And Enuie rife, that kills with canckred tongue
The sacred Bay, so honoured of eld,
Though left forlorne, ne now, of Phoebus selfe vpheld.


Where are the Summers when the righteous Maid,
With ev'nest hand the heauenly Scale did weild,
And golden Deed with golden meed repaid:
When Vertue was in price, for Vertue, held,
When Honours daintie but desert did guild,
And Poesie in graces goodly seene,
Rais'd her high thought, with straines that Nectar still'd?
Thy are ascended with that glorious Queene:
And she, alas, forgot, as she had neuer beene.



But dearest daughter of the greatest Ile,
Sole glorious Empresse of the Northren Maine.
Yet thou her glory: Since thou didst erewhile,
Thy bounteous hand, and sweet supportance daigne
Vnto my verse, and all vnworthie vaine:
As humblest Iue, by those armes I creep,
That gaue me growth, and first my entertaine,
Else lowly buried in Obliuion deep,
Who heere had heard me sing thy sweetest babe a sleep?


And him againe to waken with my song,
Which thousand tunes shall variously diuide,
As Vahale by thy flowerie bankes along,
I take my pipe at morne and euentide:
Hence may it downe thy gentle bosome glide,
And going on, allay th' enraged Rheine,
Where goodly Nimphes with Muses mild abide:
Who often in his surplusage of Wine,
Doe teach him Temperance, in songs and layes diuine.


Now while I shall beside this cradle sing,
Leaue Venus Queene a time thy siluer spheare,
And to mine aid thy daintie dearling bring,
With Mart appeased after death and dreare:
But from thy pure and peerelesse excellence,
Eliza mother, dreaddest Ladie deere,
Light, life, oh, lend vnto mine eine and sence,
For vigor haue I none but what I draw from hence.



And Royall child, who like another Sunne,
From Rosie bed arised'st in the East,
When that great light we saw extinct and done,
Ah Henrie, waild of euery gentle brest,
Dart one sweet smile vpon me early ghest:
And that my Muse with thine owue heigth may flie,
A feather shed from thy faire Phoenix nest:
So may she teach thy Fame to strike the skie,
And thee a Mirrour ake to all Posteritie.
