My Lord,
I Here present your Lordship with my Sermon; which you heard with so much Candour, and must profess my self glad of this opportunity to testifie the Respects, which I have for your self, and the Honourable Court of Aldermen, among whom there is not one Man, who hath not signalized his Loy∣alty in the late distinguishing times; when the Common-wealth Party strug∣ling for Empire with the Monarchy, engaged and Loyal Men to shew them∣selves to be so; and among those great, and publick Spirits, who durst stand up
for the Government, when a powerful and daring Faction durst oppose it, your Lordship was one of the most Eminent, for which His Majesty, willing to de∣clare His Royal Esteem for you, hath committed unto your Administration the Government of this City, which is ver∣tually the Government of the whole King∣dom; because, as London is well, or ill Governed, so will all the Country be.
If the Governours of the City beat down Schisme, and Faction, and keep the Citizens in Peace, and Order, the Magistrates of all other Towns will be able and willing to do the same; but if at any time they openly countenance Fa∣ctious and Schismatical Spirits, or un∣derhand connive at them, Faction, and Schisme will presently grow too strong for the Magistrates in the Country Towns. This, my Lord, hath been found true, by the experience of many years, insomuch
that the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen of London, are in effect the Governours of all other Cities, and Corporations, who will obey, or disobey their Magistrates in the same measure and proportion, as you will let the Citizens obey, or disobey you.
The King therefore, my Lord, hath done you a very signal Honour, in commit∣ting so Comprehensive a Trust unto you, the good, or ill management whereof will make him easie, or uneasie in his Govern∣ment, and the Nation happy, or unhappy; and as you, and your Loyal Brethren of the Bench, have in all things acted suita∣bly to the Greatness of this Trust, which his Majesty reposes in you: So, it is my hearty Prayer, among other Loyal Sub∣jects, to God, that this City may never want such a Lord Mayor, and such a Court of Aldermen, all of one Principle of Loyalty, and all hearty Lovers of their King, and the Church.

 We already feel the happy Effects of having such Loyal Governours over us, and if God in mercy please to continue the Blessing unto us, we shall within a few years see such happy days, as our Ance∣stors did, before the deceivable multitude were led into the Gain-saying of Corah, and taught to set up private Temples, and private Altars, in opposition to the Church. God grant that we may so walk, as to de∣serve the continuance of such a Blessing, which is the daily Prayer of
