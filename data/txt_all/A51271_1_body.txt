SIR,
THe natural and incomparable sweetness of your MAJESTY, who receives the humble offerings of Strangers, as well as those of your natural born Subjects, incourages me to take the liberty to consecrate this Military Discourse to your MA∣JESTY, which treates briefly of the most sublime, most perillous, and most difficult Subject in the World: The skill of Noble Men, the practice of Men of Valour, and the Exercise of Princes and Kings. An Art by which to get Honour, we must be both Masters and Scholars at once: For we must conquer in Learning, and learn in Conquering. This Dis∣course contains what the most experi∣mented of the Ancients do write upon that Subject: What I have heard say and seen practiced of late, by the bravest Men that our Age affords, amongst the most Warlike Nations of the World, which is a sufficient Warrant for the Truth of this Dis∣course, but not so sufficient as your MAJESTY's own experience, ha∣ving been your self in person in ma∣ny dangerous rencontres at the head of Armies, where your Royal Person was exposed, as if you had been immortal, which is the admira∣tion of all Europe, and the terrour of your MAJESTY's Enemies. Heaven grant that you may so excel in it, that the most generous Warriers may tremble at your Name, and seek for no other examples in Histories, than those of your great exploits. But Sir, if I was able to express my self upon this subject, instead of an Epistle, I should make a Panegy∣rick: But I want expressions, and I most humbly beg your MAJESTY's pardon, for the liberty I take to offer you this Discourse, and to give me leave to be silent wherein I cannot express my self: There is often much art in being silent, and silence was among the Ancients a great mystery. And therefore I shall say no more, but only beg your MAJESTY's pro∣tection, and the favour to give me leave to make bold to subscribe my self, with the deepest respect,
