Exquisite Lady,
WHose singular Perfections are sub∣lim'd beyond your Sex; Because the Dedication of Books is almost out of fashion with us (Augustus and Moecenas being long since extinct) and few favourers of Learning (especially divine Poësie) surviving, except your noble self, I have presumed to dedicate to your hand and Patronage, the Version of those Juvenalia, compos'd by the (women-displeasing) Poët Man∣tuan, and by him disposed into Ten Eclogues. And although (perhaps) I might have found some eminent Ladies for my Patronesses nearer

home, yet very few I doubt (scarce one of a thousand) but would have conceiv'd them∣selves so deeply concern'd in the fourth Eclogue, that these my labours must have despair'd of any benigne aspect from them. But your Excellent self (inhabiting another Region, soaring on the top of Pernassus, and rarified with the Soveraigne Influence of that perfu∣med Aire) is so free from Passion, clear in Judgement, and candid in Censure, that I nothing doubt of your Acceptance, Protection and Pardon. To you therefore (my tutelary Patroness) I dedicate these my Labours, which under your Name and Patronage shall be transmitted unto the courteous acceptance of the benevolent Reader,
