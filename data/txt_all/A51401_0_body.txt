May it please your Ladiship,
THE high esteem I have for the extraordinary worth of my De∣ceased Patron, hath, I confess, such an influence on me, that I cannot but think my self obliged to do him all the honour and service I can now he is Dead, as well as when he was Living: And I should think my self unjust, as well as un∣grateful, should I not lay hold on all op∣portunities to do it.
However I must also say, that I am
so conscious of my own Defects, that I should have been willing these following Meditations on the sad occasion of his Death, should have lain only in Private hands, had not your Ladiship exprest a a willingness to have them more publick. Not that I have any design to avoid or suppress the Publication of your Noble Lords worth, whose Memory I shall al∣ways honour; but that I fear my weak endeavours will rather Eclipse than render it Illustrious.
But your Ladiships Commands ha∣ving superseded all excuse, I dare not be backward in paying this my last duty to him: in doing which, though my Ex∣pressions have been short of his Due; yet I have hopes my zeal will Apologize for that defect, which, however illy ex∣pressed, I am sure is hearty and real.
I have not the vanity to think, that by what I have said, either in the Ser∣mon
or Character, I have added any thing to your Ladiships Comfort or know∣ledge; since as to the first, I am sure your Ladiship is no such stranger to Christi∣anity, as to be destitute of those good grounds it affords for that purpose. And as to the second, it would be a great piece of impudence in me to think your Lady∣ship should not know and retain a livelier Idea of this your Noble Lord, than what in my rude draught I have represented.
All therefore that I have done will serve more to inform others, than your Ladiship, who as they come hereby to be acquainted with the admirable Excel∣lencies of one more of the worlds most Famous Worthies; so in the perusing and considering what is here said of him, they may be further provoked to follow his steps.
Since therefore this unpolisht piece must by your Ladiships order come abroad,
I cannot but take the confidence to crave your Ladiships pardon for, as well as Patronage of it: which by reason of its meanness, I confess is as unworthy of the latter as it stands in need of the for∣mer. Hoping that though I have not drawn things so well to the life as they have deserved, yet my endeavours that way may be accepted, because in them I have chiefly aim'd to give a testimony to the world of the great Honour and E∣steem I have for the memory of the De∣ceased, and also to shew how much I am,
Right Honourable,
