With curious eye, view not these Pourtraitures;
I haue (deare Liege) your losse, limm'd, shadowed thus.
Let but my loue, which me of grace assures
Leaue thus farre forth obtaine, that Zoilus
In person of Apelles iudge not this:
AM I a Zeuxis, true colours not to misse?


Some polisht style, some fine and searching wits,
Liuing in Athens subtile temperate ayre,
Affoord diuiner poesies, heauenlier fits.
True, Royall Lord. Rude rythmes with vs are rare:
Your Highnesse though t'accept what Mantua offers,
ARmour of proofe t'will be gainst enuious scoffers.
