THE Judicious Philoso∣pher
Philo-Judaeus, in his
Book De Plantatione
Noe, saith, That when God had
made the whole World's Mass, he
created Poets to celebrate and set
out the Creator himself, and all his
Creatures: such a high Estimate
had he of those Genius of brave
Verse. Another saith, that Po∣ets
were the first Politicians, the
first Philosophers, and the first
Historiographers. And although

Learning and Poetick Skill were
but very rude in this our Island,
when it flourished to the height
in Greece and Rome, yet since hath
it made such improvement, that
we come not behind any Nation
in the World, both in Grandity
and Gravity, in Smoothness and
Propriety., in Quickness and
Briefness; so that for Skill, Vari∣ety,
Efficacy and Sweetness, the
four material points required in a
Poet, our English Sons of Apollo,
and Darlings of the Delian Deity,
may compare, if not exceed them.
—Whose victorious Rhime,
Revenge their Masters Death,
and conquer Time.

And indeed what is it that so
masters Oblivion, and causeth
the Names of the dead to live, as
the divine Strains of sacred Poe∣sie?
How are the Names forgot∣ten
of those mighty Monarchs,
the Founders of the Egyptian
Pyramids, when that Ballad-Poet,
Thomas Elderton, who did arm
himself with Ale (as old Father
Ennius did with Wine) is re∣membred
in Mr. Cambden's Re∣mains?
having this made to his
Memory,
Hic situs est sitiens atque ebr ius Eldertonus,
Quid dico, hic situs est; hic potius sitis est.
Now, Sir, all my Ambition,
that I address these Lines unto
you, is, that you will pardon

the Defects I have committed
herein, as having done my good
will no so short an Epitome to lay
a Ground-work, on which may
be built a sumptuous Structure; a
Work well worthy the Pen of a
second Plutarch; since Poetical
Devices have been well esteemed.
even amongst them who have
been ignorant of what they are;
as the judicious Mr. Cambden re∣ports
of Sieur Gauland, who, when
he heard a Gentleman express
that he was at a Supper, where
they had not only good Com∣pany
and good Chear, but also
savoury Epigrams, and fine Ana∣grams;
he returning home, rated
and belowted his Cook, as an

ignorant Scullion, that never
dressed or served up to him ei∣ther
Epigrams or Anagrams.
But, Sir, I intrench upon
your Patience, and shall no fur∣ther;
only subscribing my self,
