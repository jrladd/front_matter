HEnce, hence smal booke, thy foote steps see thou bend
Vnto all such whom Sathan luls asleepe,
Knocke hard rowze vp, tell them the day doth peepe
Then vnto those whose hearts all sorrowes rend:
That Wraths deluge hath measure, time and end,
Tell them, and that though sterne deuouring ire,
Like thunders lightning seeme to set a fire,
Their torturd soules, yet wish them but attend
A while, vntill cloud-vanishde Sunshine light
Appeare with ioy to giue their foes the foile,
Meane while their wounds bind vp with bame and oyle
Wait still, stay teares and feares with all thy might.
And if for all this, yet thou canst not please them,
Weepe still with them, for this perhaps may ease them.
