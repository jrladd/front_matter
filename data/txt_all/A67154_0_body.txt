Much honored Sir,
THe loving respects which your pains expressed to me∣wards, when some occasions urged me to make appli∣cation to your Worship, hath so far obliged me, that I should not acquit my self of ingratitude if I should let slip the opportunity I have to render your Worship Thanks:
And with all Sir, knowing your good affection to and per∣fection in Sciences Mathematical, and especially that most necessary, most profitable, and Honourable branch thereof, Navigation; I further make bold to Dedicate this the third Edition of Mr Edward Wrights Correction of errors in the Art of Navigation, to the acceptance and Patronage of you most honoured Sir.
The Author in his Time thought it a Present for a Prince, nay a splendent and illustrious Prince, and therefore Dedi∣cated it to the eldest Son of James King of great Brittain; viz. Henry, then Prince of Wales; whose budding vertues grow in you, whose Heroick spirit acts in you, and whose hopefull vallor and Corage powerfully and effectually mani∣fests its self in you.
But Sir, Its Patron is Dead, and so is the Elementary part of its Author; and a shame it were so worthy a work should again enter on the stage of the world without either Author to own it, or Patron to Protect it: And therefore Sir, as this motive moved me (who am now become the Dis∣poser of the Book) to Dedicate it to your Worship, so let the

same argument perswade you to accept it; that so as the for∣mer Impressions have found a current vent, this the latter Edition may by your good Countenancing thereof, receive the quicker sail, to the Profit of the Printer, the benefit of the Buyer, and the general profit and benefit of the whole Art of Navigation.
I desire the Almighty to bless your Worship with health and prosperity, and to carry you along in all your Worthy adventures: I wish your encrease of Honor, and honourable actions; and that you may shine at Sea as a Star of the first Magnitude fixed in the Zenith; that so your Name may a∣fright your Enemies, your deserts engage your friends, and your Example be as a Whetstone for all truly honourable, to set the edge of their vertues on.
