SEnding (Right Worship∣ful) some tokens vnto my friends in ENGLAND, I could not but pull out, not my purse, but my pen and dispatch the two sub∣sequent Exercises vnto you, as a signe of my Soules wish. My boldnes needeth your pardons, and my homely stile your favorable constructions. The first I haue ever found, and the second I presume wil never be lacking. Let the prophane puft vppe with BAALS leaven, swell like a Toade: they shall sooner burst than you haue cause to repent holy Zeale. Blessed Fore-guides, God hath given vnto you both, with more comfort may you fol∣lowe
 Christ with your Crosse. They that will not (through Pride and Carnalitie) be contented to beare the Crosse, shall haue no benefite by Christ his Crosse: but (as they deserue) be crossed out of the book of Life. And so, with the bowing of mine heart, I end.
Edinburgh, 1595.
