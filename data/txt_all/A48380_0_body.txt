MY LORD,
THE Countenance your Lordship has been pleased to give me has
emboldned me to beg leave that I may make this Address, as an humble
Testimony of my Zeal to the Work your Lordship has recommeded in a Circular
Letter to your Clergy.
Charity, indeed, is a Subject worn so threadbare, that I wish
it have not lost its warmth; and the frequent Oc∣casions of exercising it
(which should cherish and keep it alive among Christians, that ought to
rejoyce in all Op: portunities of doing Good) been the cause of its being too
much disregarded and shifted off.
For my own part, I desire it may not be thought Vanity in me to
declare, that my Sympathy, as well as the sence of my Duty, have engaged me
to promote this pious Work with all the Affection, wherewith I could at once
express and back your Lordship's Arguments, and my own to in∣courage and
set it forward.
The Parish, under my Care, is both Poor and Small, and therefore
not much to be expected from it; tho' I think I can say there is hardly Man,
Woman, or Servant, but have cast in their Mite. And should the
whole Nation give but as much, in proportion to their several Abilities (as,
I humbly beseech God, All throughout may) we need not fear coming behind the
Protestant Churches abroad in Contributions toward the relief of our Poor
Suffering Brethren.
To which purpose, I heartily wish this plain Discourse may
have an influence farther than I had thought of, had I not had a Sermon now in
the Press, Preached the last Year upon occasion of His Majesty's
Proclamation a∣gainst Profaness, &c. which should have been
out a Quar∣ter of a Year since, but for the neglect (to say no worse) of
one that was intrusted with it; out of whose Custody I was forced to take
it near two Months after the time he had engaged, by Promise under his Hand,
that it should be Printed. So that now, it being thus long defer'd, I
re∣solved this should wait on your Lordship at the same time with it;
and humbly desire your Lordship to accept of both together, as a sincere,
tho' mean, Acknowledgment how much I am,
My Lord,
 Dunsby.
Easter-Eve, 1699.
