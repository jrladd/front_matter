MADAME,
THE Tops of high Trees are mightily shaken by the windes, while the lower branches suffer a more gentle wagging; the thunder-bolts smie oftest upon the tops of eepest rocks, while the base valleyes enjoy a lme in a gentle gale.
Your HIGHNES, very eminent both in race and Place, hath felt this in your time,  much as any other of the land: As for the rticulars, divers are big, like Habbakuks vi∣n, which was in so great letters,Hab. 2.2. that men ight run, and read the same.
I know none in Scripture, except CHRIST, ho hath beene more put to the proof of pati∣ence
 then holy Job, his calamities were gre he was brought very low, but GOD at last, ¦ter he had humbled him, blessed his latter e more than his beginning:JOB 42.12. The Lord mak so with your Highnes, when all those stor are past, your end with the Righteous shall Peace.PSAL. 37.37
Let it please your Highnes to take in part this little mite of my Muse, with blessing, and most fervent prayers to GOD, soveraigne Comforts to cure all your Cros and to wipe the teares of troubles from  Eyes: Your Comfort is like the Prophets ¦sion, Though it tarry, waite for it, beca it will come,HAB. 2.3. it will not tarry.
