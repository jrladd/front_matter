My Honoured Lord,
TO say nothing of your Vertues, nor my obligations, (which indeed the highest and best Lan∣guage would rather dero∣gate
from, then any waies expresse.) In obedience to your commands, that as a Law must ever regu∣late my actions, I here pre∣sent you from the Presse with what you have al∣ready seen in loose Papers; yet so as I have not presu∣med to passe it under your name; because denying it the subscription of my owne, and too unworthy of such a Dedication; though truly you could not blame me, had I offen∣ded in both, since I onely give the mettle, you the stamp that sends it abroad
for good and currant; so as you owe me pardon and vindication if it shall reflect upon either, since I resigne both my own will and judgement to yours, and become rather passive then active in pub∣lishing these indigested thoughts, being in all things resolved to expresse my selfe
