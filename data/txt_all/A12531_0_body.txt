IT is a common opinion Right
Honourable amongst a great
number, who may be tearmed
more wayward then wise, that
the Art of Soldiery may per∣fectly
be attained in two or
three moneths practise, and that any common
man in a few weekes trayning, hauing seene two
or three skirmishes may be called an expert sol∣dier.
Not considering that a Mariner may saile
seuen yeares, and yet be far from a Nauigator.
A number of Mechanicall Artificers may labour
diuerse yeares, and yet be far from perfection;
and a number of Souldiers may serue many
yeares, and yet haue but the bare name of a soul∣dier.
He may well be called a trained souldier,

that knoweth by the sound of Drum, and Trum∣pet,
without any voice, when to march, fight, re∣tire,
&c. that is able in marching, embattelling,
encamping, and fighting, and such like, to per∣forme,
execute, and obey the lawes and orders
of the field, that hath some sight in the Mathe∣maticals,
and in Geometricall instruments, for
the conueying of Mines vnder the ground, to
plant and mannage great Ordinance, to batter
or beat down the wals of any Towne or Castle,
that can measure Altitudes, Latitudes, and Lon∣gitudes,
&c. such a one may be tearmed in my
opinion an expert souldier, though he neuer
buckled with the enemie in the field.
Such perfections is well knowne to be in your
Honour, that you are furnished with these and
many morare qualities in the Art Militarie, and
aboue all with wisedome and noble courage, to
performe and execute any honorable enter∣prise
whatsoeuer for the honour and seruice of
God, your Prince and countrie, the which our
proud enemies haue felt to their paine and your
euerlasting fame.
And although I my selfe be but one of the
meanest souldiers in this Guarison now vnder

your Lordships gouernement (whom we pray
long to gouern ouer vs) being brought vp from
my childhood vnder a valiant Captaine in Mi∣litarie
profession, in which I haue had a desire to
practise and learne some secrets touching the
orders of the field, and trayning of Souldiers: as
also concerning the Art of Managing and shoo∣ting
in great Artillerie. I haue thought it good
(hearing of no other that hath done the like be∣fore)
to frame together certaine Arithmeticall
and Geometricall rules, to shew in part how ne∣cessarie
Arithmeticke and Geometrie is for our
profession, the which I haue set downe in two li∣tle
bookes, the one intituled Arithmeticall Mi∣litarie
Conclusions, the other; The Art of Gun∣nerie:
the first I wrote two or three yeares since,
and bestowed on my Captaine, Sir Iohn Carie
Knight, the which (God sparing life) I meane to
correct & enlarge, & perhaps put to the Presse:
This other I haue thought it my part, to offer to
your Lordships good consideration, to be shrou∣ded
vnder your Honourable buckler, to beare
off the blowes of enuious tongues, which are e∣uer
ready to spit their spite against any vertuous
exercise: which although it be vnworthie to passe

vnder so honourable a protection, I hope your
Lordship will in indifferent ballance weigh my
willing mind, to do my countrie good, and your
Honour any seruice my poore abilitie is able to
performe, which if your Honour allow of, I shall
thinke my paines well employed, and shall en∣courage
me hereafter to bring this new found
Art into some better perfection, so farre as my
poore abilitie is able to put in practise, or my
simple skill in the Art will reach to. Thus loth to
be tedious, I cease: beseeching God to preserue
your Honour with much increase of honour, to
Gods glorie and your hearts desire.
