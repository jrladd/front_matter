My Lords, and Honourable Patriots,
JUstice of old being Painted, according
to her uncorrupt Nature, a Beautiful
Virgin, Embelish'd with all Vertuous
Array, Dragging and Smiting a Priso∣ner
on the Face, of a Deformed Aspect,
named Injuria, may cause some to Re∣present
this my Adress in unfortunat
Colours, with a Meen Compelling
Censure; Judgement being designed for punishing Misde∣meanour:



But such shall understand, that unless Obedience
be Culpable, my Dedication can have nothing of Iniquity.
My Lord, I appeal unto your self, if there be not here pre∣sented,
what you have so far Honoured, as of old to Request a
Copy, to which Motion I could name them who Adhered;
where still Declaration was made, (such was my Obligation)
that satisfaction should be given; but craved Time, expecting
a demurr, might procure a more beautiful Opportunity then
to offer it in the dark.
The Hoped for Season (Right Honourable) is now; and the
General Suffrage of Authors, Electing Patrons (for counte∣nancing
Treatises) for Evicting Gratitude in the Writer, and
Attracting Veneration from the Reader, I make Address with
this my DU ALIT AS before the Body of this Populous City,
in your Lordships Person, and Venerable Council, whose Inge∣nuous
Behaviour in a Succession of Years, towards all your own
Called and Elected Ministery, and to my Self in particular,
forms already Imaginations of Candid Acceptance.
How empty soever it may seem to others, your Honours
desire after it, to me, makes it Ponderous. Tyng me withall
in Gratitude, to wish your Bench prosperous in its Worthies,
and that your City, through the Vigilancy of its Watch-men
in both Employs, may continually merit its Gray-hair'd and
Ancient Epithet, being futurely known for the Good Town,
is the request of,
My Lord, and Right Honourable,

From my Study,
Septemb. 15.
1674.
