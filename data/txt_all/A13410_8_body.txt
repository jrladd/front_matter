Most Noble:
REligion ioyn'd with valour, lookes as well,
As a faire Diamond, set in purest gold,
These man-like, God-like parts in you excell,
And shall to after ages be inrold,
In leaues more lasting then the sheetes of brasse,
And in the fore-head of my diuine verse,
Your name with fame and honor forth shall passe,
Into all coasts of this faire vniuerse:
I do present to your inditious view,
The pistles 'twixt the Lambe and's holy Bride,
A very proper present 'tis for you,
That weares a sword to cause, her deside,

Strike still in truths defence, and you shall see,
Your euening crown'd with glorious victory:
Great Lord, my natiue place neighbours your north,
Then since my soule inhubits in that soyle,
And since my muse bath wing, and will flie forth,
She'll tell you of more ioyes then life hath howres,
And lookes for welcome, in your fairest towers,
Your floods and fords are faire, your swans but few,
But if you please with gracious eyes to view,
My diuine verse; and therein take content,
I'll build your trophies betweene tweed and trent.
