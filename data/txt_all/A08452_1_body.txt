REnowmed Nimph, of Britaine land, the guidance great, & staie,
Which dost most glorious shine in peace, & true religious waie
Which glittering in thy liues deserts, & manners radiant light,
Exceld'st Zenobia, or if one excelled her, by right,
In rule which Iuno, Uenus faire in forme, Minerue in art
Expressest, and more virtue shrinst, then female sexe in hart:
Come fauorable, happie slide, to these attempts of myne,
Thy gratious looke (O goddesse) shall, as power of godhead shine.
The worke is hard, I may not prop so huge, and vast a molde,
Lesse with thy friendly aspect, thou (mee goddesse) do behold
Looke friendlye, (goddesse bright) and see, what hard exploites of yore.
Thy great forefathers haue atchieu'd, three hundred yeares and more.
Whose royall chaier, and Diademe, since thou (O nimphe) sustaines,
Their glory wonnne in bruntes of Mars, vnto thy laude remaines,
Nor tis vnmeete fearce battailes, to a virgin to expresse,
Then pleasaunt peace, the brunts of wars did Pallas please no lesse.
Therfo this work (most worthy Queen) with gratious coūtenāce take,
Thy iudgement settes mee bolt vpright, or fondred flat doth make,
Though all men mee abiect, and spurne, I nought them all regarde,
It is inough, if from my Muse thy liking bee not bard,
God graunt that longe in natiue peace, thou maist enioy the crowne,
And eke excell thine auncestours, in glory, and renowme.

Your Maiesties most humble and dutifull subiect,
C. O.
