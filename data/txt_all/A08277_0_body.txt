I Know not how to
excuse mee (most
gracious Prince) in
that I haue presumed

to attempt a matter of
so high and diuine a
subiect (considering
what I am) and to ad∣uenture
it to your
Highnesse (knowing
who you are) but that
my heart was willing,
& ouercame a weake
vnderstanding, which
(first) it may please
your Highnesse of your
princely clemency to
accept, namely, the

will, and to pardon the
deed; for I may truly
protest that I intended
herein nothing lesse
than to be thought de∣sirous
to seeme so im∣pudent
as to giue your
Highnesse the least (or
to thinke that you nee∣ded
any other) aduice
or counsell in this be∣halfe,
than that which
you haue so plentiful∣ly
receiued from him

that gaue strength vn∣to
Dauid, and wisdome
vnto Salomon his son,
together with the
sweet fructifying seed
which hath beene so
diuinely sowne in your
Princely breasts by the
wisdome of our se∣cond
Salomon, your
most pious and most
truly religious Father.
Humbly beseeching
your Highnes to con∣ceiue

no other intenti∣on
in me, than an vn∣willingnesse
to let slip
the Interim of my se∣questred
imploiments
in your Highnesse ser∣uice
(much against my
will) without some ex∣ercise
inwardly com∣fortable,
though out∣wardly
little profita∣ble;
yet if any thing
vsefull (though but to
the vulgar) it may pray

your Princely fauour
being done, your
Highnesse seruice de∣pending;
beseeching
the length of daies to
lengthen your daies to
his glory, your honor,
and comfort of such
as feare God.
