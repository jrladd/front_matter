WHereas there was neuer anye thinge hearde of in any age past hetherunto, so perfectly wrought and framed, eyther by Arte or Nature, but that it hath at some time, for some forged and surmi∣sed matter, sustayned the repre∣hension of some enuious persons or other: I doe not much meruayle most mighty Pryn∣cesse, that in this your so noble & famous a gouernmēt, (the glory whereof is now longe sithence attered and spread ouer the whole face of the Earth,) there are not∣withstanding certayne euill disposed people, so blinded with malice, and subdued to their owne parciall con∣ceiptes: that as yet they can neyther spare indifferent iudgements to conceyue, or reuerent tongues to reporte a known truth, touching the perfection of the same. But for these men, as they are (no doubt) sufficiently refuted by the testimonies of their owne cosciences: so are they most certaynly condemned by the common consent of all such, as are wise or indifferent. And although this be of it selfe so cleare and manyfest that it cannot be deni∣ed, yet could not I forbeare (most renowmed soueraigne) being as it were inforced, by your Maesties late & sin∣gular clemency, in pardoning certayne my vnduetifull misdemeanour, but seeke to acknowledge your gracious goodnesse and bounty towards me, by exhibiting vnto you this small and simple present: wherein as I haue in∣deued

in fewe wordes to aunswere certayne quarrels and obiections, dayly and ordinarily occurrent in the  of sundry men, so doe I most humbly craue your Graces fauourable acceptation thereof: protestinge also with all humility, that my meaninge is not in the dis∣course of these matters heere disputed, to define ought, which may in any wise sounde preiudiciall to any pub∣licke , but only to alleadge such probability as  coulde, to stop the mouthes of certayne euill affected , which of their curiosity require farther satis∣faction in these matters, then can well stand with good modesty.  as vpon this zeale & good meaning towards your , I was earnestly moued to vndertake , and in the handling thereof rather con∣tent to shewe my selfe vnskilfull to others, thē vnthāk∣full to you: so  of your auncient accustomed clemency, I was so bould to  the same to your gra∣cious protection, fully  and assuring my self, that it would generally obtayne the better credit & en∣tertainment among others, if your  name were prefixed, as it were a most rich Iewell and rare Ornamēt to beautifie and commend the same. God preserue your Maiesty with insinit increase of all his blessings bestow∣ed vpon you, and  that your dayes of life here vp∣on the earth may be extended (if it be his good will)  far beyond the ordinary course of Nature: that as you haue already sufficiētly raygned for your owne honour and glory to last withall posterities: so you may cōtinew and remayne with vs many more yeares, euen to the ful contentation (if it may so be) of vs your louing subiects, and to the perfect establishing of this florishing peace &  anquillity in your cōmon weale sor euer.
