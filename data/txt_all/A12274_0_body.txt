VRania hauing brought mee (Right Noble) to the sight of your most admirable Art, I could not choose but say, none could doe so great a worke, but the maker of all things. And seeing it framed of so many excel∣lent peeces, to say; none but the Diuine pro∣uidence can vphold it: Whereupon I endea∣uoured to inable my selfe in some knowledge thereof; and (though poore) I Purchased some bookes, and in diuers yeares bestowed much mony; imploying my  houres that I could
 spare in this studie and practise. And in the meane time, much sicknesse, and death of my friends, bringing mee vnder intollerable bondage , made me come neerer this Honourable City; but with the losse of almost my whole estate: and in the way had both my Bookes and goods, all lost and spoyled in the Thames water. Neuerthe∣lesse (although almost vtterly vnabled and n∣learned) I haue not ceased to do good if pos∣sible I might (knowing that no man is borne for himselfe.) Therefore I set forth in a bill at my dore, to Teach the Art of Nauigation, to the poorer sort gratis: And not so content I haue here framed a good order there of (as I think) to send abroad to those that cannot come to me. May it please you therefore vnder your fa∣uourable  direction, to admit it your presence once onely: to aske you leaue, and to giue you account what I doe among your seruants as is most meete. And for your fauourable entertainement of it, your  re∣spect to me for my good will, and your kinde acceptance, I rest,
