IT maie please your goodnesse (honorable Lorde) to receiue in good parte, the ttie labour of my pen, whiche, albe it the rudenes & quantite ther∣of, procureth not to be dedicate to so honourable a personage, yet the matter it self is of soche worthines, as duely deserueth to be graeuen in golde, but who goeth about so finely to depict with Appelles instrumēte this

saied Regester, thinkyng to ex∣cede the rest, not I poor wretch bicause I am assured, that soch a worthie woorke, as thereof maie bee written, can not, nei∣ther shall passe vntouched, e∣mong so many godlie learned, but were it, that no man here∣after shuld in more ample and learned maner set foorthe the same, yet should my presump∣tion (if I so mente) bee tourned to reproche, for this I beleue, that thei be in soche sorte rege∣stred in the booke of the liuing, as passeth either pen, ynke, or memorie to declare. This my simplicitie, and to bolde attēpt might moue your honor to cō∣iecture in me moche rudenesse, or at the least might perswade me so to thinke, but that expe∣rience

hath shewed me, the hu∣militie, and gentlenes, of your long tried pacience, the certain knowledge whereof, hath pric∣ked me forwarde, in this my pretence: and beyng thereto re∣quested of a faithfull brother & frend, I haue with more indu∣strie then learnyng (God kno∣weth) finished thesame, which beyng (as I thought) brought to good ende, I desired accor∣ding to the accustomed maner, to dedicate thesame, vnto soche one, as would not contēpne, so simple a gift. And callyng you to mind (right honorable lord) I knewe none more mete, first bicause youre knowledge in Christe, teacheth you thesame godlie, & vertuous life, whiche not onely your lordship, but al

other honorable. &c. oughte to ensue. Secondly, bicause these late yeres you haue had good experiēce, of the troubles, and miseries of the faithful, which haue pacientlye embrased in their armes, the comfortable (although painefull) crosse of Christ, which in so great a nū∣bre is commonlye not so plen∣teous, as commendable, but what stand I praisyng this pa cience in them (whiche yet de∣serueth the same) seing y• migh tie god & his christ, hath prepa∣red frō euerlastyng, for soche a glorious, rich, & incomprehen∣sible croune of felicitie, & conti∣nual cōfortes. This my short & simple worke, I commēde and dedicate, vnto youre Lorde∣ship, crauynge pardon at your

handes, for this my to homely and rude enterprise, cōsidering that albeit golden frute ware offered in Peuter, and by the handes of a simple man, yet is the frute notwithstandyng stil precious, and neither abased by the Peuter or giuer, euen so (honorable Lorde) though the verses be simple, and the giuer vnworthy, yet the frute or mat ter, is precious, comfortable, and good: The order to attaine to the perfecte vnderstandyng of my mynde, in settyng forthe thesame, with figures and let∣ters, shal largely appere in this booke, whiche I haue not one∣ly dooen, to make plaine vnto your honour, the yere, moneth and daie, but also to all other, that hereafter shall read it, for

that I doe pretend (if God and fauour will permit it) to vse the same as comō to the profit of al for which cause I haue al so, placed a preface to ye reader: But that it maye please youre honor (in respecte of the premi∣ses) to extende youre fauoura∣ble assistaunce, to the manifest setting forth of thys short and simple woorke, to the glorye of the great and myghtie God, to the comfort of christians, I as vnworthye and to bolde a su∣ter most humbly craueth your Lordshyps ayde and supporta∣tion in the same, especiallye to beare the rudenesse of my vn∣learned style (which alas I la∣ment). But nowe ceassyng to trouble your Lordshyppe anye longer, this shall bee my conti∣nuall

praier for you. The wise∣dome of GOD, direct your ho∣nour, the mercie of God, giue you spirituall power, the holie ghost guide and comforte you with all fulnes of consolation in Christe Iesus.
Amē.
