NO liquid Oyle proceedes fro a Pumice-stone,
Nor Alchimist produce an Oyle from thence:
Tis hard indeed if thou wert such a one,
As lou'd a Scholler onely for his Pence.
But since th'enclosing of Endymion,
He found some Oyle from Secondarie STONE.


Counsell they say is no commaundement,
That's false if counsell be but equitie:
Whereto a man must be obedient,
If he aspire vnto faelicitie.
No wrong had seazed olde Endymion,
If he had taken counsell of a Stone.


Things past, and things to come be different,
For they are gone, and these are in expect.
Thinke not on former dayes maleuoent,
The fates to come worke contrarie effect.
And cause thee blesse the day, the place, the houre,
That thou receyued'st Endymions Pramour.


Ourania sings obscure Philosophie,
Like Bats, and Owles in silent dark some night,
In Olderne times she chanted melodie,
Of higher straine: And when she comes to light,
Shee'l sing thee such a blessed Madrigall,
As th shal thinke the lay Caiall.


FINIS.
