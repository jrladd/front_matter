Honoured Sir,
I Had no long Debate within my self, whose Name I should borrow to Patronize this Discourse, when I con∣sidered it had been delivered in Two Great and Judicious Au∣ditories, one of the Honourable Inns of Courts, and the most Ancient and Learned
University of the Nation: My Thoughts presently fastned upon Colonel
Goulston (a Per∣son who hath suckt much Excellent Learning from the Breasts of both Universities, and been refined and polish∣ed by an Inns of Court Education) as the best qualified to do me such an Honour: And though it seems little less than a Libelling your Judgment, to publish my Hopes of its own∣ing so Mean and Sorry a Pamphlet; yet I have presumed to give you the Trouble of this Address, not from any Opinion I have of the Value of what I present to you; but because
the Honour, and Happiness, of some years Neighbourhood, and Conversation, have given me a more than ordinary As∣surance, that your Candor and Charity will be ready to Pardon the Faults, and Umbrage the many Imperfections of it.
Were I inclin'd to put off the Divine, and put on the Courtier, I could (as some have done in
Addresses of this Nature) cross the Seas, and Rifle Foreign Countries, for
DIAMONDS & RVBIES, to SET in, and enrich your Name, and Exalt and Imbellish your Virtues with High and strained Hyperboles: But my own plain and honest Temper hath made me a faithful Friend to Truth, and an inveterate Enemy to Paint and Varnish; nor do I here so much pretend to draw a curious Picture of your Virtues, as to give you a rude Draught of my grateful Resentments of those many Neighbourly Kindnesses you have heaped upon,
Honoured Sir, 
Ansty,
Novemb. 29. 1682.
