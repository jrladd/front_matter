WHat the sin against the holy Ghost is in Divinity, the same Ingratitude is in Morality; an offence unpardonable. It argues a base Disposition in those who are glad to receive what others give, but loath to confesse what they Receive.
I must acknowledge my engagement unto you to bee great, Is not Exeter a little one, and my soul shall live? where I safely anchored in these tempestuous times: It is a high advancement in this troublesome Age, for one with a quiet conscience to be Preferred to Life and Li∣berty: It fared better with me; for whilst her Infant Highnesse, (on whose Soule and Body God crowd all bles∣sings Spirituall and Temporall, till there shall be no roome to receive more) though unable to feed her selfe, fed me, and many more of her servants: other accommodations were bestowed upon me by your liberality.

 In expression of my gratitude, I present this Sermon unto you, hoping it shall receive the same entertainement from your eyes, as it formerly found from your eares, and still be read with as much favour, as it was once heard with attention. And then, this widowes mite of mine will be made a tallent by your courteous acceptance there∣of.
May the sbield of Divine providence, which onely is of proofe against the fiery arrowes of his shooting, defend you from the noysome pestilence, and encompasse you with a wall of Help and Deliverance: yea, may God him∣selfe stand watchman at the Gates of your City, to forbid the entrance of any thing that may be prejudiciall unto you, And give full and free admittance to whatsoever may tend to the advancement of your happinesse here and hereafter. So resteth
