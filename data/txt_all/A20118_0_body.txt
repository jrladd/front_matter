YOu that the gentle craft profess, list to my words both more & lesse
And I shall tel you many things, of worthy and renowned Kings▪
And diuers Lords and knights also that were shoomakers long agoe,
Some of them in their distresse, delighted in this businesse.
And some, for whō great wait was laid, did saue their liues by this same trade,
Other some, in sport and game, delighted much to learne the same,
No other Trade in all the Land they thought so fit vnto their hand;
For euermore they stil did find, that shoomakers bore a gallant mind,
Men they were of high conceit, the which wrought many a merry feat
Stout of courage were they still, and in their weapons had great skil,
Trauellers by sea and land, each country guise to vnderstand.
Wrong they wrought not any man, with reason al things did they sca.
Good houses kept they euermore, releeuing both the sicke and poore.
In law no mony would they spēd, their quarels friendly wold they end
No malice did they beare to any, but shew'd great fauour vnto many;
Offences soone they would forgiue, they would not in contention liue
Thus in ioy they spent their daies, with pleasant songs and roundelaies
And God did blesse them with content; sufficient for them he sent,
And neuer yet did any know, a shoomaker a begging goe:
Kind are they one to another, vsing each stranger as his brother.
Thus liu'd shoomakers of old, as ancient writers haue it told:
And thus shoomakers still would be, so fame from them shall neuer flee▪
