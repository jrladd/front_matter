KInde Sir, I haue seene oftentimes men offering to snuffe a
candle, haue against their wills put it cleane out; and an
vnskilfull Chyrurgian taking a small greene wound in
hand, hath brought it to an old Vlcer. I would be loth,
for my part, to imitate either of these examples; for my
intent is, confession of the wrong I did you, and an en∣deauour
to make amends. I doe confesse that I did you
wrong in print, in my booke of my Trauels to Scotland, and now in
print, I doe make you a publike satisfaction; For, I protest to God, that

I haue heard so much good report of you, that I am double sorry that I was so
mistaken, and that I haue beene so long time before I haue printed my recan∣tion.
It was your Tapsters want of wit and manners, and my want of discre∣tion,
that was the grounds of my too much credulity and temerity. For his part
I wish him no more harme, but that chalke may bee his best payments, Thun∣der
may sowre his Hogsheads, Rats gnaw out his spigots at midnight, and him∣selfe
to commit his wit to the keeping of a foole or a knaue while hee liues;
And your Ostlers, for gaping so greedily like Gudgeons vpon mee, I pray that
they may euery day mourne in litter and horse dung. But these are but Iests by
the way: for as many as know you, haue told mee, that if you had beene at
home, my entertainement had beene better. If it had beene so, it had beene
more then you owed me, and more then I at that time could haue required: but
I would haue stretched my wit vpon the tenters of Inuention, in the prayse of
Innes and Inne-keepers, I would haue put the forgetfull world in minde of the
good seruice that Rahab the Innekeeper did at Iericho, in hiding and preseruing
the spyes that were sent by Caleb and Ioshua; I would haue made the obliuious
logger-headed Age remember, that the Redeemor of the world did grace in
Inne with his blessed birth: What place then but an Inne was the High Court
of Heauen and earth, the residence and lodging of the immortall King, of neuer∣ending
eternity? This and more I would haue done, but what is past cannot bee
recalled, and it is too late to put old omittings to new committings. And so, my
noble and thrice worthy Oast of Oasts, I omit not to commit you and yours to
the protection of him that made you, desiring you to take this merry Pamphlet
in good part, or in earnest of my better amends, and as a qualifier of your iust
anger.
