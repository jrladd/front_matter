May it please your Highnesse,
THe Nation of Wales, being described to the former Parliament to be overspread with Ignorance and Prophanenes. Was by the Members thereof, Taken into consideration, And passed an Act for the better Propagation, and Preaching of the Gospell in Wales; For the putting whereof in execution divers Commission∣ers were Authorized, and impowered to Amove and Eject those of the Ministery, whom they conceived to be unworthy: And persons were Nominated to Recommend, and approve, such men, as they should judge fit for the advancement of the Gospell in those Coun∣tries. The Commissioners according to their Authority, proceeded in the work; So that in a short space, the Ancient Clergy were (for the most part) indiscriminally ejected, The Tithes Sequestred, The Parishes left unsupplied, The blessed Ordinance of Christ taken a∣way from the Inhabitants, And they wholy debarred from any spi∣rituall comfort to their pretious Soules, by any Power or dispensa∣tion of Gospell-Ministery, but what they must receive from some few Itinerants in their uncertaine meetings. This (out of a Soule-saving necessity) stirred up the spirits of many of the conscientious Inhabi∣tants to present that pious Petition of South-wales to the Honou∣rable House. But the Petitioners their Councell, and Sollicitors have been prejudiced in their Reputation, for discharging their duty therein to God, and their native Country, and rendred thereby un∣capable of serving the same; And have been traduced to have fay∣led to prove, and make good the Matters exhibited in the Petiti∣on; Which constraines mee to publish this Narrative of the whole Transaction and Proceedings of the Parliament, with their Resolves in Referring the same to the Committee for Plun∣dred Ministers; As also to make truly evident unto publick view the Petitioners particular charge, the Commionssiers Answer, with the Petitioners Reply thereunto, as they were lodged with the Clerk for the Committee, according to their severall Originall Copies, Or∣ders

and Reports, Protesting, that I have not the least thought out of malice, or selfe-ends to asperse or calumniate any mans Person; But only to set down matters of fact for the manifestation of Truth, to vindicate the Petitioners, their Councell, and Sollicitors from all malignant designe in promoting the Petition, Either to discourage the godly, or to bring into Authority any Malignant or ill-affected persons, Or re-investing unworthy, and scandalous Ministers.
All which I have made bold in the fear of God, and power of his Grace, to spread most humbly before your Highness. That seeing the Promises of good things do already shine both in Church and State by your Highness his Protection and Government; Why should the poor Inhabitanes of Wales despaire to make known their grievances, and Represent their sad spirituall Condition before your Christian-Eys, who (perhaps) have not had as yet a full discovery thereof? Who knowes, But that the Lord (who had hid these things from such as were formerly in Authority) Hath reserved the same for your Highnesse Care, That the People may have Cause to praise and blesse God for you, whom he hath designed to Performe so glorious a Worke, as to Restore the Comfort of the Blessed Ordinances of Christs Gospell unto their Nation againe.
You are now become not onely Petra, a Foundation, whereon the People must rest:
In vos domus omnis Inclinata Recumbit.
but also Pastor Israelis, a Sheepheard to provide Pastures for the People, The Lord in his Mercy direct you to Act what is con∣ducible to his Glory, the peace of your owne Conscience, and the good and well-fare of the People under your Protection, prayeth,

March. 23. 1653.
