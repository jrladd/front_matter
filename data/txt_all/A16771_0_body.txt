LVstie Humfrey, honest wagge, hea∣ring, of late, of your determination, to enter into the honourable course of kindnesse (which, after many mad Roundes, will be the best daunce to continue with) hopeing that you are olde enough to knowe what is good for your selfe, and yet not so wilful in conceipt, but you will take aduisement of your good friends; for the better instruction of your iudgement in this loues lawe-case, I haue thought good to set you downe such notes wor∣thy memory, as may giue you great light, in the best way to your comfort: where, finding the true description of the worthy, and vnworthy woman, you may, by gods helpe, make a choyce worth the chusing. Pasquill sent them to me, and I to you;

hoping, that if they be not as they should be, you will blame him, and not me. So, wishing thine honest heart as good fortune as my selfe, and as much better as shall please God; if you light well, to be glad, but not proude of it; if other∣wise, to be as patient as your poore friendes (hoping, that you wil finde a iewell worth the kee∣ping, and drosse but worth the discarding) I cō∣mit my booke to your kinde reading, & my loue to your like keeping: and so rest
