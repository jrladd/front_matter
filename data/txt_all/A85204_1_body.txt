SIR,
NExt after my religion to God I have always esteemed my Allegiance towards my So∣veraign, as the Apple of mine own eye, in testimony whereof I present this Panegyrick (preached at our gracious Soveraign his return to his Kingdoms) to those eyes which were wit∣nesses how far I adventured in the cause of his Majesties Father, even when the Ignominious tree was fixed, and Royal the grave was ready for me.
Accept I beseech you of this handful of Goats-hair, which is as cordially dedicated to the Altar of Loyalty as any others gold, silver, blew, silk or purple what∣soever.
SIR,
