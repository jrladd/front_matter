THe Ancients considering in man the facul∣ties
ordained to good, distinguisht them in two.
The one of well-doing, and the other, of well-speaking.
The Moderns have esteemed the latter lesse
considerable and more dangerous.
As for me, I shall not undertake to judge, as if they had
done amisse.
But for as much as I looke upon the one, ordained to the ac∣quiring
of the other, and that I highly esteeme the faculty
of Wel-Speaking; not to make a vaine ostentation of its Art,
but as an Instrument and meanes to provide in Man the
desire of Well-doing, and to teach him the way to accomplish

the good which he hath propounded to himselfe.
I have freely addicted my mind to teach in this your Acade∣my,
the Art of Well-Speaking, to this end only, in testimony
whereof, and for a full justification of my sincere intentions
I do humbly present you with the first Lecture in the which
I do but declare, that rich quality wihch is in Well-Speaking,
to wit; to be the Image and principall sensible argument of
what is in us, a Rationall, Intelectuall, and Inmateriall
Soule, which is all one as to say Immortall, As for the
Rules and Documents which shall be taught hereafter in your
Academy to the Lovers of Wel-Speaking, to incite them to
doe well, It shall bee in imitation of those who having little
pocket Watches subject to faile in their Motions, and to bee
out of course, are repaired and set in order againa; by the
Sunne which cannot faile in his splendor, nor his Motion.
You are this day (Most Honourables) the light of the
State, you are the Movers of the great Body of the Com∣mon
wealth, You are (I say, the Publicke Voyce, and Your
Voice is as the Voyce of God.
And therefore those Orders which I intend to give to
such who desire to learne to speake well, shall all waite the Di∣ctates
of Your Votes and Commands. Else I should ra∣ther
chuse, to teach, and to learne Silence: continuing stil.
