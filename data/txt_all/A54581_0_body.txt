MY LORD,
AS the Historian hath told us of Ireland, that long ago while the Arts and Sciences were ge∣nerally banish'd from the Christian World they were enthroned in Ireland, and that Men were sent thither from other Parts of Chri∣stendom to be improved in Learning; so I have elsewhere observ'd that in some late Conjunctures (and particularly during the turbid Interval of the Exclusion) men might well be sent to Scotland to learn Loyalty.
And I having taken occasion in the first Part of this Dis∣course to shew my self a just honourer of that Country, and (as I may say) somewhat like a Benefactor to it by sending thither the notices of some pass'd great Transactions that might possibly there give more light and life to the Moral Offices of Natural Allegiance or Obedience, did hold my self obliged in Common Justice to address this Part of my Work to your Lordship. For as your Station here quali∣fies you beyond other Subjects to receive what Tribute is offer'd to your Country, so your handing it thither will ne∣cessarily make it there the more acceptable.
And when I consider with what an incomparable Tender∣ness for the Monarchy and its Rights so many of the Sta∣tutes of Scotland since the Year 1660. have been adorn'd, I am apt to think that any matter of Presidents or Records by me recover'd out of the Sea of time where they lay so long useless and neglected, and now happening to be serviceable

to those Moral Offices before-mention'd, would by the so many in that Kingdom devoted to consummate Obedience and Loyalty, be more valued then if I could have imported into that Realm another such Treasure as that which lay so long buried in the Ocean near the Bahama Islands, and that whoever Contributed to your Loyal Country any Substan∣tial Notions that might enrich it in the discharge of the Duties of the born and sworn Allegiance, would be esteem'd there as some way sharing in the honour of Arauna, in giving like a King to a King.
Long may your great Master live happy in the Enjoy∣ment of the faithful Services of so vigilant a Minister as your Lordship, who by the universality of your Knowledge ac∣company'd with universal Charity for all Mankind, have appear'd to be born, as I may say, for the time of his most glorious Reign, the time chosen by Heaven for Mercies Triumph on Earth.
Nothing vulgar was to be expected from a Person of your Lordship's extraordinary intellectual and moral Endowments, and in whom the Loyalty and other Virtues of your many noble Ancestors have (as it were) lived extraduce. And the World would be unjust to you if it acknowledged not its great Expectation answer'd by your greater Performances, and particularly by your having been so eminently Ministe∣rial in the Easing both the Cares of your Prince, and of all his Subjects too by the Figure you have made in promoting the Ease of his People's Consciences, and in further enno∣bling and endearing the Name of DRUMMOND by your Lordship's Prosecuting that by the Bravery of Action, which the HISTORIAN of that your Name did by Words, when he transmitted to Posterity the most Christian and Statesman∣like Speech of Liberty of Conscience, I know extant, and as spoke by a Roman-Catholick Councellor in Scotland to King Iames the Fifth.
I most humbly kiss your Lordship's Hands, and am,
My Lord,
