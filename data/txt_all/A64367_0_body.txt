Right Honourable,
IN obedience to Your commands, I have made this Discourse Publick; and I humbly offer it to Your fa∣vourable acceptance. There is need of such candour in reference to the manner of handling this Argument; it being so dif∣ficult

to speak discreetly of Discretion, and with perfect Charity, of the lavish Abu∣sers of it. But, touching the Argument it self, I forbėar to use any Apologie; it being (as I think) agreeable enough to the design of a Spittle-Sermon.
There is another branch of Charity which equally needeth Prudence, and is as necessary to be consider'd, though, at that time and place, it was not a subject so proper for me. I mean, that Discreet Charity which moderates our Censures. It is too common a practice to leap from bare Report to uncharitable Opinion and unchristian Language; without staying at all in the mid-way, to examine the grounds of ordinary Fame. And so, by publick Clamour, and by private Discon∣tent, as by Winds aloft and Earthquakes beneath, the frame of Civil Polity is dis∣ordered. And it may be taken up a∣gainst us, as a Proverb of Reproach,

That England is a Creature which, if it finds no other way of dying, will kill it self with jealousie and fretfulness. We make others our Enemies, by thinking them to be so, and by giving scandalous Characters of them, before we truly un∣derstand their merits. And I hearti∣ly thank God, that I have found, in Con∣versation, so much of good temper and real Piety in many Men, upon whom rashness had fixed names of Infamy. God grant that we may, on all hands, avoid Extreams; and, by the voice of univer∣sal Charity, call back that Blessed Peace which hath seemed to be flying from us. No man can desire this with greater de∣grees of affection and sincerity, than,
Right Honourable,
