AS that famous Zeuxis, another Apelles, intending to limme in her naturall colours the picture of Iuno, selected fiue of the most beautifull Virgins that were in all Agrigent, that from the comely feature of those, in each part, he might portray a compleate and most ami∣able picture: so in like manner (right Honourable) I purposing to set Dame Nature vpon the Stage of the world, in each limme well fashioned, out of Matter and Forme, haue taken her linea∣ments from the Art and wisedome of the more learned sort of Philosophers, that in all her parts (so well as I could) she might stand faire and well composed to the common view, of such espe∣cially as can discerne and iudge, a property not common to all. For euery plummet is not for euery sound, nor euery line for all leauels; neither is it possible out of euery blocke to make the sculpture of Mercurie, no more then it is possible for euery one without a conuenient Bucket, to draw water from the depth of Iacobs Well.
But your Lordship being in all humane Science profoundly learned, and of mature Iudgement (as hath appeared by effect) can with Protogenes, discipher Apelles worke, by the draught of one onely line, and can by your sublimed wisedome discerne the misterie of Matter and Forme.
And to the end your Honour may the better feele my mea∣ning
herein, I haue reduced (as it were) innumerable beames to one Sunne, and many Riuers to one Fountaine, abridging large discourses into a conuenient compendium and methode.
But seeing no Pomegranat can be so faire, but that some one imperfect and rotten kernell may be found therein, I humbly be∣seech your Honour to deale with such occurent faults, as Lapi∣daries are wont to deale with precious stones, who to hide a cracke or flaw, doe set the same more deepe in gold. So (my right Ho∣nourable Lord) let your Noble name and High reputation of learning and sage prudence, shaddow and adorne my imperfecti∣ons in this Treatise. Wherein, albeit you finde not an Eagles nest, no more then Theseus did (notwithstanding through faire promises he had long looked for it) yet happily your Honour, at the least shall finde a Wrenne, and then at the last you may say you haue a Bird.
Now fearing least I paesse the due limits of proportion, as did the Myndians, who made their gates greater then their Towne, I cease to stay your Lordship from your Honourable affaires, crauing pardon for this my boldnesse, and beseeching God to in∣crease your dayes and yeeres with desired health, to your ioy and comfort, and to the good of this Church and Common-wealth of great Britaine.
