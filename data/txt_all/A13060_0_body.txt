SEe (gratious Liege) from Sabrines farthest shore,
(The semicircling bound of that dominion,
Where hardy Britaines your great name adore)
A Shepherd lowly in his owne opinion,
Bold on your Grace, presents you with a Song,
Whose subiect rightly doth to you belong.


A Theame diuine, though simple be the Singer:
A feast of dainties, in a woodden platter:
As you esteeme the Cates, accept the Bringer:
Deeme of the Person, as you like the matter.
The Swaine could not find out a fitter thing,
To shew his faith, and zeale vnto his King.



'Twas in the Presse, liuing your Royall Sirē,
Saluting you with Title of The Prince:
But sith the King of Kings hath rays'd you higher,
The Frontispice is onely altred since.
The Booke each-where its former style obserues,
And humbly begs your pardon where it swerues.


Vouchsafe it shelter vnder Your protection.
It guides the Reader to eternall rest,
Directs Inferiors to their due subjection,
Stor'd with instructions vsefull for the best.
May Kings and Princes from your loynes descen∣ding:
Reade it with comfort to the worlds ending.
