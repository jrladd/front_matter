E ETernall happinesse,
Hearts true content,
L Long life in peace,
and plenty permanent;
I Internall and externall
be her graces,
S Such as to which
Heauens Angels daigne imbraces.
A Amids her fos,
Iehouah be her shield;
B By Sea and Land,
in trenches and in field:
E Engrau'd b'Elizaes
Image in her brest;
T That Queens that farre
in fame surmounts the best;
H Here then shall highest
honour crowne her crest.

Q Quiuers of Dauids arrowes
may she haue;
V Vpon her head
Heauens helmet, her to saue.
EE Earth, Aire and Seas,
all Elements and Winde,
N Nourish her happinesse,
the Heau'ns her minde.
E Estraited neuer
let her foes her finde.
O Order her actions all,
Iehouah, right:
F Fix in her heart
the Target of thy might.
B Breake thou the rankes
and Armies of her foes,
O O draw thy sword,
fight for her where she goes;
H Hem her about
with Angels of thy might,
E Embrace her, loue her,
soone restore her right.
M Make great thy name
in marching on her side:
I Inthrall her foes,
and snare them in their pride.
A Assist her still,
and still be thou her guide;
