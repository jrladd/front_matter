AS it is a high Degree of His Majesties trust and confidence in your Excel∣lencies
great abilities, to settle and establish You his Vice-Roy Chief Governour in this his King∣dom of Ireland; so it is received as an act of Grace and Kindness to∣wards all loyal and good subjects in this Land, to be under the Umbrage and Protection of your Virtues and Gra∣ces, which since your Excellencies Ar∣rival, have much refreshed and com∣forted many drooping hearts, and raised them to future hopeful expecta∣tions: and as to discontents (if any) such is your Piety, Wisedom, and Justice, that they all are calmed and allayed, or so quieted, that they ap∣pear not at all. And it is a happy Juncture, when the Church, the
State, the Army, make no complaints or clamours, but, as the members of the Body to the Head, yield obedi∣ence to their Chief Governour. As this may be the ground and founda∣tion of the universal Peace and Tran∣quillity of this Kingdom at present, and great satisfaction to all, though of different perswasion; so doubt∣less it will improve and unite all His MAJESTIES Subjects to more perfect and exact obedience, which hath likewise bound me to observan∣cy, and (on this accompt) to pub∣lish and make legible, what was for a short time onely in your Excellencies, and the Christian Auditors ears. And no censure is to be feared, where
your Excellency will please to Com∣mand or Patronize,
My Lord,
