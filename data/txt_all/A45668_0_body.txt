My Lords,
IT is a saying in the Na∣vy, He that knows not how to obey Command, is not worthy to bear Com∣mand; and another saying

I have often heard in the Navy. It is hard for an Offi∣cer to know when he goes too fast or too slow, that is, whether he is too se∣vere in the Execution of his Duty, or too dull or slow; in which Cases, it is somtimes difficult to please our Superiours, be∣cause of their different Hu∣mours: As it is the Duty of a Subject to be True and Loyal to his Prince, so it is the Duty of Servants, to be Faithful, Humble, and Submissive to their Ma∣sters. I thought it my Du∣ty,

my Lords, Humbly to present you with this small Treatise, not only as a Ser∣vant, but that whereas some part of it may happen to fall under your Con∣struction, more particular∣ly the Chapter concerning Magnetick Variation, which I Humbly Commend to your Joynt Care and Con∣sideration, for the Improve∣ment and Encouragement of Navigation, and Amend∣ment of Faults in the Na∣vy, if I may presume to say there is any Faults there; an Elegant Stile cannot

Reasonably be expected from Sea breeding: I am not willing to seem tedious, if in my Discourse in this Book, you find some small Faults; I hope your Wis∣dom will be pleased to Pardon, and Excuse them.
