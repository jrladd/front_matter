MAY IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE.
The noble Character which you do now so worthily bear, together with the more last∣ing

and inward Characters of Your Princely mind, did set me beyond doubting to whom this Address was to be made: For to whom is a vindication of the Authority and Laws of this Kingdom so due, as to Your Grace, to whom His Majesty hath by a Royal De∣legation, committed the administration of Affairs among us; and under whose wise and happy conduct, we have enjoyed so long a tract of uninterrupted tranquillity? But it is not only Your illustrious quality that en∣titles You to this Dedication. No, Great Prince, greater in Your mind, than by Your fortune; there is somewhat more inward to You, than the gifts of fortune; which, as it proues her not blind in this instance, so commands all the respect can be payed Your Grace, by such who are honoured with so much knowledg of You, as hath fallen to the happy share of Your poorest servant.
But, My Lord, since all I can say either of the vast endowments of Your Mind, or of the particular engagements I lie under to honour You, must needs fall short of my

sense of both; and what is just to be said, is not fit for me to express; the least ap∣pearances of flattery being as unpleasant to You, as unbecoming one of my Station: I must quit this Theme, which is too great for me to manage; and only add, that I know Your understanding, in such debates as are here managed, to be so profound, and your judgment so well balanced, that as You deservedly pass for a Master in all learning; so, if these Sheets be so happy as to be well accounted of by You, I shall the less value or apprehend the snarlings of all Censurers. I pretend not by prefixing so great a Name to these Conferences, to be secure from Cen∣sure by Your Patrociny, since these Ene∣mies of all Order and Authority (with whom I deal) will rather be provoked from that, to lash me with the more severity.
I shall not to this add my poor thoughts of what this time and the tempers of those with whom we deal, seems to call for, since by so doing, I should become more ri∣diculous than Phormio was, when he enter∣tained

the redoubted Hannibal, with a pe∣dantick discourse of a Generals conduct. It is from Your Graces deep judgment and great experience, that we all expect and long for a happy settlement, wherein that success and blessings may attend Your endea∣vours, shall be prayed for more earnestly by none alive, than by,
May it please YOUR GRACE,
