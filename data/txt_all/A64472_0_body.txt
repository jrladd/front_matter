MY LORD,
NOt long since attending upon your High∣nsse and the sick bed of your Deare and Noble Mother (who hath lived to see you as high in the world as ever you were in her tender & careful thoughts) with a Heart and a Tongue full of duty and thankfulness; as for your first favours in my child∣hood, wherein I tasted deeply of your goodnesse, so for your last timely favour now in my Age, wherein I tast∣ed in part of your goodnesse and greatnesse together. And taking a solemne and submissive leave of your Highnesse, I entred into some serious consideration (be∣ing thereunto moved by your free, noble, and benevo∣lent expressions (which indeed my Lord did silently command me to speak again) how I might expresse to your Highnesse, and manifest to the world some appa∣rent testimony, as of my gratitude to you, (now sitting at the sterne) so of my improvement under you in the University: And therefore immediately after my de∣parture from you (in December last) my pains being de∣sired in Margarets Westm. and willingly and readily accepted, and as well approved as accepted by some worthy and judicious Auditors, I was seriously impor∣tuned
 and solicited for the Notes: Which opportunity, with some difficulty I waved, fearing if communicated they might steale to the Presse, and so being but mean and inconsiderable in themselves, unworthy of such ac∣count, being likewise imperfect and unperused, they might by the hasty printing of them be made worse: And being perswaded, that your Lordship might heare something of them, I am bold, most Noble Lord, ha∣ving viewed and digested them, ▪between hope & fear▪ Humillima cordis & corporis inclinatione, to dedicate them to your Highnesse, and to set them forth in your Lordships name.
2. It was by your Lordships means, or your much honoured Mothers, (my worthy and noble Friend and Lady) that I was ever made capable of any Church∣promotion, or entred into this sacred and holy Functi∣on, being sent by her & your most worthy Father▪ that well deserving and esteemed Patriot, long since with the Lord) to wait upon your Highnesse in Cambridge; where and at whose feet I did imbibe such principles, as have in a meane and moderate way inabled me to carry some of that light which shone gloriously there, and in some splendour in Sidney Sussex Colledge, where your Highnesse was a Fellow-Commoner and Student (under a godly, learned, and reverend Master) into the world. So that next to God, I owe my selfe, (and the best of my selfe, my Labours) unto you (my Lord) In∣genuum est fateri per qus prfecimus, and I am in very good hope your Highnesse▪ will please to taste of the fruit of that tree which was of your owne planting, (though the fruit be not so exquisite and pleasant as that which had a warmer and longer influence) and no suffer it to wither, or be pull'd up by the roots.

3. They were framed under your Highnesse prote∣ction, and therefore by another right they justly claime your tuition; and if there be any good at all in them, it is to be ascribed (next unto Him who is the Giver of every good and perfect gift) to your Highnesse good∣nesse, which procured me those quiet,▪ peaceable, and silent houres, in the which they were composed.
Such therefore as these rude Meditations are, I most humbly present and dedicate to your Highness, earnest∣ly beseeching you to credit them & me with your gra∣cious favour and benevolent aspect, under whose coun∣tenance they will certainly finde easie acceptance, and may doe some good abroad.
Thus with my fervent, frequent, and constant pray∣ers for your Highnesse, that you may doe as you doe, (and have promised to doe) make it your work to ho∣nour him who hath so highly advanced you, and abun∣dantly satisfie the expections of many thousands of people, especially ours of the Clergy, whose eyes are upon you for good, our calling being once honourable, (and so we hope by your meanes it may be againe) and we may live to see Trajan's dayes, in whose time they say a good man never wanted, nor a learned man beg'd: (For surely they will honour Learning, whose actions require and deserve a learned pen) though it be now a∣based and abused by many ignorants, faring herein like the Master of the calling, who in such eyes had neither forme nor beauty. It was a Jeroboam my Lord) you know that made Priests of the lowest of the people, (which makes him carry that infamous brand and train nineteene times after him in Scripture) Jeroboam the son of Nebat, &c. by committing and imposing the trust▪ of Gods sacred Oracles into such uncleane and unholy
 hands, and now the lowest of the people make them∣selves Priests; This brasse coyne, as Ignatius cals them, bearing their owne stampe and impression. And it is not unknowne to your Highnesse, that the despising of the Ephod was the rot of Sauls Kingdome: That Israel was without God, when it was without a Priest to teach: That faithfull Pastours and teachers are the guard, the safe-guard, the life-guard of a Church and State, con∣fessed so by a King, and enemy to Sion: That it was great Constantine's word to his Clergy, Adjuvate me precibus, ego vos gladio; Help me with your prayers, I will help you with my power. That pious and devout Lord in this Land and Common-wealth, accounted the prayers of faithful Ministers the walls of his house.
Let it be the shame, and indelible blot of the Romish Synagogue, the Malignant Church, to have Golden Chalices and Wooden Priests, Mendicant and begging Priests, or their Priests beggars. It is the honour and dignity of a Christian Magistracy & Common-wealth, when and where they that labour in the Word & Do∣ctrine, are accounted worthy of double honour, and have both countenance and maintenance, regard and reward. I most humbly kisse your hand, (for an Epi∣stle, as Seneca saith, should not fill the hand) craving pardon for my prolixity & presumption, which I hope, good my Lord, having had some early experience of your Highnesse candour and condescention you will easily grant, accounting it my great happinesse that ever I had any dependance upon you, and my honour and credit to have been, and to be,
(My Lord)
