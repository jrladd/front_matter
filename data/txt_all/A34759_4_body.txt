TO THE RIGHT WORâˆ£Shipfull Mr. WILLIAM BARNHAM, Major of the City of NORWICH; As also to Mr. Barnard Church, who with much Honour managed the chiefe Place of Magistracy in the said City, the last yeare, 
JOHN CARTER. Humbly presents this rare Sight,
AS a Testimony of his respect, love and thankfulnesse to them, for all their undeserved Favour, and faithfulnesse. As also because they have a just claim thereunto. Mr. Matthew Lyndsey, who deceased in the midst of

his Majoralty 1650. had the true right to it. The Sermon was preached at his request, and at his Inauguration. He dying, it descends by Inheritance upon these his Successors.
The Sight is very rare indeed, but very poorly, and meanly set forth; Such as it is, the unworthy Author humbly tenders to them, with apprecation of all Grace, Honour, and Happinesse.
