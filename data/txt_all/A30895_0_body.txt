AS the condition of Kings and Princes, puts them in a station, more obvious to the view and observation of the World, than that of other men, of whom, as Cicero observes, neither any word, or action can be obscure; so are those Kings (during whose appearance upon the stage of this World, it pleaseth the Great KING of Kings sin∣gularly to make known unto men the wonderful steps of his unsearchable Providence) more signally observed, and their lives and actions more diligently remarked, and inquired into by posterity, especially if those things be such, as not only re∣late to the outward transactions of this World, but also are signalized by the manifestation or revelation of the know∣ledg

of God in matters Spiritual and Religious. These are the things that rendred the lives of Cyrus, Augustus Caesar, and Constantine the Great, in former times, and of CHARLES the Fifth, and some other modern Princes in these last Ages so considerable.
But among all these transactions, which it hath pleased God to permit, for the Glory of His Power, and the manifestation of His Wisdom and Providence, no Age furnisheth us with things so strange and marvellous, whether with respect to mat∣ters Civil or Religious, as these, that have faln out within the compass of thy time, who, though thou be not yet arrived at the Fiftieth year of thy age, hast yet been a witness of stranger things, than many Ages before produced; so that, whether we respect those various troubles, wherein thou foundst thy self engaged, while scarce got out of thy Infancy, the many different afflictions, wherewith men of thy circumstances are often unacquainted, the strange and unparallel'd fortune that befel thy Father, thy own narrow escape, and banishment following thereupon, with the great improbability of thy ever returning (at lest without very much pains and tedious com∣batings) or finally the incapacity thou wert under to accom∣plish such a design, considering the strength of those that had possessed themselves of thy Throne, and the terror they had inflicted upon Foreign States: and yet that, after all this, thou shouldst be restored without stroke of Sword, the help or assistance of Foreign States, or the contrivance and work of human policy. All these do sufficiently declare, that it is the Lord's doing, which, as it is marvellous in our eyes, so it will justly be a matter of wonder and astonishment to generations to come: and may sufficiently serve, if rightly observed, to confute and confound that Atheism, wherewith this Age doth so much abound.
As the vindication of the Liberty of Conscience (which thy Father, by giving way to the important clamours of the Clergy, the answering and fulfilling of whose unrighteous wills has of∣ten proved hurtful and pernicious to Princes, sought, in some

part, to restrain) was a great occasion of these troubles and revolutions: so the pretence of Conscience was that which carried it on, and brought it to that pitch it came to, and, though (no doubt) some, that were engaged in that work, designed good things, at lest in the beginning, (albeit alwaies wrong in the manner they took to accomplish it, viz. by car∣nal weapons) yet so soon as they had tasted of the sweet of the possessions of them, they had turned out, they quickly be∣gan to do those things themselves, for which they had accused others: for their hands were found full of oppression, and they hated the reproofs of instruction, which is the way of life. And they evilly entreated the Messengers of the Lord, and caused to beat and imprison his Prophets, and persecuted his people, whom he had called and gathered out from among them, whom he had made to beat their Swords into Plow∣shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, and not to learn carnal War any more: but he raised them up, and armed them with Spiritual weapons; even with his own Spirit and Power, whereby they testified in the Streets and High-waies, and publick Markets and Synagogues, against the Pride, Vani∣ty, Lusts, and Hypocrisie of that generation, who were righ∣teous in their own eyes, though often cruelly entreated there∣fore, and they faithfully prophesied and foretold them of their judgment and downfal, which came upon them, as by seve∣ral warnings and Epistles delivered to Oliver and Richard Crom∣well, the Parliament, and other then Powers, yet upon Record doth appear.
And after it pleased God to restore thee, what oppressions, what banishments and evil entreatings they have met with, by men pretending thy authority, and cloaking their mischief with thy name, is known to most men in this Island, especial∣ly in England, where there is scarce a Prison that hath not been filled with them, nor a Judge, before whom they have not been haled, though they could never yet be found Guilty of any thing, that might deserve that usage, therefore the sense of their innocency did no doubt greatly contribute to move thee

three years ago to cause some hundreds of them to be set at liberty; for indeed their Sufferings are singular, and obvi∣ously distinguishable from all the rest of such as live under thee, in these two respects.
First, In that among all the Plots, contrived by others against thee, since thy return into Britain, there was never any owned of that people found or known to be guilty (tho many of them have been taken and imprisoned upon such kind of jealousies) but were alwaies found innocent and harmless, (as became the Fol∣lowers of Christ) not coveting after, nor contending for the Kingdoms of this World, but subject to every ordinance of man for Conscience sake.
Secondly, In that in the hottest times of persecution and the most violent prosecution of those Laws, made against Meetings (being cloathed with Innocency) they have boldly stood to their testimo∣ny for God, without creeping into holes or corners; or once hiding themselves, as all other Dissenters have done, but daily met, ac∣cording to their custom, in the publick places appointed for that end, so that none of thy Officers can say of them, that they have surprized them in a corner, overtaken them in a private Con∣venticle, or catched them lurking in their secret chambers: nor needed they to send out spies, to get them whom they were sure dai∣ly to find in their open assemblys, testifying for God and his Truth. By which those, that have an eye to see, may observe their Christian patience and courage, constancy and suffering, joy∣ned in one more than in any other People, that differ from them, or oppose them: And yet in the midst of those trou∣bles thou canst bear witness, that, as on the one part, they never sought to detract from thee, or to render thee and thy Government odious to the people, by nameless and scan∣dalous Pamphlets and Libels; so on the other hand, they have not spared to admonish, exhort, and reprove thee; and have faithfully discharged their Consciences towards thee, with∣out flattering words, as ever the true Prophets in antient times used to do, to those Kings and Princes, under whose Power, Violence, or Oppression was acted.
And albeit it be evident by experience to be most agreea∣ble both to Divine Truth and Humane Policy, to allow e∣very one to serve God, according to their Consciences; ne∣vertheless those other Sects, who, for the most part, durst not peep out in the times of Persecution, while these innocent People stood bold and faithful, do now combine in a joynt Confederacy (notwithstanding all the former Janglings and Contentions among themselves) to render us odious, seeking unjustly to wrest our Doctrine and Words, as if they were inconsistent both with Christianity and civil Society: so that to effectuat this their work of Malice against us, they have not been ashamed to take the help, and commend the Labours of some invidious Socinians against us. So do Herod and Pon∣tius Pilate agree to Crucifie Christ.
But our practice, known to thee by good experience to be more consistent with Christianity and civil Society, and the peace and welfare of this Island, than that of those that thus accuse us, doth sufficiently guard us against this Calumny, that we may indeed appeal to the testimony of thy Conscience, as a witness for us, in the face of the Nations.
These things moved me to present the world with a brief but true account of this Peoples Principles, in some short Theo∣logical Propositions, which, according to the will of God, proving successful, beyond my expectation, to the satisfaction of several, and to the moving in many a desire of being farther informed concerning us, as being every where evil spoken of; and likewise meeting with publick opposition by some, as such will alwayes do, so long as the Devil rules in the children of dis∣obedience, I was thereby further engaged in the liberty of the Lord, to present to the world, this Apology of the Truth held by those People, which, because of thy interest in them, and theirs in thee, as having first appeared and mostly increased in these Nations under thy rule, I make bold to present unto thee.
Thou know'st and hast experienced their faithfulness towards their God, their patience in suffering, their peaceableness towards

the King, their honesty, plainness and integrity in their faithful warnings and testimonies to thee; and if thou wilt allow thy self so much time as to read this, thou may'st find how conso∣nant their Principles are both to Scripture, Truth, and right Rea∣son. The simplicity of their behaviour, the generality of their condition, as being poor men and illiterate; the man∣ner of their procedure being without the wisdom and policy of this World, hath made many conclude them fools and mad men, and neglect them as not being capable of Reason. But tho it be to them as their Crown thus to be esteemed of the wise and great and learned of this world; and though they rejoyce to be accounted fools for Christs sake, yet of late some, even such, who in the worlds account, are esteemed both wise and learned, begin to judge otherwise of them, and find that they hold forth things very agreeable both to Scri∣pture, Reason, and true Learning.
As it is inconsistent with the Truth I bear, so it is far from me to use this Epistle as an Engine to flatter thee, the usual design of such works; and therefore I can neither dedicate it to thee, nor crave thy Patronage, as if thereby I might have more confidenne to present it to the World, or be more hope∣ful of its success. To God alone I owe what I have, and that more immediately in matters Spiritual, and therefore to him alone, and to the Service of his Truth, I dedicate whatever work he brings forth in me, to whom only the praise and honour appertains, whose Truth needs not the Patronage of worldly Princes, his Arm and Power being that alone, by which it is propagated, established and confirmed. But I found it upon my Spirit, to take occasion to present this Book unto thee, that, as thou hast been often warned by several of that People, who are inhabitants of England, so thou may'st not want a seasonable Advertisement from a Memher of thy an∣tient Kingdom of Scotland; and that thou may'st know (which I hope thou shalt have no reason to be troubled at) that God is raising up and increasing that People in that Nation. And the Nations shall also hereby know, that the Truth we

profess is not a work of Darkness, nor propagated by stealth, and that we are not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, because we know it to be the Power of God unto Salvation; and that we are no wayes so inconsistent with Government, nor such disturbers of the Peace, as our Enemies by traducing us, have sought to make the world believe we are, for what to thee I dare appeal as a witness of our peaceableness and Christian Patience.
Generations to come shall not more admire that singular step of Divine Providence, in restoring thee to thy Throne, without outward Blood-shed, than they shall admire the in∣crease and progress of this Truth, without all outward help, and against so great opposition, which shall be none of the least things rendring thy Memory remarkable. God hath done great things for thee, he hath sufficiently shewn thee, that it is by him Princes rule, and that he can pull down and set up at his pleasure. He hath often faithfully warned thee by his Ser∣vants, since he restored thee to thy Royal Dignity, that thy Heart might not wax wanton against him, to forget his Mer∣cies and Providences towards thee, whereby he might permit thee to be soothed up and lulled asleep in thy sins, by the flattering of Court-Parasits, who, by their fawning, are the ruin of many Princes.
There is no King in the World, who can so experimentally testifie of Gods Providence and Goodness; neither is there any who rules so many free People, so many true Christians, which thing renders thy Government more honourable, thy self more considerable, than the accession of many Nations filled with slavish and superstitious Souls.
Thou hast tasted of prosperity and adversity; thou know'st what it is to be banished thy Native Countrey, to be over∣ruled, as well as to rule and sit upon the Throne; and being oppressed, thou hast reason to know how hateful the Oppres∣sor is, both to God and man. If after all these Warnings and Advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the Lord withal thy Heart, but forget him, who remembered thee in thy distress,

and give up thy self to follow Lust and Vanity, surely great will be thy condemnation.
Against which snare, as well as the temptation of those, that may, or do feed thee, and prompt thee to evil, the most ex∣cellent and prevalent remedy will be, to apply thy self to that Light of Christ, which shineth in thy Conscience, which neither can nor will flatter thee, nor suffer thee to be at ease in thy sins, but doth and will deal plainly and faithfully with thee, as those that are followers thereof have also done.
GOD Almighty, who hath so signally hitherto visited thee with his love, so touch and reach thy heart, ere the day of thy visitation be expired, that thou mayst effectually turn to him, so as to im∣prove thy place and station for his Name. So wisheth, so prayeth
