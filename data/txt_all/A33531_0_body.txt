ALL who hold the Christian Faith, do beleeve that as the world had a beginning, and was a created sub∣stance; so it shall perish and come to an end (or be changed;) we seem not only to be on the last foot of time in this our Generation, but having stood 1650. years upon it, we have many thoughts of heart-long∣ings for the glorious appearing of the Son of God; Many expect him visibly to raign here on Earth in person, and that he shall be glorified even where he was crucified: Others look for a King∣dome of Righteousness, a wonderful light of Truth to be manifested, glorious out-breaking glympses and appearances of the infinite wisdom, the brightness and evidence of which shall scatter all those clouds, and dispell all those Exhalations which have mis-led us in the walkings of Christianity, the false Prophets, Clouds without rain, and Fires without heat, which have appeared amongst us: A people in this Nation hath had as great testimonies of this as any people extant on the Earth. The Power of the Almighty hath visibly appeared here these many years, scattering of Truths, and revealing hard sayings, and giving to under∣stand things that were hid for many Generations, though according to the wisdom of the Father he hath dispensed divers gifts, and that there is much of controversie among us; yet if all be really for Christ, and the increase of his Kingdom, what matters it? Let but all this move and incourage each in his place faithfully to labour in the Vineyard of the Lord. The Master is expected; how he will come, lets not wrangle a∣bout, nor with whom: Let's all high and low, as we profess to expect his coming, so prepare for it: Assuredly he will then come to us in his glory, or take us to his glory: Therefore all you that in sincerity profess Christianity, rowze up your selves, listen to the call of the Lord; He hath call'd afar off in Germany, he hath call'd at home, both here and in Eng∣land and Scotland: hear his voyce, prepare to meet the Lord your glory. Hitherto Christians have been the shame of Christianity, and Gospellers the scandal of the Gospel. There was a fatall and general Apostacy faln upon her who called her self the Spouse of Christ; she as Aholah & Aho∣libah played the Harlot; and though she here with us in England promised to return, yet she kept her Darlings still; if she parted with the Assyrian
 Adulterer, she kept the Syrian; God will have no mixture with Idols: England hath long desired a thorow Reformation: Let no man boggle at the work if another desires more then as some of you did 20. or 30. years since: why may not God have revealed this to him, and closed thine eyes now, as well as he revealed his will formerly to thee, and shut the eyes of others. Heretofore God put mean men only upon the work, here and there one; now he hath put many and great men upon the work; and what ever spurs they have; yet Christian, if they drive on Gods design, lay thy hand on thy mouth, and only admire how God brings things to pass what he intends.
Some men are so rational, they can see nothing of providence; reason devours Religion, and they are afraid lest they should happily find, or be found of God in a way they expected not; they wholly trust to reason, and will see and feel, or they will not beleeve.
Others are meerly sensual, and in the muddiness of their temper fol∣low sense only, because reason is so various; as many opinions as men even in things not above us; This is the main basis of Atheisme; shun this Scylla and that Charybdis, and understand, All Gods wayes are not only prudential, but providential, and God assuredly speaks both ways: He that improves providence to Lust, Error, and Transgression against the evident revealed will of God, is like him that because he hears of Election, sins at liberty, which is a mark of Rejection; He that in doubt∣ful things in streights for God, his glory, his Truth and Laws, the pu∣rity of Righteousness, in simplicity eyes God with constant and fervent prayers, walking humbly and watchfully over himself, and all that par∣take with him, spying what leads and misleads, and searching all inte∣rests, casts all away all but that of the Lord and his Righteousness: Surely he is like him that hearing of Election, and not knowing who it is, yet beleeving not only the truth of it, but blessings appertaining to it, saith, I will seek if happily I may find, I will knock because of the pro∣mise; and such are assured to enter life eternal.
Now all you that have in your eye the expectation of the glorious appearance of the Lord Christ in your several stations, Parliament, Princes and Nobles, Army, Judges, Officers, Magistrates, Rich men, Citizens, high and low, Rich and poor, one with another, despise not my weakness, inability, unworthiness; eye not my life past or present, but look to what I say, and as you find it bearing the mark and cha∣racter of fervent truth, accept it; if you doubt, labor satisfaction private∣ly; if you spy an error, rebuke or inform me with Christian wisdom and sobriety (my zeal for Gods cause, not self-confidence, hath put me forth to the work) and I shall willingly learn, and bless-God that makes me know his will, yea though by my failings, so it may work to the en∣crease of his glory, and propagation of truth. Amen, So be it.
And first give me leave to speak a word to you that have at present the Supremacy of Power, lay to heart these things: First, that you are in Gods stead; Next that there are many vows upon the Nation for Ju∣stice and Righteousness, against the then, and still continued unchristian, uncivil, nay inhumane dealings of man with man, as man with God, &c. You stand in the eys of all, all your goings are marked, and all your fail∣ings graven to Record: Publick necessities, your own consciences and
 peoples complaints, have plucked forth Declarations to men, as well as Covenants to God; the Obligations to men are still the same, if the rea∣son be the same: And for our Obligations wherein we lift up our hands to the most high God; truly though the Covenant (as is said) be out of date, that is the end of the Covenant for satisfaction to the King, to draw him to an union and conjunction with his great Councel, be disobliged; yet the seeking of the setling of this Nation, the three Nations, all Na∣tions, according to the Rule of Righteousness in love, peace, and unity, yea the drawing of them to uniformity, both in Doctrine and Discipline according to the Word of God (that is, by the evidence of truth and the manifestation of the Spirit) is still the duty of all Christians; for this had been a duty, had the Covenant never have been; it was before it, and must remain after.
The present Age is in the learned part very acute, at least to censure all persons, and then assuredly the actions of Enemies. You have many who foment jealousies from the supposed Errings and delays, some to one end, some to another, but all of beleeving the old experimented Rule of the destructiveness of popular Government from the variety and inconstancy, the dilatoriness and ambiguousness of their proceed∣ings, and unsatisfiedness of so many selfish Interests as are among them; this is to bring in the Government of a King again; Indeed multitude of occasions makes your proceedings slow-paced. Instead of particular Acts which are unsatisfactory, settle a compleat body of Government; you have means of supplying all indigencies; for if you improve your power to evident publick good, who will oppose? The Royalist and all among the Parliament party agree in many just things, yet uneffected: Justice is the preservation as foundation of the Throne. If you will raign safely, walk not in any of the wayes of them that fell before you; the president of their punishment, as their error is too nigh at hand: Let no interest deterr you from your Rule: Conserve indeed the real Liber∣ties of the people, free us from all those Legerdemains, the sleights of Oppression and Tyranny: What was unjust gain in the King, let not the State demand there; depend upon, & follow providence as far as you will, and be as remiss and so called merciful as you please; but in things just and evidently conducing to common good be severe and unalterable; this is righteous: In things difficult and doubtful, first use reason and pru∣dence, discover the interest opposing, and so proceed to afflict; this wil breed both fear and love: Alter a good and just thing, though to a more just, by degrees, and gently; for interests have here lawful pleas; but in evidently evil, it's the glory to make speed: Connive not there for an hour. What is here driven at, is the just Reformation of all our Laws, the Reduction of them to a Rule and standard of Christian Sim∣plicity. You that are of the long Robe, both in and out of the house, you whose knowledge both divine and humane abounds, as your abilities in outward as inward excellencies, Judges, Councellors and Officers of all sorts, look not at ancient Customes, but at the common Justice of them; not how they restrain particular evils, but as they conduce to uni∣versal good. If you will not admit the opposition of inferiors, do no∣thing but carrying that evidence of reason, as may stop the mouths of fools, as well as satisfie wise men: Let Godliness now in this light be
 the pretious gain; its the Pearl of great price: Surely there are things called Law, admitted practically for Law, and those opposed and com∣plained of, which are so notoriously unjust and irrational, so destructive to the Nation, as its the admiration of all men they are not amended; 'tis laid onely to the charge as (a matter of Interest) to be obstructors; see in the day the Lord opposing every evil thing; lay down Self, and God will stablish you. To you Princes and Nobles, I say, learn by Gods dealings with you, to see Thrones, and Scepters, Powers Civil and Military, Riches and Honors, Wisdom and all, are the gifts of the Almighty Wisdom: The Hand of Providence holds them forth, and disposeth them as it pleaseth: You have been bad Stewardes, amend your wayes; God hath here and there taken all away, otherwhere a great part, most have suffered: know God is able yet to take away the remain∣der: seek not therefore in passion to break out; what ever you do carry God along with you, and that not in thought but deed; assuredly the judgement else will be more smart, and deeper in every change, lets see the Work of God upon your hearts: change Profession into Practise of Christianity; idolize not the Form, but acting sincerely Zeal, Holiness, Austerity of Life in the avoiding the very appearances of evil, but ex∣emplary in Charity, and that not onely in giving much, but giving well; ordering the wayes not of your selves onely, but of your Families, so that the nobility of your souls in the excellence of graces may speak you illustrious above ancient riches, the Vertues or Vices of your Pro∣genitors. The same I may say to the Gentry, and men of great estate, City and Country; know God gives you much that you may do much for him; wherein is now your excellency? Titles! Alas they are but like Absoloms Pillar, serve but to eternize his faults and miserie. Good cloathes, large Retinue (as Revenew, if not larger) and they generally idle, and so necessarily vicious; Coaches and horses, bountiful and luxu∣rious fare, as much spent to feed and cloath ten, as well would satisfie each day one hundred: and for one hundred, as would plentifully main∣tain a thousand: Is God honored in all this, or is the poor profited? you may think it; for thus did your fathers, and so did you; but where is the Rule? the charges of the Commonwealth, if but five shillings, are a burthen to you, who spend ten pound, nay a hundred pound, nay a thou∣sand pound in waste; and they that have nought, follow your example, thereby believing they gain credit.
I now shall speak one word to the Army; You have followed Providence, make no Selfish Interest your Idol, lest Providence forsake you; be assured, others have many enemies; but for you, how few are your friends? there are great engagements upon you to God, who hath with such a continued course given success to your undertakings: I am so far from incouraging to Mutinies as I condemn them; there are just wayes; use them; I would draw all the world by the Clew of evident Reason and demonstrative Justice, much more Authorities; and when my reason could not prevail, I would at utmost lift up my voyce in prayer, with one hand and my heart, and hold my sword in the other for my defence. All that I say, is, be English men still, war us not into slavery whom you were made souldiers to redeem from bondage; but especially you Officers, let not promotion cause you sit still because at case.

I cannot but give out one word of advice to the great and emi∣nent City of this Nation; you were sensible of evils past, pride made you fat and you kicked with the heel: Though the greatness of Trade be broken, repine not; break not out, there is more lost in a day then can be gotten in a year; vex not Strangers from your Potency, nor Citizens by your Power: Petition not against Will instead of Law in others, and use far more irregularity, and upon less ground your selves: you heretofore gained the whole trading of the Nation into your company; we are all English men, shew us your Charter of Priviledge amongst the immunities of common Subjects: will you admit that a particular Com∣pany in your City should of the Grant of the King have a priviledge to the detriment of your general Charter? why should you then to the dammages of the whole Nation? Agree therefore to just things; give God the glory to part with quietly from the convictions of just Reason, what you might happily hold, either by Law or Power from your Grants, if the Grant be now evil, though not originally so; for Reason making things lawful, and being the bounds of Supream Monarches in general, it cannot be excluded their particular Grants: I know this will grate hard upon some among you; but if Christians, they will hear; it were better to be less rich, and less populous, so more honest and better regulated: you are at present, yea after so long sitting under the Sword of the Vengeance of the Lord, the sinke of abominable open prevailing sins: you that should be the Head to the Body, and the Eye to the Head in the greatness of Blessings, going before others, and being a Pattern, and Example to all the rest as a Mother City, as you have been stiled in the Nation; you are not active for that glorious Regiment of divine Reason, which as Christian, is held forth to us in the Old and New Testament of our Lord and Saviour, the Lord Christ Jesus: you labour not in what is established by Law; then sure it can be little ex∣pected that you should endeavor the Settlement of more: it is a work of difficulty; the opposition of the world will be; but the world is over∣come, and this gives hopes of Conquest, when we fight an Enemy that hath been beaten; its the course of the world to plead Presidents, and then the highest are the best: you are able, do the work; you have done much in settling a Magistracie in Chief; set to the design; this is of interest publike; but cease not here; fit them to the general end of Go∣vernment as well as to the particular one of Opinion: Its the way of all Corporations; this may not be evil in Politicks; but there is a better in States, much more in Christianity.
And from you I pass to all Cities and Corporations; You have evils every day which need remedy: you spy errors in your Charters, where∣by you see you are no way able to act for publike benefit: endeavour the Settlement by due consideration of just laws: present them, as is due, to the Supream Magistrate; let them settle the due priviledges, and so enable by a standing Law the Rule of your Christian Government in a social frame: Emulation may be hereby a spur to excellency of Order, while the improving the same priviledges, more or less, will evidence the excellency of men, which particular honor is the Bellows
 to blow up the spark of outward Vertue to a flame in a zealous or am∣bitious spirit.
And you rich men, and men of parts in all places, improve your Ta∣lents, hold forth the Light God imparts to you for the healing of this languishing Nation. The poor increase so vastly, through continued and unrepaired losses at Sea, and from the deadness of trading at Land, that unless some course be taken, all must to wrack; besides the mercilesness of Wretches, who sell the poor for a pair of Shooes; some by forging Judgements, and making folks to compound; some under colour of Warrants, breaking open of houses, being Bayliffs, and that at midnight; and then by the Justice, its said Justices of the Peace, let go with onely restoring the goods again, and this since acted in several places, they passing unpunished: otherwhere, a Bailiff upon a Judgement of one hun∣dred and eight pound, upon a debt of forty pound, out of the Common Pleas, (whereby ten pound sixteen shillings is due to one Officer for one Fee as dammage clear out of their estate, who are not worth one far∣thing) comes and makes seisure of a whole Shop of goods, worth by estimation above two hundred pounds in Grocery, and other small wares of Silk, Buttons, Lace, Ribbonds, Linnen, and Woollen cloath, &c. besides all the Housholdstuff, not leaving a bed to lie on, or stool to sit on; and these are (by whole Sale as they say) without any Inventory, or due apprisal, carryed away, and yet no Judgement satisfied, that is, not fully; forty six pounds is all can be made out of these goods; Men con∣stantly Arrested onely to force them to compound; for stand out a Suit, they are undone, yet who becomes careful to give or crave relief in these matters? Thus the poor and miserable people are daily utterly undone from Forms of Law, and the priviledge is in the Form. O Englishmen! deceive not your selves and others with shadows: These (so (more then) evident) errings, wandrings, failings, and unreasonable, unjust proce∣dures of so called (and proud of (as striving for the) name of best, purest, holiest, &c.) Christians, are the gaps and inlets to all those strange unheard of Opinions, those Blasphemous and unnatural bestial actions, and audacious Printings, which there is such a stir withal in the world: lay ought to their charge, they recriminate, and bespatter fouly, and soyl hangs: For the letter of the Scripture, if Christians plead that they are gone, it is as killing under the Gospel as the Law; for the letter of Scripture, and the lives of Christians, are as dif∣ferent as life and death, hell and heaven: This in contemplative heads, convinced of duty, works high, and assuredly brings forth all those Enthusiastick Rapsodies which so amaze the world; these urge them by degrees to greater heights of so called zeal for Gods Truth, and then after a Prophetick strain, they utter things hard to be under∣stood.
I cannot see any ground why any should be led away after them, nor give any credit to their sayings; No, I rather believe it to be the malice of the enemy, subtil to deceive; they generally drive at two things, Community, and Parity; the one against the Tyranny and Oppressi∣on, &c. of great men in power; the other against the covetize, selfishness, luxuriousness, &c. of rich men.

Now these things, O you great and rich men, do most assuredly, as you rightly conceive, tend to mutiny, to nourish feuds and envyings betwixt the multitude and you. All that I say, is, remedy not these evils by worse; you know what Beast you have to deal with; its of such stomack and force, that Prudence must have the honour of the manage∣ment; if you subdue, know its but by a part of the Beast (you must ad∣mit the Allusion) and what in the winding up hath been the issue of these things, the Pretorians at Rome, the Mamelucks in Aegypt, and o∣thers now testifie.
Consider therefore what you have to do; God hath set all these as signs and tokens to you; if you fall, the evil is of your selves, your improvidencies, lightnesses, and instabilities; your odd and incer∣tain followings of providences, evidence your fears, those your doubts, those the error of your principle; all things work contrary. O that every interest now could lay it self down at the foot of Jesus, and say, I part with all for thee, and then take up all it hath as from him, and of his gift, and be ready to part with it to morrow: Should we then live as we do now? How many would then give to the poor to day, lest they should have nothing to give to morrow? How would they then not delight in luxurious Apparel, Housholdstuff, &c. wherein multi∣titudes of riches lie dead and buried, lest another should enjoy them to morrow?
I know this to some melancholy spirit may give occasion to think I aim at, or give too great footing to Community and Parity; for they should in such contemplations cast away all; but I speak to the setled Christian, who knows its lawful to use the world, but all in due order; and as its lawful to recreate, but spend more time in prayer, then in play∣ing; so its lawful to rejoyce in (and to have that we may rejoyce in) outward blessings, but glorifie God with a greater portion to the poor then thy superfluity amounts to.
I intend a due and just reproof to excess and prodigality; Keep not all horses and doggs, some poor, not all in cloathing thy self, some to the naked, and thy self with moderacy; and yet if thou dost these things, thou meritest not Heaven, but thou avoidest the scandal of men.
Now that this is not done, is the fault of the Magistrate: O Watchman! its thy duty, but thou settest up for favor and by-respect, lazie, idle, and ignorant, and some evil Watchmen; therefore the work is not done; and that thou mighest trust these, thou madest thy Law to extend to each matter, or so intendest: and this was for two reasons, one that fools, or any might not err, for the Letter was their guide; the other, that they that would abuse their power, might not; and by this, not having each week a new Law, as occasion grew, Justice and Government is lost; for act by these particular Laws who can, in one hundred thousand things justly requiring remedy? The poor are thus sold for less then a pair of old shooes. If you would give a remedy to this, authorize some few, or many, who shall examine and determine all actions by, or against any person not worth an hundred pounds; for no Tryal
 can be under twelve pound, and the eighth part of all a man hath indeed of the thing in controversie to be spent in trial of whether my horse be mine or thine, my knife, nay the sheath of that knife, is a woful thing in a Christian Commonwealth: I shall not declaim against it, but onely say, its contrary to the worst of Heathens proceedings: I intend not to make the wound wider, while I desire healing; the difficulty seems to be onely to perswade men this is a wound: I have been as lenytive and gen∣tle in opening this Orifice of the ulcer of the Law and its practise as may be: I acknowledge it my Profession, not my Practise; and I account this according to the Head Rule of Englands Law, rather the Practise then the Principle, the error of Custom and interest from men, then of the Law; I hold forth nothing for Law which is treated of in the Laws of England, but according to the general rule of that Law, holding nothing contrary to the Law of God or just reason to be its Rule; all which I am ready to all, or any particular, to manifest when ever called thereto.
And now I come to speak one word to the people; You are of many sorts, and many interests you have; but as I find the worst and wickedest, as educated, professing Christianity, I advise you first to labour as such, to approve your selves: you have, its probable, been most of you Bap∣tized; the Covenant is indelible after once you have (I say not been Re∣baptized, or Baptized with the Spirit) but owned that Covenant, in the name Baptism; you are a debtor to the Lord Christ of all the duties of the Gospel.
This then, O poor Christian, goes far; its the Magistrates duty to rule well; so 'tis thine to obey well: 'Tis the same with you as with the peo∣ple in Christs time, when the great and powerful men speak the Law, and hold forth duties of Righteousness; do as they say, however they do; Its the Magistrates duty to hear and receive in a right way just things from you; and by the implicite Reason of power onely to vote them unreasonable and scandalous, is unsatisfactory; but if they do so, remain you in your integrity; break not out against them, untill the Lord shall open a way, he will do it in his due time; go on and satisfie thy soul in thy own righteousness, I say so, Comfort thy self in the mercy of thy God, who hath given thee to see others failings; and though thy condition be poor and needy, yet break not out: This I say of this great scarcity which hath faln upon us, wherein I believe many have perished, yet the evil hath light on the rude, stubborn, disordered poor, against whom mens bowels have been shut up; walk therefore according to the condition wherein God hath set you; exalt not your selves against great men, no nor against rich men, they will be too mighty for you; poor and proud is a high judgement, it brings misery with rejoycing. I know many of your souls die within you, when you see the wicked full, their eyes stare with fat; you wait upon God, and your children famish: yea many hence think God regardless, so unjust at first, at last deny him. Fools, know 'tis his Wisdom, he punishes or tries, or both; he punishes the body in the want of temporals for brea∣ches of duty to thy brother, neglecting the creature, or abusing it, and
 the Creator in it: He tries thee for his glory; was he unjust in his dea∣lings with Job? then note that poverty is no shame, Christ hath sancti∣fied it; no nor death, no not on the Cross, if as Christ the Captain of our salvation, thou beest made perfect through sufferings; not so, if thou blasphemest, &c.
And now one word to the Teachers of the people; Take heed to your selves, lest while you preach to others, your selves become not cast∣awayes: Some of you call your selves still the Clergy, I pray evidence by what special right or title: next you claim special Ordination; pray agree to what end; we are jealous of a many among you that would in∣gross all knowledge of the Gospel by as gainful a Trade as others did and do the Law; Briefly thus, If you have an infallible Word, shew it; if but a humane, and that that be attainable meerly or more especially by Learning, and that by disquisition knowledge shal encrease, then shew how parts and graces are distinguishable, and whether you wil quench the spirit altogether, or allow it altogether, or what or how; tel me why a bro∣ther, a member of the congregation, by them approved, may not improve his Talent to the edifying of his Brethren, as well as a Batchelor of Art, or Master before ordained as you call it, Common Place as you call it, and that often more sorily then an honest Bibling brother that never came at the Colledges, though at the Schools of the Prophets.
I cannot disallow Pastoral designation, and so in order from Pastoral or Teaching abilities; but to rest in designation any more then in ordina∣tion is incongruous; I know this opens a gap to fears of maintenance, but I see none justly; I pray God your standing off open not wider ones. If you be not the chief, you are none; what is the cause of your contest? I profess, I am not prejudiced against any person; I have been inquisitive in∣to intendments, and I judge the tree by the Fruit; may not man do so? is it not consonant to reason? When do you leave your Parishes generally but to get better, greater Livings? you have made the notions of the Religious a call from one people, and assent of the other call but stales to your additional maintenance.
I agree maintenance necessary, but I dare not boggle with the things of God; speak right out, eight score, be it so, is but sufficient by the year to maintain any Family, and till I come at that, I will not hold me to any call; you dare not do it; abuse not your selves, many see it; say not else you can have so much in another place. This is the beau∣tiful Harlot; your hot and eager disputes are the Alarms to our continued feuds (I cannot speak this to all, for there are some who imitate as much as this Age will permit, the example of Christ their Master; and what ever their opinions be in Politicks, they submit to the Powers for con∣science sake, and what ever they may think, they unrake not the coales of dissention, much less will they blow them to a flame;) here are all our griefs, here is one wound so long kept open, hereby is all obedience in all degrees lost and extinct, no respect of Magistrate in any degree; the truth is, the unfitness of some Magistrates, in not having abilities, and of others in misimproving them, and so of Ministers, hath heightned by a just judgement the evil of contempt on all sides; the retaining, and so
 eager seeking unwarrantable interests will make the Callings I fear suffer by bringing all into question; my reason is, This hath been Gods way here now and before: As all things necessary to salvation, are (through the goodness of God) plain and evident; so all things necessary to righ∣teous Government; what Magistrates stumble at, is the perversness of people in pursuing unjust ends to or against their fellow-brother, but e∣specially in cutting short or tying him up too strictly in the requisites of honour, order, and maintenance, and that for the Publick. The people stumble at the Magistrates evil using, and greatly abusing his Trust and power to self-interests, professing for the publick, but intending and visi∣bly bettering self. Its a received Rule, The disease is more then half cured, if the true reason be known.
O you Magistrates and Law-givers, you have the first part to act, be you righteous; evil and disordered people are the manifest tokens of a loose negligent Magistracy. Its evidently easie to settle a Nation more numerous, more disordered from ignorance and will, then this is; in the time we are discoursing how far the Magistrates power extends in Religious things, or in a Politick consideration what shall be done when the Nation is setled, before the settlement be made or agreed upon; let's not to avoid the evils of the worst of Levelling so called, give advan∣tages to their designs or proposals: Let's walk, so that we may by rea∣son as well as power maintain our proceedings; before we undertake, lets resolve to prosecute or surcease upon evident and publick reason; the want of this hath disobliged more then ever the Covenant or En∣gagement bound. And as I begun with you in Supream Power, Civil, or Military, or both, so give me leave to end; when you first engaged, when first you began this great work of Religion and Publick Liberty, how hot and spirituous were you, when great oppositions and many de∣signs were on foot? how watchful, when you were running for the Goale and striving for the Mastery, yea, as your selves said, venturing for your own Lives and Liberties? how regardless of bare forms? how then could you look at publick good in the nighest safest way? you could then lay out your way besides the common Road without the formality of suing out an Ad quod damnum; yea what strength of reason could not untye, the Sword did cut: Thus are the burthens, snares and vexations of truly religious people gone as to the conscience: Thus far you have been sincere in your Obligations to God; be also as faithful in your Trusts to the Nation. I would not have Judges taken away, root and branch; Judges are found in Holy Writ, yea such in power and Autho∣rity as we desire to have; we desire Justice should flow like streams, and Righteousness like mighty waters; the want of this impoverishes the Na∣tion; I am in such place, that I see and know it, yea I beleeve, let it be rightly scanned, it will appear most costly, more ruinous, and more en∣slaving then two such Armies; and as now practised, more intolerable then an universal Toleration so often charged upon you.
Now the Lord God of hearts lay what is written to all your hearts, and grant that you may go on as you have promised, namely, according to the great Trust that is upon you from the people, you proceed in pro∣curing
 common good, (which is the true and ultimate end of all just Government) and by a right aim at that, direct all your actions, and not cease to improve your best judgements, and lay out your most un∣wearied labours, notwithstanding all discouragements, either from ma∣lice, envy, danger, or any other cause whatsoever, to promote the same, so far, and so fast, as the subject matter will bear; and assuredly the bles∣sings of Heaven will attend and follow you and your Councels; other∣wise be assured, when God hath made use of you for a while, the Lord will cast you away, as others before you, and your place shall no more be found: for the averting of which judgement, and setling this Nation and the Government of quiet and peace upon the foundation of Truth and Righteousness, is the prayer of
