TO you, with good Rea∣son I dedicate these Letters, to whom they were writ, and to whom I have Dedicated my self: For whilst others were desirous of pleasures, Ambitious of Honors, or Covetous of wealth, you were all in all to me, all my pleasure, all my honour, all my wealth; nor had I other desire nor Ambition, but of you; so became I more deseving, similitude of disposition best gain∣ing and conserving Frends, know∣ing

you were not to be purchas'd bu by worth, nor conserv'd but by merit. Never any man then gain'd more by his Frends than I, not without some Acknowledgment to mine Enemies, (of whom I should have fewer, if they would be content to stand Neuters) Of which sort though I make no men∣tion, yet had I ever some who ad∣ded sharp spurs unto me of doing well, not to afford them the plea∣sure of my doing Ill: as Souldiers in battel, ar most commonly as much encouraged to fight, to deprive their Enemies of the Victory, as to gain it for their Frends. Accept then of this Dedication, and be still to me as you have ever been, so shall I study still to be alwayes to you as I have been,
