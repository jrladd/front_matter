HONOURED SIR,
THis small Present comes as a grateful Acknowledgement of the many Favours received from your Worthy Family. Your Grand∣father was my first Patron, and a great Encourager of my Ministry. Your Father did me very considera∣ble Kindnesses in the late distracted times. Your Self have been my Generous Landlord in the House where I had my Education from my Childhood; and on all occa∣sions you have expressed your real Affection (as to the Loyal Clergie




in general, so) particularly to my self, the meanest of them. Which Considerations have obliged me to prefix your Name to this Thanksgiving-Sermon, and to subscribe my self
Exon. May 30. 1684.
