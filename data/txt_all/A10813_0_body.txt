MAny Poettes, Right worshipfull Captaine, haue written the ho∣nours of such Noble and bewti∣full Ladies as they adore, applau∣ding in heroicall verse and most e∣loquent prose, their worthinesse, some vnder one title, some another, each one in his seuerall humour as their Patronize doth merit: to those whose quaint conceits, and wit∣tie inuentions are such, I leaue those amorous Sub∣iects; singing in my harsh Tunes, the honours of a Souldier, a Prince borne, and a Noble professour of Armes, which I boldly offer vnto your worship, that is a Patron to all, professing marshall discipline: and woorthily is so called, in all places where your forward seruice hath bene approued, but especially registred for a mirror of gentilitie, and honourable Souldier of our time, amongst the Irish Nation, and

inhabitants of that land, where your name is both feared and beloued, the one for your resolution, the other, for your vertues, bountie, and clemencie, whereof daily they reape the benefit. The due con∣sideration of all which, hath halled me on thus farre to aduenture, hoping your accustomed fauour shal be a protection to this straunger, whose honours, if you vouchsafe at such times as your serious affaires shall permit leisure to peruse, I hope somthing ther∣in may moue your delight, which I hartily wish. If happily it so proue, I shall hereafter be imboldned to shew my slender skill, in explaining the honors and vertues of our home-born aduenturers, whose ho∣nourable actions, are not the least in account, nor ought to rest in obliuion. Till when and euer, a∣mongst those which your worships fauours haue tyed in true loue vnto you, I will offer my vnfeined and dutifull seruice.
