May it please Your Sacred Majesty,
IN the lowest degree of Submission, I appeal to Your Regal Clemency for a Royal Pardon, in presuming so Sublime and Supream a Dedication, being very conscious of my Imperfections to manage this Great Enterprize: Yet considering that the meanest Loyal Sub∣ject hath some Interest in the Favour of his Prince, I em∣bolden'd my self on that account to shelter the follow Ser∣mon under the Defence of your Royal Patronage; which at its Promulgation in your Majesty's English Camp in Flan∣ders, gain'd the diligent Attention and Approbation of its Auditors. In pursuance whereof, I briefly manifested and maintain'd, The equitable Cause of your Majesty's late and continued Wars with the Adversaries of your Realms and Government; The indubitable Pleasure of God in pla∣cing and establishing your Royal Person on the Thrones of our Three Kingdoms; The seasonable Preservation of our British and Irish Church, in the Principles and Prero∣gatives thereof by your sacred Defence of her Christian
and Catholick Faith; The profitable Wea l of our Nation, by your Princely and Puissant Aid, in securing the just Rights and Liberties of Free-born Subjects; the innume∣rable Deliverances of your Secular, Civil, and Martial Ex∣cellency, from those dangerous and desperate Hazards to which you were often expos'd by the Fatal Peril of the Sword; And the incomparable Protection of your pious Person from the Destructive Designs of Sanguinary Assassinates, whose Aim (in all probability) was to subvert the present Govern∣ment.
These particular Instances, with the whole Matter de∣rived from the Subject of my Warlike Discourse (though delivered in a plain and familiar Method) I humbly Dedicate to the Condescention of your Royal and Favourable Perusal; being a Pledge of that Impartial Love and Loyalty which shall be duly and daily paid to your Regal Authority, by him who is, according to those Apostolical Rules, of Fearing God, Honouring the King, with Subjection for Conscience, and Submission for the Lord's sake,
Great SIR,
