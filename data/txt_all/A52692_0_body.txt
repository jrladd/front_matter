Courteous Reader,
I Do here give thee an ac∣count of what passed be∣tweene James Nayler and his Judges, as think∣ing it a part of my duty towards God and man; that thereby thou mayst see and know there is but one onely God, and one onely Jesus, which is

the Christ, who was crucified by the Jews at Jerusalem: Which who∣soever denies, let him be accur∣sed.
It hath been the Custome in form∣er Times, to Immure, Stone, or other wayes punish with Death such as did falsly stile themselves the onely Sons of the most High God; As thou may'st see in that faithful Chro∣nologer, John Speed; who affirm∣eth, That in the Reign of King Henry the third, there appeared a Grand Impostor somewhat in wicked∣ness resembling this of whom we are to treat: This man (or rather Devil) thinking himself to be some-body, boasted himself to be no-body in the eyes of the World, but as being sent from Heaven; And having a grave

and impudent aspect, pretended him∣self to be no less then the Saviour of Mankinde: And to strike a be∣lief into the easily-seduced People, he had wounded his hands, and feet, and side; Affirming these to be the wounds which the Jews had given him at Jerusalem. For which blasphe∣mous and horrid Doctrine, he was sentenced to be starved to death between the walls of a strong Prison; Where he and his Doctrine died: Even So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord.
Thou wilt in his Examination dis∣cover some Difference to be between him and GEORGE FOX: but I sup∣pose they are again reconciled.
I shall not trouble thee with all the many Letters which were conveyed

from him to others, or from them to him, lest I make my Relation swell too big: I shall onely give thee two or three of the chiefest; Out of which if thou canst pick but a little sence, and less Truth, thou canst do more then
