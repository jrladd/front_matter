AS EXPERIENCE playnely teacheth, tyme truely telleth, and nature for the moste parte appro∣ueth the diuersitie of our humane affects in diet: hovv not only to the vvorshipful or most honorable, but also to the very poo∣rest and of most base estate, the deli∣catest, most deintie, svvete and plea∣sant dishes, are not alvvayes aptely agreable, or to contente fully their minds, but sometimes for a shift and to their better liking, desireth more ordinarie, grosse and familiar fare: vvherby in nature they are the bet∣ter
contented, their appetites ofte times more quickened, their minds recreated, yea, and the healthes of their bodies the better also preser∣ued: euen so (righte vvorshipfull) touching the interne parte, diuine substance or invvarde affections of the soule: the heauenly nature also and most christen diet therof, expe∣rience and tyme beareth likevvyse their svvay, effectually to iudge and declare the same in truth, among the sounde members of Chrystes onely immaculate, most preciouse and vn∣spotted body, to their sufficient con∣tentation, quickning, recreating, and most healthfull preseruing. And al∣beit you are herein for your part, as the electe of God surely grounded in him of good purpose foreap∣poynted, and by grace moste hap∣pely called, to be in this life (vvyth prepared soule and quiet cōscience)
partaker of sundry his heauenly de∣licates, accustomably norished, most dayntely sedde, and abundauntly sa∣tisfied, to your very vvell lyking, in the excellencie of such your ioyouse and invvarde refection: and vvithout ouer secret hiding, a knovven distri∣butor of your good portion to o∣thers, for their bothe bodily and ghostly comforte at all times in ne∣cessitie, as the shevver fauourably foorth the flovving frutes of fayth∣fulnesse and true pietie: yet presu∣ming vpon your vertue and christen clemencie, I haue novve boldly at∣tempted and moste humbly cōmen∣ded vnto you (for varieties sake) this moste vnvvorthy, very slender, and ouer base present, to be at the least by your godly sufferaunce (as superfluous store amōg the rest) but a backestander in your sight, to bee looked vpon aloofe, a long and farre
off, as it vvere but by the vvay, euen vvith a glauncing eye, and at leisure to be tryed for your onely pleasure, vvhat is the effectuall and true taast therof. But not to alienate or alter by any meanes, your already vvel staied and most happy affections, so migh∣tily confirmed in you (and that in the best parte) by the ineffable po∣vver of Gods moste sacred spirite, your only and omnisufficient piller: but rather in dede to incitate you (if possibly it might be) to the better estimatiō of your ovvn former pro∣uision, and most faultlesse fornamed furniture. And truely greate reason vvhy it should be so, that things vvel knovven, and of moste excellencie, should haue condignely their beste preferment: for so God him selfe vvith the most godly, vvould vvishe by iustice it should so be, hovv soe∣uer most cōmonly they are knovvne
to the contrarie. And notvvithstan∣ding the dayes are novve diuersly daungerous, very dayntie, and ex∣ceede in muche fynenesse, vvhether in speaking, curiouse deuising, ex∣acte searching or penning of mat∣ter, touching either diuinitie or o∣thervvyse of Prophane descripti∣ons: so very singuler, exquisite, pycked, and tender are mens eares, naturally adioyned to their flouri∣shing, quicke, and ready vvyttes, profounde knovvledge and iudge∣mente: and therefore the more ha∣sardefull, and a meane truely to pur∣chase vnto themselues that deale in suche cases, rather reprochefull and many scornefull scoffes, than com∣mendation or shevv of good coun∣tenance, vnlesse they rarely exceede or surmount the vvel dooings of in∣finite others: and that also (touching thys my presente attempt (vvheras
the godly in these dayes, hath moste gratiously endeuored to set forth al∣ready, and that moste plentifully, di∣uers and sondry vvorks, very diuine∣ly, of great excellency, and of neces∣sitie, to quicken and stirre vp daily to God, the ouer drousie, slacke, & sick sinnefull soules, to reioyce also their mindes, and to fructifie before him, their vnprofitable and baraine harts: yet as a pore helper, a most inferiour labourer, or vvell vvilling drudge in the vineyarde of Christe, humbling my selfe most gladly, vnder the cor∣rection of the charitable and frend∣ly, of the godly vvise in their knovvn vertue and humblenesse, approued skilfulnesse, vvatchfulnesse, and nee∣die diligence, in that their holy fun∣ction appointed: beholding vvith them the necessity of the time, hovv the vvilde vveedes of vvilfulnesse to vvickednesse, sinne and abhominati∣on,
do daily abound and raign rank∣ly vvithout sufficient stoppe, in their very infectuous and filthie fulnesse, to choke, to represse and kepe lovve by the grounde, the fragraunte and svveete smelling fruites of vertue: vvhereby, as vvith infinite snares, the Diuell entangleth, still daily encrea∣seth, infecteth, poisoneth, and hazar∣deth all the leudly idle, carelesse and vaine children of this so sore crazed and old stouping vvorld of deth (al∣redie iudged, condemned, and at the brink of deth:) in vvhom, by vvhom, and during vvhose time, Satan temp∣teth, allureth, deceiueth, plucketh to∣vvardes him, and tosseth them as it seemeth vvith his cruell clavves, vp side dovvne at his pleasure, and dali∣eth vvith them at his vvill, as vvith his ovvne possessed, as vvith those that forsake God, as in a time of the contempt of god, of hating the clere
light of god, of louing the darknesse of the diuel to their condempnation more than the light, of selfe loue, of pride and vanitie, of defiled life, and suche like: a time approued of all times, most straunge, most monstru∣ous, and therefore the more daunge∣rous: vvherby sathan vvith his vvhole rablement of hellike ministers, the vvorld also it selfe, and the proud re∣bellious flesh, mainly bestirreth thē vvith their full povver togither, to make hauock, & to bring altogither vnder their seruile, most confused & bitter yoke: I haue in my moste sim∣ple vnderstanding, and as God therin by his grace hath directed me, ende∣uored to bestovve some parte of my time, in setting forthe sundry godly meditations and prayers, vpon speci∣al causes respected, as instrumentes, to shrub, to roote out, cutte dovvne, spoile and destroy, at the least some
poysoned euils, from the most beau∣tiful and louely vineyard of Christe. And as I haue by them thought most conuenient, that oure almightie and most terrible God (vvho seemeth to be greatly amongst vs forgotten) in euery of them shuld cheefely be had in remembrance, to be duely reuerē∣ced and feared, to be called vpon and most highly magnified: so haue I for the most part, made mention of our frailetie, present and most vvretched state, and of the mightie povver also of our forsaid enemies, hovv politike they are, hovv puissant, hovv vvatch∣ful, hovv cruel, hovv accustomably in all estates they do preuaile, and that God therfore by humble sute vvold sone graunt vs his mercy, extēd forth his arme to strengthen vs, and moste grationsly in time deliuer vs: least in the vvaightinesse of our sins yet daily amongste vs encreased, vve be ouer
sore pressed, oure consciences moste fovvly defiled, burdened, depely gal∣led and vvounded, the iudgementes of the highest not vvayed, oure in∣vvard senses benummed, oure hartes hardened, all diuine graces contem∣ned, and so vvith the plages of God, the more svviftly by his iustice con∣founded: heaping in the vvhile vēge∣ance vpō our selues, against the day of his vvrathe and publike declarati∣on, of his proclaimed and iust iudge∣ment, and to be dampned vvith the vvorld, vvith the Diuell, and his An∣gels for euer: vnto vvhom, by vvhose custome, and importune knocking at the doores of our gracelesse, very vaine, and most frutelesse hearts (the knocking of the Lorde Christ vvil∣fully neglected) vvee haue subiected oure selues, and opened vvide vnto him, to let in both him self, his con∣ioyned companions, and vvith them
all abhomination and vnrightuouse∣neste, to quicken vvith more hast the flames of Gods furie, to make pon∣derous and ouer heauie, the svvitfe descending ballance, of his very ter∣rible & irrcuokeable iustice. To the ende therefore, this small and moste simple volume, may (vnder youre godly protection) gather the rather some estimation and credite, & passe forth for good to the vse of the god∣ly, I moste humbly beseeche youre vvorship, so to accepte it in the sim∣plicitie thereof, and graunt thereun∣to your Christian furtherance, that some good for Goddes glory, may grovve thereby to some, that some liues at the least may be somevvhat amended, the furies of God the soo∣ner preuented, and the bright lighte of the sonne of god shine with more povver amongste vs, to ouerthrovve vs in his feare, to beate flatte to the
earth, our carthie and proude fleshe, and to vvaste soone or consume, for good and most happie chaunge, our most damnable vvorks of darknesse. I shall (as of bounden duetie, for this and for other the like causes deser∣ued) most humbly pray for you, that God in mercie may euer blesse, both you, your moste vvorthy belo∣ued in Christe, your of∣spring, and vvhole familie.
Your humble and daily Oratoure, THOMAS Paulfreyman.
