I Presume I shall no
sooner appear up∣on
the Stage I am
prepared for, but
I must without evasion ex∣pect
to be assaulted by that
furious and inconsiderate
Monster called Censour;
whose lashes I will receive

with the same slight concern,
the Lacedemonians did the
cruelty of their Correctors,
sporting themselves whilst
their backs were torn with
the unmerciful Whip. Of
that efficacy is Resolution,
that it presents pain but meer
Opinion, and values a
scoffing Lucian, or a satyri∣cal
Memphus, no more then
a harmless Hellespont did the
vain threats of a proud Xer∣xes.
Seneca saith well, better
aliud agere quam nihil, for

Idleness is the Devils oppor∣tunity:
the Considerations
of which (with my assent
to the Judgment of Thucidi∣des,
who sayes, To know a
thing and not to express it,
is all one as thongh he knew
it not) made me to expose
my self to publick view. My
Subject is good and great,
called by the Name of Na∣ture;
here I present her, ex∣pressing
mans Ingratitude,
who is fit to strip her of
those Robes of Priviledge

that God himself hath en∣dowed
her with, not: consi∣dering
that what she acts, is
by the vertue of his Power;
and that She is one of those
Mirrours that represents him
to us, which a Philosophick
Passion adores as the supream
Efficient. But indeed, how
can She expect our Vene∣ration,
till we have divested
our selves of that prejudice
ignorance possesses us with,
which must be done by a se∣rious
reflex upon her Effects,

as this little Volumn will ac∣quaint
you, if you read it
with an impartial and unbya∣sed
Reason; for I have, as all
others of the same Inclinati∣on
must do, used Philosophy
as the Tellescope by which
we must make our Observati∣ons,
as you will, when you see,
find my curiosity descending
to little Insects, and that with
wonder at their production
out of Corruption; from
thence I view her care in
beautifying this little Globe

we live in, with Robes suta∣ble
to every Season; and when
I ascend the lower Region,
and mark the Clouds rang∣ing
themselves in such bo∣dies
as though they intended
another Deluge, it occasions
wonder; so likewise the cold∣ness
of the middle Region
with the heat of the upper,
and the Element of Fire, must
be Miracles to ignorance.
And if we observe the Moon,
with the Motion attending
that of the Seas flux and re∣flux,

it would make us judge,
that there is some secret con∣tract
made ab Origine be∣twixt
her and the watery Ele∣ment.
Mercury and Venus
I have spoken of in their pla∣ces:
the next that presents us
with cause of Admiration, is
the glorious Sun, the Lumi∣nary
of the Universe, called
by some, and not improperly,
the Anima Mundi, for we find
her approach gives life to Ve∣gitives,
sense to Animals, and
almost a new Nature to Rati∣onals.

As for Mars, Jupi∣ter,
and Saturn, the Eighth
Sphere, and Christalline Hea∣ven,
& the Empyreum, I have
treated on, if not like a know∣ing
Secretary of Nature, yet
a submiss Admirer of her.
And whereas I make a refuta∣tion
of Errours, as an additi∣on
to my Title, some perhaps
will say, I am like the Tinker,
that for stopping of one hole
make two, or for my refut∣ing
of one Errour, I have
made two; it may be I have

in the Opinion of some: But
whether I have or no, who
shall be judge? for what ap∣pears
an Errour to one, is to
another a very evident truth:
sometimes a Week or a Day,
nay an hour puts a change
upon an Opinion of many
years standing. But let my
Errours be as great and as ma∣ny
as I pretend to correct,
Reason shall convince me,
and command my Acknow∣ledgment;
for it's our Errours
that presents us human. I

have writ this to give Satis∣faction
to others if I can;
but if not, howsoever I have
secured it to my self; And
let the Reader judge of it as
it pleases him. I have writ that
which delights me; And if
envie cause a misapplication
of my intention, it matters
not, the contempt of it will
make me bold to say, I value
it and thee after the rate as
thou dost it and me.
The assertions here laid
down are plain and perspicu∣ous,

convincing and satis∣factory
to the intelligent.
But I know that common
prejudice which is usually
taken of any thing (though
never so true) which is con∣trary
to any mans belief, it
does beget such Passion and
animosity, &c. and makes
such a breach as is hardly to
be repaired. And since our
own Opinion may make it
disputable what reason we
have to pretend of convince
another by, I shall only offer

this for common satisfaction,
that things demonstrable are
the most evident marks of
Truth; and that they are so
clearly manifested in this lit∣tle
Book, deserves nothing
but sobriety and moderation,
and a well weighing of the
matter herein contained.
Reader, I am loth to leave
thee, but that I would not
keep thee from the Book it
self, which I hope will be to
thy ample satisfaction, &c.
Vale.
