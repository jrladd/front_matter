Gentlemen,
APon my return out of the Low-Countries, where in Holland, Brabant, and the Province of Ʋtrecht, I have spent almost the time of an an ordinary Appren∣tiship, visating the Universities of Leyden, Lovan, and Ʋtrecht, and dwelling some years in the re∣nowned City of Amsterdam to sa∣tisfie an honest curiosity of know∣ing
the world (which is justly said to be epitomized in Amsterdam) and to accomplish my studies of nature, Philosophy and Physick, I visited my very worthy friend Sa∣muel Hartlib Esq (the great lover and promoter to his power) of all ingenious Arts, and Artists what∣soever, of whom I received a pa∣per printed in Dutch, with his ear∣nest request that I would take the pains to make it speak English, be∣cause (as he was very much perswa∣ded) that the common good of the English Nation would be here∣by not a little promoted; foras∣much as the spreading of these Chyrurgical Medicines was recom∣mended to him from his worthy and intimate friend Mr. Moriaen, a Gentleman of knowing integrity and repute, dwelling in Amsterdam (as my self can witness) excellently versed in the Mathematicks, curi∣ously seen in the Mechanicks (as becomes him that was born at
A City famous for ingenious in∣ventions, Mathemati∣cal, and Mc∣chanical. Noremburgh in upper Germany) studied in Divinity and Physick,
but especially seen and practised in the Chymical Laboratory, as wel as in the subtil & sagacious cōceptions of the witty Van Helmont, Paracel∣sus, and the rest of the Tribe (a generation of writers in main re∣spects, deserving largest commen∣dations from others, if it were not their ill luck for the most part to be over large in praise of themselves, and their preparations; but perad∣venture the want of good neigh∣bours may excuse them (at least in some measure) from so ingenious and learned hand Mr. Harblib re∣ceived this discourse, not as from the Author, but as Promoter of the same, as having full knowledge of the truth of the Contents, when I had presented my much honoured friend with his paper in English, his former request begot another, viz. that I would devise some way how the Contents might be published to the best advantage, so as the mat∣ter might come to trial, I could de∣vise no better way (worthy Gen∣tlemen, ingenious Artists) than by
recommending the same to your impartial trial, as knowing you both able to judge, abounding with oppertunities of trial, and of that candor and ingenuity, that you will make a true report of what you finde, not being offended at the appearance of Empericalness in the discourse or practice therein commended, nor fearing that if these Medicaments prove so effec∣tual as it is said, that they shall hin∣der threpute of the ingenious Chy∣rurgion, or make him seem less useful, forasmuch as the Author requires a skilful Artist, and refers many things in the application of his Balsoms, to the judgement of of the expert Operatour, What the Author is I can say no more, but that it appears in the discourse that he was no natural Dutch-man, but rather as I guess a German, which Nation God hath made very hap∣py in the invention of many profi∣table remedies in Physick and Chy∣rurgery, by reason I suppose of their pertinacious industry in ma∣nual
nual experiments, and because of their great courage in daring to haunt untrodden paths in the Quest of natures Secrets. I commend the whole to your skilful trial, and sin∣cere judgement, and rest,

From my house in White Crossstreet, neer Crip∣plegate, Nov. 2. 1654.
