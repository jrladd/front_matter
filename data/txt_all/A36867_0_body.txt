RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
GOD having been pleased not to suffer my heart to be much enamoured with worldly pre∣ferments & imployes of that nature, whereby I have possessed my soule in quietnesse and enjoyed more liberty: In acknowledgement of that favour and being perswaded withall that God hath not weaned me from these pleasures for to
sit still & to be idle: my chiefe studie hath been, according to my poore ability, to bu∣sie my mind and to apply my heart to spi∣rituall things, which might both better my selfe and others, and make me (if not so rich and so considerable in this life, yet (I am sure) through God his free mercy) rich and eminent enough in the life to come. Wherefore, in the prosecution of that holy resolution, after severall Works of this nature which by Gods providence I have given to the publick in the French tongue, and which (I may say it truly & without vanity) have not been without fruit: It hath pleased the same divine Wisdome to put into my heart to give un∣to this Pious Nation, this little Work in their owne language. And forasmuch as your Honours are of the eminentest of the kingdome, and of the mainest and princi∣pal Pillars, which, under your most Pious and most Gratious Soveraigne, uphold both this Church and Common wealth: & furthermore, seeing also that all the eyes of this florishing Nation (grounded up∣on that assured knowledge it hath of your fervent Love to GOD, Loyalty to your
PRINCE, and tender affection to your Countrey) are now fixed upon you as upon so many Moses standing in the gap be∣tween them and Gods threatning judge∣ments: I have thought my selfe bound in duty (having so faire an opportunity as this is) to crowd among the rest into your presence, and to shew as wel as others, this publick and true testimony of my most humble respects, in presenting first with all humility this poore labour of mine un∣to your Honors, joyntly: being unwilling (so long as I finde divers presidents of the like dedications) to divide and sepa∣rate those whom GOD and the KING have joyned together: beseeching you to accept of it; to vouchsafe it your Patro∣nage, and to beare in its forefront your Honourable Names. I presume that for the Author his sake, your Honors will not deny me that favour. And the rather, be∣cause it tends to the same end that yee aime at, to wit Gods Glory, and the fur∣therance of True Religion. For, Most Illustrious Lords, I have beene an eye∣witnesse above this eighteen years, of that Constant Zeale and Exemplary Pietie
which is so resplendent in your Honors. And oftentimes being ravished in ad∣miration to see such extraordinary gifts & graces in such great Persons, notwith∣standing the corruption of the times: I have blessed God heartily for it, and pray∣ed his Divine Majestie to powre more and more upon your Lordships, the dew of his heavenly graces unto the end. And indeed, Right Honourable, to conclude this in a word, I can attest upon mine owne knowledge of that eighteen yeares standing: that although your Honours doe live here among men, your conver∣sation hath been for the most part with God; neglecting no meanes (for all your great and weighty occasions) to waite and attend upon his service, in his holy Courts and Sanctuaries. But alas, all that I can say in that behalfe, is but as a drop of water throwne into the vast O∣cean. And therefore, Right Honorable, I must crave leave to say no more: and aske pardon that I have said so little, and so far short of what your Honors deserve.
As for the Author and Worke, I should say something too, if he and his Workes
were not better knowne than I can ex∣presse, Yet I will say this by the way; that he hath been, is, (and long may hee be) one of the Worthiest and most powerfull Instruments in Gods hand for the con∣version of Soules, destruction of Babel, and rearing up of Bethel; as this Age hath afforded. And for this particular Worke of his, it shall suffice me to say (to give it the highest commendation I can) that it is Peter du Moulins.
Finally, Right Honourable, I should say something also touching my selfe: which shall bee onely to beseech againe your Lordships to be pleased to Pardon the boldnesse of a poore stranger, in de∣dicating this small book, and first fruits of his (that have seene the light in the English tongue) unto your Honours: excuse the defects that may be found in the same, (though I hope you shall finde it faithfully translated, and free from any grosse barbarismes in the Language:) and to attribute that excesse of teme∣ritie, to the excesse of the honour I beare unto your Lordships: for whom I shall ne∣ver cease to call upon God for an en∣crease
of Honor and long Prosperity here on Earth, untill that being full of dayes, and having finished your course in his feare, yee receive that Crowne of glory which is laid up for you in Heaven.
And so, fearing to be too tedious and troublesome unto your Honours: I hum∣bly take my leave and rest,
Most Renowned Lords
