Reverend Sir,
YOur benevolent Admission of me to Preach in your Church, to gratifie my good Friend Mr. George Spen∣cer, one of the present Bayliffs of your Town, hath put me up∣on a little more Labour then I expected. Yet I do not so much lay the blame upon your Admission, which I pro∣nounce free from blame; as upon the over-imprudence of some, whose Tongues being liquoured with the Oyle of Confidence, have charged me with Rayling against the Kings Churches in my Sermon. An odious Con∣tumely indeed. What! for a son of the Church of England to revile the Gods, and speak evil of the Ruler of his People? To fault the Edicts of his Soveraigne, The Fa∣ther of his Countrey: And in a word, the the nursing Father of this Church? Sir, now
I declare unto you plainely, whom I am bound notwithstanding to honour as a Father; that you are highly concern'd. Concern'd in∣deed, that you would let me pass unchastised for profaning your Pulpit by so rude a De∣clamation, wherein as is reported, I was so unpardonably faulty. But Sir, seeing it is the usual practise of those who neither under∣stand their duty to God, or the King, to a∣buse and traduce with all malice imaginable those who hinder the building of their Babel: I am resolved, in steed of any other Apolo∣gy, to expose my Sermon to your own judi∣cious Examination. And lest you should be thought to be over partial to your friend, I know not what you can doe less, then bring the Authour and his Sermon to a fair Trial. So without any more wordes; when you have perused the Sermon which was preached be∣fore your self, If you think it worth the Pub∣lication, you may doe as you think fit with it, and in order thereunto you may Com∣mand,
Chediock, Nov. 18. 1672.
