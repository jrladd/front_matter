My Lord,
THE short Experience I
had of your Friendship
and Candor, enclines
me now to believe you will

not reject this Poor Compa∣nion,
although he boldly at∣tempts
to intrude himself up∣on
your Honour's Protection.
Indeed I am no great Friend
to the Common Vanity of Let∣ters
Dedicatory, and therefore
in making my Court to you,
instead of troubling you with
an impertinent Dinn of Compli∣ments,
I shall only tell you
the naked Cause that urg'd me
to lay these Papers before
you.
Sir, 'tis the general Chara∣cter
you bear of a true Eng∣lish
Gentleman, One that in
all Respects, both by your

Practice and President, are
duly qualified to vindicate
and assert the Rights and
Priveleges of a Country Life;
and that it is that has forc'd
upon you the Patronage of
these few Letters, which if
you think worth your Perusal
and Owning (and truly that at
present is the most disturbing
Consideration) you'll soon
find that the Country Gentle∣man
has not more Need of a
City Companion, than the City
Companion has of a Country
Patron.
Well, my Lord, he humbly
flies to you for Safeguard, and

who so fit to shelter and de∣fend
him as he that not only
enjoys the Blessings of a well-order'd
Country Life, but withal
knows, but hates and scorns,
the Follies and Vices of the
Town.
Sir, I am affraid, consi∣dering
what a Lewd World
this Poor Companion is to
make his Progress in, if I
should turn him out alone,
some Bully, Sharper, &c.
would meet and use him
rudely, which they dare
not, so long as he conti∣nues
under the Shadow of
your Protection; for once,

then, Sir, be pleased to
take him into your Care,
at least foster him for a
Night or two, till you have
examin'd his Credentials, and
then dispose of him as you
shall think fit.
But, Sir, while I am thus
importuning you for ano∣ther
I forget my self, who
perhaps may more want an
Advocate to excuse the Bold∣ness
and Trouble of the De∣dication
than the Book it∣self
does a Patron, and
some body to plead for the
Errours and Frailties of it.
There's nothing, that I know,

but an extraordinary Prin∣ciple
of Generosity can engage
you, either to forgive the
one or accept the other, and
that, at a venture, I will de∣pend
upon, who am,
My Lord,
Your Honour's
most obedient Servant
