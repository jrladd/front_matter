SIR,
THE Piety of a Son to the Memory of so Good a Father, may, I hope, in some measure excuse my Presumption in laying this Part of his Remains at Your Sacred Feet. And what will farther plead for me is, my seconding his Intentions in Offering that to Your Majesty, which he (as he often told me) design'd more immediately for Your Royal Consideration.
I am Sensible this Subject may be thought to be here handled with too much Modesty; But I am also Sensible that the Iniquity of those Times would not bear with bolder Truth and Reason: Yet I may with Confidence aver, if he be duely weigh'd he will be found to have
Asserted the Prerogative with the Strength of the Law, and the Duty of a Loyal Subject.
SIR,
When This was preparing, a Malevolent Faction would have made the very Laws Rebellious, and to spurn against their Maker. Yet since Divine Providence has plac'd Your Majesty as Glorious at the Head of Your Laws as at the Head of your Armies, I have only to Pray for the Continuance of Your Happy Life and Reign, as being
SIR,
