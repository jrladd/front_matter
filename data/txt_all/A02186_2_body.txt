IT is, and hath beene long since (Right Worshipfull) the cu∣stome of the Learned, that when they commended to publike view (therein ayming a common good) their Christian

pains and diuine indeuors (know∣ing that the truth hath and al∣wayes had many oppositions and detractions) to present them to men of high place, and well affe∣cted in Religion, that so their works might passe with lesse feare, and danger of disgrace and op∣probry: I (though vnlearned) ma∣king bold to imitate their Christi∣an policie herein, haue presumed to present that doctrine to your Worships eyes, that lately in pub∣like place was sounded in your eares, both of which senses are great instruments in the furthe∣rance of our soules in the way of Gods Kingdome; for as the eare conuayeth grace to the affections of the soule; so the eye bringeth much matter to the vnderstanding of the minde; nay, the eare cannot so often be an Andito, as the eye

an Oratour to the Conscience.
For which cause (your Wor∣ships nothing more affecting than growth in grace and Religion) I haue attempted to commend to your often consideration, Tormen∣ting Tophet: for as nothing allu∣reth the heart to grace, more then Gods mercies, so nothing is more preualent against sinne than his fearfull and terrible Iudge∣ments.
If therfore your gracious Wor∣ships shall vouchsafe to accept of these my poore presented pains, it will giue much content to mine own heart, & (doubtlesse) answera∣ble comfort to your owne soules.
And to conclude, as the Lord hath aboundantly blessed your Worships with graces internal, & blessings externall; So (to vse the words of the Apostle) the very God

of peace sanctifie you still throughout, and I pray God that your whole spi∣rits, and Soules, and bodies, may be kept blamelesse to the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ, Amen.
From Hempsted in Essex, Ianuary, 10. 1629.
