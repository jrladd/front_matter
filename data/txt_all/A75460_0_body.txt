HAving nothing of mine own that is worthy your Acceptance, to express my Cordiall respects and thankful∣nesse for those many favours which I have received from you, I have taken some spiritu∣all Receipts out of Gods sacred Dispensatory which I am bold to present or Dedicate to your Honour, because they are speciall Cordialls for the spirits, and precious Antidotes against the evill of sad times: Wherein also you will finde some Balm of Gilead for the cure of all spirituall diseases, if it be applyed close to the part that is ill affected, with the hand of Faith. If these things do relish well with your spi∣rituall Palate, then I am confident you will take sometime to ruminate hereupon: for I know it hath been your constant course to Meditate something day∣ly of Divine and heavenly things; which did strong∣ly induce me to present these unripe fruits of my la∣bours
 to you, which I gathered in mine old age for mine own use, according to my first Intention. Though I have thus laboured out of my Calling, as I am a Physician; yet I am not out of my professi∣on, as I am a Christian.
Now seing this Work is come to Publick view, I do humbly desire your favourable construction of the frailties that are in it, and that you will be plea∣sed to vindicate it from carping spirits: for I did not write it to please their curiosity: but to refresh and comfort those that do any way stand in need of spirituall consolation. If any thing herein can give you any reasonable satisfaction, let God have the honour and glory of his own Work, and I shall greatly rejoice therein, and shall still remain your much obliged Servant,
