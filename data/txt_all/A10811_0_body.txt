RYghtworshipful,
the Persians honoured their Kings▪ (as I reade that neuer sawe him) as he passed tho∣rowe the Countreyes in his Progresse he was presen∣ted of many his wealthy Subiects with riche giftes, which he thank fully receiued. A poore Shepheard standing by, and noting earnestly the curtesie of the King, was greeued at the heart, that he had not to bestowe as large∣ly as the best: yet to shewe his zeale, he hyeth him hastily vnto a precious well not farre off, and dippyng therein his sweatie hat, pre∣sentes it full of water vnto the King: the which he so gratefully re∣ceiued, as he did the richest gift, noting in the poore swaine his zeale, and loue which by his simplenesse appeared to be more to him then many that were then present: My selfe (Worshipfull sir,) represen∣ting the simple shepheard, humbly doe present these my rude labours vnto your handes, and doe craue of your Worshippe fauourable ac∣ceptans of the same, accounting of it, as of the hat full of water, and considering the zeale of the giuer, not the worthinesse of the gifte, ex∣cusing

the boldnesse of blinde Bayarde, whose will is farre greater then his skill, your Worshippe shall then shewe your selfe in curtesie the rightfull heire of the Persian King. Wherefore hearing of your Worships pretended voyage (being a curtesie amongest vs English∣men) to represent vnto our betters whome we honour some simple gift as a farewell in writing whereby their names might be remem∣bred in their absence, and seeing none of the learned sort haue vnder∣taken to write according to custome, I being the vnworthyest, yet the most willing, was lothe good Knight that you should depart our En∣glishe coastes without some remembery to be published in prayse both to your worshippe, and the rest of your Gentlemen followers in this your noble exploit, who although by name I doe not knowe them as I woulde, whereby I might giue them their honour due vnto them yet euer as long as my tongue can speake, or my simple hand holde penne to wryte, I will euer renowme your worship, and them whose seruice for Countrey hath bene such as neuer English gentleman or other yet at∣chieued but you: therefore they that haue not giuen you that honor worthie your desartes, haue sought to robbe you of your worthines, a base thing in schollers and the learned who seeth other countrey∣men that hath not vndertaken the one halfe of your troubles to be re∣gistred in the mindes of all men for euer, by their meanes which hath by wryting giuen them their desartes: as the conquest of the West Indyes can witnesse, wherein many of theyr names is explained in other wryters also: then Englishmen what dishonour doe you our famous Drake, that you haue left his name so long vnwritten of, whome fame hath bruited in all the whole worlde for his most fa∣mous enterprises, and hath made him to be admired▪ among his mor∣tall foes for his valour, O noble English heart, neuer yet daunted, whome the report of any euill newes howe vehement soeuer they be, can let from thy determinate voyage wherein you may rightly be compared to that conquered Monarke, for valor of mind Alexander who although he was by his spies aduertised that the host of the Persi∣an King Darius was in a maner to be compared as a mountaine to his molehill, yet valiantly he gaue him the ouerthrowe, and atchieued the victorie, the like victorie thryse famous Knight God sende vnto you, that you may triumph ouer all your enemies like Alexander in this

exployt, all this happynesse with much more wish I vnto the most, va∣liant and fortunate Syr Francis Drake, that with such honour and willingnesse vndertaketh our princes seruice, yea, we are all bounde by duetie to pray for the happynesse of your estate for that there bee fewe, that are not the better for your last prosperous returne, which God for his mercy sende nowe to be so happy, that as litle Dauid your power may be such that you may beate downe all them that as Golias shall come to hinder you of any Iote of your determination, well wor∣thy Knight, would my abilitie were answerable to my wil, then should thy honourable name liue eternally amongest vs men on the earth: Ʋnthankfull Englishmen that can suffer your wohthy countreyman to rhis,  with vnthankefulnesse, so soone to be forgotten, my selfe the vnworthyest of the Countrey haue long expected some thing from the learnee in your commendati∣on, but seeing them all to be so vnmindfull of so worthy a personage, I baue thus rudely aduentured, though simply, to let all my good coun∣treymen by publishing the same to vnderstande of your Worships de∣parture to the Seas, with all your worthy company, whereby they may see the valour that is harboured in your noble heart, and pray with me for your happy returne.

VVOrthy Syr Francis Drake, that hath so nobly aduentured in many calamities three whole yeeres, continuing at fortunes hazard, eftsoones likely to be drenched in the raging floudes, and then in daunger of the vnknowen rockes, besides many other pe∣rilles incident to sea faring wightes, as falling into the handes of your professed mortall foes which daily awaited your returne: yet all this can nothing daunt his worthye heart, nor any one whit dismay him at all, for the Lorde which is most gracious in all his workes hath left you here among vs as a mirrour for our countreymen to looke into, by your example to mooue others to the attempting the like enterprises: many other Gentlemen there be in this our laude, but I knowe fewe that will vndertake the like, or none at all that can with skill so well perfourme it, or


norant people like my selfe, I heare to say mutteringly, O Lorde, what doe these Gentiles meane so to roome from home that enioye such wealth as they doe, and maye staye at their owne pleasure, but the rein they shewe their basenesse, which is so vnanswerable to the mindes of the valiant, as the flint stone to the precious diamonde, but such are those base fellowes as for gaine at home will not sticke to doe any thing, when the noble minde abroade aduentu∣reth for fame, which when with great peril they haue most valiantly atchieued, the enuiousnesse of our countreymen is such as they disdaine to giue them the honour they haue gained for their right as it is well séene by that worthye Knight Sir Humphrey Gylbert whose valour deserued thankes of his countrey if they had bene gratefull, the which they be lothe to bestowe vpon him, but he is dead, and in countreyes cause shortened his life, leauing many sorowe for his death, yet I thinke it were great pity seeing his actions were such, as your worship I knowe can wit∣nesse to be honourable that his valiant name should so sud∣denly die with his bodie, without some remēbrance wher∣by his children hereafter might reape the rewarde of their fathers fame, and by his good actions be encouraged to i∣mitate his wayes. This renowmed Knight as your wor∣thinesse is more then any I knowe, and that you haue so well deserued, I trust some learned which can write, will of their good nature emploie their paines to your praise & in learned stile register your noble fame, whereas I poore I can doe nothing yet haue this rudely aduentured, there∣by to shewe what zeale I haue to such honourable mindes as your selfe, that in your absence by these fewe lines pub∣lished you may be remembred when you shall be absent in this your honourable voyage, and the rather haue I vnder∣taken this because I neuer sawe any to bid you farewell from Englande, and partly for countries cause being borne in Deuonshire where your worship was, these causes good Syr considered, first that by my simple writing it may en∣courage

others to write that can doe farre better, and then the zeale I beare to my countrey, and to all such as ven∣ture for the common weale, I hope your Worshippe will pardon the rudenesse of the writer, who wisheth hartely your welfare and prosperous successe in all your worthye enterprises, and daily shall beséeche God to make you as fortunate as Alexander, and in all your voyage to shielde you from your enemies, as he did the Prophet Dauid from the handes of King Saul which persecuted him, and sende you a happy returne from this your pretended voyage and many ioyfull yeeres to liue here amongest vs, and when it shall please God after you haue spent here many happye dayes on the earth with much worshippe and increase of al worldly felicity and that you must pay your due to death by nature, you may happely arriue to that port of all ioye to rest with God in heauen where Christ is chiefe Pilate.
