MOst Reuerend Father,
my singular good and
gracious Lorde: In all
humble dutie I do offer
to your grace this poor
and slender present, in auspicium nas∣centis
anni, which I doe most hartely
pray, may bee as happie and prospe∣rous
both for your health and quiet



gouernement, as (thanks be to God)
your latter yeares haue beene. It is a
description of a certaine Region or
Kingdome in Africa, called Congo,
whose name is as yet scarce knowen
to our quarters of Europe, neyther is
there any great or solemne mention
of it in any bookes that haue beene
published of that Third parte of the
old World. And because this treatise
doeth comprehend not onely the na∣ture
and disposition of the Moci-Conghi,
which are the naturall inha∣bitantes
and people of Congo, toge∣ther
with all the commodities and
trafficke of that Countrey, very fitte
and pleasaunt to be reade, but also the
religion which they professed, and
by what meanes it pleased God to
draw them from Paganisme to Chri∣stianity:

I thought good thus to make
it knowen to my countreymen of
England, to the end it might be a pre∣sident
for such valiant English, as do
earnestly thirst and desire to atchieue
the conquest of rude and barbarous
Nations, that they doo not attempt
those actions for commodity of Gold
and Siluer, and for other transitorie
or worldly respectes, but that they
woulde first seeke the Kingdome of
God, & the saluation of many thou∣sand
soules, which the common ene∣mie
of mankinde still detayneth in
ignorance: and then all other thinges
shall be put in their mouthes aboun∣dantly,
as may bee seene by the Por∣tingalles
in this narration. Written it
was by one Philippo Pigafetta, an Ita∣lian,
and a very good Mathematici∣an,



from the mouth of one Lopez a
Portingal, together with two maps,
the one particular of Congo, the other
generall of all Africa, and especially
of the Westerne Coast, from 34. de∣grees
beyond the Aequinoctial north∣wardes,
downe along to the Cape of
Good-Hope in the South, and so vp∣wardes
againe on the Easterne Coast
by the great Island of Madagascar, o∣therwise
called the Isle of S. Laurence,
til you come to the Isle of Socotora, &
then to the Redde Sea, and from Ae∣gypt
into the Inland Southwards to the
Empire of Presbiter-Iohn. I beseech
your grace to accept of this my poore
trauell, and I will not cease to pray to
Almightie God, according to my
dutie, that hee will multiply many
good years vpon you, vnder the hap∣py



gouernment of our most gracious
& soueraigne Lady Queene Eliza∣beth:
wherevnto the Church of Eng∣lande
is bound to say, Amen. From
your Graces house in Lambehith,
the first of Ianuarie. 1597.
