A Great Pretender to History tells us, That Ann Bulleyn had an Ill Shape, a Yellow Colour, a Gag Tooth, and a Lump under the Chin; but had withal a most Delicious Wit, a Graceful Meen, an Obliging Air, and Good Humour: Now, altho' this may seem but an indifferent Picture to gross and vulgar Discerners, yet it will pass for a Beauty in a true Platonical sense; since internal Comeliness supplies all other Defects. Accordingly the lesser Irregula∣rities of your Frame can be no matter of Reproach, since your Intelle∣ctual Graces are so conspicuous to the World. Your Soul in her narrow Lodging (like an honest Dear Friend in a little homely Tenement) is unaccountably entertaining: And your Wit and Perfections may justly put Mankind to the blush, as they do me to a stand, when I consider my Insufficiency to describe them.
I hope, Madam, You will never fail to bear witness before the World, that I have ever been a just (though not blind) Admirer of the good Ones, or (which I hope is all one) the greater part of your Sex: I hate the poynted and licentious Lampoons, that seem levell'd at Wo∣mankind without any sort of distinction; and which look more like the Rudeness of Porters, than the just Raillery of a Gentleman: To rake into the Wounds, or expose the Frailties of Ladies, is barbarous and inhumane; and for a Man (because he is of a dull and earthy Comple∣ction, or has been cast off by his Mistress for want of agreeable Merit) to rail at the Sex, or blast a Woman of Honour, is abusive and lamen∣table Cant, and deserves a greater Castigation than that of the Pen. I know, they that are studiously wicked, or vicious upon Principle, are
commonly most severe upon the little Frailties of those, that are design∣edly vertuous, and generous in their Aims, but want a uicer Regulation of themselves: And how easie is it for any despicable Wretch (that has but an invincible Forehead) to snicker or shake the Head over the little Lapses or Misfortunes of their Betters; and with a solemn Nod, or decorous Management of Fact, to pity Persons of Worth and Re∣putation.
My Design therefore, in the following Essays, is not in the least to fully the Glories of the Sex, (for why should the sweet Nightingales and innocent Turtles suffer with the obscene Birds?) but to make an agreeable and just Discrimination; and to contribute a little towards the Easiness of Humane Life, the Peace of Families, and generous Freedom and Gaity of Conversation. I do freely own, that Woman, while she glitters in her native Innocence and Charms, is the Fair side of Nature, and prettiest brightest Ornament of the Creation: She is more wellcome than the Morn, more beauteous than the Spring, and more refreshing than the Light: And yet if she Degenerates into an Habitual Exercise of Black and Ill natur'd Passions, (for ashort Fit may be useful and becoming,) she presently falls from her Soveraignty and Graces, loses all her Charms, and the foulest Vizor a Poet can contrive will rather mend, than heighten her Deformity.
The following Lectures were at first hastily composed, for the satis∣faction of some private Friends; and are now Published at the earnest desire of some of your Admirers, who are Persons well affected to your Sex: Whether I have transgress'd the Limits of true Decorum, I leave to you Impartially to determine. With all Submission and Gra∣titude I own your Endearing Favours and Charitable Smiles: And do here lay my self as well as the Hopeless Lausania at your Feet. I am,
