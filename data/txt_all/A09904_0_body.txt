SVppose you see the Widdow with her Mite,
Debating, whether better to proceed,
And lay it downe in all the Peoples sight;
Or else, to put it vp againe with speed
Now shee resolues to doo't, And then shee feares
Th'acceptance of it, and the Peoples gieres:
At last, shee did conclude, and cast it in;
Then slinkt away, and hop'd shee was not seene.

Thus, with a very conscious cautious Eye,
Our Author weighs the Work which he presents;
Then viewes the Multitude that's standing by,
(Knowing too well their old accustom'd bent:)
And now, no sooner does behold your Selfe,
But layes it at your foot; and then by stealth
Auoids; and hopes, the Giuer is vnknowne:
Yet this small Gift speakes great affection.
