IN the opinion of the most Accurate, a Sermon once deliuered, goeth afterward to the Presse as to execution. And where-euer there is but an equall part of Plato's  in pronuntiation, Quintilians Rule will noLib. 11. cap. 3. question proue true; Ita quis{que} vt audit, movetur. But my ayme is alwayes more
 at the heart, than at the eare; and in my present Endeuours, my chiefe ambition is, to serue you, while you serue the Common-Good. That, by your command, is now in a dead Letter, which lately, by your suffe∣rance, liued in the mouth of the Speaker. Your fauour calling me to the Pulpit, made me truely feele my weakenes; And nothing but your Authority commanding me to the Presse, is able to sustaine it. The speedy ex∣ecution of your cōmaund, gaue me no time to perfect what in too little time I had con∣ceiued; how-euer, with me, to speake ho∣nestly, is to speake Eloquently. My soule professeth, I could willingly haue spent the whole labour of my life vpon so worthy an Assembly; to expresse the desire wher∣of, (by the encouragement of many of your owne Body) I shall speedily annexe to this, two other Sermons, the one against Bri∣bery, and the other against Selfe-Policy; both which, I will bee bold to call, The Character of mine owne heart toward the publike good of our Church and Common∣wealth. For this in particular, be pleased
 to accept what your selues haue comman∣ded, and fauour me with the liberty of this Apologie; Vt si quid peccatum siet, fe∣cissePlaut. me dicant de vostra sententia. We all blesse our selues in the contemplation of these times; for hauing such a God, such a King, such a Parliament: Quid non speremus amantes? The God of Blessing so dispose of your Councels, that you may keepe the spirit of vnity in the bond of Peace.
