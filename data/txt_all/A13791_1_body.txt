My Sonne,
I Commend the reading of this Poem vnto thee, that in it, thou mayst first see me what I am: and then learne what I wish thee to bee. Make not Poesie thy profession, but thy pleasure. Profit so gotten, is merce∣nary, and ends in basenesse. But if for thine own solace, thou sing to thy selfe the songs of the Muses, thou shalt find some Philomels will record to thy Dit∣tie. In thy Verse bee not wanton, but warie Loose Numbers, argue light af∣fections: and discretion is the Badge of Wisedome. Doe not Critically abuse,
 what thou canst not amend: neither flatteringly sublime, what thou seest to be vile. Be thy selfe: and bee con∣stant in thy selfe: but take heede that thou be seldome lesse, and neuer more then thy selfe. Humilitie is nei∣ther Base, nor Proud. Tis a Poeticall fault, to presume, and compare. If at any time thou doe so, let it bee with thine Equals. For Superiours wil crush thee, and Inferiours disgrace thee. Learne this, till I haue occasion to teach thee more. And so I leaue thee to Gods blessing.
