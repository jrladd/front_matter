SIR,
I Offer these Papers unto you, not to implore your Patro∣nage, but to acknowledge your Favours: Had my leasure, or abilities, quali∣fied me for a greater perfor∣mance, it had been tendered unto you with the same readiness: This venera∣tion I bear not to the Ranke you hold in the Church, or University, but to your Merit; and in you, I at once honour a Learning above this age, and a Piety becoming the best: Permit me to be just to so real worth, and grateful for your con∣stant civilities to me, and I shall no way Interest your Person in this Quarrel: 'Tis enough, that

I defend Truth, and the Church of England; and that whatever else I have atchieved, I inter∣medled with nothing but what 'twas necessary to be undertook by some body: This none can dis∣pute who understands the Politicks of our Nation, & upon what foundations the publick Tranquillity is suspended: Let them that will, question the prudence of this action, I am satisfied in the pro∣fession of a Wisdome that is first pure, and then peaceable. I am perfectly

Warwick,
Feb. 16. 1669.
