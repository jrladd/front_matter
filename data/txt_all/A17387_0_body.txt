THere are three things incite me, to Dedi∣cate this lit∣tle direction to your Lordship and my Lady:

The first is to testifi hereby vnto the world my vnfained estimation of those sauing grace and the true religion that dwels in you both The second is, to ex presse hereby my great desire to shew my thankefulnesse, for the many fauours I haue re∣ceiued, but especially for all the incouragements wherewith I haue beene refreshed in obseruing your loue to my Mini∣sterie,

aad care in your selues and your familie to shew the profit of it. The third is, because it pleased your Lordship and my Lady hereto∣fore, to desire and ac∣cept directions of this kinde from me, in wri∣ting.
I haue beene the wil∣linger to suffer this copy to come into publike view, because I haue beene vrged by many friends from diuers pla∣ces

of late, to giue them Directions of this kind: and I haue long obser∣ued that in the most places the godly that are vnlearned, are at a great want of a setled course herein. If it may please your Lordshippe and my Lady to afford this little worke, your acceptation and counte∣nance, I shall be richly satisfied. My hope is that the Lord that hath as it were called for it by

the request of many well disposed, will bee pleased to giue a bles∣sing to it: if any thing be now wanting, by the intimation of my friends, I may make fur∣ther supply in after Edi∣tions, if God will.
The Lord multiplie grace & ioy with righ∣teousnesse and peace in both your hearts and liues, and prolong with increase your Lordships honour and good suc∣cesse

in your militarie calling, in which you haue beene hitherto a speciall ornament to this Nation. I end and rest
