FOr as moch as Iesu christ vnto whome the children were offred / Math. xix. to thintent he shulde laye hys handes vppon them and praye / with a fauourable countenaū∣ce receauing the same / declared that he ca∣me to be a sauiour also of soche / because the very infauntes (as well as other of greater age) through the sinne of Adam / had nede of the grace of God / and the sa∣me being receaued of Christ / are made the Cytezens of the kingdome of heauen. these of iuste cause / are moost worthye prayse / that shewe the very nere and next waye / howe suche maye be trayned vnto Christe / that as yet haue not the parfect vse of reason / wherby fayth maye the more surely be graffed in them / withoute the whych it is impossyble to please God. For like as the shipmā that apointeth his iorney into forraine coūtreis / though his
 shyp be neuer so well tackled / or neuer so good of sayle / being without his compas∣se / wherby (in tēpestuous and darke stor∣mes / and in the longe and obscure nygh∣tes / he maye knowe vppon what coaste to decline) thinketh him self naked / euē so the yonge ād tender age / albeit it be neuer so well natured and indued with godly graces / yet of it selfe it is but naked / being without a guide declaring the right waie / and of nature more prone to vice than to vertue. Where therfore God hath geuen vnto you a Childe of great towardnes / furnisshed also with the giftes of nature as moche as maie be. Vnto whome (for your sake) I am bounde to owe my serui∣ce in all that I am able to do. I haue trās∣lated this litle boke / amōgest other for the same most necessary. That by him / the rest of the youth that customably is very gros¦ly brought vp / maye the better be brought to the knowledge of god / ād his holy wor∣de / ād be trayned in vertue / to the comfor∣te of their parētes / ād to their owne great commodite. Fare you well. From Ippes∣wich this xxviij of Ianuary. An. 1548.
