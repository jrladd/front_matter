VVHereas the Blessing is Ʋniversall, such ought the gratulation to be, upon which account, We in the place, as the principall Agent, give God the praise; and next as the happy Instrument to your Excellencie and your Army, for our present Liberty Redeemed, (not without much Colingta∣tion, and losse of precious bloud) from a long insolent, Ar∣bitrary, and oppressing Tyranny, and since one of the swee∣test flowres in the Chaplet of Liberty (made, as by your late Remonstrance it appeareth, the onely Garland of your many and wonderfull Victory) and is jus suffragii. We are incou∣raged to present, as our sence of our hoped approaching hap∣pinesse,
for our best conceptions and endeavours to compleat, and then conserve it.
And since to your Excellencie as Captain General of the Forces of all England, and the Dominions thereof, both Mi∣litias are united as well of the Sea as Land, then which an ampler expedient for publique, safety cannot be; It is hum∣bly desired between Army and Navy a happy correspond may be commenc't and maintayn'd, by meanes whereof all jea∣lousies and mis-apprehensions in both, or either, (Mauger the most close and subtile fomentations of all malignant Spirits) may be prevented, or soone annulled; And to this end, we shall humbly propose, that some Agent, or Agents, may be mutually and reciprocally in the behalfe of each, ta∣ken and received into each others Debates, Transactions, and Conclusions; that so upon all occasions, we may by undoub∣ted Intelligence, crave, and have mutuall assistance and be im∣powered unanimously to ingage against the Common E∣nemy.
And because they but vainely pretend health, who onely forifie againsl the Evils without, and not expell the peccant humours within; With a better providence, but confining it  our owne Sphere, humbly desire, that the dangerous practises, and abuses (of long time, and yet) acted, and suffered, in, and about the Navie, to the infinite disho∣nour and prejudice of the whole Nation; may in this happy Juncture of Reformation, speedily be taken into Con∣sideration and Redresse.
