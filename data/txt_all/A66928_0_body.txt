Royal Sir,
YOur MAJESTIES most Humble and faithful Loyal Subject, though one of the meanest and weakest of Your MAJESTIES Servants, do
 in all Humility, make bold to lay down at your Royal Feet these my Weak Labours, Humbly beseeching your Sacred MAJESTY to be Graciously pleased, of your accustomed Goodness, to take the same into your Pro∣tection; it being so Sacred a Subject, that properly the Dedication thereof belongs to no other, than to your Royal Self. And although by the Author it is done in Weak∣ness, yet the Matter is so powerfull, strong, and convincing, (being the express Words of the Prophets, and Apostles, Christ him∣self being the Chief Corner-Stone;) that, by your Majesties Gracious Acceptance, I shall not only be fortified against all, that either Malice or Envy can object against me, but likewise be Encouraged cheerfully to Pub∣lish the same, for the good and satisfaction of your Majesties Loyal and Loving Subjects, and (I hope) for the converting of those, who dares deny their Allegiance to so Gracious a King, and so pure a Government; I being confident, that after the perusal of this Book, there is no person that owns himself a Chri∣stian, although formerly never so much mis∣led, (without GOD has left him absolutely to a Reprobate sence, altogether for Damna∣tion)
 that will not own his errour, and be heartily sorry, that ever he was of a rebelli∣ous principle, and earnestly beg GOD's and your Majesties pardon. So humbly begging your Majesties Gracious Pardon for this my presumption, I make bold to conclude with the sayings of the Servants of King David, to their Lord the King, at the Anointing of their Lord King Solomon, (only altering the names) As the Lord hath been with My Lord KING CHARLES II. even so be He with His Royal Majesty KING JAMES II. and make your Throne greater than the Throne of My Lord KING CHARLES. And let all your Ma∣jesties Loyal and Loving Subjects say A∣men, Amen, which is, and ever shall be the hearty Prayer of,
DREAD SOVERAIGN,
