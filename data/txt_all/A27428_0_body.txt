Most Honoured,
GOD having disposed the Heart of that incomparable Person, the Honourable Ro∣bert Boyle, Esquire, lately deceased, the Glory of our Nation and Age, whose Charity and Goodness were as universal as his Learning and Fame; To settle an Annual Salary for some Divine or Preaching Minister, who shall be enjoyned to perform the Offices following: 1. To preach Eight Sermons in the Year, for proving the Christian Religion against notori∣ous Infidels, viz. Atheists, Deists, Pagans, Iews and Mahometans; not descending to any Con∣troversies

that are among Christians them∣selves: These Lectures to be on the First Mon∣day of the respective Months of Ianuary, Fe∣bruary, March, April, May, September, October, November; in such Church as the Trustees shall from time to time appoint: 2. To be assisting to all Companies, and encouraging them in any Undertaking for propagating the Christian Religion: 3. To be ready to satis∣fie such Real Scruples as any may have con∣cerning those Matters; and to answer such New Objections or Difficulties as may be started, to which good Answers have not yet been made: You have been pleased to believe me able in some measure to perform these Offices, and to command this First Essay to be made publick. I am very sensible of the great Honour, as well as the great Extent and Difficulty of the Task; and shall endeavour to the utmost of my poor ability to answer the religious and generous Design of that Excellent Person, and the good Opinion you have entertained of,
My most Honoured Patrons,

March 17. 1691/2.
