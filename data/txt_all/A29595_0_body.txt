DREAD SIR,
SInce Heaven your Righteous Cause has own'd,
And with Success Your powerful Navy crown'd;
Silence were now an injury as rude,
As the proud Hollanders Ingratitude:
While th' Glories of your Arms, and Triumphs shine,
Not to Congratulate were to Repine.

Your Enemies themselves to Greatness raise,
By disingenious, and inglorious ways;
By means, no Vulgar Spirit would endure,
But such as either Courage want, or Power.
But while your Clemency proclaims aloud
Compassion to the miserable Croud:
Your Royal Breast with Love, not Anger, burns,
And Your resentment into Pity turns
In Christian Gallantry You Your self out-doe,
And Honour by the Noblest Arts pursue.
