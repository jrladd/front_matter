Noble Ladies,
IT is a true saying of the wise Solomon, Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it. The first part of this, was made out by your gracious and noble Mother of blessed memory;
 who trained you up from your Child-hood in the holy Scrip∣tures, and in the fear of the Lord, as also in all vertue be∣seeming your Quality and Sex; whereof I have had the honour and happiness to be a witness for many years. I know it is a Christian duty, in the due time to make honourable mention of the vertues of the deceased Saints, to the end these who survive them, may in a godly emulation follow their good example. Your Noble Mo∣ther, was like to Annah in her privat and publick De∣votions;
 like to Dorcas in her Christian compassion and sup∣ply to the necessitous; like to Sarah in her dutiful deport∣ment toward her Noble Lord your Father; and like to Eu∣nice, in the Christian and ten∣der education of her Children. The other part of that Golden Sentence, ye your selves en∣deavour, through Gods grace to make good; by resembling her in her Graces and Vertues; and by transmitting the same in your careful education of these hopeful young Ladies,
 happy in your example and breeding.
The like great obligation of Gratitude, that strongly inclin∣ed me to dedicat a Book to your gracious Mother, hath also prompted me to present this small Treatise unto your La∣diships, and to honour the same by prefixing your Names thereto. The main subject and design of both Books is the same: In the first, were some refreshing streams flow∣ing forth from the fountain opened to the house of David, for refreshing weary and thir∣sty
 souls; and in this, is held forth the Righteous BRANCH, even the blessed Lord Jesus Christ also, for the reviving of fainting souls, by the sweet savour of his grace and power, to convert and save lost man.
It is not in such a dress, as will please the fancy of some others; but I know well, if the stuff be upright and solid, your sober minds can easily dispense with the want of em∣broideries of Humane Elo∣quence: That it may be pro∣fitable to your Ladyships, and to all who shall be pleased to
 peruse the same, is the humble prayer of him, who is in all duty,
Noble Ladies,
