THis little Peece was never in∣tended for publick view, only to discharge my duty at the late erected Exercise at Thomas Apostles, where I not long since, by the providence of God, in the desires of my fel∣low laborers in the Vineyard, was called to work. I did not in my preparatory medita∣tions consult with flesh and blood, what might gain me esteem with that Audito∣ry; what doctrine might probably be most taking, and suit best with the dispositions of the people: but laying aside all by-re∣spects, which to the praise of grace be it spoken, I was resolved to deliver what my own spirit was convinced of for a truth, and was most agreeable to this tottering and declining age. It pleased God to fix my unsetled thoughts amongst the varie∣ties
of Texts, upon that place of Scripture Rev. 1 2.4. I was not disobedient to this heavenly suggestion, however I was not then ignorant, how some, whose tempers I very well understand, would disgust and disrellish that matter, the words of∣fered to be spoken to; yet this I can say, but one I ever heard of was dissatisfied in, and dissented from, what was laid down, ei∣ther as contrary to the Analogy of Faith, or the true sense and meaning of Christ in the Vision I shall leave it to the spirituall man, who judgeth all things, to examine this little Treatise; I refuse to put my self upon the tryal of those, who whilest they boult out their own opinions with such confidence, as Authentic all, they are guil∣ty of that which themselves cry down, a Papall infallibility. To wave what I could say for my self, concerning the releasing of this poor Prisoner at the Barre, and gi∣ving him liberty to wander at large, (though I know the modesty of some, with the dissimulations and flatteries of others, have brought Apologies into fashion,) I shall address my self to you, with whom, according to the weak gifts in me, I have for a Twelve moneth laid open the unsear∣chable riches of Christ, and I must needs
say, both my Person and Ministry hath been entertained with the love and respect of divers, more than could be expected by one comming in upon such disadvantage as my self; it will adde much to my engage∣ments, if you will but give shelter to this poor Pilgrim of mine, now upon travell; I cannot tell, but that by reason of storms it may be necessitated to house somewhere, I beseech you think never the worse of it, because it visits you in a homely dresse, like that plain mind from whence it went out, voyd of all ornaments and ac∣commodations which may set it out and commend it. My confidence is, however some in these curious times may censure and judge of me, yet you will accept of my Endeavours, as a standing pledge and to∣ken of that love and service I now doe, and hope ever shall bear unto you in the Gospel. Out of inward bowels, I pray that may never happen to you, which did to these Starres (being indeed nothing but transitory impressions in the Air) For this Cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that your light may alwaies shine before men, that no wiles of the Dragon may so far prevail as to cast you down from your
good beginnings. I know not what better to wish you (which is my hearts desire) that you may be saved; and because ho∣linesse is the way to happinesse, I pray God keep you pure and unspotted, that so when Christ, who is your life, shall appear, you may then appear with him in Glory. Now to him who is able to strengthen and establish you, I commend you, and rest,
