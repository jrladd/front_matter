HONORABLE Syr, hauing latelie trans∣lated this little vo∣lume out of Spanish into English, I began to thinke, to vvhat person of our nation I might dedicate the same, that not onelie vvould gratefullie accept of so small a trauail, but also vvere able to iudge, as vvel of the transla∣tion, as also of the fruite vvhich maie be deriued to such, as shall list to reade it. At the length a∣mongst
all others, your hono∣rable person seemed to me most fitte, for all the respects before mentioned. For if I regard your courtisie to all sortes of men, and your speciall good vvill and affe∣ction to those of mic coate in ge∣nerall (to saie nothing of mie self in particular;) I maie vvith greate reason be esteemed verie vndis∣creete, if I should think, that you vvould take this poore offer other∣vvise, then your Nobilitie and courtisie requireth. Also if I con∣sider either your knovvledge in both languages English and Spa∣nish, or youre experience, and vvounderful good affection to all sortes of spirituall, and Godlie Trea∣tises, ioined vvith your Deuotion,
Pietie and Zeale in the seruice of God; I can not but esteeme you to be a sufficient Iudge as vvell of the translation, as also of the profit, that manie maie take by this little vvoorke. Accept then, Honorable good Syr, the same, as the first frutes, & token of mie good vvill tovvards you; accept it, I saie, vntill I haue put som other thing in or∣der, vvhich maie further the spi∣rituall auancement of deuoute per∣sons, & be more vvorth your rea∣ding; and accept therevvithall mie sincere affection, vvholie addicted to praie for your long life, and prosperitie, vvhich God graunt you, and preserue the same to his greater honour and glorie, and to your ovvne saluation and best
contentment. Christ IESVS be alvvaies in your safegard.
