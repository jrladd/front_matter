Parue, nec inuideo, sine me Liber ibis in Aulam,
FOr as Tanais goes vn∣der Meotis, and Al∣phaeus vnder the Sea, yet neither is the one bitter, nor the other salt: So  doubt not but that those vul∣gar
 imputations, which the mlecon∣ents cast vpon the Court, shall neuer attaint nor arrest your heroycke spirit, which as it hath vouchsafed to shine vpon me with gracious aspect (for com∣monly true Nobilitie and Humilitie, are like Hippocrates twinnes:) So hath it in forst me to eleuate my selfe a∣boue the Orbe of my actiuitie, and with the Eagle to lay my Egges in the lap of loue: These I most humbly commend to your powerfull loue. I could wish some Castor or Pollux were with∣in the shell, and if it please you, with the influence of your Sphere, to gene∣rate some Celestiall heate in them, I hope the yong ones, if they proue singing Birds, will learne to sing the Song of gratitude to your munificence, if they be Birds of pray, I will charge them to fol∣low
 your game. If they be fowles, De∣dicate to Ruc the god of Hungarie, I will desire no more, but that they may please your palate: most humbly I de∣sire your Worship, not to breake them, for they are not the eggs of a Cocatrice: trie the successe, my desire is, that they may proue Cockes of the game. Domi∣tian set vp a prize for Poetrie, which he kept euery fift yeare, and had his cruelty beene as little, as his wit was great, hee would haue beene as much commended for this, as hee was con∣demned for other actions: but I trust I shall finde you tobelike his Brother Titus, in whosegreatnesse nothing was vnpleasant, but the shortnesse: Now therfore as Perseus defended himselfe vnder the buckler of Pallace, and Teucer vnder that of Aiax: so I leaue
 mine orphant Muse to the ingenu ti of your Honourable nature, and the Patronage of your deser∣ued greatnesse.
