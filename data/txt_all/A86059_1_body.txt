GENTLEMEN!
YOu need not wonder at the sight, or subject of this small Tractate; for it drives at nothing but the Salvage of Astrologers Ho∣nour and Credit, and your own Reputati∣on. If you would know why I oppose Mr. Lilly, (who pretends himself the onely Ma∣ster of Astrologie) it is because he hath op∣posed his Art, and turned his back upon the truth thereof. Had he been true to the Sci∣ence, unto which he so largely pretends, I had forborn this pains, and prevented your trou∣ble of perusal: But he appearing so re∣pugnant (as I have shewed) to his Art in every thing he writes, hath not onely made Shipwrack of his own Repute, but [like a pro∣digious Prodigal] lays the Honour of A∣strologie, and your selves (also) in the dust. For what person is he, that can be brought to believe there is life and moisture remai∣ning in the smaller Trees, when the [pre∣tended] Cedar is dry and sapless?

I well hoped that some of you (more able) would have eased me of this task, and un∣mask'd this Arch Pretender before now. But since his Errors are so eminently spread and promoted, to the great scandal of Astro∣logie, and hitherto no one hath offered to que∣stion him — I adjudged it convenient (in recompence of his scurrilities) to stop his course at this time, lest in the height of his folly, he surfeit more dangerously, and run mad beyond the cure of all probable Rea∣son.
If, for this my pains, I am not requited with a Trepan, I shall not need to fear the force of my Antagonists Pen; being con∣scious to my self, I have not mis-represented him in a syllable. However, if he judge him∣self injured, or find himself troubled at any thing in this Discourse, let him, rationally, (not railingly) acquit himself from those Errors charged upon him; or else by his silence, acknowledge himself as great an Impostor, as this Treatise pronounces him; that so the world may be undeceived, and the Honour of Your Selves and Art, preser∣ved.
Vale.
