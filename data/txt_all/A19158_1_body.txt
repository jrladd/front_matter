MAdam, may I presume without offence
Vpon your Highnesse fauour, to dispence
With this my rude Composure, What I haue
I giue, and more ther's no man euer gaue,
Being the first piece ventur'd on the Stage
Since you were ours, To craue your Patronage,
You cannot with your Honour choose but giue
It harbour, and a libertie to liue
For its owne merit (rightly vnderstood)
Let Enuic censure whether it be good.
What wants he that enioyeth all, the wise
Philosopher demands, Then thus replies
Some one to tell him truth, which want I haue
Suppli'd, and humbly your free pardon craue.
All men will flatter my vnpractiz'd youth
In that hath ventur'd to shake hands with truth,
Which neuer shames the Master. Water these
Young Plants in time they may grow goodly Trees.
Liue long the Glorie of your Royall Stem,
Heau'n crowne with an immortall Diadem.
