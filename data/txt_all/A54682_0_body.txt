My Lord,
THE Holy Evangelist St. Luke in his Gospel and History of the Acts of the blessed Apostles, when he inscribed or Dedicated it to his friend Theophilus, hath given us to understand that the Dedication of Books unto such as would

read and peruse them is no late or Novel usage; for it was in those times, or shortly after, not thought to be unfitting or unne∣cessary to take the approbation and opini∣on of Grave and Learned men, of such things as were to be made publicke, as Plinius Junior in his Epistles informs us so that it may with reason and evidence be concluded that the Dedication of Books was not originally to procure the favor of some great or good Man, neither were the Epistles Dedicatory heretofore acquain∣ted with those gross Flatteries, untruths, or immense and accumulated praises of the Patrons or their Ancestors, which some Foraign Printers for their own pri∣vate gain, do use in publishing Books out of some Copies and Manuscripts left by the deceased Authors, or as too many German and other Authors have of late stuffed their Dedications withall, which

Heroick and great Souls do so little re∣lish, as the Books themselves would meet with a better entertainment if they came without them; but one of the best and most approved usages of Dedications, hath certainly and most commonly been derived from no other Source or Foun∣tain, then the great desire which the Au∣thor had (there being before printing most probably but a few Copies sent abroad) to receive the friendly censure and appro∣bation of some Learned man, who would in those days carefully read and peruse it; and not as now too many men do oscitanter and cursorily take a view onely of the Frontispice or Title, and lay it in the Parlor or Hall Windows to be idly turned over by such as tarry to speak with them, or else crowd it in their better furnished then read or understood Libraries, to make a Muster or great

shew of such Forces as they have to bring into the Feild of Learning when there shall be any occasion to use them, but neither then or before are able to finde or say what is in them.
But your Lordship being Master of the Learning in Books as well as of an excellent well furnished Library, with many choice Manuscripts never yet published, and very many Classick Authors and Volums printed and care∣fully pick't and gathered together out of the Gardens of good letters, which an unlearned and reforming Rebellion, and the Treachery of a wicked servant hired to discover them, did very much diminish.
And your Eye and Judgement being able before hand to Calculate the Fate of the Author in the good or bad opinion

of all that go by any Rules or measure of right Reason, Learning or Judgement. I have adventured to present unto your Lordship these my Labours in the Vin∣dication of the Legality, Antiquity, right use and necessity of the Prae∣emption and Pourveyance of the Kings of England, or Compositions for the Provisions of their Royall houshold, for that your Lordship is so well able to judge of them, and having been Comptroller of the houshold to his Majesties Royal Father the Martyr, King CHARLES the First, and to the very great dangers of your person, and damage of your Estate, like one of Davids good servants gone along with him in all his Wars and troubles, when as he being first assaul∣ted, was inforced to take Arms a∣gainst a Rebellious and Hypocritical

part of his people in the defence of him∣self and his people, their Religion, Laws, and Liberties, and the Privi∣ledges of Parliament, and not only re∣mained Faithfull to him, during his life, but after his death unto his banished and strangely misused Royal Issue, when Loyalty and Truth were accompted crimes of the greatest magnitude, and like some houses infected with the plague, had more then one ✚ set upon them with a Lord have mercy upon us.
And did whilst that blessed King continued in his Throne and Regalities, so instruct your self in those Excellent Orders and Government of his house, as you have been able to enlighten and teach others, amongst whom I must acknowledge my self to have been one, and out of a Manuscript carefully

collected by your Lordship concerning the Rules and Orders of the Royal houshold, which your Lordship was pleased to com∣municate unto me to have been very much informed, which together with the ma∣ny favors with which you have been pleased to oblige me, the incourage∣ments which you have given me to under∣take this work, and the great respect and veneration which I bear unto your Lordships grand accomplishments in the Encyclopaidia, large extent and tra∣verses of all kinde of learning, and your knowledge of Foraign Courts and Cu∣stomes, which being very extraordina∣ry, if you were of the ranke of private men must needs be very much more when it shall be added to the eminency of your Birth and qualitie, and the Trust and Emploiments which his Majesty hath been pleased deservedly to confer upon

you, have emboldened me to lay these my endeavors before your Lordship, sub∣mitting them to an utter oblivion and ex∣tinguishment, and to be stifled in the Birth or Crdle, if they shall not appear unto your Lordship to be worthy the pub∣like view and consideration.
Wherein although some may feast and highly content their Fancies with censur∣ing me, that I have been to prodigal of my labors in proving either at all or so larg∣ly the antiquity or legality of the Kings just Rights unto Prae-emption and Pourveyance or Compositions for them, when as the Act of Parliament in An∣no 12▪ of his now Majesties raign, for taking them away doth give him a Re∣compence for them; yet I may, I hope escape the censure or blame of setting up a Giant of Straw, and fighting with it when I have done▪ or of being alli∣ed

to such as fight with their own sha∣dows, or trouble themselves when there is neither any cause or necessity for it, when as the Act of Parliament for taking away Pourveyance and the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Tenures by Knight Service, either of the King or others in Capite, or Socage in Capite did not expressely alleage or allow those Tenures and the incidents thereof to be their just rights, but onely that the consequences upon the same have been much more burthensom, griev∣ous and prejudicial to the Kingdom, then they have been beneficial to the King; and alleadging also that by like experience it hath been found that notwithstanding divers good, strickt and wholsom Laws, some ex∣tending as far as to life for redress of the grievances and oppressions com∣mitted

by the persons imployed in making provisions for the Kings houshold, and of the Carriages and other provisions for his occasions, yet they have been still continued, and se∣veral Counties have submitted them∣selves to sundry rates, Taxes, and Compositions to redeem themselves from such vexations and oppressions, and that no other remedy will be so effectual as to take away the occasion thereof, especially if satisfaction and recompence shall be therefore made to his Majesty his heirs and Suc∣cessors, so as very many or most of the seduced and factious part of the people of this Nation having in the times of our late confusions been mislead or driven into an ill opinion of it, may with the residue of the people be ea∣sily carryed along with the croud to a

more then imagination, that the Pour∣veyance and Prae-emption, was no less then a very great grievance, and that his Majesty was thereby induced to accept of a recompence or satisfaction for it, and permit the people to pur∣chase the abolition of that which they supposed to have been a grievance, which do appear neither to be a griev∣ance nor recompence, but a great loss to the King, and as much or more in the conclusion consideratis considerandis to the people.
And that the vulgar, and men of pre∣judice and ignorance are not so easily, or with a little to be satisfied as the learned, and that in justification of a business from those Obloquies so unjustly and un∣deservedly cast upon it, and so highly concerning the King and his people, and in a way nullius ante trita pede, alto∣gether

untroden (wherein I cannot ho∣nor and obey the King as I ought, if I should not take a care of the rights of his people which is his daily care, nor love them or my self, if I should not do all that I can to preserve his regalities) I can be conscious to my self of many omissions and imperfections, in regard of sundry importunities of Clients affairs & some troublsome business of mine own which either could not or would not give me any competency of time or leasure, but did almost daily, and many times hourely take me off as soon as I was on, and so interrupt and divert me, as I had sometimes much ado when I got to it again, to recollect my scattered thoughts and materials, and Writing as the Printer called for it, with so great a disturbance and a midst so many obstru∣ctions, may possibly be guilty of some de∣formities

in the method or stile, some defects or redundancies, impertinent Sal∣lies or digressions, or want of coheren∣cies which might have been prevented or amended, if I could have enjoyed an Otium or privacy requisite for such an undertaking, or have had time to have searched the Archives, and too much unknown or uninquired after Records of the Kings just & legal Regalias, or those multitudes of liberties, customs, and priviledges which the Lords of Man∣nors and their Tenants do at this day en∣joy by the favour of the King and his royal Progenitors, or to have raked a∣mongst the rubbidge of time long ago tripped over, and the not every where to be found Abdita rerum, or recesses of venerable Antiquity, or to have viewed all at once what I had done in its parts

and delineations, and perused it be∣fore it was printed in a compleat Copy with a deliberation necessary to a work of that nature and concernment.
But howsoever I speed therein I shall like those that brought the Pigeons or Turtle Doves instead of a more noble sacrifice, content my self libâsse veritati, to have offered upon the Altar of truth, what my small abilities and greater af∣fections could procure whereby to have incited such as shall be more happy in their larger Talents to assert those truths which I was so willing to have vindica∣ted, and to have rectified that grand and popular groundless mistake and prejudice, which multitudes of the com∣mon people have by the late Vsurping Powers been cunningly taught to have against it; And whether they intended

evil or good thereby, might be easily mis∣led or mislead themselves to scandalize such an Ancient, Legal, and reason∣able custome, and Right of the King, when (as the great Civilian Paulus saith) Rerum imperiti cen∣suram sibi de rebus quibusdam ar∣rogant & volentes esse Legis Do∣ctores nesciunt de quibus loquun∣tur nec de quibus affirmant am∣bitiosè pervicaciter insolenter in∣eptè de magnis rebus statuere: And it was but a trick of the godless Tyrant and his company of State Gipsies to make the people the more able or willing to covenant and ingage for the mainte∣nance and perpetuity of their Sin and Slaverie, and to bear and suffer grea∣ter burdens, taxes, and oppressions then ever Englishmen did before:

And whatsoever the Fate of these my labors shall appear to be, can con∣clude in magnis voluisse sat est, and subscribe my self
