IF that saying of Plato (right noble Lorde) be true, that our Countrey challengeth an especiall interest in our very vttermost abi∣litie, which any way may tend to profit & be∣nefite the same: then will it sufficiently coun∣tenaunce the poore receiued Talent of myne, in that being so strictly charged by so great and graue a Phylosopher, I ought not to burie in obliuion my knowledge whatsoeuer, but rather as freely bestow mine endeuour on her, as shee did franckly impart the light thereof to me.
For though it be a common phrase in the mouthes of men altoge∣ther ignorant in the precious value and profite of Sciences: That the studie of Letters is a bottomlesse Gulfe, and so long and so vneasie a iourney, that they which rashly thinke to finish it, oftentimes are drowned in the mid∣way, and so vnder this pretence, account it better not to know much, yea, no∣thing at all: Against such slothful suggesters of men in a deadly obscu∣ritie while they lyue, let mee auouch that saying of Aristotle, Man (sayth he) was created to vnderstande and to doe, for knowledge begetteth iudgement, and by iudgement men execute all good and vertuous actions.
O Science (sayth Plato) howe would men loue thee, if they did but knowe thee? for euen as health is the conseruation of the body, so is knowledge the sure and onely safe-garder of the soule. And Cicero beeing of the same o∣pinion, sayth: O knowledge, the guide of our life, the onely cause of vertue, and enemie to vice: What is the life of man without thee?
If then (right learned Lord) such a maine & current streame of vn∣conquerable reason, washeth to nothing the emptie and confused wits, of such as are enemies to the excellencie of Arte, and maketh most fertile (like the ouer-flowings of Nylus) the iudgements of thē that are gouerned thereby: (though farre from me be the thought of arrogating the very least tytle of Arte to my selfe, yet as one that de∣sires

to receiue the breath of life from her sacred dwelling, and holdes with the learned in all ages, that man is as a bruite beast without her:) then let me thus farre presume vnder your noble fauour, to shewe that I haue not altogether trewanted in my life time, but howe I haue be∣stowed those permitted howers of exercise, that more waighty affaires in the world affoorded me, both to declare my reuerende zeale to so high a misterie, and vnfeyned affection. I beare to your honor.
The worke was first written in French, by an excellent Scholler, Oger Ferrier, a Physition, borne in Tolouze, & dedicated to Queene Katherine of Fraunce, mother to the King that last deceassed. And bee∣ing now by me changed into an English habite, that it might receiue no indignitie by dedication, I haue stampt your noble name in the fore-head thereof, that it may bee sayde (in despight of the proudest carper or controller,) Thys is the God-chylde of a peerelesse God-father.
And as I doubt not of your honourable acceptauce, so I am like∣wise perswaded, that what hath wanted on my behalfe in translation, or any other imperfection beside, shall be as nobly censured: in which resolution I humbly kisse your hand, and continue as forward in affection, as any to your Honours welfare.
