Right Honourable;
THis pains which another call'd to the Pulpit, your Honour hath commanded to the Press: I would hope but to a second Im∣pression of it, the first being in your own and others hearts. Your attention spake your affe∣ction to it in the preaching: your judgment of it (so much above mine own) will be Apologie sufficient for the Printing (in this almost as much Printing as Scribling

age:) and your Authority commanding it the Prss, hath even therein engag'd for the Patronage of it printed. I promise my self also the third Impression in the whole course of Judicature, at the stern whereof your Honour sits Lord Chief Justice, hearing (and I am perswaded deservedly) The best Book-man of the Nation, and knownly no less exquisitely able in the disquisition of a Cause, then in the knowledg of the Rule: Now if your Honour either already did not, or did not still resolve with this, either Ability to answer your Trust, and make good your Style, you would not have desir'd the light of this Sermon also to stare you in the face.
Nor may this Sermon have its use onely with your Lordship in this your so Honourable Publick station, but more especially in your private Christian capcity, as your Remembraner, in all, often to lay your self to the line of that Law of Liberty, by which Publick Judges, as well as private Christians must be judg'd. That the Lord would follow it with his Blessing, both Preach'd and Print∣ed, to some measure of usefullness, both to your Honour and others, is the prayer of
Right Honourable,
