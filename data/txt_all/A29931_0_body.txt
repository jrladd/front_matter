COURTEOUS READER,
(FOr, with the present unto∣ward
Generation, I have not
yet so far forfeited my chari∣ty,
but that I shall still proclaim thee
or such, as far as the infirm legs of
these cripled lines shall carry them,
until thou shall appear signally to de∣serve
the contrary) we are faln up∣on
an Age (thou canst not but be ten∣derly
sensible) wherein, not onely
those Courtly spirits, that are exqui∣site
Gleekers, or Cribbagers; but e∣ven
every Country Bumkin, that can
but play at plain Trump, or Noddy,
cannot but clealy discern the Knave
every day to turn; and appear in his

orient colours; yea in value to ouvy,
not the King onely, the supreme Ma∣gistrate;
but all that is called God. And
then the less strange may it seem to ob∣serve,
not onely that all Kingly Autho∣rity
is laid aside; but that all manner
exercise of the Priestly function is sus∣pended,
amongst us. So that now, not
onely those his immediate Vicegerents
ae grown strangers to their Princely
thrones; but we his voices, become
hoarse, not with clamour so much as
silence; yea our Tongues with stand∣ing
still so long within the stables of our
Mouths, no better then resty; yea, as
by the hearing of an Hiena's voice,
stuck dumb; no marvel if we be dri∣ven
(I say not with Zachary, in saced
page so much to call for writingTa∣bles,
as) with Io in the Poet, having
our Hands and Tongues; at least our
Tongues, which should serve us as
Hands, for the holding of the Pens of

ready Writers, cut off; and so by con∣sequence
our Teeth knocked out, to
try the extremest of conclusions of ma∣king
our Feet our Minds interpreters.
And so, as they put us upon the exi∣gence
of leading Poetical lives; so en∣force
they our Lines to tread the mea∣sures
of Poetick feet. Nay, the more
surely to muzzle the mouths of us,
that are the Analogical oxen, for the
bearing of the Ark, deny us utterly the
use of these very feet of ours, where∣with
we ought to tread out the spiritu∣al
grain of the Word. Nay, now at
lst, when, posibly, with the improve∣ments
of our utmost skil, and industry,
we may have arrived to some good
measure of perfection in the New, and
untroden, Path of Pedography▪ even in
these very feet of ours, by the good
Angels of our Times (as Iacob by the
Angel in his Thigh) are we rendred so
lame, that by them we are denied all

manner License of giving out the sad
Print of our, though never so pressing
necessity. That Liberty, under the no∣tion
of Begging Schollers, and other
vagrants, is (I know not by what law)
interdicted us. However, when for
these things sake, our souls at times
cannot forbear weeping in secret pla∣ces,
or my particular Relation to thee;
since my address speaketh mee so cha∣ritable
towards thee, thou shalt give
me leave to minde thee, that even in ci∣vility
as well as conscience, thou art
bound to do me so much justice, as that
what ever it be, that I shall offer thee
with the Right Hand, thou be far from
receiving, much more rending, with the
Let. Which right shalt thou do me,
thou shalt still encourage me to go on
to be, what yet no discouragement
shall ever take me ff from being
.
