SIR,
I Never thought my selfe wor∣thy to be the Author of any thing fit for the Presse, and but that your request, with some others of your Family hath the force of an absolute command, with me, I should rather have suppressed this, then Published it; for I must confesse, if ever I was unfit to bring forth any thing for all the world to looke on, it was at this time, when I was so overwhelmed with astonishment,
 and griefe for the Death of your dear Fa∣ther, that I was not likely to come at any thing fit for so great a Service, in the midst of such a deale of lumber and confusion of thoughts as then was with me. I never thought jingling wit proper for a Sermon, especially a Funerall Sermon; lightcou∣lored silken wit is not suitable to line mour∣ning with; I desire no more trimming for a Sermon then that beauty of speech which Solomon mentions Prov. 25. 11. VVords fitly spoken, and in due season, at which I doubt this discourse hath not arrived, yet because it came at your call, and was cal∣culated for your service, and the service of your Noble Family and Kindred, be pleased to owne and patronize both it, and the Author, who is
Sir,
