SIR,
IN presenting this slender Work to your excellent judgment, I do, but , lend light unto the Sun, or adde a dish of wa∣ter to the Sea You are your self a walking Library, and I believe, in these dayes you study men more than Books: Neverthelesse, presuming upon your Noble mind, and disposition, I have adventured to shelter these few lines under your name, as being my Guardian, or tutelary Angel: You must not expect so much profit from barren, as from fertile grounds, neither do com∣mon fields produce such pleasant flowers, as curi∣ous Gardens. I am one of the meanest of your servants, and you must consider rather the af∣fection of the workman, than the perfection of the work. Although rich men brought their gold,

purple, and silk to the building of the Temple, yet the poorer sort brought but Goats hair; the a∣bundance of the heart excused the poverty of the hand: And I am glad to produce something which may testifie my zeal to piety, and my affection to loyalty. All candles are not of the same propor∣tion, neither do they give an equal light, yet it is no wisdom to hide the least candle under a bushel, for the least candle may be commodious for little roomes, though not so convenient for spacious Hals: I have no delicacies for a dainty, or wanton sto∣mack; but a brown loaf may be as wholsome, though not so delicate as white bread; and water for some bodies is more convenient, than wine: This work is plain, and short; like a little cup, it will hardly give you your mornings draught; I desire you to accept of it, as it is, and me, as I am
