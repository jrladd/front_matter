THis short conceipt, that I haue writ of late,
To you kinde father BVBB I dedicate,
Not that I meane hereby (good Sir) to teach,
For I confesse your skils beyond my reach:
But since before with me much time you spent,
Good reason then, first fruits I should present:
That thankefull * BirdThe natu of this Bird that build her nest vn the couer houses (as t Swallow do with vs) leau euer behin her for th owner of th house, o young one, token of h thankfulness and as I m say, for paw of her rent. that leaues one young behinde,
Ensamples me, to beare a thankefull minde:
Vngratefull he, that thankes can not repay
To him, that hath deseru'd it euery way:
Accept (kinde Sir) my loue, that being doone,
I aske no more, desire no other Boone.
