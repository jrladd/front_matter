My Lord,
THAT I am permitted to lay this TRAGEDY at your Lordship's Feet, transports me more then the great∣est Success on the Stage could have done. I confess the Scenes are very imperfect, yet as First-fruits I hope they may prove a grate∣full Offering. 'Tis by your influence that Poetry flourishes in our Age; and therefore no wonder if Poets throng to make you their Acknowledgements, and Dedicate their La∣bours at your Shrine. By the Excellencies of your Lordships Mind they form their best Heroes, and oblige the World with Chara∣cters of Men both Great and Courteous.
Whilst other Judges (like Usurpers in Fame) are jealous of every new Pretender to the Bays, and labour to Crush 'em in their first Appearance; your Lordship as the law∣full Monarch of Wit, sits secure in your Native Right, assur'd that where-ever they gather their Lawrels, those on your Lord∣ships Brow are Sacred and Inviolable. Such is the Accuracy of your Judgment in Poetry, so Correct your Performances when you condescend to Write, that the most perfect Authors must be gratefull for your Appro∣bation: yet so vast is your Candour, as to afford Protection to the Essays of even my weak Fancy. But though I am the least of those that are blest with your Lordships Fa∣vour, yet I am above 'em all Happy in This, that I stand the greatest Instance of your Goodnesse.
