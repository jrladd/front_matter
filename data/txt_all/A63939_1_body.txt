SIRS,
HAving broke the Ice already, in daring to appear publickly in the World, I was willing next to pitch my Thoughts upon the le∣vel, for the benefit of my Friends and Acquaintance: If perhaps I might with a short Discourse, not too tedious for the Ears of any sober Person, that is at leisure from the Noise of Importunate Cares and Business, recommend a Sub∣ject that is worthy a bigger Encomi∣um than I am able to give it. I am not ashamed of the Theme, but I am a∣shamed of my self, as a Person unwor∣thy to handle it; this made me hesitate a while, and consider, whether I were
not imprudent, to put my self upon such a Subject as would tempt the Reader to enquire, whether the Author were such a Glorious and Beautiful Saint as he here recommends to the World? To deal freely and ingeniously in the Case of such Objections as these are, I will openly avow it to the World, that I Admire the Rule we are to walk by; I am ashamed every Night upon my Knees of my own and others Transgressions and Prevari∣cations. God forgive us! we live as if we were in love with Deformity, and took a Pride in that which is our shame! Mankind is absolutely the Greatest Blot of all the Visible Creation; and 'tis the saddest Lamentation of all, that the World is growing old, and men no wi∣ser than they were some Thousands of Years ago. We are sensible of Neatness and Beauty in Cloaths, Faces, Houses, eve∣ry thing but our Lives and Manners. If this be not an Absurdity, I know not what is: The Heathens (some of them)
laughed at it long ago, as a piece of Nonsense not reconcileable to Humane Reason, and yet we still go on to Dote at the same rate, and never Tax our Intellectuals, as if they were to be blam∣ed for the immorality of our Lives. Men are generally tender of the Reputation of their Wit, and choose (of the two) ra∣ther to be suspected and accounted Knaves than Fools; but in earnest, in the Ac∣count of Religion, 'tis hard to say whe∣ther they are fitter for, Bridewell or Bedlam. To provoke my self and Rea∣der to shake off (by degrees at least) this Ungodly Tribe, and to live like Men of sense, and somewhat that is solid and brave, to love that which is Truly Lovely, is the sincere Design of
Dear Sirs,
