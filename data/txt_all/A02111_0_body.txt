SVch (right Worshipfull) as coueted to decke the Temple of Delphos, adorned the shrine eyther with greene bayes, or curious instruments, because Apollo did as well patronize Musicke as Poetrie. When the Troyans sought to pacifie the wrath of Pallas: the peoples presents were books and launces, to signifie her deitie, as well defended by letters as armes. And they which desired to be in the fauor of Alexander, brought him either wise Philosophers or hardy Souldiours; for hee sought counsellers like Aristotle, and captaines like Perdy∣cas. Seeing then how giftes are the more gratefullie accepted, by how much the more they fit the humr of the party to whome they are presented: desirous a long time to gratifi your Worship with some∣thing that might signifie, how in al bounden duetie. I haue for sundry fauors bin affected to your Wor∣ship, and finding my ability to be vnfit to present you with any thing of woorth; at last I resolued so farre to presume as to trouble your Worship wyth

the patronage of this Pampht, knowing you are such a Maecenas of learning hat you will as soone vouch with Augustus a fw verses, giuen by a poor Greeke as of the Arabian Courser, presented by Ty∣tinius. The Booke is little, yet drawen from a large principle, Nunquam  est ad bonos mores via: wher∣in I haue discouer so artificially the fraudulent ef∣fects of Venus trumperies, and so plainly as in a plat∣forme, laide open the preiudiciall pleasures of loue, that Gentlemen may see, that as the Diamond is beauteous to the sight, and yet deadly poyson to the stomacke, that as the Baan leafe containeth both the Antidote, and the Aconiton, so loue (vnlesse on∣ly grounded vpon vertue) breedeth more disparage∣ment to the credit than content to the fancy. If then (right Worshipfull) out of this confused Chaos Gentlemen shll gather any principles, whereby to direct their actions, and that from rash and resolute mainteners of Venus heresies they become reformed champions to defend Vestaes philosophies. Then all the profit and pleasure that shall redound to them by this Pamphlet shall be attribued to your Worship, as to the man, by whose meanes ths Nunquam sera came to light. Hoping therfore your Worship wil with a fauorable insight enter more into the mind of the giuer than the woorth of the gift, I commit your Wor∣ship vnto the Al∣mightie.
