Perditio tua ex Te, L:

O London, understand thy woe,
Thou art thy Self thy greatest Foe;
Be warn'd, be wise, prevent the Fates,
Destruction bounceth at thy gates,
And know, There is no earthly thing
Can make thee happy, but thy King.


Think with what Honour the first dagger came
Into thy Shield, the Times are now the same.
