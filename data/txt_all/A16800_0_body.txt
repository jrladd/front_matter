SIR, vnthankefulnesse is so neare to vnhonestie, as to auoid the touch of both, I haue been often desirous of some good meane, to deserue some one of your many receiued fauours, which loath to burie in such obli∣on, that I should be thought vnwor∣thie the regard of so good a minde, I haue thought good to acquaint your kindnesse with such occurrents, as haue lately come to my hands, though they bee no matter of this state, yet were they such tracts in the fortunes of two Princes, as being read with that discretion, which, in your good leasure, can iudge of the labour of wit, in the ho∣nour of vertue, I doubt not but that you will fauourablie patronage this first apparant proofe of my loue, till in some better occasion of employment, you maie haue a more sufficient triall of my affection. The substance of my

historie being loue, the subiects Princes, the nature ho∣norable, the aduentures dangerous, the fortunes strange, and yet the ende happy: will suffice I hope, to perswade the wittie to reade, the wise to fauour, the learned to al∣low, the honest to commend, and your good mind to ac∣cept of: which being no more then I desire, nor lesse then I hope of, leauing my booke to your kind patience, with my selfe to your commandement I rest.
