Most humbly sheweth.
WHereas your Petitioner, upon your High∣ness gracious dispensation for the exer∣cising of his Ministeral function &c. (a favour never to be forgotten by him or his) did indeavour the procuring ad∣mission into a setled Cure of souls, but was denied it by some Commissioners clayming authority under you. Your Petitioner (being willing to interpret that act of theirs, as well as all things else that happens to him from men in the most charitable sense he can, and knowing Gods hand to rule and over-rule, as he pleaseth in the most seemingly accidentals amongst mortals) began thereupon to consider with himself; whether God might not in his mercy design him, to what some men, in too much unkindness had doo∣med him, viz. to some more Apostolical way of prea∣ching, either from house to house, here in his native Country, or (if he had but the Apostles gift of tongues) throughout the whole world habitable a∣broad. For he could not think, that God had cal∣led
him to be a minister of the Gospel, and inabled him im in some poor measure for it, and honoured him with so long continuance and good success in it (to the praise of his grace only be it spoken) to that end, that, when he had so long served him, as a pub∣like teacher of men, he should at the last, end his dayes in the privat teaching of Children; though he undervalues not that his present imployment by preferring that other before it; nor will he receed from it (God inabling and your Highness permitting him) till he have educated those that are or shall be committed to his care and tuition, if their friends shall require it. Whereupon your Petitioner casting about and making inquiry, in what Country or Na∣tion he might do God most service; poor neglected despised Virginea, and the English Colonie there, with the adjacent heathen inhabitants of the same continent, came often and often into his thoughts; and his bowels yerned towards them; especially, after that he had understood, from some men of ho∣nour & honesty, their present sad state & condition, and the fair hopes and probabilities of doing God and them very much service there. Onely the prime , whereby he conceives, he may most pru∣dentially judge of the likelyhood of his success in undertaking ought for the good and benefit of that people, will be your Highness assisting or not assi∣sting in the information of what is already experi∣mentally found to be the grand hindrances of that co∣lonie's prospering amongst themselves, & the main impediments of the Gospel's fart har propagating both amongst themselves and amongst their neigh∣bouring Indians, and are here with humbly presented
unto you: For unless those things complained of in this Remonstrance be redressed and the Government (as is therein humbly desired) be put into good hands, skilfull to mannage it; and such a publick profession of Religion, both for Doctrine and wor∣ship, be established, and such a fence of discipline set about it, as that both those, who would remove from hence thither, may before hand know what Religion they may there enjoy, and when they come thither be assured to enjoy it; and the Heathen also thereunto adjoyning, may from the very eternal order and beauty thereof, as well as for the unani∣mous, constant profession and practise of it amongst those of the Colonie, be fairely united and sweetly drawn to the same Christian communion and fel∣lowship with them; it cannot be expected, that ei∣ther your Petitioner, or any other, how zealously af∣fected soever they are to the advancement of Gods glory, and the propagation of the Gospel of Christ should leave their preaching and other Ministration here in their own native Country that so much needs them, though they should be allowed to preach no where but in bonds and fetters, or in caves and other hiding places, (which they fear not, so long as your Highness shall retain the Soveraign power solely in your own hands) and go into Virgi∣nea to labour there in utter impossibilities, or to be thrust out from labouring, when any probabilities of doing good should be offered them, only upon the di∣stast or suggestion of any turbulent or vicious persons that shall complain of them to a Governour, as indis∣creet and vicious as themselves. If a preacher had Saint Pauls immediate call to bear Christ's name be∣fore
the Gentiles, as well as Gods own Israel, or were otherwise as well assured, of the like call; all seeming impossibilities of doing good, and all af∣frighting fears of suffering evill would soon vanish, and he would account it honour sufficient to suffer for Christ, where his preaching of Christ, should be rejected or rendered succesless. But, where a Prea∣cher is to conclude his call to any people, as well from the door of hope, that is opened to him for his glorifying God, and doing good to men, as from Christs inward knocking at the door of his heart by the motions of his holy Spirit (not discern∣able from the impulse of his own Spirit, but by the concurrence of Scriptural exhortations and perswa∣sions, or clear deductions from thence, tending to the same ends without any by ends of his own) there it would be deservedly reputed little less than mad∣ness for any to undertake te preaching Christ to the Heathen, when the wicked lives and unjust per∣fidious, cruel, bloody practises of those, that call themselves Christians, and profess the same faith with that Preacher, lye in the door, and barr up the way against his entering into them and their open∣ing unto him: and it would be more possible for him to remove Mountains, than any to remove that im∣pediment of scandel, unless your Highness set to your helping hand, and reform by your power and authority, derived to some pious prudent, upright Governour under you, as well as the Ministers of the Colonie indeavour it, by their faithfull preach∣ing and holy conversation.
May it therefore please your Highness, in compassion of
that great Colonie, and in commiseration of so many thousand souls, both Christian and Heathen, as that Colonie and continent, wherein they are seated, abounds with, to vouchsafe your best skill, and to ex∣ercise your utmost power (for the work needs and de∣serves both) for the effecting that great and glori∣ous design, the preservation of that English Colonie from suddain temporal ruine, and the saving both them and their neibouring Indians from eternal perdition; the sole and soul desire of your unworthy Petitioner, & the only crime of his insuing Remon∣strance. And your Petitioner which thousands of thousands more shall incessantly pray for your High∣ness &c.
