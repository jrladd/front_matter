GRaue,* GOD-WISE NESTOR; Neuer did a Name
(Saue A IVST MASTER) better speak a man
(As Court & Councell, with Mee, witnes can)
Than doth Your Owne, in This Your Anagram.
Should I A Volume of Your Vertues frame,
Broad as my Brest, & Thicker then my Span;
Could I say More, more True, more Duly, than
The Character concluded in This same?
For, * PIOVS-Prudence cannot but be Iust:
And Iustice cannot but be Temperate:
And Temperance from Courage issue must.
So that Your Name doth Your whole Life relate,
So NESTOR-like, for grace-full,* Godly-Sage,
That Nothing wants, but (what we wish) His Age.
