Noble Sir,
THen to your selfe, that man I doe not know,
To whom more obligation I doe owe.
You'r blest with love of Neighbours; and beside,
Blest with th' enjoiment of a lovely Bride.
Blest with a faire estate, and likewise blest
With hopefull Issue added to the rest.
Blest with a disposition for to live
With decency, on that which God doth give.
Blest with the Love of Gentry which resort,
And want no welcome to your Noble Court.
None can (our observation notes it well)
For Hospitality you parallell.
Wherefore I do this work to you present,
But not as dead mens Corps to th' Church are sent
For to be laid in grave; but to be read
Amongst your people, when your Table's spread.

That at your plenteous Table none may feed
Nor drink, but for refreshment, and for need.
Nor after Drunkards, or the Gluttons mode,
Their Stomacks or their Understanding loade.
Then will your Table not become a snare,
Either to you or them (be't round or square)
But God that gives you such variety,
Seeing your temperate use, and great sobriety;
Doubtlesse will blesse and add unto your store,
As to your Predecessors heretofore,
And questionlesse, in honour and in fame,
Will still at Haigh preserve the Bradshaigh's name.
Most Honoured Sir,
