THis Sermon and Nar∣rative (Right Ho∣nourable) which I here present you withal, though they mainly im∣pute the adventure of their
 publication to the importunate Affection of a dear Husband to his deceased Ladies memory, yet I dare not altogether acquit my self of the guilt thereof; at least so far, as the easiness of consent will render me criminal. For, I must confess, that I was apt to bite with some greediness at the Occasion thereby offered me, of giving the world a publick Te∣stimony of the honour I owe to both the Families to which this Excellent Personage concerne in them stood Related; both tha whence she was Descended, an that, whereinto she was by mar¦riage Engraffed.
And being thus, betwixt im¦portunity and inclination, pre¦vailed withal to run this risqu I hope, I have in the reasons  both, given a general account 
 the fitness of my entituling you to the Patronage of them.
But withal (Right Honoura∣ble) there is something also of peculiar in the claim which on your Honours behalf may be made unto them.
For you (Madam) as you blessed the world with the Sub∣ject of the Narrative from your Womb: so, you furnished me also with the Argument of the Sermon from your mouth, in a Text, which (among other ex∣pressions savouring of a well seasoned spirit) dropped from your lips at the arrival of the sad tidings of your dear Daugh∣ters departure. And I the ra∣ther chose to make it the Subject of my Discourse upon that sad Occasion, because your noble Example in the often practise of
 the Lesson contained in it, ac∣commodated me with a notable Instance of its practicableness: Q. sextius ha∣bet quod & o∣stendat tibi be∣atae vitae mag∣nitudinem, & desparationem ejus non faci∣et, Ep. 64. it being a great advantage to the ingratiating of any Duty, when we can by some great ex∣ample, deliver it (as Seneca speaks in another case) from the suspicion of being impossible.
I have formerly admired at the Temper of that noble and learned Roman Lady, Cornelia Nunquam 'ego me felicem non dixerim, quae Gracchos pe∣pererim. Cicero de Consol. the Daughter of the great Sci∣pio, and Mother of the Gracchi, of whom Tully reports, that when she had lost her Son Caius, a very hopeful Gentleman, in his very prime, and in him, her twelfth Child, she brake out in∣to this gallant Expression, that she would nevertheless alwaies esteem her self an happy wo∣man, in that she had had the
 honour to be the Mother of such Children. But I have of late learned to lessen this wonder, having seen her herein out-shined by one no less noble and learned than she, and that is your self; who, in much a pa∣rallel case, have demeaned your self with a far greater, because a truly Christian, Fortitude.
And indeed (Madam) if ever any Mother had reason to take Comfort from such a Conside∣ration, you have, in that though you have survived divers of your Children, yet have you withal had the happiness to see them all signally vertuous even beyond their years, and conse∣quently, also the Argument of an ample Assurance of their eternal felicity, in their early maturity and fitness for it.

In which respect, how can it indeed be other than an infinite satisfaction to you, that in send∣ing so many Children to the place of happiness before you, you are (as it were) glorified by piece meal: and instead of planting Families from your bowels on earth, have contributed towards the planting of Colonies in Hea∣ven; instead of recruiting the Forces of the Church Militant, have furnished the Trophies of the Church Triumphant, and (according to the judgment of some Divines of Note) supplied the vacant seats of so many of the Apostate Angels with Saints descendant from you?
The usual distasts taken at this kind of Providence, (whe∣ther from the uncomely  it is thought to make in
 nature, which seems (according to the Proverb) to design the wearing out of the eldest first; or from the disappointment of the common expectation, that our liberi shall be posteri, our Children live to shut our eies and receive our last breath, and dying commands, and keep up our Names, and inherit our E∣states and Honours when we are gone; (a kind of supplemental and subsidiary immortality which propagation in all species of Creatures seems to aim at, and (in a sort) promise as part of amends for the Death of In∣dividuals) and whatever it is of the like nature which heightens vulgar passions) are all such low and pitiful excuses of impati∣ence, and implicite blasphemies against the great Soveraign of
 the World; that I cannot su∣spect the Heroical generosity of your spirit, needs the assistance of any Considerations (which yet both Morality and Christia∣nity afford in great plenty) to be suggested by me for the removal of them. For you have made it sufficiently evident to all that know you, that you are a person who do (as the Philosopher saith) fortius amare, love your dearest temporal comforts more valiantly than so; as experi∣menting the sweet only and not the soft impressions of that most powerful Affection.
And therefore (without en∣larging this Epistle into another Lecture of Christian submission to, and Acquiescence in Divine Providence) I only tender that of the following Sermon to your
 hands, not so much in the nature of a Perswasive to your Duty, as the Product of your Example.
And you (My Lord) by the dear affection which you have born to all the surviving Branch∣es of that Noble Family, and to this excellent Lady in particu∣lar, ever since the decease of your noble Brother and their Father the late Earl of Huntingdon, have rendred your self so much more than an Uncle to them, that I fear I had not done you right, had I not given your Name the very place that the Natural Father's, had he lived, might have claimed in this De∣dication.
And I am withal the more hardened to this adventure, (which otherwise the little ac∣quaintance I have with your
 Lordship might render presump∣tuous) by the remembrance that when your Lordship rendred your self the principal atten∣dant of these sacred Reliques to their Dormitory (though the great hast of your affairs then enforced you to call for the Ser∣mon before the day appointed, and necessitated the delivery of it with some disadvantage by the surprize; yet) your good∣ness was pleased to give an am∣ple testimony of your acceptance of my endeavours therein, as having not only in some propor∣tion discharged my Duty to the Living, but also done something of Justice to the Dead. And therefore, I hope, that what was then honoured with your accep∣tance, when (in that discompo∣sure) it had no higher ambition
 than to obtain your pardon, may now, having gained by a review something of more orderly com∣posure (though it yet fall much beneath the excellency of the Subject) aspire to your Patronage also.
To conclude, I shall ease both your Honours of the trouble this tedious Epistle hath given you, when I have offered up a short Prayer on the behalf of all the surviving Relations of this ex∣cellent Lady; viz. That God will enable them by his Grace to improve this sad Providence to their utmost advantage, which will be best done by copying out her Vertues in their own practise; considering, That Do∣mestical examples of eminent Goodness, as they reflect an ho∣nourable lustre upon the Fa∣milies
 from which they are ex∣tracted, (Saints adding a grea∣ter glory to any Pedigree than Princes) so ought they, into them especially who are nearest of Relation, to insinuate the most ardent and affectionate desires of Imitation: as those, which through proximity of bloud, have the assistance of something of natural to endear them to the Affections; the help of frequent and familiar con∣verse to imprint them in the memory; and lastly, the Evi∣dence gathered from constant observation, to justifie to the Judgment the reality of that Beauty which appears in them in all Dresses, against the suspi∣cions of Auxiliary tinctures, wherewith our uncharitableness usually burdens the most re∣splendent
 vertues of those that are meer Strangers to us.
And, for a close, may the God of all Grace so bless them with an increase of all gracious qualities, that they may all rise up into the like reputation of singulat Instances and Examples of Christian Perfection with Her that is gone before them; and yet manage their growth so thriftily for us, that by a preco∣cious maturity, they may not precipitate their removal from us; that this profligate Age may be the longer blessed with such living Convictions and Reproofs of its desperate viciousness; and themselves enjoy the more am∣ple opportunity of advancing the Comfort of their Friends, and their own Reward.

These Requests, as there is none who prefers them on your hehalf with more zealous affe∣ction, so, I dare confidently af∣firm, there is none that shall find himself more obliged to be thankful for the Answer of them, than
(Right Honourable)
