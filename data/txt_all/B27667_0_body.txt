May it please your Lordship,
HAving the Honour of being a Servant both to your Lord∣ship and your Excellent and most Worthy Father, and from my Infancy a dependance upon your Family, I humbly presume to dedi∣cate the following Narrative to your Lordship, being an Account of a most Scandalous Examination, given by one Jacob Myars (a Jew) which has not on∣ly brought me, but also a great part of the Kingdom, under severe Censure and Reflexion; as if the Ship Laurel had been most barbarously plunder'd by the Countrey through some Contrivances of mine; a Crime so abominable, that were I guilty, I deserve not only to be dismist your Lordships service, but to be stigmatiz'd, and excluded from the So∣ciety of Mankind. Yet as the glim∣mering
 Candle being snuff'd, does straightway give the clearer Light, so I doubt not but your Lordship will find by perusing this Narrative, That their false Insinuations and Unjust Aspersions will cause my clouded Innocence to shine so much the brighter.
These and other Considerations obli∣ges me to publish matter of Fact: And since Addresses of this kind are a mode of the Times, and that it hath pleased the Divine Powers by their several Endow∣ments of Learning, Wisdom, Justice and divers other Honourable and Vrtuous Qualities, to bless You as a Pattern to the Age You live in; I shall not omit, in all Humility, to beg Your Lordships Fa∣vour in other Occurrences, but to this no manner of Patronage, other then to Read and Judge one that desires Life no longer than while he demeans himself a faithful Subject to their Majesties, and in all Sincerity and Truth,
