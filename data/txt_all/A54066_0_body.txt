FRIENDS,
I Have heard that ye are seeking after the excellency of Nature and Learn∣ing. I am not for discouraging any Man in endeavouring after that which is good, useful and excellent in its kind and place: But it is the advantage of everything, to know and abide in its place, and to honour and serve him from whom all good Gifts and Endowments come. Man hath but a moment in this world, and he is here no more; and then the spirit returneth to God that gave it, to give an account of the Talent which he gave it, and its improve∣ment thereof to the Glory of him that gave it, and to the salvation of its own soul. Now this Talent is of an higher kind than Nature, and will lead high∣er than Nature, giving a man to partake of that wisdom from which Nature came; and teaching him to order all that is natural, to its right end: For God is not an Enemy to Nature, but to the corruption and disorder of Nature. I desire ye might know and partake of the true wisdom, and feel union with God in the principle of his own Life, and in the incorruptible and Heavenly seed of God receive dominion over the earthly and corruptible. For this end singly, in the love springing up in my heart towards you (as it often doth, both towards particular persons and Societies: For I am a friend to all, and a lover of all, sincerely desiring the good of all, and the right guidance of their souls to happiness) have I proposed these things following more particularly to your view, though they concern others also, that ye thereby might be awake∣ned to search after that which is most excellent in you, and be acquainted with the vertue and precious effects thereof, to the full satisfaction and compleat joy of your souls, in that which alone is able fully to satisfie, and give them ground of durable joy and rejoycing in that which is not of a perishing nature, but which was, and is, and will be the same for ever.
