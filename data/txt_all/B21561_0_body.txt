Most Gracious Sovereign,
THat we as Representatives of a Congregation of Forreigners established in these Your Ma∣jesty's Realms venture to lay to your feet these small papers, would be too great a presumption, did not the Time and Occasion require and warrant it. When the Enemies of Your Majesties most Sacred Per∣son and Government, have been so bold, as to pull off their Masks, and appear bare-faced in Contri∣ving the destruction of our common Religion and Liberty, in that of Your Royal Person and Govern∣ment; when the Loyal Native Subjects of this Kingdom unanimously congratulate Your Safety, and make fresh Vows of their Fidelity and Loyalty, we could not think it unseasonable, that we, who are Yours as well as any of them, and therefore as nearly concerned in Your Safety as the rest of Your good Subjects, join with them in Devotion, and
 plainly express the hearty Sentiments of our Souls upon this great Occasion. And since both the Preaching and Publishing of this Sermon are to no other End designed, why should we doubt Your Ma∣jesty's Gracious Acceptance of it.
We make bold to assure Your Majesty, our Conscience bearing Witness, that here is nothing said but what comes from a sincere Inten∣tion, and the full Satisfaction of our Hearts, and what is the unanimous Sense of all our Brethren, who will never fail as long as we live to engage our most intense and most affectionate Prayers for the Preservation of Your Majesty's Sacred Person and most Glorious Government, and for the Success of Your Arms.
