Gentlemen,
I Salute you with the perfected Compositions of your Triumphs, Performed to perpetuate the Memory and indelible Fame of your Right Honourable Brother the Lord Mayor of London; in which I have omitted nothing that may reaso∣naly conduce to his Honour, or what might be thought Regular, pertinent and proper to the Magnificence and Splendor of this Days Ovation; wherein you have liberally laid out your selves in the expenses of so chargable Accomoda∣tions; plentifully exhibiting the superfluous part of your Substance for a Show. Yet since it is no difficult thing to prove that a Theater is an Epitomy of the whole World, by the same Rule of Reason we may conclude that the glittering part of this whole City is but one great Pageant consisting of Streamer-like Ribons, gay Gold and Silver Laces and Royal Embroidery, which although it be thought superfluous in the moross opinion of an Austere Stoic, yet it is accounted National Glory and Badges of Prosperity in the eyes of Persons Heroick: For it doth in some measure, match with Coronations, Chariots of Victory, and Triumphs of quility: The Authors of such Inventions having always been (like your Worships) God Commonwealths-Men, and Lovers of their King and Country, such is the Approbation of
Worthy Sirs,
