SEldome or neuer (Right Worship∣full) doe we finde Tractates, either Humane, or Di∣uine, passe with∣out their particular Dedications, that being shrowded vnder the safe-garding gourds of honorable and right godly dispositions, they might the better bee preserued

from the parching detractions of malignant Cynicks: I make bolde therefore (discarding all selfe-hu∣mour and irregular singularity) to commend this poore Present, vo∣strum ad patrocinium, to the worthy patronage of your well-affected Worships, two especiall reasons mouing me hereunto. First, that mine vnfained gratitude, entire af∣fection, and most humble duty for all your fauors inexpressible, might heereby bee made apparent: Se∣condly, it being deliuered at that solemne baptisme of Charles your first born and hopefull heyre, none I know more worthy of this Dica∣tion, than your worthy and right Christian persons.
I present it to your religious con∣siderations, as a louing and friend∣ly New-yeeres gift: for it aymes at that blessed New birth, and happy

New life, liuely in baptisme repre∣sented, without which it is not pos∣sible for either of you to possesse the Kingdome of God.
Accept therefore (I humbly be∣seech you) and take in good worth this short Treatise; short both in line and learning: respect not (as is that Prouerbe) the measure of the gift, but the minde of the giuer, what is wanting in the one (I dare boldly promise) is made vp in the other.
At your best leisures vouchsafe, I pray, now and then to peruse it, and I trust that your Christian paines herein shall bee well reguer∣den'd with heauenly pleasures here∣from.
The Lord God make this (with all other like Christian helps) much profitable to your soules, and as he hath abundantly blessed you with∣outward

honors and dignities ex∣ternall, he would also euen fill your heares and spirits with the inesti∣mable riches of his al-sufficient grace: that hauing granted this two-fold blessing to you in this life, you may haue the more assured hope of a third in the life to come, which is his blessing of glory: for all which forenamed blessings, your Worships shall haue my best and most deuout prayers, continued to the Lord; to whose sweetest prote∣ction I betake you both with your hopefull sonne this present day and euermore:
From Hempsted in Essex, Ianuary, 10. 1620.
