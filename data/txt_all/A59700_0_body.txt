SIR,
WEre not your humanity my Rock, I could not but be thought audacious, (if not insolent) to make you (learned Sir) Pa∣tron to this piece; you, whose works have carried your name and honour as far as learning hath spread her wings; you, whose smallest pieces, are worth whole volumes of other writers, so that the ancients have no cause to glory in their Livie, or their Seneca, since the best of those they so much boast of, are
 blended in your person, and you are master of all their perfections: but Sir, I know you will not think your self disparaged, that I (how mean or infor∣tunate soever am so bold thus to sa∣lute you, since you know (as well as I) the greatest Monarchs ever yet in pow∣er, have deigned to accept (if I may speak modestly) and refund far un∣worthier subjects then these. You know Sir, that Mercury the God of wisedom, hath his house, his exaltation, and his triumph in one and the same sign; ne∣verthelesse, he hath greater force and efficacy in his unfortunate one. These Essays (for the most part) found pro∣duction in the infamous Goal of New∣gate, where (for my loyalty to the late King) I suffered a severe restraint al∣most fourteen moneths. These Delinea∣tions (I am confident) as dull as they are, will seem to some but as so many night-pieces; they will cry out, that like (the Cuttle fish, I hide my self too
 much in my own inke: But to you (most learned Sir) if I may seem but the least guided by caelestiall adjuve∣ments, and worthy of your pardon, I have my wish, and shall esteem my self ever obliged, as becommeth him that affectionately honoureth you, and is,
Sir,
