Worthy Sir,
WEre the bles∣sed soules in blisse ca∣pable of griefe, it would bee for no∣thing more than
 that being possest of such an eternal weight of glory,Cor. 4.17 their care and diligence was no more when they dwelt in houses of clay,Iob 4.19. to glorifie God, by the improuement of their time & Talēts.
Considering also that in the graue, whe∣ther wee are all go∣ing,Eccl. 9.10. there is no worke, nor deuice, nor know∣ledge, it behoues e∣uery
 one to take that wise counsell,Pro 17.16. What∣soeuer his hand can doe, to doe quickly; lest ha∣uing a price in his hand, and wanting a heart, hee bee iustly taxed with folly.
I haue therefore aduentured (this ser∣uant of God, the Au∣thour of this little worke,Gen. 35.20 being dead) to erect this Pillar on his Graue by publi∣shing
 these few ob∣seruations, as they were deliuered by himselfe, especially being incouraged by some that are godly & iudicious; being confident that (by the blessing of God) they will doe a great deale more good this way, than was possible by kee∣ping them priuate; for by this means, he
 being dead, yet speaketh.Heb. 11.4.
It is but reasona∣nable that I present them to your Wor¦ship, for whose sake they first had a be∣ing in the world, hauing also had ex∣perience of your fa∣uourable acceptance of a small treatise of lesse worth already; I am imboldened to begge of your Wor∣ship to countenance
 this likewise, far bet∣ter deseruing both for matter & Author.
Psa. 35.27.The Lord, who de∣lights in the prosperity of his seruants, blesse you both in your person and familie, and by deliuering you from euery euill worke,2 Tim. 4.18 preserue you to his hea∣uenly kingdome. To whom be glory for euer and euer, Amen.
