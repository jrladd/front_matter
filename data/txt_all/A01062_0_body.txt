THis vnpollisht Historie Right worship∣full, wanting the Ornament of Eloquence fit for rare inuention, presenteth it selfe in his naturall and selfe expressing forme, in well applied words, not in tedious borro∣wed phrases: wherein neither the lewde can finde examples to sute their dispositi∣ons, the vertuous no tearmes to discontent them, nor the well affected any cause of offence. Here shall you see lust Tyran∣nizing, auarice, guilty of murther, & dignity, seeking his con∣tent with vsurpation, yet all subuerted by vertue. Which I am bold to present vnto you, not for the woorth, but to expresse my good will, which is not vnmindfull in some sort to gratifie the manifold curtesies I haue receiued of you. And although it be altogither not worth estimation, and to be accounted no requitall for so many good turnes, yet I desire you to accept the same in steed of a better, and the summe of that which my abilitie at this time can affoord: Which beeing but a fancie, vouchsafe to esteem, though not agreeing with your grauitie, yet (as many both Noble and wise in such like matters haue done) to be red for recreation. As the value of the gift expres∣seth not the affection of the giuer, nor the outward show the inward meaning, so I trust you will esteeme my good wil, not

by the worthinesse hereof, but the qualitie of my well affec∣ted intent, which is deuoted vnto you in the bands of perfect good will, and will be readie to shewe it selfe constant in any triall you shall make thereof. And for that I know your wise∣dome and curtesie to be such, as that you wil not misconceiue me, but esteeme well hereof, and my affection to you, to bee exprest in the dedicatiō, I haue aduētured to dedicate the same to your protection, though altogither vndeseruing the title of your patronage, which your further kindnesse shall binde me hereafter to requite the same, with some worthier worke col∣lected by my labors. Thus being loth to be tedious and trou∣blesome vnto you, I commit this silly present to your gentle acceptation, and your selfe, to the gratious protection of the Almightie.
