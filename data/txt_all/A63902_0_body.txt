My Lord,
WHEN I had written that dis∣sertation which is now abroad, upon that Text of Deuteronomy c. 25. 5. which I presumed humbly Boaz and Ruth. to Dedicate to your Lordship; there were some Things in it which I had thoughts to illustrate, and others which I found it necessary to amend, and this I questioned not to do in a Sheet or two of Paper at the farthest, and so to Print it together with the other as an Appen∣dix
 to it; but it so hapned, that stepping out of my way before I was aware, I found my self of a suddain entangled in a La∣byrinth so lovely and delightful, so full of fragrant Flowers and pleasant Fruits, that as it was difficult in it self to find the way back again from whence I came, in a Maze whose Paths were so nume∣rous and so winding, so I had as little inclination as ability to be disintang∣led, and would almost as soon have sought the way out of Paradise, as out of that Orchard, that Garden, that Shady Grove, and Flowery Mead of Antiquity in which I had so fortunately lost my self, a place whose Clime was as happy and as sweet as that of the Golden Age, whose Banks were wash'd with Ri∣vers of Milk and Honey, less terrible and more fruitful than Tigris and Eu∣phrates, with which the Old Seat of Innocence was surrounded.
For in the Mythology of the Anti∣nts, there is every thing to be met with,
 which either Ambition or Appetite can desire; we walk and divert our selves in the Hesperian Gardens, and pull the delicious Apples of Alcinous; we sit down as guests at the Aetherial Ban∣quets, and purchase to our selves the Golden Fleece, more pretious and more worthy of a toilsom Voyage than the Wrecks of Spain, and in the Wealthy Streams of Tagus and of Ganges, we find our selves refresh'd and rich toge∣ther.
Besides that, in the Theology of the Ancient Pagans, which is combined and twisted with the other, being all of it envelop'd and obscur'd in Fables; we are surprised with a noble and compre∣hensive Prospect of the Philosophy of those early Times; for when all is done, the Religion of the Pagans was little else but the Physiology of Ancient Days, or of the more knowing Architects of Religious Worship, who wrapt up their Opinions concerning the Omniscient, om∣nipotent
 and omnipresent Numen, in the covert of Shadows and Hierogly∣phic Fables, which putting on several Persons, Names, Appearances and Shapes, according to the several Powers, Attributes, Respects and Operations of that one supream and independent Be∣ing, with Relation to the Ʋniverse which is govern'd by him, became at lengh by the ignorance of the Vulgar, who could not see Juno standing behind the Cloud, but worship'd the Cloud it self instead of Juno, so many sensible and material Objects of stupid Adoration; and this is that which the Apostle charges them with, That they changed the Truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the Creature more than the Creator. But yet, my Lord, it cannot be deny'd, notwithstanding the abuse to which these things are subject, but that there is an excellent and an whol∣som use to be made, even of the Dotage and Superstition of those deluded Mor∣tals,
 whom we ought rather to pity than despise, in a just Deference, though to mistaken Antiquity; and in considera∣tion that we ow our Knowledge, though not to their Mistakes, to their Persons, to which we are indebted for our own; for even they that rail most against Hea∣thens and Idolaters, are after all their Piqueantry descended from them, and ow the power of blackning their Memo∣ries to themselves; their Vertues ought to be strow'd with Commendation upon their Graves, their Vices and Imper∣fections, like the Nakedness of Noah, ought not by us their Sons with too much rashness and petulance to be re∣vealed; and for their Future State, though the same Practices that they were guilty of, would undoubtedly be damnable in us after a clearer Light and a better Information; yet the con∣dition of a pious and exemplary Hea∣then, wanting the means and opportu∣nities of Conviction, and living up in his
 human Conversation to the Principles of natural Religion, do's not seem to be so very desperate, as some Men of narrow Sentiments are pleased to make it; and it seems to me that St. Paul was of this mind, when he said, That when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, these having not the Law are a Law unto them∣selves, which shew the work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conscience also bearing witness, and their Thoughts the mean while ac∣cusing or else excusing one another.
But whatever may be said of the Vail and Cloud it self, which the Heathens for the most part ignorantly worshipped instead of the divine Sub∣stance that lay hidden under it, yet it cannot be deny'd to be an useful Opera∣tion, to take off the Scales from off the Gentiles Eyes; it must after all be grant∣ed to be a noble, and an excellent Em∣ployment,
 if it prove Successful, to pry within this aged and venerable Vail, and look through the Symbol and Hieroglyphic Emblem, into the Sub∣stance and the Truth of Things; the effect of which Enquiry will be this, that it will appear that even the Pa∣gans themselves, those I mean, that contrived and molded their Religion; the Priests, and Poets, and Philoso∣phers of the Heathen World, had a just and true Notion of the divine Be∣ing, and of the way and means by which his Nature should be worship'd and his Anger appeas'd, as appears by their Sacrifices, their Ceremonies and Lu∣strations, which were all or most of them Symbolical Adumbrations of the infi∣nite Obligations we have contracted to him, of the Cleanness, Purity, Ʋpright∣ness and Integrity, which he expects in his Worship and in the Conduct of our Lives, and of that awful Humility, de∣vout Submission, and most unfeigned Re∣pentance,
 with which we ought to be acted and affected, when we look back∣ward upon our Sins and Follies, or for∣wards upon his pure, unspotted and un∣tainted Nature, which is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, and cannot converse with unrepenting Sin∣ners, continuing in a State of Impeni∣tence and Obduration.
It is at once a pleasant and a profitable Contemplation, when we converse either with Eastern Sages, or with the Mytho∣logy of the Greeks and Latins, which was borrowed from them in a great measure at least, to think how the Principles of Vertue and good Life, as in the Symbols of Pythagoras, and in many of the Rites and Mysteries of the Gentil Worship, notwithstanding the Heat of the respe∣ctive Climates, were muffled and folded up in multiplicity of Garments, and in so great variety of Shadows and Dis∣guizes; and yet through all these Co∣verings by their own native Brightness,
 they should compel and force their Pas∣sage into the Eyes and Heart of every competent Enquirer, and make them∣selves still more glorious, more power∣ful and attractive, more beautiful and bright, for being thus industriously darkned and concealed.
If Antiquity with too profuse a Vene∣ration, exalted good Men, or Men that were useful and serviceable to their Country by great Benefactions, or by the invention of profitable Arts, into the Rank and Dignity of Gods, and paid them a Worship suitable to that Opinion, yet this hinders not but we may reap advantage, even from the Superstition and Ignorance of our blind Forefathers, and though we do not adore them as Divinities; yet we may bless their Memories, and pay that Reve∣rence which is justly due to the Ashes of Heroes and Illustrious Persons, and we may lay them before us, as Copies and Examples to imitate and tran∣scribe
 as far as we are able, and as of∣ten as opportunity presents it self.
Neither would the Antients have been so much to blame, that they divid∣ed and parcel'd the Omnipresent Nu∣men into so great variety of Names and Notions, according to the several relations and respects which that Om∣nipresence bears to several and distant parts of the Creation, as that in the Heavens they called him Jupiter and Minerva, Ceres and Ops upon the surface of the Earth and underneath it, Pluto and Proserpina, in the Sea Neptune, upon the Shore Priapus, and in the Port Portunus and Palaemon, but that it gave occa∣sion to the Vulgar sort, who could not discern the Philosophy of these things to look upon them, because of their several Names, and of the se∣veral Rites and Ceremonies used in their Worship, as so many distinct and independent Beings, to each of which
 they ascribed a Divinity by it self, in which if I am not very much mistaken, the true Mystery of most of the Pagan Idolatry consisted.
That which I now present your Lord∣ship with, is but one Part in four of that which I design; the next will be a com∣pleat Diatriba by it self of the Persian, Aegyptian, Assyrian, and Chaldean Deities, which with a great deal more, is now already finish'd from my hands, and shall very soon be publish'd to the World, if this which I now put abroad shall meet with that Encouragement and Acceptance which I hope it will; and the reason why I broke off here, was only, that not intending any such thing at first, but only to write a Sheet or two by way of Notes upon the former Treatise; I had not affixt the Numbers upon the top of the Pages, which I fore∣saw would create disorder and confusion to my Reader, and besides, it look'd ridiculous to call that Notes upon a for∣mer
 Treatise which had no manner of connexion with it.
I hope without Vanity, I may pre∣tend to have made much greater Disco∣veries than any Man in this kind hath done before me, and some of them I would by no means exchange or part with, or lose the just Glory of having found them out, to be thought or to have been the Author of the best Book that ever I read in my life; and if any Man shall ask why at every turn I am thus importunate and troublesom to your Lordship? I Answer, Because I am in∣debted to your Lordships Goodness, for the leisure of composing all that I have written, and for my Subsistence it self, and therefore the Fruit of my lei∣sure returns from whence it came, by a reason not unlike to that, for which Heaven claims the Sacrifice and Ado∣ration of Men. That God would conti∣nue to bless and shine upon your Lord∣ship, and to prosper you in all your
 Ways, and return your Favors and Kind∣nesses to me a thousand fold into your own Bosom, is the most affectionate and assiduous Prayer of,
My Lord,
