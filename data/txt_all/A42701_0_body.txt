MADAM,
WHen your Desires were once and
again signified to me, of having
this Discourse published, it became not me to
Dispute them, especially in such a Season,
and in such Circumstances to which nothing
is to be denyed, and therefore I presently
resolv'd to Comply, tho' I was not Ignorant
at the same time how hazardous a Proof I
must give of my Obedience.
For tho' Sermons of this kind are not so
liable to Censure as others, because if they be
plain and practical, 'tis all that is expected
from them, and Allowances are generally
made for those Deficiencies of Language,
Method and Reading, which would hardly

be granted in other Composures: Yet if th
be any thing of a Character added, That is ca∣pable
of being assaulted by so many, and in
such various wayes, according to the diffe∣rent
Apprehensions and Interests of Men,
that nothing renders an Author more obnoxi∣ous,
or sooner forfeits the Reputation of the
whole.
What Entertainment, MADAM, this is
likely to meet with, I am not at all sollicitons
to know, for if what is here said be any wayes
instrumental to Moderate that Sorrow you have
justly Conceiv'd, for the Loss of so near a Re∣lation,
or may serve to keep up the Memory
of so worthy an Example, I have all my aim;
unless▪ it be the gratifying of a little Ambiti∣on
which this Opportunity gives me, in letting
the World know, that I was once honoured
with the Friendship of the Deceased, and
that I am▪
MADAM,
