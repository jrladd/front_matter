MOst loued, most dread, most absolute both borne and re∣spected Soueraigne, to offer excuse for that which I nee∣ded not to haue done, were secretly to confesse, that hauing the iudgement to discerne a fault, I wanted the will not to commit it. Againe, to seeke out some coulers to make it more plausible, were to bring in question the sufficiencie thereof. Therefore without further insinuation either for pardon or for acceptance, I here present vnto your Maiestie this defence, both of the pre∣sent authoritie of Princes, and of succes∣sion

according to proximitie of bloud: wherein is maintained, that the people haue no lawfull power, to remoue the one, or repell the other: In which two points I haue heretofore also declared my opinion, by publishing the tragicall euents which ensued the deposition of King Richard, and vsurpation of King Henrie the fourth. Both these labours were vndertakē with particular respect, to your Maiesties iust title of succession in this realme: and I make no doubt, but all true hearted Englishmen wil alwaies be both ready and forward to defend the same, with expence of the dearest drops of their bloud. The Lord vouch∣safe to second your honorable entrance to the possession of this crowne, with a long & prosperous continuance ouer vs.


Qui tibi Nestoreum concessit pectus e ora,
Nestoreos etiam concedat Iupiter annos.
