IT IS not many
daies past sithēs
I beyng retyred
for a tyme (my
good lord) into ye
village, and there takyng the
commoditie and pleasure of the
fayre swete fieldes, a certaine
frende of myne sent vnto me a
worke in the Castilian rong of
the lorde Antony of Gueuera
bishop of Mondouent, & Chro∣nicler
of the Emperour: in rea∣dyng
whereof I founde great
pleasure and profite. The title
of the boke is the Disprailyng
of the Court, and the Praise of

the life rusticall, dedicate vnto
the kyng of Portingal in suche
sort, that the better to kepe and
to hold the wise sentence & eru∣dicions
therin cōteined, I em∣ployed
certaine houres after
supper to trāslate thesame into
Frenche, not thinkyng among
mine other simple workes euer
to put it abrode, but after that
I had cōmunicat ye same with
some of my frendes that haue
knowledge of the Spanishe
tong, to leaue it in a corner to
make it meate for Rattes and
Mise. Now for trueth, the first
exempler was so euil deuided,
and the leaues so out of order
that I gaue charge to ye Scri∣uener
that was my nye neigh∣bour
to copye them, & as who
should say to write it faire and

in order, the whiche so euil went
about it, aough by ignorāce
he could not ensue ye originall,
yet for to gette a litle money he
solde where his pleasure was ye
copies so vncumly set together
that I was sory and repentant
that euer I consumed the tyme
to trāslate it, till at the last mo∣ued
by the persuasiō of Annas
Regyn Vicar generall, and by
Peter Cister your aduocate, by
them twaine my great frendes,
I thought it better to presente
to the eyes of all men this euil
translated, then to suffre lenger
those euil exemplers so corrup∣ted
to my blame in ye hādes of
those that haue no right iudge∣ment,
to know from whom the
faute came: wherfore my good
lorde, vnder your prudent fa∣uor

& correccion I do aduēture
herein my name and fame ac∣cordyng
to my knowlege, tru∣styng
assuredly that your only
name shal suffise to vanquishe
and set aside this slaunder, the
whiche slaunder as enemie to
learned men, sease not to with∣draw
those that haue good wil
and minde to studie: I say this
that as me semeth it is well
worthie that worke of the wyse
bishop of Spayne be presēted
to his semblable or superior in
learnyng in Fraunce, or rather
aboue him in knowlege & ver∣tuous
maners. I will adde to
to this, that the graue sentēces
& persuasion to vertuous life
conteined in this boke deserue
to be offred to you that are ac∣customed
to vse thē after suche

sorte ye euery man haue plaine
opinion of you that ye are sent
of God to be protector and pa∣tron
of vertue, troubled & dis∣pised.
Therfore (my singuler
good lorde, as one of ye chiefest
of the best sorte) I dedicate to
you this my litle laboure, not
that I thinke it worthy to cum
into your handes, but for to be
a perpetuall witnes that I do
owe vnto you my seruice with
all reuerēce, to the whiche most
humbly I recommende me.
From your cytie of Clere∣monte
this first day
of Maye. Anno. M.D.xlii.
