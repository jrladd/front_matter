May it please YOUR LORDSHIP,
HAving no other way publickly to express my grateful Sense of the
deep Obligations, laid by YOUR LORDSHIP upon my Family, and in particu∣lar upon my self, I am prompted to do it by this Dedication. Wherein yet I dare not undertake (as it is usual on such Occasions) to delineate YOUR LORD∣SHIP's High Character, and (though perhaps I might do it without suspici∣on of Flattery) fall upon the Encomium of Your No∣ble Virtues, and Eminent Actions; partly, because they are so universally known already to the World, as not to need the Pen of any
Panegyrist, much less such an one as mine, who reckon my self insufficient for so great a Task; And partly, because I believe YOUR LORDSHIP would not like the Way that is so common and so much abus'd. Only I hope it may not be thought below YOUR GRAN∣DEUR to patronize this lit∣tle Piece (at least for the Subject, and the Author's sake) and to bear with what faults Your Judicious Eye shall find in the Translator, who humbly begs Pardon for this presumption, and ac∣counts it a great Honour
to be known and own'd by YOUR LORDSHIP, as
MY LORD,
