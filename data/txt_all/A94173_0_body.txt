Honourable SIR,
THis small present whatsoever it is, cove∣teth
to preferre it self to your Trust, and
Patronage, and to come abroad into the
world under the protection of your name. Most
willingly therefore I do here make a tender of it
unto you, who, as I understand by Fame, (and
in Subjects of worth, Fame is seldom found a
Liar) are not only Illustrious by the splendor
of your Birth, but far more Illustrious by the
nobility of a generous mind, by your love to
Learning, your Humanity, Piety, and all man∣ner
of Virtue, howsoever to me living private∣ly,
and contentedly in a smal Cottage, and not
much solicitous what is done abroad, especially
as the times noware) never known by your face,
nor by your name until within these few Months,
no nor as yet known unto me, but only by your
MUNIFICENCE. Nevertheless I hope
this poor gift will find some acceptance with
you, because having already obtained my Rod
of Liberty you endeavour to enclose me again in
my antient circle, and to draw me back to my
discontinued exercise, by proposing to me some
honest Salary by the excellently learned Mr.
Thomas Barlow, chief Keeper of Bodleys Library in
the famous▪ University of Oxford, It is indeed
welldone, that in this deplorable state of Civil
and Ecclesiastical affairs, (if we may call


and a hideous confusion of all things) there
are peradventure found one or two of a more re∣fined
clay, who either by their encouragment,
or their bounty are careful to comfort the sad
Muses, and the Retainers to them, of whatsoever
condition, those especially who being Professors
of true and Christian Philosophy are every
where neglected, and dispised, as the refuse of
the world: I any thing therefore (by the permis∣sion
of the Almighty) shall hereafter be under∣taken
and published by me in this kind of wri∣ting,
which pertaineth to moral Philosophy
that may be either profitable to the Publick, or
useful to any private man, for the better Institu∣tion
of his life, and the framing of his manners,
by the prescript of the Divine Law and Gospel,
whether it be in the Latin tongue, or in the En∣glish,
which I perceive to be more acceptable of
to many of our Nation, I do here willingly ac∣knowledge,
and freely professe, that for the
greatest part, it is due unto you, who were both
the Author to me to undertake it, and an Assist∣ant
cheerfully to proceed in it: And do you, most
wrhy Sir, proceed to do good, that is,
to do that which you do already, to adorn Lear∣ning,
to favour learned men, to advance Piety,
to procure you faithful friends at the charges of
unfaithful Mammon, that so ou of the abundance
of good works sowed in this world, there may
redound unto you, a most fruitful Harvest of e∣ternal
blessednesse in the world to come. Amen.
From Botheby Pannel  Lincolnshir. 10 Cal. Decemb. 1659.
