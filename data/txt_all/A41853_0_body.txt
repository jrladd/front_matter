My Lord,
YOur Lordship, I hope, will pardon the Boldness of this Dedication, and permit the

Presenter of it, to pay that Ho∣nor and Veneration, which is due from All to your Lord∣ship's Eminent Character, and most Illustrious Merits. To which, nothing can do greater Right, than what has come from the Mouths of the late flagitious Rebels them∣selves, who were so highly sensible of your Lordship's Wis∣dom and Courage, in oppo∣sing their Hellish and Damnable Designs, that their Principal Leaders were us'd to please them∣selves with nothing more, than

with the Thoughts and Wishes of making your Lordship a Sa∣crifice to their Malice and Re∣venge.
I will not attempt to speak here of what you suffer'd for your Inflexible Loyalty from a Seditious Cabal, nor of our Obligations to your Auspicious Conduct, which nipt the grow∣ing Faction in the Bud, and stopt the Torrent of Enthu∣siastick Frenzy, and by a bold Stroke of Justice, set at Liber∣ty those who were condemn'd,

unheard, to a perpetual Confine∣ment.
It were a Task too hard for me, to undertake a particular De∣scription of these, and other In∣stances of your Lordship's Good∣ness and Courage, which will be the chief Subject of the most la∣sting History of our Times.
All that I pretend to, is, to make some publick Acknow∣ledgement of the just Sense I have of your Lordship's Great and Exemplary Virtues, and

to testifie in all Sincerity, that I am,
My Lord,
