holy Mystery of the Masse, hath embol∣dened me to present vnto your Seruice, this Infant of a Spa∣nish Descent, clad in English Attyre, to at∣tend vpō you in your Chappell at such pu∣blicke or priuate So∣lemnities. Not doub∣ting but that he shall

receaue such Enter∣tainment at your de∣uout Hands, as his Educatiō deserueth; & especially at this Tyme, when so hap∣py a Vnion, & firme Friendship is novv most happily conclu∣ded, between two so mighty Kingdomes, by so Fortunate and

Hopefull a Mariage. Wherto, if I should adde my commenda∣cions of his worth, I might therby rather do him Wronge then Honour; knowing his Tallents, and other good parts to be such, as may beseeme his Seruice; though per∣haps not so familiar∣ly

acquainted with the fashions of your English Court, as is required: yet because I know your Disposi∣tion to be Noble, and your Minde greatly addicted to Piety & Deuotion, and also that the Present can∣not be but accepta∣ble; I do in the best

manner I can, com∣mend him to your Honourable Custody & Protection, & my selfe to your vertuous Prayers, resting
