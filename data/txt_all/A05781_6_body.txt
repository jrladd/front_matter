RIght vertuous Lady, health and happinesse,
Mourning Endymion in Obscuritie▪
Doth wish to thee, though hee be in distresse,
Entrapped by malicious Trechery,
Of such as glorie in his Miserie.
He found thy Knight a Patrone in his griefe,
Commiserating his extremitie,
Vn-monyed Preachers seldome finde reliefe,
Of men excelling in that facultie.
There lyeth some secret hidden misterie▪
That wit of mortall man cannot vnfolde,
Why blessed caelestiall Diuinitie,
And learned men, are Measur'd by their golde,
Happily Ourania shall vntwine this string,
Good Ladie reade her booke, and heare her sing.
