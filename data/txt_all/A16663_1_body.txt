Most worthy Sir,
WHen first by happy chance I cast my fight
Vpon the sparkling lustre, beauty bright
Of your rich jewell lockt-up & enclos'd
In a neat Cabinet: I, strait suppos'd
It was great pitty, such a pretty jemme
Should be shut up from publike view of them
Who could not with the Latine Key unlocke
Your Casket, and partake of your rich stocke.
I therefore have (most worthy Sir) made bold
To ope the Locke, lay ope your jemme of gold,
To every gracious eye and godly minde
That in such Iewels can pure pleasure finde
And, thus with my weake breath your Trump to sound
In a knowne tone, whose eccho might rebound,
And on the hearers hearts reverberate
To minde their present and their future state.
And (hence) I must ingenuously confesse,
I primely should and would the same addresse
Vnto your worthy-selfes sole acceptation
Were I not bound by most strict obligation
To those my honour'd friends forementioned
By cords of many favours thereto led.
But next to them, accept, I humbly pray
This borrowed-light from your suns lustrous ray;
These bubling streames, weake straines that have their motion,
From your full fount, as tribute to your ocean.
In confidence of which great courtesie
Thereof perswaded, by your piety,
Praying your Worship may be aye possest
Of all true holy, happy joyes; I rest,
