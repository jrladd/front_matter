HEroicke HAY, I know nothing so strong,
As bands of Loue which vertue hath conbind:
And if I should not vertue praise, I wrong
My selfe more than I wrong true vertues friend:
That I may neither wrong I doe intend
To praise and love the vertuous: dead, or living,
King IAMES and CHARLES our King, I must commend:
King IAMES in Heaven: King CHARLES for it striving.
Magnanimous Lord even you, and I, and all
Must strive for Heaven, and whilst wee breath, must fight
Gainst sinne and Satan: least wee catch a fall
From Heaven to Hell, and so may lose our right.
Christs coloures now are flying in the field,
And woe to such as shall to Satan yeeld.
