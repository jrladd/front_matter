ONce more (most beautiful damsels) I am bold to presume of your won∣ted fauour, thereby being lead to a performance of a vowed duetie, where a kinde zeale bindeth to of∣fer the acceptance of a seruiceable good will, there a carefull feate that forewarneth to incurre the hazard of offence, maketh the hart to stag∣ger betweene hope and despaire: hoping through the kinde∣nes of your gentle dispositions, to obtaine a defence against iniurious cauillers, and fearing by an ouer-bolde presumpti∣on, to offer offence to the affable sweetenes of your soue∣raigne curtesie. But seeing my desire to bee possessed of the better cordiall, makes me hart-strong to suppe of that poti∣on which is likest to lengthen my welfare, the same being an assured confidence of your continuall carefulnes, in shrow∣ding with your affection the slender substance of my humo∣rous Morrice.
It is not long since for Tel-troths Newyeeres-gift, I presen∣ted vnto your liking Robin good-fellow his newes, with his in∣uectiue against Loues most iniurious enemie Ielousie: which though it was a token to gratifie the day, yet if with indiffe∣rent iudgement the matter therein contained be considered of, I doubt not, though it was a New-yeeres day toy, it may proue a many yeeres helpe to hinder that hagges enterpri∣ses. The worke tooke his title according to the time of his creation but shall Robins prescriptions be followed; the pa∣tients maladie shall continually finde it a gifte to signifie the
 good beginning and prosperous proceeding of many new yeeres vnto them. But now to send Tell-troth packing, Ho∣nestie hath thrust himselfe into your seruice, who though at the first sight he may seeme a crabbed companion, yet let me beseech you to stay your censure til you haue throughly tryed what is in him, and if then he shewes not himselfe a diligent pleaser of your immortal vertues, memorize in the Cronicles of Disdaine the same of that runnagate simplicitie, and let me for his faulte be banished from your good thoughts to euer∣lasting ignominie.
I was rather desirous to trauel altogether inuisible, then to haue had a title which might giue light to the vnderstanding of me your vnworthie professed Author; but since the high∣er powers denie me that priuiledge, I am content to subiect my self to the opinions of courteous dispositions: beseeching you to beare with my vaine, for that the vanitie of this age regardes no other, nor would any be content to heare of faultes, vnlesse they be tolde them in meriment. I protest there is nothing scandalous therein, nor which is ment to offer iniury to any, onely my purpose is, that if you should know any like vnto any of those in disposition, that either you forewarne them those monstrous iniurious vices, or ac∣compt of them as pestilent foolish wretches. To shun tedi∣ousnes, I commit m intention to your misticall considerati∣on, my woorke to your courteous protection, my selfe to your fauourable opinions, and your sa∣cred selues to the heauens tuition.
