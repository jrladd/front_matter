MADAM,
THE Opinion I have of your Goodness must needs be very great, when I think the presumption I am guilty of, in this address so innocent and justifiable, that I do not much doubt your pardon. It is cer∣tainly no small one in me, to make use of your name, to do that, which of all things, I take the greatest pride and pleasure in; that is, confidence to let the World know, I cannot receive a favour with half as much freedom and satisfacti∣no, as I can acknowledge it. To those I have received from Your self, I cannot but add the many extraordinary Obligations, I am in∣debted to your noble Relations, and particularly those at Cumber∣low; and among those, to that accomplished Person, whom the World justly admires, to find, at so few years, soaring in a Flame so high, as that of the Author of the History of Philosophy. These Madam, are so great, and consequently, press so much upon my me∣mory and resentments, that, since the greatest acknowledgements I can make of them, are in my apprehension, much below the advan∣tages I have made thereby, it is no miraculous effect of Gratitude, if I grasp at any occasion to do it.
For, what I now present you with, Madam, I need say no more by way of recommendation of it, than that it is a third Volume of that excellent Romance, whereof you were pleased with so much kindness to receive the two former; with the same fate too, that is, that it hath gone through more hands than one. The advantages you are to make of it, I am not to press, since it is, among your other perfections, not the most inconsiderable, that you can discern the ex∣cellencies, and discover the defaults of things of greater consequence, than those of this nature. But when I reflect on your Sex, I cannot but do my Author this right, that as no man hath put greater ob∣ligations

on It, than he, by the noble and generous characters he hath honoured it withal; so is it but just, you have the esteem and affe∣ction for him, which you have not for any other.
Thus, Madam, having given you an account of this address to your self, and presumed your pardon for it, I have a far greater confidence to obtain it for another I make to Heaven; which is, that you may meet with that indulgency of fortune and happiness, which so much good nature, so noble an education, such a vertuous inclination, and excellent endowments, as yours are, may justly ex∣pect. And this, Madam, shall be the perpetual wish of,
MADAM,
