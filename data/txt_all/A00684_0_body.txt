Right Honorable,
THis funerall Sermon preached vpon the death of a Gentleman, my pari∣shioner and neighbour; being by the importunitie of some brought to the Presse (I hope) for the benefit of all; comes thus to light vnder the gratious and honorable Lyuorie of your Lordships name; as a remonstrance of that dutie and thankfull acknowledgment, where∣vnto I am engaged: for those many reall and liberall encouragements, my rawer and riper studies haue re∣ceiued from that hand of bounty, which to my selfe and
 Brethren, (aswell during our many yeeres abode in the Vniuersitie, as also since) hath alwaies layen open; whereby as we all acknowledge the vttermost of our religious respect and obseruance, vnable to satisfie the least part of that debt due to your Lordship: So wee trust the most iust God (who leaues not a cup of cold water vnrewarded) will returne your Lordship dou∣ble and treble remuneration. What entertainment it may finde in the broad world, I regard not; If from your Lordship it obteine the least approbation, I haue my hearts desire; which shall euer spend it selfe in prayer to God, for the compleating heere, and crow∣ning hereafter, of your Lordships manifold graces and vertues.
