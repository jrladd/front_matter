My Lord,
THE following Discourse is herewith humbly offered to your Lordship, in Obedience to Your Commands. And tho' I cannot doubt of its Acceptance there, where I have receiv'd so many Pledges of Re∣spect; yet had I been left free, this should have been the last Thing I would have chosen, by which to express my Thankfulness, and my Duty.
The sad Solemnity being perform'd late in the Evening, I was obliged to drop several Paragraphs, that I had prepar'd to speak, which are here sup∣plied in their proper Place.
As for the Defects which still remain, I can only ask Your Pardon, SIR, but cannot remedy 'em.
I had neither Skill nor Colours, to draw so bright and Heavenly a Life; the Piety and Devotion She daily practis'd, gave Her such Perfections as were easily Admir'd, but scarce possible to be describ'd.
And now, my Lord, if instead of votive Tables to adorn Her Shrine, Your Lordship shall preserve Her Memory, by imitating Her Example, You also shall be kept by the Power of God, through Faith, unto Salvation; which is the Prayer of,
Right Honourable,
