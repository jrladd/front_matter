My most Gracious King and Master.

Most Serene KING, AND MY Most Gracious LORD,
BECAUSE it Pleased Your Majesty, most Se∣rene Prince, to lay Your Commands upon me, to Write both in our own Language and Latin, what we observed in a late Northern Journey, concerning the Elevation of the Pole, and other things of that Nature, I have

therefore for a few Weeks past, since our Return, daily deducted somewhat from my Publick Con∣cerns, that thereby I might most humbly Obey the Commands of Your Most Serene and Royal Ma∣jesty. But as the Nature of Ma∣thematical Sciences is such, that they depend upon Easie Use and Exercise, but require a more dif∣ficult Invention and Demonstrati∣on; so our Observations are made in fewer Hours than Demonstra∣ted. The distinction of the little Wheel into its known Parts, gives but small Trouble to the Clock-Maker; but the manner of di∣viding is not his, and but dif∣ficultly Invented. Even Boys at present do mutually teach one another Arithmetick; but the

Practice of it hath been Intricate, the Rules being altogether drawn from the very depths of Mathe∣maticks. The Masters of that Art will peradventure wonder, that at this day the Mathematici∣ans solve the more difficult Pro∣blems by the help of Addition solely; but when they have got∣ten the Key they will cease any further to admire it. For the Ig∣norant Plough-man will play you upon his Instrument any French Air, just as well as the most ex∣cellent Musician, provided he have but the Key of it. In a word, all Artifices which owe their Births properly to Mathematicks, are of the same Nature. And because very many not well skil∣led in this Learning; and not

sufficiently accustomed to distin∣guish the Truth of Sense and Reason, have rendered Philoso∣phy only sensible; and by this Error of theirs, have rendered the way to solid Learning in o∣ther Sciences also very abstruse and difficult; therefore Ma∣thematicians have resolved never to admit of any thing whatsoever, without clear and perspicuous De∣monstration. How imperfect the knowledge of our Senses is, when destitute of Reason, the Sun be∣ing elevated above the Horizon in the whole World may teach us; which yet reason dictates to be otherwise placed. I have there∣fore expounded the Doctrine of Refraction, and other things not altogether so unknown more at

large than was absolutely needful. And it is well that our Observa∣tions come forth in both Lan∣guages, tho' our Mother-Tongue might have been sufficient for our Countrymen; as it is now usual for the French, English, and other Nations of Europe, to express Arts and Sciences to their Countrymen. And yet because very many Fo∣reigners have laid the Seat of their Fortunes in Swedeland; and, besides that, there be divers Peo∣ple of the Subjects of Your Most Serene Majesty, who speak a Lan∣guage only proper to themselves; the Latin Tongue being familiar to all in the European World, wil best fit every one of them in Par∣ticular.

Lastly, because Foreigners born under another Climate and Soil, have a desire to learn such things from us; as not long since, both the French and Italians undertook this Journey, not without the greatest labour; so, Great King, something will redound to the Immortality of your Name, from this Observation not only begun, but likewise perfected under the Auspicious Influences of your most Serene Majesty. The World is not ignorant, that God hath ador∣ned and accumulated your Maje∣sty with Endowments of all sorts, which we falling into the other Extreme do more sparingly com∣mend; whilst studiously shunning the Mob of Flatterers so much de∣tested by your Majesty, with a ta∣cit

Veneration only honour every Perfection drawn from the heap of your Imperial Vertues: Out∣landish Men will not be silent in it; nor shall after-Ages neglect to extol it to Heaven with the just∣est Praises. As for what con∣cerns this little Work, I ought not to conceal that it is not only be∣low Mediocrity, but I am sensi∣ble will be far beneath the Hopes of your most Serene Majesty: For since the Time that your Majesty unexpectedly imposed the Province upon me of a most different Nature from this Affair; for some Years together I threw away the Rule and Compass, as unprofitable Instruments for the Course of Life which was then to be taken; and hid those old

Masters in a certain Corner of my Library, which still fills up a little Room in my House at Upsal; but now endeavouring to wipe off that filthy Rust from my Mathematical Instruments, which they had contracted by ly∣ing by, I have made it my Busi∣ness, that rather Power than Will shou'd be wanting in me so far distant from my Books; and be∣cause a great Strife amongst your Subjects in the Veneration of your Serene Royal Majesty grows daily warmer; as for me, the least share of them, if I cannot act equally to the rest, yet certainly will never suffer my self to be out∣done by any in Obedience, Re∣verence, Observance, submissive Respects, and a devoted Dispo∣sition.

To the very last I will hum∣bly implore the Divine Majesty of the Supreme God, that he will vouchsafe perpetually to preserve your Majesty, the Glory of Kings, (given from Heaven to promote his Honour, and conserve our Country) healthful, vigorous, undisturbed, and chearful to us, and to them that are, and shall be born of us: So wishes, and will ever pray,
