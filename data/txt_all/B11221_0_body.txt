RIght worthy (but not Right Worshipfull, whose birth or grouth being in the open fieldes) I salute thy Crab-tree countenance with a low congeey, being stroke downe with thy fauour: whereas (kind sir) I some∣time slept with thee in the fieldes, wanting a house ore my head; and that you then in kindnesse, because I was so kind, kindly to accept your kind companie, because I was vnkindly thrust out of my lodging; at that instant, you assured me to take my part in all dangers: I am now to make vse of your valloure, to protect me from insicion, or in deede from dirrision, in which I am now to wade deepely: but if I scape Monday, which is omminus to me, I shall thinke my selfe happie: and though Fryday be for this yeere Childermas day, yet it is no such day of danger to me; then on Tuesday I rake my Ior∣ney (to waite on the right Honorable good Lord my Mai∣ster whom I serue) to Hackney. Guard me through the Spit∣tle fieldes, I beseech yee, least some one in ambush endanger my braynes with a Brickbat vnsight or vnseene. Sweete
 Sir Timothie, kind sir Timothie, tough sir Timothie, vse me with kindnesse, as you shall in the like commaunde me hereafter: whose Barke I will grate like Ginger, and car∣rouse it in Ale, and drinke a full cuppe to thy curtesie, when I am returnd to the Citie againe. I shalbe lesse fearefull, be∣ing among my friendes: yet like a Burgomaister walke from Stationers shop to Stationers shop, to see what enter∣tainement my Booke hath; and who so disgrases it enuiously, and not iesting at it gently, at the least baslinado them, that bobbadillo like as they censure, so with him they may re∣ceiue reward. I confesse mine owne weaknesse, and will not iustifie my harebraind folly: but yet I thinke all men of my minde, gently to iudge, not rashly to reuile. Well, when my Bookes are in Paules Church-yarde, if they passe through Paules I care not, for in Fleet-streete I haue friendes that will take Lud-gate to defende me. What should I say? My trust is, that either my simplicitie of loue, or thy crueltie in cudgeling, will guard me from enuious tongues, whose teeth are all blacke with rancor of their spight; and whose tongues are milke white with hart burning heate: God keepe me from their byting; I had rather be stroken with a poysoned bullet: that were a death honorable, the other a life miserable. No more but this, say I am out of towne and heare not their ribald mockes, and by that meanes ex∣cuse me from them, whose poysoned tongues will else abuse me.
