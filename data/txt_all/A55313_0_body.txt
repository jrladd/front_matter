My Lord,
TO whom cou'd a Treatise of Wit more justly fly for Pro∣tection, than to your Lord∣ship, who are so undoubted a Master, and so generous a Patron of it? The
 Muses have long acknowledged You their Soveraign, and indeed your Lordship deserves this Eminent Title much better than the Richelieu's, and Colbert's either of this or former Ages, since you have not only encouraged them to write by your Munificence, but by your Example, which is al∣ways more efficacious. But tho', my Lord, this were Glory enough for any other Person but your Lord∣ship, yet Wit is not the only shining Quality for which the World admires You: To a happy Imagination, and lively Genius You have reconciled the severity and profoundness of Judg∣ment: And for ought I know are the only, but I am sure the best refutation of what the Author, I now with all submission offer to You, has advan∣ced, viz. that Wit and Judgment are incompatible Talents, that never meet in the same Person. The whole Na∣tion, my Lord, has no less owned the Statesman than admired the Courtier in You, and our Island, of whose
 Government You had a Share in our Monarch's absence, ow'd its Repose and Peace to your wise Administra∣tion as well as it does its Politeness to Your Vivacity and Wit.
Tho' this, my Lord, I hope may be sufficient excuse for the boldness of this Address, yet I was farther encouraged to make You this pub∣lic acknowledgement when I consi∣dered in what an obliging manner Your Lordship received me some Years ago in Paris, where You were pleased to lay Your Commands up∣on me to wait upon You when I returned to England. Being consci∣ous to my self that I had nothing of my own growth that was fit to entertain Your Lordship, I have pre∣sumed to lay the following Transla∣tion in all humility at Your Feet, which originally comes from a Polite Kingdom, where You won the ap∣plause of all that had the happiness of knowing You. But I am sensible
 that I have too much trespass'd upon Your Lordships Modesty and Patience, and therefore beg leave to subscribe my self,
My Lord,
