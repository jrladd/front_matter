My Lord,
DID the Fate of Books depend upon the Quality of the Persons to whom they are Dedicated, I should be very secure, that the two following Discourses would be kindly received, because I have presum'd to put 'em under the Protection of one of the Greatest Persons that can be made choice of. It is very well known, My Lord, that Your Il∣lustrious Family has a long Succession of Ancestors, whose Blood has been mixt with that of divers Princes; and it is not long ago since we lost the Duke your Father, in whose Air we saw all the Traces of so August a Pedigree. He maintain'd the Glory of His Birth, by all the Merit necessary to make a Hero. So prudent in his Conduct, that he never took a false Measure; Indefatigably Vigilant, Valiant, and Couragious in Action; these Great Quali∣ties being joined to a Goodness, that made Access to him always easy; and a Piety that gave Example to our whole Church, could not but render him the Object of our Admiration. I know, My Lord, there is no need of looking farther than Your own Grandeur, to find Matter for Your Praises: So the Liberty I have taken to speak of the Duke Your Father, was only to gain an opportunity of drawing Your Picture without offence to Your Modesty. I am not ignorant, that how great soever my Patron may be; yet the Publick, which judges of things as they are in themselves, will not receive these Discourses more favourably upon that account. But I have no farther design in the Choice, than to manifest the Obligations I have to Your Grace for Your Bounty, in affording me the Honour of Your Protection, and to assure You that I am with a profound respect,
My Lord,
