Noble SIR,
HAving considered of some few choice Philosophers, and Historians, when spare

houres were for such pleasing Recreations, I have here re∣presented them in as brief Cha∣racters as I could, onely begging your favourable View of them.
Sir, your high Deserts, in respect of your Excellent Parts, and your large Improvement of them in all Literature, together with that serene Candour which is in you to Admiration, have emboldned me to make these rude Draughts yours, and to shroud them under the Wings of your great Name.
I know I have pitcht upon, as a most Judicious, so, a most Candid Patron; And were I

sure to meet with as gentle a Reader, I should not then feare that black Coale, which young Writers so much dread.
Sir, your Indulgent Accep∣tance of this so mean a Present, will tye me to you with the stron∣gest Cords of Observance, and force, me not only to write, but also, to shew myself ever more,
