My Lord,
AFTER Experience of Gods great Goodness and Mercy towards my Self, and my Neighbours in this City; in delivering us from the Im∣minent perill of Fire Ian. the seventeenth, 1654. I was emboldened humbly to offer to Your Lordship, an Ex∣pedient for the prevention of the like dan∣gers among us: And upon mine humble addresses to Your Honour, I found such a favourable Reception, and Your Self so sen∣sible
of what I submitted unto your serious consideration, that I have often wished an opportunity to acknowledge it:
Now since Divine Providence hath so ordered it, that I was chosen by Lot to preach before Your Honour and the Worshipfull society of Drapers; and having been much importuned by many of that Worshipfull Company to print and publish my Sermon, such as it was: Vpon which motion, weigh∣ing in my self the Argument of the Text, and the prosecution of it, (as I conceive) so need∣full and seasonable for these our times; Also observing your great wisedome, and vigilancy over this populous Mother-City of our Nation; and that you might be the more excited through Gods assistance, to embrace and use all Occasions offered to prevent (through the mercy of God, the Judgements, and miseries which are impending and rea∣dy to fall upon us, and this whole nation for ought we know) by reason of our loud cry∣ing, and high provoking sins: Against which I desire to bear witnesse and expresse to this sinfull world, my zeal to be a Preacher
of Righteousnesse, which as the Wiseman saith, in the day of wrath, delivereth from death, Prov. 11.4.
Vpon these considerations Right Honble. I presume to publish and dedicate the said Sermon to your Lordship; being also more then confident, that what is sincerely and uprightly intended, will be favourably and candidely accepted by your Honour, and your Worshipfull Society; Which is all the Return desired, and hoped for by him who is,
My Lord,
