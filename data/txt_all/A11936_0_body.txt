MY desire to aunswere most dread So∣ueraigne) the care and studie of my parents, so to breed mee, as that I might bee made fit for some ser∣uiceable imploymēt in the Com∣mon-wealth, and the remēbrance of that matter, whereunto mine earthly part must re∣turne, being nothing else but food for wormes, hath these 7. yeeres entertained some part of my life, with an earnest or rather burning desire, not only to learn and find out the readiest and assuredst way, how to reare vp, nourish, & feed Silk-worms, the most admira∣ble & beautifullest cloathing creatures of this world: but also the exactest & best means to preserue and su∣steine thē, with no lesse affectiō to make good & pro∣fitable vse of both. Whereunto hauing in some small measure attained, am willing for the publike benefit of so many of my coūtrey-men, as shall as thankfully embrace it, as I louingly & freely offer it, to frame my labors as motiues & means for thē: to draw frō their proper lāds the inestimable treasure of Silke (there til

now inclosed & locked vp,) euer since the first Chaos. And to the end, that these mine endeauours might purchase the better credit & allowāce with your Ma∣iestie: haue Englished a most worthy & select treatise of this subiect, writtē in French by D'oliuier de Serres L▪ of Pradel, with an annexed discourse of my owne cōtinued proofes in England, & the sufficiency ther∣of, for the yeelding of abundant store of pure Silke. Wishing that after this my publishing of thē, the thing it self may fructify & encrease in such ample measure and proportiō here, as it did there, whē mine Author had once brought his to view. Which vndoubtedly wil be done, if your Highnes wil be graciously pleased to giue life & strēgth to this my slēder & weake first∣borne Impe, that thereby it may grow & spread like the flourishing Cedar-tree of Libanus, to the perpe∣tual, & vniuersall good of all that shall imitate mine example: & the granting thereof likewise by your Ma∣iestie, wil not only more earnestly stir thē therin; but also incourage & egge me on to perfect this work by longer & more continued practise & experience; (if perhaps my through want of further knowledge) of the natures of these excellent creatures, haue left any part thereof defectiue or vnpolished. All I aime at is to do your Highnes, & my Countrey seruice, where in I will perpetually striue with vnresistable perseuerāce to mine vttermost, & will euer pray to God for your Maiesties long and most happie raigne ouer all your Kingdomes and Dominions.
