THe disvnited Scithians when they sought
To gather strength by parties, and combine
That perfect league of freends which once beeing wrought
No turne of time, or fortune could vntwine,
This rite they held: a massie bowle was brought,
And eu'ry right arme shot his seuerall blood
Into the mazar till 'twas fully fraught,
Then hauing stird it to an equall floud
They quaft to th'vnion, which till death should last,
In spite of priuate foe, or forraine feare,
And this blood sacrament being knowne t'haue past
Their names grew dreadfull to all far, and neere.
O then great Monarch with how wise a care
Do you these bloods deuided mixe in one,
And with like consanguinities prepare
The high, and euerliuing Vnion
Tweene Scots, and English: who can wonder then
If he that marries kingdomes, marries men?


MErlin, the great King Arthur being slaine,
Foretould that he should come to life againe,
And long time after weild great Brittaines state
More powerfull ten-fould, and more fortunate.
Prophet 'tis true, and well we find the same,
Saue onely that thou didst mistake the name.
