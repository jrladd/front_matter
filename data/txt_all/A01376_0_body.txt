GReat Queene, at first this taske I took in hand,
Thinking Eliza and your selfe to sing,
And for examples your sole names to bring,
As mightye Princes of the Womens band,
As two choise rulers of our Britissh Land:
As splendent mirrours of dame Natures wealth,
The poores, afflicteds, and th'oppresleds health.


But when my strength a space I tryed had,
Strin in deepe conceits to pen my minde:
My wit starke dull I found my sight meere blinde,
My hands did tremble and my wordes were bad,
Not one rich sentence galntly was clad.
Nor wonder was it: form bookes I finde,
Some Birds, the Sunnes bright beames do feare by kinde.



Wherefore, soone as I came to see my fall
From Sky-built hopes which had borne vp my heart,
I straight resolued on another part,
Briefly to writ in sence more generall
An Elegle, in The me vnmisticall;
And hg it by your Princely Altars light:
Where Lampes of grace might keepe it still in spight.
