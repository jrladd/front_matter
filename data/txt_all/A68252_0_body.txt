Most dread Soueraigne,
THAT my vnskilfull selfe was made
choyce of for this imployment,
and my vndertaking in it encoura∣ged
by Your gracious commande∣ment;
I must euer account of for
the greatest honour, that euer yet
befell mee. Many a Storme, and
Rocke, and Mist, and Wind, and Tyde, and Sea, and
Mount of Ice, haue I in this Discouery encountred
withall; Many a despaire and death had, almost, ouer∣whelmed
mee; but still the remembrance of the Ac∣compt
that I was to giue of it to so gracious a Maiesty,
put me in heart againe; made mee not to giue way to
mine owne feares, or the infirmities of humanitie. Your
Majestie in my employment (like a true Father of your
Countrey) intended the good of your Subjects: and
who is not bound to blesse God for your Royall care
in it? Had it, now, beene my fortune, to haue done my
Countrey this seruice, as to haue brought home the
newes of this supposed and long sought for Passage;

then should the Merchant haue enjoyed the sweetnesse
of the hoped profit, and the Subject haue beene sensible
of the benefit of your Majesties royall intentions in it.
I haue done my good will in it: and though not brought
home that newes, yet shall I here divulge those obser∣uations;
which may (I hope) become some way bene∣ficiall
vnto my Countrey. The Accompt of them, I
here, in all humilitie, offer vnto your most Iudicious
Majesty. Your gracious acceptance of what I had
done, though I had not done what was expected, em∣boldeneth
me to doe so: and since your Majestie was
pleased to signifie your desires, of hauing a Briefe of
my Voyage presented vnto you: that word became a
Command vnto mee, to draw this rude Abstract of it.
Your Majestie will please to consider, That they were
rough elements, which I had to doe withall: and will,
with fauour, vouchsafe to pardon, if a Sea-mans style
be like what he most conuerseth with. In the plaine∣nesse
therefore of well-meaning, since your Majestie
hath beene so gracious to mee, as to appoint mee your
Seruant, I am now bound to vow you my seruice: and
it shall be my honour to be commanded it: and I shall
account no dangers too great, in the going thorow it.
These are the resolutions of
