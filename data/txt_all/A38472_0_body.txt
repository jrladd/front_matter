Honoured Sir,
BE pleased to accept the Patro∣nage of these few Sheets; which as they contain a Trea∣tise of Arms, &c. can no where more securely shelter themselves than under the Banner of Your Protection: For being cherished by Your Allowance, the World may well imagine that there is something more than ordinary compre∣hended in them which may merit a seri∣ous Reading and a generous Practice; especially at such a time, as this, for Warlike Preparation.
