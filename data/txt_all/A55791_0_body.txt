GOD was pleased to make you glorious in∣struments of our liberty in the last trou∣bles; the Cavaliers account it your shame good men your glory: They for this cause hate you, and seek to divide you; These care for you, and endeavour to u∣nite you: They endeavour to draw you to themselves, not that they love you, but that they may make good their aims by weakning you: These endeavour to set you upright for no other ends but your own safety, as knowing how dangerous your Avulsion were from the Common-weal. They can never love you, remembring how their Cause hath suffered by you: These will ever cleave to you be your selves never so unwilling, as knowing how advantagious to the pub∣like you have been and may be. The way to continue you glorious, is to continue your old interests, and not seeking new ones, which will ever lead you into new precipices: If you mean to enjoy the fruits of your hazards and expences, stick to your former Cause, and become not rennagadoes to your noble professions and adventures. If you do, I do not now admonish, but prophesie, your faces will be covered with shame, and your mouths filled with gravell, and those means which carnall wisdom may suggest to you, as the fittest for your security, will in despight of your policy, prove the un∣happy and fatall causes of your devastation: It grieves me
 to think how forward you are in these forbidden paths: yee harbour Snakes in your bosoms; an especiall antidote that may hinder the poyson to come at your heart is more then ne∣cessary: God hath hindered many of your motions; if you go on, there may one be connived at, and then take heed, least you gather the judgements of other Countries (as you have their people already,) contracted into your bosoms.
Ye have yet wise Governours among you, follow them, and be advised by them; remember how like fathers they were to you when you last stirred at Guildhall; remember their safe∣ty is yours, they cannot undo you and preserve themselves: Hate all those murmurers that distill poyson in your ears, and provoke you to discontent; your selves may hereafter confesse that this advice was faithfull. Grudge not at the Army, though they may be a little burdensome: That handfull of men (know it) stands between you and oppression; had that bank been pulled down, those waters which have lately over∣flowed some pieces of our Land, had broke in upon you, and overborne you.
This addresse proceeds from my well-wishes; if prejudice will suffer you to peruse it, you, and the whole Kingdom (to whom it will not be unseasonable) may draw from it some use∣full conclusions, the God of union prosper it unto you, and continue you firme to your first love, least you slide into a shamefull and miserable Apostacy, which ever doubles the crime in a Malefactor. Adieu.
