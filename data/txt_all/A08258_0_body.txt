hath need of helpe and sup∣portance,
as wel in Politick,
as naturall bodies: the like in studies
& labors of the mind. Caesars com∣mentaries
needed no Apologie, be∣cause
his power was able to defend
thē: Nor his Triū verborū literae, to
the Roman Senate, Veni, vidi, vici,
craue any other inlargement, be∣cause
his fame went stil before him
to dilate his acts. In priuate, & infe∣rior
studies, that want countenance
in themselues, the extensiue pow∣er
of greatnes and authoritie giues
strength, and encouragement, to

intensiue weaknesse, when our in∣deauours
though vnworthy of ac∣ceptation
are suffered in their mi∣noritie,
and insufficient age, to
grow vp and prosper in the defen∣siue
bulwarke of protection, against
the stormes of enuious and calum∣nious
tongues, that by continuāce,
through vse and practise, they may
happely afterwards proue worthie
of regard. In the want therefore of
mine own worth, I haue presumed
to shield my selfe vnder your wor∣thines:
and finding cause to distrust
mine own strēgth, I haue aduentu∣red
to shrowd my selfe vnder your
power: Humbly desiring your
Honour so farre to grace these my
labours, as to vouchsafe them a
passage vnder your Patronage, that
therby (though happily they haue

nothing in them to deserue your
priuate reading and account) they
may yet the better by your coun∣tenance
finde admittance and
respect to publique view. For I
must confesse they come much
short, as well of the worthynes of
the Subiect, that they treat of, as al∣so
of your regard and estimation. If
therefore out of your generall res∣pect
to all, your Lordshippe shall
bee pleased to vouchsafe mee this
particular fauour, I shall hereafter
admit all times, and pretermit no
occasions to manifest my dutie, E∣uer
