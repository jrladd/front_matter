SIR,
I Have for some time waited to express my Respects unto you, but having had nothing worthy, I have hitherto stood out; nor do I presume now to build my Security on Merits; but since kind Heav'n has design'd you for my Mecaenas, I kneel at You the Shrine, and offer up the Ʋnhappy SAMSON unto You, unhappy indeed, deluded by them tempting Wo∣men, then still imitating the first Delusion: Nor truly, tho' it is a long time since, do I think it is out of Date, or that the Ladies have forgot it, (the less the more pity;) Or there is no sign for it yet. But I would not have the Ladies think hard of me, because I pity poor SAMSON's Case, and his Mistresses Infidelity; not that I suppose all Ladies Faithful alike neither. But why do I Carp at the Ladies? those tender, soft, sweet, harmless Creatures. Sure, as to outward Appearance, there can't be much harm

in that Sex: But stay, and since SIR You admire 'em too, I shan't speak against them, but only court your Condescention to accept this: And I could wish that it was worthy You, who Fortune and Nature conspiring, have made you the happiest Man: Fortune gave Quality, Nature Generosity, Wit, and all Vertuous Qua∣lifications, whereby You are successful in the Hearts of the Fair, Obliging to all, esteem'd be∣lov'd, ador'd by all; You, You alone, the Dar∣ling of Mankind. And these uncommon Endow∣ments have all their Center in Your Breast, un∣mixt with Vices to sullen Your Glory; But be∣sides, Your Ingenuity so gently shown in Your soft∣ness of Poetry, seems to derive its Original from the sweetness of Your Disposition; and sure, Your Favour to, and acquaintance with Poetry, is so Great, that You alone deserve to claim the Lau∣rel. I hope You will accept this, and that it may give You some Recreation in the Perusal; and so I beg leave to gratifie my Ambition, to sub∣scribe my self,
Honoured BROTHER,
