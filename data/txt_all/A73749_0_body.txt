RIGHT HONORABLE, and RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL:
IT being manifest, the two maine materials out of which Honor and No∣bilitie are created, to be Vertue and Reuennue: as the first being conspicu∣ously to be noted in the a∣ctions of men, both milli∣tarie and ciuill, is of all to be imbraced: so the latter seruing to sustaine Honor, and being as it were the very nerues and sinewes thereof, is of none to be neglected. Reuennue therefore, and the due ordering thereof to the best aduantage, and least charges
 of the Lords and Owners of the same, is the subiect which in this ensuing Discourse is in∣treated of: which although in some particular Offices, others haue heeretofore more largely handled, yet in this briefe and generall kinde no man to my knowledge hath hitherto labou∣red. That I haue endeauoured to be briefe, is because I would not be tedious to such whose weightie affaires otherwise abridge them of time for these matters. Yet I presume (for the most part) this breuitie is without obscu∣ritie, and being sufficient for the purpose it intendeth, frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest per pauciora. Such as it is, I humbly present it as the best meanes I haue, to testifie the great desire in me to doe seruice to the Nobilitie of my country, whose fauourable ac∣ceptance of these my poore endeauors I only craue and entreate, and so rest
