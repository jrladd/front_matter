SIR,
KNowing that it is your great ambition (for the carrying on of
your designes) to be popular, as your many pamphlets against Divine Service
and Episcopacy, do suffici∣ently demonstrate: and Sir, knowing that your
own time is so extreamly taken up in preparing and fitting your self to
cant forth sedition at St. Antholins, where I out of curiosity was
lately to hear you, and believing that it is your intent to raise your self
as high as your late Patron Hugh Peters; and rather than a week
should passe, and somewhat of your name not appear in print, I have
made bold to publish this piece, hoping, though it may have as little sence
in it as some of your own, you will patronize it: and Sir, Ile assure
you, that so soon as I can receive perfecter intelligence of your late
trans∣actions in your parish, and be better informed of your de∣signes, I
shall publish them to the world, that your fame may never dye. Thus, Sir,
hoping, though I present not one of these myself to you, yet you will
protect this from this Censorious Age; I rest
SIR,
