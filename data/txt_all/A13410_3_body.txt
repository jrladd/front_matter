Truely Honorable,
IF your great bounties toward  may be quit,
With loue, and seruice, I haue some such coyne,
Impresse thus with you names; make vse of it,
It doth the soules of Saints together ioyne;
And Syons preseruation doth expresse,
And treats of nought but blisse and happinesse.
Prophane adulterous plots I do detest,
I ayme to please the soule and not the soyle,
To call and summon euery Holy ghest,
To the Lambs nuptialls, is my pleasant toyle.

My Patrons glory my pen onely seekes,
And moues no blushes in most modest cheekes.
Right noble Henry, I do know your brest
Containes a spirit, that is not cantain'd
In ordinary limits; Honor's best,
Approu'd and honor'd, and her worth explain'd,
Being cloth'd with robes of purity most fit,
Lined with mercy, valour, grace, and wit:
Y'are Lord of these, I flatter not I know you,
And your good parts, I honor and admire,
For all your loue and fauours more I owe you;
And what I do not do, I do desire,
I could do for your good: But I note still,
Imperfect acts may rise, from perfect will.
And (best deseruing) Lady you haue beene,
The Patronesse of my (yet infant) pen,
If these more mature workes you do esteeme,
And countenance: I'le vrge both times and men,

To keepe your name aliue, free from the dead,
So long as English shall be spoke or read:
My pen, my sacred muse, and sweetest breath.
Shall honor Henry, and Elizabeth.
God guide, protect, direct, and loue you still,
And send you good, vntill I wish you ill.
