GENTLEMEN,
ALthough I never had so much Vanity as to encline me to think any thing of mine worthy to be made thus Publick, much less so mean a Performance as this; yet having al∣ways an earnest Zeal for the Interest of Reli∣gion in general, and bearing an hearty Affecti∣on to your Pious Undertaking in particular, I have, without any great Difficulty, yielded to your Request of sending this Sermon thus abroad into the World, since you have thereby declar'd your good Opinion of it, and think that it may be some ways serviceable unto both.
The Suitableness of the Subject to the Occasion may not perhaps, be so obvious at first sight to every Apprehension; but those that consider the Cause in which you are engag'd and know
how you have been used, and what Success you have found, will soon perceive how agreeable it is thereto; yea, how necessary also to take off those Objections, and to prevent those Dis∣couragements that have too often appear'd, and may yet be made use of against so excellent and glorious a Work, from the many Enemies it will certainly create, and the many Friends it may occasion us to lose: For, tho' the thing may be true as to the former, yet I very much question whether ever it was so as to the latter, (for that Man either never was a true Friend, or deserves no longer to be so accounted or va∣lued, that shall become an Enemy upon such an Occasion as this.) But admit it to be so in both, yet Solomon tells us, that it shall be otherwise at last, provided we do but the Things that Please the Lord now: And therefore, as I know you have been always careful of the one, so I doubt not but you have often experimented the Truth of the other, and so I hope you al∣ways will: For I am sure it has been so with me; for which Reason, I have in the Applica∣tion of this Assertion, to this present Occasion, singl'd out from my own Experience all those Instances of it, that I have herein given to confirm the Matter of Fact; except the last, and that also I do as firmly believe, and hope to find, as I can do any thing in the World; for I am very sure it must and will be so.

Enemies, indeed, we have all along had, and great ones too, and so we must expect as long as the Devil has any Interest in the World, and so strong a Party amongst Mankind: But what of all that? We it worse than it is? as long as the great God is for us, we need not care who is against us. What, tho' the Age be vitious, and the Great ones, that should have known and done better, have made it their Business, for Thirty Years together, to corrupt and debauch it? What, tho' the com∣mon People rage and rattle against those that endeavour to reclaim them? Yea, what, tho' the Magistrates themselves, who invite us to bring them Information: against the Vices that reign amongst us, and promise their utmost As∣sistance in the Suppressing of them, should not only underhand, but even openly, and upon the Bench, and in the very Courts of Justice, ap∣pear to be the greatest Patrons and Promoters of them; and instead of encouraging those ho∣nest Informers, who thus come to them (upon so good an Occasion as this) in the Fear of God, and in Charity to the Souls of Men, by making their Work easie and safe, do all that in them lies, to make it both troublesome and dange∣rous, and thereby to beat them off from enga∣ging any further therein: All which you and I have seen, and a great deal more too; and can therefore truly say, that the King's Pro∣clamation
does them no Wrong, in charging them as it does, with being in a great measure the Occasion of the abounding of so much Impiety and Profaneness amongst us: And what if it should be so still, and those that have in this Cause resisted unto Blood stri∣ving against Sin should be again beaten, and wounded at the very Doors of these Magi∣strates, without Protection or Redress, and meet with nothing upon Complaint but Scoffs and Jears, as I have known it but too frequently to be? What I say, tho' it should be thus, and a great deal worse; yet you have no Reason to desist, or be discourag'd; for that God that has supported you hitherto, and prosper'd you so exceedingly (as is sufficiently known from the several Accounts that have been given of your Affairs in Print; first by the Right Reverend Bishop of Gloucester, and since by the Reve∣rend Mr. Woodward, and some others) will do the same still, and both continue and enlarge his bountiful Goodness towards you: He knows that what you have done has been for his Name's sake alone; and that not a Man of you, has ever expected, much less desir'd or receiv'd, one Farthing of Profit, by all that you have done; nay that, besides the indefati∣gable Pains which you have taken therein; you have expended vast Sums of your own, in Car∣rying on this excellent Work, notwithstanding
all the Reproaches that the World has cast upon you, as if you made great Advantages of it to your selves, and did all for filthy Lucre's sake; for no other Reason, but because the former Governours, as Nehemiah says, Chap. 5.15. used to do so, and made their Servants do the same: But so have not you done; nay, I know you can, and do defie the most inquisitive and implacable Malice to fasten any one Thing of that Nature upon any of you: For, as you have wash'd your Hands in Innocency as to that, so you are able to compass God's Altar, in the Integrity of your Hearts, as to every thing else that concerns this whole Affair, and can appeal to him to justifie you therein.
There are, I know, many of our Dissenting Brethren, that have engag'd in this good Work, as well as you, and have form'd themselves into Societies for the Carrying of it on, as you have done, and that very heartily too: But that is rather a Reproach to those of your own Commu∣nion than to you, since by their refusing to assist and join with you, they do in a manner force you to seek Assistance elsewhere. Let but these Men that seem to be thus jealous both of you and them, assist in this Pious Ʋndertaking, with that Zeal and Vigour that you have done, and go through with it, as they ought to do, and I dare engage that you, and they too that are thus reproach'd, will gladly desist, and with
Transports of Joy, become Spectators only, and concern your selves no further in it, unless it be to bless God for them that are willing thus to take it out of your Hands, and to recommend them to his Grace, for all necessary Assistance to prosper so good a Work here, and for an eternal Recompence of Reward suitable to it hereafter; as I now most heartily do all those, that are al∣ready engag'd in it; being in all sincerity,
Wesim. June 30. 1698.
