WHat I now in heart, and euer in my hearty and dayly Prayers vnfay∣nedly wish on your behalfe, right

deare beloued Brethren, I am not (as you know) neither shall I euer, God assisting, be awan∣ting to further by my dayly and best endeuours for you, whether it bee by my Preaching, or by my Pen: (though this latter finds enough to doe, to prepare matter for your eares, not eyes.) To which end, as also for the publike good of many others, I haue not beene vnwilling at the requests of some, that these few directions following (which, nigh seuen yeeres since, were, at the earnest intreaty of a neere friend, summed vp in haste) should, after they had also soun∣ded in your eares) see the light,

and passe, euen rudely, as at first, (when there was no pur∣pose of publishing them) they were written, without any al∣teration, vnder the publike censure of the world; hoping, yea earnestly desiring, men would bring rather humble and hungring hearts, than curious and catching heads to the reading of them; that so they may indeed truely profite by them. As I shall vnderstand these ruder, old∣er, and hastier Meditations are accepted of, I shall bee encouraged to greater, further, and fresher paines, in publish∣ing soone after, what, I hope,

will not bee vnprofitable to the Church of GOD, whose Ser∣uant I doe professe my selfe, as also,

From my House, in New-Castle vpon Tine:
Ian. 12. 1623.
