VErtuous Gentlewomen, It was the respect which I owed unto your father, and to your fathers house, that first moved me to translate Ge∣rards Prayers, and being translated to dedicate them unto you: But the Stationer (whom I would not name, because he is dead; and yet I must name, for fear lest by my silence I may seem to wrong others) Richard Jackson of Fleetstreet, to whose trust I committed the book to be printed, usurped the dedication, and obtruded it upon a Religious Countesse, whose name for honour I conceal: Hereup∣on

I committed it unto the presse at Cambridge, being first purged from innumerable errates. Since Jacksons death, the copie it seems came to one Williams his hands Stationer in Popes-head-alley: With him I had conference as one desirous to restore unto you what of right belonged unto you: But in stead of satisfaction, I received nothing but ill language. To conclude, I bade him, if he thought good, go on to do you wrong: but I promised withall that you should finde one to do you right as long as I lived. In part I hope I have made good my promise: If you accept of this my service as a scholars New-yeares-gift (for so the time of the Edition makes it) I have my desire, and shall alwayes remain

From Kings Colledge in Cambridge
