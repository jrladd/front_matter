May it please Your Highness:
THese Papers con∣cerning
His Ma∣jesties
Right and

Propriety to His Domi∣nion
on the Brittish seas,
do here most Humbly
Addresse Themselves to
Your Highness Most Il∣lustrious
Hand, and Sub∣mit
Themselves as much
to the Affability of Your
Candour, as they implore
the Greatnesse of Your
protection, to which they
are Encouraged both by
Reason and Religion;
for Your Highness being
the Great Instrument
which all along attended
the Divine Providence,

in Restoring His Majesty
to His Own, both by Sea
and Land, and in Esta∣blishing
Religion as well
as Loyalty; The same
Reason doth perswade
me, that these Assertions
may be Acceptable to
You, and that your
Highness will vouch-safe
Your Patronage to that
Subject which you so
Happily and Heroically
have Effected; and for
which all Ages shall Re∣nown
your Memory.

May it please Your Highness:
The Profits which the
Dutch have made by
their Fishing on the Eng∣lish
Seas, are as vast as
their Ingratitude is abo∣minable,
which with an
Elaborate Malice they
have Expressed by their
manifold out-rages com∣mitted
in the East and
West-Indies, where (that
no Villany may be un∣practised)
to Improve
their Interests, they have
added Hypocrisie to
their Avarice, and to

their Ambition, Murder.
The Innocent Blood
which they have spilt,
doth cry aloud for Ven∣geance;
Nor can the guilt
of it fall asleep, but will be
lodged in the Memories
of Righteous Men, and
kept awake by the Indu∣stry
of faithfull Histori∣ans;
and by this Ruder
Pen of him who is,
(May it please Your Highness,)
