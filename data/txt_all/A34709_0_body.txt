SIR,
THe long interest of Friendship, and
nearness of Neighbourhood, which
gave you the opportunity of con∣versing
often with that worthy Baronet, who
was Author of these ensuing Discourses, induced
me to this Dedicatory Address. Among the
Greeks and Romans (who were the two Lu∣minaries
that first diffused the rayes of Know∣ledge
and Civility through these North-west
Clymes,) He was put in the rank of the best sorts
of Patriots, who preserv'd from putrefaction and
the rust of Time, the Memory and Works of
Vertuous Men, by exposing them to open light
for the generall Good; Therefore I hope not to
deserve ill of my Country, that I have published

to the World these choice notions of that learned
Knight Sir Robert Cotton, who for his exact
recerchez into Antiquity, hath made himself
famous to Posterity.
Plutarch in writing the lives of Others,
made his own everlasting; So an Antiquary
while he feels the pulse of former Ages, and
makes them known to the present, renders
Himself long-liv'd to the future.
There was another inducement that mov'd
me to this choice of Dedication, and it was the
high respects I owe you upon sundry obligations,
and consequently the desire I had that both the
present, and after times might bear witness,
how much I am, and was
Sir,
3. Nonas April. 1651.
