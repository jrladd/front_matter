Honoured Sirs,
WEre not your Candor and Clemency as eminently di∣stributed to every Criminal, as are
Your piercing Judgments to disco∣ver him, he must be possess'd with a more than shivering Extasy, that should presume to accost You with the present Dedication: For though the following Paper ap∣pears in great Necessity of such Patrons, yet that it should be pe∣tition'd by so perfect a Stranger, and that without a Licence, might create a Wonder beyond the be∣lief of the most Credulous. Not∣withstanding, Ingratitude having been ever esteem'd the Epitome of all Vices, and, consequently, the Guilt of the former, being much more eligible, with all imaginable Submission, I crave Leave to pre∣sent You with the grateful Senti∣ments of the Kingdom for Your Impartial Administration, whereby You have taken a Charter of the
Peoples Hearts, never to be can∣cell'd.
I shall not be guilty of an Addi∣tional Presumption, by descending to Particulars, but most humbly implore a Pardon for subjoining, that Your Endeavours have been vigo∣rous beyond a President, in Your equally asserting His Majesty's and the Countries Rights, by encoura∣ging any thing that has but the Tincture of Probity and Ingenuity, and wholly exploding and discoun∣tenancing that Rigor, which has been usually perpetrated under the specious Pretext of Law: These are so publickly known, and such uncommon Actions, as will be Register'd in every un∣prejudic'd Breast, till Time it self shall have an End; by which we
find You acquiesce in the Opinion of the Great Agesilaus, who dying in his Voyage from Egypt, forbad any Statue in memorial of Him, saying, He had left those Actions behind him, as would render it whol∣ly insignificant.
These being such great Verities as admit not of a Contradiction, we have Reason to be assur'd, That by Your extraordinary Ma∣nagement, the Excise, like the A∣thenian Ship, by being so often mended, will in a short time ar∣rive to that perfection, that there never will be found a rotten or imperfect Stick: And therefore pray, That Health (which gives the only Relish to all Your out∣ward Enjoyments) and Prosperity, may be Your constant Slaves and
Lacquies; That a continu'd Suc∣cession of all Terrestrial Felicities may ever court You; And that You may ever move as Refulgent Stars in the Orb You are plac'd, for the encouragement of Ingenuity, and destruction of every Action that might carry the Epithet of Ill: And althô 'tis usual to wish You many Years, yet I shall wish You but ONE:
—Sed Annus
Hic, mea si valeant Vota, Platonis erit.
