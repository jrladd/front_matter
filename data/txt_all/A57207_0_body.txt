I Have read of some of the Saints of old, that have prayed for life, as David and Hezekiah; others that have desired to be dissolved, as Paul and Eliah; yet those that desired to dye, had abundance of contentment here, and the others that laboured for life, had assurance of glory hereafter. Alas my life was not worthy the name of life, 'twas not a life, 'twas but a piece of childhood throwne away; yet in my sicknesse I desired to escape death, by dying daily, since I have been taught, that he that is dead while he lives, shall live when he dyes.
How direfull are the thoughts of Death! how grievous the remembrance of the Grave! yet when we call to minde how it was sweetned by our deare Saviour, methinkes
Death is not so dreadfull, nor Life so desire∣able: Death is but a freedome from danger, and the bank of Rottennesse, is now a bed of Roses, where Innocency may dwell secure, nothing assaults us there; I have thought to dye, is lesse than to be borne, 'tis a quiet resting from all Iniquity, a conclusion of trou∣bles, an end of fiery trialls, where in dust we shall be lost a while, as is the Sun, that must permit the base and sordid Earth to smother up his Glory for a night, that the next mor∣ning when he arises, as from a bed of Roses burnish'd in all his bravery, he might be the more wondred at; so when our hearts are pure, and when our sighs are past, and when our griefes are gone, and when our wiped eyes shall weep no more, then nor will it be long) we shall be snatcht up from the conversations of Sin∣ners, to the habitations of Angels, where Mor∣tality shall be swallowed up of Life.
May it please your Honour, I thought to have done something in answer to Free-will, but that I wanted Free-will to doe it, therefore I have left the Matter almost as imperfect as the Author, yet had I had time, I had either added more, or have done this better.

As it is, I humbly offer it to your Honour for a Memento mori, that when we put off our garments of Mortality, we may launch into the gulf of ever blessed Eternity; I meane at that time, when we have time to say no more, but in manus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum.
