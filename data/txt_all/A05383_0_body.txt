MAy it please you, Cha∣rity
is the great office
of Christianity and
humanity: for the
lawes of God and na∣ture
inioyne all men
the workes of common profite. There∣fore

is action better then contemplati∣on,
because this doth respect our pri∣uate
onely, but that doth giue it selfe
into the common Treasure of mens
prosperities.
This cause hath made mee vnder∣take
these paines. For though I am yet
vnprofest in any particular place of
charge, eyther in the Church or state,
whereby I might imploy (my little) to
more aduantage, yet my very being a
Christian doth challenge from me the
best performance I can, for the commō
good.
The reasons of my dedication are
these. First, there is non of you to whom
I owe not some respect of duty, but to
you two Principals, principall respects;
the whole Kingdome being in debt to
your labours, which God make pros∣perous
to his glory; and for the honour
of (this our little world) great Brittaine.
Againe, I did purpose you a booke,
which might haue done some seruice
to your princely charge, and in whose
argument I did professe to bee much
more able then in this. That beeing

(for a time) stayed from printing, by
their authority in the State, that may
commaund mee, I haue presumed with
this (such as it is) intreating you to giue
it your allowance of fauour, because I
freely cast it into the common Trea∣sure.
God make all your labours respect
the glory of his name, that you may
liue in the honour of his seruice, and
obtaine the reward of faithfulnesse.
