AS you have been the Captains in our Chanels,
To take those Pirates, and bold Water-Spaniels,
Which to their cost did here so lately come
In strong Armadoes, from the Church of Rome,
For to destroy us: And our Lands to make
A Legal Prize, unto that Stygian Lake
Of bloody Tyber: And to drain from hence
Millions of Treasure, by Saint Peter's Pence,
For which Attempt your Loyalty now Rings
In sweet tun'd Anthems to the King of Kings,
For raising up such Noble Peers to stand
Now in the Breach, against that Hellish Band,
And will remain for everlasting praise
Unto your Honours, who all have won the Baies,
Although the flattering, huffing, ranting Tory Crew
Of State-Satyricks, so bespatter you,
Your Names shall live, when their's shall die and rot,
Your Coat shall shine, when their's shall have a blot;

You shall be great, when they shall be forlorn;
You shall be lov'd, when they the Nations scorn;
You shall be Gold, when they shall be but Dross;
You shall triumph, when they may mount a Cross.
Courage, brave Heroes, now some breezing Gales
Will make their Captains strike their main Top-sails,
And may ere long surrender to the Whigs
Their Tory Roary plotting Bird-lime Twigs,
Which have stuck fast unto that Interest,
Which wise men call the Scarlet-coloured Beast.


Since things are so transacted now in France,
The Tories now will tack to Monsieur Prance,
And bless Nat. Thompson, that true Romish Elf,
Who now doth Print, that Godfrey hang'd himself
Although the first, who did the Truth declare,
That he was Murder'd from the Roman Chair;
And he that trebles each Dissenters spot,
Marks not one word, of this most scandalous blot
Unto the Justice of our English Nation,
For Hanging men, only for Recreation)
And rather lean unto that Popish Fry,
And well he may, because he knows they Lie
Much like himself; and Birds all of a Feather,
Do love to flutter, and to flock together;
Yet these be Men the Tories count so Loyal,
Damn us for Dogs, upon the least denial
Of this Sham Truth (Oh Heavens!) what Men are those
Who cann't distinguish between Doves and Crows.
Between bold Traitors, and true Loyal Peers,
Between good Subjects, and those Leather Ears,
Who now do trot from House to House, to try
Who will Abhor, and who for Liberty;
The first they mark, as Loyal Sons of State,
The next they seal, oft with a broken Pate,
In Loyal Duty, with the rest of those,
Who will Abhor our King and Kingdoms Foes,

And will stand by them not with Iss and Ands,
Or Forty thousand of High Tory Flands.
Like the Dulmano Tribe, which hums and haws,
Instead of Preaching, only do pick Straws,
And tears Dissenters with their Lockarom Jaws:
Or like that Monsieur with his Vahant Men,
Went up an Hill, and so came down agen:
No, we'l stand by them with our Lives and Lands,
So far as they lift up our Legal Hands,
For to support our English Monarchy
Against all Popish, and French Tyranny.


Unto your Honours, I these Lines present,
In patient Hopes, that our next Parliament,
Will search the bottom of those Sham Intrigues,
From French, from English, and from Irish Teagues;
I dare not boast the strength of this my Muse,
Like soaring Laureat, who doth so abuse
Your Grace, your Honours, and his Country too;
He brands his Country in dispraising you.
And though his Satyrs in them have no weight,
Yet for his pains deserves a broken Pate.
Small Chicken am I, not yet Pen-feather'd for
To steer a Ship, or board a Man of War;
Yet I have ventur'd from my Bedlam shore
One of their tall Ships with my Plumes to gore;
And if they pass but through his Aged side
(Although I steer both against Wind and Tide)
And chance to fall into his Powder-Room,
Whigs may then write to Miss Joanna Broom,
To let her know of Towzer's sad Disaster,
And to provide for him a cooling Plaister:
If this won't do, let Joan turn him to Grass,
To nab some Thistles with the braying Ass;
Or else six spoon-fulls in our Cupping-glass
Of Aqua fortis, and strong Hellebore,
Mixt well together, take for this, I am sure,
Probatum est, 'twill either kill or cure;

And though of late he hath with Rippon Spur,
Endeavour'd much, my Credit for to slur,
In his Remarks, because he knows I am
In Hand and Heart a true bred English Man;
Yet if your Honours patronize these Lines
(Which he will Print, are dull distracted Rimes)
I then do hope, these honest Bedlam strains,
Will be a means to wipe off all his stains,
And in due time Reward me for my pains.



(Most Noble Peers)
