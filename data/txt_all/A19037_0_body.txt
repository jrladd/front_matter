RIght Worshipfull, al∣though Gods word can countenance it selfe, and needes no shelter from the arme of flesh: yet experience shewes, that not
 onely the writings of the most, but even some of those sacred bookes which were breathed from heaven, have beene dedicated to renowned Saints on earth. If that hea∣venly Evangelist, dedicated hisuke 1: 3: Gospell, and Treatise of the holy Acts of the Apostles un∣toActs 1: 1: that most excellent Theo∣philus: And that eminent pil∣lar of the Church, directed2 Iohn 1: 1: that heavenly Epistle to that elect Lady whom he loved in the truth: In imitation where∣of I have made bold to devote this poore mite (in compari∣son of that rich treasure) unto
