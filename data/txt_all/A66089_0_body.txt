Madam,
THis figurative Star presented to your view (no sooner formed generally distin∣guishable to our Horison) becoming suddenly obscured by the Eclipses of those greater Lights, from whom essentially it should have had both Influence and Lustre, hath mov'd concealed many years; till now by the Reflection of your affinitive eminence

in Vertue and Beauty; It hath presu∣med to assume a Being more commu∣nicable. Reject not, Madam, the Ac∣cess hereof, because transacted to your hand by so despicable an Introdu∣cer. It soly is your Property, not only by the advantage of Worth (in civil rights of Honour and Respect) your Present: but by the advantage of Simi∣litude (in rule of Dialect) your proper Attribute. The pretended perfection of Astraea's Vertue and Beauty intitled her to a celestial Figure: the essential Graces whereof in you, shall really translate you to so transcendent a Glory, that those refulgent Lights are thereof but imperfect Shadows. Those Ob∣jects of true Love figured in her so hap∣pily to encounter as perfect a subject, to receive their Impressions, and mu∣tually communicate the like effects to the forming of one mysterious Union: are visibly exprest in the admired, ra∣vishing, and harmonious agreement

Disdain not, Madam, her Re∣semblance, in respect of the Humility figured in her condition; since 'tis the perfect'st, and most proper Note of her Nobility: which (where divided) shew the Original of such ostentive

Attributes (with what glorious Titles soever illustrated) had but a reproach∣ful Acquisition. And although your vertues need no other Monument but their own perfection to constitute their Memory eternal: yet since Fortune is the chiefest Agitator in humane Occur∣rences, whose Power is still exercis'd in opposition of such eminent Facul∣ties, your Counterfeit (in Astraea) may happily outlast your marble Epitaph or Figure: If so, It soly is the Crown and Glory of his Enterprise, whose va∣nity can aspire to no higher Honour, then to survive the Malice of his Fate in his unworthy Ministry to your Fame, under the Title of
