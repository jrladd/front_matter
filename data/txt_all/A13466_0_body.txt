Right Honourable Madam:
AS the Graces, the
Vertues, the Sen∣ses,
and the Muses,
are emblemed, or
alluded to your noble sex, and

as all these haue ample resi∣dence
in your worthy disposi∣tion:
To whō then but to your
selfe, being a Lady in goodnes
compleat, should I commit the
patronage of the memory of
the great Lady of Ladyes, Mo∣ther
to the high and mighty
Lord of Lords? And though I
(a Taylor) haue not apparell'd

her in such garments of elocu∣tion
and ornated stile, as befits
the glory and eminency of the
least part of her Excellency,
yet I beseech your Honor to
accept her for her own worth,
and her Sonnes worthinesse:
which Sonne of hers, by his
owne merits, and the power∣full
mercy of his Father, I

heartily implore to giue your
Honour a participation of his
gracious Mothers eternall fe∣licitie.
