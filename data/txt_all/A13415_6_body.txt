RIght worthy Knight, when first this Booke I writ
To You, I boldely Dedicated it:
And hauing now enlarg'd both Prose and Rime,
To you I offer it the second time.
To whom should I these sorrowes recommend,
But vnto You, the Cities Noble Friend?
I know, you are much grieued with their Griefe,
And would aduenture Life for their reliefe:
To You therefore these Lines I Dedicate,
Wherein, their Sorrowes partly I relate,
I humbly craue acceptance at your hand:
And rest
