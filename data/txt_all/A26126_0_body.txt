My LORD,
WHen I at first drew out a Scheme of the ensuing Discourse, I had the Honour of your Lord∣ships Approbation and Encouragement to proceed upon those Topicks, which caused me to sequester the vacant hours I could steal from my other oc∣casions, that I might employ them on these Meditations; which having brought to some perfection (and received the concurrent consent of a great Prelate of this Realm, who gave himself the trouble to peruse them, and me the ho∣nour to recommend them as worthy of publick view) I could not in the least dispute to whom I should dedicate them; for not only your Lordship's condescension at first in advising, but indeed those many other Obligations which your Honour hath been pleased to lay upon me, most justly challenge
them, and even the greatest of my Services: Neither am I so fond to ima∣gine that the offering of these to your Lordship's Feet doth cancel any former debt, but rather I cannot but be sensible that if your Lordship design to patronize and shelter them from the storms of the World, it will be infinitely increased; I shall have the deeper score to pay, and the greater pardon to beg for this presumption.
But I doubt not but that your Lord∣ships good nature runs parallel with your other Vertues (of which the World is a copious Index) and therefore shall hope to obtain it, together with your Honour's Acceptance of this small Ac∣knowledgment. That your Lordship may enjoy a long uninterrupted state of Health, whereby you may be able to assist His Majesty in his great and momentous Counsels, and (as your Ho∣nour hath began) may continue to be a prop and support to this our totter∣ing Church, and at length go late into Heaven, are the hearty Wishes and con∣stant Prayers of
From Newcastle upon Tine,
Nov. 2. 1682.
