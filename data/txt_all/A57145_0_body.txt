SIR,
HAving committed these Epistles to the
Press, I was horribly put to't for a
Patron—I thought of some great
Lord, or some Angelique Lady; but then again
consider'd I should never be able to adorn my
Dedication with benign Beams, coruscant Rayes,
and the Devil and all of Influence. At last I
heard my good Friend Mr. Fairbeard was
come to Town—nay then—all's well enough.
To you therefore I offer this English Ovid,
to whom you may not be unaptly compar'd in seve∣ral
parcels of your Life and Conversation; only
with this exception, That you have nothing of his
Tristibus about you.

'Tis you who Burlesque all the Foppery and
conceited Gravity of the Age. I remember you
once told a grave affected Advocate, That he
Burlesqu'd Gods Image, for God had made him
after his own Likeness, but he made himself look
like an Ass.
Upon the whole matter I am very well sa∣tisfy'd
in my Choice of you for my Judge; if you
speak well of the Book, 'tis all I desire, and the
Bookseller will have reason to rejoyce: tho'
by your approbation you may draw upon your self
a grand Inconvenience; for perhaps you may too
often have Songs, Sonnets, Madrigals, and an
innumerable Army of Stanza's obtruded upon
you by
Sir,
Octob. 28th,
1680.
