AL that I have to require of thee is, That wheresoever my Stile or Principles Strike out, and keep not within the same Bounds, that the most Judicious Author of the Na∣ked Truth hath all along observed; he may not there∣fore be traced. He could best have writ a Defence proportionable to his own Subject; had he esteemed it neeessary, or that it was decent for him to have enter'd the Pit with so Scurrilous an Animadverter. But I thought it a piece of due Civility from one of the Laities, to interesse my self for one of the Cler∣gy, who had so highly obliged the People of England. And I will answer for mine own faults, I ask thee no pardon. Nor therefore is either the Author, or any other particular Person, or any Party, to be accused, or mis-represented upon my Private Account. For the rest, neither let any particular Man, or Order, inlarge my meaning against themselves, further than in Conscience they find they are guilty. Nor let the body of Chaplains think themselves affronted. None

more esteems them, nor loves their Conversation bet∣ter than I do. They are the succeeding hope of our Church, the Youth of our Clergy; and the Clergy are the Reserve of our Christianity. Some of them, whom I know, have indeed, and do conti∣nue daily to put very Singular Obligations upon me; but I write to a Nobler , than to revenge my Petty Concernments.
Adien.
