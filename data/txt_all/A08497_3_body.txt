RIght worshipfull, It would be too tedious, to make
particuler declaration of your worshipfull fauours, from time to
time, towards me. I hauing beene hitherto altogether vnable, so
much as to make any show of thankfulnes for the same. And see∣ing
it hath pleased GOD to make you, many waies, a principall
patron of my good: by meanes whereof, I haue at length attai∣ned
to somwhat, whereby I may manifest my selfe, a well affected
member of the common wealth. I haue thought it my duetie, to
present vnto your worship, these first fruits of my simple skill. Beseeching you, fauourablie
to accept them, as the indeauors of a yong wit, and tokens of a thankfull mind. And be∣cause
I haue alwaies knowne you a fauourer of all good exercises, and namely of Musicke:
I am imbouldned, to craue your worshipfull Patronage of these my labours; whereby I
shall bee incouraged, to indeauor my selfe with all diligence, to put in practise some
others, that may deserue better acceptation. Thus leauing them to
your delightfull recreation, and your worship to the protection
of the most high, I humbly take my leaue.
