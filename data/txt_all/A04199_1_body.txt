Right Worshipfull:
IT is no small fauour of God to bee made an instrument of o∣thers good: which is either by our owne free donations, or by disposing of others gifts: In the one is manifested our cha∣ritie in giuing of our owne: and in the other our faithful∣nesse, in truely performing the will of the dead. And to vse the Apostles words, What haue we that wee haue not receiued? not simply for our owne vse, but for the good of others also: Therefore, that wee may not be found vncharitable, we must giue of our owne, nor vnfaithfull, we must be true in bestowing of others gifts: and then we shall bee twice blessed with Iacob, and haue a double portion with Beniamin. But to bring this home to the doores of your consciences: Yea, Worshipfull company of Cloth-workers, for whome I in particular am bound to pray, not so much for your owne donation vnto mee, as your faithfull pay∣ing of that which others haue giuen for the mainte∣nance of religion. Of whom I may say, as Dauid did

of Ierusalem, Many excellent things are spoken of thee, thou Citie of God: so many excellent things are done by you: Yea, worthy and worship full Cloth∣workers, with Dorcas you make coates to clothe the naked: with the Shunammite, you prepare houses for the harbourlesse to dwell in: with Obadiah, you relieue the Prophets, and much more of this nature, which to set downe in order, would both spend much pa∣per, and also a wearinesse to my hand: it is sufficient, God knowes them, and will one day reward the same. I speake not this to make you proud, but as my duetie to you, and to encourage others to the same. And so I will conclude with the saying of the: Apostle, yee haue, and doe well, yet I beseach you to increase more and more: whereby your name may bee more spread on earth, and your glory greater enlarged in heauen.
