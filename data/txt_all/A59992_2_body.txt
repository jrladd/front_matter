SIR,
MAny years are vanished,
and a period, not onely
of the Scene, but more
considerable revoluti∣ons
have pass'd, since
I had the happiness to
be first known to you. I read excellent
Characters of you, when you writ but a
small Letter, and though my observati∣ons,
like seeds, were not cherished (by
the fault of time) to a maturity, yet they
begat in me such great respect to your
person, then budding with honour, and
expectation, that now after so long ab∣sence,
I find them not extinguished; and
howsoever at the first complexion, I may
appear bold, in this hasty interruption,
yet your candour will be so far in my

defence, that I have presumed thus, ra∣ther
to let you know I can still honour
you, than unsatisfie my self, by neglecting
the first opportunity of presenting my
service. Sir, it is a piece, which perhaps
you have seen in the active represent∣ment;
the estimation it gained from
thence, will be short of that grace it shall
derive from your acceptance, by which
you will shew, how still you dare re∣tain
your nobleness, and by renewing
your smile upon me, encourage me to
write my self
