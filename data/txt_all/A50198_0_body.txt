TO Thee, One-Only-Oneness, I Direct
My Weak Desires, and Works; please to Protect
Both Them, and Me; For Thou alone art Able,
(And one but Thee) to make us Acceptable
Vnto the World. —
I am not of That Catholick Belief,
(I mean the Roman's Faith) who seek Relief
(At th' Second Hand): from Saints; but I Thus take
My Freedom, and (sans Complement) Thus make
My Seeming-Bold-Address: Not Judging It
A Crime with Thee; but rather count It fit;
Part of my Duty call'd for, which I owe
Vnto Thy Goodness; Therefore Thus It show.
I've wonder'd much, to see what Great Ado▪
Men make, to Dedicate their Works, unto
High Mortals; who Themselves can no way Save,
From th' Slan'drous Tongues, of every Envious Knave.
Thou (only) art The Able-True-Protector;
Oh be my Shield, Defender, and Director,
Then sure we shall be Safe. —
Thou know'st, (O Searcher of All Hearts) how I,
With Right-Downright-Sincere-Sincerity,
Have Longed Long, to do some ttle Good,
(According to the Best I understood)
With Thy Rich Tallent, though by me made Poor;
For which I Grieve, and will do so no more,
By Thy Good Grace Assisting, which I do
Most Humbly beg for: Oh Adjoyn It, to
My Longing-Ardent-Soul; And have Respect
To This my weak Endeavour; and Accept
(In This Great Mercy) both of It, and Me,
Ev'n as We Dedicate Our Selves to Thee.
