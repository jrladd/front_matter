Madam,
I Have, according to your Order, Perus'd at length Mr. Samuell (your hopeful Son's) Metri∣cal Paraphrase of the whole Book of Psalmes; which hath struck me into a twofold Admiration; one, of the Subject he chos'd to Treat of; that leaving all Youthful and low Arguments, (suting most (as

may be conceiv'd) with his present yeers) Eagle like, he soar'd aloft, and pitched upon a Theme sublime and altogether Divine, discovering hereby a Spirit Angelicall, rather then Humane: The other is, his In∣genious, and also Ingenuous Expres∣sions, void of affectation in a mat∣ter so profound and deep. Madam, these first Fruits, in years so tender, bespeak a plentiful Harvest of high∣er things for the future, than he can undertake to name, Who is
Madam,

King street in Co∣vent Garden,
Sep∣tember the 3d. 1660.
