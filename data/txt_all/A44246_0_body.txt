Noble Sr.
THe Remembrance of Just Delight de∣lights; which as it is an acknowledg'd Truth in Nature; so especially in the nature of knowledge. This at this time of Joy and Happinesse for our Returne to these blessings, under our greatest blessing, our most gratious Soveraigne, aptly prompts to a Repetition of those Studies, to which the Love and Prudence of your Eminent Father promoted your Youth and my Industry about fourty years since, in your Acade∣mical Institution. The Improvement whereof as your Wisdome has showed in additions of Persevering Loyal∣ly, weighty Employment and Nineteen Years Absence from your dear Country: So in the Importunity of the late warres and opinions, some addition, I have made of After-studies in the defence of Religion and Arts. With a necessary variety therefore from the singularities of the Divine Power and Wisdome, I heere present the Thea∣er of Providence, in some things strange, in All war∣rantable, by testimony of Men famous among Heathens
and Christians. Which diligence may bee to some a Di∣rection for Choise and Censure; to Others no uncourteou Recollection of their Owne Thoughts. And as they were a Summer's recreations of my Age, cast thus into the Fashion of Ancient Memorials; so I intend them not as a Laborious Summe of knowledge; but only, as in the Li∣berty and Pleasure of a garden, as some more; pleasing flowers cropp'd for the Complement and Enchridion  a Posy: which by the Novelty may last a Day, and by the Art of Friendship, may, as Friendship should, outla the vanity of the Flower. Yet as this pleases by Inter∣mission, the seeming Neglect renewing the delight, I but present, not obirude, to the leasure of Your great af∣faires, respectfully remaining.
