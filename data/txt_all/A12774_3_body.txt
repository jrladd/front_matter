MOst braue and bountifull La: for so excellent fauours as I haue receiued at your sweet handes, to offer these fewe leaues as in recompence, should be as to offer flowers to the Gods for their diuine benefites. Therefore I haue determined to giue my selfe wholy to you, as quite abandoned from my selfe, and absolutely vowed to your seruices: which in all right is euer held for full recompence of debt or damage to haue the person yeelded. My person I wot wel how little worth it is. But the faithfull minde & humble zeale which I beare vnto your La: may perhaps be more of price, as may please you to ac∣count and vse the poore seruice thereof; which ta∣keth glory to aduance your excellent partes and noble vertues, and to spend it selfe in honouring you: not so much for your great bounty to my self,

which yet may not be vnminded; nor for name or kindreds sake by you vouchsafed, beeing also re∣gardable; as for that honorable name, which yee haue by your braue deserts purchast to your self, & spred in the mouths of al mē: vvith vvhich I haue also presumed to grace my verses, & vn∣der your name to cōmend to the vvorld this smal Poëme, the vvhich beseeching your La: to take in vvorth, and of all things therein according to your vvonted graciousnes to make a milde con∣struction, I humbly pray for your happines.
