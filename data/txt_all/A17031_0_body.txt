THe giuer of all goodnesse, Right worshipfull, hauing, promised that the best good things, being first sought and preferred, the second Luke 12. necessary for life shall neuer faile; I haue accordingly endeuored to my poore talent, and leasure, together with others, to wish the speciall good of these poore Children, which by God his prouidence are cast vpon your louing care and fatherly protection: desiring that in priuate euen from their infancy, they might be seasoned with some taste of piety and humanity, which might make for their better good when they are
 in publike to be further trained vp in the practise of Religion and Arts: for man new born is like a wild Asses coult; & folly is na∣turally in the heart of a child, vntil by edu∣cation & discipline it be made fit to beare & bring forth better fruit. If any good shal come hereof to that end; I haue my desire, as the chiefest good which I know is here intended in their fostering and educating in this Christian gouernment; which hath and shall cause many prayers and praises to God for your worships, that you may be had in an euerlasting remembrance, and the whole benefit in the end to redound vnto you and others, who haue ruled with faith∣fulnes, & distributed with cheerefulnes; when God shall haue the glory, Religion the credit, our King the honor, the Citie and whole State the profit, and your selues comfort of conscience, & blessing of peace and plentie, which the God of peace and loue graunt vnto you all, Amen.
