RIght worshipful, hauing by chance happened on this Pamflet, comming vnto my hands both without name and orderly begin∣ning: I did not onely peruse it my self (accor∣ding to my simple skil) but shewed it also vnto some of my freends: of whose learning & Iudgement very many haue good opinion, and beeing therto sufficiently willing of my self, I was by them and others exhorted to publish the same in print, for that it seemed to containe nothing els but holesome diet, sauced with honest mirth and pleasant pastimes: and interlaced with pithy and effectual exam∣ples, tending vnto the aduaūcement of vertue and sup∣pression of vice, a fit meane to delight and recreate the weake, & specially the ouer weryed spirits of Studients. Now calling vnto my remembrance (which I cannot forget) the manifolde benefits & curtesies at all times by your worship bestowed on me & mine, aswel in callīg me (moste vnworthy) not a few times vnto your table, as otherwise, the least part wherof I am not able of my self to recōpence: my good wil not wanting, but mine abilitie fayling. I haue now presumed to offer this poore present vnto you, comming from an vnfained hart, partely the

trauaile of another man, but the testimony of my harty affection, hoping that your worship wil accept it in the better part, the rather because I haue perceiued you a∣mong other graue and waightie matters (aswel of Reli¦gion as otherwise) to solace your self and others at your Table, with seemly mirth in opportunities vttered, ac∣cording to the knowledge and capacitie of those your poore neighbours and others with whom your bourd is al∣waies furnished, either cōcerning the qualities of meats, or their vsages in forrain cōtries, to the great delectation of the hearers: To the which purpose, there is much mat∣ter set down in this present work, as also to other effect, wherein if there shalbe any thing founde, not conueni∣ent for your learned view and seuere Iudgement: I harte¦ly craue your worships pardon: protesting, that the same is not written for so graue eares, but desirous to please all sortes in honest delight: I thought it good not to leaue out any thing, but to admonish, that who so shall not so well like of some trifling tales of this book, in the fourth part, he may sufficiētly recreate himself in the other .iii. parts.
Thus much hauing been ouer bolde to vtter my minde vnto your worship, presuming vpon your accustomed hu∣manitie, there remaineth no more, but that I commend you vnto the tuition of the almightie: who alwaies keepe you and yours, and send you now a mery new yeer and ma∣ny, to his good pleasure and glory. Amen.
