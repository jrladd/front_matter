Most Royall Soveraigne,
I Doe not presume to sore so high; in Respect of the worth of my la∣bours above others; for had they beene penned by a farre more ex∣quisite Author, yet might a much inferior patronage (notwithstan∣ding) have beene a worthy fa∣vour: I am I doe confesse altogether unworthy

under such a patronage to purchase favour to a popular eye: how then shall I crave favour of your Sacred Majestie to deeme a gracious eye up∣on me. To prostrate these before your Highnesse, as a present, they proceede from too inferior an Author; Or as counsells, it were too great pre∣sumption. Yet your gratious, meeke, and pious Soveraignty emboldeneth me to devote the fruit of my meane labours to your Princely eys, because (though weake, yet) faithfull, which though it cannot bee good enough to deserve that gratious countenance of my Royall Soveraigne, yet this I can protest, that my heart, my tongue, my hand and penne, shall be alwaies, upon all opportunities (next under God) devoted to my Royall King, and Gracious Soveraigne.
And be glad as I am able (though unworthie) to extoll Your Highnesse worthy praise.
