Worthy Friends,
TO whom can the History of West-Jersey with more Ju∣stice pertain, than to
 you the Noble and Generous Proprietors.
That was the chief Motive that inclin'd me to this Dedica∣tion, which I hope will be the more ac∣ceptable to you, be∣cause the Account of that Country is so Sincere and Candid.
I have endeavour'd (by setting forth) the great Encouragements there are) to persuade
 the Poor, the Idle, the Lazy, & the Vagabonds of these Kingdoms and of Wales to hasten thi∣ther, that they may live plentifully and happi∣ly, and I doubt not but they will hearken to it, because it is their true Interest. I have done my best endeavours to possess them and others of the great Fertility and Plenty in those Parts, which I need not repeat to you, who must needs be well ac,
 quainted with the State of that Place. That it may Flourish and mightily tend to your Advantage, as also to the Benefit of England, the hearty de∣sire of your Friend,
