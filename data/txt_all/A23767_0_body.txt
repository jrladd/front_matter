My Lord,
WHEN I consider with what reluctancies I ap∣pear thus in publick; I have all reason to suspect and fear, least this offering,

which like an unwilling Sacrifice was dragg'd to the Altar, and which hath great defects too, will be farre from propitiating either for its self or for the votary. But I must crave leave to adde, that how averse so∣ever I was to the publishing this rude Discourse, I make the De∣dication with all possible zeal, and ready cheerfulness. For I ex∣spect your Lordship to be a Pa∣tron not onely to my Sermon, but to my Subject. Such a separate eminence of virtue and of sweetness mixt together may hope to ingratiate Your Function to a Generation of men that will not yet know their



own good, but resist mercy, and are not content to be happy. And for my self, Your Lordships great goodness and obligingness hath encourag'd me, not onely to hope that You will pardon all the mis∣carriages of what I now pre∣sent, but also to presume to shelter it and my self under your Lordships Name and Command, and to honour my self before the world by this address, and by assuming the relation of.
My Lord,
