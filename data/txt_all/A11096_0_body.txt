ALbeit (right Worshipfull) that the art of Poesie is in sort dealt withall, as Cacus once vsed Hercules oxen, when he drew them backewards vp the hill: being customarily in these daies wrested and turned to the fooleries of Loue, and such like base subiect of fancies abortiue births, conuer∣ting Poetries imploiment to follies vse, and wit ill spent runnes violent that way, with the current of errour. Yet hath it a natiue diuine off-spring and issue, wherof partaking kindly, floates with a calme tempered gale from all

miscarying wracke, to the harbour of a quiet applause. The vpright and best approoued censure I presume gains your Worships ver∣tuous allowance, to whose wisdome and gra∣uitie associate with an heroicall sprite, I dedi∣cate affections testimony by these vnpolished lines, crauing your fauourable fault-shadow∣ing view, if in the manner any thing appeare defectiue, trusting that as a fruitfull tree the more it is fruitladen, the more it declineth, so your plenteous accōplished vertues wil hum∣ble them in daining to accept the loue I reue∣rence you withall: wishing your Wor∣ship Worlds prosperitie, and Hea∣uens happinesse.
