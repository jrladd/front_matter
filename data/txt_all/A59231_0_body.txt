THAT a Discourse of this na∣ture should be addrest to Your Ladyship, if it seems extraordi∣nary, it ought to argue a Judg∣ment more than common in Her who is chiefly entitled to the perusal of it. The Generality of your Sex, through the un∣lucky disadvantage of their Education, use to rellish nothing of a harder dige∣stion, than are the Delicacies of a Ro∣mance, or at best, a piece of History: Nay, many of the more knowing Sex who wear the repute of Learned, do hardly, even in this improoving Age, so advance above the Sophister and the Pedant, as to fancy any thing exceeds a

pretty Probability trick't up with flowers of Rhetorick and gay Language; And, many of the greatest Wits (if those may be justly called so who profess they know nothing) have so unmann'd themselves by Scepticism, that the solidest Prin∣ciples in matters of this kind seem to them meer Air, and the closest Con∣sequences only worth answering by loose Drollery: As if the Author of Nature (I fear I do these Men too much right in thinking they hold any such) had intended indeed to permit us the exercise of our Man-hood in Lines and Numbers, but in things of infinitely highr Concern had ordered us to be  that is, as if Christ had erect∣ed a  to educate and dispose Man∣kind towards Eternal Happiness; and,  done, would not so much as  know the way to it. Now,  Your self should be held  to penetrate and comprehend Discourses which pretend to a severity of Reason, rescuing thus your own Sex,

from the imputation of inability for such performances, and condemning the greatest part of ours, is indeed a won∣der if we consider the Generality of the world; but none at all if we consider Your self. Blush not, Madam, You are not singular in this: Many other excel∣lent Heroinae begin to get above their dull circumstances and the vogue of the World, and own the glorious reproach of entertaining their best faculty, Rea∣son, about the most noble and most pro∣fitable Subjects. The high value you have for the sacred inviolableness of Catholick Faith, Your earnest desire to render Faith lively and efficacious in your self, by making out more and more to your thoughts how absolutely certain the Grounds of it are; the Confidence You have in Gods Goodness not to deny us a clear, easie, and short way to make manifest this Certainty to our selves, and others; These good dispositions of Your Will, give Your excellent Under∣standing such an attentiveness to the

Proofs Faith stands under, that I had fail'd your expectation, and writ in a way much below You, had I taken any other than I have here done; that is, to begin with the bottom-Principles, and derive thence by a continued line of consequences my main Conclusion. Had I produc'd Scripture-proofs, or Quotations from any Authority of Fa∣thers or Councils to evince the Point in hand, Your piercing wit would have made this smart demand in behalf of my Readers, that since none of those is a First Principle, and so evident to all that heat them alledg'd, I ought for their satisfaction make out by evident Reason, that my Interpretation of Scri∣pture could not fail to hit upon the right sence, or those Authorities possibly mistake or mislead; since no Authori∣ty deserves any Assent farther than Reason gives it to deserve: So that still I was forc'd, if I would appear be∣fore You, to take this very Method I have here pursued; that is, to suppose

nothing, but prove all things that can possibly be questioned in this affair.
As for the following Discourse, I only say, that I could heartily wish Learned Writers of what Judgement soever, would think fit to take the same short concluding Method, and go about to settle some other Ground or Rule of Faith; and thence, by shewing who adhere to, who reject that Rule, conclude evidently who are truly Faith∣ful, who not. The very attempting this, would perhaps more readily disco∣ver on whose side Truth stands, than many Books writ controver sially by way of mutual opposition; where an obsti∣nate Adversary may at pleasure still mistake wilfully every passage to make his impugnation the easier. The main∣tainers of all Errors are, as Experience teaches, very free of opposition, but only they who have certain Truth on their side will think fit to settle.
It will be wonder'd at, Madam, that I make no farther discovery of Your

Person and Quality; but You have will'd the contrary. The Obedience to which Command, obliges me by conse∣quence to conceal my own Name, and only to put instead of It, the Title of my being,
