THough the Sea doe not more ouerflow with water, than this age doth with Bookes, so as to bring forth more, it were, as if one would cast water into the Sea, or (as wee say) to light a candle at noone day to helpe the light of the Sunne: the light and Sun of the truth already being so bright and so resplendent by such writings as be already extant, as there is little hope of bringing any more cleer∣nesse to it, especially by my most dimme candle: yet I had some reasons to moue me to set it (such as it is) vpon the table, not onely by preaching now many yeares, but by this simple writing. First, my doctrine hath beene calumniated and charged by some to be erronious, and by others to be humerous; for the quitting of this I haue sent these few Papers abroad to speak for me, com∣prehending an Epitome and summe of all which I haue deliuered in my publike Teaching. I haue taught nothing at any time, which for the substance of the matter, is not contained in my sixe prin∣ciples: if there be in them errour or schisme, then I am culpable: if all here be sound and Orthodox, let men content themselues to blame the weaknesse of my teaching, but not the vnsoundnesse of my doctrine. I may erre in some particulars, for who is now priuiledged from errours, that is but a meere man (at Haereti∣cus esse nolo,) I will be no Heretick if it be declared, to me it

shall be disclaimed. Secondly, such as haue beene my hearers, ha∣uing let slip many things taught (our memories being like siues or broken pitchers) it cannot well chuse, but much is slid from them, yet by this short abridgement, they shall be holpen to re∣member much of that which before they had heard in the en∣larging of these matters Lastly, albeit others haue set forth these very things more distinctly & soundly, (for to do it more learnedly it is very easie) yet happely these things may come to some hands into which the other shall not come, and serue as a mark in their way to direct them to their country, and as halfe a loafe in stead of an whole, somewhat to refresh them in their iourney. Now to you I offer these things, how mean and homely soeuer (as they are indeed very course & meane, though not in respect of the substance of food brought you in them, for it is Gods truth; yet for the coo∣king & dressing of them) both because you haue long afforded me your presence in hearing, and oblieged me vnto you with many and great kindnesses, and for some poore recompence thereof, as also to leaue with you a remembrance of that truth which was more fully opened, I betake these things to your good curtesie and vse: hoping, as some of you were pleased to be pleased with them when they were spoken to your eares, now comming to your eyes to be read, they may proue gratefull, and through Gods blessing proue fruitfull too: Fare ye well.
