THIS present Description of a New VVorld;
was made as an Appendix to my Observations
upon Experimental Philosophy; and, having
some Sympathy and Coherence with each other, were joyn∣ed
together as Two several Worlds, at their Two Poles.
But, by reason most Ladies take no delight in Philosophi∣cal
Arguments, I separated some from the mentioned
Observations, and caused them to go out by themselves,
that I might express my Respects, in presenting to Them
such Fancies as my Contemplations did afford. The First
Part is Romancical; the Second, Philosophical; and
the Third is meerly Fancy; or, (as I may call it) Fanta∣stical.
And if (Noble Ladies) you should chance to
take pleasure in reading these Fancies, I shall account my
self a Happy Creatoress: If not, I must be content to
live a Melancholly Life in my own World; which I can∣not
call a Poor VVorld, if Poverty be only want of

Gold, and Jewels: for, there is more Gold in it, than all
the Chymists ever made; or, (as I verily believe) will
ever be able to make. As for the Rocks of Diamonds, I
wish, with all my Soul, they might be shared amongst my
Noble Female Friends; upon which condition, I would
willingly quit my Part: And of the Gold, I should desire only
so much as might suffice to repair my Noble Lord and Hus∣band's
Losses: for, I am not Covetous, but as Ambitious as
ever any of my Sex was, is, or can be; which is the cause,
That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth, or Charles the
Second; yet, I will endeavour to be, Margaret the First:
and, though I have neither Power, Time, nor Occasion, to
be a great Conqueror, like Alexander, or Cesar; yet, rather
than not be Mistress of a World, since Fortune and the
Fates would give me none, I have made One of my own.
And thus, believing, or, at least, hoping, that no Crea∣ture
can, or will, Envy me for this World of mine, I
remain,
Noble Ladies,
Your Humble Servant,
