MY LORD,
AS the Eminency of Your Virtues has render'd You the Object of Your Princes Favours: So Your pious Humility obliges all Your Inferiours to a just Veneration of Your Honourable Self. Your Lordships Generosity I have particularly experimented, and have taken this opportunity to make a publick

Acknowledgment thereof. I have not only received Favours from Your Lordship, but they have been repeated to me by the Heir of Your Virtues as well as Honours, the Lord PASTON, to whom I shall always be obliged to pay a profound Respect. The First Impression of this Book came abroad under the Shelter of that Learned Mathe∣matician Sir Jonas Moore, who was pleased to patronize my weak Endeavours: The Decease of which worthy Patron, and the Worlds favourable Acceptation of the following Work, with a sence of Your Lord∣ships Goodness, have occasioned my presum∣ption in fixing your Lordships Name to this Second Impression. For which I humbly crave Your Lordships Pardon; whereof to doubt, were to suspect your Lordships Cle∣mency, and would render me unworthy the Honour I sue for, of being,
MY LORD,
