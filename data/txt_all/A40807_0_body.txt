May it please your Grace,
YOur Grace being a Person of such singular Eminency in the Church of Eng∣land, I humbly crave leave to present to your hands this following Discourse, which contains a Vindication of the Publick Worship of our Church, from those Exceptions which by Dissenters have been made against it. And the main Design of this Treatise being to promote Christi∣an Ʋnity, by representing the evil consequences of such unnecessary Dis∣cords and Schisms, and the great un∣reasonableness
of those pretences, which have been alledged for their Justification; it will nt, I hope, be judged incongruous, that it should address it self to your Grace, whose high Office in the Church tendeth to advance the Ʋnity thereof, and en∣titleth you to the publick Patronage of Peace and Truth.
I cannot doubt your Graces appro∣bation of this design, which is at all times useful, but more especially in this present Juncture of Affairs, if God please to grant success, which is my earnest prayer. For as all good men who prefer Truth and the sincere practice of Piety before their own prejudices, wills, and passions, cannot but approve of such honest endea∣vours to rectifie mistakes, and com∣pose the minds of men to peace; so all who are pious and wise cannot but discern a greater necessity, and a more particular obligation at this time to silence all these little janglings and
quarrels, if they have any respect to the main interest and concerns of the Reformed Profession.
And I hope, My Lord, that the late Alarum we had from our common Enemies, may open mens eyes to see the mischief of rending the Church into so many Factions, and may dis∣pose them to receive just and reasona∣ble satisfaction. And though what hath been excellently performed by for∣mer Writers upon this Subject be suf∣ficiently satisfactory, yet my labour herein may not be wholly useless, con∣sidering the humour of this Age, which is more apt to read new Books than to seek for old ones.
But though the cause I have un∣dertaken deserves your Graces Patro∣nage, yet my own personal defects might justly have discouraged me, from presenting this discourse to one of so high Dignity, and so great a Judgment; had not the cause it self been so good, that it needed no Art
and Colours to set it off, but is suffi∣ciently justified, when it is rightly represented and understood; and your Graces Candour and Clemency so well known, as to encourage me to hope for a favourable Acceptance; which is the only thing I beg in this humble Address unto your Grace, favoura∣bly to accept of this small Present from him, who unfeignedly prayeth for your Graces prosperity, and is intirely devoted to the service and interest of Truth and Peace, and
