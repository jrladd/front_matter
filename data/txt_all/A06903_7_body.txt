AMongst all the partes or members into which the art of Horsemanship is deuided, there is none so gene∣rally followed, or hath got more professors to defend it then this arte of ambling, and yet is there no part of horsemanship more misgouerned or vildelye handl by vnskilful workmen, through whome there  not onl multitudes of Horses spoyled & made inseruiceable, but also a great company of skilfull horsemen which knowe the true vse of Art, obscurd and kept vnder by the  boastes of most igorant impostors, whih to  and that euen common sen may know how to make the best election, I haue in this treate following,  downe the rules both of true arte and false actise, reconling them so together with the strength of my best reason, that I doubt not but they wil giue to any peaceable  a full satisfaction, in which if any man finde profit, it is the thing I onely wish them, and if they vouch safe me thanks, it is e∣nough for my labour. And so wishing you all the ease that can be coupled to labour, I leaue you to your owne thoughts of me and of my workes. Farwell.
