RIght Honourable, your knowne loues to the Vnited Prouinces of the Nether∣lands, and their Cause, sealed by your Honours with the free expence of your dearest blood, and the frequent hazard of your liues, haue besides those other motiues of your knowledge, iudgement, and experience in Subiects of this nature, inuited mee to this Dedica∣tion. The first Part of Belgiaes Troubles and Tri∣umphs, belongs to the Earle of Essex, and my Lord Montioy; the second part is consecrated to your Hono∣red selues: Both these are rather a Discourse, then a Poeme, as truely and Historically relating the most re∣markable and time-neerer Exployts, which haue passed betweene the Dutch and the Spaniards, in these last foure yeeres Warres of the Netherlands. In this List,
 the Siege of Bergen, and that of Breda, the Battels of Flewry and Statloo, with the taking of Saint Salua∣dour in Brasilia, challenge aboue the rest the chiefest place and prerogatiue. The rest are minor gests, and deeds of lesse consequence, yet worthy for their worths to bee kept in the closet of Remembrance. In all thse as in a representing Glasse, you may see the mercie of God ex∣tended from time to time to this Estate, first erected from the Inforcements of the Spanish tyrannie, since supported by the Auxiliary meanes of the English, French, and Scots, and maintained at this present in that greatnesse, which the world sees and admires, by Policie, Power, and Religion. If publike censure bee as impartiall as is the Poeme, the Authour shall thinke his endeuours fortunate: As for your Noble selues, he doth presume vpon the candour and integritie of your Esti∣mations, vndoubtedly knowing, that you accept a mite as respectiuely as a talent, and esteeme the freedome of the Giuer, more then the value of the gift. Vpon this as∣surance hee doth rest, and so doth for euer rest
