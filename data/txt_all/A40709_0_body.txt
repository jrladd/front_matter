AMongst the many strange and sad Distempers of this poor Chrch, I think there i none of more sad or strange observatio, than th Prodigious neglect of the Lords Supper. After several Essayes, and other Methods, i my Place and Calling, used to redress it, at length these words burst out.
If they seem somewhat warm, I pray you, mistake not my zeal and charity which oght to be so) for spite or ma∣lice, or any evil passion; though indeed, to me, while I labour to be faithful, and to commend my self to every mans Conscience in the sight of God; It is a very small thing to be judged of you, or of mans Judgment.
Yea, let me be bold, and caution you also (my Brethren) that you who have stood it out so mnfully heretofore against the Independent Separation, take heed of falling your selves, and of drawing your Friends, unawares with you, into the Gulf of Brownisme, by your private Meetings, and private Communions.
Let me, at legth (if there be yet need) perswade you, to deal like Christians, and honest Men, if not ike Mi∣nisters; and when your Friends desire your advice about Communicating wih us, do not intimate your dissatis∣faction, when you cannot speak it: or by solemn silence barden them in sin, and beray them to the Laws, when you may save them from both.

 Let me conjure you, if there be any regard due to the King, to the State, to the Church, to the Laws; yea, to te Command and Ordinance of Jesus Christ, our Lord, both yours ad ours, or to the souls f those you seem to love, or your own Credit, and Reputation, d, as some of yur Bethren, I hope, have done already: daoely, candily, faihfully; and lt your Frends, by yur seasonabe advice and good example, know, that it is not thir concen to despise or clmour Dignities, and Government, or any longer to neglect their known duties, but rather, speedly and hartily to endeavour, in their paces, to reform, that whch they complain of, and to do their duty, and receive the SACRAMENT.
It is not my business to accuse you, there is one that accuses you, even Moses; the Law without you and the Law within you: and that, I bear no mace in my heart agaist you, I have this Testimony, I am ready to rceive the COMMUNION with you.
Farewel,
