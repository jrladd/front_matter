THE remembrance
(Right VVorshipfull) of
the great courtesies I haue
receiued at your euer boū∣tifull
hands, makes me a∣shamed
(seeing my happe
hath been so bad) as that I could in no time, si∣thence
I first tasted of the aboundance thereof,
gratifie your VVorship with some token of my
not-vngratefull heart.
Some, while they are too curious (or rather
careles) in making choyse of duetifull requitals,
purchase the crime of vngratfulnes deseruedly
for their labour. And many nothing at all estee∣ming
of benefites, or otherwise thinking them to
come of course, cast the remembrance of the gi∣uers
courtesie at their heeles.
Misliking therefore the ouer-curiousnes of
the former, and altogether condemning the vn∣gratefulnes

of the latters forgetfulnesse, least I
should make my selfe suspected to be of both sex,
I present to your VVorships liking the first fruit
that my barren wit yeelded. No gift (I confesse)
because so vnworthie by reason of the ruffe and
vnskilfull handling of the matter therein con∣teyned:
but a Pamphlet greatly standing in need
of your VVorships patrocinie, that by the pro∣texion
of so learned a Maecenas, it may be defen∣ded
from the biting iawes of snatching Carpers.
VVhich, if of your VVorships wonted bountie
and neuer-ouer shadowed clemencie, you shall
voutchsafe; my studie shalbe how to prepare
presents which may bee more be seeming your
VVorships seruice, and my prayers to the Al∣mightie
for the continuance of this your obtay∣ned
happines, with the daylie increase of all
worldly commodities, and in the end
to graunt you eternall fae∣licitie.
