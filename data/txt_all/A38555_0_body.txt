Worthy and Noble Sir,
YOur rare and singular modesty in con∣cealing your Name, while you publish to the World so many excellent and useful Dis∣courses, is very remarkable and commendable. It were indeed no strange thing to see trisling Pamphlets steal disguised into the World: but that so many good Books, of great name, and singular esteem, of which any one would re∣flect a lasting Honour upon the Author, should be conveyed so secretly into the World; this is that which the most part of men I have conversed with, do wonder at.
I do acknowledg that some Authors have very wisely concealed their names at first, till they have heard how their Writings have re∣lished with others: but this hath never been your motive to do so, else the World had long ere now been put out of doubt concerning the Author of these Books.
It is indeed a pity that so well-deserving an Author should veil himself from the eyes of the World: and it is to be seared, that ere some few years pass, some Bathyllus will own these Books, and claim the honour these Wri∣tings justly deserve. If ever this shall happen, (and who knows but it may), it is my hearty
wish that our Famous Maro may be alive to render this counterfeit Author as ignomini∣ous as the true Bathyllus was at Rome.
Worthy Sir, when I intended to publish these sheets, I had no dispute with my self to whom I should dedicate them, they do in∣deed of right belong unto you; for I have not only observed your method, but have al∣so made use of your words, especially in the Second Part. I will not offend against your modesty, to speak much in the commendati∣on of your Books; they do indeed speak for themselves, and receive their credit and au∣thority from their internal worth. And, I think, I may very modestly say of you what the wise man saith of the vertuous woman; Many daughters have done vertuously, but thou excellest them all. The same of your Writings hath not circled it self within the bounds of the British Isies; other Nations have heard of, and known the worth of your Books. But, Sir, while others admire this, the publick acknowledgment of it is willingly embraced by,
