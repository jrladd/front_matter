MY LORD,
I BEG leave to lay before your Grace these Posthumous Discourses of Sir Henry Spelman; promising them a favourable re∣ception, both for their own worth, and for the sake of their Author. He was a Per∣son endow'd with those excellent Qualities, which ne∣ver fail to recommend others to your Grace's good opi∣nion and esteem: A Gentleman of great Learning, and a hearty Promoter and Encourager of it: In his Tem∣per Calm and Sedate; and in his Writings, Grave and Inoffensive: a true lover of the Establisht Church, and a zealous maintainer of her Rights and Privileges.

But in my Circum∣stances, I should think my self very ungrateful, if en∣joying so much Happiness under your Grace's Patro∣nage, I should omit any opportunity of expressing my Thankfulness for it. Especially, since such small Ac∣knowledgements as this, are the only Returns that I can ever hope to make for the Encouragement, which You daily afford to
