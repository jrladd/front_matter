My Lord,
AS your favourable Acceptance of this Discourse was more than I could reasonably expect, being conscious to my self of my own Weakness: so, your Command is the only reason of its appearing in publick. There is sometimes a Resurrection of the Body Politick, when it hath been as it were dead and buried under Oppression and Tyranny, which our Nation (through the Infinite Mercy, and by the
Almighty Power of God) hath lately Experienced; a Mercy not only above our Deserts, but Hopes: of which I am assured, not only your Lordship, but all True Protestants are deeply sensible; and for which they are heartily thankful. But it is another Resurrection which is here treated of, the Resurrection of the Sa∣viour of Mankind, and of our own Bodies by vertue of his: no circumstantial, indif∣ferent point, but the great Fundamental of our Christian Religion, and in that respect (I hope) of more general use. That you may have part, with all good Chri∣stians, in this Resurrection at the last Day to Immortality and Glory, and En∣joyment of your Lord in Everlasting Bliss, is, and always shall be the Prayer of,
My Lord,
