Illustrious Sir,
IT is my hopes that you will not
disdain these first fruits of our
Gratitude, though gathered out
of your own Nursery, in regard
we never offer to the Deities
themselves other than their own proper
Incense. That these few Remains of
so dear an acquaintance surviv'd their
Author, is that which all learned men
owe to your care; and therefore that
they should return dedicated to your
Name, was not onely mine, but the

desire of the Learned▪ whose farther
designe it was, that I should make known
by the testimony of this Treatise, as
well their publick as my private Gra∣titude.
Who could not think it enough
to enjoy a Jewel so pretious in it self,
unless (as it happens to the Pearls and
Diamonds of great Princes) it had re∣ceived
something of higher value, more
august than innate worth, from the Ca∣binet
of the late Possessor: For to them
that should enquire Cujum Opus, it
would not be enough for the Printer
to answer, Not Aegon's certainly, unless
he added, But Waring's; or to you that
farther demanded, Whence came this
Work? nothing else could satisfie their
Importunity but this reply, That it was
produc'd, most excellent Sir, out of your
Library. And while the Publisher pre∣pares
another Edition, the former Co∣pies
being either lost or sold, it is your
Command, that the true and genuine
Author of this third Edition should be
known to the world in the front of

this third Impression; not wanting
surreptitious Feathers to imp the wings
of thy Fame, who canst deservedly
boast those Off-springs of thy own Quill;
which should the world enjoy all toge∣ther,
would soon eclipse whatever the
Modern Wits have brought forth:
from whence I am not able to deter∣mine
whether or no something greater
than the Iliads might arise. To you
in the mean time all the Learned on
this side Tagus and Ganges bow their
heads, as being the onely person fa∣mous
for the high applauses for Wit and
Judgment both conjoyn'd; so far in
you is the subtlety of Wit from inju∣ring
the sharpness of Judgment. But I
fear lest while I am paying Truth her
due, I should offend your modesty,
which is not the meanest of your great
Virtues: I will therefore correct my
self in time, wishing onely this, that
we may at length obtain what all de∣sire,
an Edition of your Lucubrations,
that so you may do justice to your





Fame, and the vast expectation that the
world has conceived of you. In the
mean while I beg you to accept this
Testimony of a grateful mind, till I am
able to make a better acknowledge∣ment,
which for gratitudes sake, I de∣sire
may be dedicated to your self,
To you, my best Patron,
