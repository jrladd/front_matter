Most honoured. Lady,
THE Confidence of your Nobleness and Piety makes the least intimation of your De∣sires to have upon me the force of Com∣mands, being assured that your Piety and Judg∣ment directs you to what is good, and your No∣bleness and Ingenuity will favourably interpret what a mind truly honouring you, doth intend to answer your desires. Such is this small Tract, occasioned by a motion your Ladyship once made, of having some Preparatory Form, written with such brevity, yet fulness and perspicuity (three rare qualities in one Subject) as might neither dull nor confound, nor yet leave unsatisfied à Mind studious to inform its Judgment, and devoutly to prepare its Affections, so oft as it re∣ceives the Holy Sacrament and great Mystery of the Lords Suppee.
These Notions do not presume, nor pretend to have attained such a Compleatness, as may ei∣ther satisfie your Ladyship's desires, or add any thing to your Knowledg, which is fitter to judge

of the consent of these with your own, than needs any information by them; such they are, and their Author seeks to appear, as may rather de∣serve the censure of Devout, than Curious; in an Argument of so mysterious a Depth, good Affe∣ctions are rather to be raised and inflamed than Subtilties searched and disputed; what I come short in Depth of Knowledge, I endeavour to sup∣ply in belief of the Truth, in love to the Goodness, in thanks for the Benefit, in admi∣ration of the Mercy and Dignation, the less I reach to its height, the more I retire to my own Heart, which I can sufficiently prepare by Humi∣lity, for the receiving of that, whose divine Ex∣cellency, though I cannot comprehend, yet the Be∣nefit and Happiness by it I may obtain. It will be easie for your Ladyship at your leisure to add or amend, what my defects or haste have failed in or omitted: Nor do I present this as a Copy to be imitated, so much as inlarged and corrected by you; it is enough for my design, if either I do or receive good, the one may shew how willing I am, the other may make me▪ abler than I am, to express that willingness and pious Ambition I have to appear worthy the honour and esteem of,
Madam
