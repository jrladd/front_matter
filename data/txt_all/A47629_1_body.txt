REader, The number of bookes is without
number, the Presses are daily oppressed
with them. Yet (though the world abound
with unprofitable, may perniciousI may say of some writers in these daies as Tully of the Philosophers, that there is nothing so ab∣surd which is not mintai∣ned by some of them. Pam∣phlets)
there are many excellent subjects
which are either not handled, or not suf∣ficiently.
There is a great variety in mens fancies as
well as in their faces; and bookesLibri quasi liberi. (the fruit of mens
brains) are as various as men themselves. Some books are

contrarily, saith thus of the Schoolmen, that one Austin
among the Ancients, and one Calvin (in his Institutions
of Christian Religion) among the moderne Divines, will
afford thee more solid Divinity, then all the School-Doctors



of the Popish Church, with all their vaine dispu∣tations,
jejune distinctions, quodlibeticall questions, and
foolish speculations, with which (saith he) Thomas,
Scotus, Lombard, Bonaventure, Molina, Vasquez,
Suarez, à Soto, Bellarmine, and other Doctors of the
Romane Church are full, even ad nauseam. But the Bible
is indeed the Booke of Bookes, it signifieth in the Greeke
Tongue, A Booke in generall; and was sometimes taken
so largely,So Scripture signifieth wri∣ting in gene∣rall, but by an excellency the Word of God. yet by an Antinomasie or excellency it is now
taken for the Booke of the Holy Scripture, and is all one
with Gods Booke. We told you before how much the Pa∣pists
magnified Peter Lumbard the father of the School∣men,
calling him the Master of the sentences, and pre∣ferring
him before hundreds of ours. The next School∣man
after him Alexander of Ales is called Doctor Ir∣refragabilis
Thomas Aquinas after him, Doctor
Angelicus. John Scot the last, Doctor Subtilis. Yet

Scholastici vel hoc nomine non tanti sunt à nobis fa∣ciendi,
quia in Justificationis articulo vix quicquam
tradiderunt solidi. The Papists themselves note twenty
Articles, in which their great Master Lombard erred;
so that that is ascribed to them, hic magister non tene∣tur.
But now Paul (the great Doctor of the Gentiles) of
whom Chrysostome writes severall Homilies, is indeed
an Angelicall, Subtill, Irrefragable Doctor. Austin desired
three things:Revetendissimus Episcopus Vsserius De Christianarum Ecclesiarum successione & statu. c. 9. to have seen Christ in the flesh, Rome in
its glory, and to have heard Paul preach. What he
speakes is true as Gospell, and we can not apply to him
what the Papists doe frequently to Peter Lumbard, hic
magister non tenetur. We may exercise our judgement

in the Law called Liber Judiciarius, or Doomesday-Booke,
because (as Matthew Paris saith) it spared no
man, but judged all men indifferently as the Lord in that
great day will doe. The Bible is the true Liber judicia∣rius,

spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. I
shall now in a few words discover the usefulnesse of this
threefold Treatise. Having been in these times of spoile
unhappily plundered of my Bookes and Manuscripts,
(which I esteemed as a precious treasure) recovering
this twice with some others, I did resolve (for preventing
any future dammages in that kind) to transcribe it faire
for the Presse, which was the worke of a whole yeere. I
know first the subject is very necessary for all Christians
to search into, and I have perused all the best writers I
could find, that I might handle it fully common-place wise,
according to the excellency of the Theme. I have made
use also of some Manuscrips of threeM. Pemble my learned Tutor, Master Wheattly my Reverend Pa∣stor, M. Ball my worthy friend. worthy men, now
with God, (whose memory I shall ever honour) for the
compleating of the worke. I have gleaned a few obser∣vations
from some of the worthy Lecturers in Westmin∣ster,
from M. Ley of Budworth in his Lectures in the
City, and from divers others of the Assembly, in their
printed Sermons. This worke I conceive may be
beneficiall for these purposes: Chiefly for setling and
establishing of Christians in some maine principles of
Divinity, viz. that there is a God, against the Atheists
of these times; that the Scripture is the Word of
God, against the Anti-Scripturists; that Christ is God,
against all Arrians, Socinians, and other Heretickes

of this worke open the heads of Religion, from the
beginning of that Booke to the Fall of man. I would there

I trangresse the bounds of an Epistle, I commend the
