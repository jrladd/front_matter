YOu rarer Beauties of great Britaines Court,
(Imploy'd in this most glorious Masquing sport)
At your high Altars I doe humbly proffer
These Poems, which my modest Muse doth offer
To each of your faire Hands, and gracious Eyes,
Craving you would receiue this Sacrifice
Assigned to your Praise; whose reall worth
My painefull Pen here study'de to set forth:
Though in the best endeavours of my Spirits,
I fall farre short of your transcending Merits;
Yet pardon, Ladies, and accept the Will,
Of your true Honourer, whose worthlesse Quill
Knowes what he wants in Fancy, and in Flames,
Will be supply'd by your Heroick Names:
Thus grac'd, when you have read, I doe not feare,
A kind Acceptance from each Lady here.
