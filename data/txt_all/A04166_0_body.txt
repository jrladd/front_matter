Right Reuerend and Honourable,
BEing here detayned, vpon occasi∣ons made knowne in part vnto your Lordship, I thought my selfe bound in duety and conscience to render an account, as well of my time spent in this my absence, as whilest I was present at my charge. Though this I cannot for this time per∣forme, saue onely in part. These papers which I now consecrate to your Honours protection containe onely the first-fruits of my Labours in that worthy and famous Congregation, which it pleased your Lordship about a yeere

agoe, (for which I euer rest yours bounden) to commit vnto my trust. Yet these being all that I took with me to peruse in my absence, which I well hoped should haue beene much shor∣ter, these are all that I could at this time present your Lordship withal, humbly beseeching they may bee accepted as an vndoubted pledge of my duty and obseruance to your Lordship, and of my vnfaigned desire and resolution to set forward that worthy and religious Congrega∣tion (from which I haue receiued much true comfort and many kindnesses) in the wayes of truth, as well by my pen in my absence, as by my voyce whilest I am present. So, com∣mending this Introduction to your Lorshippes patronage, and your Lordship to the gracious patronage and protection of the Lord Iesus, I humbly take my leaue.
From my Study in Corpus Christi Colledge in Oxon.
