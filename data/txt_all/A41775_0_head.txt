The Epistle Dedicatory TO THE ENGLISH NATION, And every Person therein professing Love to Jeâˆ£sus Christ, under what Appellation soever: Particularly to my BRETHREN and KINSMEN according to the FLESH. More especially to all the CHURCHES of CHRIST, who maintain one Baptism of Repentance, for the Remission of Sins.
