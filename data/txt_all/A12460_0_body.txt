SIR:
SO fauourable was your most
renowned and memorable
Brother, Prince Henry, to all
generous designes; that in my
discouery of Virginia, I pre∣sumed
to call two namelesse
Headlands after my Soue∣raignes
heires, Cape Henry, and Cape Charles.
Since then, it beeing my chance to range some o∣ther
parts of America, whereof I heere present
your Highness the description in a Map; my hum∣ble
sute is, you would please to change their Barba∣rous
names, for such English, as Posterity may
say, Prince Charles was their Godfather. What here
in this relation I promise my Countrey, let mee

liue or die the slaue of scorne & infamy, if (hauing
meanes) I make it not apparent; please God to
blesse me but from such accidents as are beyond
my power and reason to preuent. For my labours,
I desire but such conditions as were promised me
out of the gaines; and that your Highnesse
would daigne to grace this Work, by
your Princely and fauourable
respect vnto it, and
know mee
to be
