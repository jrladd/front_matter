My Lord,
THe whole Designe of this Dedication,
as to the Ground and End of it, is
so clearly transparent to those who
know, how Gods Providence hath set
me, a weak Labourer in the Lords
Vineyard, to work under the shadow of your
Lordships protection, that it is a superfluous waste
of words and time, to defend the presumption of
this Address, which, without mine Apologie, may
be reasonably taken for a just expression of my
duty. It were moreover an unpardonable tres∣pass
against your Lordships quick Apprehension,
whose vigorous spirit is active and piercing in the
observing of Occurrents, if I should make a te∣dious
Harangue, to discover mine intentions in
thus testifying the sense I have, both of the com∣mon
benefit, which I enjoy together with other
sons of the Prophets, who dwell in safety under
the sheltring and refreshing shade of your Lord∣ships

Patronage, and also of those peculiar obli∣gations
laid upon me by your Lordships singular
favour, the repetition whereof in particular were
impertinent, but my publick acknowledgement
in general is as decent, as my private remembrance
of them is perpetually and indispensably requi∣site.
I have onely a minde to wish, that the pro∣duct
of my own Soyl, which I pay as tribute un∣to
your Lordship, were as agreeable for the work∣manship
to the divine matter which I handle, as
the discourse it self is proper, and (as I humbly
conceive) suitable to your Lordships pious incli∣nation.
For I cannot with silence pass by, what
I have seen with huge satisfaction; that as your
Lordship hath had a share in Timothy's happiness,
in knowing the holy Scriptures from a childe,2 Tim. 3. 15.
which are able to make Thee wise unto salvation:
so It hath grown in knowledge, by the advantage
of Gods special endowment, a capacious and te∣nacious
Memory. It is also a blessed and plea∣sing
Rarity, that in an Age of men sadly degene∣rate
into Atheism, who endeavour to forget that
they are Gods off-spring, and would fain be ta∣ken
for the Mushrooms of Chance, and are not
onely sunk below Beasts in enormous sensuality,
but also fallen beyond the apostasie of the Devils
in absurd Incredulity, with a perverse ingratitude
denying the Lord that bought them, and with a
sottish insolencie denying the God that made
them; your Lordship in the midst of this corrupt
and crooked generation hath continued sted∣fast
and unmoveable in the belief and profession
of the general Principles of Religion, upon which

as a sure Basis all Justice and Civility are founded,
and particularly of the Doctrine declared and e∣stablished
by the Church of England, with an e∣qual
aversion from Atheistical profaneness, and
from new-fangled pretensions to Religion.
Some have observed of us Islanders, that we are
very apt to vary our Fashions, and have ascribed
our Inconstancie to the changeable temper of our
Air, and the unstable complexion of our Climate.
I wish our Country-men were not as vainly, and
that more dangerously fickle in altering the Opi∣nions
of their Religion, as they are mutable in the
habit and mode of their Apparel. I am sure the
fault of this flitting and shifting humour is not
chargeable upon the Stars, Skie, Air, or other Ele∣ments,
which are all the innocent creatures of a
good God, and uneffective upon the wills of men.
But the shame and misery will light heavie at last
upon these unballasted mindes, unstable souls,
unwary followers of cunning seducers, or itching
affecters of novelty, who delight to wander, but
forsake their own mercy, while they trust in lying
vanities. To prevent the going astray, or being
misled from the way of Truth, and peace of con∣science
which depends thereon, in one main point
of Christian Religion, I have published a Piece
of my Father of pious memory; which tho imper∣fect,
because a mortal disease cut off the thred of
his meditation first, and shortly after of his life,
drawn forth to fourscore years within a few
weeks; yet is (as I suppose) a very useful Foun∣dation,
on which any Christian exercised in the
study of Scripture, may build the same super∣structure,

which the Author would have raised,
if God had granted him a little longer use of
light.
To this I have subjoyned a short Discourse of
mine own composure, tending to the explication
of S. Paul and S. James their doctrine concerning
Justification, for the removal of a stone of offence,
the seeming contrariety between the blessed A∣postles,
which some weak Christians have stum∣bled
at, and some scoffing enemies of Christiani∣ty
have taken up, to cast at the head, and wound
(if it were possible) the credit of the Gospel. And
I hope that the precious Relick premised will
adde weight and value to mine Offering, which I
tender in all humility first as a Peace-offering to
the Church of God; and I present it to your
Lordship as a cluster of that Vineyard, whereof I
am an unworthy Dresser: devoutly praying that
your Lordships benign influence on the Lords in∣heritance
may be recompensed from on high, with
the plentiful distillation of all blessings upon your
Lordship, and your Lordships whole Family most
worthy of Honour; to which I am resolved, as
well as engaged, to remain in all faithful obser∣vance,
My Lord,
