RIght Honorable, and Worshipfull of this Cittie, being ouerpressed with the heauie burthen of Sorrow, and almost ouer∣come with griefe, for the losse of our late deceassed Queene; whom both you, and all others, sustaines a part: I am in dutie bound (in the behalfe of many thou∣sandes) to giue a sad farewell to her Ex∣cellencie; the onely and last seruice that a Subiectes true hart can bestow. Vouchsafe therefore (Right Honorable and Wor∣shipfull) as a memoriall of your late loue to her Maiestie, to Patronize these tearefull Lines: and then no doubt, but Anglorum Lacrimae will be comforted with Anglorum Gaudia, being guyded by the vertues of our gracious King: vnder whose Royall gouernment, all England is made happie, and a golden time is brought vnto our Countrey.
