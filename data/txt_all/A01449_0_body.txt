A Hiah the Prophet,
1. King. 11.30. ta∣king hold of Ieroboams newe garment, & tea∣ring it out into 12. peeces, tooke occasi∣on thereupon to prohecie:
1. king. 17, 14. Elias ser∣moned on the little meale vessell, and cruise of oyle of his Hostesse, the wi∣dow of Zarephath: and his scholler Elizeus did the like,
2. King. 4.7 preaching vpon the pitcher of oyle, of the Preachers widdow. By the line of such ex∣amples, I am led to giue the Church such spirituall Meditations, as in time I haue deducted from mine angling
recreation. The comparisons that lay between the fishers, and fishes of both kindes, without ransacking fur∣ther reading, are my onely store, and will serue sufficiently for the com∣mon both instruction and comfort. I put these labours foorth vnder your names, as a seale of my zeale and loue towards you, for that loue which in some of you hath been ancient, and in all of you, very good to me. I com∣mend them vnto you, and you vnto God, who more and more en∣large his holy spirit in you, to his glory, and your felicity.
