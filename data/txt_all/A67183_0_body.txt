SIR,
SInce this Sermon was preached at your Request, and is now made publick through your Importunity, it challenges a Right in your Patronage, and being you will needs have it so, that it must appear abroad, you are like to an∣swer for the Imperfections of it.
I hope you know me so well as to be∣lieve me when I assure you, that the No∣tice I had both of the Occasion and your Desires, were equally unwelcome and surprising; and your self and divers others
 well know, that the Circumstances I was then in, both straitned my Time, and robbed me of that Freedom of Mind which was requisite for such an Ʋnder∣taking.
But since you were pleased to judge so favourably of the ensuing Discourse upon hearing of it, as to desire a Copy, and upon Perusal to think it fit for the Press, and urge the Publication, I have yielded to your Importunity, being loth you should be denied any thing that is in my Power to grant, and take this Opportunity to tell the World how much I honour you, and value my self upon your Esteem and Friendship.
And I must be so just as to acknowledge those real Respects and frequent Obli∣gations which I have received ever since I was first known at Haigh: For which being able to make no other Requital, I offer you this small Testimony of my Gra∣titude,
 as an Earnest of further Payment when I have any thing better worth your Ac∣ceptance: And it will be abundant Satis∣faction to my self, if I may any way con∣tribute to the Honour and Reputation of your Family, or the Memory of your de∣ceased Father.
I reckon my self happy that I was so well acquainted with his Worth, as to be able in some measure to do him Right; and that the Character I have drawn of him was so well approved by those that heard it, and were able both to judge and witness the Truth of it. But I shall think my self more happy, if by recommend∣ing one so useful in his Generation, of such approved Loyalty and Integrity, I may not only publish his Worth, but provoke others to an Emulation of his Fame, by an Imitation of his Pattern.
I know you need no Arguments to encourage you to copy out his Example,
 who already inherit the Excellencies which were so commendable and Praise-worthy in him, being Paternae Virtutis, Hae∣res & Aemulus, the Resemblance of his Merit, no less than the Heir of his For∣tunes, as if his Religion and Loyalty had descended on you, together with his Name and Estate, that all might sur∣vive in One, and conspire to make him as much Immortal as this State will al∣low.
And long may the Entayl remain on your Family in an un-interrupted Line and Succession, that his Name may be perpetuated in his Posterity; and as he left the World with Comfort and Satisfaction to see you matched into an Honourable Family, and with a Vertuous Consort, whereby you are doubly blest with the En∣crease of a considerable Income, and an hopeful Issue; so, if departed Souls be at ill interested in our Affairs, or it be any
 Accession to the Felicity of the other State, to rejoyce at the Welfare of those they leave behind them, he may glory in the Prospect of a Lasting Progeny, and survive in their Remembrance through many Generations.
And since we cannot recall him, whom God has been pleased to take from us, 'tis You must retrieve that Loss which we justly lament; who are fix'd in that Orbe in which he so regularly moved, and thence dispensed so kind an Influence to all the Neighborhood.
Go on then (Sir) to tread in your Father's Steps; be as true to the Religi∣on you profess, as constant to the Practice of it, as Faithful and Loyal to your King, as serviceable to your Countrey as he was, and you have all along hitherto emi∣nently approved your self to be.
And may you long and many Years live to enjoy the Blessings wherewith God hath
 enriched you, that when you also must lie down in the Dust, your Name may be ecchoed out in the Praises of the People, and your Fame survive in an honoura∣ble and precious Remembrance.
