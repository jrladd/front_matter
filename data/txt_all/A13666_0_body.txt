AFter I had be∣stovved some parte of my inforced ydle time in draw¦ing these few and friuolous lynes of most vayne and y∣dle inuentions, onely of purpose to occupy my mynd, which otherwise, by occasions vvas subiect to receyue a more troublesome & greater incom¦brance: and then bending my selfe to a further intent, to bestow the sowre fruictes of these my ydle gatheringes (thoughe from a place of small plea∣sure)
 of some such of my friendes, whose curtesye I supposed woulde vouchsafe very wel to accept of them and in euery perticular poynt to par∣dō my folly: knowing that a litle mite was as wel accepted at the poore wo∣mans hands, comming with a willing mynde, as the great and costly prea∣sēt was at the handes of the rich. I thē setled my selfe vnto a further conside¦ration, and this I wayghed and consi∣dered with my selfe, if I should rash∣ly take vppon me to send vnto one or two, or many of my friends, this litle būdle of trifling toyes: not vnlike but in a short time it might be drawn frō one friende to an other, and so at the lenghth cleane out of the hands of my frendes, into the mouthes of some o∣thers, where perhappes it may bee so champt & mumbled, as it shal cleane be altered from the deacēt forme and shape of mans meate, and made loth∣some to the sight of euerye man, and onley fitte for the mouth of the Hogg. Wherby (beyng desyrous to proceede
 in my purpose) I toke occasiō to enter into the imagination of the nature & dispositiō of mā with this intent, that if happily I could find the ciuil & ho∣nest inclinatiōs of some, able to waigh in equal ballance, & coūteruaile with the vnciuil, & dishonest dispositiō of o¦thers, thē would I ye more willingly be bold to aduenture ye publishing hereof to some of my frends, according to my former meanig: & now after a litle de∣liberatiō takē therin, euē as the faulk∣ner, who presently after euery flight, doth hye and hasten hymselfe to take the fruicts of his game from the foote of his hauke: I in the lyke maner cal∣lynge my wittes togeather, haue de∣maū ded a iust accompt of them what they haue gathered accordyng to my purpose, to serue my turne, or at the least to resolue my mynde, and as the Hauke doth open hys foote to yeelde the pray vnto his mayster, sometyme very e gentlye, and sometyme not so easelye, wythout some stryuinge, and wrestynge: euen so also haue
 they in the same manner, accordinge to their skill now opened themselues in this sort vntome, as hereafter follo¦weth.
According to your appointment wee haue bestowed some time in trauay∣ling and wandringe to and froe, and haue not onely trauest the large and wyld field of this world, but as neare as wee coulde, haue also beaten euery little scrubbe and bushe, wherein to our iudgementes any likely hoode of any thinge was to bee seene, whych possibly might serue your turne. And now as touching those things vvhych at this tyme doe onely concerne our charge, and serue for your purpose, which onely bee pennes and tongues, thus much wee haue gathered togea∣ther of the behauiour & dispositiō of mē therin. In ye opē field we haue sene to the plaine sight of the worlde, that there bee a very greate and infynite number of menne some wyth pennes in they r eares, bendynge themselues onely vnto vvrightinge, some wyth
 bookes in their hands, and with great delighte bestowinge all theyr tyme wholly in studye. Some others vvee fynde neyther with Pen, nor Booke, but only with a lump of flesh in their mouthes, so restles, as it seemeth sel∣dom or neuer willgly cōtent to take any rest: of these some be restles onely of zeale & ernest good wil, cōtinually to do good, or els of pleasure to recreat themselues or delight their Fryends, withoute vtterynge at any tyme any cause of offence: some others agayne with their naturall and mother witts do alwais busy & beate their braines, and most vainly occupy their tougues onely in carpinge and snatching, (do∣ing nothing themselues) continually at other mens doinges. On the other syde, of those which geue their minds onely vnto wrightinge, we fynde the dispositions of them bee also diuerse, some to set forth and make playne vn∣to the ignoraunt and common people continually the heauenly and deuine misteryes, onely for the pleasure and
 comfort to the Soule of man, some to wryghting of such necessary matters, which onely touch and concerne a cō∣mon wealth, beyng as needful for go∣uernment, as the other is necessarye for comfort other some onely touchg the safe keping and healthful preserua¦tion of mans body, which be the Phi∣sitions. But leauinge to report any further vnto you, of necessarye wri∣ters, we fynd an other kynde of peo∣ple in the plaine and open field, which geue themselues very often to write of pleasure, only to refresh somtimes the weary witts as wel of themselues, as of diuers other men, beyng perhaps long incombred before, with matters of greatter wayght, which for recrea∣tion sake was neuer thought a thinge greatly amisse. Of these we fynd ve∣ry many, which do greatly please and delyght the humoure of the common people, without any iust cause of of∣fence at all, more vnto one man then to another.
And now to report vnto you no other
 vvyse in euery poynt then according to truth, vvee cannot iustly say, that in the open field wee haue seene anye honest or wyse man, that will take v∣pon him by his penne willingly to iu∣stefye anye vndecent, dishonest, or vncomelye thynge, as wel for mode∣styes sake, as for the preseruation & safe keepinge of their credits: for they know Litterae scriptae manēt, that wri∣tinges remayne a long time, & be al∣wayes verye stronge testimonyes a∣gaynste euerye manne. Therefore wee fynde all menne striue to wright them in as good, and comely order, as possibly they canne. Wee speake generallye euerye manne, because we haue learned this in the worlde, that amonge those kynde of menne, with whom the commendable exer∣cise of wrighting is mostly, & to best purpose vsed; whosoeuer is founde to write otherwise thē according to ho∣nesty and good order, they would not haue him taken or reputed among ho∣nest or wise mē, as a man, but rather as
 a rare deformed and mishapen mon∣ster, they thinke no greater discredit can any way fall vpon them, then to haue such a one to beare the name of a companyon amyng them. But yet ful well it is knowne among many of the wyse and learned penmen (and to wel if it might be holpen) yt many nimble witted marchauntes (though besydes very clownish & dul mannered dolts) vnder the counterfect habits of graue and ciuile callynges, doe oftentymes intrude themselues into that cōmen∣dable exercyse, wyth such dishonest and vnseemely behauiour, as the wise are no lesse ashamed, then grieued to thinke of that wicked abuse, thoughe they haue not alwais power to worke redres according to their good willes. But they say, it is taken for a rule in∣fallable among them, that wit, subtil∣ty and wickednes: be thre such louing Brothers, as seldome or neuer to bee founde a sunder: and that wisedome, pollicy, and honest behauioure on the other syde, be thre of the like. And of
 our selues we finde by common expe¦rience, that there is no greater vvyc∣kednes in the world, then doth dailye proceede from the witty mā: and yet (beyng as blynd in wisedome, as the man is in sight that hath lost both his eies) when any thing coms from him craftely and wittely deuised, eyther by penne or speach, or any other way: he verely perswades himselfe, that at all handes, he is greatly extold for hys wit, but contrary to that blynde ima∣gination of theirs, wee fynde that a∣mong the wise and learned, they bee had in continuall disdayne: for they say, that neither wit nor learning de∣serues anye reuerence at anye tyme, where honestye wanteth, and as for wisedom, vvhich in the latine tongue is tearmed Sapienti, it beareth conti∣nually with him the substance and sa∣uor of al goodnes, or otherwise it must loose the name, and therefore euer to be had in great reuerence. But to bee shorte, besyde all this, wee fynde by greate hunting and seekinge in euery
 corner, & by beating in many bushes, that there is yet an other kinde of peo¦ple which commonly lyke hedgecre∣pers, lye lurkinge in huggermugger, neuer once ventringe out into anye playne or open fielde, if by chaunce they come abroad they come so secret lie, as neuer seene eyther with pen in their eares, with bokes in their hāds, or scarcelye with any tounge in their mouthes: if by chance they wright or speake, it is alwayes in clowdes, in li∣bel manner, and to the defamation, & discredite of some one or other par∣ticular and special man. But these and all other sortes of euill disposed men, wee fynd in this worlde (the good go∣uernment is such) that continuallye they be driuen to silence, and that the wyse and learned men do alwayes go∣uerne the rest, and be the other neuer so subtil or nimble witted, yet cōtinu¦ally they do kepe thē in subiectiō & awe: and therfore thus much now we may boldlye say, that what soeuer is set forth by any mā either for necessi∣tyes
 sake to a cōmon wealth, for plea∣sures sake to the wryter, to gratify his friends, & delight hiselfe, or for any o∣ther reasonable or lawful cause (if com¦ly & honest, & any thing tollerable be¦sides, so it be not to ridiculous,) ye mot wise & best learned mā wil least of all condemne him, but rather allowe his forward and willing mynde, for they know it is no commō thing, for euery man to be singuler.
Conceyuing thus much, vpō this cō∣sideatiō thus had with my self, I find that though in nūber the wicked & e∣uil disposed men do far surmount the good, yet by auctority, and by good gouernment, the good doth alwayes waygh downe the apparant euils: and God forbide that any apparante wic∣kednesse shoulde euer beare anye sway It hath alwaies bene seene, that one wise and learned man, haue euer bene hable to kepe a thousande other wittye naughty packes continuallye in subiection, and though they starte out somtimes by stealth like the dod∣mond,
 or Snaile, yet being once but toucht, they are alwaies fayne to pu home and shrinke in their Horns a∣gayne: and God forbid, that in anye Christian common wealth it shoulde euer be found otherwyse. Therefore now I haue found for my purpose that whatsoeuer I, or any other man shall take vpon hym eyther to speake, or wright, or any other way howsoeuer∣to put in acte: it is onely necessarilye required at euerye hande, that it de∣serue not the iuste rebuke or blame of the vvyse, and honest disposed manne: and as for those which bee contrary, who feareth them, I fynde must feare euery blaste of wynde: for do a manne wel, or do he ill, they will be as ready to fynd faultes, and to blame him, as the wynd wil be to blow vppon him. Wherefore now I haue taken such co∣rage hereby, as I haue imboldned my selfe to fulfill the earnest desire of my mynde, to direct at this tyme, this litle tryfle vnto you, and if the small matter herein contayned, with my
 duty and goodwill, may but deserue to be taken in good part at your hāds, wherof I nothing doubt: & also of the wyse, and indifferent reader, whiche hartely I doe desyre, and lightlye to passe ouer some vayne, and vnusuall wordes, which perhaps in diuers pla∣ces here in may be found: then haue I obtayned the substance of my desyre: thus leauing to imagin of, & to answer any other obiectiōs which perhappes may bee inuented agaynst mee,) least beynge to tedyous in troublīg you to much, I here end: and as by duty boūd duringe life to be at your commaun∣demente, do most hartely commende you vnto almighty God.
From London the thirde of October. 18.
