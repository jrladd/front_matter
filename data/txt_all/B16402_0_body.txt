Sir,
IT is not un∣knowne to your selfe, how the sons of Japhet old No∣ahs grand-children
 searching the un∣knowne places of the world, and en∣deavouring to get beyond that Ne plus ultra where they have descried (gravissima passi) the Proteus like formes of men, and have with Oedipus expounded the Ae∣nigmaes of that
 monstrous Sphinx: where some like A∣chilles valiant, o∣thers like Thirsites, base: others like Ho∣mers poore Jrus pe∣nurious: have been their obiects, thogh their travell hath beene dangerous, their pilgrimage te∣dious, have been re∣quited with inane
 perdimus opus atque oleum, such is the e∣state, Sir, that say∣ling in this sea dis∣covering many formes, observing divers dispositions, I found one speak∣ing a language inar∣ticulate, meere na∣ture being his guide a runnagate from heaven, a scorner of
 counsell, one which seems to be one, yet not one, denying to pay God his owne, disdaining that hee which gave him life should receive it: and being ingaged for those soules which suffer ship∣wracke in this sea of miserie: I could not but send forth this
 childe of mine to be , to direct men to the harbour of salvation, and to defend them from the workes of delu∣sion. Being there∣fore to reduce this man to a safe har∣bour, and that my poore Infant be not with every little wave overwhel∣med,
 I offer it to be guarded by your worthy protection, that Ʋlysses like it may bee sheltred tanquam sub clypeo Aiacis from the ve∣nemous proiects of Scandall. And that the world might know that as your bountie hath had a hand to give, so my
 thankfulnesse shall ever have a hand to write Received: for benefits they say, are alwaies best gi∣ven, when they are most concealed, but thankes when they are most knowne: therfore I have bor∣rowed the art of the Printer, which is the publique tongue of
 the learned, to ex∣presse my selfe most gratefull unto you, I would be sorry to make knowne my owne foule folly in your faire praises; I know you would checke me for it, ra∣ther then cherish mee in it: yet give me leave to tell you that all true happi∣nesse
 in this life, and eternall in the next, is wished unto you
