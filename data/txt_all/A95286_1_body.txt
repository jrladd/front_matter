THe great out-cries which have been made in Eng∣land, upon the last News which came out of the East-Indies, about a certain execution which was done in the Island of Amboyna, in March 1623: be∣cause we see the great desire that your Worship hath, to keep good correspondence betwixt these two Nations, it hath caused me (be∣yond my own curiosity) to search, and inquire after the right and true beginnings, proceedings, and issues of these affairs, upon which this execution followed. Wherein, I perswade my self, I have attained good success, by such means as I have used, and by my good ac∣quaintance, so that (at the last) I am come to the clear light of the matter: partly by the Letters that have been sent home to the Com∣pany here, and declared to the
States General, as also by a par∣ticular examination of the process made against them in Amboyna, before their execution, and sent over hither in writing, which at this present hath caused me to write this unto your Worship, that so, the truth may be made known concern∣ing this business in all places, where your Worthiness, and respect, can, or may bring it to pass; that so your Worship, and all true well-willers (of our Countrey,) may be no other∣wise thought of than we deserve.
