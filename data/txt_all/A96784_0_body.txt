SIR,
WIth truce to Your more serious Contempla∣tions, my humble Muse hath here pre∣sumed to re-kiss Your Highness Hands, and once more wait on Your noble Recreations.
When shee received her first admission into your Princelie Presence, shee was but in the Nonage of her Minoritie, and indeed in her first Coats; upon these her second Addresses to Your Court, shee hath put on her Richer robes of State; and for her Convoie, shee hath made Choice of som Persons of Honor both to attend and bear up her Train.
With her Habit too, shee hath altered her Speech; and shee that the last year Courted Your Majestie in Latin onely, hath now varied her Tone, and breathed forth her dutie in a double Dialect.

This Ode (as I may call it) which was then warbled onely with a single voice, is now Set in Parts, and tuned in a sweeter Symphonie by a select Chore and Consort of the Muses. I hope no jarring or disagreeing Notes here will sound harsh in Your Harmonious ears; if they should, I shall bee verie sorrie that I have toucht the Lyre, and the next Lesson shall be∣gin and end in my own Recantation.
'Tis true, I must confess the Shrine to which these Poems are consecrated, is too Magnificent; and the whole Miscellanie of these Paper-Oblati∣ons is too too mean: let them therefore bee Burnt, and the Flame of them may happily lend mee light enough to see mine own Error, and their Pre∣sumption.
In a word; the whole Woof and Warp of these Fancies is weav'd and wound up in the Pious Ejaculations of Your Majesties Liege People, the Epiphonema of whose Pathetick and Votive Acclamations, is a serious Praier for the Advance of Your Sacred Majestie, and Your Glorious Inauguration.

The Popular and spreading Sparkles of this Zeal, which have kindled Beacons and Bone∣fires of Devotion in the hearts of Your Three Kingdoms, have in mee begot a sublimer Flame of Dutie, which hath been both fed and raised by the Fuel and Fomentation of Your Princelie Favors.
In this Flame I here humblie Offer up the In∣cens of these Praiers at the Glorious Altar of Your Great Name; and in this better Sacrifice of Obedience, I most submissively acquiesce
SIR,


—Quo non manet observantior alter Imperiis REX magne Tuis.—
