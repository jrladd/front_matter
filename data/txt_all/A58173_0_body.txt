My Lord,
IT was no Interest or Expecta∣tion of mine, that induced me to dedicate this Discourse to your Grace. I am not so well

conceited of my own performances, as to think it merits to be inscribed to so great a Name, much less that I should oblige your Lordship, or indeed a far meaner person by such inscription. My principal motive was, that it would give me opportunity of congratulating with the sober part of this Nation, your advancement to the Archiepiscopal Dignity; and of acknowledging His Majesty's Wisdom in making choice of so fit a Person to fill that Chair, endued with all Qualificati∣ons requisite for so high a Calling; so able and skilful a Pilot to go∣vern the Church, and so prudent and faithful a Counsellor to serve himself. But I will not enlarge

in your just praises, lest I should in∣cur the unjust Censure or Suspicion of Flattery: Give me leave only to add, what I may without injury of Truth, and I think also with∣out violation of Modesty; that your Grace's Election hath the concurrent Approbation and Ap∣plause of all good men that know you, or have had a true Character of you; which may serve to streng∣then your Hands in the Manage∣ment and Administration of so dif∣ficult a Province, though you need no such Support, as being suffici∣ently involved and armed by your Vertues, and protected by the Al∣mighty Power and Providence. Those that are Good and Wise are

pleased and satisfied, when great Men are preferred to great Places; and think it pity that Persons of large and publick Spirits should be confined to narrow Spheres of Acti∣on, and want field to exercise and employ those rich Talents and Abilities wherewith they are en∣dowed, in doing all the Good they are thereby qualified and inclined to do.
My Lord,
I am sensible that the Present I make you, is neither for Bulk nor Worth suitable to your Person and Greatness; yet I hope you will fa∣vourably accept it, being the best I have to offer; and my boldness

may pretend some excuse from an∣cient acquaintance, and from my forwardness to embrace this oppor∣tunity of professing my name among those that honour you, and of pub∣lishing my self,
My Lord,
