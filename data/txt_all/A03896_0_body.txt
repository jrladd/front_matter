AS ofte as I consyder (right honorable lorde) the wracke that ye chur∣che suffered afore tyme I am compelled whether I wyll or no to lamēte greatly the blind∣nes and ignoraunce wherin they were noseled all their lyfe tyme. And where as it was the mini∣sters duties, to haue wonne, and brought them to Christe, frō their blyndnes they toke a contrarie waye, beatenge in to their heades a sorte of beggerly ceremonies fet ched out of the bottome of hell / howebeit there was many which for asmoche as they knewe the the lyghte, in no maner wolde re∣tayne
thē. Then they perceyuinge that their doctrine wold not roote in all mennes hartes, called to re∣membraunce howe blody Iulian emperoure of Rome handled the christians, and as he whē he per∣ceyued that by tyrannie he could not ouercome the Christians, ma¦de a decre wherby the Galileans bokes were forbidden to be tow∣ched, for so they cauled the folow∣ers of Christe. Euen so our spiri∣tuall perceyuenge that by fyer, sworde, and roope, the vnlerned professours of the gospell coulde not be vanquesshed, sette such lau¦es, and statutes wherin they for hade men to loke vpō their bokes whiche were sincere professours of the gospell. Coulde any thinge haue ben inuented more deuyl∣lyshe then this to destroye the Christen religion? for they knewe well inough that after that men
were shutte vp from theyr bokes which were published for the edi∣fieng of other, they shuld become as it were vnarmed, and naked in euerie side so that they shulde not be able to withstand their gloses, commentaries, and scole poyn∣tes, wherin the zeale that they ba∣re to the christen religion aperith manifestlye. And all though they came to vs in shepe skynnes, yet inwardly they were rauenynge wolues not sparynge the flocke, as apereth most euydētly by their frutes. Howe be it many of them nowe do repent and forsake their accustomed naughtines, and sub¦mitte them selues to the scriptu∣res, and to the kinges iniuncti∣ons groūded vpon the scripture, in so moch that they knowe the night from the daye, of the which benefite a great sorte more had bene partakers of at this present
had not the deuyll withstode the godly endeuours of oure yonge Iosias. And althoughe hetherto the religion haue not gone so pros¦perously forwarde, as some fayth full wold, yet it becometh not thē that professe the true religiou to ceasce at any tyme from exhor∣ting other to ensue godlines, and vtterly to forsake their acustomed deuyllishnes. The which thinge must be done both wyth out feare and shame, for the wordliges will neuer ceasce from hurting them with her stinge, howbeit caull to remembraunce how wonderfully god deliuered his seruantes in the old tyme, as Daniel from the denne of lyones, the thre children from the fyry furnace, and in the newe testament leest the faithfull shulde leaue their seruice saith Christe in Mathewe in the tenth chapter feare you not them that
kyll the bodys, and cānot kyll the soule, and to thintent they might ye more desierously serue out to ye ende he promised that if they con∣tinued vntil the last breath they shuld be saued, wherfor leat feare wythdrawe no man from the set∣tynge forth of Christes religion. And although the gospell semith mere folishnes in the wordly wise mēs eyes, yet be thou of an other mynd nothinge esteming the glo∣rie of this worlde, which stinketh before the face of god and auelith nothing at all, but rather be min∣ded to suffer with our maister Christe and his faythfull Aposto∣les, bloues, checkes, taūtes, and death, for the gospels sake, and neuer of al this geare be one whit ashamed but say wyth Paule, I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of god from whose profession be thou by no meanes
brought awaye, and be as feante in defendinge thy religion as the Ethnykes were in defendynge of theyrs. we reade that the men of Athens wo were wonderfully gy¦uen to supersticion as appereth in the Actes, vsed at certayne ty∣mes to be sworne, whose othe was this, I wyll fyght for the religiō both my selfe alone & with other. Then seynge they whiche had no knowledge of god but by nature, were so earnest in defendīg their religion, howe moche more ernest ought Christians to be in defen∣dinge their religion whiche was taught the congregacion by God him selfe? But of these wordes let no man gather, that I wolde the people whiche haue receyued the lyght to make an insurrecciō, for I take God to witnes I meane nothynge lesse, but that onely the temporall feare and shame shuld
not withdrawe any man from the lyuynge God. Then let the exam¦ple of the heathen moue vs, and make vs more earnest in delating of our religion then we haue ben in tymes paste. And suffre it not nowe, if it be Gods pleasure, as it is, to be troden vnder foote, but let vs thanks God for this we ha∣ue receyuyd and desyer him to en∣crease in vs the knowledge of his wyll, that we may cōuert the stub¦burne, and strengthen the weake. For this cause haue I taken in hande to set forth in englishe this lytle boke, wherin sondry maters wherby the people haue ben long seduced be well opened, the which boke I am so bolde as to set forth in your lordshyppes name / for as moche as it becometh all men to declare them selues thankefull to them of whome they haue recey∣ued sundry commodities, and not
for that cause onely but that your lordshyppes chyldrens chyldren, & your hole posteritie may knowe what religion youre lordshyp fo∣lowed: forsakynge throughly the Romisshe ydoll, with al his toyes and inuencions contrary to gods holy words. Wherefore I praye God kepe your lordshyppe in the lyght of his worde, whiche you re¦ceyued beynge but a chylde, and encrease in you all Godlynes, that you may contynewe his ser∣uaunte for euer.
