SIR,
NOt to inform your Judgment in any thing concerning the Subject Mat∣ter of these my poor Labours (your Wisdom and approved Knowledge in all Learning being so general, that I can add nothing unto it) but to inform the World how much I honour you and your Vertues, and by how many Obligations I stand engaged to you for the many signal Favours you have vouch∣safed me since the time I came first into this Port, I dedicate this Part of my Book, as the proper Part of the fruits of my spare time, in twenty se∣ven Dials, unto you presented as an unworthy New-years-gift; and that Dial-piece being the Subject of the whole Art of Dialling, I will name the Dials, that I may charge you to Patronage no more than you had; viz. Eight Verticals and De∣cliners, Eight Recliners and Incliners, and Eight Decliners, Recliners, and Incliners, a Globe with two Pole-Dials, and one Shadow-Dial, made on a Piece of Freez-stone, as is seen in the Fron∣tispiece the Gnomon or Stile fastned by me, and likewise Painted and Guilded, which is well
 known by you and many others: And being de∣sired by some Friends that saw my way, and this Piece of Dialling, to Print it, by their impor∣tunity, according to the best of my judgment, I have so done; and if any way profitably, then ac∣cording to mine own desire. As it is, I have made bold to make choice of you for the Patronage thereof, that it may gain the more Credit by your Protection; And if any shall be offended at this Work, my Device shall be a Dial, with this Motto, ASPICIO UT ASPICIAR; only to all Fa∣vourers of ART I am direct, erect, plain, as I am, Sir, to you, and desire to be,
SIR,

St. Georges the Pill, ♃ 29 Aug. 1667.
