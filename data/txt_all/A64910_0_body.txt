May it please your Honour,
HAving lately experienc'd the Influences of your Honours Favours, I hold my self in Duty bound to pay my Acknowledge∣ments to the utmost of my power; which is, in this Address to declare your Piety and your Bounty: For which reasons I had been guilty of Injustice, had I sought for any other Patron, being lately so generously remembred by your Honour. Thus I endeavour to shew my Gratitude, though the highest Pi∣nacle thereof bears no proportion with the large Pillars of your Honours High Worth and Dignity; well observing what is in ancient Story recorded of Lycurgus the Lacedemonian Law-gi∣ver, that he slighted the making a De∣cree
against Ingratitude, imagining no man could be so sordidly wretched, as to be guilty of that horrid Crime. Where∣fore, to pay my Debt in the best Coyn I have, I humbly offer this to your Ho∣nours Patronage, it being a Collection of the Acts and Sayings of Oratours and States-men; and who can be more fit to receive them than the far-excelling Tully of our Age? Of whom I may say as once the ancient Roman, Omnium somnos tua vigilantia, omnium delicias tua industria, omnium vacationem tua occupatio.
May it please your Honour not to give your Lordship any farther trou∣ble; your Acceptance and Pardon is humbly implor'd by
