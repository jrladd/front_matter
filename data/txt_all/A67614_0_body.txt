Madam,
THE reason why I thought fit to dedicate this Novel to a Wo∣man, was because the subject is soft and feminine; but the powerful biass which deter∣min'd









my Choice to you for its Patroness were those many and great Obligations which you have upon me; whereby like Heaven you claim a right to all my en∣deavours. I say a right, for I am far from the vanity of thinking this or any other present I can make you such a free-will-offer∣ing, as may in the least pretend to be meritorious. No Madam, you have so much got the Start of me in Obligations, and have such an anticipating Mortgage on the residue of my actions, that I can do you no piece of service, which you had not a Title to before: Like Votaries in Religi∣on, who cannot burn Incense to the Gods, but with their own perfumes. But though we are not so Impiously vain, as to think we oblige Heaven when we erect Altars, and Consecrate Temples; yet Religion allows us to expect, and the Divine good∣ness

vouchsases us favourable ac∣ceptance But to question my success in that, were to measure your goodness by the narrowness of my own merit. Especially since the Oblation is attended with so much devotion, and in the most Literal sense is all over Love. And this gives me occa∣sion to say a word or two con∣cerning the work it self. That which I here present you with, is the Picture of Love, a very excellent piece, drawn to the life in every Feature. This admira∣ble Picture (so natural is mo∣desty to great and true worth) has a long time conceal'd it self under a foreign veil, by the re∣moval of which, I have added one degree of goodness more to its many excellencies, Communi∣cation. Indeed I thought it un∣reasonable, since Love and Reli∣gion are things equally implan∣ted in the hearts of all mankind,

that the mysteries of one should be contain'd in an unknown Tongue, more than those of the other. And now Madam I have one more Dedication to you, and that is of my self, who am with∣all imaginable sincerity, your most devoted Servant,
