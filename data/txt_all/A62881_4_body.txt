My Lord,
I Could heartily have wish'd for a more Chearful Occasion of acquainting the World with the Respect I have for Your Lordship.

However I cannot doubt Your Ac∣ceptance of this Tribute in Memory of Your most Excellent Lady.
You have most generously taken all Op∣pertunities of Expressing the just Esteem you had both for her Person and Virtues; and thereby Demonstrated that Your Af∣fection for Her was sublim'd into Friendship, which is Love in Perfection.
My Lord,
I have a double Right of making this Address to Your Lordship, both as You are a Friend to the Muses and to Your Country.
'Tis a Happiness to our Nation tha You are return'd to do her Service at Home after having done her so great Service and Reputation Abroad.

Your Performances in War are too Nu∣merous to be mention'd in a Dedication, being sufficient Matter for a History.
If Envy shall repine at the Fame You have Atchiev'd, 'tis what Horace has affirm'd of Hercules Himself; who after all the Labours he had sustain'd, and Monsters that he had vanquisht
Comperit Invidiam supremo fine do∣mari.
But a greater Hero than Alcides has been an Eye-Witness to several of Your Lordship's Martial Actions; which tran∣scends whatever can be said by O∣thers.
Besides my Lord, I pretend not to send You a Penegyrick but an Epistle; my Muse being ambitious Only of being admitted as a Mourner at the Obsequies of a Person who was so unspeakably Dear to You.

I have too tender a Sense of Your Sorrow to Trespass any farther upon it, and therefore shall only Subscribe my self
My Lord,
