Right Honourable,
THe Author of the Paper we herein deale withall, having by his Apostacy to the damnable Doctrines of the Quakers, and written Apologie for them in the said Paper, endan∣gered divers of our Towne, and the parts adjacent, where he was formerly in some esteem; and withall in the same Paper, formed into the modell of an Epistle directed to them, insolently challenged all the Publick Teachers of this Nation; and particularly us, who now appeare against him, by sending two of the Pamphlets to us by name; we dared not betray the Truth and Glory of our Lord Jesus, nor the precious Soules of the People, by neglecting to pub∣lish a timely Antidote against the Poyson of such a subtill and in∣sinuating peice, as your Honour, if you will vouch-safe to look on it, and compare it with this Answer, will easily discerne it to be. We perceive the designe of the Author, is by false suggestions to re∣proach the Ministry, and by Jesuiticall Equivocation, to sweeten
 the Doctrines of the Quakers to the Publick Magistrates. And upon that account, we thought it meete to present this our necessary vindication of that, and discovery of these, to some Person in Au∣thority, of Honour and Conscience; that under such a shelter, we might gaine it a more facile admission to others, of those unto whom we are necessitated to appeale. And because we can assuredly suite that Character to your self; and withall are perswaded, that by reason of your equability of carriage to dissenters in late times, our Adversary himself cannot reasonably quarrell at us, for our choyce of a Patron; and lastly because we have both of us in some measure (but one of us more largely, by divers years experience) known you a cardial friend to a Godly Ministry, and the Doctrine which is according to Godlynesse; we therefore humbly put it into your Honours hands. Sir, as to the Cause we maintaine, we need not any Creatures Patronage, nor dare we submit it to any Creatures Umpirage; for we are assured it (mainly) concernes such founda∣tions of Religion, as deeply ingage the honour of our Lord Jesus, and therefore we are assured, he will not suffer them to be moved; and such as will stand, when all Persons and Doctrines shall be judged finally, and everlastingly according to the purport of them. But as to our candour and integrity in the managery thereof, and the proportion of satisfaction which we give therein, we are con∣tented to stand to your Arbitration, wherein however we may fare, yet it shall suffice us, that our Consciences tell us, that we have done our endeavour to defend the Truth, and that with meeknesse and moderation, beyond our Antagonists deserts, or the merits of his cause; and our experience tells us, that you will not disdain to accept from us this small Testimony, that we are very much,
(Right Honourable)
