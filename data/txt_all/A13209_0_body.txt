I Shall not need (Right Honourable) to spend much time and many words in commen∣ding this Booke to your Lordship, and all sincere Lo∣vers of Gods truth, seeing the name of the Author, surmounting my best
praises, can much better grace it to them (and many were they) that knew him; and the worke it selfe may worthily commend the Author to them that knew him not. Jt pre∣senteth unto your Lordship the la∣bours and Lectures of that faithfull Servant of God, and famous Prea∣cher of the Gospell, Doctor Sutton, in his weekly exercise at S. Marie Overies in Southwarke, which when they were delivered, were recei∣ved with the generall applause and approbation of all his Hearers, that were godly and judicious A man furnished with many rich endow∣ments, and entrusted by our great Lord and Master with not a few of his choycest talents, which, whilest he lived, hee employed faithfully and fruitfully, to the glorie of God, and
the edification of his people in his painfull Ministerie. But (alas) too little a while did this burning and shining light appeare unto the world, setting in our Horizon, and (with∣out any Poeticall fiction) dying in the Ocean by an unnaturall motion, before he had attained unto the high noone of his perfection, that he might shine much more cleerely among those bright Stars, who with him have been the meanes upon earth of enlightning and converting many others. Some little glympse hath hee left behind him of his greater light (like the rayes in the skie after the Sun setting) in these his labours penned by his owne hand, for his owne use: which wan∣ting the gracefulnesse of his elocution, and powerfull spirit to enlive them, in which he excelled; are but like a na∣ked
body stripped of its ornaments, or a dead picture compared to a living body: and this picture as farre short in beautie and likenesse of that it would have beene, if himselfe had li∣ved to perfect it with his owne pensill, as a picture taken of a dead man in comparison of one which is drawen to the life. But yet I supposed, that this dimmer candle-light of his fruit∣full labours, was too usefull and pro∣fitable to lye any longer hid under a bushell, and that it was in me a kinde of sacrilege, to rob the Church of the use of his talents after hee had done trading with them, and to hide them in a manuscript (as it were in a nap∣kin) which being published might be∣come profitable for the inriching of many.
And therefore that God might be
yet more glorified by these fruitfull labours of his faithfull servant, and the Church thereby might be also fur∣ther edified, J have caused them, by being imprinted, to be laid out in com∣mon, for the benefit of many, especi∣ally those who having beene his ordi∣narie hearers, were much addicted to his Ministerie, and will highly esteem the worke for the Authors sake.
The which I humbly present and dedicate to your Honors Patronage, being emboldened hereunto by your fervent love to Gods truth, and your zealous profession of it in these cold and declining times: as also for that honourable respect which I have ob∣served in your Lordship to Gods poore Ministers, and your cheere∣full receiving of them and their mes∣sage, for their Masters sake: and
finally, that I might take occasion hereby of preserving and continuing your Honourable acquaintance with me the least of Gods Servants, which J highly esteeme, not for any worldly respects, but that J may be still honou∣red by your Noble and Christian love, and bee alwayes ready by my best services to honour you in it. The Lord more and more multiply all his graces in you, that you may long re∣maine, as a Noble Peere of our Common-wealth, so a firme Pillar of our Church, adorning your religion, which as your best ornament chiefly adorneth you, and gracing that truth by your holy profession and practice, which above all other titles will most enoble you, and make you truly ho∣noured in this world, in the sight of God and all good men, and eternize
your glorie in the life to come. The which shall bee the heartie prayer of me a poore Minister of Jesus Christ, who shall ever remaine much devo∣ted to your Lordship in all Christian dutie and service,
