GENTLEMEN,
AFter so much Pains as you have taken, and so much Good as by the Blessing of God on your Endeavours you have done to that Church of which I esteem it my happiness that I am a Member, may it be permitted to a private and obscure hand to return you this small Tribute, in acknowledgment of that Sense which not my self alone, but I dare say every single

person of our Communion has of what we all owe to your Learning and your Inte∣grity.
I present you here with a short view of your own Labours; or rather, I offer to the World a small Collection of those Discourses you have written in Defence of our Religion. And how unsuitable soever it may appear to usher a few Titles of Books into the World under the protection of so many great Names, yet I am confident the Consequence of this Undertaking cannot but be as Ho∣nourable to you all, as I heartily wish it may, and as I am sure it ought to be: When it shall be consider'd how vast a Number, and of what acurate and learned Discourses is here comprised, and for almost all which we are in the compass of about Three Years indebted to you.
It is indeed a matter of just wonder to all those who are acquainted with your me∣thod of living here, how persons engaged not only in a laborious attendance on their Pa∣rochial Cures, and a constant return of pain∣ful and acurate Preaching; but almost ut∣terly

distracted with that multitude of other Business which in these last Years has taken up the greatest part of your time, should yet find leisure to discharge all these, and at the same time to adorn the Press with so many Books as might alone have seemed more than enough to have employ'd your whole In∣dustry.
But blessed be God, who has raised you up against such a time as this, and given us so great an Earnest of his Favour to us, that as we had never more need of Able, and Honest, and Firm Guides, than at this day; so I may venture to challenge any Age of the Church, to shew such a Number of truly Learned, and Pious, and constant Pastors, as the Church of England, and especially this City, do's now abound with.
May your Labours and your Examples al∣ways find such a success as they deserve, and as they have of late met with amongst us. And since we cannot now have any excuse for our Apostacy should we renounce our Holy Pro∣fession, after so much as you have done to convince even the most ignorant Persons a∣mongst





us of the Truth and Purity of it; may we ever firmly adhere both to you and it: That when we shall appear before the Great Bishop and Pastor of our Souls, we may all of us give up our Accounts with joy.
This, as it is my hearty Wish, so I am per∣swaded it is the sincere Resolution of every one of those whom God has committed to your Care. And that in this Firmness we may be all of us established more and more, shall be the continual Prayer of him who in all thankful Duty will ever remain,
GENTLEMEN,
