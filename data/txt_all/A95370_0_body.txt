May it please Your Lordship,
WHen the following Sermon was prea∣ched, which is now a full twelve∣month ago and as much as since the latter end of October, it made so great a noise about the Town, and was the occasion of so loud a cry against me from a dsloyal and disaffected party, that I was forced immedi∣ately to put it to the Press, not out of any vain opinion which I had of my performance,
 which, as it was but mean in it self, so it could not be well expected that it should be better, considering the shortess of the time which was spent in the composing, but for my own just and necessary vindication, that the world might see and be satisfied what it was that had opened the mouth of Calumny and Detraction so wide; and Your Lordship ha∣ving received information that there was a design to make my Sermon publick, which Iacknowledge I ought not to have done with∣out Your Lordship's good leave, by whose commission and authority it was preached, I was commanded to deliver up my Notes to be perused by Your Lordship before they went to the Press; but it so happening that they were then actually in it, before that order came, and the first sheet having been printed off, all the possibility of Obedience that was left me was, to recall my Papers from the Press and lay them at Your Lordship's feet, as they were, torn in pieces by the Printer, and in a condition very much ashamed to make their appearance before You.
Your Lordship was sensible of the confusi∣on my Papers, as well as my self were in, and would not suffer them to blush in your
 presence, but was pleas'd to dismiss me in a most obliging manner, for which unexpec∣ted goodness, when I came so apprehensive, as I was, of a less favourable usage, I am bound to pay you my everlasting thanks, and to command me further, not without expressing some trouble at the incivility and indiscretion of Sir P. W. which was indeed an affront to Your Lordship and the whole Clergy of the three Kingdoms in my person, to let you see the Papers when they were printed.
I came away, as I had reason, from White∣hall, where I had the honour to pay my du∣ty to Your Lordship then going to the Coun∣cil, not onely well satisfied, but very much transported with so obliging an answer; and having now a Licence from your self, as well as from the Eighth of the Ecclesiastical Ca∣nons made and set forth by a Convocation of the two Provinces in 1640. whereby we are obliged twice every year to preach upon the Subject of Decency and Order (and whatsoe∣ver may be preached, may be printed also if occasion so require) I had now a double en∣couragement to go on with the Impression, and accordingly I did go on.

If Your Lordship shall demand of me, as it is very natural for you to doe, what was the reason of its publication being so long delayed, all the answer I can make is that it was, (so far was I at first from designing it for the Press, had I not been provoked to it by the clamours of the worst of men, as well as encourag'd to stand up in my own defence by such as were friends to the Government, and by consequence to me) I say, as it was, I found it to be a very imperfect and unfinish'd piece, and such as had reason to apprehend the censures of its friends as well as enemies; therefore I presumed to take the liberty, not to alter any thing which I had spoken, but onely to add so much to it, as might make a just disquisition upon the Subject, and yet if I had taken a liberty of making alterations, so it had been onely in the expression, not the sense, it would have been such a li∣berty as would have been vouched by the best examples that antiquity affords: Pliny, as himself confesses in his Epistles, did so by his Panegyrick to the Emperour Trajan; and before him that great Master as well of thought as expression did the same by his Oration in defence of Milo, and not to
 say any thing of the Verrine Orations, and the invectives against Catiline, it is very rea∣sonable to believe that the Philippicks, instead of being burnt as Anthony would have had them, have been transmitted to Posterity with an improvement of incens'd eloquence and Ciceronian rage.
There is one thing indeed, which I know not whether I ought to mention or no, which did receive some little alteration, if the omission of a Line or two, for it was no more, may be called by that name; and that is, that upon occasion of discourse concer∣ning the persecution still raging in the Ter∣ritories of the French King, I did speak of his Majesty, out of the zeal I had for the Protestant Religion, and being under no tie of obedience to a foreign Prince, but onely of respect to his Character if he do worthi∣ly sustain it, with so much sharpness and Satyr, comparing his Persecution to that of Nero, Maximine or Dioclesian which was the very thing and the onely thing that was o∣mitted, that there were persons, as I suppose, appointed by the Congregation de propagan∣da side, the Committee that manage the in∣terest of the Faction, to buz in my ears, as
 an argument to discourage me from publi∣shing what I had spoken, that my Sermon would have the honour of being translated into French, for the use of Monsieur Barillon; that a complaint would be made by the French Ambassadour in a memorial on set purpose, that I had broken the Peace be∣tween the two Nations, and that a Fellow of a College, that had not so much as a Pupil to take his part, had presumed barely with the as∣sistance of his Sizar, a worthy Squire to so redoubted a Knight, to levy actual War up∣on the most potent and formidable Prince that these latter Ages of the World have seen; though I was not sensible that I had said any more, than they themselves who made use of this advantage against me, are every day speaking among one another with a bitterness of Language peculiar to the men that use it; though for this perhaps the French King is to thank them that they take no more liberty with him than they do with their own rightfull Sovereign and natural liege Lord, the one for subverting the Prote∣stant Religion, and the other for maintaining it, which shews them to be a People so very hard to be pleased that I am resolved never
 to be a servant to such difficult Masters; for as Aristophanes saith rightly in the entrance into his Plutus,

; Neither indeed, when all comes to all, have I said any more than what most of the Prin∣ces and States of Christendom have publickly complained of by their Ambassadours and Agents in the Court of France, and what is sufficiently justified by that excellent Person Dr. George Hickes, a great ornament of Lear∣ning, and as able a Champion for the esta∣blished Religion as ever the field of contro∣versie hath afforded, hath verified to a tittle in his judicious Sermon concerning the True Notion of Persecution, a Discourse which I wish with all my heart those of the Separati∣on would take the pains to reade, that com∣plain so much, but so unjustly of the sub∣ject of it.
So that I think upon the whole matter Sorbiere's case and mine are very different from one another, though that were the ex∣ample that was used to fright me, for I have
 not spoken contemptibly of the French Na∣tion, which I have always accounted of as a gallant People, valiant in War and always excelling in all the arts of Peace, much less have I dared to vilifie the awfull Majesty of so great a King, whose Sovereign Power I do as much acknowledge to be an image of the divine, inviolable, sacred, and never to be mentioned without reverence and honour, as I do that of our Royal Master himself, the best of Princes, the Father of his Country, the delight of Mankind, the wonder of this Age, and the inimitable Example of all that are to come, but yet I think it to be such an image as it would be inexcusable Idolatry in me who am an English Subject to fall down and worship.
And as my case is very different from that of Sorbiere so are my circumstances too; for he they tell me for the indignities he put upon the English Nation, the bravest people that the Sun beholds, was deservedly turned out of all, but I am humbly bold to tell Your Lordship and the rest of my Superiours that I have nothing out of which to be turned and that I should think my self comparative∣ly happy in respect of what I am now, if I
 could be placed in his circumstances without the crime that occasion'd them, and as I am a stranger to his circumstances and his crime so, I thank God, I am as far removed from his Principles too, for he and his two friends Mersennus and Gassendi were of the Religion of Malmsbury, if they had any at all, as ap∣pears by their joint admiration of the Book De Cive, the Latin Leviathan that sports him∣self in foreign waters as the English one does upon the British Coast, but I own no princi∣ples that destroy the very nature and being of obligation, and are by consequence ene∣mies to Mankind.
But it is easie to discern that all I have yet said is by no means a satisfactory answer to Your Lordship's, question, why the edition of this Sermon hath been so long delayed, for the Additions to it are not so considerable that the twentieth part of all this time need to have been taken up about them; and though indeed when I am brought to this pinch I cannot give a good account of such a slow and dilatory proceeding, yet a true one I will be sure to give, and it is this, that when I had written and printed off ten sheets of this discourse, which is as much as I now
 publish, I launched out I know not how or why, into things merely Philological and foreign to the subject, and as it is usually, when men are got into a Labyrinth, they do but lose themselves the more for endeavou∣ring to get out, so one digression bringing on another, I found I had wander'd so far out of my way, that the subjects I now em∣ploy'd my thoughts upon began to speak a∣nother Language from that in which the former part of my discourse was written.
They that have a Talent at censuring will be apt to say that this proceeded out of no∣thing else but a certain vanity and affectati∣on of appearing learned, and it may be this was indeed the very cause, since it will be difficult to assign a better, though I am not sensible of it, and so far as I know any thing of my self (but how few are there that do understand themselves?) I have no such thing as pride or affectation in my nature, and in truth it would be very inexcufable in me to be proud of any thing or to appear as if I were so, and much more to resolve in∣dustriously, in spite of the Subject or the Company I am in, to be talking of matters in which neither are concerned, because this
 is an humour so tawdry and impertinent, and touches my imagination with so satyrical im∣pressions upon it self, that of all things in the World it would appear the most despicable to me, if it did not make me sick, as it al∣ways does, and no man can properly be said to despise that which he fears.
But whatsoever were the true reason of so extravagant a ramble from the subject and the Text, whether it proceeded out of vani∣ty and foolish ostentation, or whether it were onely, what some that know me will be apt to plead in my behalf, that I am naturally inclined by my constitution to digress from every such Subject which I undertake, which I believe to be a true account of the business, for I scarce ever set upon any thing in my life, but I was always pestered with a multi∣plicity of thoughts, as perfect strangers to the Subject and to one another, as all the several barbarous and distant Nations of which the Ottoman forces are composed, who though they are all engaged upon a com∣mon design, yet they understand not one anothers Language; I say whatever were the true occasion of such an irregular compo∣sure, or whether Your Lordship will referr
 it, besides the two causes I have lately men∣tioned to some decay of mind, which my misfortunes may have brought upon me, yet thus much I know, that when I came to con∣sider and compare the sheets which I had writ∣ten together, I was very much ashamed of what I had done, and very angry with my self, insomuch that I saw no hopes of be∣ing reconciled, but by throwing those pa∣pers, that had made the difference, aside, to try if that way it were possible the business might be forgotten, that so Richard and Bax∣ter, who were at Mortal jarrs, might be brought to a better understanding with one another; for it is a very painfull and uneasie thing for a man to be fallen out with him∣self, and if there be any torment more ex∣quisite than another, a thing of which all the Philosophers but the Scepticks are agreed, I am clearly of opinion that the shame and confusion resulting from a foolish and im∣prudent action is the worst punishment be∣longing to humane nature.
Therefore I did, as it very nearly concer∣ned me, use all the expedients I could think of or devise, and made all the friends I could possibly to my self that the business might
 be timely made up, and, as the last remedy, I was resolved to forget it and to employ my meditations upon subjects of another and a very different nature.
In this interval I writ that Discourse con∣cerning the Laws of Nature and their obli∣gation, which is now abroad, as the second part of it lies by me ready for the Press, onely it wants transcribing, for it is written after so confused a manner that no Compo∣sitor can deal with it at present; I writ also that Epistle, which followed, concerning the Marriage of Cousin Germans, which hath suffe∣red great variety of censures not onely from the different capacity of its readers, but from their different interests likewise, for it is generally the nature of Mankind, that they will have nothing to be true which does not sute with the circumstances they are or would be in, albeit when things are imparti∣ally considered I can scarce believe there are twenty men in the King's dominions that are concerned in point of interest or honour to believe what I have written to be false, and I have some reason to believe that the most considerable objection that lies against that short Essay, is that it will be very long
 before any man who understands himself will be so hardy to undertake to answer it.
There was one indeed who had a design of that nature, and though I know not the per∣son, yet his character I do, and so will Your Lordship likewise, when I shall have told you that it was the loyal, learned and ingenious writer of Constantius the Apostate, an adver∣sary whom though for his known ability I had reason to dread, yet having Nature and Antiquity so clearly on my side, I would have chosen such an Antagonist before any o∣ther, both because in his advocation and de∣fence of Cousin Germans, the utmost strength of that cause would have been brought into the Field, which would have brought the matter on one side or other to a speedy issue; and because he was pleased to express him∣self in a Letter of his which had no name at the bottom, with so much candour and in∣genuity towards me, and indeed so far a∣bove any thing which I pretend to deserve, that I was well assured that the controversie would be managed on both sides without any heat of words, with mutual kindness and civility toward each other, as becomes
 those that know how to defend the truth without insolence, and how to yield to it without shame, and that have joined the courtesie of Gentlemen and the charity of Christians to the learning, judgment and abi∣lity of Scholars; but upon what reason I know not he afterwards desisted, as it seems, from his design, and I do not speak this as if I would be thought to send him a chal∣lenge by Your Lordship, which it would be very rude in me to doe, but I would rather make it my humble request to him, that he would suspend his engaging in the contro∣versie against me, till he have heard all I have to say for my self, and then if my ar∣guments will not demonstrate what they pretend to do, I will as freely recant my o∣pinion as ever I maintained it, and give the World the reasons why I have altered my mind; in the mean time I look upon my self as bound in gratitude and justice to let Your Lordship and the World understand, how much I think my self obliged to so in∣genious a man for his favourable opinion of me, and that I should be glad to be as well acquainted with his person, as I am with his unquestionable loyalty and learning.

My Lord, I am very sensible that by what I writ upon that subject, I did incur the dis∣pleasure of some for whom I have so great an honour, that I am very uneasie under the sense and apprehension of it, though I have done nothing but what I thought my duty at that time when I did it, and I see no reason yet to alter my mind; but these are the common inconveniences of humane life to which every wise and good man ought with a Philosophical patience and equality to submit, as I do, and am very perfect in that Lesson, which by long practice I have taught my self, of bearing with patience, as well the affronts and indignities of mine enemies, as the misconstructions and misinterpretations of my friends, for such I call all those who are friends to our common freinds, the King, the Church, and the Religion established, and that I might give no farther occasion of of∣fence, I have suspended for a while the publi∣cation of what remains upon the same subject, till the controversie, not yet decided by my Lords the Delegates, have received its final period and issue by their judicious, honou∣rable and wise determination.

And besides these papers which have been either publish'd or are ready for the Press, and were some of them begun and others finish'd during that time of my retirement from my former studies and to another end of the Town, there was another discourse which lay by me imperfect, being an exer∣citatation upon that Law of Moses, whereby the Brother or the next of kin was obliged to raise up seed to his deceased and childless Brother or Kinsman, a great part of which was written by me at Cambridge, as a prepa∣ratory to that other Treatise of the Marriage of Cousin Germans, which it is now a long time that my thoughts and studies have been con∣versant about, and being so much of it as was then done, transcribed in a very fair and legible hand, it was the greater temptation to me to send it to the Press, as I did, and have added so much to what I had written at the College, that it requires but very little to put a conclusion to it.
In this Discourse, as I have considered all the cases and circumstances of that Law, with much more exactness than any have done before me, so I have particularly le∣vell'd a considerable part of it against one
 Chapter of Mr. Selden in his Book De Succes∣sionibus, and have very largely exposed the vanity of the Rabbinical Learning, and the manifest unskilfulness of that sort of men in the Antiquities of their own Nation; and if I have not found out a new Key to open and interpret the Mosaick Law, yet thus much at least I have done, I have applied it to several Laws, to which it hath not been applied before, and have abundantly disco∣vered the extreme impudence, as well as igno∣rance of the Aegyptian Moses and other cele∣brated Masters of the Jewish Learning.
I have likewise in an occasional Essay up∣on that subject demonstrated the Antiquity of Episcopal and Diocesan government in the Jewish Church, the dependence of the inferi∣our Clergy upon the Bishop of the Diocess, and the subjection of all the Bishops of the Province of Judaea to the Arch-Bishop, or High-Priest, at Jerusalem: I have shewn that this was the Go∣vernment to which our Saviour and his Apo∣stles, being members of the Jewish Church, submitted; and not onely so, but that the Jews had among them a Patriarchal dignity likewise, that is, such Bishops as having their usual residence in Jerusalem or in Judaea, had
 the care and inspection of the Churches in the dispersion, which was likewise imitated by our Saviour in his modell of the Christi∣an Church; and certainly if their be no such harm in a Patriarch, that is, a foreign visitour or inspectour, if this were imitated and ap∣proved by our Saviour himself, then much ss can there lie any exception against a do∣mestick and residing Bishop, to whose autho∣rity likewise our Saviour submitted, and consequently approved of that sort of Go∣vernment, which I will grant in its first o∣riginal to have been of humane institution, if that will please our Dissenters, for all they will get by it will be this, that our Saviour himself did allow of humane institutions in the Christian Church, and did submit to them, and that this not being a part of the Mosaick Law, so far as that Law consisted of types and shadows which were to be done a∣way, (as being fulfilled and answered by their antitype in the person and dispensation and sacrifice of Christ) the reasons of con∣venience upon which this government was founded, remain still the same, and there∣fore that there is no reason why it should be altered though it had not been recommen∣ded
 to us by our Saviour's example, which may justly be thought to give it a jus divi∣num, though it had none before, for he was by no means a Presbyterian, and much less an Independent.
And yet if this business be examined into the bottom, though the granting it to be of hu∣mane institution will doe the Separatists no manner of service, it will be found that this government was instituted by Moses, and e∣stablish'd by Joshua, both of which acted by divine appointment, and by consequence it having nothing which was properly Judaical, that is, which was of a Typical or Symbolical nature, nothing that had any necessary depen∣dence upon or conexion with their Sacrifices and lustrations and other Ceremonies of that Ʋmbratick dispensation, there is the same reason why it should last after those shadows were done away, as well as when they were lookt upon to be in full force, and were e∣steemed the most indispensably sacred.
I have also in the same treatise demonstra∣ted the antiquity and the reason of the Priest∣ly maintenance by tithes, and I have shewn upon what account it was that the tenth of all the fruits of the Earth, and the encrease
 of Cattel was offered to God, and that the reason holds every whit as good to this day as it was either in the Levitical times or in those that went before them.
And upon this occasion I have considered very briefly the question so much controver∣ted concerning usury, I have demonstrated its lawfulness to all but the ancient Jews, and by the same clue I have opened a way to a better understanding of the Chronology of the times before the Floud, and so long after it as the age of man was reckoned to be an hundred and twenty years, and have besides made it evidently appear what was the true meaning of the , the , and the , in the computation of the ancient Chalde∣ans, and what it was that gave both name and notion to the Kalendae and the Idus a∣mong the Romans, things that are as yet a secret to the World.
But it being so ordered by divine provi∣dence that while I was employed in this kind of meditations, there fell a living void in this City, in the gift of the worshipfull Company of Salters, I laid my antiquities a∣side to try what interest I could make among them, for the obtaining their favour in the
 disposal of it, and I was so successfull, thanks to my good friends, who appeared very zea∣lous, and very numerous for me, that had the business poceeded to a Poll when the first Court was called, which was a common hall consisting of the whole freedom, I have rea∣son to believe my circumstances at that time would have carried it against any of my Competitours, although my merit were very short of some.
And now having laid aside my new de∣signs, compell'd by a welcome necessity of my affairs, as I had done my old ones for another reason, I began, as I had leisure from that continual hurry in which my competition had engaged me to sit down and consider seriously with my self, which I could not doe without a mixture of plea∣sure and melancholy together, in what a labyrinth of different and disagreeing under∣takings I had entangled my self; and being returned again from a remote corner of the Town, into the neighbourhood of Decency and Order, I had, as it is usual with old friends, a very great desire notwithstanding the late unkindness that had past between us, to see them once more and renew our
 our old acquaintance, and try if it were possi∣ble, in the midst of such confusion, to re∣duce them to a better agreement with them∣selves, as well as with me, and make them answer to their own names, instead of those of Chaos, Rhapsodie and Cento, by which they now began to be much better known.
And the best expedient I could think of to save my self harmless from the censures of men, with as little injury to the Book-seller as might be, (for I would have no man suf∣fer upon my account if I could help it) was after a retrenchment of several sheets, which are now wholly lost, and indeed were very unfit to see the light, to divide the remain∣der into two several parts, not such parts as had a mutual connexion and dependence, but such as are wholly what they are, by themselves, without any manner of relation or affinity to each other.
The first of them is that with which I now present Your Lordship, which all but the last six or seven pages hath lain by as it is, for at least eighteen months last past, and is, if I do not very much mistake my self and it, not onely a very pertinent discourse upon the subject it pretends to treat about, but a very
 unanswerable one too, if any thing may be thought unanswerable in an age where noise and faction supply the room of argument and reason, and where instead of being yiel∣ded to as it ought to be by honest and un∣prejudic'd minds, the more convincing any argument is, with so much the greater vio∣lence and fury it is opposed, and they that are able to speak the least good sense will al∣ways be sure to make the loudest noise.

Sic ego torrentem quà nil obstabat eunti
Lenius & modico strepitu decurrere vidi,
Sed quacun{que} trabes, obstructá{que} saxa tenebant,
Spumeus & fervens & ab obice saevior ibat.

That other part which is likewise finished from the Press and shall immediately come abroad by it self, consists of these two Philo∣logical dissertations, the first concerning the true time of our Saviour's Passover, an en∣quiry that hath of a long time baffled the en∣deavours of learned men, but will now cease to be a question any longer; the second con∣cerning the true pronunciation of the Tetra∣grammaton, in which likewise, though it be not a probleme of such moment as the other,
 several very famous antiquaries and men of the most considerable remark for learning have gone before me; but it will appear, I hope, by my discourse upon that curious, though minute, subject, that they have all been mistaken, and that the true secret hath been reserved for me, a man by no means to be compared with any of them, to inter∣pret and explain; but so it often happens that chance finds out what art and industry have in vain sought after, and an accidental thought that wanders in the brain with all the undesigning carelesness of a dream, may carry us directly to the discovery of some truth, which hath been courted in vain by the profess'd addresses of more ingenious and diligent inquirers.
In what I have said upon the first of these, I have demonstrated the onely true significa∣tion of that which St. Luke calls the , or as we translate it, the second Sabbath after the first, contrary to the several disagreeing conjectures and accounts, disa∣greeing with the truth and inconsistent with themselves, as well as with one another, which have been sent abroad by Joseph Sca∣liger, Johannes Cloppenburge, Ludovics Capel∣lus
 and Hugo Grotius, all very great names, and all in this respect very widely mistaken, and by the account which I have given, there is some light afforded to the ancient Jewish Calendar, which was certainly quite ano∣ther thing than the Kalendarium Hebraicum of Sebastian Munster, and much ancienter than the Talmudical Canons for the observati∣on of the Jewish feasts, which are but a mo∣dern invention of the ignorant Rabbins who make new antiquities to supply the room of the old ones which they have lost, notwith∣standing the authority which that Imposture hath mt with from several very eminent scholars and very excellent persons.
In my discourse of the Tetragrammaton I have considered very largely the Tetractys of the Pythagorean School, and I think have shewn sufficiently what a fondness it hath been in almost all the learned writers that have written upon the subject, to derive the latter of them from the former, and though in this I will not be so positive as in my other conjectures, yet thus much I will say of it, that I have bid very fairly for the discovery of the Tetractys; and whether I have or no, I make my humble appeal
 to Your Lordship and other learned and judi∣cious men that have a palate in matters of this nature, but to Your Lordship in the first place, whose patronage it begs, and humbly implores the powerfull protection of so great a name against the rude assaults of ignorance and envy.
That which made me the more willing to publish the former of these exercitations was, that I was under an engagement to the pub∣lick for a discourse of that nature, it being no more than what I did expresly promise in the Epistle Dedicatory before the Sermon con∣cerning Transubstantiation, which it is now near four years ago that I preach'd before the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of this famous City, and it was in obedience to that wise and venerable Court that it was afterwards printed; and it is a farther service which I now pretend to doe to the Protestant Reli∣gion, by setling the exact time of our Savi∣our's last Supper, which was a night before the legal Passeover was killed, and conse∣quently was in imitation not of the real, which could not be killed before the usual time, but of the Mnemoneutical or commemo∣rative Passeover, as Grotius calls it, wherefore
 the body of Christ, which is our Christian Passeover, was not at that time truly eaten by the Disciples, but onely a remembrance of it, a Proleptical remembrance it was, as it must needs be, being instituted by our Sa∣viour himself, then present among his Disci∣ples, as the Mnemoneutical Passeover among the Jews was a Postliminious commemoration. But of this notion of the true time of our Saviour's last Supper, so far as concerns the application of it, which in the papers I now speak of, I have not medled with, I shall speak more largely in some other papers, written ex professo against that blasphemous and absurd tenet in another Language, which shall shortly be communicated to the World, and I hope will find a favourable acceptance in it.
But however wide a discourse of this na∣ture may seem to be from the subject of my Text, the occasion of it was pertinent enough, for I was speaking of our blessed Lord's sub∣mitting himself, as became the Preacher and the Prince of peace, to humane institutions in religious matters, which is an undeniable ar∣gument that such like institutions are not in themselves unlawfull to be complied with;
 for he preaches by his example as well as by his doctrine, and the occurrences of his most innocent and spotless life, are in many cases, as clear testimonies of the divine will, as the express declarations of his Gospel; wherefore this Mnemoneutical or commemora∣tive Passeover among the Jews, with all the peculiar rites and usages belonging to it, be∣ing a matter perfectly of humane instituti∣on the Law having onely enjoined the real one, or that which Grotius calls the , the sacrificial Passeover, upon the 14th day of the first, or in some cases of the se∣cond month, this alone, if there had been nothing else, would have been sufficient in the way of instance, besides what I have ur∣ged from the nature and necessity of the thing it self, to prove that humane instituti∣ons for the better ordering and government of religious duties are not onely lawfull in themselves, but that they ought to be obey∣ed by us, if there be no particular reason from the quality of the thing enjoyned to the contrary, as they were by Christ, who gave in this an example of obedience, and we cannot be his Disciples if we do not fol∣low it.

But as it was not proper in a discourse that was intended to have the shape and appea∣rance of a Sermon to launch out into so large a Philological disquisition, of which there are so very few of those that hear Ser∣mons that can be supposed to be competent Judges, so indeed it was needless to give a particular instance, when our Saviour's com∣munion with the Jewish Church, during the whole time of his sojourning among men, is it self an aggregate of a thousand argu∣ments to prove the lawfulness of humane impositions; for without such impositions there can be no communion, any more than there can be a City or Commonwealth with∣out Laws, or a society without some rules and orders to govern it self by, the submit∣ting to which rules is that in which the very being of a society consists, and the breaking of those measures by an universal disobedi∣ence is a disparking the society, a pulling down the pale and barrier of the body politick, and a letting all things loose into the state of nature, that is, into a state of tumult, con∣fusion and disorder.
For the other Diatriba upon the Shem Ha∣meporash, as the Rabbins call it, or the Four
 lettered name of God, I cannot say that it came in so well, but rather must acknow∣ledge that it was too slight an occasion which was taken hold of to entertain the Reader's curiosity upon it; but as it happens in con∣versation, if a man leave the company but for half a minute, he shall find oftentimes the discourse as much altered when he re∣turns again, as if he had staid away a thou∣sand years, or as if it were another company into which he was now fallen; so it will al∣ways be in writing likewise, if a man do not keep a guard upon his thoughts, but allow his fancy a liberty of ranging, which it will easily do in a small space of time, over things at an infinite distance from one another.
However an essay of this nature conside∣red by it self, though it will not contribute any thing to the use of common life, yet it cannot be unpleasant to any man to know for certain what the true pronunci∣ation of that peculiar name of God was, by which he is pleased to signalize and distin∣guish himself in an especial manner from all created and dependent beings that are called Gods, but are not what they are called; that name whose true and genuine pronunciation
 hath been lost for so long a succession of a∣ges, for neither Josephus nor Philo Judaeus were acquainted with it, and the Jewish Rab∣bins are generally agreed (which discovers how ignorant they are themselves, and how unconscionably given to impose upon others) that it was known onely to the High-Priest, and never pronounced by him neither, but onely once a year, in the most holy place, when he brought his piaculary censer, within the vail upon the solemn day of expiation: For I have not onely solidly demonstrated what the true pronunciation of this name was, but I have proved that there were other names of God in Scripture that were equally sacred, though it is true they are owing to the same root from whence this is derived, and that it was not onely known among the Jews themselves but that also the heathen nations were ac∣quainted with it, for Rabshekah in the sacred volume mentions it expresly, and Philo By∣blius the translatour of Sanchuniathon, a very ancient writer of the Phoenician story, who li∣ved in the interval of the Judges, hath made it so far from being any secret that he hath long ago divulged it to the whole learned World.

If Your Lordship shall demand of me, what it was that moved me, having suffered them to lie asleep so long, to publish these papers just at this nick of time; there are two things which I presume to offer as the reasons why I took this opportunity, after so long a si∣lence, to let them come abroad and speak for themselves, and for the Church of En∣gland, which they pretend to maintain, as well as for my self, the writer of them, who having suffered so much upon their account, they are bound in justice to doe me what right they can, which I imagine they will suffici∣ently do by adventuring abroad and putting themselves upon a fair and publick tryal.
One thing that moved me to publish them at this time was, that I thought they would be as much, or rather more seasonable at this juncture than at that in which they were written, and for this I had not onely mine own opinion, but, as I may interpret it, Your Lordship's also, together with the concurring suffrage of all those reverend, learned and judicious persons, who are now employed, as I have been informed, by the particular appointment and direction of Your Lordship, whose paternal care suffers no possible expe∣dient
 to be unattempted, to procure the peace and unity of this Church, to satisfie the dis∣senters, as many of them as act upon a prin∣ciple of conscience, without design, in all the pretended matters of difference between us, and to clear up the misty Atmosphere of re∣ligious doubt, which hath been raised by zeal, but is not yet dispelled for want of knowledge; a design worthy of so great a Prelate, so truly pious, so profoundly wise, so indefatigably good, and suitable to the nobleness of so large a mind that hath joy∣ned so much personal honour and so much honour of inheritance together.
And though in the midst of so many great performances, in which the strength, elo∣quence and prudence of the writers main∣tain an equal combat with each other, I can∣not hope that mine will doe any thing which is not effectually done by some of theirs; yet I thought it my duty upon this occasion not to be wanting to the common cause, and rather to betray, though I hope there is no danger of that, my want of skill or ability to maintain it, as it ought to be maintained, than of affection to serve it to the utmost of my power.

If I have been so fortunate to stumble upon any thing, which hath not been thought of or considered by some of them, it is a new mite cast into the treasury of the Temple, and ought to be accepted cour∣teously, not for its own weight, but for the chearfulness and good intention where∣with it is offered, without which the rich Hecatomb is not of so much value, as the poor man's Turtle-dove or his handfull of flower.
If I agree with them in any thing, as I cannot imagine but I shall do in all, so as notwithstanding the conceptions which are uttered may be materially different from one another, yet they will all bear their part in the harmonious consort of our common de∣sign, which is to perswade to communion and to peace; this ought in reason to be looked upon, since we have not at any time compared notes together, nor have ever had any private conference at Sevill or Valadolid, or any other place, to be not so much the voice of prejudice as of nature, which is e∣very where uniform and like her self, and being attentively and heedfully consulted will be sure to pronounce the same sentence,
 where the cases themselves are not different from one another.
But though all other considerations and motives should desert me, when I pretend to give a reason of publishing these papers, yet this I am sure will not, that if by the use∣fulness of my performance I cannot doe an immediate service to the cause it self, yet that cannot possibly suffer any disparage∣ment from so obscure a Champion for it, and I shall at least doe a collateral service by giving an advantage to others upon the comparison; and therefore I beg of Your Lordship, if I am not so happy to make a succesfull attaque upon the enemies of our Church, who hold out obstinately notwith∣standing all their arguments are answered, their trenches filled up, and their bastions beat about their ears, yet that at least I may be suffered to be a foil to its friends, and to appear in the company of those for whom I have so great an honour and esteem,
Velut Hedera serpens inter victrices lauros.
But that which was the chief inducement to me to come abroad at this time, or ra∣ther
 a provocation which I could not resist was, that to frustrate the design of my com∣petition, when I appeared a candidate for the Salters favour, the memory of this Sermon was by mine enemies made use of as an ob∣jection against me; and though this strata∣geme was far from having that malevolent influence upon the success of my affairs which was intended, it appearing after all, that I had a very powerfull interest in that Loyal body, yet I had reason to take it very ill, that that which was an instance of my Loy∣alty and affection to the government and the Religion established, and therefore ought in justice to have been an argument in my behalf, should be made an article of impeach∣ment against me: And for that reason I was resolved to publish what I had written, part∣ly to vindicate my self, and partly that be∣ing challenged at so bold a rate with that which was my duty, and was indeed mine honour, as if it had been an unpardona∣ble fault, not to publish it at such a critical juncture, might be interpreted a disowning of what I had done, which I abhor to think of, and have taken this course to purge and vin∣dicate my self in the best manner I can, as
 well from the suspicion of so detestable a baseness, as from the guilt and blackness of the crime it self.
And as I was firmly bent upon this honest resolution, those words of our Saviour came into my mind, which he spake to his Disci∣ples in his Sermon on the mount, and which have a particular reference to the Clergy in all ages, Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt have lost its savour wherewith shall it be sal∣ted? I considered that salt by naturallists was looked upon as the great principle of fixation and rest, that by the ancients it was accounted a symbol of friendship, and a token of peace; and upon such accounts as these, thought I within my self, it cannot be that the Salters who are a Loyal body, firm to the King and the Religion established, who are desi∣rous to promote that peace and good cor∣respondence among men which is the very life of trade, and the greatest blessing of life, and by consequence are zealous for that u∣niformity of divine worship, without which experience tells us there is no peace to be had; it cannot be that they who are thus disposed should be displeased with me for being like themselves, so that instead of losing any
 thing of my interest among them, I did ra∣ther promise my self abundance of advan∣tage from the honesty of this action; which if it be not otherwise rewarded, will sit down con∣tented in the enjoyment of it self, and will abundantly make up with inward satisfaction whatever it wants of any outward reward.
If the salt have lost its savour, in the origi∣nal it is, if we may call the Greek the ori∣ginal of St. Matthew, , which Your Lordship knows to be a Latinism, as there are many such in the New Testament, si sal infatuetur, for this is the meaning of fatuus in Latin, it signifies a pall'd and phlegmy substance that hath no taste nor relish, no savour, life or spirit in it, it is a floating sediment and a liquid Caput mortuum, and therefore it is very fitly applied in the metaphorical way to insignificant and useless persons, the men of latitude and moderati∣on, that have not the courage nor the ho∣nesty to declare themselves, but live in a Commonwealth with the same listless and unconcerned indifference, as if they were not members of it, which if it have any ef∣fect at all, it must needs be a very bad one, by keeping the disagreeing parties at a bay,
 by casting a tacit and supposed reflexion upon such as dare stand up in defence of the Government and the Laws, as if they were not so good, or at least not so wise as they should be, and by giving at the same time a secret encouragement to the disaffected in∣terest and party, as if their cause were such that all the moderate and sober sort would side with them if they durst, but dare not in Conscience take part with the Laws against them. And yet after all, this is fatuum in both senses, it is not onely insipid, but it is foolish too, and certainly for any man to sit still with his armes folded, and his eyes dropping into a forgetfull slumber, pretending neither to see nor feel any thing about him, when his own interest, which is involved in that of the publick, lies at stake, and when by de∣claring for his Country against a Faction, he may ensure himself and get a great deal of deserved honour and reputation into the bargain, is at once a most prodigious wicked∣ness and a most despicable folly together; for though they doe a present service to the Faction by it, yet it is true with them as it is with us, he that is not with us is against us, and so it will be seen if ever they get the
 day, that the indifferent standers by shall fare no better than he that made a stout and re∣solute resistence, onely there will indeed be this difference between them, that though the estates of the one and of the other are an equally tempting and inviting biat to the in∣satiable avarice of successfull treason, yet the courage, constancy and integrity of the one will even by the greatest adversaries them∣selves be remembred with honour, and spo∣ken of with signs of inward veneration, when the pusillanimity and faintness of the other who can be friends to no body but them∣selves, shall bring an unavoidable contempt upon their persons, and make them reflect upon themselves with shame, as well as be slighted and disesteem'd by others.
But of all men in the world a Clergy-man that is of so cold a composition is certainly the least excusable, because he is under the greatest obligation to confess God and his truth openly before men, he is not to gratifie any party by a tame compliance to the prejudice of the publick, nor to pur∣chase his own peace with the loss of that of the Church, which can onely be maintained by wholesom discipline and an establisht or∣der,
 and therefore of such an one it is still more true what follows immediately of the unsavory salt, that he is the most contempti∣ble, and (whatever high opinion he may have of his own wisedom and prudence) the most really despicable creature in the world, he is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out with disgrace, and to be trodden under foot of men. And therefore whatever becomes of my pretensions, concerning which I am not immoderately solicitous, but refer my self wholly to the wise disposal and goodness of al∣mighty God, I shall be very glad if those Gentle∣men in whom the Title shall appear to be, shall pitch upon one that is at least no M—tonian, that is, no Deserter, for it would be very in∣congruous in those of this fraternity espe∣cially, to chuse an insipid Priest, when God himself would not accept of a Sacrifice that was not salted. And let the result of that assair be as it will, yet I shall always be very proud, as I am very thankfull for it, of the great favour and kindness Your Lordship hath been pleased to doe me, by appointing me to officiate at that Parish during the seque∣stration of the living, and allowing me so fair a competence out of the profits of it.


May it please Your Lordship,
I am not insensible how much I trespass upon your great affairs by so prolix an ad∣dress, but yet I am humbly of opinion, that I have said nothing which the necessity of this occasion, and of my circumstances did not almost indispensably oblige me to doe; and now having given Your Lordship an ac∣count of my self, as Cato was used to say Etiam otii rationem reddendam esse, and to whom am I more accountable than to Your Lordship my Diocesan, a Person to whom I am so very much obliged, and one that hath the most undoubted right to exact an account of me? having acquainted Your Lordship, as faithfully as I can with the true reasons that moved me to defer the edition of this busie trifle that hath made so great a noise, so long, as well as to defer it no lon∣ger, but to publish it at this juncture of time there are two things still remaining for which I do humbly beg a little more of Your Lord∣ship's patience, while I insist with all imagi∣nable brevity upon them; the one concerns chiefly an objection which the friends of the present establishment may raise, and the o∣ther
 is an exception which I know for cer∣tain its enemies will make.
The friends of the Church perhaps will object against me, that my discourse being chiefly levelled as it is all along against the Independency, whose name is Legion, being a thousand different Heresies and Sects under one title and denomination, this may be in∣terpreted as a supposed allowance of the Presbyterian model; but as for that I think I have already satisfied the world what my o∣pinion is, at the latter end of my discourse concerning the Laws of Nature, and if I were to give a definition, or rather a description of Presbytery, it should be this, that it is a de∣vice of ambitious and unruly Presbyters bro∣ken loose from the government of their Bi∣shop, and which though it be not indepen∣cy it self, yet it is certainly the mother of it, for the same restless and unquiet humour which could not submit it self to the Episco∣pal constitution, will incline them in their Sy∣nods and Ecclesiastical assemblies to contend for superiority over one another; for where all are equal, and there is no tye of obedi∣ence from the one to the other, nor any common visitour or inspectour indued with a
 power of discipline over them all, there it is natural for men that have passions and de∣signs about them to squabble, there it will unavoidably come to pass that many will take it ill if they be not chiefly regarded, and if their opinion or determination be not the law and rule of the assembly, every man will be forward to speak, and desirous to govern, but loath to hear and unwilling to obey: The consequence of which will be that it will occasion parties and factions, while some take part with one and some with another, and this cuts the reins of discipline in sunder, and does as naturally terminate in Schism and Separation, as the day is concluded by the night, or as fair and foul weather succeed one another; besides that when men have once tasted the forbidden fruit of disobedi∣ence, which it is so natural for all mankind to hanker after, they seldom or never end where they begin, but go on farther and farther in pernicious attempts upon the good order and government of the world, till they have brought all things into absolute confu∣sion.
A subordination and dependence of one part upon another, is as necessary in one
 sort of government as another, for though the Ecclesiastical and civil Society be in some sense distinct from one another, yet in a Christian Commonwealth they consist both of them of the same persons, and the na∣ture of a society is in both cases the same; wherefore because the State and the Church, the body politick and the body ecclesiastick, are both of them made up of the same mem∣bers, because every man hath both a civil and an ecclesiastical capacity, it is impossi∣ble there should be any disorder in the Church which will not sensibly affect the state; and the division of a Commonwealth or King∣dom into infinite sects and parties is a disso∣lution of the civil body as well as of the sa∣cred, and every thing that hath a tendency to such a dissolution is in its proportion per∣nicious and consequently unlawfull.
So that if there were nothing more in the Episcopal government, than what St. Jerome, the great, but very much mistaken patron of the Presbytery hath allowed, namely that the ancient government of the Church, was by a parity of Presbyters (though no body knows when or where, nor is it possible to assign any age or place when and where it
 was not govern'd by Bishops) but that in process of time this parity proving inconveni∣ent, by being the occasion of Schism and contention in the Church, then in toto orbe decretum est, ut unus de Presbyteris electus su∣perponeretur caeteris, ad quem omnis Ecclesiae cura pertineret, I say, if there were nothing more but this in the business, yet this is suf∣ficient to assert the necessity, and by conse∣quence the jus divinum of Episcopal Superiority in the Church of God; for the nature of things is owing to the authour of nature, and that which is best fitted to preserve the World must needs be most agreeable to him that made it: and this is so true that let this sort of Government be never so ancient, as I shall prove to Your Lordship and the World that it was certainly the government of the Jewish Church, and the government to which Christ and his Apostles did themselves submit, yet its antiquity would be, as old things usually are, too weak and infirm to be able to defend it, did not its usefulness and manifest expedience to the good of so∣ciety and of humane life, give it a perpe∣tual youth and vigour, by which it is ren∣dred strong in its own defence, and will be
 too hard for its enemies to the end of the world; otherwise if any man can shew me fairly that either the Presbytery or the Inde∣pendency are more exactly calculated for the quiet of the world, notwithstanding that the experience of our late times, added to the reason of the thing, and the opinion of Saint Jerome which was founded upon it, do seem at present to demonstrate the contrary, I must beg Your Lordship's pardon if I with∣draw my Canonical obedience, for I must and will be either Presbyterian or Independent as the nature of things would have me.
I speak it with all imaginable deference and profound submission to Your Lordship's ex∣act judgment, and that of my Superiours, I have considered of this matter with all the care and attention I am able, and I am cer∣tain, if I can be certain of any thing, that I have discovered the Philosopher's Stone, the true Elixir of Government and of humane life, which it must be our own fault in re∣jecting so great a blessing or by our disobe∣dience not answering the design of it, if it do not turn all things it touches into Gold, and make the whole earth as happy as the Paradise of God.

The true state of the question is in short this, the end of government is obedience and peace, and therefore all sorts of govern∣ment, upon supposition that they are equal∣ly fitted for the bringing of this end to pass, would have an equal Jus divinum, an equal Jus naturale, an equal right of obtaining and continuing as they are in the several places and territories where they are in use; because in this case nothing could make a disturbance but an alteration, and therefore it would be with governments as it is with proprietours in the state of nature, antecedently to any bargain or compact, the undoubted right would be primi occupantis, because to deprive him of his possession, who was already sei∣zed of it, might occasion an embroilment, might be the cause of bloudshed and of war, but if every man would let his neighbour a∣lone then all the world would be happy, and upon supposition that every man would be quiet and peaceable without it, that men could be so friendly, so happy and so secure without government as with it, there would be no need of government at all; but since man is by nature an ambitious, a necessitous, and consequently a disobedient, turbulent
 and encroaching creature, since he wants many things, and expects more than he wants, for this reason that form of govern∣ment is certainly the best which is the best fitted to command and force obedience: and this I affirm from the nature of things, for men do not willingly obey their equals, much less their inferiours, this I affirm from the consent of mankind and the experience of all ages to be the Episcopal Government, or the Subordinate Politie both in Church and State; and if any man will undertake to prove the contrary, and will be as good as his word, then. I shall be for levelling as well as he, but till I see this substantially proved, which I have a strong fancy I shall never do, so long as humane faculties or humane pas∣sions continue as they are, I desire to con∣tinue in my old post, and be content to move, though in the lowest sphere of this subordinate and comely frame, rather than by the perpetual jarring of equal powers and motions against each other, to go stooping like a Goose under a barn door, and be in perpetual fear, nè fractus illabatur orbis.
It was either the experienced or the fore∣seen mischiefs of equality and independence
 that first introduced order and good govern∣ment into the world, and it is the natural desire of power in man, who is a needy, rest∣less and ambitious creature, that endeavours to break this order and dependence for rea∣sons of its own, without considering the in∣terest of the publick; lastly it is the unspeaka∣ble confusion, mischief and calamity with which the breach of this order is attended, that usually makes all parties (weary of those miseries which by strife and disobedi∣ence they have brought upon themselves) return again into some orderly establish∣ment that may defend and shield them from the same calamities in the time to come; but there is no safety, no security, no quiet en∣joyment of a man's self, his friend or his pos∣session to be had but under the shade and protection of such a subordinate state of things, in which the very life and being of society consists.
The other exception, which I am infal∣libly certain will be made against me by the dissenting party is this, that in the manage∣ment of the subject I have undertaken, I have discovered too much violence and heat of temper, and this accusation will consist




 of two parts, the first will concern my style and way of expression, the other that I have so openly and so zealously declared for a vigorous execution of the penal statutes upon the dissenting parties.
With Your Lordship's good leave I will speak a little to each of these particulars.
And as to the first of them, I might here conjure up the Ghost of an old story, that hath been so often disturbed by men that first pillage antiquity for a smart repartie, and then steal, as it were, by consent from one another, of Croesus and his son, the dumb Prince of Lydia, whose dutifull apprehensi∣on of his Father's danger, broke through the obstacles and impediments of nature, and taught him to speak as plain at half a minutes warning, as if the most ingenious and learned Dr. H. had had him in tuition for seven years together, and there is a scrap of Virgil too, if the often use of it had not made it so cheap, that it will hardly pass so much as in capping of verses, where any thing goes as far as from Ennius or Lucili∣us
 to Qui mihi, which would have done me admirable service and that is

—Quis talia fando
Myrmidonum, Dolopum ve aut duri Miles U∣lyssi
Temperet à Lachrymis—

But these two being both of them prosti∣tute citations which deny no authour that hath occasion for them, I shall be con∣tent to say in homely, downright English, without the advantage of historical embel∣lishments, or Poetical flowers, that it was impossible for me to be concerned as I am for the peace of the Church, and the hap∣piness of mankind, without expressing an hearty indignation that we must be made miserable for the sake of trifles, and by the bold artifices of conventicling varlets, that are as ignorant as they are disloyal, fel∣lows that pretend to I know not what influ∣ences of the Spirit, onely for that reason be∣cause they are unskilfull in Letters, men that are so far from being qualifi'd to instruct the people, that they understand not com∣mon sense themselves, and are the most contemptible idiots under the cope of Hea∣ven.

I appeal to Your Lordship, and to all man∣king, whether this be not sufficient to ju∣stifie a passion, and whther it be not a man's duty to express himself after the example of our Saviour with the same severity and de∣served sharpness with which he treated the Scribes and Pharisees and Hypocrites of his time, nay, it is still more our duty to imi∣tate that example, because there is greater cause and matter of indignation; for the Pharisees, though they were indeed Hypo∣crites and deceivers, and as Josephus assures us, a pragmatical Sect, and very great med∣lers with affairs of State, yet they were ma∣ny of them admirable scholars, and men of great understanding, and though they may be justly upbraided with want of honesty, yet with want of learning they could not, they had that in abundance, and that was one reason that made them despise the Gospel at that rate that they did, as being preached by the Carpenter's Son, and by a few poor Fishermen and illiterate people.
But we are fallen into the hands of Fools as well as Knaves, men that have neither honesty, nor sense, nor learning, that preach as with the same lowdness that the Thunder
 does, or the Cataracts of Nile, which is mu∣sick onely for Crocodiles and monsters, so with no better eloquence, or more intelligible meaning, and they encourage and animate one another, like Mariners weighing anchor, they set their shoulders to the government and muster all the strength and all the noise they can make, and resolve with themselves to unhinge the Kingdom, and overturn the world by importunity and clamour.
Wherefore let any expression be never so severe, yet I desire no allowance to be made me, onely let men consider whether what I say be true or no; for upon supposition that I speak no more than the truth, the things are of that consequence, that wonderfull, and yet that manifest and plain importance, that there can be no severity too much, no zeal too fierce, nor any Steliteutick or Satry too invective.
David in his time said it of himself that, That zeal of God's house had eaten him up, but we have lived to see the Phrase inverted, and seem to have eaten up the zeal of God's house; and if there be any thing that can excuse those bitter imprecations which David showrs in such plenty upon his enemies, which can∣not
 well be done by any thing but by saying, that they were enemies to God and to Reli∣gion as well as to him, then certainly we shall still be more excusable, or rather it will be highly commendable and praise-worthy in us if, without the curses of David, we onely give a due character of the seducers of our times, the disturbers of our peace, and the most dangerous enemies of manking; that the people may avoid them, and leave them, as they do very well deserve, to be a curse and calamity to themselves.
Let any man judge, if a concern for any thing be in any case excusable, whether it be fit to talk of matters of this nature and importance with the same indifference as if he were demonstrating a dry proposition in Euclid, or making out a crabbed probleme in Apollonius Pergeus, being very well satis∣fied, nay, and perhaps overjoyed as Archi∣medes was when he leap'd out of the Bath, and Pythagoras when he offered an Heca∣tomb for a discovery, that he hath found the truth himself; and so sleeps quietly with an opinion of his skill, and with the satisfaction of a sober, mathematical assurance, but is not at all concerned whether any body else
 either know or believe as he does, and whe∣ther they do or no, yet the discovery may be such, however difficult and intricate in it self, that it may be of little or no conse∣quence to humane life.
Nay, I am so far from repenting the se∣verity of any expression I have used, that though it should happen to me as it did to him in Horace, Populus me sibilat, the Mobile are displeased and angry at me, yet notwith∣standing I would go on as he did, at mihi plaudo Ipse domi, and I shall be glad, when it seems good to fate, to walk along with him to the end of the verse, & tacita num∣mos contemplor in Arca. But if any of that party shall pretend to take up the Quarter∣staff against me, though he will doe well to follow my example, and take the advice of Horace along with him,

Sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam
Viribus, & versate diu, quid ferre recusent
Quid valeant humeri—

yet if he behave himself with civility towards me, I will either not answer him at all, or I will doe it with respect according as his per∣formance
 is; but if he have a mind to shew his angry parts, I will set him such a copy of Satyr, as neither he nor any of his party shall be able to follow, and I will let him see that I can doe what Isaac Vossius once threatned in a case of small moment in comparison of this, Ʋtimur nunc leni flabello, usuri etiam flagro si porrò molesti esse pergant, I will shew him that I have Scorpions as well as Whips, and that without translating Ovid against Ibis, I shall find matter enough at home to make him asham'd of himself and his performance; and without putting my self to the drudgery of imprecation, a thing very inconsistent with the goodness of my nature, which enclines me very strongly to wish well to all mankind, all I shall doe is to turn him upon himself, if he dare own his name, otherwise I have neither the patience to beat the air to no purpose, nor the cou∣rage and hardiness to fight with Goblins, that vanish out of sight, and assault a man be∣hind and before and on all sides at once, without any possibility of being hit them∣selves: but let him own himself as an au∣thour ought to do, and let him write so as to deserve an answer, and then let us have a
 clear stage and fair play, and from him no favour; or if instead of Satyr he have a mind to be more innocently wity, let him but mix a little seriousness with his wit, and let that seriousness be such as is not dull, and then I promise him (like Hippocrates his twins, a very old comparison, but it will be older before it is quite out of date) we will be wonderfull friends in the midst of the fray, and we will laugh and cry together, and I will follow him with a complement at the same time when I make a pass at the very heart of his cause, as the Retiarii in the Ro∣man Theatres were used to doe by their An∣tagonists, the Mirmillones, who had a fish graven or painted upon their shield:

Piscem peto,
Non te peto,
Quid me fugis, Galle?

But I had much rather that they, whoe∣ver they are that shall think it for their own credit, for otherwise I am sure they will hardly doe it for the interest of their cause, to concern themselves with such an unfledg'd authour, whom they may catch with chaff,
 as well as bird-lime, as they please them∣selves, I say, I had much rather that they would betake themselves to a serious and close way of writing, which notwithstan∣ding all the sharpness of the following dis∣course, which to be sure will be represented much greater than it is, I have very careful∣ly observed in it; neither is there any thing which I should more hate in my self, or more despise in another, than for a man to lose his argument in an impertinent wilderness either of wit or anger.
Therefore if any of that party be dissa∣tisfied, or hath a mind to pretend that he is so, with what I have said already upon the three following questions, in which all the matters in difference are contained.
First, Concerning Episcopal Government.
Secondly, Concerning humane impositions, in religious matters in the general, and
Thirdly, Concerning the particular impositi∣ons that are the occasion, or pretence, of Sepa∣ration from the Church of England.
Let him then enter the lists as soon as he pleases, and I promise Your Lordship I will not fail to answer him in defence of the e∣stablish'd Religion, and for the quieting the
 minds of his Majestie's good subjects against either the tricks or the mistakes of inconside∣rate or designing men; not that I pretend to be able to say much more upon these sub∣jects than I have done already, but some men will not be convinced by any thing at the first hearing, let it be never so plain, but they must have it over and over in other words and in a new appearance, till by de∣grees the truth is rendred so familiar to them as to subdue the prejudices they have imbi∣bed against it, or the mistake so palpable, that obstinacy begins to blush and be asha∣med.
And the better to prevent all artifice and cant, which do but perplex the cause and make all controversies endless, and cheat the world of their money and their time, to pre∣vent all squabbling about authorities, which is an incompetent way of arguing in this case, because men that are not able to search into these things themselves will be sure to believe the quotations of their own side, whether true of false, or whether they be rightly applied or not. For this reason I propose that we lay all arguments but those of nature aside.

For if it be found upon principles that are universally acknowledged, and such as make their appeal to every common under∣standing, that Episcopacy, that is, a superi∣ority on the one hand, and a dependence on the other, is the most perfect form of Go∣vernment both in Church and State, or in∣deed that there can be no lasting govern∣ment without it; that in the Church it secures the greatest reverence to the Clergy, by which they are the better enabled to influ∣ence the people, and by consequence to an∣swer the end of their institution and sepa∣ration to the ministerial office; if it give the greatest incouragement to learning, if it streng∣then the hands of discipline, as well with respect to the inferiour Clergy as the Layety, and if this be a natural means to secure the publick peace, then here is all that can be expected to justifie this form of government in the Church: and though the testimonies of antiquity may receive strength and advan∣tage from the nature of things, which is the onely true immutable antiquity to which we must appeal, yet those very testimonies, let them be never so numerous, unanimous and positive, when they have nature against
 them, what are they but so many confessions of ignorance or design? of want of honesty, or want of skill?
So also in the second enquiry, if it shall be found that humane impositions in religi∣ous matters are of absolute and indispensable necessity for the keeping any ecclesiastical so∣ciety together, for the preservation of peace and unity among men; if it follow plainly from the consideration of humane nature and humane passions, as well as from the experience of our own and former times, that without such impositions we must crum∣ble into sects as numerous as the motes that lie basking in a beam of the sun, or that lie basking in a beam of the sun, or that infinity of crowding stars by which the Ce∣lestial Galaxy is adorned: this is abundantly sufficient from the necessity of such hu∣mane institutions, to justifie their lawfulness, and to prove their obligation; and it is so far from being true, that there can be no external circumstance of religious worship appointed and ordained by men, which is not expresly revealed and set down in some place or other of the New Testament, that if on the contrary our Saviour and his Apostles had expresly told us that we must not so
 much as move an hand or a foot in any re∣ligious assembly or affair without express li∣cence and authority from them, which they have no where done, and yet at the same time had not adjusted the particular instan∣ces of our behaviour in these matters, which they have not done neither, all the inference that could have been made from this would be, that we must not worship God at all, which is a very odd sort of divine revelati∣tion.
Besides that, nothing can be more foo∣lish than to perswade to charity, to talk per∣petually of peace and love and such like luscious and delicious things, onely to make our mouths water, while at the same time we are deny'd the necessary means of secu∣ring so desirable blessings to our selves.
It would be true at this rate not onely in the event but in the design too, that our Saviour came not to bring peace but a sword, and the end of his coming, if he had any at all, being onely to set the world together by the ears, as it must be if he de∣ny the civil or ecclesiastical magistrate a power of determining those indifferent mat∣ters, which he hath not any where deter∣mined
 himself; this would be a plain argu∣ment that he was a gross impostour, instead of being, as he is, the prince of peace, and the most powerfull preacher, as well as the most perfect example of obedience.
From all which it follows unavoidably as to the third enquiry, which is concerning the particular ceremonies or impositions that are excepted against, that it is abundantly sufficient that there is a great deal to be said for them, but nothing at all that can with any shew of reason be objected against them; and to except against a ceremonie without giving some other reason, than onely that a man cannot comply with it, or because he is not satisfied with its lawfulness, though he knows not why it should be unlawfull nei∣ther, is an indefinite sort of exception that extends to one ceremonie as well as another, and with as good reason may be applied to all humane impositions whatsoever: where∣fore unless the magistrate will utterly de∣vest himself of all kind of power and autho∣rity whatsoever, as all is included consequen∣tially in this power of humane institutions in religious matters, he must lay down this as an unalterable rule and measure of proceeding
 never to dispense with any thing that is en∣joined, merely because his subjects are trou∣bled with the Mulligrubs, because they know not what they al, or what they would be at, or why they would have what they complain of altered and dispensed with; for this is to give up all into the hands of fancy, and which is still more dangerous, of design, and it is the same thing as if a Phanatick or his wife should long for a Crown jewel, not that they intend to make any use or advan∣tage of it, but onely it is a pretty thing, and the good woman will miscarry if she have it not, for it is certain if they be grati∣fied in this request, they will long for all the jewels one after another, and at last for the Crown and the prerogative themselves.
I am very far (My Lord) from going a∣bout to detract from the great and worthy performances of those who have ransacked antiquity to vindicate and defend our church, either against the Romanists on the one hand, or the Separation on the other; but yet it cannot be denied, that this instead of ending the controversie hath but had the unhappi∣ness to render it more perplext and difficult than before, and to swell the dispute into so
 large a compass that it is no more consi∣stent with an ordinary leizure, than with an ordinary education and capacity to consider it: however it is of absolute necessity that this be done, that the onely pretences to antiquity may not lie on the wrong side; notwithstan∣ding, that after we have done our best, when the best parts and the most accurate endea∣vours have been employed, men that are not Judges of these things for themselves will ra∣ther be cheated by their own writers than convinc'd by ours, and the writings of Blon∣del, Salmasius and Davilleé, not to say any thing of that Kidderminster stuff, which as course and as unfit for service as it is, is the usual wear of the Schismaticks of our times, will always be in better esteem among some men, if there be no other expedient used to convince them, than the most irrefragable and unanswerable demonstrations of the e∣piscopal Divines, who are either more able or more honest, or both of them, than they.
And though when antiquity does but con∣firm the true notion of things, or rather is it self strengthened and confirmed by them, it be in a manner needless, yet when either the ancients themselves are on the wrong side
 of nature, or are misapplied through igno∣rance, inadvertency or design to serve a turn, there is nothing so odious, so distast∣full to the palate, and so disagreeable to the stomach of a wise man, as to see a page groan under a heap of quotations, and a margent as full fraught with testimonies to no purpose, or to a very bad one, as an O∣range stuck with Cloves, or a Pheasant lar∣ded with Bacon.
But where time and reason are both of them of a mind, there indeed is it a double satisfaction to us to see that our ancestours before us were wise men, and that we tread in their steps, but the true reason why we ought to follow their example, is not perfect∣ly because they gave it, and for nothing else, for then we may follow bad examples, as well as good ones; but because their practice and ours is alike founded in the reason of things, and the interest of mankind, be∣cause nature is unchangeable and always the same, and because experience cannot deceive us, though antiquity may.
I have therefore chosen, because I am sa∣tisfied the venture is very safe, to put the stress of the whole controversie between the
 separatists and us upon this issue, that we may stand or fall as nature shall determine, and that we may proceed upon such principles as every man may judge and feel for him∣self whether they be true or no.
If it be better for us to let loose the reins of Government, without reason and with∣out end, as fast as any man that hath a bra∣zen face, or a weak understanding, or a sini∣ster design, shall come and say, My Conscience is tender, and it is but fit that Conscience should be heard (whether she can speak any thing for her self or no,) then let us let them loose, to make an experiment what the event will be, if former experiments will not resolve the case; but if it be better to keep up an uniform and strict discipline, if the interest of all be to be preferred before the humours of a few, and those of the meanest of the people, both for their quality and understanding; if all the fault of episcopal government and of humane institutions is, that they are not submitted to or obeyed as they should be; if this be a fault, not of the government or of the institutions themselves, but, of those that boggle at them and quarrel with them for no reason, and if the same humour and
 itch of disobedience may be as good an ar∣gument against any government in the world, and against all institutions whatsoe∣ver; if the Episcopacy be the best fitted to secure obedience, and to keep up discipline, to preserve peace and to reward merit, to make us happy and wise into the bargain, Then it is but fit and necessary that we conti∣nue as we are, and that without regarding peevish and unwarrantable scruples which can have no good influence, and will admit of no bounds or limits to restrain them, we encourage one another to stand to our old post, and say to each other, remembring the signaculum Crucis which we have received in token of our being souldiers under the sacred banner of the Cross, as the Centuri∣on said to his Ensign in Livy, when the se∣nate was deliberating whether or no they should remove to Veii, Sta signifer, statue signum hic manebimus optimé.
And this way of procedure I am the more satisfied with, because it gives me a new assurance of the universal influence and undoubted truth of those principles which I have formerly laid down to be the square and measure of obligation, and which being
 applied to any particular case, will in every thing resolve what is true or false.
Plenius & melius Chrysippo & Crantore,
Principles that will obtain to the confusion of Popery, enthusiasm and every evill work, when the envy of this age is under ground, and when the heads of two or three Meta∣physical Opiniatours are cold, whatever they may doe at present, of which I am not so∣licitous, but am content to take men and things as I find them, with as little distur∣bance and trouble as I can to my self.
Et mihi res, non me rebus submittere conor.
And as I have intimated already, nature and experience cannot deceive us, though antiquity may, it does not follow because such a polity or such a form of Government was in use among the ancients whether in church or state, that therefore the example of antiquity lays any manner of obligation upon us which is extrinsique to the reason of the thing, but as Livy saith of History in ge∣neral, hoc illud est praecipuè in cognitione rerum
 salubre ac frugiferum, omnis te exempli docu∣menta in illustri posita monumento intueri: inde tibi tuaeque Reip. quod imitere, capias, inde foe∣dum inceptu, foedum exitu, quod vites, I say, what he saith of History in general, the same is true of ecclesiastical history in parti∣cular, and though it does not follow that the Episcopal government is therefore of neces∣sity the best, because antiquity submitted to it, who possibly in this as well as many o∣ther things may very well be mistaken, for the ancients were but men no more than we, yet when the history of all the several ages of the Church, shall not onely recommend this government to us by its perpetual and uninterrupted example, but shall also inform us over and above how usefull and expedient this government hath always been to the preservation of the peace and unity of the Church, and how fatal the disobedience of Presbyters to their Bishop hath been found, by being the occasion of great calamities and disorders in it, as well of old time, as now of late in the experience of our own age and nation; in this case antiquity backed by experience gives us all the assurance which it is possible for us to receive in a matter of
 this nature, that the Episcopal constitution as being found by experience to be the most wholsome for the preservation of the Chur∣ches health, and for the preventing all those maladies and diseases to which the body Ec∣clesiastick would otherwise be exposed, is therefore unquestionably the best that can be thought of, and hath besides a right of immemorial prescription, the advantage of long experience, which in matters of this nature, is the most powerfull reason, to re∣commend it to us.
It is with government in the body poli∣tick, as it is with medicines in the natural, the end of medicine is health, and the end of government is obedience and peace; and therefore though it does not follow because Hippocrates or Galen in a case proposed made such or such a recipe, consisting of such in∣gredients, and compounded in such propor∣tions together, that therefore the Physicians of our times whenever the same case occurs must of necessity prescribe after the same manner, for we must examine not onely in∣to the prescription it self, but also into the success of it with respect to the patient, we must compare patient and patient, and
 then patient and prescription together, we must allow for the difference of climate, constitution and diet betwixt one patient and another, and if when all these things have been considered, such a course of phy∣sick, or such a method of cure in such a case proposed shall be found to have been successfull in the time of those old Physi∣cians and ever since, here is an Empirical demonstration which cannot easily deceive us, what we are to doe at this time of the day, and in this case antiquity joined to suc∣cess is a very powerfull argument in behalf of the prescription or the method given, and look how much greater the antiquity is, and how much more frequent the cases that have occurred, and the good success that hath all along attended them have been, so much the stronger is the argument which is drawn from antiquity in their behalf, not so much for the sake of the antiquity it self, as for the success and good fortune of the course that hath been taken.
Wherefore the end of physick being health as the end of government is good order and obedience, and the fitness of means being to be measured by their suitableness to that end
 to which they are directed, it is manifest that experience must determine the controversie in both cases, and as that physick, or that diet or that air, is certainly the best, which hath the most wholsome and salutary effects, upon the natural body, so is that sort of establishment or polity whether in Church or State un∣doubtedly the best, which hath always been found to be most productive of peace, most powerfully influential upon obedience and good order, and the best fitted to prevent the inconveniences with which the want or absence of government would be atten∣ded.
Therefore the question is this, what sort of government is that which is most for the Churches health, and peace, and safety? is it a co-ordinate administration, or will it be better, for the obtaining of these ends, that its government, as it is in the body na∣tural and in all other political bodies what∣soever, do not consist of parts that are all of them of equal dignity or power, but that one part be dependent upon another, and that the whole be knit together by a steady and regular subordination?

Let us put the case in an army, can that army be well governed all whose officers have equal power and dignity with one a∣nother? or did not the rebels themselves in the late unhappy times, when they raised an army, and levied an unnatural war against their king, did not they make this difference in the commissions which they gave, that some were to be Generals, others Major and Lieutenant Generals, others commanders of Tertia's or Brigades, Colonels of Regiments, and so down to Captains, Lieutenants and Ensigns? now either this depended upon the nature of government in the general, or it did not; if it did, as what is an army but an armed commonwealth or city submit∣ting to certain rules of discipline and obedi∣ence within themselves? then the nature of government is in both cases the same, and consequently a subordination in the church militant is every whit as necessary for the preservation of its unity and peace, as it was in the schism either militant or trium∣phant. But if it do not depend upon the nature of government and society conside∣red in the general, then there is no reason why an army may not be managed by a
 parity of officers, which if it could once be effected it would save a great deal of that unnecessary expence, which is now thrown away, as it should seem, to no purpose upon the great field-officers and the commanders in chief whether of whole Regiments or greater parties.
To carry this comparison a little farther, because the power of the Presbyters in our times is pretended to be swallowed up in that of the Bishop, like the rods of the Ma∣gicians by the rod of Moses, contrary, as it seems, to the practice of the primitive times, we may observe that in the affairs of a pri∣vate company, it is but reasonable that the captain should advise with the rest of the commission-officers, and not manage all things wholly by himself, but yet the power of summoning and dissolving the assembly is still entirely in him, and he hath a nega∣tive at least, entirely to himself, so that without his consent and concurrence no∣thing can be done, as to all those things that are within the cognisance and sphere of his authority, but if the commander in chief of the whole regiment were to consult with his officers for their common interest and
 safety, it is most likely that he would ad∣vise onely with the captains of the respective companies, and in a great council of war, where so great a multitude would breed confusion, there the private captains are not regarded neither, but onely the hief offi∣cers and principal commanders of the grea∣ter parties, in all which assemblies, for disci∣pline and good order sake, the general must be supposed to have his negative, and as the assembly is called by his authority, so to have a power likewise of dissolving it as he pleases.
And this hath always been the custome in the Ecclesiastical model, a Bishop in the ancient practice of the Church was used al∣most in all matters to advise and deliberate concerning the affairs of his diocese with his Presbyters about him, and from thence it came to pass that the whole assembly or the place where they met, is sometimes by the ancientest of the Greek fathers termed, , the Bishop being indeed, if, with∣out using words which we do not under∣stand we will frame to our selves an intel∣ligible notion of the thing it self, onely the chief or superintendent of the Presbyters ha∣ving
 an inspection over them and over the whole diocese, as they had over their parti∣cular charges, but still the Bishop had his negative and consequently almost the whole power of administration in his own hands; for otherwise than this I can by no means un∣derstand the language of St. Jerome, who though in this he be so widely mistaken that he will not have this government to have been ordained in the church by Christ him∣self, yet he confesses that it was as old as the contentions between Paul and Apollos and Ce∣phas, and that it was made use of as an ex∣pedient to restore the churches peace, which I think to be a very apt translation of those words, ut schismatum semina tollerentur, but now what peace there could be, or how this was a possible expedient of procuring it, where the Bishop had not a negative voice in the assembly, I confess I do not understand.
Again as no laws could be made with∣out the episcopal Le veult, and on the con∣trary all proceedings were stopt in every particular diocesan assembly by the nega∣tive saviseroit of the Bishop, so as to those canons and constitutions that were enacted, the Bishop was the person who was chiefly
 concerned to look after their performance and to punish their neglect; and as no ecclesiasti∣cal sanction could be made without him, so the executive power was in a manner entire∣ly his, he was to see that every pastour did his duty, he was to censure and punish the delinquents against it, and in a controversie arising whether this or that particular pastour had broken his canonical obedience or no, or done any thing which was disagreeable to his function or his obligation, the last dioce∣san appeal was to the Bishop, and without gran∣ting him as much power as this comes to, it is utterly impossible to make sense of the words of St Jerome, in toto orbe decretum est, ut unus de presbyteris electus superponeretur caeteris ad quem omnis Ecclesiae cura pertineret, ut schisma∣tum semina tollerentur; for how the bishop could be said in every diocese to be set over the Presbyters, how the care of the whole church or diocese could be said to be com∣mitted to him, and that for this end, to pre∣serve the peace of the church, or how that peace could be preserved without all this power which I have allotted to him, fateor me scire juxta cum ignarissimis, and if there be any man else that can explain it to me,
 let him pass from hence forward for the De∣lian Diver or for the Delphick Apollo.
But though in this or that particular diocese the power of the Presbyters seems to have been somewhat greater than it is now-a-days, and yet, as I have proved, it was not so con∣siderable neither, yet as the Bishop did ad∣vise with his Presbyters as to the affairs of his own diocese, and perhaps did scarce doe any thing of moment without their concurrence and direction in it, so in the Provincial Sy∣nods which were convened together for the more regular and uniform administration of several such diocesses together, both as to matters of discipline and belief and much more in the general councils or oecumenical dy∣ets of the whole Christian Church, the whole affair was transacted by the Bishops, and yet the canons and constitutions that were then agreed upon were obligatory to all the Pres∣byters within the jurisdiction of those Bi∣shops of which the assembly consisted, and these constitutions did without question de∣termine the most important cases, they appli∣ed a remedy to all the greater evils of the church, and laid down all the most general and most concerning rules of discipline and
 obedience, so that the conferences of the re∣spective Bishops with their particular clergy, so far as any thing new was established or enacted by them were onely about particu∣lar cases which could not be sufficiently fore∣seen or provided for by the larger assemblies, and for the most part about matters of lesser moment.
But the Presbyters, as small a share as they had in the government of the church, for it appears upon more accounts than one to have been but very small, yet being used upon so frequent occasions to advise with their Bishop, and the Bishop not being used to determine any new matter or issue out a∣ny new order without their consent, this was in process of time, an occasion of the Pres∣byters aspiring after more power, of their confronting and opposing their Bishop, and taking upon them more than became them or than was for the peace of the Church, which seems to have given occasion in part to Clemens his epistle to the Corinthians, and to Ignatius his so frequent and so passionate exhortations to the Presbyters to pay that duty and obedience which they owed to their Bishop, as the messenger of God and the
 vicegerent of Christ in that particular dio∣cese wherein he was placed, but when all these endeavours of good and holy men, proved ineffectual, as all exhortation is inef∣fectual with the generality of mankind, where there is not a power sufficient to force obe∣dience, it seemed good at last to the wise∣dom of the Church, to remove the occasi∣ons of such evils for the future by enlarging the power of the Bishop, and to curb the in∣solence of the Presbytery by removing its cause, which was their meeting together with him in the diocesan convocation upon any occasional emergence that might happen; but yet the Bishop was not by this means rendred absolute neither, but there lay an appeal from him to the Metropolitan or Patriarch, to a provincial or oecumenical dyet, and to the standing canons and consti∣tutions of the church, which it was not in his power to violate or alter, and in which all the great lines of obedience, were con∣tained.
And this alteration in the government of the church depended upon the same reason with the disanulling popular elections either of Bishops or particular pastours, which being
 found by long and wofull experience to be the occasion of perpetual tumult and dis∣order in the church, the fruitfull parent of everlasting feuds, animosities and factions to the unspeakable detriment both of church and state, was in process of time partly disu∣sed of it self by the peoples being weary of so troublesome a right, and partly by the inter∣position of imperial rescripts, and by the au∣thority of the civil laws of our own and o∣ther nations.
It was very natural in the beginnings of the church to allow some what more to the Presbyters in consultation with their Bishop, and to the people in the choice of both, than was consistent with the policy of after-times because,
—Pueris dant crustula blandi
Doctores elementa velint ut discere prima. when churches and ecclesiastical societies were first to be gathered, men were to be allured by privileges, and to be enticed by power, a thing of which all mankind are naturally very fond, as well as to be convin∣ced by arguments to espouse the cause and
 interest of Christianity; but when the reli∣gion of Christ had taken deep root in the world, when the temptations of honour and preferment, and the dangers of persecution from the Pagan powers were now utterly removed and extinguished, and when at the same time, the world being turned Christian, the dangers and inconveniences of popular elections increased with the number of the electours, and the Presbytery by reason of their number began to be formidable to the Bishop, as well as troublesome and tumultu∣ous among one another, which must of ne∣cessity have been the occasion of very great calamities, and very sad as well as frequent revolutions if a timely stop were not put, this made it necessary upon the same princi∣ple of convenience to abrogate this power, upon which it seems first to have been in∣troduced, if indeed it were introduced upon any reason at all but onely a gradual and insensible encroachment in both cases, and upon the supinity in or neglect of the gover∣nours of the church, who did not possibly foresee those horrid inconveniences with which this way of management would af∣terwards be attended.

For my part I am so firmly of opinion, that the great design of religion is charity, good-will and peace, that I take it to be a certain argument of an institution or custome essentially bad when it is directly calculated for the disturbance of the world, and what∣ever becomes of the antiquity of the busi∣ness, which is used to afford matter of spe∣cious discourse on both sides of the questi∣on in several important cases and particular∣ly in these which I have so lately mentioned; yet if it could be proved that antiquity and interest were fallen out with one ano∣ther, it is in this case but reasonable to con∣sider that the longer we and our fore-fathers have laboured under the painfull and preju∣dicial consequences of errour, the more it would behove us to think of a reformation, which if it be not allowed to be a good argument in behalf of truth, the Protestant Religion will be utterly unable to defend it self; and we should consider likewise that even in point of antiquity, nature, and the standing interest of the world are much an∣cienter things than any the oldest custome can pretend to be, and therefore if antiqui∣ty be the measure by which we are resolved
 to proceed, it will follow that nature and interest must prescribe to custome and not custome to them.
Nay, if it could be never so demonstrably proved that our Saviour did by his example or by his institution recommend to posterity the presbyterian modell, or the congregational way, though it can hardly be supposed that he who was God as well as man, could be guilty of so great a mistake in the true art and mystery of government, yet these being found afterwards by experience to be very inconsistent with the great end of the Gospel, which is charity and peace, it is manifest that the means having onely a relative or conditional nature, and being to be either used or rejected in proportion to their fitness or unsuitableness to their end, the end of the Gospel, which is peace, would have obliged posterity to alter that institution, though of Christ himself, which was found by experi∣ence to be inconsistent with it; or rather, since the declared design of our Saviour's coming into the world was to reconcile God to men, and men to one another, and since the causeless feuds and animosities of men do set them at enmity with God, as well as a∣mong
 themselves, since they extinguish that calm, serene and charitable spirit, without which neither our persons nor our sacrifices can be accepted, since it is impossible, in the language of St. John to love God whom we have not seen, unless we can also love our brother whom we have seen, this would have been a plain argument, when he preached peace and yet established such a form of government as had a direct or a comparative tendency to confusion, one of which is the case of the Independent churches, and the other of the Presbyterian form with relation to the more perfect and compleat establishment of the Episcopal subordination; I say, it would have been a plain argument either that he had war in his heart, notwithstanding that his words were smoother than oyle, and that though he talked of peace, yet he designed conten∣tion, or else if he were sincere in what he did, that he did not understand the message he came about, and in either of those cases he must be acknowledged to be a gross impostour, when he pretended to be sent from God, for God sends no man to disturb the world, un∣less it be for our sins, as other great plagues and calamities are inflicted, but how was he
 then that auspicious, mercifull and benign Prince, the Prince of peace, and the son of him that is the father of mercies, in whom all the families of the earth were to be blessed?
And for the same reason I affirm that all the declaimers of the separation, whose lungs are employed in blowing the coals of strife, and in dividing friends, relations and coun∣trymen from one another, cannot possibly pretend a mission from heaven for what they doe, unless they can first prove that the terms of communion in the church of En∣gland are unlawfull to be submitted to, nay, that they are utterly inconsistent with salva∣tion, but when they offer no manner of rea∣son for so destructive a schism, so pernici∣ous to our peace at home, and to our power and interest abroad, but onely tell us with a splay mouth and a ridiculous tone that they cannot in conscience, that is, they will not comply; (for this reason is infinite, and therefore ought not to be allowed without a more particular and satisfactory plea) that such a thing is superstitious, they cannot tell why, and that they are for greater purity and greater edification, that is, for infinite schism, separation and confusion; for noise
 and non-sense and eternal dashing of one disagreeing party against another, as if the breach of charity, the destruction of good order, and the subversion of government were the true methods of edification, that is, as if building up and pulling down were the same, or as if they that have the meanest parts, the least acquired learning, the most confused sentiments and the most unintelligible notions, which is plainly the case of the Nonconformists at this day, were the best qualified for in∣structing the people; or as if they that hate the government and persecute all that love it, with a virulence not to be equall'd by a∣ny but themselves, were fit to be entrusted with the doctrine of obedience, and were to be permitted in a christian common wealth to have the conduct and governance of souls that have a civil capacity as well as a sacred, and are obliged for God's sake to be subject to every lawfull ordiance of man, and cer∣tainly, either nothing is lawfull in this world, or else humane impositions and Episcopal govern∣ment are so, when they are found by the ex∣perience of so many ages to be either of ab∣solute necessity to the publick peace which is the case of the former, or at least the best
 fitted to establish and secure it, which is the true pinch of the controversie, as to the latter:
Quis Coelum Terrae non misceat & mare Coelo?
Or may it not be consistent, even with the meekness of a Christian spirit to call for fire from heaven upon such bold miscreants that pretend a commission from it to unhinge the world, and to set all manking together by the ears, onely for the sake of two or three signisicant ceremonies, and because they are significant, that is, because they tend to that which they plead so much for, and talk so loudly concerning, that is, edification, for o∣therwise what they signifie I cannot imagine, and I entreat some of them to tell me.
And yet if these things were abated, it is not to be hoped without a severe prosecution of the penal laws, that ever the separation will cease together with them, which under the disguise of religion is indeed nothing else but a Republican faction, which the enemies of monarchy will be sure to cherish so long as they can or dare, so that it is observable though they have been driven fourty times from one
 station to another, and though they know not where to fix to entrench themselves safe∣ly against the assaults of truth, though the pleas alter almost with the seasons of the year, and with the returns of the day, yet the separation it self continues still the same, or hath rather been every day more obstinate and inveterate than the other, till the laws began to rouse their drowsie heads, and shew that they were not merely a dead and lifeless letter, which it is natural for a Phanatick to despise.
Nay, though there were not, as there is, in the bottom of Phanaticism, a Republican design, yet what terms of accommodation can possibly be expected, when there are so many whose onely trade is schism, and who get the very bread they eat by keeping up their party; whose kitchins must be cold and bellies empty, whenever that fatal day shall overtake them, in which the Conventicles are not full and reeking with the unnatural steams of separation.
However such is the wise temperament and constitution of the church of England, that it hath left the Presbyters no reason to complain, inasmuch as they are not obliged
 by any Canon or Ecclesiastical sanction to which themselves have not given their free and full assent in convocation, by their re∣presentatives at least, if not in their own per∣sons, which is exactly the same sort of assent which the free subjects and free-holders of England give to those laws which are enacted in Parliament, their consent being included in that of their Knight or Burgess, and the major part of the representatives including the whole, as reason and custome do require in all assem∣blies of this nature, is at the same time inter∣preted as the act of the commons of England, who are represented in the whole assembly.
But it is easie to see by the disorders that frequently happen in so small a number, what confusion it would make, if all the people or the free-holders of England, were actually to have a vote in the passing of e∣very law, as by the disturbances which of∣ten-times happen in the Livery, which is a smaller body, in the Guild-hall of London, it is obvious to any man at the first sight how much more intolerable the mischief would be if all the freemen were admitted to a right of suffrage, from whence to avoid those confusions they are now excluded.

And the same tumults and disorders would no question happen if all the Clergy-men in England being in both orders, were admitted to a liberty of voting in the convocation, for Clergy-men have passions and designs too, as well as other men, and being supposed by their function to be of the wiser and lear∣neder sort, this naturally makes every man the more zealous to betray his ignorance, when he cannot shew his wit or understan∣ding; he will be sure to make up in noise and bustle what he wants in knowledge, and it will always happen in this case, that the Bishops and the wisest and best men will be born down with the crowd of the infe∣riour Clergy, who being men oftentimes of little maintenance and as little parts, will as naturally comply and side with the humour of the people, as it is natural for the people themselves in all nations, as often as they can or dare to affront their governours, and disobey the laws, which however just and e∣quitable in themselves, and however well tem∣pered and proportioned to the happiness of those to whom they are prescribed, they look upon as yokes, that are not to be born and will be sure to break them as if they were so.

To which it is to be added, that where so many are concerned in the dispatch of an af∣fair, besides the feuds and contentions, which different humours, interests and designs would create, it would occasion infinite delays and difficulties in their proceedings, which would often times prove fatal to their designs, and utterly disappoint the end of their coming together.
And what hath been said of the whole Clergy's meeting in one or in the two several and distinct convocations of Canterbury and York, the same inconveniences would in pro∣portion attend the diocesan assemblies, if a∣ny such were practised, wherein the Bishop had no greater power than onely to be as it were the Chairman or Prolocutour of the Synod, but could not move one foot himself with∣out the consent of a majority of the members of which it was composed, especially in so populous a diocese as Your Lordship's is, where the power and interest of a factious Clergy-man may be of such dismal conse∣quence to the peace of the church; but such is Your Lordship's paternal condescention, mixt with an exact judgment and profound wisedom, that You have found out an hap∣py
 temperament betwixt the authority of the Bishop on the one hand and the dange∣rous power of the Presbyters on the other, by admitting your Clergy to so frequent con∣ferences and familiar debates concerning the common interest of the church, and the re∣spective good and advantage of their parti∣cular charges, yet so as not to admit them to a liberty of controlling their Bishop, or invest them with a power which may be em∣ployed to bad purposes as well as be made usefull and serviceable to good ones, of which though at present there can be no danger, in a diocese so well stored with men equally conspicuous for integrity, prudence and lear∣ning, for loyalty to the King, and obedience to their Bishop, and love to one another, and care of their particular charges and flocks, yet that may be pernicious and destructive in its example which is not so in it self, and power when it is once given to the best of men, is not so easily taken away from worse that may happen to succeed them, as it may be employed to purposes very contrary and opposite to those for which it was intended; otherwise there is no question but it is the indispensible duty of every Bishop, to main∣tain
 a constant intercourse and correspon∣dence with his Clergy, that he may the bet∣ter understand, as well them, as the diocese which he is to govern, and may be the bet∣ter enabled to make a judgment of both, and accordingly to proportion the expedients of publick peace and safety with a wise and skilfull hand; and that he may conciliate that love and reverence to his person by the affability and obliging sweetness of his con∣versation, without which all power is ty∣ranny and force, and will not onely be resisted but overcome. Wherefore I pray God that the church may always be blest as long as time shall endure, with such faithfull, vigi∣lant and prudent Bishops as Your Lordship, and with so pious, learned and obedient a Clergy, as that in which this diocese in par∣ticular and the whole nation in general is at present happy.
But what it is that they mean who would extend the power of the Presbyters with re∣lation to their Bishop any farther than this, or who declaim so loudly for the peoples right in the election of their pastours, I can∣not possibly conceive, unless it be that they do seriously design and purposely intend to
 bring us all into confusion, which it is not much to be doubted but there are some that do, or that being engaged in an interest they are ashamed to retract their errour, and therefore grasp at all arguments how weak so∣ever to defend it, which it is very natural for mankind to doe; or lastly, that they are not so wise men as they would be thought to be, and that they do not see into the pernicious consequences of so mischievous a doctrine, which stands condemned by the unalterable decrees of nature, and by the fundamental maximes upon which cities are built, and by which humane society is supported.
I should be sorry to perceive my self thus insensibly engaged in so long a disquisition concerning the natural grounds upon which the episcopal government relies, very much contrary to my first intention which was far from any thought of treating so distinct∣ly, and as it were ex professo at this time up∣on this subject, did I not hope to doe some service to the church by giving an account of my sentiments upon it, and were I not possessed with a very great inward as∣surance that this way of procedure in the matter under debate, that is, by an appeal
 to the Principles of nature and to the funda∣mental maximes of society, whether it be civil or ecclesiastical, or of what kind soever, is that which is liable to the least exception, and is by consequence the most certain and in∣fallible expedient of bringing those with whom we have to doe, to a sense of their duty and an acknowledgment of their mistake; which if it could be done, it would be happy for us all, and therefore with Your Lordship's good leave I will proceed to what remains, refer∣ring my self humbly to the things that have been or shall be spoken upon a question of so great importance, to intercede with Your Lordship and all that shall reade this Preface in my behalf, if by my too great length I have offended,
Wherefore to improve the comparison of an army, that is, an armed city or society, yet a little farther, for it is not yet stretched out to its full length, since it appears so plainly by the consent of all ages and by the constant practice of the world, that such a body of men cannot be managed by a pa∣rity of officers, the next thing to be conside∣red is whether the imparity or superiority of one officer over another be consistent with
 an equality of salary or revenue? and for this we have the same universal experience and consent, that the pay of the greater officers is proportionably larger according to their respective dignity and place, and the same is to be seen in civil as well as military em∣ployments, that the great officers of state, the Judges of the law, and ministers of pub∣lick justice, according to their respective dignity and superiority over one another, so are the pensions and advantages annext to their employments for the most part propor∣tionably greater; and if the church so far as concerns the general nature of a society be the same, and do as naturally require an im∣parity of officers as either the civil or milita∣ry subordination, so do the several impari∣ties of dignity and power as unavoidably call for an inequality of revenue, the reason of which in all the three cases is this, that man∣kind are used to pay a reverence to their su∣periours, not so much for their own sakes, as for the sake of some outward appearance, formality and shew, for hospitality which they keep, and for the train and equipage that attends them, and therefore this is ano∣ther fault of the Presbyterian government
 with hath not yet been mentioned, that it can never be so readily obeyed by the people, because it wants those outward appearances of magnificence and splendour, which are the natural causes of reverence and esteem among men, and which it is much more easie for them to obey, than to submit themselves to the disciplinarian rigour of such as are upon the level with themselves; for this is deeply rooted in the very nature of government, that men will always pay a reverence to the port and grandure of those that are placed over them, but if you devest them of their trappings and attendance, they lose their authority together with them, and will as infallibly be despised, as ever they were esteemed or reverenced before.
It is true indeed that power without wise∣dom will lose it self, and will unavoidably produce either hatred or contempt, by ty∣ranny on the one hand, or by too much ea∣siness and softness on the other; but it is every whit as true that though wisedom be that for which all mankind have a natural inward reverence and veneration, yet whether it be from emulation, or ambition, or whatever be the cause, but so it is in experiment,
 which is the surest way to distinguish truth and falshood in these matters, that the per∣son of a wise man is usually disregarded, where the splendour and appearance of a great one is wanting, at least thus much must be acknowledged on all hands to be true, that a wise and good man with the ad∣vantages of honour and preferment suitable to his worth, is capable of doing more good in the world, and of influencing mankind more powerfully by his authority and ex∣ample, than he that wants those advantages to recommend him.
Wherefore the great stress of the question lies here, is it at all necessary that there should be any set apart to the office of the mini∣stery, that is to say, to be the preachers and examples of obedience and good life? If it be not, if we are so governable and so good of our selves that we stand in need of no monitour to put us in mind of our duty, I see no need at all we have of any Clergy to instruct us; for at this rate every man would be a Priest to himself, his life would be the best of Sermons to men, and the most powerfull and effectual prayer to God; mu∣tual examples would preach to one another,
 they would encourage and approve them∣selves, they would excite and animate each other, and the earth would be as happy as heaven it self, the habitation of the blessed, and the seat of glorified and immortal spi∣rits.
But since the case is clear otherwise, since it appears by every days experience that the world is overrun by luxury and vice, by e∣vil habits, and by bad examples, by strife and faction, by animosities, contentions, quarrels, feuds and emulations; since these are the great plagues of humane life, and since the removal of these, or at least the a∣bating, as much as is possible, of their malig∣nity and destructive influence, is the greatest blessing and benefit that can befall us, and yet a task so difficult to be performed, that all the zeal and diligence of the best and the wisest men is little enough to bring so happy and so desirable an event to pass, it follows unavoidably from the consideration of these things,
First, that it is naturally necessary that in every nation there should be a regular and standing Priesthood, whose business and em∣ployment it should be to perswade to charity,
 good-will and friendship, to preach obedi∣ence, repentance and amendment, and to exhort to a constant and assiduous practice of all whether personal or political vertues, which are the onely expedients of publick and of private peace.
And, Secondly, that for the better enfor∣cing the doctrine which they preach, they should have an honourable subsistence dealt among them, lest otherwise their persons and their functions fall into contempt, which they cannot doe without detriment to the publick, if it be true, what cannot without abundance of waywardness and wilfulness be denied, that such an order of men is at all usefull or serviceable to it.
And because all greatness is in it self not an absolute, but a comparative thing, it is ma∣nifest that the grandeur of the Clergy, must be taken in proportion from the other parts of the government, that so all the parts of the civil and ecclesiastical state may have a symmetry with one another; for instance, there ought to be a Bishop of a diocese as well as a Lord Lieutenant of a County, a metropolitan of more dioceses taken toge∣ther, as well as a Praetor, Proconsul, or Bassa
 of a Province, and a patriarchal, as well as an imperial seat having several such Provin∣ces under its jurisdiction.
The reason of which is founded in the nature of society, and in the unquestiona∣ble maxims of the truest policy, that there ought always to be a proportion and har∣mony inviolably preserved betwixt the civil constitution and the ecclesiastical; and I ap∣peal to any man of common understanding whether, besides the envy and opposition that such an establishment would meet with, it would not be ridiculous and monstrous in the body politick, for any Clergy-man to challenge or arrogate to himself the state, revenue and equipage of a Patriarch in an Hans Town of Germany, or in one of the an∣cient commonwealths of Italy or Greece; or whether it would not as infallibly be an e∣qual deviation from the rules of govern∣ment, if in a large Empire converted to Christianity, such as the Roman was of old, after the time of Constantine the great, no Clergy-man should be higher than a Parish Priest.
I have very frequently in my mind despi∣sed that Phanatick argument against Popery,
 (God keep us from such defenders of the Protestant Religion) that Paul worked with his own hands, and Peter was a poor fisher∣man, great in nothing but his faith and suf∣ferings, and in the supernatural gifts that were bestowed upon him; whereas his pre∣tended successour in the Apostolical chair, as he is, at this day, a very great temporal Prince, rowling in wealth, and armed with power, and furnished with all the Regalia belonging to the Triple Crown, so he as∣sumes at least a spiritual authority over all the Princes and potentates of the Christian world.
For though I do not believe the Pope or any Bishop to have such a power over Prin∣ces as that they may depose them, or ab∣solve their subjects from their allegiance, or that they can commission any to hurt or annoy their sacred persons, and much more to destroy or kill the Lord's annointed, to whom our Saviour and the Apostles them∣selves have given us so powerfull examples and so frequently inculcated Precepts of o∣bedience, whose persons are and ought to be inviolable by the laws of nature, and by the unalterable constitutions upon which all
 humane society is founded, which can ne∣ver be at peace within it self, if the sove∣reign be accountable to any power but of God.
And though I do not think there can be such a thing in nature as an universal Bishop, any more than there can be an oecumenical Monarch whom all mankind shall obey, it being an unmanageable and unwieldy charge which no one man can possibly undergo with so much care and vigilance as is intrin∣sick and essential to the duty of a Bishop; yet thus much I believe, that let a temporal do∣minion be as large as it will, it is necessary to the ends of an ecclesiastical society, which is to provide for the peace and unity of all its members, that as there is one King or Monarch over the whole, so there should also be one Patriarch or Metropolite, to whom all the rest of the Bishops should be in some sort accountable, and upon whom they should have a dependence, as their respective dioceses are accountable to themselves, and as the particular flocks are likewise to pay a spiritual obedience to the several pastours or presbyters that are placed over them; be∣cause by this means it comes to pass that
 the government is all of a piece, and the unity of the church, which is Christ's body, is preserved, by the members being fitly framed together, as well with respect to one another, as to their head.
Without this it is impossible to prevent schisms and contentions in the church, and by consequence troubles and revolutions in the state, or at least there is not all the care taken to prevent them, which humane pru∣dence and foresight might have used; and for the same reason that there are such dif∣ferences and inequalities in power, there ought also to be a like disparity in the out∣ward formalities of secular appearance and greatness, otherwise the establishment of such a subordinate power will be a design that will not take effect, an establishment that can neither be so strong nor so lasting as it is intended to be.
For as obedience is the cause of peace, so are respect and reverence the most natural and the most lasting causes of obedience, and it is that which they call the Typhus se∣cularis, the pomp and vanity of this wicked world; as vain and as wicked as it is, it is a shew of grandeur, an appearance of power,
 a plentifull table, a numerous dependance, and a long train of moenical servants, be∣longing to a wise man, who knows how to make use of these things for the good of the world, that is the most certainly produc∣tive cause of reverence and respect; it is that which, bating the terrours of the rods and axes, and setting the fears of punishment a∣side, hath a magnetick nature to attract obe∣dience, and a power of persuasion to make it an easie and a voluntary thing: Whereas though it be true that no society can subsist without fear, yet it is true likewise that it can never possibly be strong and lasting, unless that fear be tempered by esteem and love; and as the latter of these without the former would be every whit as unconstant and un∣certain as the changeable humour of a fickle mistress, so would the former divorc'd and separated from the latter, be in its subject the vassallage of slaves, and in its object the barbarity and fierceness of a cruel tyrant, which will not be endured any longer than needs must.
For man is naturally a disobedient crea∣ture, and therefore when he feels himself a∣bused and opprest, there is his interest added
 to his natural inclination to prompt him to rebell; but when a government proceeds by wise and sober measures, though every man would be glad to be uppermost himself, yet when he sees a moral impossibility lying in his way, that ever he should arrive to the top of his desires, and when he can propose greater and more certain advantages to him∣self by obeying his superiours than by con∣spiring or murmuring against them, this creates in him an artificial or a secondary in∣clination to be content with his condition, and to obey the authority that is placed o∣ver him; and still the wiser any man is, the more he considers the mischiefs of conten∣tion, the sad effects of confusion, the grea∣ter likelyhood that there is of losing his own fortune in the publick scramble, than of getting another man's, besides the tenderness that all men have for life, and the folly of en∣countring with the most dreadfull dangers upon an improbable prospect of advantage, and this makes him the more willing and rea∣dy to acquiesce in present things, and to pro∣pose to himself no other than such advanta∣ges, as may be acquired with the good leave of the government, and with consistence to his duty.

But where the mold and frame of the constitution it self is such, that men are in a manner upon a levell with their gover∣nours, and do by consequence universally despise them, here is a conspiracy ready for∣med, without the White-horse consults or the Wild-house caballs, to resist and overthrow it, and the general disposition which is in all to disobey, makes the government it self pre∣carious and uncertain, which was the great fault of the Presbyterian establishment; for, besides that equality is the parent of disor∣der, the eternal source of strife, animosity and contention, and breaks out unavoidably into independency, anarchy and confusion, I say besides this, men do not so easily sub∣mit themselves to the discipline in Cuerpo, as to the solemnity of the present constitution, and to the grave and fatherly reproofs or censures of a wise and learned Bishop; so that what they wanted of the natural causes of obedience, they were forced to supply by severity and rigour, or rather, every thing seems like rigour and severity, where we have a mean or no opinion of the persons that command, for every thing they enjoin hath the force and appearance of tyranny
 and usurpation, and arbitrary government, when the governours placed upon the levell with our selves do not look as if they had a natural right to challenge any duty or obe∣dience from us.
The contrivers of this modell were very sensible of this disadvantage, and therefore the better to reconcile the people to it, they very wisely called their lay-neighbours in, to come and take upon them a share of the ad∣ministration; the lay-elders were to rule the Parishes and to fill the consistories, and the people, which is without question a very fine sort of government, were to be gover∣ned by themselves, not considering that as lay-men neither are nor can be fit judges in ecclesiastical matters, so in the general they do not understand sufficiently the nature of laws and the design of punishment, they have not sufficiently considered the wise pro∣portions and temperaments of mercy and justice, they have not for the most part such a sense of humanity, or such a comprehen∣five prospect of the interest of the world, and of the natural issues and results of hu∣mane actions, as is requisite to qualifie them duely for the charge of being publick censors
 and perpetual supervisors over the belief and manners of their brethren; but it oftentimes comes to pass that he who is the richest man in a Parish, and by that means puts in most powerfully for a mongrell Presbyter, is very far from being either the wisest or the honestest in that circuit, and if he be of an insolent humour, as many of that sort are when they get into power, for want of stu∣dy and liberal education, (besides the con∣stitutional frailties which are common to all men) if his temper be rather overweening than overwise, and if he have gotten his e∣state by injustice and oppression: I need not say what an excellent government we are like to have, when men thus qualified are got into the saddle, the thing speaks but too plainly and too loudly for it self, so that this device though a very proper expedient, till the inconveniences of it began to be experi∣enced, to cully in the vulgar to a comply∣ance with this promising modell, that see∣med as if it were intended to make all men governours, yet upon experiment it will al∣ways be found to be one of the true causes that will for ever render the Presbyterian go∣vernment an odious and an intollerable thing.

It is absolutely impossible that any sort of society, be it civil, be it sacred, or of what kind soever, should subsist, without some laws to govern it self by, or without censures and punishments in case of disobedience; and be∣cause the unity of the church depends very much upon that of the Clergy, who are its officers, among themselves, therefore it is very natural for a man to ask this question,
—Quis custodiet ipsos
Custodes—
Who are they to whom the inspection or supravision of the Clergy themselves does most properly and rightfully belong, or who are they to whom it is best and safest that the government and superintendencie of the Clergy should be committed in order to this end, namely, that the peace and unity of the church may be preserved? And I an∣swer, that it is best it should be intrusted in the hands of such overseers as shall be cho∣sen for that purpose out of their own num∣ber, and that for two reasons.
First, that all mankind do most easily, most willingly and readily obey those of
 their own order and profession, the reason is because all men have a passionate love for themselves, which though they will not own at every turn, yet we may discern it plain∣ly by a fondness which they are subject to express for the most faint resemblances of themselves in others; a tradesman or artifi∣cer, setting other considerations, which are nearer him, aside, hath a greater kindness for one of his own trade or company, for a brother, as he calls him, of his craft and profession than another; a mariner would chuse to be commanded by a captain like himself that hath been bred in a seafaring life, and a souldier had rather serve under an old beaten officer, that perhaps was once a com∣mon souldier, like himself, than under some novice or unexperienced youth who hath nothing but a great birth and fortune to re∣commend him, nay he would take the seve∣rest discipline in good part from such an one, when yet if the other should inflict the same severity for the same offence it might cause an embroilment and disorder in the army; if they mutiny for want of pay, the promise of such an one that he will look after it, shall signifie more with them than if ano∣ther
 had paid them down half their arrears, they will follow him chearfully into the greatest dangers, and though it be at him∣self that they have taken perhaps a very ex∣cusable and justifiable displeasure, yet his bare presence and appearance among them shall have a wonderfull eloquence to perswade them to be quiet, it is like old friends and lovers that are fallen out, they are glad on both sides to accept of any offers of reconciliati∣on, because there is kindness at the bottom, and they have a complacency in one ano∣ther.
Upon the same account it is, that men that are far from home are used to be migh∣tily pleased when they meet with a country∣man of theirs, and much more with one of the same town or neighbourhood with them∣selves, although it may be when they were at home, they had no knowledge of him; and let them be where they will, yet if a man in his childhood have been but playfellow or schoolfellow, if it so happen that he was born in the same parish or neighbourhood with another, who is famous for any art or skill, or is arrived to any great honour or preferment, the man whenever he talks of
 it is almost as proud and as well pleased as if himself had been the very person that is so wise, so skilfull or so great, and if he him∣self had been to prefer one into the same dig∣nity or high emploiment, supposing that he had no greater interest to conduct his choice, he would infallibly prefer his countryman or his townsman before any other competi∣tour whatsoever, merely because he is so, and because of a certain imaginary resem∣blance and likeness with himself.
Thus men that are of kin to greatness do reap a pleasure and satisfaction from it, though they have neither honour nor estate themselves; and they who in a mean fortune are yet descended of an ancient and illustri∣ous stock, do take a pride in thinking fui∣mus Troes, and for the likeness which they fancy betwixt themselves and their progeni∣tours they attribute all their honours, their actions, their endowments, their vertues, their successes in some sort to themselves.
To conclude, a Monk hath usually a pas∣sion for his own order, a scholar hath the greatest kindness for those that are skilfull in his particular attainments, for his own Col∣lege, his own University, and every man
 hath a comparative fondness for every thing and person, wherein either nature hath made or education painted the least imaginary re∣semblance of himself.
To which it is to be added, that those honours and preferments which the gover∣nours of the body ecclesiastick, being them∣selves members of the same body, enjoy, as they are very natural and very certain ex∣pedients of procuring reverence and esteem to their persons, and by consequence of ma∣king them fitter for the end of government, which is obedience; so they are so far from being grudged or repined at, by the inferi∣our Clergy, that they do naturally rejoice in them, and as they do in some sense enjoy those honours and those preferments for the reason of self-love and self-likeness which hath been lately mentioned, so the conside∣ration of them inspires them with gallant thoughts and vertuous designs to make themselves capable of the same rewards and dignities in time to come: for it is certain that all great attainements in any kind what∣soever are owing to an honest and a gene∣rous ambition, and Mr. Hobs saith some∣where excellently well, nisi qui laudem amant,
 pauci faciunt laudabilia, so we may say with e∣qual truth, nisi qui ambiunt honores, pauci fa∣ciunt quae sunt honoribus digna. The Scrip∣ture it self bids us look to the recompence of reward, and press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling, and it is certain that no man will or can doe any thing with a steady purpose of mind, wherein he does not pro∣pose some interest to himself. The prospect of such advantages in future, makes a man obedient, as well as industrious for the pre∣sent, and by setting an example of submis∣sion to his superiours, and of diligence in his station and emploiment, he is in both respects an instrument of great honour and great service to the Church; he is in the rea∣dy way to make a wise and excellent person, and will be the more readily obeyed when he comes to govern, for having shewed an ex∣ample of obedience before.
But if there were not such honours and advantages to be met with in the Clergy, then there would certainly these two notori∣rious inconveniences follow, first that the governours of the church would lose very much of their authority and power, which they cannot do without prejudice to the
 government it self, and secondly, that the want of due encouragement would produce in the inferiour Clergy, a scorbutick idle∣ness and inactivity, a want of due concern either for the peace of the Church or for the honour of it; it would subject them to the humours of the people, from whose kindness they might in this case expect as great or greater secular advantages than they could propose to themselves in any other course, so that instead of being the instruments of obedience, they would by this means be∣come the speaking trumpets of faction; and so it was seen in the late disorderly times, when the Episcopacy was demolisht, and the dignitary lands were all of them confiscate, men preach'd up rebellion for lecture con∣tributions, and I doubt not but many of them acted much against their consciences for no other reason but to please the rabble.
It is an old saying , it is not to be denied but there are some in∣stances of very gallant men to be found in the reformed churches abroad, and that too where they have not the benefit of episcopal government, but I dare appeal to the dissen∣ters themselves, if they will speak their con∣sciences,
 whether ever there was so plentifull an harvest of wise and excellently learned men as are to be found at this day among the Clergy of the church of England, and whether among themselves there be any such thing as learning to be met with, whe∣ther both city and country are not now bet∣ter furnished than in the late times, with ex∣cellent preachers, and men that can speak sense, which is more than they can doe, or whether the Universities are not better stored with men of great attainments on the one hand, and great hopes on the other, than in the days when humane learning and that abominable idol carnal reason were for the most part banish'd with the King and the Bishops; the reason of which cannot possi∣bly be referred to any other cause, but one∣ly the more ingenuous Principles that are now abroad, and the greater encourage∣ments men have now before them to stu∣dy and take pains, and deserve well of the world.
This is certain, that the wisedom of Prin∣ces hath always been so sensible of the use∣fulness of ecclesiasticks to the service of the publick, for the security, honour and safety
 of their governments, for the composing and calming the minds of their people into a peaceable and obedient temper, that they have thought no honours and advantages too great to bestow upon them as a reward of their merit, and to make their authority still greater in the eyes of the people; and it was very wisely provided by our ancestours in such a government as this is, where the people have so great a share in the making of those laws by which they are afterwards to be obliged, that the Bishops should have a place allotted them in Parliament, as well as the nobility or the commons have, and that for their greater honour, and to give them a right of suffrage in the house of Lords, they should have Baronies annext to their respective sees.
For where the people have so great an interest in the enacting of their own laws, there, if the Clergy be totally excluded, if there be none admitted into the assembly to look after the interest of the ecclesiastical state, it will most certainly and unavoidably come to pass, that by the envy or the ill de∣signs of men the Clergy will be deprest and trampled on at some time or other, which
 it can never be without detriment to the state, upon supposition that they are at all advantagious or serviceable to it.
Nay, if it be granted that they are of any use, it must be granted likewise that they are the most usefull persons that do or can belong to a society, and therefore ought to be the most highly honoured and esteemed; for what greater blessing can there be than peace? or what greater plague or calamity can befall a nation than to be embroiled in sedition, enflamed with strife, raging with opposite and eager passions? what better in∣struments can there be in any state or king∣dom, than they whose business and whose study it is to exhort to peace, and charity, and obedience, to submission to the govern∣ment and love to one another?
Certainly if the Lawyers get so much, and are so highly caressed and rewarded sometimes for ending controversies, and sometimes for ma∣king them endless, sometimes for setting men together by the ears, and at others for par∣ting the fray to the disadvantage of the true pretender; the Divines are much more worthy to be honoured and rewarded, whose business it is to prevent all strife and conten∣tion,
 and who have perhaps determined as many controversies in a cheap and amicable way at home, as ever the other decided at the bar, to the ruine sometimes of both the parties concerned, and always to the signal detriment and disadvantage of one.
I do not speak this to disparage or under∣value the learned Gentlemen of the long robe, whose profession I acknowledge in e∣very state to be not onely usefull, but neces∣sary to its peace and welfare, so far as it is not abused by ill men, or by tedious delays, and by traversing of courts and actions, to the infinite vexation and oppression of the subject. But, I say, the prevention of all strife is a much more noble, excellent and usefull thing, than the deciding of contro∣versies after they are actually begun, as it is better to prevent an ague by a wholesome diet, or by a regular course of life or by preventive medicaments before hand, than to remove the fit, or by degrees perhaps the disease it self, by many repeated doses of the Jesuites powder, which when it hath had its utmost operation, there will still be some dregs of the disease, and some of the very medicine it self that was intended to cure it,
 that will remain behind; and so it is in law, though the suit be ended, yet the conten∣ding parties are not reconciled, and the ve∣ry going to law, which is the remedy of strife, does oftentimes beget a quarelsome and con∣tentious temper, and make men more trou∣blesome to their neighbours for the future, whether they get the better of the cause or no; as losing gamesters play on out of hope to repair their losses, and they that win so long as there is money stirring upon the board, or an estate to answer the credit which they give, are every whit as eager as the other, out of hope that fortune will continue to be kind.
And as the Priesthood for their usefulness excell the courts of justice, inasmuch as it is a much more noble and more worthy em∣ploiment to create in men an obedient and charitable temper, by the one of which they shall converse with the greater kindness and benevolence among one another, and shall be ready at all times to hearken to truth and reason, and to submit their cause to the um∣pirage of common interest and universal justice, without respect to private ends or persons, and by the other they are rendred
 more tame and tractable, and more easie to be governed, and in both respects contri∣bute so much to the peace, and happiness, and safety of each other; I say, as this is an emploiment undoubtedly more excellent than that which is chiefly conversant about the cure of diseases and the decision of quar∣rels, after the mutual hostilities are begun, and hath a much greater recourse to force than to persuasion, so it is likewise in the order of nature before it, and in both re∣spects it is, that the Priesthood in all nations are not onely worthy of double honour, but it is absolutely necessary to the ends of go∣vernment that they should have it.
But yet I do not deny, nay, I have already expresly granted and affirmed it, that it is a part of our business and duty to reconcile differences as well as to prevent them, as it is on the other hand a part of the counsel∣lours emploiment to prevent quarrels by deeds of settlement and by antecedent agree∣ments and stipulations consented to by both parties in due form of law, as well as to end them by bringing them to an issue and a verdict at the bar; but still these two things remain unquestionably true.

First, that the greatest part of the Divine's business is preventive, and the greatest task of Council learned in the law, is conversant not so much in the prevention of controver∣sies as in their final issue and determination.
Secondly, That as we prevent quarrels, so we reconcile them too after another manner than the Lawyers do, we persuade to peace among our selves and to obedience to the governours that are set over us, by endea∣vouring to infuse such peaceable and chari∣table dispositions into men, as shall not one∣ly prevent or reconcile one quarrel, or be a means of producing this or that act of obe∣dience, but shall be a lasting principle of ac∣tion that shall run through our lives, and in every particular instance that can be given, shall naturally dispose us to act so, as is most friendly to one another, most dutifull with respect to our superiours, and in both cases most for our own inward peace and rest, for the quiet of the world and the happiness of mankind.
The Divine reconciles one quarrel so as by that principle upon which the reconciliation proceeds to prevent another: The Lawyer prevents a quarrel so as to make men unea∣sie
 under the restraint, and reconciles a dif∣ference after such a manner as to leave the embers of a lasting animosity, and the seeds of a contentious, discontented spirit raked up and glowing under the ashes of the cause.
The Divine saith, doe this and you shall be happy, doe it, or we cannot help your being miserable, for there are natural trou∣bles and inconveniences annext to all un∣reasonable and unjust actions; there is an almighty arm which you cannot resist that is over you, and there is a vengeance ex∣pects you in the world to come which it is in vain for you to think of escaping upon any other condition than that of repentance and amendment.
The Law saith, doe this or you shall be severely punished; the law promises nothing, neither indeed can it, for the rewards of vertue are natural and owing to the actions themselves, therefore if the action will re∣ward it self it may, but the law gives no∣thing but impunity to obedience, and to disobedience proposes terrour.
And after all, its sanctions, which are founded in fear, are not onely less persua∣sive,
 because there is no argument to per∣suade to obedience to a positive law but fear; because there is nothing to be got by sub∣mission but impunity, or if any good con∣sequence follow from it, it is no thanks to the law but to the nature of the action; whereas the Divine who proceeds upon the nature and tendency of actions, does not onely work upon the fears of men, but likewise upon their hopes and their desires, but he hath also this advantage that the terrours which the law displays, are one∣ly such as belong to ouvert actions after due proof and process hath been made, so that in many cases there may be an hope of esca∣ping, nay, a moral impossibility that a man should be discovered, and so the inclination to evil remains, being cherished by an hope of impunity and concealment, and although the outward act be in many particular in∣stances restrained, yet the inward principle of the mind is not altered all this while, which cannot be done by any menace of the law, but by shewing men, whether they are dis∣covered or not, that vertue and obedience are always for their interest whenever they will consider all things impartially together.

And as the terrours of the law may be esca∣ped, which cannot be said of those of nature and religion, which are unalterable and una∣voidable, so also, as being but humane ter∣rours, they may in many cases be resisted and overcome by men, and sometimes they are laid asleep by the connivence and partiality of men to one another; but in the rewards and punishments whether of natural or divine laws, the case is clean otherwise, for so far as they proceed from the natural issues and tendencies of actions, they have as necessary a dependence upon their emanative cause, as the light hath upon the sun, or the stream upon the fountain, or heat and warmth up∣on a quantity of combustible matter already kindled and in an actual flame, so that the cau∣ses or actions themselves being supposed, there is no way to avoid the natural effects that are consequent upon them; the rewards are certain, the punishments inevitable: ver∣tue cannot be separated from the advanta∣ges that are linked to it by a necessity of na∣ture, nor wickedness be practised without the natural inconveniences that do by plain and physical causalities attend all its motions and follow it by a line of punishment, and
 a winding clue of guilt, which runs all a∣long parallel to that of sin, into all its most secret laby rinths and retirements.
Again as those rewards and punishments that are future and eternal are therefore the most inviting on the one hand and the most dreadfull on the other, because of their e∣ternity and everlasting duration, so is the delightfull prospect and assurance of the one rendred so much the more certain, and by consequence more amiable and lovely to us, by a reflexion upon the veracity and good∣ness of that being, who to the natural argu∣ments upon which the belief of a blessed im∣mortality depends, hath added the more cer∣tain and express ratification of his written word, and the terrour of the other is ren∣dred still more formidable and more awfull to us, by reflecting upon that justice which cannot be bribed, that power which cannot be resisted, and that knowledge to which all things are naked and exposed, compared with the provocation which our sins have given him to stretch forth his mighty arm and inflict all his vengeance upon us.
But yet I know not how it comes to pass, there is a charm in the denunciation of judg∣ments,
 as well as in the promises of happiness and reward, and those calamities, which, being conditional and avoidable, cannot be avoided or resisted upon the breach of that conditi∣on upon which their avoidance or averrunca∣tion depends, have a certain eloquence to persuade and please, as well as a dismal ap∣prehension to startle and discompose us; and these two states of happiness and misery be∣ing set in opposition to, or interwoven skil∣fully with one another, are like the well tempered lights and shades of an exquisite master in the art of painting, and afford a mutual advantage to each other, they are like the discords in musick happily met to∣gether to compose a melody of charming sounds, like the jarring elements by the di∣vine power and wisedom reduced into the ca∣tholick unity of the world, and upon the whole matter, there is as much difference betwixt the dry terrour of an humane law, and the insinuating charms, the soft and melting per∣suation of the natural and divine, as there is betwixt the violence of saws and chisels, the screaking of a cart or carriage-wheel upon its loaded axis, with the unnatural force of pulleys and of cranes to compell the stones
 and timber into a fitness and harmony with each other for the erecting of some stately building, and the prevailing harp of Orpheus or Amphion, by which they are persuaded to come of their own accord and place them∣selves in a beautifull and proportionable or∣der; betwixt the notes of Arion and the noise of thunder, by one of which the Dolphins are affrighted, and to the other they dance.
Not that I would be thought to insinuate in the least, as if the restraints of humane laws were not of absolute necessity in every commonwealth, nay they are indeed so ne∣cessary that there can be no society without them, for what is an humane society, but a society governed by humane laws? and it is but too notorious by every days wofull experience, that all the restraints that can be laid upon men, whether they be natural, divine or humane, are little enough, nay they are too little, to conquer our frailties to subdue our appetites, and to withstand our temptations; but yet it is still manifest that those arguments are more strong, and consequently those persons more usefull in every Kingdom or state, whose business it is, to create an inward principle of duty
 and obedience, than those which onely re∣spect the outward act but have no influence upon the mind and will, one of which is the case of natural and divine laws and the other of the humane, which by not being able to punish any thing but the outward act, do in a manner give a licence, if there were no∣thing else to be considered, to all the secret and conceal'd iniquity that can possibly be committed.
To which it is to be added, that the hopes of pardon, the prevalence of inte∣rest, the importunity of friends, and, which is more, of money, the consideration of our common frailty, and the mutual pity and connivence of men that have offended or may offend towards one another, are things that do extremely rebate the edge of humane punishments, and by consequence, by allay∣ing and qualifying those fears which are the onely motives to obedience to any humane law, they are a proportionable temptation, or at least they give strength and power to those temptations which prompt us to of∣fend and disobey; and lastly, when an un∣lawfull fact is never so evidently proved up∣on us, yet there are three things that in ma∣ny
 cases do either mitigate the punishment or utterly remove it. First, That though a fact be never so wilfully committed, yet either by the favour of chance, or by the design and contrivance of the offender or by the art and eloquence of a subtile advocate it is capable of extenuating and alleviating cir∣cumstances in the appearance of the world. Secondly, That though a law be never so carefully drawn up by wise and skilfull men, yet there may oftentimes evasions be found out to elude its force, and frustrate its de∣sign. And, Thirdly, That in commiseration of a man's family and of the innocence of those that are to suffer together with him, there shall be mercy shewn for the sake of others though not for that of the offender himself.
But now the laws of nature are plain, im∣partial, inflexible, inexorable, their sanction is founded in such goods or evils as flow im∣mediately from the nature and tendency of such actions or such habits considered in themselves, and by consequence they are such as cannot be avoided, but the punishment will for ever bear a proportion to the guilt, and the rewards of innocence and vertue will always be proportionable to the things them∣selves,
 and then as for the divine laws, the terrour of the Lord, by which we endeavour to persuade men, can no otherwise be avoided but upon the condition of an hearty and sin∣cere repentance joyned to an effectual and thorough reformation, or at least a steady purpose of it, if God should be pleased to grant us a longer life; and this last, generally speaking, will not doe neither, because a death-bed repentance at the close of a wicked life, lays no manner of congruity upon the divine goodness, neither does it come with∣in the termes of the covenant, which Christ hath purchased for us with his bloud; and if a general pardon should be allowed to be granted to all that do heartily repent when they come to die, this would be a thing of very bad example, and every man so long as he found any appetite within him, or a∣ny temptation to be complied with from without, would naturally defer his repen∣tance till that time, and therefore it is high∣ly just and reasonable to suppose that God generally proceeds with men by other mea∣sures; and, to be sure, to sin on upon that supposition, that God will pardon us at the last cast, is in it self so bold a sin, so intole∣rable
 a presumption, so great a provocation, that setting aside those sins which are conse∣quent upon it, this alone would be enough to sink us into the bottomless pit, from whence there is no possible redemption to be expected.
It being therefore so clear of what impor∣tance and usefulness the Clergy or Priest∣hood in all nations is, to the creating in men a peaceable disposition, a vertuous and obe∣dient temper of mind, for the happiness of all and of every particular person, it must be granted likewise that it is moreover ne∣cessary that all humane care and provision should be made that they may not fall out or squabble among themselves, either about matters of discipline or doctrine, because this will lessen their authority, and conse∣quently their use and service among the peo∣ple; the question therefore is, to whom it is best that the exercise of this discipline should be committed, whether to a Lay Judge, or an Ecclesiastical, and I answer, as I have an∣swered already, that it is best this jurisdicti∣on be intrusted with the latter of these, be∣cause men do more easily obey their supe∣riours in their own order, besides that the
 jurisdiction being placed in Lay hands the Clergy have no prospect, but of perpetual subjection, without ever hoping to be go∣vernours themselves, and this damps their spirits and diminishes their authority, and chokes that honest and laudable ambition, which is at once a cause of wisdom and vertue in themselves, and of obedience to those that are in authority over them.
But then secondly, a second reason why it is undoubtedly best for the Clergy to be go∣verned by Superiours of their own Order, is that as the persons to be governed do more easily obey them, so those that are to go∣vern when they are of the same order, and have lived formerly in the same condition and circumstances of life with those that are to obey, have the greater sense of what is rea∣sonable and just to be expected from them; they will not in probability behave themselves like rigid taskmasters, but equitable supervi∣sours, and are the more likely in all their constitutions and in all their censures to put themselves into the place of their dependents, and to consider that as being their own case again, which hath been so once already; they have something in them which is very like
 that which the Greeks call  or natural af∣fection to the persons of those over whom they are placed, and for the honour and cre∣dit of the profession, and the others in requi∣tal do , they express their resent∣ment of this Paternal tenderness and love by such an obedience, reverence and profound respect as becomes those who have the relati∣on of Sons, in that which the Canon Law calls, though in another sense, the Spiritual cognation; and certainly so much care on both sides, on the one not to enjoyn any thing but what is reasonable and fit to be done, what is for the interest of the obeisant parties and of that of the profession, and on the other not to disobey any thing that is so, must needs make very much for the Honour and Reputation of the Clergy, and if such an Order of men be of any use, for the service of the world.
To which two considerations there is like∣wise a third to be added, which though in it self very obvious I did not think of before, and that is that Clergy men, that is, men that both by their Education and Profession have devoted themselves to the service of the Church, are certainly the best and the most
 proper Judges of Ecclesiastical whether things or persons, and by the same reason that all the civil Guilds or Fraternities in a Corpora∣tion have Masters and Assistants out of their own number, to whom the chief conduct and administration of the affairs of such a Society does belong; by the same reason that in a Parliament, a Committee for Trade shall call in Tradesmen and Artificers to their assistance to take their opinions in the matters under de∣bate, of which they are naturally supposed to be the most competent Judges; by the same reason, that a Lawyer invested with the power and Character of a Judge sits to hear and de∣termine controversies upon the Bench, not a Musician, an Astronomer, a Grammarian, a Chymist, an Architect, a Divine, or at least not because of any of these endowments or qualifications with which he may be over and above adorned, but because of his skill and ability in the profession of the Law; by the same reason certainly and upon the same Maxim, because credendum est artifici in sua arte, a Clergy man must needs be the most proper Judge in matters that are of Ecclesi∣astical cognizance and concern, if we will but grant this easie supposition that Divinity
 is more than an empty name, and that it does require a proportion of pains and study as well as other professions do.
There are three Powers or Offices in every Ecclesiastical Society the full exercise and ad∣ministration of which does without all questi∣on naturally and rightfully devolve upon the Clergy, and not upon all the Clergy neither, but onely upon the Governours or Bishops of it.
The first is the power of Ordination.
The second of Visitation or inspection, from whence they have the name of Bishops or Overseers.
And the third of Excommunication.
For the first, it would be impossible to pre∣vent innumerable Heresies and Schisms in the Church, if every Presbyter had the full power of Ordination in his hands, but it ought to satisfie the Presbyter in this case that he is not totally excluded, but that he is cal∣led in as an assistant to the Bishop, and that the Ordination is performed according to the genuine practice of antiquity by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, as well as
 by that of the Ordaining Bishop himself. For the third, if every passionate Clergy man out of private ends or out of a rash and un∣governable temper might Excommunicate and devote upon every light occasion, it would at once bring the Ecclesiastical cen∣sures to contempt, and be a means of infinite mischiefs and confusions in the Church. And for the second it depends upon the first, for as they say in Law, ejusdem est condere & in∣terpretari, so by the same reason, the power of Visitation or inspection must be seated in the same hands in which the Ordination is placed, the design and intent of it being onely this, to examine whether every respec∣tive Curate or Incumbent do answer the end and meaning of his Ordination.
And for the more authoritative and effec∣tual administration of so great a charge, it is requisite that the Port and Dignity of the Bishop above the inferiour Clergy may hold a proportion to his rank and station; and it is in vain in this case to urge the poverty of the first Apostles and Preachers of Christianity, who supplied by Miracles and supernatural inflictions, what they wanted of the natural causes of Authority and greatness among
 men, not that I would be thought to plead for such an excessive Pomp, as hath more of pride and vanity than real use, but as it is ne∣necessary to the ends of every well regulated Clergy, that their condition in the general should be according to the admirable Mr. Cowley's wish,
Too low for Envy, for Contempt too high.
So to answer the meaning of his institution, it is necessary there should be a proportion of grandeur in the Bishop, suitable to the weight and dignity of his charge, and to the eminence of his place and order in the Church.
I shall conclude this matter, with observing that Princes in all ages, who certainly may be thought to understand Government as well as ever a busie Lay-elder of them all, have al∣ways thought it safest for the quiet of their Dominions to govern by Bishops, and I ap∣peal to any one of common understanding, supposing the Roman Empire to be still as great and flourishing as it was of old, whether the unity of so great a Body, would be more likely to be preserved, by the government of Presbyteries pecking at one another and every moment in danger of crumbling into pieces, or by the Episcopal subordination, which
 makes the Church of God like a fair, firm and well compacted building whose parts do all give beauty and strength to one another; and I do farther put the case, if we suppose all Christendom at this day to be governed by Presbyteries after the new-fangled Republican Model, and having so potent a Monarch as the Turkish Sultan for their neighbour, whe∣ther its strength, however broken and disuni∣ted, would be so firm and so well united as it is at this day to make head against him, or so likely to hold out against the terrours or temp∣tations of the Asiatick steel or gold. These things are easie to be considered and compu∣ted by any man of sense and experience in the world, and are, if I am not very much mistaken, a plain and unanswerable demonstration on the Episcopal side, for certainly that Govern∣ment which is the best calculated for the peace of the World, is also the most agreeable to the Gospel of Christ, that Government which is the most likely and proper to defend Chri∣stendom, does best answer the ends of Christi∣anity.
Not but that in the Episcopacy as in all Go∣vernments there may be inconveniences too, because men are men and always will be men
 as long as the world endures, but it is suffi∣cient if it labour under fewer disadvantages than the Presbytery does, or if it be the best Government that can be thought of to pre∣vent the passions and designs of men from putting the world in a perpetual flame.
There have been feuds and animosities in an∣cient time among the Bishops, but that is not the question, but onely whether they would not have been greater and more frequent in proportion to their number in a National or Provincial Synod of the Presbyters, as there are disturbances sometimes in a Parliament house, but does it follow therefore that to pre∣vent those inconveniences the whole King∣dom should meet together in a general Assem∣bly to make Laws, or would not the dangers and inconveniences be incomparably greater on this side than on the other? Or may I not now fairly sum up the evidence in the words of that great Presbyterian St. Jerome, in his Di∣alogue ad Luciferianos, Ecclesiae salus in summi Sacerdotis dignitate pendet, cui si non exors & ab omnibus eminens detur potestas, tot in Ecclesiis efficientur schismata, quot Sacerdotes.
It remains still that, as I promised, I should give some account why I have appeared so
 zealous for the execution of the Laws against Dissenters, but the reasonableness of that is now sufficiently seen by the happy success it hath had upon the affairs of a distracted King∣dom, so that my answer is already made to my hands, and I have nothing to add, but my Prayers to God that the same Justice and Vigour may continue, and my most humble Petition to your Lordship, that you would pardon the presumption of this long address, for the sake of its honest and well-meant inten∣tion from, My Lord,
