IT hath euer (Right-Honorable) bene an obseruatiō amongst schol∣lers, when they intended to com∣mit their exercises to the iudge∣ment of others, to shroude them selues vnder the patronage of some honorable personage; but I more honoring the noble minded, thē a∣ble to expresse my good will, fol∣low his opinion, that if he wrot of the dignity of a Crowne, dedicated his labours to a King: if of the estate, to a graue Counsellor: if of religion, to a Iudiciall Diuine: if of tillage, to the experienced Husbandman: but if of the Seas, to the learned Admirall. So I, writing of high matters, concerning the good fortune of the Seas, shrowde my selfe vnder the sailes of the L. High Admirall, whose heroical mind I know to be such, that your repute it fellonie to robbe a Souldier of his honour, and iniurie to hide what deserued honour is wonne by a Subiect to his Soueraigne: for vertue ioyned with noblenes, is a mixture of true humanitie. And because (as Dion saith) the world is a huge caue of mingled conceits,

and the multitude, as a many hedded beast, rumoring they knowe not what, and murmuring they know not whereat, some forward & wishing wel, others froward & discoraging the well minded: which made me the bolder to publish for the comfort of my countrimen, the honorable seruice of that fortunate English souldier Sir Frauncis Drake, according to such coppies as I haue compassed of the same, which I haue conferd with diuers that were eye witnesses in that expedi∣tion: in which I carry this consideration, that such as proue apostatates from the field, backsliding from their seruice, might be preferd to be field bishops, and such as haue not yet seene the honor and daunger, may be spurred forward to reape in this haruest of renowne: For when Darius king of Percia clapt Nabarzanes on the back saying, now Nabarza∣nes for thy country, he made way as a fier through the throng of the Macedonians, that before studied what hee were best to do and the applause of the people to the successe of that Conquering Affrican, put a double edge to his sword, and added a triple courage to his minde to dye immortall, for honor is like spice which as the more it is punned in the motter, the sweeter it smels; so honor, the more it is tossed in the mindes and mouthes of men truely, the higher it climes: In this respect am I animated to this enterprise, and this I humbly beseech your honor to countenance, that as some do▪ so all true English heartes maye reioyce, and praye for his prosperous successe, which the Almightie God direct and defend in all their proceedings.
