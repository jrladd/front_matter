THere was a world (but now that world is not,)
When Vertue was within mens hearts inroulde:
But now that world is almost cleane forgot,
For vildest things doe mens affections holde.


There was a time (but now, more griefe, tis not)
When men (though mortall) seemed halfe deuine:
There was a golden age, that age forgot,
When men (in charity) not wealth did shine.


There was a time when men relieu'd the poore,
But he's now counted wise that keepes his owne:
There was a time, when men did heauen implore,
But now who thinkes of heau'n is scarcely knowne.



There was a tim when most men liu'd in God,
And mens perfections all on high were placed:
But now in Mammon most men haue aboad,
Earth is prefer'd fore heau'n, and Saints disgraced.


But in that soule who heauen doth onely minde,
Deuinest wisdome will for euer dwell:
Jf such a soule in thee she cannot finde,
Where such a soule to finde J cannot tell.


For nothing can thy soule from comfort seuer,
In him that bought thee deare, and lou'd thee euer.
