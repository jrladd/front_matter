SYR: I cannot but often thinke of your singular good respect towards me, in whom, as now it appeareth, long acquaintance in true loue hath bred a con∣stant readinesse to doe me good, not only when I am present with you (as if you were, as many be, a friend to the face, without sound affection fixed in the heart) but also in my absence, and that a far off, when I supposed (which was mine errour) my selfe least in your thoughts, and therefore farre enough from expecting so great kindenesses as I haue now receiued at your hands.
Surely, SYR, as I acknowledge that you haue suf∣ficiently witnessed on your part, beyond my expecta∣tion, a minde fully bent to procure my well-fare, so I pray you out of this your true loue, to iudge me ready on my part to requite, if I were able to recompence so great kindenesses, vnto the full: but I am indebted beyond mine hability to pay; your satisfaction there∣fore from mee is onely my good will, and your owne friendly acceptance of a thankefull heart; a true
 token and sure testimony whereof be this my late and last labour, which I bequeath vnto you, till there be more fit meanes of recompencing your farre better deseruings. In the meane space let it stand for a wit∣nesse of my thankefulnesse, which I haue euer desired to shew vnto all, for euery little fauour receiued of any friendly well-willer.
This my labour, in part concerneth the Laity, where∣in you may, in your place, occasionally, be a very good instrument all meanes to further my intendment, for the maintenance of the Ministerie. In part also it touch∣eth many of vs of the Clergie, in our too much neg∣lected duty of Catechising; the Antiquity, vtility, and right forme whereof is here set downe; the godly con∣sideration of which I humbly recommend to my Reue∣rend brethren of the Ministery in these parts; to whose wise and indicious censure I submit this my best endeuour in this point, crauing for it their friendly interpretation, and for my selfe their fauourable coun∣tenance, which I much desire, and which, if I may ob∣taine, I will account, as an addition of Gods blessing to my Lords most honourable fauours; and as you, one well knowne and approued, shall be the instrument to effect it, so will I value it, as a part of high price in your vnfeigned loue towards me.
Thus thankfully remembring my selfe, I commend my labour and my selfe to your friendly and kinde ac∣ceptance, remayning
 From Worsop in Not∣tinghamshire. Sept. 24.
