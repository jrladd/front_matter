Fellow souldiers and friends:
TO the two for∣mer Treatises of Gods pro∣mises of good things to us, and of our Vowes of obe∣dience to him, which by his alone help I have pub∣lished; I adde these few fragments following, and
because I will be as little tedious as I can, I shall on∣ly commend them to your carefull consideration, ob∣servation and practice, as you may find them agree∣able to sound doctrine and good manners, and usefull to your occasions, and them and you to the especiall blessing of our God in the Lord Jesus.
