RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
YOur wits, endowments, toge∣ther with other naturall parts sutable unto them I have al∣wayes admired: but especially since your comming to the Vniversitie being then most conspicuous. To testifie my dutifull respect to you, and your vertuous Lady, having interpreted the two short Epistles of St. Iohn, and that of Saint Paul to Philemon: I thought good to dedicate them to you and her, for you resemble the man, and she the woman, to whom Saint Iohn writeth: And that to Philemon being , as the word importeth, doth most fitly a∣gree to you. Zeno asked of the Oracle, how he

might live best, Answer was made him, : if he were of the same color with the dead: Vpon that he fell a reading of the Anci∣ents: And in the interpretation of these Epistles, I have followed (as you shall see) the judge∣ment of the Ancients. Thus I humbly take my leave, commending your honour to the Almighty.
From East Bergholt in Suffolke.
