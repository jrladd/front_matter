RIght worthie worthlesse Patron, the daies and times being such, wherein wit goes a wool-gathering in a thredbare Iacket, and folly is well reputed amongst those that seeme wise, I, conside∣ring this, hauing but little wit, in a mad humour bad farewell it, and neuer so much as asked the

question, with whether wilt thou? Being certain∣ly perswaded that playing the foole will repaire the breaches which my vnhappy wit hath made in the Bulwarke of my reputation (as it hath done to many others) wherefore good sir (with) reuerence I hearing that so great a member in your esteemed quality, as Mr. Thomas Coriat of Odcomb, was drowned in his passage towards Constantinople; And knowing that many good & worthy writers haue graced his living trauels: So I haue made bold (vnder your great Patronage) to write his tragicall supposed Death-song, or Funerall Elegie; not knowing any man of that worthy worth (be∣sides your selfe) to whom I might dedicate these sad Epicediums. Thus, not doubting of your ac∣ceptance and protection, I commit my selfe and my labours to your wonderfull wisedomes cen∣sure, alwayes hauing a poore Muse to trauell in your seruice.
Iohn Taylor.
