Right Reuerend,
THIS Sermon was made for the Crosse, not intended for the Presse. I was by authoritie commanded the for∣mer, and by importunitie of many haue at length consented to the latter. It may perchance
 heereafter complaine with the Satyrist.Har. lib. 2. Epist. 1.
Deferat in vitem vendentem thus, at odores,
Et piper, et quicquid chartis amicitur ineptis.
But that is no great disgrace in these daies, it shal haue Store of company, perhaps some to whom it may deseruedly giue the wall. As for fault finding carpers, I little account of their censure, it is well knowne whose liuery they weare, it were a strange peece of worke that should haue their approbation. Some haue charged nature af a grosse ouersight for placing the oxe his hornes vpon his head, and not vpon his shoulders which are the stronger, an inge∣nuous reader will winke at a
 fault, and approoue that which is good. But let these passe, my humble desire is, that this mite which I haue cast into the trea∣sury (for my riches extend not to a talent) may find acceptance with your good Lordship, who may iustly claime the same inte∣rest in me which Paul did in Philemon.Ʋers. 19. Seneca. lib. 1. de benefic. Cap. 8. Thou owest vnto mee euen thine owne selfe. I willingly acknowledge it: and say as Aeschines in Se∣neca said to Socrates: Seeing I haue nothing to offer wor∣thy so reuerend a Person. (for to dedicate a Sermon to your Lordshippe is but with Chaerilus to present a few
 harsh verses to Alexander) I offer my selfe; promising still to continue.
Lon∣don the 27. of Iune.
