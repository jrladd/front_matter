MOST HONORABLE LORD,
to auoid idlenes, I haue with
Domitian endeuoured to catch
Flies, I haue taken in hand a
text, that will rather induce
hatred, then winne loue, I
haue spoken against those ab∣hominations,
that are not lesse odible in the sight
of the powers of heauen, then monstrous to bee
tollerated heere vpon the face of the earth: I haue
grasped at greater matters, then (some will say) is
fitting to behandled by a Souldiers penne.
The Adulterer will not indure it, the Drunkard wil
be angry with it, the Blasphemer will sweare at it, the
Bribe-taker will despite it, the Papist will malice it, to
conclude most Honorable) there is no guiltie con∣science
that will willingly entertaine it.
Remayning then in some doubtfulnes of mind,
to whom I might bequeath it, that would eyther
grace or giue countenance vnto it, I was promp∣ted
by Report of your Lordships worthinesse that
now in the course of your gouernement in this
Honorable Cittie of London, you haue set vp those

lights for the suppressing of seuerall sorts of sinnes,
that as they haue already aduanced your applause,
amongst those that bee of the best approoued ho∣nesty,
so they will remaine for euer in Record to
your perpetuall prayse.
Let not therefore my boldnes, seeme presump∣tuous,
that being altogether vnknowne to your
Lordship, haue yet presumed to shelter my
lines vnder your Honorable name,
and thus in affiance of your Ho∣norable
acceptance, I rest to
doe your Lordshippe
any other kinde
of seruice.
