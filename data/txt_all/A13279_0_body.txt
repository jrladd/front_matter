SIR, the kind welcome that you alwaies daigne
To the faire Muses, and their fauorites;
And chiefly me, the meanest of their traine,
(Too meane to meddle with their sacred rites)▪


My willing heart with thankefull hand inuites,
To offer you my busie-idle paine,
Il-shapen shaddowes of my yong delights,
Till better fruits my better Fates ordaine.


Yet (pray you) priuate let this Gigge be kept;
Ʋnworthy obiect for iudicious eyes:
Which but for you, eternally had slept,
And, but to you, from henceforth euer dies:
But lacke of better, forst me for a shift,
To bring you now this old new New-yeeres gift.
