Honoured, and Beloved,
IT is not any vaine desire to appeare in print that I pre∣sent you with these sheets, but these two reasons have prest me thereunto.
First, because I cannot now preach to your eares, I would leave something before your eyes that might quicken up your spirits to a holy remembrance of what you have formerly heard; for
 carefull and observant reading doth im∣print with more efficacy that which it may be did but passe more transiently thorough the eare; besides, in reading a man may dwell on a nation untill he hath suckt the spirits of it, and yet not lose the next, which in hearing is hazar∣dous; so that primarily my uselessenesse to you (through sicknesse) in preaching hath provoked me, that if possible I might be a little usefull to your soules by this.
2. I have attempted this worke to leave a character and testimony of my deepe sence I have of your great fa∣vours to me; you have nursed me as a Parent his Child: Now what have I to present you with but even this spirituall mite, which is seconded with many desires for your eternall welfare; and this I must say, that I beleeve never more respects
 have been shown by any Corporation in England to the most grave and worthy Preachers among them, than you have shewn to me, unworthy me. Thus I have given you a short account of what moved me to this enterprize, I hope it will be candidly interpreted among you.
I have only one thing to adde (which all the Nation may take notice of and wonder) concerning your happinesse, that these nine yeares, when all the Na∣tion have been in a puzzle about errors, sects, and schismes, even almost to bloud, you have sate as in a Para∣dise, no disturbances in your Pulpits, no railings or disputings, Presbyteri∣ans and Independents preaching in the same place, fasting and praying toge∣ther, in heavenly harmony, expressing nothing but kindnesse to each other, in their meetings ready to help each other;
 and as for the errours of the times that have disturbed so many Towns in Eng∣land, it may be said of Newcastle as of Ireland, the Aire is so pure no such venemous creature can live there; and this hath been through the power of the Gospell, and your carefull Government.
Now the Lord make you reach after immortality, take heed of this evill world. Oh that you may further prize and profit by that precious Gospell which shines among you, and may this little Treatise adde one cubit to your stature in grace, how will it rejoyce the soule of him who is
From my sick Chamber in Axe∣yard in Kingstreet in Westminster.
