Great SIR,
APPELLES having drawn an exquisite picture, ambition tickling Fancy, set it to the view of Censure, and covertly concealed himself; Time, brought to light an Artist, more curious than A∣cute, he sees, dislikes, Appelles mends, and puts  to the view againe; in short time after, he returnes, reviews, nd still dislikes; Appelles marking his transcendency, and find∣ng his imbecillity, dislodges himself and suddainly lets slip this itter Curbe, Sutor ne ultra crepidam.
So, if I, Oh King, like to this unskilfull Artist, have presu∣med, Icarus-like to soare above my pitch, and Phaeton-like to mount the Chariot of the Golden Sun; Let it, I beseech you, be im∣uted to Error Amoris, which I am always bound to offer, and

not to Amor Erroris, which I may not, I must not, nay, I dare not proffer.
Be pleased then, to cast your Princely eye, upon this undigest∣ed lumpe of Virgins waxe, and do but grace it with one Royal smile, and then you Arme, and make him able to incounter with that triple headed Monster, base ingratitude, (at this present your Majesties greatest and heaviest enemy) but, could it infuse into me the strength of Sampson, I would tye those Foxes tayles together, (that go about to disturbe your Peace) and drive them into a Desert, where they should never returne againe, either to destroy your Corne, or hurt your Pasture; but, Oh my good wishes, fall short of my true hearts intention: howsoever this vigor it will adde unto me, that I shall neither expect the hopes of any, nor fear the votes of many; but merrily chant this Miscellany; Nec habeo, nec careo, nec curo: And so upon the bended knees of my heart, praying for your Majesties long and happy Raigne over us, I humbly kisse your Royall hand:
