My Lord,
AS the many undeserved Fa∣vours, with which Your Lordship has already been pleased to honour me, oblige me not to omit any Opportunity of testifying publickly the grateful Sense which I ought always to have of Your Lordship's Kindness; so they en∣courage me to presume further upon Your Lordship's Candour, in publishing these short Discourses un∣der the Patronage of Your Lord∣ship's Name.
The singular Zeal which Your Lordship has shown in making fre∣quent Confirmations, gives us reason to hope, that if the Directi∣ons



which Your Lordship has for∣merly given for the preparing Per∣sons to be Confirmed, be as strict∣ly observed, as the regular and pi∣ous Use of that excellent Institu∣tion seems to be a most probable means of promoting true Religion and Holiness; that Part of the Church, over which God has placed Your Lordship, may become exem∣plarily eminent for the Restoring of Primitive Piety and Order: To which State that it may effectual∣ly arrive; and that Your Lordship may long see it continue therein; and that these short Discourses may contribute their Mite towards the promoting so Noble and Excellent a Design, is the Prayer of,
My LORD,
