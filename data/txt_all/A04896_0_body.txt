Noble Sir:
COnsidering your true affection to Poesie, which (no doubt) proceeds from your singular perfection in that art; seeing also how fervently you are addicted to a speculation of the vertues and beauties of all flowers; I could not choose but present you with the patronage of this dramaticall peece, bringing this small sa∣crifice to the Altar of your worth, as the little Birds (having nought else) were wont to bring their feathers, and the Bees their waxe, to the O∣racle of Apollo.
Yet though the worke doth crave nor Bayes, nor Cedar,
But the mild censure of agracious Reader.

This to the proudest Criticke I dare tell,
It feares nor Frankincense, nor Mackerell,
Nor terrible Tabacco, that consumes
Atlanticke volumes in his smoth'ring fumes.
But howsoever this small pittance may seeme un vorthy your acceptance, yet expecting to find your worth a protection for my weaknesse, Ire∣pose my selfe in an assured hope of your favour, and rest till a more reall occasion may make you a more true owner of my service.
Yours really,
RA. KNEVET.
