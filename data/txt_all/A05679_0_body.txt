HAuing often con∣sidered the sundry curtesies which I haue receyued at the handes of ma∣nie, to whom I must and doe confesse my selfe deepely indebted, and vn∣able in anie small part to repaie. I

find none to whome I ought to ac∣knowledge my self so dutifully boūd for their benefits, as to your wor∣shippe, the great bountie whereof I haue often and plenteously tasted: for which cause partly pricked for∣ward by duetie, as also encouraged through your singular courtesie, knowing you to be a fauorer of the Gospell a maecenas to learned men and good literature, a good member to that weale Publike wherein you liue. I am so bold to craue Patro∣cinie to this litle Dialogue; in which is pourtrayed certaine Worldlings Hypocrisies: which I do not present as though the portrayture it selfe were worthie acceptaunce, but as an earnest penie of my wel meaning

and testimonie of a gratefull minde. After that I had throughlie ponde∣red howe greatly manie in the do∣tage of this world doe deceiue them∣selues vnder the cloake of falselie challenged Christianitie, who ac∣compt it as easie a matter to bee a christian, as it is to say the Lords prayer, the Creede, and ten Com∣mandements, and who also esteeme themselues sufficiently to haue dis∣charged their dueties if they come to the Church for fashion sake, heare a litle, and practise lesse: I thought good to set a broch certaine commō Hypocrisies too commonly hatched in the commō wealth of England, which litle labour my desire is, may bee accepted of the vertuous and

godly, for as for the godles & wic∣ked their censure much I esteme not, vnto whom wee maie well saie, as doth Augustine, what doth it profit them to bee called that they are not, and to vsurpe a straunge name: if they loue to be called chri∣stians, let them shewe foorth the fruites of Christianitie, for Chri∣stians haue their names of Christ, and therefore as they challenge the name by inheritaunce, so must they bee coheyres of his holinesse. If they will bee as they would be cal∣led, let them learne to crucifie the concupiscence of the flesh, and mor∣tifie the lustes thereof. If they will be called faithfull, as they trust in the mercie of God through Christ

Iesus, so let them exercise thēselues in all good workes: if they will bee called the members of Christ, let thē take paines to frame themselues according to their heade as farre forth as it is possible in this life: hol∣ding themselues assured that it is vnpossible the head should be of one will and the members of an other. If a man boast that he feareth God and liueth christian like, & neuer∣thelesse contemneth God & casteth his commaundements behinde him, not doing him honour in heart by obedience, to whom with lippes hee acknowledgeth subiection, is it not too too grosse hipocrisie? True it is in deede these men can pretend and carry a goodlie show that they loue

God, it is nothing els but a sinneful & basterdlie loue: for if the hollow∣nesse of their hearts were laid open, wee shoulde finde that they hate him, for like as malefactors coulde wish in heart there were no Judge, no order, no pollicie, no gouerne∣ment in the world, that they might cōmit mischiefe with more libertie: euen so these, what copie soeuer their countenance carrieth, in mind they despise God, and if it were possible, woulde plucke him out of heauen. Thus hoping your Worshippe will shield this litle portraiture frō the assaults & censure of others which are led more by affection, then rea∣son: I cease and craue pardon, for daring to present so slender a gift,

which I acknowledge, is not beauti∣fied with flowers of humane wise∣dome, nor indited with eloquent stile, as those commonly are which are set forth to the world, rather to feede the humors of wanton rea∣ders, then for anie delight to doe good, wishing to your Worship long life, increase of knowledge, perfecte felicitie of the life to come.
