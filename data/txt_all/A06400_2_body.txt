WHEN I had turned into our vulgar language this little worke, Right Honorable, I considered with my selfe, that in auncient time, and also in this our Age, men haue accustomed to dedicate their trauels vnto such vertuous Personages as they haue honored: and I examining my selfe, vnto whom I might addresse this little labour of mine, I thought good to presume to your goodnesse, and present the same to your Lordshippe, as a pledge of my zeale and humble duetie towards you, your honourable and matchlesse vertues deriued in part from your noble Parentes, but more plentifully inriched by your inuincible mind, valiant prowesse, and rare martiall exploytes, in prosecuting all venterous and hardy attemptes which was experimented at your being in Fraunce, to the terrour of your enemies, honour of your countrey, and immortall Fame to you and your Posteritie for euer: wherein you manifest to the eye of the worlde the true Idaea of perfect Nobilitie, leauing to succeeding posteritie a memorable remembrance of your neuer-dying Fame. If your Lordship vouchsafe to patronize my endeuours (not worthy so honourable a Patrone) I shall be surely protected from the ve∣nemous teeth of all carpers and beare with ease the burthen of their reproches: my labours wantes not their reward, if they winne your good will, nor my minde his desire, if you vouch∣fafe to fauour. I cease, wishing your Lordship as many happie yeeres as vertues: commending my labours to your honorable protection, I humbly take my leaue. 
From London the 20. of Aprill. 1597.
