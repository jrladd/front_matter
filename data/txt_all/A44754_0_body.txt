My Lord,
AMong the multitude
of mighty Atchieve∣ments
which your
Highnesse hath per∣formed
so much to
the astonishment of
Mankind, The Dissolving of the late



Long Parliament may well deserve
to bee rank'd in the numbe: For
thereby your Highnesse Hercules-like,
may be said to have quell'd a Mon∣ster
with many heads; such a Mon∣ster
that was like to Gormandize and
Devour the whole Nation, as will
appear in the ensuing Discourse,
which though small in Bulk, yet
the Subject matters is of the great∣est
Concernment (otherwise I had
not ventured on so high a Dedica∣tion)
for it treats of the power and
practise of English Parliaments in
former times, with the first Rise
of the House of Commons, and of
Magna Charta, &c. which will bee
found to have had but hard births.
There was matter enough to
have Compil'd a far greater Vo∣lumn,
but I have woon'd it upon
a small Bottom, in regard that be∣sides
my natural hatred to super∣fluities
and circumlocutionss; I would



not bee so unmannerly as to hold
your Highnesse too long, who
have suca world of high businesses
perpetually in your thoughts. One
thing I humbly promise your High∣nesse,
that the quotations here pro∣duc'd
(whereof there are many)
are all true, and extracted out of
Authentick Records, but what
consequences soever are drawn
from them, the Judgement is still
reserv'd for your Highnesse, En¦dernier
ressort.
There is a memorable saying of
Charles Martell in that mighty Re∣volution
in France, when hee in∣troduc'd
the second Race of Kings,
That in the pursuit of all his acti∣ons,
he used to say, that He followed
not the Ambition of his Heart, as much
as the Inspirations of his Soul, and
the designs of Providence: This may
be applied to your Highnesse in the



Conduct of your great Affairs, and
admirable successes.
So craving pardon for this high pre∣sumption,
and the boldnesse of the
Subject, for which I humbly beg
your protection, I rest in the low∣liest
posture of obedience
