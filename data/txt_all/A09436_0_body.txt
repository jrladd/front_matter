RIght Honourable, the
kingdome of heauen, of
which the scripture spea∣keth
so oft, is proper∣ly
a certaine state or condition,
whereby wee stand in the fauour
and loue of God, in and by
Christ. And this kingdome is
compared to a Graine of Mu∣sterd-seede,
to teach vs that a
man is euen at that instant al∣readie
entred into the kingdome
of heauen, when the Lord that
good husbandman hath cast but
some little portion of faith or
repentance into the ground of
the heart; yea, though it be but

as one graine of musterd-seede.
Of this little graine I haue pen∣ned
this Treatise, in quantitie
answerable thereto: and I now
present the same to your Ladi∣shippe,
not to supplie your want,
(for I hope you are stored with
many graines of this kinde) but
to performe some dutie on my
part. Hoping therefore that
your Ladiship will read and ac∣cept
the same, I take my leaue,
commending you to the blessing
and protection of the Almigh∣tie.
