MY LORD,
WERE the vicissitudes of Fortune, or the danger of an Enemy the worst Inconveniences, the Great and Brave were expos'd to by their Station and Vertue, and same Vertue which rais'd them thi∣ther, would be sufficient to defend them. But there's one thing, 'tis impossible either for them or Heaven it self to a∣void, I mean the importunate Addresses of the World below, to both which the Temples and your Lordships Gates are ever open.
So high a Generosity is a dangerous Vertue, and 'tis as impossible for signal Merit to steal through the World without a Crowd of Dedica∣tions, as a noted Beauty without as many Adorers. The true witty Men choose such Persons as Your Lordship for their Patrons out of judgment, and those who would be thought such, or think themselves so, for that very Reason follow their Example; And though I am not am∣bitious of one of those Characters, nor can pretend to the other, I must own that 'twas not merely the Crowd of your Lordships Addresses hur∣fy'd me hither, since a distinguishing Vertue drew me almost irresistibly; ror even a Blind-man can perceive some glimmering of the Sun, if he turns his Face towards it, though a small Star or any lesser Light would not come behind 'em, to have Wit and Vertue, and Bravery and Honour, that is, to be a true English-man; as they are not Glories which many can aspire to, so it is not possible they should long remain obscure to the World: Without any Reflection on our English Nobility, I hope I may be permitted to wish there were more of 'em like your Lordship, as equally fit to preside in a Council, or lead an Army.
Your Lordship's unblemish'd and unbiast Loyalty to your Royal Master and Mistress at home, remarkably visible, when the French Fleet, not without Invitation hover'd on our Coast the last Summer, can be Rival'd by nothing but your Lordship's Valour abroad; which neither the Turks nor the Germans can forget, as long as either Tra∣dition
or Annals remain amongst 'em. The Christians have given you a Noble Testimony of their Acknowledgment and Gratitude, and all the World knows it must not be a vulgar Merit which can raise a Man to be Count of the Sacred Roman Empire. The Infidels have rea∣son to remember your Lordship while they reflect either on Vienna, Bar∣can, or Gran, they saw you there cover'd with Laurels and Blood, and found their Fate written legibly enough in your Lordships Fore∣head, whatever 'twas in their own: But Providence had reserved for Your Lordship a much more great and inestimable Happiness to allay and sweeten your Lordships Martial Toils, I mean a Branch of the Illustrious Family of the Overkirks. 'Tis love as well as Victory that Crowns the Heroe; And if ever Heaven studied to make the Honou∣rable happy, 'twas when it presented your Lordship with the best of Women, who is as much the Ornament of her Sex as your Lordship is the Envy of your own.
But I must repress that fervour which would carry me beyond the Bounds of Time, tho not of Justice, lest I should be thought a Poet too soon, tho I advance nothing but the most sacred and evident Truths. All that I shall add, is, that there's a greater Infidel to be pull'd down than him your Lordship has already engag'd, and a much more dangerous Enemy to the Liberty and Peace of Christendom; 'tis obvious that I mean the French King: For the humbling whose Pride, and putting speedy Bounds to the Ocean of his Ambition before it has over-whelm'd all the World, The Illustrious Congress at the Hague were lately Assembl'd, where such Measures were concerted, that 'tis beyond either his Policy or his Force to break 'em; and this Congress 'tis, which is the Subject of this present Poem, as well as of the Expectations of Europe. It has little I owne to re∣commend it, any more than its Author, who if he desired to boast of any thing, it should be of his Loyalty to Their Majesties, and Love to his Country; which Character, if he might ever wear in your Lord∣ships Esteem, he shou'd never court Fortune for any other Favour, unless that of having the Honour to subscribe himself,
MY LORD,
