My Lord,
I Trust it shall not be adjudg∣ed overdaring presumpti∣on in me (seeing Mr. Dell did adventure to Dedicate his book to you) that I take the boldnesse to follow him into your presence, and to lay down these Ani∣madversions on his book at your Excel∣lencies feet: If you please, and the mul∣titude of your important affairs will ad∣mit you to cast an eye upon them: I hope you will discern in them, amidst many
 weaknesses, a heart studious of keeping the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, and desirous to speak the truth in love. I have great assurance given me, that your Excellency expressed a reall distaste of some of the Doctrines contained in Mr. Dells book, when he published them in your hearing, and I believe it, being convinced that there are many positions, and expositions in Mr. Dells book, which cannot but afford matter of just offence to a pious and judicious spirit: But I will not presume any farther to trouble your Excellency. The God of power, wisdom and mercy, make you In∣strumental to promote his truth, kingdom and Glory, which is and shall be the hearts desire and prayer of,
My Lord,
