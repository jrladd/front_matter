Right Worship∣full,
when I
thought (accor∣ding
to the cu∣stome)
of put∣ting
forth this little poore



Treatise in the name of
some vertuous and worthy
person, straitway you three
above-named came into my
minde, and I knew not how
to sever you, nor which I
could leave out, therefore
made bold rather to Dedi∣cate
it to you all together,
for these reasons: First, God
hath neerely joyned you
all together by many bonds,
both Civill and Religious,
both of Nature and Grace,
and hath given you to bee
all of one minde in the
Lord. I have also had ex∣ceeding
great experience of
your love both to mee and
to my ministery, and am
much bound unto you all.
I thought it therefore meet
to render this as a small to∣ken



and testimony of my
unfained love and true
thankfulnesse to your Wor∣ships
all. And though never
a one of you but deserve to
beare the Name alone of a
farre better worke than this,
yet seeing as this is my first
fruits in this kinde, so I
know not, but its most like
to bee the last, therefore I
have beene thus bold to
joyne you all together, hum∣bly
craving your accep∣tance
of this poore mite.
And thus desiring to you
all, a principall portion of
blessing of this and all o∣ther
holy helpes that it plea∣seth
God to bring to your
hands, to further you well
to his heavenly kingdome,



I humbly take my leave of
your Worships, resting
ever.
