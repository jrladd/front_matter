COnsidering (right Worshipful) that such men as haue excelled others in vertue or anie ex∣cellent quallitie, doe shine through perpetuall fame all abroad, and are like the bright Sunne beames, surmounting (without comparison) the small and speedie decaying candles of the rude & ignoble: and seeing that this brightnesse of fame hath, and doth not onely shine in men by vertuous studies and con∣templatiue exercises, but also in most worthie feats of chiual∣rv and martiall prowesse (the knowledge & practise whereof Cicero, that most wise and learned Senator, deemed as necessa∣rie as learning and other good gifts of the minde, to maintaine an orderlie common weale.) Considering also that as well the spirit of God hath by the hands of Moses, and of many good men since, published, and that greatly commending them, the valiaunt acts and puissant exploits of sundrie both good and mightie men at armes, as did Homere, Titus Liuius, Salust, with many mo, the right martiall and euer memorable acts of the Greekes, the Romans, &c. All which records of Chiualrie ending to animate others vnto imitating the like, and beeing s a spur to instigate and prick vs forwards vnto prowesse, who lse would bee idle and lie in obscuritie: I haue thought it ot fruitlesse to publish this Mirrour of Knighthood also, in∣ented and set forth rather to encourage dastards and to teach he readie minded what excellencie is in puissant and inuinci∣le mindes, passing common iudgement, then to feede the rea∣der

with an vntruth. Now, sithens custome hath made it to bee as a law in mens hearts obserued, that they account bookes published not to haue sufficient warrant, except they bee dedicated to some worthie personage of authoritie, I am bolde to present vnto your Worship this Booke, entituled▪ The second part of the Mirrour of Knighthood, done out of Spanish, and now newly printed: beeseeching your Worship rather to accept of my good will shewed, than to re∣spect the simplenesse of the gift. Thus ceasing to be tedious, I commit you to the tuition of the Almightie, who blesse you and all yours.
