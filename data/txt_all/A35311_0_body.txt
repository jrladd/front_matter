May it please Your Royal Highness,
AS true History transmits
to posterity the good and
bad Counsels not only,
but also the most Famous Actions
of Great Men; so Princes, and
Men of the first Rank, seem more
particularly concern'd in maintain∣ing

its Sacred Laws against such as
prompted either by their Vanity or
Malice, endeavour too frequently
to pervert the same. I having un∣dertaken
in this present Treatise, to
vindicate in some measure the
KINGDOM of DENMARK, a∣gainst
a nameless Author, who,
(as much as in him lays) has en∣deavoured
to misrepresent the State
of your R. H's Native Country,
and the most antient Rights of your
Royal Family in Denmark: I thought
I should appear to the World to
be wanting in my Duty to your
R. Highness, and to deviate from
that profound Veneration, which I
have always paid to your R. H's
most eminent Vertues of Valour,
Moderation and Love of Truth; it if
I should have committed this Work
to the protection of another, which
I was sensible ought to implore no
other, but that of your Royal

Highnesses. My chief aim in this
Undertaking has been to undeceive
such, as being not acquainted with
the true State of Denmark, might
be apt to mistake fair shining ap∣pearances,
for the Truth it self;
wherein, as I have soughtmore for the
Satisfaction of being approved of by
the most understanding sort, than
the multitude (whose applauses I
never sought, nor valued.) So,
if I have been able to contribute any
thing in this Matter, which may
meet with the least Approbation
from a PRINCE, who by his
BIRTH, and exquisite KNOW∣LEDG
of the Constitutions of his
Native Country, and the Preroga∣tives
of his Royal Ancestors, is the
most unquestionable judge of this
Vindication: I shall always esteem
it as the greatest honour, which
I could pretend to in this un∣dertaking.
Pompous words (the

common ingredient of our new-fashion'd
Dedications) being the
Scorn of great Souls, ought not to
be brought into your R. H's Pre∣sence.
But instead of these, I will
offer my fervent Prayers to Heaven
for the Prosperity of your R. H. and
your most illustrious Family, hum∣bly
intreating your R. H. graciously
to accept of this as an unfeigned Te∣stimony
of my constant Zeal for
your R. H's Service, and begging
leave to call my self,
Your Royal Highness's
Most Humble and
Devoted Servant,
