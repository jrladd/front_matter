MOst affectionately indeared Wife, and Children, one with me by Nature, and by Grace; who therefore may challenge and lay claim to my especial care, love, and respects, besides the discharge of my duty to God, who hath placed you under my circum∣spection, and government, and commands my con∣stant, utmost, and unwearied endeavours, in order to your Eter∣nal Salvation. What my continued pains, and frequent watch∣ing over you, have been, whilst I was present with you, your selves, and the rest of my Family will witness, as to Weekly Ca∣techizing, Morning and Evening expounding the Holy Scriptures, and praying with you, besides my constant Repetition of Sermons, preparation, and particular examination of you, on the Lord's Day, and Monthly Sacraments; and often remembrance of you, as to your Daily exercise of private Prayers, reading of the Scri∣ptures, and the Works of God's faithful Ministers. O let not my above Twenty Years labours be in vain, to any one of you; nay, which is far worse be a great aggrevation, both of your sin, and punishment, should ye offend, and rebel against so much light, and means, and neglect so great salvation. But most dear∣ly beloved; I believe, and hope, better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, although I thus speak; And there∣fore during my above Seven Years Exile, and separation from you, I have not ceased, to put you in remembrance of your duty to God, and to stir you up by Letters, to the continuance in well doing, since you shall reap Glory, and Eternal Life, if you faint not, but persevere and continue therein constant to the end: Witness, that large Epistle, sent unto you, dated from Antwerp, January the first, 1665. Wherein from the Mouth of our most blessed Saviour, (as being in a manner all his words) you are
 exhorted to, and instructed in, what things you are to believe, and to practise; what you are to imbrace; and what to eschew, as to grace and vertue, and as to vice and error: which I earnestly desire you, yea charge you, as a Husband, and a Father, to read often over, or at least once a Quarter. Which were it not all Scripture, and through the grace and mercy of God skimmed, and digested for your edification; I should not by this recom∣mendation have presumed to put so high a value upon it. Since which time, having by God's gracious assistance, finished this Treatise of Faith, (being destitute of Worldly gifts to bestow up∣on you) That in discharge of my duty to God, and to you, I may still continue and express my conjugal, and paternal af∣fection, respectively to the Souls of you all. I have directed and dedicated it to you, and yours; desiring, and requiring your fre∣quent, and serious perusal of it, as being for the subject matter, the most sublime, and holding forth the glorious knowledge of the only Infinite, and most high God; and the wonderful and high Mysteries of Man's Salvation, as they are manifested in the face of the Lord Jesus Christ; who is here lively represented, both to the eye, and to the exercise of your faith, begining with the promise to Adam, and Man's fall and misery, and proceeding to his Incarna∣tion, Life, Death, and Passion, Resurrection, and Assension, and the exercise of his Three-fold Office, as Priest, and Prophet, and King, with all benefits from them, with his Kingdom, considered in its several degrees, and administrations, first as it was legal, and spiri∣tual, under the Law; Secondly, purely spiritual under the Gospel; Thirdly, as it shall be victorious over Sathan, and Worldly enemies, in this latter Age of the World; Fourthly, peaceable, holy and righteous during the Sabbatisms, the Saints Reign a thousand years upon Earth; Fifthly, glorious, after the Resurrection of the Elect, and their Reign with Christ personally, a Thousand Years upon the renewed Earth; Sixthly, Judicial, begining at Christ's second coming, under which the Saints are rewarded, and all the wicked raised, judged, condem∣ned, and cast into the Local Hell, together with the evil Angels; Se∣venthly, Eternally glorious, when Christ's Mediatory Kingdom being expired, & delivered up to the Father, that God may be all in all, the Saints shall be translated into the highest Heavens; that they may there Reign, & live with God and Christ, the Head of the Saints, and Angels, for ever, and for ever. As the subject matter hath a prehe∣minence, as being a discourse of things most excellent above others, the knowledge, beliefe, and saving application thereof to your souls is of all exercises the most excellent, profitable, and delightful, since without faith, and the true knowledge of God in Christ, there is no light, joy, peace, rest, happiness to your souls here, nor in the life to
 come salvation. And to have revealed to you the great misteries, and secret counsel of God, together with their wonderful products to the end of the World, and Scripture-manifestation, which are hid from the ungodly, but discovered by the light of his Word, in the Prophets, in, and by his spirit (to those that fear him) is of all spe∣culative knowledge to Christians the most pleasant, useful, and en∣couraging, as being through an assured hope, that Helmet of salva∣tion, which will carry you victoriously through all difficulties, and op∣position; to triumph in endless glory; together with what I have here sum'd up, as the substance and body of this Treatise, I have also intermixt methodically, many Soliloquies, and Ejaculatory Pe∣titions, as necessary to conclude several principal heads in these Me∣ditations, which I earnestly desire you to make a frequent, and sin∣cere use, and application of, praying you to make them yours, as well as mine; and beseech the Lord that they may have a like ef∣fect upon you, as to your spiritual food and edification, as the first and second concoction hath in the stomack as to a good and perfect digestion, and turning the Meat into a fit Chile to be san∣guified and made good blood and spirits; besides an after chew∣ing of the Cud, by remeditation and practice in a Gospel and spi∣ritual signification, will much difference and distinguish you that are clean Christians, from those that are unclean: who for want of the heat of Divine affections, devour but not digest holy things. To conclude, I desire my great suffering condition, abounding with sorrows, hopes, and fears, and all kinds of Tentations, discomforts and distractions; my above Twenty removes to several Residen∣cies, and more than seven years Exile, and separation from my Books, dearest Friends, and Relations, my ignorance, infirmities, and sinfulness, as being the greatest of sinners, the least of Saints, may excuse, and apologize for me to any of my Brethren of the Churches of Christ, that shall with you read these Contemplations as to any defects, or errors therein, as being one of the lowest Forms in the School of Christ, and therefore ready in all humility to submit any thing herein contained to the Judgment of the Saints that are learned or judicious; and to give, or receive light, or satisfaction to, or from any that differ from me in Opinion. Which I cannot but expect, because of the diversity, and rarity of a great part of this subject, which may be a reason, that plowing with no man's Heifer, in some things I may walk alone, yet left not in the dark and without (as seems to me) a clear light of holy Scripture; hoping that this Essay of mine, as to those great future mysteries, and periods of the Churches state, may give some new light, through the free condescention of God's spirit, to me his poor Exile in Pat∣mos, as to the understanding of many Scripture Prophesies (in my
 Judgment, much mistaken by former Expositors, both ancient and modern; and that though my weak light be but as a rush Candle, yet it may be an occasion of the inflaming and lighting up of great and shining Tapers, both in this generation and in the Age to come.
Most loving, gracious and faithful Consort, and hopeful Chil∣dren, whom I greatly long after in the bowels of Jesus Christ, And for whom, in the words of the Apostle Paul, I frequently pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all Judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent, that ye may be sincere, and without offence, until the day of Christ; Be∣ing filled with the Fruits of Righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God. Phil. 1.8, 9, 10, 11.
For this cause I bow my Knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named; That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his spirit, in the inner Man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts, by faith, that ye be∣ing rooted, and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heigth; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God: Ephes. 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Having the Eyes of your understanding enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the glory of his Inheritance in the Saints; and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us wards, who believe ac∣cording to the working of his mighty Power: Ephes. 1.18, 19. That you all with open Face beholding, as in a Glass, the glory of the Lord, may be changed into the same Image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord: 2 Cor. 3.18. Finally, my dear Brethren, Sisters, and Fellow-members in Christ, (for all other Relation, and Denomination, shall shortly be laid a side.) Farewell, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; And the God of peace and love shall be with you. 2 Cor. 13.11. Amen.
