May it please your Grace,
I Have adventured, though not without blushing and some fear, because of the vastdist∣ance, to dedicate and commit the Tutelage of these two little Or∣phan treatises of my deceast Husband Mr Thomas Bell, Grapes in the Wilderness, and The Character of a Commissioner,

in the person of None-such Nehemiah, to your Grace the every way most fit and proper Person, under the benign in fluence of whose incouraging countenance, he did for a con∣siderable time preach the Gos∣pel at Hamiltoun: And indeed if any other in the World could possibly rival it with your Grace in my esteem, yet could I not without the highest both Inju∣stice and Ingratitude Dedicate them otherwayes, it having been to my certain knowledge his firm resolution, if ever they saw the light, that they should be de∣dicated thus, whose will i 

such things was alwayes, and is still to me as an inviolably ob∣liging Law. I am very confi∣dent your Grace will read them in Print after his death, with the same edifying complacency and delight that you had wont to hear him discourse by vive voice, in the Noble Family, and in the solemne Assembly, for really they resemble their Father to the very life: That I have therefore sent them abroad into the wide World, under the Patronage and Protection of your Graces Noble and Renowned Name, (which will sufficiently secure I am against all the Censures &

Cavills of the most malevolent Carpers of this ill natured Age) will not be construed impardon∣able presumption, is the humble hope of,
Most Noble Princess,
