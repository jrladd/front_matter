Worthy Sir,
THAT neither a private interest, nor itch of vain-glory have the least share in this Undertaking (in whole or in part) God and my own Conscience bear me witness. And that a compliance with the repeated and reasonable commands of some Friends of the Deceased (to whom I bear a deserved respect and honour) have made it publick, you and they are able to testify. 'Tis somewhat larger in the Press than 'twas in the Pulpit: yet no more than what should have been spoken, had the time permitted. What is said of the Dead, I am satisfied, Envy it self cannot disprove or contradict. The Discourse is not polite, but plain. For 'tis never my custom (upon such Solemn occasions) to interline my Sermons



with much Reading, nor to gloss them with much Rhetorick; knowing that the leaves of Antiquity would make but a weak Shield against the stroak of Death. And that the fine Flowers of Rhetorick are not Armour of proof against the Conquering fears of the King of terrors. Such as it is, I hope you will acâˆ£cept: And if it may prove persuasive to any into whose hands it shall fall, timely to prepare themselves for Death and Judgment, I have my desired end, and fervent prayer, who am,
Decemb. 1. 1683.
Sir,
