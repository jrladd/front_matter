Right Honourable:
MY LORD: The Author of these Poemes and other Lines, my deere Brother, being lately Deceased, and I loth that his Elaborate workes should die, & be buried in Oblivion, thought good rather to commit them to the

Presse, And doe make bold to make choise of your Noble Selfe, desiring you to deigne the Patronage of them: And I am induced so to doe in two re∣spects; First, because your Honour is the Prime Mecaenas of the Muses, of your Noble Ranke, that I know, of Great Britaine: Secondly, for that I am not ignorant of you Honours fa∣uourable and benigne acceptance of some other the Authors Poemes, from his owne hands. Why shall I then doubt of your Acceptance of these? The Orphanes of him, who to say no more, whiles hee had breath, as he was much obliged, so did highly prize and honour your Lordship.
Vouchsafe therefore, most Noble Lord, not onely the Patronage hereof against the malevolent detractors and vulgar mouthes (if any such there be)

but the pardoning of my audacitie herein, beeing altogether unknowne unto you.
Now, Noble SIR, as the World knowes you were one of King IAMES his Northerne WORTHIES; so, who will denie but our gracious King CHARLES accompts you no lesse? And that your Honour, Name and Fame, are not confined within the Empire of Great Britaine, appeares by that thrice honorable Office conferred on you by the most Christian French King: I pray GOD giue you increase of Honour on Earth, and hereafter immortall Honor in Heaven. And so, I humbly take my leaue of your Noble Lordship.
