Scriptures I haue handled among
you, endeuoured to acquaint you
with the whole Counsell of God:
and what is now the top of all my
ambition, but to make you Doers,
of what you haue beene Hearers?
Wherein consists the delight of
Husbandman? not in his plowing,
sowing, or carting, but to see the
Furrowes crowned, and Barnes
filled with the fruit of his labours.
Quū desideria bona concipimus, semen in terram mittimus; quum verò opera recta incipimus, herba sumus; quum ad profectum boni operis crescimus, ad spicam perue∣nimus; quum in eiusdem boni ope∣ris perfectione solidamur, bonum frumentum in spica proferimus Greg. in hom. When we preach, we sow the seed;
when we see good desires, then the
corne sprouts vp; when people be∣gin
to doe well, then it blades: but
when they are abundant in good
workes, then are the eares laden
with corne; when stedfast and per∣seuering
to the end, then are they
ripe for Gods barne. It was pride
in Montanus to ouerweene his

Pepuza,. Euseb. l. 5. c. 17. and Tymium, two pelt∣ing
parishes in Phrygia, and to call
them Hierusalem, as if they had
been the onely Churches in the
world. But this is the commenda∣ble
zeale of euery true Pastor,
to adorne his owne Lot, and to
wish his Garden as the Eden of
God. Such shall you be, if GOD
shall please to water the meanes
you haue, with the dew of his Spi∣rit,
to continue and increase your
loue to hearing and doing; to the
muzzling of the mouthes of all
scoffers and scorners at profession,
to the ioy, crowne, and eternall
happinesse of your owne soules, and
such as God hath made watchmen
ouer them, and of mee the vnwor∣thiest
of the rest.
