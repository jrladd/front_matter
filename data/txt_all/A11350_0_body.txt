AMongst all the parts of phy∣sick (Right Worshipfull) I suppose there is none to be preferd before that part, which preserueth health, and preuenteth sicknesse, for as Tully saith, Health is the most perfect state of mans body in this life, and the only end and intention, whereunto the Physician diuer∣teth all his doings, which state to continue and to enioy, is much better then to haz∣zard the recouery of a sicknesse, that by ill dyet is taken, as it is better to stand fast, hen to fall, and rise againe; and better to epe still a Fortresse or a Castle, then when

we haue suffered the Enemy to enter, to rescue it againe, for as the Poet saith:
Aegrius eijcitur quam non admittitur hospes.
And because as Cornelius Celsus saith, that all medicines do in a manner hurt the stomack, and be of euill nutriment. And therefore Aesclipiades did endeuour most to cure his Patients by dyet; which dyet, Right Worshipfull, I haue here described and published to the view of the world, and haue sheltered it vnder the title of your Name, praying you to accept the same with a willing minde, considering that I haue no better thing to present you with: And as that Persian Monarch did dayne to re∣ceiue from a poore man a handfull of cold water, so your Worship will accept this poore labor, which I now present you with, which shall encourage me hereafter to pre∣sent you with some other labours of more worth. In the meane while, I humbly take my leaue, cōmitting both you and all yours vnto the protection of the Almightie.
