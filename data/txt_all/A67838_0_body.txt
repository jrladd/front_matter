ILlustrious Denmark! If a Parent's Grief,
And Tears so justly shed admit Relief:
Accept this Tribute to your Sorrows paid,
To Albion's Loss, and Glocester's happy Shade;
Tho' time denies, the Lyre's perswasive Sound
May calm your Sighs, and heal the Fatal Wound.


Transcending Blessings bear the shortest date,
And wondrous Births Early resign to Fate:
They're form'd by Nature of superiour Mould,
Of too refin'd a Substance to grow Old.
The World had else enjoy'd Thy Glocester long,
And Heav'n deferr'd the Muses mournful Song:
Till after Triumph's past, and Empire's won,
And all his finish'd course with Glory run,
He downward bent his Rays, like a descending Sun.



O Royal Fair! adorn'd with ev'ry Grace!
The last Support of thy Imperial Race!
If yet your tender Bosom dares peruse
The faint Essays of a dejected Muse:
Behold the glorious Shrine of Fame display'd,
Whilst Death withdraws its formidable shade:
See where your God-like Ancestours in State
Elude the Grave, and triumph over Fate;
The Urns of celebrated Princes view,
Whose long transmitted Virtues shine in You.


Nor yet the fond Britannia's Tears disdain,
The Silvan Scene, and Language of the Plain:
Beneath a Shade Immortal Virgil sate,
With Shepherds sung, and mourn'd his Daphnis Fate.


Vouchsafe this humble Off'ring to receive,
Accept the Muses Flights, her Faults forgive:
Since none their Tears with greater Sorrow shed,
Admir'd him Living more, nor mourn'd him Dead.


Mag. Coll. Oxon. Sept. the 20th. 1700.
