THe dispensations of God, though never so seemingly strange to∣wards his people, have always been propitious and fa∣vourable: according to that of the Apostle, he maketh all things work together for good to those that love him, and are called according to his purpose. How great love should we then have for them who love God, and are so beloved of him!
