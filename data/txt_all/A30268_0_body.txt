My Excellent, and very Dear Friends.
OTher Readers [probably] will mistake: But, I pray do not you. Here's no Epistle Dedi∣catory: I prefix your Names here for nothing else, but to make me place to
shew you, that I Forget you not, nor my great Obligations to you. I and mine, do commemorate often in England, your goodness to us in Ireland. And being [you see on what Occasion] now pre∣vail'd with, to appear in publick, it li∣ked me thus to have our Gratitude ap∣pear too. You will look on the following Pages, for the Author's sake: And you will prize them for the Subjects sake; I beseech you set your selves to the Duty they commend, for God and your Souls sake: I believe I shall never see you more, till Jesus comes, Oh! may we then meet him, and each other with joy! And in the mean time, all our Days, keep pro∣viding for that great, and [if not pro∣vided for] Terrible one. Tis Death in your Thoughts, must put Life into your Actions, said Blessed Vines. And Mr. Baxter himself could say of Heaven, [in Vines his Elegy]
Sin doth not only keep me thence,
But makes me loth to go from hence.
Look well to your selves, My Invalua∣ble
dear Friends! You have sundry excel∣ent Monitors by you; Singularly [my thrice dearest] Dr. T. H. whose life and labours the Lord continue to Dub∣in. I commend you, and all your dear∣est Ones, to divine Tuition and Grace; it's most incorruptly that I profess my self,

From my House in Bayden neer Malbrough, Wilts, Aug. 30. 1675.
