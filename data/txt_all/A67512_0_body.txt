SInce my very good Friend, but now under the Hatches,
And as poor as a Seller of Brooms and Card-matches,
Thou hast left off thy Quibbles, thy Songs, and thy Catches.


Prithee leave off thy Sober dull Plodding and thinking,
And into thy Pockets get Ready and Chink in,
And then I'le allow thee a Time for good Drinking.


For till then be thy Parts ne're so Modish and Florid,
Till with Darby's and Smelts thou thy Purse hast well stored,
There's a Fool in thy Face, and an Ass in thy Forehead.


What a Pox do I care for a Monyless Fellow?
If he speaks ne're so Witty he seems but to Bellow,
If he wants the true Blessings of White and of Yellow.



Till thou Mony hast got, thy Brisk Humour will falter,
Till thou hast it ne're spare neither Temple nor Altar,
But a Word by the by, Have a care of the Halter.


But let happen What will, get some Mony how er'e,
Cog, Flatter, Dissemble, Lye, Swear, and Forswear,
And attempt any Action a brave Fellow dare.


Be a Pimp, or a Pander, a Sharper, or Bully,
A Decoy, a Trappan, or a Counterfeit Cully,
And never give ore till thou'st done the trick fully.


Swear old Men are young, and Queen Blowze is a Beauty,
Undo pretty Virgins, tempts Wives from their Duty,
And be true to all Interests you think will be true t'ye.


Out-rail a Bilk't Coachman, Out-banter a Wit,
Out-lye a News-writer, out-promise a Cit,
Strive thy self to out-do if the Thing thou canst hit.


More Women deceive than did Wickham of late,
Religion or Bawdy or any thing Prate,
And put on all Shapes so thou get but the Plate.


Prithee never want Mony what ever may lack thee,
For when thou hast Mony no Friends will forsake thee,
But if thour't without it the Devil may take thee.

Thy Friend (if thou wilt be thine own)
Tom of Ten Thousand.
