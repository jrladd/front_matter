MY LORD,
I NOW see cause to wish that I had given to your Lordship the trouble of reading my papers of Original Sin, before their publication; for though I have said all that which I found materi∣al in the Question, yet I perceive that it had been fitting I had spoken some things less material, so to prevent the apprehensions that some have of this doctrine, that it is of a sence differing from the usual expressions of the Church of Eng∣land. However, my Lord, since your Lordship is pleased to be care∣ful not only of truth, and Gods glory, but desirous also that even all of us should speak the same thing, and understand each other with∣out Jealousies, or severer censures, I have now obeyed your Coun∣sel, and done all my part towards the asserting the truth, and secu∣ring charity, and unity: Professing with all truth and ingenuity, that I would rather die than either willingly give occasion or counte∣nance to a Schism in the Church of England; and I would suffer much evil before I would displease my dear Brethren in the ser∣vice of Jesus, and in the ministeries of the Church. But as I have not given just cause of offence to any, so I pray that they may not be offended unjustly, lest the fault lie on them, whose persons I so much love, and whose eternal interest I do so much desire may be secured and advanced.
Now, my Lord, I had thought I had been secured in the Ar∣ticle, not only for the truth of the Doctrine, but for the advantages and comforts it brings. I was confident they would not, because there was no cause any men should, be angry at it; For it is strange to me that any man should desire to believe God to be more severe, and less gentle: That men should be greedy to find out inevitable ways

of being damned, that they should be unwilling to have the vail drawn away from the face of Gods goodness, and that they should desire to see an angry countenance; and be displeased at the glad tidings of the Gospel of peace; It is strange to me that men should desire to believe that their pretty Babes which are strangled at the gates of the womb or die before Baptism, should for ought they know, die eternally and be damned, and that themselves should consent to it, and to them that invent Reasons to make it seem just; They might have had not only pretences but reasons to be troubled, if I had represented God to be so great a hater of Man∣kind, as to damn millions of millions for that which they could not help, or if I had taught that their infants might by chance have gone to Hell, and as soon as ever they came for life descend to an eter∣nal death; If I had told them evil things of God and hard mea∣sures, and evil portions to their children, they might have com∣plained; but to complain because I say God is just to all, and mer∣ciful and just to infants, to fret and be peevish because I tell them, that nothing but good things are to be expected from our good God, is a thing that may well be wondred at. My Lord, I take a great comfort in this, that my doctrine stands on that side, where Gods justice and goodness and mercy stand apparently: and they that speak otherwise in this Article, are forced by convulsions and violences to draw their doctrine to comply with Gods justice, and the reputa∣tion of his most glorious Attributes. And after great and labo∣rious devices, they must needs do it pitifully and jejunely; but I will prejudice no mans opinion; I only will defend my own, be∣cause in so doing I have the honour to be an advocate for God, who will defend and accept me, in the simplicity and innocency of my pur∣poses and the profession of his truth.
Now my Lord, I find that some believe this doctrine ought not now to have been published: Others think it not true. The first are the wise and few: the others are the many who have been taught otherwise, and either have not leisure, or abilities to make right judgments in the question. Concerning the first I have given what accounts I could, to that excellent man the Lord Bishop of Sarum, who out of his great piety and prudence and his great kind∣ness to me was pleased to call for accounts of me. Concerning the other, your Lordship in great humility, and in great tenderness to those who are not perswaded of the truth of this doctrine hath called upon me to give all those just measures of satisfaction, which I could

be obliged to, by the interest of any Christian vertue. In obedience to this pious care and prudent counsel of your Lordship, I have pub∣lished these ensuing Papers, hoping that God will bless them to the purposes whither they are designed: however I have done all that I could, and all that I am commanded, and all that I was counselled to. And as I submit all to Gods blessing, and the events of his providence and Oeconomy, so my doctrine I humbly submit to my holy Mother the Church of England, and rejoyce in any circumstan∣ces by which I can testifie my duty to her and my obedience to your Lordship.
