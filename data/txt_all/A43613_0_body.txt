My LORD,
I Come not now to praise you, 'tis needless; for, who can be igno∣rant, what a mighty Hand (both Military and Civil) you have, as successfully, as vigorously extended, (under the happy Influence of their Sacred Majesties) as a Tutelar and Angelical Guardian of these King∣doms, (amongst other Worthies) in this auspicious and late Revolution; And in the Hand of the Almighty, a signal Instrument of our Deliverance from impending Ruine, venturing all that was near and dear unto you, as well as your Life, to help to save ours, by a Kindness as superlative as your Courage and Conduct?
Much less do I come with this little Manual, to avert your more Im∣portant Studies; It will rather (I hope) divert your Cares in your soft∣er Minutes. But however, if the Picture I draw do not please, yet be∣ing in minoture, so short a view cannot long detain you.
That Church-Ruffler (in this following Character expos'd) has so dis∣compos'd and dfa'd to his uttermost the Church, that to pourtry his Deformity in its proper Features, requires more of the skill and dexterity (of a Titian) than to limn a perfect Beauty; and the Divertisement is as pleasant to a judicious Eye, that Examines even the Shades of every Line and Lineament; but my Ink is not black enough to draw him in his proper Colours, and sutable to that Havock he has made in the Church in our Age. For, like the Moor of Venice, he has been as bloody as black; and to decipher his Face to the Life, my blunter Pen should have been sharpned, and (imitating the keen Fury against the less Haggard Face of Witches) scratch't it, 'till the trickling Blood had supply'd my Pen with Colours proper for his Character.
Some perhaps will wonder where this Ecclesiastical Scarramuchio has rk't all this while, that he should not be visible enough 'till his Picture e drawn: But, I bring no News, nor tell any false Tales, for he has long een descry'd, but now is the Time, to let him see the Spots in his dirty ace, if he will but impartially view himself in this Mirrour.
But, if he happen to be enraged at his own Physyognomy, (like that d Lady that broke all the Looking-glasses she could come at, because ot one of them would show her a handsome Face) and he offer to break his Glass, where can it better seek for shelter than under your Lordships tronage, that is as generously willing as able to protect oppressed inocence.
For, as such, I must and may recommend it to your Honourable Protecti∣; which would be affronted, if it appear not to be so very Innocent, at it hurts no Man; describing and characterizing the Vice, not the lty Person (vitium non virum) offending none but that dull Fool (if ere be any so dull) as to hold up his hand and cry Culprit.
Some Ceremonies are as necessary as useful in our Address to Heaven;
as also whenwe pay our due Respects to the Thrones below; but the Ce∣remonies here expos'd, are the Bastard-brood that Popery and Foppery begot in our Protestant Church; and which neither the Laws of God, nor the King, does legitimate.
For when the Popish Ceremony monger was at the Reformation exclu∣ded and shut out of our Protestant Church, he had ('till now) Interest enough (notwithstanding) to make my Ceremony monger his Surrogate, or dull Tool: And the duller Tool, the fairer Candidate for the place; so he had but wit enough to remember his Creator, and know his Cue: And since Popery (plain bare fac't Popery) was inconsistent with the Laws of our holier Church, and being Adulterate, and consequently Ille∣gitimate, Therefore a Popish Ceremony in Masquerade, an Ecclesiastical Symn must be laid in its room.
But none of their Spiritual Changlings shal inherit here; nor is any other here condemned but what has made great waste, and disturbed the Peace of the Church; and must necessarily bring True Religion to an ir∣recoverable weakness and Consumption, if much longer tolerated.
That Redemption (which St. George, the Champion of England gave to the Virgin ready to be ravaged by the Dragon) may be fabulous; but it is certain, that your Lordship cannot better deserve the most Ho∣nourable (George and) Garter, nor more immortalize your great Name, than by improving your happy Talent, and Interest in their Sacred Majesties, that they may (by redeeming the Church from Popish-like Slavery, in non-sensical and illegal Ceremonies) grace with fresh Lustre, that old (but sometimes sullied) Flower of the Crown—Defender of the Faith: That so, as our Renowned King William, the Conqueror (of Hearts, and therefore the Conqueror) of Kingdoms, may perfect a Re∣demption for us in the Church, without Blood, as well as our late miracu∣lous (because not sanguinary) Redemption in the State; Whereby Prie has the fairest Ground in the World, whereon to build her self a so id∣ly, so illegal despair of the vain Attempt; their Sacred Majesties being as humble as high; like the State-house at Amsterdam, whose Foundation is as deep in the Ground, as their Pinacles high, and maing the Skies.
And what Rebel to Heaven, as well as Traitors to their Sacred Maje∣sties, can refuse due Homage and Fealty to such Landlords, to whom God himself has deign'd to give Livery and Seizin, and given, by his vi∣sible Hand, Possession of the Throne?
And as the Countenance (only) of former Kings gave Life to these Popish like Brats (meerly for their likeness to Popery) so their sacred Majesties can kill the Changling (only) with a Frown; so futile, so id∣ly, so illegal and Spiritless a thing is this same Ecclesiastical Bugg (here characterz'd); And yet as little and as weak as he is, he has been a most mischievous Scandal and Stumbling blok to keep his Betters out of the Church, as well as the better half of the Kingdom, and consequently has made the Church so little, so schismatical, so divided; and therefore weak, dull and dark; as being so mainly dedicated to the spurious and ir∣rational Whimsies of his Ecclesiastical Noddle and Invention.
But how Nonsensical soever his Whimsies are, he has made true steps thereon (sometimes) to mount to the Pinnacles of the Temple, and
there secure as well as engross the Honours and Priviledges of the Church (as a Monopoly) to himself (if possible) and to the Men of his scantling and little way.
Have we not the like Conlsions in 189▪ a in 1639, both in Church and State, and from a like Cause too?
The then Star-chamber was reviv'd in the late King's Bench, and the High-Commission Court sat again in the Council Chamber, the Popish like Ceremony-monger has again debauch' the Virgin Purity of Primi∣tive Religion, and ravish't her mo impudently in the very Church; where we that have sen both the Years, —39, and—89, may well be af∣frighted to see the Ghost of little Doctor Laud (that occasion'd the Com∣motions of Civil War (first) in Scoland, afterwards in England) now again, (to our great astonishment) to walk in the Church.
I have done my endeavour to lay the Ghost, and charm it down; let it go to Rome, its birthplace, what does it do here in a Protestant Church? where, if my Ceremony-monger Sin before all, Rebuke before all; nay, rebuke them sharply, saith St. Paul, , cuttingly.
The Corruptions are great, and deeply impohumated, a Gangreen may well be feared; and if I have, with sharp and cuing Words (some∣times) gone to the very bottom of the Sore, (why should they roar so?) 'tis but to let out the Filth, my Ceremony-monger will thank me, if he overlive his Ulcer; was it ever (before now) drest to the bot∣tom?
They'l say, my Style bites; Yes truly, I have made a File of it for the very nonce, to file off the Rost of an Iron Ag; I have lent a hand to po∣lish it: Let them call it an Incision Knife, a File, (or what they will) a Besom (if they please) I care not, so it do but help to sweep down the Futile, and frail Church Cobwebs, though they hang aloft.
And tho I have anointed my Incision-Kae with Weapon Salve, to cure as it cuts, yet I But, as Bellarmine, in a far it is but wise foresight to eek some noble Shelter, and where better, than un∣der Your Lordship's Patronage and Protection?
To which I might make some remote and modest Title, by Consangui∣nity, (for no Man was ever counted Vain or Arrogant in making claim to his Blth right) one half of the Blood in my Veins, (my Mother ing a Troutbeck) is lineally descended and derived from the Noble Blood of the Trouteeks, the Autient Earls of Shrewsbury, whence you derive half of your Noble Blood, and all your Noble Title.
But, as ellarmine, in a far greater Case, having writ several Treatises of the Merit of Goods Works, concludes, that in reference to the Soul's Salvation, The best Title is Free Grace; so, in this far Inferiour Case, to protect and save this little Treatise, from the desperate Assaults of devilish and wicked Men, by your Noble Patronage, The best Title I can make to it, is your own Free-Grace, and Generous Goodness, which (be pleased to) vouchsafe to
