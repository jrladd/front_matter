TO whome, vnder Christ, should I render this account of my poore labours in my charge, but vnto your selfe, Right worshipfull; by whose meanes the Lord vouchsafed mee so free and comfortable an entrance therein to? Jt is the Lord Iesus, the doore of the sheepe, of whom you haue ob∣tayned
 this mercie, rather to be, a∣mong few, a faithfull dorekeeper in his house; then to dwell, with manie, in the Simoniacall taberna∣cles of wickednesse. Neither shall it euer repent you, that you haue not drunke of those stollen waters, or rather of that blood of soules; wherewith too manie, in these gold-thirstie daies, doe purchase Acelda∣ma vnto them and theirs. Let others enrich themselues with the wages of vnrighteousnesse; let them make their boast of their co∣uetous desire, and blesse themselues in their contempt of the Lord: but let the Lord keep this for euer in the purpose of the hearts of his seruants, to deale faithfully and vprightlie in so honourable and weightie a trust. And let such as haue found
 this blessing, in these corrupt daies, to haue a free accesse to the worke and charge of the ministerie, thank∣fullie acknowledge the same both to God and man. Amongst whome I gladlie professe my selfe to be one; and therefore, to the honour of God, and the iust acknowledgement of your Christian integritie, I commend this worke to your worthy name and Patronage: your example to the me∣morie and imitation of posteritie: & your selfe with all your Worship∣full familie, to the holie direction and safe tuition of Almightie God.
