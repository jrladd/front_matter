You Noble Brothers,
GIve me leave to make you
Partners in my Dedica∣tion
with this honoura∣ble
Lady, as she is Part∣ner
in your Losse: How much I am
bound to this service, I appeale to
you: How much my expressions
come short of his merit, I appeale to
the world. His worth and my grief,
require stupifaction rather then lan∣guage:
Leves loquuntur; ingentes stu∣pent.

He hath left you the rich Inhe∣ritance
of a rare example, which if
you truely follow, shall follow you
to that glory which hee enjoyes,
whose gray hairs you have brought
in peace and honor to the ground.
