Although (Right Worshipfull) nowe long di∣stāce of place and time, hath severed vs, yet the exceeding greate kindnes you alwaies bore towards mee, whilest you
 lived in Oxforde, hath wrote so deep an impres∣sion in my minde, that nei∣ther discōtinuāce of time, nor distance of place, hath any thing abated my wō∣ted dutifull affection to∣wards you. Presuming of the like affection in you towardes mee, (knowing your kind dispositiō) I am imboldned to offer, & de∣dicate this my little book vnto you: the which being conscious of his own im∣perfections, craues your patronage, and favour;
 which if it may obtaine, it fears not to come abroad into the view of men, & if you vvill vouchsafe to reade & like of it, it seaes not the censure of others, both which it hopes the rather to obtaine for my sake. It is not long, nor te∣dious, & (I hope) it is pro∣fitable, and therefore it hopes the better accep∣tāce, the which if it mighte obtaine, you shall make mee not repent mine en∣devours. Thus my hum∣ble duty remēbred I com∣mit
 you to the tuition of the Almightie.
