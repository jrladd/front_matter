May it please your Most Excellent Majesty,
THis little Treatise, which was written in my Youth, was the first Fruits of my Travels, and ought to have been offered in the Years of my Minority, when perhaps it had looked much more like my self then it doth at pre∣sent: But because the Words only are Mine, and the Sence and Scope the Thoughts and

Contrivance of a Serious Don; the Subject will be liable to no other Incongruity, then that which is now common in the World, where we see Men of Years and Gravity dressed in the Hair and Fashion of the Youthful. But be the Attire what it will, I am sure the Sub∣ject, which is Morality, giving Rules for a Vertuous and Pru∣dent Life, is seasonable in all Ages; and much more condu∣ducing to the common good of Your Majesties Kingdoms, then the swarms of Libels, and Sedi∣tious Pamphlets, which fill the Press; and are the Entertain∣ments of Men who are wanton

and at ease. It is want of true Morality which makes Men Censurers of others Actions, neglecting in the mean time to pry into their own: It makes them Proud, High-minded, and Boasters, and gives them confi∣dence to arraign Princes, and their Cabinet Counsels of Go∣vernment; whilst in the mean time they are so far from Ru∣ling their own little World with∣in them, that they are not able to subdue a Passion, or mode∣rate that little, or untowardly Member of their Tongue. But our CRITICK, which suggests bet∣ter things, doth with that Hu∣mility which he teaches, appear

before your Majesty, being con∣ducted to your Royal Presence by the Interpreter, who having received Encouragement by the Gracious Eye, your Majesty hath been pleased to bestow on his other Writings, doth with greater Boldness, and yet with due Reverence, tender this at your Royal Feet, Praying al∣ways for the long Life of your Sacred Majesty, in which the Peace, Prosperity, and Welfare of your People is bound up; and that God Almighty may ever Bless your Majesty with Increase of Honour, Triumph, and greater Exaltation of Glory, are the un∣faigned,

and fervent Prayers of,
Most Dread Soveraign,Your MAJESTIES Most Dutiful Subject, and most Humble Servant,
