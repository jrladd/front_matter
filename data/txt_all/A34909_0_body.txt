My LORD,
I Take the Liberty, though in
your Absence, to present
you with the ensuing Trea∣tise.
It were sufficient to entitle
it to your Patronage, that the Sub∣ject

of it does nearly concern the
Honour of your Country; but it
has a more peculiar Claim to your
Favour, since it is one of the post∣humous
Works of your Great
Grand-father Sir Thomas Craig.
The Honourable Name his Book
de Feudis has acquir'd him all
over Europe, and which he has
in his own Country upon many
other Accounts, lays (not to men∣tion
the Duties of Nature) par∣ticular
Obligations to him upon
those descended of him. Besides,
the Subject of the following Trea∣tise
requiring the Knowledg of
the Laws and Customs of your
Country to judg of it, who can

do it better than your Lord∣ship,
who has made the Pur∣suit
of Knowledg so much your
Work, and to whom this Know∣ledg
(could Knowledg be trans∣mitted
with the Blood, as Vice
is) should belong by Inheritance?
My Author Sir Thomas Craig,
and Sir John Skeen, are the
two known Oracles of the Sco∣tish
Law; and the Latter was
your Great Grand-father by the
Mother's side, as the Former
is by your Father's, and both
of them extraordinary Men up∣on
other accounts: Sir John
was eminent by his Birth, he
being related to the Royal Fa∣mily;

as appears by King James
the Sixth's Letters to him yet
extant, and by his Employments
Abroad, he having been Am∣bassador
for K. James to most
of the Courts of Europe, and
advanced to that Honou∣rable
Post ofWhich is the best Post in the Kingdom, if the Honour, Profit, and Interest in the Government which it brings him that has it, be jointly considered. Lord Re∣gister
at Home. But to
go on with your Lord∣ship's
Title to the Know∣ledg
of the Laws and
Customs of your Country, o
rather their Title to your Pro∣tection;
Sir John laid particu∣lar
Obligations upon the Nation
by his digesting and compiling
those Laws and Customs in h

useful Treatise de Verborum
significatione, so much known
and referred to every-where.
Your Grand-Vncle too, Sir
James Skeen his Son, was Pre∣sident
of the SessionThat is in effect, Lord-Chief-Justice of Scotland, for there is but one Soveraign Court of Justice in private Civil Causes there.;
and your Grand-father
the Lord Forresterseat,
was with much Ho∣nour
and Integrity, both
a Iudg and a Privy-Counsellor
above 30 Years. Your Father
also, the Lord Waristoun, ha∣ving
been, because of his Capa∣city
and Knowledg in the Laws,
first King's Advocate, then Lord
Register, lost indeed both his
Life and Fortune by the Ini∣quity

of the late Reigns; but
no Time can deprive him of the
Character which his Integrity
and the Services he did his
Country, have acquir'd him in
the Memory of all good Men.
My Lord,
I shall not enter upon the Sub∣ject
of your own Praise. Things
are stronger than Words, and
show that you are resolved to
imitate such honourable Ance∣stors.
You struggled long under
the Ruines of your Family, but
without yielding to the many
Offers and Opportunities you had

of getting out of them, by doing
any thing contrary to your own
Mind, or otherwise unworthy of
you; and now of late that you
have risen to a great Post by Ways
worthy both of you and it, you
show the same Firmness of Mind
in Prosperity that you did in Ad∣versity;
and neither the daily
tempting Opportunities that such
a Post affords you of recovering
your Family, and becoming sud∣denly
rich, nor the many Exam∣ples
that you have before you of
those that do so in this corrupt
Age, have been sufficient to sub∣due
you.
That your Lordship may go
on steadily in the Ways of Ver∣tue,
and be an Honou to you
Ancestors, as they are an Honour
to you, is the earnest Prayer t
God Almighty, of,
My LORD,
