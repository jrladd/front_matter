SIR,
WHilst I contemplate Your Sufferings, see You (as it were) personating to the life that sadK. James his Pattern of a Kings Inaugura∣tion. Patterne, which from the Archetype of Royall Patience (the King of Heaven himselfe,) the Penne of Your Great Father drew, behold You though under all the Pres∣sures

of these times, yet still a∣bove them, and see ev'n those Crosses intended for Your Af∣flictions, stoop, and bow to You, paying You, (as it were) that Homage which Your people should, and in acknowledge∣ment of Your new Acquest of passive Glory (a Glory, which till Your Majesties sufferings manifested the contrary, was held inconsistent with that of a Crowne) saluting You with the sad, yet sacred Title of the King of Sorrows; I from thence assume the humble boldnesse to think that this Peece of Seneca of The Sufferings of Good Men,

You with Glory on a Heavenly Throne; which that hee would be pleased (as in a Type) to shadow forth unto You in the Happinesse of a speedy and a glorious Restauration to This of Your Majesties Kingdomes; Is the truely zealous, and the just∣ly-bounden Prayer of
