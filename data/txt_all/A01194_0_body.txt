FAire Heauen of Graces, Hauen of content,
The Worlds great Hope, and greater Ornament;
Grace these my labours, with your heauenly eyes,
In whose milde Hauen, my Hope at anchor lies;
Where (may this ship with your safe-conduct ride)
She will not feare a world of foes beside:
Say that some Rouer, who my lading spies,
Shooting to make me his vnlawfull Prize,
Call me a Pirate of anothers wit,
That cannot make me stoope: Ile answere it.
The Goods at first, they were bequeath'd to me,
At my dispose, to change the Propertie.
So that I wasted not the Principall,
For that be you my Iudge imperiall:
VVhere, finde me guilty, punish not my will,
But rather pitty mine vnured skill.
Besides (dread gracious Princesse) this I vow,
By me they'd ne're been alter'd but for yow;
Presuming, natiue cloaths of Brittany,
Would better please then silks of Italy;
Say they'r not good, yet haue I done my best,
To please your Grace, be pleas'd, and I am blest:
