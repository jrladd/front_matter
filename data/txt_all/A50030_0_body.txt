DEare and loving friend, I recei∣ved about tenne daies agon your letter of the 9. of this present: wherein you demand and soli∣cite againe the thing, that I so flatly denied you, at my late being in your chamber: I meane to put in writing the relation which then I made unto you, of the speech had this last Christmas in my presence, betweene my right worshipfull good friend and patron, and his guest the old Lawyer, of some matters in our state and country. And for that you presse me very seriously at this instant, both by request and many reasons, to yeeld to your desire herein, and not only this, but also to give my consent for the publishing of the same, by such secret meanes as you assure me

you can there find out: I have thought good to confer the whole matter with the parties themselves, whom principally it concerneth (who at the receipt of your letter were not far from me:) And albeit at the first I found them averse and nothing inclined to grant your demand: yet after upon conside∣ration of your reasons, and assurance of se∣cresie (especially for that there is nothing in the same contained, repugnant to charity or to our bounden duty towards our most grati∣ous Princes or Countrey, but rather for the speciall good of them both, and for the fore-warning of some dangers imminent to the same) they have referred over the matter to mee, yet with this Proviso, that they will know nothing, nor yet yeeld consent to the pub∣lishing hereof, for feare of some future flou∣rish of the ragged Staffe to come hereafter a∣bout their eares, if their names should breake forth: which (I trust) you will provide, shall neuer happen, both for their security, and for your own. And with this I will end, assuring you that within these five or six dayes, you shall receive the whole in writing by another way and secret meanes, neither shall the bearer suspect what he carrieth: wherof also I thought good to premonish you. And this shall suffice for this time.
