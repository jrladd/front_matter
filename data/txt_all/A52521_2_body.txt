By Vincent Seve of the Town of Beaucaire in Languedoc.

Sir,
HAving some years ago recovered certain Prophecies, or Prognostications, made by the lately Deceased Michael Nostradamus, from the hands of Henry Nostra∣damus his Nephew, which he gave me before his death, and which I have kept secret till now, that I saw they treated of the affairs of your Estate, and par∣ticularly of your Person and Successors, as your self may see if you please tó take the pains to look upon, and wherein you shall find things wory of admiration. I have taken the boldness (though unworthy) to pre∣sent

them to you, transcribed in this little Book, no less wonderful then the other two which he made, for in it he hath treated of what shall happen in this Age 1600, not so obscurely as he hath done formerly, but by aenigmes, specifying so clearly the things he speaketh of, that one may certainly judge of them, as of things that are already come to pass. Being therefore desirous that your Majesty should have the first notice thereof, I thought to discharge my duty in this as one of your most obe∣dient and faithful Subjects, which I intreat your Majesty would be plea∣sed to agree, obliging so not onely the body of one of your faithful Sub∣jects already yours, but also the Soul who shall continue to pray for the health and prosperity of your Majesty, and of all those that have rela∣tion to it, as one that is, and shall ever be,
SIR,

From your Town of Beaucair in Languedoc.
