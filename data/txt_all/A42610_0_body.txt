SIRS,
THE deep obligation you hav laid me under, in the time of my sickness, does not a little move me, to take the first occasion wherein

to acknowledge my self indebted un∣to you.
What I present to your Worships, is a strict survey of Lilly's Gram∣mar, which has bin view'd by several judicious persons and Masters of Free-Schools; and not without their good liking: And I doubt not, but it will giv satisfaction also to you my Worthy and learned Patrons, who are able to judge in the matter, and of competency to put a decision to the point: for, did Athens flourish more with men of learning, than does New-Castle? what City in the Land givs like incouragement thereto, and carries on her affairs with such unanimity and prudence.

I beseech you then allow it the shadow of your wing, and accept this acknowledgement of my gratitude, as a testimony how great my desires are, to manifest that I am unfeign∣edly,
SIRS, 
Aug. 4. 83.
