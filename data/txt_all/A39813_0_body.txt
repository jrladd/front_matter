GO little Book, and to the World present
Out of Gods two one Father's Testament
Shew it a Fletcher, with his quiver full
Of Davids arrowes, labouring to beget
Each child again; the Muses in Chris Schoo
Plainness and pains in one, witt and grac met
Go, challenge that which is deserv'd by few
A Poets laurel, with a Preachers due.
