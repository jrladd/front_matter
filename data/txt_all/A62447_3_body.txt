Worthy Sir,
THE daily Experience I have of your Zeal to Religion, your Loyalty to the Govern∣ment establish'd, and your Kindness to me, has emboldened me to present the following Sermon to your view, which however imperfect (as the rest of my Productions) may yet retrieve to your Memory what you have already heard from the Pulpit. There is variety of Inductions from the words, and such as have led us through some of the most important points of the Christian Faith. It may therefore serve at once for a Ser∣mon
 and System of Religion. Accept it therefore (if not upon these accounts, yet) as it is intended for an acknow∣ledgement of the many obligations by you conferr'd upon,
Good Sir,
Leigh in Essex, Nov. 21. 1682.
