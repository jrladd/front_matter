THis our whole Iland, aunchiantly called Brutaine, but more anchiantly Albion, presently contaynyng two Kingdomes, ENGLAND, and SCOTLAND, is cause (right Honorable) that to distinguish the for∣mer, whose only Occurrants J abridge, from the other, remote from our Historie, I intitell this my Booke ALBIONS ENGLAND. A Subiect, in troth (if self conceit worke not a partiall Iudge) worthie your Honorable Patronage: Howbeit

basely passed vnder so badd an Aucthor. But for great Parsonages gratfully to intertaine the good willes of bad workmen, is answerable to themsel∣ues, and animating to feeble Artistes. I therefore secure of your Honors Clemencie, and herein not vnlike to Phaoton, who at the first did fearfully admier euen the Pallas of Phoebus, but anon feare∣les aduenture euen the presence of Phoebus, hauing dedicated a former Booke, to him that from your Honor deriueth his Birth, now secondly present the like to your Lordshippe: with so much the lesse doubt, and so much to more duetie, by how much the more J esteeme this my latter labour of more valewe, and (omitting your high Tytelles) J owe, and your Lordship expecteth espetiall duetie at the hands of your Seruaunt. And thus (right Honorable) hoping better then J can performe, and yet fearing lesser then J may offend, desirous to please, despret of praise, and destitute of a bet∣ter Present, J make tender only of good will, more J haue not, for your Honors good worde, lesse J hope not.
