FRiendly, frolicke, franke, free∣hearted, famous, flourishing Fishmongers; And braue, bold, battring, Beefe-braining Butchers, to both your Com∣panies in generall I wish health and happi∣nesse: I acknowledge you to be Haberdash∣ers for the belly, and I wish a plentifull in∣crease of good appetites, and hungry sto∣macks, that euery one in their calling may proue valiant of their teeth, whereby you may feede merrily by the profit you receiue by nimble-chop'd feeders. I haue plainely and briefely set downe Iack a Lents good deeds and his bad, his friends and his foes, the great need and necessitie that we haue of his comming once a yeere into this King∣dome,
 and the great pitie that he is no better entertained and obserued. And though it be written in a merrie stile, yet I dare presume that mirth and truth walke together in it. In a word, reade it if you like, and iudge it as you list, please your selues and I am pleased: and giue Iack a Lent no worse fare for his welcome then he deserues; and then hee re∣maines euer yours to be commanded, at the signe of Pisces, for a dish of Powts, a Carp, or a Cods-head.
