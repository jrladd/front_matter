SIR, I hauing been often and much solicited with varietie and iteration of strong importunitie, to publish and let passe into the eie of this censorious world, these, thevery first fruites and essaies of mine imployment and businesse in the Ministerie; did apprehend and embrace this season with better contentment, and with more cheerefulnes addresse and com∣pose my self thereunto: because I did see op∣portunitie offered thereby, to let appeare a∣broad

my thankfull acknowledgement of your respectfull and more then ordinary fa∣uour vnto me; and a publike testimonie of your worthie and exemplarie integritie, in discharging your hands, and faithfully dis∣posing that portion of the Church his pa∣trimonie committed to your trust and con∣science. An affaire (though in these despe∣rately sinfull times, fearfully and accursedly abused) of high and waightie consequence, and of great power, as it shall be discharged with conscience, or corruption, either fur∣ther to ruine our Church, and bring it to more miserie and desolation, or to repaire and aduance it to better state & more hap∣pinesse. For mine owne particular, it hath so pleased God to guide your heart in this bu∣sines, and to blesse me with his prouidence, that wheras too many Patrones now adaies; either by detaining sacrilegiouslie Gods portion, agai all grounds of equitie both diuine & humane; or by furnishing Church∣liuings simoniacally and corruptly, do cer∣tainly pull vpon their own heads, soules and bodies, goods and posteritie, an heauie and

horrible Wll a man spoile his gods? yet haue e spoi∣led me. But yee say, vvherein aue we spoiled thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursd with a curse: or ye haue spoi∣led me, euen this whole nation. Malach. 3.8. curse, and shall thereby make their account to be without fauour at the last day: and whereas many worthie men, after they haue wearied and wasted their bodies and mindes, their spirits and patrimonie in stu∣die, and worne out their hopes with long and tedious expectation, pursuit and de∣pendance; come at length, with much adoe, to no great matters, and when all is done, it is well if they escape all galling and gash of conscience, such is the strange iniquitie of the times: yet I say, so worthily haue you dealt with me, & so vprightly in the Church his cause, that vpon your owne first motion you sent vnto me to accept the place I now enioy from you, and offered me a faire, a free and comfortable passage to the exer∣cise of my Ministerie abroad; which next vnto the saluation of mine own soule, I hold most deare and precious; when I neither sought after, nor thought vpon preferment. This your rare and singular bountie, did at the very first affect me with a secret sense of an extraordinary obligation, for all inward affectionatnes, and with a desire of repre∣senting

it in some visible forme of outward testification. But when I did after further consider, first how that Sacriledge and Si∣monie, that damned couple of crying sins, like two rauenous Harpies, and the two in∣satiable daughters of the Horsleech, had seazd euen vpon the Heart of our Church, readie to rent and teare in peeces her very heart-strings, and to sucke out the inmost blood and last life of our dearest Mother: when I looked aboue me in this famous V∣niuersitie where I haue liued, and saw many reuerend and learned men, full of the light of diuine truth, and of the water of life, able gloriouslie and comfortablie to illighten many darke places and drie soules in this land, readie to expire and powre out their soules in the bosome of this their famous Nurce; not brought vp by her to die at her breasts, but if they might haue honest and lawfull passage, readie and resolute to en∣large Christs kingdome abroad, and to op∣pose with all their power, against the bloo∣die torrent of Poperie and rage of Anti∣christ: lastly, when I weighed with my selfe

mine owne naturall declination and resol∣ued vnfitnes, to make a noise and stirre in the world for preferment: I did finde that as these considerations did before giue small hope of changing my station; so now they were of power yet further to double the impression of your worthie and extraordinarie goodnesse vnto mee, and freshly to renew the thankfull deuotions and apprehensions of mine heart. Out of which hath sprung in me a thirsting earnest∣nes and contention of spirit, to returne vn∣to you, for these temporall fauours, so farre as the nature of that high Ministeriall fun∣ction, wherein I stand, shall guide me, and the power of my poore abilitie can reach; the Blessings of Heauen, and comforts of a better world. To which end, I here present vnto you this Treatise, which I haue inten∣ded to be, so farre as my gracious God hath giuen me vnderstanding in the point, as it were a looking-Glasse or Touchstone, to whomsoeuer it shall please to take thorow notice thereof, for the discerning and try∣ing, in some good measure, whether he al∣readie

bee of the number of those fewe which truly liue the life of God, and vnder the Scepter of his Sonne; or lie as yet en∣thralled in the inuisible chaines of damna∣tion and death, and vnder the large and powerfull raigne of Satan. For I am perswa∣ded, that in this glorious noontide of the Gospell many thousands deceiue not only the world, and others, but euen themselues and their owne soules, about their spiri∣tuall state: thinking, if they finde in them∣selues a freedome from grosse and noto∣rious sinnes, fairenes of conditions, ciuil ho∣nestie, a formall profession of Christianitie, outward performances of religious serui∣ces, that then their case is good enough for heauen; though there bee wanting the sa∣uing power of inward sanctification, and the truth of a sound conuersion; though they bee strangers to the great mysterie of Godlinesse, and disacquainted with a con∣scionable and constant course of Holinesse in their liues and actions. But we must con∣ceiue, that ouer and besides these degrees of goodnesse, with which millions of men

content and deceiue themselues; yea, and quite beyond, and vtterly without the com∣passe of all worldly glorie, all visible pompe, the most admited greatnesse and sufficiency vpon earth, for which a great part of the world exchange the euerlasting happinesse of their soules; there is a Paradise of Chri∣stian comforts, a Royall Peculiar, a victo∣rious Simplicitie, a neglected Innocencie, a marueilous Light, an inuisible Kingdome, an Heauen vpon Earth; which I call the state of Grace; and labour in the ensuing Discourse to difference from al perfections and sufficiencies attaineable in the state of vnregeneration. I meddle not purposely with the notorious sinner: for me thinkes, in these daies of light, there should none so wil∣fully and deeply inwrap himselfe in dark∣nes; but that in his cold blood, and more so∣ber consideration, will acknowledge and confesse, that the state of notorious sinful∣nes, is the state of wretchednes and of death. And that there is no hope for the Drunkard, the Swearer, the Lier, the Vsurer, the vn∣cleane person, the Sabbath-breaker, the Sa∣crilegious,

Simoniacall, and sinners of such infamous ranke; but a fearefull looking for of iudgement, and, without repentance and forsaking their sinnes, an eternall separation both from al possibilitie of grace and sound comfort in this life, and from the fruition of the ioyes and blessednes of heauen hereaf∣ter. I therefore endeuour and desire to come neerer and closer to mens consciences, and to tell them, that out of a conceit of their morall honestie, and outward religiousnes, they may perswade themselues that they are rich and encreased in spirituall store, and haue need of no more for the attainment of heauen; when in deed and truth, as concer∣ning the power of sauing grace, and sincere exercise of religion, they are wretched, and miserable, and poore, and blind and naked. In these luke-warme times, many there are, who with the fruites of a temporarie faith, and some light of the generall graces of the Spirit, make a faire shew, and win good re∣putation for their spirituall state, both with their owne hearts, and with the world a∣broad, when to the eie of heauenly wisdom,

and in truth, they are but only Blazing-stars, and earthly minded, not fixed in the same firmament with the Sunne of righteousnes, nor of an heauenly stampe. And if they rise not higher in their affections and conuersa∣tion from earth and earthly vanities, when their rootlesse graces shall be withered and wasted away, their fall will bee sudden and fearfull; and their former vanishing flashes of vaine hope for future happinesse, will be turned into horror and extremest miseries of despaire. Most behooffull then is it for euery man, in time, to search and examine himselfe whether Christ Iesus be in him or no. And it is one of the worthiest and no∣blest imployment of the soule, to reflect vp∣on it selfe, and with an vndazeled and vndis∣sembling eye thorowly to trie and descrie cleerely it owne state, whether it be already washed with the blood of Christ, and enli∣ued with a supernaturall vigour and life of grace; or yet lie polluted in it owne blood, and vnder the power of the first death. I wonder how any man can bee at rest and quiet, vntill he be assured and secur'd in this

point, sith vpon it depends his euerlasting estate in another world. Nay, sith euen in this world, euery vnregenerate man, let him be otherwise neuer so great, or adored a∣boue others, neuer so absolute in all other excellencies and perfections whatsoeuer; yet being out of the state of grace, is a very limbe of Satan, a child of darknesse, and one of the familie of Hell. The wrath and ven∣geance of God, all the furie of the kingdom of darknesse, the rage of all the creatures, though hee little thinke vpon it, are euerie houre readie and addrest to seize vpon him, as a traitor and rebell to the highest Maie∣stie, and to dragge him downe into the bot∣tome of Hell. Whereas the state of true Christians, and Gods faithfull Ones, is most comfortable and glorious euen in this life in this vale of teares, and in these Taberna∣cles of clay. For their comforts are not fa∣ding and earthly, springing out of the sinfull pleasures & transitorie glorie of the world; not fastned vnto honors, greatnes and pos∣sessions, to the encrease of Corne, and Wine, and Oyle: but they are of a right noble and

heauenly temper, framed and emplanted in the sanctified soule by the spirit of all com∣fort; and therefore euerlasting and vncon∣querable, able to keepe a man in heart and resolution against the malice and cruelties of all aduersaries, of all creatures. They on∣ly are truly and soundly perswaded by the sweet and secret testimonie of the spirit, and by the euidence and experience of their own holy life, that after the approching and much longed for period of a few and euill daies, they shall raigne with God almightie, the holy Angels and glorified Saints, in vn∣utterable and endlesse pleasures for euer and euer: and therfore easily and resolutely with much indignation & contempt, ouer-looke and throw out of their hearts, all worldly thoughtfulnes, all excessiue desires of earth and earthly vanities, all restlesse aspirations after transitorie honors, the noble miseries of this wretched life. They alone haue fast∣ned the eye of their mindes, illightned from aboue with sauing faith, vpon the vnualu∣able pretiousnes and lasting beauty of their immortall crownes in heauen; and therfore

all the glittering and golden representa∣tions, with which the flattering world hath formerly deceiued and dazled their eyes, appeare to be nothing but darknes and de∣solations. Their glorie indeed heere vpon earth doth not consist in outward pompe and state, it doth not shine to carnall eyes, it is vndiscernable to the sharpest sight of worldly wisedome and policie: but inward∣ly and with spirituall fairenes, their diuine graces make them so truly honorable and louely, that somewhere in Scripture they are called the Glory of God, and are as deare vn∣to him as the pretious ball and apple of his owne eye. They are in so high esteeme and account with Angels, that those excellent creatures with much ioy & alacrity become their Guardians, and seruiceable vnto them with extraordinarie care and tendernes. All the creatures groane, and desire to bee deli∣uered into their glorious libertie; and in the meane time, with a secret and insensible reuerence, they adore the sacred character of diuinitie that is stampt vpon them. All the Saints acknowledge them to bee more ex∣cellent

then their neighbours, of the house∣hold of God and heires of heauen. Nay, the wicked themselues, many times, are con∣founded and stand amazed at the height of spirit and resolution that possesseth their hearts, and at the sober & vndanted maiestie that shines in their faces. This, and a thou∣sand times more then this, is the blisfull state of Gods children euen in this life. Howsoe∣uer they be neglected and trampled vpon by the world and wicked men; yet in the iudgement of God himselfe, the blessed spi∣rits, and all men of true worth indeed, they are the only Angels vpon earth, and the royall citizens of this kingdome of Grace. The prosecution of this point would bee comfortable, but so I should be more tedi∣ous. No more but this therfore at this time: Certaine it is, if a man were crowned with the royall state and imperiall command of all the kingdomes vpon earth; if his heart were enlarged to the vtmost of all created capacitie, & filled with all the exquisite and vnmixed pleasures that the reach of mor∣talitie and most ambitious curiositie could

possibly deuise, and might without inter∣ruption and distast enioy them the length of the worlds duration; they were all no∣thing to the enioyment of the pretious and peereles comforts of the state of Grace, but euen for an houre. I speake the truth, I vse no Hyperbole, the Spirit of all comfort, and consciences of all true Christians bearing me witnesse. Good Sir, let me humbly en∣treate you with a proportionable zeale and feruencie, to encline and enlarge your affe∣ctions to the pursuit and practise of so ex∣cellent and glorious an happinesse. Which that you may doe, I will continuallie prostrate and powre out my soule in prayer, before the throne of Grace and mercie: And rest,
