O Honorable Lord, and most victoryous Knyght,
With Grace and Fortune abundantly endewed,
The savegard of England, & maynteyner of right;
That God you loveth indeede he hath well shewed:
Wherefore I trust thys Lond shalbe renewed
With Joy and Riches, with Charyty and Peace,
So that old ranckors understrewed,
Tempestuous troubles and wretchednes shall cease.


And now syth I see by tokens right evident,
That God you guydeth, and that ye be vertuous,
Hating synne, and such as be insolent,
How that also Manslaughter to you is odious,
Upon the Indygent also that ye be piteous,
Greate ruth it were if ye should not lyve longe:
For of your great fortune ye be not presumptuous,
Nor vengeable of mynde to wreke every wrong.


Theis considered, with others, in your most noble Estate,
Like as God knoweth, and people doe witnesse beare,
So entyrely me meveth, that I must algate
Recorde the same, and therein be no flatterer:
And that not onely, but also to write here,
And to your Highnes humbly for to present
Great Secretts which I in farre Countryes did lert,
And which by grace to me most unworthy are lent.



Once to your Lordship such thyngs I did promise,
What tyme ye did command to send unto me;
And since that I wrote in full secret wise,
Unto your Grace from the Universitie
Of Lovayne, when God fortuned me by Grace to see
Greater secretts and moch more profyte,
Which onely to you I wyll disclosed to be:
That is to say the great Elixirs both Red and White.


For like it you to trust that trewlie I have found
The perfect waye of most secrete Alchimy,
Which I wyll never trwly for Mrke ne for Pounde
Make common but to you, and that conditionally
That to your selfe ye shall keepe it full secretly,
And onely it use as may be to Gods pleasure,
Els in tyme comming, of God I should abye
For my discovering of his secrete treasure.


Therefore advise you well wyth good delyberation,
For of this Secrete shall know none other Creature
But onely you, as I make faithfull Protestation,
For all the tyme that I here in lyfe endure:
Whereto I wyll your Lordship me to ensure,
To my desyre in thys by othe to agree,
Least I should to me the wrath of God procure;
For my revealing his greate gift and previtie.


And yet moreover I wyll your Hyghnes to pardon me,
For openly wyth pen I wyll it never wryte,
But when that ye list by practice ye shall se;
By Mouth also this prtious secret most of delyght,
How may be made Elixirs Red and Whyte,
Playne unto your Hyghnes it shall declared be,
And if it please you with easy expence and respyte
To help, I wyll them make by helpe of the Trinitie.



But notwythstanding for perill that might befall,
Though I dare not here plainly the knot unbinde,
Yet in my writeing I wyll not be so Mysticall,
But that ye may by studie the knowleige finde:
How that eche thing multiplicable is in hys kinde,
And that likenes of bodies Metalline be transmutable
I wyll deelare, that if ye feele me in your minde
Ye shall prove my wryting true and noe fayned fable.


And if God graunt you by me to wynne thys treasure,
Serve him devoutly with more Laud and thanking,
Praying his Godhead in lyfe ye may so endure,
His gifts of grace and fortune to use to his pleasing,
Most specially intending over all thing,
To your power and connyng his precepts tenne
So to keep, that into no daunger your selfe ye bring;
But that ye may in glorie see him hereafter, Amen.


As the Philosopher in the boke of Meteors doth wryte,
That the lykenesse of bodyes Metalline be not transmutable,
But after he added theis words of more delyte,
Without they be reduced to theyr beginning materiable.
Wherefore such bodies which in nature be liquable,
Minerall and Mettaline may be Mercurizate,
Conceave ye may that this Scyence is not opinable,
But very true by Raymond and others determynate.


In the said Boke the Philosopher speaketh also,
Therein if it please your Highnes for to reade,
Of divers Sulphurs, but especially of two;
And of two Mercuryes Joyned to them indede:
Whereby he doth true understanders leade
To the knowledge of the principles which be true;
Both Red most pure, and White, as have I spede,
Which be neverthelesse founden but of right few.



And these two things be best he addeth anone
For them that worketh the Alchimy to take,
Our Gold and our Silver therewith to make alone;
Wherefore I say, who will our Pearle and Ruby make,
The said principles looke that he not forsake:
For at the beginning if his principles be trewe,
And that he can by crafte them so bake;
Trewly at the end his Worke shall him not rewe.


But one greate secret ryght nedefull it is to knowe,
That though the Philosophers speake plurally,
All is but one Thing, ye may me trowe,
In kinde, which is our Base principally,
Whereof doth spring both Whyte and Red naturally;
And yet the Whyte must come fyrst of the Red:
Which thyng is not wrought manually,
But naturally, Craft helping oute of our Leade.


For all the parts of our most precious Stone,
As I can preve, be Coessentiall and concrete;
Moreover there is no true principle but one;
Full longe it was er I therwith could mete:
Who can reduce it, and knoweth his Heate,
And only kinde with kinde can redresse,
Till filth originall be clensed from his Seat,
Likely he is to finde our secrets both more and lesse,


Onlie therefore worke Kynde, with his owne Kynde,
And all your Elements Ioyne that they not strive,
This poynte also for any thing beare in mynde;
That passive natures ye tourne into active,
Of Water, Fire, and Winde, of Erthe make blive;
And of the Quadrangle make ye a Figure round,
Then have ye honie of our bene hive;
One ounce well worth a thousand pound.



The principall secrete of secretes all
Is true Proportion which may not be behinde,
Wherein I councell yow be not superficiall,
The true conclusion if ever ye thinke to fynde,
Turne Erth to Water, and Water into Wynde,
Therof make Fire, and beware of the Floode
Of Noe, wherein many one be blinde;
That by this Science thei get but little good.


I councell you to eate and drinke temperatly,
And be well ware that Iposarcha come not in place;
Nesh not your Wombe by drinking ymmoderatly,
Lest ye quench your naturall Heate in lyttle space;
The colour wyll tell appearing in your Face:
Drinke no more therefore, then ye may eate;
Walke up and downe after an easie pace,
Chafe not your Body too sore for to sweate.


With easy Fire after meving when ye sweate,
Warme your Body and make it dry againe;
By Rivers and Fountaines walke after meate:
At morrowe tymely visit the high Mountaine,
That Phisicke so byddeth I reade certeyne:
So hygh the Mountaine nevertheles ye not ascende,
But that ye may downeward the way have plaine,
And with your Mantell from cold ye yow defende.


Such labour is holsome, your sweat if ye wyll drie
With a napkin, and after it take no cold,
For grosse humors be purged by Sweat kindly;
Use Diacameron, then confect with perfect Gold
Hermodactilus for watrie humors good I hold,
Use Hipericon Perforate with mylke of Tithimall;
And Sperma Cete ana with redd Wyne when ye wax old,
And Gotes Mylke soddeÌ„ with Gold nourisheth moisture radical.



But a good Phisytian who so intendeth to be,
Our lower Astronomy him nedeth well to knowe
And after that to lerne, well, Urine in a glasse to see,
And if it nede to be chafed, the Fyre to blowe,
Then wyttily, it, by divers wayes to throwe,
And after the cause to make a Medicine blive,
Truly telling the ynfirmities all on a rowe:
Who thus can doo by his Physicke is like to thrive.


We have an Heauen yncorruptible of the Quintessence,
Ornate with Elements, Signes, Planetts, and Starrs bright,
Which moisteth our Erthe by Suttile influence:
And owt thereof a Secrete Sulphure hid from sight,
It fetteth by vertue of his attractive might;
Like as the Bee fetcheth Hony out of the Flowre
Which thing can doo none other Erthly wight;
Therefore to God only be glory and honour.


And like as Yse to Water doth relente,
Whereof congealed it was by violence of greate Cold,
Whence Phebus it smiteth with his Heate influent:
Right so to Water mynerall, reduced is our Gold,
(As writeth playnly Albert, Raymond, and Arnold)
With heate and moisture by craft occasionate,
With congelation of the Spyrite, Lo! now have I told
Howe our materialls togeather must be proportionate.


Att the Dyers craft ye may lerne this Science,
Beholding with Water how they decoctions make
Uppon theyr Woad and Maddre easyly and with patience,
Till the Tinctures appeare which the Cloath doth take
Therein so fixed that they wyll never forsake
The Cloth for washing after they joyned be;
Right so our Tinctures with Water of our Lake
We draw by boyling with Ashes of Hermes tree.



Which Tinctures when they by craft are made parfite,
So dieth Mettalls with Colours evermore permanent,
After the qualitie of the Medycine Red or White;
That never away by eny Fire, will be brente:
To this Example, if you take good tent
Unto your purpose the rather shall ye wynne,
And see your Fire be easy and not fervent;
Where Nature did leave off, what tyme look ye begynn.


First Calcine, and after that Putrefye,
Dyssolve, Dystill, Sublyme, Descende, and Fyxe,
With Aquavite oft times, both wash and drie,
And make a marriage the Body and Spirit betwixt;
Which thus togeather naturally if ye can myxe,
In losinge the Body the Water shall congealed bee,
Then shall the Body dy utterly of the Flixe,
Bleeding and chaunging Colours as ye shall see.


The third daye againe to Life he shall uprise,
And devour Byrds, and Beasts of the Wildernes,
Crowes, Popingayes, Pyes, Pekocks, and Mavies;
The Phenix, the Egle whyte, the Griffon of fearfulnes,
The Greene Lyon and the Red Dragon he shall destres;
The white Dragon also, the Antlope, Unicorne Panther,
With other Byrds, and Beasts both more and lesse;
The Basiliske also which allmost eche one doth feare.


In Bus and Nubi he shall arise and ascend
Up to the Moone, and sith up to the Sonne,
Through the Ocean Sea, which round is without end:
Only Shypped within a little glasen Tonne,
When he commeth thither, then is the Maistrie Wonne:
About which Iourney greate good shall ye not spend,
And yet ye shall be glad that ever it was begonne;
Patiently if ye liste to your worke attend.



For then both Body and Spirit also both Oyle and Water,
Sowle and Tincture one thing both White and Red,
After Colours variable it conteyneth what so men clatter;
Which also called is when he hath once bene Dedd:
And is revived our Marchasite, our Magnete, and our Lead,
Our Sulphure, our Arsenicke, and our true Calcevive:
Our Sonne, our Moone, our Ferment of our Bread:
Our Toade, our Basiliske, our unknowne Body, our Man, our Wife.


Our Body thus naturally by crafte when it is renovate
Of the first ordre is Medicine called in our Philosophy,
Which oftentimes must againe be Spiritualizate:
The rounde Whele turning of our foresaid Astronomy:
And so to the Elixir of Spirites must ye come, for why
Till the same of the fixed by the same of the flier be overâˆ£gone
Elixir of Bodyes named it is only;
And this secrete poynt truly deceaveth many one.


This naturall processe by helpe of craft thus consummate
Dissolveth the Elixir spirituall in our unctuous Humiditie;
Then in Balneo of Mary togeather let them be Circulat,
Like new Hony or Oyle till they perfectly thicked be,
Then will that Medicine heale all manner Infirmitie,
And turne all Mettalls to Sonne & Moone most perfectly:
Thus shall ye have both greate Elixir, and Aurum Potabile,
By the grace and will of God, to whom be lawd eternally.
