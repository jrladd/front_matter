SIR,
J Have been informed of your zeal and forwardnesse in advancing Learning and Truth, two com∣mendable vertues, for a man of your merit and profession. And meeting with a subject composed by a French Authour, I present the Translation to your favourable acceptance: It is of forraign birth, though swadled up in an English habit: It hath done much good abroad, and I am confident it will do the like here, if supported with your appro∣bation: It had not seen the Presse here, had I not been assured of the candor and integrity of the Authour. I repose confidence of acceptation, because the Trans∣lator hath been of your long acquaintance, and was lately sensible of your propensity and assistance, when he came in your way: If this may find grace with you, you will engage him to make further inquisition into this most sacred and secret mystery, and to rest,
SIR,
