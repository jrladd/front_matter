MY LORD,
WHat hath introduced the Custom, I cannot tell, whether the extraordi∣nary Favour and Indulgence that Drammatique Poetry hath found amongst persons of the greatest Wit and Honour; or the over-much Confi∣dence of those of our Scribling Tribe, who are willing to assume to our selves the utmost liberty any will give us, or we can with any modesty pretend to; But so it is, that of late, nothing of this kind, though never so in∣considerable, appears in Publique, without some Great and Illustrious Name fixt before it; like a Gigantique Statue at the Portal of

some trirling Building; Whether they design by it, that the mighty Name to whom their little Follies are consecrated, should like the Re∣liques of Saints, work Miracles on the unbelie∣ving Critiques of our Age, make 'um distrust their own understandings, and have an Impli∣cite Faith in every little Priest of Apollo, I cannot resolve; But since it is grown a Cu∣stome, I shall not be so much a Fanatick as not to conform to it; or rather shall approve my self one, in Conforming to a Custome against my Judgement, for interest sake; None of my Fraternity ever having more occasion to creep under the shelter of some Noble Patronage than my self. For, first, (my Lord) this unworthy Poem, which I humbly prostrate here at your Lordships feet, was the Off-spring of many con∣fused, raw, indigested and Immature thoughts, pen'd in a crow'd and hurry of business and tra∣vel; interrupted and disorder'd by many im∣portunate, not to say insolent affairs, of a quite different nature; and lastly, the first-born of this kind that my thoughts ever laboured with to perfection. And though I will not under∣take

here to reflect any thing upon Elder Bro∣thers, whose usual misfortune is (if the observa∣tion of some be true) not to inherit all the Wit, as well as all the Estate, but leave that as a thread-bare portion to the Cadels; yet I will be bold to affirm it true in these matters; and I think the experience of all that ever attempted any thing in this kind will second me. The first∣born of some most Florid, and after most suc∣cessful wits, having been so rude and unshapen, as that they have been kept like witless Elder Brothers, out of company, for fear of shaming their Parents. And though others have been more fortunate in their early Productions, yet few but have had those Slips from their Prune, which their riper thoughts either were, or at least had reason to be ashamed of. And now (my Lord) I have told you the faults of this Play, give me leave also to tell you the misfor∣tunes of it (for those two commonly go toge∣ther.) It had the misfortune to be brought in∣to the world in a time, when the Dog-star was near his Reign, and my Judges sat in a hot Bath, rather than a Theatre, and were doubly

persecuted, by the heat of the weather, and the impertinence of the Poet; and which was the worst mishap; when the most candid, as well as the most Illustrious Judges (I mean the Court) were absent, and (excepting the presence of some Great and Noble persons) this unhappy Poem left (for the most part) to the mercy of a common Audience; in which unguarded con∣dition it might well expect to receive some wounds, and so it did; though much fewer than either I expected, yet such, as it deserved; whe∣ther it will survive or no, I know not, nor am con∣cerned at; if it will not, then it gives me good oc∣casion to Apologize for this Dedcaition, and to tell your Lordship, that it receiving its first Life and Being in the World from your Lordships favour, and now dying in the corporeal part of it, (I mean the action) the Spiritual and Survi∣ving part of it, ought like its Parent the Soul, to return to him that gave it. And if I may have leave from our rigid Religionists, to prosecute the Metaphor, as in that abstracted State, the Soul is infinitely more happy han in any it could attain to whilst immersed in flesh & blood; so (my Lord) to have any the least residence in

your Lordships thoughts, will be a state of more felicity and honour, than any this Poem, whilst embodied in action, could arrive to by the pri∣vate or general Applause of the Wits of the World. But now I am fallen upon the consi∣deration of your Lordship, I am plunged me∣thinks into a vast Ocean, where I have nothing to determinate my sight, but a bright and Serene Sky full of light, at a vast distance from me, and as vast a height above me, and no shore but that from whence I came, and to which I must retire again, to take a safe and plea∣sant prospect of that which I can neither fathom, nor describe. It is indeed the common pra∣ctice of Dedications, to stuff their Epistles full of Panegyricks, not perhaps so much to describe their Patrons, who sometimes are as obscure as themselves, as to shew their own skill in writing Characters and Essayes: But the case is not the same with me; and what may be tole∣rable enough with them, would be absurd in me; and I should fall into the impertinence of those that would write large Encomiums on the Sun, who certainly commends himself to us by his own light and influence, much better than any man can do by his wit. Not so say any thing

(my Lord) of the Souldier, and Statesman in you, which have rendred you both Known and Famous to all the valiant and politique part of Mankind; that of your Poetry is a large Theme, in which perhaps I could expatiate with more success than on any of the former; yet I shall not dare to do it for want of Art; and if I could take your Lordships heighth, I should but disco∣ver the vast distance I am scituate in from so bright an Orb; as Navigators that take the heighth of the Sun, only to find what Degree of Latitude themselves are in. If there be any part of the World so obscure as not to have heard your Lordships Fame in that, as well as o∣ther respects, I shall refer them to a Character of your Lordship; not to the praises and applauses of the world in general, nor the Panegyricks of lesser Pens, which have alwayes waited on the Tryumphs of yours, as the common Souldiers in the Roman Tryumphs did on their Generals; but to the incomparable issues of your own thoughts, wherein they will see not only a Cha∣racter of your Lordship, but of the present im∣prov'd Genius of England, which by the assi∣stance of your Lordship, and many Sublime Wits in other Arts, begins to be as famous in

Arts, as formerly it was in Arms; witnesse those new Academies and Societies Erected a∣mongstus for Philosophical Commerce, and the improvement of Language, Wit, and Arts; Com∣modities which Forreigne Vertuosoes would have engrossed to themselves, and till of late de∣nyed to be the native growth of this (now in all respects) most happy, and most fertile Island. It is from your Lordships Pen, that Solyman may be truly stiled Magnificent, and you have made him succeed to the Civility and Gallantry of the Greeks, as well as to their Empire; nor was Mu¦stapha ever so much the hopes of his Barba∣rous Nation, as in his Image and the generous Character you have given him, he is the delight of England, who weep the Fate, not of Musta∣pha, but of Murder'd Vertue. And indeed what Pen but your Lordships could have refined and softned a Story so Barbarous, and made a peo∣ple so remote from Friendship, Honour, and Re∣ligion, walk disguised in the Highest Characters of them all? It is your Lordships Pen that hath assisted Henry the fifth in a second conquest of France, and in the noblest Characters of Va∣lour, Love, and Friendship, hath made the English Wit and Language as tryumphant as

their Arms: nor could a story acted with so much glory and success, be attempted by any Pen beneath your Lordship's. In fine, it is your Lord∣ship that hath Charmed up the Ghosts of ma∣ny Noble Heroes, who otherwise would have lain unlamented in their Tombs; And they have walked on the Stage in Brighter Shapes than ever they lived, and have been conducted to their Fates, with more sorrow of the Specta∣tors, then perhaps they had when they dyed. And all this your Lordship hath done, not in the pleasure of Shade, Ease, and Retirement, and with the Advantages and Assistances that meaner Spirits are forced to make use of for their Compositions; but they are only the Sallyes of your Pen, and that during the uneasie intervals which pain sometimes borrows from State Affairs; and what a fit of the Gout snatches from the use and benefit, your Lordship takes care to employ to the delight and pleasure of the World; and if your Lordship can do all this, upon the rack of pain, and with some glances of your thoughts, whil'st the rest like scattered Rayes of Light, are dispersed on various Ob∣jects; what would you do with all the Freedom and Ease of other men, and with the united

force of your Soul? But I am sinking again out of my depth, and must retreat once more to that shore from whence I am insensibly wandred; I mean (my Lord) to the consideration of my self, and of this worthless Present which I make to your Lordship: Which (my Lord) I cannot but look with much contempt upon, as being conscious to my self, in what hast and confusion it was composed, and of what ex-tempo∣re thoughts the greatest part of it consists: Nor should I have presumed to have usher'd it into the world, under so great a Patronage, had not I first obtained your leave. And now I hope your Lordship, that at the hearing of it whil'st it was in loose sheets, was pleased to forgive the faults of the Poem, will now in this address pardon those of the Author, whose chief de∣sign is not to gain the name of Poet, Author, Wit, or Critick, but that of
Octo. 4. 1671.
My Lord,
