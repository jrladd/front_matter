WHat I, and only I, these Papers see?
And that by accident, it shall not be.
I'le hazard wrath, whose rise is modesty,
And like Samaria's Lepers, Roast-meat cry;
For though I cannot dish it out in Print,
Yet I affirm, there's Fat and Marrow in't.
Apples of Gold in silver pictures too,
Well season'd food for souls both old and new.


Me thinks (dear Sir) you should not grudge nor spare
To feast a land upon your Fast-day fare.
Pity to see a Land all in a maze,
Fool'd into Boggs, and Fens, by fire Flies blaze.
Hang out thy Light, open and press thy Text,
And all our Labyrinths are unperplext.
Teach us our Conversation how to order,
That we may camp within Salvations border.


Riches and Garments, Gold and silver too,
Unus'd, corrupt, moth-eat, and canker do;
Their price and use are one: Pray, Sir, proâˆ£duce
Your Treasure, put it out to Publike use.
Nature, her richest hoard in secret put,
So Golden Mines came troden under foot;
Whilst every Creature that is worth an eye,
Keeps gazing on the spangles of the Sky.


Nor thine, nor thy Books credit, would I raise,
Within the gates thine own works thee shall praise
Or suffer for't: For good Books now adayes
Like virtue practice need, but no man's praise.
Thanks for the sight, and if the world do'nt see't,
But what I saw, prove it's own winding sheet
When thou hast lock't it up, write on thy Chest
Here lyes a Phoenix, dead in's spicy nest.


Here lyes Religion, reformations Path,
The nearest way that God's Salvation hath,
Zeal without wild-fire, pious Politicks.
Sure conduct void of Phoetontick tricks,
Rain thunderless, doctrine like heaven-dropt dews
The Sun will suck it up, if Earth refuse.
