I Beg leave, Gentlemen, to prefix your Names to this little Treatise about Moral Duties, which the wise Author of it thought fit to recommend to his own Son, and which has usually been look'd upon as one of the per∣fectest and compleatest in its kind. It has alter'd its Dress indeed since it came under my Hands, and I am afraid, may-have suffer'd very much by the Alteration: however, as to the Body and more substantial Parts of it, I hope 'tis still the same, and worthy of that Opinion, which the Author himself had of it, That 'twas a very good Present, if made such Use of, as the Nature and Importance of its Argument requir'd. 'Twas at first design'd for a Person in your Circumstances, a Student in an U∣niversity, a young Gentleman of great Hopes, one from whom his Country did expect to receive Be∣nefit, and his Friends no small Comfort and Sa∣tisfaction: I thought I could not do better there∣fore, after once I had resolv'd to Translate it into English, than Dedicate it to You, who have so good

a Title to it, as well upon this as upon some other Accounts. The Honour and Happiness I have in being appointed the Director of your Studies, the many Favours and Obligations I have receiv'd up∣on that account, together with a great many other Inducements arising from so close and endearing a Relation, almost forc'd me to make this publick Acknowledgment. And I confess I was desirous my self of doing it, both that it might serve for a Testimony of that Value and Esteem which I have for you; and that I might oblige you by it, in some measure, to read these Precepts, when you are gone from under my Care, which most People in those Circumstances are but too ready to forget. You will find here all the more useful Parts of Virtue so clearly set before you; the Excellence and Im∣portance of it so judiciously enlarg'd upon; the Necessity of it toward the procuring a Reputation, toward the meeting with Encouragement and Suc∣cess in our Undertakings: and, in a word, toward the obtaining any tolerable degree of Happiness, in whatever State of Life, so abundantly made out; that I hardly know of any thing (relating to meer Morality) that could more fitly be recom∣mended to Persons in Your Circumstances, by one in Mine, than this excellent Treatise. 'Tis true you have read it in its Original Language, and my Request to you is, that you would continue to do so; the Design of this Translation being not to exclude, but to assist the Latin: which if it may but do in any tolerable manner, so as to help toward the Understanding of such excellent Rules of Living, I have obtain'd my End.
Such as it is, Gentlemen, I heartily present it to you; wishing that it may be in some measure ser∣viceable

to those Ends, for which it was at first design'd; and that all, but especially Men of E∣state and Fortune, and such as are likely to make some Figure in the World, would be persuaded to learn ev'n from an Heathen Writer, That there is no true Profit or Advantage, no solid Reputation or Honour, and, in short, no real Happiness any where to be found, except in the Practice of Vir∣tue and Honesty. I am,
GENTLEMEN,
