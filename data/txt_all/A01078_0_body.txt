Right Honorable,
WHen Paul and Barnabas did preach the word of God at Antioch,
Act. 13.14 the people seemed to giue such attendance vnto their words of exhortation,  that they de∣sired to heare the same the
next Sabboath day. When I preached this Sermon at Court, the auditors did seeme to giue such attention vnto what was spoken, (although vnworthy of their meanest attention) that they did ear∣nestly desire to see in writing what that day they had heard by preaching, Visus e∣nim est perfectior sensus: so that my weake labours, through Gods blessing, passed along the Court, like plaine honestie, with euery mans good leaue and liking: and if this place had beene the furthest period,  had beene eased of some fu∣ture paines. But then it plea∣sed
some, Honorable and worthy friends, to impose vpon mee this second view: and surely pruritus scribendi, the disease of our age, had almost hin∣dered me; for I know litera scripta manet, and is more sub∣iect to censure, then quod au∣ribus auditur: for which cause I did not at the first yeelde. Yet at last, vpon more seri∣ous deliberation, (least I should haue encurred the breach of loue of some wor∣thy and much respected friends: as also the censorious conceit of some supercilious Stoickes:) I resolued prodere in vulgus, to lye Noah-like, in the Tent
doore, that euery scoffing Cham may smile at my na∣kednesse: And because that a seruant of meane birth and qualitie is many times pre∣ferred aboue his worth, for his Lord and Masters sake; I haue therefore made choise of your Honorable Patronage, being at that time when it was deliuered, one of my most Noble Auditors. Vti∣nam esset possibile me vnum esse ex principibus offerre geni∣mas ad ornamentum Pontificis; sed quia haec supra me sunt, cer∣te vel pilos caprarum habere merear in Tabernaculo Dei, as Origen elegantly; I wish that
I could speak any thing wor∣thy of this Text, or your Honours Dedication. A day it is, and that a great one, when not onely all criminall cau∣ses will be heard, as in the Court of the Kings Bench; as also euery mans case shall be adiudged, as at the Com∣mon-pleas barre: but when, and where the iust Iudge of all the world, will accor∣ding to the euidence of eue∣ry mans conscience, distri∣bute righteous Iudgement; and therefore more properly I call it The great day of Chan∣cery: plaine it is, that the ru∣dest and most Ignorant, may
vnderstand it: yet (as I thinke) profitable, that the most wise and learned may reape some instruction by it: the best Remembrancer that Iudges can haue about them, is to remember the day of Iudgement; Summus enim iu∣dex iudicata reiudicabit: and vnto whom much is giuen, of him much shall bee re∣quired in that day: where∣fore I beseech the Lord of heauen and earth, to assist your Honour with his grace and holy Spirit, that you may Honourably long con∣tinue, as hitherto a good Iu∣sticiar, in that place where∣unto
you are worthily called, to his glory, and your eter∣nall comfort, that you may stand boldly before the Tri∣bunall in that day. Amen.
