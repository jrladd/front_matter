MY LORD,
IT is by Your Lordship's Command (for such any signification of Your Desire shall always be to me) that this Discourse is made thus Publick; and the Kindness that you have shewed to the Au∣thor, makes it Duty in him to lay it with all Hu∣mility and Thankfulness at your Feet.
I did not think that there was any thing in it, to recommend it to such a kind Acceptance, unless Ho∣nesty and Plain-dealing come in Reputation again.
But when I saw Your Lordship's Thoughts se¦conded by the Worthy Gentlemen upon the Bench, and Grand Jury too, I confess I was affected, not so much with the favour shew'd to my self (God knows)
 as with the joyful hope, that the true Spirit and Temper of Religion breathed in those Persons, who by the Influence they have upon, as well as Interest in their Country, may happily propagate it to others below them.
May God Almighty verifie the Presage, and in∣spire them with Zeal in this Noble Design. May that Heavenly Dew, which now I begin to hope is fallen upon the top of Hermon, refresh not only the immediate Declensions, but at last Water the very Fields of Zion. And may Your Lordship, and all those Worthy Persons, rejoice in those. Bles∣sings which God hath promised to give there to all good Men now, and in those greater Portions of Bliss that he hath provided for such hereafter. This is, and shall be the daily Prayer of,
My LORD,
