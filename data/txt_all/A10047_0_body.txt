ROyall Master: Your gra∣cious aspect to my poore endeuors, often presented in your religious presence, hath encouraged mee to this Dedication of my last seruice to your blessed Father; and first, to your Maiestie: for the whole world hath no greater Patronage of goodnesse, then your selfe: and our daily bread, and hourely breath serueth vs to be∣seech the Almightie, that you long be the gracious Patrone and Patterne of Religion.
That I presume to offer it vnto your Maiestie, in this time of our
iust cause of ioy, wherein the Lillies and Roses, the Oliue and Vine, are conioyned; I excuse it by the Pattern I see in Mount Thabor, wherein our blessed Sauiour, when he shewed his Disciples a glympse of his glory in his Transfiguration; hee seasoned their Soules, rapt vp in those vnspeak∣able ioyes with the remembrance of his Passion: What this is, is like Ben∣iamin, the birth of sorrow, and of so much sorrow to me, as had almost se∣questred my Soule from my Body. The hand of Heauen that hath wi∣ped away our teares, keepe vs long and long from such occasion of tears, and Crowne your Royall Person, and Gracious Queene, with the bles∣sings of Goodnesse; which is the con∣tinuall Prayer
