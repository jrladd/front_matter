THe Muse, who from your Influence tooke her Birth,
First wandred through the many-peopled Earth;
Next sung the Change of Things; disclos'd th' Vnknown:
Then to a nobler Shape transform'd her Owne;
Fetch'd from Engaddi, Spice; from Iury, Balme;
And bound her browes with Idumaean Palme:
Now Old, hath her last Voyage made; and brought
To Royall Harbor this her Sacred Fraught:
VVho to her King bequeathes the VVealth of Kings;
And dying, her owne Epicedium sings.
