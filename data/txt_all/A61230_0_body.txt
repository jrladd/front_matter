WHereas I do only Reprove Trangression, and Exhort people to come a∣gain into the way of God's Commandments. I do set his Laws before Mankind, and I do Publish his Eetrnal Truth. I do nothing more beyond or besides this. Which again I do not out of mine own head, but only from the Statute-Book of the Lord God. If Ye think that I deserve to be Im∣prisoned for this Doing, and ye will be instrumental to Confine me, God will judge that ye and the other People do deserve Damnation, for not o∣beying those his Laws and Commandments, which from out of the same Book of Scriptures I have set before ye and them. And when your Breath is out of your Nostrils, and your Souls are departed from your Bodies, ye will receive yet greater Condemnation, and be beaten with more stripes for your thus doing unto me his Creature, who was sent and employed by him in the Ministration of his Word and Truth. So Warneth and Witnesseth.
