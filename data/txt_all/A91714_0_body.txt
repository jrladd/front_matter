SIR:
HAving cast my eye into the world, to observe the occurren∣ces, and take notice of the Controversies of the time, there fell into my hands some of your writings, disputing the case of Presbyterie and Independency, which having perused with consideration, I received much satisfaction, though I met with many cavils fallen from the pens of severall Wri∣ters of differing spirits, seeking to destroy the fruit of your endevours: But I found none, that were of sufficient strength to overthrow those positive truths by you asserted: In particular, there came to my hand a Pamphlet of somewhat a later edition than the former, full of bitter invectives, against the Truth and all government, but what private phancy shall exalt. And this under the hand of one John Lilburne, in an Episto∣lary way, directed to your selfe: At which being fil'd with indignation, to see the strangenesse of that spirit that wrought in its endictment, and is now work∣ing in the world (excellently set forth by Jude in his Epistle, 19. verse, Makers of Sects, , having not the Spirit) clearly demonstrating what they would do, might they prevaile for that liberty, so much contended for. I was compelled, after much striving within my self, to review what he had done, and to give in my judgement for the benefit of the Church of God, which I have finished by way of Epistle, I recommend to your Patronage, which if I obtain, I having the happinesse I sought after, who am not my own, but the Truths and yours in all

From my Study this 27. of January 1644.

SIR:
That I have not declared my self unto you, I hope you will dispense with, many reasons have induced me to silence herein; hereafter, if God will, I shall take occasion to tender my service, and acknowledge my en∣gagement, and not mine alone, but the engagement of the whole Church of God for your faithfull endevours.
Fare you well.
