YOu haue bound me so infi∣nitely vnto you (deare Brother and Sister) that I cannot (for shame) but make some meanes to pay part of the debt: That which I owe to your exceeding kindnesse towardes mee is very great: yet behold (pre∣suming you will beare with my good will, at least with my abilitie) I lay downe no more but this, which is very little: Such portion of Witte as it is, I freely bestow vpon you. This infant of my Braine was begot and deliuered vnder your owne roofe; it is therefore fittest there to be nurst vp: and for that purpose I sende it to you both. My louing Sister hath been the mother of seuen Children, and therefore knowes the better how to
 handle this: I pray be neither of you cruell to it, for your good worde, or good looke, makes it prosper; a frowne kils it. I giue you many thankes for my entertainement at your house at Hawleland, where (at your cost) I spent almost a yeere, and at mine idle howers, drew this Picture of Poesie. If the cullours be ill layde on, beare with them, for that I am but newly bound to the trade: yet not bound neither; for if you like not my workmanship, I will for euer giue it ouer. Thus hoping you will receiue this poore Gift with as free a hand as I send it, I commende you to God. Hawleland this. 18. of October. 1604.
