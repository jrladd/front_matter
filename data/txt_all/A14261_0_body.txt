THese Sermons both in their preaching & printing acknow∣ledge thēselves yours. For your sakes they were first made, and it is not for their owne they are now made common. I was put upon
two evils, either to print that which was bad, or else by transcribing suf∣fer it to be made worse. I have cho∣sen the lesse, and God may bring good out of it. Discourses of this na∣ture are few, yet great need have Sea-men of them, debarred for the most part from the sweet comforts, and many helpes which our Church at home affordeth; Hee that consi∣ders the one will not condemne these Sermons for Wast: and hee that is sensible of the other will not aske to what purpose are they? Yet though others should cast dead flyes into this ointment, my hope is you
will approve it for bonum opus, and afford it your Patronage. And so I commit it to you, and you to the protection of him that is able to keepe you, God blessed for evermore.
