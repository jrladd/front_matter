KIng Salomon, one of wisdomes offspring, (Right Reverend Fa∣ther) hath said, All rivers goe into the Sea. Some thinke they doe it to doe their homage, and pay tribute to that place, frō whence they receiued their beginning. May this little Ser∣mon imitate those rivers, it is all it careth for. It had beginning from your Lordship, when the fourth time you worthily bore the highest office in our Vniversitie. For your request (even then a commaund to me) gaue it being. It now returns as homager and tributarie to your Lordship, and is glad that it seeth the light through your favora∣ble countenance. God almightie enlarge his graces vpon your Lordship, and fill you with his
 strength, that the Church of Christ here long en∣ioying you, may reioice to see the pride of many her enimies through you abated. From my study in Corpus Christi College. Septemb. 9. 1611.
