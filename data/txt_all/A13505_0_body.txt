YEt not to euery Reader, doe I write,
But onely vnto such as can Read right:
And with vnpartiall censures, can declare,
As they find things▪ to iudge them as they are.
For in this age of Crittickes, are such store,
That of a B. will make a Battledore.
Swallow downe Camells, & at Gnatts will straine,
Make Mountaines of small Molehills, & againe
Extenuat faults, or else faults amplifie,
According as their carping censures fly.
Such are within the Motto of I haue,
But though the gallant Gulls, be ne're so braue:
And in their owne esteeme are deemed wise,

I haue a mind, their follies to dispise.
There are some few that wil their iudgement season▪
With mature vnderstanding, and with reason:
And call a spade a spade, a Sichophant,
A flattring Knaue, and those are thse I want.
For those that seeme to reade, and scarce can spell,
Who neiher point nor keepe their peiods well:
Who doe a mans inuention so be martyr▪
So hanging, drawing, and so cut and quarter,
Making good lines contemptible threed bare,
To keepe my booke from such as those I care.
