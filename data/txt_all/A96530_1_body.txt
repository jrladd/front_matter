SIR,
THese Ntes belong unto your Worship by a mani∣fold right. Indeed they can of right belong so properly to none as to your Worship. For First it was by your command that this Sermon was composed of them, for the Pulpit. And then by your command it was, that this Sermon of them was thus disposed into a Pamphlet. It troubled me very much to heare my selfe so entreated as I was, to Pen this Sermon for your perusall; But it troubled me farre more to see my selfe enforced as I have beene, to request it back againe to send it to the Presse. You cannot but remember, that when you did so heartily desire my Notes, I did as humbly as I could de∣sire that they might never be made publick. I onely thought upon the Pulpit in my studying for them; And I thought but onely of your private perusall in transcribing of them. I would they might have rested in your hands perpetually. But they are even enforced thus to come abroad, and appeare in publick, and your Worship knows from whence the violence was offered to them.

I must follow after the Sermon, as the Sermon doesQui non diligit fratrem, manet in morte. 1 Johan. 2. Nemo adultus potest salvari, fine Charitate in Deum, & proxi∣mum. Zanch. Miscellaneo∣rum lib. 2. follow after the Text; And so must follow after Charity to such as have enforced me to doe what I had no minde to. I know it was the love of Charity in your Worship, that caused you to like the Matter of this Sermon, when it was preached; And that it was the Charity of your love unto the Preacher, that perswaded you to accept the Manner of it, as it was penned. And I hope that Charity will never faile you towards,Charitas nun∣quam excidit. 1 Cor. 13. 8.
Sir,
