Right Honorable,
NOne can challenge so much right in these Me∣ditations, as your Lordship, vnder whose happy shade they receiued their first conception: Vn∣der this Juniper of yours, haue J (not driuen by force, but drawne by pleasure) slept thus long, sweetly, safely; and haue receiued these Angelicall touches: How iustly may your Lordship claime the fruits of your owne fauours? Your carefull studies in the Booke of God, are fit to bee exemplary; which haue so enriched you, that your Teacher shall gaine. In this reach of diuine thoughts, you shall see Benhadads insolence taken downe by Ahabs victory, an humble (though Idolatrous) Israelite carying it from an insulting Pagan: You shall see in Ahab the impotent passions of greatnesse; in Naboth, bleeding honestie; in Iezebel bloody hypocrisie, cruell craft; plotting from hell, pretending from heauen: You shall see the wofull successe of an vniust mercy; Ahab forfaiting what hee gaue, killed by him, whom hee should haue killed: You shall see resolute Michaiah
 opposing the mercenarie Synode of Prophets, a beaten victor, an imprisoned freeman: You shall see Ahaziah falling through his grate; Elijah climbing vp his Mount, mounting vp to his glo∣ry; fetching fire from Heauen, fetcht by a fiery charet to hea∣uen. Elisha the heire of his mantle, of his spirit, no lesse mar∣uellous in his beneficences, in his reuenges. What doe J foretell all? Me thinkes J feele my selfe now too like an Italian host, thus to meet your Lordship on the way, and to promise before∣hand your fare, and intertainment: Let it please your Lordship rather to see and allow your cheere: Jndeed the feast is Gods, and not mine, wherein store striues with delicacie: Jf my coo∣kerie hurt it not, it is enough: Through your hands I commend it to the world, as I doe your Lordship, and my honorable good Ladie, to the gracious protection of the Almightie, iustly vowing my selfe
