MY LORD,
HAving your Lordship's Commands for the Pub∣lication of these following Discourses, I have reason to hope my Readers will prove candid and favourable in their Censures, since they cannot but pay the greatest Deference to the Judgment of a Prelate, whom all the Learned, both at home and abroad, do Unanimously rank amongst the Greatest Divines, that this, or former Ages can glory in. But that I may not too much lessen that Esteem, which the Judicious part of Mankind, at least, do justly bear to your Lordship, as the nicest Judge in Things of this Nature, by Proclaiming to the World that Encouragement you have given to a Work, which no doubt will be found very defective: I am apt to believe, and am forward to own it, that it might be more your Approbation of the Design, than the Goodness
 of the Performance, that has made your Lordship so exceedingly Kind to it, and its Author. And indeed if ever there were a Necessity of attempting any thing to promote Catechetical Instruction, there is now too sad an Occasion for it.
Some Years since we thought it sufficiently hard upon us, that we were put to the trouble of Defend∣ing a Church, so excellently Constituted as ours is, by susteining those slight Skirmishes made only upon its Outworks; namely, against its Rites and Ceremonies (Solemnities I would rather call 'em) so wisely order'd for the more grave and solemn Administration of Di∣vine Worship, and for the better Edification of the Souls of Men. But alas, the Enemy has now enter'd through our Breaches into the very Heart of our City (as St. Austin calls the Church of God.) And as if there were an Universal Conspiracy made at this time against it, All the Grand and Fundamental Articles, both of Natural and Revealed Religion, are now either most furiously Storm'd by Atheists, Deists, and So∣cinians on the one hand, or secretly and dangerously un∣dermined by Enthusiasts and Antinomians on the other. And if the next Generation should grow worse in its Principles and Morals than the present, what Venge∣ance from Heaven, even to the removing of our Candle∣stick, may we not fear? But especially, what Indig∣nation from God may not we of the Clergy dread, should we suffer the Youth of our Nation to go abroad into the World, without having first given 'em those Religious Impressions by good Principles, as will guard 'em from the Danger thereof; and, especially, without having first prepossess'd the Minds of such, with a deep Tincture of Divine Knowledge, as are likely t be the Leading Men in their Countries; and yet by
 a fatal Mistake in Education, are generally brought up in those Undisciplin'd Societies, amongst whom the Oracles of false and pretended Reason are more uni∣versally Read, and more highly Applauded, than the Lively Oracles of Divine Revelation.
I know how deeply sensible your Lordship is of the growing Infidelity and Heterodoxy of this Age; and how much it is your Opinion, that a constant Course of Catechizing our Youth in the Fundamental Prin∣ciples of Christianity, is the only Means that can ef∣fectually obviate and cure those Great and Prevailing Evils. And if what I have here offered to the Pub∣lick, may be at all Serviceable to any of my Brethren, in affording some useful Materials for their own Composures of this kind, and in assisting any of 'em in their Method, I have my End, and shall therein in some measure answer, I presume, your Lordship's Design; who, out of a pious Zeal to have this Work of Catechizing universally set forwards by every In∣dividual Minister in your Diocess, would have the way so plain'd, that we might all proceed therein without Interruption.
And sure where the Authoritative Injunctions of so Great a Father and Governour of our Church, are join'd with such an unparallel'd Industry in the dis∣charge of all the most important and difficult Duties of the Episcopal Care, it is impossible for us, who are under the Influence of your Power and Example, to be Remiss in that which is the very principal part of Ministerial Instruction incumbent upon us. For if we no sooner saw your Lordship entring upon that Diocess, to which you were Translated so Happily to us (though so Disadvantageously to your own Fortunes) but we saw you apply your self with the utmost Vigour to the
 Business of it, in Visiting not only your Clergy, but Ca∣thedral, Schools, and Hospitals. If in your Lordship's primary Visitation we heard such a Learned Scriptural Proof of the JUS DIVINUM of the THREE DISTINCT ORDERS, (and what Evidence of that Nature is not to be expected from One so Mighty in the Holy Scriptures) as cannot but Silence all Ad∣versaries, and all the Learned of our Nation would be glad to see made publick: If we also saw at the same time that Venerable Ordinance of Confirmation (even amongst those vast Crouds that came to it, and with so great a Fatigue to your self) Administer'd with a particular Application of the Stipulatory part, to every Individual Person, that was duly attested to be sufficiently Qualified; and with that Order, Gra∣vity, and Solemnity, which raised in all, who were present, that Value for it, which is due to it: If a∣gainst every EMBER we see those wise Precautions used, with Reference to the Candidates for Holy Or∣ders, as would effectually prevent the Admission of Persons unworthy, upon the account of any Immo∣rality, or will wholly lay the Guilt at the Doors of those who are backward to Inform their Church-Go∣vernors of the Miscarriages they know, in order to their Correction and Remedy; and yet are most apt to raise their Outcries against the Scandals of the Clergy: And if also in the Probation of those who are permitted to stand Candidates, there is constant∣ly such a Treasury of Sacred Learning open'd to 'em in your Explications of Holy Writ, as renders those Examinations one of the most learned and useful Theological Exercises that this Age does know; and is alone sufficient to render those in a good measure Qualified with Scriptural Knowledge, who come not
 thereto altogether prepar'd before-hand. And indeed, if agreeably to your Lordship's so useful Examina∣tions, those who have the Happiness to be Conversant with you in your Studies, do always see you Searching the Scriptures, and do scarcely ever find you without the Holy Bible before you; (though one would think the sacred Page need be no more turn'd over by one, who seems to have it wholly by Heart already, both in our own, and all the Learned Languages.) If farther yet we have seen your Lordship, by a Method equally worthy to be admired and imitated, in so short time, to have got such an exact Knowledge of a numerous Clergy, that from the chiefest Rector to the meanest Curate, our Abilities, Lives, and Ministerial Per∣formances, seem not to be better known to our nearest Neighbours, than to your Self; and our Miscarriages and Neglects of Duty in the remotest Part of your Diocess, may almost as soon escape the Reproaches of our own Consciences, as your Lordship's Notice and Animadversion: If in a word such is your Lordship's Vigilance through all the Parts of a very large Dio∣cess, as is alone sufficient to Confute those Voluminous Libels which were wrote some Years since against DIOCESAN EPISCOPACY, as if an exact Dis∣cipline were not practicable therein: If I say, such an Authority will not awe us, nor such an Example of Pastoral Care will not animate us to discharge, as all the other, so especially such an indispensably necessary a part of our Ministerial Function as Cate∣chizing (particularly at this Juncture) undoubtedly is, this were enough to provoke Heaven to snatch from us the vast Benefit of such a Paternal Govern∣ment: Which Blessing that God may however con∣tinue to this Church, as it is heartily desired by all
 that know your Lordship, (and are good enough them∣selves justly to value the Two best Things in the World, an unparallel'd Degree of Learning, join'd with an equal Measure of the most ardent Piety) so particu∣larly it is the most earnest and devout Prayers to God, of
My LORD,
