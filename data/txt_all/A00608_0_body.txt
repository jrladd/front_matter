Right Honourable:
DVtie becomes disguised, where it wants the sub∣stance of Integrity: and this loses it selfe, when ignorant of expression. Great Personages are of∣ten cloyed (as with the verball expressions, so) with the hypocrisie of those that tender them. But my selfe am become the exception against that common rule; and I dare with as bold a Confidence convict, as slight the
 Opposer. My bowing-heart hath bin alwaies steep'd in desire to present the Pledge of an humble obseruance to your Lordship: But remaining guilty of my weaknesse, here I sue for assistance by a Noble Protection.
The Sermon it selfe is the Defenders of the faith; and though briefe, yet orthodox∣all. If any carpe at it, peraduenture it may proue a Mansenile-apple, (whereof I haue seene diuers in the Indies) that blisters the Tongues of them that taste.
The Noble worth of my deseruing Com∣mander, Sir Thomas Warner, made me a Traueller into the Indies, being thereby the first Preacher vpon Saint Christo∣phers Ilands. And your Lordships vnualu∣ed Goodnesse and Patronage of those Parts, hath now commanded this Sermon to trauell into the Censure of each Peruser: If it suffer by a Martyrdome, yet the Author shall euer appeare
