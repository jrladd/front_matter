My Lord,
COuld I have taken the Confidence to have dis∣puted your Commands, this Discourse would not have needed that Protection, and Favour, which now it humbly begs. Not but that I am well assured, the Doctrines in it are truly Christian, but it is sent forth into an ill natur'd, and Plotting Age, that will not give tolerable entertainment to any Principles but such as invite to Apostacy, and Rebellion. It is not therefore without extream Necessity, that I press to Your Lordship, in this Dedication; the very asserting Primitive Religion, and Christian Loyalty, will need such a Patron. And though it is no Secret to the World, yet I cannot forbear declaring that I

cannot have such a Defender as Your Self, who does so generously practise both those Vertues. I have seen in Your Lordship such Concernment for the Crown, and the Establish'd Religion, that I might presume of Patronage; But I must beseech Your Par∣don too, that I present this, (of which I have so mean an Opinion my self) to a Person for whom of all men, I have the greatest Honour, and from whom I have received the greatest Obligations. But You loved the Subject, and therefore liked the Sermon, no Man ever having better joyned the Christian and the Statesman. And truly (my Lord) I have been entertained with the greatest Delight as well as Ad∣vantage, in Your own Discourses of Loyalty, that it self in You being founded upon Principles truly Noble and Brave; not living upon future Expectances, but serving Your Prince, as You do Your God, by the Engagements of pure Love, and undesigning Vertue: And therefore in all Changes You was al∣ways Your Self, no Change of State making You change Your Party. This is removed as far from Ʋntruth, as it is from Flattery, that You can no more forsake Your King nor Your Religion, that You

can Your Self, being one that values not Your Fortune, nor Your Greatness, above Your Vertues. And as to this, all men that know You will allow the Cha∣racter, so it is my happiness, as well as interest, that I can testifie it by a daily Experience,
having the honour of being
My Lord,
