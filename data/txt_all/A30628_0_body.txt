Madam,
WHat is done in the
following Letters in
Defence of Infants
Baptism, is so justly Your

Ladyships upon so many
Titles, that to disown it by
Dedicating of Them to any
Other, or not to own it
by not Dedicating of Them
to Your Ladyship, would
be as great Injustice, as, but
for your Interest in Them,
to do the last, a Presump∣tion.
The First of Them is a
Second Edition of a For∣mer
sent my Adversary; in
which (as I thought the Re∣turn
he gave, obliged me
to do) I made such Alte∣rations,
Additions, and E∣mendations,

as might illu∣minate
my Principal Argu∣ment;
without engaging me
in Matters Forraign to it.
And to his Rejoynder un∣to
This as so Enlarged, the
Second is a Reply: and those
that follow, are Defences to
Both.
My Argument is found∣ed
on that Covenant of Grace
it pleased God to make with
Abraham, and with his Seed:
In which, as he gave Him∣self,
and all he hath to A∣braham,
and to his Seed; so
he requires (what is most

highly reasonable he should)
that Abraham, and all he
owned, and that Abraham's
Seed, and all they own,
should be His: And that
in Token of being so, both
Abraham himself shou'd keep
the Covenant, by wearing the
Initiating Sign thereof him∣self,
and putting it on all
His, (that was capable of
it) and also, that his Seed
should keep it in like man∣ner.
Certain it is, the Seed
of Abraham is as much ob∣liged
to keep the Covenant
as Abraham himself; [Thou

shalt keep my Covenant there∣fore,
Thou and thy Seed af∣ter
thee in their Generations.]
And I have proved the Be∣lieving
Gentiles to be That
Seed; so that, though the
Gentiles must believe, to be∣come
the Seed of Abraham;
yet, on becoming his Seed,
they come also under the
Obligation to observe the
Covenant, as much as Abra∣ham
himself.
I have also proved, That
the Covenant of Abraham,
is the first Solemn Formal
Covenant of Grace, for E∣ternal

Life and Salvation,
through our Lord Christ,
that, in Account and Rec∣koning
of the Scriptures, it
pleased God to make with
Man; and consequently,
that the First Separate
and Instituted Church, was
then appointed in the Fa∣mily
of Abraham: So that,
from the very Beginning
that it pleased God to Esta∣blish
and Ratifie his Cove∣nant,
and to Constitute and
Frame a Church, as did Or∣n
the Signing of the A∣;
so he did the Singing

of Infants: Therein laying
the Foundations of the
Common-wealth of Israel
in the Membership of Chil∣dren,
as well as in that of
the Parents. God never
Constituted any Formal
Church, until he had made
a Formal Covenant; and
the Sign of the Covenant,
is the Rite of Initiation in∣to
the Church: None comes
into the Latter, but by the
Former; and Baptism is such
a Sign.
I do not say, That Bap∣tism
is come in the Place of

Circumcision; I know too
well the use is made of that
Expression, though in it
self, and as meant, it be most
Innocent and Inoffensive:
But I say, It cannot be de∣nyed,
that as Circumcision
was the Initiating Rite and
Sign before the Coming of
Christ; so (that) Baptism is
after it: And that, Now,
to dedicate and give a Per∣son
to God visibly and so∣lemnly,
is, by that Sign and
Rite to Matriculate him;
that is, to Enter and Initi∣ate
him into the Church.
And now, Madam, Is
not the Baptism of Infants,
in the Notion I have of it,
a thing of High and Spiri∣tual
Nature, and of great
Significancy? When it is
not meerly Baby-sprinkling,
and Sealing to a Blank, as
some do phrase it: But done
in token of our Dedicating
of Them unto God, and in
Evidence and Token that
they are His. All Delivery
and Surrender must pass
with some Formality, some
Rite; and Baptism is that
Formality, that Rite, by

which we Christians do pass
over, and assign our selves,
and all our Children to
God.
The fair Stating and Il∣lustrating
the mentioned
Points, in which I beat a
Path but little trodden, is
mainly the Business of the
Letters, of which I make a
Humble Offering to Your
Ladyship: In writing which,
next to the Zeal and De∣ference
that I ow'd to Truth,
I propounded to my self
no greater Satisfaction, than
the Occasion they would

give me, of gratifying an
Ambition I have ever had
to Publish my self,
Madam,
