T TIme trieth the truth in euery thing,
H How euer man doth blase his mynde:
O Of woorkes, which best may profite bring.
M Men apt to iudge be often blinde.
A As therefore truth in time doth craue:
S So let this booke iust fauour haue.


T Take you my Lorde, and Master than,
V Vnlesse mischaunce mischaunceth me:
S Such homely gift of me your man,
S Since more in court I may not be.
A And let your prayse wonne heretofore,
R Remaine abrode for euermore.


M My seruing you, thus vnderstand,
A And God his helpe, and yours withall,
D Did cause good luck to take mine hande
E Erecting one most like to fall.
M My seruing you I know it was,
E. Enforced this to come to passe.


Since being once at Cambrige taught,
Of Court tenne yeres I made assay.
No musike then was left vnsought,
Such care I had to serue that way.
My ioy gan slacke, then made I chaunge,
Expulsed mirth, for musike straunge.


My musike since hath bene the plough,
Entangled with some care among,
The gaine not great, the paine inough,
Hath made me sing another song,
Which song if well I may auow,
No man I craue to iudge but you.
