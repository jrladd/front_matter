Dearly beloved in the Lord,
BY the special, and I doubt not, by the good hand of Providence it was, and is, that God hath appointed me to bee a Co-labourer in this part of his Vineyard, with your reverend Pastor, who it is that bears the burthen and heat of the day; and I bless God for that encouragement that I have received from you, in respect of your love, and great appearance, whereby God hath put a great opportunity into my hand of doing good, and I hope my labours have not been in vain in the Lord; I do account you my Crown, and my joy, and I have with much comfort and rejoycing preached amongst you; and when I have had occasion sometimes for one Lords Day (though but for one Lords day) to bee absent, I have returned with as much satisfaction to my self, unto the Congregation,
as I have done to see my dearest friends, when I have been a long time from them. Of those several subjects upon which I have preached amongst you, I have judged this that I have now published, most to edification, being plain and practical; for you can, and mine own con∣science doth bear mee witness, that I have not used the enticing words of mens wisdome, but have endeavoured, in some measure, to Preach in the power and demonstration of the Spirit, which I account not only fittest for those which are, as they call them, of the more ignorant sort, but even for those which are learnedest, wisest, and of greatest understanding; for wee are commanded to Preach as the Oracles of God, and Oracles use to bee plain, as to their lan∣guage, though (it may be) profound, as to their sense; and I account it the hardest task of learning, to make the Mysteries of God plain, and that wood to bee fittest for build∣ing, which is least knotty; therefore I desire you would not bee offended, but edified by the plain stile and matter of this Treatise: If by reading of it you bee brought to that which is the title and sum of it, viz. The Power of Godliness, it sufficeth; when one chooseth a Sword, not for ornament, but for use; one looks not so much to the Scabbard, or other
curiosities of it, as to the mettle; and therefore wee rather choose one, whose blade is made of steel, than of gold: The two-edged Sword of Gods Word, if it pierceth, and divideth be∣tween the joynts and the marrow, it doth the work for which wee use it, though it be not sent forth, and made glittering by humane elo∣quence: though I desire in this particular also to avoid mistakes, for though I decry a ga∣rish, yet I commend, and I desire to use a de∣cent dress for Truth to walk abroad in. I re∣member it is said of a young Painter, who was to draw the picture of a fair woman; Pul∣chram non potuit, pinxit divitem, he could not paint her fair, but painted her rich, so that her picture was rather gaudy, than comely and beautiful; and therefore, though I desired you would pardon the plainness of this Treatise and my preaching among you, yet now I do recall that request, accounting it unpardonable, be∣cause it is not a crime; but I can advise you so, that you may commend the Treatise, and in∣deed no other commendation do I desire of it, viz. practise it, and I dare considently say you will commend it, or rather, that you will bless God for the truths and directions that are set down in it: Live those holy books that you read, and you will like them, and doubtless it
is impossible to like holiness, without practi∣sing of it; for when by reproofs, or practical directions, the conscience is awakened, it will bee clamorous, if not obeyed; for if it sleeps not, it will not bee silent, it will bee tell∣ing of us our duty, which if not performed, our guilt: it is index, judex, vindex, it sheweth us what wee should do, which if wee do not, it condemns us, and becomes not only our Judge, but our Executioner, for this is that worm that dieth not, but if wee hearken to the whispers and teachings of conscience, guided by the Word of God, it will prove the best friend wee have, next to Christ; besides your practi∣sing what you have heard, and may read in this Treatise. I have one thing more to re∣quest of you, which is your continual fervent prayers for a blessing upon mee, and my la∣bours amongst you. And it is not easie to de∣termine, whether those your prayers will bring greater advantage to your selves, or mee; for if by your supplications God shall enlarge his gifts and graces in mee, I shall endeavour to lay them out to your edification, which also I desire you would beg of the Lord for mee, who am
