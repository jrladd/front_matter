May it please your Grace,
IF I should present you with what is contain'd in this Concise Treatise, of The Way to Honour, as binding Rules to your Grace, I should be like to that ri∣diculous
Philosopher, who, not knowing any thing of War, more than some few Martial Axiomes, presum'd to read Mili∣tary Lectures to Hannibal, one of the greatest Captains ever Nature produc'd: Your Noble Soul being endued with such principles of true Honour, that it compre∣hends all Laws in it self, that direct and manage you. I only assume the boldness, my Lord, to throw these my Labours at your Grace's Feet, humbly begging that they may be shrouded under the Wings of your Grace's most noble Patronage; and I hope your truly Heroick Generosity is such, that it will not disdain the meaner, and obscurer, as well as more Glorious and Resplendent Objects: For I am confident I could not chuse a more Glorious Patron of The Way to Honour, than your Grace, the very Mirrour of true Honour, and E∣pitome of Worth. But if my Presumpti∣on in this present Dedication be great, yet I hope your Grace's greater goodness may be pleas'd to pardon the same. And though I am not ignorant that your Grace may be averse from all addresses of this
Nature; yet could not such an apprehen∣sion beat me from my design, being forc'd to the attempt by the ardent desire I had to show my humble and profound respects to your Grace's grand, as well Hereditary as Personal Merits, which are of such a transcendent Quality, as that all your Noble, and brave Inclinations, and De∣portments show you to be the Generous Son of that incomparable Hero, that miracle of Men, that Wonder of future Ages, the happy restorer of lawful Monarchy, and Loyalty. But here I must acknowledge my own insufficiency, to give due Praises to such eminent Virtue, which has rais'd it self upon the most solid Foundation of true Honour, that ever by-past Times could pro∣duce, Forreign Nations boast of, or Ancient or Modern Story mention, and leave it to a more able Pen, to do your Grace, if possi∣ble, and the World that right; but as it is beyond all former example, so I think it is above all real Character: wishing to see your Grace's Ensigns flourish where the Roman Eagles never flew.

Generous Prince, the Subject of this ensuing Discourse dis-agrees so much with my present condition, that it may with some shew of Justice give occasion to Criticks to upbraid me with Presumpti∣on: but when they know that neither my Condition, or hopes have formerly been so despicable, or desperate, but that I might with some reason have aspired to something else then what I am; and consider, that Fortune takes delight to display upon the Theater of prefer∣ment, the most remarkable tricks of her malice; they will be no more cen∣sorious, but commend the endeavour, though weak, as aiming at the publick good.
As that Glorious Lamp of the World distributes Light, Heat, Life, and moti∣on to inferiour bodies, without the least diminution of its Splendor, or inherent virtues; so may this our Rising-Sun send down benevolent influences on our rising hopes, before he reach the Meridian of his Glory. Then will we cry out with The∣mistocles,
we had been undone if we had not been so. I for my part will court occasions to merit the least favour∣able Aspect, and always acknowledge my self to be,
Brave Prince,
