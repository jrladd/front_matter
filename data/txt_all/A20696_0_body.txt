RIGHT Honourable Lord: Since my best abilitie is not able
in the least manner to counteruaile that dutie J owe vnto
your Lordship, for two great respects; the one in regard
(your Lordship vndertaking for mee) J was made a mem∣ber
of the Church of Christ, and withall receiued from you
my name: the other the loue that you beare to all excellen∣cy
and good learning, (which seemeth haereditarie aboue
others to the Noble Familie of the Sydneys,) and especially
to this excellent Science of Musicke, a skill from all antiquity
entertayned with the most Noble & generous dispositions.
May it please your Honour therefore to accept these few, and my first labours, as a poore
pledge of that zeale and dutie which J shall euer owe vnto your Honour, vntill time
shall enable me to effect something more worthy of your Lordships view, hauing
no other thing saue these few sheetes of Paper to present the same withall.
