Renowned Sir!
AS your Com∣mand is gene∣ral, so are your cares, troubles, sufferings, actions and endeavors allgeneral, for the general good of this Nation in ge∣neral: Nor is the case and number of the Prisoners for Debt in England and Wales, for whom you have been, and are a sol∣licitous, although yet im∣prosperous mediator to the Hous of Parlament so small a particular, but that as the prudent King
Philip of Macedon, who accompted his bodie but small to the rest of his en∣dowments, and knewit to be mortal, desired to be dailie remembred he was mortal, to the end he should not more glorie in what he had well done, than persevere in well-doing, and fi∣nishing his wel-begun enterprises; that so he might immortalise his fame, and illustrate the faculties of his immortal virtues, that posteritie might speak of him, not like
Pythagorists of their master, ipse dixit, but
ipsefecit; nay more, ipse per∣fecit. I hope likewise your Excellence will not be offended with me one of the heartiest, though of the meanest of your Honors wel-wishers, to mind you of the neg∣lected miseries of the said prisoners now, more then ever, likelier to be continued and increased then relieved, or abated by the generation of Lawyers overswaying the mildeness of thoseParlament Members that have long promised you to be merciful to such Prisoners, and to hasten their enlargement out of their wrongful imprisonments; which, if you see performed, as hereafter is desired, wil be an action of no less Divinitie then Charitie, and no lesse profit then Honour to your self in particular, and the Common-wealth in general. The Officers inLaw have latelie presen∣ted the Parlament with 13. Reasons
 the maintenance of Arrests and Imprisonment for Debt, contrarie to Magna Charta, and the
Petition of Right, as I have oftsoons proved elswhere, and re∣pugnant even to Reason it self, as I have here fol∣lowing farther declared in answer to their said Reasons in the Prisoner's behalf; in which, and whose names I likewise humbly dedicate the same to your Honor, with a copie of the said Reasons hereunto first annexed as it came to my hands, and next an answer to their preamble: and afterward particular an∣swers to their particular Ratiocinations: and lastly, the Prisoner's humble Petition to your Honor; all which I could not have readie be∣fore Colonel Pride's de∣parture (whom Godprosper in your Service, and the Common-wealth's, whose welfare hee preferreth above all worldlie ends) but have now presumed to send them unto you; beseech∣ing your Honor that your Lieutenant General, Colonel Fleetwood, (a man of no less worth then eminence) or some other like publik spirit may act in this matter, and others of the like nature in your Honor'sabsence according to your directions, and the people's necessitie from time to time, that no op∣portunitie bee loft, and more lives of Prisoners bee saved, and your care thereof to the uttermost expessed.
The Lord President of the Council of State, and Col. Martin are con∣ceived to bee no less willing then able to procure such a Commission as the Petitioners desire, and Law would afford, if your Honor would be pleased to write to them, which I humblie submit to your Honor's consideration.
