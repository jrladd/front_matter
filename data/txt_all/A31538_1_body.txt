RIGHT NOBLE LORD,
YOVR humble Servant hath observ'd
in the multitude of Books that have past
his hands, no small varietie of Dedicaâˆ£tions;
and those severally sorted to their
Presenters ends: Some for the meer
ambition of great names; Others, for the desire, or need
of Protection; Many to win Friends, and so favour
and opinion; but Most, for the more sordid respect,
Gain. This humbly offers into your Lo: presence with
none of these deformities: But as a bashfull Stranger,
newly arrived in English, having originally had the
fortune to be borne commended to a Grandee of Spain;
and, by the way of translation, the grace to kisse the
hands of a great Ladie of France, could not despair of
lesse courtesie in the Court of Great Brittain, then to be
received of your Lo: delight; his studie being to sweeten
those short starts of your retirement from publick affairs,
which so many, so unseasonable, even to molestation
trouble.
