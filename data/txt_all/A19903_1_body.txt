IF those VVombs blessed be, from whom proceedes
A world of blessings to the VVorld accurst;
Or if that gracious be, that Graces breedes,
To make Men gracious, being at the worst;


O then how blest and gracious is thy VVombe,
Deere Daughter, Sister, VVife vnto a King!
Wherein Heaven wrought (as in a sacred roome)
Strong Props of peace, which blest Time forth did bring.


Vnto a Mother-maide we all are bound,
For bringing forth our Soules preservatiue;
Who, for the same, is Queene in Heaven Crownd:
And, sith thou bring'st our Corpes conservatiue,
We must crown thee in Earth, or els, we should
Doe otherwise then Saints & Angels would.
