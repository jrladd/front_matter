BEing diuersly moo∣ued in mind, to signifie my good will and har∣tie loue towardes you, gentle M. Donning, I could not deuise any meanes more effectual, then by presenting the same to you, which had cost me some small labor and trauel. Not seeming ther∣by to acquite your manifold curtesies, towards me diuersly extended, but ra∣ther to discharge me of the note of In∣gratitude, which otherwise I might

seeme to incurre. Wherefore in steede of a greater present to counteruaile your friendlines, I am bold in the set∣ting foorth of this simple Pamflet vn∣der your name, to make a proffer of my thankeful heart to you againe. Wher∣in though want of farther abilitie ap∣peare, yet is there is no let, but that a wel-willing heart may be exprest, yea in the smallest gift. Now if haply the argument hereof appeare vnto you other than you could much wish, or I well afford, yet haue I no feare of any great misliking, considering your na∣tural disposition, which is to be deligh∣ted with honest pleasure, and com∣mendable recreation, and not to lie e∣uermore weltering, as it were, in dole∣full dumpishnesse. Which thing did put me in the greater hope, that this

worke would be the welcommer vnto you, especially considering the dele∣ctable varietie, and the often changes and chances contained in this present historie, which cannot but much stirre vp the mind and sences vnto sundry affections. What euer it be take it I beseech you, in good part, in stead of some better thing which I might well affoord, promising the same when oc∣casion shall serue, not being at this present so well furnished as I could wish of God: to whose good grace I re∣commend you and yours, both nowe and euermore.
