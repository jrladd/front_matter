RIght Reuerend, right Ho∣norable, and my singular good Lord, as no∣thing is more comfortable to the Mariner, or Sea-man, then after a great tempest to possesse a pleasant calme, and gratefull se∣renitie: so nothing is more plausible and ac∣ceptable, to them that haue employed, and exercised themselues in any parte of learning, then after their long and laborious trauaile, to enioy the warmth & bright reflection of an honorable countenance, this partly, and (if the great arrearage of dutie, and thankfulnes, which I owe to your Grace, doe not chal∣lenge prioritie) especially hath moued and inforced me, to present to your honorable view and patronage these tripartite Dialogues, to whom her sacred Maiestie hath committed the executing and maintenance of the Ciuill and Canon laws, in these Dialogues by my slender pencill rather delineated, then described: and be∣cause the Common lawe cannot otherwise bee diuided from these twaine, then the flower from the roote and stalke, therefore this entier discourse I haue wholly committed to your Graces tuition
 and disposall: In which I sought rather to profite the vnderstan∣ding, then to please the sense with a plaufible, copious, and polished stile, or with foreine conceipts not belonging to the titles of the lawe, which I handle: assuring my selfe, that as verball delights, and af∣fected vanities are to your Lordship odious, irkesome, and of no ac∣compt: so they are in trueth to the gaping eares of this curious age, very snares, and Syrens. Wherefore humbly referring my selfe to your Graces excellent wisdome, and abundant clemency, for the imparting of a fauorable regard and countenance to these my vn∣worthy labours, I beseech the almighty God with the most submisse deuotion of my heart, that the daies of your life (which the Lord of life multiplie) may be the degrees of your happines, to the great good of this Church, and Common weale, to the exceeding comfort, and contentment of such as be studious of vertue, law, and equitie, and to the immortall propagation of your fame and memory through all ages, and times, vntill the last time of all ages.
