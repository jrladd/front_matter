May it please your GRACE,
THE Commands of Your Grace, as well as of Those other Honourable Assistants at the Consecration, having encouraged this Sermon to appear in publick; I have presumed far∣ther to set Your Venerable name before it, in order to give it Countenance and Com∣mendation to all Good Men. The world will judge what abatements the Argu∣ment

may have possibly received from the weakness of the Manager; but (ab∣stracting from these) I am sure that Re∣ligion has no Subject wherein the Interests of Piety are more nearly concerned than they are in that here treated of: And therefore I cannot doubt but that Your Grace will be easie to forgive the Confidence of the Address, in contemplation of that advan∣tage, the Argument may thereby get to serve those ends of Piety to which it is de∣signed. And yet I have one end more in this Address, and that is, That it may withal testifie to the World the just vene∣ration I have for those mighty Accomplish∣ments both of Nature and Grace where∣with God hath Blessed You, in order to bless his Church with the fruits and bene∣fits of them,
London Feb. 2. 1685.
Your GRACE's Most humbly Devoted in all Duty and Obedience
