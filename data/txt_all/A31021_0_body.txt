Honored Sir,
AS I did frequently take fresh aire in your Dodonaean grove attending the Articulate, and intelligible susurra∣tions of your ever verdant vegitals, (to which former ages have nothing (in that kind) to assimulate, neither shall future times be able to parallel,) from these Apollinean Plants of yours, I have slifted here a twig, and there a sprig, and I have bestowed some time in binding them in a bundle, which with my selfe I humbly offer to your approved censure, it being the Apex of my am∣bition to have your honour'd selfe my justice in Eyre, I cannot say with Persius
Nec scombros metuent mea carmina, nec thus for this confused trusse of twiggs (as I may say) though made of greene wood, yet is it far from meriting any longaevity, it deserves rather to kin-


Helena, Ariadne, and Phyllis, with other innume∣rable eminent endouments which bounteous na∣ture hath liberally in all ages reposited in your lovely sex, as in the Apothecke or magasine of perfection, makes this my Gynophilian or amo∣rous infant long rather to be dandled upon your tender knees, then lie reclused in a dustie study.
If you please to bestow part of that time which you spend in other divertisments to converse with this poore brat of my braine, it will paint out unto you though with a quavering pencell, and in course and caligenous colours the passi∣ons of your royall Amorists, with inducements to commiserate them, the event whereof (which may make them operative in this kind) will per∣haps make you repent no more of reading them, then I of composing them. When you talke with your children you expect from them no congru∣ence or quaint language, yet you are often plea∣sed to heare them prattle, & are delighted with their lisping Ideoms. This makes me hope that you will dispence with the Lallation & Low di∣alect of this babe, whose tone is rude, yet his meaning is plaine dealing, which according to the proverbe is a jewell, and consequently most fit for Ladies. Thus wishing you all delights, & happinesse, endlesse like the rings you weare, & that the period of my paines may be the begin∣ning of your pleasure, I remaine
