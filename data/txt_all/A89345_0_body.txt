TIs not (dear Nephew) Blood, 'tis not Con∣sanguinity, those se∣veral ties and relati∣ons of Nature, more than a virtuous Mind and understanding Soul; those Powers and Faculties of your Soul, which I have known from your Childhood Active and Industrious, and now find crown'd with Habits Intellectual, These have layd an Obligation upon

me, of a more sacred civill reverence and respect unto your person; such Homage will I ever owe to the man where these are seated; for though I my self fall very short of such perfection, yet is it not the least of my comfort here, that I am a Philosopher, a Lover of Wisdome and Learning where ever I find it; my hand and heart is for it; to no petition against it, or the Nurseries thereof; for which cause I have entred my self a Student in the School of Nature and of Christ, there to find out this noble Science of the Soul; what I have met with here, and there dispersed, I have endeavoured to recollect and compile into this Volume; It is not therefore my own, I am no dis∣coverer of New Lights, no teacher of Strange Doctrines; I challenge in this Piece nothing but the Composure, the Substance or Matter you may find in the old and beaten path of Faith and Truth, which our Forefathers have trod, and

whose Footsteps we may securely fol∣low. To you then (as no affecter of No∣velty, but a lover of Truth) doe I dedi∣cate these my labours as a pledge of my Love, and part of that Debt owe you, accept then of these from him, who shall ever remain,
Sir,
