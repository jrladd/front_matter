Sir,
YOu are a young Gentleman, and fit for the Imâˆ£pression of such Religion, as the Jesuite by his subtilty, or the Presbyter by his Zeale can fasten upon you. You will be set upon by both, and both will endeavour to make you a Proselyte; (such Portion you are endued with, being the prey they hunt after) The following papers are therefore Dedicated to you, that you may be preserved a Catholique; and that they may spread under your favour, as a testimony of some thankfulnesse from, Sir,
1. Julij.
