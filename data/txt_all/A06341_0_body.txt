WHen I had (right
honourable and my
especial good lord)
thorowly perused
and cōsidered these
Prouerbs, or rather
Aphorismes of the marques of San∣tilliana.
I thought it not amis to be∣stow
some trauaile in turning them
into English: albeit I found them in
some places so darkly written, and
so corrupted by the Printer, as I
could sundrie times hardly attain to
the authors meaning. The gentlemā
(if but in respect of his estate and
calling deserueth of all men to be
welthought of. But considering the

matter wherof he entreateth (which
is chiefly to traine his readers to ho∣nestie
and vertuous life) he meriteth
at the handes of euerie good man
with double honour to be receiued
and welcomed. For there is nothing
assuredly more acceptable to God,
nor that in deede better beseemeth
man, then an vpright and honest
conuersation. And although the
chiefe intent of his writing was for
the institution and behauiour of a
Prince, yet are his rules and instru∣ctions
so generall, as they may verie
well serue for guides in good de∣meanour,
to euerie man of what de∣gree
soeuer he be. My simple trans∣lation
(for the Authour himself nee∣deth
no defender) I most humbly
commend to the protection of your
Lordship, as to him that is perfect∣ly
able to iudge, whether I haue tru∣ly
and faythfully followed my pa∣terne,

or no. As for such faults as
haue passed, as well in the title as in
the notes, being as they were com∣mitted
in my absence, & without
my knowlege, I trust your lordship
wil discharge me of the blame. God
sende your Lordship with long and
happie life to attaine to the end
of your good and ho∣nourable
de∣sires.
