Honoured Madam,
IT having been your daily Practice for these many Years, to set apart a considerable time for Meditation on the Joys of Heaven and Pains of Hell, which makes you fly the Sweets which end in so much Bitterness, and go cheer∣fully the hard way which leads to such endless Happiness: A Meditation of this twofold Estate will be no unwelcom Present; Tho your Ladyship has better Thoughts of your own, and better In∣spirations than Poets are acquainted with.
That, I know, in another would lessen the Value of the Present, but in your Ladyship it in∣creases it; for having improv'd the Thoughts, and mix'd with them Inspirations, you kindly believe the Author has more Part in them than he has, and humbly believe your Self to have less part in them than you have; for 'tis the Property of true Hu∣mility to build so high and lay the Foundations so low, that there is no distinct seeing from the bottom to the top.
This is the Advantage those Writers have which fall into your Hands, and 'tis such, that, considering it, I fear my little Present will seem made to your Ladyship rather for Self-ends than
to make any return for the many great Favors I stand Indebted for. Yet that was the first thing in my Thoughts, when I propos'd to my self this small Address; and should be the last, if this little Book of mine were but of Worth enough: But as it is, Honoured Madam, be pleas'd but to ac∣cept of it, and I am more indebted than before.
Honoured Madam,
