My LORD,
SInce I have had the honour to serve
your Lordship in the Cinque-Ports,
I have been frequently con∣sidering,
what seasonable return of
gratitude I might make, for the fa∣vours
I have receiv'd from your
Honour.

But fearing, no production of my
own might be worthy of Your accep∣tance;
I am inclin'd to borrow some∣thing
out of the common treasury of
learning, wherewith to pay my first∣fruits
of duty and obedience.
What I presume to lay before Your
Lordship, may not prove perhaps un∣acceptable,
since 'tis a small, but ex∣cellent
Treatise, of very great esteem
amongst the learned and judicious; and
does now justly implore Your Lord∣ship's
Protection whether we consider
the subject matter it treats of, or the
places to which it relates; in both
which Your Lordship is at this time
very nearly and happily concern'd.
'Tis an Historical discourse of the
Roman Ports and Forts in Kent, wrote
some years ago, by a very eminent An∣tiquary
of Canterbury, but never be∣fore
publish'd; and therefore humbly
desires to be usher'd into the world
under the gracious Patronage of Your

Lordship; as being well assur'd, that
the same auspicious effects, which daily
attend both the Cinque-Ports, and
County, from your great Wisdom and
Sagacity, will as certainly here ensue,
from Your Countenance and Autho∣rity.
Their Sacred Majesties, who know
best how to value what is really to
be esteemed, and to place those per∣sons
in the highest trust, whose
merits, and great accomplishments,
deservedly entitle them to such ho∣nourable
employments, have advanc'd
Your Lordship (of whose faithful ser∣vice
they have had so large experi∣ence)
to that noble Station of Govern∣ment,
in which you happily preside
in Ireland; which never stood in
greater need of such an able Patriot
and Protector.
Our Annals inform us, how infi∣nitely
Ireland stood once before in∣debted
to the matchless Wisdom and

Courage of one of Your Renowned
Progenitours, The Honourable Sir
Henry Sydney, Lord Deputy under
Queen Elizabeth; who, for the space
of eleven years, gave admirable proofs
of dexterity and Conduct, in the ma∣naging
of that untractable people;
though he had little else to encounter
with, but obstinacy and Rebellion.
And, my Lord, whoever considers
those Great and Noble Endowments
of mind, with which Heaven has
enriched You, for the general good
and benefit of the world, may from
hence easily conjecture how extremely
happy at this juncture the Irish na∣tion
must needs be, under Your Lord∣ship's
present Lieutenancy; who seem
in all respects, both born and form'd
on purpose, to be the Tutelary Guar∣dian
of that distracted Island.
To render this Tract, if possible,
a litle more grateful and inviting; I
have subjoyned a Catalogue, from the

most Authentic Historians, of those
Noble Personages who have been Your
Lordship's Predecessors in the Con∣stableship
of Dover-Castle, and War∣denship
of the Cinque-Ports, which
are both indeed Offices of as great
Antiquity as Renown.
The learned Mr. Camden has
observed, that our Warden of the
Ports, did resemble the Officer,
whom the Romans established for
the defence of our Coasts, call'd
by them, Littoris Saxonici, or Tra∣ctus
Maritimi Comes; who had then
the charge of nine Ports, as the Lord
Warden has now of five: and all∣though
there is no doubt, but during
the Saxon Heptarchy, the Ports
were under the Regency of some such
sort of extraordinary Officer, as this
was; yet if the famous Antiquary
Mr. Lambard may have any credit,
he tells us, that William the Con∣querour

was the first, that imposed
upon the Limenarcha the name of
Warden, out of his own Norman lan∣guage:
and Mr. Darell, in his ac∣count
of these matters, saith, that
William the Conquerour created
John Fynes Constable of Dover-Castle,
which title of honour he settled, by
Deed of Gift, upon him and his heirs;
which may occasion a conjecture, not
alltogether improbable, that under
the reign of that Prince, those ho∣nourable
offices began first to be
united, in the person of one man:
however, 'tis certain, they have ne∣ver
since been separated; but what∣ever
great and eminent Persons
have been thus nobly Dignified, by
the grace and favour of their Prince,
their names stand now upon this sig∣nal
Roll of honour, in a successive se∣ries
to this present generation.
But, my Lord, I consider that your
minutes are sacred.

May your Lordship's great Me∣rits,
and honourable Atchievements,
both for their Majesties and their
Kingdoms, make you still the Fa∣vourite
of Your Prince, the Glory
of your Age, the delight of your
Countrey, and the Honour of the
Cinque-Ports: may You live long
and flourish, in an enjoyment of e∣very
thing, that may conduce to your
Happiness; that so by the favour of
Heaven, I may the longer enjoy an
opportunity to pay my constant duty
to Your Lordship, and be more and
more capable to give a repeated te∣stimony,
how much I am,
My Lord,
