MADAM,
FAITH and REPEN∣TANCE are the neces∣sary Conditions required on our part in order unto Sal∣vation.
 Most hope for Sal∣vation, but few that expect the benefit of the Covenant, will come up to the Terms of it.

And that the Blessings of Heaven and Earth may descend up∣on the Honoured Esquire and You; and that as ye are rich in this World, ye may be rich in Faith, that will entitle ye to a better, shall be the sincere and daily desire of
