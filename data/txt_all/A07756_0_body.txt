NOtwithstandinge that the natural dispo sition (right Honour∣rable) of all humaine creatures, ought moste sufficiētly to instruct vs in the knovv ledge of our ovvne frailtie, & so con∣sequently inforce vs vnto a continu∣all and earnest desire of death, vvhich assuredly is no other then a translati∣on and passage of our soules out of this transitorie habitation, into an e∣uerlasting & parmanēt house, exempt from manifolde miseryes and inconue∣niences, vvherunto this our painfull Pilgrimage is stil subiect, yet for as∣much as the vveakenesse and imper∣fection of our carnall vnderstanding

is such, as that it cannot comprehend or perceiue the infinite and inesti∣mable benefits, vvhiche at all times through death vve doo obtaine, but rather dooth inforce vs to feare the same as some sharp tempest or gree∣uous passage. I thought it not amisse to translate out of Fraunce into this our natiue soile of England, this breefe but moste excellent discourse, first vvritten in Frenche by a godly and learned Christian, for the greate comfort of all Christes members: and novv do on into English for the be∣nefit of suche as therin vvill seeke to reape any commoditie, the rehearsall of the contents vvherof by reason of the breuitie of the same, seemeth both needles & superfluous. Neuerthelesse seeking the protection of some hono∣rable personage, vvhose countenance and authoritie might sbeelde and de∣fend asvvel the rudenesse of the tran∣slation, as also the raggidnes of the stile therof, from the bitter tants and

biting scofs of crul reprehension, and thervvithall calling to minde not o ly your moste honorable and vertuous disposition & authoritie, but also the manifolde benefits vvhich most boun∣tifully you haue at all times vpon me vnvvorthy bestovved. I accounted it my bounden dutie, as onely an ac∣knovvledgīg of the receit of the same: to present vnto your honors fauoura∣ble tuition, these frutes of my small la∣bors, vvith most humble request to ac∣cept of them as the excellēcie of the ar gument deserueth. Thus assuredly ho∣ping in your most honorable vvunted clemencie, & trusting that heer in you wil vouchsafe to pardō this my so bolde and rash attēpt, I shall alvvaies (ac∣cording to my boūden duty) pray to the almightie, long to maintain your Ho nors vvelth and felicitie, to your co fort and his glory.
