 Honored,
It was my great good happiness to see
Part of this your vailed Mystery,
re to the censure of th world it s ,

And in that part, we thought I did descry
 and discerning ey
 which hidden were






Enjoy those sweet Rvs .
For they to us are truly now mad 
To  win.
And when at first this  view,
Like a Prospective glass, it ly 


 Glass,
May be a ll yet 
To 

So was th' foundation of this Piece too sure,
To hinder, or a little doubt procure
Of what proceeds; for the foundation tryd
There is no fear but th' Building will a∣bide.
And that which followed drew so near my sight,
By what preceded, that I know 'tis right.
And will abide the storms of envies blast,
Or censures of the world, or standers cast
Either on it, or those who do believe,
God did to you this heav'nly wisdom give
Methinks they have been like to a tender Plant,
Who yields none of its precious fruit for want
Of the assistance of the Gardners hand,
And he yet waits for an express command
re he transplant a thing which is so rare
(On which his Lord hath an indulgent care,
And in't takes pleasure) so the Gardner will
Not meddle with it to remove it, till
 Lord give order; which done, he then tows
It  lace where pleasantly it grows.
And by  elp of his industrious hand,
Proves to be th' mirror of all Plants i'th land,
And bears much ft, and that proves Cordial too,
And cures such Griefs, as nothing else could do.
Like such a Plant as this, these things have lain,
Till you transplanted them, and made it plain.
You are the Gardner, and your Works the Plant,
The Fruit's the experience of each pre∣cious Saint,
Which is an Antidote for to expel
The poisonous and temptatious snares of hell,
And hath such peerless virtue, that it can
Inflame some Souls, and quench some o∣thers then;
For as the one tastes in a strong desire,
To blow the coals, and not to quench the fire:
So on the contrary, the other who
Doth taste but onely for to make a show
That he hath tryd such things, & fds in∣deed,
They are but husks on which we seem to feed.
Then secretly this liquid Fruit it will
Put out the warmness, and an ice congea
In that presumptious soul who dares to say
This is not the right path, or heav'nly way
If we for parallels would seek, we may
Look o're the Bible, and no other way:
For ther's explained by the apostles there
Such things as are not to be found else∣where,
Till you in your great Works did so excel,
That onely to themselves they'r parallel,
But if reflection back on them we make,
'Twill not a tittle of the glory take
From this your Work, but it will rather ad
A lustre, in confirming what you've said.
I'ave heard there is a fountain, and some say
'Tis in the Confines of Armenia,
Which hath such strength in that close Element,
That whosoe're 's by angry fortune sent
Into this fountain, or fals within its brik
It bears them up, & wil not let them 
Even such is your Commission; for who e'
Falls upon it, he shall not need to fear
That seeming danger, which at first may show
A threatning face, or knit an angry brow:
And this clear fountain, if considered 
Would represent more then my pe ate
But our All-seeing God is he or whom
You dayly wait for Revelation.
And your inspired Soul is so divine,
That 'tis a Theam fit for Wits more su∣blime,
Then my weak Genius, therefore Ile give way
To those who more refined Wits do sway,
And mine shall onely be a foil to clear,
Or make anothers verse more fair 
And so I wish you many succeeding ,
That you may write again to Gods great praise,
And the Saint; benefit
