SIR, AFTER that I perceiued that my age ioi∣ned with conti∣nuall sickenesse, would suffer me no more to be profytable too Christes Church and common welth, by my voyce, wordes, and going a∣brode, thought it meete by such mē∣bers and meanes as GOD hath left in
 me as yet vnhurt and vntouched, for that portion of liuing that I haue, to profit the Church of God as much as I coulde. And therefore within these xij. Monethes I haue translated one booke out of Latin into English, and haue writtē one homily against Glut∣tonye and Drunkennesse, and other vices annexed thervnto, and haue set them abrode, for the promoting and increasing of the kingdome of GOD. I thought also, seeing that God hath also endued mee with the knowledge of bodilye Phisicke, after that I had sought to promote the kingdome of GOD, to communicate some part of my knowledge that God hath gi∣uen vnto me in naturall knowledge, vnto my brethren that had nede ther∣of. But when as I perceiued that there was so much vse of Wine in all cou¦tries of Englande, and so many errors committed in the abusing of it, both of the most part of the Laitie, and al∣so of some of the learned that pro∣fesse
 naturall knowledge, I thought I should doe no small benefite vnto the Church and Common welth of Eng∣land, if that I shoulde set out a booke of the natures of Wines, and confute the errors and ill opinions that all men haue concerning the natures and properties of them. And this booke haue I now ended, and dedicate vnto your Honor for a token of the good will that I beare vnto you, desiring you also to be a Patrone of it against all such babling and vnlearned So∣phisters, as wyll speake agaynst it, not being armed with learning, authori∣tie and reason, but onelye with their olde Sophistrie, which they learned in the time of ignoraunce and darke∣nesse. If these will be to busie in de∣fending of their errors, and will goe about to defende them, and con∣fute the truth that I haue taught in this booke, if that I can haue by the helpe of God, graunted vnto me any truce betweene me and my disease, I
 entende to put you to small paine in the defending of my Booke, for I haue beene matched with as big men as these bee, I thanke GOD, and well haue escaped without dishonor. But if my sicknesse will not suffer me to doe it that I would otherwise doe, then I must desire you and other of my friendes to defende mee so farre forth as I defende the truth.
Furthermore, whereas I set out of late a boke, declaring at large the ver∣tues and properties of the great Tri∣acle called Theriaca Andromachi, and of the Triacle of Mithridates called Mi∣thridatium, and also of the Triacle Salt, and the booke was negligentlye and falselye printed, and diuerse honest men think it necessarie to be printed againe, & I purpose to doe the same, & bicause it were necessary to haue a pa∣trone for it, which it hath wanted hi∣therto: I dedicate and giue this boke also vnto your learned Honor, desi∣ring you also by your learnyng and
 wisedome to be patrone vnto it as I aue made you of my other booke. No more at this time, but the Lorde Iesus encrease you with the know∣ledge of his holy worde, and with grace to lyue al∣wayes according to the same, A∣men.
