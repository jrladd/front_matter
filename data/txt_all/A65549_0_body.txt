SIR,
I Have oftentimes in secret reproached myself of ingratitude, in that I never yet in any of those things, which I exposed to the World, have made publick acknowledg∣ment how much I owe to You: Sincerly therefore now repenting, I reform; and own my self to have received from You not onely excellent Rudi∣ments of good Literature, but the first Rational Impressi∣ons of Religion.
I rather prefix this Recognition to the ensuing Discourse, than to either of the other in its company, because, Sir, it was truly the sense I had of Your piety, which first ope∣rated towards the reconciling me to Church-Musick. I came to You with prejudices (very unreasonable, such as commonly all prejudices are) against it: The first Organ I ever saw or heard, was in Your House, which was in those dayes a more regular Church than most we had pub∣lickly. I then thus judged, if a man of such real Devotion, as I knew You to be of, would keep an Organ for sacred Ʋse, even when it was interdicted and of dangerous conse∣quence,
 there was certainly more of reason for it, and ser∣viceableness in it, than I apprehended. When afterwards God was pleased to bring again the Captivity of our Mo∣ther the English Church, my own experience soon con∣vinced, that those my favourable thoughts were most just: and now I have thought my self concern'd to tell the preju∣dicate World so much.
I have, Sir, no other recompence to make, which You will accept, for all Your antient care and real kindnesses to∣wards me, than this poor acknowledgment, together with my serious prayers for a full Retribution to You from Him, who sees in secret, but will reward openly.
In confidence that You acquiesce herein as a plenary satis∣action, I will dare to stile my self,
SIR,
