SIR,
MY publishing the foregoing Sermon puts me in mind of a Debt of the same Kind to Your self, which I shall dis∣charge by publishing that which follows. Why it was not publish'd when first de∣sired, the Sermon it self will speak my Apology. I there represent Good King Jehosaphat giving such Counsel to His Judges, as was not given to the Judges of this Realm in the Year 1686. &c. And although, preaching upon such an Occasion, I thought it no less than my Duty to Speak what I did; yet to Print it (which was beyond my Duty) would have been no other than an Officious Im∣prudence.

The Printing it Now gives me a Fresh Admonition to be Thankful to God for the wonderful Providence whereby we were delivered from those fearful apprehensions which possest us at that Time; and whereby we are settled in such a state of Happiness and Freedom, that any One may say what is Consonant to Law and Justice, without fear of Thwart∣ing the Measures of the Government; or hazard of being brought under Censure for it. And Your self may now Safely (which then you could not) espouse the Dedicati∣on, as a Testimony of my Respect, who am
Sir, Your Affectionate and humble Servant,
