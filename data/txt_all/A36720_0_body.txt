Madam,
IF yee could
see your self
without the
help of a re∣flex,
I should
not need to
present you with this glass,

but since even internal spe∣culations
result most from
outward intuitions in this
mirror of an Accomplished
woman, you may let your
self into your self at your eies,
and so fit them with an ob∣ject
proportionable to their
own beauty: and only thus
could I lessen the distance be∣tweene
my obligations and
my services, by an exact ac∣compt
of you to your selfe,
since it is so hard for you to
take it from our sex, which
are auditors in the valuation
of yours, because the loveli∣nesse
of your person may ex∣pose
even a true estimate of
your vertues to your suspi∣tion

of passion. This is
the only ill office, Madam,
your body can do your mind,
which it doth by so faire
meanes, that you may easily
forgive it. The original of
this Woman is French, whose
perfection must needs fall
some degrees, in this change
of the Horizon. You, Ma∣dam,
are in English the E∣dition,
as well as the Dedi∣cation,
and your actions do
translate better this booke,
then my words; so that this
cannot enform your under∣standing
in any new unac∣quired
grace or vertue, but
by a duplication of your me∣mory,
convince your mode∣stie

of a needlesse desire to
improve; and as your con∣versation
may be instruction
for others, so this which
was meant for edification, is
but strict enough for your
entertainment. Here (Ma∣dam)
you shall find Ill both
severely reproved, and fairely
shamed, by shewing the ex∣cellency
of good in Ill's grea∣test
brag, Variety: and shame
doth not only restrain, but
rectifie more then fear; For
women apprehend lesse the
effusion of blood for punish∣ment,
then the diffusion of it
for shame. Here you shall find
humors as well mix'd and
shadowed by one another, as

ever you saw colours; and
so much diversity in Loves
archery, as one would think
Cupid shot out of a Rain-bow.
Each severall humour hath
a point to fasten on its
correspondency, therefore
there is no wondring at the
seeming extravagancy of pas∣sions.
Here (Madam) I conceive,
you may learne by reading,
what you cannot so easily by
conversation, because no body
dares tell it you, when any bo∣dy
is in love with you; which
you may be assured of, when
you find a judicious admirer
of an Accomplish'd Woman;
and this Rule is their prote∣ction

as well as their discove∣ry.
I (Madam) may be an
admirer of this Woman in
French, but an excuser of this
in the language of
