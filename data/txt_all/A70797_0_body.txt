Dread Soveraign,
THe occasion of these few lines is neither to renew your sor∣row, nor stir up your Majesty to revenge; I know you have learned a better lesson from our blessed Lord and Saviour, to forgive your enemies; neither is it my design to plead for that which I even tremble to write, viz. Regicide, I

know the world expects some should be made examples of Ju∣stice, God forbid that blood-guiltiness, especially of our King should go unpunisht. But that Justice & mercy might kiss each other. These ensuing lines were writ in the midst of your and our sufferings; the onely end both in writing and publishing was to Vindicate your Royal Father, our Dread Soveraign of blessed memory, thereby to make a more easie passage for your most Excellent Majesty to ascend unto the Royall throne of your famous Progenitors: And now see∣ing

God at last by his wonder∣full and most miraculous Pro∣vidence, hath brought your Sacred Majesty to your just Rights & Dominions, I make bold in all humility to prosti∣tute both my self and this small Tract at your Royall Feet, be∣seeching your Clemency to ac∣cept of this small Mite of my Loyalty, begging your graci∣ous pardon for my great pre∣sumption, beseeching Almigh∣ty Jehovah the God of your Fathers to redouble in you your Fathers Graces and Vertues, & recompence to your Majesty for all your unparalelled suffer∣rings

& patience, in the perfect obedience and affection of all your Subjests & establish your Royall Throne here on Earth, and at last give you a Crown of Glory in the highest hea∣vens,
so prays,
