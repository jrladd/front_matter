SVCH persons of
Honour, Woorship
and Wealth, as in
respecte of vnfeig∣ned
goodwill, and
owed duetie, present vnto your
renowmed Ladyshippe the glori∣ous
giftes of glittering gold, pre∣cious
pearles, or other rich and
sumptuous furniture, although
thereby they gratefullie testifie
their cheareful hearts and louing
mindes to your Honour, yet do

they therein bestowe none other
thing, then that which by nature
is perishing pelfe, and transitorie
trah, subiect to casualtie, liable to
chaunge, and remoueable by
chaunce: and withall also, such,
whereof your Honour (through
Gods especiall good grace, and
bountifull fauour) standeth al∣ready
most richly stoared, mag∣nificently
possessed, and aboun∣dantly
furnished, But as my slen∣der
estate and base condition en∣uieth
me the hap, and forestalleth
me the possibility to send abroad
such florishing fairings: so again,
on the other side, hath duety ve∣hemently
incited mee to deuise
one course or other, how to no∣tifie
my zeale, & loyalty towards
your excellent estate and dignity.
Hereupon it hath pleased God to
make this small Treatise, the in∣instrument

of my wished desire,
and the faithfull messenger of my
willing hart. Small it is (Madam)
& compendious (I confesse) both
in volume & words: but yet such,
as shall (I doubt not) minister a∣boundant
stoare of spirituall di∣rection
and comfortable counsel,
for any Christian conscience, that
shall aduisedly read, & attentiuely
marke the godly documents, &
sound aduertisements therein cō∣prised.
For herein are there brief∣ly,
plainly, familiarly, and metho∣dically
laid open, ripped vp, dis∣plaied,
anatomized and vnfolded
(in effect) all the secret corners &
starting hoales of the inwarde
man: together with the stinking
Camerine of all the other parti∣cular
enormities, offēses & trans∣gressiōs
outwardly also, through
thesway of sinne, bursting out in

vs into action. Whereuppon, the
conscience being by most plaine
and apparant euidence, endited,
arraigned & conuicted, is driuen
to disclaime al helpe, merit, righ∣teousnes,
condignity or worthi∣nes
in it selfe, & prostrately to sue
for pardon at the mercifull hands
of God thorough Christ. The
which, as I most hartily (for the
vowed duety, and vnfeigned loy∣alty,
that I beare vnto you, & vnto
that rare Mirour of Nobility, the
Earle of Essex your Son, my sin∣gular
good Lord and Master) doe
heere offer vnto your Honorable
patrocinie: so doe I no lesse hum∣bly
beseech you (right renowmed
Lady) to afford thereunto the be∣nefit
of your fauorable protectiō:
as I during my life, shal remaine a
true & continual petitioner vnto
almighty god, for the prosperous

health & glorious successe of that
Noble Earle your husband, with
all the honorable, worshipfull, va∣liant,
faithful & true hearted En∣glishmen
now vnder his charge &
gouernement: of your good La∣dyshippe,
and all your Christian
housholde: Wishing the blessed
grace of Christ still to keepe you,
his holy Spirite to leade you, his
mercy to nourish you, his counsel
to direct you, his peace to com∣fort
you, his rich giftes to adorne
you, and his heauenly blessing in
honour to continue you, to the
glory of his holy name, the com∣fort
of your owne consciences▪ &
the common wealth of this our
florishing Realme and Country.
From my poore house at Little Ilford,
in Essex the 6. of October▪ 1587.
