THough the Gentlemen who have contributed to this Ex∣cellent
Collection stand in need of no Advocates to Vin∣dicate
what they have Written: Yet the Reflections of some who
decry'd the Design, because they had no concern in it, and the
Malice of others, who gave it out for an Vn-correct and Tri∣sling
Performance, renders a defence of it wholly Necessary.
The Reader will soon be satisfied, that the Care which has
been taken in Compiling this Volume, has been more than has
hitherto been usual in Collections of this Nature, and will
agree with us, that Iustice has been done to the Great Man
they are written in Honour of. As the Gentlemen whom we
have entrusted with the Supervisal and Choice of the several
Poems, have had our Thanks, so we question not, but they will
have those of the Reader▪
And if some Gentlemen among the many others, whose Ver∣ses
are not inserted, should take it amiss, we can excuse our
selves no other way, than by giving them to understand, we are
satisfied of the Iudgment of those Learned Gentlemen, who
did us the favour of making Choice of the most Valuable Per∣formances,
though they may perhaps call it in question, be∣cause
it has run Counter to theirs.
