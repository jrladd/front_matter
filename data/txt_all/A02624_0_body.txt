RIght worthy Sir, the honor which I beare,
And euer will vnto your worthy line,
Makes me presume (presumption cannot feare)
To tender you this litle Booke of mine:
Whose substance if your honor will approue,
My lines shall limits want, so doth my loue.


That man of men whose fatall name you beare,S. P. S.
Of his vnnumbred worthes the chiefe were these:
Three glorious wreathes vpoÌ„ his brow to weare,
Which said he, loued learning, warre, and peace.
O aemulate this man the sonne of Fame,Baye.
Haue all his vertues, though but halfe his name.Oliue, and Oake.


Pursue thy first designments (noble Knight)
Affect thy Country, and admire thy King:
