I Here present you, my dear Friend, with a Discourse, wherein I labour to advance the great and true Ends of Life, the Glory of God, and the Perfecti∣on and Happiness of Man. I cannot, I confess, pretend to have come up to the Dignity of my Subject, yet I have done what I could, and have attempted it with my utmost Force. I know you too well to imagine you fond of an Address of this pub∣lick nature; you love the real and solid Satisfactions, not the Pomp and Shew, those splendid Encumbrances, of Life: Your

rational and vertuous Pleasures burn, like a gentle and chearful Flame, without Noise or Blaze. However, I cannot but be con∣fident, that you'll pardon the Liberty which I here take, when I have told you, that the making the best Acknowledgment I could to one, who has given me so many Proofs of a generous and passionate Friendship, was a Plea∣sure too great to be resisted.
I am Dear Sir,
