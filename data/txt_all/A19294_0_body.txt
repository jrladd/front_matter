RIght worthy and beloued
in our Lord Iesus Christ:
It is the wonderfull mercy
and exceeding patience of
our gratious God towards vs of this
sinfull Nation that in the middest of
such fearfull stormes and bloody
garboyles deuouring our neighbors
round about vs, wee of this Iland
though, as it were, enuironed round
about with such tempestuous seas,
do yet notwithstanding enioy such

temperate seasons, as not onely to
eate the fruite of our owne labours,
but to be enabled moreouer out of
our aboundance to entertaine and
releeue our distressed neighbours.
And is not the wisedome of God ad∣mirable
herein to warne vs to looke
home, when our neighbours house is
on fire, and to make it our owne
case, what is common to vs with o∣thers.
Is not his mercy vnspeakeable
that seeing charitie couereth a multi∣tude
of sinnes, and much is forgiuen to
those that loue much, therefore wee
may haue hope of Gods longer for∣bearance
& indulgence towards vs,
so long as we regard the afflictions
of Ioseph, & by our brotherly affe∣ctions,
beare one anothers burthen.
Surely though the sickle must be put
in when the haruest is ripe, and there
are too many signes among vs that
the regions are white vnto the haruest,
yea that the Deere is gone out to
go through the land, yet euen here
I haue obserued these meanes to stay
the execution. First, when there are

some remaining to stand in the gap to
turne away the wrath. Secondly,
when the Lord is iustified and ap∣proued
by his word. And thirdly,
when by our compassion and pru∣dence
wee doe communicate with
the afflictions of our brethren, and
so voluntarily suffer with them in
their distresses. Wherein as we haue
speciall cause to blesse our gratious
God for his good hand with our
worthy Nehemiah in this holy
worke, so are wee wisely to secure
our selues in succouring others, and
doing good while wee haue time
to the houshold of faith. Shall not
Sathan and his instruments herein
otherwise condemne vs, who if euer
heretore, do speedily combine them
selues against the Lord and his an∣noynted,
whose maine policy it is
in these latter dayes to disunite the
hearts of Christians and to weaken
their hands that they may more
speedily and easily make prey of
them. Doe not his croaking frogges
those infernall Iebusites compasse

land and sea to this end, creeping
into the chambers, yea into the harts
of Princes, both to exasperate such as
are auerse against the poore mēbers
of Christ, and also alienate euen the
well affected from the maintenance
of the common faith. And doe wee
thinke that they haue left any stone
vnrowled to compasse the same,
can we imagine but that these spirits
of diuels haue waded into the depth
of their fathers methods, and as she
in the Poet:
When heauen will affoord no helpe,
shee'le moue the infernall powers, so in
despite of heauen these limbs of Sa∣than
haue now failed to employ the
powers of darkenesse for the more
effectuall deluding of the children
of disobedience? And are not these
the times wherein if it were possible
the very elect may bee seduced and
ensnared hereby. Is not the wisdome
and iustice of God admirable herein
that when the Foole saith in his heart
there is no God, & the Atheist dreams
of no other hell but to bee in debt,

and affliction, and so plots by all
meanes to build his heauen on earth
by wallowing in all excesse of riot
and vanitie, as hereby he reapes such
wages of his error as is meet, euen to
be giuen vp to a reprobate sense, and
so not onely to all monstrous and
desperate wickednesse, but euen to
maintaine and secure the same a∣gainst
all future reckonings, as if he
had made a couenent with hell, and
were at an agreement with death▪ so
is he iustly taken in his owne crafti∣nesse,
and most wonderfully arrested
by the power of hell, to the appa∣rant
confusion of his imagined hap∣pinesse,
and while hee dreames of
no other heauen but to doe what hee
list in earth, hee is not onely therein
restrained by the power of heauen
to the confusiō of his present hopes
for the good of the Saints, but also
iustly caught in the snares of his
owne wickednesse by the power of
hell, as to beginne and seale hereby
vnto him eternall vengeance, and to
hasten him thereto; so that the righ∣teous

may more wonderfully escape
of our trouble, when the wicked are
falne into the pit they digged for them.
Surely as it is a righteous thing with
God, that they that doe not receiue the
loue of the truth, shall be giuen vp to
strong delusions to beleeue lies: so if e∣uer
satan were transformed into an
Angell of light, and so more effectu∣ally
by his lies and subtilties did de∣ceiue
vnstable soules: If euer the
sure word and wonderfull workes of
God were outfaced and suppressed
by the sleights and forgeries of the
God of this world, the experience here
of is most notorious in our times: to
instance in this particular being the
subiect of our experience how
mightily the Lord hath iustified his
word, both auouching in these dayes
the truth of this doctrine of Witchcraft
as also euidencing the power thereof
in dissoluing the workes of Satan, as
experience hath made it manifest,
so we haue had not onely the great
Patrones and friends of the Church
confirming the same, but euen the

Churches verie enemies haue beene
enforced to acknowledge no lesse.
And yet such hath been the efficacy
of delusion, that this very same most
glorious truth vpon other respects as
it hath found hard measure among
fained friends, so it hath also there∣by
beene traduced and peruerted by
it enemies. And surely we may the
lesse wonder hereat, if we consider
wisely, that as commodities are in re∣quest
with many according to their
diuers humours, and different seasons,
so doth it befall the sacred truth.
which though it be sometimes in re∣quest,
when it may serue to aduance
the pride of the flesh and infancie of re∣ligion,
yet doth it easily grow out of
date, when either it tends to humble
the flesh, or iustly challengeth luke∣warmnesse
and hypocrisie. Which as it
was the portion of the Lord and ma∣ster
of the Church, sometimes to bee
cryed vp with Hosanna, eftsoones
to bee cryed downe with crucifige so
hath it beene the lot of the scepter of
this kingdome, the budding rod of Aa∣ron

sometimes to be turned into a ser∣pent
in the opinion of man, as if it
onely entended to destruction and
not to edification, no better then a
doctrine of licentiousnesse or sedition
and despaire, which eftoones was
in esteeme as Angels foode, sweeter
then honey, pretious aboue rubies,
most orient gems. Which seeing it
hath beene also the portion of this
truth concerning witchcraft, is it
any maruell if what man opposeth
and seeketh to suppresse, the Lord
himselfe hath powerfully maintaind
and iustified, as prouing vnto it
gainesayers a sauour of death, that
haue refused to embrace the same
as a sauour of life vnto life. Surely
when I discerne the efficacy of de∣lusion
preuailing in these dayes e∣uen
vpon such that haue tested of
the good word of God, and beene per∣takens
of the enlightning spirit: and so
haue had some kenning of the power
of the life to come, and yet are so
falue away from conscience, yea from
science it selfe, that they are very

strangers from the life of God through
their affected ignorance, and being
willingly ignorant of what they haue
formerly beene conuinced of, are
growne to bee starke-mockers of all
powers; yet all forme of Religion,
and so in this their Atheisme,
sing a Requiem to their soules, fea∣ring
no other hell, then to be mooued
in their slippery state, and dreaming of
no other heauen then to build their
foundation in the sands: Mee thinkes
I see the foolish worldling on the
pinnacle of his confidence, and so in
his greatest security, lying open to
confusion. And do I not see the Iu∣stice
of God working wonderfully
herein, in besotting the foole in his
owne wisedome. Euen giuing him
vp to rest vpon such broken reedes,
for the securing of his Babel, which
are the onely meanes to confound
the same. And hath not the God of
the world by diuine permission a spe∣ciall
stroke in this delusion, not only
to proue a lying spirit in the mouth
of our false Prophets, bidding to go
