SHall it be said (I shame, it should be thought)
When After-Ages shall record Thy Worth;
My sacred Muse hath left SOVTH-HAMPTON forth
Of Her Record; to Whom so Much shee ought?
th from Thy Town (where My Sarauia taught)
Her slender Pinions had their tender Birth;
And all, the little all shee hath of worth,
Vnder Heav'ns Blessing, onely Thence shee brought.
r lack, therefore, of fitter Argument;
And lother Now, it longer to delay;
Heer while the Part of PHILIPS Page I play)
I consecrate This little Monument
Of gratefull Homage, to Thy noble Bounty;
And Thankeful loue to (My deer Nurse) Thy County.
