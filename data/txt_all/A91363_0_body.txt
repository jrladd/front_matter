OF all people in the world, those are the only happy people, whose God is the Lord, Psal. 144. 15.
Whether they are high or low,

learned, or in the worlds account illi∣terate: that are tempted or deserted, afflicted or oppressed, they are pretious in the account of God, though vile and contemptible in the eyes of men, &c. my brethren, for your sakes this piece is come to publike view, which is neither deficient in necessaries, nor abundant in superfluities: the con∣sideration of the shortness of our time, and the largness of volumes, and the weakness of our memory, engaged me in this work; Our ten∣der father, who knows what is best for us, hath gathered up all pra∣ctical Divinity into ten precepts; and our Saviour hath reduced those ten into two, and all that we can pray for, or against, into six heads or petitions; my dear friends, labour to keep close to God in this loose age,

spend not your pretious time in complaining on others, but endeavour in the use of all means to reform your selves; beware of scandals, take them not where they are, make them not where they are not; lay the foundation of mortification deep, reserve no lust from the stroke of Jesus Christ; take heed of pleasing your selves in a bare formall professi∣on, labour to be rooted in Christ and abide in his doctrine, let your speech be alway with Grace, and a word or two of Christ in every company; beware of sleighting or neglecting of any of the ordinances of God, or giving those to sinners that belong to Saints; consider▪ the truth is the same in all ages, only it shines more and more clear from age to age, untill that which is perfect is come,

and that which is imperfect be done away; the truth held forth is the same, though with more of God and less of man; such addition is no innovation, but an illustration, not new light but new sight; a man may not be said to make a new world, when he makes a new discovery of the old world; despise not the providences of God in the world they are signs of Gods mind, if not of his love, read your own hearts in the defects of others, put your confidence in no∣thing beneath God himself: Can the stone rest without its center, the Ca∣melion without air, the Salamander without fire, or the Fish without wa∣ter? surely they cannot; Our center is God, all things beneath him are mu∣table, and fleeting and failing, viz our best friends may fail us, our eyes fail,

our tongues fail, our strength fail, our flesh and our heart may fail, nay our spirits may fail, Ps. 143. 7. But the Lord, if we trust in him, will neither fail nor forsake us, Heb 135. In a word, he is a Sanctuary to the oppressed, he is life indeath, health in sickness, joy in grief, liberty in bondage, comfort in despair, riches in poverty, honour in disgrace, heaven in hell: I will hold you no longer in the Porch, but invite you in∣to the house, & such as I have, I will set before you, desiring you to taste of eve∣ry dish before you spend your judge∣ment of the Feast, for what is want∣ing in the first course, may be made up in the second; account nothing so pretious as Gods favour, nothing so fearfull as his displeasure, nothing so hatefull as sin, nothing so desirable as grace; beware of partial obedience,

mercenary love, pretended zeal, legal sorrow, and feigned humility, for ex∣cept your rig hteousness exceed that of the Pharises, your Sacrifice that of Cain, your Confession that of Pharaoh, your Fasting that of Ahabs, your Weeping that of Sauls, your Reformation that of Iebu's, your Restitution that of Iu∣das's, your Faith that of Simon-Ma∣gus's, your Fear and Trembling that of Felix's,  ye may die in your sins. Read well this book, and mark di∣ligently what variety of heavenly treasure there is comprized in this Cabinet, and forget it not, for you shall buy much for little cost, and read much to thy great gain: If I may prevail with thee to to read it once, thy Love to it will constrain thee to read it again and again: thou shalt find it for or∣der

Methodicall, for matter Spiritual, for brevity Compendious, and for use Precious. I leave you to him that never forsakes his, and re∣main
