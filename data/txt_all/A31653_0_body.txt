SINCE the Great Augustus vouch∣safed
to patronize a Work of this na∣ture
which was Dedicated to him by Vi∣truvius;
I had no reason to apprehend
Your Majesty would reprove these Addresses of
mine, if, in presenting You with those Antiquities on
which that excellent Master form'd his Studies, I
intituled Your Majesty to a VVork so little inferior
to it, and so worthy to go in paragon with it. And
indeed to whom could I more aptly Inscribe it? a Di∣scourse
of Building, than to so Royal a Builder,
whose august attempts have already given so great a
splendor to our Imperial City, and so illustrious an
Example to the Nation! It is from this contempla∣tion,
Sir, that after I had (by the Commands of the

Royal Society) endeavour'd the improvement of
Timber, and the planting of Trees, I have ad∣vanced
to that of Building as its proper and natural
consequent: Not with a presumption to incite, or
instruct Your Majesty, which were a vanity unpar∣donable;
but by it to take occasion of celebrating Your
Majesties great Example, who use Your Empire
and Authority so worthily, as Fortune seems to
have consulted her reason when she poured her fa∣vours
upon You; so as I never cast my Eyes on that
generous Designation in the Epigram
Credis ob hoc me Pastor opes fortasse rogare
Propter quod vulgus, crassa∣que turba rogat? &c.
Est nihil ex istis: superos, ac sydera testor.
Ergo quid? ut donem, Pa∣stor, & aedificem.
Mart. Ep. L. 9.—ut donem, Pastor, & aedificem.
without immediate reflections on Your Ma∣jesty,
who seem onely to value those roy∣al
advantages you have above others, but
that you may Oblige, and that you may Build.
And certainly, Sir, Your Majesty has consulted the
noblest way of establishing Your Greatness, and of per∣petuating
Your Memory; since, whilest Stones can
preserve Inscriptions, Your Name will be famous
to Posterity, and when those Materials fail, the Be∣nefits
that are engraven in our Hearts, will outlast
those of Marble. It would be no Paradox, but a
Truth, to affirme, that Your Majesty has already
Built and Repair'd more in three or four Years
(notwithstanding the difficulties, and the necessitie of an
extraordinary Oeconomy for the publick concern∣ment)
than all Your Enemies have destroy'd in

Twenty; nay then all Your Majesties Predecessors
have advanc'd in an Hundred, as I could easily make
out, not only by what Your Majesty has so magnificent∣ly
design'd and carried on at that Your antient Honour
of Green-VVich, under the conduct of Your most
industrious and worthy Surveyor; but in those Splen∣did
Apartiments, and other useful Reformations for
security and delight, about Your Majesties Palace
at VVhite-Hall; the chargeable covering, first
Paving and reformation of Westminster-Hall;
care, and preparation for Saint Paul's, by the impiety
and iniquity of the late confusions almost Dilapidated:
With what Her Majesty the Queen Mother has
added to her Palace at Sommerset House in a Stru∣cture
becoming her Royal grandeur, and the due venera∣tion
of all Your Majesties Subjects for the honour She
has done both this Your native City and the whole Nati∣on
Nor may I here omit (what I so much desire to transmit
to Posterity) those noble, and profitable amaenities
of Your Majesties Plantations, wherein You most re∣semble
the Divine Architect; because Your Maje∣sty
has proposed in it such a Pattern to Your Subjects,
as merits their imitation, and profoundest acknowledg∣ments,
in one of the most worthy, and Kingly Improve∣ments
that Nature is capable of. I know not what
they talk of former Ages, and of the now contemporary
Princes with Your Majesty; These things are visi∣ble;
and should I here descend to more Particulars,
which yet were not foreign to the subject of this Dis∣course,
I would provoke the whole World to produce

me an Example parallel with Your Majesty, for
Your exact judgment, and mervailous ability in all that
belongs to the Naval Architecture, both as to its
proper tearms, and more solid use, in which Your Ma∣jesty
is Master of one of the most noble, and profitable
Arts that can be wished in a Prince, to whom God has
design'd the Dominion of the Ocean, which renders
Your Majesties Empire Universal; when by exer∣cising
Your royal talent, and knowledg that way, You can
bring even the Antipodes to meet, and the Poles to
kiss each other; for so likewise (not in a Metaphori∣cal,
but natural sence) Your equal and prudent Go∣vernment
of his Nation has made it good, whilest
Your Majesty has so prosperously guided this giddy
Bark through such a Storm, as no hand save Your
Majesties could touch the Helm, but at the price of
their temerity. But to return to that of Architecture
again (for it is hard not to slide into the Panegyric,
when once one begins to speak of Your Majesty) I am
witness not only how pertinently You discourse of the
Art, but how judiciously You contrive; and as in all
other Princely and magnificent things Your Notices
are extraordinary, so I cannot but augure of their ef∣fects,
and that Your Majesty was design'd of God
for ablessing to this Nation in all that can render it hap∣py,
if we can have the grace but to discern it, and be
thankful for it.
This is, Sir, the glorious Idea which I have con∣ceiv'd
of Your Serene Majesty, and which I propose

for as emulous an Example as any Age has hitherto
produc'd; nor can there anything be added more, but
that permanency which the rest of Your Virtues do
promise us: If such were those glorious Hero's of old,
who first brought Men out of VVildernesses into
Walled and well built Cities, that chased Barbarity,
introduced Civility, gave Laws to Republiques,
and to whose rare Examples and Industry we are
accomptable for all that we possess of useful in the Arts,
and that we enjoy of benefit to the Publique; how
much cause have We in these Nations to rejoyce, that
whilest Your Majesty pursues these Laudable Under∣takings,
that Race of Demy-Gods is not altogether
extinct! And if after the support of Religion, and
the establishment of Laws, the Perfection of Sciences
be the next in order to the Well-being of a State, This
of Architecture (as one of the most beneficial, and
useful to Man-kind) ows her renascency amongst
Us to Your Majesties encouragements, and to as ma∣ny
of those Illustrious Persons as by their large and
magnificent Structures transcribe Your Royal Exam∣ple;
in particular, my Lord high Chancellor of
England, my Lord high Treasurer, and my Lord
the Earl of Saint Albans, whose memories deserve
this Consecration;
I have now but one thing more to speak, Sir, and
that is for the reputation of the Piece I present to
Your Serene Majesty: It is indeed a Translation;
but it is withall the marrow and very substance of no

less than ten judicious Authors, and of almost twice
as many the most noble Antiquities now extant upon
the bosom of the Earth; 'twere else a difficult Province
to conceive how one should entertain Your Majesty
without a Spirit and a Subject worthy Your applica∣tion.
There is something yet of addition to it, which
is new, and of mine Own, the defects whereof do sup∣plicate
Your Majesties pardon; to say nothing of the
difficulty of rendring a VVork of this nature intel∣ligible
to the vulgar, and not unworthy the Stile of a
Gentleman; seeing it is not the talent of every one
who understands a Language, unless he also under∣stand
the Art; But these may seem to defer to my own
Glory, which is conspicuous in nothing so much, as
in laying it at Your Majesties Feet, and the permissi∣on
of using that Sacred Name to protect
Says-Court
20. Aug. 1664. SIR,
