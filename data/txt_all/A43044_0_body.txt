May it please your Grace,
YOur great Imployments might implead my boldness, while I have presumed with unpolished lines, to withdraw you from your high affairs. The Church




and State, under God, depend upon you; you have given such assured Testimonies of your care to tutor up these Twins, so that Clergy and Laity, bid you welcome; as wished for by all true Protestants, and prayed for by all the suffering Sons of Levi. We look upon you, as the Physici∣an sent to cure our Kingdoms maladies; as the Master Pilot, able to steer to a safe Harbour, this crazy Vessel, the Common∣weal: The Star in the East conducted the Wisemen to the Cratch of Christ; and that most resplendent Constellation, Charls his Wain, is your Conductor to this Kingdom. We honor our King, for he honors God; we honor you, who honors the King: The King hath given you a Commission, and our Church gives you her blessing; yea, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

 Most Mighty Prince, I have nei∣ther Myrrhe, nor Aloes, nor Cassia to present to your Illustrious High∣ness; yet a little oyl in a barrel; not much, for not Master of much; not less, lest my present had been less then the Widows Mite. Christ feasted thou∣sands, with a few Loaves and Fishes: No marvel He could make that little more.
My little I can make neither more nor less; not less, lest too little should be brought to the Table; not more, lest your State affairs should surfeit of long lines.
Here is a Viaticum & Modicum, an Offering, and a small one, presented by him who joys in your presence; who was engaged to honor you, before he saw you: Your favours at a distance ob∣lige, and your love to the CHƲRCH
commands for you, and all yours, the prayers,
