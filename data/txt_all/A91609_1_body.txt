WHereas your most submissive and faithfull subject hath in some mea∣sure perceived, and in the following Treatise substantially discovered the way of greatest deceit, wherein God and the King are insufferably and most subtilly deprived of their due, and doth in the freedome and strength of fidelity in the sight of all hazards of good suc∣cesse, humbly present it unto your most Excellent Majestie.
His just and humble request is, that your Highnesse will be gratiously pleased to accept of it accordingly, and now the Scales of this your Kingdome are in use, let it be truly weigh∣ed, not cast by, and as it is found in the bal∣lance, for the main scope and substance thereof, even so, let it be done to your poor subject, who during life, shall heartily pray for your long happy and most prosperous reigne,
