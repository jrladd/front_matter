SIR,
WHEN we were called upon by Authority to National Fasting and Humiliation, I thought it my Duty to look into the Prayers of the Church, expecting to find a Full and Humble Confession of all the Piacula, and Great Provocations of the Land, and in that Black Catalogue the Grievous Sin of Persecution, the rather because one of our Pre∣lates, who is thought to have Assisted in Composing those Forms, had told us in a Preface Published some years since, That it may be reasonably apprehended, that it may have contributed not a lit∣tle to fill up the Measures of the Sins of a Church, and to bring down severe strokes—again, they who had let them∣selves loose to all the Rages of a Mad Prosecution of some Poor Ʋn∣discreet and Deluded People—ought seriously to Profess their Repentance of this Fury in Instances, that may be as Visi∣ble and Edifying, as their Rage has been Publick and Destructive.
But that Bloody Sin, I perceived upon search, had escaped the Notice of our Ecclesiastical Guides, so that all our Fines, Flights, Imprisonments, and Cruel Ʋsage from our Fathers and Brethren for almost Thirty Years, was to go for nothing; whereupon I Resolved to call over some of our Laws, which had been Drawn up against the Nonconformists and Protestant Dissenters, that I might be able to give better satisfaction to my self, and to those also that sit under my Ministry, that though the Lord be Just and Righteous in all the sorrow we have known, yet Man was not so, whilst we were Scourg∣ed with Scorpions.
That some, who it may be are still too much in Love with Perse∣cution, have been Offended with what I have done, and misrepre∣sented it, makes this publication the more Necessary, for if we are
 called to Mourn for National Sins, 'tis fit we should know them, that we may with all possible Fervor, entreat the Lord of his Rich Grace and Mercy, to Deliver us from those Judgments, which are wont to pursue these Guilts.

SIR,
We have known days of great Tribulation upon the Account of Religion, in the Heat of them the Moor, the Place which your La∣dy Mother Adorns as well as Inhabits, was Patmos to me; there the Saints Assembled, there we saw the Primitive Times, there we had our Antelucanos Coventus, the Doors being shut for fear of the Jews, there we remembred our Friend in the Indies, and in your Return we have seen the Return of our Prayers.
It calls for Songs and Davids Harp to see you come home Crown'd with that which is infinitely better than the Treasure of the East, though with that too; when many others in exchange of Religion left behind, bring thence nothing but Apes and Peacocks.
Now the Lord who can do good against evil, hath brought back our Captivity, and enlarged the Curtains of his Tabernacle among us, we can meet at Ornan's House, and sit with safety as well as delight, under the shadow of the Tree of Life; you have not been afraid, nor ashamed to appear in the place of our Solemnities, and a grateful remembrance we retain of your endeared kindness.
At your feet, Sir, I set down these Papers, which if they be a∣greeable, as I think they are, I am sure you have both Integrity and Courage to own them; I know you to be one of those that wish for the Godly Discipline of the Primitive Church, and would have it restored, that the Lord Jesus may reign with more glory among us, to whose Grace both you, and all yours are recommended by
June 26th. 1690.
SIR,
