THIS Translation of Diodorus, (the Fruits of some vacant Hours,) when first attempted, was as early design'd by a Dedication to be shrowded under the Shelter and Protection of Your Lord∣ship's Honourable Father, whose Publick Spirit ever prompted him to those Generous and Worthy Actions, (with∣out Self-seeking,) that might any ways Advance and Fur∣ther the Publick Good, in the Preservation of the Peace and Happiness of his Country. Besides the Honour of his particular Respect to my self, his Noble Imitation of the Patterns of Virtue here presented, so far Encourag'd me, as not in the least to doubt of a Favourable Acceptance; espe∣cially from him who breath'd (as it were) the same Spirit and Soul with those Noble Hero's (that are long since gone) for the Defence of the Laws and Liberties of his own Coun∣try, as they in their several Generations did in theirs. As Your Lordship therefore is an Immediate Branch of that Honourable Stock, and next in Succession to his Estate; so I hope, and have great Reason to believe his Virtues, and Generous Qualifications, as well as his Honour and Lands, are Your Lordship's Inheritance: In Confidence therefore of the like Acceptance, as from him, I intreat Your Lord∣ship's Favourable Entertainment of this Greek Stranger, (now Cloath'd, as well as I could, in an English Dress.)

He'll be no Burthen, but a Diverting and Profitable Com∣panion, useful not only to the Expert General, and Honest Statesman, but to all Degrees for a Prudent Conduct of their Lives, by Examples of other Mens Harms. In all which Respects, that it may be Serviceable to the Publick, and, as such, Accepted and Approv'd by Your Lordship, is the Ambition of,
MY LORD,
