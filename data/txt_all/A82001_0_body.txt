PArdon, Great Sir, the com∣pellation; for though it be a piece of an Aenead (some will think of flattery) yet it is very manifestly, your most

Serene Highnesse his Birth-Right, and plain prophetick truth,Third Tran∣scend. Ascent, p. 271. as is made more clearly to appear in one of those Parallels, that treat of your happy Promotion and Succession to the Throne, where you now sit.
As for the imputation of flattery, it is known, that I have ever so much abhorred from all that, and those subtile Artists of Fortune, who make a Trade of it, that whilst I have been conversant in the Courts of some great Princes, and particu∣larly known to many of their per∣sons, I have been alwayes most se∣verely taxt, of too much of the o∣ther extreme: much lesse should I dare to offer any thing of that now, to your most Serene Highnesse, who are known to hold so much of the vertue, of your most Renown∣ed Father in you, as to be better pleased to meet with an enemy, in

open field, than a flattering friend in your Privy Chamber. Insomuch, that I am afraid to tell your High∣nesse, some notorious truths; how all we your people, look upon you, as our second Joshua, in the place of our second Moses, as full of the spirit of Wisdom, Courage, and Piety, as he was, and that we can∣not at all doubt, but your successes will be likewise most proportion∣able to his; how Walls, and Ci∣ties, shall fall before you, Gyants wax pale, Rivers retire back, the Sun it self stand still, and as many Kings will undergoe your yoke.
I am afraid to tell you Sir, how we, that are your people, are all of us employ'd, in planting more Bayes, and Laurel in our Gardens, to en-garland your Victorious browes, before you come to a Bat∣tle. In fine, I am afraid to tell

you, how all our hearts, like Roses, withered upon the death of your glorious Father, now begin a∣gain to bloom afresh, and newly to open our selves, at the benigne, gentle, & glorious, Princely Aspect, of your most Serene Highnesse: No, I know to tell your goodnesse any thing of this, would be but to offend it, and to commit a sacri∣ledge upon your most precious time: So Ile forbear, and onely prosecute my petitions for more pardons still; and Princes upon their first inaugurations, seldome deny any, whose crimes carry not some extraordinary atrocity with them; much lesse can I doubt of indulgence, from your most Serene Highnesse, who are a Person so composed of Grace, and Clemency it self.
Your pardon therefore gracious

Sir again, that I presume to address these poor unpolisht papers, to so great a Patronage as yours. In∣deed, mighty Sir, if that the tran∣scendency of the Subject, treated on in these Discourses, had not given me great encouragement, I should never have dared to offer this Piece to your view, much lesse to your protection: but it being conscious to it self, that it contains nothing, but meer Commentaries upon your glorious Fathers Words and Actions, it humbly conceives, that your Highnesse has so great a propriety in it, and that it has so near a Relation to your Highnesse, that it boldly begins to challenge, your most Serene Candour, and particular Protection: and would argue me of an extreme insolence, to go about to seek for its Birth, under any other favour. For may

it please your Highnesse to take it as a little History, of your most Re∣nowned Father; who should it come to for Licence, Approbation, Countenance, and Priviledge, but your Sacred self, who are the Compendium of his incomparable Life, and the living Epitome of all his Perfections, and are growing up very speedily, to be as great a Volume.
May it please your Highnesse, to take it as a piece of Architecture, or Mosaick Work (as it is) erected upon the Memory of your decea∣sed Father; whom should it have recourse to, for its Pillar, and sup∣port, but onely your Highnesse, who are the moving Model of all his Great Actions? And may your Highnesse please to take it, as a Table or Picture, of your Prince∣ly Father; Who is more con∣cerned

in it, than your Gracious self, that are as much the lively Image of his Vertues, as of the Majesty of his Person.
Thus then, for the scope and businesse of the Book, I dare affirm it to be without exception, great and good, and so I dare present it boldly to your most Serene High∣nesse, and avouch it equal to any Kings Cabinet whatsoever in the World; though truly for the rusti∣city of its dresse, which is meerly my fault, it may not be, for ought I know, admitted by the over-curi∣ous. The plain truth is, and I am not ashamed to acknowledge it to your Highnesse, that I have been so in∣tent upon the maine matter, that it may be I have neglected something of the form, or to give it the due dresse and ornament of Language; and to word it truly as it should

have been, would have required no lesse than the pen of a Seraphim: but my comfort is, that your High∣nesse, like your great Father, in that as well as all his other Excellencies, has been ever a most declared ene∣my to that kind of pitiful ostenta∣tion of words, as well as cloathes, and knows how to make a value of a pure Oriental Pearle, though covered with a course shell, and how to accept of a precious sweet Perfume, though shut up within an abject Box. So I hope it shall not offend your Highnesse, and that will suffice me, not to have imitated those that preserve Oranges and Limons, who neglecting the rich juice, and inside of the fruit, do candy and preserve the meer Rine, and outside onely.
But yet I have another pardon to beg of your most Serene Highnesse,

which must be granted, after all this, or I am eternally ruined, and that is, for dareing to undertake, or touch with my rude hands, this most curious piece of Mosaick Work, which should serve for a Monument upon your immortal Fathers Memory, well knowing, that no tongue which has not ex∣pressions equal to his Expeditions, or a pen that cannot parallel his Sword, is capable to deliver any just Character of him.
What Language, Pen, or Pensil, can possibly delineate, that most invincible Spirit of his, that en∣countered Men and Devils, and associating the Kingdom of his Vertues, to the force of his Armes, broke through all obstacles, to Crown his inspired purposes? how he in the hurry of War, and glo∣ry of Peace, bearing thunder and

olive branches, throughout these Kingdomes, now blest under your most Gracious Protection, has happily rendered himself amiable at one time, and terrible at an∣other, and yet ever prosperous, and aweful in both?
No, it is impossible for any Mortal to do it, His own Acts onely can speak for him, and for ever will do more, than all the Panegyricks in the World can: For the Rose we know, is suffi∣ciently beautified with its leaves, and the Sun with its Rayes, and no more can our praises arrive at his perfections, than humane Arts can reach those of Nature.
But this piece of infinite inso∣lence, I stand now guilty of be∣fore your Highnesse, and unlesse your Gracious Serenity be plea∣sed to pardon me, I must perish,

even in the Haven of Hope.
And Mighty Sir, to make some satisfaction, for my present auda∣cious attempt, I will hereafter strive, better to resemble those devout adorers of the Sun, who not being able to affixe Crowns, and Garlands, upon the head of his Statue, burnt Flowers alwayes in sacrifice to it, to make their odour mount to the Heavens: So, since I can never be able to Crown his deceased Highnesse his Merits, with my weake humane praises, I will humbly offer up to Heaven my prayers and vows, for your eternall prosperities, who preserve still, the Idaea of his late Highnesse his Authori∣ty, and Majesty, as well as that of his Sacred Person, here a∣mongst us; and that Ile do con∣stantly,

with all submission, due to your most Serene Highnesse his most Heroick, Sublime, and true Princely Qualities, as becomes,
Most Gracious Sir,
