REligion, dread and deare Soueraigne,Gloriosa in deum pietas honorihus re∣giis immobile est fundamen∣tum Cyrillus ad Theodos. derecta fide. is an vnmo∣ueable foundation of highest authority and honour. O then how bles∣sed are all wee? how sure and vnmoueable is our peace and ioy? God hauing blessed vs with a King, who in religion and learning excelleth all aliue, and his Maiesty with a Queene in due proportion answerable to himselfe. Where∣fore as it is our duty to ioyne both in our dayly prayers: so neyther would I separate you in my humble endeauours. For the present felicitie and glorie of this Realme, resteth wholly in his Maiesty, but the future hope to haue these in∣finite blessings continued vpon vs and all our posterity, euen vnto the worlds end, ariseth from you both, in respect of that most happie royall issue you haue had already, and which

if it please God you may hereafter. Which as it will be our greatest securitie and comfort: so that it may bee no danger to your Maiesties health, especially that which your Highnesse now goeth withall, we shall continually and im∣portunately pray and beseech at Gods hands. And what the power of Prayer is, this short sermon which I presume to offer vnot your sa∣cred Maiestie, doth in some sort shewe.
