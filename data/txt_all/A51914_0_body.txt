Right Worshipful and Worshipful,
THis famous Town, over which you pre∣side, has always been esteemed a place of very great importance. In the year of our Lord 1139. when David King of Scots had taken it by Ms. bury in No∣vel. Surprize; King Ste∣phen, saith one of our a Historians, redeemed it with a

considerable ransome: So considerable, saith Baker in Stephen. another, that he gave all Cumberland, and the Earldome of Huntingdon in exchange for it. And as it was thus con∣siderable in those early days, so since that time it has grown to such an height as to receive from our great Camden. Britan. An∣tiary this very honourable Character, bs, portu nobilis, commerciorum frequentia, & opibus florentissima.
Now a Town of this importance, as it well de∣serves, so in such times of distruction as we live in, it may justly challenge the greatest care and vigilance of those that are intrusted with the Government of it. And I do heartily rejoice, that I need not fear the least imputation of flattery, whilest I proclaim to the World, that as there is not any Town which can equal it for Trade, Populousness, and Wealth; so there is none that does surpass it, and but very few that equal it in point of Loyalty and Conformity.
This Happiness and Glory we owe in great measure to that Loyalty and Conformity which shine forth in your own Examples; partly also to that great encou∣ragement you give unto the Loyal and Orthodox Cler∣gy of the place, but chiefly to the due  your Authority, in suppressing Conventicles, those nrious Seminaries of Foxes and Fire∣brands. The Spee∣ches of Kid, &c. Popery, Schism, and Rebellio e See the Statutes made a∣gainst .
N are you only careful to preserve Loy and Conformity for this present Generation, but willing

also to propagate these rare Vertues to posterity, you have erected a School, and a Catechetical  for the instructing poor ignorant people in the principles of Piety; Loyalty and Conformity. And indeed ca∣techizing is the surest foundation of future Loyalty and the best expedient to secure the Protestant Reli∣gion both against Papists and Sectaries. Those of the Church of Rome,  long ago  thus much. This Age, Catechism Rom. say they, is sadly sensible what mischief Protestants have done this Church, especially, by those little Books which they call Catechisms. And it is as fairly acknowledged by one of note among the Crofton. Puritans, that the shameful neglect of Catechizing gave birth to those numerous and dangerous Sects, which were spawn'd in the late times of Anarchy and Confusion.
If this plain discourse, which you have commanded to the Press, shall prove any wise serviceable to these Pious and Loyal designs, it will afford no small satis∣faction to him, who is with all sincerity,
Right Worshipful and Worshipful,
