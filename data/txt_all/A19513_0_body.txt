few who practise it. O Noah in the old world: o Lot in Sodome: one I among Gentiles: one Sim∣on in Ierusalem: one N∣codemus among Pharisi∣one Ioseph in the San∣drim: one Esther in  Court: one Iudith in  Citie: one Abigail in  Familie, are of more wo and waight in the Balla of God, then many thousa of others.
