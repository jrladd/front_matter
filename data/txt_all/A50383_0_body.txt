MOst Gracious and dear Sovereign, so soon as I saw Your Majesties Declaration of October 25. I could not but rejoice greatly for Your Care and holy Solici∣tude expressed therein, and wisdome like the wisdom of Solomon about setling unity and uniformity in the Church of England, and devising the means of effecting it. And where∣as some have in writing cast aspersions upon Your Sacred person, I could not but be greatly grieved at it, and to see how that notwith∣standing
this Your Majesties most serious pro∣fession to have inform'd your self what you could by consulting with many both grave and learned beyond Sea, and of your own Land, by what means most probably Ʋnity may be re∣stored to the Churches under your Majesties Dominion, yet may remain unsatisfied, who although they are not reverse from Episcopal Government reformed, yet at hearing of Suf∣fragens and rural Deans, they are much trou∣bled as at Officers not formerly heard of ei∣ther in the time of Queen Elizabeth, King James Your Grandfather, or of King Charles Your Father. And as for the book of Com∣mon Prayer, although the Prayers therein contained are most pithy and pious, yet the multitude of them, and often repetitions of some, &c. are offensive, and above all, the Ceremonies therein prescibed, which they will never abide to see used, although they be not urged upon them, and so the seeds of dissen∣tion will still continue in our Churches which will in time spring up again, the peace and unity desired will never be setled: for to set∣tle it must be as but on God, so but one way
under one Vice-gerent of God upon earth, and that must be the best approved of by the word of God, which being so, and Your Ma∣jesties gracious inclination such, that you have condescended so far as to consult with some of your own Subjects what way might be best to introduce Ʋnity about matters Ec∣clesiasticall, which hath been so long want∣ing. My Humble Sute unto your Majesty is, that You would vouchsafe to cast Your favou∣rable aspect upon this little book, which I a Subject of yours, as loyally affected to your Majesty as any other man, have written in concurrence with Your Majesty in the earnest desire of Ʋnity to be restored to our divided Churches before the comming out of your Pi∣ous and Learned Declaration, having no op∣portunity hitherto to present it to your Royall view; being 78 years of age, and full of grievous Diseases, so as that I cannot Tra∣vell.
And in this little Book I hope your Majesty shall see good reason to be inclined to go the way therein pointed out to prevail for the restoring of Ʋnity so much desired, and in∣deed
so necessary to promote a setled and la∣sting peace, which God grant unto us under Your Majesty Our Supream Head next unto Christ Jesus. And to this end, that you may live Usque ad miraculum, gloriously reigning upon earth, as you have been miraculously brought to this Throne of Your Fathers, con∣tinuing constantly zealous for the propaga∣tion of the true Religion to the end of your days, and finally be Crowned in Heaven with a never fading Crown of Glory.
