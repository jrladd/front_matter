WELL knowing my
most Noble Lord,
that these things will easily receive
Perfection in your Hands, which
for many Reasons are beyond my
reach.
This Treatise (if it may de∣serve
that name) is the least in

Bulk, and seemingly relating to
the sleightest Subject I have met
withal in Pyrotechnia. But in the
many Volumns great and small
that I have read relating to these
Matters in our own and other
Languages; I do not find the least
Pretence or Thought of doing
that which here is undertaken, viz.
To raise so great a heap of Fire, and
to confirm the Fact by the greatest
Proofs that can be had or wish'd for,
which are Experiments and Demon∣strations
Mathematical. Yet this a∣lone
is not the matter aim'd at,
the Problem is universal, and ap∣plicable
to the Fortifications of all
sorts of Guns and other Engines
with their Carriages, &c. and is
to increase or decrease the strength of
Materials according to the Effects
and Services required. But the great∣est
Skill in this Undertaking being

to adjust the Instrument and Means
in a due and proper Proportion to
the Effect sought for; I do with
all Humility and profound Re∣spect
make offer of this small Es∣say.
It is your Lordships great Abi∣lities
and Merit, that has enabled
you to tread the intricate and pain∣ful
steps of Greatness; and by
the well discharging so many E∣minent
Employments, to add,
(if any thing can be added) to
the Great Name of your Renown∣ed
Ancestors. An ardent Zeal
for the Welfare and Honour of
your Country, has always been
the inbred Vertue of your Family,
and which is brought to its Per∣fection
in your self.
The Name of Master General
of the Ordnance, lays Claim to all
my (more than 25 Years) Ex∣perience

and Studies about the Art
of Shooting in all sorts of Great
Artillery amounts to: But the ad∣ding
something (according to my
poor Sphere and Capacity) to the
Defence, Safety and Reputation
of my Native Country, has at all
times so intirely govern'd me,
that upon this account also, and
indeed chiefly, I am emboldned
to lay this mean Attempt of mine
before your Lordship; trusting
that it may at some time or other
undergo a Trial, and by your
Lordships Favour receive a meet
Incouragement, and procure your
Lordships Pardon, &c. to
My Lord,
