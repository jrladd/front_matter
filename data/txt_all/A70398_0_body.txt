IF Saint Lukes example in presenting his Gospell to excellent Theo∣philus, become a president for others to imitate; Then could I never (being provoked to write) have made such a choyce, as through the union of one Covenant, to implore the patronage of the supreme Judicatoies, or Courts of Parliaments in England and Scot∣land, resplendent for Noblemen, Magistrates and Gentry, by whose wise Councels, faithfull renowned men for Pieie and Valour, fight the Battails of the Lord for the settlement of Peace, while the reverend Assembly study to finde out the Truth, &c. both which to see united as to kisse each other. The faithfull Commons ingaged in the same Covenant, make themselves upon all occasione a plentifull Magazen, that, according to the Covenant, they might see an union of King and Parliament in the Reformation of Church and State. To all you therefore from the highest to the lowest within the three Dominions of England, Scotland and Ireland, and to whomsoever the Covenant hath been tendred, to you I most humbly Dedicate these my poore Labours, which in both respects I was necessitated to publish, which I desire may as much paliate my presumption, as remonstrate my affection, which is all I can shew: and to that the least of you hath such an interest, and in conscience you are reciprocally engaged, that I have sworne to sacrifice my life, which were it never so precious, I would contemne, with faithfulnesse to performe that great duty which is taught,1 Iohn 16. To * lay down our lives for our Brethren.
Let me therefore as one of Gods watchmen presume to beg this fa∣vour
of you, to observe Gods going in and out among us; how before the Covenant was made we were in a low condition, as from the bur∣then of my soule I had often declared to fall out, and yet that in the lowest condition, if we truely covenanted with God, we should be ad∣vanced, and so continue in prosperity, except we turned our backes on the Covenant: and that it was thus with us, I desire to present unto you such Verses which were given me from the hand of a most worthy eminent Gentleman for gifts and pietie, which himself composed up∣on our great victory at Marston-moore.
Cast but an eye on Iuly forty three,
Looke on poore Yorkshire then, and now, and see
If ere it can be thought in vaine to waire
Upon our God, even in the greatest straite,
Poore Leeds and Bradford lost, our Armies shatter'd,
Our men like sheep upon the mountaines scatter'd.
All hope extinct, one Sparke with much adoe
Was left;ull. and that * rak't up in water too.
See now dry bones reviv'd, see now and wonder,
Those get alost, that then were all kept under;
See Nimrods chas'd, the spoylers spoyl'd, see now,
How the proud Lady of the North's brought low:
Lord keep us humble, help us trust thee still,
In thy good time what's yet behinde fulfill.
Therefore now let us not forget that wee never prospered till wee made a Covenant; It was our Asylum when most of the Kingdome was lost and our strong holds were taken, it was our Treasure when money could hardly be procured, and it hath proved the best meanes to seek reconciliation (through Christ) with God, so justly provoked for our long continuing in unthankfulnesse, unfruitfulnesse, Supersti∣tion, spirituall deadnesse and abominations, and especially in the to∣lerating of Popery, &c. Can we then forget or neglect to see this Co∣venant (the meanes of procuring Gods favour) not above all things tendered & carefully observed; shall the fervour of our zeale be cooled by the opposition of scruples, and nice and causelesse pretences, sug∣gested by knowne enemies or pretended friends? let me tell you both
of them have one and the same end, to take away our garments from us, drive us from our strongest Bulwarke, rob us of our richest trea∣sure, and pull downe the foundation of that building, that by the fall thereof they might see at least the ruine of three Kingdoms. It be∣hooves us therefore above all things to be carefull that those that have put their hands to the Plough looke not backe: In the name there∣fore of the high and mighty God, let us in all faith and sincerity kee our vowes, unto whom we have holden up our hands and solemnely sworne in these very words, To assist and defend all those that enter into this League and Covenant, in maintaining and pursuing there∣of, and shall not suffer our selves directly nor indirectly by whatsoe∣ver combination, perswasion or terrour, to be divided from this bles∣sed union or conjunction, &c. Which words if they were written in our hearts,Neh. 38. we should make ours (as Nehemiah made his) a sure Co∣venant, notwithstanding like vertue, it stands opposite to the vicious Extreames of Popery, Prelacie, Superstition, Heresie, Schismes, Pro∣phanenesse and Oppression, it may be upholden by the hand of Justice, and so highly esteemed, that without it, (as it was first ordained) no Officer may ever enter into the Church or State; and such as for by ends take it and afterwards renounce or deprave it, may receive no more benefit by it, then the Gibeonites did for their false covenant and pretences, for which they were by God ordained to slavery. That in the execution of the Covenant we may see Antichrist or Popery throwne down, King and Parliament in the observation thereof uni∣ted, whereby Christs kingdome may be advanced, to the glory of God, and the union and preservation of his people, which shall ever he most faithfully endeavoured,
