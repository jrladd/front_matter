SVch is the powerfull, and universall
influence, which the great and
noble Constellation of your House
bath, under God and the King,
over all that are members of this
State, that none with modesty may deny your
desires, or with safety (at least of their discre∣tion)

disobey your Commands; So irresi∣stible
a force must the intimation of that Will
carry, which proceeds from somany wise and
excellent judgements united together. This
may sufficiently justifie my obedience, in pre∣senting
this Sermon to your, and the publique
view: which not any self-forwardnesse, or
over-valuing hath obtruded. It was enough,
in the Authors opinion (if not too much) that so
sudden and abortive conceptions had once
adventured the Hearing of so Learned, Pious,
and Judicious an Assembly. Where obtaining
(through Gods blessing) some approbation, (by
doing some good, I hope) they were further, by the
vote of your Honorable House, required to
be Printed: Which they now are; and with all
Humilitie presented to your Acceptance. That
at once I may, both cast in a mite to Gods
glory in the publique good (which should be
the end of all our actions) and also testifie a
minde vehemently sensible of, and thankfull
for those free and Noble expressions of favour
generally from the whole House, and parti∣cularly

from some members of it, my speciall
friends, conferred upon me. What good others
may now get from these notions, I know not: I
pray, and hope, they may not be wholly uselesse
to candid, pious, and unprejudiced mindes, since
your censure hath allowed them as fit and neces∣sary
for our times.
This I am sure, your wisedome and pietie
are (above all others) by the publication of
this Sermon, more straightly obliged in con∣science,
to justifie before God and man, your
desires and opinion of it, by your proceedings
answerable to the subject and intent of it; which
is the love of Truth and Peace. The splendor
of so many cleer mindes, concentred in Truth,
cannot but kindle to a publique love of it. And
from the sacred light, and heate of so many wise
and warm hearts, the life sweetnesse and a∣bundance
of our Peace cannot but grow and
flourish.
That this may be the happy successe, where∣with

with God will be pleased to crown your pub∣lique
endevours; as also these, which from my
private Pen are now adopted unto your so great
and Honorable protection, is the earnest
prayer of
