SIR,
I Acknowledge, that I am no less unworthy to ap∣pear before you, than I was before your Elder Bro∣ther, having in me the same duty and reverence for your high Bloud, and the same equal regard for your Person: Yet I come with confidence to you; for having found so affable and sweet a Reception from your dear Brother, I ought not at all to doubt of yours: since his Great Bloud runs in your veins, you must also retain his Vertues; and in you they are justly called so, yet they are not so in all men; for if slaves, and servants, and meaner men, prove affable and hum∣ble, it is not Vertue in them, because it is their duty: but in you, being adorned with all your Greatness, it shews so rich a Goodness in you, that all men are oblig'd to return you honour for it, which I do with my heart, and all my faculties. I also present you, Sir,

with a poor French-man, Monsieur Raggou, being party perpale Trooper, and Cook: I tender him to you in his own Equipage just as he landed, with not so much as a shirt to his back: But that is no new thing to the Eng∣lish Nation; therefore, Sir, receive him as an object to exercise your Charity upon; being naked cloath him; let him but wear your Livery, and he will not only be received, but be made welcome to all men: Lay your protecting hand upon him, and he is safe from the ma∣lice of his Enemies: And, Sir, as I am bound, so I pray, that you may want no one Vertue that may make you up a Miracle: May your Great Bloud appoint you to cut your own fortune out, and may you do it with such success and valour, that all men of courage may honour you, and the rest of the World fear you.
