Right Honorable:
IF you admire wherefore I bring,
This offring to your hands,
My reason's this, I saw day spring,
The first vpon those lands,
That was your birth-plot, and for that
My heart and hand this giues,
And know your Honor die shall not,
So long as English liues:
Another reason's, I confesse
I liue vnder the wing
Of your good mother, Patronesse
Of Syon where I sing,
And Preach, by Gods commission, I
Am sent to call, in ghests
To see the Lambe in's Maiesty,
Where peace, and plenty rests.

And dearely, humbly I intreate,
Your Honors to that place,
Where you shall sit in glories seate,
And see God face to face.
Your Noble dispositions bee,
So generally approu'd,
That for your true Nobilitie,
Y'are both, both prais'd and lou'd:
And so God grant you may be still,
'Tis that I wish to see,
And if you please t'approue my will,
Feare God, and fauour mee.
