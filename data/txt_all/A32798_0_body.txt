Nothing less than your Commands could have ingag'd me in the Attempt, and nothing less than your Character could have protected me in it.
Indeed my Hero is all Glory and Triumph, but yet he assures me this is his highest; and that he is more warm∣ly affected with the Dedication, than with the Success of his Adventures. But, Madam, what e're his Satisfactions may be, mine must be allow'd to ex∣ceed them, on whom you have lain

so many Obligations, that I must own them greater than all things, but the Generosity that conferr'd them, or the Humility that receiv'd them; and which to acknowledge, shall be as much the endeavours, as 'tis now the desires of,
MADAM,
