Honoured Sir,
ALthough I have not of late years used to prefix any Dedicatory Epistles  the Discourses I have made pu∣lick, yet when I think of your eater nighness and kindness to, nd interest in our Deceased Friend and Brother, and your xemplary love to him, I cannot
but judg it meet and right in be∣half of my self, and mine, and the Deceased Friends, to testifie our good resentment both of your love to the truth, and to the Deceased for the truths sake, by such a pub∣lick acknowledgment thereof, tru∣sting that your interest in him be∣ing so dear above others, of, or near to your rank, none will quarre with me that I single you out above them in this matter. I write not this to flatter you, but to thank you, and to excite you to have such further remembrance of your deceased Friend, as never to for∣go or neglect those good instructi∣ons and helps you have received frequently from him, or rather from God by him. I know it was
great grief to you to part with m, and that he died at so great distance from you, (as your solid, ous, and loving Letter to him,  have prevented it, if it might ve been, doth testifie) and that u will now have a very great nt of him, more than most o∣ers though some in Whittlesey  much or more than you possibly) nd therefore you with them (and hat I write to you, I am willing ey should share in also need the ore comfort and consolation. I re presume to believe that He as a watchful & a good shepherd  his capacity over you, and his ve was great to you, and though od may afford you other helpers, t I fear you will scarcely meet
with another Mr. Moore among them all to be like him to you Well Sir, we have not lost him al there is much of his spirit yet le behind him in his Writings, the you may converse with though  be gone, and its not long befo you and I shall be in no more cap∣city to converse with any bo here, before you and I must  after him, and I hope to him, a to Jesus Christ the Lord and S∣viour both of us and of him: an therefore let us redeem time, an improve it well, that we may  found in peace of God in Christ And its well for us that thoug God hath taken away this and th other under Shepherds from us
s yet The great Shepherd and ishop of our Souls, that loved s so, as that he laid down his life r us, though He was dead, yet e lives, and lives for evermore  take care of his flock and fa∣ily, who being so Great can take are of it all, and of every one of it, ll over the World; yea and be∣ng both so Good and so Eternal, ill not fail it, though others do ither through unfaithfulness, or s not permitted to continue by eason of death. He is as great n Goodness, Mercy and Faith∣fulness, as in Authority, Power, nd Sufficiency to help and save us, and therefore He will not fail, nor be discouraged till he set
judgment in the earth, and bri every one of his faithful flock a followers to the enjoyment of  everlasting Heavenly Pasture To him therefore lifting up  eyes and hearts, let us take co∣rage, making use of what He ha left us by himself, and by  Spirit in his thereby made) bo Apostles and Prophets, yea a of what he affords, or hath l with us of any his faithful Pasto or Teachers. Let us only ta heed to follow his instruction hearing his voice, and fear no but we shall do well in the iss and conclusion. My Love an Service to your Self, Lady, an Family. And the God of peac
that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shep∣herd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the everlasting Cove∣nant (made in Him with us, through and according to which He will also raise from the dead the under-shepherds departed in the faith of Him, and all His faithful Flock in his due time, o endless Glory and Happiness, He) make you and us all perfect n every good Work to do his Will: Working in us that which s well-pleasing in his sight, hrough Jesus Christ, To whom be Glory for ever and ever, A∣men. Even in all that he doth and orders to, and about us at all
times; To Him committing you and yours, I am Sir
