IT would be an unpardonable vanity in me, to imagine, either that the World needed my Ob∣servation, how Seasonable and highly Accep∣table His GRACE's late Vindication of our Lord's Divinity and Incarnation was, or, my Re∣commendation of it, could I find words worthy to do it.
Yet thus much I cannot forbear to utter, that 'tis a Rare thing to find such Condescention, such Candour and such Charity even towards the Enemies of our Common Faith, as well as to Friends of it, in a person of the Highest Station: Whereby, indeed he shews himself forth, as an
 Eminent Head, not only Adorning, but Influen∣cing and Animating by an admirable example, the great Body of our Church under him.
If I may presume to speak my mind in a few words more; the strength of Reason is so dex∣trously managed in those four Excellent and Incom∣parable Sermons, that it will not be easie to an∣swer them, the two former of them have driven, both the Arian and Socinian Reason, to palpable Non-sence: And the Two latter, have given the World so reasonable and satisfactory account of the Christian Oeconomy, that all their idle Ideas and imaginary pretences to the contrary, are Deaded at the Root, and put to silence in the Grave without hope of a Resurrection, at least, in the same Body.
The World is a sensible Witness of the truth of this, to which I was provoked by the strange as∣surance of some amongst us, having no farther de∣sign in it then the Publick advantage; no, not so much as to gain his GRACE's Countenance and Protection of this small Pamphlet (the usual pretence of such Dedications:) But I most humbly beg His GRACE's pardon for the boldness of it: and pray heartily, that GOD would long preserve His Person and succeed all His Excellent Endeavours, in the Government, and for the good of this Poor Church.
