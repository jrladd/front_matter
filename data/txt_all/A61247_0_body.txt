SIR,
IT was by your Command that this SERMON was first Preached, and now Printed; and I have very good grounds to hope, that so urgent a Reason of its Publication will secure me against the censure and imputation of Vain-glory, and also recommend the Discourse, and en∣title it to a fairer Acceptance; for it is no inconsiderable advantage to have the Approbation of so discerning, and yet so unbiassed a Judgement, as you are known to excel in. And as nothing but this
 consideration could have tempted me to expose any thing of mine to so publick a View; so seeing this is exposed, I hum∣bly beg that you would continue to it the Honour and Aid of your Protection: and that you would be pleas'd to accept of it as a sincere, though small, acknow∣ledgement of those undeserved favours, which you have bestowed upon,
SIR,
