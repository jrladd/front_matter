My Lord,
IN a season so tempestuous, it is a great en∣couragement
to see your Lordship called to
the Helme, who (in your publique negociati∣ons)
having spent so many yeares in that so
famed Common-wealth of Venice, must of
necessity have brought home such excellent
Principles of Government, that if our Fate doe not withstand
your Directions, we may reasonably, at last, expect to see our
new Brittish Lady, excell that ancient Adriatique Queene.
Neither can I offend much against the State, in begging your
Patronage and perusall of this Book, knowing that your Lord∣ship
first mastered all the Learning of Padoa, before you did
adventure upon that wise Senate: who amongst all her other
greatnesses, has ever had a principall care, that Learning might
not be diminished. When these Sermons were preached, they

were terminated within the compasse of an houre, but your
acceptance may make them outlive the very Churches that
they were preached in, and give them such a perpetuity that
Nec Jovis Ira, nec Amor, edacior multò, poterit abolere;
For, though a fiery zeale in succeeding ages hath often both
ruined the Temples, and casheired the gods, that were wor∣shipped
in them: Yet such sacrifices as these, have beemy laies
kept unburnt; and we are suffered to know those religions, that
we are not allowed to practice. Nor can I expect any greater
advantage, for the paines I have taken in publishing this Book,
then that posterity may know, I did it, when I had the favor
and protection of your Lordship, and was allowed to stile
my selfe
