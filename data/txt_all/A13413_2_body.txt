IT cannot be but as you haue
Worne death vpon your sword
And purchac'd honour, you should saue
One Swan vpon your ford
To sing you measures, you before
Haue march'd like Dauid King
And since like him you conquest wore
Now set you downe and sing:
Or hearken me, my Lord I'm free
To sing, and my song's true;
Ornated with Diuinitie,
And doth belong to you,
Your noble nature, valour, and
Most Lordly bounty, should
Be writ by an Euangels hand,
In lines of perfect gold.

Mine are diuine (although vnmeet)
Accept them, I haue power
To build another Lanthorne yet
Vpon your stateli'st tower.
Thrice noble Lord make vse of this,
'Twill tell you of a sonne
That shall shine in the dayes of blis,
When nights of woes are done.
