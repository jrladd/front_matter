To all that are sick, under Pains, Aches, Gripings, divers diseases, Surfeitings, Obstru∣ctions, Consumptions, of what kind soever and whosoever, but more especially unto all such of them that fear the Lord in truth and ∣rightness, and of these especially such as are poor and have no money, Ric. Mathew, your brother and companion in the Kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, humbly Dedicates this his little book, together with his work and la∣bor, with what is his devoted to your service.
IT is meet of good right that this my Book should be Dedicated unto you, who daily finds the power and vertue of my Pill whereof I have spoken; let all the world set themselves against it as they please, I know your experience will vindicate it, and verily if my Pill have not deserved it from your
hands, I will speak not a word for it, but what ever in this book hath past me, let it for ever stand for no∣thing, and I do attest not onely to you all, but all the world, that if I he deceived concerning the true worth and power of my Pills, ve∣rily it is you that hath deceived me, my conscience bearing me witness I have not added unto these reports which you have brought me, but have with much sobriety left out much which would have heightned the power & worth of my Pill, but I am assured from my own knowledge and daily sight and hearing, that things of like nature are done by it daily, blessed be God, and therefore I know there is no deceit in the mat∣ter: Receive then I pray you this little book into your protection, and speak as you have found, and speak that which is true, I desire no more, I know that is sufficient,
for the trueth is strong, and no force can keep him in bonds whom truth acquits; it were better I were not then it were not my portion.
It is neither power nor great∣ness, nor humane Art, nor Learn∣ing that I fly unto for Patronage, only the clear and unbyased witness of truth, which can be in no other mouths then such of you, the authors of all those several reports, cures, and wonders I have set down in this book, most of which my own eys were spectators, & consequently witnesses of their verity and truth, neither am I unfurnished of as ma∣ny more which here is not set down, but these have spent much paper for me to write, and much of your pa∣tience to read, and he that will not believe at the sound of this Trum∣pet, but shuts his ears, resolved not to hear, this man will not hear if I had set down five times as many.
But unto the two second sort un∣to whom I tender this dedication, viz. the faithful that are yet on earth, but their treasure in heaven, and their hearts where their trea∣sure is; that at the present if need be are in heaviness thorow many fold temptations, sicknesses, pains, aches, and weaknesses of body I do in a more especial manner dedicate my book, self work and labor of love unto you, who is your brother and companion, and with you have born the chastening of the Lord, I know your happiness and feel it and am made and infranchized a Citizen and fellow servant with you, and have labored thorow Christ and have not fainted, and now knowing your happiness do ranke my self with you as being made partaker of like pretious faith, and indeed desire above all other to be made manifest and
known unto you? I know although I am a stranger unto you as to this body and this world, yet I have spi∣ritual feeling and feasting with you, in and from that abundance of end∣less joys freely bestowed in the blood of Christ, and truely our fellowship is with the Father and with that Son of his love, whose blood clean∣seth us from all our iniquities, and blessed be God who hath helped me thorow all kind of snares and tem∣ptations, to the end I might by ex∣perience know his salvation, his power and goodness; and this is my triumphing joy, that my father is pleased to let me live to comfort and help many, and thanks be given unto him, there is but few days pass me without the happy tidings of saving the life of one poor crea∣ture or other, I speak as a man, and in this judge by mans reason. And now my beloved brethren as I have
freely received so I freely give, you above all other I thirst to serve both in body and spirit, my master hath returned upon my head the fruit of my labor, which indeed hath been much and long, and wherefore have I been always beaten down by sickness and weakness of body, but that I might be improved (as I have been improved) for your service and advantages, of which indeed you may make a bold challenge, and re∣quire the same as your just right and propriety.
But unto the third sort now I speak, viz. you which fear the Lord in truth of heart, and are un∣der his fatherly chastening of pains, sicknesses, and bodily pressures, and are poor as to the things of this world; and wherefore is it but that in being here you might not be to your selves as men or to this world as this world, you are not poor, but
you are rich, riches that faideth not away, made rich thorow him that became poor that he might make many rich; my brethren be without carefulness or fear, because tis your fathers pleasure to give you a Kingdom, a Kingdom that remains to eternity, eternally in the heavens, you will possess it at that his appearing when you shall appear with him in heaven, glory that cannot be shaken; and if your earthly tabernacle perish daily, is it not the Minister of joy, foras∣much as it tends to no other end but to hast you to rest; now is the time of your labor, labor in fruit-bearing, herein is your Father glorified (that in and against the strongest wrestlings of this world and of your own corruptions, and Satanical tentations and delusion) that you bring forth much fruit, to the end his fruit may remain in you,
and his power rest upon you; you know in all your griefs and ailes, he is Joy, Peace, Rest, get then to rest, cease from man, for wherein is he to be trusted, you self and all self∣ness, your own works as God did from his, enter the blessed rest, holy Sabbath thorow Christs attonement, thorow whom and in whom we are compleat and perfect, for shame be silent, the Lord comes into his holy temple, your bodies are the temple of the living God, his house and habitation you are, he daigns to supp and dine with you, and is with you and in you, stand fast then in that liberty wherewith he hath made you free; take heed of har∣kening to flesh and blood, be not in∣tangled with the yoak of bondage to fear again, if you touch your bur∣den with your arm, you must needs faint, but if you throw it on him he will sustain you; he bore our
sicknesses, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes we are healed, be like him who opened not his mouth, although the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all; sicknesses & poverty is not the greatest of evils, nay they in their depth with devine love and presence are joyous & glorious; I never found greater joy and peace, and consola∣tion then when I was in the greatest pain and bitterness, when as to this world there was little hope of life, then was their life in beauty and strength, you of all other are most blessed and happy, because the eter∣nal crown and weight of righteous∣ness and glory is prepared for you.
What shall I say unto you my dearly beloved brethren with whom life and glory dwelleth. O my heart is pained for you, yea my soul and spirit within me is set on fire with love, care, desire, indeavor
how I might be most manifested unto you, to bear all your distresses if it were possible for me, but alas it is a small thing I am able to do, but I will tell you Jesus Christ will make his cross and yoak easie and light unto you, go to him he is the fountain, all fulness is in him, and he freely distributes without upbraiding, yea he is perfectly able to save all that come to God by him; and as for me his poor ser∣vant, I beseech you pray that I may be found faithful in my Steward∣ship, improving his manifold gifts unto his ends, and therefore in his name and fear, and in discharge of my duty unto him, and out of faithful and true simpathy and fel∣low-feeling with you; I do there∣fore in his name and fear invite all that is poor, having no mony and fears the Lord in truth of heart, and is sick, and in pains and Aches of
bodie that they would come and re∣ceive at my hand this Pill, or what else the Lord hath given me for their health freely for Christ sake without mony or reward, prove I pray you and assay whether I be the man or no that I here would be taken to be, yea come once and a∣gain as your distress requires, onely as I am a man hide not your self and condition from me, and I hope still in him in whom I have always hoped I shall not be left without either a heart or wherewith to re∣fresh them, that in the name and fear of God come unto me, intreat∣ing you to joyn with it your faith and prayer for a blessing; looking on it as means of Gods ordaining for your help and comfort, then do I not fear a good and blessed success in the use of the means which the Lord hath put in my hands for your ease, healing, and benefit.
