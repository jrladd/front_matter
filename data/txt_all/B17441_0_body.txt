Madam,
THere are ma∣ny causes that move mee to present this Treatise to Your Ladi∣ship, You are the wife of that
Noble Gentleman, who is the ornament of our Family: You are the daughter of that wor∣thy Knight, to whom, while he lived, I was exceedingly be∣holding: but more than both these, You are a Lady of so great Devotion, that the world takes notice of it in a high de∣gree; A rare thing in Ladies of this age, who are commonly noted for no defect more, than for excesse of vanitie. This spe∣cially makes mee conceive that a treatise of this nature will not bee unpleasing to you: for though you have many godly
bookes for the exercise of your pious meditations; yet of this argument, perhaps not any; or if you have, yet varietie of∣tentimes makes a greater ap∣petite; and change of labour is a kinde of refreshing. The booke came once abroad into the world before; but was then so little, that it was not fit to goe to service; It is now growne so great, that it is able to doe a good dayes worke, or rather, if your Ladiship please to entertaine it, will do you ser∣vice every day of the weeke; and will helpe to set you for∣ward
in his service, who is the Ancient of dayes; and will at last turne all dayes into one day that never shall have night. And seeing it is the imploying of the short dayes here, that must make that long day hap∣pie; it is no lesse wisedome than vertue in your Ladiship, that you so piously imploy them to that end: and it will be no small service in him, that shall adde but the least graine of furtherance to your doing it. Whatsoever it is, I intreat your Ladiship to accept it, as comming from him, who
is no lesse in true affection, than in profession,
