RIght Honourable, hauing heeretofore receiued at your honours hands many fauours, altogither vndeserued of my part, I haue bin studious along time how to shew some part of my thankefull mind for the same. But no occasion was offered me til now that this booke comming to my handes to be printed without anie dedication, and the authour dwel∣ling farre off, I was bold (without his consent) to present it to your good lordship, aswell to shewe my

dutie and thankeful heart towards you, as also knowing what fauour your honour hath alwaies borne to such men and their workes. The Authour is well knowen, and the treatise is sweet and comfortable, as your lordship shall find, if your great affaires will allow you time to peruse it. It resteth that I hum∣bly craue pardon for my boldnesse, which I hope I shall the easilier ob∣tain, if mine intēt herein be rightly considered. Which is only to testifie that I am not vnmindful, nor vn∣thankeful in heart, for any benefit receiued. Humbly beseeching your lordship to accept it.
