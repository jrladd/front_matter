Honourable Sir,
AS the Sun, by the circumfusion of his corruscant beames, doth not onely extrinsically discover the vast extent of the Ʋniverse, but intrinsically foment, and nou∣rish all the particular productions thereof, by the infusion of heat; the same doth Nobility, and Vertue in great Persons, the re∣putation of whose worth, and merit being carried through the World, by the nimble, and happy wings of Fame, makes them not onely known, but engen∣ders an Admiration of their vertues, and a certain kinde of respect also, and reverence to their Persons, even in such as never saw them.
This, Noble Sir, is the principal motive, which not onely animates, but instigates me, to consecrate
this Translation to you, with as much assurance of your benigne acceptation, as if Fortune had been as favour∣able to me, in making me knowne to your most worthy Person in England, as Fame hath been liberall, in making me participant, of the report of your high Birth, and Qualities abroad. Wherefore, being upon the matter, a kinde of halfe-stranger to my Country, (not to the Idiom thereof) to whom should I addresse the first fruits of my small labours, after my late return into it, but to so worthy a Branch, of the most illustrious, and Heroick Stock of the Russells? And to whom should I dedicate a Hi∣story, which contains the most renowned Exploits, and the most remarkable, and most imitable Actions, Transactions, and Examples, both in Court and Camp, of the bravest Hero's of Europe, for so long a Series of years, but to him, the reputation of whose in vincible Courage in war, and whose incomparable Courtesie in Peace, together with his singular Generosity, Clemency, and Benignity to all persons, of all conditions, and in all occasions in generall, gives me sufficient ground to hope, that he will not onely vouchsafe to patronize the Worke, but par∣don the presumption of the Workman, whose live∣ly zeals, and respect, is the onely cause of his am∣bition?
Be pleased therefore, Most noble Sir, to embrave it as propitiously, as it is presented to you humbly; and excuse the in-elegancie, and rough∣nesse of the stile; in regard that (besides that the Subject is an Historicall Relation) my occasions
suffered me not to attend, nor correct the Presse.
If you meet with any Passage in the Booke, upon the reading whereof you may thinke fit to en∣tertaine your noble Thoughts, in some of your va∣cant hours (as doubtlesse you will, there being great variety of all kindes of humane Actions, Pas∣sions, and Accidents) it will not onely be an object of present Contentment, but a subject also of fu∣ture Encouragement to me, to speake my selfe in o∣ther, and better Language, what the height of my Ambition makes me aspire to be,
Honourable Sir,
