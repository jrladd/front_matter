SIR,
MY obligations to you as my Patron from whom I received that Portion of subsistence here at Camerwell, which Pro∣vidence cast upon you to bestow, and on me to receive for the support of the Ministry in this place; together with that Relation I have to you, and kidnesse for you, as a friend and care of your soul as a Pastor, have put me upon the dedica∣tion of these few serious thoughts a∣bout saving Reformation.
I cannot better express my Love and Respects to you, then by wishing and labouring for you that you may be Eternally saved; and no way can I find out otherwise to be effected, then that you be a reall sincere con∣vert.
I have observed for some years past, that you make it much of your businesse to keep up communion with God both in publique and pri∣vate, which puts me in a great deal of hope you are in a fair way, both to receive further counsell, and to use all good means to bring about that in your soul and life which may fit you for that glory which is above in hea∣ven.
I offer therefore these (though but weak endeavours of mine, in comparison of those many worthier labors of those Authors you have to converse withall) to your serious con∣sideration; and if these adde any thing to you, my mite will prove a mighty blessing.
The subject is weighty, and if the arguments be so too, then they claim your subjection; for you must yield to Reason, and you must follow the Directions, or else you sin against the Reason of a man, and the Rules of Religion, and the happinesse of your own soul; If you read what I have written without prejudice and preva∣rication, and ponder without light∣nesse and wavering; if you put in practise every duty commanded, and renounce every sin, and forsake with invincible resolution in good earnest, and without procrastination, those sins be they many or few, profitable or pleasurable, open or secret, which you your own self are tainted with, and follow Christ fully, and deny your self wholly, and believe in the Lord Jesus, and live Holily, and con∣tinue so believing, and so living to your dying day: Then nothing in this present world can hinder your everlasting happinesse when you go hence; But if you or any man follow their own in-bred naughtinesse, and walk after the flesh, and put off Re∣formation, and live impenitent, and die unconverted; all the Angels in heaven, nor men on earth, nor trea∣sures of riches, nor all honours of this world, nor greatnesse, policie, learning, nor any thing, nor all things, can procure your justification, par∣don
or salvation at last. Nay if you live and die impenitent, and in a state of unregeneracy and unconverted, Christ himself will never own you, nor will his precious blood be a pro∣pitiation for you; This I suppose you know already and believe, yet this I am bound to acquaint you withall as my full perswasion, and after this rate (you can testifie) I have always preached for all the space I have been your monitor in this place: and oh that both you and I, and all that desire to be saved eter∣nally may reduce all the doctrinalls a∣bout this point of Reformation into our constant practise, and espouse the thoughts of these things into our most retired and serious considerati∣on, which will prove the rarest plea∣sure in the world, and give the fullest satisfaction to that soul which is pre∣paring for heaven.
Sir, I need not say much more to you, but to intreat you to peruse at your leisure these short monitions, being An earnest Swasion to a speedy Reformation, and if they give any
advantage or help toward your great work, that one thing necessary, give God the praise and thanks.
And Madam, For an advantage to those many good wishes I have for you, your nearnesse of blood to one that is dearest to me of any person in this world, makes me attempt this little tender of my Counsell to you also, hoping that by your serious perusall you may either resolve to attain to what is wanting to make your conversion compleat, or take occasion hereby to blesse God that it is already begun in you, and in some good degree wrought, and so labour to goe on in a course toward greater perfection, in order to the accom∣plishment of that ever to be sought after and mightily to be longed for happinesse in heaven at your depar∣ture hence, which is the enjoyment of Christ, and the compleatly full and filling joyes at Gods right hand in the kingdome of glory.
And this is all the harm I wish you, and that this may be both your Lot, that you may be heirs together of the same grace which may put you (through Christ) into the full possession of the same Glory, is the earnest desire to you and for you both, of him who is one that loves you upon the best account, And
 Camerwell,
Jun. 25. 1660.
