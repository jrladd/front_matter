SIR,
I Should be stupendiously in∣grateful, should I not acknow∣ledge you by whose bounty I enjoy my livelihood, and consequently my life; by whose goodness (even when it was Treason to be, or own a loy∣al Subject) I was taken as a brand out of the flames of persecution, and set in a secure place. I present you with this Re∣cognition, as an evidence of my con∣stant and unfeigned zeal to serve you. I desire that you would receive this as the First-fruits of his labors, who is ambi∣tious to subscribe himself,
SIR,

Sept, 7. 1660.
