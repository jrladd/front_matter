MY LORD,
THere present you with a Relation of the Life of that Humble man, to whom (at the mention of his Name) Princes, and the

most Learned of this Nati∣on, have paid a Reverence.
It was written by me under your Roof; for which, and more weighty Reasons, you might (if it were worthy) justly claim a Title to it: But in∣deed, my Lord, though this be a well-meant Sacrifice to the Me∣mory of that Venerable man; yet, I have so little Confidence in my Performance, that I beg your Pardon for Supscribing your Name to it; and desire all that know your Lordship to receive it, not as a Dedication, by which you receive any Access of Honour, but rather as a more

humble and a more publick Ac∣knowledgment of your long-con∣tinued, and your now daily, Fa∣vours to
Your most Affectionate, and most Humble Servant,
Nov. 28. 1664.
