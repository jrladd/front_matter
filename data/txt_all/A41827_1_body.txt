THe Observations, which I happened to make (for I designed them not) upon the Bills of Mortality, have fallen out to be both Political, and Natural, some concerning Trade, and Govern∣ment, others concerning the Air, Countries, Seasons, Fruitfulness, Health, Diseases, Longevity, and the proportions be∣tween the Sex, and Ages of Mankinde. All which (be∣cause Sr. Francis Bacon reckons his Discourses of Life and Death to be Natural History; and because I under∣stand your selves are also appointing means, how to measure the Degrees of Heat, Wetness, and Windiness in the several Parts of His Majestie's Dominions) I am humbly bold to think Natural History also, and consequently, that I am obliged to cast in this small Mite into your great Treasury of that kinde.
His Majesty being not onely by antient Right supremely concerned in matters of Government, and Trade, but also by happy accident Prince of Philosophers, and of Physi∣co-Mathematical Learning, not called so by Flatterers, and Parasites, but really so, as well by his own personal Abili∣ties,

as affection concerning those matters, upon which Ac∣compt I should have humbly dedicated both sorts of my Observations unto His most Sacred Majesty; but to be short, I knew neither my Work, nor my Person fit to bear His Name, nor to deserve His Patronage. Nevertheless, as I have presumed to present this Pamphlet, so far as it re∣lates to Government, and Trade, to one of His Majestie's Peers, and eminent Ministers of State: so I do desire your leave, to present the same unto You also, as it relates to Na∣tural History, and as it depends upon the Mathematiques of my Shop-Arithmetique. For You are not onely his Ma∣jesties Privie Council for Philosophie, but also His Great Council. You are the three Estates, viz. the Mathematical, Mechanical, and Physical. You are his Parliament of Na∣ture, and it is no less disparagement to the meanest of your number, to say there may be Commoners as well as Peers in Philosophie amongst you. For my own part I count it happi∣ness enough to my self, that there is such a Council of Nature, as your Society is, in being; and I do with as much earnestness enquire after your Expeditious against the Impediments of Science, as to know what Armies, and Navies the several Princes of the World are setting forth. I concern my self as much to know who are Curatours of this or the other Experi∣ments, as to know who are Mareschals of France, or Chan∣cellour of Sweden. I am as well pleased to hear you are satisfied in a luciferous Experiment, as that a breach hath been made in the Enemy's works: and your ingenious argu∣ings immediately from sense, and fact, are as pleasant to me as the noise of victorious Guns, and Trumpets.
Moreover, as I contend for the Decent Rights, and Cere∣monies of the Church, so I also contend against the envious Schismaticks of your Society (who think you do nothing,

unless you presently transmute Mettals, make Butter and Cheese without Milk; and (as their own Ballad hath it, make Leather without Hides) by asserting the usefulness of even all your preparatory, and luciferous experiments being not the Ceremonies, but the substance, and principles of usefull Arts. For, I finde in Trade the want of an universal mea∣sure, and have heard Musicians wrangle about the just, and uniform keeping of time in their Consorts, and therefore can∣not with patience hear, that your Labours about Vibrati∣ons, eminently conducing to both, should be slighted, nor your Pendula, called Swing-swangs with scorn. Nor can I better endure that your Exercitations about Air should be termed fit employment onely for Airie Fancies, and not adequate Tasks for the most solid, and piercing heads: This is my Opinion concerning you, and although I am none of your number, nor have the least ambition to be so, otherwise then to become able for your service, and worthy of your Trust: yet I am coveteous to have the right of being repre∣sented by you: To which end I desire, that this little Exhi∣bition of mine, may be looked upon as a Free-holder's Vote for the choosing of Knights and Burgesses to sit in the Parliament of Nature, meaning thereby, that as the Par∣liament owns a Free-holder, though he hath but fourty shillings a year to be one of them; so in the same manner and degree, I also desire to be owned as one of you, and that no longer, then I continue a faithfull Friend, and Servant of your Designs and Persons,
