IN tyme paste princesse most excellent / religion was nat onely a thynge highlye estemed / but also hadde in ryghte greatte honour and reuerence / and nat dispised and littell sette by / as hit is nowe a dayes: but they that so do / eyther be suche as can nat be contente to lyue straytely and hardly them selfe / for so they repute a religious and a good lyfe / or elles they be suche as be slyden and fallen a syde from the right beleue. But yet there is none be he neuer so delycately gyuen to pleasure / or swarued so farre wyde from the true beleue / that can so ma∣liciouslye blame or barke agaynst religion: but that he shall fynde an hūdred agayne / that were nat onely vertuous and perfecte good men / but also most excellētly lerned / the whiche do highly



magnifie and preyse religion / ye and with longe eloquent orations and pistils they exhorte and stere the doulce delycate felowes of the worlde / that be ignorante / what a swete / what a quiete / and what a holy lyfe is ledde in religion / to come there vnto. Than who is he that wolde beleue one or two franticke fooles / rather than a thou∣sande of wise / sadde / sobre / prudent / and perfecte good lyuers? I haue thoughte many tymes / what name shulde be moste conuenient for these folyshe and madde felowes / that go about to dis∣preyse religion (if they be worthy to haue any name at all). For true religion is the very waye to saluation. And excepte religion / what {pro}prete shall ye fynde in man kynde / but that ye shall cō∣monly fynde the same in beastis? Therfore they be very brute / and maye well be called beastis / that sette naught by religion / and vnreuerently dispreyse it. And what though some lewde per∣sones / ledde by luste and riotte / sette naughte by religion / yet hit is neuer the worse / nor there is none that is well disposed & that hath any wyse∣dome or vnderstandynge / that wyll beare euer the lesse loue & affection thervnto / for any mans malignite. But yet to thentent that suche wyc∣ked and folyshe felowes shulde nat abasshe or a∣fraye the corages and good myndes / that they beare vnto religion / the whiche as yet be but rude, and haue no groundly knowlege or vnder∣standynge / howe good and howe requisite hit is



for mans soule helthe: some tyme the moost no∣ble aud excellent clerkes (as I sayde before) en∣dyte erudite orations & eloquente exhortations / to open and declare the hygh goodnesse of reli∣gion: as Erasmus hath done in this littell boke folowynge / the whiche boke translated by me in to englyshe / I was so bolde to dedicate to your grace princesse mooste excellent / as to the verye patronesse and fauourer of holy religion.
For all thoughe ye be a quene / and haue alway kepte a state of a princesse moste high / shynynge in glory and ryches / and therto furnyshed with all moste honorable pleasures & delytes / belon∣gynge to nobilite / yet haue you ben alway most vertuous, deuout, and charitable. The whiche great pietie & godly mynde enforced me to dedi∣cate this smal boke to your grace: humbly desi∣ringe your excellent maiestie to accepte this my rudenes: And I shall dayly pray: God encreace your grace / vertue / and honour. Amen.
