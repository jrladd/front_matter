MADAM,
MY happy success in one bold Attempt, not only encourages but forces me to a much greater, aspir∣ing to lay this Triffle at your Royal High∣ess's Feet; when a Woman appears in the World un∣der any distinguishing Character, she must expect to be the mark of ill Nature, but most one who seems desirous to recommend her self by what the other Sex think their pe∣culiar Prerogative. This, Madam, makes me fly to the Protection of so great a Princess, though I am sensible so high an Honour must raise me many more Enemies, ma∣king me indeed worthy of Envy, which I am but too well secur'd from in my self (though an undertaking so few of my Sex, have ventur'd at, may draw some Malice on me) but 'tis my happiness that the thing which will most reasonably make me the object of Enmity, will be my safety against the effects of it. What insolence dare injure one they find in your Royal Presence, and under your Illustrious Patronage?
Nor need your Highness disdain to look Favourably down upon this humble Present; though I have hitherto seem'd to offer it only for my own security, I may say it in some measure merits your regard, though the performance much unworthy of it, its End is the most noble, to dis∣courage Vice, and recommend a firm unshaken Virtue; that must receive your Royal Highnesses Approbation, since 'tis the same Great design as that of your own Ad∣mirable Life, but with what disadvantage imitated! how must I Blush for the Copy when I cast my Eyes upon such an Excellent Original!
But here permit me, Madam, to decline attempting your Ecomium, as a mark both of the most profound respect, and highest Admiration, best express'd by an awful silence, which confesses you above all Praise; but were it possible for some Nobler Pen to reach the height of your Perfections, the Work wou'd be Superfluous, since they need not ev'n the Lustre of your Rank to make 'em co∣spicuous to the World, or to engage Mankind in your Service; nor be offended, most Illustrious Princess, if I say, 'tis they more even than your Royal Birth, make me Ambitious with all Submissive Duty, to be allowed the Title of
Your Royal Highness's Most humbly devoted, Most Obedient Servant,
