My Lord,
I Am encouraged from Your Graces
former Respects to me, and the
honour of being related to Your
Person, to dedicate to Your Grace
this Enchiridion: The matter of the
discourse in it, out of my Duty to Vir∣tue,
I dare not but call good, though
not the management of it: since by
the Rule of Morals, Good doth Con∣stare
ex Integris, and will not ad∣mit
of the least Evil, or smallest Er∣rour



into its composition. The simpli∣city
of my intentions will only endure
this touchstone, which I may safely say
are to promote Truth, and no wayes to
obtrude Falsities. I humbly offer to
Your Graces Patronage, only that part
of it which hath escap't misprisions; as
for the other it will be enough that it
be defended from the rude attacques of
the world, under the Authority of Your
Graces Protection, though not of Your
Approbation:
