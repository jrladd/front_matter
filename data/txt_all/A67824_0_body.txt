SIRS,
WHEN I received Notice of your Desire, That this Sermon should be publish'd, under the Style of being publish'd at the Request of the Lawyers (as is prefixt in the Title Page) I look'd upon it as a Desire intended to express not so much

your Approbation of the Preacher, as your Zeal for the Subject, and the stipulation of your Assistance to promote the Fear of God, and a declaration of your selves to be Professors of the Religious, as well as you are of the Civil Wisdom: This being a Design suitable to the Honour of your Profession, and to your known Personal Abilities; which as they give you grea∣ter Power to serve the Interests of Religi∣on, so they lay a greater Obligation upon you to do it. Wherefore in combination with your Piety, as well as obsequiousness to your Desire, I publish my Thoughts upon this Subject; not as mine, but (as they are by Espousal) Yours; to the end that Your Reputation may give them Credit, and make way for their Recepti∣on, and conferr on them the Felicity of doing Good in the World. If they shall do any Good (which is a most desirable,

but casual Event) I must impute it to your asserting them; for Authority may reach Mens Affections, when bare Argu∣ments cannot: And therefore I humbly recommend them to that part of your Pa∣tronage, and your selves to the Blessing of God for a Requital: Who am, with all Respect,
SIRS, Your very Humble Servant,
