IT is now about three weekes since, that there was sent unto me, a book intituled, inde∣pendency a great schisme; as the frontispeece farther pro∣miseth, undertaken to be mannaged against something written by me, in a treatise a∣bout the true nature of schisme, published about a yeare agoe; with an addition of a charge of inconstancy in opinion, upon my selfe: of the one, and the other, the ensueing discourse will give a farther and full ac∣count. Coming unto my hands at such a sea∣son, wherein, as it is knowne, I was pressed with more then ordinary occasions of sun∣dry sorts, I thought to have deferred the ex∣amination of it, untill farther leasure might be obtained, supposing that some faire advantage would be administred by

it, to a farther Christian debate, of that discovery of truth, and tender of peace, which in my Treatise I had made. En∣gaging into a cursory perusall of it, I found the Reverend Authors designe, and dis∣course, to be of that Tendency, and na∣ture, as did not require, nor would admit of any such delay: His manifold mistakes in apprehending the intention of my Trea∣tise and of the severalls of it His open presumption of his owne principles, as the sourse and spring of what pretends to be argumentative in his discourse, arbitrarily inferring from them, without the least at∣tempt of proofe, whatever tenders its assi∣stance to cast reproach on them with whom he hath to do, his neglect in providing a defence for himselfe by any principles not easily turned upon him, against the same charge which he is pleased to mannage a∣gainst me: His avowed laying the foun∣dation of his whole fabrick, in the sand of notoriously false suppositions, quickly de∣livered me from the thoughts of any ne∣cessity to delay the consideration of what he tendred to make good the Title of his dis∣course.

The open and manifest injury done, not only to my selfe, in laying things to my charge which I know not, lading me with reproaches, tending to a rendring of me odi∣ous to all the ministers and Churches in the world, not agreeing with me in somefew things concerning Gospell administrations, but also to all other Churches and persons of the same judgment with my selfe, called for a speedy account of the true state of the things contended about.
Thou hast therefore here Christian Rea∣der the product (through the grace of him who supplyeth seed to the sower) of the spare houres of foure or five daies, in which space of time this ensuing discourse was begun and finished: Expect not there∣fore any thing from it, but what is neces∣sary for the refutation of the book, where∣unto it is opposed; and as to that end and purpose, I leave it to thy strictest judg∣ment. Only I shall desire thee to take no∣tice, that having kept my selfe to a bare defence, I have resolvedly forborne all recharge on the Presbyterian way, ei∣ther as to the whole of it, whence by way of

distinction it is so called, or as to the diffe∣rences in judgment and practise of them who professe that way, among themselves, which at this day, both in this and the neigh∣bour nation, are more and greater, then any that our Author hath as yet been able to find amongst them whom he doth prin∣cipally oppose. As the ensuing sheets were almost wrought of at the presse, there came to my hand a Vindication of that eminent servant of God▪ Mr John Cotton, from the unjust imputations and charge of the Reverend person with whom I have now to do, written by himselfe not long before his death; The opportunity of publishing that discourse, with the ensueing, being then lost, I thought meet to let the Reader know, that a short season will furnish him with it. Farewell, and love, truth, and peace.
