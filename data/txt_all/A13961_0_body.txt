AS that in one place was well sayd by
Heathen Tullie; Non nobis solùm
nati sumus, sed partē patria, par∣tem
parentes, partem liberi, par∣tem
amici, partem propinqui &
familiares, peculiaritèr sibi vendicant: So else∣where
was it spoken no lesse Christian-like. Non
quid quis fecerit, sed quo animo & studio fece∣rit,
ponderandum est. Of these sayings, the first
seemed vnto me, to Challenge at my hands A speci∣all
Dutie to my Prince and Country, which I knew
not how to performe, but in this kind: The second I
assumed as an Apologie for my weake and slender
performāce of that Duty. If my desire (noble Prince)
to pay that debt for which by obligation Diuine, Na∣turall
and Nationall I stand obliged, hath transpor∣ted
me beyond that wherevnto I am able, of your
Princely Clemency, I humbly beseech you, winke at
that amisse, and of your Heroicall and Magnanimous
Spirit, Shield me from the Darts of the mightie and
maleuolent. Your Kingly Father out of the goodnes
of his nature, (for to iudge the worst, as dissonant to
a good Disposition) hath been obserued to conceiue of
things ill ment, (or which at least might be doubtful∣ly
taken) well: you certainly being the true Heire as

of his Kingdomes so also of his vertues, cannot adiudge
of that which is well ment, ill. The cause which I
handle is not mine owne, but my Prince and Coun∣tryes,
wherein what I haue done, I the rather vn∣dertooke
to publish at this time and in this Kind by
reason of these encouraging Woordes of the reue∣rend,
then Bishop of Chichester, now of Ely, in his
Booke, Cuititulus est, Tortura Torti, in Episto∣la
dedicatoria ad Regiam Maiestatem, his wordes
are these, I am, vbi in Discrimen adducta causa
communitatis, Spectator nemo sit, Actor quis{que}
&c. My Intentions herein are right, wherein I de∣sire,
prodesse principi & patriae, non obesse: If I
faile in my purpose, that is not want of will, but of
power: If I haue performed ought herein that good
is, that same also is, Multò plus votis, quam factis.
Therefore for that sometimes noble Q. Elizabeths
sake, (for she deserued to be loued, etiam post mor∣tem)
whose fame shall neuer die, (nam virtus post
funera viuit:) For the King your Fathers sake,
who according to his names signification is, a Main∣tainer
(of our peace): for the Common wealths sake,
which is the Crowne of your Glory: For your owne
sake who are our Hope, yeald me, as the reading here∣of,
so also your fauourable and Princely protection;
then shall I not care for the faces of mine enemies.
