THough payne seemeth mickle,
and fauour to fickle,
yet good will doth tickle
my pen for to write,


Some knack not vnpretie,
of Huswiferie nettie,
how Huswiues should iettie
from morning to night.


Not mynding by writing,
to set them a spiting,
but shewe by endyting,
as troth may be bolde:


How husbandry easeth,
so huswiferie pleaseth,
and many pursse greaseth
with siluer and golde.


Bycause I did feare me
least some would forswere me
of trouth I do beare
vpright as ye see:


Full bent for to loue all
and not to reproue all
but onely to moue all
good Huswiues to bee.


For if I should minde some
or descant behinde some,
and misse where to finde some,
displease so I mout:


Or if I shoudl blend them
and so to offend them,
what talke God should send them
I stand in a dout.


As now if I make this
and some do well take this,
if other forsake this,
what profite were that


Naught else but to paine me
and nothing to gaine me
but make them disdaine me
I wote nere for what.


Least clocke misse with dyall,
least proufe make deniall,
least some stand to triall,
some murmure and grudge:


Geue iudgement I pray you
(for iustly so may you)
so fansie so say you,
I make you my iudge.


In tyme you shal trie me,
by trouth you shall spye me,
so finde so set by me
according to skill:


How euer tree groweth
the fruite the tree showeth
your Ladyship knoweth
my heart and good will.


Though Fortune doth measure,
and I do lacke treasure,
yet if I may pleasure
your honour with this:


Then wil me to mende it,
or mende ere ye send it,
or any where lende it,
if ought be amisse.
