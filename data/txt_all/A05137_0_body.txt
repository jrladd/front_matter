Honorable Sir:
ALthough I am not so well experienced in the art of book-making, I cannot but know that the Author of any worke, doth by no one thing commend his iudgement more to the world, then by the choise of his Patron: for, as there are many and differing respects, that concurre to that act of election; so hee that vseth the fewest and simplest, hath the least opposition to withstand his iudge∣ment: I therefore knowe no person of qualitie in this kingdome, to whom I can offer these my labours for iudgement, before your selfe in fitnesse, as well for your dexteritie in discerning, as place of emploiment, to which, when my loue and obseruance towards you is ad∣ded, you wil (I doubt not) with fauour and alacritie re∣ceiue him to protection, that cals you not to the succour, or defence of his errors, but the iudging of his paine.
