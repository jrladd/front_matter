RIGHT HONORABLE;
EXperience maketh Ignorance confesse, that the best composed priuate Letters resemble the passage of a Shippe, leauing no print or impression of her course: and the me∣memorie of such an improuident and vn∣fortunate Man as my selfe, is like spilt a∣broad Water, neuer to be gathered vp a∣gaine.—But doe what Contempt and Greatnesse can: this shall outlast a Tombe, and be more glorious then the proudest Epitaph or Structure: Not that there is any thing in the same, otherwise then a Spiders Cobwebbe, fitter to be swept away with a huswiuely hand: But because your Fame may suruiue thereby, and many ages to come demaund, which Lady of DERBY excited such commemoration? And then the answere shall bee; Earle Ferdinandos Widow, Countesse

DOWAGER of DERBY; who was thus farre beholding to Nature, that Loue, Beauty, and Comlinesse, exposed her as a worke of her choycest Storehouse: who was so farre beholding to Vertue, that shee vnited many Graces, as you see a rich Diamond augmented in his lusture by the workmans skilfulnesse: who was so farre beholding to Fortune, that shee sheltred vnder the co∣uert of the greatest and magnificenst Prince in the World Q. Elizabeth; and shee so ouermantled her with Fauour, that King Iames kept her still glorious vnder the same: Who was so farre beholding to Prouidence, that from a second Husbands Worthi∣nesse and Wisedome, they went arme in arme to the house of Perfection, and made it thriue the better vnder the warm: roofe of Aboundance: Who was so farre beholding to Honour▪ that shee affronted the strictnesse of Law, and from his Maisties Warrant kept her greatnesse secure: and who was so farre be∣holding to Fame, that shee trode vpon the swelling Serpent Enuie, and raysed good wishes from their hearts, who had for∣merly pretended cause of distasting.
Therefore I can be no contrary amongst so many iuditious ob∣seruers, but presume, that so great goodnesse will not be diuerted by any maligne circumstances; and assure my selfe, that your Honour may looke toward mee with a gracious aspect, or at least in this triuiall abruptnesse condiscend to a charitable endurance of mens imperfections: For Wisedome, or a thriuing Fortune is not bought in the Market, and I amongst some others may well complaine,—Fato prudentia minor.
