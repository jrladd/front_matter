MY LORD,
I Shou'd beg your pardon, cou'd I apprehend it were an error to present any thing to your Grace which comes from me, to whom I have made so entire a Dedication of my self; but this advantage appears in all real esteems and friendships, they are as much above the Ceremonies of the world, as the usual Practise of it; but your Grace has a farther Title to this, being more yours than Mine; as much as an Image made well shap't and polish't, is more properly due to him that gave it that perfection, then to him that first dig'd the stone out of the Quarry; it was an ill contriv'd House within, full of Entries and

unuseful passages, till your Grace was pleas'd to take them away, and make it Habitable for any Candid opinion.
At the same time when your Grace made this your own, you made me more justly yours; 'twas in your Confinement, where after some Conceal∣ment of your self, to weigh the Circumstances and Causes of your persecution, you generously expos'd your self to stand all hazards and try∣als, from the assurance of your Courage, and advise of your Innocence; and as your Grace in your adversity has found the advantage of an unshaken Honour, I doubt not but your Prince and Nation will find an equal be∣nefit in your better Fortunes, by your Council and Service, which will always be directed by such a steady vertue; and may all advantages that you encrease in, and all the Nation re∣ceives by you, be equal'd by nothing but the Content of
My Lord,
