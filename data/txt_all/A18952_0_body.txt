THat you may see (great King) you haue not doneâ–ª
A worke in which your glory shall not liue,
In sauing me: the course which I haue runne,
Behold, deciphred, here to you I giue.
In which I doe so punctually set forth
Euen in the liueliest colours what I know
Of those base wayes: that who so has of worth
The meanest sparke, will scorne the like to doe.
I haue not only charactred this ill,
But Actors to; that the least iudging eye
Those Locusts, which your Land with trouble fill,
May, in their chief'st disguises, them discrie.
So that in sauing me, you haue destroy'd,
O Heauen knowes what; a crew of those vild things,
By whom your better people were anoy'd,
Whose liues may now speake seruice to their Kings.
And for my selfe, let my Detractors call,
This course a seruile one, and to my shame

Say I haue rip'd, the bowels vp of all,
And to preserue my life, haue lost my fame
By such detections; but (great Sir) you know,
Your bountie, without article or tie,
My forfeit life so freely did bestow,
You bad, it was obey'd, I did not die.
This then I pay to you a double debt,
First, to that grace preseru'd me, (which is yours:)
Next that borne dutie I must not forget
The subiect ow's to Princes, and their powers.
The last made greater by the first: engage
Both life and dutie in a two-fold band;
Which may produce vnto succeeding age
Stories worth my redemption; which may stand,
With the faire memories of men: so plac'd,
The times may blesse your mercy; by whose grace
This shame and ills of mine are quite defac'd,
When vertue shall succeed in vice his place:
So that what after good my life shall bring,
Must needs be call'd the blessing of my King.
