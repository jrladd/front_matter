SEeing, that as I thinke, there is no man, gentle Reader, but knoweth what, and how great profit the knowledge of Histories doth bring to those which are serious students therein; I doe verily beleeue and perswade myselfe, that there is almost no man, be it that he haue made neuer so little an entrance into the same, and touched them neuer so lightly, that is ignorant how necessary, for the vnderstanding of them aright, the knowledge of GEOGRA∣PHY is, which, in that respect therefore is of some, and not without iust cause called The eye of History. For thou shalt meet with many things in the reading of Histories, (I will not say, almost all) which, except thou haue the knowledge of the countreys and places mentioned in them, cannot onely not bee well conceiued and vnderstood, but also oft-times they are cleane mistaken and otherwise vnderstood then they ought to bee: which thing commeth to passe in many discourses: but especially in the expeditions and voyages of great Kings, Captaines and Emperours: in the diuers and sundry shiftings of Nations from one place to another: and in the traueils and peregrinations of famous men, made into sundry countreys. But seeing that this is a matter which euen experience it selfe doeth teach vs to be true, there is no reason why I should stand long vp∣on the proofe of the same. This so necessary a knowledge of Geography, as many worthy and learned men haue testified, may very easily be learn'd out of Geographicall Chartes or Mappes. And when we haue acquainted our selues somewhat with the vse of these Tables or Mappes, or haue attained thereby to some reasonable knowledge of Geography, whatsoeuer we shall read, these Chartes being placed, as it were certaine glasses before our eyes, will the longer be kept in memory, and make the deeper impression in vs: by which meanes it commeth to passe, that now we do seeme to perceiue some fruit of that which we haue read. I omit here, that the reading of Histories doeth both seeme to be much more pleasant, and in deed so it is, when the Mappe being layed before our eyes, we may behold things done, or places where they were done, as if they were at this time present and in doing. For how much we are holpen, when as in the Holy Scripture, we read of the iourney of the Israëlites, which they made from Egypt, through the Red sea, and that same huge Wildernesse, into the Land of promise, when as looking vpon the Mappe of Palestina, we doe almost aswell see it as if we were there, I thinke any student in Diuini∣tie, or that History hath oft made triall. Which things being so, how much those which are students and louers of Histories are combred, hindred and stayd, yea, & many times, euen while they are in their race and continued course, drawne backe, it is an easie matter to conceiue, when either the description of all countreys cannot be gotten, or if they may be gotten, they are dea∣rer then that euery mans money will reach and attaine vnto especially those that are but poore, or none of the wealthiest. For there are many that are much delighted with Geography or Chorography, and especially with Mappes or Tables con∣tayning the plotts and descriptions of Countreys, such as there are many now adayes extant and euery where to be sold: But because that either they haue not that, that should buy them: or if they haue so much as they are worth, yet they will not lay it out, they neglect them, neither do they any way satisfie themselues. Others there are who when they haue that which will buy them, would very willingly lay out the money, were it not that by reason of the narrownesse of the roomes and places, broad and large Mappes cannot so be opened or spread, that euery thing in them may easily and well be seene and discern'd. For, that I may speake that which is the trueth, those great and large Geographicall Maps or Chartes, which are folded or rowl'd vp, are not so commodious: nor, when any thing is peraduenture read in them, so easie to be look'd vpon. And he that will in or∣der hang them all along vpon a wall, had need haue not only a very large & wide house, but euen a Princes gallery or spacious Theater. This I hauing oft made triall of, I began to bethinke my selfe, what meanes might be found to redresse these discom∣modities, which I haue spoken of, and either to make them somewhat lesse, or, if possibly it might bee, to take them all cleane away. And at length me thought it might be done by that meanes which we haue obserued and set downe in this our booke, to which I earnestly wish that euery student would affoord a place in his Library, amongst the rest of his bookes.
But that thou mayest the better vnderstand, what it is that wee haue done in this our Theater, and what it is that thou must exspect and looke for in the same; I thinke it not amisse in few wordes briefly here to declare vnto thee. First
 my purpose was to represent vnto thy view whatsoeuer heretofore thou had'st, or new hast, in any Geographical or Choro∣graphicall Chartes here and there lately or long since set out that euer came to my handes, or were possibly to bee gotten for loue or money. Of all countreys whose descriptions are set out in Geographicall Tables, we haue selected one (for of some there are diuers) which in our iudgement seemed to bee the best and most exact: Which, notwithstanding that it were, by the first draught of the Authour somewhat large and broad, we haue brought into that small forme, as might agree with this our worke, and that the whole Mappe might be contein'd in one leafe: or, which sometime thou shalt obserue we haue done, as thou may'st see, that in one leafe many might bee contein'd and expressed: yet so as nothing, no neuer so small a thing, is either omitted or altered that was to bee found in the greater: except it be this, which oftentimes thou shalt finde, that the names of places and other things, which in the first Copies could hardly be read, in these our Mappes we haue so expressed, that they may perfectly be read of any man. And sometime, where occasion did serue, or need require, and the place would permit, vnto the moderne and vsuall names of certaine places, wee haue added the ancient names mentioned by old writers, but now vulgarly vnknowne. Which, as we doubt not, we haue done with the good-leaue and liking of the Authours themselues: so I hope it will be a thing very well pleasing to all such as are readers and students of old Histories and Antiquities. In those Mappes, which haue their Authours names written vpon them, we haue, as I said, altered nothing at all, excepting two or three of the Marine tracts of the Low-countreys, which the Sea hath much changed since the time that their descriptions were first set foorth: As for examples sake, in Flaunders, ouer against Zeland, not farre from the towne Wateruliet, where by the goodnesse and great benefit of Almighty God, long after that the description of this Countrey was first set out, the Maine-land was much enlarged and had gotten an aduantage of the Sea: wee there haue altered the forme of that Mappe, according as the place is found to be at this day. The description of which plot of ground we obteined of Master Marke Lau∣rine, the Lord and owner thereof, a braue gentleman, greatly renowmed both for the noble stocke from whence hee is descen∣ded, as also for his wisdome and great experience. But in other Mappes, which had no name of the Authour subscribed vnto them, we were somewhat more bold: for in these, in some places, at our discretion, where we thought good, wee haue al∣tered some-things, some-things we haue put out, and otherwhere, if it seemed to be necessary, we haue put in. Of some Coun∣treys also, that we might, as much as in vs did lye, make vp our iust number and fill vp our ranke, we haue made some Mappes of our owne, that there might as few Mappes be wanting as possibly might be. In the abridgement and bringing of those Mappes, which had as I said the names of the Authours added vnto them into a lesser forme, we haue vsed that faithfulnesse and diligence, that we hope to deserue thankes not onely of the Reader, but also euen of the Authours themselues, or at least we haue dealt so in them, that no man need be asham'd of these of ours whatsoeuer they be; yea he may aswell acknowledge and take this little one of ours, for his owne, as that greater one first set out by himselfe. For wee haue endeuoured to the vttermost of our power in this our worke, if it were possible, to deserue thankes of the Authours, if not, yet by no meanes to displease them: Not to follow or imitate that bad custome of some men in these our dayes, who, that they may seeme to the world to set foorth some new thing, doe nothing els but alter the workes and labours of other men, and oftentimes, out of those which are good, to select that which is not good, and to sell it commonly for the best: Sometimes by adding something at their pleasure, and in some places againe taking out and detracting something and withall either by concealing the right Authors names, or setting to their owne, or feyning a name of some one or other, they thinke to please the vulgar sort with nouelties, that that their worke may sell the better; and they may rake money together they care not how: For we were not mooued to vndertake this labour by any couetous desire of getting much by it, but euen of a willing and forward minde that wee had to helpe and further those that had a loue and affection to these studies, not any whit respecting the gayning of any vaine glory and commendation by other mens labours. For what need we to make new Mappes, when as the old Mappes of other men, now extant, would serue our turne? Some there are peraduenture, which will looke to finde in this our Theater more de∣scriptions of particular Countreys, (for euery man naturally, for the loue that he beareth to his natiue soile, would, I doubt not, wish that it were here seuerally described amongst the rest:) but let them know, that those which are here missing, are not left out and omitted, either by our negligence, or for that we were lothe to be at that cost and charges: but because that ei∣ther we neuer saw any such, or at leastwayes for that there neuer came any such to our hands. If there be any man, which either hath any such, or knoweth where there may be had, him we would earnestly entreate, that he would be the meanes to helpe vs vnto them, assuredly promising him, that we will, at our owne cost and charges, not without great thankes to him, and a most honourable mention of his name, cause them to be cut and imprinted apart and by themselues, that hereafter they may be inserted into this our Booke, either in their owne place, elsewhere, as any man shall like best.
Of the Order also by vs here obserued in the placing of these our Mappes, I thinke it not amisse, gentle Reader, to speake a word or two, and to acquaint thee with our purpose: that if peraduenture there be any man, which doeth thinke that they ought to haue bene placed otherwise, we may either satisfie him, if we may, or els excuse our selues, which is all, I thinke, that can be looked for at our hands. First of all, we present vnto thy view an Vniuersall Mappe of the whole world: Then, the foure quarters or principall parts of the same; to wit, Europe, Asia, Africa, and America: in this following dame Na∣ture, in which alwayes before the parts can be, the whole, whereof they be the parts, must of necessitie first be. Next after these we haue put the seuerall and particular Countreys of these parts, beginning at the West part of the world, in this fol∣lowing Ptolemey the Prince of Geographers, and almost all others that haue written of this argument: And so the Pro∣uinces and particular countreys of America do first put foorth and shew themselues: next to these do follow the Brittish Iles, after them Spaine, and then France. From hence we passe to Germany: whose Countreys being after our maner dili∣gently surueyed, from Heluetia or Switzerland we passed ouer the Mountaines into Italy, which is the next countrey vnto it Eastward, purposing also to view all the Prouinces thereof seuerally. From thence we crossed the Sea and sayl'd into Greece. Whereupon going into Slauonia, we surueyed all the Countreys seuerally which do vulgarly speake the Slauonian
 tongue, (to wit, Hungary, Transsyluania, Polonia, Scandia, and Russia.) Thus hauing finished Europe, we come vn∣to the Isthmus or Straight land, which is betweene the head of the Riuer Tanais and the North sea, which is in deed the bound of Europe and Asia: from it we step into Asia. Which, after we haue a while beheld, we left, and so passed into Afri∣ca, by the Streights, or narrow piece of the Mainland, which runneth betweene the Bay of Arabia, and the gulfe of Damiata, (Sirbonis lacus) made by the ouerflowing of the Midland-sea. From thence passing through Egypt and Barbary wee came vnto the Streights of Gibraltar, which we crossed, and at length came home againe to our owne natiue countrey from whence we first set foote; like vnto a trauailer or a Pilgrime, which hath viewed and trauailed through many and sundry seuerall Nations and Countreys, passing out of one into another, orderly as they lay and were situate one by another, ouer∣skipping none, at last returneth safely and ioyfully from whence he first set foorth.
Thus farre of the Mappes themselues: Now let vs speake a word or two of the backside of the same. Because we thought it would be a thing nothing pleasing to the Reader or Beholder, to see the backesides of the leaues altogether bare and empty we determined there to make a certaine briefe and short declaration and Historicall discourse of euery Mappe, in the same maner and order as we said we obserued in the Mappes themselues; omitting nor concealing any mans name, that we had oc∣casion to vse. Moreouer to these also we haue added a Table of the names of all the Authours, that euer wee knew or had; out of which, those that are so disposed, may fetch a more ample and larger discourse and description of the seuerall Countreys handled by them. Wherefore the students of Geography shall haue here, in the Authours thus named in order, and in the Catalogue of the Authours of the Geographicall Tables or Mappes, which we haue set before this our worke, and lastly in these Tables themselues, a certaine shoppe, as it were, furnished with all kinde of instruments necessarily required in such like businesse: out of which, if peraduenture there may seeme any thing wanting, in his iudgement, either to the finishing of any Booke of that argument, or more fuller descriptions of any Countreys whatsoeuer, very easily, or in deed without any la∣bour at all he may see, from whence it may by and by be fetched.
These things they are which I thought good to admonish the Reader of. It remaineth now, that wee doe entreate euery man, to take this our labour and entertaine it, with no other minde then it was by vs both begunne and finished, and at length set out and Imprinted. Farewell, and wish well to Francis Hogenberg, Ferdinand, and Ambrose Arsen, by whose skil∣full hands and extraordinary great paines and diligence almost all these Mappes were engrauen and cut.
