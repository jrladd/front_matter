SInce your Command seem'd to suppose me fit;
To this Attempt I could not but submit:
How difficult soe're, who could refuse,
When such Encouragement supplies a Muse?
Yet this that leisure and recess requires,
Which one, of Avocati'ons, but desires.
If I could envy what I truly love,
Or rev'rence rather, as advanc'd above;
Your Life, your Genius, would that En∣vy raise,
Happy beyond my hope, beyond my Praise.
Did not this Great Civili'an Vid. Grot. Poemata. Verse adorn,
My Vein, whate're it were, might merit Scorn,
As if I were to nothing better born:
By it I never can expect a Name;
And most Men may my wronging Gro∣tius blame;
While the ill-natur'd Criticks often smile,
To find his Vid. Grot. ad Bignonium, p. 1. Patriae meae sermone. p. 3. versibus inclusi. Dutch excel our English Stile.
If I can lull the Cares of Life asleep,
'Tis the chief benefit I look to reap:
While you, of all the wise Man's Joys possest,
Out of the reach of mortal chances, rest:
From whence, with so much charming force, do flow
Treasures of Knowledg unto us below.
Had not your choice anticipated Mine,
I might have mingled Dross where Vid. Consi∣derat. about the reconcilableness of Reason and Religion. ed. An. 1675. you refine,
Embasing with low Verse that Chain of thought,
By which to Faith Reason's Subjecti'on taught,
And the sublimest Truths to its em∣braces brought.
