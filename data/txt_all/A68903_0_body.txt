Right Honourable:
THis part of Historie, hauing
lyen a long time by mee, I
haue thought good to pub∣lish
to the world; and that
especially for these reasons.
First to incite other men of
Armes to imitate in like sort their great Master
Iulius Caesar, who wrote exact Commentaries
(adorned of late with obseruations of a wor∣thy
man of our Nation) of such militarie acti∣ons
as happened vnder his commaund. Se∣condly,
to preuent least such worthy paines

should either perish, or hereafter be set forth by
others as their own: a thing too much practised
by some, not of meanest note. Lastly, to make
this a meane of drawing the residue into light,
which happely sleepeth in the custodie of some
other man. This doe I presume to present to
your Honour; as well in regard of the honou∣rable
estimation which still remaineth of the
Authour, as for the worthinesse which I con∣ceiue
to be in the Worke. For all of vs doe well
discerne both the lustre of many excellent per∣fections
in your own noble spirit, and how you
fauour men of valour, learning, or honest en∣deauour:
which vertues, as they haue aduan∣ced
you to this height of honour, so will they
make your memorie eternally to flourish.
