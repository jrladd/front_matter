GOOD Madame, the force of vertue is such, that it purchaseth to those which are indued with it, the good will of those which are strangers vnto them  much more must it make mee duetifully affec∣tioned to your Ladiship, who am neither stranger to you, nor vnacquainted with your noble & vertuous disposition: in signe of which my dutie and affection I haue presumed to present vnto you the first sight of this my translation, humbly dedicating it to your honourable protection, knowing that none will more willingly vn∣dertake the defence of learning, then those who are indued with sin∣guler wit and learning, and thinking none more worthy to receiue the first fruites of learning, then those who beare especiall fauour to learning. I will not heere enter into the wide field of your vertues, for that I knowe you take more pleasure in doing wel, then in hea∣ring well, and for that the right Corrall needeth no coulouring, neither the fine Marble painting, neither can my pen possibly pro∣cure more honour to your name, then it hath alredie gotten, partly by your owne doinges, partly by the renowmed deedes of the no∣ble▪ Gentlemen your sonnes, of whom, some are furnished with suche wisedome, with such discretion, and with such sufficiencie e∣uery way, that our Prince and Countrie cannot spare their good seruice: some are indued with suche valour, that our Countrie is too little to conteine the greatnesse of their mindes, some with such manly prowesse, euen in their childishe yeeres, that it stoode our Countrie of late in no small steede, in repressing and subduing our rebellious enimies. And though some of them like Alexander

the great, seeke newe Countries, and newe worldes to shewe their valiancie in, yet they remaine most redy to doe our countrie ser∣uice, whensoeuer it shall please our Prince to commaunde their re∣turne. And would to God it might please her Maiestie with speede to commaund it: for suche rare iewels are well worth the wearing, such worthy Captaines are necessary to be had in these daungerous times: especially being such whose valiancie is sufficiently knowne to all men, and whose fidelitie may be sufficiently warranted to her Highnesse, by the good and trustie seruice of their noble father my Lorde Norrice, both within this Realme, and out of the Realme, & of their worthie grandfather, my Lorde Williams, both before her Maiestie came to the Crowne, and after: and by the rare vertue which they haue shewed, and the faithfull seruice they haue doone where they are: Whose credite is so great, whose name so renow∣med, that it shall neuer die, while the low Countries, while Mack∣lin, while Stenewike, no not while the worlde standes. And if a∣ny name within these late yeeres, haue by their valiaunt deedes wonne honour to England (without derogation be it spoken) it is the name of the Norrices. And if any parents in Englande may count themselues happie in their children, it is my Lorde Nor∣rice, it is your Ladiship. You may compare with Olimpias for her Alexander, with Hecuba for her Hector, with Thetis for her Achilles. And if you bee askt where your iewels are, you may with Cornelia point to your children, you may point to that rare iewell which you haue continually abou you, who both in vertue and bewtie excelleth the richest Diamond, and the most precious Pearle that is. But I am entring into a matter without ende, therefore I will stay at the beginning: humbly requesting you to accept in good part this small proofe of my good will, and to assure your selfe of my redinesse to doe you seruice in greater matters when it shall please you to imploy mee. From my lodging this sixth of February. 1581.
