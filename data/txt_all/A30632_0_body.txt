SIRS,
I Present you in the following Letters, the true Idea (as I take it)
of Church-Government; which could it be received by all others, with
the same degree of Candour I assure my self it shall by you, would be
of infinite Advantage to end those fatal Controversies that for many
Ages have perplexed, and, in this last, almost destroyed the Church.
I prefer the way of Letters to set out the Notion, for two Reasons: One,
because it is the more Insinuative, and a way that is much taken, at this
Time; The other, because really there were Letters sent by a Non-con. to a
Conf. in which most of the things were said that are in these; only now
they come refined from all the Reflections that were Personal, and from some
Mistakes.
For my own part, I have nothing of Fondness in me for any Opinions;
nor do I hold my self obliged unto these in the Letters, further than as they
shall endure the Tests of Truth: I am very willing they should undergo them
all, by strict Examination; though, I confess, I am as loth they should

be put to Torture. If upon the severest Enquiry any thing can be found
in them, or duly inferred from them, as to the Main, that will not stand
with good Authority, sound Reason, good Order of Policy, or Christian
Piety, I shall soon shake Hands with them: But till then I cannot believe
it any Crime to own what I am fully perswaded of, and what I am sure
is no Popery, That Ecclesiastical Government is a Prudential thing and
Alterabl; and that the only True English of [Jure Divino] in the
present Case, is [by Law Established.] I am,
Iune 8th.
1690. SIRS,
