PHillip the King of Macedonia imme∣diatly after the birth of his sonne Alex∣ander, is saide to haue written vnto that most famous Philosopher Aristotle af∣ter this manner: Philippus Aristoteli sa∣lutem dicit. Filium mihi genitum scito, quamobrem dijs habeo gratiam, non per∣inde quia natus est, quàm pro co quod nasci contigit temporibus vitae tuae: spero enim fore, vt educatus eruditus{que} abs te, dignus existat & nobis, & rerum istarum successione, &c. But I may write vnto you (O most worthie young Prince) Deo Opt. Max. gratias habeto maximas, non perinde quia natus es prin∣ceps, quàm pro eo, quod à tanto Rege, tali{que} patre divina benig∣nitate genitum esse contigit, qui & potuit, & voluit, te suo ipsius cerebro, suo ipsius calamo, suo ipsius labore, cura & diligentia ita formare & erudire, vt & illo patres, & regnorum suerum
 successione dignus existas. Plato likewise is said to haue left it written that the Kings of Persia with great care and di∣ligence, sought forth foure manner of teachers to instruct such their children, as they hoped should succeede them in their kingdomes: first the truest that might be found, which did euer teach them that truth in a king was alwaies most chiefly to be regarded, and maintained: secondly the iustest, who euer taught them that iustice in a politique gouernment was to be preferred: thirdly the temperatest, who alwaies set before them examples of temperancie: and fourthly the valiantest, who euer shewed them many things concerning fortitude, theoricall vertues, and the worthie acts of kings, Princes, and noble men, and exhor∣ted them diligently to imitate good examples, and to es∣chew, hate, and vtterly detest the badde examples, and shamefull enterprises of wicked tyrants. But I may write vnto you (most vertuous Prince) that as our heauenly fa∣ther hath liberally prouided for you by birthright, (if you liue thereunto) the scepters of diuers kingdomes; so hath he also as louingly caused you to be borne the sonne of such a father, who as he is able through the rare and excel∣lent gifts of God; so by the penning of that his  for your onely selfe, he hath shewed him∣selfe in very deede to be answerable to those foure picked, sought for, and chosen teachers of the Persians. Doe but view, I pray you, and consider a while the foure qualities of those foure Persian teachers, and then weigh and exa∣mine your owne deare fathers Christian, and Princely in∣structions, and you shall right soone perceiue that his fa∣therly precepts there, vnto you commended, doe not a farre off point, and aime at those foure vertues by them seuerally taught, but rather in such aboundant sort (con∣sidering
 his short and compendious manner of writing) display, and lay open for your instruction, and admoniti∣on, first the trueth, I meane the most true prudencie of Gods most holy word, which he in earnest wise commen∣deth vnto you, in your selfe, and among your subiects to be especially regarded, and maintained. Secondly iustice which teacheth you to be carefull with great magnanimi∣tie, wisdome, and discretion to preserue your politicke go∣uernment. Thirdly temperance, or moderation, which he chargeth you ouer and ouer againe, to obserue, not one∣ly in your kingly offices and duties, but also euen in all things indifferent, as in your apparell, in your meates, and drinkes, your sleeping, your bodily exercises, &c. And fourthly fortitude, describing there vnto you, what true fortitude is, and wherein it truely consisteth. The which foure vertues, and many others, your fathers booke (sauou∣ring of no smal paines, diligēce, & vigilāt reading,) entrea∣ted of; which after that it came to my hands here in Eng∣land (since the decease of our late soueraigne Queene E∣lizabeth) my wits were so rauisht therewith at the first reading, that I againe and againe read it ouer, and yet not sufficed therewith, I tooke pen in hand, and as my slender wit and abilitie serued me, I excerpted, and here and there picked out, briefly as I could, the fittest and principallest precepts and instructions, and those seuerally haue I tran∣slated into Latine & English verses, euery sentence into a Tetrastick Latine, & an Hexastick English, which in that suddaine phylauticall heate of my spirit, I haue caused here to be published, & presumed very boldly like a blind Bauius to commit them to the shrouding of your Prince∣ly wings, most humbly crauing that you would pardon mine attempt and grant them your fauourable protecti∣on:
 which if you will vouchsafe to doe, then shall both this hastie birth of my weake braine come abroad with more safetie from the nipping of all busie baweling bar∣kers, curious cauillers, sawcie Sycophants, and all the fa∣ctious familie of Momus his mates, and my selfe also as otherwise, so hereby the more bounden continually to in∣vocate the Almighties maiestie, so to direct, gouerne, and guide all your actions with his holy spirit, that here in this life you may principally become zealous for his honour and glorie, then that you may in some good measure sa∣tisfie the heartie hope and desired expectation, patriae, pa∣rentum, & amicorum ortus tui partem sibi vendicantium; And lastly, afterwards obtaine a portion in the number of Gods elect children in that heauenly Hierusalem.
Ruskington in Lincolnshiere this 6. of December. 1603.
