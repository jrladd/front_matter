TO all Delinquents that shall trace
The winding angles of this MAZE,
Send I this
With my wish,Alluding to the Act of Grace.
That this Act of saving Grace
May not prove like Chevy-chace,
That displays
Wandring ways,
So as He that reves along
Knows not if He be right or wrong;
For i'th' eyes
Of the wise
This gay-checker'd Act declares
In Souldiers favour more then theirs.
Worlds wonder!
Publick plunder
Must be freed from restitution;
O rare chymicall Illusion!
This Act when it came first a landing
The peace it brought past understanding,
For though it promis'd Graces store
They shew'd no better then before:
At th' Senat-door then let us knock
And get a clavis to unlock
The wards of this rewarding gin,
To rinse our State-Original sin.
"Wise Oedipus unloose this knot,
"Are we made Heirs of Grace or not?
