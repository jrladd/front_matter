Honored Sir,
IF Lines were capable of Hu∣mane affections, these would blush, they are so mean a pre∣sent to so Illustrious and person; at least conscious of their Masters presumption, they would condole his unhappiness, that had not great∣er ability to accommodate some more worthy Fabrick to so fair a Frontispiece. The Original compi∣led by a learned hand, among some vulgar things and trifles, containeth very excellent and profitable mat∣ter; I hope it hath not lost its utili∣ty
(though Grace) in English.
Honored Sir, I fear, good intenti∣ons are no sufficient Plea for teme∣rous Enterprises, especially the Un∣dertaker being privie to his own im∣perfections; Therefore like a Cri∣minal acknowledging my vanity in ambitiously affecting things above my Sphere, I humbly re-implore your Honors pardon and admit∣tance to be what I was before,
