Right Honourable,
I Confess it was a great surprize to me to see an Order of Court made for my Ejectment out of this House, in behalf of Mr. Hughes the old Illegall Incumbent, without being first heard what I had to say for my self, but an after game being better then no Game at all, I haue here made the best I can of a bad Market, and have endea∣voured to lay before you a true state of the Case, humbly Entreating you to consider a little further before you determine finally and Peremtori∣ly in the matter, against the only Son of a Citizen like your selves, who hath upon that account an equitable pretence to your favour, to say nothing of that Justice which every Forreign Petitioner may claim.
I am satisfy'd by the wording of your said Order that you have been misinformed in the nature of the Controversy betwixt Mr. Hughes and me, as if he had a legall night accruing to him upon the restitution of the Charter, which I am well assured he hath not, and I must ap∣peal to all indifferent persons whether I have not sufficiently prov'd it.
This is one plain misapprehension, which seems to me to evacu∣ate the said Order, because it is Founded upon it, and if it had not been for that, it appears to me by the express tenour of it, that no such Order had ever been made.
Another is, that the very Order it self in whatsoever words it be con∣ceived, supposeth the Cognizance of this matter to ly immediately and properly before you, which I humbly conceive it doth not, but before the King, till he shall be pleas'd to remit it bak to you, which I shall be so far from being dissatisfy'd at, that I repose a perfect con∣fidence in your goodness and justice to me, and I attribute it to no∣thing but a misunderstanding that any prejudice hath been done me in this affayr. You ought not, my Lord and Gentlemen, to think your selves depretiated or undervalu'd in that I say, the King is your Supe∣riour in those things which belong properly and legally to his inspecti∣on, when ever he pleaseth to concern himself about them, and which
 he hath actually taken into his immediate care; King Charles the Se∣cond, of Glorious and Blessed memory, having made a Royall regu∣lation in this House, which cannot be alter'd, as I am humbly of opi∣nion, by any lesser power without the Royall assent. Neither is it or can it be thought any diminuition to your Honourable Court, that you should reverse the sentence you have past, when even the greatest Lawyers do frequently alter their minds, and the decrees of Chancery reversing one another are a plain indication that even they are not in∣fallible, whose business and employment it is to understand these mat∣ters better then others; I leave it to your Lordship and the Court to consider among many other things that appear to be foul against him, whether the King if it were referred to his Majesty to determine, would think it fit to feed with his own proper bread, or to bestow the rewards of Virtue and Obedience upon the Patron and Encomiast of his Grandsire's Murther. I wish your Lordship and the Honourable Court all Happyness and prosperity, and I pray as for the Peace of the Land of Canaan in generall, this Land of our Nativity that flows with Milk and Honey, so more especially for that of your Je∣rusalem, and that they may prosper that love it. I am, may it please your Lordship and the Honourable Court,
