MVCH Honoured and Worthy Countreymen, this Sermon was prea∣ched at the Funerall of Lieu-tenant Collo∣nell Proud, our Countryman; who was slaine at the late siege of Mastrick. J know not to whose protection better to commend it, then to your selues, who are all Gentlemen of good worth, and to whom the chiefest charge of milita∣ry

discipline for our East parts of Kent is committed. Yee were all atten∣tiue hearers: may it now please you to accept these my poore endeauours fauou∣rably, and to censure them charitably, J haue what J desire. And so wish∣ing all health and happinesse to your selues and your families: I rest, your euer louing Countryman, and faythfull Seruant in Christ Iesus,

From St. Margarets in Canterbury, Octo. 29. 1632.
