Right Honorable,
WHen I take into consideration the great Ingage∣ments which lies upon my self, and all that sought God in the day of our straights and fears, to wit, that if he would deliver us, we would perform our vows, which was to glorifie his name; and that we would each one of us move in our sphear and places to help forwards the building of that great work of reformation; now it hath pleased God in some good measure to remove out of the way much of that rubbish which before hindred; and now the builders have more plainess and free∣dom to work then formerly; all that yet hath been done,
though very much, hath been but as it were, Nehemiah like, to build with the trewel in the one hand, and the sword in the other, and through hast it may be there will be cause seen to pull some things down again, and mend other things; and seeing God hath so Ingaged us to help forwards this work, some as master builders, others as inferiour workmen, others as labourers to bring materials to these builders; of this sort onely I would be found: And therefore seeing God hath been pleased to use your honor so signally hitherto in this great service, I am now bold to offer this my mite towards that part of the work which remains; not to instruct or teach, but rather to minde of that is well known before, both to you and those that build with you in Parliament and Army; I know my Lord, you take your self to be Ingaged to pay Vows to God, and I know by your many Letters which have come from you, that you and the Army have in the dayes of seeking God made many; you know its better not to vow, then after the vow to enquire; therefore my Lord, up and be doing, and the Lord will be with you; and weare not many of them to ende∣vour to free this Land from bonds, and make it a free Nation, and to endevour the Reformation of it, and to procure the real good of all people, so far as it is good for them; but all that may be accompted good by all, is not indeed good for them; some accompt that a priviledge which might be hurtfull to themselves and others, as in case of universal choice by all people of a new Representative, &c. when a body is distem∣pered it must not have all it calls for, that were the way to destroy it self: I intend nothing but what may be for real good to all, and that I would have all have, both for this life and a better. My Lord, I have heard you so free of late to my self and others since Worcester Fight, how your heart was bent for the publique good, and I know your Genius runs full and fast that way; and having so often askt help that
way, by all whose hearts are upright towards God and the good of men; my Lord, this consideration imboldens me to offer this poor mite to your Lordships serious consideration, which is the ensuing Queries, or considerations for the pub∣lique good, and reformation of several things therein con∣tained, that the Land may be reformed, and God delight to dwell amongst us, when such Laws shall be enacted which are for the punishing of evil doers and the praise of those that do well; Then shall Magistracy, which is a blessed Ordinance of God, when they seek not themselves but the peoples good, be honored by the good, and feared by others; and if this Par∣liament, for whom we have so much cause to bless God, do further acts of Reformation before they give way to another, our posterities shall bless God for them; but when I consider the long, tedious, illaborate, unwearied pains these have had, to struggle with all difficulties for our good; methinks we should not in modesty tye them much longer to sit, save onely to settle some great things in hand, and then take their ease, and let a new be chosen to sit to finish the rest of the work, for its very great, and much yet behind.
My Lord, I beseech you take these poor broken endevours into your patronage; and accept it, or any part of it that likes, and the rest lay aside, knowing you can understand my minde in stamerings; and if any thing be worth pursuite, to minde that; but I submit all to you, begging God to give you, with the whole reformers now in power with you, a spirit of wisdom and discerning, to know the mind of God towards this poor Nation, and the Saints therein, and to pursue the fulfilling that will and minde of his; which is the desire and prayers of the weakest and unworthiest of all that intermedles in such waighty affairs.
