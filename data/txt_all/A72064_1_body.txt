SIR, you are the highest Iusticer in this land, or next the highest. And therefore this peece of my labour if it be worth so much, I thinke fit to dedi∣cate to your Honor. In this garden of English iustice you are a principall gardiner, where euery subiect should be a weeder; to pull vp that by the roote, which makes you endlesse worke. This roote of Auarice is not so great but the compasse of a heart containes it. The biggest man hath no bigger plat to weed in: and yet your Lordsh. findes to your paines, that it is not done, and perhaps neuer lesse done. You can doe no more but cut it downe as it growes hurtfull: yet vp it comes againe like Hydraes heads. If I can weede it in my selfe, which J cannot well say; and can shew an other how, which J dare say: let no man despise an admonishing brother, that speakes in Gods name, and his countries, & vnder your Lordships correction. My proiect J doubt not will be well pleasing, if it want not well hand∣ling. So, wishing you all the blessings of the Patriarke Ioseph, I humbly take leaue of Your Lordship.
