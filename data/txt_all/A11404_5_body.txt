IF will and skill were true correlatiues.
Thy worth should neuer want dese ;
For in vnflattering superlatiues
I would thy vertues tell, thy credit raise.


Thou floure of courtesie, that dost embrace
With both thine armes each wel-deseruing spirit;
Heaping the fauours of thy bounteous grace,
Where neuer-erring iudgement findeth merit;


I will not venture in a daring vaine,
To reckon vp thy each praise-worthie part;
They are too many for so short a straine,
But sith my heart is better then my art,
Let Winters heart obtaine this boone of thee,
This Winter-fruit yscorned may not be.




Scinduntur vestes, gemmae franguntur & aurum,
Carmina quam tribuent fama perennis erit.
