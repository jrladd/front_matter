TO thee brave Mayres whose spirit's not confin'd
Within the limits of a cowards minde,
For as the Elements of fire and water,
When as they meet do strive which shall be greater,
So feare and valour in a souldiers brest,
Do strive in volentars, and some thats prest,
But like a flash of lightning valour did
Put life in thee, when feare struck others dead,
In a good cause valour made thee resolu'd,
To venter forth which made thee be extold,
And what thy youth perform'd in field and town,
Now crowns thy age with honour and renown,
To try the worst of ills thou tookst a pride,
As this Book shews which cannot be denide,
Hard lodging, hunger, cold, could not displant thee,
Nor yet grim death himself could ever daunt thee,
When cowards fled, and some that staid prov'd base,
Thou stout didst brave King Hunger to his face,
Thy daring heart did clime the Alps so high,
Not high enough for thee, I grieve that I
Want matter to extoll thee as I should,
Whose name deserveth to be writ in gold.
The losing of Breda is thy relating,
The Ile of Ree which set the French a prating:

That though our men were beaten from that coast,
Thou shew'st the French have no great cause to
And since to talk of wars is thy delight:
All the Bohemian wars thou dost recite, boast,
Thou being an eye-witnesse of these things,
The news unto thy native Country brings.
Rest (worthy man) from all thy pains and toyles,
For age, we know, the stoutest souldier foyles.
