SIR;
IT was not yet my hap to be tendered the new
Oaths, but supposing that at some time it may,
since in the last Sessions of Parliament there were
Agitations for barring all Persons from Voices in Ele∣ctions
of Members for Parliament, and from Practice
in their Professions, besides the Penalties of this Sta∣tute,
and Paiment of double Taxes, in case of refu∣sing
to Swear, and Declare, as by this Act is required;
These and some other Considerations (needless to par∣ticularize)
put me on search into the Quality and Sense
of these Oaths, with the Duty and Lawfulness of taking
or refusing them. And first I observed, that in these
Oaths there is no declaring or swearing to the King's
Supremacy, in any Things or Causes, nor a Renuncia∣tion
of the Rights or Titles of any other Person, nor a
Promise of Faith and Allegiance to the present Prince's
Heirs and lawful Successors, nor an Acknowledgment
before God and the World of the King's lawful Title to
this Realm, nor a swearing to the plain and common
Sense of the Words; all which were Parts of the for∣mer

Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, and might
have raised Scruples, if inserted in these, that are
now frivolous. I likewise observe, that the non∣jurat
Protestants and the Catholicks are not by the same
Reasons induced to refuse to take these Oaths, the one
having sworn the former, the latter generally refusing
them. On the whole I have made the Reflections,
which I herewith present to you, my truly dear Friend.
I will not affirm to you, that I am so fully satisfied in
this Enquiry, as that I am resolved to take these Oaths,
when required so to do; nor will I conceal from you,
that my private Opinion is, that I may, as a sound
Catholick, with a safe Conscience, without Hazard of
Salvation, both take these new Oaths, and subscribe the
Declaration now framed by Parliament. The Matters
therein contained are entirely within the Consideration of
the Laws of the Kingdom, without any relation to the
Mysteries of Faith; and therefore I believe you a compe∣tent
and proper Iudg herein, and earnestly request you to
give me your Thoughts hereof. I would not that it
should be said of me, Incidit in Scillam qui vult
vitare Charibdim. I resolve to be governed by your
Sentiments of this Affair, and ever to acknowledg to
the World, that I very much honour you, and am,
SIR,
1st May, 1695.
