SIR,
I Know Addresses of this Nature are com∣monly
founded on Flattery; and when In∣terest
guides the Pen, (without a just esteem
free from a Mercenary end) 'tis hard to avoid
it. 'Tis easier to be an Author then a Judge,
and harder to be Impartial in Commendation then
either: For where the known verity of the Cha∣racter
proves its Title to Applause, the Nicety
is so great, that the Admirer must approach
with such a decent Respect, that the Patron may
not have more or less praise then is requisite, and
then the Writer may defie Censure.
I know not which is the greatest Pleasure in
others, That of receiving Favours, or acknow∣ledging
of 'em; But in me the latter exceeds
the first. And as your Honour was never back∣ward
in serving the poorest Petitioner, I hope
you will not be shye of receiving the thanks of
your humblest Admirer.

It has been the greatest part of your Satis∣faction
to be in Power to serve your Friends;
nor is it possible any Advantage or Preferment
could corrupt you into the forgetfulness of 'em.
All your Favours come from you so easie, so
free from State, or Expectation of Attendance
from those you assist, that a man would almost
wish to want, only to be obliged by so much
goodness.
What you now possess was accepted for
the benefit of the Publick, not the Profit of the
Employment: And the People are safest when
the Affairs of the Nation are manag'd by those
who are above Bribes, and have not their For∣tunes
to make out of 'em.
Much more may be said, but the World is
so very sensible of the Honour, Generosity, and
Worthiness, which attend you, That my weak
Panegirick would sound like a Tale ill and twice
told to a Person who had both heard, and could
deliver it better. I only wish I may never lose
the Happiness I now enjoy, in subscribing my
self
