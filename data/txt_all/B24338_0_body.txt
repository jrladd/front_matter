DEAR FRIENDS,
UPon the serious consideration of that which the Lord spoke to us by Moses; touching our obedience to the Morall Law: How exact we should be to keep it in our hearts; and to teach it to our Children: Recorded for our learning in Deuteronomie Chap. 6. vers. 6, 7, 8, 9. And also our duty to command our Children to observe and do all the words of the Law Deut. 32.46. I here present you with a short narrative of the Contents of the History of the five Books of Moses, although in a plain and simple dresse; yet my de∣sign is that it may be usefull to all sorts of People, especially to young persons, that desire in obedience to set their faces towards Sion.
And although there is but a touch upon the Contents of the said Books, composed in so many verses as there is Chapters in each Book: yet
 upon the serious view of the Number of the verse thou readest, thou mayest turn thyself to the Scripture for thy satisfaction, and near or about that Chapter answerable to that verse in Num∣ber, thou mayest be hold the whole matter. If this poor Mite of myne, cast into the rich Treasury of this Kingdome, shall find acceptance of my Christian Friends, I shall accompt it as a rich honour from the God of all mercies, that hath so far inabled me in the work. And shall follow this my poor labour, with my heartly prayers for the whole Israell of God, while I remain in this body.
