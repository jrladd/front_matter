AMongst other Neglects preiudiciall to this State, I haue observed, that many the worthy and Heroyque Acts of our Nation, haue beene buried and forgotten: The Actors themselues being desirous to shunne emulati∣on in publishing them, and those which ouerlived them, fearefull to adde, or to dimnish from the Actors worth, Iudgement, and valour; haue forborne to write them: By which, succeeding ages haue beene deprived of the Fruits, which might haue beene gathered out of their Experience, had they beene committed to Record. To avoyd this Neglect, and for the Good of my Country, I haue thought it my duty to pub∣lish the Observations of my South-sea-Voyage; and for that vn∣to your Highnesse, you Heires, and Successors, it is most likely to be advantagious, (hauing brought on me no∣thing but losse and misery) I am bold to vse your Name, a protection vnto it, and to offer it with all hum∣blenes and duty to your Highnesse approbation, which if it purchase, I haue attained my desire, which shall ever ayme to performe dutie.
