Right Worshipfull;
THough I am very much obli∣ged
to the Authour of this
Book, and other friends, for
whose sake I translated it; yet
I am to none more than unto You,
whose bounty enabled me: of which I
have been a partaker, untill the yeare last
passed, ever since the fifth of my age,
through my education at S. Pauls Schole.
And that it is not still continued to me, is
not any cause in You, but my superan∣nuation.
Thus (though my catalogue be short)
I have reckoned up almost all the friends
I have living; which (as my books) I
ever desired might be few and good; if
they be not, it shall never be my fault.

And with You, (whom I number
among the chief of them) I here deal as
Sinaeta in the Persian story did with Ar∣taxerxes;
who knowing it was the cu∣stome
of the Countrey to offer the King
somewhat, each time he rid abroad, meet∣ing
him accidentally, and having no∣thing
in readinesse, ran to the river-side,
where snatching up his hands full of wa∣ter,
he presented it to his Soveraigne,
crying, 
Who considering the gratefull mind
wherewith it came, graciously accepted it.
If You shall, in like manner, vouchsafe
to look upon this small book; which is
presented (with the same affection, and
with my hearty prayers to God for the
continuance of His Blessings on You, and
your Munificence to poor Students) as
a tender of my many humble thanks,
which I shall ever acknowledge due to
You, I shall think it (next to the glory of
God, and conversion of souls) the greatest
reward to this devoir, that can be hoped
for, by

Christs-Coll. Cambr. Aug. 2. 1653.
