My LORD,
THO' I have no reason to be inamourd with the Proceedings in Westminster-Hall, having from thence been grievously harassd by a causeless, expensive, litigious and tedious Process, and sufferd great Hardship, even by the Confession of my Adversaries, yet I have a Profound Veneration for all Learned, Honest, Upright and Impartial Iudges, amongst whom Your Lordship may justly challenge the Chiefest Place, as it is notoriously known, and grate∣fully ownd by the whole Kingdom; And cannot but be True, for, The Voice of the People is the Voice of God.

It is upon this Account only, that I presume to Dedicate this small Treatise to Your Lordship, begging your Pardon for this Boldness, proceed∣ing from one, who has no other Knowledge of Your Lordship, than by Hear-say, and Report.
But from what manner of Report? Not an uncertain Rumour, whisperd in Corners, by a Few Partial, Bribd, and Servile Flat∣terers; But Proclaimd Aloud in the Market-Places, by an Universal, Irresistible, Uncon∣tradicted Blast of Fame, and Supported by the Concurrent Suffrages of All Wise, Lear∣ned, Vertuous, and Just Men.
My Lord,
I am sensible, that I injure the Public, in so long detaining Your Lordship from doing Good, in your Eminent Station.
I am, My LORD,
