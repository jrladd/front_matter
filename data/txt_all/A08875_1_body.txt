PRomise is debt (worshipfull
Syr) as the Prouerbe auou∣cheth,
and debt must needes
be paide, as reason requireth:
the one not arguing so much
liberalitie in speech, as the o∣ther
doth vertue in accomplishing. When I
presented ye my first part of Palmerin of Eng∣land,
I promised to hasten these likewise that
should preceede it: because this Historie of
Palmerin d'Oliua, is the beginning and in∣ducement
to all those that followe thereon.
Wherfore hauing sent ye the first, so likewise
doe I now the seconde, and will make what
speede I can in translating the third and last,

if your kinde fauour spurre me on, as I doubt
not but it will. So still remaining yours (euen
to my vttermost,) I humbly take my leaue,
this first of August.
