MOst loving Friends, to you I do indite
This my small Journal, you being in sight
Of what is mention'd in it: Don't expect
Here Signs and Tangents, or a Course direct
Unto this Island: If so, I a fool
Should be by you accounted, in the School
Of Mathematicks never being bred,
Nor ever heard Mysterious Lectures read
Concerning Navigation: Idle times
Was the true Product of these foolish Rhimes,
Which craves Acceptance from your friendly hand,
By him who is your Friend for to command,
