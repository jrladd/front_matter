AS our men do more willingly go to warfare / and fyght with greater cou∣rage agaynst straungers / then agaynst theyr countreymen: so it is with me in thys spirituall warfare. For I would haue wyshed that thys contro∣uersy had bene with the Papystes / or with other (if any can be) more pe∣stylent and professed ennemyes of the church: for that should haue bene les griefe to wryte / and more conuement to perswade that which I desire. For as the very name of an ennemy doth kyndle the desire of fyghting / and stirreth vp the care of preparing the furniture for the warre: So I can not tell how it com∣meth to passe / that the name of a brother staketh that courage / and abateth that carefulnes which should be bestowed in desence of the truth. But seeing the truth ought not to be forsaken for any mans cause / I enforced my selfe / considering that if the Lord myght lay it to my charge / that I was not for certayne conside∣rations so ready as I ought to haue bene to publyshe the truth / he myght more iustly condemne me / if being oppugned and slaundered by others / I should not according to that measure which he hath dealte vnto me / and for my small haby∣litie defend it / and delyuer it from the euill report that some endeuor to bring vpon it. And as vnto other partes of the gospell / so sone as the Lord openeth a dore for them to enter in / there is for the most part great resistance: so in thys part concer∣ning the gouernment and dyscipline of the church / which is the order which God hath left / as well to make the doctryne most effectuall / and to geue as it were a sharper edge vnto the preaching of the word / as also to be a wall to keepe it / and make it contynue among vs / I see there be sondry lettes / which doe as it were with weapons stande vp to stoppe the passage / and to hynder that it should not be setled amongst vs. With the which albeit I wrastle hande to hande in thys booke / yet for as much as we haue all dronke so deepe of the cuppe of vntruth / that we do not only stumble at blockes / which other men lay in our way / but of∣tentymes we gather lettes vnto our selues in framyng a preiudice agaynst the truth: I thought good to note shortly what those stumbling blockes are / and al∣though I can not remoue them / yet to geue warning of them / and to lende my hand to the weaker and simpler sort to helpe to ouerstride them.
The offences which are taken herein / be eyther in respect of the cause / or in respect of those / which seeke to defend / and promote the cause. The cause is char∣ged first with newnes / and strangenes / then as author of confusion / and of disor∣der / and last of all as enemy to princes / magistrates / and common wealthes. For the first / besides that it is no sufficient chalenge / to say it is new & strange / there is no cause why it should be counted new / which is confessed of those which mis∣lyke it / to haue bene for the most part / vsed in the Apostles tymes / nor why it should be esteemed straunge / which is vsed now farre / and neare / of thys & that side the sea / and of no strangers / but of those which are of the housholde of fayth. And it shall more largely appeare in thys Booke / that thys is no innouation / but a renouation / and the doctrine not new / but renued / no stranger / but borne in Si∣on / whereunto (it being before vniustly banyshed) ought now of ryght to bee restored.
And of confusion & dysorder it is yet more vntruely accused. For iustice may be as well accused for doing wrong / as thys doctryne / for bringing in disorder / whose whole worke is to prouyde / that nothing be done out of place / out of time / or otherwise / then the condytion of euery mans calling will beare: which putteth the people in subiection vnder their gouernoures / the gouernoures in degree / and
 order one vnder an other / as the Elder / vnderneath the Pastor / and the Dea∣con / vnderneath the Elder / whych teacheth / that a Particuler church / shall giue place vnto a Prouinciall synode / where many churches are / and the Prouincial / to a Nationall / and likewyse that / vnto the Generall / if anye be / and all vnto Christe / and his worde. When on the contrary parte / those whych stand against thys doctrine / are thereby compelled to bryng into the church great confusion / and maruellous disorder / whilest the pastors office is confounded wyth the dea∣cons / whilest women do minister the sacraments / whych is lawful only for men: whilest priuate men do that / whych belongeth vnto publicke persons: whilest publicke actions / are done in priuate places: whilest the church / is shuffled wyth the common wealth: whilest ciuill matters / are handled by Ecclesiasticall per∣sons / and Ecclesiasticall / by those whych be ciuill: and to be short / whilest no of∣ficer of the church keepeth his standing / and one member doth take vpon it / the office of an other. Which things as they hazard the arme / and destroy the body: so they do presently hinder / and will shortly (if remeady be not prouided) vtterly ouerthrowe the churche. And therefore onles good order be in that whych was brought into the church by poperye / and confusion in that whych was left vnto the church by the Apostles / and that it be order / that publike actions / should be done in priuate places / by priuate persons / and by women / that is appoynted to be done by men / and confusion / when the contrary is obserued / and finally / onles order / haue an other definition or nature / then hitherto hath bene read / or heard of / there is no cause / why this doctrine which containeth the discipline / and go∣uernment of the churche / should be thus shamefully slaundered wyth confusion / and disorder.
For the third poynt / whych is / that it is an enemy to magistrates / and the common wealth: if it be enough to accuse wythout proufe / to say and shewe no reason / innocency it selfe shall not be giltles. Thys doctrine was in times past / euen by their confession / which wryte against it / a friend vnto princes and magi∣strates / when princes / and magistrates were enemies vnto it: and can it nowe be an enemy vnto princes / and magistrates / whych are frendes vnto it? It helped / and vpholded the common wealths / whych were gouerned by tyrantes / and can it hinder those / whych are gouerned by godly princes? And in what is it an en∣nemy to princes / and magistrates? Note the variance / set downe the enemitie. If the question be / whether princes / and magistrates be necessary in the church / it holdeth / that the vse of them / is more then of the sunne / wythout the whych the world cā not stand. I fit be of their honor / it holdeth / that wyth humble sub∣nussion of minde / the outward also of the body / yea the body it selfe / and all that it hath / if nede so require / are to be yelded / for the defence of the prince / and for that seruice / for the whych the prince will vse them vnto / for the glory of God / and maintenance of the common wealth. If it be asked of the obedience due vnto the prince / and vnto the magistrate / it answeareth that all obedience in the Lord / is to be rendred: and if it come to passe / that any other be asked / it so refuseth / that it disobayeth not / in preferring obedience to the great God / before that whych is to be geuen to mortall man. It so resisteth / that it submitteth the body / and goodes of those that professe it / to abide that whych God will haue them suffer in that case. And if it be shewed / that this is necessary for the church / it can not be / but profitable for the common wealth: nay the profit of it / may easly appeare / for that by the censures / and discipline of the church / as they are in thys booke described / men are kept back from committing of great disorders of stealing / adultry / mur∣der. &c. whilest the smallest faultes of lying / and vncomely iesting / of harde and cholericke speaches / whych the magistrate doth not commonly punishe / be cor∣rected. And vndoubtedly / seeing that the church / & common wealth / do embrace / and kisse one an other / and seeing / they be like vnto Hypocrates twinnes / whych
 were sicke togither / and well togither / laughed togither / and weeped togither / and alwayes like affected: it can not be / but that the breaches of the common wealth / haue proceeded from the hurtes of the church / and the wants of the one / from the lackes of the other. Neyther is it to be hoped for / yt the common wealth shall flourishe / vntill the church be reformed. And it is also certaine / that as the church shall euery day more / and more decay / vntill it be made eauen wyth the ground / onles the walles be builded / and the ruines repaired: so the weight of it (if it fall) will eyther quite pull downe the common wealth / or leaue it suche / as none whych feare God / will take any pleasure in it. For seing Salomon sayth / ye Prouer. 8. 15. by wisdom (whych is the word of God) kings do gouerne / and princes do beare rule / it can not be / but as ye wisdome is either contemned / neglected / or otherwise abridged of hir free and full course / so princes / and magistrates / and consequently their common wealthes / either goe to wracke / or decay / or at the least / want so much of their flourishing estate / as there wanteth of that worde of God / which he hath appoynted to be their stay. And howsoeuer (before the comming of our sauioure Christ) amongst the Athenians / Lacedemonians / and Romanes / and since hys comming in diuers places / where thys wisedome hath not bene heard of / there may seme to haue bene some shewes of either florishing / or tollerable cō∣mon wealthes / yet neither haue those endured / but according to the prophesye of * Daniel / haue bene broken all to peeces: so that there is not so much of them left / 2. Chap. 34. as a sheerde to fetche fire in / neither yet can those kingdomes / whych haue the knowledge of the gospel reuealed vnto them / loke for that long suffering / and pa∣cience of God towardes them / wherewith these ignorant kingdomes haue bene borne with. For as the benefite is greater towardes these / then towardes the o∣ther / so is the iudgement swifter agaynste them / then againste the other / if that grace which was not offred vnto them (being offered vnto these) be refused / and made light of. And in these especially is / & shall be fulfilled / that whych the Pro∣phet * Esay sayeth / that it shalbe in the later dayes / that euery nation and king∣dom 60. chap. 12. whych shall not serue the church shalbe destroyed / as of the other side / the full / and whole placing of our sauior Christ in his throne / is the perpetuall stay / and stayed perpetuitie of all princes in their seats. And therfore / if this boke shal come / into the hands of any / that haue accesse vnto her maiestie / the head of this cōmon wealth / or vnto her most honorable counsel / the shoulders therof / my hū∣ble sute / and hearty request / in the presence of God is / that according as their cal∣lings will suffer them / they will put them in remembrance of these things / whych otherwise they know better then I / and that they would set before them / the ex∣ample of Moses / who was not contented to haue brought the people out of E∣gipt / 3. Deut. 25. but would very faine also / haue conducted them into the land of Canaan: that is / would gladly haue bene the instrument / of the ful / and whole deliuerance of the people. And seeing that the Lord doth offer vnto them this honor / which he denied vnto his seruaunt Moses / that they would not make themselues gilty of so great vnthankfulnes / as wil folow of the forsaking of so incomparable a be∣nefite. That her maiestie especially / and her most honourable counsaile / wold set before them the example of * Dauid / who although he made a great reformati∣on / 2. Samu. 7. 2. Psal. 132. of those things whych were defaced by Saule / yet he was not content / that the Arke of the Lord / should dwell vnder a tabernacle / and therfore desired mar∣uellously / that he might build the temple vnto the Lord. And seeing that ye Lord hath graunted that vnto them which he denyed vnto his seruaūt / that they wold not be narow / and straight in them selues / seeing the Lord openeth the treasures of hys goodnes so largely vnto them. That they would set before them / the zeale of * Zerubbabel / who although he had (after the returne out of captiuitie) aboli∣shed Esra. 3. 3. 10. idolatry / laid the foundations of the temple / and set vp an altare vnto god / whervpon the morning and euening sacrifice was daily made: yet being admoni∣shed
 by the Prophet Aggey / that God woulde not be pleased / vnles the temple Agg. 1. 14. also were fully buylded / dyd (all feare of the nations rounde about / and other bu∣synesses laid aside) cause it forthwith / and with all possyble speede / to be made an ende of. Finally / that it would please them / to consider the examples of * Iosias / 2. kin. 22. 23. 2. kin. 18. 2. Chr. 17. * Ezechias / and * Iehoshaphat / who are therfore / to their euerlasting commen∣dation praysed / of the holy ghost / for that / they made whole / & through reforma∣tions / whereas the honor of other some (albeit they were otherwise good) is stay∣ned / and caryeth the marke of their imperfection / by this and like exception / that although they did such good things / and such / yet they left also such / & such vn∣done. Which I do not speake / as though we had not already / by her maiesty es∣pecially / and afterwarde by their honors handes / receiued a singuler benefite / but that we hauing the whole / might haue our hearts / and mouthes filled wyth the prayse of God / and continue the possession of that whych we haue / which other∣wise for our vnthankfull refusall / shall be taken away. Wherin as we haue espe∣ciall regarde / that the name of God shoulde be magnified / not by vs alone / but by our posterity to the worldes end: so is it not the smallest part of our care / that her maiestie / and your honoures / to whom we are so depely bound / and of whom we haue receiued so singuler benefits of peace / and preaching of the gospel / myght with your successions continue / and flourish amongst vs for euer. But the desire of reformation / and feare of Gods heauy wrath to come vpon vs / hath caried me further heerein / then I purposed. I will therfore make an end of these poynts / considering that the vntruth of these accusations of newnes and straungenes / of disorder and confusion / of being ennemy to princes and common wealthes / shall better appeare in the discourse of thys boke.
Emongst ye offences taken by occasion of those / which prefer this doctrine / this is the chefest / that comparison being made betwene those excellent men / both in vertue / and learning / which suffered for the testimony of the truthe / & betwene vs / of the one side: Also betwene the Archbishops / Bishops / Deanes / & Arch∣deacons whych now are / and vs on the other side: it seemeth vnto many / that it is not lyke to be good / whych was not founde out by those excellent personages / and whych being now propounded / by men of no great shew / is eyther misliked / or at the least / by no open approbation alowed / of those whych cary greater coun∣tenaunces / and be in greater dignities.
Vnto the first / although answer is made more at large / in this boke / yet I wil adde thus much / that as for my part / I confes my self / to be a great deale in∣ferior vnto the least of them: so the omitting of these necessary things / ought to be no more preiudice against them / or against those that prefer them / then ye omitting of the celebration of the feast of tabernacles / so many hundreth yeres / by so many good high priests / in the raignes of so many good kings / was preiudicial vnto y• ministers / which caused it to be celebrated / when the people returned out of their captiuitie / for it appeareth in the boke of Nehemias / that ye feast of tabernacles / 8 Chap. 17. 18 which was commaunded of the Lord to be celebrated euery yeare / was not cele∣brated in such sort / as it was commaunded in the law / from the dayes of Iosua / the sonne of Nun / vntill the returne of the people from their captiuitie. And yet were there / in this space / diuers bothe iudges / and kings / both priestes / and pro∣phets singularly zealous / and learned. If therfore the omitting of so necessary a thing / so many hundreth yeares / by suche godly zealous learned persons / could not bring any prescription / against the truth: the lacke of this necessary discipline / by the space of. 30. yeares / through the ouersight of a fewe (if they be compared with that multitude) ought not to be alledged / to kepe it out of the church.
The dignitie also / and hygh estate of those / whych are not so earnest in thys cause / can not hinder it / if we consider / the wisdome of God / almost from time to time / to consist / and to shew it selfe most in setting forth his truth / by the simpler / 
 and weaker sort / by contemptible / and weake instruments / by things of no va∣lue / to the end / that when all men see the basenes / and rudenes of the instrumēt / 1. Cor. 1. 27. 28 they might the more wonder at the wisedome / and power of the artificer / which wyth so weake / and foolishe instruments / bringeth to passe so wise / and mighty things. And if men will wyth such an eye of fleshe / loke vpon matters / they shall condemne that excellent reformation / vnder the godly king Ezechias / whych the holy ghost doth so highly commend: in whych it is witnessed / that the Leuites / 2. Chro. 29. 34 2. Chr. 30. 17. whych were a degree vnder the priests / were more forward / and more zealous / then the priests them selues. Yea wherin it is witnessed / that the people were yet more earnest / and more willing / then either the Leuites / or the priestes. Whych thing / if euer / is verified in our time. For when I consider the zeale for religion / whych sheweth it selfe / in many / as well of the nobility / and gentry of this realme / as of the people / their care to continue it / and aduaunce it / their vo∣luntary charges to maintaine it / their liberality towards them / which bend them selues that way / as I do therby conceiue some hope / of the fauourable counte∣naunce / and continuance of Gods goodnes towards vs: so I can not be but a∣shamed of mine owne slackenes / and afraid of the displeasure of the Lord / for that those / whose proper worke thys is especially / and whych should beare the stan∣darde / and cary the torche vnto the rest / are so colde / and so careles in these mat∣ters of the Lord.
And I humbly craue / and most earnestly desire of those / whych beare the cheefe titles in the Ecclesiasticall functions / that as we doe in parte correct oure negligence / by the example of the forwardnes / and readines of the people: so they would suffer themselues / to be put in remembrāce of their dueties / by vs / which are vnderneath them / and that they would not neglect thys golden gift of Gods grace / in admonishing them / because the Lord doth offer it in a treene / or earthen vessell / but that they would first consider / that as * Naaman the Syrian prince / 2. Kin. 5. 4. 14 receiued great commodity / by following / the aduise of his maide / and after / of his man: And * Abigael being a wise woman / singuler profit / by obeying the coun∣sell 1. Sam. 25. 18 of her seruaunt: so they may receiue oftentimes profitable aduertisement / by those / whych are in lower places then they them selues be. Then let them thynke that as Naaman was neuer the les noble / for obeying the voyce of his seruaūts / nor Abigaell neuer the les wise / because she listened vnto the words of her man / so it can not deminishe their true honoure / nor empaire the credite of their godly and vncounterfait wisdome / if they geue care vnto that / which is spoken by their inferioures.
And last of all / that as / if they had not listened vnto those simple persons / the one had pearished in his leprosie / the other had bene slaine with her familye: euen so / if they shall for any worldly respect of honor / riches / or feare of being ac∣counted eyther vnaduised in taking this course / or light / or inconstāt in forsaking it / stop their cares against thys louing Admonition of the Lorde / they prouoke hys anger / not against their health / or against their life / but against their owne soules / by exercising of vnlawfull authority / and by taking vnto them partly such things / as belong by no meanes vnto the church / and partly whych are common vnto them / wyth the whole church / or els wyth other the ministers / and gouer∣nors of the same / wherof I beseche them humbly to take the better hede / for that the iudgement of the Lord wil be vpon a great part of them / by so much the hea∣uier / by how much / they haue not only beleued the gospel / but also haue receyued this grace of God / that they should suffer for it. So that if they wil neither take example of diuers their superiors the nobles of this realme / nor be admonished by vs of the lower sort (wherin we hope better of them) yet they would remember their former times / and correct them selues / by them selues. And seing they haue ben content for the gospels sake / to quit ye necessary things of this life / they wold
 not thinke much / for the discipline / whych is no small parte of the gospel (hauing both things necessary and commodious) to part from that / whych is not only in them superfluous / and hath nothing but a vaine ostentation (whych will vanish as the shadow) but also is hurtfull vnto them / and pernicious vnto the churche / whych thing I do morelargely / and plainly lay forth in thys boke.
Another exception against the fauorers of this cause / is taken / for that they propoūd it out of time / whych is that the Iewes sayd / that the time was not yet come to build the Lordes house: but it is knowen / what the * Prophet answea∣red. 1. Agg. 234. And if no time were vnseasonable / in ye kinde of materiall building / wherin there be some times (as of summer) more opportune and fit then others: howe can there be any vntimely building / in this spirituall house / where as long / as it is called to day / men are commaunded to further thys worke. And as for those which say we come to late / and that this shuld haue bene done in the beginning / and cannot now be done / wythout the ouerthrow of all / for mending of a peece: they do little consider / that * S. Paul compareth that which is good in the buil∣ding 1. Cor. 3. 12. 13 vnto gold / and siluer / and precious stones / and that whych is euil layd vpon the foundation / vnto stubble / and hey / and wode. Likewise therfore / as the stub∣ble and the hey / and the wode be easely by the fire consumed / wythout any losse vnto the gold / or siluer / or precious stones: so the corrupt things in this building / may be easely taken away / wythout any hurt / or hinderance vnto that which is pure / and found. And if they put such confidence in thys similitude / as that they wil therby / wythout any testimony of the word of God / stay ye further building / or correcting the faultes of the house of the Lorde (whych by his manifest com∣maundement ought to be done wyth all spede) then besides that they be very vn∣cunning builders / whych can not mende the faultes / wythout ouerthrow of all / (especially when as the fault / is not in the foundation) they must remembre / that as the meane / whych is vsed to gather the children of God / is called a building / so is it called a planting. And therfore as dead twigs / riotous / and superfluous braunches / or whatsoeuer hindreth the groweth of the vine tree / may be cut of / wythout roting vp the vine: so the vnprofitable things of the church / may be ta∣ken away / without any ouerthrow of those things / which are well established. And seeing that Christ / and Beliall can not agree / it is straunge / that the pure 2. Cor. 6. 15. doctrine of the one / & the corruptions of the other / should cleaue so fast togither / that pure doctrine / can not be wyth her safetie / seuered from the corruptions / when as they are rather like vnto that part of Daniels image / which was com∣pounded Cap. 2. 42. 43. of clay and iron / & therfore could not cleaue / or sticke one with an other.
It is further sayde / that the setters forwarde of thys cause / are contentious / and in mouing questions / giue occasion to the papists of slaundring the religion / and to the weake of offence. But if it be found to be both true which is propoun∣ded / and a thing necessary about which we contende / then hath thys accusation no grounde to stande on. For peace is commended to vs / with these conditions / * if Rom. 12. 18. it be possible / if it lye in vs. Now it is not possible / it lyeth not in vs / to conceale the truth / * we can do nothing agaynst it / but for it. It is a prophane saying / of 2. Cor. 10. 8. 2. Cor. 13. 8. a prophane man / that an vniust peace / is better then a iust warre. It is a dy∣uine saying / of an Heathen man / Agathed eris hede brotoisi: It is good to con∣tende for good thinges. The papistes haue no matter of reioysing / seeing they haue greater / and sharper controuersies at home / and seing thys tendeth / both to to the further opening of theyr shame / & thrusting out of theyr remnantes / which yet remayne among vs. The weake may not be offended / considering (ye euen in the church of God / and among those of the church) there hath bene as great vari∣eties of iudgementes / as these are. For what waightier controuersyes can there be / then whether we shall ryse agayne or no / whether circumcision were necessa∣ry to be obserued of those which beleued? And yet the first / was amongst ye church
 of the * Corinthes / the other was first in * Ierusalem and Antioche / and after in 1. Cor. 15. Act. 15. 1. 2 Gal. 3. 3. the churches of * Galatia / and yet they the churches / and that the true relygion / which was there professed. And it is to be remembred / that these controuersyes for the most part / are not betwene many. For sondry of those thinges / which are comprehended in the answere to the Admonition / haue (as I am perswaded) few fauourers / of those especially / which are of any stayed / or sounder iudgement in the scriptures / and haue sene / or red of the gouernment / and order of other chur∣ches: so that in deede (the father of that answere excepted) we haue thys contro∣uersy oftentymes / rather with the papistes / then with those which professe the gospell / as we do. And whereas last of all / it is sayde / that thys procedeth of en∣uy / of singularitie / and of popularitie / although these be no sufficient reasons a∣gaynst the truth of the cause / which is neyther enuyous / singular / nor popular / and althoughe they be suche / as myght be seuerally / by great lykelyhodes / and probalyties refuted / yet because the knowledge of these thinges / pertayneth on∣ly to God which is the searcher of the hart and raynes / and for auoyding of too Act. 1. 24. muche tediousnesse / we will rest in his iudgement / tary for the day wherein the secretes of hartes shall be made manyfest. And yet all men do see / how vniust∣ly we be accused of singularity / which propound nothing / that the scriptures do not teache / the wryters bothe olde / and new for the most part affirme / the exam∣ples of the primitiue churches / and of those which are at these dayes confirme.
All these accusations / as well agaynst the cause / as the fauourers thereof / al∣beit they be many and dyuers / yet are they no other / then which haue bene long sithens in the Prophets / Apostles / and our sauior Christes / and now of late in our tymes obiected agaynst the trueth / and the professors therof. And therefore / as the sunne of the truth then appeared / & brake through all those cloudes / which rose agaynst it / to stoppe the lyght of it: so no doubt thys cause / being of the same nature / will haue the same effect. And as all those slaunders could not bryng the truth in disgrace / with those that loued it: so the children of the truth / through these vntrue reportes / will neyther leaue the loue of thys cause / which they haue already conceaued: nor yet cease to enquire dyligently / and to iudge indifferently / of those surmises / which are put vp agaynst it.
Moreouer / seing that we haue once ouercomed all these lets / and clymed o∣uer them / when they were cast in our way / to hynder vs from coming from the grosse darknes of popery / vnto the gloryous lyght of ye gospell: there is no cause / why now they should staye our course to further perfection / considering / that neyther the style is hygher nowe / then it was before (being the very selfe same obiections) and in all thys tyme / we ought so to haue growne in the know∣ledge of the truth / that in stead of being then able to leape ouer a hedge / we should now haue our feete so prepared by the gospell / that they should be as the fecte of a hynde / hable to surmount euen a wall if neede were.
The summe of all is: that the cause may be looked vpon with a single eye / without all miste of partialitie / may be heard with an indifferent care / without the waxe of preiudice: the argumentes of both sides / may be waighed / not with the chaungeable waightes of custome / of tyme / of men / which notwithstanding (Popishe excepted) shall be shewed to be more for the cause then agaynst it: but with the iust balances of the incorruptible / and vnchangeable worde of God.
And I humbly beseeche the Lord / to encrease in vs the spirite of know∣ledge / and iudgement: that we may discerne thinges which differ one from an other / and that we may be syn∣cere / and wythout offence / vntill the day of Christ.
