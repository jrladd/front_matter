Right Worshipfull:
IT hath beene an ancient and laudable Custome a∣mong Humane and Di∣vine Writers, to entitle their labours intended for the publike good, to some parti∣cular person, fit for eminency of place, quality of gifts, and affection of piety; to Patronize and Commend to the
common vse, their sayd labours: It being then so with me, that being en∣treated to make publike this smal Trea∣tise, discoursing of one of the maine Duties of Christianity: I thought it was meete to go the Common Roade, that none through praejudice might ei∣ther reject the Worke, as altogether worthlesse, or despise the Author, as altogether friendlesse; but that, that authority, which the Word of God hath and ought to haue among Christians, might by an externall, and secondary testimony of men of worth, be confir∣med and countenanced.
I haue therefore presumed (though without your privity) to take vp your Worships Name to be as an ornament to the work; that those who know not the Author (as being an obscure man) might not yet despise it, while it is al∣lowed of such a one, of whom the Church of God hath long agon taken notice of as Foster-Father; and the Common-wealth reioyced in as an vn∣corrupt
and graue Officer and Maje∣strate. Yet in this businesse I had some strife in my selfe, while on the one side I considered your naturall Disposition which desires not, as indeede you need not, the applause of pen and paper; ha∣ving many reall and solid praeconies & testimonies of your laudable, and ver∣tuous actions, I was deterred: But when on the other side I considered my duty and that speciall obligation I stand bound in, to your Worships, for your many fauours, I could not but expresse some euidence & testimony of a thank∣full minde; and knowing that none of the common kinde wherewith the world doth gratifie her benefactors, would not be acceptable to you, espe∣cially from a Scholler and Minister: I am bold to present such as best befits me, and pleases your selfe; accept there∣fore a testimony of a thankfull minde, and such as if in no other regard might be acceptable; yet as it reioyces the hus∣bandman or Gardiner to taste of his
planted and grafted fruites: so seeing this is a handfull of that fruite which hath sprung from that Tree, which was first planted in the Garden of God, by your hand, and is still watered and warmed by the dew and beames of your beneficence: I hope it will not be vnpleasing to you, and the Church of God will thankfully acknowledge, that what euerfruite hath, or may growe hence, that, vnder God, it is to bee as∣cribed to your most Christian piety and care of the same: Who finding one of the Daughters of Syon harbourlesse and ragged, hath honestly housed her, and cloathed her. I had not thought (be∣leeue me Worshipfull Sir) to haue gone thus farre, when I put Pen to paper, to speake of your prayse to your selfe or other, for I know it pleases you not; yet let God be glorified, and his seruants honoured.
To returne then, seeking a Patron for my Worke; who may be thought fitter then the Patron of the worker?
Lords in old time did challenge, and the Law of God allowed it, that the ser∣uice of servants was their Maisters wholly and sure; how euer the worke for the outward lincaments may not seeme worthy your iudicious eye, and great learning, yet for the matter being taken out of Gods Booke, which by your dayly practise I can witnesse, is most precious vnto you; I know no∣thing borrowed thence, can seeme contemptible.
I pray you therefore accept in good worth this my tendred seruice; and as the Lord accepts of his seruants works not by the worke it selfe, but accor∣ding to the heart and minde of the worker; so iudge not of it, I pray you, by the out side, but by the affection of the giver. And thus ceasing longer to distract you from your many serious affaires, I commend the reading of this Treatise to your best leasures; pray∣ing God for a Blessing on it, and com∣mending your selfe, and all your
Worshipfull family to Gods gracious prospering and protection, still to be ouer you and yours in goodnesse. I humbly take my leaue from my Study at Haunes the 24. of Iune, this present Yeare 1624.
