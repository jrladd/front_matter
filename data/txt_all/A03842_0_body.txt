AS great men haue many cares to hinder their delights, so haue they much choice of delights to sweeten their cares. Among which more elected and almost diuine pleasures, Humanity must needes giue Musicke a supreame worth: which euer allowed trueth giues mee heart to hope that your right noble spirit will esteeme it no il-fitting complement, to receiue these fewe musicall Essaies from him who euer deuotes his vtmost indeauors to the deseruing of your happy-making fauour. I shall therefore in these onely protest my willingnes to doe your Honor the readiest and choicest seruice my studies can affoard: which humblest tenâˆ£der, if it may obtaine acceptance, my labours are happy, and my selfe in my largest hopes amply satisfied. Of which, I cannot dispaire, since I knowe Heroicke spirits are as farre from contempt as from basenesse.
