MY Most reuerend good Lord, The late experience of some defections and reuolts in children of lewde behauior, which haue contemptuously prophaned all obedience to parents, together with some desire of mine owne, to retaine the wauering dispositions of others, which may be in like ieopardie to be abused here∣after, haue put me into a businesse would God so helpfull for them, as necessarie for the time, I meane this English translation, of a most excestent Latin Originall. It treateth for the honorable maintenance of parents au∣thoritie, and was compiled some fiue and
twenty yeeres since by the famous French Ciuilian Petrus Aerodius, in purpose to re∣claime his sonne Renatus, who at that time, being vnder age, and without his fathers leaue had betaken himselfe to the Iesuites, company. Doubtlesse, the good parents griefe for an iniurie of such hainous qualitie, (if he may be heard speaking out of the tender bo∣wells of his affection,) is euer within mea∣sure though it be excessiue, iust, though past hope of recouery. A sonne, nay the eldest son, the first fruits of his strength, so faire a bud, to be stript from his naturall barke perforce, and inoculated in a stocke of astrange kind, would abate the imputation of being censu∣red passionate without a cause: euery man, to my thinking, vpon the supposall of such a person, being apt to acknowledge so much in himselfe, and that in the Poets phrase, Huic vniforsan poteram succumbere culpae, The dignity of the discourse, needs no enlarge∣ment by a preface, for (if too much increduli∣tie ouerweene not my iudgement) the most censorious Criticke, if he find patience to per∣use it in the natiue edition, will in meer iustice
commend most, or allow all. The stile is close wrought, and full of stuffe, the choice of his words apt and frugall, the sentences deepe and ponderous, the shafts of his arguments, drawne by a strong arme vp to the head, the nouelty of examples delightfull, the authori∣ties venerable, yet infinitly various, his dea∣ling faire and fatherlike, contending, rather for truth than conquest. Now might I take so much presumption vpon me, as to hope of some degree of your Graces good acceptance, (to whom especiallie, for discourse or title it is most properly belonging) I would farther alleadge for my selfe, that I haue often seene my worthy predecessor M. Doctor Gentilis, his Maiesties professor for the Ciuill lawes, reading me some Lectures, and teaching me how to offend in this kinde, whom I euer found of this opinion, that his excellent Lucubrations neuer prospered bet∣ter than when they receiued lustre from your Graces iudicious confirmation: to whom, as he was very much obliged, so was he not spa∣ring rather by preuenting occasion than by taking it, thankfully to report the same. And
lastly because the age wherein we liue, is so much visited with an Epidemiall distemper of disobedience, the cure would be sought for at their hands, who by reason of their eminent place of practice, best know (out of their great learning) to apply soueraigne anti∣dotes against such malignant qualities: and if that will not worke, then me thinks Lucius Brutus his seuerity well allaied would not come out of season, that derobed himselfe of all respects of a father, that he might the better act the part of a Consull, exuit patrem vt Consulem ageret. For such austeritie in parents many times proues pitty, and is powerfull, to make obedience where it finds none. A reformation of so generall impor∣tance that euery man may be said to haue a part in it, though he can challenge no proper∣tie, because quod commune est meum est, and (without peraduenture) an vndutifull sonne so reclaimed to his naturall obedience is that commune bonum.
