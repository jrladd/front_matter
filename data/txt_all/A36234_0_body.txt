Madam,
THough no Man by Nature, and Pra∣ctice too, was ever a greater affecter of Privacy than I my self (as 'tis well known) have always been; yet at this time I am well content to let this my plain Panegy∣rical Discourse (that was lately prepared, by your appointment, for the more solemn Celebra∣tion of Your most dear Father's Funeral) be exposed to the Publick, for the Reasons follow∣ing.

 First, For Your Ladyships own information and satisfaction (in regard you could not be personally present) that there was nothing de∣livered by me in my Character of him, but what he deserved, and what may pass (upon your own Knowledge) for a true and lively Pourtraicture of him in Little, as to his good Disposition, Nature and Conversation; the perusal whereof may he, perhaps, in process of time, as delightfull to your serious Re∣flections in your Closet, as the beholding of some well-drawn Picture of his comely Person will be to your Eye in your Parlour or Din∣ing-Room.
Secondly, For the necessary help and relief of one third part, at least, of the Auditory: Who, though they crowded into the Church as far as it was possible, yet were able to hear and understand very little or nothing of what was delivered, by reason of the unappeasable noise
and disturbance that was then made at the lower end of it by the rude Rabble. Now, These, I presume, would think their Loss ve∣ry much aggravated, and say they have cause to Complain of me, if by my refusing to make it publick, they should be depriv'd both of the Shadow and Substance at once, as well of the Copy as of the Original.
Thirdly and lastly, To make it appear that my sincere desire and endeavour is to preserve and to perpetuate, as far as I am able, the good Name and Memory of so deserving and worthy a Person; Where I shall not expatiate, but only intreat your Ladyship at present to moderate your Grief, to own the Lord's Hand in this sad Breach that is made in your Family, and in a word, to labour to make a right use of it for your spiritual good and growth in Grace; and then never doubt but that in due time he will
be pleased to repair and make up the same by ano∣ther Relation to your great Comfort. Which is the daily Prayer and Desire of,
Dear Madam,

From my Study,
Decemb. 1st. 1688.
