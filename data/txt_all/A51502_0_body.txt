SIR,
I Cannot more effectually enforce the Moral of this Piece which exposes the Frailty of a VVarrior, than by prefixing to it the Name of one who with the Bra∣very and Gallantry of Mars has no allay of his Vices: And as among the few living Exemplars of such unsul∣lied Vertue I know none more universally, nor more justly allow'd than your self, I must appeal from your Sentence to all the world, should your Favorite Mo∣desty byass you to condemn the Necessity of this Ad∣dress. While so many of our Youth are neglectful of their Ancestors Glory and their own, and indeed of every Thing but Effeminacy or Libertinism, 'tis fit we shou'd set before their Eyes not only the Deformities with which they are familiar, but the Beauties to which they are Strangers, that they may at once be sham'd into a Loathing of the one, and charm'd into an Ad∣miration of the other. This wou'd require a Panegy∣rick rather than an Epistle, if studied Ornaments, often injurious to prevailing Charms, were not as prejudicial

to convincing Truth, which is most engaging in its in∣nocent Nakedness, at which it needs not blush, since it never fell like man To those that know you, your Name alone will imply more than the best Oratory could display, and even an imperfect account of your Excellencies will seem almost incredible to others. You set out so soon and so vigorously for the Race of Glory, that in your early Morn we see you gain the Prize. Thus even at those years when others of your Birth and Fortune made no other use of the opportunities they had to improve their minds but to impair 'em, the general ill Example could not affect you, unless it were with Compassion; you despis'd their false Pleasures for the chast Love of that Celestial that Alma Venus of your own Lucretius, and that sublime Truth of your admir'd Malebranche. You even then reapt the Muses Laurels, as now you do those of Mars, while your brave Father in the New-world was gain∣ing a Name that spreads over the old, as yours now flys from the one to the other. The World with amaze∣ment saw you arise in full Glory, and reconcile Quali∣ties thought almost incompatible; at once a nice and impartial Critic, yet a polite and excellent Master of Fancy; a Man of Wit and Conversation, yet a Respecter of sacred things; a Courtier, yet the best of Friends; a forward Soldier, yet a good Officer; and in short a profound Scholar, yet a fine Gentleman. Such partly Caesar was; thus he exerted the Writer and the Hero; but with this difference, he fought to enslave his Country, you to free Yours: and 't was but just that as your Studies have advanc'd you to an honourable Post among the Learned, so your Courage shou'd give you one among the Brave, that you might be at once a sin∣gular Honor to either Station; the more, as you seek

no other Benefit from both, but that of doing the more good to men of both Professions. For, far from being like those whose Pleasures engross their Youth and Wealth, you cannot be happy with yours, unless it makes others so; and I could instance some whose needy Modesty has found it self unexpectedly reliev'd by you, without being expos'd to any other Blushes than what so surprizing a Generosity could raise. I know Sir, you would have your Bounty conceal'd; but pardon me if I sav, 'tis too often imploy'd, not to be discover'd; besides it acts in so obliging a manner, that 'tis a pain to a grateful Spirit to conceal it; inso∣much that he foregoes the Pride which waited on his Want, to own favours that humble him, if it can hum∣ble a man to be reliev'd by you: For my part, I am so far from thinking that possible, that I have long been ambitious of having this opportunity of owning my self,
SIR,
