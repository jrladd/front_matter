RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
THis aduantage a Scholar hath aboue others, that hee cannot be idle, and that he can worke without instru∣ments. For, the minde inured to contemplation, will set it selfe on worke, when other occasions faile: and hath no more power not to studie, than the eye which is open, hath, not to see some thing; in which businesse it car∣ries about his owne Librarie, neither can complaine to want Bookes while it enioyeth it selfe.
J could not then neglect the commoditie of this plentifull leasure in my so easie attendance here; but (though besides my course, and without the helpe of others writings) must needs busie my selfe in such thoughts as J haue euer giuen account of, to your Lordship: such as J hope shall not be vnprofitable, nor vnwelcome to their Pa∣tron, to their Readers. J send them forth from hence, vnder your Honourable name; to shew you that no absence, no imployment can make mee forget my due respect to your Lordship: to whom (next vnder my gracious Master) J haue deseruedly bequeathed my selfe and my endeuours. Your goodnesse hath not wont to mag∣nifie
 it selfe more in giuing, than in receiuing such like holy presents: the knowledge whereof hath intitled you to more labours of this na∣ture (if I haue numbred aright) than any of your Peeres. I mis∣doubt not either your acceptation, or their vse. That God, who hath aboue all his other fauours giuen your Lordship, euen in these carelesse times, an heart truly religious, giue you an happy increase of all his heauenly graces by my vnworthy seruice. To his graci∣ous care I daily commend your Lordship with my Honourable Lady; wishing you both, all that little ioy earth can affoord you, and fulnesse of glory aboue.
Non-such.
Iuly 3.
