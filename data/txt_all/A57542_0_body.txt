My Lord,
IN humble Obedience to Your
Lordships Commands, and due
Submission to a Request made to
Your Lordship by the worthy Master
and Gentlemen of the Corporation
of Trinity-House, this Discourse
which was designed by me only for the
Pulpit, now begs your Lordships and

those worthy Gentlemens Acceptance
from the Press. The Intention of it
being to perswade Sea-faring men to
the Exercise of Religion and Vertue,
upon Motives proper to themselves;
if, by God's Blessing upon it, it shall
be a means of turning any one unto
Righteousness, it will be the most am∣ple
Return I expect for this bold Ad∣venture
abroad.
My Lord, if it were possible that
all of your high Rank and Quality
would, after your great Example,
resolve to be either Encouragers of
Trade, or employ their Minds in
some other way as serviceable to their
King, their Country, and Them∣selves;
we might then hope to see
every one of them become, what your
Lordship now is, inflexibly Loyal to
his Prince, a Hearty Lover of his

Country, a Great Friend to Business
and Trade, and a Professed Enemy
to the looseness and degeneracy of the
Age.
MY Lord,
I am
