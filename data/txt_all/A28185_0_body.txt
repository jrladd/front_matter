Worthy Gentlemen;
THE Honourable Character which is given of you by all who have the Happiness of your Acquaintance, emboldens this Presumption from an unknown Hand; I doubt not but as you have Capacity enough to judg, so you have Zeal enough to resent the Injury, which the Doctor's Sermon may have occasion'd, either to the Memory of the Sacred Martyr, or the Title and Government of your present Master: and seeing it is more incumbent upon you than others, to take the Affair into your Consideration, and represent it truly to those under whose Cognizance it properly falls, I beg your favourable Censure of the following Animadversions.
