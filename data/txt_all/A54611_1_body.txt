My Lord,
THE Observati∣ons on the Bills of Mortality were distinctly Dedicated to a Peer of this Realm, and also to the Presi∣dent of the Royal Society,

and both with good accep∣tance: Wherefore I have also (like the Author of those Observations) Dedicated this Discourse to his Grace the Duke of Newcastle, for the reasons in the foregoing Epi∣stle mentioned; and I now again Dedicate the same to your Lordship. First, In Gra∣titude for the several assi∣stances I had from your Lord∣ship towards the Experiments mentioned in this Discourse. Secondly, Because your Lord∣ship is an Eminent Iudge

in those Matters, a Person whose Animadversions I shall take for Kindnesses; and who is able to excuse the Er∣rors, and defend the Truths I have delivered. Lastly, For that near half the whole Discourse relates to Shipping, Artillery, Fortresses, Sea∣banks, &c. which all con∣cern his Majesties Service, and part whereof are happily entrusted by him to your Lordships Care; I thought I might express My affection to those his Majesties Con∣cernments

even by offering this my Mite unto them. Vpon the whole Matter, I have layd hold on this Occa∣sion, to Publish my desire of being esteemed,
My LORD, 
Ult. Decemb. 1674.
