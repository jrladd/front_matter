My Lord,
I Have been long in∣debted both to your Lordship, your no∣ble Lady, and your hopeful Son Mr. Watson for your favours and good will towards me; I have therefore adventured (not by way of requi∣tal, but of acknowledgment) to present this Theological Epitome to You, which is the most exact and compendious of any that hath been yet done by Protestant Wri∣ters: I may say of this Edition, as Philosophers speak of Nature; that, It is neither deficient in necessaries, nor abundant in superfluities: What was in the Latin Copy dark, I have cleared; and what was contracted, I have unfolded. How

My Lord, This Book is the Epitomie of Divinity; and this Epistle, the Epi∣tomie of my true affection, and ma∣ny thanks I owe you and yours: on whom I wish the influence of all happinesse, which is the hearty desire of
