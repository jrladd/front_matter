RIght Worshipful, for somuch as na∣turally wee desire that which is good, & that there is nothing that hath so much power to preserue the life and socitie of man, as that which is honest, profitable & plea∣sant; and because it is certain, that amongst all other matters (the holie and sacred scrip∣ture onely excepted) there is nothing to bee compa∣red to that which bringeth a general good to all, and containeth in it those meanes to attaine vnto perfect happinesse, which all the auncient philosophers were farre wide of, and that waie to liue blessedlie, vvhich euery Christian ought to wale in: I thought good hauing (with much paine and trauaile) opened this gappe, & made plaine the passage, to vouchsafe your worships the first entrance, and by your permission, to make it a common beaten waie for all men to haue recourse vnto. With all sinceritie and dutifulnesse, de∣dicating this my labour vnto your Wor. and wishing that as many of you are known to be patterns of good and godlie life; so the rest may take example by you,
to frame themselues to a well disposed course: and if besides example they want instructions, this Trea∣tise may serue to leade them vnto vertue. For you that doe alreadie knowe that this worldlie pleasure is onely good in this respect, to serue as a spurre to prick you forward to the search of true felicitie, whereunto euery one is inclined; it may helpe to confirme your minds and settle them, that they be not shaken by anie stormes or assaults that vice can make. To the weake it may be as a staie, and to the strong a comfort. And albeit I confesse, it might by diuers haue beene hand∣led with more elegancie and finenesse of phrase: yet thus much I will auerre, that I haue done it faithfullie, and trulie, according to the meaning of the Author, though in plain termes. And for my selfe, as the prin∣cipall ende of my labour (next vnto your Wor. con∣tentment and commoditie) was the common profite of my countrey menne: So do I nought expect from them but thanks; and from your Wor. that this my labour may be as fauourablie accepted of you, as it is freelie offered: and so do wish you here in this world a prosperous successe in al your enter∣prises, and in the world to come, the fulnesse of all ioy and blessednesse.
