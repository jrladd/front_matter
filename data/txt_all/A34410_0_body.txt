May it please Your Highness,
THe knowledge I have of my own weak∣ness
in things of this nature, together
with that awful Respect which ought
to be had in all such neer approaches
to Sacred Majesty, might very reaso∣nably
have dash'd in me the first
thoughts of this extream presumption
of lifting up my eyes to Your Highness;
and so in truth those considerations
had: but that I was reliev'd by the
power of that excessive Clemency,
which has ever appear'd most Familiar in You, and which in∣deed
seems to be Natural and Hereditary to all of the Royal
Circle.

'Tis from that, Madam, I hope to obtain of Your Highness
my Pardon, for [otherwise] so inexcusable an Arrogance;
since it was Your infinite Goodness that gave me leave in this
mean trifle to pay You the Religion of my Zeal.
Be pleas'd then to receive this Poem (an absolute stranger
to the World, being never yet seen upon the publick Theatre.)
with tha Generosity and Grace You are always ready to be∣stow
upon the Ʋfortunate and Fair: and such Your Highness
knows were Oroondates and Statira, who now being forc'd a∣gain
from the peaceful Shades of their happy Retirement, do
throw themselves at Your Princely Feet, with the Reverence
and Humility of Idolaters, devoutly begging their Protection
might be in Your Highness's Ʋmbrage, as in the only place
where they can best be secur'd from the envy, if I may not ven∣ture
to say, malice of persecuting Censors: being sure that no
outrages dare then be committed upon them by any of the most
malignant, when once Your Highness shall please to take upon
You the interest of their preservation.
For so Illustrious; Madam, and highly eminent is Your
Birth (being derived from the first Prince of the Royal Blood,
and from the only Brother to the best and greatest Monarch in
the World) that You naturally inspire into all people the ex∣tremity
of an universal Submission and Respect: that Venera∣tion
which they with constraint do yield to others, they, out of
an impatient eagerness to acquit themselves of their duty, do
voluntarily pay to Your Highness, and with an Ambition com∣mensurate
to nothing upon Earth, except it be Your Supreme
Quality, they are daily striving to sacrifize their Hearts and
utmost Faculties upon that Altar.
But, Madam, besides the great advantage of Your Royal
Birth, Your Highness is indowed with so vast a number of
excelling Charms, as that they cannot be lookt upon without
dazle-ing and adoration, even by those who are themselves most
Adorable: There is in Your Highness's Looks, such a Shine
and Lustre of Beauty, as is not to be resembled by any thing
below a Divinity; and as the brightness and glory of it, like

the Sun, delights and refreshes the eyes of all Mankind; so al∣so
You have mixt with it such a Fierceness and grand Air of
Majesty, that, like a Divinity too, you cannot be beheld with∣out
fear and trembling. This, Madam, is the Ʋnanimous
Suffrage of all the Happy world that have yet been blest with
a Sight of Your Incomparable Perfections. Every way your
Beauty is triumphant; there is such a sweet composuy of great∣ness
and delicacy in your eyes, that You equally make all
hearts to lauguish and consame in their devotion to You.
But Your Highness hath not only the attractions of Birth
and Beauty to support Your Empire (though where e're those
Beams are scattered, they injoyn Obedience) but you have also
the extreamest Vertue to continue its duration; that Vertue,
Madam, of pure and unspotted Innocence, Honour, and Good∣ness,
which (joyn'd to the happiness of Your Hourishing
Youth) brings You as near to the Resemblance of Heaven, as
it is possible for any thing of humanity ever to think to
attain.
And yet, Madam, these are not all the Blessings for which
you ought to be rever'd: Such Birth, Beauty, and Vertue were
never intended only for a private enjoyment: therefore the most
infinite Wise and Indulgent Heaven, has been pleas'd to make
on purpose a Person of peculiar Charms to be fitting for You;
and for the last completion of happiness, saw nothing more wor∣thy
than to contract the greatest Ʋnion that ever was, between
the two most Illustrious Houses of York and Nassau, in the Per∣sons
of your Highness, and the Great Prince of Orange; two
such Glorious Characters, as that the largest Account of Ro∣mantick
Story has never yet presum'd to say, were match'd to∣gether.
Both your Divine and Goodly Qualities are so numerous, and
yet united, that, like a Deity, you can never be ador'd but in
all your Altributes: And, Madam, both of you must continu∣ally
expect to receive the Prayers and Wishes of all Mankind,
for the renew'd Accessions of your, if possible, more flourishing
Felicities.

But, Madam, Heaven has not only been consulting to make
You, and your Prince happy; it has likewise been considering
the happiness of the whole Kingdom of ENGLAND, as also
that of all the High and Mighty Neighbour-States in this Af∣fair:
We are in some measure sharers of your Glory; and (if your
Highness will bear with me in the Expression on the general be∣half)
will not give you the whole Monopoly of it; no, our
Hearts must have the priviledge of rejoycing too; for the light∣ing
of this Nuptial Torch is such a Blessing bestow'd upon us
all, as is incapable of Addition: and nothing in the World can
dare to pretend to any equality with it, unless it be the great∣ness
of that Joy, which every moment grows new, and increa∣ses
more upon us.
For Your Highness is joyned to a Prince, that seems, as it
were, to be divested of his Humanity; he is so God-like in his
Vertues, and all his Actions; a Prince of such dazeling Bright∣ness
in his Glory and Renown, as is impossible to be exprest, ex∣cept
we set down what ever is accounted excellent, and that He
is. A Prince that knew how to Conquer, before the World conld
reasonably imagine he was capable of weilding His Sword. His
Countenance is so Martial, that it plainly expresses the great
Courage he hath, not to know what Fear is in himself; and yet
can strike a General Dread and Consternation in others; so that
he needs not be obliged to the use of Arms to Conquer his Ene∣mies,
for he can easily gain the Victory over them when ere he
pleases but to imploy the Terror of his Looks. But yet withal,
He has such Grace-full and Winning Charms, as none is able to
behold him without Admiration. Such Justness and Regularity,
is in his Shape and Meen, such Sweetness in his Motions, and
such a Generous Condescention in all His ways; that he does
not so much make to himself Slaves by the Force of His Valour,
as he does cause all Hearts to become Tributary to him by His
Obliging and Familiar Address.

But, Madam, I find how insufficient I am to speak of either
of your Princely Vertues as I ought, and therefore fear I have
already too much offended your Highness in what I have said
of them; being so vastly inferiour to their particular Merit,
that, methinks, this small Attempt has made me guilty of a
very high profanation. The Honour of so extraordinary an Em∣ployment
ought to be reserved for some more happy Genius, that
can ascend to your Excellencies, and my temerity would not be
excusable, if I did not bound it with my earnest Prayers for
both your present and eternal Felicities; being
