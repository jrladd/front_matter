EXcellent and most worthy-aduan∣ced, the hard and troublesome stu∣die of the lawes, whereunto I am by place deuowed, affoords me so short onely and broken times to shew and satisfie the desire I haue of honoring your Lordship, that, through the continuall enaction of your vertue, your honours daylie encreasing do farre surmount and outstrip these enterspaced labours of my pen. Bound yet (my L.) by many titles to loue and ho∣nour your House, euer honorable, & now in your Lord∣ship repossessed of the great name your auncestours had, for some token of the great ioy my hart conceiues thereat, and especiallie at this time, I haue to the Babi∣lon of Bartas, which you did so graciouslie receiue at my hands, further Englished, and do here present vnto your excellent Honor, this booke next ensuing the other, which the Auctor entituled The Colonies a work (my L) worthie also to be countenaunced by your honorable name, and not vnmeet for a noble Knight, Statesman and Admirall (though he were of all the world) to read,
if the great cares of so high place gaue leaue. For here in lesse roome then might be thought able to containe so great and sundrie matters, are plainlie set downe, and euen tabled-out vnto vs, the seuerall partes, peo∣ples and policies of the whole earth, as they began first, and grew in time further to be distinguished by the three sonnes of Noe & the diuerse ouer-creases of their families:
But Englands great negocies will not let
Your Lordship reade or heare much prose or song:
For (as in Embleme I before haue set,
To paint in short what honours you belong)
BY SEA AND LAND you are the Fense of Sion;
By SEA her Ancor, and By LAND her Lion.
Liue then renoumed both BY SEA AND LAND,
And daunt the Spaniard as you haue to fore:
That England fast may with your Ancor stand,
And by your Lion enimies be tore.
So shall you ridde the world of Tyrants threat;
Therfore be tytled Englands Charles the Great;
And alway (for so guarding this her Isle)
Of Prince be graced; lou'd and song of Lisle,
