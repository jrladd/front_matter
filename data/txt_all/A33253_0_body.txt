SIR,
THE State of Purpoole (so long obscur'd in it self) could no otherwise express its Grandeur, but by shewing to Posterity what it was: This moved those ingenious Gentlemen to leave to succeeding Times the Memory of those Actions, which they themselves had done; not for the vain Air of Popularity, but generously to give an Example, which others might desire to follow.
Accordingly they have, by this History, set forth their Actions, which seem to be writ with the same Gallantry of Spirit as they were done.
The Language it self is all that Age could afford; which, allow∣ing something for the Modern Dress and Words in Fashion, is not beneath any we have now: It was for that Reason thought necessary

not to clip any thing; which, though it may seem odd, yet naturally begets a Veneration, upon Account of its Antiquity.
What more could they have wished, than to have found a Patron worthy the protecting the Memory of such a Prince? And what more can they require, than the Safety of your Patronage.
It was Fortune, undoubtedly, that reserved it for this happy Op∣portunity of coming forth under your Protection.
That strict Alliance which ever was betwixt your States seems to ask it of you, as the only Person in whom are revived the ancient Honours of both Houses: It was certainly a publick Sense of the same personal Abilities (which made that Prince so conspicuous) that gives us all a publick View of those Vertues, so much admired in private.
Sir, 'Tis for these Reasons humbly offerred to you, presuming upon a favourable Acceptance of that which naturally falls under your Care.
May Time perfect the Character already so well begun, that Posterity may hear you equal, if not greater than the Prince of Purpoole.
