SIR:
THis Tragedy, a manuscript, with another of
the same Authors, came lately to my hands;
He that gaue them birth, because they were
his Nugae, or rather recreations to his more
serious and diuine studies, out of a nice mo∣desty
(as I haue learnt) allowed them earce
priuate fostering. But I, by the consent of his
especiall friend▪ in that they shew him rather Omnium scena∣rum
homo to his glory then disparagement: haue published
them, and doe tender this to your most safe protection, let it wn∣der
a fatherlesse Orphan, which euery one in that respect will be
apt to iniure with calumnious censure. Now if you vouchsafe
to receiue and shelter it, you will not onely preserue vnblemish'd
the euer-liuing fame of the dead Author, but assure me that you
kindly accept this humble acknowledgement of
