SIR,
The naturalre∣spect, that an obseruāt sonne oweth to a wor∣thy and carefull father, obligeth me to meditate on some thing that may deserue your pervsall, and answere part of your expe∣ctation: hauing therefore tasted the fruites of many mens invē∣tions, I could not finde any sort so holesome for a man of your
 yeares, nor so pleasing to mine ovvne relish as this ensuing treatise of that worthy Gentle∣man and admirable divine Pe∣ter Du Moulin, vvho by his tongue, and pen doth daily win many souls to God, which other∣wise would by the subtill delusi∣on of Sathan, and the persuasiue discourses of vvicked Masse∣priests, and sin-plotting Iesuits run headlong to their owne de∣struction. I know your expence in my breeding may iustlie re∣quire as great a worke as this immediatly frō my selfe, which I shoulde bee as willing to per∣forme, as you to command, were it not that I looke backe into this age as ful of envious detra∣ctiōs, & idle censures, as voide
 of all true iudgement, and ver∣tue. Moreover this matter be∣ing a diuine morality, or rather a morall diuinity woulde seeme too graue for my youth, and too high for my knowledge. Where∣fore I am the rather desirous to make vse of this Translatiō, be∣cause it will serue not only as a buckler against those criticall shafts, which some musty quiuer might send out against me, but also as a comfort & restoratiue for your declining age. I haue presumed to dedicate it to your fatherly censure, as being yet vnable to apprehend any other thing that may either adde per∣fection to it selfe, or deservedlie attract any favor frō you: hum∣bling craving that the errours
 of this Translation may not any way impeach your good opiniō but as you haue formerly▪ so now & ever after you will bind me to rest
