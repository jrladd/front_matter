MY LORD,
HOw great a Happiness it is to this weather-beaten Church to have a Person of so great Abilities, and known Integrity, advanced to that high Honour and Trust of being its Prime Steers∣man in these unsteady and tempestuous Times, is
 easier by much for me to conceive, than to declare. Nevertheless I do humbly assume the boldness to ex∣press the deep sense I have of it, and the high joy I have conceived for it, by dedicating unto Your Graces Name the ensuing Treatise: in which I defend that Church, whereof You are constituted the Supreme Ecclesiastical Minister, against such a sort of Adversaries, as strike not only at its Wealth and Grandeur, but even at its very Life and Being, and most especially in their management of that particular Controversie, which is the Sub∣ject of these following Papers, whereby, whilst they go about to unchristen our Persons, they endeavour to unchurch our Church: for how that can be a true Christian Church, in which there is neither Magi∣strate, nor Minister, nor People, that have been bap∣tized with a true Christian Baptism, (and none have been so, in the opinion of the Anabaptists, that have not been totally dipped) I am yet to learn. And I humbly beg, that Your Grace will vouchsafe Your Pa∣tronage to this particular Treatise, because of the weighty importance of this Controversie, and of the indispensable necessity of making good this Post against the insulting Adversary, and of clearing all difficul∣ties about it, that so the unsetled Consciences of well-meaning men, who modestly doubt, or are unfactiously dissatisfied therein, and, as they soberly seek, so would gladly find, whereon they might safely, as well as finally settle, may at length have solid ground, where∣on to build a clear satisfaction to themselves, that they are already in a state of true Christianity, and live in a truly Christian Community, and have no neces∣sity
 in order thereunto, of turning Anabaptists, and being baptized over again; that so every stone of Offence, and Stumbling-block of doubt being removed out of the way, the Dissenters from the Church of England on this account, may chearfully and consci∣entiously return to union with it; which as it is my hearts wish, and souls desire, so is it my principal aim, and main design in these Papers: or else may be known to all the World to continue perversly and unconscionably in their separation from it; which God, in his infinite mercy to this Church, and Them, forbid. And now, as knowing that Your Graces con∣cerns are both too many, and too weighty, to be di∣verted, or interrupted, with other mens little, and yet long impertinencies, I wish Your Grace much joy of, and the Church a long enjoyment of You in, that Honour, whereunto his Majesty, to the great content of all his People, hath so worthily advanced You; and in all dutiful affection remain
MY LORD,
Colsterworth near Grantham, May 1. 1678.
