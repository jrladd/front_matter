It may Please Your Highnesse,
In part of my ac∣knowledgment to Your Highnesse, I haue endeuoured to doe Honour to the Me∣mory of the last King of ENGLAND, that was Ancestour to the King your Father, and Your selfe; and was that King to whom both Unions may in a

sort referre: That of the Roses beeing in him Consummate, and that of the King∣domes by him begunne. Besides, his Times deserue it. For hee was a Wise Man, and an Excellent King; and yet the Times were rough, and full of Mutations, and rare Ac∣cidents. And it is with Times, as it is with Wayes. Some are more Vp-hill and Downe-hill, and some are more Flat and Plaine; and the One is better for the Liuer, and the Other for the Writer. I haue not flattered him, but took him to life as well as I could, sitting so farre off, and hauing no better light. It is true, Your Highnesse hath a Liuing Patterne, Incomparable, of the King your Father. But it is not amisse for You also to see one of these Ancient Pee∣ces. GOD preserue Your Highnesse.
Your Highnesses most humble and
deuoted Seruant,
Francis St. Alban.
