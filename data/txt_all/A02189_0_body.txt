RIght vertuous and much belou'd and grac'd of God, J cannot but present this trembling, (yet not all trembling) Tractate to

you, partly knowing how welcome holy subiects are vnto your soule, and especially considering your im∣portunity for a written Copie of the same.
It is not fit that holy things bee giuen to dogges, nor pearles be cast to swine: but matters diuine, to per∣sons denoute most meete for present∣ment, both for godly vse, and strong defence against disgracers of them.
J haue therefore made this Jay∣ler your Prisoner, and commit∣ted him to your safe watch and warde: looke what paines you take, and time expend about him, the Preacher of deliuerance to all Captiues, Luke 4. 18. will one day most faithfully and richly re∣ward.

I pray haue an eye alwayes vnto him, see him sicke, see him sound, see him condemned, see him saued, see his passage through Hell to Hea∣uen: Let his example be your in∣struction, his feare your humbling, his faith your happying: you must bee touchd with Legall attriti∣on, or else no taste of heauenly re∣mission.
Let not his Hell despaire you, nor his Heauen presume you: but by the one, hold awe of God and feare, and by the other, hope of happinesse for euer.
Now the Lord adde vnto your glory by these and other holy helps and meanes, and his best blessings bee multiplyed vpon you, your lear∣ned, louing, and religious Hus∣band,

and all your tender Oliue∣branches, for his deare Christs sake.
Amen.
From Hempstead in Essex, this 3. of April. 1620.
