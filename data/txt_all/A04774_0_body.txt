THE manifold graces which God hath plen∣tifully poured on you, enabling you, even from your youth, to be a fit instrument divers wayes to ad∣vance his glorie, and blessing your great good labours with the favourable acceptance of our dread Soveraigne & State and all who have well-wishing unto this our Sion, have caused
me, a crazie, old, retired man, who never saw you but once, and that long since, to leave behinde me a testimoniall to the world, both of my heartie thanks to God, that you have been; & of my humblest pray∣ers, that you may long conti∣nue a prop of our Church, a favoured Ezra, the prompt Scribe in the Law; a powerfull Aaron, to make an atonement for the people, an Elijah, zea∣lous in your calling; a provi∣dent guide to the Prophets, to the sonnes and schools of the Prophets; a father, chariot, & horsemen of Israel, as Elisha called Elijah, & as king Joash called Elisha. May heavenly influences and divine irradia∣tions say, Amen, Amen.
