Honoured Sir,
THough the Real Esteem and Great Veneration I have for Your Integrity and Worth, hath been the cause of the Trouble, yet I fear it will not be Justification and Excuse for the boldness of this Address: Not but that I know You to be

a Person of very great Candor and Condescension, of Compla∣cency and Goodness, very rea∣dy to Accept and Commend, Encourage and Promote any Undertaking of this Nature, a∣ny thing that may perswade and contribute ought unto Loy∣alty and Obedience, in so Sedi∣tiously and Rebelliously Profli∣gate an Age. And indeed it was this Consideration, viz. of that Great Love to the Subject here Treated of, that gave me the Assurance and Confidence of Prefixing Your Name to this so mean a Discourse. I could not but perswade my self, but that to One who hath so vigorously and eminently Asserted and Pra∣ctised Loyalty and Fidelity to His Prince and Sovereign, such seasonable and necessary Truths as are here delivered, would, from how mean a Hand soever,

be very grateful and acceptable: Especially when there are so many Sheba's, Sons of Belial, still blowing the Trumpet to Rebel∣lion, and endeavouring to De∣throne the Lords Anointed, and to Involve these Nations in a Miserable and Bloody War, a Lamentable Confusion and Ru∣in. It was a prospect hereof that at first excited me to Pen what I here Present You with, and that hath now encouraged the Publication. I am not very Solicitous what Entertainment it will meet with; there is no∣thing that will please or satisfie some Men; that are obstinately resolv'd and prejudic'd against a Truth, be the Arguments from Scripture and Reason o∣therwise never so cogent and convincing. Nor am I so vain and fond as to imagine and be∣lieve,

that I shall turn Apostle, and convert such unreasonable Ethnicks. It is utterly impos∣sible to perswade a Man that the Sun shines, if He will not be∣lieve His own Eyes; and it is as difficult to convince any one of the Truth, how perspicuously and fully soever Represented and Demonstrated, that rejects all Scripture and Reason in the disquisition. It is this that hath rendred me hopeless, as to any profit and advantage that this sort of Men will reap from this Discourse; but as to reasonable and ingenuous Men, all that will open their Eyes and see, I doubt not but that They will find e∣nough and sufficient to con∣vince and perswade Them of, and to confirm Them in the Truths here represented; and it is for such as These that I have taken all this pains. How∣ever,

it comes not to inform and instruct You, it being only a Copy and Transcript of Your Life and Practice; and as such, I Hope, You will Vouchsafe it Shelter and Protection under Your Roof, and the Author a place amongst Those that really Honour You, it being the High∣est of His Ambition, to be in all Sincerity and Faithfulness,
