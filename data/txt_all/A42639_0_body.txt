May it please your Excellency.
SHould I not proceed Methodically in the De∣dication of the Lectures which are read in my Academy, for Languages, Sciences, and Noble Exercises (as in all affaires and Sci∣ences, seemes most requisite I should neither remaine blamelesse, nor be freed from Your Excellencies just censure, and Dis-favour, if what concernes Military Architecture or Fortifications, should appeare to the Publique View under any other notion then your high Protection. And therefore it is, that I doe now presume, to expose and submit to your Excellency this first Lecture con∣cerning Military Architecture, with intent to proceed up∣on all the following parts, which as it makes its entrance by the Properties belonging to a Governour of a Frontier Town, describing how that the maine consequence is in the choyce of the Person, so that he must neither be of too greaters,

 to my Academy, which  the glory of God, as well as the Honour of this Nation, the Incouragement and Improvement of all Lovers of Ver∣tue, are interested. Cannot but promise to it selfe, that so great and eminent a person (as Your selfe) will not onely countenance and promote the same, for the compleating of all those who practice in Warres, but also for the benefit of all such as strive to be endowed with any other laudable Vertues. Such a Publick good, serving for example to (strangers,) and not to boast, that they only possesse, or are capable of those qua∣lities, when the English Nation is every whit as able in bo∣dy and minde as they can be. And this being Truth, I shall with the more confidence indeavour to continue in this un∣dertaking, on the hopes that truth will make good what is and ever shall be my aime, by the settlement of such an A∣cademy; so that your Excellency may please to take to Your selfe the due Title, not only of its Mars, but of its Mecenas, since all the Vertues in Your Excellency so fitly occurring, make you both in generall, and in particular, a true Lover of all what is honourable, generous, usefull, and necessary: And as my selfe to remaine

From the Academy this
28 of Decemb. 1649.
