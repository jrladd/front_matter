LAte providences speak the ap∣proach of God to you in mercy, if you approach to God in dutie: how happie that meeting will be, is more then I can tell: This I can tell, it will be a happie meeting, By such a people God is highly honoured, and such a peo∣ple shall be greatly blessed by their God. All blessings concenter in this one, God is with us. All places are full of God, but he fils not all alike. Few know when God is nigh, or when he is a far off, what his goings away mean, or what his commings. They who know these things count his presence their greatest gain, and his absence their greatest losse. The punishment of losse in hell is cast up for a sorer punishment then that of pain: And the losse of God in hell is worse then the
 losse of heaven. Tis so in it's proportion here on earth. Gods withdrawing makes a hell above ground. If ever any people needed the presence of God, we doe. We have reason to crie out with the Psalmist, Be not far from us, O Lord, for trouble is neer. Though out ward peace come to a land, yet, woe unto it when God departs; how woefull then is the condi∣tion of a land, when God departs and trouble comes? When the Prophet Ezekiel had described the Refor∣mation of the Gospel-Temple and City under Iewish notions, he adds this as the accomplishment of all, And the name of the City from that day shall be called (Iehovah Shammah) the Lord is there. Honourable Senatours, That by your suf∣frage and assistance, Truth and holinesse (accord∣ing to the exactest patern) may beautifie our Tem∣ples, That judgement and righteousnesse may flourish in our Cities, and that both may be really baptized with this name, The Lord is there, is the prayer, and (in his sphear) the endeavour of
Sirs,
