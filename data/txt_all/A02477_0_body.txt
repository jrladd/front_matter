SIth grace hath graffed in your Noble brest,
Farre grater gifts then tipe of mundane gle:
Sith high renowme, your Honour, & the rest,
To Vertue yeeld, and counteruayled bee
With great effect of Vertues worthy vew:
I make it bolde for vertues ayde to sew.
And though my gift (as slender to the shoe)
Vnworthy seeme to shrowde himselfe as now
In blessed Bay from force of deadly foe:
Yet Vertue may your Lordships pitie bowe
To fense the Booke beset with deadly hate,
For that the same explanes the present state,
And sets to vew the vices of the time
In Nouell Verse and Satyrs sharpe effect
Still drawne along and pend in playnest rime
For sole intent good liuing to erect:
And sinne rescinde which rifely raignes abroade
In peoples harts full fraught with sinfull loade,

Sith so (I say) therefore your Noble hart
Let grace so guide and bend to Vertues bayte,
That Satirs these (though seeming somwhat tart)
May shielded be from such as lie in waite
The same to shend and bring to fowle decaye:
To deadly shame, and mortall malice aye.
So shall your Lordship shewe your selfe to bee
Sole vertues stay, and friend vnto the good:
So hate to sinne shal men apparaunt see,
And loue set forth to saue the sinfull bloud.
And so shall I encouragde in my paine,
Proceede, and set my Pen to Booke againe.
And euer pray the liuing God of might
Your Lordship so to guide by gift of grace,
That you may stande accepted in his sight
Whilst here you liue, and in the ende a place
Receiue with such as vertues path haue traste:
And liue with them that vertue haue imbraste.
