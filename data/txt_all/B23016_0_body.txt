MADAM;
I Should not with confidence have adventur'd on this Address, and Dedication to Your Majesty of the following Discourse, and in such an Episto∣lary Method, if the weight and greatness of the Subject did not warrant the same; which is e∣qually
divided betwixt the inte∣rest and state of a Christian, and the publick state of the Church with such eminency of Provi∣dence; and wonderful vicissitudes hereof, as have in a successive course, and series been brought forth on the Publick Theatre of Britain in this Age, and now in that late and great event wherein such an august and immediate ap∣pearance of God hath been wit∣nessed, as might still seize the Spi∣rits of Men in this Atheistica Age with a tremendous sense and impression of the sam in both which respects, I hop what is thus humbly offered up∣on so high a concern of truth will not be ungrateful to You Majesty, who is known to valu
Your State and Interest, more as a Christian, than as a Monarch, which was once the saying of Theodosius the Great, and does yet tend to render his memory more honourable than that he was an Emperor.
It is unquestionable that the State and Security of Britain hath stood by an extraordi∣nary course of Providence for these many years past, and that according to the improvement made to answer the intent and ends of such unusual things we may expect in the same man∣ner to have God either for us or against us; and as it is one of the most observed testimonies of Divine favour to a Kingdom and
People, when such are raised on the Throne of Government, who are of as Publick a Spirit as of Relation, for the Interest of Re∣ligion and the true Politick good and safety of such a place, with an impartial respect; so it is no less observable, that where there is an eminent design of Grace in a Saving Work to a Nation, and to prevent a desolating Judg∣ment ere it break forth, how some have been in a more than ordi∣nary way excited with special Heroick Motions to be instru∣mental herein, whose way and appearance for God did not an∣swer to the ordinary standard of Mens actings on which account there have been signal discove∣ries given in this late time to
Britain and Ireland, if there were a more suitable regard of the same; but as the Soveraign God hath, by an astonishing course of extraordinary Provi∣dences, thus made way for the Publick Settlement of this Illand, and to place on the Throne these, whose capacity to Rule might be no less conspicuous from most rare Enduements of mind, than by Regal Authority and Pow¦er; he hath also proportioned to Both Your Majesties, Trials, and Work of an unusual kind, and determined Your Reign in such a juncture of extraordinary try∣ing times, as needs some unusu∣al and great assistance of Divine Counsel and Support, no less
to stemm an Impetuous Tide of Atheism and Impiety within, and to have an awful regard to the Divine Government kept up in these times, then to ap∣pear against the greatest of Ad∣versaries without: Yet surely if Grace may interpose for a resto∣ring work again to these Nati∣ons, and for a suitable answer∣ing to so eminent a season and opportunity, we might then ex∣pect such an appearance of God, as can bring forth that in a day or year, which may seem not easie to expect in an Age, and cause such Mountains, as seem most insuperable in the way hereof, to flow down at his presence.

It's on this Subject I have spoke farther in these Papers, and if some things be not grate∣ful to many in this Day, it was not designed to please Men, or under the influence of a private Interest, but for the Truths sake, as a Minister of Christ, and to rest my Soul on his ap∣proving Testimony herein.
I know Your Majesties desire and delight lies more in serving the Publick good of Britain, and of all the Churches of Christ, than to hear thereof, which does serve a just restraint to speak in this ad∣dress what is due, and more be∣coming to witness at a distance, if
it were not to speak in behalf of God, these singular engagements You are under to him, and for his interest and truth, beyond any Princess on the Earth, or for some Ages past upon it, and that he hath chosen to give Your Maje∣sty such a room, in a rare and un∣usual manner, as on whom he hath delighted to honour, and trust the concerns of his Kingdom to; and to whom he hath given that inte∣rest in the hearts of a People (who are as the sand of the Sea innu∣merable) so as to Govern more by the attractions of love and delight, than by the extent of Ci∣vil Authority; and I may in a par∣ticular way speak, that as it was not possible ever for a Great Per∣son
to part from a People more highly desired and valued, than Your Majesty did from all ranks of that Illustrious State of Hol∣and, so is the same sense, and most desirable remembrance still continued, as a Witness of di∣vine respect that in such a manner is rarely given to Princes and Rulers.
Madam, tho these Papers had, in their first rise, some respect to a more private use, yet being now made publick, wherein truths of so high a concern to this present day, and the state of the Church are offered, it did give the more confidence for a humble claim to the Patronage of so great a name.
It is now a time of great thoughts and expectation, as to the future state of the Catholick Church; and that these Promises are ve∣ry near to their full height and accomplishment which have re∣spect to the highest glory, and ex∣tent of Christ's visible Kingdom on the Earth, before its final tran∣slation to its eternal and trium∣phant state in Heaven; and its much desired and hoped, that Your Majesties Reign may in a pre∣paratory way, be made eminently subservient thereto; it's sure that great event of Providence will, in due time, be the best expounder of its self, and the onely wise God sees it fit to proportion our light here∣in, and further breaking up of the
same to what's necessary for our work and duty; but I have much wished, that the progressive course and coming of Christ's Mediatory Kingdom under the New Testament, and these more remarkable peri∣ods of its gradation, were more studied and enquired into, which should make way for a more clear Idea and Notion of the same according to that pattern given hereof in the Mount by Divine Record; which bears the same re∣semblance to the state of a Christian in its progress and ripening for Heaven by being thus changed from Glory to Glory, until it come at last to that full stature and pitch which it shall have within time: this should, I humbly judge, make
it more easie to decide, and unite these differences of judgment on this Subject, which make so great a noise, and let us see, that there can be no distinct Kingdom of the Lord Jesus expected here on the Earth which is yet to have a beginning, or any such thing as a Fifth Monarchy, but what onely imports the highest advance, and perfections of the Churches state within time. And I hope if these times of the Gentiles, and fulness thereof were in their true sense more deeply considered (which is in this Discourse, but specially in the Appendix touch'd) it might tend to a clearer discerning what watch of the night we are now in, and direct our faith, as to future
things, the fulfilling whereof will be as an entry of the Church into a new horizon, but such where the highest discoveries of light will be of no farther extent, than the Scrip∣tures of truth by a more full under∣standing of the same, which is sure∣ly the most clear and desirable prospect we can have of future times, and that brightness which will be then before the second coming of Christ.
It hath been, and is my se∣rious desire, that Your Maje∣sty, with that truly Wise and Magnanimous Prince the King, may be yet more highly ho∣noured in the work of Your Day, in order to so great an
end, and for a Restoring of these Nations again to God, and that Your Names thus may be trans∣mitted to succeeding Times, as the Restorers of Breaches. I am
MADAM,
