HOnest Country-men, knowing there is no∣thing extant amongst you con∣cerning your Liberties, Laws and Customs, save only some few Written Copies, which thousands of Miners and main∣tainers
of Mines have not; nor if they had, would be much the better, by reason few can read them: Therefore, that every one that can but read might know the Customs of the Mines, was the cause I publisht this Book, which will much profit, and be a ready help to all that's concern'd in mineral Affairs; in regard you have here in a Vade Mecum, or pocket Com∣panion, not only the Liberties, Laws and Customs of the Mines, which all miners and maintainers ought to know▪ but you have also such other things, as are, or may be neces∣sary to be known to such per∣sons, as are, or may be concer∣ned
in Tryals upon Juries, or twenty four men; Bonum quo comunius, eo melius.
I shall not stand to make Apology for the Book, well knowing Momo enim judice ter∣tare frustra; and doubtless this may fall into the hands of such Criticks, who Zoilus and Mo∣mus-like, will be ready to speak ill of what is anothers, but ever fancying and affecting their own; which sort of self-conceited Opinionists I do not think, neither desire to please; But if such rash and hasty Cen∣surers might be premonisht, 'tis requisite they sometimes admit their judgments the pos∣sibility of erring. To conclude,
'tis thee, honest miner, for whom I publisht this, referring those that are curious to our Phylosophia Subterranea, which perhaps may be publisht e're long: However, in the inte∣rim, I offer, and not urge, this to their uses, whose occasions shall require it, and rest a Friend to any ingeniously af∣fected.
