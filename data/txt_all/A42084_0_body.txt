REligion being of that great Excellency as to teach us the Love of God, and our Neighbour, how to Reverence him, and how to be tender-hearted to our Brethren, so as we may best enjoy our selves, and benefit others, I hope you will be pleased not to re∣fuse this ensuing Discourse a just title to your Pa∣tronage. 'Tis true, they who go back from these Duties of Exemplary Piety and Charity, neither regard what Rules they have prescribed, nor what Practice they have directed, nor do they regard any thing that carries the face of Love and true Mu∣nificence, and are only valiant in breaking those Laws, which Heaven hath made Eternal, such a sort of Men have commonly great Judgments de∣nounced against them. They are depriv'd of the Divine Protection here while they live, and af∣ter their Death no Man lamenteth. But on the contrary, many Blessings and Rewards are Entail'd upon Pious and Liberal, the Favour of God in par∣doning

our Sins, a promised Security from Incum∣bent Evils, a bountiful Support under Afflictions, and at length a certain Reception into Eternal Glo∣ry. Cornelius was heard for his Devout Life and Alms-giving. But that I may not be too prolix, if you discern any Imperfections in the Copy, let not these Celestial Graces, for my sake, fall under any Imputation, that need no such Advocate as I am, or such a common Pen, but one from an Angel's Wing to advance their Esteem.
There's a Beauty in Holiness beyond that of State, and a Glory in Humility above the proud Inscrip∣tion of Monarchs; both these wait upon Charity and Integrity of Life, and are the only Ornaments of our Christian Profession. But here that Disrespect you have to the Disregarders of these Duties, puts a stop to my Pen, forbidding me to be too curious in the de∣scription of these Graces, which are so eminently vi∣sible in your Life and Conversation. So that hoping your Candour and Good Temper will give a favourable Reception, to what I have Offered, I humbly take my leave to Subscribe my self
