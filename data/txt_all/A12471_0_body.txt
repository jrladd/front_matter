My Lords:
SIR Robert Cotton, that most learned Treasurer of Antiquitie, having by perusall of my Generall Historie, and others, found that I had likewise un∣dergone divers other as hard hazards in the other parts of the world, reque∣sted me to fix the whole course of my passages in a booke by it selfe, whose noble desire I could not but in part satisfie; the rather, because

they have acted my fatall Tragedies upon the Stage, and rac∣ked my Relations at their pleasure. To prevent therefore all future misprisions, I have compiled this true discourse. En∣vie hath taxed me to have writ too much, and done too little; but that such should know, how little I esteeme them, I have writ this, more for the satisfaction of my friends, and all gene∣rous and well disposed Readers: To speake only of my selfe were intolerable ingratitude; because, having had so many co-partners with me; I cannot make a Monument for my selfe, and leave them unburied in the fields, whose lives be∣got me the title of a Souldier; for as they were companions with me in my dangers, so shall they be partakers with me in this Tombe.
For my Sea Grammar (caused to bee printed by my wor∣thy friend, Sir Samuel Saltonstall) hath found such good en∣tertainment abroad, that I have beene importuned by many noble persons, to let this also passe the Presse. Many of the most eminent Warriers, and others, what their swords did, their penns writ: Though I bee never so much their inferi∣our, yet I hold it no great errour, to follow good examples; nor repine at them, will doe the like.
And now my most Honourable good Lords, I know not to whom I may better present it, than to your Lordships, whose friendships, as I conceive, are as much to each others, as my duty is to you all; and because you are acquainted both with my endevours, and writings, I doubt not, but your honours will as well accept of this, as of the rest, and Patronize it under the shadow of your most noble vertues, which I am ever bound in all duty to reverence, and under which I hope to have shelter, against all stormes that dare threaten.
