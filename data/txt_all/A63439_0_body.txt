My Lord,
IT cannot be thought that the Author of these Travels had he ve∣rily believ'd that there∣by he had eminently serv'd his King and Country, would have adventur'd a Dedication to so great a Monarch as the King of France: Wherein he presumes to tell him, that he was the person that had brought him from the In∣dies the fairest Jewels that at present adorn his Crown; for which & several other ser∣vices done the Kingdom, His Mty. honou∣red him with the Title of Noble. And indeed it is not probable that a Potentate so wise and so discerning, had he not been con∣vinc'd of the merit and good service of his Subject, would have receiv'd him with that esteem, or have honour'd him with

that Title which he bestow'd upon him. As for the Truth of what is here compriz'd, there is his own Asseveration to his Prince of the Exactness which he has observ'd in that particular; which there is the less reason to misdoubt, in regard he has been publick in the World for some time with∣not the least blemish of Contradiction. Be pleas'd then, My, Lord to consider the quality of this Work, and as you are in high Dignity, governing that Famous City which has so great a share in the Traffick of the Oriental world, vouch∣safe it your acceptance, as it is now made serviceable to this City and the whole Nation by
My Lord
