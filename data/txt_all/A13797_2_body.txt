BRaue KNIGHT, whose Vertues far exceed thy yeeres,
The Ornament of thy thrise Noble House,
VVhose Worth is such as findes abroad few Peeres:
So Famous art thou, and Illustrious,
Making the World to wonder at thy Praise,
Whilst to thy selfe new Glorie thou dost raise.


Thou like vnto another Alexander,
Art to thy Countries Foes, a Tamberlaine,
(A Bloody Scourge) whilst thou dost them indanger,
The Proudst of whom, thou makst to yeeld with shame:
Witnes the Siege of AMYENS late in FRANCE,
Wre Knightly Honor thy Seruice did aduance.


Vouchsafe thou then great MARSI's Parent Heire,
To lay aside thy Martiall minde a space,
And view these lines, Th'vntimely Fruits of Care,
Which I desire (though not deserue) to grace:
Gratious thou art with All, then grace to One
This Verse, whose Grace I do entreate alone.



May be, when my coy ALBA shall perceiue,
This Fauour done so kindly vnto me,
She (for a while) from Rigor then will breathe,
Taking Tuce, (though not Peace) from Crueltie.
Grant me this Sute, and I with zeale will pray,
That when thou lou'st, thy Mistris nere say Nay.
