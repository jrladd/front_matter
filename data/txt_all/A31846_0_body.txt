Right Honourable,
IN Obedience to Your Lordships Commands I have published this following Sermon, and now humbly present it to Your favourable Acceptance. The Discourse was suited to the Day, plain and serious; the Subject Matter of it or∣dinary and common, but highly useful and seasonable.
And if any of the Inhabitants of this great City are by the reading of it persuaded to, or better established in the strict Practise of their Religion in all its several Duties, which respect either God or Man, I have obtained my whole Design both in the Preaching and Printing of it.
I beg Your Lordships Pardon, if I take this Op∣portunity to renew my most thankful Acknowledg∣ments of those many particular Favours I have received from Your Lordship, by which I am bound ever to remain
