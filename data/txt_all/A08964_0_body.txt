ACcording to my promise (right ho∣norable) in my for∣mer Epistle made to your Lordship: Both for your more easie reading of this comfortable Oration, concer∣ning
true tranquillitie of the minde, and also for your bet∣ter edifying therein, I haue causde the same to be imprin∣ted. So as, if it please you, be∣tweene whyles, (when vaca∣tion from publique affayres shall giue you leaue) to bestow some priuate exercise therin: you may reape such inestima∣ble comfort and commoditie thereby, as not onely, your Lordship for your part, shall fullye confirme your owne minde in perfite stedfastnesse:
be it in honorable and prospe∣rous dayes (which God bee praised you inioye) eyther in aduersitie, sicknesse, or losse of friendes (which by Gods ap∣pointmēt we mortal men daily are subiect vnto) but also, you shal be able to teach and con∣uince al others, which with cō∣tinuall study, & restlesse tra∣uaile disquiet themselues with worldly vanities: seeking ey∣ther at home where they liue, or else by their industrie in farre Countries, a meane to
obtaine the quietnesse of their mindes, after once so easie a meanes, as is the free accesse to this booke shall be prest before their eies. The Compiler here∣of (while hee liued) of what disposition he was, it appeares by the Booke it selfe: which could not otherwise proceede, then from a godly & iustified spirite. But althoughe, this Translator, eyther in respect of his owne vnworthynesse, may be iudged vnfit, to pre∣sent vnto your Honor so wor∣thy
a thing, & to lay the same before the eies of the world: ei∣ther else, for his manifold im∣perfectiōs, vnhable to expresse in Englishe, the sentences, of so manye Poets and auncient famous doctors of the church, as are comprehended & cited in this little booke: Yet, this is my humble request, that howe much soeuer shal be detracted from my ablenesse and suffici∣ency herein, so much the more may be added to my paines & dyligence taken in the same,
and also to my poore good will borne to your Lordship. If this be performed, and all thankes whatsoeuer, might seeme to be due, by any others taking pro∣fite hereby, be wholy rendred to your Lordship: and your Lordship yeelding the same a∣gaine vnto God: I, for my part shal acknowledge my selfe en∣tirely to haue obtained, for this my zealous indeuour herein bestowed, as great recompence as my heart therein desired.
