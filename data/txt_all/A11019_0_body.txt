HORACE the POET testifieth (right Honourable and vertuous Ladie) that Poets in times past, haue beene addicted either to profit and pleasure them selues and o∣thers, either else in commune to write both sweet and necessary things, for the life of their posteritie. As Heathen Po∣ets haue had this humour, meriting wor∣thie fame, in that by their fained imagi∣nations, they semed to fauour & further the welfare of humaine life. So other wri∣ters haue indeuoured, but not all leueling by one liue to publish their works, some after one manner, some after another, ei∣ther according as the holy spirit of God

had operation of their harts, either lese as their owne singularitie lead them to profit and pleasure them selues and o∣thers, whose imperfection, as their age could not so well discerne, but flattered hir selfe with the nusled ignorance of the time then present, sleeping in absurditie: so when it pleased ye Lord to spred forth the bright beames of his glorious gospel ouer the nations of the earth, such as sa∣uoured of the spirit of God, haue more & more illuminated thē selues & others & such as were blinded in their owne in∣uentions, beeing nakedly manifested to the world, haue with the world bene re∣duced to ful perfection, and awaked out of their dreames, by their posteritie: wher vpon euen the most ancient Poets, Hi∣storiographers & writters, were they now liuing, they might finde no small occasiō to reioyce at the good industrie of their posteritie, euen in these dayes where it is apparantly extāt, yt by studious practitio¦ners of our age, the workes of sundry aū∣cient authors haue made the most fertile increase of fallowed groūds by the sweat of others, which their remisnesse and

imperfection had left as wast ground beefore, whereby their fame is more am∣plified then decreased, vertue more ad∣uaunced then abandoned, and the age present & henceforth more edified, then defrauded of so noble benifits of know∣ledge, and perfection of lyfe.
This as my simple capacitie by dayly experiēce could comprehend in the tra∣uailes of others: So reputing it a thing acceptable and laudable with God and man, I haue wished such abilitie in mee, that I might wade through this streame, to the gratefull acceptation of God, and the world. And the rather doe I take good courage vnto mee heere in, bee∣cause I haue founde no small gratefull good will of such as in this my natiue Countrie, fauouringe vertue and fur∣thering good literature, haue once or twise heeretofore accepted my former slender consecrated studies, in such sort, that I agnize my selfe more indebted to them in power and good will, then I am able, or thinke I shall bee able to performe requitall to their condigne demerites. Among whome the try∣ed

testimonie of your honours most no∣ble bountie, hath not a little excited mee to the consideration of my greatefull du∣tie heerein. And I cannot tell whether God giues it mee for my good hap, that I lately had this worke brought mee by one, whom I suppose sauoureth my good proceeding in, this pointe. Albeit this worke it selfe (beefore I toke it in hand) was both of imperfect phrase in the hi∣storie, & of indecent application in the Moralitie, bearing the title of the Hi∣story of Gesta Romanorum: which when I had diligently perused the circum∣stance thereof, I thought it beehooued mee so to trauaile therein, that I might not onely make a simple thing better, but so to handle the same, that it might gaine mee the better credit for my good meaning. And when I had reformed and repolished so well as I could, the seuerall histories, & corrected the application of the Moralitie in many places, I thought best to adde therevnto (not impertinent for better light and farther intelligence of the Readers capacitie) a forme of Ar∣gument

purposed before euery history which being done, I intituled it A re∣corde of auncient Histories, videlicet, Gesta Romanorum, newly persued and corrected, wherein wishing to bee profi∣ting and pleasing the best, gratefull vnto all, and grudged of none, voide of scru∣ple and blemish of suspition in euerye part, I yeelde the same with all humble and heartie duety, vnder the Honorable patronage and protection of your most noble & magnificent prerogatiue. Most humbly crauing pardon of your honour for my bolde presumption, in dedica∣ting so simple a trauaile vnto you, and no lesse humbly beseeching your good La∣dishippes thanckfull acceptaunce of my vttermost good will in presentatiō here∣of. I hope then to haue the better good will of all others, for supportation of my pretended good meaning heerein. And so right Honourable and vertuous Ladye, shall I finde manifold causes of dutiefull respensation what I may, though to dys∣pēse I shal not be able, yet in good will & power, I am & will bee prest to the vt∣termost performāce of my exacted due∣tie.

In practise & prayer, resting boun∣den to all my will willers. Vnto the li∣uing God I pray amongst all others for the long and prosperous good estate of your Honour in this life: And finally for your established felicitie immutable in the life euerlasting, which God graunte.
Amen.
