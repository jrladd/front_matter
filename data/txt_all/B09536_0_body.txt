SIR,
SInce 'tis Resolv'd that my Private Thoughts must run the Gauntlet through this Censorious Age, and be Exposed as well to the Critical and Unkind, as to the Good humour'd, and the Brave, I cannot think of a more Generous and Worthy Defender then your Self. And the only good O∣pinion I have of my Judgment, is in the Choice I have made of my Patron.

To Treat you Sir, according to th Esteem I have of your Merit, is Care¦fully to avoid all Strain'd and Flo¦rishing Expressions in Praise of thos many Excellent Virtues and Good Qua¦lities all that have the Honour to kno you find you are Master of. No, su Theams tho' full of Truth and Charm are far above my humble Flights, n are you to be Pleased with Attempts  that Nature.
To divert a Youthful Fancy,  Thoughtful Hour, First put me upo these Poetick Strains, but little thoug the unhappy Product would have prov a Fugitive, and given me Cause to ow her with a Blush, but all these Strugglin and unpolish'd Lines, were Surprize from me by a Person who does design t Print them, (if possible) more Unco¦rect then These, which to Prevent, wa
 the only Motive induced me to Publish what I have not Vanity enough to be∣lieve can Oblige so Ingenious an Age as this. But your Powerful Name fix'd in the Front, bears such a Charm, as like the Flaming Sword placed by the Tree of Life, will Shield me from the Fate I justly may deserve.
I never yet Debased my Conversa∣tion with any thing so mean as Flat∣tery, and am sure far from the Odious Vice, when I say you are Critically a Gentleman, in Honour, Birth, and E∣ucation, and tho' that Generous Name erves only now to shelter Inglorious Actions, yet you by Virtuous Princi∣les and Noble Practice, give new Life and Lustre, to the Dying Title; nder such shelter then my Poor Young Blushing Muse must hide from
 the hard Censure of the World, an from your Goodness hope, 'tis only that will make you Suspend your bet¦ter Judgment and Pardon the Errors of,
SIR,
