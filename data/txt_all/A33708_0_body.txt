SIR,
MY Adversaries ha∣ving Dedicated a Piece to You, where∣in

they desire Your Pa∣tronage of Truth, which they pretend to be on their Sides; I also being sufficiently satisfied, that the greatness of Your Soul is such, as not to be amused with Specious Pretensions; have presu∣med, also, to Dedicate this Piece to You; which

altho I have not had time to put into any order, yet it contains most indispu∣table Truths.
I beg not any other Favour of You, than if Truth inclines to my side, that You will afford me Your Patronage, which my own Experience is sufficient to assure me,

that my Request will be as readily granted as de∣sired. I am,
