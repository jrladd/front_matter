THere is a time (saith Salomon) for all things. God hath his time neuer limited; and yet in respect of the execution of his will, he hath his time too, as we see lately by wonderfull ex∣ample. What this age hath seene were enough to make a heathenish Atheist a Christian, and a licen∣tious Christian, a Saint. But examples nor mira∣cles can make men wise, without grace: that which mollified the Isralites, hardned the Egiptians.
Since all things haue their time, there is a time for thankefull acknowledgment, aswell as of impor∣tunate vse. That God who made your Maiestie a meanes for my protection against the torrent of violent greatnes, makes me now a trumpet of your praise, and giues me a time (with some securitie) to sing the songs of Syon vnder the shelter of your gratious acceptance.
The last of these Sermons is the first that euer I

preached before his Maiestie, when I was sworne his Chaplaine. The first is that Sermon for which I was calld in question, and in defence whereof whilst you stood, a great affront was giuen you by an Un∣equall opposite; so that I seemed not to suffer for it alone, but your Maiestie with me. I haue now sent it to your Highnes, that you may see wherein it de∣serued so many great exceptions, or I for it so strict Amos 7. v. 12. 13. a censure. The counsell it giues is plaine, but true. As it hath no rellish of Italian Courtship or Craft, so neither hath it any touch of Romish poyson: but proceeds from the simplicitie of Gods holy Spi∣rit, which teacheth a foolishnes wherewithall to ouerthrow the wisdome of all Machiauelists. This is vpright and honest Truth which makes the Christian an euerlasting Politician; for the gates of hell shall not preuaile against him to his destruction, nor Uphold Doeg, Achitophel, and Haman in prosperitie. To the patron of this Truth I commend your Maiestie in my daily prai∣ers, and my owne innocencie I commend to your Ma∣iestie my most gratious Patronesse,
