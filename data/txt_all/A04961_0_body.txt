ight Honourable:
IN liew of thankes, I am now become your remem∣brancer for Almes, but those spirituall; to bee
 distributed only by such on whom the spirit of glory resteth, and to be conferred chiefly on the glorious rest of the king of glory, the Church mi∣litant I meane, all glori∣ous within.
Was it not the glory of the Rulers and Princes of the Tribes of Israell, to offer willingly among Gods people, for the frame of the Tabernacle, and fabrique of the T∣ple? And as the heart of Deborah was towards the Gouernours of Isra∣el, that offered them∣selues willingly among the people; so did the
 pen of Nehemiah brand the Nobles of the Teko∣ites, that put not their neckes to the worke of the Lord.
Surely, as this is a day of rebuke, wherein the word of mutuall Exhor∣ration (the treasure of spirituall Almes, for edi∣fication of the Temples of the holy Ghost,) is made a reproach; of most men neglected, delighted in of few, and of many derided: so in this day the Lord seekes for a man among vs, to stand in the gap for the Land, that the glory thereof become not as a fading
 flower, and the light thereof as the shadow of death.
Is not this therefore a time for Nicodemus to stand forth among Ru∣lers, Ioseph of Arimathea among Councellors, and Theophilus among No∣bles, to giue witnesse to the truth, and to hold forth the word of life; yea, and with so much more shouting, to cry grace, grace vnto it, by how much the more it is any way disgraced?
Wherfore if any mans eye should be now euill, because among Nobles and Councellors, mine
 eyes are thus hopefully fixed on your Honour for this gracious accla∣mation; this wrong (if any should be) may easi∣ly bee forgiuen mee; be∣cause meere conscience not onely long agoe pro∣cured mee such vndeser∣ued respect in your No∣ble heart, but sithence also many such compas∣sion are fauours, as I ther∣by rest
