MAdame: amonges many
my gratious Lorde your hus∣bandes,
bounden and faythfull
vassales: whome his L. boun∣tie
and Noble vertues doe day∣ly
purchase abrode (vnknowne
to your Honour) I am one: who in my late
sickely solitarinesse, for the recreation of my
weake soule, compacted and deuised these fewe
Psalmes and prayers, which by the commen∣dation
of the godly and learned, I haue pub∣lished:
not to supplye the scarcitie, but to in∣crease
the plentie of heauenly comfortes, wher∣of
England floweth: God graunt vs to vse
theim to his glory, that we maye continually
possesse the light of his louinge countenaunce
Amen. Dedications of works both great and
smale, are comon, for diuerse respectes. Then
let my poore little labour, haue libertie to be∣stowe
it selfe, where it woulde gladliest shewe
the token of a thanckefull harte. Right Hono∣rable

my good Lady, be it therfore your will,
to take this well meante simple trauaile, to your
vse and tuition, that by your estimation of the
same, it maye growe common and acceptable
amongst the verteous sorte of Ladies and gen∣tlewomen:
praying it may be so faythfully oc∣cupied,
as it was of the Authour zelously pur∣posed,
who, your thrall: am of ready endeuour,
to honour and to serue my good Lorde and
you: by all the wayes I canne: humbly besee∣ching
my heauenly Father to preserue and
to blesse you both with longe lyfe in
happie dayes, repleate with grace
and all maner of heauenly
blessinges, to your per∣manent
assuraunce,
of true felicitie.
Amen.
