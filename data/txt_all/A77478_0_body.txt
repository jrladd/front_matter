Right Honourable,
MY long experience of your Lordships sincere zeale to the truth of God, and affection to the liberties of the Church and Kingdome of Scotland, against all enemies whomsoever, hath emboldened me to offer by your Lordships hand to the view of the publick, my following answer to a very bitter enemy of that Church and Kingdome, for their adherence to the sacred truth of God, and their owne just Liber∣t es.
At my first sight of his Book, and many days thereafte,The Authors reasons of his writing. I had no purpose at all to meddle with him: your Lordship knowes how unprovided men of my present condition must be, either with leisure, or accommodations, or a mind suitable for writing of Books. Also Doctor Bramble was so well knowne on the other side of the Sea, the justice of the Parliament of England and Scotland having unanimously condemned him to stand upon the higgest pi∣nacle of infamy, among the first of the unpardonable incendiaries, and in the head of the most pernicious instruments of the late miseries in Britaine and Ireland: and the evident falshood of his calumnies were so clearly con∣futed long ago in printed Answers to the Infamous Authors whence he had borrowed them. I saw lastly the mans spirit so extreme saucy, and his pen so waspish and full of gall, that I judged him unworthy of any answer. But understanding his malicious boldnesse to put his Booke in the hand of His Majesty, of the Prince of Orange, and all the eminent Personages of this place, who can read English; yea to send it abroad unto all the Universities of these Provinces, with very high and insinuating commendations, from the prime favourers of the Episcopall cause: hearing also the threats of that faction to put this their excellent and unanswerable peece, both in Dutch, French, and Latine; that in the whole neighbouring World the reputation of the Scots might thereby be wounded, killed, and buried, without hope of recovery; I found it necessary, at the desire of divers friends, to send this my review after it, hoping that all who shall be pleased to be at the paines of comparing the Reply with the challenge, may be induced to pronounce him not only a rash, untimous, malicious, but also a very false accuser. This much justice doe I expect from every judicious and equitable comparer of our wrytes, upon the hazard of their censure to fall upon my side.The Prelate are unable by reason to defend E∣piscopacy.
His invectives against us are chiefly for three things, our Discipline, our Covenant, our alleaged unkindnes to our late Soveraigne. My apology for the first, is, that in discipline we maintaine no considerable conclusion, but
 what is avowed by all the Reformed Churches, especially our Brethren of Holland and France, as by the approbatory suffrages of the Universitie of Leyden, Utrecht and others, to the theorems whereupon our adversary doth build his chiefe accusations, may appeare. If our practise had aberred fro the common rule, the crookednesse of the one ought not to prejudge the straitnesse of the other: though what our adversary alleadgeth of these ab∣errations is nothing, but his owne calumnious imputations: the chiefe quar∣rell is our rule it self, which all the Reformed harmoniously defend with us, to be according to Scripture; and the Episcopall declinations, to be beside and against the line of the word, yea Antichristian.
If our Prelates had found the humor of disputing this maine cause to stir in their veines, why did they not vent it in replyes to Didoclavius, and Ger∣some Bucerus, who for long thirty years have stood unanswered? or if fresher meats had more pleased their tast, why did not their stomacks venture on Salmasius or Blondels books against Episcopacy? If verball debates had liked them better than writing, why had none of them the courage to accept the conference, with that incomparably most learned of all Knights now living, or in any bygone age Sir Claud Somayis, who by a person of honour about the King did signifie his readinesse to prove before His Majesty, against any one, or all his Prelaticall Divines, that their Episcopacy had no warrant at all in the word of God, or any good reason?
Their strong∣est Argu∣ments are tricks of Court.But our friends are much wiser then to be at the trouble and hazard of any such exercise; the artifices of the Court are their old trade, they know better how to watch the seasons, and to distribute amongst themselves the houres of the Kings opportunities, when privately without contradiction they may instill in his tender mind their corrupt principles, and instruct him in his ca∣bine, how safe it is for his conscience, and how much for his honor, rather to ruine himself, his Family, and all his Kingdoms, with his own hands, then to desert the holy Church, that is, the Bishops and their followers; then to joyne with the rebellious Covenanters, enemies to God, to his Father, to Mo∣narchy that the embracing of the barbarous Irish, the pardoning of all their monstrous murders, the rewarding of their expected merits with a free liber∣ty of Popery, and accesse to all places of the highest trust, though contrary to all the Lawes which England and Ireland has known this hundred yeares; all this without and before any Parliament, must be very consistent, with conscience, honour, and all good reason. Yea to bind up the soule of the most sweet and ingenuous of Princes, in the chaines of their slavery for ever, they have fallen upon a most rare tricke, which hardly the inventions of all their Predecessors can paralell. They rest not satisfied, that for the uphold∣ing of their ambition and greed,The Bishops unlucky foot is visible in . they did harden our late Soveraigne to his very last in their Errours, and without compassion did drive him on to his fatall praecipice; unlesse they make him continue after his death to cry loud every day in the eares of his Sonne in his later will and testament, to follow him in that same way of ruine; rather than to give over to serve the lusts of the Prelaticall Clergy. They have gathered together His Majesties last papers, and out of them have made a Booke, whereupon their best pens
 have dropped the greatest eloqution, reason and devotion was among them, by way of essayes; as it were to frame the heart of the Son by the fingers of the dying Father to piety, wisedome, patience, and every virtue; but ever and anon to let fall so much of their owne ungracious dew, as may irrigat the seeds of their prelaticall Errors and Church interest; so farre as to charge him to presevere in the maintainance of Episcopall governement upon all hazards, without the change of any thing except a little p. 278. and to assure that all Covenanters are of a faction engaged into a Religious rebellion, who may never be trusted till they have repented of their Covenant: and that till then never lesse loyalty justice or humanity may be expected from any, then from them; that if he stand in need of them hee is undone, for they will devoure him as the Serpent does the dove.
These and the like pernicious maxims framed by an Episcopall hand, of purpose to separate for ever the King from all his covenanted subjects, how far they were from the heart, language and writings of our late Soveraigne, all who were aquainted with his cariage and most intime affections at New-Castle in the Isle of Wight, and thereafter, can testify. But it is reason when the Prelates do frame an Image of a King that they should have liberty to place their owne image in its forehead, as the statuary of old did his, in the Boss of Pallas targe, with such artifice that all her worshipers were necessitat to worship him, and that no hand was able to destroy the one without the dis∣solution and breaking in peeces of the oher; yet our Prelats would know, that in this age their be many excellent Engyneers, whose witty practicks transcend the most skilfull experiments of our Auncestors: and whatever may be the ignorance or weaknes of men, wee trust the breath of our Lords mouth will not faile to blow out the Bishop from the Kings armes, without any detriment at all to royalty. Allwayes the wicked and impious cunning of these craftmen is much to be blamed who dare be bold to insert and en∣grave themselfes so deeply in the images of the Gods as the one cannot be intended to be picked out of the other more then the Aple from the eye, un∣les the subsistence of both be But in hazard.
The other matter of his railing against us is the solemne league and co∣venant;The only crime of the Covenant, is that it extir∣pate prelacy. when this nimble & quick enough Doctor comes aflicted with all the reasons the whole University of Oxford can afford him, to demonstrat it as he ptofesses in his last Chapter, to be wicked, false, void, and what not; we find his most demonstrative proofs to be so poore and silly that they infer nothing of his conclusion. To this day no man has shewed any errour in the matter of that covenant; as for our, framing and taking of it, our adversa∣ries drave us thereunto, with a great deale of necessity, and now being in it, neither their fraud nor force may bring us from it againe; for we feare the oath of God. After much deliberation we found that covenant the sove∣raigne meanes to joyne and keep together the whole orthodox party in the three Kingdomes, for the defence of their Religion and liberties, which a popish, prelaticall and malignant faction with al their might were over∣turning, who still to this day are going on in the same designe, without any visible change, in the most of their former principles. And why should any
 who loves the King hate this covenant, which is the straytestry the world can devise, to knit all to him and his posterity, if so be his Majesty might be pleased to enter therein? but by all meanes such a mischief must be aver∣ted, for so the root of Episcopacy would quickly wither without any hope of repullulation; an evill far greater in the thoughts of them who now mannage the conscience of the Court, then the extirpation of Monarchy, the eversion of all the three Kingdomes, or any other earthly misery.
The Bishops are most justly cast out of Eng∣land.As for the third subject of the Warners fury against us, our unkindnes to the late King, if any truth were in this false challenge, no other creature on earth could be supposed the true cause thereof, but our unhappy Pre∣lats: all our grievances both of Church and Sate, first and last, came princi∣pally from them: had they never been authors of any more mischief, then what they occasioned to our late Soveraigne, his person, family and Do∣minions this last dozen of yeares, there is abundant reason of burying that their praeter and Antiscripturall order in the grave of perpetuall infamy. But the truth is, beside more ancient quarrels, since the dayes of our fathers the Albigenses, this limb of Antichrist has ever been witnessed against; Wicklise, Huss, and their followers were zealous in this charge, till Luther and his disciples got it flung out of all the reformed world, except England; where the violence of the ill-advised princes did keep it up for the perpetu∣all trouble of that land, till now at last it hath well neer kicked downe to the ground there both Church and Kingdome.The Scots were never injurious to their King. As for the point in hand, we deny all unkindnes to our King whereof any reasonable complaint can be framed against us. Our first contests stand justified this day by King and Parliament in both Kingdomes. When his Majestie was so ill advised as to bring down upon our borders an English army for to punish our refusing of a world of novations in our Religio contrary to the laws of God and of our country, what could our land doe lesse then lie down in their armes upon Dunce law for their just and necessry defence? when it was in their power with ease to have dissipat the opposite army, they shew themselves most ready upon very easy conditions to goe home in peace, and gladly would have rested there, had not the furious Bishops moved his Majestie without all provocation, to break the first peace and make for a second invasion of Scotland, only to second their unreasonable rage: was it not then necessary for the Scots to arme againe? when they had defeat the Episcopall Army and taken New-castle, though they found nothing considerable to stand in their way to Lon∣don, yet they were content to lie still in Northumberland, and upon very meane tearms to return the second time in peace. For all this the Prelats could not give it over, but raised a new Army and filled England with fire and sword, yea well neere subdued the Parliament and their followers, and did almost accomplish their first designes upon the whole Isle. The Sco then with most earnest and pitifull entreaties were called upon by their Brethren of England for helpe, where unwilling that their brethren should perish in their sight, and a bridge should be made over their carcasses for a third warre upon Scotland, when after long triall they had found all their intercessions with the King for a modern and reasonable accomodation
 slighted and rejected, they suffered themselves to be perswaded to enter co∣venant with their oppressed and fainting brethren, for the mantainance of the common cause of Religion and liberty, but with expresse Articles for the preservation of royalty in all its just rights in his Majestie and his posterity; what unkindnes was here in the Scots to their King?
When by Gods blessing on the Scots helpe the opposite faction was fully subdued, his Majestie left Oxford with a purpose for London,The Scots selling of the King is a most false calumnie. but by the seve∣rity of the ordinances against his receivers, he diverted towards Linn, to ship for Holland or France; where by the way fearing a discovery and surprise, he was necessitate to cast himselfe upon the Scots army at New-wark; upon his promise to give satisfaction to the propositions of both Kingdomes, he was received there and came with them to New-castle: here his old oaths to adhaere unto Episcopacy hindred him to give the expected satisfaction. At that time the prime leaders of the English army were seeking with all earnestnes occa∣sion to fall upon the Scots, much out of heart and reputation by Iames Gra∣hame and his Irishes incursions, most unhappy for the Kings affaires: Scotland at that time was so full of divisions, that if the King had gone thi∣ther they were in an evident hazard of a present war both within among them∣selfs, and without from England: our friends in the English Parliament whom we did, and had reason to trust, assured us that our taking the King with us to Scotland, was the keeping of the Sectarian Army on foot, for the wrack of the King, of Scotland, of the Presbyterian party in England; as the sending of his Majestie to one of his houses neer London, upon the faith of the Parliament of England, was the onely way to get the Sectaryes disarmed, the King and the people settled in a peace, upon such tearmes as should be satisfactory both to the King and the Scots and all the wel-affected in England. This being the true case, was it any, either unjustice, unkindnes or imprudence in the Scots to leave the King with his Parliment of England? was this a sel∣ling of him to his enemyes? the monys the Scots received at their departure out of England had no relation at all to the King, they were scarce the sixth parte of the arreares due to them for bygon service; they were but the one halfe of the sum capitulat for, not only without any reference to the King, but by an act of the English Parliament excluding expresly from that Trea∣ty of the armies departure all consideration of the disposall of the Kings per∣son. The unexpected evills that followed in the Armyes rebellion in their seasing on London, destroying the Parliament, murthering the King, no mortall eye could have forseen. The Scots were ever ready to the utmost of their power to have prevented all these mischiefes with the hazard of what was dearest to them; notwithstanding of all the hard measure they had of∣ten received both from the King and the most of their friends in England. That they did not in time and unanimously stur to purpose for these ends, they are to answer it to God, who were the true Authors; the innocency of the Church is cleered in the following treatise. Among the many causes of these miseries the prime fountaine was the venome of Episcopall principles which some serpents constantly did infuse by their speaches and letters in the cares and heart of the King o keep him off from giving that satisfaction to
 his good subjects which they found most necessary and due; the very same cause which ties up this day the hands of covenanters from redressing all pre∣sent misorders could they have the King to joyne with them in their cove∣nant, to quit his unhappy Bishops, to lay aside his formall and dead Litur∣gie, to cast himselfe upon the counsels of his Parliaments it were easy to prophecie what quickly would become of all his enemies: but so long as E∣piscopall and malignant agents compasseth him about (though al that comes neer may see him as lovely, hopefull, and promising a prince for all naturall endowements as this day breaths in Europe, or for a long time has swayed a Scepter in Britaine) yet while such unlucky birds nest in his Cabin, and men so ungraciously principled doe daily besiege him, what can his good people doe but sit downe with mournfull eyes and bleeding hearts, till the Lord amend these otherwise remediles and insuperable evils? but I hold here lest I transgresse to farr the bounds of an Epistle
Th eason off he dedi∣cation.I count it an advantage to have you Lordship my judge in what here and in my following treatise, I speak of Religion, the liberties of our country and the Royall Family: I know none fitter then your Lordship, both to discerne and decerne in all these matters. Me thinks I may say it without flattery (which I never much loved either; in my self or others) that among all our Nobles for constancy in a zealous profession, for exemplary practise in publick and privat duties, the mercie of God has given to your Lordship a reputation second to none. And for a rigid adhaerence to the Rights and Priviledges of your Country, according to that auncient disposition of your Noble Family, noted in our Historians, especially that Prince of them George Buchanan, the Tutor of your Grand-Father, I know none in our Land who will pretend to go before you; and for the affaires of the King, your in∣terest of blood in the Royall Family is so well known, that it would be a strange impudency in me, if in your audience I durst be bold wittingly to give finistrous information. Praying to God that what in the candid inge∣nuity and true zeale of my spirit, I present under your Lordships patrociny unto the eye of the World, for the vindication of my mother Church and Country, from the Sicophantick accusations of a Stigmatised incendiary, may produce the intended effects.
