MY LORD,
THe imputation that lies on Dedications, is general: and wehther the ill nature of the Age has traduc'd the honest intentions of the Writers; or they, by their fulsom corruptions, to their own wrong, having justly fix'd the Scandal upon them∣selves, your Lordship may determine: This I believe, a Poet may praise his Patron out of countenance, and a Lover look his Mistris into the confusion of a Blush, and with as little Wit on one hand, as Passion on t' other. The fear of falling under the Justice of this censure, has awed me: and nothing, but the zeal of confessing my self, every way your Servant, (having hardly scap'd the venture of the Stage) cou'd perswade me to throw my self, for a forgiveness, upon a second trial of the Town. The reason of my cause has hardned me
 against the malice of detraction, and over-rul'd my fears to a Dedication. The Name of Ossory, I know, will draw every Reader into an expectation of a Pane∣gyrick; and not to rage under the inspiration of that Theme, is grosness, and brutal stupidity, to be shun'd of all the World; and here unpardonable, as wou'd be my impudence, should I undertake it. The vertues of your famous Ancestors, my Lord, live fresh among us; and while the English Chronicle survives, the Ormond worth can never be forgotten; your Grand∣father, in every glorious Action, through the whole Story, must begin the Page, shine out, and shew the leading Heroe there. Fortune has once been just, and joining with the wishes of all good men, con∣triv'd to make the Happiness of your Lordships life, answer the Quality of your House; and to the No∣bility of your Birth (made yet more noble by the accession of your Father's Glories) (which you of right inherit, and which your forward Vertue, this Summer promises to maintain) provided you a Lady, whom Nature, in the profusion of her bounty, seems to have made, and only meant for you; to share that greatness, which only Descent, Vertue, Wit, and Beauty, like hers, cou'd deserve. My Lord, you are now launch'd out into the Ocean of this life; and may prosperous gales, and smiling Summer
 Seas attend you: may your course be steady; still pointing to that genuine Loyalty (the natural vertue of your Family) which your Forefathers nobly try'd, and found the only Goal of Glory: these, with my Prayers for your long life, and happy, safe return, are the constant, and shall be the daily wishes of
My Lord,
