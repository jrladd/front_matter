SIR, to none haue I beene more beholding, then to your kind
parents, far (I must truly confesse) aboue the measure of my
deserts: Many there be in England of whom for some par∣ticularitie
I might iustly challenge greater merit, had I not
beene borne in so euill an houre, as to be poisoned with that gaule
of ingratitude: to your selfe am I ingaged for many more curte∣sies
then I imagined could euer haue beene found in one of so few
yeares: nothing doe I more desire then that those hopes of your
toward and vertuous youth, may prooue so pure in the fruite as
they are faire in the bloome: long may you liue to their comfort
that loue you most; and may I euer wish you the encrease of all
good fortunes.
