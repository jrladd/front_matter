May it please your Grace,
IF Art, Wit, and Ingenuity, be Accomplish∣ments
no less than Illustrious, even in the
meanest Pedant, advancing him to the em∣braces
of Men of Dignity in the world;
then how much more do these Oriental
Gemms send forth their luster when rightly set within
the highest Nobility? Such splendid men cannot be sup∣posed
to cultivate barren Nature by unwearied industry
to make it bloom and bear such honourable Endow∣ments
only (if at all) to make a Trade of Art and
Wit, or to use Ingenuity upon a Principle of meer necessi∣ty,
thereby to advance a Livelyhood. 'Tis not a little
crediting to those whose Birth hath placed them among
the most ignoble and mean, to bestow their Time and
Life upon the good use and wise improvement of the
intellectual and reasoning faculty, if so be their design



tend to the lawful Pleasure, or necessary Profit of
Mankind; but certainly, Art, Wit, and Ingenuity,
can never be more magnificent, than where they are the
off-spring of pure choice, and where there is enough of
the world to tempt the Owner to other Divertisements,
and such as much more gratifie or humour the Animal
Life, that which Sense and the lower appetite doth much
more incline unto. I am confident that these Excellen∣cies
which I have been magnifying, are truly the Cha∣racter
of your Grace, and here I doubt not to obtain
the Votes of all experienced and impartial men to the
truth of what I affirm. It's true, that in some other ca∣ses.
your Grace hath sometimes been bespattered by
evil tongues, and confronted by malign endeavours;
but here it hath been your Glory to be vindicated by
the Justice of the Nation, which by a small inspection
into these mens Lives and Actions, hath placed them
in the number of the most treacherous and vile, and so
hath brought your Glory and Innocence from under the
obscuring Cloud, without your own seeking: This
hath tended much to your Greatning in the esteem of
all those whose sobriety and consideration hath made
them valuable.
Let it be also observed, That your Grace hath well
demonstrated your Religious Principles to be hearty
and devout towards the Church of England, and
therein with great zeal displaid your Loyalty towards
His Majesty, by your constant encouraging the dis∣covery
of this late Damnable Popish Plot, which
designed to cut off our Soveraign, and so our Church
at one stroke. These things laid together, must needs



render your Grace the most fit Judg and best Patron
of what may in the least pretend to Art, Wit, or In∣genuity,
of what also refers to an abused Prince under
all his Dangers and Sufferings; and in the last place,
of what belongs to the Intrigues and Malignity of cun∣ning
and desperate Plotters. I do therefore most hum∣bly
present what ensues, to your Graces perusal and
acceptance, begging leave to be ever,
