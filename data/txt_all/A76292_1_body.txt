IT is a statute in deep wisdoms lore,
That for his lines none should a Patron chuse,
By wealth or poverty, by lesse or more,
But who the same is able to peruse:
Nor ought a man his labour dedicate,
Without a true and sensible desert,
To any power of such a mighty state:
But such a wise defendresse as thou art;
Thou great and powerfull Muse, then pardon me,
That I presume thy maiden cheeke to staine,
In dedicating such a worke to thee,
Sprung from the issue of an idle braine:
I use thee as a woman ought to be,
I consecrate my idle houres to thee.
