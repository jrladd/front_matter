Most Noble, and My verie Speciall Good LORD,
YOur vpright loue of the TRVETH professed by the REFORMED CHVRCH, now openlie knowne and notified to manie, but to mee manie yeares agoe evidentlie certayne, as it doeth vndoubted∣lie portend and promise to all your Friends, the plentifull Blessings of GOD vpon your Lo. and

your most Religious Ladie, and your most noble Progenie and House; so lykewyse it gayneth vnto your Lo. the true affections of those who feare GOD according to His word. Your worldlie Greatnesse may purchase you outward atten∣dance; but your Pietie and Humanitie doe com∣mand inward Benevolence, and make conquest of the will and affections of men, to doe you honour and service. And, which is most of all, this grace given to you of GOD, is an Earnest of Eternall Happinesse. Your zeale of GOD, lest it should bee without knowledge, hath carried you to an accurate tryall of all thinges, and to a wyse holding of that which is best. And for bet∣ter information of others also, in these present Dissensions and commotions, Your Lo. lay de vpon mee this piece of paynes, which I humblie lay downe at your Lo. feete. And I pray GOD Almightie, the GOD of Trueth, the LORD of Peace Himselfe, who hath commanded vs to loue Trueth and Peace, to make vs all of one mynde, according to IESUS CHRIST and to giue vs Peace alwayes, and by all meanes: which is also heartilie wished to your good Lo. and to all yours, By
OLD ABERDENE, 6 Aprill, 1638.
