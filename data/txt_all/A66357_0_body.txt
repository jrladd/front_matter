Gentlemen:
THE unhappinesse to be amongst the low∣est of men, for parts and fortune, can∣not hinder mee from the satisfaction which I receive in my selfe, that none is possessed with a more eager passion of contributing towards the advancing Virginia to that degree of felicity which the bounty of nature, richnesse of soyle, and temperature of Climate designed her to: and were my power but of as strong a Wing as my inclinations and desires, that above-example Countrey should be placed in such a Zenith of stability, wealth, and glory, that it should behold all the other Nationall happinesses of the World in a Sphere beneath her; and her Merchants Adventurers and Planters, like so many Load-starres to conduct Mankinde into an innocent O∣cean of unfathom'd wealth of unrocky prosperity.
No Countrey under the Sunne is lesse ingratefull then Virginia, if she be but justly courted, but to Complement a Virgin for her affection by breathing smoake in her nostrils,

to expresse our Civilities by vapour; and for all that vast Dowry of spaciousnesse, wealth, bounty of aire, and plenty of provisions, to proffer her a joynture of Tobacco, is a Com∣plement indistinguishable from incivill rudenesse.
What Riches may not the Silke-worme, Vine, Olive, and Almond afford us? By these noble undertakings wee contract China two thousand Leagues nearer to us, and are not trou∣bled though Spaine and Italy were remooved five thousand more distant from us: and if wee could not satisfie the impla∣cable curiosity of our Senses without the Easterne Spices, it i without dispute, that what every Orient hath of Aromatick, ould grow without any deterioration in this incomparable Countrey.
Yet if, by some occult propriety of nature, these Spices, and Gummes should not prosper with that successe in the Coun∣trey o which they are onely adoptive, as where they are natu∣rall: The South Sea flowing upon the skirts of this gloriously apparelled Virgin, would not onely furnish us, but (through our meanes) all the Westerne Worl with whatever the Philip∣pines and China have in heir brow, or bosome: which that it may be discovered, a Publique incouragement from the Merchans here, and the Colony here, would awaken all spirits which have any scintillation of Honour, or industry, to under∣take the imployment, effect it undertaken, and by the effect raise an unperishable structure for their owne glory, perpetua∣ted by the publique felicity.
The greaest defect that Colony can with consent complaine of, is their want of shipping, and the greatest with which o∣thers finde hemselves perplexed, is the want of industry to build them. If Virginia had not as stately Timber as any other Region whasoeer: is it had no a Soyle naturally in∣viting them to improve her in Iron for Gunnes, Anchors,

and other conveniences; in Hempe for Cordage, Flax for Canvase, and Pine trees for Mast: this defect might be allowed for reall: but where all these concenter, it is as unreasonable to complaine, as for a man seated at a Table covered with excellent provision, to accuse his fortune for suffering him to perish wih hunger, because his meat is not digested in his stomack, wihout putting his hands and teeth to labour.
I could cordially wish that there were such quantity of clea∣red ground in Virginia, that every one at his fist arrivall might ix upon the Plough, that the so much discoursed of Saples of Wheat and Rye, might be brought to an absolute ripenesse of perection: But to imagin so many millions of trees of a facile removall, or that old Planters knowing the benefit thence arising, should part with them to ohers, and seeke new uncleared grounds for themselves, were meerely to dreame of impossibilities.
But the Vine, Almond, and Olive, may be set where the tree is onely barked about to hinder it from leaving; be∣sides if here were a necessiy to have absolutely cleared grounds, (hich reason it selfe cannot imagine,) yet foure Acres of ground so cleared or the Vine, will reurne (by much) more profi, and lsse trouble, then twenty Acres of Wheat, at such raes as they are prized in the common estimation.
But since his profi reverts to the Purse wihout the toyle of radicaing trees, as great emlument, as if the ground were alogeher treelsse, to what purpose should we court sweat and afflction? or increase our miseries wihout any addition to ou happinsse?
Genlemen, he happinesse o this Ntion depends upon your costancy and prosperiy, i you seriously erect these staples, wee shall be free rom the imperious usurpations of forraigne Prin∣ces

upon your estates, and shipping, from the rapine of Pirates upon your lives or liberties. The decayed number of our ship∣ping may be resupplyed by encouragement of Carpenters of all Nations, to make use of those materialls which the inimi∣table liberality of this Countrey gratefully presents you with: all Staples (diffusively spread in other Regions) will meet here united, and we shall arrive to that degree of happinesse, to make our intrade by much exceed our exportations: for the compleating of which, if such an inconsiderable, and lost thing as my selfe, could be any way instrumentall, I should as cheer∣fully hazard my life in the employment, as I now subscribe my selfe,
