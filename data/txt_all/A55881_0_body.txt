Christian Friends,
ALthough the whole Is∣rael of God are dear to me, and after whose Consolation I am greatly long∣ing; yet you are the People a∣bove all others with whom I have been most concerned, and unto whom I am most engaged, and therefore to you chiefly do I dedicate these my small La∣bours; who though I have been a long time in Congregational Union with one of you, yet my growth in the most true Divinity is very small; for when I was in the chief of natural Perfections, and being of low Stature, and climbing a Tree to see JESƲS, like Za∣cheus, my feet slipping, thereby I got a dangerous fall, and you, though you used all the means you could devise for my reco∣very, yet it proved all in vain, till at last Addressing your selves to the Father of Mer∣cies, after many Prayers and Tears were made and spent, you obtained an answer of Peace; but it was to me an an∣swer by such terrible things in Righteousness, that it left such deep impresses on my Soul, the which lasting time can hardly declare, yet I being very weak in my Spirit, and unfit for acti∣on, it pleased the wise Physici∣an of Souls to retire me for al∣most Seven Years, into a den of Darkness, and a place of many dangers and difficulties, where I lived by such Provi∣sions as your earnest Prayers procured for me of the Father of Mercies; at last after many a dangerous wound by the sting of the fiery Serpent, the na∣ture of which being known to God and me, this longed-for Trumpet of Jubilee was graci∣ously sounded in mine ears, viz. Tell her that her War∣fare is accomplished; yet I a∣bode in this retirement for some time after, and then at length obtained a full release; but much of the shining dross of this World, together with the deforming Leprosie of Cor∣ruption, was happily left be∣hind me; but then I could hard∣ly leave that Society of
Wor∣cester, with whom my Spirit was now so deeply intangled, and having obtained leave of you, I abode with them; the issue of which, was to me a state of joy and trouble; for when I beheld you, O ye my dear Friends of
Worcester, so strong∣ly assaulted by the seat of vio∣lence, I almost dispaired of your security, and fell for a season into such a fainting state, that I had but little natural strength left in my Body; yet obtained help of God by strong assaults at the Throne of Grace, and you and I came out of that Tribulation with little inward or outward damage. But Satan began to work, against us some other way, by which both I and some of you were sore wounded in the house of our Friends, the which I greatly desired might still be born with a Christian calmness, but hard∣ly obtained my desire herein, as the event did shew, therefore some of you giving way to the unruly Spirit of Belial, he let in divers other Spirits into your Souls, till some of you became dangerously intangled in the Spirit of Apostacy, and others of you stood tottering in great dimness and sore dis∣couragements, which sunk me down into a second and more great dispair, for when I saw the Weeds grow so fast, and there was no way to root them out, I sorely feared the whole Field would be forsaken for them; but at last the workers of Iniquity began to go to their own place, and so the little Children had a little relief. And while we were thus en∣tangled in Pihahiroth, in the Mountains of Straits, I was im∣portuned, and at last consented to write down the sum and substance of my belief about those things our Mothers an∣gry Children had me in suspiti∣on; but while I was exerci∣sed about these things, some things fell out concerning some persons, which made me like Moses, break the Tables, and so this ensuing Treatise lay almost asleep for a good while; yet I had many fears in my Spi∣rit, by reason of my neglect herein, both before and after I came to
Leicester Prison, where now by the Grace of God, in the midst of some distractions, I have at last finished this brief description of the estate of the true Church of Christ. And for∣asmuch as it was by reason of you, O ye my dear Friends of Litchfield, that I was first cast into these parts, by whose im∣portunity also, at last these Pa∣pers have been compleated, you must needs be taken into the number of those to whom they are now dedicated, for you have been and still are exceed∣ing dear to me; and concern∣ing you, I have had more than
ordinary experience of the Mer∣cy of the Holy, both in natural and spiritual things, even at all times, and have felt great be∣nefit by your Prayers, as I be∣lieve, both to Soul and Body; therefore I cannot but esteem and prefer you with those Soci∣eties with whom I have had more long acquaintance, unto whom, all of you together, do I present these the first fruits of my poor endeavours; desiring you to make the best constru∣ction of it, and carefully to weigh and consider, before you approve or reject ought you find therein. And now the heart∣searching God, that tryeth the Heart and all things, knoweth my end in these Papers, and I have declared it in part in the Epistle to the Courteous Rea∣der, and do yet again profess to you, that I desire as well as I can, the glory of God, the advantage of Truth, the bene∣fit and satisfaction of Souls,
the which I beseech the Father of Mercies to bring to pass; and though I have been as one of the feeble, and as a Tree shaken with the wind among you, yet have I not kept back ought that
I had from you, that I judged might have been pro∣fitable for the good of your Souls; but like one of the lit∣tle Children in the Market∣place, have been ready upon all occasions to talk with you touching those things which concerns our Fathers Kingdom, the which being a land of di∣stances unto many of us, we have shewed our selves to be like that Man whose eyes
Jesus had almost opened, and so could see Men but seem to walk as Trees, and we have yet need, notwithstanding all our great confidence, to be crying to the Lord for a second Touch, that all the scales might fall from our Eyes; and I do know well that I have but a dim Sight, and a stamering Tongue, it is too much to be doubted that others also are somewhat dull of hear∣ing, and from hence it might and yet may arise, that our Mo∣thers Children have had some occasion to be angry with me; however I am greatly inclined to still them as well as I can, so that I may keep Truth from fal∣ling in the Streets, and a good Conscience from being violated by any means. And you may plainly percieve that I have no end at my own glory in these things, in that I have not at∣tempted to beautifie it at all with humane wisdom, but with great simplicity as becomes the Title it presents it self to view. Neither do I mind mine out∣ward profit by any thing that is now undertaken, my mind being but little enclined there∣unto, ever since you and I have had to do one with another. And by reason of many natu∣ral Impediments, both pains and loss are like to be my pre∣sent rewards, and you are wit∣nesses, and God also, that I have coveted no mans Gold, or Silver, or Apparel, though I migt have had all these from you with right true desire, but these hands for the most part, through the good providence of God, hitherto ministred unto my necessities, and so what I have freely received, I would freely give again, desiring the Ever Blessed God to make all my poor endeavours, as the wilderness-Feast of Barly Bread and Fishes, which was blessed for the nourishment of very many Souls. So not being wil∣ling to burden you too much, nor too long to detain you from the things that follow, I desire earnestly the continuance of your serious requests for me, as I hope mine will be still for you,
