My LORD,
THis Learned Treatise of the Famous Malebranch begs the Favour of your Lordships Patronage, and if any thing could do so, would almost deserve it. All great Genius's are nearly related to one another, at least there is a sort of Sympathy between them; and the Wits of France have never fail'd of a kind Re∣ception from those in England, which the most Cruel Wars cannot hinder, nor does Love to our Country forbid us from doing Justice to theirs. The Translation of good French Books into our Tongue, is a Reprisal on their Nation, who have taken the same way by such Writings as are Famous in Antiquity, doing all that was in their Power for an Universal Language, perhaps to make way for Universal Em∣pire. So that Translation from them again, is only a Countermining them, and Fencing with them at their own Weapons: And this perhaps might succeed as well in our Language as any in Europe, since 'tis much
fuller and stronger, and consequently capa∣ble of mending an Original; and indeed no∣thing can hinder it, but want of Encou∣ragement from Men in Power, or Weak∣ness in the Performance. For the First, there is no one that can justly complain of it, who has the Ambition of placing the Name of Normanby before his Writings, it gives him a new Soul, and he ought nei∣ther to think or write meanly when he con∣siders at whose Altars his Labours are of∣fer'd. For the Second, I have as little to say for it, as I could wish our Criticks may have to say against it: The Errors that have escap'd the Press in the Original, the Diffi∣culty of the Subject, the Confinement of Language for fear of spoiling the Philoso∣pher to gratifie the Gentleman, my own necessary Avocations, and the very little time I did it in, cannot promise so correct a Translation, as perhaps it otherwise might have been, yet I am willing to believe, it may in some measure be useful to such as can read it without Prejudice; and it being de∣sign'd by the Author, only for such as are willing to know the Errors of their Senses and Imagination, and the Weakness of the Humane Mind, in order to discover Truth and Happiness, I cannot be very uneasie about anticipating its Fate amongst others, especially under your Lordships Protection.

Indeed I may very well be Ambitious and Proud of such a Protection, when the Government begins to be so very Sensible of the Happy Influences of your great Abilities and Interest. 'Tis a rare Happiness to have Prudence in Coun∣cil, joyn'd with Bravery in Action: Nay the same Man may be a Politick-General, and Master of much Personal Valour, yet be far enough from an Accomplish'd Statesman: But to think coolly, yet act warmly, to seize and improve every Advantage, and yet pierce into the Depths of Futurity, and disintangle intricate and distant Causes and Effects, are only Accom∣plishments for such a King as ours, and such a Minister of State as your Lordship.
Nor are your great Abilities to serve the Publick Good, without particular Instances of your Personal Hazards and Signal Zeal for its Preservation in the late Dutch Wars, when your Lordship was pleased to Com∣mand the Royal Catherine, a Post that was the greatest Evidence of your Lordships Loyalty and Bravery.
The highest Military and Civil Honours, which require great Application, hinder not your Lordship from excelling in the less Severe Studies, a great Genius will do best upon whatever Employment it fixes it self, witness your Lordships Essay on Poetry, and that admirable Product of your Youth,
the Temple of Death, with several other Miscellany Pieces of your Lordships, which like our great Roscommon's Works, have a particular noble Air, that is not only the Effect of a great Genius, but also of a Genteel and Happy Education, and therefore unimitable by our best Wits, who can only plead the former Qualifi∣cation: Nor is it any Wonder that so great a Master should Patronize others who have excell'd in the same Divine Art, which requires that force of Spirit and fine∣ness of Thought, that are necessary to all, that even in Prose shall do any thing ex∣traordinary, or worthy the Perusal of such Judges as your Lordship; this, Malebranch is allow'd by all to have in his Native Langu∣age, and therefore if he gives your Lordship no Entertainment, the Defect must be in the Translation, not the Original; the very Faults of this great Man have something in them extreamly Beautiful, and the Jewel is so dazling, that the flaws are scarce discern'd. The inscribing these Papers to your Lord∣ships most honorable Patronage, is the occa∣sion of this Address, wherein I have the Ho∣nor to testifie both to your Lordship and the World, with how profound a Deference and Respect, I am,
My LORD,
