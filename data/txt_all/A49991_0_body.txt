SIR,
I Have elaborated, ac∣cording to Your MA∣JESTY's order, the Prepa∣ration

of Sr Walter Raw∣leigh's Great Cordial, with so much circumspection and with such exact and se∣rious meditation on all that enters in the Composition of this precious Remedy, that I thought it my duty to pre∣sent to Your MAJESTY what I have gathered out of

most particular in this my Labour, and to give accor∣dingly the reasons, which prove the great advantages that the modern Phar∣macie carrieth legitimately above the ancient, by reason that it is enlightned with the glorious lights of Chymi∣stry. And indeed, SIR,

that onely is capable to sepa∣rate exactly the pure from the impure, to preserve the virtue of whatsoever it works upon, without any loss of its volatil parts, and to draw out of the very centre of the most fix'd things  Na∣ture hath therein implanted most essential and most spe∣cifick.

Your MAJESTY knoweth so well this diffe∣rence, and reasoneth so just∣ly on all the Productions of Nature and Art▪ that one may say with a real and sin∣cere truth, That You unfold with an incomparable Neat∣ness of Judgment the pro∣foundest Questions of the

Naturalists and Chymists, in the Royal Laborato∣ry, with as much facility as Your MAJESTY un∣tangles in all Your Coun∣sels the Intrigues of the most refined Policy. I shall continue, SIR, to work as I have done with the same zeal and the same activity,

that I may contribute what is of my Art and Study, to effect those Sublime and Royal Intentions which Your MAJESTY hath for the common good of Your Sub∣jects, whom Your Royal Bounty desires should be eased and delivered from their Diseases and Evils.

Wherefore I do present and dedicate to Your MAJES∣TY with humility and all submissive respects the Dis∣course which I have made on this Great Cordial, and humbly beseech Your MAJE∣STY to protect it, since it was brought forth under Your MAJESTY's Shelter

and Command, being now, as I will be all the rest of my life, inviolably,
SIR,
