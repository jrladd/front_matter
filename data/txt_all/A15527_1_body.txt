RIght worshipfull, the maine and chiefe vse to be made of this Booke or Treatise, it is to direct (as by an hand) euery Christian, which of all other things is most carefull of his owne saluation, how to iudge and discerne of him∣selfe, whether hee haue any part in that sauing holy cal∣ling which bringeth to Christ, by such gifts of the Spirit as be peculiar to persons effectually called. The cause is not better knowne by the effect, or a tree by the fruite, then a true calling by the Gospell is manifested by such graces as doe accompany it in all the faithfull, necessari∣ly, but not equally; as the good fruits of a good tree be some bigger, some lesser. And lest any should be de∣ceiued in iudging themselues (for likenesse is the mother of errour, which makes copper & other glittering things to be sometime taken for gold) I haue therefore in the passage of this Booke discouered such things as be like vnto the true workes of grace, and are but the counter∣fets and images of them. Now the same causes which induced mee to dedicate this tract and Christian Dia∣logue

primarily to that most Honorable Christian La∣dy, my Sonnes Benefactor in the Vniuersity Colledge at Oxford, excited and moued me likewise to ioyne you three to her in a secondary Dedication, as hauing tho∣row the grace of Christ obtained like precious faith in your heauenly calling, thorow the blessed Gospell; and being by Gods prouidence stirred vp to be the meanes of my sonnes preferment, both to his place, and in his learning. The first motion to this good exhibition, (which he partly hath to the great ease of my charge, and wholly I trust shall enioy by your fauourable fur∣therance) began at Canterbury by you Madam, and was seconded and holpen forward at Oxford by you, the worthy Master of that Colledge where my sonne is Student; and finally, perfected by that Right Honou∣rable Countesse, Widow to the founder her most Ho∣nourable Husband the Earle of Leycester, long since deceased. Accept I humbly pray you this poore testi∣mony of my thankfull minde (who daily mention you in my prayers, that all sauing blessings may be powred on you, and continued to you) till my sonne through Gods mercy prospering in his studies, may expresse a morefull measure of a gratefull mind vnto you all, to whom he hath beene, and may yet be so much boun∣den; which the Lord of his fauour in his good time en∣able him well to performe. Fare ye well.
From my House in Canterbury, the 10. of Iuly 1620.
