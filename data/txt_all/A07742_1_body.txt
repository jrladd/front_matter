AMong all enormities reigning (in men of reasonable capacitie) none maketh them more deformed then the monster Ingrati∣tude? whose outragious cruelty hath Me∣thomorphosed, friendship into emnity, familiarity, into contempt, Loue into hatred: and generally all good into e∣uill. The remembrance whereof, hath of∣ten stirred my sences to haue your wor∣ship in remembrance, for diuers and many curtesies, from you to my selfe and my friends often receaued: And that in bounty so farre ex∣tended, as my offer of requitall can no way counteruaile. But as migh∣tie Alexander, for tenne talents giuen to the reliefe of a poore craftes man, was thankefully contented with the receipt of a simple roote. So J hartily intreat you, to accept these poore Canzonets, by me collected from diuers excellent Jtalian Authours, for the honest recreation of your selfe and others: Such as in my simple iudgment are worthie the collecting, but much more worthy hauing the Habit of so worthy a pa∣tron, in whose acceptance they shall bee so well entertained, as were their masters present to behold it, they woulde not onely thinke them happely bestowed, but also yeeld me thankes for choise of their patro∣nage. And thus crauing your worthy acceptance, but resting stil your debtor, J take my leaue as yours to commaund.
