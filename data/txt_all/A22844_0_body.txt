AS the want of Lawes occasioneth wrongs to be committed wit∣tingly; And want of knowledge of Lawes carieth men into offences ignorantly: So are Lawes thēselues a burthen when they are too many, and their ve∣ry number is a cause that few are executed: where Penall Lawes haue otherwise no life, but in their execution. And certaine∣ly that Magistrate who knowes but few, and causeth those to be

duely obserued, deserueth better of the Common-wealth, then he that knoweth many, and exe∣cutes but few. Therefore is the Composition of this Volume, that those few Lawes, and other Ordinances being most needfull for the time, may bee easily had, soone knowne, and duely execu∣ted; Which is required by his MAIESTIE.
