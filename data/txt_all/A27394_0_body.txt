HAD this Epistolar Address, and the Publish∣ing of this Sermon it Prefaceth, been Matter of mine own free Choice; I might justly have faln under the Censure of Libelling so great a Judgment as yours. But when You were pleas'd first to summon so young and weak a Minister, as my self, on so solemn an Occasion to the Pulpit; and then to command so poor a Performance, as this of mine, to the Press; I am no farther concern'd, than in two such high Proofs of my Obedience.

 But you, Sir, who have so determin'd this Dedica∣tion upon your Self, are thereby as well oblig'd to the Defence of your own Reputation, how well soever other∣wise establisht; as to the Patronage of this Sermon, now made Publique, against such Variety of Censure as 'tis like enough to meet withal, in this our Censorious Age. As either
First for the Plainness of the Style; tho a plain Dress best become the Natural Beauty of all Truth in general; and more especially such Practical Truth, as is the Sub∣ject Matter of this Discourse. Or
Secondly the Shortness of the Sermon: Not consider∣ing, it was a Word to the Wise; and that a short word to such is sufficient; especially in such Matters, whereabout their Wisdom is not only most principally, but most familiarly also conversant: Otherwise there's scarcely any one Branch of my Text, that would not have supplyed a no very fruitful Invention, with abundant Matter, for a more Copious Discourse than this of mine, upon the whole of it. These two Objections, together with a third, answer'd in the Close of my Sermon, might be made by no ill meaning Friends:
There's yet a fourth to be expected from our worst mean∣ing Enemies; or some Advocates for them, whose Eies directed to, speak their Hearts also set towards their
 Tents, as ready to run over to them: Namely, that I am too severe against Papists, and Popish Priests.
Now to this Objection, which hath least of Reason, and most of Danger in it, I shall not (for that Cause) go a∣bout to make any Defence of mine own; but here more e∣specially pray in your Patronage and Protection, accord∣ing to your Office; his whom you represent, the King's Majestie's, according to his Laws; and above all, the highest Defence of all, even that of God himself, accord∣ing to his all wise and Powerful Providence, against both the Makers of the Objection, and those in whose behalf it is made: and this last Preservation, not for my self alone, but also, and much more, for our King against their va∣rious ways of Assassinations; for our Church against their manifold Idolatries, and Superstitions; and for our State against all their Hellish Plots, and Machina∣tions.
And, as for means conducing to these Ends, I yet far∣ther pray, that the King may want no such Subjects, the Church no such sons, this Country no such Friends, and the whole Kingdom no such Magistrates, as your Learned and Worthy Self: the King no Subjects so truly Loyal, the Church no Sons so truly Obedient; this Country no Friends so every way faithful, and the whole Kingdom no Magistrates so altogether unbiass'd and in∣capable
 of Corruption. Men of the right old English make, and Protestant spirit, Couragious, Ʋndaunted, bravely bearing up against and stemming the tide of all opposition from Rome and France. This is and shall be the Constant tenor in the fervent Prayers of
RIGHT WORSHIPFUL,
