SIR,
YOur HIGHNESS can never rule so equal∣ly in the Empire of
Learning, but that the Poets will pretend to a particularInterest
in Your Protection, as well as in Your Fame: And the Grecian
Masters, who are the first of the Tribe, will reckon themselves in∣jur'd,
unless they have the Honour of paying their Duties before the rest.
In the Late Degeneracy of Ancient Valour, they have had the Hard
Fortune to pass for meer Romancers; because their Worthies and their
Adventures appear be∣yond our present Notions of Human Conduct and Force: But
from Your HIGHNESSE's Actions, they expect a full recovery of Faith and of
Esteem: Theyare impatient for the Time, when they may renew their
old Title to Prophecy; and when the Fame of Your HIGHNESSE's Atchievements
shall justifie the Miracles of their Verse. For Princes SIR, have this
Advantage above us the Vulgar Herd of Scholars; that we read the Story
of Heroick Exploits, barely to understand and to admire them; THEY
to imitate, and to exceed them.
And whilst thus, with a hasty kind of Loyalty, the Good Old
Songsters are coming to wait on Your HIGHNESS, 'tis no wonder if they make
use of any poorGuide to Conduct them: never fearing that with
Your HIGHNESS's Justice, the Worth of the Addressers can suffer by the
meanness of the Introducer;
SIR,
