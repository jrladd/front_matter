FEWE WORDES SONE amended, as reporteth the Prouerbe, inferring thereby that siluer sentence of the Philosopher Zeno (worthie for the excellency of it to be grauen in du∣rable place, with Letters of the most purest Golde) that nature had giuen vs two eares and one mouth, to the en∣tent, that we should heare more than we vtter in wordes, as it is also more agreeable to the way of wisedome, wisely to be silent, then fondly to speake, greater vertue it is, and labour more commendable to learne to suppresse thy tongue, then to seeke the fasset to set abroch the same, for in silence is wise∣dome and prudence, when in talke fooles are knowne. Which thing whilest I did perpend with my selfe (right honorable Ladie) though I had purposed before to practise my pen to the vtterance of suche an homely hoorde as was gathered in my vnskilfull head, and to offer the present thereof vnto your ho∣norable Ladiship, yet these ratling sentences thundring along as it were Gunshot by the souldiours amased eares, so aba∣shed mee, that I was vtterly discouraged to thinke, much lesse yt doe so farre as to present a patterne of my rudenesse vnto





your honor, least in manifesting mine owne weakenesse in words, I should appeere euen such a one as were wholy drow∣ned in the lake of ignoraunce, or washed in the Fountaine of folly, to the ouerthrow of the good vndeserued report that my friendly welwillers doe conceiue. But now (right honorable Ladie) I haue by experience prooued of my selfe being in your daylie presence, the fame of your worthinesse and vertues to be certain true, which eftsones before I had heard reported by others, who in eche respect of vertue may be comparable to the noble Lady Argia the worthie king Adrastus his daughter, who in beautie being inferiour to none: in curtesie, in noble∣nesse, in clemencie, in liberall bountie, in prudence a superior, & in manie courtlike qualities, in more vertuous knowledge, in all godlinesse was equal with thē that surmoūted the chie∣fest: Whereby she was reputed to be, to hir euerlasting fame, of a golden nature: so curteous in words, so friendly in deeds, so comely of countenance, so youthfull in yeres, so auncient in talke that shee was no lesse adorned with these venerable ver∣tuos, than with a number of the rest hir princelike graces and giftes which sweetely sprang in hir, as the flagrant flowers in the delectable month of May. Yea, hir vertues were excel∣lent and especially in hir true and amiable hart, beautified with louing affection to continue in the same towardes▪ hir spouse the noble knight Polynices: as in the bloudy battell of Thebes when the worthie Polynices was most lamen∣tablie slaine, gored to the sore wounded hart, with his brother quelled before his dolefull eyes and an innumerable sort ouer∣throwne, and a generall Edict by cruell Creon was set forth

that vnder paine of death no one should aduēture to bury thē, but leaue them a pray to dogges & rauens. Notwithstanding the cruelty, notwithstanding this dreadfull daunger of com∣maūdement, notwithstanding he had laine so long till the stink was so horrible that he was infectiue, notwithstāding a thou∣sand present perils, yet this most honorable Lady, of only loue, of only hartie affection, only accompanied with hir good sister the Ladie Antigone (who bare lyke loue to hir brother) in the night season shee spared not to go among an innumerable sort of carcasses stincking most lothsomly and ceassed not to tumble them vp & downe with hir fine hands, vntill she had espied hir deare husbands body, whom (although his face with gorie bloud and grauell was pitteously defiled) she disdayned not to kisse and embrace, washing hir face with the teares of hir eies, tooke it vp in hir armes, stole it away, and as farre as hir womanly power could extend, she interred the same, such was the vertue, such was the affection, such was the no∣ble hart of this loyall Lady Argia, whose figure in eche qua∣litie your honor doe liuely represent, no curtesie: no comely countinance, no grace, no gift, no one vertue at all in hir but that they haue alreadie taken roote and doe harbour in your blessed brest. These honorable ornaments (O noble Argia) afterwardes I did plainely perceiue to be abundantly in you▪ the inward feare which before ouerflowed my quailing ad∣uenture, is cleane put to flight. And presuming on so noble a nature, I am now boldened, yea ouerbold humbly to giue these rude phantasies collected vnto your honor, as the worke of a welwiller. Although better it were for me to be silent, than

in speaking to shewe my nakednesse in wisedome. But you are that princely Argia, which will rather accept these toyes of my poore penne, proceeding from the good will of my seruice∣able hart, then the riche present of a froward friendly foe: wherefore I humbly craue (right honorable Ladie, O noble Argia) that you will consider, the hart not the hande, the giuer not the gifte, the trustinesse not the toyes, the meaning not the matter, my minde, not my madnesse, my paine not my penne, whereby I shall be most bounde daylie to lift my prayers to the protectour of all, that you with that right honorable Lord, the Lord Talbot your husbande, may most prosperously treade the trace of this painefull pilgri∣mage, to your hartes desire, to the encrease of your honors, & perpetuall main∣tenance of that right hono∣rable and Noble name.
