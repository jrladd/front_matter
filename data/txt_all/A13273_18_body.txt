NOT that yor Highnes needs My mean Direction
(Hauing, within, a Princely spirit for Guide;
Without, your Parent; round about (beside)
Precepts & Patterns of diuine Perfection)
esume I Thus to bring (in dim Reflexion)
This forain LAMP (admired far & wide):
But, as An humble Gift This New-Years-Tide,
To intimate my Faith, and my Affection.
r gracious hand Thus binds my gratefull heart
To Offer Heavn my Vowes, & You my Verse,
For that Deliuerance You haue daignd, in part,
ny poore Hopes, wrackt in your Brothers Herse.
You haue begun; Vouchsafe me, Sacred Powers,
You may go-on, & make Me wholely Yours
