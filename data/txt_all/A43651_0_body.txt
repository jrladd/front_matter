Right Honourable,
IN Obedience to your Desire, I have Published this Dis∣course, which I Preached before you on your late Anni∣versary Solemnity; and if it may contribute to the fur∣ther Satisfaction of any who are already Loyal, or the Con∣viction, and Reformation of such as are not truly so, I shall be thankful to God for Blessing so mean a Performance with such happy success. The Subject, I am sure, is suitable to the
Occasion upon which it was Preach'd, and very necessary for the Times; but yet I fore-see it will displease some Men, whose Displeasure indeed I do not value, because their Favour is not to be obtained by any Minister of the Church of England, who will not be false to his own Profession, and utterly decline the Preaching upon these Doctrines, and Duties, which I have here plainly Taught. But you have not so Learned Christ, as appears by the Entertainment, which this unpolished Sermon hath found among you, meerly for the Truths sake. Your Approbation will be Protection sufficient both to it and the Author, who Presents it unto you with all due Observance, wishing a daily increase of such Obedient and Dutiful Subjects to His Majesty, as you are, to whose firm and active Loyalty, next unto God's and our Governours Vigilant Care and Provi∣dence, we owe our present Order, and Peace. I am,
Right Honourable,
