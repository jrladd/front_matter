SIR,
I Beg you will give me leave
to express my gratitude in
some measure, for the favours
I have receiv'd of you, and to make
an acknowledgment where I cannot
pay a debt. 'Tis only what was long
since design'd you, when possibly it
might have found something a better
wellcome, by its having made (as
then it must  done) a voyage to
have kist your hands, and might
perhaps then have contributed in

some small degree to  diversion,
in a place where there is found so
little—In order to it I sent you the
first part by one of your Officers, of
which this is a continuation. But
being oblig'd to lay it by for other
more material business, it has had the
misfortune not to approach you till
now, and to which honour it has no∣thing
to intitle it, but that of bearing
your Name before it, which will put
a value upon it to the World. And
since I never was of a nature to
hord any good to my peculiar use,
'tis with great satisfaction I am, by
this short character of you, distributing
a blessing to that part of Mankind
who have not that of knowing you.
For there is an unspeakable pow'r and
pleasure in obliging, and 'tis a pain
to the good ntur'd to conceal any
thing, whose communication may
gratify the world, and I am uneasie
wen a good man is not as well

understood by every body as by myself,
and I boast that honour here, with
more vanity than of any other hap∣pyness.
Tho I know, I shall be
censur'd by your lovers for saying
so littl where so much is due:
But since I write to the number
that do not know you▪ rather than
those that do, this will at least suf∣fice
to shew how fine a thing man
can be, so qualify'd and set out by
nature for eternal esteem. For, Sir,
there is in you something, besides
the common vertues of your Sex, so
ingaging, some Art in Nature so
peculiar to your self, so insinuating
into the soul, that there is not
found any thing so dull in Human∣kind
as not to love Honour and value
you: Nor is that man born that is
your Enemy, no not even amongst
those Phanatical dispositions, whose
principles and opinions are so distant
from those Honest and Generous

ones of yours; at least they love the
Man tho they raile at his notions,
esteem the person tho they abomi∣nate
the loallist; nor can I reflect on
the excellency of your temper, but
I think you born to put the ill na∣tur'd
world in to good Humour. You
are all ways easie without affectation,
merry without extravigance, gene∣rous,
liberal, and good without va∣nity,
sedate and even without con∣straint,
cheerful and calme as inno∣cence,
tho the World storm and
reel with mad confusion, still from
the serenity of your looks we read
the fair weather in your mind, which
times or seasons can never discompose,
while all goes well with your King
and Country. You have a greatness
of Soul which it seemes as if fate
durst not oppress, and he who is so
truly magnificent within, needs
not trouble the World for elbow
room, and who is abitions of more

than you possess, does but purchase
an empty name at the expence of his
repose and sense, and lessens his
Glory by equalling it to a Title
The Sun at noon is no wonder, but
to see as great an Illumination in a
Star tho of the first magnitude, we
gaze at with admiration. Title
(that trifle which you can command
when you please, and which 'tis far
greater to merit than to war,)
serves rather to render vice more
apparent than to elivate the vertues.
eavn has made you more truly
happy, and has set no blessing at
too vast a distance for your reach;
but has subdued even all your wishes
to your pow'r, and left you almost
nothing to ask: having suted your
fame and fortune to the greatness
of your mind
How soon at the choice of the most
glorious Senate, that ever blest the
Land, was your vallu'd name snatch'd

by every glad and giving voice,
and made the Musick of the happy
day, when black exclusioners were
justly damn'd from the field, and
only such untainted Supporters of
the Royal cause, thought worthy to
bear apart in so glorious a Concerne,
as Giving Caesar his due! Here,
Sir, you appear'd in your proper
sphere dispersing that darling vertue
of your Soul, lavishly giving, ge∣nerously
disposing and dealing out
according to your mighty mind, and
had the glory even of obliging a Mo∣narch,
than which nothing could be
a greater satisfaction to you. But,
Sir, you do all things with a perfect
good grace, and even business, that
toyle of Life, you render soft and
easie, and as if you alone were creat∣ed
to manage the concernes of the
World▪ you make business your pleasure
and diversion, and laugh at those
that fatgue them selves with mighty

affairs, and who assume like Trincilo,
a dull Gravity, to be esteem'd gret,
wise, and busie, while you discover
only the best and noblest part of
business, the effects of it, the rest,
the Gentleman so handsomly conceals,
we perceive it no more than Fairy
Huswifry, which is still acted in the
shades and silence of the night, when
Mortals are a sleep, and who find
all fair and clean in the morning,
but cannot guess at the invisible hand
that did it. I am so good a subject
that I wish all his Majesties work
done by such hands, heads and heart,
so effectual and so faithful, and
than we shall fear no more Rebelli∣ons,
but every man shall bask secu∣rely
under his own Vine, that has
one▪—For my part I have only escap'd
fleaing by the Rebels to starve
more securely in my own native Pro∣vince
of Petry, tho I am as well
pleas'd at our late Victory, and

the Growing Glories of my King, as
he that has got a Commission by
it, if I may have this happyness
added to it, of still retaining the
Honour of your friendship, and
e still number'd in the Crowd of
SIR,
