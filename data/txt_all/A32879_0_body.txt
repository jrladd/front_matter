Madam,
YOƲR long and intimate Acquaintance with Reverend Mr. Newcome of Blessed Me∣mory, the Relation in which he stood to you, and the High Esteem which he always found with you, together with your many Generous Expressi∣ons of Kindness to his Person and Family, give you an undoubted Title to this Memorial of him. I am very sensible that what I have here done, or am able at any time to do, can neither be Wor∣thy of his Name and Memory, nor merit your Ladiships Acceptance. But, your Candour, Ma∣dam, is equal to your Great Judgment; and there∣fore I despair not of your Pardon where I am liable to Censure, nor can I doubt your Favour∣able Reception and Patronage to what is any way capable of Approbation. I know your Prudence and Humility would dispose you to an extream Resentment, should I dilate upon those many Vir∣tuous and Honourable Endowments, which ren∣der
 you a most Conspicuous Ornament of your Sex and Quality. Therefore, instead of displaying your Ladiships Exemplary Goodness, which is al∣ready so Ʋniversally acknowledged, I shall pray that it may have a most diffusive and powerful Influence upon others; may it convince them how vain the Attempt is of arriving at true Greatness, unless they first become truly Pious and Religious. And may it please the God of all Grace, to Sanctifie all his Dispensations to you, and to enrich you more and more with all Wisdom, Grace and Felicity, that after a con∣stant Perseverance in his Blessed Fear, you may be joyfully translated to his Everlasting Kingdom and Glory. So Prays
