SIRS,
WHEN I take a View of the Wonderfulness of Gods Providence in bringing me first among you, together with those Bonds of Love, by which I am held so fast, that it is my quoti∣dian and daily study, how I may be further capacitated to serve you, and the Church of my Lord Iesus; Verily, I must confess, you are the People that have all my thoughts: And besides this, you are those who have the greatest interest in my Prayers; Others have some of my heart, but next to God you have all my heart, I have heard much of the love of a Minister to his People, as that I could scarce give credit unto

it; but I do now believe it, because Ex∣perience has taught me so, though that by which I am obliged unto you is not the same as with a Minister and his People, it being only a sincere Love be∣gotten by my frequent, painful and la∣borious Preaching unto you, without any further charge, and yet notwith∣standing how do I love you, and pray for your happiness in this World, and the World to come; I can't endure to think of your damnation, no, not any of you. I am sick at the heart (many times) through fear, lest I should rise up in judgement against some of you, because there are those amongst you, that seem to takeiittle notice of God, Christ, and their immortal souls, though through grace all of you are not molested with the Contagion of this Distem∣per, which is so Epidemical, not on∣ly in foreign Places, but likewise in our English Island, as that it doth ma∣ny times occasion Floods of Tears to run down from the eyes of Gods precious Servants, who, as so many

Lots, do bewail the iniquities of this Land. Sirs, I have thought good to reach you with my Pen, when my Tongue cannot; and hence it is, that I dedicate this unto you in part, though it is possible I could have found out many others, whose Names I might affix in the Frontispiece of this Book, only my Love is most endeared to you; and wherefore do you think it is, that I should concern my self so much with you; would you know, take then these few Reasons.
First, because God made me not al∣together for my self, but for you and others; we were not made for our selves, and therefore we act most like beasts, when we only minde our selves, and not others, who are our Kinsfolk, according to Creation; but when that goodness that is in us is so diffu∣sive, as that it leads us forth to suc∣cour those who srand in need of our help, then we act as our selves, and like rational creatures, it is God that created me, and why did he create me, but that I should serve him, and in what



better way can I do it, then in the first place to seek my own salvation, and after that, the salvation of you and others. But,
Secondly, the End of my Creation is not all by which I am induced to concern my self thus with you, but likewise the End of my Redemption requires me so to do; I, you, and all of us were no sooner created, but we fell from God; and through Adhe∣rence to the Devil, lost that glorious Image which he had invested us with, and thereby forfeited the favour of God, and so became the Children of Wrath; but now Iesus Christ, that immaculate and spotless Lamb of God, who knew no sin, became sin for us, by assuming the humane nature, and taking upon him the guilt of all our transgressions, Isa. 53.6. How then can I, you, or any of us, be slothful in Gods service, when he hath done so much for all of us as he hath done; May we not say as Bernard did con∣cerning Christ,Dilexisti me Do∣mine ma∣gis quam ipsum. Thou hast loved me, Oh Lord, more then thy self! And

now the End wherefore Christ did all this was, that we might be restored to Gods Image again, and to serve him in all manner of holiness; And in no better way can I do this, then in look∣ing after my own soul and the souls of others.
Thirdly, the End of my Redempti∣on doth not only require me thus to concern my self with you, but likewise the End of my Sanctification.
I am sanctified (as I hope) and am washed with the water of Regene∣ration. Now it is the duty of those who are sanctified, to lead other in the way to Sanctification and obedience of the Spirit; This our Saviour lays down as a Rule to Peter, That when he was converted,Luke 22.32. he should strengthen his Brethren. But
Fourthly, the very End of my Mi∣nistry requires me to have a diligent care of your souls; 'Tis a duty of us who are Preachers of the Gospel, to pity and look after poor souls that are in their blood; and God, yea, An∣gels and my own Conscience do bear

me witness how I pity your souls, and that I could go hundreds of Miles barefoot o do any of you good, though never so mean in life and descent; I was devoted from the Womb to the Ministry; and now when I come forth unto it, shall I not in any wise answer the end thereof, the Lord for∣bid.
Fifthly and lastly, not onely the End of my Creation, Redemption, Sanctification and Ministry; but like∣wise the end of my Preservation doth thus oblige me to you: Hath God done for me what he hath done, and shall I not to the utmost do what I can for him; Hath he wrought such deliverances for me, and shall I be slack and negligent in his service, far be it from me, and all those who have experienced the like that I have; And hath he more∣over kept me hitherto, and must I not seek his glory; to such perverse walk∣ing the Lord put an end: Many o∣ther Obligations there are, by which

I am bound to look after you; (viz.) I am a dying Creature, and therefore whilst I have life I must act for God, because when I am in the Grave I cannot write unto you, My Preach∣ing-Work then will be over; And hnce it is, that I do think it meet, whilst I am in this earthly Ta∣bernacle, to put you in mind of these things, and to stirr you up to the doing thereof; And as the consi∣deration of my Mortality should move me to do what I can for God; and you see likewise the consideration of yours should make you more willing to hear and re∣ceive,Post mor∣tem nulla Paeniten∣tia. what I and others do both Preach and write unto you.
And now, Sirs, what remains, but that you would follow those Pra∣ctical things,Christi re∣verese Tri∣bunal. which the good Spirit of God may by these Lines put you in minde of; Consider, you must one day render an Account for all the good Sermons that you have heard; the Word will either prove a

savour of life, or of death; you will either be the better for Sermons, or the worse, and therefore to you now I speak, that have often heard the voci∣feration of the Gospel, but are not as yet reformed; Consider, af∣ter Death comes Iudgment,Scio Domie Iesu quod districtus ar∣biter mnium ven∣urus clandestina hominum facta & verba cogitta in lucem proferes. Grhard de extre∣mo judicio. and then what will you do, will you not wish that you had taken the good Counsel of God given by his Mini∣sters, will you not then re∣member these Sermons which once you, forgot as soon as ever you went out out of the Church, and will not the remembrance thereof be as a Worm gnawing of your Con∣sciences in Hell,
Oh with what shame and confusion will ye then be cloathed, when all those secret sins, which you thought were impossible to be brought to light, shall be made manifest before the Lord Ie∣sus, who is () light it self. Moreover, consider that without you have an Advocate, thee is no standing

at this Tribunal, and who is this Ad∣vocate, but Iesus Christ will plead to the utmost for you, if you can but make sure of him, for without him nothing can be done, in order to your being sheltred from that wrath of God, which then shall be revealed on all those who have slighted this Advocate, and have accounted Sermons of no worth, further believe and consider, that if you have not the Lord Iesus to stand as your friend, you must be thrust down into Hell, and there howl with the damned for ever: And what think you now of these things, do you stedfastly be∣lieve them; if you do not, search the Scriptures, and there you will finde what I have said to be true; if you do believe them, why then do some of you live, as if there were neither God, Heaven, Hell or Iudgement; if these things are sincerely believed by you, stir up then, and lay hold upon God, and claim of him deliverance from wrath to come, for it is hastning apace, and w unto you if you lay up nothing

against this burning wrath of God for the time to come, is as sure as the time that is present, why there∣fore are you all for the present time, assure your selves, that the walking in repulse against these Considerati∣ons, and the sweet motions of the Spi∣rit will make you smart one day. But
Finally, if you will all observe these things to do them, what a blessed Meeting shall we have, how wide will the Gates of Heaven stand open for u? what a Welcom will God the Father give us, the very thoughts of it doth glad my very heart and soul; Suffer there∣fore the good Word of God to take Impression upon you; Endeavor to live a life of Grace here, that so you may live a Life of Glory here∣after; Persevere in all good, hold out to the end, for the Crown will make amends for all: Be constant in the use of means; Follow Peace with all men, be useful in your se∣veral

Vocations, that in all things u may be fit for the being received  into the Heaven of Heavens; hich is and ever shall be the desire d Prayer of him,
Who is, SIRS,
