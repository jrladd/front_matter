My Hopes and my Fears,
THE first Adam's sin came in∣to You thro' my Loins. O may the second Adam's grace come into you, thro' my means. My God and the God of my Father's grant it! To Him have I Dedicated you: And for Him would I Educate you.
I am Called unto much work for Others: It's little that I can do distinct∣ly for You. Be it your Care to make Yours, what is done for many Others. Thus publickly I command you to read
this Call, as wrote singly for your selves. 'Tis possible some other Pa∣rents may from so mean an example, Charge their Children. And this my Paper may speak unto you, when I am gone from you.
You know they are many, who think my Days on Earth will be few. And that You must Die Young, or Live Or∣phans. However that be order'd by God, hasten ye to make sure your Peace with Him. Up and be doing, O precious Souls, and dear as mine own!
The God of my own Mercies, Com∣forts and Hopes be with you! Amen.
