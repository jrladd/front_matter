MY most honourable Lord, the late departure of our L. P. Clement the 8. hath administred vnto me a sub∣iect and opportunity during the va∣cancie, to search out more particularly all points about the election of Popes, and the formes of proceeding therein, as well ancient as moderne, iudgeing it a very inconuenient matter, that we should be so addicted to the investigation of the least strange antiquities, as some doe, employing their whole studie here∣in, and to be ignorant of that which occurreth in our owne times, and in other things which touch and more neerely concerne vs. I made therefore a little memoratiue, with intent one∣ly that it should haue been for mine owne par∣ticular vse, that vpon any default of my me∣mory heereafter, I might haue had recourse to the same: But my dutie, (for the honour you vouchsafe me, in being inquisitiue after my studies, & hauing a care of the same) obliging me to giue you aduise herein, you did not on∣ly desire to see it, as you haue alwaies an incre∣dible affection to vnderstand, and be acquain∣ted with al honest and commendable maters,

with a spirit and courage which surmounteth your yeares: but further hauing seen the same, you thought it expedient, that it should bee published and imprinted: It being not alto∣gether impertinent to my relations of Rome, which before I presented to you, reduced as they saiy, within the length of a little foote; according to the proportion of my age of four∣teene yeares. It shall bee therefore you, my good Lord, to whome they that reade this Treatise, and take any contentment therein, must giue thanks; euen as on the contrary, they that out of a prowd humor, disdaine and con∣temne whatsoeuer is not done by themselues, shall haue somthing to say against you, and not against me, that doth but onely obey and ob∣serue your will and pleasure, as I ought to doe; hauing no other reference heerein, but to de∣monstrate by all meanes possible, that I am,
My Lord,
