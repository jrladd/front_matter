MY LORD,
YOur Lordship is not ig∣norant of my late severe Dispensation, how I lay un∣der
 the fury and triumphs of a Chronical Distemper, by which I was brought to the brink of the Grave, and the confines of the House of dark∣ness and silence, and every Toll of our Bell was a seem∣ing Proclamation to the neigh∣bourhood of my Translation to another State: but Almigh∣ty God was pleased to vouch∣safe kindness (as sometime to Epaphroditus) by a strange and almost miraculous Recovery. Hereupon I resolved, to do some∣thing by way of Gratitude, to the Glory of my Preserver, who kept my Soul in life and suf∣fered not my feet to be moved.

Now seeing, my Lord, we have the best and most ex∣cellent Religion, and are en∣gaged in a Profession every way both amiable and advan∣tageous; yet (such is the loos∣ness and sensuality of the Times) that many either A∣theistically deny the Funda∣mentals of Christianity, or suffer themselves to be drawn away and removed from the Hope of the Gospel, by sen∣sual Allurements and gross Delusions. I concluded there∣fore (considering the Scepti∣cism and Apostasie of this Age) I could not do a piece of more acceptable Service to
 the Lord Jesus, than to per∣swade those who have solemnly engaged themselves in this holy Religion, to observe their pri∣mitive Vows and Obligations, and maintain the Doctrine of Faith once delivered to the Saints.
When the Levite in the Book of Judges saw his Concu∣bine abused to death, he cut her in pieces, and sent her amongst the Tribes of Israel: so seeing the af∣fronts & defamations passed up∣on Religion, & the cunning con∣trivances of Atheists, Romanists, and Enthusiasts, either to make us wholly renounce our espou∣sed Evangelical Verities, or else
 to imbibe impure Doctrines, Streams of Abanah and Pharpar Rivers of Damascus; I thought it necessary to send these Papers abroad to vindicate the Divine Majesty, to excite men to a holy Perseverance, and to im∣portune them by the most for∣cing Motives, not to forsake our Church, and the Doctrines taught by her; which, provided men joyn practice to profession, will infallibly lead them to a glorious Eternity, and the En∣joyment of that Beatifical Vi∣sion, which is the expectation of the Saints. And by the Rules of Justice your Lordship may challenge a Title to this
 Dedication; first from that re∣lation I stand in to your Ho∣nour, seeing you have ranked me (though unworthy) in the number of your Chaplains, as also from the consideration of those signal and transcendent Favours conferred upon me; which great Obligation, seeing my Meanness cannot discharge, I hope your Candour and Ingenuity will accept the com∣mon Interest of a thankful Acknowledgement and Com∣memoration. Besides this is none of the least Motives of this my obsequious Address, that what I heartily desire of others is happily fulfilled in
 your Lordship, viz. a firm Adhesion to the Church of England, and her Doctrines, grounded upon Divine Re∣velation; and I request your Lordship to give me lieve to acquaint the World, how rare an Example and Monument of Christian Stedfastness you have been. 'Tis well known you have visited remote Re∣gions, you have seen the Mag∣nificence of the Roman Church, the Glories of the Triple Crown, &c. yet you have re∣tained your first received Prin∣ciples, and not deserted our Communion: therefore I make no question but God has ho∣noured
 your Lordship with additions of earthly Grandeur even here, made you a Star of the first Magnitude, and the Glory of our Northern Cli∣mate. May your Lordship still proceed to be a lively Mirrour of Constancy, Vir∣tue and Sobriety to this wa∣vering and impure Generati∣on, and may others by the conductive Rayes of so No∣ble a Guide and Pattern, be directed into the straight paths of a holy and laudable Con∣versation.
I have no more but to bow my knees to the Fa∣ther
 of Lights, that he would bless your Lordship with all manner of Blessings in Jesus Christ; that his Can∣dle may shine upon you, and his Dew lie upon your Branches; that your Peace may be as the River, and your Glory as the mighty Streams; and after a long and prosperous abode in this Sublunary Region, you may be received into rhe Glori∣ous Number, and Blessed Company of Overcoming Saints, who shall sit down in the Kingdom of Hea∣ven with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; And this shall
 be the continued Prayer and fervent Option of
(MY LORD)

Jan. 28. 1675/6.
