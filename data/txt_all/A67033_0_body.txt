SIR,
SCire meum nihil est, nisi me scire hoc sciat alter, saith the Poet, and I most justly in order to Your Majesty, whose satis∣faction is my happiness, and whom to serve is my onely aime, placing
 therein my Summum bonum in this world: Be therefore pleased to cast Your gracious Eye over this Summary Col∣lection, and then to pick and choose. I con∣fess, I made it but for the superficial satisfa∣ction of a friends curio∣sity, according as it is set downe; and if it might now serve to give aime to Your Majesty
 how to make use of my poor Endeavours, it would crowne my thoughts, who am nei∣ther covetous nor am∣bitious, but of deser∣ving Your Majesties favour upon my own cost and charges; yet, according to the old English Proverb, It is a poor Dog not worth whistleing af∣ter. Let but Your Ma∣jesty
 approve, and I will effectually perform to the height of my Ʋndertaking: Vouch∣safe but to command, and with my Life and Fortune I shall chear∣fully obey, and maugre envy, ignorance and malice, ever appear
