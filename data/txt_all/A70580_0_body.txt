SIR,
WHen this Chronicle of France thus confidently intrudes under Your Royal Highnesses Roof, it arrogates no other Pretence for so bold an Approach, but that they are Crown∣ed Heads that make it; And there it is, that these Royal Strangers, the Kings of France, may find the Hospitality of an English Court, and by gaining an Access to a Goodness and Greatness so equally Illustrious, obtain not only Your favourable Reception, but also Your Royal Protection. The History of their Reigns is a noble Subject, and the Compiler of it, so Judicious an Author, that if the Ingenious are believed,  may be Ranked amongst the most Eminent Historians. Were I Master of such a Pen, I might adventure to mention Your Royal Highnesses just Praise, a Theam too lofty for my groveling Quill, though perhaps it were but a needless Task, since the lowd Cannon has Pro∣claimed Your Valour sufficiently on the Sea, as Your Prudent Administration of the Government

in Scotland hath evidenced Your Excellent Conduct at Land, while Your more familiar Vertues are at∣tested by all that ever had the Honour to Reside within the Verge of the Court, or have been placed in the Sunshine of Your Favour, the smallest Ray whereof would satisfie my greatest Ambition: But having no Title to such a Blessing in the least, I may wish, but cannot hope ever to attain it. Wherefore I shall only beg Your Royal Highnesses Pardon for this Zealous Presumption, and descend to my own Place, contented to be owned at Your Feet,
