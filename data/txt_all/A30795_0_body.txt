My LORDS,
REason could not direct me to a better way to let your Lordships understand the whole of my case, then by presenting you with the full charge my adversaries have published against me, with such answer to it as truth and my own innocence prompted me to make. Here your Honours will finde all the criminations which their inventions could superadd to the proofs brought against us, and my refutation of them, which are both subjected to your Lordships judgement.
That this Narrative which I have exposed to publick view is Byam's own; I can onely bring these Arguments for: when I came to Barbadoes (which was long after the departure of my fellow-Proscripts from Suri∣nam) Byam, not doubting their arrival, gave onely short accounts to his friends there of those rancounters amongst us, referring them to this Narra∣tive sent formerly: But they, miscarried by their leaky vessel, came not to that Island till I was departed thence, and then this Declaration be∣came first publick there. Among divers copies, one of them was sent to my Vncle (well interessed in Surinam) with a letter from Byam aggrava∣ting my particular fact: He sent both to me, and I, as faithfully as I could transcribe them, have sent both into the world. I can, I believe, finde some here who having seen and read them before they came to my hands, dare so far rely on their memories as to aver these to be the very same.
Here now, my Lords, you have both the parties pleading before your Honours: in the contest, the disadvantage of the weapons is observable; They, having afflicted us with the greatest injuries, have nothing to doe but to be dirt us with any imputation which may render us criminal enough for the punishments we have suffered: We are forced to bring Proofs of our Innocence against their no-proofs of our guilt, or else muct fall under
 and aspersions: as though it were argument enough of our cri at we have so highly suffered.
Certainly it is a hard task to prove negatives, but surely a much hard∣er case that suffering Innocence must be put to it, while he that hath vio∣lated her is credited on his bare assertion: yet this is our task and our case, and how I have performed it, and acquitted my self and friends of their defamations your Lordships alone can judge.
This I shall chiefly urge, our enemies do here confesse that they have de∣spoiled us of reputation and liberty by an infamous imprisonment, of goods, by heavy fines, of houses, lands, and of countrey by banishment, and all this by an usurpt power, and an arbitrary tyrannical way of proceedings, by the force of an army, destroying the Birth-right of the subject. If they must have credit given to all their criminations against us, I hope they will not he permitted to traverse what they have confessed of themselves: If then, to subvert the sacred fundamental Sanctions of our Nation, to tread under foot the laws established for the preservation of persons and proprieties, to usurp Dominion, that branch of Regality, to congregate an armed force without warrant, and therewith to invade the Rights of their fellow-sub∣jects, be crimes of a mid-night-hew, I hope they may be as well understood when they charge themselves with all this, as when they accuse us of what is lesse evident. Since also the Honour, Libertie, and Estates of the subjests are in the protection of the King and his laws, why should not these persons be accountable to them, how rightly they have deprived us of all these?
But they think to justifie their proceedings against us by the names of a General Assembly and the united Authority of the Countrey, when it is known that the General Assembly, though duly Authorized, neither there nor in Barbadoes, was ever a Court of Judicature, especially in criminal cases, such being always tried by the Governour, assisted by all the Justi∣ces, at the General Sessions of the Peace, where the fact is presented by a Grand Inquest, and after found done or not done by a Jury of the neigh∣bourhood. And this is according to Magna Charta, and to this way of pro∣ceedings the Authority of Surinam were bound by their own Act, besides the General fundamental Constitution.
Yet should we grant that it were customary in those Colonies to try of∣fences by the General Assembly, contrary to the great Charter, it would not excuse a company of men who seiz to themselves the Power and Name of a General Assembly, and vote all those that deny their Authority, guil∣ty of what crimes they please, sparing or punishing them according to the Rule of their wills. What they call sedition in us, they confesse to be onely a disputing their power, and an Act of Parliament cannot authorize any to be Judges in their own cause.

My Lords, as we cannot loose our Allegiance by changing or soil or hea∣ven, so neither can we loose the Royal Protection. And that subject that hazards life, and fortunes to enlarge his Majesties Dominions, the reve∣nues of his crown, and traffick of the Nation, deserves not to be disenfran∣chised.
I should not importune your Lordships with a repeated clamour of my case, did I groan under a supportable sufferance: but wholly to loose an estate purchased by a large expence of money, time and travel: to be re∣duced from a plentiful way of being to the nearest confines of Beggery; from the dignity of store, to the contempts of want; to be deprived of that fruition, which when it was in hope onely did sweeten the toil of its ac∣quist; and what is the sum of all, to see a wife and children, dear and de∣serving, panting under this whole burthen; is so superlative a punishment, that I cannot believe all they would make me guilty of can deserve it: Death, though murther, had been a mercy to this.
And this, my Lords, without Hyperbole or aggravation, is truly my condition: whatever I brought into that Colony, and whatever improve∣ment of that my industry had made (which was sufficiently considerable) is so wholly gone, that not the least Remains thereof are left; lands I have there, but such as lie waste, and, without money to restock them, must for ever lye so; and though my enemies malice go not so far as to forfeit them, their heavy impositions will devour them.
They have so weakened me (such was their cruel policy) that I can scarce call for Justice: by the Grandeur of their oppression they have made the most probable purchase of their own impunity; and their example will in∣struct those that shall hear after meditate wrong, to doe it fully; unlesse de∣terred by the impartial scrutiny, your Lordships shall make into these acti∣ons; and your laying or leaving the punishment where you finde the guilt: which unfeignedly is the hearty prayer of
My Lords,
