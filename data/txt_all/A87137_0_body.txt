I Dedicate my Book to the Mirth and Discourse of the Ʋniversity Wits or good Companies, upon condition that they laugh not alwaies in the wrong place; for if a Man who can tell what he would have be ridicu∣lous, what are such as would have they know not what?
Policy is an Art, Art is the Observation or Imitation of Nature, Nature is the Provi∣dence of God in the Government of the world, whence he that proceeds according unto Prin∣ciples acknowledgeth Government unto God, and he that proceeds in defiance of Princi∣ples, attributes Government unto Chance, which denying the true God, or introducing a false One, is the highest point of Atheisme or Superstition.

Nullum numen abest, si sit Prudentia; sed te
Nos facimus, Fortuna, Deam, Coelo{que} locamus.

I neither do nor ever did refuse Obedience unto any Government, I never was nor am of any party, I go not about as some that would impose their own impertinence or absurdities upon me, endeavour to insinuate to settle a Commonwealth an't please you, which belongs not to me, but I undertake, as any man may do, to vindicate the reason of Popular government. In which Controversie let him that will buckle with me, I will give him a fall or he shall give me one, nor care I whether, because who ever get the fall, the good Companies and the good people too of this Nation will get arise in that knowledge, which if we be not like them that dwell upon the Cataracts of Nylus, among all this noice we have bad and are like to have of Axes and Hammers, is the most seasonable and necessary. But the University Wits or good Companies, are good at two Things, at diminishing a Com∣monwealth and at Multiplying a Louse.
