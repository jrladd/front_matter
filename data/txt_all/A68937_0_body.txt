WHen Time had brought this Embrion to the light,
It wept, it cryde, and oft it deeply sight;
I ask'd my Muse the cause; Shee made no other
Reply, then this, Shee's like the Muse, her mother;
I ask'd her name; Shee said, Melpomin√©,
I ask'd a Patrone, and shee named Thee.
To Thee, the Darling of my child-bed Muse,
I here preferre those long deuoted dues,
I owe to Honor; with a truer heart
None e're presented, though with greater Art:
My Muse, perswades me, though her Infant cry,
You'll pardon't, when you reade the reason, why.
