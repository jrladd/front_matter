MY LORDS,
AS it is certainly my bounden duty to offer, and submit these my timorous and bashful endeavors to your great Judgments; so it is my Interest to implore the benignity of your auspicious Patronage of them. For the publishing these Papers, I had onely two Motives: The first and principal to erect a small Monument of that vast respect and deference, which I have for your Lordships, who are not onely the Oracles of our Law, and Grand Exemplars of Justice; but the glory and ornament of that Honorable Society, whereof (however unworthy) I boast my self a Member, and which at present justly claims the preheminence above the rest, by producing more persons, dignified with the Judiciary scarlet Robe, then the other Three, and filling up, by due merit, the most eminent Seats of Judicature in the Nation. The other, to gratifie an ambitious inclination of my own, of leaving behinde me somewhat (how inconsiderable soever)

that may, in some measure, excuse me to posterity, from having been a truantly and useless Member of that Learnâˆ£ed and Active Body. If your Honors shall allow me, to have fulfil'd my duty in the one, and obtained my design in the other, I have the desired effect of my Labors: Nor hath my greatest ambition any thing higher to aym at, then that I may, with your Lordships permission, subscribe my self
My Lords,  Inner Temple, 20 June. 1670.
