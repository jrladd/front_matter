SIR,
MY simple disposition could neuer make
cunning obseruance of any, whose de∣serts
most bound me to their respect and
honor; not more out of my Nature,
then Iudgement; since commonly the worlds ob∣sequious
Insinuations in Trifles, proue their ob∣sequies
of no more Importance. Nor can the
weightiest duties, in my poore habilities, sway much
more the Ballance of the World; because the
notice that the world takes of mens noble Loues



to Vertue, and good Name, impresseth nothing
the more, but oftentimes their lese price in onely
profit and selfe-louing estimations. Notwithstan∣ding,
since I know your true Noblesse, out of the
common way, in all honored Inclination to the
acceptance, and grace of Goodnes; I haue beene
bold to publish this Poem (intending allurement to
Goodnes, by deterring from her contrarie) to your
right generous countenance, and gracefull protecti∣on:
Wherein, least a single and consortlese disposi∣tion
might perhaps grow cold, by the too many
companions that encourage the death of it to all
respect of vnprofitable Vertue; You haue taken
into your Boome so free and gratious a loue to
it in my most honor'd Lady; that the comforta∣ble
and nourishing flame of it, can neuer want fuell
to maintaine and keep it euer at full. To both whose
one-light, for the direction, and progression of
all good Endeauors, belonging and consecrate
to all true Worthines and Dignitie; I offer this
well-meaning Materiall; hoping that such as haue
no matter to Iudge it, shall bee farre from encli∣ning
your Apprehensions to condemne it: And



rather establish, then diminish in you Vertues
encreasing encouragement. To which, in all re∣solu'd
seruice, I humbly submit; euer abiding,
and desiring to my vtmost, your most respected
commandement.
