DIsdaine not Sir, this offering which I make,
Although the incense smoke doth towre so black;
Northink my fires faint, cause they darkly shine,
Tapers burne dimme, are set before a shrine.
Some better hap to haue their first fruite glad,
This Common woe maskes mine in mourning shade:
Ana's strange, You (solely left for our reliefe)
For salue, doe prooue a cor'siue to our griefe:
Weigh what it is to adde to those opprest,
Then by Your woe, ours shall not be increast:
I grant nor Sonne, nor Subiect good, can smother
Griefe, for so great, and good, a Queen & Mother.
Yet moderate this sorrow, as you reseene
to vse in Joy, so vse in griefe a meane,
Ore match thy matchlesse selfe, that all may see
Her courage, worth and loue, doth liue in Thee.
Then may this pen, which with teares drawes my aint,
In gold Thy glorious actions after paint.
