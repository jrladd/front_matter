BY your fauours, I
had some place a∣mongst
you, be∣fore:
but now I
am an Aduentu∣rer;
if not to VIRGINIA, yet
for VIRGINIA; for, euery
man, that Prints, Aduentures.
for the Preaching of this Ser∣mon,
I was but vnder your In∣uitation;
my Time was mine
owne, and my Medtations mine
owne: and I had beene excusable
towards you, if I had turnd that

Time, and those Meditations,
to GOD's seruice, in any other
place. But for the Printing of
this Sermon, I am not onely vnder
your Inuitation, but vnder your
Commandement; for, after it
was preach'd, it was not mine, but
yours,: And therefore, if I gaue
it at first, I doe but restore it
now. The first was an act of Loue;
this, of Iustice; both which Ver∣tues,
Almighty God euermore
promoue, and exalt in all your
proceedings. Amen.
