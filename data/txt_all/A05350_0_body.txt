RIGHT HONOVRABLE;
INeyther as valewing your great∣nesse or abilitie, present this before your Honour; but your goodnesse and vertue: not that I thinke the subject unfit your consideration, but because I am iealous of the compiler. Yet my presumption is not great; for what I now doe, is obedience, yea but seconding in action, what your Honour thought worthy to be effected. Discourses of this nature have not many Patrons: and to see great men busie both their senses with Divinitie, is mirum in terris. Yet the Church hath had a Sergius Paulus, a prudent Deputy, and a Publius also, from whom our Apostle might re∣ceive incouragement: and we have not lost, but changed our late learned King, that mixed his meales with di∣vine
thoughts, and taught his Nobles the like wisedome: and herein I know not whether we can judge him more happy in his Princely power, or Priestly prudence. That path that honoured him a King, may crowne you a sub∣ject. Neyther doe I provoke you by the father, as if there were nothing imitable in the sonne; for who doth not see freshly budding in his sacred person, what his Fa∣ther presented to us in full eare? And your glory will be no lesse in imitating his graces, then in presenting his person.
This (whatsoever it is) I place at your Lordships feet, if it please you, as well published as presented, I have my desire: but if it fayle herein, I shall not want to rejoyce that it once gave content. God adde to your dayes, ho∣nours and graces, and make you a true professor of his di∣stressed Church in this kingdome; as also that your Lordship may long remaine with us a firme columne for the upholding the peace and tranquilitie of this State. For which, (with the rest of your true Ho∣norers) I shall ever pray.
