E Experience of your Courtesie imboldeneth me to write,
L Long might you lie in loyall loue, vnto your faithful make,
I I craue of Ioue for to vphold your dayes still in delight,
S Sending his blessing on each thing, yt which in hand you take
A Aduancing vertue, inamouse vice you euer did forsake:
B Bearing a zeale to sober mindes, well giuen, voyd of ill,
E Extolling good and godly workes to them you haue respect:
T The modest Matrons you frequent which scorne at wanton Will,
H Hauty hearts & pompiouse pride you always did reiect.


R Regarding much the vertuouse chase of Diana & her Dames,
E Expelling wilde & wanton workes, which vauÌ„t of Venus hue:
Y Yelding no whit vnto the blaze of Cupids flashing flames,
N Nting such matters as you finde by tryall to vs true,
O Omitting not to do each thing in time and season due,
W Wisely waying what doth want, and it for to renew,
L Lending reliefe, in time of need, to those that want the same
S Sure due desert doth well deserue to haue immortall fame.
No fauour to fortune.
