GREAT SIR,
THe Royal State and Magnifi∣cence with which Your Majesty hath inter'd the Duke of Albemarle, hath established a lasting Monu∣ment of Glory to Your Self, and put a new Obligation of Loyalty upon all your Sub∣jects; After all your Maje∣sties Royal Bounties to him
 while he lived, and since he died, his poor Servants hum∣bly crave leave to bring their Teares, and contribute what they may to the Glory of his Memory; It may offend your Enemies, it cannot Your Ma∣jesty, to whom he was an hum∣ble as well as faithful Ser∣vant.

 greatest Enemies, are such to them for their Loyalty and Obedience. I do therefore in all Humility, Implore your Majesties Favour and Pro∣tection to them all, and to my Self, who am the unworthi∣est of their number; humbly craving Pardon for the pre∣sumption of this Address of
