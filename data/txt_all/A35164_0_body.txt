Divine things be∣come Generous & Noble Spirits, who being the more refi∣ned Images of God, above the Vulgar, have by their noble descent à larger Capacity to great Matters, & by their most carefull Education, à cleerer Apt∣ness to sublime thoughts & actions.
Your Honour hath by the Ex∣cellent Conduct of your Life, givē the world so ample à proofe of your Eminent Perfections, befit∣ting the Greatness of your Name, that None may reflect thereon, but must admire, both the fortunate
disposition of your originall Incli∣nations to piety, & the free bles∣sings of a Gracious Providence, re∣ligiously managed by your own Vertuous care & Industry.
For besides the Rare guifts of Nature & Fortune, which welco∣med you into this Light, wherein few of our Nation exceed your Ex∣celling Happiness. Your Honours laborious discovery of truth in our Holy Church, from which your first yeeres & growing Honour were extremely averse; & your zealous Love towards comforta∣ble Solitude, & complyance with Christian Duties, since your being engrafted on the sacred stock of our ever-flourishing Christianity, wherein You are become Imitable by few of your Noble Birth & Qua∣lities, discovers that swift penetra∣tion of your Judgment, that solid∣ness
of Vertue in your heart, which truly speak you Noble & Reli∣gious.
Although this small handfull of advises & helps to solitary Perfecti∣on, gleaned up by many yeeres se∣rious Meditation, in sweet Retire∣ment, may already find a plenteous harvest in your own bosom, yet will I presume through your Ho∣nours Encouragement, to lay thē at the feet of your Excellent Vertues, that under the protection of your Honours Favorable acceptance, & strengthned by the greatness of your Name & perfections, My Phi∣lothea may become conspicuous to he world, & doe that great work a∣broad, which is therein designed, by
MADAM
