Right Honourable, &c.
FOR these thirty yeares past, it hath been observed, That those in publique Place or Trust have plotted and contrived little, but how to enrich themselves; Whether you look upon Protestant, or Puritane: Most, if not all of both, laying about them like mad, untill they could say with Dives; Soule, thou hast enough laid up for many years; eat, drinke, and take thy rest!
In all which time, and with the generality of such per∣sons, the publique good hath been no further cared for, then the Egyptians did; That they have their Tale of Brick or Taxes: Being not ignorant, that the hard labour in Brick-making, with the want of Straw, had made the Isra∣elites cry, and not without feare that that cry was come up to Heaven.
Lest that after a getting over the Red-Sea, with the de∣struction of very many of these Task-masters, these Two Nations should make Indentures in the Wildernesse for forty years, before they get to Canaan, and only Caleb and Joshua get thither: Knowing that miracles are ceased, this Essay is published for Advance of Trade; having ready another of excellent use for enriching by Land, as this by Sea; which, if this have encouragement, shall follow: Thereby to helpe You all either a neerer way to the Land of Promise, so much prayed for, and so dear bought; Or to

enable You to beare the difficulties and miseries You are like to suffer in the journy. You shall do well to fall close to the businesse, and set on work what is here laid down: You have old Laws enough to beare you out; and certain∣ly none will hinder your gathering Straw, who will exact and need your Tale of Bricks, if they put you not upon bringing in more: And for your encouragement, Who∣soever shall agree in the City of London, or any other part of this Nation, or that of Ireland, to set the busines on foot; A way shall clearly be laid down for the Income of Ten per Cent. possibly Twenty, Thirty, or more, which will bal∣lance the experience, and so underselling of others; and no more hazard of Principal or Profit, then is in putting Mony to Use upon good Security. This Edge (it's confest) must have an Additional Law. By this, you will do that really in way of help to the Poor, that hundreds of thou∣sands loynes will blesse you, All will be bettered, and you had in everlasting honour. Which is all eyed by him, who desires no longer to breathe, then he shall be ready to shew himself
