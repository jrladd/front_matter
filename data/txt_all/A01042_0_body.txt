OF this DIALOGVE, (MADAME) writ∣ten, now, thirteene Yeares a-goe, no more was, at that tyme, intended, but a few Ma∣nuscripts, for satisfying some Godlie Myndes, and obviating the insolencie of some ignorant, and ydle Humours; foolishlie glorying of nothing: Yet, even so, was it bolde, then, to betake it selfe to the sha∣dow of Your most Honourable NAME, though it never had yet the Cowrage, to present it selfe, to a Kisse of Your Hands: and, perhaps, had lyen buried in this its Shamefastnesse, for ever, if, vpon the renewed impudent Importunitie, of the same sort of Men, at the instant desyre of some well-affected Christians, it did not now come out, to a more publicke view of the World.
In which case, if it should eyther neglect, or disclayme, so Noble (an Ones acclaymed) Patrocinie; al-be-it there-by could bee no imparement to Your Honour, (to whose great worth manie such Dedications can adde no lustre:) yet, were it some Disgrace, to the Treatise it selfe, and, discredite, al-so, to the Author there∣of; who yet liveth no lesse affected, than ever, to serue Your Ladiship in the LORD.
Receiue, then, that which is Your owne; as a poore, but an vp∣right Token, how farre the Author, and all of his Calling, account them-selues obliedged, to giue Your Honour, all Hearte∣ning, and Encowragement, for cleaving, so constantlie, (agaynst ma∣nyfolde assaultes and temptations) to that Trueth, which, heere∣in, is defended.
The GOD of all Trueth, still more and more, stablish, streng∣then, and confirme You there-in: blesse Your most Honourable Lord, and You, with all Happinesse, heere; and, bring You both, in ende, to Eternall Blessednesse, with HIM-SELFE, in the Heavens.
