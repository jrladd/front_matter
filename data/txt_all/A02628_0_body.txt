HE that hath passed a dangerous sicknesse, and hath recouered his former health againe, is bound in a double Obligation: The one is to bee gratefull to the Person by whose meanes he recouered his health: The other is to vse all meanes possible, that those which be sick of the like disease, may by his recouery be the better: Ac∣cording to that of our Sauior, Et tu cōuersus confirma fratres tuos: And therefore right Honourable, although it be somewhat besides custome to make Dedications of printed Sermons; yet it is my duty to offer to your Honour the first fruits of my con∣uersion: Your Honor being next and immediately vnder God the chiefe worker thereof. The which as it is a gretaer benefite then any worldly thing can afford me, so doth it require a fuller acknowledgement then as yet, I could at any time manifest: howsoeuer I haue most earnestly desiredit. In which respect be∣ing ouer intreated by some of my friends to publish this Sermon of my Recantation, and to set downe to the open view of all, the
iust reasons, and sollid grounds that moued mee there unto. I haue made hold to passe it vnder your Honours name, hoping by your former encouragements, of your loning acceplance. And albeit they be but my first Assayes in this kind, and therefore may chance to seem: but harsh, yet because my desire is only to set forth God; mercy towards me: your Honors louing kindnesse shewed to me, And to stop the mouthes of some malicious Papists that rayle against me, I trust that your Honour will accept of this my weake endeauour as a token of my thankefull mind, which I in all duty recommend vnto your Honours fauour, and your selfe and yours, in your affaires vnto the mercy, and blisse of the blessed Trinity, who ever so asssist your Honour in all your proceedings, as that after these present toyles and troubles, your Honor may receine that happy Crowne of glory, Quam repro∣miscit Deus diligentibus se.
