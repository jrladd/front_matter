Right Honourable,
THe unfained zeale I beare to the publick, hath emboldned your daily Orator to compile this indigested fragment, though I know it will not suit with the affections of some in these our times: yet it is not inten∣ded to distast any: I wish it may safely arrive to the view of some candid and iudicious Auditour, whose know∣ing vertues may be a covering to my imperfections: the serious consideration whereof hath moved mee, though the most unworthy to present your Honours with my worthlesse Labours: And the rather, when according to my duty I deeply pondered the sad di∣stempers, and dangerous maladies now in the bowels of my deare Countrey: I held my selfe the rather obliged to imploy that talent which I have received from divine Providence, partly to satisfie my owne conscience, in what becomes a faithfull subiect, for the welfare of his distracted Countrey, and for the fu∣ture encouragement of al, who are in necessary places of honour in our Armies abroad; and those who are
under their commands, to the end they may the more couragiously fight under the banner of truth: and tru∣ly Right Honourable, my humble Request is, that you will cast your eyes on it. Vuitu serent, that so your Honours may rightly understand you must not expect here filed Phrases, or oyled terms, but field lan∣guage: For I never was a Court-flatterer, nor Time∣server: but what I have here presented to the world, is only to shew what unnecessary Officers in an Army, though allowed by a State or Kingdome, prove dis∣advantagious to the same.
Wherefore if you daigne to cast an eye on this my reformed Army, although it be not so exactly pro∣portiontble, as you perhaps expect: yet here you shal find that it is possible to fight an Army consisting of never so many Brigades of Cavelrie and Infantrie, without those Officers whom here I have excluded: but thought I it would be taken ill for my boldnesse in discovering plain truth, I should bury my thoughts in silence, and stifle my poore Babe in its concepti∣on, rather then it should be borne a son of discontent: But Right Honourable, its your favours only that I crave, which if I may be so happy to attaine, I shal be doubly obliged, as in all duty ever to remaine,
