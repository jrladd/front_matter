SIR,
YOu was pleased to command me out to an Honoura∣ble but hard Worke, which though slenderly per∣formed by me) yet hath been kindly accepted by you, and earnestly desired by others to be made publique: and I am the rather induced to do it, that I might give unto the world a testimony and acknowledgement of that esteem and gratitude, which I owe you for your abundant and un∣deserved Respects to me.
I confesse, you ran a very great hazard, when you made choice of me for such a service: and I might at once both have something lessened your Credit, and quite lost mine owne; which perhaps was the expectation of some, who (though they differed in other things) agreed in this: but whether they were disappointed of their expectation or no, your Worshipp is able to give the fullest account and an∣swer. I have formerly upon the intreaty, and advice of freinds, exposed a Sermon of two unto common censure, and if any will be at the pains to compare them with this, they shall find no contradiction, which made me the more willing to adventure this.

And now that it is put out, if it were worth the owning, there is none hath more right to it than your Selfe. I desire no more, and I hope you will grant no lesse than this, that as this Sermon had your Command for its production, so it may have have your Patronage for its preservation. I know it is usuall to fill Epistles Dedicatorie with the praises of the Person, unto whom the Dedication is di∣rected; but his Majesty hath so much honoured you in preferring you to such a place of Trust & Credit in your Country, and you have so farre honoured your Selfe in the discharge of it, beyond the expectation of your years, that I need say nothing. I will rather turne my Commen∣dation into Counsell, that you would studie so to improve your time, your Abilities, and your experience (ever having before you for your patterne, the Sobrietie and reservednesse of your honoured Father) that you may still deserve the Royall Favour, be more fit to do God & your Country service, and live long (I do not say to be envied) but if envied, for nothing else, but deserved Honour and Happinesse. So prayes
SIR,
