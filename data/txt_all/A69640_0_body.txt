My Lord,
I Should in the first place (if possible) anticipate your wonder; when these rude Lines shall plainly salute You, Defender and Protector of their Innocencie: Since I, who have thus preposterously run them, am not so happy as to be known to Your Honour. I shall therefore humbly take leave to de∣clare the grounds of this my presumption (for I dare not call it otherwise, unlesse by your permission). The first is, your unbounded Goodnesse; to which I am relatively obliged, and much acquainted by the frequent commemorations of my nearest Relation, whose Father had the happiness to live and die under the benevolent influence of Your honou∣rable Service; And, by the Information of those whose expressions pro∣ceed from the dictates of their own Experience, find, That where You have once obliged any by Your incomparable benignity, Your favours flowed down infinitely to all Relations. The next is, The Worthiness of those Learned Authours, by whose Care and Industry these Examples were left for the use of future Ages: whose Ashes might justly rise up against me, if (being so unworthy to mention, much less to collect their Labours my self) I should not commend them to the Patronage of one most Noble and Ingenious: Nor do I conceive it the lightest consideration, That Your Lordship being acquainted with these Collections in their severall Originals, must necessarily (for the communicative quality inherent in all truly noble and generous dispositions) wish they were accommodated to the apprehensions of inferiour capacities.
I shall not trouble Your Honour with what Motives I had for expo∣sing this Work to publick View; Since these so much Saducean and So∣cinian Times, most loudly, proclaim an eminent necessity of utmost endea∣vours in this particular: And since it is the duty of all men, to study rather the Publick, than their own private, advantage.
It being a Stranger, needs the more Encouragement. Besides, being usher'd into this our English World by so unworthy a hand, must con∣sequently participate of the weakness of my endeavours: But however defective, or exposed to injury, Your acceptance will abundantly supply it, and your Patronage secure it from the imputation or prejudice of any Momus.
Should I further question that invincible Courtesie which I hear every where extoll'd, I might thereby aggravate, instead of extenuating, my Presumption. Therefore I shall cease to trouble you further, but with this one request, That You will favourably interpret my boldness in sub∣scribing my self,
My Lord,
