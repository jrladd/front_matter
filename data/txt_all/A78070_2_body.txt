My deer Sisters,
AMongst the Catalogue of Gods great mercies to me, I account it not the least, to be of the number of that sweet and precious society and Family, and to see how the Lord hath mul∣tiplied his mercies towards us, as not onely to make us one Body, but also one Spirit, giving us the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, whereby we have fellowshp with the Lord, and one with ano∣ther
 in the Spirit, praying, rejoyc∣ing, conversing, walking, and liv∣ing together continually; this ne∣ver dyes, neither can it be parted; its such a threefold cord, that no∣thing can break it; such a fellow∣ship, nothing can divide it; and such a joy, and life, none can take from us. I have, through the love and goodness of the Lord to me, drawn some spiritual Discoveries upon a part of the Scriptures, as God gave me opportunity: Onely, my dear Sisters, let me desire this from you, What you finde herein of God, glorifie him for it, and what is not of God, as you appre∣hend, judg it not after the flesh, but judg righteous judgment; and withal remember the weakness of him that was but a poor instru∣ment
 in it: And if it may by the blessing of God give any light to you, God speaking the same things in a vail to it in your spirits, how will it rejoyce mine. Thus leaving all to the good guide of the Spirit of Truth in all things, I take leave, and remain,
