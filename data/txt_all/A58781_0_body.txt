My Noble Lords,
AS your Lordships concern in East-Jersey, makes it appear to all intelligent persons, that it is a Nationall interest to advance in generall the design of a Plantation, hence to A∣merica; so that in particular, East-Jersey
 is the most proper place; seeing your Lordships have chosen it among all the other parts of that continent, to settle your interest there; Yet my Lords, there are (to our shame) a parcell of people, who whether out of Ignorance or Malice, I cannot well determine, decry the design; I believe they have a share of both, and thereby weakens not a little the hands of a number of well meaning people, who would gladly promot the same effect∣ualy, were they not imposed upon by the false rumours, industriously spread abroad to stiffle any such inclinations.
I have been advised to consent to the publishing of the following sheets, at first collected, only for my own divertise∣ment, and more clear information in the affair; As what may tend some what to prevent any foolish misrepresentation when by the perusall of the accompts, from thence the least jealousie is removed of any cheat in the thing it self, so ad∣vantagious a Character of the place com∣ing from so many different hands.
I have had too many demonstrations, of your Lordships favour, to fear your displeasure upon accompt of my presum∣ing
 to send the same abroad under your Patrociny; yea, I dare further adventure, without the least apprehension of your dissatisfaction with me upon that head, to mind your Lordships that as you have laid the foundation of this design, as to any concern of this Countrey, in that place; so it is expected your Lordships will continue to encourage the same: in process of time your Lordships may render your Names and Families as con∣siderable in America as they are in Europ.
My Lords, having resolved to dedi∣cate my self, Family, and Fortune, to the promoting of this design; I should the more easily digest any frauns of Providence I have been trysted with; were I so fortunat as to find the opportunity, in Jersey of testifying my resentments of the favours I have received at your Lordships hands in Scotland, by notice∣ing any of your Lordships concerns there, and contributing what in me lyes to ad∣vance the same; nothing shall be want∣ing in me to testifie how much I am,
My Noble Lords,
