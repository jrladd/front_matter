A Small part of this Subject,
many years since had drop'd
from my pen: But looking
at some opportunities upon
the Argument, I thought some things
more considerable might be deduced;
and applying my self further, at times
of recess, I felt it grow and multiply un∣der
my imagination: Nor left I it then

with the most serious truth, I
know not any, that love me so little,
whom the payment of my so mean ad∣dresses
would satisfie, as to clear me up∣on
the account of his friendship. Let
this suffice at present from him, that is
