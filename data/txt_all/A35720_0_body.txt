May it please you:
THis little Trea∣tise (some may say) needs no Dedication, Res enim ipsa lqui∣tur: The subject and matter of this Discourse pointing like the Heliotrope to the Sun, unto the High and Illustrious As∣sembly of PARLIAMENT, whose influence and favour are alone sufficient; yet since it hath pleased God to raise you up in this distressed King∣dome,
 as blessed meanes an instruments of his glory, and of the good of this Common-Wealth (as it is certainely hoped) in composing these unhappy differences, by your eminent Wisedome and su∣preame Authority, and your fidelity and constancy in this great trust committed unto you, being so apparent unto all men; as also this worke for the most part being extra∣cted out of your owne lear∣ned Declarations, and Remon∣strances imparted to publike view. I am upon these rea∣sons emboldned to addresse my selfe unto you for pro∣tection against Calumny and detraction. And although I know nothing herein contai∣ned but what is warranted by the Lawes of this Realme,
 and by the rules of truth, yet in as much as I am not here∣by justified, I crave your fa∣vourable censure, concluding what I have written of your judicious view wholly unwor∣thy, and the Author hereof in respect of your noble and high deserts shall ever remaine,
