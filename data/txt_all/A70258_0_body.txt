MY LORD,
I Approach your Lordship with
the same hardiness as they who
satisfie themselves, that the
sincerity of the Giver may attone for
the little value of the gift; having
learnt this presumption from Histo∣ry,
where I find that great Princes
have look'd kindly upon mean obla∣tions,
and thereby rendred the ge∣nerosity
of their acceptance more il∣lustrious,
by the duty and obedience
of the Presenters.
Nor with this trick of moral sto∣ry
would I be thought to wind your
Lordship into the reception of a
trifle, but that I carry a braver de∣sign
in it; that is, on this occasion

to make a publick acknowledgment
of the many and great favours (and
of one especially above the rest, the o∣verflow
of your nobleness) which you
have been pleas'd to confer upon your
unworthy servant. For (my Lord)
the sense of them hitherto, bounded
within the narrow knowledge of my
meanness, hath seem'd to me a kind
of guilty concealment, and almost
tantamount to a denyal of them, till
I was able to render this happy and
open declaration to the world, of an
humble and obsequious gratitude for
those favours done me; and so done,
that your generous affability in dis∣spensing
them may for ever condemn
the rough custom of the age, whose
haughty state in doing kindnesses,
does most commonly turn their
bread into stone.

And though I know, that thanks
alone is no payment sterling; yet
since to the greatest Beings for the
greatest and most lasting benefits we
can scarce make any better return.
I hope it will not seem strange, if I
present your Lordship the memory of
your own goodness to pay your self.
For where the obligation exceeds
possibility of requital, the sawsiness
of attempting to satisfie, is infinitely
worse than the humble acknowledg∣ment
of still owing.
My Lord, I offer to your view a
piece, that dare not stand the test of
your Judgment, but would humbly
shelter near your goodness, & which
(when your Lordship takes breath
from your other more weighty both
publick and private affairs) may

serve to entertain you in the less
serious part of the day; The matter
is least mine, the form & composure
I may own a whole share in; so the
Bulloin of the Indies (if the allusion
be not presumptuous) becomes the
Kings coin, after it has receiv'd his
stamp & image. And as after view∣ing
the scatter'd pleasures of a large
and fair Garden, some satisfaction
is receiv'd from the contracted scent
and beauty of a posie; so if I have
here at all justified the compa∣rison,
whatever error may have past
in the choice or ordering of the flow∣ers,
I hope your Lordship will pardon
to
My Lord,
