SIR:
GRati est cui multum debes, ei plurimum velle de∣bere: All that know me, know that I owe you much more then my selfe: And God the searcher of the heart, is priuie to my gratefull acknowledgement thereof.
I dare not expresse your kindnesse, nor your name: for I am well acquainted how pleasing it is to you to doe well, and vnpleasing to heare thereof: hauing learn't with Seneca: That, Qui dedit beneficium, taceat; narret qui accepit.
The knowledge of the ill successe of hiding Talents in the Earth, and your especiall desire to read, as∣well as to heare; haue moved me to suffer this Ser∣mon to be printed. The good therein is Gods, and his grace working in me: The perfection is his, the
 imperfection mine owne: For wee haue this trea∣sure in earthen vessells.
My chiefe intention was to please God, and to ayme at his glory: But I know not how, an affection of humane affectation hath interserted it selfe: As that man thinking to satisfie nature with food, vn∣awares offendeth in gluttony. Per expositionem patefeci dona; per confessionem detego vulnera: In my Sermon I layd open what Christians are to practise; and in this confession what in me they are to pardon. God giue a blessing to mine indeauours, and a pardon to mine infirmities, and multiply his grace vpon you, and yours in this world; that when these temporary meanes faile, you may bee receiued into the euerlasting habitation.
