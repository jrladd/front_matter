My Lord,
WE every day behold the Lawyers
and Physicians, the Philosophers,
the Historians, the Poets, and all
Professors of useful Arts, pre∣senting
their several Performances to your
Lordship, not only as a Judg, but as their
Common Patron: Why then may not those of
our Order presume to approach your Lordship
with their respective Offerings, and hope for a
kind and favourable Reception? Especially see∣ing
you have let the World know by sundry il∣lustrious
Instances what regard you bear to
that Function, and those of that Character.
They all admire your capacious and universal
Genius, which has given you a profound insight
into Theological Studies, as well as all others,
Westminster-Hall has now another Hale, that is,
one who is a Divine, a Lawyer, and Philosopher,
and skill'd in every Science. Your Lordship e∣very
day atchieves great and brave things, and
with a Spirit that is such. You oblige the Good,
and win upon the Bad, and please all Men by

the Methods of an unstain'd Integrity. Which
brings to my thoughts that Observation of my
Lord Coke, that he never knew any Excellent Iu∣dicious
Lawyer, but was a faithful honest man.
[Pref. to the 2d Part of Reports.]
But lest this should look too much like Pane∣gyrick
(which I know is offensive to your Lord∣ship's
Modesty) and lest I should obscure and
tarnish the Splendour of your Lordship's Ver∣tues and Excellencies by an imperfect represent∣ing
of them, I will here check my self, and
add no more on this Theme, which is so invit∣ing
and charming. Permit me only to lay
these Papers at your Lordship's Feet, and hum∣bly
to beg of your Lordship that you would
be pleased to exercise that Equity and Favour,
to which your present Province and High Of∣fice
prompt you: and then I shall not wholly
despair of your Lordship's Acceptance of this
poor Oblation, and of your suffering me to have the Honour to profess my self,
My Lord,
