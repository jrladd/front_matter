Right Honorable, With the rest of the Gentlemen:
I Hope this is the Year of Jubilee, or Joy to the Poor, and all Gods peopl, and that by your helps and assistance, concurring toge∣ther, such a work of Reformation will bee set on foot, and caried on for the good of the Poor, as well for their souls, as their bodies, as was never so exactly performed in former ages in our Nation.
The work of the Poor consists in two things, viz.

Comfort, the honest helples Poor.
Reform, the obstinate ungodly Poor.

And for your ground and Authority to cary you on in the performance of this good work, you hav

1 The Law and Command of our God.
2 The Laws of our Land, and the assistance of Parlia∣ment if you need

1 The Law of God saith, He that will not work, let him not eat: This would be a sore scourge, and smart whip for idle persons, if Gods Law were so executed, that none should be suffered to eat, till they had wrought for it (if they were able) this would torment such persons (both back and belly) more then ten lashes a day, and such a restraint from victuall, would in time drive them to works whether they would or no, tho never so stubborn; for if such

should be made to fast that will not work, one or two dayes, before they eat, they will be glad to fall to his or her labour the third day; for hunger will tame the wildest Colt, and constrain him to come to hand for hey or straw.
2 The Laws of the Land saith, He that is idle, and may work, and will not, let such be sent to the house of Correction, and there be imployed, and restrained from a begging idle life.
There are other good Laws made against incorrigible Rogues, which I will omit to speak of, desiring those that would know more of them to search the Statutes of England, which are very good in suppressing the idle, and re∣lieving the needy, onely if one thing might be added:
That no lusty person should have the benefit of a Passe if he lived abov thirty miles from London; the reason why I speak of the distance of thirty miles, it is because the Cariers come two or three times a week, and a letter from the Corpora∣tion to the Parish, and the said Carier that dwells nearest to the Parish to cary it; and the Porter that is servant to the Carier, to cary the said letter to the Parish where the Begger saith he was born, or last dwelled, and he to deli∣ver it to the Constable or Collectors for the poor, and they without delay upon a penalty to return answer by the first or second return of the Carier, and their hands with the hands either of a Justice or Minister of the Parish, of the truth, whether ever any such person were born there, or inhabited amongst them; by this means you will soon discover much falshood amongst beggers, and much care∣lessenes among Constables, in not guiding home the beg∣gers to their Parish, a penalty on them will make them bee carefull; therefore if the Corporation do intend to do the work truly, faithfully, and with advantage to the Com∣monwealth, they must neither take the word of a wandring begger, nor the true service of a careles Constable, for they are both ill members to a well-governed Common∣wealth, and will deceive; therefore two letters from the Corporation to the Parish where the Begger saith he was born, or last abode will be very necessary, viz. one to know the truth whether ever any such person belonged to them,

by this means you shall have a true account whether the Beggers report be true: The other letter is when the Beg∣ger is sent away with the Passe, to know whether he be come to his Parish, if not, you shall be sure then to know what Constable was in the fault, that the Begger was not conducted to his Parish, such Constables being fined, will make others beware, this will be little charge to the Cor∣poration, and your work done very judiciously with care & prudence; for some Beggers may commit some misdemeanor in their Country; therefore it is a simple thing to take their word, for they will never tell truth; As for example,
Suppose a Constable of London should take up a Begger in his Precinct or Parish, & should ask him where he was born or last dwelt, the Begger should say, at York, or Newcastle, when as peradventure he was neither born, nor inhabited in any of the foresaid Cities, and it may be he was never in that Country in all his life, yet upon the bare word of the Begger the Constable makes his Passe, corrects him, and sends him away to the place of his birth, or last abode, as he saith, and when he comes thither, the inhabitants there will own no such person, and so he must be brought back again to the great trouble of the Country, according to this I will give you a president.
A Gentleman who is now one of the Corporation be∣ing Constable, a lusty Begger was begging in his Parish, he asked him where he was born, he said at Dover, he cau∣sed the Beadle to whip him, and made him his Passe, and sent him for Dover, when he came thither, the Inhabitants of Dover would not receive him, they had none such born there, they sent him back again to London from whence he was sent; when the Constable saw him, he admired that the Laws were so defect; and he was sory the Country was so much troubled, by carying, and re-carying to no purpose; then he asked the Begger where he did ever dwell, he said at Bristol, the Constable sent him away for that place, and what became of him afterwards he could not tell.
Herein we find it is a trouble to a Commonwealth, that a Constable hav no more proof concerning a wandering Rogues birth or abode, but onely his bare word, which

may lye if he please, as well as tell truth.
Consider in the next place how a careles' Constable may prove an ill instrument to the Commonwealth; for if a lusty Begger passe through the hands of many Constables safe as he is carying along the Country; yet if at last he fall into the hands of a careles Constable he can make his escape and go into another part of our Nation, and continue still a trouble and a danger to the Commonwealth, for some of them are very desperate and envious; if a Farmer give not them an alms to their own mind, or a crosse-word, they care no more to set his Barn and Ricks of corn on fire, then to light a pipe of Tobacco, so desperate many of them are to do a mischief by day or by night; wherefore in my ap∣prehension ther's no better way to guide Beggers to their homes then by way of the Carier, for some Cariers hav been complained of for bringing boyes and girles, and leave them at London upon the charge of this City.
I conceive a Carier or Wagoner are the fittest men to convey Beggers, that dwell about 30 miles from London, for Trunk; provided the Parish pay the Carier for his paines, and if the Carier or Wagoner do not perform their care for the good of the Commonwealth, let a penalty be laid up∣on on them, by this means, the Constable will be freed, and the Country eased of such persons that are a pest and trouble to our Nation.
And if in case a lusty vagrant should say he was born a hundred miles or more, not then to have a Passe, but rather be kept to work either in the house of Correction, or in the Gallies, or clensing of streets, I mean little narrow places where carts seldome come, with such like imployment, till such time they can be sent to the English Plantations, un∣lesse such can procure good security to live orderly.
I have no more to say, but beseech the Lord that your Lordship, with the rest of the Corporation, may be tender fathers to the honest poor, and severe to the obstinate, knowing, as I said before, you have the Law of God, and our Nation to strengthen your hands, and the power of Parliament to countenance you. For which shal be the daily prayer of him, who is Your humble servant, S.H.
