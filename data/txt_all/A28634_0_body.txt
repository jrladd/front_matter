MY LORD,
YOƲR Lordship ha∣ving sometime cast your eye upon the Originall of this Treatise, seemed to ratifie the credit it had received in the World by the honor of your Approbati∣on:

Ʋpon the intimation whereof, I have (out of my especiall Obligations to your Lordship) pretermitted my more peculiar Studies for the Translation of this Peece Not that it could thereby re∣ceive the better acceptanc with your Lordship (where there is so much Language, a other accomplishments of ho∣nor) but in respect of the thing it self (a Mysterie of Philo∣sophy) lest it should out-grow the better knowledge, as i hath the common Presse.
My Lord, These considera∣tions have chiefly induced the imployment of my best Ende∣vours in the performance of this VVork, especially the assu∣rance of your Lordships Pro∣tection; under which confi∣dence I have made it Pub∣lick, as the least acknowledge∣ment of my duty to your Lord∣ship, or respects to the Generall Good: Which if it may receive the favour of your Lordships Countenance, I shall not doubt its preferment, and therein the advancement of the Mag∣neticall Mysterie.
I confesse, Subjects of this nature are not so usually quali∣fied with that honor here as in forain parts, under the pro∣tection of Great Personages; yet is it not for want of Presi∣dent, but rather of Reason, for
Nobilis est solus, Virtute insignis, & Arte:
which is more then demonstra∣tive in your Lordship: where∣fore the Dedication of this Treatise, being Exemplified by the Author to severall per∣sons of honour (and those the most Eminent) I may hope your Lordship (as inferiour to

none) will vouchsafe me the priviledge to pursue my Ori∣ginall: So may the defects of the Body be supplyed in the Countenance, while your Lops. favour shall Patronize both, by a dispensation or ac∣ceptance of these my Ende∣vors, to the future Encourage∣ment of,
My Lord,
