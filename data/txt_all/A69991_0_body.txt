MADAM,
THis Discourse, how unpolish'd soever its Dress is, presumes to prostrate it self at your Ladiship's feet, begging your kind Acceptance and Sanctuary, upon this Recommenda∣tion, that to this Address, 'twas not the vanity of gracing the Title Page by prefixing so great a Name to it, which moved me, but my deep Veneration of your Worth, and the Sence of my Gratitude for the more than ordinary share your Honourable Family have ever vouchsafed me in their Favour.
I am conscious, that the vast Disproportion the meanness of this Performance carries to the transcendent Majesty of its no∣ble Theme, can no other way be secur'd from blame and censure, then under the protection of so great a Patroness: a Patroness, whose Greatness consists not in meer Cumulation of swelling Ti∣tles, or glittering Outside, but in personal Dignity and real Goodness; the Description whereof should I essay to draw, the Draught would fall so far below the Excellence of so high, so compleat an Original, as by the very attempt I should incur the same Guilt, I stand self-arraigned for, in the subsequent Pre∣sumption, I mean that of sullying the illustrious Characters of those Divine Accomplishments, which an Apelles's Pencil, the most skilful Artist cannot sufficiently delineate or represent; and may therefore more prudently be passed by in silent Admiration and Esteem.
Let it herein suffice, and that with great truth, to say, if a Commutation could have been accepted for this Royal Death, your Ladyship would with the First have expressed your Loyal Affection in the Oblation of the Substitute, as evidently appears by that ample Proportion of Grief which your self voluntarily bears on this mournful Occasion. And would the World but

prove so just and grateful to our common Benefactrix, as your Ladiship does, in writing after so fair a Copy; her late Majesty's Memory on that stock might grow immortal, and (what is the general Ambition of Mankind) reflect as fragrant odor on the Dead, as on the Living, and those that are yet unborn.
Such an excellent Person indeed had merited an Apotheosis among the Ancient or Modern Romans: had she died in their Communion, they would have enrolled her Name in the Registers of their Polytheism, preserved her Sacred Reliques for Divine Homage and Adoration: Altars had been erected and Sacrifice offer'd to Her. But that Work of Supererogation is too much, as well as bare Remembrance is too little: there is a safe Me∣dium between these Extremes, and that is Thankfulness to God for, and Imitation of her matchless Piety and Vertue: This is all the Honour, and the highest Respect, either she is capable of receiving, or we of paying to her Merits; which Debt is so religiously discharged by your Ladiship's ingenuous De∣portment; to whose genuine Candor I humbly submit these Pa∣pers, to over-look those Faults, which are too palpable to bear the examination of exact, impartial Judgment. May my Lord and your Ladiship, after having been many years, the one an Ornament to the Church, the other an useful Pillar of the State, like ripe Fruit, in the Vintage of old Age, drop into Abraham's Bosom; and may those tender Branches, which Heaven hath blessed you with, commence as early and grow up as perfectly in Religion, as our most Christian Princess did, is the constant sin∣cere Prayer of,
Madam,
