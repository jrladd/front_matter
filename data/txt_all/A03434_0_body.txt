BEing already by true triall in o∣thers
sufficiently taught, and by
mutuall conference in my selfe
throughly perswaded of the synguler cur∣tesy,
and fauourable lenitie lodging with∣in
you, I was the bolder (Right Worship∣full)
at this present, to prefix your names
in the forehead of this little boke, in token
of that entire good wil, which (by an invi∣olable
vow) I beare to your persons, in re∣specte
of your rare vertues, and the great
desyre I haue to gratifye your surpassing
curtesyes, if my abilitie might stretch any
way, to counterpoyse the waight of my in∣ward
affection. And for as much as Na∣ture
hath linked you togither so straightly

and firmely, with the infringible chaine of
Consanguinitie, kinred, and agreement of
maners: I demed it an offence equal almost
with sacrilege, for so smal a matter as this,
to seperate and disseuer you. Beseeching
your Worships to make no other cōstructi∣on,
or interpretation of my meaning, then
my simplicitie pretendeth, and by your
friendlye acceptaunce hereof, to coun∣tenaunce
the trauayle of him, who is
not now to aunswere for himselfe: whiche
request I make the more earnestly for him,
for that in such a case, a man may with
more face of honesty, sue and intreate for
his friend, then for himselfe. Of whyche
your accustomed fauoures, as I nothing
stande in doubte: So doe I heartilye bee∣seeche
God, to prosper, protect, and direct
you in all your rightfull attemptes, and
Godly enterpryses, and after many yeres

here Worshipfully spent, to make you o∣heyres
with his Sonne Christ, in his glori∣ous
Hierarchie.
At Butley this .xxx. of
October. 1577.
