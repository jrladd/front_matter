IT will seeme all together monsterous and unheard of, that a poore woman of a low condition, shee being also a stranger should dare present a petition unto your worships the Illu∣strous and renowned Magistrats and Governours of this Citty, but having understood the Pious and Charitable Answers which have beene given unto those that have addressed themselves unto your worships and how ready alwaies you are to administer Iustice with Iudgment, have taken upon mee bouldnesse to do it, also knowing that great Monnarchs among which wee reade of an Emperour being on Horsbacke ready to goe to warres allighted from his horse to heare the complaint of a poore woman the which wee reade of in a booke called Dorte of Marcus Aurelius Chapter 47. This Em∣perour although he were a Pagan being neere his death called his Sonne unto him admonishing him unto speedy Iustice towards all, especially unto women, recommending unto him the cause of a poore woman a widdow named Drusia which had a great suit against one of the senat, by reason that at the last distrations her hus∣band was banished, I have great pitty of her said he unto his Sonne, for there are three months past since she presented unto me her peti∣tion, but by reason of my great affaires for warre I could not de∣clare her Iustice, and now right worshipfull seeing that by the
will of God theise mournefull and unnaturall warres are neere to an end I hope your worships will be pleased to vouchsafe so much time as to consider my just cause for it is against a senat or consistory and this buissinesse is upon the cause of the banishment of my spouse, I say spiritualli neverthelesse their power cannot reach further then the signe, but in regard of the thing signified this spouse is entered by faith into my heart, Ephesians Chapter 3 now my humble petition unto your worships, is to desire your worships to grunt unto me, that I may receive the communion among your people to the end I may not be deprived of that visible signe, as by the grace of God, I am not, of the thing signified.
