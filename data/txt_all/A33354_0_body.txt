My Lord,
BEing now to expose this Poetical Essay to the mercy of the censuring World, and considering, under whose Pa∣tronage I might adventure the Pub∣lication: I humbly presum'd your Lordship, both as a person eminent in Piety, Virtue, and Learning; and by the high Character you bear in the Government as supream Judge of that Illustrious Court, upon which my Profession as a Lawyer has af∣forded me a dependance now these many years, to be the only Person, to whom I could with honour dedi∣cate this Proiece; especially being encourag'd to it by your Lordships generous perusal, and approbation of some of the Sheets in privat.
I do therefore, my Lord, address this Poetical Composure to your Lordship, as to a Person, whose sublime Soul I know entertains the true Sentiments of Mortality, and the transient vanity of this World, of which this admirable Book of JOB affords so large, and spacious a Field for Contemplation, as a Mind but even a little elevate above the Dust of the World, and furnish'd but with ordinary Parts, may in pri∣vate Meditations on the several Texts, far exceed my most polish'd Reflections on the Subject: the exercise of Contemplation being so pleasing to an ingenuous Spirit, as what in other Sciences reiteration renders nauseous, in this it adds fresh Desires, and makes the Soul so enamou'd with but even a random Prospect of its true, and permanent Felicity, which it discovers through the Telescope of Conten plation, as it undervalues all the Afflictions of this Life, in the satisfaction of what nothing can parallel on this side Separation.
The ground of my Address to your Lordship proceeding then from that esteem, which all this Nation has for you, as a Person, who, in the Affairs of greatest Importance, affords daily Proofs of your eminent Abi∣lities, I do not so much, as approach the borders of Flattery, if I name your Lordship one of the prime Ornaments of the Age, in which you live.
For seriously, my Lord, when I compare the Figure you make in the State, with that of your years, (contrary to the Vulgar opinion, That Wisdom only dwells in aged Breasts;) I must acknowledge with the learned young man, who bears no small part in the ensuing Discourses, that—There is a spirit in man, and the instigation of the Almighty giveth under∣standing.
But as your Promotion, my Lord, in so small advance of years to the high Dignity, in which you now move, makes me admire the vivacity, and felicity of your wit, so (to augment the wonder) when I consider your Lordships younger Brother at this same time, shining in that emi∣nent station of Secretary of State, making thus betwixt you the most ly conspicuous pair of one Family, that has flourish'd, since the days of the two Illustrious Brothers Dukes of Hamilton; I find my self again oblig'd with that same Elihu to acknowledge, that the Spirit of God has made you both, and the breathing of the Almighty has given you life.
May this bright Constellation long shine in the Orb of our Government, and as you increase in Years, so may you both increase in Piety, and Virtue, advance in His Majesties Royal esteem, and the love of your Countrey, until such time, as two such refined Souls being translated to eternal Felicity, may make a fairer appearance in the Court of the King of kings, then mortal Men can make in that of a King upon Earth, to which the good Wishes shall never be deficient of him, whose Ambi∣tion is to be esteem'd,
My Lord,
