Honest Harry,
FAine I would say some∣thing, yet I know not (nor indeed care not much) what to say to thee; I know thou art one armed for all sayings. For to

speake truly, praise of thee would bee counted but phantasmie; and admira∣tion meere adulation: how canst thou want worth, who hast such an ample faculty in emblazoning, and (indeed sometimes) adding to the worth of o∣ther men? It likes my humour well to describe thine so well as I could: the best on it is, thy humour is my privi∣ledge; therefore if what is here writ∣ten sleightly, be ill read, and worse un∣derstood, I can excuse my selfe, (as many men doe their owne faults by o∣ther mens) saying, it is Harry Whites humour. Surely I thinke I have fitted thy humour in generall, if not I pray thee let thy particular humour pardon escapes. I have assaid to humour thee, invited by this benefit, that by hu∣mouring thee I shall humour a thou∣sand: now if any be in the humour to be vext at thy humour: tell them thy humour is armed against the assault

of any humour: thus wishing that thy humour may bee satisfied with tenne thousand two peny customers, I com∣mit thee to thy humour, and thy hu∣mour to thy custodie, desiring ever to rest, but never to be arrested.
