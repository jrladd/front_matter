'TIs pretended by every one that chooseth a Patron, that either the Worth or good Nature of the Person hath determined him to that choice; He professeth that He hath very mean thoughts of his own performance, and so stands in need of a Protector: He begs a Name whose Luster might shed some Reputation on his Work, or else hath been oblig'd,

and bound in gratitude to make this publick acknowledgment of the goodness of the Man. How emi∣nently. You Sir, are endow'd with the first qualification of a Patron every one knows too well to need information; and where can this trifle find a Corner that hath not been fill'd with Mr. Dryden's name? 'Tis You, Sir, that have advanc'd our Dramatick to its height, and show'd that Epick Poetry is not confin'd to Italy and Greece: That You are honored by the best, and envy'd by others, proclaims Excel∣lency and Worth; For True Ho∣nor is built only upon perfection And Envy, as it is as sharp sighted, so 'tis as soaring as an Eagle, and who ever saw it stoop at a Sparrow or a

Wren? And that Candor and Goodness have the greatest share in your Composition, I dare appeal to every one whom You have any way honored with your Conversa∣tion; These so fill your Mind, that there is no room left for Pride, or any disobliging quality: This ap∣pears from the Encouragement You are ready to give any tolerable at∣tempts, and reach out a helping hand to all those who endeavour to climb that height where You are already seated: E'en this own̄ its completion to those smiles which You condescend∣ed to bestow upon some parts of it, and now ventures to appear a second time where at first it found a favou∣rable Entertainment: 'Tis Horace, Sir, whom You have thought wor∣thy

your Study and Imitation, that flys to You for Protection, and perhaps will beg it against the Inju∣ries I my self have done him; You Sir are best acquainted with the difficulties of the Undertaking, can most easily discover, and as easily pardon the defects of
SIR,

Oxon. All Souls Coll. May 25th. 1684.
