MADAM,
MY Lady P. acquainted me 'twas your Desire, which is still to me a Command, that I should send you this small Book of Discourses and Essays: And tho' I know many of the Subjects they treat of to be light and trivial, yet I immedi∣ately concluded, tho' none of these Discourses are worthy your reading, yet all your Com∣mands are worthy my obeying; and I had much rather the World should know I write ill, than you, Madam, should have the least thought I obey you so.
And I humbly beg you to be∣lieve, Madam, that I do not pre∣sent you this Book upon any dependency I have of it's merit,
but meerly to publish the obli∣gations I owe you, which I must ever want ability to requite, but shall never lack justice to acknowledge.
And I hope, Madam, you will be the more easily perswaded to pardon this great confidence, when you consider that self-in∣terest now governs this World; and since a a King can raise and illustrate one of his meanest Sub∣jects, and render him Honoura∣ble by declaring him such; so, Madam, tho' this is one of the meanest Books Dedicated to you, yet if you will be pleased to raise and honour it with your counte∣nance, it cannot but thrive un∣der so great & noble a Patronage.
And pray, Madam, do not think I write this Book out of any hope to shew some Wit, when really I never so much as thought of it; but meerly to
publish the great honour I have for you, and how humble a Ser∣vant I am to you. And you know, Madam, 'tis as well a Mark of Sovereignty to have one's Image stampt upon a Pen∣ny, as a Guinea, the meanness of it's value, nor the smallness of it's Image, not at all lessening the great power of the Prince it represents.
No more can I, Madam, by placing your great Name to this small Book, in which your Vir∣tues being only meanly set off and painted but in Dead colours, can lessen and eclipse your high worth and splendid merits
I know, Madam, there are many great Ladies that keep a∣live in the Root the Title of their noble and ancient Families; but indeed there are very few that now-a-days bring any addition of Honour to their House: But
all know, Madam, that you not only keep alive in the Root, but your Merits spring, and flourish in all your Actions, both to your own, and Families Great Honour and Reputation; for you not on∣ly live to the height of greatness that any of the English Nobility now do, but to the height of Pie∣ty that any of the Primitive Chri∣stians ever did; for you make it your great delight to read God's Laws, and your main concern to keep his Commandments, never striving to procure a high place in Court, but to secure a good one in Heaven; still court∣ing the good, not the great; ne∣ver flattering the powerful, al∣ways praising the Virtuous, be∣ing only a Servant to the Ser∣vants of God, and not Courtier∣like an humble Servant in Words to all, scarce in deed a true Friend to any, who seldom speak
what they think, and rarely perform what they promise; their words being commonly, not the Interpreters, but Dis∣guisers of their Thoughts.
But, Madam, you still kept your self in a kind of religious retirement, out of the false and glittering Scenes of the Court; and not only from the common Vices and Vanities of England, but from the Foppish Modes, & high Extravagances of France, which were just upon being na∣turaliz'd here in England. And in∣deed you differ from most La∣dies, for they love much to re∣ceive Praises, but strive little to deserve them; but you, Ma∣dam, strive to deserve them, but love not to receive them; your great Humility adding a lustre to your high Quality, and your high Quality, adding a lustre to your true Humility, and a bles∣sing
too; for God still gives Grace to the humble.
I shall not here trouble you much, Madam, with a Character of the vain idle Vitioso Fopps of our time, nor here make it my business to set out the vain modish Ladies of our age, since both make it their main con∣cern to set out themselves, tho' in a very bad Figure; but my design here is, that because I did in my Youth perswade some young Wives to do what they ought not, I would now in my old age perswade all young Wives and Women to do what they ought, which is, To remem∣ber their Creator in the Days of their Youth, and to strive more for the true lasting Beauty of Ho∣liness, than the slight fading one of a fine Face, which is only a meer out-side Beauty; but the Beauty of Holiness is like
the King's Daughter, all glo∣rious within, which will bring one an agreeable satisfaction whilst one lives, and a sweet peace of Conscience when one Dies: The other, but high and proud vain thoughts whilst her Beauty lives; and sad Frettings and Discontents, when she finds it dies; for usually as the Mis∣tresses Beauty leaves her, so her Lovers Love leaves him; for Effects will follow their Cause.
And tho' many of the vain Modish Ladies are guilty of Pride, Vanity, and perhaps what's worse than both, yet most of them are so self-conceit∣ed of their own merit, as they had rather judg the World Cen∣sorious, than themselves faulty; like the Philosopher, that lost his sight, and yet would not be∣lieve himself blind, but that the Room was Dark.

And now, Madam, being to∣wards the end of my Letter, I shall speak as all Christians do, or at least ought to do, at the ending of their Lives, which is, to speak the truth from the bottom of their Heart, as I am sure I now do, by saying, your Virtuous Life, exemplary Piety, and your extraordinary Chari∣ty, which is not like that of most great Ladies, whose boun∣ty extends no farther than to that great Friend, or this near Kinsman, and that per∣haps more to inlarge their own fame, than to relieve his wants, and so savours more of Vain Glory, than true Cha∣rity: But, Madam, your Cha∣rity is so generally good, and bountifully great, as none need a better Title to it, than that of having a great need of it. In a word, Madam, your
whole Life has been a conti∣nued Series of noble and Pi∣ous Actions, which has ren∣der'd your Fame so compleat∣ly excellent, as you are not only an honour to your Name, but a credit to your Sex, and a comfort to both rich and poor about you, for you ob∣lige the great by your extra∣ordinary Civility, and relieve the poor by your abundant Charity.
Madam, your trouble of reading this Letter being now near at an end 'tis full time that my Apology for giving it you should now begin; and because 'tis a good saying I much like and follow, That plain dealing is still the best Policy, Truth being ever pi∣ctur'd naked, I shall tell you here, Madam, the plain and naked Truth how your Name
came to be plac'd in the Front of this little Book.
When my Lady P—acquaint∣ed me you desired to see it, she in a Rallying manner, bid me send it you with a fine E∣pistle Dedicatory; and I, in a like Rallying manner, told her I would; and presently writ thus far of this Letter: But upon my word, Madam, with∣out any thought or design, that it should ever come to your sight, much less to publick view: For assoon as I had writ it, I resolved never to shew it, or look on it more: But being to buy the second part of this Book to send a Friend, whose Servant stay'd purposely for it, after I had given it him, and he was gone, talking with the Book-Binder, he told me, he had very near sold all my Books; upon which I promi∣sed
him one, but it seems I had unfortunately forgot that I had left this Letter in the Book which I ordered to be carried to him; and he finding this Letter dedicated to your Lady∣ship, knowing the high Ho∣nour and great Esteem all have for you, concluded, That your Name in the Front of this Book, must needs stamp a Value on it, and breed a Curi∣osity in many for it, and so Printed this Letter and placed my Name to it, considering on∣ly his own profit by Printing it, not your trouble in reading it, or my discredit in owning it. Assoon as I heard of it, I went immediately much trou∣bled and surpris'd, to the Book-binder, who desired me not to be so much concern'd, for there were very few, if any, of the Books were sold that
had this Letter Dedicatory to your Ladyship Printed to them, they being but just come out of the Press, and that for paying his Charges for Print∣ing them, he would deliver me them all, which I readily consented to, and came a few days after to receive them; but this Book-binder was gone out of the World, and by his Death, my Book was disper∣sed in it, past all possibility of recalling.
This is, Madam, the plain truth, how your Name comes to be placed now in the Front of this little Book, when it was Printed some few Years before, without any Name to it at all; and that your Name is now, I am much asham'd of and humbly beg your Par∣don for it.
I have, Madam, in writing
these Discourses, made it my great concern to avoid all Roads and Paths that Essays usually Travel in, and treat of; but really Virgin-Themes, and fresh Provision of Wit is now so fearce to find, that many of our best Writers, and greatest Scholars are often forc'd to use cold Repetition Meats, to fur∣nish out their Books, as well as good House-keepers are cold Meats to set out their Tables. And tho' good Cooks can make several sorts of Dishes out of one kind of Meat, yet they cannot with all their skill, make one Dish to please all Palats, like the delightful Manna in the Wilderness, that gave a plea∣sant Gusto answerable to every Israelite's differing Taste: No more can one sort of Writing suit the Fancy of all kinds of Readers. I am sure I do not
expect these Discourses should please any one, they being Dull, and most of the Sub∣jects they write of, Light al∣most as very Light, as the airy Ladies they treat of, and are designed for; and therefore I am so far from pretending in the least, to any of my readers Praises, as I expect none from any, but beg pardon of all: And I truly wish this Book may perswade the vain young Ladies to beg God's: And that as I desire my Readers excuse for my dull Writing, they may their Maker's Pardon, for their vain living. I am sure I am doubly bound to beg your Ladyship's, both for giving you the trouble of reading this Book, and assuming the Con∣fidence of placing your Name, tho' undesignedly, to it.

But I will add no Excuses, know∣ing a Conclusion to a dull long Let∣ter is still the best Complement; I am sure, Madam, 'tis the only one I can ever justly pretend to make you, your Merits being much above all my Praises. I wish I could as truly say, That your whole Life were above all sorts of Troubles, that your reading this might not prove one to you; but as 'tis foolish to fear what's unavoid∣able, so 'tis to wish for Impossibilities, since the most great, the most virtu∣ous, and the most happy in this World are not free from Troubles, because they cannot be free'd from Sin; we are all unavoidable Tributa∣ries to it, being all born in an origi∣nal servitude to Sin, without any cer∣tain measure, or exact number.
But tho' the misery of Sinning is unavoidable, yet we ought to make our selves as Spiritually wise, and Worldly happy as we are able, that is, make our Sins as few, and all our
Troubles (except for our Sins) as lit∣tle as we can; and therefore, Madam, to make your Trouble the less in looking this over, I shall desire you to read it, but just after the rate I writ it, which was, when I had nothing else to do. And for all my other Readers, I only desire they will use these Discourses, no worse than most do maim'd Beggars, that is, though they want the Charity to relieve their Wants, yet not so to abound in ill Nature, as to jeer at their Defects: This is all I expect from them, and this is all, Madam, I humbly beg of you, That you will please to pardon this poor Book's Faults, and not jeer at its Defects, which shall ever be an Obligation placed on,
