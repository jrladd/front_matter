Noble Sir,
THe world sufficiently knowes that you nowewhat Ships and shipping are; that you haue plwd the dangerous O can, and surrowed ouer the rugged bosome of Neptune: yet neuerthelesse I know that you neuer  notice of my old and weather-beaten , being bult withut either tymber or Iron, rig'd without ropes or rdage, whose Ordinance are discharged without  or pouder, whose victuals are the bread, drinke, fish, flesh, or good Red-erring, whose voyages are  performed with wind and wa∣ter, yet euer in action like a perpetual motion; but when you shall please to sauour me so much as to peruse and suruay my strange Fleet or Armado, you will then perceiue that your selfe hath sayled in (or at the least)



boarded most of my Ships of note: for you are well ac∣quainted with the LORDSHIP, you are a friend to the SCHOLLERSHIP, you haue layd the LADISHIP aboard, you haue entred the APRENTISHIP, you are well knowne in the COVRTSHIP, you haue saild in the Good-FELLOWSHIP, you loue the FRIEND∣SHIP, you affect the FELLOWSHIP, you know the Foote-man-SHIP, you are skild in the HORS-MAN-SHIP, you haue had a principall Cabin in the SVRE∣TISHIP, you haue surpris'd & taken the WORSHIP, and you know what belongs to the WOOD-MANSHIP, the WARDSHIP, and STEWARDSHIP; I due for some reasons not meddle with all, and I thinke you haue sildome or neuer had any dealings with them: the some of all is, I most humbly desire your Worships pardon, for my abrupt Dedication, assuring you that it was onely my loue and dutie that put me on, without any expectance of Patronage, protection or reward: and so with my best wishes for the perpetuity of your present and euer future felicity, I rest,
