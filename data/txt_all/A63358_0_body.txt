My Lord,
YOƲR Advancement this Year to the Praetorial Chair of this Renowned City, may render you the Object of our Wonder, but not our Envy; especially when it is considered, it was Your right some Years before; With Justice now reassuming Your seat, it is a motive rather of Joy than Regret, and an Argument to gratulate your Establishment with greater Alacrity. The Ship that in a Storm over-shoots the Port, may toss a while upon the driving Bellows, but the next favourable Gale she Tacks about, and makes the expected Ha∣ven with greater Expressions of Joy and Welcome. We will not descant on the singular Favours of the Monarch, which is a boundless Ocean; nor on those extraordinary Indowments that have this Year deservedly advanced You to the Chair. It is sufficient You have had the Choice and Approbation of the most Judicious and most Discerning Prince in the World; to whose Royal Favours Your Essential Merits have most justly preferr'd You. It is He who with His breath can give You a successful passage into that Port from which You were retarded by contrary Winds, who has this Year made You His Vicegerent in His Impe∣rial City, to bear that Sword of Justice, of which He is him∣self the immediate Lord and Soveraign: And it is hoped, by Your wise Conduct and Management of this great Trust, the Effects will be such, that Your Lordship will render Him no less than reason to approve the Works of His own Hands. But these few Sheets are a Description, not a Directory; a Scheme of Pageantry, not a Scale of Government; nor will I in a short Dedication exceed the narrow bounds of,
MY LORD,
