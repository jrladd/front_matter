GOod Madame, this Booke of priuate prayer being brought vnto mee by a Friend to peruse, and being withall requested by him to write the Preamble to the booke with three or foure Prayers for certain particular vses, I yeelded to him, and haue made

choyse of your Ladiship, on whom I might bestow it, being assured of your deuout affection, and kinde acceptance of these my labours, and endea∣uours, I goe not about to teach you that, you know not; but rather put you in mind of what you know already, desiring nothing more then that your pious disposition might increase vnto the period of our time. Pray∣er (saith S. Augustine) is a Speach to God: when you read, God speakes to you: when you pray you speake with God; a seruice it is of no small commoditie.

For by it wee obtaine good things, and the re∣motion of euilles, by it our faith is exercised and increased, our loue is pro∣ued, our zeal is inflamed, Gods graces are augmen∣ted, his creatures sancti∣fied, tentations vanqui∣shed, and the tempter ba∣nished. To this GOD hath giuē vs his precept, and made vs a promise: Christ hath also giuen vs a patterne, and his owne ensample: his Saints hath made it their practise, and we are dayly called vnto it, and now more then heretofore the iudge∣ments of GOD hauing

beene within these few yeeres very strangely in∣flicted vpon vs, by grie∣uous and long lasting pe∣stilence, by inundation of waters, extremitie of cold & heat, of drought and moisture, vnusuall diseases, and outrageous windes, so as it may bee feared he hath some far∣ther punishments yet re∣maining, except by our deuout and instant pray∣ers, and sincere repen∣tance he may be pacified. I suppose it therfore not vnmeet for euery one to stir vp himselfe, and one to excite another to this duty, so needfull & com∣modious.

Accept there∣fore I pray you of these things, as written to this end; so shall I count my labors (if any) wel rewar∣ded, and my selfe conten∣ted. The God of Grace vouchsafe you his grace, whiles you liue on earth, and make you shine in immortall glorie with him in the heauen.
