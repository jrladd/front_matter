HONORABLE SIR,
HIstorians report, that the Scy∣thians were so far out of loue with learning, that it was a shame and disgrace for any man amongst them to be e∣steemed a scholler. The name of a Scythian, all Christians cannot choose but detest and abhorre. And yet is this their opinion, as we heare, maintained by the Nobilitie of some Nations. An argument, as I thinke, sufficient a∣lone, if historians were silent, to shew from what race such men are descended. Barbarous, I am sure it is, & no way consonant to the nature of man. For as the Philosopher saith, Omnes homines naturâscire desiderant. And, Prudentia (saith the O∣rator) quae in vericognitione consistit, maxime natu∣ram attingit humanam. The Nobilitie therefore of

England, are in this most highly to be commen∣ded, who do generally so much esteeme of lear∣ning, that they thinke nothing more honorable then either to be accounted learned, or great pa trons of learning: Knowing indeed that, as the Poet saith, In prudentia Nobilitas sita est. This ge∣nerallitie first: and then next, your honorable af∣fection and fauour to me in particular, hath em∣boldened me to offer this small Pamphlet vnto your patronage, vt aliquod saltem extaret meae inte obseruantiae & gratitudinis monumentum. Vale, V. O. ac nos tibi iampridem deuinctissimos, deuinctiores, si fieri potest, reddito. Londini Anglorum viij Kalend. Martias, an. MDCXIIII.
