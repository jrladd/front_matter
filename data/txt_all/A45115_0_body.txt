MADAM,
IT hath pleased the Divine Provi∣dence to order the lines of my habi∣tation at a large distance from you, so that I cannot personally pay those respects and services to your Lady∣ship, which your many and multipli∣ed favours enjoyn me to; hence I take the boldness to present you with these few sheets, which may be as a
standing Monument and testimonial of my gratitude; and I make no question of a Candid reception of these papers from your Ladyship; seeing your doors lately were so freely open to the Authour, in the day of his distress, when he was unfit for pub∣lick service, and lay under the proud triumphs of a Chronical distemper. I find how Saint Jerome Dedicated severall of his Commentaries, and other exquisite Pieces which he penned, to Eustochium, Marcella, Paulina, and divers other Roman Virgins and Matrons, which may well Apologize for me in this particular, seeing your Ladyship doth Sym∣pathize with those renowned Saints, whose understand∣ing in the sacred Oracles was so remarkable, and stupendious. Indeed it had been more modish (as it is accounted now adays) to have tendred to your Ladyship, some quaint Romance, some specu∣lative rarity, or the solution of some strange Phenomenon; many thinking that Abanah and Pharpar rivers of Damascus, are more excel∣lent then the waters of Jordan, or the pool of Siloam: but you know my Profession leads me to the Gospel of Salvation; and I know your Ladyships temper to be such, that though you have a large acquaintance with the controver∣sies of nature, yet nothing is so relishing to your
Spiritualized appetite, as the certain Topicks and conclusions of sacred Scripture; from whence I take the confidence to represent to your view, (as an encouraging pattern) the holy deportment of angelical Beings, examples beyond the reach of Momus, or the envy of a querulous reprehender; and I must beg your Ladyships pardon, if I tell the world, that I believe few of your Sex go be∣yond you, in these supernal excellencies I am treat∣ing of, viz. unity, purity, obedience, thank∣fulness, and the constant service of the great Creatour, the fruit and sweetness of which you will undoubtedly reap, when these heavenly messen∣gers shall gather the Elect, from the several quarters of the spacious world; then shall your Ladyships fer∣vent piety, diffusive charity, your assiduous meditati∣ons, and daily supplications, together with your wor∣thy respect to the Lords Embassadours, receive their promised retribution. I have no more, but to importune the Divine Majesty, that he would bless your Lady∣ship with all manner of blessings in our common Saviour, that he would be the staff and support of your declining age, that his candle may shine upon your bead, and your tabernacle may be in peace, that your seed may be great, and your offspring as the grass of the earth, that you may come to the grave in a full
age, as a shock of corn cometh in his season, and after all, may be made eternally happy with the full enjoy∣ment of that beatifical vision, which the Saints long and wait for: And this shall ever be the fervent option, of
