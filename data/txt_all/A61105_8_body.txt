Courteous Reader,
THe outward figure of this book, is like the dish called an Oleo, a Mess of all together, which I have so composed on purpose to give content to every appetite, at least to some. If any do nauseate the whole Mess, let such consider whether the fault be in the platter, or in their palate. I have formed it in way of a Dialogue, because it is an inquisitive age, and also be∣cause such kind of writing comes off more quick and home to the understan∣ding, then long discourses, which oftentimes wearieth the Reader, and con∣founds the memory. The matter of it is universall and generall, that people may find in it something of every thing that obviously comes into their ears or mind; for all which with their appendences, I refer thee to the Table at the end, but rather to the diligent reading of the book it selfe, whose Erra∣ta in the Printing, are set down at the end also. The quotations of Scrip∣ture I desire thee to search and read, because I have omitted the words of the Text, lest the volume swell too big. Let me intreat thee to read and judge favourably,Greg. Naz. though I had rather my friend should use his liberty, then my ene∣my flatter me. The end why I wrote this tract, is because I have beheld with asad heart, the tares of division sprung up too thick in this our field, or Church, of late years, by which is bred many heresies in Parishes, and many schisms among Ministers. I know that there be pieces more accurately written upon many things discoursed of in this book, but they be dispersed in divers volumes, and many know not where to find them. Here there∣fore I have collected many, and directed thee to more. So that I hope this my poor pains may stay some that stagger, and recall some that wander, and so help to nourish Christian communion which is almost lost. And this is all he aimeth at, and praieth for, who is, and ever (by Gods grace) will be,
