May it please your HIGHNESSE,
THAT Gods Holy Morall Law may be duly ob∣served, Christian Liberty not encroached upon, the inward Man commanded by Trueth, and Toleration tolerable be tolerated, is the designe of this short ensuing dis∣course. It had its conception many
Moneths ago, and was intended for the late Supream Authority of this Com∣mon-wealth of England, but now it casts it self before your Highness, whom God hath raised up, and into whose hands, power, and opportunities are put to bring great designes into action. This is your day to honour him eminently, by whom Kings Reign and Princes decree judgement. The brood of Travellours returned Exlies must be served too for Christ's sake, who is their Lord and yours. That it is a piece of your work to take away Snares that have been spread in the way of Saints, and yet ly unremoved, I humbly suppose you know much better than I can tell. These Lines rightly understood, refin'd, and observed, may be a Cloud like a Mans hand for further fruitful Rain, that your day may not slip to you, or slide too fast for us, is the prayer of your Highness humble servant,
