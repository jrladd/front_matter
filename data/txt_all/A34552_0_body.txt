MY LORD,
REflecting upon the hearty Affection that you bear both to His Maje∣sty's Person and Government, and the Greatness of the Post in which you now stand, which renders you serviceable to both; I have presumed to shelter this plain Discourse under your Honour's Pa∣tronage, and sent it abroad into the World under the Protection of your Name.
The Design of it is to convince some, to confirm others, and to shew how sin∣cerely zealous I am for the Publick Good
both of the Church and State. I hum∣bly beg your Honour's Pardon for my Presumption in this Dedication, since here∣by only I have the Advantage of demon∣strating my zealous Affections towards, and grateful Acknowledgment of your excellent Merits, and to shew how much I am,
MY LORD,
