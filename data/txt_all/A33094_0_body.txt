My Lord,
I Could not slip this opportunity to testifie my Loyalty to my King, and
my Gratitude to you, being, so zealously, enflam'd with Both, that
I needed but the least hint of an Occasion wherein to let them Flash
out.
And for the First; as I bless God that I Derive my Extract from
a Father whose eminent Loyalty to the Royal Family, expos'd him not a
little to the cruelty of the late Ʋsurpers, and made him no small sharer in
those Losses and Sufferings which were then the common Fate of all good
men; So I do, that being Educated by him in those Principles, which
were so dear to himself, I have never understood what it was to entertain
the very remotest liking to Traitors and Rebellion, whatsoever was the
pretended Account whereupon they were engaged; but have always detested
them as the greatest Plagues and Calamities of Humane Nature, as well
as Society. Wherefore being no less prompted by my Inclination, than
oblig'd by my Duty, to Preach the following Sermon, not only to those
of that Congregation which God and the King has entrusted to my Care,
but also before so considerable an auditory as the whole Gentlemen of Selkirk
and Peebles Shires, whose Loyalty had brought together for His Maje∣sties
Service, I thought it would not be amiss, should I likewise spread
it over the whole Nation, especially in this Juncture, that the Ge∣nerous
and Loyal Resentments which is rais'd in its first Auditors, might
possibly become as Universal, as in them they were Great.

But, My Lord, What shall I say, as to the latter? How shall I exs¦press
my Gratitude for such a transcendent Goodness as Your Lordship ha
been pleas'd to vouchafe toward me, whereby I must not only one to You
all that I have, but whatever I shall have? But remembring that it
was propagated even so far, as, upon my first aiming to signifie the deep∣est
acknowledgements, I could either frame, or harbour, to tell me, That
to say nothing, was the best way to say all, I shall not now break a
Silence, which was then so obligingly enjoyn'd, and which never can pos∣sibly
be broke without too much injuring what can no otherwise be fully ex∣prest,
but by It.
Only I must begg the pardon to say, that as never King had a more
entirely Loyal and Devoted Chancellor to his Service, as never Church
or Church men had a more zealous and constant Friend, and as never
Learning or Scholars had a braver and more noble Patron, or a greater
Scholar to be such unto them, than all have in Your Lordship; So ne∣ver
Patron had or shall have a more ambitiously grateful Dependent, than
You have in
My Lord
