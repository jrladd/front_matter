MOst lines do not
the best conceit containe,
Few words well coucht
may comprehend much matter:
Then, as to vse the first
is counted vaine,
So is't praise-worthy
to conceit the latter.
The grauest wits
that most graue works expect.
The qualitie,
not quantitie respect.


The smallest sparke

will cast a burning heate,
Base cottages
may harbour things of worth:
Then though this volume be,
nor gay, nor great,
Which vnder your Protection
I set forth:
Do not with coy
disdainefull ouersight
Deny to reade
this well meant orphans mite.


And since his father
in his infancie
Prouided patrons
to protect his heire:
But now by Deaths
none-sparing crueltie,
Is turn'd an orphan
to the open ayre:
I, his vnworthy
foster-sire haue darde,
To make you
Patronizer of this warde.


You glorying issues
of that glorious dame,

Whose life is made
the subiect of deaths will:
To you, succeeding hopes
of mothers fame,
I dedicate this fruite
of South wels quill:
He for your vnkles comfort
first it writ,
I for your consolation
priat and send you it.


Then daine in kindnesse
to accept the worke,
Which be in kndnesse writ,
I send to you:
The which till now clouded,
obscure did lurke;
But now opposed
to ech Readers view,
May yeeld commodious fruite
to euerie wight,
That feeles his conscience prickt
by Parcaes spight.


But if in ought
I haue presumptuous bene,
My pardon-crauing pen

implores your fauour:
If any fault in print
be past vnseene
To let it passe,
the Printer is the crauer,
So shall he thanke you,
and I by duty bound,
Pray, that in you
may all good gifts abound.
