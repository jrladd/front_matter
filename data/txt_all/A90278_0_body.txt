TO excuse the Dedication of a Book,
which seems not to be like Apples of Gold
in Pictures of Silver, in a Time of so much
Preparation for War, this is my Apologie: The
brief Discourse following, being Composed in
Ireland, where through the Presence of God
with You, in Your great Employment, I enjoy∣ed
Peace and Quietness for a season in the ser∣vice
of my Master, and now stepping into the
[⁂]

World, by Providence, upon Your return into
this Nation, it seems to crave the Signature of
Your Name at the Entrance: Besides, being
almost wholly Polemical (for men of Learning
also, have their Polemicks, and those, as in the
mannagement of some, as pernitious to the Na∣tions
professing the Name of Christ, as the Con∣test
of the Sword) it layes a Second Claim ther∣unto,
from its Proportion to the present Work
whereunto You are called forth.
Perhaps the Differences, about which the
Contest here mannaged, is, may appear to some,
not to be of so great Weight and Importance,
as to deserve that serious and publick Agitati∣on,
which is now given to them: especially in
these dayes, wherein things of neerer Concern∣ment
to the Foundation of Faith, do come con∣tinually
under Debate. But besides that no one
Title, of the Faith once delivered unto the Saints,
is to be yeelded unto gain-sayers, the Way
wherby Opposition is made unto any Truth, is
seriously to be considered. It was said of Caesar,
That solus accessit sobrius ad perdendam rempublicam,
he alone (amongst many other undertakers) at∣tempted
soberly to destroy the Cōmon-wealth,
and therefore was the most earnestly to be
resisted. In the Broaching of many Opinions,
abhorrent from the Truth of the Gospel in
these dayes, very few have gone soberly to
Work. For the most part, a perverse Spirit of
Giddiness hath been mingled with their underta∣kings,

wherby, though they have made a great
Noise in the World, and overthrown the Faith of
some, yet their beloved self-Conceptions being
full of self-Contradictions, asserted with much
Passion and Confidence, little Reason or Judg∣ment,
having no determinate End affixed to
them, I no way doubt, but that in due Time
they will easily sink of themselves.
He, with whom, in some part of this Trea∣tise,
I have to do, hath been serious in his un∣dertaking,
and being not destitute of Abilities
for the carrying on of his Intendment, it is re∣quisite
the Truth by him mistaken, should re∣ceive
a serious Vindication, which I hope also
is performed, so far as Occasion, was by his
Writing, to me administred.
Neither will the things here Discussed I am
perswaded seem light unto you, who have
learned to value every Truth of God, at the
Rate, whereunto it is stamped from above: e∣specially
those which so neerly Concern him,
whom Your Soul loveth, as these following wil
be found to do.
For my own part, having no kind of Interest
in the things now a doing, neither one way, nor o∣ther,
but only so far, as the great Interest of
Christ and the Gospel is concerned, nor any de∣sign
in my Thoughts, but only to lay hold of e∣very
orderly Advantage to Preach the Lord
Jesus, and him Crucified, even him alone; and
withal, to give Testimony to the whole Coun∣sel
[⁂]

of God, as revealed in his Word, in Opposi∣tion
to the many foolish Delusions, which
through the Craft of Satan, and the Vanity of
mens darkned minds, have got entrance into
the World, continually lamenting the sad mi∣stake
of many Ministers of the Gospel immix∣ing
themselves so far in Civil Contests, as to
make them oftentimes the subject of their
publick pains in Preaching and Writing, I
hope there is no need of an Apologie, for my
labouring in this kind.
As to this Presentation of these few Sheets
to You, besides what is above mentioned, my
Assurance of Your faithful adherence to the
forme of wholsome Words, and pattern of sound Do∣ctrine,
that cannot be gain-said, gave Encou∣ragement
unto,
June 1.
Your Excellencies
most humble and obliged Servant,
in our dearest Lord,
