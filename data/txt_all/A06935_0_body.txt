IF I should labor (right Honourably honou∣rable, and you glori∣ous Branches of these goodly Cedars which I would preserue to Eternitie) to giue a generall contentment to all which shall vouchsafe to looke vpon this litle Treatise: my worke would be infinite, and the ende like a shadow euer farthest off when I did couet to be most neere it; for it is a max∣ime: That he which did well, offended some, yet an Apostle; Hee that did worst, pleased many, and yet was but a Beast; and He that did best of all, could not please all, and yet was God; So various are the mindes of men, and so curi∣ous the dyet of those which feede on varie∣tie;

Besides Slaunder (who hath much Tongue and litle Fore-head, who is not pleased, but in licking of Vlcers. Is euer so Impudent, that it dare mis-interpret, Nick∣name and abuse any vertuous meaning: therefore to these children of Spleene and Passion (who are mouthd like Anius-Satire, & can blow both hot & cold at one instant) I direct none of my Labours; But to You, You that are the Issues of true Honour; You in whom they all liue of whom I haue written; You whom Goodnesse will not gine leaue to doe or thinke any thing euill; to You, in all humblenesse, I direct this Seruant of your Families Vertues: doe not imagine it is a Chronickle of all their Noble Actions, farre be it from my weak∣nesse to aime at a Worke of such merit: let it suffice it is but an Essay or Imperfit offer of those excellencies, which no doubt, will hereafter draw a Penne of Immortalitie to to crowne them. Nor was this done so much to extoll and renowne them, as to quicken and set on fire the noble hearts of many others, which now like some of the Statues or the Monuments in

West-Minster lye sleeping on their El∣bowes: Thus if the Worke bee taken, it hath got a true Coniecture, if other∣wise, that men bee couetous, and will seeke for more then my Knowledge is able to pay; Let them not blame mee, if I giue there expectations leaue to pe∣rish, and only submit my selfe, and my Labour to Your noble Censure, beseeching Your Charitie to protect it, whilst my selfe will euer liue,
