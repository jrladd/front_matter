SIR;
I Haue nothing of my owne worthy of your loue; but behold a great Worke of ano∣ther Mans in this little Volume, I

Dedicate vnto you. It was presen∣ted to a great Emperour, Charles the Great, and by him it was ap∣proved as heire generall to the anci∣ent Fathers: The Author is now after 800. yeeres questioned for his birth-right, and the Polemicall Writers of this Age are not as yet agreed whether he spurious or legi∣timate. I hope the Preface follow∣ing (his very enemies being Iud∣ges) will free him from that impu∣tation. His revennue is the doctrine of the blessed Sacrament, ancient and hereditarie: His tenure is in Capite of the Lord Paramount. My suite is an Information may be exhibited against his accusers, and if you see no iust cause whereof they

doe accuse him, let your wonted Iu∣stice decree him for the right heire; if otherwise, let him stand or fall according to your Wisedome, and his owne worth, and in doing him this right, you shall oblige me with the rest of your favours faithfully to loue you and yours.
