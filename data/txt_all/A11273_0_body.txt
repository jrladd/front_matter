AFter I had wearied my vnsetled brayne, with the finding out of a fit Patron, or indifferent Iudge, for the defence or equall censure of my Apologeticall answer, to a bitter Declamation, lately come abroad against me, I could hit of none more fit then your Gaffer∣ship, whose equall carriage, both to mee, and Haec Vir (since I did first know you) hath beene such, that it can be hardly iudged, to whom you are most inclined. One day you weare yellow Bands, Feathers, Scarffes; cuts your haire and powders it, paints your face so all the weeke, that vpon Sunday, a pound of sope will not reduce it
 to the right colour; you dance, sing, and vse o∣ther jouiall conceits, wherein I (poore Wench) much delight; but when I looke vpon your Hornes, your Garters, Roses, and other your Feminine masculine fashions, then J perceiue you participate also with Haec Vir, and are in∣differently affected to vs both. Wherefore (good Gaffer) seeing Truth hath yeelded it selfe to be the Clyent of my answer, let this poore Apologie find such rich fauour with you, that you will become Patron thereof, censuring this Exclama∣tion of mine, rather by my passions and di∣stractions, at the writing thereof, then by the iudicious or formall dige∣sting of it,
In the doing whereof, you shall oblige me to continue
