BE pleased Sir these lines for to peruse,
The weak inventions of a Rustick Muse.
Which although small and worthless, yet doth show
The love and service I unto you owe.
Augustus Caesar was to Poets kinde,
Nor was Mecenas any thing behinde:
Doe thou like them, but patronage my pen,
Renowned shall thy name continue, when
Each griple wordlings fame shall rot and dy,
Wanting true worth to raise their memory,
Such mighty power in a Muse doth ly.
If the three Sisters lengthen out my daies,
The thrice three Sisters shall chant forth thy praise.
Yours in all service, William Winstanley.
