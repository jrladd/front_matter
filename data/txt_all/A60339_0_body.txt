Friends,
_HAving by the especial help of my God, finished and published a Collection
of his promises of good things to us: I here present you with some Vowes, of our obedi∣ence unto him: Had not my imployments for the Publique hindred, I had by the LORDS assistance, plainly proved every Particular, by expresse places of Scriptures; but I hope all is so con∣sonant to sound Do∣ctrine, and the pat∣terne of wholesome words, that there needs
no dispute, I know in these high flying times, such meane matters as these, are with many of small esteeme: How∣ever, I humbly leave them to the due consi∣deration of godly, meeke and judicious minded men, desiring all may be for Christi∣an satisfaction, and no way tend to unedifying contention; they con∣cerne Souldiers espe∣cially in many parti∣culars: Well, such as
the Worke is, if you please to accept, and make good use of it, 'tis all I desire from you for it. Farewell in Christ our Rede∣mer, Amen.
