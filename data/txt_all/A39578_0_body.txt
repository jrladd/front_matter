SIR,
IT pleased
you upon
the death
of your
dear Consort, to



make choice of me
(the most unwor∣thy)
to preach at
her Funerall. My
affections to you
were strong obliga∣tions
upon me, I
was willing to per∣form
any Service
within my compasse
for her that was
dead, from whom I
enjoyed so many real
Respects when she
was alive. I was
Debtor to you both
for very much love,



and therefore willing
to serve you both in
doing this last Office
for her, which was no
other according to
Scripture language)
then your self;Ephes. 5. 28, 29. When
you engaged me to
this work, my hands
were full of trouble∣some
businesse about
my removal into the
Countrey, which
though it did not take
me off, yet did much
indispose me for this
Service; But being



engaged, I laid aside
(as much as I could)
other thoughts, that I
might be in my mea∣sure
provided to offer
something which
might be sutable to
the present occasion,
and usefull to those
that should be my Au∣ditors
in that Solem∣nity.
I intended no
more then the service
of my Master, and the
benefit of the hearers
by the bare preaching
of a Sermon. Yet



when it was done,
whiles my affections
were stirring, and be∣fore
I cooled, I was
drawn contrary to
my former inclinati∣ons,
to promise you
the Notes of what I
had preached▪ And
since my promise, you
have kept me warm
with your letters, that
I might not recede. I
confess I judge my self
of rashnes in that pro∣mise,
and I have smar∣ted
for it; for my own



thoughts have been a
press to me, before
my Notes come under
the Press for you. I
know mine own na∣kednes,
and have so
much pride in me, that
I can hardly be willing
that others should
have occasion to take
notice of that naked∣nes.
But it may be God
may stirre up some
faithfull friend to be∣stow
some wholsome
reproof upon me, and
that may repair my



loss by some real ad∣vantage.
I am resolved
to trust the Lord.
Sir, what they were,
when they were deli∣vered,
I have sent
them to you without
any new clothes. You
have called for them
earnestly, I have only
crouded for time to
transcribe them And
now you have them
much good may do you
with them. They teach
a very weighty lesson
under the Cross, viz.



To be dumb, and not o∣pen
the mouth, because
of Gods doing. A lesson
for all that are trained
up in the School of
affliction, but especi∣ally
directed to you
at this time, that you
may learn with humble
silence to bear the smart∣ing
twigs of that Rod
which lies upon your
back, in the loss of so
great a Comfort, by
th with-drawing of
so sweet, so good a
Companion. I hope



you have learned this
lesson. Something I
think I saw before I
left you, I shall be glad
if yet they may con∣tribute
any thing fur∣ther
towards your
help, and the satisfa∣ction
of those dear
Friends that were in
near relation to he
that is with God, who
in regard of the man∣ner
of her death, see∣med
more dis-satisfi∣ed,
and therefore as
they have need, so



possibly they may
gain some advantag
by the reading o
what they heard.
A part of these
Notes were used at
the Funeral of ano∣ther
Friend, the good
wife, of a very good
man that lives in the
Parish of Brides. I pre∣sent
the whole that
neither of you may
complain of loss. My
prayer shall be, that
you, and all that read
them, may reap some



good fruit by them,
that God may have
the glory of an hum∣ble
silent submission
under the Crosse,
who hath so much
dishonour by our
sins that bring the
Crosse: And if this
may be the issue of
these poor, weak,
unpolished lines, he
that praies shall have
occasion to adde
praises, and Thanks∣givings
for so rich a
blessing to the God



of his Mercies. To
whom, and to whose
Mercies, he com∣mends
you, who is
