My Lord,
I Have presum'd to Publish this No∣vel
under your Lord∣ships Protection, know∣ing that your Name (amongst the Judici∣ous) renders Authen∣tick whatsoever bears its Stamp.
But besides This, there are other Mo∣tives, which have rai∣sed me to this Confi∣dence: Your Lord∣ship has been pleas'd
to Honour me with your continued Fa∣vours. And, my Lord, I hope you will Ac∣cept this Acknowledg∣ment, as a Testimo∣ny how much I own your Kindness.
'Twou'd be imper∣tinent to swell this De∣dication with an Ac∣count of Your Lord∣ship's eminent Birth
and Qualities; Those the World already knows, though it can∣not sufficiently admire: for which Reason, I shall be silent; only adding, That I am, in all Respects,
My Lord,
