BEing perswaded (Right Noble Lady) by some friends, for publike be∣nefit to make this colle∣ction of words common, which at first was inten∣ded only for priuate vse, (as written in my youth, at the request of a worthy Gentleman, one whose loue preuai∣led much with me) I could not find in heart to send it forth, no better furnished than with a bare Title; least like an vnknowne Infant, it should be exposed to ouer hard vsage, or per∣aduenture scornefully reiected, aduenturing abroad without countenance of any friend or commander. Vpon sure knowledge there∣fore

of your most honourable disposition, and former experience of your Ladyships fauour toward me, I am emboldned to pre∣sent this little Pamphlet vnto your honour, with hope that by your Patronage it shall not onely be protected from iniuries, but al∣so finde fauourable entertainment, and per∣haps gracefully admitted among greatest Ladies & studious Gentlewomen, to whose reading (I am made beleeue) it will not proue altogether vngratefull. And although I may well be taxed of folly or presumption, that for credit of a slender trislle, craue the assistance of so eminent a person, yet such (I confesse) is my care thereof (since I must not deny it for my owne) and my duty and de∣uotion so affected to your honour, and all yours; that I haue, (hoping of your Ladiships pardon) wilfully repelled all reasons which might disswade me, choosing herein not so much what may seeme most seemely, as what I suppose most behoouefull for me.
Accept therefore I beseech your Honour, and receiue vnder your noble tuition this lit∣tle vocabulary Treatise, which hauing beene many years restrained of liberty, is now glad of enlargement, especially recommended vn∣to so worthy a Patronesse. The glorious Sun

loseth not the least point of his heighth by liberall lending downe his light, and quick∣ning with his influence the lowest creatures; neither is any eminency disgraced, that easi∣ly condescendeth to others desired good: which is also confirmed by the Poet, who saieth;
Conspicitur nunquam meliore potentia causa,
Quàm quoties vanas non sinit esse preces.
Not thinking needfull therfore to trouble your Honour with many words of entreaty (vpon assured confidence of your wel known Charity and goodnesse) I conclude, sincere∣ly wishing to your Ladiship, the best that may be wished, and resting my selfe euer.
