Most Gracious Sovereign,
YOur Majesties Royal Grandfather King James, the Peace-maker, was by the Wisest of His Age justly reputed worthy to be entituled Great Britain's Solomon, for His Wisdom, Learning, and Prosperous Govern∣ment.
Your Pious and Judicious Father King Charles the First His esteem of the more Inge∣nuous and Politer Arts, Sculpture, Picture, and whatever else was Ancient or Excellent, drew hither into His own Galleries and Cabinets, and other Noble Palaces of this happy Island, the best Monuments of Old Greece, and of Modern Rome: And His own Incomparable Writings will demonstrate to succeeding Ages, how richly he was furnished with the best kinds of Knowledge, and with the truly Celestial and Divine Arts, which appeared in the whole
 Course of His Life, but most of all in His last Sufferings.
And now Your Majesty hath not only an Hereditary Claim to Your Ancestors Virtues and Blessings, being by God's miraculous Pro∣vidence and Protection restored, and redeemed from Your Fathers Calamities; but herein You have infinitely excelled them all, and that in the main, in that You are the first Founder of a Royal Institution for the Advancement and Propagation of all Noble Arts and Beneficial Inventions: So that all the Kings in the Chri∣stian World do emulate Your Great Example, and do value themselves in nothing more, than that some of their wisest Subjects do follow and adore the Foot-steps of Your Royal Society. And by this that Everlasting Renown is alrea∣dy spread over the face of the whole Earth; it hath surrounded the Globe by Sea and Land; and we who are Borderers on the Shores, and all they who inhabite on the deep Seas, are wit∣nesses of the perpetual Ecchoes of your Fame, with this Averment, That the better Spirits in all the Universities of Christendom are allured by Your Majesties Lustre to embrace and rejoyce in this Brighter Light, which can never hence∣forth be extinguished. And this constrains as well all Your Loyal and True-hearted Sub∣jects, as all Intelligent and Friendly Foreiners, to offer their Applauses, Veneration, and Ad∣miration.
But it is far above the reach of my Abilities
 to make just report of these Great Designs, and of all Your Majesties more than Heroical Ac∣complishments. And yet I have a more Obli∣ging and Personal Concernment: For as the Amplitude and Prosperousness of Your Ma∣jesties Dominions are chiefly maintained by Your Majesties Countenance upon the Mathe∣matical Arts, and especially of Navigation; so Your Majesty doth apparently excel all the Kings that ever were, in this Noble kind of Knowledge of the Naval Arts and Sciences. And for these, and many other good Reasons, I hold it my bounden duty to lay these Essays of my best Endeavours at Your Royal Feet; and with the Protestation of a tryed and trusty Sea-man, to avouch, That not only my best Skill in Arts, but my Heart and Life also, are entirely devo∣ted for Your Majesties Service: And all my fel∣low Sea-men, and all true-hearted Englishmen, do joyn in this one Voice, God save King Charles the Second.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
