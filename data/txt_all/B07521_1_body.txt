NOT to the vvorldling vvaltring in his vvealth,
Nor to the vsurer recounts his gaine:
Not to the sicke, vvhose thoght is on his health,
Nor to the insolent of lyfe prophane:
Not to the ignorant of brutish braine,
Nor to the stupide Stoick vvill I send thee:
Not to the learnde, vvhose knovvledge vvith disdaine
Will scorne the Poet that so lovvrdlie pende thee:
Not vnto babes, vvhose age cannot defend thee,
Nor siluer-seeking Minstrels for to sing:
Not vnto careles men, vvho vvhen they end thee,
Vnclosde vvill thee vvithin some vvindovv sling:
But to a Ladie svveet I vvill thee offer,
Who hauing reade thee, closlie vvill thee coffer.


THEN fairest faire, vvhose matchles maners mylde,
And hautie thoughts dimerites high affection:
Who might haue beene the mother of that Childe,
If any Gentile had beene in election.
But since it is (I speake it vvith correction)
Thou art no Ievv, but in the Ievv indented
By grace, loue, mercie and by free adoption
Of that great God our miserie preuented:
Then praise his Name the vvay so vvell inuented,
Praise thou the spirite that sanctified the birth,
Praise Iesus Christ so freelie that consented
To cloath his god-hoode vvith the filthie earth:
Praise all the three, they onely craue Peccaui,
Changde hopeles Eua in an happie Aue.
