Christian Friends,
THis Learned Piece was lately brought to my Hand by a Signal Providence,

in its Native French Dress. By the renewed perusal thereof; I found it to be very Sub∣stantial and Seasonable, which made me willing to render it more useful, by Publishing it in our Vulgar Habit. It hath been found to be of singular Service in its Native Country, and may be so among us like∣wise, through God's Blessing. Whilst so many Thousand of our Neighbours Houses are daily Fired, it's time for All to awake. The multiplied Persecutions of the Protestants in France, so causelesly renew∣ed of late, should rowze up all Christians round about them.

In such Infectious Times, a Choice ANTIDOTE should be valued and desired of All. Many Reasons might oblige me to recommend this Present to your View and Improve∣ment: The choice Ingredients thereof were very Skilfully Composed, and Faithfully Dis∣pensed by the Learned Au∣thor thereof. My Zealous Affections for all Your Pros∣perous Welfare, chiefly in Spirituals, and for the Com∣mon Interest of all Christi∣ans, have perswaded Me to this Publication, which I de∣sire cordially to commend to the Blessing of the Most

High, as becomes the Functi∣on and Relation of,
 Belfast, July 3. 1682.
