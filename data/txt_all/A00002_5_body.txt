LEast I be deem'd a thiefe, I will disclose;
I turn'd to Verse what you gaue me in Prose:
In so few lines I neuer yet did find
More heav'nly Comforts to a grieued mind:
Mans sinfull Heart, Hells Malice, Grace diuine,
Is intermixed so in ev'ry Line.
I praise God, I this speake with feeling Sense,
God grant the Reader like experience!
Good publish't, doth more good, by being knowne,
Wherein I seeke Gods glory, not mine owne:
Of Reading and of Writing's but one end,
Repent, beleeue, for sake Sinne and amend.

Your true vnfeigned Friend,
R. A.
