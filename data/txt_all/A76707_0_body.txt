Good Madam,
FOr though none can be said to be absolutely good, but God onely: Yet, I hope, it will not be denied, but that every true Chri∣stian may be said to be good so far forth, as he, or she hath attained un∣to
 the power of godlinesse. And if your Ladyship may not be ranked amongst the most Eminent in that way of Piety, and Evangelical Per∣fection: I am infinitely mistaken in mine accounts. I cannot affirme, that a long continued experience hath confirmed me in the knowledg of your most excellent indowments. But for me to say, that ever I did, (till within these few weeks) disco∣ver so much goodnesse in so little a time, were to sin against the multi∣tude of your merits, and the cogni∣sance of mine own conscience. Madam, I most humbly begge your Ladyships pardon for my trans∣gression against your much meek∣nesse, and humility: I finde you to
 be such a perfect enemy to pride, and adulation, that you cannot relish the sound of your own just commen∣dations, though but very sparingly expressed. Neverthelesse, being now (by Gods blessing, and your undeserved favour) become a Mem∣ber of your family: I dare not ex∣pose my self to the reproch, either of so much ignorance as not to be sensible of your manifold vertues, or of so much ingratitude as not to acknowledge them. I could hear∣tily wish, that there were any thing in these lines, or in any other of my more hopefull improvements, that might make the memory of your name immortal. But your owne illustrious qualifications have al∣ready
 supplied my defects, and pre∣vented my pains in that particular. Mine onely present Petition is; that you will be pleased to accept of this pattern of your own perfections; The right Heir to that eternal Co∣venant of Grace. Madam, if he may yet furter ingratiate me with your good Ladyship; my care shall be to continue my self
