TO you (Fathers and Brethren) I do upon good advice, dedi∣cate and devote these ensuing Treatises; partly, because of the Relation that I have had to both Houses, as having received the first elements of rational Learning in the one, and been admitted to an imployment of special trust in the other: and partly because the subject they treate of, was begun in the hea∣ring of most of you, and the enlargement of it into the bulke it now appears in, was un∣dertaken with the advice, and encourage∣ment of that never to be forgotten orna∣ment of his Colledge, and the whole Univer∣sity, Dr Reynolds, with whom I had the honour of acquaintance whiles he continued
 there, and of partnership in suffering, when he was removed thence.
I confesse, this piece, if it were to be judged by an University of the old stamp, hath not quaintnesse enough to expect any ap∣probation from so learned a Body. But (I hope, and partly, know) that very many of your heads and hearts are better acquaint∣ed with practical Divinity, then (I doubt) most of your predecessors were. And there∣fore, I cannot but thinke, that you will vouchsafe it a little roome (and it will not take up much) in your Libraries.

 practical Divinity among you, as that which hath more marrow and fatnesse in it, then all the quaint notions of your ancient School∣men, or the highest attainers of this wanton Age; and by way of prayer to God for you, that you may, by an usefull imployment of your parts, revenues, and opportunities, con∣fute, and put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, who wait for your haltings, observe your failings, and gape for the spoyles of your buildings and Revenues. That you may so doe, is, and shall be (by Gods assistance) part of the constant devotions of him, who is
