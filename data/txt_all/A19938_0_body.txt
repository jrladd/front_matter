Sir:
SInce I haue made bold alrea∣dy with your worship in of∣fering to present my labours vnto you, and finding your worship so kindly to receiue them, I haue heere in this small volume taken some paines in gathering these few instructi∣ons, and how soeuer they are, I wished them well. So presenting them to your worship, desiring you to depresse errors with my good meaning, loth to bee tedious vnto you in a trifle, I leaue you to the protection of the Almighty: praying vnto him to send you much health and happinesse. I rest.
