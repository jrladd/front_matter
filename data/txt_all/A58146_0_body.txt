Honorable, and Beloved,
IT cannot be denyed, but that our greatest happiness in this world is, That we have liberty to make pro∣vision for the world to come; yet ge∣nerally so unhappy are men, as that they little ponder upon their future Crown, and little consider of their present race; but either they vainly

mis-spend their time (to allude to the Roman Emperor) in gathering Coc∣kle shells, in heaping together the Mammon of unrighteousness; or in a more degenerous way, in a base drud∣gery for the lusts of the Flesh.
The Profession of Christianity la∣boreth under two Extreams; some pretend to an Anticipation or pre∣vention of Heaven, and would fain perswade us that there is no state of Glory after this life: These men, not∣withstanding their present Triumphs, are under great Temptations; and in a sober sense, are rather besides their wits, then above Gods Institutions.
Others charge the faithful Profes∣sors of Religion with usurpation against God, with Antedating the state of

Perfection, as if they did confound the distinction between the Church Trium∣phant and Militant: No, say they, Purity and Holiness are our aim on earth, but our possession onely in Hea∣ven: These Sensualists may learn, that the great change of man is made in this world, and onely confirmed in the next; the Tribunal Bar Regenerates no man, but publiquely and finally ac∣quitteth the Regenerate: Heaven must first enter into us, before we can enter into Heaven; though the perfection of Purity be onely in Heaven, yet the principle of Purity is to be had on Earth: He that dies a sinner, shall never rise a Saint: He that by the Love of the Brethren shoots not the gulf here, shall never pass from death

to life hereafter: He that hath not God to be his Lord now, shall never have the Lord to be his God. Wo be to that man that was born, and is bred, and shall be buried in sin, that goes out of this world in that condition that he came into the world with, happy had he been that he had never been born; happy, if when dead, he never should have had a resurrection, because he shall arise, not so much to be judged, as to be condemned.
Nothing is so much discoursed of as blessedness, yet nothing so little un∣derstood; some place it one thing some in another, yet both amiss; some men would be happy, but without communion with God, which is impossible: These

should know, That God hath not onely Mines of Brass, but Mines of Silver and Gold; and that though the enjoy∣ment of this world be not an Argu∣ment of Gods anger, yet its no argu∣ment of his peculiar love, and there∣fore we must take heed of valuing the good things of Gods foot-stool, above the good things of his Throne.
My work in this Sermon, hath been to give the world its due, both in its white and black sides: I have weighed the blessedness of this world and of the next, in the Balances of the Sanctu∣ary, and notwithstanding this world be pondrous in a providential sense, yet comparatively, by the verdict of God himself, it is found too light; to which

when you had given a patient hearing, you were pleased by your order to im∣portune its publication: I have satis∣fied your request, and my prayers to God are, That because it is a subject of the highest nature, that it may have the deeper Impression on your hearts: That as God hath lifted you up into the seat of Honor, so you may lift up that God with Thank∣fulness: That as you have publick Opportunities to do good, to re∣strain Prophanation, and discounte∣nance Error, so you may have hearts suitable to your Opportunities. That as God hath thrown into your laps the outward Happinesse of this World, so you may prize the Bene∣factor, and set a greater Estimate

on the light of his Countenance, the least beam whereof is worth ten thou∣sand Worlds.
