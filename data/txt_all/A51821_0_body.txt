Much Honoured Gentlemen,
YOU are but just Eas'd of your Stewardships, and have taken a greater Trouble upon you, of being Patrons to this Discourse; which I fear will hardly find so kind an Acceptance as you were pleased to bestow upon it: For it is seldom known, that Men love to find Bad Manners severely Tax'd, unless they
 themselves are in a good measure In∣nocent, or in a ready Disposition to be so.
I look'd upon my Text as an ad∣mirable Abridgment, of the purest Mora∣lity of the Antient Philosophers; and that St. Paul had an Eye to their Wri∣tings, seem'd very probable to me, by his making a particular mention of their Chief Subject, Virtue; and their most Celebrated Motive, Praise; this prevail'd with me to have some regard even to their Rules, in my Di∣rections about Manners; which I hope were not altogether improper for the Moderating the Jollities of a Shrove-Tuesday, though they were not severe enough to improve the Peni∣tential Sorrows of a Lent.

May your most Generous Designs prosper, your Christian Charity flou∣rish, your private Friendships increase, and your United Loyalty remain for ever firm: May you bring Honour
 to your Church, and to your Kingdom; and may you never want a Blessing and Success in your particular Im∣ployments: May you continue to Re∣spect your Clergy, as they are ever mindful of your Truest Interest: And may all our Enemies wonder at our Love, dread our Meekness, and imitate our Charity: Which is the hearty wish of
