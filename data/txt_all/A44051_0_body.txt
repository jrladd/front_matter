DEAR SIR,
BEsides the Obligation I have to you by Nature, your Goodnesse hath given you the greatest interest that may be in my Time and Studies; of which if I have made any improvement, it is purely the Product and Influence of your Favour: The sense hereof hath made me prefix your Name to this Endeavour of mine, upon no other design then to make a publick pro∣fession that my self and studies hold
of you as of the chief Lord. And if the pettinesse of what I tendr you here, be apt to disable the justice of mine acknowledgments, you can in∣form your self that a Rose or a pound of Cummin, hath often been all the Rent-service that hath been reserved upon Estates of no inconside∣rable value.
That, that I here present you with, is the Life of Sir Thomas More, one of the greatest Ornaments of the Law, a man of those high employments, and so great parts to go through them, that he can be no stranger to you, nor doubt of a kind reception, especially seeing you are of as eminent courtesie as parts. I shall not venture to give any fur∣ther
Character of him, or com∣mend him to you, but rather on the contrary expect that he will plead the boldness of my Dedication, and assure my self a favourable ac∣ceptance of my poor labours from his vast worth.
Sir I have dealt with him as his Nurse did, thrown him over the hedge into your Armes, lest his me∣mory should perish in the waters of Lethe: Or as some common Soul∣dier, who, if he have but common civility, finding some person of great quality lying amongst the dead bodies and ready to become one of them, will make a shift with a rude charity to lugger him out of the field, und think himself sufficiently
rewarded with the honour of pre∣serving his life: I, (as I travelled over the Memorials of the ancient Heroes) met with this worthy Knight breathing his last in the field of honour; and an ordinary sense of humanity ingaged me (though unworthy that office) to rescue him from oblivion; unhandsomely I confesse, but excusably, because I could no better, my weak capa∣city, in the very beginning of this enterprize, being overwhelmed with the plenty and copiousnesse of the subject.
I am confident, King Henry the Eighth was not so much his ene∣my, as to forbid posterity to think well of him; nor his Sentence, so
severe, as to condemne his Name as well as his Body, to an execu∣tion; his Name no more deserved to die, then my pen does to preserve it; yet (which affords me some com∣fort,) what the Reader wants in this Book, hee'l find in his Life: with which also (I hope) I have a good plea for the inconsiderablenesse of any thing, which I can offer in return of all those obligations you have been pleased to lay upon mee; which since I am never able to wipe off by strict and punctual satisfacti∣on, I presume your goodnesse will by a favourable acceptation hold me discharg'd in Chancery:
