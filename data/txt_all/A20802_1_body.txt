HAuing (Right Ho∣nourable) in the for∣mer booke treated of such publike and pri∣uate troubles, vexati∣ons, losses and cala∣mities that are common to Gods children with the wicked; and ha∣uing (according to my measure) sor∣ted out, and set downe such plaine

and compendious rules, directions, and consolations, as may seeme most fit and necessary; I haue in this se∣cond Booke propounded in order those doubts, distresses, griefes, scan∣dals, trials and afflictions, which did specially and properly concerne Gods Saints and seruants: (for ma∣ny are the troubles of the righteous, and the better Christian the more tried and afflicted) & I haue with∣all expressed and drawn out of Gods booke such certaine resolutions, vn∣doubted conclusions, and choice comforts, as (I hope) will giue good satisfaction and contentment to eue∣ry good Christian. And hoping that through Gods blessing this small worke may doe much good, I haue beene willing to make it com∣mon, and for many iust and waigh∣ty reasons me mouing, doe deuote and consecrate it to your Honours. For, first, your Honours being Pil∣lers in Gods house, and goodly

Cedars in the Lebanon of his Church militant, beare your parts in affli∣ction, and therefore the comforts do appertaine vnto you; you share in the conflicts, and why not in the conquests?
Secondly, this my discourse be∣ing a subiect and matter of religion and learning, who haue greater in∣terest in it, then such a noble Theo∣philus, & honourable Sunamite, who both doe so much fauour, further, and wish well to learning and god∣linesse?
Thirdly, in whom doe might and meekenesse, honour and hu∣mility, greatnesse and gratiousnes, more happily concur, then in your Honours?
Lastly, hauing receiued so many great and vndeserued fauours from your Honours, as the Roote, and from your noble ofspring, as the blessed branches; I could finde no

better meanes to manifest my hum∣ble dutie, and to testifie my thank∣full heart, then by dedicating, and commending these my labours to your patronages.
Vouchsafe therefore not onely to peruse my meditations, but also to approue them; that the Author may receiue the greater encourage∣mēt, & the fragrant perfume of your fauourable disposition, may more amply enlarge, and make knowne it selfe. But fearing to bee offen∣siue and tedious, and assuring my selfe of your Honourable accepta∣tion; I doe here most heartily sue and supplicate to God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, to blesse the bright Morning Starre, that Princely charge vnder your careful tuition, and herein to respect and reward your faithfull seruice, and watchfull attendance, to remem∣ber in goodnesse all your kind∣nes

shewed to his Church and chil∣drē, to continue you long in health, to encrease you in all grace and honour, and to replenish your hearts with all hope and comfort.
