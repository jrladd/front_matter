SIR,
THE Materials of this Book are derived from your Majesties undoubted Prerogative to the Mines (in your Dominions,) of which Me∣tals are made; Of them Moneys: And then honoured with your Majesties Superscription. And so by a Chri∣stian Circulation, the Possessors do, or ought to render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's.
Thus Your Majesty hath a double Right to the Mines, and to the Products of the Chimical Art, by which Metals are fitted for their Journey to Publick Commerce.
Herein I humbly offer my Endeavours to assist their motions, and onely to refresh your Majesties Memory, not to inform Your Knowledg: for (as 'tis hinted in the Title Page) Your Majesty is (in the Science of Chi∣mistry, as in all Sciences of Humanity) Nulli Secundus.
These Perfections are evident in Your Majesties publick and private Elaboratories, from which pure Ju∣stice, and pleasing Arts and Sciences are communica∣ted to Your Subjects.

In these I have observed Your Majesties particular respects to Chimistry (of an Ʋniversal Extent,) and thereupon I resolved to transplant this German Twig of L. Erckern (on that Subject) into Your Majesties Nur∣sery; and Humbly Dedicate it to Your Majesty, (with my Additionals) and also Humbly crave your Ac∣ceptance, as an encouragement to my further Progress in serving Your Majesty with more Fruits; but at pre∣sent it is to shew, That I am intent in promoting the Services I owe Your Majesty, as well with my seden∣tary Passive Pen, as before with my personal Active Duty, having (upon some significant occasions) had the Honour to be known to Your Majesty near Forty Years.
Now, Great Sir, Wherein I am incapacitated to ex∣press my Duty, for want of Ability of Mind or Body, or secular Fortunes; they shall be supplied by my con∣stant Prayers for Your Majesties Health, Happiness, and Serenity in Your Government, being
