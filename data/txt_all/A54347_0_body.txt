My Honoured Friends,
I Have been strongly induced by these following Reasons to present you with this unpolished Discourse.
First, To shew my thankfulness unto God for engaging of your Hearts, that have the great things of this World, to look after the great and good things of the World to come; for though not many mighty, and not many noble are called, yet it is a mercy that God hath made some great ones good ones, for the encourage∣ment of those that move in a lower Sphear.
A Second Reason that induced me to this boldness in prefixing your Names to this Work, was to give some Demonstration of my thankfulness to your selves for your kindness towards me when I was with you under much bodily weakness; and if a Heathen could say, That we need charge a Man with no greater Crime than In∣gratitude, it would look with an evil aspect in a Chri∣stian
especially a Minister, to be guilty thereof: For as Ingratitude towards God was the sin of the first Adam, so Ingratitude towards Man is a fruit of the Old Adam.
A Third Reason why I present you with this Dis∣course is, because of that favourable acceptance that it found when you had it in your Ears, which encourages me to hope, that it will find the same acceptance with you when you have it in your Eyes.
A Fourth Reason why I have prefixed your Names to this Work is, because I would encourage others to imitate you, in owning the ways of God, as you did in the worst of times, and in the greatest of Dangers, when none could so depart from Iniquity as to follow the Lord fully, but they made themselves a Prey to Diabolical Informers.
The Last Reason I shall give of this Attempt, in presenting you with this Demonstration of my thank∣fulness to God and your selves, is, because I have no better thing to present you with; for the truth is, the Subject is glorious, and that which is rarely treated on; for had I seen this Work managed by abler Pens, this Work had never come abroad to the World.
But now it is published, it is the earnest desire of my Soul, that the Lord will be pleased to make it service∣able to your selves, and to all that will be pleased to give it the Reading.
Now the Blessing of the Great God, Father, Son and Spirit, abide in and upon your Souls and Bodies, with your Off-Spring; which is and shall be the hearty Prayers of him who is
