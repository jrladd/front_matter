MADAME, when I remember the manie obligations which I owe to your manifold merits, I oftenâˆ£times accuse my selfe to my self, of forgetfulnes, and yet I am to be excused: for how can I satisfie so infinit a debt, since whilst I go to disengage my self in some measure, by giuing you the patronage of these vnpolished lines (which indeed to their manie errors, had need of a respected Sanctuary) I but engage my self further, while as you take the patronage of so vnpolished lines. Yet this shall not discourage me, for alwayes I carie this aduantage, that as they were the fruits of beautie, so shal they be sacrificed as oblations to beautie. And to a beautie, though of it selfe most happie, yet more happie in this, that it is thought worthie (and can be no more then worthy) to be the outward couer
of so many inward perfections. So assuring my selfe, that as no darknesse can abide before the Sunne, so no deformitie can be found in those papers, ouer which your eyes haue once shined. I rest
