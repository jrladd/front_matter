Truly Honour'd Sir;
THis Sermon is not becme less Yours for becoming so much Anothers: Nor will that Honourable Person grudg You a part in the Dedication from whom the whole had its Rise. Its appearance in another Dress, doth no more vary the Case, than a Servants changing his cloathes changeth his Relation to his Master.
You have in your single Hand a two-fold POSSE both Civil and Military of this County; an Interest in it above both; and I think for your time above any Gentlemans of your Rank in any County of England. You have received all from the Supreme Lord, and must render an account of all to the Supreme Judg held forth in this Sermon. Which that you may doe with Joy, and not with Grief, when judg'd by the Law of Liberty, is the Prayer of
Truly Honour'd Sir;
