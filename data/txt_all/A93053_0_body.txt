THo' it is our great Calamity to live in a most corrupt Age, Yet by the Influence of the All-wise, and All powerful God, (who can derive good out of Evil) you are so Prudent, as to make an Advantage of it: and to raise the value of your Vertue, and to add to the Lustre and Worth of your Reputation and Family, by being untainted in the midst of most dangerous Temp∣tations.
SIR, I might tell the World, that the following Lines were drawn as a faint Copy from the fair Original which you give, and that the ensuing Precepts are taken from your Pattern: But lest I should call up the Blood into your Cheeks by offering Violence to your singular Modesty, or throw my self under the Suspicion of Flattery, I will convert my just Praises of you, into earnest Prayers for you, that that good God who hath hitherto pre∣serv'd
 you, would still preserve you, that you may go on by an Ʋnspotted Life still to glorify him; and by your most agreeable Temper, to win over others to Piety and Vertue: and to answer the Care and Kind∣ness of that Learned and Worthy Person, by whom your tender Mind was inform'd, and your early Manners cultivated; from whom (in your Minority) I receiv'd the largest share of what I have; and so stand perpetually oblig'd to return the most grateful Acknowledgment. And lastly, That you may grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, un∣til you come to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This is the earnest Prayer of, Sir,
