My LORD,
THE incomparable Good∣ness and Affability your Lordship useth towards all, not
excepting the meanest Persons, encourageth me humbly to lay at your Lordship's Feet, this plain Practical Discourse, which as I have had the comfort to under∣stand that they were edified, who heard it, so I hope it may be of farther use, when more leisurely considered, and perhaps may serve to give the common sort of People a clearer and more distinct No∣tion than they usually have, of their indispensable Duty, and of that wise and holy Religion which they profess.
The zeal of doing something towards this, before I die, ac∣cording to my little Sphere, made me desirous to leave this Discourse with my Parishioners. It would be indeed an unspeakable satisfa∣ction to me, if it prove any ad∣vantage
to them; but chiefly, if your Lordship might condescend so far as to accept it, as a Token of my most humble and hearty Gratitude (instead of what I should, but am not able to per∣form) for the great and many Obligations laid upon my Relati∣ons, and my self in particular, for which we shall ever stand in∣debted to your Lordship.
My Lord,
Your Lordship, and all the World knows it very well, hath not only been ready upon all Oc∣casions to assert and maintain, even with the most eminent dan∣ger of your Life, your Country's most admirable Laws and Refor∣mation; but has been a common Father to all the Persecuted of
France, who were forc'd to flee from their Native Country.
How many Souls can declare to the World, and shall testifie at the Great Day, before our blessed Lord and his holy Angels, to your Lordship's immortal Glory, that they have tasted of no other Bread in this their Distress, but that which your Lordship did put into their hands! There my Fa∣ther will stand, with his Family, in the fore-front of that vast multitude of the Witnesses of your Lordship's unbounded Charity; and we shall thereby convince the World, that Christianity was not then lost among Men.

In the mean while, my Lord, I submit my self wholly, and this little Treatise, to your Lordship, assuring your Lordship it is meant candidly, and purely for God's Glory, and the Salvation of Souls, proceeding from a sincerely peni∣tent Heart, having studied no∣thing so much as this Subject, these several Years, in which I have so often been in a state of dy∣ing.
I shall add no more, but this, That the chiefest Blessing I shall always ask of GOD; and my chiefest Happiness the remainder of my Life, will be to see God's Glory further'd, and your Noble House, my Lord, and Yourself in particular, prosper and flou∣rish, to the Honour and Felicity of this Church and Nation.

I humbly beg your Lordship's Blessing. I am,
My LORD,
