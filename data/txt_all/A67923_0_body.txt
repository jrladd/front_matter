FAMOVS sir, I promised to shevv you the vvays of our favth largely, vvhen the King of Scotland should be King of En∣gland. The day is come, and vvhat I longed for I haue seene. And novv I vvil declare in print what I did before in vvriting. And I vvil beginn from the house of Dauid, and the Chronicle For herein the heart of the most is deceyved and wandereth. Aftervvards (if God wil,) I vvil shevv the joynctes of al the holy Bible, and the super∣fluity of the Thalmud. God giue you knowledge for Dauids house: where the sonnes of Salo∣mon fayle: and vvhere the seede of Nathan his brother doth come heye to the Kingdome. In Iechonias Solomons seede fayleth: according to the vvord of the Eternall, by Ieremy both of Ie∣hoiachim and Iechonias, of Iehoiakim thus spea∣keth God. He shall haue none to sitt vppon the throne of Dauid▪ And of Iehoiachin thus sayth the Eternall: O earth earth, earth heare the vvord of the Eternal▪ vvrite this man childles: a man that shall not prosper in his dayes. For none shall euer prosper of his seede: to sitt vppon the throne of Dauid; and to rule in Iudah; This is the oath of God vvhich is neuer called back by no repentance: as the repentance of Moses could not call back Gods oath for his going into the land of Chanan
