SIR,
THere is two things I have alwayes had a great ab∣horrance for, Idleness and Ingratitude, the desire I had to avoid both which hath been the occasion of affixing your Name to this Book, which is a Treatise so use∣ful, both as to its Subject, and the me∣thod of the Diseourse upon it, that it

gave me the Confidence to think it wor∣thy your acceptance, and the rather because it is not onely the first Tract that I have hitherto met with, writ purposely upon this peculiar Plant, but also the Author hath delivered what he had to say upon it under such curious, and Excellent heads, That I cannot but give it this just Character▪ That it is both a learned and accurate work, so that it may deservedly be called Co∣chlearia Curiosa. And this I may do without the censure of being partial, since I pretend no further Interest in the thing, than the having put it into English, that those Country men of mine, which are unacquainted with the La∣tine Tongue, might reap the benefit of it. This advantage I received from the doing of it, that it diverted me from some melancholly thoughts; and I employed those hours of vacancy from business, that I could spare from the so∣licitation of my affairs of neerest con∣cern, which were lately incumbant upon me. Having thus redeemed some hours from the imputation of being idle∣ly spent, I began to consider if there were not yet a further improvement to be

made upon this occasion, and reflecting upon the long friendship you have honor∣ed me with, and the frequent favours you have conferred upon me, my present state of Affairs, not permitting me to make any suitable return, I resolved at least to shew my self not insensible of your favours, and therefore took this oppor∣tunity of making a publick acknowledg∣ment of them desiring you would except of this as a testimony of my gratitude, till I am so happy to give you further evi∣dences of my desires to approve my self,
