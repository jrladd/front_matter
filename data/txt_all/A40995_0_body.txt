THis Sermon (Worthy Sirs) is Dedicated to you, because Preach∣ed by your appoyntment, and now published, through the importu∣nity of many of you, who heard it; It was neither ability in the Au∣thor, nor choysenesse in the Work, that caused this Sermon to take so well among so many of you, but the sutablenesse of the Subject, to the present times, and it may be, the familiar plainenesse of the Sermon did worke much with some; (Ferrum potest quod Aurum non potest) Iron may doe that which Gold cannot doe; A blunt Sermon may, by Gods bles∣sing, worke more upon the hearts of the hearers, than that which is more acute, and in it selfe more excel∣lent, as for other reasons, so from the nature of the thing, because most sutable to the most of hearers; that

which the understanding doth not reach, cannot take the affections.
The Authour studyed not to please, but to profit; he prepared and delivered this plaine Sermon, with a heart bleeding for the present troubles of our Israel, and breathing after the publique peace, and common good, as the spirit of the whole Sermon shewes; and he doth confesse that no importunity should have pre∣vailed with him, to have given it this (unthought of) second birth, had he not beene withall prest unto it, by his owne perswasion, that that which was accepted be∣ing heard, may, being published, doe good to many who heard it not. Some little is added in a place or two, which was prepared, but, through want of time, was omitted in the delivery; What ever it is (Worthy Sirs) it is yours, if you please to owne it, and so is the Authour of it yours, who desires to be reckoned a∣mong those who respect and honour you, and pray for you, and acknowledgeth himselfe your debtor, for ma∣ny favours, and rests
