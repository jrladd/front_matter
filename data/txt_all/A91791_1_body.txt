GOD hath in his wisdome
and love mixed crosses with
comforts, and comforts
with crosses; He hath said;
In the world yee shall have trouble, but in
me yee shall have peace; peace in trouble
is a sweet mercy; behold a fountaine
of joy and rest, sufficient to satisfie the
soule at all times, which ever floweth
full of sweetnesse and life, to refresh
our soules withall at all times.
Loving friends, the love you have
manifested to me, its so great, so free,

and full, and undeserved, and unex∣pected:
the more I view it, the more I
see God in it, and the more sweet it
is to me; I have cause to be affected
with it, with great thankfulnesse to
you, and to God for you, in that he
hath ordered you to be so sweet a
mercy to me; I trust he will take the
kindnesse you have shewed to me, as
done to himselfe, Mat. 25. 40. I know
not how to require your love, I can∣not
doe more nor lesse, then to pre∣sent
you with the best I have, as a
testimony of my sincere and hearty
thankfulnesse to you for the favour
and kindnesse I have received by you,
not doubting but these spirituall and
divine Consolations, will be savoury
and acceptable to you. The Lord
blesse you, and keepe you from all e∣vill:
so he prays that remaines
