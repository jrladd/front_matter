My Lords;
THis Piece directs it self into your hands, for without a greater pre∣sumption it could not pass them.

 Your Noble Families, were the resplendent Triones that accompanied the Devex of Charles his Wain, his Mor∣ning and Evening attendants, that portended and extended his Declination, (for in two of them He suffered beyond His own Fate) being plunged with Him in the depths of the same Red Sea, and are now risen again in a full and most radient lustre.
They were that Constellati∣on, that directed three wan∣dring Kingdoms into their way of Loyalty, and pointed out the due veneration to the King their Redeemer.

 It was their all-powerful Influence of Duty and Obedi∣ence that hath serened these Times. The dark Obscurity of that Cloud that hid them in their death, soon revealed it self in Glory. This storm which tempested these Kingdoms, being laid by their Bloud, which was poured out like water in the streets, hath brought again our Halcyon dayes, and turned our Miseries into Jubilees.
This is the supererrogated Merit, of your Illustrious Pa∣rents, whom this Age and Po∣sterity shall reverence and ad∣mire; That your Lordships may surmount their Vertues,
as well as their difficulties, as you have exceeded their Titles; that you may, as the Branches of those Vines, which being made to bleed, produce more generous and abundant Fruits, that you may be the delight and Joy of these Nations, and flourish for ever, is, and shall be the inces∣sant prayers of,
My Lords,
