I Am bolde, (beloved, and much respec∣ted in the Lord) to send this demonstra∣tion of my dearest affection after you; not, that that I account it any competent recompence, but that you will (as I hope) receive it as some greatfull remembrance of those your greater favours, which you have soe kindely communicated vnto me. Some taste hereof, you had while I was soe happy as to speake (now and then) in your hearing, and because that was but a taste, (yet well savoured of such as heard the same) I could not deny, or discourage, the Christian desire of any, who were affected to feede more fully therevpon, It was the last message that I delivered among you from God; and therefore, inasmuch as you were vpon your jmmediate remoovall, to attayne a more happy cour∣se of commerce with men, I thought it my part and du∣ty (therein) to doe my best, for the furtherance of your most happy traffike with the Lord; that you
might (if by  possibility, I might helpe) be prosperous both in heaven and earth at once, and grow abundant∣ly rich, in body temporally, and in soule, and body, eternally together. And God, who is Lord over all, and rich vnto all, grant, that you may enjoy this double blessednes, to the greatest prayse of his most glorious name, and the everlasting peace, and welfare, of your owne harts, and states, for ever before him. To his gra∣ce and loue, I commend you all for ever; and to you all, (and to your loue,) I commend this my poore en∣deavour; nothing doubting, (yet earnestly desiring,) your kinde acceptance of the same, from him, who re∣solveth ever to remayne.

From my house in Flushing. March. 26. 1622.
