IF it may please you to Suruey,
These Lines with th'eyes of Grace,
You'll not repent, for surely they
Doe Ayme at Glories Place.
They are your Owne; I did intend
When I was great with yong
Of these Conceptions, some great Friend
Should Patronage my Song.
And may with Honour, Sacred things
Can nere be lodg'd too well;
Gods holy Truth in brests of Kings
Beseemeth best to dwell.
Most Vertuous Noble Lady, I
Haue (from your Bounty) wing,

And whilst my Muse hath power to fly,
Some holy Offering
She will preferre, The Body may
Wi h all her parts agree
To rule the minde; but I dare say,
The Soule can neuer bee
Contain'd in such base limits. No!
It aymes at better things,
And cannot rest vntill it know,
That Campe where's none but Kings.
Great and Good Lady, hold your Hand,
And to requite your paynes,
You shall more true Ioy vnderstand,
Then all the world containes.
Peruse this well, and if it doth
Your inward Thoughts aduance,
Giue God the Praise and Honour both,
And mee your Countenance.
