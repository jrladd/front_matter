My LORD,
I Know not to whom I could more properly Dedicate a Trea∣tise of this Nature, than to your Lordship, who lately was Lord Chief Justice of England, and have set such re∣markable Copies to inferiour Magistrates. What is here offer∣ed may serve as a Mirrour, in which future Administrators of publick Justice would do well to look; for you may remem∣ber, my Lord, (if your Lordships present Afflictions have not made you forget as much Law as you ever learnt) Com∣mon Law runs much upon Presidents: And if a Man hap∣pen to have none of the best Physiognomies, there is no rea∣son why he should streight grow angry, and fling stones, to break all the Looking-glasses he meets with, only because they repre∣sent the true Figure of the Object.
My Lord, The following Treatise is a true Account of your Lordships Life and Actions, (most of which are ready to be attested upon Oath) of your unheard of Cruelties and barba∣rous Proceedings in your whole Western Circuit: In which all may see at what dear rates our Western Martyrs pur∣chased this religion, and how that it cost those glorious Suffer∣ers that so lately went off the stage (under your Lordships Sen∣tence) both Whippings and cruel Imprisonments, and the most exquisite Tortures which none could invent or inflict but your

Lordship, (who is suppos'd by all to have an Heart of marble, and Entrails of brass) nor any endure but they whose gal∣lant and noble Souls were born up with heavenly Cordials, and a Power from on high. But my Lord, rest assured, that their Blood still cryes for Vengeance, and will be a lasting mo∣nument of your Lordships Cruelties, whilst History can speak or transmit to incredulous Posterity the remarkables of elap∣sed Ages; for Hang, Draw and Quarter, and Try Men af∣terwards, (Witness Sir Thomas Armstrong's Death, &c.) has been your peculiar Talent. But your Lordship will now at last do well to remember that King Alfred caused forty four Judges in one year to be Hang'd as Murderers, for their false Judgments.
I hope your Lordship will pardon this present Address, seeing 'tis a Priviledge we modern Authors hold by prescrip∣tion, to put any great Body's Name in the front of our Book: Princes have not been able to exempt themselves or their Families from the Persecution of Dedications; nor ever was there (I humbly conceive) any Rule made in your Lord∣ships Court to forbid them.
Suffer then, I beseech your Lordship, this Address to re∣main a Monument to Posterity, of the sentiments this Age has of your Lordships Conduct and Merits; and Witness to all the World how much its Author is
