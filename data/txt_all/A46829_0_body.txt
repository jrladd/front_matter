My dear Country-men,
GEntle or Simple, for I make no distinction, I hate all ill Language, I detest the Name of Mob, and say, it ought not to be given to any of our People, but they rather call'd the Honest Jolly-Commons of England; 'tis they that venture their Lives (in the greatest Numbers) for the Honour and Safety of their Country, both by Sea and Land, and therefore deserve better Ʋsage at our hands: 'Tis they that have shew'd themselves wiser by much than they were thought to be, in their entire Deference to the Government, and peaceful Demeanour during the Stop of Trade and Damp of Business, occasion'd by the great quantity of bad Money among us, which when in Motion was the only current Coin, all the Broad and Mill'd, that was left unclip'd or unmelted, having in the Revolution of a few Moons disappear'd and (Spirit-like) vanish'd quite out of our sight, having been hoarded by many People, (and tho the small Sums of Money which usually lie in the Hands of hired Servants, (of both Sexes) seem inconsiderable in its Quan∣tity, yet those many petty Sums added make one great One, and all of the best Coin laid by) which will now not only peep out, but come chearfully abroad in this Fair-weather of Incouragement, of five per Cent. by our Wise Senate, to the great Comfort of us all, more espe∣cially at this Juncture.
Country-men, I here present you with some curious Remarks; 'tis for your sakes I have collected and digested them, by these you
 may see what Fools our Enemies (External and Internal) are, to flatter themselves, and their Admirers, with the false Hopes of our Ruin and Destruction being near at hand; henceforward they will learn to be wiser, and give over their silly and succesless Attempts, and court our Friendship, seeing that we have so happily got over, and surmounted those Difficulties and Dangers that seem'd to sur∣round and threaten us with a Back-blow, baneful in its Effects: But Thanks to God, to our King, and to our vigilant and diligent Dyet, (the Great Council of the Kingdom) we have happily escap'd the Snare, and prevented the Evil.
The French abroad, the Papists and Jacks at home, are in League against us, therefore let us unite and strengthen the Hands of the Government, that the King may support this Glorious Alliance that is now on foot in Europe, to destroy the Gallique Monster, and bring down his Pride, by abating his Power, and binding his Hands; which 'twould be almost impossible to effect, (as his Majesty tells us) without the Concurrence of the Power and Valour of the English Na∣tion, not so contemptible in the Eyes of the World, as in the Opinion of some Fools amongst us, who desire our Destruction, and rejoice at our Misfortunes, as if they shou'd fare better than the rest, or escape a general Calamity. These are the Fools that are continually railing against, and damning the Dutch, though I think they have more reason to bless 'em, that is, to speak well of 'em; for sure I am, except the English and they were hearty in the Cause, and faithful to each other in the prosecution of it, I mean, in carrying on this pre∣sent War, by maintaining each the greatest Force that ever was heard of or seen in these parts of the World, or in the Mediterranean either, the common Enemy of Christendom (who with more justice may be call'd so than the Great Turk, tho now Brethren in Iniquity, being in strict League to subvert the Religion taught and establish'd by Jesus Christ) wou'd long since have prevail'd and overrun all Europe; even Italy, the Terrestrial Paradise, the Favorite of Na∣ture, could not have escap'd filling into his Hands, those all devour∣ing Claws of his would have clasp'd and grasp'd all; those Plains of Pleasure, as full of Sweets and Odoriferous Plants as they are, must
 now have been yielding him some fine Nosegays; the Soveraign Pon∣tiff himself must have truckled, and have been glad if he should have been permitted to exchange only the Great Title of Pope, for the Lesser of Patriarch.
Our unmannerly and unreasonable Murmurers at Home, are ever grumbling and repining; what foolish Lies and false Stories are they continually inventing, and spreading amongst the Weak and Ʋn∣wary! the Innocent and the Ignorant are caught, and for a Time deceiv'd by, and impos'd upon, through the sly and base Insinuations of these Cacofuego's; but soon dispossess'd by having a true State of Af∣fairs laid before them. Amongst other their ridiculous Falsities they have broach'd, there is one flew and run like a Train, viz. That the Dutch clipp'd our Money in their open Streets, at their very Doors, and then sent it over to us again ready cast, and with very coarse Allay; and this was greedily embraced and entertain'd by the silly and the soft: nay some are so thick-scull'd, that having once let it into their Heads, they cann't get it out, but believe it still; as if we had not Rogues enough amongst our selves to clip and de∣base our Coin, without the Assistance of our Neighbours: I think eve∣ry Session's-Paper from the Old-Baily, presents us with a pretty hand∣some List of those Sparks that are taken, convicted, and hang'd at Ti∣burn, besides those in other Counties, (that have for many Years past made a great Trade of it) of which we seldom hear one word.
Others again are such Bubbles to say, that the Dutch get and grow Rich by this War; and so they do over the left Shoulder: Whereas on t'other side, 'tis but little short of a Miracle that they have not been ruin'd before now; so small a State, and such a handful of Peo∣ple to maintain so vast an Army, and so considerable a Fleet, (besides the Nourishment they give to some feeble Members of the Ʋnion, without which they could no longer subsist) for so many Years toge∣ther, without flagging or giving way, rather continually encreasing, and bringing better and more numerous Troops into the Field, to beard the Bear, and support their poor Allie Don Pedro with his Whiskers, who had long since become a Prey to his treacherous Neigh∣bour, (the French) if this new Common-Wealth (once a Bough of
 that same huge Tree) had not protected and preserv'd the Remain∣der of those poor Provinces.
Besides, at this Juncture 'tis impolitick to rail against the Dutch, who are our Friends and Allies, in strict League with us: our All (on both Sides) is at Stake; therefore it behoves us to use them well as they do us; for if either should make a separate Peace, the other's undone. If the Dutch are too cunning in Commerce for us, 'tis our Misfortune, not their Fault; it may be they employ Heads fitter for Negotiations of that kind, and apply themselves more heartily to it, or may have some Advantages we have not: be it so, or otherwise, we ought to look after our own Interest in Trade, and improve and secure it as well as we can, against the Dutch and Scots too, who have (both) been undermining us, one formerly, t'other lately, and we must countermine them, and so prevent the doing us any Prejudice; but don't let us quarrel with Either at this unhappy Crisis, but go hand in hand to reduce Lewis, and strip him of his borrow'd (or rather stolen) Plumes; and when we shall be disengag'd from this War, let us endeavour calmly to accommodate that Matter.
These angry Gentlemen that are perpetually blowing up the Coals of Dissention, and would fain set us together by the Ears, pretend at the same time to be English-men, which I can never believe; for if they were so, they would espouse the true Interest of their Native Coun∣try, in opposition to all others, and not cry up the French King and his Despotick Government, and find fault with every thing at Home, com∣plaining of ill Conduct upon all Occasions, and shew themselves uneasy at the good Fortune and Success we have, and pleas'd with the Los∣ses and Disadvantages we meet with, in a War attended with Casu∣alties and Changes; I say, if these are English-men, God deliver us from them, I wish they'd all go to France, and try how pleasant it is to live in a Country where Popery and Arbitrary Government, Fop∣pery and Slavery are in the Ascendent: a little taste of and trial in these, would make them have a truer Relish of their own Religion and Constitution, (both the best temper'd in the Ʋniverse) and be more and more in love with them, and so cease all their foolish and unrea∣sonable Murmurings.
