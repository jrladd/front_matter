I shall say nothing of that Lofti∣ness of Fancy, Solidness o Judgment, Elegancy o Speech, or those other Fa∣culties of the Mind, which are the Subject Matter of this Treatise, and which I have always observ'd in you, but leave it to an im∣partial

Judge, and one who is not byass'd with that strong and natural Affection, which obliges me to subscribe my self,
