May it please your Grace,
THe Art of War being that to which all great Men should apply their Studies (as the most Heroick Profession, to which Your Grace hath de∣dicated Your thoughts:) This Essay (be∣sides that it hath the Honour to be born in Your Service) may justly claim Your Prote∣ction; and the rather, because in it there is an Image of a Brave Young Heroe, whose Vertue so far out-strip'd the Deliberate Pro∣motions of his Countrey, that He ascended to the Highest Dignities by Dispensations
of the Roman Laws, not sought by his Ambition; but voluntarily indulged to his Worth: all which he obtain'd, not so much by his Birth (though of the most Noble) as by an early application of Himself to the Study of what a Great Man should do, and bringing into practice what he had studied. And he was happy in this, that his Em∣ployments seemed to be conferred on Him, rather by Necessity than choice, He appear∣ing rather the Sanctuary, than Servant of his Countrey, by securing them from the Fears of Carthage and Numantia. Ipre∣sent Him to Your Grace, in little and a rough Draught, leaving Him to some bet∣ter Hand to finish; hoping Your Grace will more regard my desire, than my Art to ex∣press my self
