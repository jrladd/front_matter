Right Honourable,
IT is meet that to you above all others in the Land, next to those that have entrusted you, I should present this following dis∣course and testimony; by which may ap∣pear in part, what the Gospel is, of which men talk so much, and know so little in these times: as likewise what ado and trouble ariseth in the World from men of corrupt minds, concerning it, to whom it must needs be (it could not be the Gospel else) so great a Rock of offence, that they would (whether Jew or
For as Luther saith, the spirit of both re∣maineth in oppositi∣on to the Gospel e∣ven till now. Gentile, that believe not) that any other thing should be, then it, allowed, and found among men; for as much as it doth detect, not only other, but the most hidden and secret evils, are either in the heart and life of men; so that they hate it, no otherwise then doth the Malefactor the Judge, when he comes not only to discover, but to give judgment on him; where∣fore most honourable men, you and the power entrust∣ing you, will find it no easie, yea a scarce possible thing, to secure it from the reproach and violence of e∣vil men, as hath been evident from the beginning, e∣ven
till now: I shall only crave leave humbly thus much to beg of you, in this your so great undertake∣ment, that in the things of this nature, as well, and more then others, you rather in your hearts consult with God, then man, least there be of men introduced another Gospel, then that which is indeed the power of God unto salvation; wherefore unless you have been in some measure on the Mount with God, as Moses and Jesus was, I know not how possible you will, or can be able to determine of things of so divine and hidden nature; if yet indeed you have not hereunto attained, without all peradventure, you will find, and the State entrust∣ing you, that your attaining this, but to a willing mind, that no violence be used of one Neighbor, or man, against another, as touching these things, is the best, and most ex∣cellent attainment hath yet been in the Land, since it was first called Christian; for you shall find by this discourse, what violence would soon be used against the truth, as it is in Jesus, unless either it be repeld by force of humane power, or more Divinely overcome, by the patient love and meekness of them, with whom is the Lamb Christ Jesus, as their head and guide, to whom I beseech God you may be willing (with others) to sub∣mit yourselves, Amen.
