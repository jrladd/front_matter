RIght worshipfull: I have been very bold,
My mind to you though rashly to unfold,
At this time, since I meane no more to write,
Such fruitlesse lines, to come unto your sight:
I'm bold to use a learned Poets skill;
(Though farre unfit for my unlearned quill)

Onely to manifest my thankfull hart:
For what God, by you, on me, doth impart.
Therefore I pray; accept this little Booke,
Yet I acknowledge, tis not worth your looke;
Because tis framed by unskilfull wit,
And yet againe, the matter that's in it,
Would crave inspection of iudicious eyes:
But that my infant Muse, could not devise
To frame, compose, and write, such learned Rimes
As fit your worth (in these most curious times)
And sacred things, which I here take in hand
To illustrate; which well to understand,
Declare, and (fully) to describe the same,
Would 'maze the head, of the most learned Braine.
Then how can I, that am in wit so bare,
In any wise, such holy things declare?
Yet what the learned, from Gods word have showne,
I have presumed, herein to make knowne;
To manifest, how I spend my spare time
In Poetry, although by ragged Rime.
Therefore, because I know you onely are
My dearest friend and have of me great care,
I here present you this my little skill,
Full of Affection, voyd of smallest ill;
And if you please, to read it to the end
I hope it shall not justly you offend;
For at the first, when I began to write,
I did compose it for mine owne delight;
But when I read it I therein did see,
A little spark of sacred Poetry,
Also, I have observ'd, you doe of late,
Delight to read, more then in former state.
This did induce me to become so bold,
My Talent in your lap thus to unfold,

Prayi g your Worship herein to passe by
The faults I doe commit unwittingly:
For Gods great aid herein, I'll render prayse,
And of your courteous Candor rest alwayes,
