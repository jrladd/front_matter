WHo-euer shall a vertuous mind imbrace,
Present renowne, and glory shall him grace
Long after life: as in these Worthies nine
It doth appeare. For they long since are dead;
Their Vertues liue, in Chronicles they shine,
Their Corps consum'd to dust: yea euen the Lead,
That clos'd their earthly bodies in the graue,
Can not be seene; no signe thereof we haue.
Their names, nor fames, their deeds will neuer die:
Their Acts (their Monuments) their worthy praise;
These registred, doe liue perpetually:
There is no end or period of their dayes.
Liue so, Great Britaines Prince, as they haue donne,
Ninth Worthy, hopeful HENRY, great Kings Sonne.
