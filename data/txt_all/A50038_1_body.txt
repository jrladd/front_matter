My Lords and Gentlemen,
THERE are particular Spirits in Mankind which soar above the com∣mon

Level: Hence it is, that true Pa∣trons of Learning and Honour, have such an Influence over those who move in a lower Orb, that they are enabled by that borrow∣ed Lustre, to dart such Reflections, as raise some Sort of Men to that Pitch of Thought, that can allure them to the Perusal of a Book.
So little, indeed, by a great many is Learning esteem'd, and a Publick Good en∣couraged, that an Author like an Ass in the Indies, may be overloaden with Trea∣sure; but the Brambles in his tedious Fati∣gues, are frequently his Recompence: The Poets, how unhappy soever they may have been upon other Accounts, have had their Moecenas's in all Ages, to guard them from the Fury of the Criticks; while the Philo∣sopher,

generally like Truth, the Object of his Intentions and Discourse, comes into the World naked: It's only his Innocence and In∣tegrity that skreens him from their Malevo∣lent Censures; but to add Lustre and Ener∣gy to his Performances, is to derive it from the Patronage of the Great, which gives to 'em (if the Metaphor be not too uncouth) a kind of Perpetual Living.
Since therefore, so many Noble Perso∣nages and Worthy Gentlemen, have been pleased so far to incourage this Underta∣king, by honouring both it and me with your Generous Subscriptions; I hope you will pardon this in me, who cannot but now, and ever shall acknowledge it with the deepest

Sense of Gratitude, and remain with the Profoundest Respest,
My Lords and Gentlemen,
