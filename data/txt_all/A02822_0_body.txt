MADAM,
You haue heere a kings Daughter, a chast Wife, a holy Widow, a glorious Saint. Great in birth, to illustrat vertue. A Mir∣rour in wedlock, of coniugall per∣fection. A President in Widow∣hood, for chast retirement. And a Queen for sanctity, now crowned in Heauen. You haue also heere a fayre & goodly Microcosme, with its foure dimensions. Altitude in the height of the extraction; Pro∣fundity in the depth of humility; Latitude in the capaciousnes the∣reof;

And Longitude, in a patient lōganimity. In the East, of this litle World, the Sun arising, displayes the beames of royalty & princely Maiesty. In the South, mounting the Meridian line of her life, t darts forth rayes of piety, with a heat, & feruour of deuotiō. In the North it endures an Ecclipse, as it were, ouercast with cloudes, & stor∣mes of affliction. And finally in the West, the Sun setts to a tempo∣rall life, to rise againe with radiāt beames, to an eternity of glory. Would you know the Spring, you find it in her birth; vertue bud∣ding forth with innocence of life; if the Summer;) You may behold her deckt with her greener fruits.

For the winter, the season if you note it well; you shall perceiue her couered all with frosts of sharpe aduersities. But if you cōtemplate, the Autumne of her Haruest, ima∣gin you see her now enioying her hundred fold. Where, shee in Hea∣uen, amongst the rest, is your Ad∣uocat; you therefore in Earth (I hope), and Deigne, to patronize her tablet heer, this litle booke, an abstract of her life, a true Epitome of her greatnes, and some man∣ner of testimony of his gratitude, o your Ladyship; who must & uer shall demayne.
