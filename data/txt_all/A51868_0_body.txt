Right Honourable,
THis Critical Age, visibly disco∣vers, to what disadvantage I must thrust this poor Play into the world; so that I am forc't to lay hold on discetion (the great∣est part of valour) for my defence. For although I well know they may finde fault with my wit, I am sure they can not condemn my judgment in (humbly) chusing your Honours Patrons to these poor (friendless) Sicilians, which when sheltered under your wings, will (though not from malice) yet be free (in mercy to themselves) from their venting it. Right Honourable, it is onely your pardons I beg, which (out of that propensity to goodness, which is natural in you) I doubt not of; as of your encouragement to enable me more ser∣viceable in a larger manner, to confirm, that I must live, and dye your honours most humble and most faithful servant.
