YOur courtesies (wor∣shipful) inexpected, haue brought me very farre in arrerage with you, and I haue thought the time ouer long, vn∣till in some sort I might break silence, and say so. But better late then neuer, as the prouerb goeth, and yet perhaps as good not at al, as not as it should be. I haue intēded many waies according to the courage of a scholler, to be euen with you, or at least to shew some sign of gratitude, but it would not be: and therefore haue I rested so long vpon hope of some sit oportunitie, which now being fitly offered, I haue accor∣dingly taken holde of: I present ther∣fore this little booke vnto your Wor. little I meane in bodie, but full of sub∣stance and matter: according to the
commendacion which the Poet gi∣ueth to Tydeus, the Father of Diomedes, and that was that Tydeu Ingenio mag∣nus, corpore paruus erat. A little fellowe, but full of edge. I commend it vnto your Wor although the praise therof shall rather proceede from it selfe, then from me, vnlesse I could praise it wor∣thily enough. I found it els where, and otherwise attired, and my labour and charge is onlie in this, that I haue be∣stowed thereon a new coate after our English fashion, obseruing the matter, only altering the manner. Accept it I pray you none otherwise then I mean it, not as a guift worthy enough, but as some little signe of a thankfull minde, which according as power shalbe an∣swerable vnto any good occasi∣on, I will more manifestly declare in some greater matter.
