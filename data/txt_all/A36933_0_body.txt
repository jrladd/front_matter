THe Name and Memory of the excellent Au∣thor of this Treatise needs not borrow or de∣rive a Reputation from any Pen but its own. There are already ma∣ny useful Pieces and Helps to Devotion set

forth both by Bishops, and others of our Church, more solid, ser∣viceable, and advanta∣gious to true Piety, and the power of Godliness, than all the gifted Im∣pertinencies (to say no worse) of some Holy Pretenders: For if Noise and Clamour might pass for Inspi∣ration, the Apostles must go for Weak-Brethren,

and mere Novices, compared with our new Lights and Improve∣ments. That Set Forms of Prayer are altogether necessary in Publick, cannot be denied, and needs not now be re∣presented: They are abundantly useful even for private Christians also; since it is not e∣very one that can pray extempore in his Clo∣set,

and he that can, may notwithstanding be defective enough in the matter or manner of his Petitions: For though God principally respects the Heart and Affections of his Ser∣vants, and the Spirit helps our Infirmities with sighs and groans, yet we ought even in private to have an aw∣ful orderly regard of the

Great God, to whom we address our selves; and the Holy Spirit teaches us to pray, as with ardent Affections; so with reverend humble minds, and not with dis∣orderly, confused or un∣prepared approaches, and a rude confidence, with∣out just ground or foun∣dation: This is not to help or diminish our in∣firmities, but to aug∣ment

them more. He that prays extempore, must be one of better Faith and Principles, Life and Conversation than many are, who so familiarly pretend to it. But whatever some mens Graces may be in this particular, which God forbid I should seek to diminish or reproach; yet for such, who I doubt are far the greater num∣ber,

as yet have not at∣tained to so great a Per∣fection in this holy Du∣ty, I cannot but recom∣mend these Rules and Directions, which an∣swer the Title, and will, I hope, the Expectation of those that use them, to their benefit and comfort. God grant us all that Unity of Spirit, which intitles us to the Gifts and Graces of

of the Spirit, that so praying with one heart and mind, as becometh Saints, we may have our Communion in Glo∣ry among the Iust here∣after.
