SIR.
I Dedicate my Books to you, and your Noble brother because wisdome and vertue cannot be parted, but-being my two guards of safty or preserving Patrons to defend me from nvie and Malice, I presume to call you Governour of my Regio Lucis, and him Protector of Elhavareuna, or the High Preist of the Rosie Cross, and the Harmony of the world, the Temple of Wisdome, The Holy
Guide, Contain the power of Natural science and the most absolute Consummation ther of, and that which is the Active part  Figures which by the help of the natur vertues of Mettalls, from a Mutuall a opportune application of them, brings for opperations even to Admiration, whi sciences the Rosie Crucians taught wh they came to worship our Saviour Chr when he was born. The Princes of all plac did study these sciences, as Hiarthas Ki of the Caldeans, Jespion Prince of t Brackmans, Phroates The Indian Prince Astaphon Duke of the Gimnsophists, Bud King of Babilon, Numa Pompillius Ki of the Romans Zamoxides Emperour  Thrace, Abbaris Priest of the Hiperbore Jewes, Hermes Trismegist a King and La giver of Egypt, Zoroaster the son of ∣romasus King of Persia, All these and ma more were Lovers of these Rosie Cruci Infallible Axiomata, and both writers an patrons of this Kind of Learning,  Josephus The Hebrew Hermes Eranth King of Arabia &c. And Plato relates  Alcibiades that the sons of the Persian King were instructed in these sciences, that th might Learn to administer, and distribu their Image to the Common-wealth of t world, and the Common wealth to it; and
icero saith in his Books of Divination, at there was none amongst the Persians id enjoy the Kingdome, but he that had rst Learned Philosophy, Rosie Crucians ontemplate the powers of Naturall, and oelestial things, and searching curiously nto their Simpathy doe produce incredible owers in Nature into Publique veiw, so oupling Inferiour Telesmes, Images, Ga∣hes and other things as Allurements to he Gift of superiour Angels Planets Genii, Idea's And figures and other things, at by the Mutuall application of Angels lanets and stars to Genji and figures of Geomancy upon Mattalls, arise wonder∣full Miracles, not so much by Art as by ature, to which Art becomes an Assistant hilest it works these things eelctions being ade of hours when Angels and Planets re strong, figures and Characters rightly ngraven or cast uppon prepared Spermatick ure Mettall clear and fine, free from ny Mixture. and all fitted to the Angel lanet signe Idea, figure of Geomancy nd these must be applyed to the person of he Querent or Native, signified by the Angel Planet signe Genius Idea and figure, who shall then find the Coelestiall and terre∣striall powers, unite to his desire, and per∣forme
incredible extraordinary things, at cer∣tain, times Naturally and Rosie Crucian as the most curious searchers of Nature making use of these things that are prepared by Nature only, by appling fiery active things to Earthly passive things, produce oftentimes effects before the time ordeined by Nature, which the envious scribler think are Miracles and cry them down as Magicall with and in their under opinion termed Diabolicall, which ineed are Naturall works, the prevention only of the time coming betwixt, as if any one should pro∣duce Roses in the Month of March, and apple trees Blow and bear fruit in December and Ripe cherries, Grapes and Beans in January or make parsly grow into perfect plant within few hours, and cause greater things then these, as Clouds, rain, Thunders, and ani∣malls of divers kinds and raise the Dead, And spot Horses black and white like stars or any other colour, and very many trans∣mutatious of things these Books and Arts I submit (you excelling in Jugment and Can∣dour) to your censure, that if I have wrote any thing which may end either to the con∣tumely of Nature, offending God, or injury of Religion, you may condemn the errour; but the scandall of Malicious persons being dis∣solved,
you may defend the tradition of Truth, nd that you would do so with these Books, d my self, that nothing may be Concealed hich may be profitable, and nothing ap∣proved of, which cannot but do hurt, by which eans the Harmony of the World, The emple of Wisdome, The Holy Guide, egio Lucis and Elhavareuna, having passed ur examination (aswell as my other Pa∣ons) with approbation, may at Length be ought worthy to come forth with good suc∣ss in publique as my other Books, and may ot be afraid to come under censure of sterity, because I wear the most Noble tle of.
