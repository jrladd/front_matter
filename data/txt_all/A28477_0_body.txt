My Lord,
DEDICATIONS are in this Age grown so much in fashion, that an Author who appears with∣out one, seems but an un∣couth sort of Animal; and therefore since Necessity for∣ces

me to a Compliance with this Custom, I hope Your Lordship will vouchsafe to Honour this small Piece with Your Protection. My Lord, should I follow the common course of Dedi∣cations, I might here have a fair opportunity of Celebra∣ting your many Virtues; here (indeed) is Field-Room enough to range in, and it is easie to be Eloquent up∣on such a Topick; but since Nature has by no means fit∣ted me for Panegyricks, nor is there any need of Pro∣claiming that which every one already knows; I shall now wholly forbear anything of this kind.
My Lord, what I now (with all deference) present to Your Lordship, is not any superficial, slight Notion of my own, but that which is here tender'd, is a NATU∣RAL HISTORY, drawn from the Writings of the Beaux Esprits, or the great∣est Wits of the Present Age upon these several Subjects, so that I question not but Your Lordship will meet with some Remarques, that may be Entertaining, Useful, and not Common. And if up∣on any Account it be ac∣ceptable to Your Lordship, I have then fully attain'd my End; since the ut∣most

I can pretend to, is but a Pepper-Corn Acknowledg∣ment from,
