May it please your most Excellent Maiestie;
THe whole Body of the Natu∣rall
Historie, either designed,
or written, by the late Lo.
Viscount S. Alban, was dedica∣ted
to your Maiestie, in his
Booke De Ventis, about foure
yeeres past, when your Maiestie was Prince: So
as there needed no new Dedication of this
Worke, but only, in all humblenesse, to let your
Maiestie know, it is yours. It is true, if that Lo.
had liued; your Maiestie, ere long, had beene
inuoked, to the Protection of another Historie;

Whereof, not Natures Kingdome, as in this,
but these of your Maiesties, (during the Time
and Raigne of King Henry the Eighth) had beene
the Subiect: Which since it died vnder the De∣signation
meerely, there is nothing left, but your
Maiesties Princely Goodnesse, graciously to
accept of the Vndertakers Heart, and Intenti∣ons;
who was willing to haue parted, for a
while, with his Darling Philosophie, that hee
might haue attended your Royall Commande∣ment,
in that other Worke. Thus much I haue
beene bold, in all lowlinesse, to represent vnto
your Maiestie, as one that was trusted with his
Lordships Writings, euen to the last. And as this
Worke affecteth the Stampe of your Maiesties
Royall Protection, to make it more currant to the
World; So vnder the Protection of this Worke, I
presume in all humblenesse to approach your
Maiesties presence; And to offer it vp into your
Sacred Hands.
