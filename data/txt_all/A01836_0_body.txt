SIR,
THis with another Trage∣dy intituled,  heraging Turke, the issue of one mans braine; are now come forth together from the Presse, neerer allyed, even as Twins in this their second birth▪ They are full of Glory, Strength, and in∣deed full of what not; that beautifies? The more apt to b soyled, opposed, and disgra▪ ced; the rather, because the Author ha's made Exit hence. The intent, and use of Dedication as I have observed, is to no

other end then that ignorance and spite, (sworne Enemies to ingenuity) should know vpon their dull or envious dislikes, whe∣ther to repayre nd receive reformation. The atherlesse felow-Orphan to this work rsteth safe under the protection of your most noble Brother, my much honoured Friend, Sir Richard Tichborne Knight and Ba∣ronet; Now for these reasons, and that I might not make them strangers by remote fosterings, but especially standing to you (most worthy Sir) equally engaged, I this to you Present and Dedicate: Together tendring the Love and vnfained acknowledgements, of
Your most embounden Servant
RICHARD MEIGHEN.
