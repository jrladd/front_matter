THe design of this Sale, and of all others made the preceding years in this place, was to gratifie the Curious, to divert the Melancholly, to exercise the Judgment of the most exalted minds, that condescend to grace the Wells, and aggrandize the Walks with their appearance: I am sufficiently sensible, that ab∣stractedly from the honest gain, I propose to my self, that the Honour of your Company, the noble congress I have had, hath over and above compensated the expence of my Time, and the exercise of my Lungs; being with nothing more gratified, than that I have had the favour of discoursing before persons of the most exquisite parts (perhaps the ablest Judges of Sense and Learning in the World.) This Collection of Paint∣ings will appear to the skilful to be Valuable and Inviting, the Prints that will follow Choice and Curious, carefully preserved by the Proprie∣tors, designed and made by the greatest Masters. The China Curiosities, most of the finest make. In short, let the event of this Sale be what it will, I am resolved neither to be sowred by a bad, nor elated by a prospe∣rous one; solacing my self in this one grand Philosophical Consideration, that if I can but oblige my Friends, please others, and offer matter of Entertainment indifferently to the whole, I shall have attained what I desired, viz. my wishes will be consummated; in the Contemplation of which I am resolved to live undisturbed.
