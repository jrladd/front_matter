Pierian sisters, Types of true Renowne,
the radyant lights of Art and sacred skill:
I come not to implore a Lawrell Crowne,
wherewith to decke my rude vntutred quill.
Nor doe I seeke to climbe Parnassus hill.
In briefe the world of Folly I vpbrayde,
Yet dare not presse, Faire Dames to craue your aide.
I smooth no sinne, I sing no pleasing song,
I cloake no vice, I seeke to bleare no eyes,
I would be loath to doe Minerua wrong:
To forge vntruths, or decke my lynes with lyes,
I cannot fable, flatter, nor disguise.
Yet mounted now on Tymes discerning stage,
I stand to note the Follies of our Age.
FINIS.
