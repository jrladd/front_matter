GENTLEMEN,
IT is now but Three Years since I had this Ho∣nour
before; and If I am come so soon again to
tender my new Service to my Worthy old Masters, I
have only this to say, That You live in a Warm
Sun and a Fruitful Soyl; where WORTH and
VIRTUE spring up apace amongst You, when you
have so often the Pride of Filling the CHAIR from
a Member of the Honourable COMPANY of
GROCERS.
Your Griffons are truly a Bird of Wing, when they
Fly so High and Mount so Fast: But indeed it is less
to be wondred that Growing HONOUR should
Root so Strong and Flourish so Eminently with You,
when the very ROYAL-FOUNTAIN of it,
makes One amongst You; whilst not only the Lord of
it, but likewise the SOVERAIGN of the Chair
too, Great WILLIAM himself if a Member of
Your SOCIETY: And though, it's true, so many
Crown'd Heads before had so often Blest Your Happy
Roof: Yet let it suffice, that this last Glory consum∣mates
Your whole Renown: And whilst You stand
thus highly Graced with that Illustrious and Adorable
Name Inrolled amongst You; As by the Reach of Your

Charter the whole Spicy-Nest was all Your own before,
I may now add this Prouder Blazon to Your Scutcheon,
that You have the Phaenix too.
Dic quibuscum sis, & dicam quis es.
(Worth is known by the Company it Keeps.)
Was a Celebrated True Adage of Old, which you Gen∣tlemen,
have amply Veryfied: For it is sufficient for
the truly Honourable G R O C E R S, to their Noblest
Reputation, to tell the World, that the Darling of
Britain, the Champion of Christendom, and the Pride
of Europe, the English LYON Herds with You:
And the particular Inclination of the Albion CAESAR
in Electing Your SOCIETY His Favourite Choice,
is an ample Demonstration, that His Encouragement
for such an Election, was, that undoubtedly he found
those Virtues amongst You, Nearest His Own; and
Worthiest such Royal Favour.
And, Gentlemen, whatever other Conspicuous
Merits You challenge, 'tis enough that this single Plume
in Your Fair Crest, shall Entitule You to no common
Share of Fame; and 'tis with my Congratulation of
This, and all your Other Happiness, I subscribe my
Self,
GENTLEMEN,
