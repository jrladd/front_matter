My Lord,
YOu read this Tragedie, and smil'd vpon't, that it might liue: and therein, your mercy was diuine; for it exceeded Iustice. My Num∣bers I not shew vnto the publike Eye, with an ambition to bee quickly knowne; (for so I couet noyse, not fame) but that the world may learne, with what an early haste, I striue to manifest my seruice to your Lordship. I haue imagi∣nations of a greater height then these, which I doe also dedicate to your Lordship. And I shall liue in vaine, vnlesse you still continue to acknowledge▪
