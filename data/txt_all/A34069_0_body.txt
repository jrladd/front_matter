MUCH HONOURED SIR,
PAtriots of their Countrey, Especially such as are found for their Abilities sit to serve the King in Forraign affaires, have commonly those faculties which render them most worthy of Honourable Employments, and they which are capable to deal with the Hollanders are known to be couragious, patient, and faithfull.
Your Honour may please to remember when I brought the Kings Letter to the States General at the Hague in April last, with his Majesties directions to your self, strictly commanding you to require speedy satisfaction & reparation for the loss of the Bona Esperan∣za and Henry Bona Adventure of London, two Ships as signifi∣cant in their names as the Damages grievous in their nature; I told your Honour there was just grounds of Complaint, which should be vigorously prosecuted, wherein I have found great experience of your favour and constancy toward us.
Oratory is fitter for Comedies then Cases, I have therefore in plain terms set forth the true State of the whole matter, with some observations upon former proceedings to satisfie all persons concerned, that several actions and complaints have been brought in this case in the late distempered times some of them through delay of Justice suffered non-suits, others by denial, and death of the parties abated, Moritur actio cum persona, and divers through the defect of Commissioners appointed to hear them were dismissed

without any determination, But this lis incepta now brought in a Politique way in the Kings Name, with your assistance, those which are the sufferers poterunt litem incoeptam prosequi, &c. Sir you have kept up our good adventure and good hope from sinking, and although their ladings were surprised in the Straights of Malacca & at Mauritius, if they be not restored by your friendly conferences, I doubt not but to reprise them in the Downes, or Narrow-Seas, and question not a full satisfaction as clear as the Sun at Mid-day without abusing the Kings goodnesse, or deserving any punishment for making the world acquainted that since the East-India Com∣pany of the Netherlands will not acknowledge our right, its easily granted they must pay for doing us wrong: Honoured Sir, you have to doe with a Crooked Generation of men, and Nunquam efficies ut recte ingrediantur Cancri. I shall not trouble your Honour any further at present, but to give you the most hearty thanks and pray∣ers of all the interessed, and acknowledge my self
Grays-Inn Novem. 5. 1662.
Ever Honoured Sir,
