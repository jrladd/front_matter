THis short conceipt, that I haue writ of late,
To you kinde Father BVBB, I dedicate,
Not that I meane heereby (good sir) to teach,
For I confesse, your skills beyond my reach:
But since before with me much time you spent,
Good reason then, first fruits I should present:
That thankefullThe na∣ture of this Bird is: that building her nest vnder the couer of hou∣ses (as the Swallow doth with vs) leaus euer behinde her for the owner of the house, one young one, in token of her thankfulnesse: and as I may say, for pawne of her rent. Bird that leaues one young behinde,
Ensamples me, to beare a thankefull minde:
Vngratefull he, that thankes can not repay
To him, that hath deseru'd it euery way:
Accept (kinde Sir) my loue, that being doone,
I aske no more, desire other Boone.
