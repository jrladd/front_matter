PErusing (vertuous Ladie) a Greeke Author, entituled Odyssea (writ∣ten by Homer prince of Greeke po∣ets) noting therein, the chast life of the Ladie Penelope (in the twen∣tie yeers absence of hir louing lord Vlysses) I counterfeited a dis∣course, in English verses, terming it her Complaint: which treatise, comming to the view, of cer∣taine my special friends, I was by them oftentimes encited to publish it. At length weying with my selfe, the shipwracke that noble vertue chastitie is subiect vnto: and seeing an vn∣knowne Author, hath of late published a pamphlet called A∣uisa (ouerslipping so many praiseworthy matrons, hath regi∣stred the meanest: I haue presumed vnder your Ladiships pa∣tronage, to commit this my Penelopes complaint (though vn∣perfectly portraied) to the presse: not doubting but the Etimo∣logie of so rare a subiect, enchased with the Physiognomie of your excellent chastitie: so worthie a conclusion cannot but be a sufficient argument, both to abolish Venus Idolaters, & also to counteruaile the checkes of Artizans ill willers, which carpe at al, but correct nothing at al: measuring other mens labours, by their owne idle humors. Thus offering vn∣to your Ladiship the firstlings of my scholers crop for a satis∣faction of my presumption, and hoping you wil pardon my boldnes, and accept of this my proffered seruice, I commit you to the grace and tuition of the Almightie.
