Most gracious Soveraigne,
THE only ends or scopes at which my desires, in the first draught of this long worke of comments upō the Apostles Creed, did ayme, were first and principally the

glory of God, which is the supreme Cause of causes, the maine End of all o∣ther ends, intended by good men or An∣gels: The second, subordinate to this, was to give satisfaction to my longing de∣sires, of discharging my duty to the Church my Mother, by doing her such service as I was able; in setting forth the true worship of God, and in main∣taining the faith professed by her: The third, subordinate to the second, but principally to the first, was to give an ac∣compt unto my middle age how I had spent my youth, and to leave a Constat unto my old age (at which by Gods good providence, beyond my hope or expecta∣tion; I am now arrived) that I had not altogether spent my best daies in a drow∣sie sleepe, or which is worse, in waking dreames, or wandring projects, after

pleasure, riches, ambitious hopes, or pri∣vate ends. But being first called unto Your Majesties service, in my declining yeares, I tooke the boldnesse upon me, a∣bout some five yeares agoe, in supple∣ment of my weake performances in my Ordinary attendance, to dedicate these three Bookes, concerning the knowledge of Iesus Christ, & of him crucified, unto Your Highnesse, these being, (to mine owne apprehension) the best fruites of my best and flourishing yeares. The matter or subject of them will not (I take it) be denied by any, to be the fittest Theme for the meditations of all good Christians, according to their severall capacities. And no subject under hea∣ven can be either more profitable, or more delightfull, for contemplative or stronger wits to worke upon: unto whom,

especially unto such of them, as have better meanes or abilities, then God hi∣therto hath blessed me withall, I leave to amend or finish what I have long agoe be∣gun, & thus far prosecuted. Ful time it is for me, but no time (I hope) as yet over∣past to consecrate the rest of my labours, unto death-bed-learning, and devoti∣ons, which is the best service that can be expected from me at these yeares, and which the elder I grow, the better able I trust I shall be to performe; as having by long experience found my selfe to bee then the strongest in this kinde of exer∣cise of minde and spirit, when I am in greatest weakenesse of body. Now of these my devotions and daily prayers unto God, a great part must be consecra∣ted to this end, that he would vouchsafe to continue his gracious favours and

mercies towards your Royall person, and that the Crownes of these Kingdomes, whereof you are, next, and immediatly under him and his Christ, the supreame Lord and governour, may long flourish upon your own head, & the heads of your Posteritie; that after this life ended he may invest you with a Crowne of end∣lesse glory.
