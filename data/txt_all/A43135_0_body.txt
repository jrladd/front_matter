Most dread Soveraign,
TO offer Excuse for that which I needed not to have done, were secretly to con∣fess, that having the Judge∣ment to discern a fault, I wanted the Will not to commit it. A∣gain, to seek out some colours to make it more plausible, were to bring in que∣stion the sufficiency thereof. Therefore without further insinuation either for Pardon or for Acceptance, I here present unto your Majesty this Defence, both of the present Authority of Princes, and of Succession according to Proximity of Bloud; wherein is maintained, that the People have no lawful Power to remove

the one, or repel the other: In which two Points I have heretofore also decla∣red my opinion, by publishing the tragi∣cal Events which ensued the deposition of King Richard, and Usurpation of King Henry the Fourth. Both these labours were undertaken with particular respect to your Majesties just Title of Succession in this Realm: and I make no doubt, but all true-hearted Englishmen will always be both ready and forward to defend the same with expence of the dearest drops of their bloud. The Lord vouchsafe to second your honourable Entrance to the Possession of this Crown, with a long and prosperous continuance over us.


Qui tibi Nestoreum concessit pectus & ora,
Nestoreos etiam concedat Jupiter annos.
