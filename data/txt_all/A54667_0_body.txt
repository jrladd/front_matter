MILORD,
He main Drift and Scope of
this Treatise is to redeem
rescue Heraldry, from the

cheap and contemptible Cha∣cter
of more Mysterious canting
an Attribute dropp'd upon it by
some of the Learned, who never
read it; and the Ignorant, wh
never understood it.
Yet am I not so confident and
magisterial to perswade my sel
that the foundation on which 
have established this discourse, i
so even and Artfully laid, bu
that future Ages and succeeding
Labours may by new supplement
both enlarge and strengthen it, and
that there may be some mor
Elegant and Eminent super|
structures erected upon it by Pen
more Ingenious, and Hands mor

Dextrous than mine own. In the
Interim let it be what it will in the
the whole Fabrick and contexture
of it, it is become the object both
of your Lordships Justice and
Mercy: and when your Justice
hath scan'd and winnowed every
particular of it, it will entitle it
self to a great Felicity (whether it
stand or fall) that it hath under∣gone
the Test and Scrutiny of so
judicious a Censure.
And if after a serious survey∣ing
and sifting of every ingredient,
that composes the Frame and
Compact of it, the former obli∣ges
you to condemn, it is my
Hope your Mercy will step in,

and at the same instant, likewise
engage you to forgive
My LORD,
