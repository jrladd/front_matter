WORTHY Knight, I haue read of many Essaies, and a kinde of

Charactering of them, by such, as when I lookt into the forme, or nature of their wri∣ting, I haue beene of the conceit, that they were but Imitators of your breaking the ice to their inuentions; which, how short they fall of your worth, I had rather thinke then speake, though Truth neede not blush at her

blame: Now, for my selfe vnworthy to touch neere the Rocke of those Diamonds, or to speake in their praise, who so farre exceede the power of my capacitie, vouch∣safe me leaue yet, I be∣seech you, among those Apes that would counterfet the actions of men, to play the like part with learning, and

as a Monkey, that would make a face like a Man, and cannot, so to write like a Scholler, and am not: and thus not daring to aduen∣ture the Print, vnder your Patronage, with∣out your fauourable allowance, in the de∣uoted seruice of my bounden duty, I leaue these poore Trauells of my Spirit, to the

perusing of your plea∣sing leasure, with the further fruites of my humble affection, to the happie employ∣ment of your honora∣ble pleasure.
