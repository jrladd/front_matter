Excellent Madame, chiefe grace of the graces,
Minde of the Muses, commendations letter,
To whom for vertue, Nature is a detter;
By whom wit, beautie; beautie, bountie graces:
In whom worth, Honor; Honor, wonder places;
Of whom this strife, if fortune could make greater,
Or nature fairer, or instruction better,
So faire, great, good, each-other entre-laces.
To offer wordes, a worthlesse sacrifice:
Yet wordes mans priuiledge, mindes trouch-men are,
Loue-lawyers, Princes-Herauldes, marchants-factors,
If they to things, as things to them suffice.
Yet heauens, and you, accept what poore can spare,
Beyond poore powre nor they, nor you exactors.
