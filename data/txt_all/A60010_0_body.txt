Honour'd Sir,
ONe of the chiefest Ingredients, that serves to compleat a Mans happyness in this World, is the right adapting of things, and the fit applying them to Time, Place, and Persons, as occasion re∣quires. The Sun has not yet finish'd his Course through the Zodiack, The Hi∣story of the Eu∣charist. since I had the Happiness of shew∣ing my Obsequiousness to a vene∣rable Judge of your Name and Fa∣mily, upon another Argument: It
hapned to be his Viaticum, he soon after disappear'd, and enter'd into his Master's Joy.
You are now, Sir, mounting the Horizon, beginning to run your Course, my inclination, as well as the florid Season of the Year, excites me to congratulate your coming to London: Were my Abilities an∣swerable to my Mind, there should not a Year nor a Day pass, but I would express my Gratitude to the Antient, Loyal, and Flourishing Fa∣milys of the Wyndhams & Hun∣gerfords in general, (from whence you are Linealy descended) and to Your Self (the Top and Chief Branch) in particular, for the many Favours I stand obliged unto you.
A Person of Quality, and great Merit, was pleas'd not long ago to recommend this little Book to me, as
a thing well enough approved of by the Curious: I lookt upon it again and again, and found, that though it be little in Bulk, yet 'tis very Great in Worth and Value: What would wee have but Flowers and Marrow, Strength and Beauty; it treats of the greatest Persons of Antiquity, and discovers their spots and perfections; it extends to the greatest Persons of the times past and present: It uni∣versally regards all Man-kind: The Famous Author of it is deservedly reputed one of the greatest Men of this Age. I freely confess, I find in it so many Notions applicable to myself, and every body else that has seen a∣nything of the World, and so many Moral as well as Political Remarks and Maxims, worthy of your Know∣ledge, Practice, and Observation, that rather than it should any lon∣ger
lye incognito, I could not for∣bear Communicating it to the World, under the auspicious Pro∣tection of your Great Name; and to confirm my Hypothesis, I find a Conformity betwixt the Interlocutor and your Circumstances, and there∣fore do make it Yours rather than any body's else.
Proceed therefore, Noble Sir, to the Court, and to the Senat-House, Imitate the worthy Example of the Famous Curtius, and prove a true English Manlius, in encouraging true Religion and Virtue, and distri∣buting Justice Impartially, in the Sphaere God has plac'd you. I have seen several of your Friends treat you with their fine Coaches, Houses, Gar∣dens, &c. I thought a Book, amongst your other Recreations, might som∣times serve for a Diversion, Quel
ch'io ho jo u'el dono. Beseech∣ing Almighty God to preserve you from all temporal Dangers, and fi∣nally to reward you with everlasting Happyness, I ever remain;
Honour'd Sir
