Reverend, and Worthy in the Lord,
THe great breaches which now for some time have, and still are made upon those publick Endearments to us, (viz.) Religion, our King and Parliament, do sorely presse us, and wound us deeply; What shall we do? We cannot keep silence, we dare not; if we should, our Consciences would not. Great are our fears, but great∣er are our duties, for the performance of which, we have trampled down all our fears, and through Gods mercy have met together, and resolved with one heart and voice to own the Vows of God upon us, and according to their obligation (if we can do no more, yet) at least to deliver our own souls. In order whereunto, we, and some others of our Brethren have chosen and sent up our Brethren, Mr. Samuel Welles Minister of Banbury, and Mr. John Bayly Minister of Frenckford, to wait upon you at London: whose Labours in this very thing also, according to the wisdom and zeal given you, we hear of, and rejoyce in, praying for you, that they may not be in vain in the Lord: They will acquaint you with our Humble Advice to the Lord Generall and his General Councel; which (though of it self it be a poor nail hammered by us inferiour Workmen) yet be∣ing fastened by the hands of such Masters of the Assemblies as your selves) may enter the deeper, and stick the faster. We beseech you to peruse it, and to direct them in all things conducing to the right mannaging of it; and to admit our few mites into the Treasury of your Religion and Loyalty. And the God and Father of lights di∣rect and assist you and us to shine as lights in the midst of a froward generation. To his Mercies we commend you, and rest

FINIS.
