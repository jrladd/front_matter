SIR,
WHEN things of this nature are presented
to Persons of your high Rank, and Quality;
flattery is always suppos'd the Trade-wind,
that carries the Author quite through the
Dedication. But my design is wholly to offer to your Grace
the first fruits of my Muse, that (when pleasure lives, and
serious thoughts come on) I may excuse my folly, by laying
my Maiden-head at your Door. Nor durst I have attemp∣ted
thus far into the World, had not the Laureats own
Pen secur'd me, maintaining the out-works, while I lay safe
inrencht within his Lines; and malice, ill nature, and
censure were forc'd to grinn at a distance. If I have not

perform'd my part in this Piece; the excuse of a young
beginner will pass with the reasonable part of mankind:
but when I look upon your Lordship, and joyn your Princely
Birth, to the early promises of manly Vertue, which you
daily give us (if you communicate an influencing beam on
me) (as you must shine on all) I dare, without the gift of
Prophesie, venture to say, the inspiration may refine my
thoughts, to some more worthy offering. Cou'd my vanity car∣ry
me to the hopes of succeeding in things of this kind; I
am comfident my surest way wou'd be, to draw my Caracters
from you, in whom the fairest Images of nature are shewn in
little: Your Royal Fathers Greatness, Majestick Awfulness,
Wit and Goodness, are promis'd all in yo: Your Mothers
conquering Beauty triumphs agen in you: Nature has blest
you with a Royal Parentage, and Fortune been just to you, in
a Priely Education: And nothing is wanting now to Crown
our hpes, but time, to make you in England what Titus was
in Rome, the Delight of mankind; which that you may prove,
shall ever be the Constant wish of
SIR,
