ƲNiversities being Nurseries of Pie∣ty and Learning, have Kings and Nobles for their Nursing Fathers, who out of their Generous Inclina∣tions to do Acts of Honor highly to encourage the Republick of Learning, have founded Colleges, as so many Societies, skilful in variety of Arts and Sciences, to refine and improve the rough intellectu∣als and degenerate Morals of illiterate and ill principl'd men.

In our Illustrious Schools of most vertuous Education are celebrated frequent Devotions, wherein the Students do dedicate themselves to the Author of all knowledge and perfection.
And the Professors and Lecturers do read privately in Societies, and publickly in the Schools, many Lectures in Logick, Natural Philosophy, Mathematicks, Metaphysicks, and several sorts of Tongues, and in Divinity, as the Consummation of the rest.
And I am bound in Duty to do Justice without Flattery to our Ʋniversities (having seen many in Foreign Countries) that they are the most Famous and Flourishing, that ever I had the happiness to see, as having the most Magnificent Buildings, and the greatest Endowments, and number of Learned Professors of Arts and Sciences, and Students, who have the best method pro∣pounded to them of obtaining Learning, whereby they are ren∣dred the greatest Proficients in reference to Piety and good Li∣terature, accomplishing their Intellectuals and Morals.
I have had the advantage to see many Ʋniversities in France, Italy, and the Low Countries, which are very Eminent for the Faculty of Phisick, as having many Pro∣fessors (highly versed in the Practical Part) who carry the Students, as their Associates to their Patients, demanding of them what their Diseases are, and with what Methods and Medicines they are to be Cured: When the Students have
given their Judgment, the Professors speak their sense in reference both to the state of the Diseases and their Cures.
And to speak Ingeniously without doing injustice to Foreign Nations, I humbly conceive the Phisitians of our Famous Ʋniversities, and the most Renowned College in London, are not inferior to any, if not the best, in point of Theory and Practise.
And the Members of the Ʋniversities are not only Masters of Learning, but of a Liberal Education too, as being Gentle∣men as well as Scholars, endued with Generous Principles, and a most Compleasant humour, treating Strangers as well as Friends, with all Civility and Kindness imaginable.
The way of Living, of which I have had Experience for many Years, is with great Delight and Satisfaction, in a most Friendly Converse of Scholars entertaining each other in their younger and disinterest years with kind Looks, and plea∣sant Language, as so many expresses of entire Love, and most affectionate esteems.

I have Dedicated this Epistle to both Ʋniversities, as being one in Piety, Learning and Education. Thus wishing them from my very Heart and Soul, that they may flourish in Reli∣gion and all Arts and Sciences (as long as the Sun and Moon endureth) that they may be improved in Gods Service to his Glory, which is the Earnest Prayer of
