This Epistle and Preface shews Catoes best rules for a Plantation.


May it please your good Lordships and fellow Adventurers,
HAving been blasted with the whirlwind of this late, unnaturall and civill English war, seeing the Storm more likely to encrease then to calm, I recollected my former Journall and Manuall notes of my Travails by Land and Sea forty years since in I∣taly, France, Germany, Poland, and Belgia, and finding Omne solum forti patria, ut piscibus aequor; I perused all the books of any English Co∣lonies, and by often conferences of the traders and resident planters, of the present state, condition, numbers, enemies, bad neighbours, aire, health govern∣ment, fortification and saftety, religion, quietnesse, profit, and returns, ship∣ping for supplie and vent of the growing commodities; I conferred with my fellow patients, 7 Knights and Gentlemen, my kindred and neighbours, and reporting the true state of all our Colonies; and whiles thus musing I stood at a maze unresolved, the storm grew far more tempestuous with thunder and lightning, black and terrible gusts, and spouts, that made the rivers rise, and my friends to hide: for the roaring Cannon beat down their wals and houses, the Musqueteers, Dragoons▪ and Pistold horsemen swept all Cattell and their goods afore them; the Pikemen in their inclosures and retreats, left them no beds, pots or pans; their silver plate was turned into earthen dishes: New names, and terms, like an unknown language, and like to strange people unheard of in all the Globe as far as our Antipodes, called Cavalleers, Presbyters, Independents, Roundheads, and Malignants, like the Gothes, Huns,

and Vandalls, and Alans, that invaded and conquered Italy, Spaine, and France; and like the Saxons, Jutes, and Angles, that conquered Britanny. These having plundered, and put upon us new Laws and Ordinances, called Contribution, Excise, Quartering, and Sequestrations, my friends were now and rightly by Gods Providence made light, and not troubled or incumbred with much stuffe to travel with, nor Farms, Tenements, or Copyholds, and for our sins our pride abated, our hearts humbled: our afflictions made us pray heartily, and call to God to direct us to infuse contrition and true sor∣row, and purpose of amendment to follow his calling. Wee found this storm and heavy judgement had likewise afflicted Scotland, Ireland, Man, Jarsey, and Garasey Isles. Then perusing my old evidences, I found my Auncestor Sir Richard Plantagenes had Chawton, Blendworth, Clanfield, and Catrington in Hampshire. But in those Civil-wars in Henry the sixth time, much like these or that of the Guelfs and Gibellines in Italy, all was lost. I resolved to be a Newter in this quarrell, not to kill English men and Christians, but with Christ to fly into Egypt, and like the Apostle Paul to fly out of one City into another, and get out of the fire: At last my seven Knights and Gentlemen imployed me the oldest and boldest Traveller to see all English Plantations, by warrant to buy land in the healthiest and best for us eight, and for a hundred servants, and twenty of our old tenants and fa∣milies. But in my private instructions, I was on a full and deliberate coun∣sell directed to follow old Catoes rules in seating of the Romane Colonies, begun to be seated to save charge of Garrisons in new Conquests. First, to seat in a healthy pure aire: else after all the hazzard, charge and building past, their people die, and their posterity extinguish, and their children inherit ficknes & weaknesse. Secondly, to sit down in a fresh navigable river for trade and supply, where there was stone neer to build, and not to build on wood subject to firing of enemies, negligence of servants, or treachery of slaves and apprentices; for this reason I on my view of Virginia, disliked Virginia, most of it being seated scatteringly in wooden clove board houses, where many by fire were undone, and by two massacres in an instant fired, without any forts there, or retreats of safety in time of danger, and seated amongst Salt∣marches and Creeks, where thrice worse then Essex, and Tenet, and Kent for agues and diseases, brackish water to drink and use; and a flat Country, and standing waters in woods bred a double corrupt air, so the elements corrupted, no wonder as the old Virginians affirm, the sicknesse there the first thirty years to have killed 100000 men. And then generally five of six imported died, and now in Iune, Iuly and August chiefly, one in nine die imported, absent a year and returning: though much land more now is cleared and victuall and cattell mendeth the diet. Thirdly, Catoes and the third Romane rule was

to seat in rich land so that the richnesse of the place and neernesse of husban∣dry may continue the Colony with plenty and safety: this also Virginia for the most part wanteth, they living in salts, and most of their lands after two crops is a light hot earth, which kils barley with the hot ground and Sun in May.
Thus instructed I viewed Barbadoes and Saint Christophers, Bermudoes, New England, and Virginia, and Maryland; Saint Christophers I finde worne out, two parts full of French aliens subject to blast it, and winds blow∣ing away Cotten, wanting victuals, and no store of land; Barbadoes hath some rich men, having Sugar mils, Indico, Ginger, Suckets of Oranges and Lemmons, and bad Tobacco; but their usuall bread is of Cassada roots, whose juice is poyson, so the negligence of a servant or slave in the right making of it may cost the whole family a poysoning; the servants usuall food is some Pease, Potatoes, Roots, and those boyled make their drink called Mobby and Plantana roots; some rich have Poultry, and Hogs, and Cows tied up to trees, for there are few Raunges and Inclosures. These two last yeares the plague as I am informed killed 10000 brave people, and there are many hundred Rebell Negro flaves in the woods; here was no store of land for our 120 men and their families, here wants the English mans grasse, and so the Eng∣lish mans Beef, Mutton, Milk, Butter and Cheese, and they want rivers to turn their Sugar mils, so that New England sendeth Horses, and Virginia Oxen, to turn them at excessive rates, and their keeping is there chargeable, and at Barbadoes they buy much Beef and Meal, and Pease, and Fish from New England, and other places, yet this Isle is full of gallant people, very civill and well governed, and now no fear of the Spaniard being so popu∣lous. Then I touched at Bermudoes, an Isle twenty miles long, and two miles over; and in some places more guarded with Rocks and Isles, difficult in accesse, full of Figs, Oranges, Lemmons, Pomcitrons, Potatoes, and Plan∣tans, Mays wheat for bread, excellent Fish, Tobacco and Pease; healthy it is and quiet in government; But this Isle being but a pretty prison, was not for my Companies use. Thence I sailed to New England, where I found three months snow, hard winter, but lean land, in generall all along the Sea coast well peopled Towns, the people very thristy, industrious, and tempe∣rate; their fish carried to Bilbao, and Saint Sebastans, their Pipe-staves to the Isles and Spain, and the corn of the floated river of Connectacute is transported, and the Beaver trade is their best subsistence. Still hoping for a richer and more temperat soile, I went to Virginia, passing 310 miles along the shoars and Isles of New Albion, by Manhatas Isle, by Long Isle, Cape May, and the two Capes of Deleware Bay, by the lesser and southermost, being by our Sea-mens observations just in 38 degrees, and 40 minutes, and so by

Chingotto, and Fez Isles in Maryland to Virginia, to Newports News, where receiving kind entertainment at Captain Matthews, at Master Fantleroys, and free quarter in all places, finding the Indian war ended, first by the valour, courage, and hot charge of Captain Marshall, and valiant Stilwel, and fini∣shed by the personall and resolute March and Victory of Sir William Berk∣ley Governour, there taking the old King Ope Chankino prisoner, I wan∣dred all over, finding no place for the reasons aforesaid fit for our Compa∣ny: I went to Chicacoen, the North part of Virginia on Pawtomeck river, dividing it and Maryland, which I found healthier and better then Virginia, but then it was in war both with the Sasquehannocks, & all the Eastern Bay In∣dians, and a Civill war between some revolters protestants, assisted by 50 plun∣dered Virginians, by whom M. Leonard Calvert Governour under his bro∣ther the Lord Baltamore, was taken prisoner and expelled: and the Isle of Kent taken from him also by Captain Clayborn of Virginia; yet I viewed Kent Isle, too wet, and plashy, having bad water, but there and at Chicacoen, and at Accomack in Virginia, and chiefly in New England, they related of the excellent temper, and pure aire, fertility of soile, of hils that sheltered off the North-west windes, and blasts, vallies of grapes, rich mines, and millions of Elkes, Stags, Deer, Turkeys, Fowl, Fish, Cotten, rare fruits, Timber, and fair plains, & clear fields, which other Plantations want, this excelling all others: & finding it lay just midway between Virginia, too hot and aguish in the blasted plains on one side, and the cold New England on the other, and in the same elevation of Naples, the Garden of Europe, after one hunting voiage and view 60 miles on one side of Albion, and 310 miles on the other side, and Long Isle, finding the countries better and pleasanter then related, I made my addresses to the Lord Governour of Albion, and having obtained under the Province Seal my grant of my Manor of Belvill containing 10000 acres, on a navigable river, having in it and neer, Alablaster, Terras for plaister of Paris, Building and Slatstone, store of Timber, clear Fields, Meads and Woods, and no Indians neer, and Vines, I resolved to return to Holland, and to transport my friends, where most happily the second time meeting his Lordship, and perusing by his noble favour, all his Lordships Cards, and Seamens draughts, 17 journall books of discoveries, voiages, huntings, tradings, and severall depositions under seal of the great Bever, and fur trade, rich mines, and many secrets and rarities. In fourteen days having with the two former books printed of Albion 1637, and 1642. made a full abstract and collection, a∣greeing with my own view & in the Depositions, and M. Evelins, and other the traders of Virginia & New England, I thought it most necessary for the good of all the Company, and many Voluntiers in Holland, distressed in England, and noble Knights, Gentlemen, that with a little stock may gain fair and rich

possessions, and live in peace and quiet, to print and publish this my labour under all your Lordships Protections, most humbly craving your Lordships gentle acceptance.
And because it conduceth much for a General & a Leader, to be known of his Commanders and Soldiers, his abilities, and vertues, and excellent parts drawing more men of honour and valour to follow him; it contenting much men of honour and dignity to be led and commanded by a better and more honourable, and more sufficient then themselves, and not their inferiour: the meaner and poorer sort expecting all encouragement, justice and protection, and all the Company, the Adventures, and strangers to us all, may more freely and chearfully goe on, and set out their men, and expect the more and better returns & contentment, under his government, in whom Pietic, Religion, Honor, Justice, Learning, Valor, Judgement, Temperance, and Policie shines; hope without offence or imputation of flattery, to affirm his virtues more then the gems of the Coronet of this our Earl Palatine, doe adorn his noble parts.
Since to me conscientiamea mille restes, I have had the honour to be ad∣mitted as his familiar, have marched, lodged, and cabbined together, amongst the Indians & in Holland, have seen so many of his Manuscript Books, and most excellent Rules and Observations of Law, Justice, Policy, I found his con∣versation as sweet and winning, as grave and sober, adorned with much Learn∣ing, enriched with sixe Languages, most grounded and experienced in forain matters of State policy, and government, trade and sea voiages, by 4 yeares travell in Germany, France, Italy and Belgium, by 5 years living an Officer in Ireland, and this last 7 years in America, his studie and suits at home and abroad enabling his impartiall and infallible judgement of Judicature, and certainly his perfect knowledge of his 23 Indian Kings, under the command of this our Lord Royall, as of his good and bad neighbours, their power, wealth and weaknesse, English Aliens and Indians appears by his notes and books, where none of their treacheries, plots, conspiracies, haltings and villa∣nies, their Antagonists, their numbers and abilities, the advantage of our armes and fights, and stratagerns are as Greek phalanges and they as Romane Manu∣ples and enemies to side with; and how to quiet and regain, kill, or surprise them, is not expressed. What Port, Bay and soundings, Creek, river, rock, quarries of stone, slat, Iron mines, Gum-Dragoon, Lead, Gold, and Silver, Alablaster, Terras Bolarmack, red soap earth, Terra-lemnia, Diers ware, Hearbs and Plants, and their use, Ocar, Rudle, Cinnaber for quicksilver, and Vermi∣lion, is not in particular, Cards by compasse, and scale in books, with the trials and witnesses recorded.
What land and sea profit, fishing, place for salt, Potas Dies, Fruits Hearbs and Plants, clear Fields, great Plains, fine and thick Grasse, Marshes, necks of

land, rich, black, moulded countries for Tobacco, Flaxe, Rice, choice Trees, and Timber for Shipping, and Pipestaves, Masts, Yards, Pitch, Tar, sheltred places for Grapes and Fruits; Cotten in Cotten river, invincible places by nature, others by a little charge and fort to be made impregnable, is not in this huge and waste Province, being 1000 mile compasse delineated; and what Law or Policy, and summary Justice, Courts of Law, Equity, Ap∣peals, Awards, or references, fit to compose differences, reconcile debates, to unite hearts, to settle the factious and seditious in any other English Colonies or Countries, and fit for our Justice, is not explained.
Therefore my good Lords and Adventurers, since I speak of knowledge by view, and certain reports of wise and knowing men, I shall joy and con∣gratulate with you all, in so able, sufficient, and honourable a Governour, happily to rule, to defend, and doe us justice; a tried and seasoned man, and excellent Pilot in all this Land and Seas, not afeard in person as a true Cap∣tain Generall by Land and Sea, to leade and settle us by Boat, Horse or Foot, as able and willing as any of the meanest; and therfore I think at first it most materiall to expresse the Law, Statutes, and Judgements, and Acts of Parliament of Counts, and Count Palatines, and County Palatines, and of our Province and County Palatine, Liberties, and the ancient family 1200 year from the Saxons in England, of our Earl Palatine, his pedegree and alli∣ance.
And since according as other Palatines, as he of Chester and Duresme, made their Barons and Knights, as therein many are yet living, you my Lord have begun to honour first your own children, I tender my best respects unto your Lps sonne and heir apparant Francis Lord Ployden, Baron of Mount Royall, D. Governour, and to Thomas Lord Ployden, Baron of Roymont, High Ad∣mirall: and to the Lady Winefrid Baronesse of Vvedale, the pattern of mild∣nesse and modesty; and to the Lady Barbara, Baronesse of Ritchneck, the mirrour of wit and beauty, and to the Lady Katherine Baronesse of Prince∣port, that pretty babe of grace, whose fair hands I kisse, hoping on your Lord∣ships invitation C. C. T. and your two Baronets L. and M. to get them as they promised to goe with us. I hope to get your Knights and 200 Planters on this side ready. And thus with tender of my service to your Lordships, and all the Company, I rest

Middleboro this 5 of Decemb. 1648.
