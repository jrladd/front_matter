I Published a Booke (Right Honourable) against the Brownists, who complaine of hard dealing, and not on∣lie they, but others, in that I haue termed them Dona∣tists, and charge them with sundrie foule mat∣ters. And hauing now receiued from them an answer vnto one part of that my booke; I haue also framed this replie: In which I first set downe from point to point out of the writings of the holie Father Augustine, with what Scrip∣tures and arguments it was defended, and so compare our mens writings and doings with the same. They must for this, chuse either to affirme, that the Donatists had the truth, and the chur∣ches

were perished: or else shewe some materiall points of Donatisme, which they doo not hold. And then in the latter part of this my booke, I answer to that which is published now by them against read prayer. As I was bold to present the former vnto your Honor, so do I also hum∣blie offer this, presuming vpon your Honors fauourable acceptation. And thus I beseech the Lord God to blesse and prosper your Honor.
Amen.
