SIR,
HIstory being much the Study of a Gentleman, I have presum'd a Dedication of these few Praeludia, relating to it, to your self. Not but your own Reading, Conversation and Travels may have already furnished you with far more, and more accurate Particulars in this kind, than my poor Essays may afford? but what I have written is chiefly intended for your hopeful Offspring; to whom I conceived a brief Idea of the World in this kind, relating to those chief Potentates under whose Dominion, God, at present, has put it, might be of use for initiating their Understandings, till being come to more mature years, their own Studies and Observations in Travels, may inure them to well digested Thoughts, concerning the va∣rious Governments of the World, whereby they may be rendered serviceable to the Nation in which they live. It's well known how Eminent for Parts and Services to this Nation, the late Lord Cottington, your Uncle,

was: whose Family, a few years since, being reduced in the Male-Line, only to your self; you see Provi∣dence by vouchsafing you three flourishing. Branches of Male-Issue, has given you good Hopes, and a fair Prospect of a long Continuance of it. And as the many Favours I have received from you, have highly engaged me to wish Prosperity to it; so whenever any thing shall be suggested to my Understanding whereby I may be a Mean to promote it, it shall most readily be put in Exe∣cution by,
Sir,
