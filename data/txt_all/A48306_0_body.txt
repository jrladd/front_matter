RIGHT WORTHY SIR,
THis short discourse ensu∣ing (though long enough I hope to resolve the Question proposed) is Yours by right of Dedi∣cation (now it is publick) since it was Yours before by causality of production (as a private manuscript) for your letter to your Reverend Ʋncle (my honoured
Friend) and his to me, have been unto it, as a Grandfather and father, from whose motion and sollicitation it is lineally descen∣ded. Accept it then (good Sir) as your owne: and me with it, whom Your imma∣nent merit in your self, and transient benig∣nity to me, have long and deeply obliged to remaine

From my lodging at the Fountaine in S. Pauls Church-yard. Febr. 24. 1640.
