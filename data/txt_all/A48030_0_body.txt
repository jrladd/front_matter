My Lord,
AS Your Grace is the Chief of Your Illu∣strious Family, it would appear as rudely, Improper to Dedicate this Discourse to any other, as perhaps it doth an unbecoming pre∣sumption to present it to the Honour of Your hands,
and since there is no avoiding a Crime; the least must be admitted, for which I hope to obtain a Par∣don with less Difficulty, from that excessive Cood∣ness which is your Character, than I have had to Collect these scatter'd Papers (slubber'd with Anti∣quity) which were long preservd in Your Family, and hastily thrown into this posture by
My Lord
