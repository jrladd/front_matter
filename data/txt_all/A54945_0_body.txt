Gentlemen,
THough I have a Pa∣tron, who is your Bishop, and mine too, to whom I acknowledge the utmost of what I can per∣form to be due; (next God
and the King) Yet this Discourse consisting of that which has been lately Preach∣ed to you in the same order in which, for fashion sake, it is here published in a small Treatise; I hope I may more effectually serve you at this time, by presenting those things to your perusal, which the most of you have with kindness heard from the Pulpit. By our Ho∣nourable and Right Reve∣rend Bishops Patronage, and your favour, I have had the credit, and advantage too, of Preaching, on the Lords daies, at both ends of
your City: And what in∣fluence, by Gods blessing, Christian and Loyal Dis∣courses have had upon ma∣ny of you, your publick acti∣ons have eminently discove∣red. And therefore, with∣out any farther complement, I adventure to dedicate this Discourse to you, who am
Gentlemen,
