Worthy Sir,
I Have had a long propension
in my soule to endeavour
something worthy your ac∣ceptance,
and gaine me ho∣nour
in the oblation, had
lov'd Thalia pleas'd to blesse
my braine with some deser∣ving
subject; yet these greene fruites (though
gathered in the Spring-time of my knowledge)

and farre unworthy of so choyse a Pallat, may
by your kind acceptance bee digested, and
thought as sweet to all that tast, as the rich
fruite the pregnant Summer yeeldeth. Yet, Can∣did
Sir, I had not rob'd the Age of so much Im∣pudence
as to communicate the weake effects
my Infant Muse produceth to your judgement,
but that I knew a sweete encouragement lives
in your gentle censure can give an inspira∣tion
to that brayne that is but yet ambitious of
desert; which gives me hope I shall (when I
write next) produce things that may merit ap∣probation,
and cause you to confesse me,
