CArdinal JULIO MA∣ZARINE'S Government of Affairs, hath deser∣ved all the Applauses that Fame can give. The World hath admired him as the Product of a Phoenix. I have writ his History; And as he hath been the Splendour of our times, I think it proper to bring him to the Feet of your Highnesses of Este, who are the most splendid

Ornaments of all Italy. In the Heroick Actions of so great a Minister your most Serene High∣nesses may behold your own proper Glory; take therefore (as I most humbly supplicate) this testimony of my observance, with that be∣nignity which is proper to the Greatness of your most Serene Family, known for thousands of years to be the true Seminary of Heroes. There is no room for Pa∣negyricks in this short Dedication, neither ought your Modesty to be wronged by my weak Pen, with in∣feriour Praises to your unexpres∣sible Merits; and therefore with a most humble submission, asking Pardon for this my boldness, I rest,
