HAving a long time de∣signed to make some publick acknowledg∣ment of my great Obligati∣ons to you, I could not tell in what way more proper∣ly to do it, than by pre∣senting to you a small Col∣lection of some of those Dis∣courses, which I have lately had the Honour to Preach before you.
'Tis upon this acount that I now crave leave to Prefix your Names to these Sermons: Both as a Testi∣mony of that particular Re∣spect

I owe to you; and to let the World see, what Persons they are by whom I have the Happiness to be Countenanced and Encou∣raged in my Ministry: Such whose Integrity and Abilities, have rendred them at Once both the Support and Orna∣ment of our Courts of Justice: Whose firmness to the true Interest of our Church and Government, in the Worst of Times, have set them above the power of Malice to Ca∣lumniate: Who by suffe∣ring heretofore, rather than they would betray either the

Liberties of their Countrey, or their Own Consciences, have effectually convinced all Impartial men, That as it cannot be Ignorance of our Laws and Constitution, so nei∣ther is it Interest, or any other unworthy Design, but the clear Evidence of Right, that engages them to that Submission they now pay to the Present Government: And who that they may long pos∣sess those Places they so wor∣thily fill, and be the Honour of the Bench, as the Rest of the Society are of the Profession, is the Hearty Prayer of Him

who with all possible Re∣spect will always remain,
