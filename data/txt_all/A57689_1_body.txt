May it please your Highness,
IF Nobility of Birth, Antiquity of House, Magnanimity of Spirit, Multiplicity of Ver∣tues, and the most excellent Endowments that a Mortal Man can attain unto may justly (as their due) challenge the patronage of these my Labours, there will be none found to anti∣cipate your Highness; and though my misfortune is such, that I never had the Honour in the least to kiss your Highness hand, or to appear in your presence, but remain as yet a Stranger to your Highness; yet by reason the Work is of that sublime Worth and Excellency (I mean the Science of Astro∣logy, as appeareth by the first Book of this Volumn, it being the chief of the Liberal Sciences, together with Astronomy, Physicks and Natural Philosophy (which are all but part of one intire Science) and that wherewith none is able to compare) have I humbly presumed to cast it at the feet of your illustri∣ous Self; whose incomparable worth and indowments are unparalleld: so that if your Highnesse's Munificence doth
favourably accept of this small Token of my wel-wishes to true Nobility, d in a particular manner to your Highness, I must necessarily be constrained to acknowledge my self arri∣ved to the highest pitch of Honour that (for the present) I am capable to expect. The subject of this my unworthy Work (for so I may call it in reference to your Highnesses unparalleld excellency to whom it is presented) is that part of Natural Philosophy (vulgarly termed ASTROLOGY) which teacheth by the Natural Motions, Configurations, Aspects and Inclinations of the Coelestial Stars and Planets to Iudge of the Natural Accidents, Muta∣tions and Alterations of Laws, Customs, Kingdoms, States and Em∣pires, and the general casualties of the whole World in the Natural way of its Government, by the Coelestial and Superiour Bodies: which next under GOD are the efficient Causes of all corruption, generation, production and nutrition in this Elementary World, the knowledge whereof is to know NATURE the great Hand-maid of the Almighty, and the temper and quality of all things; and although through the mercenary practises of some by setting of Nativities, and answering of Horary Que∣stions (thus abusing the Art) the validity of this Science hath been brought into question, reproach and contempt, yet I question not but your Highnesses innate magnanimity is such, that it will not condescend to give any censure on what hath not first been summoned to the Bar or Tribunal of your Highnesses piercing Judgement; for because a thing is calum∣niated and questioned, is no proof of its illegality, neither doth the abuse take away the use thereof; for were this ad∣mitted, even the best of Sciences and chief of Studies, Divi∣nity it self could not be exempt from prohibition and con∣demnation; wherefore since the first BOOK of this Volumn tendeth wholly to the Vindication thereof from the aspersions of the Antagonists, and the abuses of the seeming Friends thereunto, I shall not further inlarge on this point; since it is well known unto the Learned, that among the Ancients and graver sort of people in all Ages, this Science (being unpol∣luted and unsophisticated) hath been still had in most high esteem; nay, it is of that profundity and excellency, that it was first taught to our first Father ADAM by GOD him∣self
(as testifyeth Iosephus, Lib. 1. Cap. 2. of h Antiquities of the Iews) who taught it to his Posterity; for he further re∣cordeth that Seth was so excellent therein, that foreseeing the Flood, and the destruction of the World thereby, ingraved this Art for the benefit of after-Ages in two Pillars, the one of stone, and the other of brick, and that he saw himself that of stone to remain in Syria in his own time; and in the 3. chap. of his aforesaid book, he further witnesseth and affirmeth, that man lived so long before the Flood to learn Arts and Sciences, especially naming Astrology and Geometry; and in his 8. chap. of that same 1. Book of the Antiquities, he doth yet further testifie, that Abraham having learned Astrology in Chaldea [being the place of his Birth] when he came into Egypt taught the Egyptians the knowledge of Astrology and Arithmetick. Where∣fore I humbly conceive, whatever some weak disputants [not worthy the noting] have affirmed in the disparagement of this Authors Credit, thinking to make for their own en∣vious and idle conceits; I say (my Lord) I humbly conceive since he beareth so great an applause and credit among the Learned and Fathers of the Church, of whom I shall only mention the testimony of Eusebius, who abundantly through∣out all his ten Books of his Ecclesiastical History maketh use of this Authors words, for further confirmation of his scope; and in lib. 1. cap. 6. de Hist. Eccles. (with divers other places which for brevitie sake I omit) he particularly useth these words (in the English version it is in the 7. chap.) Hereof thou hast Josephus a witness worthy of credit: Wherefore since by so worthy a man as Eusebius was, Iosephus is thus deemed: how worthy of credit are they that now adays traduce him rather then want of their wills, or confess themselves weak in con∣futing what they are ignorant of? Wherefore (my Lord) since this Science is of such Antiquity, worth and excellency, it imboldneth me humbly to make choice of your Highness for my Patron in this froward and confused generation, such sublime Sciences being too good, too worthy to be owned by any but who are truly Noble both in Vertues and Descent; for let men be of what opinion they will, yet I am meerly perswaded, and I have also some Natural Reasons inducing
me to this bel, that meanness of Birth and Descent, though exalted to the most eminent places and worldly dignities that may be, cannot but still retain some smack of a mean spirit, and can never be throughly acquainted with magnanimity, or be truly heroick, though some glimmerings they may have of both: Even as a Dunghill-Cock, although he be never so well fed, trim'd and ordered for the tryal of his prowess and courage, and although to the outward appearance he seem strong, able, brisk and couragious, and begin with an un∣daunted courage and boldness, yet when he is forc't to feel ei∣ther the sharpness of the Conflict, or the want of breath, hath not that Heroickness of Spirit to die rather then yield, but (which is worse) doth then divulge his own detestable pu∣sillanimity and dunghilly cowardise by running away; which a true Game-Cock that is lineally descended of Noble blood, although taken from the field, and overladen with his Fea∣thers, Comb and Gills, before he will be guilty thereof, will choose rather to die, not preferring life before Honour, but Nobleness of Spirit before life, choosing rather that death should be acted on him with extremity of rigour, then that he should with ease act the least unworthiness though to his greatest advantage. Wherefore my (Lord) though my offence hath been inexpressibly hainous by this my boldness, being altogether a Stranger to your Highness; And although I want both words and audacity to plead for my self in so foul a Fact, yet my comfort is, your own Munificence and Nobleness of Spirit will seal my Pardon; then which he is nothing more ambitious of,
Die ☽, 17 Januarii 1652.
My LORD,
