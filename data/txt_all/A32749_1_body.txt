AMongs all other excellencies, most
Gracious Soveraigne Lord, where∣with
Almighty God hath endowed
mankind, above the residue of earth∣ly
creatures, as an outward declaration of
reason or reasonableness, wherein consisteth
the similitude of Man unto Angels, and the
difference between the same and brute beasts,
I verayly suppose, that Speech or Lan∣guage
is not to be reputed amongs the
smallest or inferiours: for thereby is expres∣sed
the conceit of one to another, in open
and plaine Sentence, which in the residue
of lively creatures lacketh and is not shewed
amongs them, but by certain covert and
derke signes, and that in few things, ha∣ving
course and operation onely of nature.
This Speech or Language, after the con∣fusion
of Tongues, sent by Gods punish∣ment
for pride and arrogancy of people,
hath been by a certaine instinct and disposi∣tion
natural, devised and invented in sun∣dry
parts of the world, as fellowships or
companyings of folks one with another
chaunced, much to the outward expressing
of the thing in word or sound, according to
that whereof it had meaning or signification.
But in processe of time, by diligence or pol∣licy
of people, after divers formes, figures,
and impressions in mettall, barks of trees,
and other matter used for memory and
knowledge of things, then present or passed,
sundry letters or carectes were first amongs
the Phenices devised and found, with such
knittings and joynings of one to another,
by a marvellous subtilty and craft, as coun∣terveiled
was and is equivalent to the same
Languages. So as the conceit of mans
mind, which at the beginning was used to be
declared by mouth only, came to such point,
that it was as sensibly and vively expressed
in writing. Hereupon ensued a great occa∣sion
& courage unto them that should write,
to compone and adorne the rudeness and
barbariety of speech, and to forme it to an
eloquent and ordinate perfection: whereunto
many, and many great Poets and Orators
have highly employed their studies and cou∣rages,
leaving thereby notable Renoume
of themselves, and example perpetual to
their posterity. Amongs other, the Greeks
in all kinds of sciences seemed so to prevail,
and so to ornate their Tongue, as yet by
other of right noble Languages cannot be
perfitely imitated or followed. The Latines
by example of the Greeks, have gotten or
wonne to them no small glory, in the form∣ing,
order, and uttering of that Tongue.
Out of the which two, if it be well searched,
that is to say, Greeke and Latin (though by
corruption of speech it should seeme much
otherwise) have been derived the residue of
the Languages, that be written with the
letters of carectes of either of them both:
But of all Speeches, those which most ap∣proch
to ye Latin, be the Italian and Spanish
Tongues; of whom the one by corruption
of the Gothes and Longobardes had her be∣ginning,
as Latin spoken by strangers of a
barbare understanding: the other being also
Latin, was by Vandales, Gothes, Moores,
Sarracenes, and other so many times ble∣mished,
as marveile it is to see now unto
what perfection these two formed out of the
Latin and Barbares speeches be reduced.
Next unto them in similitude to the Latin
is the French tongue, which by diligence of
people of the same, is in few years passed
so amended, as well in Pronunciation as in
Writing, that an Englishman, by a small
time exercised in that Tongue, hath not
lacked ground to make a Grammere, or rule
ordinary thereof. Though of trouth (which
some shall scarcely believe) the Germans
have so formed the order of their Language,
that in the same is both as much plenty and
as nere concordaunce to the phrase of the
Latin, as the French Tongue hath. And ve∣raily,
like as all these and the rest have been
thus vigilant and studious to meliorate or
amend their Languages; so hath there not
lacked amongs us, Englishmen, which have
right well and notably endeavored and em∣ploied
themselves, to the beautifying and
bettering of the English Tongue.
Amongs whom, most excellent Prince, my
most redoubted and gracious soveraign lord,
I your most humble Vassale, Subject & Ser∣vaunt,
William Thynn, chief Clerke of your
Kitchin, mooved by a certain inclination and

zeal, which I have, to hear of any thing soun∣ding
to the laud and honour of this your no∣ble
Realm, have taken great delectation, as
the times and leisers might suffer, to rede
and heare the books of that noble & famous
Clerke Geffrey Chaucer, in whose workes
is so manifest comprobation of his excellent
learning, in all kindes of doctrines and sci∣ences,
such fruitfulness in words, well accor∣ding
to the matter and purpose, to sweet &
pleasaunt sentences, such perfection in metre,
the composition so adapted, such freshness of
invention, compendiousnesse in narration,
such sensible and open stile, lacking neither
majesty ne mediocrity, covenable in disposi∣tion,
and such sharpness or quickness in con∣clusion,
that it is much to be marvailed, how
in his time, when doutless all good letters
were laid asleep throughout the world, as the
thing, which either by the disposition and in∣fluence
of the bodies above, or by other ordi∣naunce
of God, seemed like (as was in dan∣ger)
to have utterly perished, such an excellent
Poet in our tongue, shuld as it were (nature
repugning) spring and arise. For tho it had
been in Demosthenes or Homerus times,
when all learning and excellency of sciences
flourished amongs the Greeks, or in the sea∣son
that Cicero prince of eloquence amongs
Latines lived, yet had it been a thing right
rare & straunge, and worthy perpetual laud,
that any Clerke by learning or witte, could
then have framed a tongue, before so rude &
imperfite, to such a sweet ornature and com∣position;
likely, if he had lived in these days,
being good letters so restored and revived as
they be, if he were not empeached by the envy
of such as may tollerate nothing, which to
understond, their capacity doth not extend,
to have brought it unto a full and final per∣fection.
Wherefore, gracious soveraigne
lord, taking such delight and pleasure in the
works of this noble Clerke (as is aforemen∣tioned)
I have of a long season much used to
rede and visite the same, and as books of di∣vers
imprints came unto my hands, I easily
and without great study might and have de∣prehended
in them many errours, falsities,
and depravations, which evidently appeared
by the contrarieties and alterations found
by collation of the one with the other, where∣by
I was moved and stirred to make diligent
search where I might find or recover any true
copies or exemplaries of ye said books, where∣unto
in process of time, not without cost and
pain, I attained, and not only unto such as
seem to be very true copies of those works of
Geffrey Chaucer, which before had been put
in print, but also to divers other never till
now imprinted, but remaining almost un∣knowne,
and in oblivion: whereupon lament∣ing
with my self the negligence of the people
that have been in this Realm, who doubtless
were very remiss in the setting forth or
avauncement either of the Histories thereof,
to the great hinderaunce of the renoume of
such noble Princes, & valiant Conquerours
and Captains, as have been in the same, or
also of the works of memory of the famous
and excellent Clerks in all kinds of sciences,
that have flourished therein. Of which both
sorts, it hath pleased God as highly to nobi∣litate
this Isle, as any other Region of Chri∣stendome:
I thought it in manere apperte∣naunt
unto my duty, and that of very ho∣nesty
and love to my Country, I ought no
less to do, than to put my helping hand to
the restauration and bringing again to light
of the said works, after the true Copies and
Exemplaries aforesaid. And devising with
my self, who of all other were most worthy, to
whom a thing so excellent and notable should
be dedicate, which to my conceit seemeth for
the admiration, novelty, and strangeness, yt
it might be deputed to be of in the time of ye
Authour, in comparison, as a pure and fine
tried precious or pollished jewel, out of a rude
or indigest masse or matere, none could to
my thinking occurre, that since, or in ye time
of Chaucer, was or is sufficient, but only
your Majesty Royal, which by discretion and
judgement, as most absolute in wisedome,
and all kinds of doctrine, could, and of his
innate clemency and goodness would, add or
give any Authority hereunto.
For this cause, most excellent, and in all
vertues most prestante Prince, I as humbly
prostrate before your Kingly estate, lowly
supply and beseech the same, yt it woll vouch∣safe
to toke in good part my poor study and
desirous mind, in reducing unto light this so
precious and necessary an ornament of the
tongue in this your Realm, over pitous to
have been in any point lost, falsified, or ne∣glected:
So that under the shield of your
most royal Protection and Defence, it may
go forth in publick, and prevail over those yt
would blemish, deface, and in many things
clearly abolish the laud, renoume, and glory
heretofore compared, and meritoriously ad∣quired
by divers Princes, and other of this
said most noble Isle, whereunto not only
Straungers under pretext of high learning
and knowlege of their malicious and per∣verse
minds, but also some of your own sub∣jects,
blinded in folly and ignoraunce, do
with great study contend. Most gracious,
victorious, and of God most elect and worthy
Prince, my most dread soveraigne Lord, in
whom of very merite, duty, and succession,
is renued the glorious Title of Defensor of
ye Christen Faith, which by your noble Pro∣genitour,
the Great Constantine, sometime
King of this Realm, & Emperour or Rome,
was next God and his Apostles, cheefly main∣tained,
corroborate, and defended: Almighty
Iesu send to your Highness the continuall
and everlasting habundance of his infinite
Grace. Amen.
