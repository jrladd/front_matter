YOur Lordship, Honou∣rable
by Birth, Breed∣ing,
Parts and Place, and
Right Honourable by your
Piety, Pains and Stability in
the Church of England, a
Blessing God hath bestowed
upon her, as a sound Pillar
for her Support, and a Saint

Paul for a Preacher: attend∣ed
with an experienced mag∣nanimous
Courage, and yet
of a most affable, courteous
and obliging Demeanour;
for all which fam'd and be∣loved
by this and other Na∣tions;
tho' envy'd and ma∣ligned
by our Churches Ene∣mies.
To whom should this small
Piece, concerning the Right
Honourable, Address it self
for Protection, but to your
Self that is so, and an En∣courager
of all Means to
make others deserve that
Title. I therefore, without
considering the vast dispro∣portion

between the Wor∣thiness
of the Person to whom
I Write, and the Meaness
of what is Written on this
Subject, as well as Obscuri∣ty
of the Author; presume
(yet with as much Humility
as the Attempt can bear) to
beg your Lordships Patro∣nage
thereof, against the Vil∣lifyings
of those Persons that
are only Honourable to the
Eyes of the Vulgar. And
that here your Lordship would
be pleas'd to accept the Ac∣knowledgment
of Favours
formerly extended towards
me, tho' I believe both those
and my self drop'd out of

your Memory; but must
ever be retain'd in mine.
And whil'st I live, make my
daily Petitions to Heaven, (for
the whole Nations, as well as
your Lordships Interest) that
Safety, Health, Prosperity,
and Honour, with length of
Days, may be your Portion
in this Life, and Eternal Hap∣piness
in the next. And
conclude with one to your
Self, that I may be accepted
amongst the meanest of your
Servants, which Title is with
all humility assum'd by
