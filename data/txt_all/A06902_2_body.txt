Gentlemen,
IT is not out of any
Ambition to get a
Name, out of any
hope of Future pro∣t,
nor out of any Disposition or

loue I haue to Nouelties, which
hath stirr'd me vp to this labour;
But onely a sincere affection I
beare to Truth and Goodnesse▪
which in former times were, and
I doubt not but will bee againe,
and euer, the best Friends and
Companions to the Bow and Ar∣row.
It is true, that in this Treatise, I
haue (according to my weake
Iudgment, and vnder the controle∣mēt
of better knowledges) shewed
how the Bow and Arrow may a∣gaine
profitably bee employed,
and Reuiued, without offence or
Scandall; It now remayneth in
you (if his Maiestie shall bee gra∣ciously
pleased, to put it in Exe∣cution)
to make good all my pro∣mises;
And that is, by furnishin
the Subiect with good Bowes▪

good Arrowes, and reasonable pri∣ces,
because defects in these, will
both disgrace the Worke, and
giue offence to the people; yet I
would not haue you mistake me,
that vnder this word Good, I meane
the best and principall Bowes and
Arrowes, As though euery man
should necessarily be armed with
Ewe and Horn-beame; no, Elme and
Birtch, are Tymbers sufficient for
priuate practise, and if they bee
well wrought, Artificially cho∣sen,
and reasonably sold; the
Subiect shall find no fault, nor the
Exercise hinderance.
This (when you are call'd vp∣on)
you are to take into your
considerations, which I know you
can better doe, then I can instruct;
therefore to it, and to the happy

proceedings of these Beginnings,
which may begin your Benefits,
I leaue you and rest,
