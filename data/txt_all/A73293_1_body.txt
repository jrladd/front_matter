WHereas noble Duke and Duchesse, I like a Fu∣nerall souldier, march my thoughts and Muses towards you, as not against your intire & friend∣ly bond of amitie & loue you euer bare to your deceased brother; and now liuing sister, the Prince and Princesse of Richmond and Lenox, but to ioyne my defence and loue with yours against the Com∣mon Aduersarie of ours, which is too much lamentation and sorrow, since the true March of Pietie, teacheth all: That death is an aduantage to the godly, both to the liuing and the dead; to the dead, I know you doubt not of: to the liuing, Salomon the wise saith, Better it is to be in the house of Mourning, then in the house of Feasting, for the wise doe lay it to their hearts, and the God of wisedome hath directed his honors so vnto you, as your religious thoughts, may March to God with your name; and I am bold in this Month of March to present the Springing thoughts of com∣fort to you and your Noble Posteritie, which to both your graces, and to the springing hopefull Plants of your loynes. I pray and wish all heauenly and earthly prosperitie, to remaine to you and yours for euer.
