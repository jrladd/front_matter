PHoenix of beautie, beauteous Bird of any
To thee I do entitle all my labour,
More precious in mine eye by far then many,
That feedst all earthly sences with thy sauour:
Accept my home-writ praises of thy loue,
And kind acceptance of thy Turtle-doue.


Some deepe-read Scholler fam'd for Poetrie,
Whose wit-inchanting verse deserueth fame,
Should sing of thy perfections passing beautie,
And eleuate thy famous worthy name:
Yet I the least, and meanest in degree,
Endeuoured haue to please in praising thee.
