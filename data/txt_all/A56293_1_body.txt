MY LORD,
I Shou'd be unjust to the Memory of the admired Purcell, and set too Small a Value on His Works, shou'd I put them under any Patronage but Your own. For Your Lordship has a Double Title to these Papers, both as You are the best Judge, as well as the Greatest Encourager of Poesy and Musick. 'Tis but fit this Great Master of the Age, that has stood the Test of Your Judgment, should Claim Your Protection: Since no Greater Character can be given of any Composition, than that it has pleas'd so Exquisite a Taste as Your Lordship's.
But I am not so vain, as to attempt a Panegyrick on Your Lordship, nor to Expatiate on the several Excellencies of this Celebrated Author: These are Subjects for the Sublimest Pens, and are already transmitted to Posterity.
But my design here, is to pay my Gratitude to Your Lord∣ship, for the many Favours I have receiv'd; In a Present whose own Worth, is its Apology, and whose Native Graces will ren∣der it Acceptable. And to add, if possible to the Fame of Purcell, and Endear him more to the World: Which can be only done, by prefixing the Name of Mountague to His Works.
My Lord,
