Not for thou hadst a Prince vnto thy Sire,
Nor, for thou hast a Monarch to thy friend,
Nor for thou dost to Honors heigth aspire,
Nor, for thou shouldst my Booke, or me defend,


Do I appropriate the same to Thee:
But, to this end, that while it liues, it may
Divulge how deere thou wert to worthlesse mee,
That tasted to thee this lov'd-lothd Essay.


Yet, if therein be ought that stirrs thy bloud
To boile with hat for thy wisht health vnfitt,
I haue it mixt I hope with so much good
As thou shalt haue no hurt by tasting it:


For, I would taste a great part of my Bane
Ere thou shouldst taste what should thee least depraue:
Sith thou helpst all (thy nature's so humane)
That (sick in mind) seeke what they ought to haue.


And where some Spirits, that rise from Holes obscure,
To Glories height, as proude, as scornefull proue,
(Till hate of all (Prides hire) their falles procure)
Thou GREATNESSE bearst as thee it could not moue.



Shewing the diff'rence ixt the highlie bore
(As noblie bredd) and those, in either, base:
For, HONORS Children do hi gracc adorne:
But, Basenesse Brattes Hir glorie quite disgrace.


Well knew that King▪ and great Philosopher
(Whose Armes of Loue, and Pow'r vphold thee will)
That Hee, on Thee did Honor well conferre,
Sith, with his grace, thou dost him honor still▪


Long may (much hono'rd Earle) that grace to Thee
Attaine increase, till the extremity
With vnremoued fauoue staied bee▪
The surest Staie of Earthes felicitie:
That after Ages may report, and see,
Kinge Iames made One, that God made greate to bee.



If I thy Bloud do kindly ware, ,
Warme my Sires Bloud with comfort of thy loue.
