My Lord,
YOur Lordships free acceptance of the Government of the Mines Royal, hath encouraged me to add it to your Ti∣tles, and I hope without the least disparagement to your other Honours, deservedly conferred upon your Lordship by His Majesty.
It is a Trust of great Concern (and I doubt not but it will be so managed by your Lordship) and of Honour too, (as it hath been always esteemed) for (not to trouble your Lordship with very Antient Records,) I find that King Edward the Fourth did make Richard Earl of Warwick (who soon after was made one of the Governors of this Kingdom, during its Troubles) and John Earl of Northumberland, his Guardians and Gover∣nors jointly of all his Mines in England; and King Henry the Seventh made Jasper Duke of Bedford, and other Earls and Lords, his Guardians also of all the Mines in England (ad∣ding Wales.)

And these I shall in due time communicate to your Lordship, being so confident of your Lordships great Abilities, (join'd with your perfect Loyalty to your King, and Love to your Country) that your Lordship will not approve of any thing that I shall of∣fer, if it agrees not with your Lordships sound Judgment and deep Wisdom, for which all who knows your Lordship have an high value, and particularly
