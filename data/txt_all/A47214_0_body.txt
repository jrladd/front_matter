Madam,
THe Poor Woman's Mite, cast into the Treasury of the Church, was not on∣ly Mark 12. 41, 42. accepted, but also commended by the Holy and ever-blessed JESƲS, who is Truth it self, and prime Author of that Truth, which under the Tutelage of your Majestie's truly Great, and Glorious Name, this small Treatise now publickly offers for the Good, and Eternal Wel∣fare of your Majesties Subjects, who can never be truly Happy without embracing
 the Truth of the Catholick, and Saving Faith of Christ. He, that will be happy in the end, (says Plato,) must lay hold on Truth in the beginning; And that all your Majestie's Protestant Subjects might attain to this Felicity, I am certain, is Your Majesties most Sincere and Gracious De∣sire; and it is the sole Design of this Book, wherein the Author endeavours to un-deceive the People, who hitherto have been mis-led into Errours, through the Ig∣norance of some, and the Malice and Avarice of others.
Dread Soveraign, to doubt of Pardon for the high Presumption of this Dedicati∣on unto your Sacred Majesty by so mean, and simple a Woman, as I am, were not only to doubt of your Superlative, well-known, and resplendent Goodness, but also to detract from the worth of a design so good in it self, and so congruous to the
 Christian Fervours of your Great and No∣ble Soul.
Wherefore, waving all puny Expres∣sions of that Nature, I will turn all my Excuses into Prayers for your Majestie's long Life and Prosperity, and humbly be∣seech the God of Truth to send, and con∣tinue the True Religion amongst Us, that the Stately Ship of your Majesties King∣doms and Dominions may always bear the happy Badge of Castor and Pollux; I mean, a happy Conjunction of Truth and Peace. And the Star of Jacob so guide the Course of our Royal Pylot (JAMES, the Great, the Good, and Just,) through the rough Seas of these latter Times, that He may safely Land the Ship of our Commonwealth in the fair Ha∣ven of Tranquility by the Actions of Peace and Prosperity; and may settle the State of the Church on those Mountains
 of Ararat, Grace and Glory, that by this Jacob's Ladder of Blessedness, God may always descend to Us in the Blessings of Peace; And We at last ascend to God by the Benefit of True Religion, which is, and will be ever the Cordial Wish, and Devout Prayer of
