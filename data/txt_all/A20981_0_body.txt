SYR: It hath pleased GOD, since my depar∣ture from the Colledge, to visit me with con∣tinuall sicknesse, (I am the man that hath seene affliction in the rod of his indignation,)
Lam. 3.1. a
Burning-Feuer, hauing for these nine Moneths exhau∣sted my body, and made it al∣most a Scheleton: All which time of my weaknesse, when my indisposition, by my cruell disease, would permit, my stu∣dy was wholy in the Psalmes of Dauid; a Booke fit for one in my case, being full of Psalmes of humiliation vn∣der Gods rod: what comfort I found therein, I feele in my soule, I neede not, I cannot expresse. Among many other Psalmes of sad subiect, I was much affected with the 79. Psalme, the reporter and be∣moner
of Ierusalems destru∣ction: an argument full of heauinesse, agreeable to my dull and sad disposition; on which Psalme I then concei∣ued some Meditations, which for some reasons, I am wil∣ling to impart to the world, and haue vowed in my selfe, if this first Essay be kindely accepted, to bestow now in my health, better paines vp∣on all the whole Booke of the Psalmes, and to make this Schedell a iust Volume. J pre∣sent it to you as the first fruits of my actiue life, be∣ing moued thereto by duety
and respect: and somewhat to incite you to make this Booke the obiect of your Contemplation.
Beleeue mee, Sir, other Bookes make men good Schol∣lers, but aboue all, the Booke of the Psalmes maketh men good Christians. I doubt not of the acceptance of this poore Mite, or the imploi∣ment thereof. God who hath giuen you in your youth, a sober and honest heart; giue also that by my vnworthy seruice, you may continue, increase, and grow olde in his Grace: so my study shall
be euer profitable, and you blessed. Which I heartily wish, and remaine
