SIR,
THE Ultimate and One∣ly Legitimate End of War is, or at least ought to be, among Christians, The Obtaining of a Good and Lasting Peace.
And the sole Right in Your Majesties Domini∣ons, of Making War and Peace, being One un∣doubted

Prerogative of Your Imperial Crown, I be∣liev'd a Treatise of the Art of War, written by One who has the Happiness to be born Your Subject; Ought, SIR, to be Dedicated Onely to You; Yet I durst not presume to do it, before I had most humbly beg'd and obtain'd Your Majesties Leave, to lay it at Your Feet.
I have, SIR, in the short Introduction to this Trea∣tise, lamented that none of Our English Generals, whom I know of, (except the Noble Sir Francis Vere) hath left to Posterity, his own Observations in War: When not Onely, no Nation (as I believe) hath Excell'd them in Military Conduct, in Success, and in Valor; But also when they had the Illustri∣ous Examples of divers great Captains, inviting them to do it, who, in many Ages past, and possibly in all succeeding Ones, will be at least as much esteemed and celebrated for their Commentaries, as for their Victories; since All who more desire to merit the Title of Commanders, than only to bear the Name,

will more Instructively read the Commentaries or Me∣morials of one famous General, written by himself; than All the Relations of Battels, Victories, and Con∣quests, written by the ordinary Historians: For they tell us chiefly but the Events of Wars, rarely the true Methods, the Arts, and the Industries, by which they have been managed; when the knowledge of these, is exceedingly more useful, than the knowledge of those.
I therefore most heartily wish, That the present Age, and the future, may owe to Your Majesty the preserving them henceforth from the like unhappiness, by Your expresly Ordering all such us hereafter shall have the Honor to Command Your Fleets or Armies, to Present You constantly in writing, and under their hands, a particular Account of all their most impor∣tant Actings, of their Observations in the War, and the Motives which induced them at any time to do as they did.
Such Memorials, in my humble Opinion, would be of eminent Advantage, to All those of the present

Times, to whom Your Majesty would vouchsafe to Communicate them; and to All those which in the Future should enjoy the Benefit of Perusing them.
It would more than probably, make All Your Maje∣sties chief Commanders the more circumspect in form∣ing their final Results, when they should know, that so Great and Exact a Iudge of Reason, as Your Ma∣jesty is, would still examine and weigh the validity of them.
For though it is too usually said by some, and be∣lieved by others, That Success does cover all the Faults and Errors in War▪ Yet doubtless the wiser Portion of Mankind, had much rather owe their Victories to their good Conduct, than to (what is ter∣med, by the World) their Good Fortune; Nay, had rather be less Successful, by stedily pursuing the Dictates of Right Reason, than be more Victorious, by declining them at any Time; Since Wise Coun∣cels are still within the Power of Wise Men; But Success is not.

And if I might presume to acquaint Your Ma∣jesty, with my humble Belief on this Subject, I durst say, That no Profession in the World, is more built on true Reason, and sound Iudgment, than the Mili∣tary is; For both those are essentially requisite, to Generals, and the chief Officers under them.
As some manifestation of this Truth, I shall par∣ticularize but one Instance, and that shall be in Bat∣tels; which are the most Glorious, and commonly the most important Acts of War; wherein usually the moments to obtain the Victory are so few, that while an unconsummated Reasoning is considering, the oppor∣tunity of acquiring it, is vanished.
So that even the Romans themselves; who were so jealous of what they call'd their Liberty, as though they dreaded to intrust the Supreme Power in One, yet they were never under Exigencies indeed, but they chose a Dictator; as is evident in the Cases of Quintus Cincinnatus, Furius Camillus, Fabius Maximus, and divers others; Necessity making them practice, what Reason could not induce them to confess.

Nor did the Grecians owe their famous Victory at Marathon, to their having Ten Generals; but to their Generals having that Reason, which the State of Athens wanted; The placing of the absolute Power in Miltiades.
All which seems, SIR, to evidence, That the management of War is Practically acknowledged to be best placed in One, if that One is blest with the highest humane Prerogative of Well-Reasoning; and therefore illustrates, That a good General ought to have a perfect and clear Understanding, else he will be too apt to imitate what others have done, merely be∣cause they did it.
Nor have I ever known or read of any famous Captain, who was not also a Person of strong Iudg∣ment, and blest with great Presence of Mind, on all Emergencies.
Yet we too often see, and I wish we may never feel, the fatal Effects of it; That in War, as in most other things, though of the nearest and highest

Concernment to us, we take upon Trust, and with an implicite Belief, whatever we are taught by those, under whom we learn our first Rudi∣ments.
Whereas if we would undergo the Duty, (I had almost said enjoy the Delight) solidly to examine the true Reason of Things, and then only embrace and practise what after such Inquiry, we were con∣vinced was the very best; we should be less Magiste∣rially imposed upon by others, and be more satisfied in what we our selves undertook.
I think, SIR, no rational and considering Man was ever convinced, merely by anothers saying, the Im∣perialists or the French, or any other Nation, do thus, and thus, in the Wars, unless withall he is ac∣quainted and satisfied, with the Reasons why they do it; For Reason, not Custom singly, is what considering Men will only follow, and the chearfullest Attempts are animated from first convincing of the Iudg∣ment.

I know, SIR, the Art of War has been in many Ages, Alter'd, Cultivated, and Heighten'd; Yet no Monarch, State, or General, though never so Ab∣solute, did ever make any considerable Alterations in the Military methods of his Countrey, but Reason was produced, or at least pretended, to Authorize Them.
Whatever conduces most to bring all things to be weighed in that Ballance, is what I would Promote; I have, SIR, much Reverence for Old Customs, but much more for Reason; so that had I had the misfortune to have been born and educated in Spain, yet I am confident I should not now have been for Arming the Cavalry with Lances, or for Charging the Ordnance, in a Sea-fight, Over-deck.
If Reason will not make Men change irrational Customs, Losses will; which are the usual Converters of all those, on whom Ratiocination at first does not operate.
I have designed this whole Treatise shall consist of Two Tomes, partly because it will be too Voluminous

in One, but chiefly to know if the first may have the Honor and Happiness, to be acceptable to Your Ma∣jesty; since the onely Rule I have set up to my self, of liking or disliking any thing I do, is, As Your Majesty shall Approve or Disapprove it.
I have prepared the chief Materials for the re∣maining Tome, in which is to be contained the Greatest, the most Useful, and the most Intricate parts of the Art of War.
If this now Publish'd shall be blest with Your Majesties Favor, I shall have therein the highest En∣couragement, to proceed; but if it is not, I shall have more reason to Apologize for having written so much, than to do it for writing no more.
I was not induced to undertake this VVork, at the Importunity of many Friends; nor by the Flatte∣ry of divers others, who endeavor'd to persuade me it might be of some Use to Your Majesties Subjects; nor yet to evidence, (when Your Majesty had as much above my Desert, as Expectation, rais'd me by Your Letters Patents, to be the Major General of Your

Majesties Army in Ireland,) I had not intirely ne∣glected to study the Duties and Knowledge of the Military Art, (though possibly this last might have been no unpardonable Design) but the chief Ends which induced me to compose this Treatise, were Two:
The first was, That to perform the VVork well, was highly desirable; and I would provoke others to do, what, I acknowledge, I am only able to at∣tempt.
The second was, That as from the first Time I had the Blessing to know Your Majesty, and the high Honor to be employ'd by You, (which having been both at one and the same time, I might be proud of it with more Reason, than I could be condemn'd for being so) I paid my healthful Time to Your Service; so now I would humbly endeavor to evidence to Your Majesty, and to all others, that I Dedicate my sickly Time to the same Duty, whereby all the Parts of my Life, will appear Devoted to Your Service, which cannot be more the Debt, than to dis∣charge

it acceptably, is and will be, to the last moment of my Life, the utmost Endeavor, and the highest Satisfaction of,
May it Please Your Most SACRED MAJESTY;
