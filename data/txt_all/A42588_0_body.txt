Madam,
YOur Honors constant and chearful at∣tendance to these plain Truths when delivered in your Family, did then incourage me in that Work, and now to present them to your Ho∣nour; not doubting but
you will cordially receive the Truths, though cover∣ed with an ordinary dress, & judg of them according to the End for which they were written (which was the good of yours & your sweet Childrens Souls) and the sincere desires that accompany them, that they may prove effectual to that end.
What I have here writ∣ten, your Honour can much more perfectly teach us by your own ex∣perience, the Lord having by his gracious Providence made you the Daughter of holy Parents, who prayed
for you, instructed you, and from a Child made you acquainted with the Scriptures; and blessing their Endeavours made you a godly Child, and gave you the same unfai∣ned Faith that dwelt in your Father and Mother; and made you now the gratious Mother of many sweet Children, whom I hope the Lord will bless with his Grace, according to your earnest desires and endeavours. Be incoura∣raged to trust God with them, & to believe that he will bless them (being your Children, and the Grand-children
of those eminent godly Persons) and bring them to know him, that they may be blessed for ever. Now the Lord bless you, and the fruit of your Womb, that all your chil∣dren may fear him, & grant that his grace may run in your Family for ever; and that you and all yours may be eternally happy, shall be the prayers of him that de∣sires an Interest in your prayers, and shall for ever be, Madam,
Jan. 1.
