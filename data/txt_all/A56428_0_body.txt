SIR,
IF I were minded to Imitate the Antient Writers, who (to be sure of a free passage for the Works they were to present to the publick View of the World,) would Con∣secrate them to some special Divinity; To the end, that bearing the Name and Marks of that supreme power, they might be out of the reach of all Censures: If I were willing to follow the steps of our Modern Au∣thors, who dare not expose to light the verities of Salvation, if they be not seated near some Throne, whose dreadful Authority might frighten such as would presume to prosecute with Invectives, those that do openly Preach the Word of the Cross; I should be in a safe

Harbour, and sufficiently shelter'd, both from the one and the other. Having adorn'd the Front of this little Work, with the marks of Your Grandeur: For though You are no Di∣vinity, You do partake in a high degree the Sacred Lineaments of one. The Antiquity as well as the Nobility of Your Illustrious Fa∣mily, which has Enrich'd all Histories with the Renown'd Feats of Your Ancestors, (the Rank wherein Your Birth, and Divine Pro∣vidence has plac'd You to be the Best of Kings, a Model of Piety for all Princes, the Virtuous and War-like Caesar of the most Flourishing Kingdoms of the World) are to Me a sufficient Argument of Your Participated Divinity: Who then shall be able to violate the Rights of Your Protection? Or where could I with more assurance withdraw to shelter my Self from the Enemies of Innocency, than under the shadow of so Great a Monarch, at whose Feet we have seen all the Venomous Darts of Envy, Ill-wishes and Malice, that Your Private and Publick Enemies could let fly at You, drop down, to their own Confusion, and the greater Lustre of Your Glory: So that the World may learn hereafter, (by the tender Care which the Heavens have, and always had of Your Sacred Person) how vain it is to strive against Him, whom the Powerful Hand of God does Protect.
There is nothing of a Prodigy that appears to our Eyes, but hath its Effects soon or late,

good or evil: The Prodigies which appear'd in the Skies over the City of Jerusalem, were the fore-runners of the general Destruction of that unfortunate place: The Blazing-Star which appear'd to the three Western Kings, brought the Happy News of a New-born Sa∣viour to those poor Pagans who liv'd in the Darkness of Idolatry for so many years: And this which appear'd of late days, did (as we may reasonably conclude) Prognosticate the Gracious and Happy end of Charles II. Your dearly beloved Brother, as also Your Lawful and Peaceable Possession of the Crown, a main Blessing which the Heavens were pleas'd to confer on You for all Your Sufferings, both at Home and Abroad with that unspeakable Pa∣tience, and full Resignation to God's Decrees.
Now Your Subjects may rejoyce to see themselves Govern'd by a King whom God has Adorn'd with all necessary Prerogatives to compleat a Monarch: The Queen of Sheba (if now living) might set forth with all her Attendance, and Accompany the rest of the Princes and Potentates of the World, to Con∣gratulate Your Coronation, and admire the Virtuous and Prudent Oeconomy of Your Court and Government. These should be sufficient Motives to bring this little Work before Your Throne, with all Humility to beg the Favour of Your Gracious Counte∣nance; But that Two other Powerful Con∣siderations lays (by Duty) that Obligation

on me to crave it: The one, is, The gene∣ral Resentment which I shall harbour in my Heart for ever, (with all them of my Profes∣sion,) of the Good Will which You have; and always had from Your Infancy for our Irish Nation, whose Foreign or Domestick Ene∣mies could never bring You to an underva∣luing of their Service, no more than their venomous Reflections to the least mistrust of their True and constant Affection. Wherefore as nature does Print in the very Substance of every particular a special feeling of what ever Favour is done to the whole Body, I think it a Duty incumbent on me, as being a Member of that Your Loyal and always Well-affected Nation, to resent and acknowledge Your Kindness, and all Your Good Wishes for them, by offering up my most Humble and Earnest Addresses to the Almighty for Your long Life, and Happy Reign.
The other, is the special Kindness I receiv'd at Your Hands in France by the Mediation of Major Francis Pluncket, and Captain Michael Brett, both Your Majesties Loyal Subjects, and Well-beloved Officers; whose Love and Care of Me was so great, as being their near Relation; that they procur'd me a Letter of Recommendation from Your Majesty, which prov'd so Efficatious, as to get Me into a Col∣ledge upon Sight, and without any further delay: All the Thunder-bolts of Heaven would be too too little to be pour'd down up∣on

me for a just Revenge, if I should not make a large Acknowledgment of those Ex∣traordinary Favours. The offer I make You of these first Fruits of my Studies, may pass (I hope) for a sincere Act of my Acknow∣ledgment; not that I think my self acquitted of my Debt, (for I do esteem my self most Happy to live in the Impossibilities of doing it;) But only to call the Publick as Wit∣nesses of my Endeavours; to the end, that my Will (acknowledging the Power which is wanting in Me,) may be freed from all blame on this Subject, wherein I shall never suffer my self to be made Criminal.
Accept then most Gracious Prince of this Work, which I thought to be the more con∣formable to Your Inclinations, since You have always endeavour'd to maintain the Glory of God against all the sinful practices of the cor∣rupt Age we live in. Moreover, being that the Conversion of Souls, (the Hereditary Im∣ployment of all Godly Princes) holds the first rank amongst the Honourable Spoils of our Saviours Victories.
This first Part, (which discovers the won∣derful beginning and Progress thereof;) will supply (on one side) the Insufficiency of the Author in the Merit of his Subject; And on the other, will be able to invite Your Majesty to spare some Moments from the croud of o∣ther Important Affairs, to consider the Con∣nection of it. 'Tis in that belief, that, (joyning

my particular wishes to the common Vows of all Your Well-beloved Subjects of Ireland) I beg the Divine Majesty, to Bless, Protect and Preserve many years Your Sacred Per∣son, Your Gracious Consort Queen Mary, the Happy Off-spring of that most Virtuous and Antient Family of Modena; together with all your Royal Progeny, to which, I Pray God grant a further Increase, that the Name of STƲART may Rule over the Lyons, Regulate the Leopards, receive the Fragrant Scent of the Lillies, and keep the Harp in a Pleasant Tune to the Worlds end: These are the Hearty Wishes of
