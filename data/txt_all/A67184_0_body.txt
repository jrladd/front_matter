My LORD,
WHAT I now present to Your Lord∣ship is wholly in Obedience to Your De∣sires, which are so far a Command to me, as to prevail against mine own Inclinations, rather than seem backward to comply with any request wherein You are pleased to judge my slender Abilities serviceable to Your Lordship; and chuse rather to ex∣pose my Self and Performances, than be thought want∣ing in any instance of Obedience and Deference, wherein I may express my Obligations to Your Self and Noble Family.
I should be glad of a more welcome Opportunity of gi∣ving publick Testimony of my Respects, than such as ad∣ministers occasion of Sadness, and revives the afflicting Sense of Your Grief and Loss; and am sorry it falls again to my Lot at once to Address and Condole: Yet withal shall reckon my self happy, if my Endeavours may prove satisfactory, especially in doing Right to the Me∣mory
 of that Great Man, who I am sensible wanted a better Orator, and deserved a more ample Character.
But if what I have said of him may contribute to the Honour of his Memory, and make his Name survive among the Worthies of his Age; or the Influence of his Example may create emulation in any to write after his Copy; and more especially, if what I have discoursed on this Subject may tend to the instruction of others, and promote the designs of Piety, and Regular Conversation; I have my design, and let God have the glory.
But I will not be troublesome to Your Lordship in tendring an Apology, when I have resolved to submit the Performances entirely to Your disposal; and hope Your Honour will pardon my prefixing Your Name to what you have so great a right and interest in; and which has no other design, than to let the World know how much I am,
My LORD,
