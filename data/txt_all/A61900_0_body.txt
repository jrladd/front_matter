Gentlemen,
THE Importunity of Friends, is gene∣rally suspected to be but a feign'd Apology of some conceited Writers, for the Publi∣cation of their darling Conceptions; and where its more than a mere pretence, I must confess my self of the Opinion, That 'tis one of the weakest Mo∣tives, for a Man's exposing of himself, that can be: By signifying openly the repeated Requests of both Parishes for the Printing this Sermon of Con∣firmation, (it must be own'd) I clear my self suf∣ficiently from the former Imputation; But how I shall get rid of the other Charge I know not, Tho' I should declare, That you back'd your Requests with an Intimation, that ye thought it not only a Seasonable Discourse, but a very serviceable one too: For, however the First part of the Character may be applicable enough to it, with respect to the Time when, and occasion on which 'twas Preach'd, I cannot be so fond of this mean, hasty Performance,
as to think the rest of the World will be so chari∣table, as ye have been, in admitting of the latter: But, whatever success it may have abroad, I am glad it had its intended effect at home; which was, To make you still more enamour'd with, and bene∣fited by one of the Pious Constitutions of our Esta∣blished Church; for which in General (I cannot without the highest Ingratitude, omit this Oppor∣tunity of Publishing it) ye have many of you a profound Veneration. That God Almighty would confirm you all every Day more and more in this just Esteem for her Principles and Practices, i.e. That he would daily strengthen you all in the Faith profess'd by her once deliver'd to the Saints, and that ye may have such a right Judgment to follow her respe∣ctive Injunctions, as may settle in every one of your Breasts a firm Peace here, and procure for you ever∣lasting Happiness hereafter, is the hearty desire, and shall be (whilst amongst you) the continued Endeavour of him, who professes himself with the greatest Sincerity,
