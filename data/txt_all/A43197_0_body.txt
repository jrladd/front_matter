My Lord,
WHEN I consider upon what Treacherous Ground Our present State does stand, through needless Fears, unnecessary Jealousies, and hot-brain'd Reflections, I think it my Duty, and every Good Christian's to call out vigorously for a helping Hand: And, To whom should we call, but to those Men, who have shewn Themselves serviceable on the like Occasion? To those Men, who have ventured their Lives and Fortunes, to stem the Tide of Insulting Danger, which Our Enemies drove forwards; whereof Your Lordship is undeniably One of the most Eminent? Upon this Score it is, that I dare Affix so noble a Frontispiece to my VVeak Endeavours: Upon this Score it is, I challenge so Honou∣rable a Patron as Your Lordship, who is a Known Example, and an Admired Encourager of Those, who are truly Loyal to their King, and Sincere Lovers of their Country: Of which Number, I profess my Self One; and therefore, am the Bolder to enter into Your Honor's Presence, to implore Your Favourable Protection.
It was the Saying of a Learned Politician, and a much Esteemed Author; That to write of Modern Times (or Men,) is a trou∣blesome Business: All Men (sayes he) commit Errors; few, having committed Them, will hear of it. Present Actions are not with Safety related, nor are they listned unto without Danger.
Well may they be Reverenced, never Censured. VVho puts them in Print, seeks after an uncertain Glory, and exposes Him∣self to a certain Danger. VVho leaves it to be done by Po∣sterity, reaps no other Fruit of his Present Labours, than the mear Contemplation of a future, imaginary, fruitless Glory, &c.
BUT with his Leave; If every Private Man, is a Member of the whole Body Politick, and consequently must bear a Share in the Publick Good or Ill, as every Part in the Indisposition of the Body Natural is sensibly touch't; I say, It is the Indispensible Duty of every Private Per∣son, to endeavour the Healing Publick Breaches, the Composing Diffe∣rences, and Removing all Mis-understandings, which might disturb the Peace of the Government, and obstruct the Common Wellfare: Though with this Restriction, That he shall not pretend either to Instruct his Prince; or, by prying into His Councel, betray the Failures, or derogate from His Authority-Poyal.
My Lord,
I HAVE Compiled this Short Essay, as a small Echantil∣lon of my Love and Zeal for my Country's Good and Peace; and have compared Times past with the Times present, the several Revolutions of Our Present Affairs, with the sad Cata∣strophe's Forty Years since; and, as near as may be, taken an Impartial View of the various Methods, which led us to our Then Ruine; and, Similibus juxta se positis, Surveyed our Own: And, I think, we may say with the Heathen-Poet, Etas parenturn pejor Avis.
This little Piece I have thrown amongst many Others into the Pub∣lick Treasury, under Your Noble Protection, as a small Acknowledgment likewise of Your Lordship's former Favours, which You were pleased to Confer upon me: Begging Your Lordship's Pardon for This Presumption of Him, who is ever obliged to Stile Him∣self,
My Lord,
