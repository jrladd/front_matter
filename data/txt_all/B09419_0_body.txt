REader, which of the two soever you are, I have a double word to offer to your considera∣tion; First that the undertaking of this work to express this accomodation for the benefit of the American plantations, in both Spirituals and Temporals, is not a thing that I under∣took in my own strength, or for any base ends of my own: But (as the Lord can bear me witness that I ly not) upon the hearing the minister in publique the last Lords day stir up every one to indeavor the exaltation of Christ in his proper place, internally and externally, I conceiv'd it a duty incumbent upon me to offer my two mites to the Lords treasury, if it might be acceptable to him, having nothing else wherewith to honour him at present; or if it might be profitable for my longed-for friends in Virginia, who have been often, in my weak measure and manner (though an unworthy wretch) presented at the Throne of Grace by me, That God of his infinite riches and glory by Christ would sup∣ply all their needs; and being by so many years experience ac∣quainted what was that necessary thing that conduceth to their eternal well-being and yet there wanting, I have here presented you (as the Lord inabled me) with what I humbly conceive (ever submitting to better Judgements) may be the best expe∣dient to accomplish the happiness of that place. Secondly, I must answer the unsatisfyed Reader, who knew my former con∣versation, both there, and here; and how unsuitable it hath been to what I here present; That though he might say, Physici∣an heal thy self, or, Hypocrite first pull the beam out of thine own eye, &c. I confess what was my sin; which as it hath been my shame, so it is (through grace) and will be the subject of my sorrow. that I have walked so disorderly; But I hope (through great grace) by Christ Iesus, I have and shall obtain mercy, and

enjoy favor with the Father, and fellowship in the Spirit with the Son, and Saints; and that henceforth he will shew me (for my self) the comming in and the going out, and fashion of his Temple; that henceforth he will sanctifie me, and preserve me blameless to the comming of his Son, to the praise of the glory of his grace; and therefore I beseech you my friends, both of Virginia, and of my Native Countrey, who have seen my out∣goings, not to be grieved in spirit at my undertaking of this.
For as I conceive my self bound by duty to undertake this task, so I conceived there was a great deal of equity in it, both toward the Lord, and towards you of Virginia, and also you of my Native Countrey; that as I have been notoriously e∣vil to the dishonor of God, and the discredit of the Gospel before you, so I might be notably instrumental (if the Lord please) to promote his praises in Virginia in the first place; and afterward (it lyeth upon my thoughts, and I do believe it will be accom∣plished) that I shall do the like in my own Native Countrey; so that both places shall see the glory of his free grace to me, and learn to love and fear, believe and close with the Lord of Love and Life. I beseech you then without prejudice reeeive these weak exhibitions of my duty and love to my God, my Countrey, and my Friends, and pardon what is amiss, and pray for him that would fain be found walking in the truth, whilest he is,
From my Chamber at the Flying-Post in White Fryers, London, this 6th. of October, 1653.
