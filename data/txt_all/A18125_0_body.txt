Right worshipfull:
I Doe vnfainedly professe my selfe for euer bound vnto you, for your vndeserued goodnesse towards me, and your forward and willing inclination to entertaine me into your fauour. Which, as it doth require and challenge from mee all respectfull acknow∣ledgement: so am I willing to take any occasion to witnesse the same, and for that cause am bold to present this small discourse vnto your Patro∣nage, as a pledge of my vnfained thankeful∣nesse: humbly desiring you to yeelde vnto it your fauourable acceptance, vntill such time as
heereafter, I shall by some better meanes giue more pregnant testimony of my thankefull minde and dutifull deuotion. In the meane time I shall endeuour myselfe to deserue your good fauours, and will not cease to pray that the Almighty God may multiply vpon you and yours all the blessings and honours of this life, and after this life crowne you with immortall glory in CHRIST JESVS.
