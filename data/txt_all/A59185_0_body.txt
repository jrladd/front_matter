MY LORD,
A Part of Old Seneca presents it self by my Hand to your Lordships Patronage. I should justly blush at such a mean Return to your Lordships many Favours, had I not read how the Spanish Monarch, who Commands the Indies, accepts the Biscains Homage in the worthless Present of a few Maravidis, nor is the Gift ungrateful to him, since it speaks Subjection: In like manner my Lord, my only Anbition in this Dedication is to appear your Servant. I know your Lordships Goodness will pardon my Confident Address: 'Tis that Ob∣leiging Nature, so radicated in the Sherards, hat Commands the hearts of all men: 'Tis that which makes your Country truly Yours, And thus my Lord, you serve his Majesty both with your own and their Affections. Such is your

generous English way of true endearment. But I must despair to speak your full worth in the narrow limits of a few Pages; Should I attempt to blazon your just value, it would extend this small Epistle to a Volume, and swell this lirtle Volume to a Folio. The following Papers I submit to your free Censure; And if they prove so bappy to attain any Degree in your Lordships favour, I shall despise the malice of all our little Critiques, who never exposing any thing of their own, (and so in no danger of Retaliation) make it their business to pique at every thing is pub∣lisht. But how e're this Book Succeeds, the Authors chief happiness is above their preju∣dice, which is, to be
My Lord,
