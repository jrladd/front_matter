MOst worthy Sir, according to my Dream,
I speak of Shepherds, and of Shepherds Swain;
Into your gentle hands, Sir, I do commit,
Iohn Elliot the Laird of Thorilshope,
And Sir, I do hope that ye'l not dissallow,
That I have been so bold to dedicat him to you,
For a man must more than humane wit possess,
To escape the Baits and Snares of wickedness,
The Artist of the Scripture can dispute the same,
That one would deem him a Religious Man;
Since that God gave Life to Herbs, and Plants, and Trees,
A beast hath Sense, and Life, Moves, Feels and Sees,
For if they wanted Life, how could they then grow,
And in some sort, do both good and evil know;
But man he is before all Creatnres in degrees,
God, Life, Sense, and Reason, He unto him gives;
And least that these blessings should be transitory;
He gave him Life and Sense, Reason, Grace and Glory;
So I hope Thorlishope shall keep his Golden-fleece,
As glorious as Iason did his in Greece.
