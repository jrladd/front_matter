TO THEE O IESVS CHRIST, Son of the living God, and borne of the Virgin Mary, Lord of the living and of the dead, Doe I with Teares and Groanes, Give, Dedicate, and Consecrate These my CONTEMPLATIONS and SIGHES: And doe begge and beseech thee that thou wilt make them unto mee

A helpe in my life,
A comfort at my death,
My protection in Iudgement.
