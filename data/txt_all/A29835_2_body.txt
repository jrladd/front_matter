My LORD,
SInce we generally do mea∣sure the Greatness of the Sun by the Shadow of the

Earth, and his Goings in the Dyal by the little Thred thereof; Those vacant Hours of Leisure which I catcht at Windsor this last Summer, were the only Wings which gave first flight to my design in giving a Shape or Form to this Strumous Discourse; a Disease as Ʋniversal as any other whatsoever in our Age. In this therefore I have pre∣sumed to present your Lord∣ship with the Differences, Causes, Symptoms, Presa∣ges, and Cure thereof, ac∣cording to the best Medical and Chirurgical Method. And since I have shewn that

the Court is extreamly visi∣ted with this Popular Dis∣ease, and a multitude of poor People do give His Ma∣jesty trouble too oft for Cu∣ring their Diseases, they will have to be the Evil, al∣though not really so, save on∣ly in their own Conjectures; I have herein undertaken to unmask the same in that Or∣der, and give it that Light, that the Meanest Capacity may become a good Judge thereof.
As my Obligations there∣fore to your Lordship are as well known to the World as great in themselves, so I hope

I may not appear troublesome in making a publick Expres∣sion of my Gratitude to your Honour, and humbly crave Protection under your Wing for this my Scrophulated Treatise; whereby your Lordship will let the World see, how great a Master of Condescention you are, in giving Countenance to this Design, Life to my Adven∣ture, and Breath to my De∣dication.
The whole Kingdom knows your Lordships Integrity to your Prince, in the Eminent Place of Trust your Honour enjoys, your Steddiness and

Constancy in that Religion we do profess; your Prowess, Justice, Piety, Temperance and Prudence, are as so ma∣ny Illustrious Gems of your Great Name; all which do both sweeten your Noble Nature, appear as Lawrels to your Virtue, and true He∣ralds of your Perspicuous Lustre.
If your Lordship will please to favour this Address with your Honourable Ac∣ceptance, and pretermit the Lapses both of the Author and his Discourse, this will infinitely secure me from the hard censure of others, and

make me ever more study how to declare my self,
My Lord,
