Honoured Sir,
I Have presumed to Dedicate these my labours to you, being the Translation of a most Worthy and Learned Author, Dr. Tho. Willis his Works, out of the Latine into our Mother Tongue, for the be∣nefit of my Country-men: and knowing you have al∣ways been a general, and generous Patriot, a lover of your Country, and of all manner of Industry and Inge∣nuity, I question not, but you will kindly receive this my Dedication; though not for my sake, yet for the many admirable things that may be found in the Book it self, and for the good and benefit, which this my laborious task may bring to the publick. As I doubt not of your innate Goodness, having already had some particular experience thereof, so I shall no ways fear an unkind reception: And although I launch not into the sea of your Praises, as is the late custom of Dedicators to do, I am perswaded, that this my plain Epistle will be as kindly accepted; for I know you to be so mo∣dest a Man, as not to love to see all your good Acti∣ons, Virtues and worth, Rhetorically painted and laid open before your Eyes: for as your Worth is too well known, this way to receive any addition; so the praise thereof being needless, will rather cause you to blush, than be any ways pleas'd. But yet I cannot forbear to take notice to the World, that your whole Life has

been a true pattern of Loyalty and Religion, which in these troublesome and distracted times, may be worthily related and mentioned, as a praise-worthy Example for others to imitate and follow: and that you are both a true lover of the Church of England, your King, and Country, which you have eminently shew'd in all your Actions, and manifested to the World, by your several publick Employs, in the behalf of your Coun∣try, and of the Renowned City of London, of which you are a most worthy Member. And no doubt, but that it is for this your stedfastness in Religion, your Loyalty to your Prince, your Love to your Country, and your uprightness in your Dealings, that God hath showered on you all manner of external Blessings, giv∣ing you a fair Estate, through your own Industry, Wisdom, and Prudence, a Virtuous Consort, and a prosperous Issue, the fair and flourishing Branches of your Ancient Stock and Family: To all which outward felicities, I shall pray, That God may also indue your noble Soul with the Celestial and Eternal Blessings and treasures of the World to come, and that you may be constantly happy both here and hereafter. I remain,
Honoured Sir,
