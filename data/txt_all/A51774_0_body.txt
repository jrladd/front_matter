SIR,
THis Narrative should have had like its Author, too much Humility to presume into Your Sacred Maje∣sties Presence; but that it is war∣ranted by Your Royal Commands; and that all the Actions of my Life are Dedicated to Your Service.
The Subject is indeed one of the most considera∣ble, that hath happened upon the Stage of the World of late Ages; where Kings, were both Agressors and Defendants. And this may in some sort war∣rant its Dedication to that Monarch, who is pro∣per Ʋmpire of the Controversies of Christen∣dome.
Besides, there was no Prince, nor scarce any State in Europe of note, that was not a Party in the quarrel. Nay, Your Majesties own Fleets, and Your Treasures were employed there, though not by Your Orders: And Your Majesties happy Restauration, had so much natural Influence upon the transactions in the North, that it also resto∣red those Crowns to that Peace they now enjoy.
If the English did not alwayes follow their true Interest in those parts, 'tis not to be wondered at, being they prostituted it so unnaturally at home; which did continue, until the sense of their Faults and Errors, obliged them to re-assume it, by retur∣ning to their Duty and Obedience to Your Majesty.
All I will say for my Self is, that as I cannot tell whether my humble Reverence for Your Maje∣sties Person, or my Loyalty and Allegiance for my Soveraign be the greater, so they shall ever remain by an equal intermixture of Passion and Duty, in
SIR,
