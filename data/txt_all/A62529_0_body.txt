My Friend,
ACcording to your de∣serts and desires, I here present to you some broken Thoughts, di∣rections, remembrances, references, for the better improve∣ment of your Solitudes and retire∣ments for Meditation and Reading. I have ranked them under severall heads, given you but briefe hints, leaving the enlargements to your own thoughts; what more might be required, you may supply from the Scriptures, your Sermon-Notes, and those good books, to which I have re∣ferred you: Each SECTION (after that you have perused the whole) af∣fords you matter enough for one So∣litary season at the least; and when
you have done with this, you may have more, as God gives opportunity. I begin with the subject of Conver∣sion, Regeneration, and the first work, if it suit not your concition, you may commend it to such as you love and know may need it. I leave it with you as a token of my respects for you and your Spirituall concernments. God give his blessing to it, and if it any way help you in your Meditation and Rea∣ding, I shall desire no more then your remembrances of me at the throne of Grace.
