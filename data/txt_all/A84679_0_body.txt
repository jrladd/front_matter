SIR,
I Must either without prolixity, or flattery, confesse that I have received from time to time very many singular and large favours from you and truly I was thinking and preme∣ditating with my selfe, what I might do to make it manifest appeare. I willingly would make re∣quitall, in some measure, if I were able, and yet this Duty troubled me the lesse, in regard with noble and Heroick Minds, still for the most part, where the deed is wanting, the Will compleats the Worke. Yet I must confesse 'tis very meet, that Charities eyes be open as well as her hands; though she gives away the Branches, not to part with the Root. Honour'd Sir, I do ingeniously confesse my selfingag'd to you, & for your Love: you may conceive it strange I should
 present you with a present that you do not love; yet Kind Sir, so it is, for I have tendred to you both the excesse of Wine, and a Company of Wanton Women, and how you do affect the one or respect the other▪ your Life and Conversation certificats, as farre as Phebus commonly doth lend his Glorious and most Radiant Rayes. I would your unworthy Servant were as free, for I must confesse both to Gods glory and my owne ignomie, unlesse he please to cover it with the Mantle of Christs mercy, that the excesse of VVine, inordinate affections, chambering and wantonnesse, hath bin habituall with me; but I hope that it will be sufficient, that I have spent the time past of my Life, walking in Wanton∣nesse, Riot, Surfeting, and Drunkennesse. Hon∣our'd Sir, I doubt I am too tedious, I am sure I have bin so in my Transgressions: Yet ere I part, I would intreat your lenity to patronizle my little small Enchiridion, whilst I by Gods assist∣ance shall endeavour to improve my interest in the Lord, and my favour in your Love, And Rest
