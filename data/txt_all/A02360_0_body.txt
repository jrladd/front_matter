HIpponicus the Sonne
of Hippias, a citizen
of Athens, hauing
decreed and appoin∣ted
to erect and dedicate a cer∣taine
Image vnto his natiue soile,
as a testimony and manifestation,
of his ardent loue, dutifull affecti∣on,
and gratitude towardes the
same, was counselled and impor∣tunately

perswaded by his friends
and kinsfolks (who did heare of
his immutable determination
thereunto) to giue out the same
to be framed & made by Polycle∣tus,
(an excellēt grauer of Images
in those times) but he greatly dis∣assenting
from their opinion, and
reiecting their importunate per∣swasions,
answered them; that in
doing so, he should exhibit to the
eyes of Athens, an image or re∣presentation,
rather of the excel∣lent
Art of Polycletus, the Image
maker, then (according to his in∣tention)
the image & manifesta∣tion
of his owne loue, regard, and
affection; & that likewise it might
bee that Athens so should rather
respect the one, then perceiue so
well or regard the other: and
therefore hee had decreed, to ma∣nifest
his own affection or heart,
by his owne hand, perswading

himselfe, that the whole, to wit,
the manifestation howsoeuer, as
his loue manifested, proceeding
both from himselfe, would bee
more acceptable to his Atheni∣ans,
then the exact arte of expert
Polycletus; and that not hauing
great occasion to fixe their eyes
onely vpon the exquisite worke
of the image or representation, to
say, who wrought it? they would
onely behold the ardent affecti∣on
represented of him who dedi∣cated
the same: So likewise with
Hipponicus, after long and earnest
wishing of an occasion, whereby
I might in some sort also, mani∣fest
and testifie my dutifull affec∣tion,
regard, remembrance, and
gratitude; which I owe to the
Athens of my birth & education,
as a small riuer returning to his
Ocean. I haue decreed to erect
and dedicate vnto the same, as an

image and plainer manifestation
of my loue, (being a young man
my selfe) this image and repre∣sentation
of a godly and Chri∣stian
young man, trying his waies,
and by earnest inquiring in con∣solatiō
with God, shewing where∣by
or how to redresse the same, to
wit, in taking heede thereto, accor∣ding
to Gods word. vnto the which
examplar, I wish that euery yong
man may (as he should) cōforme
himselfe; & being inuaded or ne∣uer
so little stung, with the poiso∣nable
& serpentine lusts of youth,
whereof this wildernesse is so ful,
he may vnto this image, erected
in Gods word, lift vp his eyes,
thereby & therein beholding his
dutie, and the safetie of his soule,
which (with Hipponicus) I per∣swade
my selfe likewise, that it
shall be so in loue accepted of my
natiue Athens and Athenians, as

in loue, and a testimonie of my
loue, I dedicate the same vnto
them. In the framing whereof,
albeit the exact arte of Polycletus
be wanting, and is not to bee ex∣pected,
yet with him, without
any suspecting of the contrarie, I
doe assure and perswade my selfe,
that the loue of the Dedicatour
with his intention to manifest &
testifie hereby the same, will bee
more respected and weighed in
the ballance of reciprocall loue,
(which couereth many infirmi∣ties)
then the Image thereof dedi∣cated,
or manner of testification
howsoeuer. In the which assu∣rance
and perswasion, I doe rest,
repose, secure & satisfie my selfe;
desiring withall, and earnestly
wishing, that the almightie God
of Israel, who neither slumbe∣reth
nor sleepeth, may euer bee
the watch-man and wall of the

Citie, with the snne of his loue,
and sincere trueth of his Sonne,
that hee may euer shine in and
vpon it, that the Candlesticke
thereof may neuer bee remoued,
nor the Chariots and Horsemen
thereof taken away, but his bles∣sings
may bee vpon his peo∣ple
externally, internal∣ly,
eternally,
Amen.
