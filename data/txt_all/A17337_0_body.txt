RIght Noble Lord, it is the
custome of ignorant and
vnlearned statuaries (who
are both defectiue in art and
faultie in iudgement) when they haue
either a Venus to carue, or a Cupid to
pollish, to find means to reare them on
some high marble pillers, to the end
that the distance of the eie might sha∣dow
the defect of their cunning. In
imitation of whom (knowing mine
owne disabilitie to deserue, and weake∣nesse
to achieue) hauing hewen out of
my rough wit this first fruit of mine o∣ratory,
I haue thought good to ground
and rear them vpon the authority and
greatnes of your Lordship, whose fa∣uors
and merits may aduance them to

that degree and esteeme of reputation,
which of themselues they dispaire of,
except vnder your fauour and counte∣nance.
The reason why I make you
my patron is for that I know you to be
a auourer of the learned, and a main∣tainer
of the souldior; discreet in your
iudgement, and bountiful to all toward
and deseruing scholers. Vouchsafe ho∣norable
lord, that your generall affabi∣litie
and courtesie towards all men, ad∣mit
no instance in my behalfe, but as
both by bountie and other infinit gra∣ces
toward me you haue made me for∣tunate,
so now in countenancing this
labour of mine, make me happie by
your acceptance, who humbly be∣seech
almightie God to ioine
intire felicitie to your
manie vertues.
