WOrthy Sir,
(Of whom being lo∣ued for the truth, J may and must professe with the
 beloued Disciple,2. Ioh. ver. 1. that I loue you in the truth; and not J only, but also all that haue knowne your vnfained loue vnto the truth.
As you were the meanes to bring these Meditations vnto the hearing of many; so now they are not lesse glad, then bold, vnder your name to offer themselues to the view of all. Wherein my desire and ayme hath beene, to direct both the worldly hypocrite, and the weak Christian, in the search and knowledge of himselfe. A point of no lesse difficultie, then
 necessitie: but the same light of the Word, that sheweth vs the necessitie, doth also aide vs against the difficultie; teach∣ing both the Hypocrite to iudge of his worldly, though disgui∣sed, disposition, and the weake Christian to descrie his happie, though concealed, condition. The one, by his treasure, laid vp on earth, is led to the know∣ledge of his earthly heart: the other, by his heart, affecting the things that are aboue, is assured of his title vnto the heauenly treasure. The Lord open the eyes of both sorts, that being
 informed of the way wherein, and end whereto they are wal∣king, the one may bee reproued and reduced, the other comfor∣ted and encouraged; and final∣ly of the latter sort all, of the former some, at the least, may be saued.
And now (Worthie Sir) J commend you to that GOD, who is able to keep you that you fall not;Iud. ver. 24 and to that word of his grace,Act. 20.32. which as it hath taught you to choose the good part,Luk 10.42 which shall not bee ta∣ken from you, so it is able to build you vp further, and to
 giue you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified; and rest,
