Right Honourable,
THough the Author's obscurity, and unwor∣thiness of the ensuing Poem, may in Justice forbid either your Lordships Patronage; yet the swift-wing'd fame of your Honour's goodness, giving life to my harmless ambition, hath emboldened me (though with trembling Heart and Hand) to make this poor address. Not that I have, or dare have, confidence to think it worth your Lordship's acceptance, being the frozen conception of one born in a cold Climate; but that the enlivening Beams of your Honour's Patronage, may screen it from that contempt and obloquie it might otherwise meet with in a hotter region: On this and no other score is poor Aeschine's gift presented to your Lordship. Favour therefore noble Sir, my begger with a Serene Aspect. And if your Honour think him worthy, grant him the regard of being one of the meanest of your Lordship's Closet inhabitants; and for his fidelity, take the word of a Priest, he'll neither steal nor flatter.
His beginning is divine and so I hope is his rise, though he be not adorned with so much Eloquent bravery as this Golden-tongu'd age boasteth of; yet I dare say, he will stammer out so much truth as may inform the Reader, that the Kernel not Shel, the substance not shew of Christian Religion and Piety is to be mind∣ed. I might I confess have drawn the Matter to a longer Thread, had I not feared that it would nei∣ther please your Honours Eye, nor become the Hand of,

Wittring, June 14. 1676.
