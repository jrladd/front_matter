DEigne (gentle Sir) to cast a willing eie
Vpon the issue of an idle braine:
Once (though an Eagle) stoupe vnto a Flie,
Then scorn such preis, & soare aloft againe.
Great oddes betweene the Mowse and Lion be,
And yet the Mowse as much a beast as he.


Hope lifts me vp vpon her snowie wings,
Chearing my thoughts with fortunate euent:
Feare pulles me downe, and whispers out such things,
As curb my ioyes, and make me mal-content:
Saying, the bird that seemes a Swanne by night,
Will prooue a wild-goose set against the light.


Naithlesse, prickt on with foolish hardiment,
I put into those gratious handes of thine
These looser numbers: fitter to be rent,
Or swept away, like deft Arachnes twine,
Than to be read: yet (deerest) list a while
Vnto thy Tyros Democriticke stile.
