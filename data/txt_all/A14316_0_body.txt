SIR,
WHen I had fi∣nished the last (and the same the first) work of this kinde, that I ever tooke in hand, I did not

beleeve there had beene any power, besides that transcendent authoritie, which imposed that task upō me, of force to make me a second time expose my selfe to the view of the world, and under-lye the censure of this Criti∣call age: For I did not ap∣prehend that your selfe, who as wel by the rights of nature, as also (but in∣finitely beyond them) by your so many merits, may with justice claime in me

what interest you please, would ever have requi∣red at my hāds, any thing of that nature, which your owne abilities stan∣ding in no need of, can∣not in your particular be usefull to you. But you were pleased, which wth mee shall ever have the force of a law, to cōmand it: In obedience where∣unto I here present you with your grave and sen∣tentious Velleius Patercu∣lus, drest after my fashion

in English robes. The benefit that such, as ma∣king their acquaintance with him, now that after so many ages he is taught to speak our Ilanders lan∣guage, they shall reape by the familiarity with him, wch before they wanted; they must (if friends to e∣quity) wholly and freely acknowledge themselves to have received from you. Since without your injunction, I had never adventured upon a piece

of such difficulty, as I, now it is done, do make a question, whether my desire to observe you in all, did not more enable mee to goe through with it, then any faculty of mine owne. nor, when I had brought it to an end, had suffered it to be pub∣lished: but that I would not permit you to want the honour of a good work, wherof you were the immediate author, I dare with cōfidence give

it that Epithete, for that among so many histories as I have read, I have met with none (and in this I beleeve every judicious Reader will be of my o∣pinion) that doth in so few, and yet those so ele∣gant words, involve so much strength of wit and understanding. By that which remaines of him so full of excellencie, I am taught to deplore the losse, which all lovers of knowledge do suffer in

the mutilation of so dain∣tie a piece in many places: but especially by that vast Hiatus in the first booke, in which all the glorious actions of the Romans from the foundation of the city till the ruine of the Macedonian kingdome by Emilius, during the space of five hundred yeares, or more, are swal∣lowed up: what is now extant of him, though much short of his native beautie, and the lustre of

his originall language: I humbly, desire you will accept as an eternall testi∣mony of the respect and devotion of him, who is only sory that he hath nei∣ther occasion nor meanes in sort more suteable to your worth, to expresse how much he is
