THese Poems (true and Noble Friends) being some expence of my time at Sea, I have thus ha∣bited, to present them as my true love to you on the Land. In one morning J present you with two poems. They are Virgins that never before kist the Presse, yet now come ready prest to kisse your hands. J have phrased them rather with a na∣tive familiarity, then an impertinent Ele∣gancy, least by disregulating Art, J had made nature monstrous. Yet where the digni∣ty of the subiect duely invites a higher-valu∣ed language, J have (to my ability) endea∣vored

a redemption. Were I versd in the tricke of flattery, I should have Deckt my de∣dication with some protestations of your wor∣thinesse and my love But I suppose honest faithfulnesse rather blemished then embellish∣edwith those adulterated beauties; Favour mee to read this Messenger of my love; and more, to Accept it as the fruites of those faire respects in which (as J euer was) I am alwaies,
