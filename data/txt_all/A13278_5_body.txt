EQually bound, in humble Gratitude,
To Two deer Equals (to You equall Deer);
Vnable (yet) with Both at once to cleer,
Vnwilling yet, with Eyther to be rude:
ine would I craue to haue my Bond renewd,
For a more Happy, or more Hopefull Year,
When gratious Heav'n shall daign to set me freer
From old cold Cares, which keep my Muse vnmew'd.
uld You be pleas'd (Madame) to interpose
Your gentle breath, I would not doubt to speed:
Such vertue hath Your Vertue stil with Those.
erefore in Hope of Your kinde Help (at need)
This simple Pledge I Offer at Your Feet;
Altar of Loue, Where both Their Vowes doe meet.
