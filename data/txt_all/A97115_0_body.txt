Right Reverend Father in God,
LEt not the Gratitude which for your many favours I owe unto your Lordship, seem Arrogancie, or Presumption, be∣cause by way of Retribution (though it be but a poor one to repay in Paper only what I re∣ceived from your Lordship in richer Bullion) I have taken the boldnesse to thrust this slender Dis∣course under the wings of your Patronage: the truth is, so weak a Chick, could not likely derive so much life, and vigor, under any other wing as
 under yours, though indeed it be a fitter shelter for Phoenixes, and Birds of Paradise only, the pro∣duction, I mean of Abler Pens, and richer Abili∣ties, than I dare pretend to.
Yet my Lord, I hope it will be no disparagement to your Honour to patronize so slight a thing as This, with which I now present your Lordship, since herein you will very much imitate the Divine Good∣ness of the Great Creator; who cherished the Little Gnat, as well as the vast Elephant, and hath a Pa∣ternal providence, as well for a Diminutive Wren, or a Contemptible Hedge Sparrow, as for the Gayer and Greater Ostruh, or the Majestick and Tow∣ring Aeagle.
Our Great Master preferred the poor Widows single Mite, before all the Offerings of Those, who cast much more than She into the Treasury: and this makes me not altogether to Despair, but that this my Mite may also find your kind Acceptance.
This Discourse is all along a fervent prayer for the King our Great Lord and Master, as you may see upon the Title page in every Leaf, and it is also an earnest perswasion to that Loyalty and Obedience, which all His Subjects owe unto Him, both by the Laws of God and Man; and thus far I am con∣fident
 this Sermon will please your Lordship very well.
You have here also another , or true Pourtraicture of His Sacred Majesty, your Royal Pupil, and Great Master also; in which you cannot but with infinite Complacency behold the rare Fruits of those Seeds, which your Self hath sown, and the influencies of the Divine Grace hath ripened, to such an excellent Maturity, and perfe∣ction.
My humble request, my Lord, is only this, that you would please favourably to take this paper, as the Testification of my Continued Loyalty to my King, and the most Thankfull Acknowledgement of these undeserved respects, which heretofore you were pleased to cast upon so mean an Object as
From my Study in Fast Cokr near Yavil in the County of Sommerset. June 18, 1660.
