WHen I had prea∣ched
these two ser∣mons
(right wor∣shipfull)
diuers of
my friendes reque∣sted
a Copie of
them: the which they craued ear∣nestly,
& at the last I graunted hard∣ly.
I had small leasure to pen my
Sermons for them, and thought it
lesse honestie, and as little curtesie to
denie them. But when through im∣portunitie
they had gotten the vp∣per
hande, and receiued my Ser∣mons
at my handes, they went pre∣sently
after a viewe taken of them,
vnto the Printer to haue them pub∣lished.
They vsed many reasons to
persuade me to yeeld therevnto, but

but when they coulde by no reason
moue me to agree to their attempt,
they protested that my Sermons
shoulde bee printed, though I were
neuer so vnwilling, they hauing the
copies in their handes: in the ende,
whē I could nothing preuaile with
them, but perforce was constrained
to yeelde to the publishing of these
my Sermons. I Purposed, as duetie
moued mee, to commend and com∣mit
them vnto your worships, to
whom I doe acknowledge my selfe
diuers wayes much bounden: and
the rather was I mooued to hide
them vnder the winges of your
worships protection, because your
fauour in mainteining the Gospell,
your zeale to Gods worde, the re∣gard
that you haue of Gods Mini∣sters,
is knowne, not to mee only,
who haue often times perceiued it,
but to all thē, which although they
know not you, yet both know & do

acknowledge your good deedes.
The Lorde powre downe his spi∣rite
plentifully vpon you, kindle
more & more in you the true zeale
that alredy burneth, increase the
loue and good affection which you
haue toward the gospel, that you be∣ing
pillers in the Church of Christ
militant, may also bee pillers in his
Church triumphant. And thus, de∣siring
your worships to accept this
my simple and rude worke, with
my humble commēdations to you,
and to the vertuous Ladies your
wiues, I bid you hartily fare well,
from London this xix. of Ianuarie.
1580.
