IT is not vvithout reason nor contrarie to example, that I presume to offer vp to the peculiar and graue vievv of your Maiestie, these my compositions and labors: for that the generall argument being historicall, a doctrine vvherein your Maiestie farre aboue all other Princes hath a most singular insight & iudgement, and the particular partes conteining discourse of state and go∣uernment, in vvhich God hath expres∣sed in the person of your Maiestie a most rare and diuine example to all other Kings of the earth for matter of pollicie and sound administration: All lavv of reason, of equitie, and of other impression vvhat so euer, do chalenge to appropriate the addresse and iustification of this vvorke to your Maiestie only, in vvhom, for your inspired science & spirit to iudge of Monuments and euents of times, and for the felicitie of your gouern∣ment in seasons so perillous & conspiring, all Kings, and Kingdomes, and nations rounde about you, rise vp to reuerence in your fourme of go∣uerning, that propertie of vvisdome and vertue, vvhich it seemes God hath restrayned to your Maiestie onely, vvithout participation to any of them: And in that regarde they holde you that sacred and fixed Starre, vvhose light God vvill not haue put out, though the deuises of men on

all sides are busie to dravv clovvdes and darke vayles to obscure it.
I am also encoraged to make this oblation to your Maiestie by the example of many notable vvriters, both of the primitiue times and in all ages and posterities succeeding, suche as for the grauitie and fidelitie of their penne and style vvere cherished vvith the greatest Princes of those dayes, and vnder the authoritie and countenance of their names, their vvorks vvere vvith reputation and credite insinuated into many peo∣ples, nations, and regiments, The same being an effect due to the vertue and pietie of great Princes, for that as it is God that giueth vvisdome and science to men, So it is authoritie that chiefly shovveth it to the vvorld, euen as the earth norisheth the roote of a tree, but the confor∣table Sunne doth much to bring foorth the blossoms. So many are the testimonies and examples of this, and so familiar vvith your Maiestie is the doctrine of histories and information of times, that by so much lesse neede I to stande vpon authorities of antiquitie, or declarations relatiue, by hovv much more is knovven to be happily laied vp in your Maiesties brest, and effectually expressed in the forme of your gouernment and reigne, all that vvhich learning and bookes can set dovvne by rule and precept, your Maiestie being the onely consecrated Lampe from vvhom all other dominions about you do dravv their light, or rather that terre∣striall Sunne, vpon vvhose influence God hath appoynted to depend the motions of all the Regions and Climats of the vvhole common vveale of Christendome: A calling and authoritie vvhich all other Potentates do honor in you vvith so much the more merite and reuerence, by hovv∣much amid so many occasions and oportunities to ambition, they proue your equitie, pietie, and moderation of minde, to exceede all examples of former Princes and times, and farre surmount all humaine exspecta∣tion: for that hauing as it vvere a soueraigne povver ouer them & theirs, you do notvvithstanding dispose of things according to the lavv of mea∣sure and right. In regard of vvhich diuine properties, accompanied vvith your Maiesties other vertues vvhich God hath made infinite in you, and your felicitie vvhich is the revvarde and effect of the same, I may vvith good comelinesse resemble the gratious reigne of your Maiestie tou∣ching these regions of Christendome, to the happy time & dayes of Cae∣sar Augustus Emprour of Rome: vvho, after a long and generall combu∣stion and harrying of the vvhole vvorlde vvith blood and vvarres, did so reforme and reduce the Regions confining his Empire, that vvith the Scepter and seate of peace he much more preuayled then euer he could haue done vvith the svvord: By his clemencie he brought to submission

his neighbours that stoode out agaynst him, and by his constancie helde them assured being once reconciled: His vvisdome seemed an Oracle to the Nations about him to dispose of their counsels and svvaigh their enterprises: And touching quarrels and controuersies of state, eyther for his grauitie and iustice, the only arbitration and resolution vvas referred to him, or at least for the avve that vvas had of him, the factions durst not burst out to further limits then he liked of: Lastely, it vvas an approued Monarchie of God, for that Christ the sonne of God amid such an vni∣uersall malice of man and mankinde, vvas contented to shevv himselfe in flesh in the dayes of his reigne. Euen so though the singular persons be chaunged, yet the effects and blessings of this time do nothing vary vnder the happy rule of your Maiestie, vvhom God hath raised and esta∣blished a soueraigne Empresse ouer seuerall nations and languages, and vvith the frutes of a firme and continued peace, hath plentifully enriched the peoples of your Dominions: restored Religion and the Church of Christ to dvvell a nevv amongst vs: made your authoritie avvefull to all your neighbours and borderers: and lastly hath erected your seate vpon a high hill or sanctuarie, and put into your hands the ballance of povver and iustice, to peaze and counterpeaze at your vvill the actions and counsels of all the Christian kingdomes of your time: VVherin sure ac∣cording to the course your Maiestie holdeth, much lesse that eyther for the present or in posterities to come, can be iustly obiected any matter of imputation agaynst you, seeing of the contrarie, most of them that be vvise and true obseruers of your dealings, do daily confesse and publish, that in your Maiestie hath bene orderly fulfilled all lavves and offices of a deuoute Nevvtralitie: For that like as amidde their heauy afflictions vvherein successiuely hath bene offred you no small causes to ambition, your Maiestie hath neuer stopped or cutte from them the refuge of your amitie and mercy: So neuerthelesse your compassion hath principally respected the equitie of the complaynts of such as implored it, esteming it not agreable to the lavv of vertue and account of your conscience, to make your profite vpon the diuisions of your neighbours, though there haue not vvanted reasons and titles to induce your desire.
I forbeare to make declaration to your Maiestie of the life and lear∣ning of the first Author of this booke, A matter testified vvith sufficient credit and reputation in the high negociations and employments vvhich he managed long time vnder great Princes, Popes, & common vveales: And I am bolde (contrary to the custome of some vvriters) to leaue to particulate in my Epistle any part of the argument vvhich vvith so great

grauitie he hath digested at large in so great a volume: Onely the man for his integritie and roundnes vvas such one, as vvhose vertues vvere farre from all suspicion of parcialitie, fauour, hatred, loue, revvard, or any other propertie of humaine affection, vvhich might haue force to corrupt or turne from the truth the minde of a vvriter: And for the generall mat∣ter of his vvorke, it doth not onely conteine the vvarres and diuerse acci∣dentes hapned in Italy and other partes for almost fortie yeres, but also he doth so distinctly set dovvne the causes, the counsells, and the fortunes of euery principall partie introduced into those actions, that by his studie and iudgement, is traced & made easie to the reader, the vvay to all those svvete and plentifull frutes vvhich vvith paynfulnes are sought for in Hi∣stories of this nature.
And for mine ovvne part, vvhere in all my dedications heretofore, not my vvill vvhich vvas alvvayes vvarranted by the gracious demonstra∣tions of your Maiestie, But my maner of life instituted vpon priuate cu∣stomes and exercises, hath holden me from approching the authoritie of this place, affore vvhich nothing ought to be presented vvhich hath not a full perfection of spirite and studie: yet novv, taking my reason of the vvorthines of the vvorke, and obseruing the examples and inducements of others in like oblatiōs, I am bold vnder feare & humilitie to prostrate these my last payns afore that diuine moderation of mind vvhich alvvays hath holden for acceptable all things respecting learning or vertuous labours: Humbly beseeching your right excellent Maiestie, that vvhere the vvorke is novv to appeare in the open vievv of the vvorld, and stande before the vncertaine iudgements of so many sundry & straunge humors of men, you vvill vouchsafe to let it passe vnder the happie name of your Maiestie, and vnder your gracious authoritie to giue it defence and fa∣uor agaynst the emulation of such as eyther through malice or ignorance may rise vp to interprete me and my labours sinisterly. The Lorde blesse your Maiestie vvith a long and peaceable life, and confirme in you to the comfort of your people, that course of vvell tempered gouern∣ment, by the benefite vvhereof they haue so long time liued vnder the felicitie of your name.
At my lodging neare the Tovver of London. vij. Ianuarij. 1578.
