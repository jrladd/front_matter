Right Trusty, and Right
Honourable Senators.
I And not I only, but many farre more con∣siderable,
have been Spectators of those
Intricate Mazes, and indefatigable trou∣bles,
which you as our Worthies, have for
above these six years past undergone, not to be para∣lelled
to any time, save that of Israels deliverance
from Pharaoh out of the House of bondage, which
you as so many Noble Instruments, by the strength of
the Arme of the Mighty God of Jacob, have perfor∣med
to the present accomplishment for us, (as great a
deliverance.) For the which blessed be the God most
High, as also for that after so great winnowing, there
yet remains so considerable a number of you found
faithfull to your trust, and though this may be estee∣med
by you Honourable Worthies, a boldnesse in the

presenter (neer unto presumption) to mention your
Honours Names in this Epistle, for which I have no∣thing
to plead for in excuse, but this, namely, that
your Honours are neerly and greatly concerned in the
Subject matter of this ensuing Discourse, which if He,
that is the Head of all Principallities and Powers, the
Mighty Counsellour, by whom Princes decree just
things, shall strengthen and guide you to follow: I,
and not I onely, but all Conscientious men, and true
Christians, shall therein have their desires, and you
their prayers:
So resteth
