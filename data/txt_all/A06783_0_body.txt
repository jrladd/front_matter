OUre Lorde and alone
sauioure.Math. xiii Iesu Christe
declareth in a parable
of the gospell, that af∣ter
a certayne houshoulder had
sowed good seede in hys fielde,
whyle hys seruauntes slepte, hys
ennemye came and sowed tares
amonge the wheate and wente
hys waye, Thys houshoulder is
Christ the lord. The good sede is
y• children of god & gods worde.

The seruauntes that slepte are
negligente Prelates and sleepye
shepheardes, whiche watche not
ouer the Lordes flocke. The ene¦my
is the deuil. The tares are the
children of the wicked, & errours
and heresies, which? Satan sow¦eth
in the heartes, of the vnbele∣uinge.
Of this parable as wee
learne the goodnes of Christe to¦ward
vs in be getting vs a new,i. Peter. i.
not of mortal sede but of immor∣tall
by the worde of God, whiche
liueth and lasteth for euer, so like
wyse learne we the maliciousnes
of Sathan, whiche lyke a subtile
serpente and olde enemye of mā¦kinde,
neuer sleepeth, but conty∣nuallye
walcketh vp and downe
lyke a roryng lion, seking whom
he may deuoure and warely wat¦cheth
hys tyme to destroye,ii. Pete. v. when

souer anye occasion is geuen, be
it neuer so little. Not wythoute a
great cause therefore did out sa∣uioure.
Christ exhort vs to watch
and praye, that wee fall not into
temptatiō.Mat. xxvi. And albeit in this our
frayle and synnefull lyfe manye
occasions of doinge myscheife be
offered to the ennemy on our be∣halfe
such is our negligence and
vncircumspecte behayoure, yet
the gratest occasion wherin Sa∣tan
most gloryeth and soonest ho¦peth
for the victorye, is when the
shepheardes of Christes flocke
giue no atēdaūce to theyr charge
but lye sleepynge and snortyng,
walowynge and welterynge in
theyr pleasures, and suffer the
wolf to scatter, yea to catch, to kil
and to destroye the shepe.Esaye. lvi. Ihon. x. For al¦though
the deuil leteth go no pro¦fer,

whiche maye moue him to do
euil, but laieth hād on it streight
waies, yet as the histories both of
the holye scriptures & of credible
writers do testify, he neuer shew¦eth
him selfe so right a deuil nor
so liuely setteth forth him selfe in
his true colours, as whē y• guids
of the Lords flocke be either ab∣sent
frō their shepe, orels are neg¦ligēt
in doīg theyr dutie, I mean
in preching gods word, & in wri¦ting
godly bokes, if nede require
for the confutacion of erroures
and heresies and for y• establish∣ment
of gods holi religion. How
sone had the people of Israel for
gotten god and his goodnes to∣ward
the, after Moses was gone
from them into the moūt Sina
to talke with god & to receiue the
lawe?Exo. xxxii Fel they not streightwaies

from the one and alone true and
liuing god vnto abhominable i∣dolatri,
and worshipped a golden
calfe? After the daies of Moses &
of other godly Prophetes & prea¦chers
when wicked kinges reig∣ned,
and the preachinge of gods
worde ceased, did not ye people of
Israel fal to the worshipping of
straūge gods, & made of the brasē
serpēt (which was but a sacramēt
and figure of Christe) a God and
brent sacrifice vnto it?Ihon. iii. iiii. re. xviii Certayne
yeres before ye cōmīg of christ in∣to
this world, into how mani sec∣tes
& sōdry religiōs were the Ie∣wes
deuided amōg thē selfs, whi¦che
not wt stādīg coūted thēselfes
onli the people of god & hated al
other naciōs, as abhominable I¦dolatours?
Yea in the time of the
Apostles, were ther not y• denied

Christe to be eyther true God or
true man? How sone wer the Cor¦rinthians
and Galathians sedu∣ced
by false Apostles, after that
the mooste worthye Apostle. S.
Paul was departed from them?
Howe many kynde of Heretikes
rose there vppe in the churche of
Christe after the Apostles tyme?
What greate and howe manye
contencions both in sermons, dis¦putacions
and wrightinges had
the holye Bishops and godly fa∣thers
of the primatiue church wt 
the heretikes of theyr time for the
maintenaunce of gods truth and
for plucking vp y• enemies tares?
Since the time yt those verteous
Bishops and learned fathers of
Christs church died, into how ma¦ny
sects haue the people y• profes
god be deuided? The number of

sectes and counterfait religious,
which yet liue vnder the Bishop
of Rome, are almoste innumera∣ble.
Neither ceaseth Sathan euē
in this most clear light of the gos¦pel
to play the right deuil, and to
cast mistes before the eies of the
vnfaithful. Into how many sects
is Christendome yet deuided? Ar
not some called papists, some pro¦testants,
some Anabaptists, some
sacramentaries? Whence come
al these abhominacions but only
from sathan the author of al euil?
Moreouer in what fielde, where
good sede hath bene sowed, hath
not the ennemie sowed his tares
also? howe pestilentlye hathe he
corrupted the pure wheate of
goddes woorde wyth myngeling
hys chaffe, drosse, darnell, cockell
and tares, I mean the false glo∣ses,

and vnsauery exposicions of
the papistes, Anabaptistes, and
suche other secaries? Howe wic∣kedlye
hathe hee peruerted the
righte vse of the sacramentes, spe¦cially
the sacrament of Christes
bodye and bloude? fastinge, prai¦er
and almes deede, howe hathe
he made thē to be abused? There
is no pointe of Christen religion,
which Sathan hath not attemp∣ted
too ouerthrowe by hys mini∣sters.
And albeit as I said before
the enemy laboureth at all times
to sowe hys tares in the Lordes
fielde, yet when the shepheardes
of Christes flocke be negligēt in
doing their dutye, fal a slepe and
loke not to the Lordes field, then
doth he most of al play his parte
and bestoure him like a right de∣uil,
as Salomon saythe. When

the preahing of gods word fai∣leth,Pro. xxix.
the people pearishe. It ther¦fore
becommeth al men that ten∣der
the glorye of God, but specy∣allye
the Lordes Ministers to
loke diligentlye vnto theyr lords
fielde, and earnestly to take hede
that the enemy sow not his tares
amonge the Lordes wheate. If
any be sowed, it is their duti to la¦boure
euen to the vttermooste of
theyr power not with violence &
corporal armours (for the vse of
the seculare swearde is not com∣mytted
to the preachers of gods
worde,Luk. xxi. Roma. xiii but to the temporal rulers
onlye to punysh malefactoures)
but with the swearde of the spirit
whyche is the woorde of God,Ephes. vi.
wyth prayers, supplycacions and
eares to weede theym oute.
The weapons of our warfar, sai¦eth
S. Paule,ii. Cori. x. ar not carnal thin¦ges,
but thynges myghty in god
to cast down strong holds, wher∣wyth
we ouerthrow coūsels, and
euery hye thyng that exalteth it
selfe agaynste the knowledge of
God, and bryng into captiuity al
imaginacion to the obedience of
Christe. And in thys behalfe, I
meane, in pluckinge vp the ene∣myes
tares, and in purgyng the
Lordes fielde that nothyng may
growe therin but pure wheate,
your both godly and vnreastfull
paines (most reuerend father) a
well knowen in thys churche of
England, and thanckefullye ac∣cepted
of all faythfull Christen
heartes, insomuch that very ma∣nye
do daylye render vnto God
most humble and harty thankes

for the singuler and great bene∣fites,
whiche they haue receiued
of him thorowe your vertuous
trauaile, in attayninge vnto the
true knowledge of iustification,
of the sacrament of Christes bo∣dye
and bloud, and such other ho¦lye
misteries of oure profession.
And al be it the deuill roare, the
worlde rage, and the hipocrites
swell at these your most Christen
labourers, whiche you willinglye
take for the glory of God and the
edifyinge of hys congregacyon,
yet as ye haue godlye begunne,
so without ceasinge continew vn¦to
the ende.i. Peter. v. By this meanes shal
it come to passe, yt when the cheife
shepheard shall appeare, ye shal
receiue an incorruptyble crowne
of glorye.
And forasmuch as so many as

the Lord hath appoynted watch∣menne
ouer hys flocke, oughte
euerye one accordynge to theyr
talente to folowe youre Godlye
example in weedynge oure er∣roures
and plantynge true and
Christen opynyons in the hear∣tes
of the people, seinge that Sa¦than
hath not a lyttle corrupted
the true vse of fastynge, whyche
beynge ryghtelye vsed doeth
hyghelye please God, and abu∣sed,
displeaseth hym: I thoughte
it good agaynste thys tyme of
Lente, whyche of longe conty∣nuaunce
hathe bene appoynted
to abstinence, to write some what
of fastynge, that myghte both o∣penne
awaye too the faythefull
howe they maye faste to please
God, and also dysclose the falsse
manner of fastynge broughte in

by the deuyl and his Ministers.
And in thys my treatyse I haue
fyrste declared what the Christen
faste is,The Con∣tentes of this boke. secondly how we oughte
to fast, and thyrdly what the true
vse of fastinge is. I toke thys la∣boure
vppon me the more glad∣lye,
partelye because no manne
hytherto hath writen of that mat¦ter
in oure Englyshe tonge part¦lye
to satysfye the heartye re∣questes
of dyuers faithefull bre∣threne,
whyche ceased not to re∣quyre
me in the Lordes name to
wryghte some what, that myghte
enstructe theym in the true vse of
fastinge. The matter, I graunt.
requyreth a woorke manne of ri∣per
iudgemente, and more exer∣cysed
in the Lordes haruest then
I am, whyche myghte according
to the worthynesse of the matter,

haue set it forth pleasauntly and
learnedly, but seing no mā hath
hitherto takē it in hād, I thought
it my part not to deny the godlye
requestes of the brethrē but glad¦ly
to bestowe vpon them what so
euer the Lord hath geuen me in
thys behalfe.
Thys treatyse what so euer it
is, I your humble and faythfull
seruaunt, not hauyng otherwyse
wherwyth to testify the thankful¦nes
of my hart toward your most
honorable Lordship, for the ma¦nyfold
benefytes whych ye haue
bounteously bestowed vpon me,
do dedicate to your name, moste
humblye besechynge you accor∣to
your accustomed gentlenesse
to take in good part this my rude
and grosse woorke, whych to po∣lyshe
and to make nete (if haby∣litie

had serued) shortnes of time
wolde not suffer,
God, whose honoure you most
desirouslye seke, moughte vouch
safe to preserue youre grace, in
continuall healthe and prospe∣rous
felicitie vnto the glo∣rye
of his mooste blessed
name, and the profyt
of hys holy con∣gregacyon.
Amen.
