Right Honourable,
IN as much as divine Pro∣vidence hath brought me out of the darknesse of my Predecessors, into his most marvellous light, by taking away the vaile of their Ceremonies (so) from before the Eyes of my Understanding, as that now I see Jesus Christ to be my alone Saviour; which was onely Typpified or Shadow∣ed out in them by Hyroglyffickes: And in as much as the aforesaid Providence
 hath likwise brought me with Abraham from my Fathers House and Idoles into a Land I did not know, wherein I am now a Stranger, wherein blessed be his Name, he hath instructed me by his di∣vine Precepts, to walk in those wayes that are most consonant to his divine Will. As also, in as much as the Lord hath gi∣ven you a heart to promote the same a Priviledge, which this nation did never before enjoy, as at present. I have there∣fore thought it my duty, to acknowledge my thankfulnesse unto you, as the cheif∣est Instruments under God, both for the enjoyment of my profession in religious Worship, as also, for those many noble and gracious favours received from you: and for which, I hope the Lord will one day reward you, by giving you farre more glorious degrees of honour then now you enjoy, even in heavenly places with Jesus Christ.
And, in token hereof, I have presumed to dedicate this little paines, which I have taken, to depresse the pride and arrogancy of the people who call themselves Jewes,

I presume your Honours will not expect curious phrase from him that as yet hath but in a small measure attained to the English tongue, as also that you will bear with the rudnesse of the Methode, in as much as I am not yet acquainted with the manner of writing English Books, being constrained to make use of an In∣terpreter.
I hope also, your Honours will not im∣pute the course Language therein to the People aforesaid, out of any malice, to their persons, but meerly out of the zeal I have to drive them from their fond imaginati∣ons, to imbrace the Truth as it is in Jesus. For, I do ingeniously profess, in the presence of the great God of Heaven and Earth,
 and in the presence of his dearly beloved Sonne Jesus Christ, as also of that bles∣sed Spirit of Truth proceeding from the same, the onely comforter of the Elect: that my very bowels do yearn after them, untill Christ be formed in them. Neither have I in the least abused my writing, wherein I have set forth their yet invete∣rate malice against the Professors of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but have dealt as candidly therein as I would have done for my dearest friend: It being the de∣sire of my soul, that the Eternal, Immor∣tal, Invisible and onely wise God, would in his good time bring them also from Darknesse to his most marvelous Light, and from the power of Sathan unto God, as blessed be his name he hath done to
