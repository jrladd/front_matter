MOst vertuous Lady, yea, Ver∣tue it selfe, under whose pro∣tection to endeavour is most safe: and therefore that is here my most humble suite. I have, as insues, taken in hand to insist upon, or rather to deale with most peremptory, stout, and turbulent Pas∣sions. My incounter with such, being coun∣tenanced by your selfe, shall minde the more happy successe. Which favour, deare Lady,

shall for ever prove my incouragement, and approve your courtesie, under the shadow of whose wing I shall be sheltred as I walke, from all the searching heat, of accusing ha∣tred; issuing forth the infernall furnace of detraction.
Thus farre presuming, it is, doubtlesse, my duty, to vow you my service: in the perfor∣mance of which, where I shall faile in act, I trust to fulfill it in desire, and for ever rest.
