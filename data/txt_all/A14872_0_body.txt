My Noble Lord,
THAT I may present my excuse why, (being a stranger to your Lordshippe) I offer this Poem to your Patronage, I plead this war∣rant; Men (who neuer sa the Sea, yet desire to behold that regi∣ment of waters,) choose some eminent Riuer, to guide them thither; and make that as it were, their Conduct, or Postilion: By the like ingenious meanes, has your fame arriued at my knowledge, receiuing it from some of worth, who both in contemplation, and practise, owe to your Honor their clearest service. I do not altogether looke vp at your Title: The ancien'st Nobility, being but a rellique of time past, and the truest Honor indeede beeing for a man to conferre Honor on himselfe, which your Learning striues to

propagate, and shall make you arriue at the Dignity of a great Example. I am confident this worke is not vnworthy your Honors perusal for by such Poems as this, Poets haue kist the hands of Great Princes, and drawne their gentle eyes to looke downe vpon their sheetes of paper, when the Poets them∣selues were bound vp in their winding-sheetes. The like curtesie from your Lordship, shall make you liue in your graue, and laurell spring out of it when the ignorant scorners of the Muses (that like wormes in Libraries, seeme to liue onely, to destroy learning) shall wither, neglected, and forgotten. This worke and my selfe I humbly present to your approued censure. It being the vtmost of my wishes, to haue your Honorable selfe my weighty and perspicuous Com∣ment: which grace so done me, shall euer be acknow∣ledged
