MADAM,
I Have obeyed your commands, and (as farre as my power extends) perfected them. The Queene of CARTHAGE hath learned English to converse with you: be pleased now to esteeme her as a Native, but in the errours of her language, still remember she was borne a Forraigner. I doubt not but the correspondence your knowledge holds with Time-past, hath truely informed your Ladiship, that DIDO fell by her owne hand a Martyr of CHA∣STITY,

not a SACRIFICE to PAS∣SION: but let not this move you to sus∣pect my Authour, as envious to your No∣ble Sexe, or ambitious to enlarge the RO∣MAN Conquest in a Ladies fame, farre be it from your apprehension, as from his: he writes a POEM, not a HISTORY, and draweth not the Picture of DIDO, but of ART to life: I tooke this Copy for your Ladiship; pardon me that I publish it, my chiefe designe being to doe honour to so excellent a Kinswoman: in whose natu∣rall perfections our Family, in whose ver∣tues our Time glories. Be constant to your goodnesse, and the world shall subscribe, as I,
