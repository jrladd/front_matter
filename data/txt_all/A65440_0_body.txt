MY Lord,
THE so extraordinary Ci∣vility Your Lordship was pleas'd to express to me for this SERMON, (which I can attribute to nothing but the design of it, viz. Loyalty, which is, and always hath been most grateful to Your Lordship) hath however so
 highly oblig'd me, that I should think my self guilty of no less Ingratitude, than that which I blame in others, should I refuse to submit it to Your Lordships Disposal.
I beg leave to tell Your Lordship, That this Discourse was first Preach'd (mutatis mutandis) when the late Duke of Monmouth was in the heighth of his Rebellion, in my own Parish; where not only Castares, but Ferguson him∣self, (that Bloodiest of all the Re∣bels) was formerly at The Conventicle at Theobalds, a Frequent, and amongst his Followers, a most Celebrated Preacher.
Wherefore, I thought it my Duty to let my People see, how much they had been abused by him, and such Seducers, and to Preach up Loyalty amongst them from his own Text, which (as I was then Inform'd) he
 had wrested to Rebellious Designs.
By this, Your Lordship may plainly see, that I have always (even in the worst of Times) endeavoured to do my Duty to God and the King, with all Faithfulness; though I am forced to tell Your Lordship, (because I live by some ill Neighbours, who seek to do me all the Mischief they can, only because by all means Lawful I endeavour to make them do their Duties) That I have Laboured un∣der the greatest Disadvantage and Discouragement, and suffered the greatest Persecution for it, of any Man in England (that I know of) of my Age and Station.
All that I can return to Your Lord∣ship for your great kindness, is only (like Beggars) to have Recourse to my Prayers for you, That Your Lord∣ships Name may be as Famous in all
 Ages for Loyalty, and for the Just and Honourable Rewards of it, as now it is in your Self, the Loyal Lord Mayor of London, and in the Great and Loyal Lord Chancellor of England: And (if the Infinite Happiness of Heaven can admit of Degrees) That your Lordship may enjoy in the World to come, a degree of Glory as much above other Men, as You do at this present. Which is, and shall be, the Hearty Prayer of,
My Lord,).
