My Lord,
I Am sufficiently sensible of my own
Arrogance, in that being almost a
Stranger to every thing of You
but your Fame, I durst obtrude
so abject a Triffle as this, under
the Patronage of so eminent a Person; but that
generous Candour, wherewith you oblige all the
World, gave me Courage to hope you might at
least pardon this first offence in me. And though
perhaps, the best presents of this nature may not
be more than ordinary grateful; yet I have here
my wishes, if the sincerity of my Zeal,
may atone for the meaness of the Offer∣ing:
That is the farthest prospect I look to,
which whilst I have in view, I dare not
(though perhaps as justly as some others have
done I might) complain of the censures of the

World; for since I've heard that your Lord∣ship
prov'd indulgent, I were unworthy of the
favours you bestow'd, should be concern'd at the
malice or petulancy of those, who (alas!) will
needs think it modish to be Critical, but in the
mean while forget 'tis as gentile to be civil. No
my Lord, 'tis under your Vmbrage only I would
court protection, to whom Heav'n has given a
soul, whose endowments are as much above flat∣tery,
as it self abbors it; and which are as im∣possible
to be describ'd, as I am unable to com∣prehend
them. But as poorest Pilgrims, when
they visit shrines, will make some presents where
they kneel: so I have here brought mine, by your
own goodness only made worthy to be preserv'd;
in whose defence I can say nothing more, than
that with all my best endeavours are, and ever
shall be ready to testifie how much I am, my Lord
