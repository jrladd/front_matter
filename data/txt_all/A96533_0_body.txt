Most gracious Sove∣raign,
SEeing it hath plea∣sed Almightie God, To establish your sacred Ma∣jestie in the royal throne of your ever blessed Father, I have held it my duty, with bended heart and knee, to present unto your Majesty at the beginning of your reign a short view of the present estate and condition of Italy, that therein, as in a little Map, your Majestie may
see the true face of this pro∣vince, and make such use there∣of hereafter, as in your Prince∣ly wisdom you shall finde to conduce most to the advan∣tage of your own affaires, Crowns, and dignities.
