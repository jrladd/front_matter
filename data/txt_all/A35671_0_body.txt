SIR,
AS soon as I had resolv'd to make
this Address to you, that the
Present might not be altoge∣ther
unworthy of you, I took care
to obtain the Consent of my Friends
to publish some Letters, which they
had writ as Answers to mine.
When I look upon my self, I find
I have reason to beg pardon for my

Presumption: But when I consider
those Gentlemen, I am encourag'd
to hope that you will not be offen∣ded
to find your self at the Head of
no Vulgar Company, a Company,
whose Names and Desert are uni∣versally
known, a Company rais'd
far above the level of Mankind by
their own extraordinary Merit, and
yet proud to do Homage to yours.
They are Gentlemen, 'tis true, who
are divided in their Interests, and
who differ in their Politick Princi∣ples,
but they agree in their Judg∣ments
of Things, which all the
World admires, and they always
consent when they speak of you.
In presenting this little Book to you,
I only design'd to shew my Zeal and
my Gratitude; but they assure me
unanimously, that I have likewise
shewn my Judgment. Tho indeed,
Sir, the number of the Great, who

cast a favourable Eye upon Human
Learning, is not so considerable, but
that a Man who would Address
any thing of this nature to one of
them, may soon determine his choice.
Proficients in other Arts are encou∣raged
by Profit, which is their main
Design, but he who bestows all his
time upon Human Studies is incited
by Glory alone, and the World takes
care that he should have no more
than he seeks for. The Enthusiast,
the Quack, the Pettifogger, are re∣warded
for Torturing, and for de∣luding
Men; but Humanity has met
with very barbarous Usage, only for
pleasing, and for instructing them.
The very Court, which draws most
of its Ornament from it, has but too
often neglected it; there Learning
in general has been disregarded: For
none but great Souls are capable of
great Designs, and few Courtiers

have had Greatness of Mind enough
to procure the Promotion of Sci∣ence,
which is the Exaltation of Hu∣man
Nature, and the Enlargement
of the Empire of Reason. Our Mi∣nisters
of State have formerly beha∣ved
themselves with so much indif∣ference,
as if it would have lessen'd
them to have taken any care of Let∣ters.
They have shewn themselves as
perfectly unconcern'd, as if not one
had discover'd, that at a time when
our Neighbors are grown so know∣ing,
the Publick Safety depends on
the Progress of Learning, and that
to Patronize Science, is to take care
of the State. Besides, too many of
our States-men have been engag'd
in unjust Designs. Most of our Po∣liticians
have done their endeavour
to encroach on the Crown, or to
attempt on the People. Few have
had Capacity and Integrity enough

to keep the Balance so steady, as to
maintain Prerogative at once, and
assert Privilege; to serve the King
Zealously, and their Country Faith∣fully;
to possess at the same time the
Favour of the one, and the Hearts
of the other, to such a degree as to
be courted by the People to serve as
their Representative, at the very time
that they are employ'd by the King
in Matters of the highest Impor∣tance.
Instead of that, most of them
have had reason to be afraid of the
King or the Commons; and Men
who have been sollicitous for their
own Safety have seldom appear'd
concern'd for the good of others.
Few then have been and are in a
Condition to be Protectors of Learn∣ing,
and therefore those happy few
deserve all the Honours which we
are able to pay them. Of those, Sir,
you appear in the foremost Rank,

and are to the Common-wealth of
Learning what you are to the State,
a great Defence and a shining Orna∣ment.
You have warmly encoura∣ged
all sorts of Studies, but have
been justly and nobly partial to
those, for which the State has made
no Provision: Which is enough
to gain you the Esteem of all who
have any regard for Learning, and
to win the very Souls of all who, like
me, are charm'd with the softer Stu∣dies
of Humanity. For which your
Zeal has been so diffusive, that it
has extended it self even to me, tho'
a bare Inclination to cultivate Elo∣quence
and Poetry, was the only
thing which could recommend me
to ou▪ Yet even this has been encour∣ag'd
by the promise of your Pro∣tection
and by the Humanity of your
receiving me. The access which I
have had to you, has been the great∣est

Obligation that you could lay up∣on
a Man who has still valu'd Merit
above all the World, and who has
sought his Improvement more than
he has his Advancement. When I
have at any time approach'd you,
I have found in you none of those
forbidding Qualities, of which they
accuse the Great. Instead of those,
I have found an attractive and a hu∣man
Greatness, the generous Since∣rity
of the Man of Honour join'd
with the Grace and Complaisance of
the Courtier, and a Deportment no∣ble
without Pride, and Modest with∣out
descending. Nature has made
me something averse from making
my Court to Fortune. But I am proud
to attend upon real Greatness, and
to wait upon you since first you en∣couraged
me, has been at once my
Duty and my Ambition.
The Permission which you gave
me to approach you, was so great an
Incitement to me, that I believe it
might have brought me to write
well if I had not a very just reason to
resolve to attempt it no more. You
had given me one great Encourage∣ment
before I had the Honour to see
you, and that was, by leaving off
Writing your self. For Vanity is a
greater Incitement to Poets than Pen∣sions,
and even Want depresses the
Spirits less than the thought of being
surpassed. Therefore while Mr. Mon∣tague
Sung, he Sung alone. We ad∣mir'd
indeed our Conquering Mo∣narch,
but we admir'd in silence. We
rever'd the Greatness of your Genius,
and neglected our Talents. Indeed
the strength and sweetness of your
Voice was fit to charm us alone, and
we who followed, were only fit for
the Chorus. But you have left a Pro∣vince,

which you have made your
own, to the Adminstration of those
who are under you, and are gone
on in your victorious Progress to the
Acquisition of new Glory. From
which I am sensible that I detract
by detaining you. For your Actions
are your best Encomiums, and the
loud consent of the Nation your
best Panegyrick. It was a glorious
one that was spoken to you by the
People of Westminster in the request
that they made to you to serve as
their Member in the present Parlia∣ment;
at a time when they were Ca∣balling
all over the Kingdom, and
Gentlemen were depriving Peasants
of their little Reason, in order to ob∣tain
their Voices, Mr. Montague's
Merit, while he was silent, sollicited
for him so importunately, that it
prevail'd upon a number of consi∣derable
Inhabitants of the Politer

parts of the Town, to come and
make it their humble Request to
you, to Honour them by Represent∣ing
them, which puts me in mind
of a Saying of De la Bruiere, That the
People are then at their height of
Happiness, when their King makes
Choice for his Conidents, and for his
Ministers, of the very same Persons that
the People would have chosen, if the
Choice had been in their power. This,
at present, is our own Case; for
doubtless the same People, who,
without any Brigue or the least Cor∣ruption,
came voluntarily to entreat
you to suffer them to place you in
the Great Council of the Kingdom,
would, if the Choice had been in
their power, have plac'd you in the
Privy-Council; and they who frank∣ly
offer'd to trust you with the dis∣posal
of the Mony which is in their
Houses, would have trusted you,

had it been in their power, with
the Intendency of that in the Trea∣sury.
So that the Peoples proffer
to Chuse you, seems to me to be a
loud Approbation of the Choice,
which the King had made before
of you, and of your Ministration
upon that Choice. But I injure the
Publick while I detain you. Yet give
me leave to end with my Zealous
Wishes for you, that the Happiness
may be multiplied on you, which
you so nobly seek to communicate,
that you may encrease in Riches
and Honours faster than you ad∣vance
in Years, till you arrive at
that height of Prosperity which
may be answerable to your high
Desert, and till Fortune may be
said to pour down her Gifts upon
you, in Emulation of Art and Na∣ture:
Yet Envy after all shall be forced
to declare, that Mr. Montague sprung

from an Illustrious Stock, and
loaded with Plenty and Honours,
is yet nobler by Desert, than he is
by Descent, and greater by Virtue
than he is by Fortune;
