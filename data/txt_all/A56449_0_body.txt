SIRS,
'TIS not to revive your grief at the remem∣brance of your late de∣ceased Pastor, that I have offered to your Eye what lately I spake to the Ear, but that you might have a Memorial with you of his Person, of his Piety, and of his Sayings while he was once yours in the
Lord. I profess 'twas not any opi∣nion I had of the Discourse, which as it was sudden, so it is plain; the things which may make it acceptable, are, that it was of honest design and wholesom admonition, in such loose and careless times as we live in: But that which will chiefly take with you, it was grounded on the saying of our Lord Jesus, and aimed to make men wise concerning their latter end, and to shew their happiness that are preparing for it in well doing. But if this should not find reception with you, yet when any good thing and worthy is said of Doctor BRETON, the people of Dept∣ford cannot choose but make much of it. I know of none that could give him a trivial Character, his Enemies (if he had any) must confess, that he was
blameless in his life, an able Minister, apt to teach, diligent and frequent; and those that knew him well, and loved him cordially, can say many more good things of him.

But 'tis enough that 'tis sent to you, who had so great value for him, and so general affection to him, that the meanest gift for his sake will be ac∣cepted.
It may be, God hath regarded your
many tears for your loss in so good a Man, and sees how heartily you lov'd him, because your Pastor, and a faithful one. — And it may be, God will pro∣vide another such Blessing for you, be∣cause you will esteem him highly for his Work sake, for which ye ought to pray; and when you have such another Guide for your Souls, to give God thanks, and treat him kindly; which if you be so happy to enjoy, I doubt not you will do: for I never yet saw so great a lamentation at once, as at the Funerals of Dr. BRETON: And when you have another like him, I wish he may not by a speedy remove put you again to a second sorrow; and my Prayers for you are, That as he taught you how to live, that you might dye happily, so, that you would observe Practically what I have
offered in the Discourse; that you would so order your affairs, that you may be found of him in peace and well doing, that you may be for ever Blessed, as I make no question He did, and is; and I hope he will be found so doing, who was his, and is
