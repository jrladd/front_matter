 postle complaineth. Euery man seeketh his owne things, & none he things of Christ Jesus. But what saith the Scripture? Non prohibet Euangelium nisi cu∣piditatem, non praecipit nisi haritatem. The Gospel (saith Austin) doth not prohibit any hing more then incroaching co¦etousnesse, it enioynes nothing so much as dilating charitie. It is  poore center of a mans action, Himselfe. Jt is right earth, as a reat Scholler speaketh. Where∣ore, let vs attend then to the A∣postles rule, who wils, that euery e should seeke anothers wealth; & he prescribes vs no other rule, en that he himselfe walked in. Non quaero quid mihi vtile ed quid multis, I seeke not ine owne profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saued.
