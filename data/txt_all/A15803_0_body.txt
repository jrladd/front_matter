GENTLEMEN: I doe not present this Translation vnto you, to the end to incite you to Militarie cogitations. Your forwardnesse that way is such alreadie, as rather deserueth commendation, than requireth any mans words of incitement or exhortation; neither will I at this time enter into the large field of the praise of the Art of Warre; espe∣cially lest I should haply incurre the censure of the old Prouerbe: Suum cuique pulchrum. But see∣ing you haue taken the laudable paines to attaine to the knowledge of handling your Armes, and of the seuerall motions of a battell requisite for the seruice of the Field, wherein many of you may iustly chal∣lenge

the praise of equalling, if not exceeding the greatest number of Souldiers, that haue a long time followed the warres in forein parts, in which also it hath pleased you to vse my poore endeuour; I haue thought good to adioine to your former Speculation (I hope I may vse that word, considering you haue not yet come to the sight of an Enemie, nor proceeded vsque ad sanguinem) and to present vnto you in your owne Language, a Precedent of Warre of another nature, than you haue hitherto beene exercised in, that is to say, the greatest March and Retreat, that euer was found in any Historie; wherein are notable Strata∣gems set out of resisting a multitude of Enemies in an open Field, of passing Mountaines possessed by an E∣nemie, of leading an Armie thorow Straights, thorow Forests, thorow Woods, thorow Riuers, ouer Bridges, of laying and auoiding Ambushes, of Marching by night, of resisting Horse, of stilling Souldiers muti∣nies, of escaping Enemies machinations, of taking in Forts, of making prouision for an Armie; in a word, of all accidents, that may fall out in a long and dan∣gerous March. In reading whereof, besides the va∣rietie of discourse, you may obserue many documents fit for a worthy Souldiers consideration. For they are not to be heard that contemne the experience of for∣mer Times, and thinke, that the policies vsed by anci∣ent Generals match or sute not with our moderne Warres. From whence, I pray, are deriued our Mo∣tions, and whole manner of exercise now in vse, but from Antiquitie? Neither is there any other true

difference to be found betwixt vs and Antiquitie, in the vniuersall course Militarie, saue only in the vse of Gunnes: Of which the great Ordinance succeed in the place of ancient Engines of Battery; the smaller Peeces in place of Arrowes, Slings, and Darts▪ Now as I must confesse, that the force and violence of Gunnes is farre greater, than of the weapons mis∣siue vsed in time past; so me thinks I may truly maintaine, that their place in Battell, and elsewhere, is altogether the same: Shot must haue defence either from Pikes or from other aduantage of ground, or else they are subiect to be scattered or ouer-runne by Horse, or the like, as well as the light-armed of old time. But hereof I shall haue other opportunitie to speake. My desire is at this instant that you will be pleased to accept this presentation, with the same minde it is offered vnto you by
16 Maij 1623.
