GReat enuies Obiect, Worth & Wisedoms pride,
Natures delight, Arcadia's heire most fitte,
Vouchsafe a while to lay thy taske aside,
Let Petrarke sleep, giue rest to Sacred Writte,
Or bowe, or string will breake, if euer tied,
Some little pawse aideth the quickest witte:
Nay, heau'ns themselues (though keeping stil their way)
Retrogradate, and make a kind of stay.


I neither sing Achilles baneful ire,
Nor Man, nor Armes, nor Belly-brothers warres,
Nor Britaine broiles, nor citties drownd in fire,
Nor Hectors wounds, nor Diomedes skarres,
Cease country Muse so highly to aspire:
Our Plaine beholds but cannot holde such starres:
Ioue-loued wittes may write of what they will,
But meaner Theams beseeme a Farmers quill.


I sing of little Wormes and tender Flies,
Creeping along, or basking on the ground,
Grac't once with those thy heau'nly-humane eies,
Which neuer yet on meanest scholler fround:
And able are this worke to aeternise,
From East to West about this lower Round,
Deigne thou but breathe a sparke or little flame
Of likeing, to enlife for aye the same.
