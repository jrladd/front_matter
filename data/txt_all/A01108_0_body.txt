MOST MIGHTY MONARCH▪ and MY DREAD SOVERAIGNE.
SEeing that it hath plea∣sed You to examine the En∣deavours of those formerly imployed towards the search of the North-west Passage, and that it hath bin Your Highnesse pleasure, to examine me Your meanest Subject, concerning the hope of a further Discoverie, how it formerly had fayled; and what better helpes could now be produced, appointing me Your Highnesse Pinnace the CHARLES, with Your Royall Instructions for my bet∣ter proceeding, which unto me was the greatest Honour that ever Subject received, (and at my Returne continuing Your Royall and Gracious favour, commanding me unto Your Royall Presence to deliver my Accompts;) hath since im∣boldened me to examine with my selfe thus farre, that here∣by

(as duty obligeth) I might bring some better satisfaction to your Royall demand; which was, Whether there were a Passage or no, and were I capable thereof at my being neere the same? But since that meditation and contemplation hath gi∣ven me more insight thereinto, than Speculation at that in∣stant could; For it was not possible for me to frame any Conclusion, untill I had circuted the Bay of Hudson and But∣ton, whereby I might find from whence a new Tyde (which I found there) should come; and heere SIR, I prostrate my Accompt in particular, which then I presented in generall.
I begin with King ARTHVR his Conquests, and so pro∣ceeds to all those Discoveries (that I can find Antiquity hath preserved) towards the North-west, untill this Your owne time; to show, how those Maynes, Ilands, and Continents, they have discovered, doth like dew from Heaven deseend upon Your Royall Throne; so as most Dread Soveraigne, the true Right thereto is Yours, which I pray may be aug∣mented unto the furthest bounds of the East and W. Ocean.
I doe not onely bring to show, but put your Majesty in mind of what you know: knowing that your Majesty being called by more weighty affaires of State, may passe by (unre∣membred) such small Trifles as this; yet observing Your Highnesse willingnesse to promote Navigation and those dis∣covering Enterprises, hath made me thus presume.
I have endeavored the probability of a Passage, praying un∣to Almighty GOD, to set it as a faire Iewell in your Royall Crowne, and bring to passe in those happie dayes which wee doe enjoy under your Gracious and godly Gouernment; Ra∣ther than some Forraigne Prince or State, should advance and finde the same. These shall bee the prayers, with Your long life and prosperous Raigne,
