May it please your Grace,
THough I cannot but ac∣knowledge my pre∣sumption to be great (since heing a stranger to your Grace, I should thus aspire to a Favour I may have rea∣son to fear the obtaining; yet when I give ear to fame, me-thinks I find my self not altogether a stranger to what is most Noble in so Noble a person; & as glit∣tering
 Stars by reason of their glorious lustre are loo∣ked upon with wonder, and even worshipped by us mor∣tals in several parts of the Ʋniverse; even so (dread Madam) your worth, per∣fections, and vertues shine so clearly and untaintedly, and strike such an awe into my amazed spirit, that I cannot but think how justly I have deserved your frowns for my Arrogancy in presen∣ting to your Grace a thing so Inconsiderable, as is

 than by observing what she saith of You.
If your Grace shall vouch∣safe a favourable Accep∣tance of these my first fruits, my happiness is compleated in having obtained the ho∣nour of bearing the unfeign∣ed Title of
