My Lord,
NOthing was wanting to com∣pleat
the Happiness of this
Fortunate Slave, but to fall into
the hands of so Generous a Pa∣tron
as your Lordship. And I
who had undertaken to furnish
him, was willing to find him one
so qualified, that he might have
reason to be well pleased with my
Choice. To whom then could I

with more Reason Address my
self for making this Present, than
to a Lord, who by Excellent Qua∣lities,
as well as Eminent Birth,
every day gains Slaves and Crea∣tures
to himself. To satisfie any
of the truth of what I say, they
need not make a particular en∣quiry,
or hearken after the Pub∣lick
Attestations of this Kingdom.
The Fame of your Glory extends
beyond England; there is not in
Europe a Court, where it hath
not arrived, to gain you the Heart
and Admiration of the best. But,
my Lord, to know your Merit
more perfectly, we need only con∣sider
the particular esteem always
had for you by the greatest and
most discerning Monarch in the
World; the choice he hath made
of your Person for the greatest
Employments of War, and the
most important Negotiations of
Peace; the weight and stress he

lays on your Advice, and the con∣fidence
wherewith he relies on
the clearness of your Judgment,
and greatness of your Capacity
in his Council. How fair a Field,
my Lord, are your Praises to en∣large
on, were my Faculties pro∣portionable
to my Subject, or my
Offerings of value answerable to
the Dignity of the Person they
are made to, but the Enterprize
is too vast and too difficult for
such an Author as I; and your
Glory stands so sure in that uni∣versal
esteem the whole World
hath for you, that it hath no
need of new Elogies or Panegy∣ricks.
It becomes me better to
study your Pleasure: The Happy
Slave hath an impatient desire to
entertain your leisure hours with
the Relation of his Adventures.
And if he prove so happy, as not
to displease you, I shall esteem it
the highest piece of good Fortune

he hath met with in his Life; at
least, I believe he cannot desire
any thing with greater passion,
unless it be, that he who hath
taken the Liberty to present him
to you, may with all due respect
subscribe himself,
My Lord,
