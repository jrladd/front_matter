WORTHY FRIENDS.
MOst Certaine it is, that Warre hath bad its
Originall from the very foundation of So∣veraignety, ad thence was reduced to an
Art, confined within limited rules, and principles,
and may (in these our times) be said to be either forraigne or 
 Domestique, and that either offensive, or
defen∣sive, preserving, and upholding some Nations, and Countries, and
destroying, and runing others; but
still the rule, and true scope of a lust Warre amongst all Nations, is
held to be a firme Peace, which as it is best obtained with the
Sword in hand, so is it best confirmed, by a prevalent
Victory, to compasse which many Authors have undertaken
to laie downe Rules, some through Military Discipline, some
through Valor and Policie, and most through
blood∣shedd, yet such defects are found in many of their
precepts, that no positive rules can be col∣lected
thence, which in all points can make good the same, for it
must be confessed, that they who frame to themselves, in their studies a
mo∣dell of le deing of an Army, to be come Victo∣rious, find the same as
full of Errors, as of Rules, when the application is made for
a mea∣sure of Warre taken by booke, falleth out either too
long, or too short, when it is brought into the field,
to be put in practise, and somtimes such unlooked for chances, arest
even the best, and most experienced Captaines (though long
acquainted with the Warres) that their skill is  not
priviledged from casualties, nor their Iudgments, and knowledg▪
from Vaniety of accidents, because a minute produeth that in the field which an Age hath not
seene no nr heard of before.
Notwithstanding these difficulties, and
un∣certainties, I have indeavored for my owne re∣creation, to collect
the most certaine of these rules of Warrefare, being such as admit of
the least contradiction, and concluded the same in three Centuries,
which I have termed Military Observations, and are the most materiall
with∣in the compase of a Soldiers & Captains know∣ledg,
either before the Warre begun, or in the prosecution thereof, or after
the Victory gai∣ned: the first is confirmed by the authority and aprovement of
Antient authors, and serves as a ground-worke to the second,
confirmed by rea∣son, and experience, and both of these to
the third, confirmed, and made good by practise, and the
example of the greatest Captaines that have left their
memories registred in the bookes of honour behind them to posterity;
the two latter may hereafter see the light; if this former
find a favrable construction in
the  World, and a friendly acceptance from you, to whose
love in respect of our Vnited bro∣therly affection, and friendship, I have
presumed to Dedicate the same, & that in testimony of the
Oblige∣ment dew to your place from him that Inti∣tles
him∣selfe
