TIs Flora calls, bright Beauty come
Walk forth and view Elizium,
Where happy Lovers, crown'd with Flowr's,
Do sit and sing, in still-green Bow'rs;
And many smiling Virgins stand,
Humbly expecting your Command.
Here Coy Adonis from his Bed
Will rise, and raise his drooping Head,
Warm'd and Inspir'd by you, grow Wise,
And fall no more Love's Sacrifice;
Yield to Your Beauties greater pow'r,
For you may pluck his Virgin Flow'r.
Self-lov'd Narcissus if he look
On your fair Eyes, will leave the Brook,
And Undeceived, soon will rue
He ever any Lov'd but You.
If to the Hyacinth you turn,
He Smiles, and quite forgets to Mourn.
The inamour'd Heliotrope will run
To your bright Stars, and leave the Sun.
Our Lillies here do make no show,
They Whiter on your Bosom grow,
And Violets appear but Stains,
Compared with your blewer Veins:
Yet to Invoke you, when they bow,
Propitious Heaven perfumes their Vow.
The Cowslip Cups, by Heba fill'd
With Nectar, from the Gods distill'd,
Presented is unto your Taste,
That Beauties prime may ever last.
New-blown Buds, all Scents excelling,
As you pass by, invite your Smelling.
The crafty Flow'rs well knowing this
The onely sleight to steal a Kiss.
Mark how the glorious Tulips rise
In Various dress, to take your Eyes,
And how the fair'st and all the rest
Strive, which shall triumph on your Brest.
But heark, methinks near yonder Well,
I hear the voice of Philomel,
Seeming to challenge a dispute,
'Twixt her shrill Voice and your sweet Lute:
Alas poor Bird thou wantest Art,
One touch of Yours will break her Heart,
And as she falls, Sing but one strain,
'Twill peece her broken Heart again.
Thus your rich Beauty and rare Parts
Excel all Flow'rs, exceed all Arts.
Live then sweet Lady, to inherit
Your Fathers Fortune, and his Spirit,
Your Mothers Face, and Vertuous Mind,
Then dye a Saint, and be Enshrin'd.
