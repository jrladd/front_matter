TO you deare Mother, doe I offer these,
My poore endeuours; which I doe im∣plore,
And begg of God-allmightie, on my knees,
At their arriuall, may find ope, the dore.
Of your desires, What pittie can∣not moue
For its one sake, may enter by my loue.
Let mee noe longer, frutelesse sacri∣fice,
Vppon the sacred Altar of sinceare
Deuotion offe with tear-tricklinge eyes

Dride vpp with sighs; redoubled are with feare
Which wakes my thoughts, with a perpetuall fright
In the dead-silent howers of the night.
To thinke, the wombe wherein I was conceau'd;
The louinge Breasts, which first gaue nourishment,
Vnto my tender yeares; whose armes receau'd,
Into the bosome of such sweete content,
My Infancy; which tenderly to wrapp
They tooke delight; lay'd prostrat on the lapp,
Of more then common-care; should: what? Alas
Must I pronounce the sentence; Perrish? ô noe,
Heauens forbide the fatall howerglasse,
Is nott yett runne: Though itt draw too too lowe

Returne my dearest Sunamite, re∣turne,
Let not in vaine, thy holy off'rings burne.
T'was noe small greefe you seem'd for to expres
With pittie moueinge plaints, and pro∣mises
By which you did coniure mee (no-Lesse
Deare to my soule then yours) to ban∣nish these
Religious enterprises. What will bee?
The Greefe, when wee must part, and neuer see.
Each other, thinke you? Nether is that all,
For in the day of wrath and indigna∣tion
Men shall reioice to see their Parents fall,
By the iust iudgement of Gods ordina∣tion▪

Thus much my filiall duty forst mee too
The rest I leaue to Iesus Christ and you.
