Noble Sir,
THe Author of this Trea∣tise lived as deep in your affections, as you lived high in his devoti∣ons. His great studie was to ad∣vance you in Spirituals, yet he was willing to return some considerable Retributions to you, so far as he was intrusted by you, in Secular af∣fairs. You are now pleased to lay that weighty imployment upon me alone, in which I ever found him a prudent and faithfull Assistant. And I shall
 pray that your many undeserved Fa∣vours, and the honour of so high a Trust, may be in some gratefull pro∣portion answered, by the happy suc∣cess of that duty and service which I owe to so Noble a Family, and so great a Charge.
Sir, this Book will teach this cor∣rupt Age the necessity of Rege∣neration, by which whosoever is entred into the kingdom of Grace, hath the truth of his first Baptism by Water effectually sealed unto him, and needs no second Water-Baptism to transmit him into the Kingdom of Glory. They who are baptized by the Spirit of Christ unto Regeneration, and by His blood to Justification, shall by the help of the same Spirit be more and
 more baptized unto further degrees of Sanctification. That You and Your dear Relations may know and feel the power of these Myste∣rious Truths, (with as much sweet∣ness and comfort as I wish to my self and mine) is and shall be the prayer of;
Sir,
