Gentlemen,
I Here present that Sermon unto your eyes, which was Preached unto your Ears in your Parish Church, on the 3d. of this instant November. I might have saved my self and you that labour, had not some Tongues charged me with railing at the Kings Church; for some so are pleased to call their New Erected Congregations in Contradistinction to the Church of England, Established by the known Laws of this famous Kingdome. Sirs, If I have spoken amiss in any part, or parcel of the ensuing discourse, bear witness against me: but if I have discharged my Conscience so far as became a Loyal Subject to his Majesty, and an obedient Son of the Church of Eng∣land, no way Thwarting his Majesties Declara∣tion in indulging his loving Subjects, and wherein Himself hath declared his express Resolution, Mean∣ing, and Intention to be, That, the Church of Eng∣land be preserved, and remain entire in its Doctrine, Discipline, and Government, as now it stands Esta∣blished
by Law. And this be taken to be, as it is, the Basis, Rule, and Standard of the general and publick worship, &c. You will be pleased to take this my humble Prostration of this ensuing Sermon, as a sin∣cere acknowledgment of my Obedience to his Majesty, and all that are put in Authority under him, both in Church and State; and as a pledg of my hearty love to the publick Peace, as well as to your selves, whom with all that call upon the Name of the Lord Jesus. Christ in sincerity, I commend to your gracious di∣rection and protection of Almighty God, in whom I Rest
Chediock, Novem∣ber the 18th. 1672.
