I Send you a Present which (though not answerable to my obligati∣ons)
is doubtless the greatest that Nicolo Machiavelli was able
to send, having expressed in it whatever I know or have learned
by a long practice, and continued reading of the affairs of this World
than which neither you nor any body else being to expect more, I am
not to be blamed if my Present be no better. You may complain in∣deed
of the poverty of my parts, my narrations being so poor; and of
the weakness of my judgment, having perhaps mistaken in many
places of my Discourses: if so, I know not which of us is less obliged to
the other, I to you, for having forced me to write against my own in∣clination,
or you to me, for having perform'd it no more to your sa∣tisfaction.
Accept it then in the same manner as things are accepted
from friends, among whom the intention of the giver is always more
considered than the quality of the gift, and believe that as oft as I
think of it, I am satisfied in this, that however I have been mistaken
in many other circumstances, I have done wisely in this, having cho∣sen
you above all others for the dedication of my Discourses, both be∣cause
in not doing it, I should have shewn my self in some measure in∣grateful
for the benefits received, and in doing it, I have trans∣gressed
the common custom of Authors, who for the most part direct
their Works to some Prince, and (blinded with ambition and avarice)
applaud and magnifie him for all the virtuous qualities, when per∣chance
they ought rather to have reproached him with all the vices
imaginable. To avoid that error, I have made choice, not of those
who are actually Princes, but of such as by their infinite good parts
do merit to be so; not of those who are actually able to advance me
to Honours, Employments, and Wealth, but to those, who though un∣able,
would do it if they could: for, to judge right, men are rather to
esteem those in whose nature, than those in whose power it is to be li∣beral,
and those who understand how to govern a Kingdom, than
those who do govern it without that understanding. Accordingly
Authors do commend Hiero the Syracusan, though but a private
person, above Perseus of Macedon, though a great King: because
to Hiero there was nothing wanting to be an Excellent Prince, but
a Principality; and Perseus had nothing but a Kingdom to recom∣mend
him to be King. Accept then) whether it be good or bad)
what you commanded your selves, and if you be so far in an error
as to approve my opinions, I shall not fail to pursue the rest of my
History, as I promised in the beginning. Farewel.
