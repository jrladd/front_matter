My Lord,
THE Pictures of Ce∣lebrated Beauties may surprize, and be ve∣ry acceptable to Strangers; but those that have the op∣portunity
to approach a Charming Face, where Na∣ture triumphs over Art, by displaying a thousand Graces that defie the imitation of a Pencil; will readily discover the Imperfections of a Sha∣dow, and perceive how far short the Draught falls of the Original. This Considera∣tion were enough to deter me from presenting your Ho∣nour with these Memoirs of the most August and Heroick King of Poland, whose Spar∣kling Virtues you have had the Happiness to view and
contemplate near hand, and in their Direct Rays, and therefore can scarce without indignation behold them thus dully represented at distance in Broken Idea's, and as it were but by Refraction of their Illustrious Beams.
The Glorious Atchievments of this Mighty King are the Happiness of Our Present Age, and will be the Wonder and Envy of those to come, as well as the Reproach of times past; for I must avow, I have not met with any Hero men∣tioned in History, Ancient

signal Services upon the Place, and near this most Illustrious Prince, have rendred you fa∣mous throughout Europe, by particular Marks of Ho∣nour, deservedly conferr'd from the Imperial Majesty.
Valour and Loyaltie are Qualities inherent in the Greenviles; Nothing could be added to that Pater∣nal Stock of Renown you inherit, but by spreading it further in Regions remote▪ Nor could your Lordship have an ampler Theatre where∣on to display your Early
Gallantry, or a more Noble Cause to engage in, than for the common Safety of Chri∣stendom, at a time when so many Kingdoms and Estates did with weary Eyes, and trembling Hearts expect the Issue.
That Almighty God may inspire all Christian Princes with a just and mutual Charity, to unite against the Common Enemies of our most Holy Religion, and root out Infidelity and Prophaneness, shall alwaies
the Prayer, and that your Honour would pardon the Presumption of this Ad∣dress, is the present Re∣quest of
