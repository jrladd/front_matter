SIR,
YOur Sermon preached at the Funeral of the late eminent Bishop of Ex∣ceter, hath been and is of that general acceptation, that those that heard it, or have heard of it, do consent in their earnest de∣sires of us to write unto you for its publishing; The honor in it due to that learned Prelate, as a memo∣rial of him, the great benefit which will arise to the Church both in the present age and future, the seasona∣bleness of the manifestation of his judgement in several subjects, and the happy fruit which may be reap∣ed
by the Reader, in the imitation of his exemplary life and pious conver∣sation (to Gods glory and the good of souls) these do sufficiently of themselves bespeak your inclina∣tion to it: But we do also make it our request, that you will be plea∣sed with all convenient speed to print it, which as it will satisfie the expectation of your many other Friends, so will it much oblige

Grays-Inn. Decb. 23. 1659.
