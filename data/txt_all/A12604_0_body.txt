THis meane labour and work of mine (Right Worship∣full, and my worthie Friend) framed onely for the Pulpit, not for the Presse, and in∣tended onely to the eares, not to the eyes of men, had not at this time, in this shape and forme, presented it self to your view, If either I could haue satisfied the impor∣tunitie
 of many of my Friends, which did earnestly solicite me to print the same, or could haue preuented the purpose of o∣thers, whom without breach of charitie I may in some sense tearme my Foes, who (as I had a watch-word giuen me) were minded, in case I could not bee thereunto entreated; to set forth in print those bro∣ken and vnperfect notes, which they tooke from my mouth, at the time when I deli∣uered this Sermon.
And here, I confesse, I was brought in∣to a strait, by my Friends on the one side, & my Foes on the other: So that although I had long since put on a settled purpose, to publish no Pamphlets, in this Scribbling Age, wherein so much paper is blotted, and wherein so many, as soone as they haue but laid an egge, do presently cackle, and bewray an itching humour of beeing in print; yet as one that had forgot him∣selfe, I haue relapsed, and by a kinde of constraint haue fallen (as you see) from my first and best resolution; and so by pleasing others, haue displeased my selfe.

But, howsoeuer; I rest assured, your loue to mee, will excuse mee, and will take in good parte this Paper-Present, which reacheth out the hand vnto you, for acceptance: the rather, for that in one part and passage thereof, it putteth you & others of your ranke in mind of that which You seldome forget, namely, that as God hath been very gratious to you, in blessing you, not only with great abundance of tem∣porall blessings, nor onely with a wise & vnderstanding, but with a pious and re∣ligious heart, and in these respects hath made you great; so you should striue by all means to blesse & honor him, from whom you haue your greatnesse: as also for that it commeth from such a one, whose de∣sire is, that all they who vouchsafe to reade these lines should knowe, that the Author of them, is one of those many, which honour your Vertues, and loue your Person.
