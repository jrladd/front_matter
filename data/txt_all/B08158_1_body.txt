The Epistle.
THou high-borne Of spring of the best of men,
To thy prote∣ction my vnlearned pen

Doth creepe for shelter; though my booke be small,
In substance, t' is no lesse then all in all.

The Cedar shields the shrub from win∣ters flawes,
And Greatnesse guards the least, frō Enuies Iawes.

So I the worst, (that in these times doe write)
Implores your Grace t'accept this worthlesse mite.
