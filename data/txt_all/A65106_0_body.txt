My Lord,
IT hath been the custome of the most knowing men, to dedicate their Labours to Persons of that quality, from whom with ju∣stice they might expect both pro∣tection
and honour. Our Nation hath not been unfruitful of such, with some difference of degrees, though at present under a cloud: and it can∣not be thought flattery while I make my humble addresse to your Lord∣ship, my ambition enjoys the best; since You are not only descended from Scepter'd Ancestors, (from whose influence I may derive a mo∣dest security) but endowed with those abilities of Judgment and Sci∣ence, to know, and place an exem∣plary value upon Dedications of this nature. So that I may take up that of the famous Lyrick in my just application to your Lordship:
Maecenas atavis edite Regibus, O & praesidium, & dulce decus meum.

And that it might not be thought a stain to so great a Patron, I have presurned (which is the second part of my bold undertaking) to wait on your Honour with no lesse then the Prince of Latine Poets; though in relation to my self, I call it but the shadow, and cold resemblance of Virgil. And although this Transla∣tion (for it is hard to render weight for weight, and measure for measure) may relish more of Thrace then Greece, having been bred in phleg∣matick Regions, and among people returning to their ancient barbarity; And that our English Wooll may seem but an unworthy habit for that Muse, which from her conception was adorn'd with all the gold and
spoils of Italie, the most glorious Mistresse of the world: Yet if your Lordship shall be pleas'd to smile upon the dresse she now wears, it may live to be be receiv'd (when time shall ripen more ornament of Sculpture and Annotations) with none of the meanest attempts of this nature; And the Translator though unworthy, encouraged by Your gracious acceptance, shall most gratefully acknowledge himself,
My Lord,
