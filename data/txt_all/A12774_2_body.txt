MOst faire and vertuous La∣die; hauing often sought op∣portunitie by some good meanes to make knowen to your Ladiship, the hum∣ble affection and faithfull duetie, which I haue alwaies professed, and am bound to beare to that House, from whence yee spring, I haue at length found occasion to remē∣ber the same, by making a simple present to you of these my idle labours; which hauing long sithens composed in the raw conceipt of my youth, I late∣ly amongst other papers lighted vpon, and was by others, which liked the same, mooued to set thē foorth. Simple is the deuice, and the compositi∣on meane, yet carrieth some delight, een the ra∣ther because of the simplicitie & meannesse thus personated. The same I beseech your Ladiship

take in good part, as a pledge of that profession which I haue made to you, and keepe with you vntill with some other more worthie labour, I do redeeme it out of your hands, and discharge my vtmost dutie. Till then wishing your Ladiship all increase of honour and happinesse, I humblie take leaue.
