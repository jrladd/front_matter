May it please your Honour:
YOur conference
with me, about
my conference
with the Iesu∣ites,
and your
gracious acceptation of the re∣lation
and defence thereof, left
in me such an impression of the
Character of your Noble and

Religious disposition, that I e∣uer
since desired the aduantage
of some good opportunitie to te∣stifie
my dutifull respect to your
Honour. The truth of God re∣ceiueth
not onely support, but
great honour from the patro∣nage
and countenance of great
Personages; and she much glo∣rieth
in finding so strong a
Champion, euen in the weaker
sexe. Albeit the Sun-beames
are alwayes most bright in
themselues, yet they neuer ap∣peare
so glorious to vs as when
they fall vpon crystall glasse,
or pretious stones: In like sort
Religion and vertue (the raies
of diuine light in the soule) al∣though
they shine alwayes
brightly in themselues, yet
they neuer seeme so conspicuous
and resplendent, as when they
receiue some luster from the

subiect; when Nobilitie of birth
and minde concurre; when or∣naments
of bodie and soule
meete; when eminencie of grace
& eminency of conditions toyne
in one, and reflect mutually each
on the other. And verily if your
more then or dinarie fauour and
respect to the Ministers of the
Gospell, and to my selfe in par∣ticular,
had not made this my
voluntarie oblation a neces∣sarie
obligation to your Ladi∣ship;
yet your constancie in the
truth, and loue to Sion and her
solemne and sacred assemblies,
might iustly challenge to your
Honour the Dedication of this
part of my HAND-MAIDES
Taske, which is to furnish Chri∣stian
fastes and feasts with pro∣per
MEDITATIONS, HYMNES
and PRAYERS. As our bodie
liues to the soule, by which it

liueth; so our soule should liue to
God by whom it liueth. And
no otherwise is the life of the
bodie preserued by heate and
moisture, then the life of the
soule is maintained and kept by
the heate of diuine loue, and ra∣dicall
moisture of teares bedew∣ing
the heart roote of a true pe∣nitent.
To kindle the one and
feede the other, I Dedicate and
deuote the DEVOTION of
this part of my HAND-MAIDE
to your Honour. For the feasts
representing to your Religious
thoughts what Christ hath
done for you, will (through the
blasts of Gods Spirit) inflame
the heate of heauenly loue in
you: and the fasts admonishing
you what Christ hath suffered
for you, must needs yeeld aboun∣dant
matter to supply the
springs of godly sorrow. In hea∣uen

ioy taketh vp all times and
parts; in hell sorrow; on earth
they diuide. In heauen there is
ioy without sorrow; in hell, sor∣row
without ioy; on earth sor∣row
and ioy act their parts;
fasts and feasts haue their cour∣ses;
mirth and mourning their
turnes; and at euerie turne my
HAND-MAIDE is readie to
attend you, either with sack∣cloth
for the one, or the wed∣ding
garment for the other. S.
Bernard taking his ground
from those words of the Prophet
Ioel, Rent your hearts &c. and
returne to the Lord with your
whole heart; thus pleasantly
descanteth therupon:Non est ad Deum too corde redite, nisi∣scisso cor∣de. We can∣not
returne vnto the Lord
with our whole heart vnlesse
it be broken first with true con∣trition.
There is no whole
heart, but a rent heart; no

sound heart, but a broken; & S.
Ierome according in the same
note, summeth vp the whole
practice of a deuoute soule in
her priuate carriage with God
in these wordsDolet, & de dolore gaudet. She sorroweth
after a godly manner, and re∣ioyceth
for that sorrow. Godly
sorrow for sinne, and holy ioy
for that sorrow, is the whole
Deuoute man. Madame, if my
Meditations vpon the fasting,
suffering, and death of our Sa∣uiour
make you sad and sorrow∣full,
remember out of S. Ie∣rome
that you ought to be ioy∣full
for such sorrow. If the pier∣cing
Texts of holy Seripture in
the ADMONITIONS and
HYMNES appointed for the
Christian fasts, diuide betweene
your soule and spirit, and bruse
if not breake your heart with an
holy sympathy, remember out of

S. Bernard, that There is no
returning to God with a
whole heart, but by breaking
it. And if you find in the whole
Deuotion of Fasts, matter of
pensiuenesse and griefe; in the
Christian feasts, you shall haue
store of oyle to make you a cheer∣full
countenance, and reuiue
your deaded thoughts. The
heart of a man is in continuall
motion; it alwayes either dila∣teth
it selfe, or contracteth: and
the hidden man of the heart in
like manner hath his Systole
and Diastole, (as the Anato∣mists
speake:) his heart con∣tinually
either enlargeth it selfe
by ioy, or contracteth it selfe by
sorrow. And no doubt, when
God bespeakes our hearts for
himselfe, he especially expects
and respects these motions
thereof and affections produ∣cing

them. He will haue vs
ioy in him, and sorrow and
long after him. Ioy in his fa∣uour,
and sorrow in his displea∣sure.
Ioy in his promise, and
sorrow at his threates. Ioy in
the holy Ghost, and sorrow in
our owne spirits. Feast to him
in a thankefull profession of his
gracious goodnesse, and fast to
him in an humble confession of
sinfull wickednesse. Like the
Heliotropium, turne alwayes
to the Sunne; open when he
sheddeth abroade his beames,
and shut when he draweth
them in: Inlarge our hearts
with ioy at his gracious pre∣sence,
and sorrowfully shut and
contract them when he is, or
seemeth to be absent from vs.
Thus if our ioy be the interpre∣ter
of our loue to him, and our
sorrow of our desire of him; if

our ioy be holy, and our sorrow
holy; if our feasts be feasts of
Deuotion, and our fasts be
fasts of contrition, our graci∣ous
Redeemer will vouchsafe to
be present at both: he will
feast and fast with vs. At our
fasts he will weepe for our spiri∣tuall,
as he did for Lazarus his
corporall death. At our feasts he
will turne our water into wine,
and rauish our soules with hea∣uenly
melodie. Our feasts shall
be as temperate and holy as
fasts, and our fasts as comforta∣ble
as feasts. A good conscience
shall be vnto vs a continuall
feast here, and the Marriage
supper of the Lamb an euerla∣sting
feast hereafter. To both
which feasts, God by his Spirit,
which biddeth you, bring you for
his sake, who by his fasts and
sorrowes on earth hath purcha∣sed

for vs euerlasting feasts
and ioyes in heauen; In whom
I rest,
