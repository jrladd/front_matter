MY LORD,
WHat formerly was in single Arrows, is here bound in a Sheaf, I conceive it good that by such conjunction, they might mutually reflect light one on another. Posterity will probably be pleased to look back on such passages. Some love to see the little coats they then did wear when children. Alas, these all were the Essayes in the Infancy of our Li∣berty, now grown a stripling, God send it to be a Man! yet they differ rather in Sound than in Sense, variously expressing the same matter. So many men, and but one minde, is admirable; prompted certainly by the Spirit of unity inditing them. Factious Petitions, gave the beginning, and Loyal Declarations must give the end to our

Miseries. But here is the difference, the first were made by the Scum, these by the Cream of the Na∣tion. Aeneas did beg the Boon of the Sybil, that she would not write her Oracles (according to her usual course) in leaves of Trees blown away with every wind.
These Declarations formerly were printed in Leaves or single Papers, which are soon lost, not to say, The best of Papers so printed, are oft con∣signed to the worst of uses. This is a way to pre∣serve, and to propagate them. I remember the Verse of the Poet,

Singula cum valeant sunt meliora simul,
Take each of them asunder, good as either,

Then needs they must be best, all put together. What (as single Stars) was good, must be best in a Constellation.
God happily perfect what is so hopefully be∣gun by your Honour, though my voice is too weak to be the Eccho to the sound of the whole Nation:
