ALthough it bee true (Right Ho∣nourable) which is commonly spo∣ken, that great men haue many eares, and that the eyes of many are vpon the rich, yet I know it to be as true, that they haue as fewe true friends as any, for who more licentious and out of order, and who more incorrigibly and vnreprooued, walke in wickednesse then many of them? Let experience speake, and yet either the timerousnes of their professed friends, or their owne greatnes, keepe such as should, farre from entring into reproofe of them, and such as would, withhold themselues from it, because most commonly both they and their true friendship finde hard enter∣tainment. I haue therefore Right Honourable,
 (presuming vpon your kind acceptation of what I haue done) made bolde to dedicate this little worke vnto you, that you may haue that dayly in your hands and before your eyes, which once sounded in your eares. The reasons ensuing I hope will excuse my boldnesse, and pleade, yea, preuaile for kind entertainement. For first, to whome doth it of right more belong to, then to your selfe, both in respect of the place where it was preached, your attention and readinesse in hearing, (especially when you in particular were spoken to) and the matter therein contained? which doth as much, if not more, concerne you then any that were hearers there that day, both for the instigating of you to discountenance sinne, by stopping the streame and course of ma∣ny grosse corruptions in your Citie, which GOD calleth for at your hands, in respect of your place, as also to the countenancing of good in all wel∣doers. Secondly, we are all through our owne in bred corruption, and the readinesse of the de∣uill to choke good things begun, more ready not to heare, and forget hauing heard, then to heare: remember, and practise what is taught, which
 moueth me by writing to bee a Monitor to your Honour, of that I was by my mouth. Lastly your kind acceptation of it being heard, as appeared by your speech to me, your professed resolution to doe what you might (though you could not doe what you would) with your honourable re∣spect (as to all Ministers comming to that place so) to me, challengeth this labour onely to your selfe. These reasons considered, I hope (right Honourable) this Glasse which I dedicate vnto you without all sinister respect, (onely ayming at Gods glory therein, your good, and the good of your renowmed Citie,) will not onely bee en∣tertained of you, but carefully looked on by you from day to day, it will proue one of the faith∣fullest Monitors and soundest friends about you, it will lye for no cause, it will not call white blacke, nor blacke white, it will not be meale mouthed, it will not be bribed by kindnesse to conceale your errours if you goe awry, nor moued by vnkinde dealing to exclaime of you, and say more then is true, or require more then is your due to pay to God, and the place ouer which God hath called you to rule, therefore what more worthy enter∣tainement
 then such a true and trusty Friend? which not doubting of, I will cease from further troubling your Lordship with vnnecessary lines, though not cease to pray for you, that you may so walke and proue your selfe a man in this your present Office, as the issue thereof may be to the glory of God, the good of this Citie, and the true peace of your owne Conscience.
