My Lord,
YOu will pardon the bold∣ness of this Dedication, from one who is un∣known to your Lordship, when you have considered the consan∣guinitie, or near relation of the Authour of the ensuing work to your most Noble person.
If we add to this (a forcible tie or obligation of love) his Autonomy, his bearing the same name with your Lordship, both

as man and Christian, likewise his assimilation or likeness to your Honour in the high accomplish∣ments of Nature and Grace; he being for his steadie loyalty to his King, his fidelitie to the Church, and stupendious science in all kinde of learning,  (that I may say of him, what S. Chryso∣stome saith of another) a prodigie amongst men, admired by the most, and beloved of all good Christians; weighing all these particulars in the balance of my private thoughts, I from them drew this conclusive perswasion, that if my deceased dear Friend were now living, and to put the ensuing Treatise (the childe of his brain) out to nurse, he would have ventured upon your Lord∣ships patronage; who may style

this learned work your own, and it justly own you for its parent, as being the copy of your soul, and picture of your life: what is de∣lineated, and set down in it by way of doctrine or precept, your Lordship hath drawn out in the lines of your life by practice; for it contains a lively pourtraiture of a good Christian, and loyal Subject.
A Separatist may deceive him∣self by dividing these two, and flatter his deluded soul with a perswasion, that though he bears not in his heart a respectfull love to his Sovereign, he may scale heaven upon the ladder of a bare title, or with the outward badge of an empty name, in that he is called Christian, and challengeth Christ as his with his daring tongue: Let such , or 

self-deceivers, peruse without par∣tiality or prejudice the following Treatise, and they will learn a better lesson; it will inform them of this truth, that loyaltie and Christianitie like that Eros and An∣teros in the Fable, are so twisted and linked together, that as one cannot live or be without the o∣ther, so, he that is false to his King cannot be true to Christ our Saviour, who in his word en∣joyns us to be good Subjects in obeying our Kings just com∣mands, whom God hath set o∣ver us, as he requires of us to act the parts of good Christi∣ans, which is to imitate him in humilitie and charitie, in so∣brietie and meekness, in pietie and Patience, in love and obedi∣ence, in brotherly kindness to all,

even to those that are under us.
That this holy frame of spi∣rit may be wrought in the hearts of all his Majesties Subjects, as it is in your Lordships, it is, and ever shall be the hearty prayer of
