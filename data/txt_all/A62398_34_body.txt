SIr, this Pamphlet to your hands I send,
In hopes that ye will it commend,
For Pens ye know I can use none,
I can hardly read the Catechism,
Yet four and twenty Shepherds,
I saw into my Dream,
Whereof good Thomas Anderson,
In Howfoord he was one,

Seing ye are a Gentleman, and my Friend,
I have dedicate him into your hand:
VVhen Iupiter the son of Saturn
Had put his Father to the flight,
The Empire of the World he did divide then,
Betwixt himself and his Brother Neptune,
Neptune set Pluto for to dwell in Hell,
Amongst the Priests where still they do rebell;
The sacred Records they do demonstrate,
The Idols which the Israelites did prostrate,
So do we find into the present time,
That there are Priests of every kind,
Kings, Prophets, Priests, by all were Shepherds Swains,
And did attend all kind of Sheep,
Both Weathers, Ewes and Lambs,
For Thomas Anderson I wish his Flocks may still abound,
If Iason lost his Golden Fleece, I'm sure he has it found.
