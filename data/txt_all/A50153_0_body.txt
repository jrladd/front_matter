ALthough the Providence of Heaven, whereby the Bounds of People are set, hath carried you so far West∣ward, that some have pleasantly said, The Last Conflict with Antichrist must be in your Colony, yet I believe, you do not reckon your selves Removed beyond the reach of Temptation ad Corruption. 'Tis a Great Work that you have done, for our Lord Jesus Christ, in For∣ming a Colony of Evangelical Churches for Him, where Satan alone had Reigned without Control in all for∣mer Ages: but your Incomparable HOOKER, who was one of the Greatest in the Foundation of that Work, was in his Day, well aware, that Satan would make all the Hast he could, unhappily to get all Buri∣ed in the Degeneracies of Ignorance, Worldliness, and Profanitie. To Advise you of your Dancers, and uphold the Life of Religion among you, I presume Humbly to Lay before you, the Life of that Excellent Man, who for Learning, Wisdom, and Religion, was a Pattern well▪ worthy of perpetual Consideration. Having Served my own Province, with the History of no Less than Four Famous JOHNS, all ftch'd from One Church, I was for certain special Causes unwilling to have i Complained, as once it was of the Diciples, THOMAS was not with them; Wherefore, I was willing to make this Appendix unto that Hstry, Confes∣sing that thro' want of Information I have Ʋnderd e in This, more than in any part of the Composure, yet So Done, tha, I hope the Good Hand of the Lord whom I have design'd therein to Glorify, will make what Is Dne, to be neither unacceptable nor unprofi∣table unto His People.
