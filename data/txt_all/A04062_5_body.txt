Honourable Knights,
WHen Iupiter, (as the Poets faine) had made man, he seeing him such an ex∣cellent creature, brought him to Mo∣mus that carping God, to see what fault he could finde with that propor∣tion, which when he had curiously ex∣amined, he greatly commended both the forme and the feature; but yet there was one thing which he did dis∣like, and that was because he had not made a window a∣gainst his heart, that one might see whether it and his tongue did agree.
Euen so, I (if it were lawfull) might except against the Creator, because I am so inable that I cannot set forth to the world my mind in so plausible a stile, as my heart doth desire, through which defect, mens hearts
 iudging according to the euidence of their senses) I looke to be condemned of arrogancy for making these weake labours to be legible in the world, whereby they may terme me a foole in Print.
But seeing I shall fare no worse then many that haue gone before me, I am nothing danted, but am armed with patience, to bee a partaker with others of scande∣lous clamors; for (as one saith;) The inconsiderate multitude doe much resemble dogges that barke at those they know not; and likewise it is their nature to accompany one another in those clamors: So it is with this sort of people, who wanting that knowledge which reason requireth, and that louing affection, that Christianity desireth, condemne that they know not, and loath that they like not; but though some malig∣nant spirits may deface it, yet many worthy brests, (I hope) will imbrace it.
For the subiect or matter is worthy, and the ground∣worke (vpon which this plantation is framed) is true, though some stems of error may spring out of the earth, for there is no man which hath not his by▪ slips, errors, and wanderings, but yet I haue purged this Vineyard from so many as my weake knowledge could discerne: whereby the young Impes shall not bee choaked, if it but vnderstood by reading, as I conceiued in writing, (because no man can infuse Knowledge with his pen:) for (as Aristotle saith) Vnumquodque recipitur per modum recipientis: Euery thing is receiued according to the natures of them that receiue it; for the Bee gathereth hony, and the Spider poyson from one and the selfe same flower, but the cause of that diuersity is not in the slower, but in their natures: And likewise the Sunne
 reflecting his beames, both vpon the fragrant flowers, and also vpon the dunghill, it causeth the first to bee moe pleasing and odoriferous, and the other to bee more loathsome and contemptuous; the cause of which doth not proceed from the Sun, but from the difference of their naturall vapours; the like cause may be applyed for diuersities of effects in other mens written labours.
Wherefore, seeing mens fancies are as variable as their faces, both in regard that nature hath her greatest delight in variety, as also, that most iudge either parti∣ally, or as the eare or eye giueth euidence; the first be∣ing without equity, the second vncertaine, and the third doubtfull: because that hauing no other euidence then the sensitiue apprehension of the eye, the heart gi∣ueth sentence according to the exterior euidence, and so is deluded, in regard the eye is no substance of light (whereby it might inlighten, and so penetrate into other substances) but a thing which onely hath a procliuity and aptnes to receiue light from another by accidence, and therefore can see no further then the accidence of any substance; yet for all these ambiguities, I haue thirsted with a parching soule which will neuer bee quenched till I haue satisfied many of my good friends, for whose sakes I haue attempted to plant this Vineyard of Horsemanship, in the World, to remoue those that will be remoued from their ancient errors hauing deui∣ded it into three Bookes.
The first Theorically shewing the office and duty of the Man; the second intreating both of breeding and riding young Colts, showing how to manage them (in a true ground) for all the parts of Horsemanshippe: the third, showing how to dyet and traine, both hunt∣ing
 and coursing horses, to bring them to the height of their glory.
The last of which Bookes I determined (if fatall and ineuitable death had not preuented) to haue dedicated to the thrice worthy and honourable Knight, S. Antho∣ny Mildemay, deceased; whose death all Horsemen may continually deplore; for hee was both a father and a foster-nurse to all the Professors thereof, of whose worthy bounties I haue so plentifully (though vndeser∣uedly) tasted, that if I should bury them in the graue of obliuion, I should be such an ingratefull and vnsuppor∣table lumpe that the earth would groane vnder my bur∣then▪ nay, Horses themselues may with Aethon the Horse of Pallantis (as Virgill recordeth) powre forth teares, for loosing such a worthy Maister; for his no∣ble brest did neuer repine at any charges that might ei∣ther increase or maintaine them in their superlatiue glory, whereby he hath left such a race as will giue a counterbuffe to any opposer in England.
Wherefore (Right Worshipfull) seeing the deuine prouidence hath appoynted you an hereditary Succes∣sor of that worthy house, I haue presumed to subiect this booke vnto your milde and kinde acceptance, to∣gether with the Right Worshipfull Knight Sir George Fayen, in both whom is the bright starre of Vertue, Honour, & loue to those excellent Creatures resplen∣ding: Knowing that as you are brethren by nature, so you continually liue in such a reciprocall vnity, going alwayes hand in hand, being combined with the bonds of Amity, Vertue and Nature, in such sort, that if I should seperate such a sweet coniunct, I were not wor∣thy to breath; more especially being tyed thervnto with
 the chayne of your fauourable loue towards me, when you did imploy me.
Since which time hauing examined all my procee∣ding by experience, and purged my preter-errors by reason, I haue sent my liues practise into the World, as a token of my well wishes, which I hope will giue such light to the practisers of this Art, as they shall not need to grope at noone day, (as I my selfe haue long done, being blinded with ancient traditions) which though it be not so plausibly stiled as many would desire, yet I hope the matter will bring profit being truely vnder∣stood; desiring your Worships to pardon my boldnes in my attempt, and that your kinde fauourable accep∣tance would smooth the rough and craggy path of my performance, so shall I be bound to you in all duty,
