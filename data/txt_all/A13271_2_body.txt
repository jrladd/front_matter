My worthiest,
WHat you formerlie vouchsafed to peruse in a rude transcript; J here present you in a character, like your selfe, and vertues, faire, and legible; J thinke it my prime honour, that it must now weare your liuery, and what shall immortall it, your name; Had it nothing else to make it liue in the opi∣nion,
and esteeme of others, this were enough to giue it both countenance, and eternity; Greatnesse can onely patronize our endeauours, Goodnesse glorifies them.

But, sinceritie is the same, still, whe∣ther in exile, or aduancement, in dis∣grace, or honour; wheresoeuer I trauell J carry my selfe with me; I am not torne into distractions, and feares, not parcelled (as others) into doubtes, and hopes; but, where J am, J am in the whole man; and, where J am, so,
I am All yours; All in my morall, ciuill, and diuine obseruances, one that will thanke you, honour you, and pray for you, vnfainedly, willingly, constantly, whilest I am thought wor∣thy of the name, or attribute of
