Honoured Sir,
THat I presume to intitle this Di∣scourse, with its affixed Annota∣tions to your Great Name, proceeds from a real sense, that it is but your just due, who have merited so much of the Learned World, and whose Labours and Pains to advance all useful Knowledge have been so indefatigable; more espe∣cially in rendring the Christian Doctrine in all its Parts such as it ought to be,

that is, Rational and Unexceptionable, bringing the Glories both of Greek and Barbarick, and whatever other piece of Ancient Wisdom was ever esteemed, to adorn and beautifie the new Jerusalem: and partly because you were an intimate Friend of the Reverend Author, whose Great Soul could not take up with little and dwindling Conceipts, but strove to enlarge his own Mind with noble and important Truths, and became a Happy Instrument in promoting the same generous Temper in others. And now, Sir, give me leave, among the other Motives which persuaded me to this Address, to add this as none of the least, that I may testifie to the World to be what I really am,
