THe Prince of Princes, and the King of Kings,
VVhose eye of Providence foresees all things,
To whom, what ever was, or ever shall be,
I present still before his Majesty,
VVho doth dispose of all things as he list,
And graspeth time in his eternal fist;
He sees and knows for us what's Bad or Good,
And all things is by him well understood,
Mens weak conjecture no man can arreid,
VVhat in th'eternal Parliaments decreed;

And what the Trinity concludeth there,
VVe must expect it with obedience here,
Then let not any man presume so far,
To search what the Almighties Councils are;
But let our wills attend upon his will,
And let his will be our Direction still:
Let not Plebeians be inquisitive,
Nor into any profound State-business dive.
VVe into the thousand and sixteenth year,
Since Fergus our first King did appear,
Have many Hopeful Royal Princes had,
VVho, as Heaven pleas'd to bless, were good or bad.
Fergus was the first which we had Crown'd,
For Learning, and for VVisdom high renown'd:
Beyond the Verge of Christendoms swift Fame,
Did make the VVorld admire his Noble Name.
A hundred and Eleven Kings we have had sincesyne,
VVhereof one of them was a Queen;
Their valour and triumphant Victories,
Have sill'd the VVorld, and mounts into the Skyes:
As Kenneth the second, that King of victory,
And Gregorius Magnus, whose Fame can never dye.
Robertus Brucius, that King of high Renown,
King Iames the sixth, that united the three Crowns;
These victorious Princes govern'd well,
But more has been of the contrair strain;
Love sometimes made the gods themselves disguise,
And mussle up their mighty Deities,
And vertuous Princes of the gods have odds,
When Princes goodness doth out-go the gods,
I'm a foolish man, this is no work of mine,
It's an operation of the Power Divine.
Let God alone, for what he hath in hand;

It's saucie, folly and madness to withstand,
What his eternal Wisdom hath decreed,
Who better knows than we do, what we need.
To him let's pray for his most safe Protection,
Him we implore for his most sure Direction,
Let his assistance be the seventh King Iames's Guido,
That in the end God may be glorified:
Let us amendment in our lives express,
And let our Thanks be more, our Sins be less.
Thy Cusing William Scot in Milsington,
He is an Gentleman,
Come of a worthy Family,
For he from Whitslade sprung,
Of his Brother Todrick I have writ,
And given a true Relation,
Of his most worthy Pedegree,
Unto the seventh or ninth Generation;
Therefore it is needles unto me,
To writ them over again;
For if I please, I could revise
Them to the fifteen Generation.
According to my Dream, he is the Shepherds Swain,
I hope Iasons Golden Fleece with him shall still remain.
