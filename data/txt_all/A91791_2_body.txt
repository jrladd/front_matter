BEhold I present to your view
Christ crucified, which is the
sum and substance of the Go∣spel:
The Priesthood of Christ,
and the sufficiency of his Sacrifice to save,
is the main thing I contend for against
the Papists, who say, Christs sacrifice is
not sufficient without their sacrifice;
Charity saves, saith one; without good
workes, no salvation, saith another;
a third saith; that Christs sacrifice is
not sufficient for our Salvation with∣out
beleeving; that beleeving saves;
and that without beleeving we cannot
be saved: Yee see, they all urge a necessity

of something for salvation, besides Christs
Sacrifice, without which something, they
say, we cannot be saved; so that they dey
the sufficiency of Christs sacrifice to save,
and so deny that Christ doth save; for those
that he saves, he saves by his sacrifice:
Also if Christ and something else saves us,
Christ saves us not; for he is no Saviour,
if he be but a part of a Saviour; therefore
in adding something to Christs sacrifice,
they deny the sufficiency of Christs sacrifice;
so that their opinions are dishonourable to
Christ; therefore as we tender the honour
of Jesus Christ, we are to hate and abhorre
them, being enemies to the Crosse of Christ,
and therefore abominable.
If we consider how generally these are
received, and scarce contradicted by any,
that beleeving, and Christ and beleeving
together saves us: sure it should greatly
stirre us up, and provoke us to contend for
the sufficiency of Christs sacrifice, though
our contending should cost us our lives.
There is no truth more honourable to
Christ, nor of greater concrament to his

glory, and our salvation, then this is; take
away any thing of the sufficiency of Christs
sacrifice, and our salvation is destroyed;
what a dishonour were it to God to send
Christ to save us, and yet for him not to
save, and not to be sufficient to save: there
is no opinion in the world, that my soule
doth more abhorre, nor against which I
would more freely lay downe my life for
then this.
This Treatise tends to exalt Christ alone,
selfe is not exalted, nor nothing of man;
this doctrine puts a man upon a whole de∣niall
of himselfe, because man and his best
works are not onely wholy shut out in this
worke, but trampled upon in respect of Ju∣stification
and Salvation: This doctrine
strips us naked from all things else but
Christ, it is not I and my workes, nor
Christ and my workes together that saves
me, but Jesus Christ alone is he that saves
us from our sinnes, &c.
Many want this light: desire and hope
of doing good, moved and incouraged me
to take paines herein, and send it into the

world; I have no prejudice against the per∣sons
of any, nor would I have any thinke
ill of them; in many things we sinne all,
in one kinde or other; its in vaine to ex∣pect
better so long as we are in this world:
neither de I know that I take any pleasure
in writing against any, no further then I
thinke my selfe bound in conscience to wit∣nesse
to the truth, and then especially when
others omit it: Mr Gerees Booke against
Dctor Crispe hath been published above
foure yeares, and no answer given to it by
any; neither have I heard that any other
hath given any answer to the other foure
Treatises, the most of them have been pub∣lished
severall yeares: O yee that love the
truth, is it a small matter to you for Christ
to be dishonoured, and his truth condem∣ned?
Doe yee not regard what violence is
offered to the sufficiency of Christs sacrifice?
if yea, why are yee so silent, as if there were
none to answer: God complaineth; None
pleadeth for truth, Isa. 59. 4. It might
grieve us to consider that others take more
paines for errour, then we doe for truth;

Can we say, we love the Lord, and his
truth, as we should, and not lay it to heart?
In these cold dayes, the love of many, too
many waxeth cold to God and man; many
professe love to Christ, yet few love him,
as will appeare ere long; for the know∣ledge
and practise of the truth shall be
slighted and hated; there shall be found
but a very few that will own it. The more
darke or doubtfull any thing appeares, the
more narrowly search the Scriptures, and
consider them, the benefits will answer the
paines: set aside partiality, prejudice, and
the opinions of men; neither receive nor
refuse without sufficient tryall; pray to
God to reveale his truth to thee: I trust
the Lord that hath directed this to thee,
will blesse it to thee; so as thou shalt praise
and honour him all thy dayes; which is
the desire of
