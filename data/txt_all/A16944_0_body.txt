Right Honourable, and
Right Worshipfull,
THis poore Discourse desired of many of my friends, to be seene in Print, pe∣titioneth for your fauourable accep∣tance: and comming naked, hopeth to bee welcomed for Gods sake. Your godly hatred of superstition, and si∣nister practices in Religion, (as al∣so the loue which you beare to the truth of Christ, and to those who endeuour to the vttermost of the graces which God hath giuen them, to set forth the same in his Church, for the manifestation of his glory) may sufficiently per∣swade you to giue it entertainment.
It is a discouery of the wyles of Hereticks and Schis∣maticks, by which they deceiue the hearts of the simple, and reape to themselues no small aduantage. Therefore though neither sumptuously Apparrelled in the robes of

Learning and Eloquence, to adde grace vnto it; Nor credited by the authority of the Author (which two things are wont to finde many friends, and doe buy the good liking of men) it may recompence you the losse of time in reading it. (But I hope you will not deeme so small a hindrance at any thing, especially where an ad∣uenture is made for a necessary gaine.)
The Author for his part hath to say for himselfe, that his respect of you all augmented by that Reuerend regard which euery one of you hath euer had to Workes of this nature (or rather generally to all the labours of Christ his Haruest men) hath emboldened him to present you with these his first fruits, a little handfull of Goates haire, and yet vsefull for that Tabernacle which the Lord willeth to be made.
And he doth begge that you will be pleased to accept of this, according to the syncerity of his affection, pro∣testing that if herein hee hath done you the least seruice, hee shall blesse God for it, and remaine
