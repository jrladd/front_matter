My Lord,
THE Reason that moved me to inscribe these following Discourses to your Name, is to create a prejudice, and bespeak a good esteem with all Mankind to whom your Lord∣ships Character is arrived, of my Integri∣ty and Snicerity therein. Your Lord∣ships
 free and open Acknowledgment of your self to the World, That you have liv'd your inward Nature, That you never dissembled or disguised your self, avowed plainness, and despised all Arts, Intrigues, and Applications, hath made your Lordship Universally Honoured every where, and by all sorts and parties of men entirely trusted; and you are become an Illustrious instance, That no∣thing is so popular in a Noble Person, as Simplicity and open Sincerity; no, not Bounty and Beneficence it self, to which Office likewise your Lordship is not indebted, or in any arrear. A great Moralist prescribes and commends to all Men that would hold on an uninterrup∣ted Course of Virtue, and preserve their Innocence, to put on  as a Defensative and Out-guard to Virtue; That is to say, a stiffness and inflexible∣ness of Mind, something that can resist those soft and gentle prejudices, that perswade undue compliances, and abuse
 the facile, weak, and tender Minds, to accommodate themselves in little Matters to the present occasions, until by little and little, sincerity is almost quite peri∣shed from the World, and mischiefs apt to destroy it ready to follow in conse∣quence of such unmanly compliance. Men to relieve themselves from inward reproach, whilst they contradict their in∣ward sense, have found out the specious names of Civility, Submission to our Superiours; Nay, have usurpt the glori∣ous name of the Virtue of Modesty, (which is the Noblest and most ample Virtue, which gives Rules that are al∣most comprehensive of our whole Duty; for to this Virtue we owe a greatness of Mind, and a reverence of our selves, as well as equability and Justice to others) to varnish over Dissimulation, Craft, Hypocrisie, Flattery, Treachery, Falshood, and a deceitful Conversation: And are bold to reproach the severe Honest, with the Names of Morose, Disloyal, and
 Disobedient, to turn off from them∣selves the shame of their own prevarica∣tions and utter defections from publick Interest; which God knows men easily slide into insensibly, if they once suffer themselves for any regard whatsoever to be carried off from the Rule of Right; for they bring themselves under some kind of Necessities of complying with the Evils their first aberrations occasi∣oned, by greater faults; which increase reciprocally at every turn, until they be∣come desperate Out-laws, absolve them∣selves from all Duty they owe to their King and Countrey, abandon themselves to Chance, to live and subsist by unto∣ward shifts and arts, which increase their first Guilts, and turn their Errors into unpardonable Crimes: having ship∣wreck'd their Consciences, they care not if the Government be wreck'd too, to which they have made themselves so ve∣ry abnoxious.
This whilst men please others, they
 lose themselves, and from Flattery it is easily proceeded to the most mischie∣vous Treacheries.
He that despiseth his own way, shall dye, saith King Solomon. A man that ac∣commodates himself to serve Occasions, dissembles himself, and appears other than he is; will soon extinguish his Con∣science, and dye to Virtue. He that doth not honour himself, will not regard men; and they that do not Reverence Men, will not fear God: Qui non verentur ho∣mines, fallent Deos.
The Arts of Complaisance so much relyed upon at the Courts of Princes, hath extruded the Laws of Honesty thence, where they are most necessary. This hath made the Condition of great Men very uncertain and fortuitous, in∣finitely subject to Chance and Hazard, the Thrones of Princes unstable and tot∣tering, and left the Peace and Security of Kingdoms scarce at any time undi∣sturbed with Fears & Jealousies, evil sur∣mises,
 and contending Factions, upon Rea∣sons true and false, real and feigned cau∣ses. Every man almost is sometimes com∣plaining of the uneasie condition that he himself concurs to make to himself, but is always in some sort miserable, by fearing from others whom he gives too much cause to fear from himself, and to mi∣strust him for his double dealing. But what other consequence can they expect, that ever feign, and uncessantly dissemble, but not to be believed, not to be trusted, hated for their baseness, and feared for that great Evil they would dissemble. The greatness of the Evil designed, is justly measured by the coarse and base Artifices they use to hide them: they are impudent to all the discerning and wise, whilst they busily set themselves by mean and base Arts to abuse the Fools and in∣considerate, the vain and the credulous; whom they have at the same time in the greatest scorn, whilst they have nothing to value themselves upon, but that such little men are deceived by them.

But there is another sort of men that design well for the Publick, whilst they dispense with the strict Laws of Truth and Sincerity. But I cannot tell upon the whole matter, whether they are not more hurtful to themselves, than profi∣table to the Common-wealth, by their well-design'd and honestly-directed com∣pliances and dissimulations. I mean, such men as lend themselves to the service of the Publick; who are so kind as to disfi∣gure themselves, to take other shapes and appearances of what they are not: Who are content to neglect their Ho∣nour and Reputation of Sincerity, whilst under a feigned assentation they hinder all the evil, and do all the good they can do, and the present state of things will permit; and suffer the rest with a great compassion for the Publick Weal. But such mens Praise must come from God, their Honour will never be entire a∣mongst men; and after all the difficult and hazardous Services they can per∣form
 for their King and Countrey, their Honour will still remain suspected, doubt∣ful and obscure amongst men, who must judge according to appearance. When we have been often abused by the fairest pretenders to a regular and constant Vir∣tue, we cannot easily trust those that have sometime dissembled and represt it.
My Lord,
It is a peculiar Felicity of your Lord∣ship, that from a Generous and Honest Nature, and a Noble Mind, rather than from the institution of Books (though your Learning is famously great) to which you seem made rather than in∣structed; your sincerity is incorruptible, and stands in no need of that Artificial Defensative and Out-work which is prescribed by great Moralists, as neces∣sary to weak Minds to secure their Vir∣tue, especially when Virtue it self is out of Repute and disgraced.
You have persisted constantly in one even Tenor of Life, have been Uniform,
 Regular, and Consistent with your self. There may have been some complyance in appearance to your Lordship, but you never yet departed from your self; nay, you have not so much as incur'd the sus∣picion of so doing. No man makes any Question about your Lordship, or what it is you design; it is no mans Enquiry, no mans doubt: You have been always the same, and are, as every man concludes, immutably so. You are not unhappy to pass under Conjectures and various Opinions, there is no need of a Cry∣ptique man to unriddle any intricacies in the course of your Life.

No false insinuations can hurt your Name: No Service but what is just, will ever be imposed upon you; no My∣steries of Iniquity will be committed to your Breast: no man will be offended at you, but he that hath reason to be dis∣pleased
 with himself, and takes himself in a sort reproved by every honest man, as every man doth that condemns him∣self. You cannot be disgraced by any Faction, but a real dishonour will return upon those that attempt it: Every ho∣nest man will be sensible, if you (be∣ing reckoned and esteemed a publick good) are lessened: And you cannot fail of Honour from the worst of men, when in Honouring you they Honour themselves, and honestate their designs.
My Lord,
You represent to us the Condition of the Nation not desperate and incura∣ble, whilst you preside in His Majesties Councils: for no man can believe you would be an unconcerned Spectator of our Ruine, or the Preparations to it; or that you would contribute any thing thereto, by giving us a vain confidence of a secure condition, and suffer your fam'd Integrity to be Suborned to so mischievous a Deceit.

 My Lord,
Your Lordship hath afforded a migh∣ty recommendation of sincerity and sim∣plicity to the practice if the world; you have Honoured thereby the Age wherein you live, acquired true Ho∣nours to your self, and are thereby be∣come a publick Blessing. I hope I shall have your Lordships Pardon in making a further advantage of your Lorships Noble Integrity and Wisdom, by pre∣suming to offer these Sheets to your Lordships favourable Judgment. That I adventure to appear to so great a Judgment, is the best Argument I can use to the World for my integrity and honest designment therein; and besides, the good Opinion of so great a man as your self, would give great assurance to my own Conscience. If your Lordship doth think any thing therein useful to the World, I am sure it will have your Lordships Countenance, which will make them more useful, since, as my Lord
 Bacon observes, The Cause of Laws, and Defence of the ancient State, hath ever found this Priviledge, That such as for their own Interest disturb the same, Excuse (if they Honour not) their Defenders.
My Lord,
I shall ever pray for increase of Ho∣nour to your Lordship, and that full of years you may change this Life for a bet∣ter; to which I am bound, for that I esteem you a Publick Good, if I had no particular Obligations (as I have) to your Lordship; and for the greatest Reason I take my self Obliged to be in true Honour of your Lordship,
My Lord,
