May it please your Grace,
YOur Grace has by so many and extraordina∣ry favours so entirely made me your own, that I cannot but think what ever is mine is so. This makes me bold to present you with this Comedy, which the Town was extremely kind to, and which I confess I am more fond of than of any thing I have ever wrote, and therefore think my self obliged to dedicate it to your Grace, since what∣ever I can value most among my small Possessions is your due. And though the return be in no measure proportionable to the obligations I have received; yet I hp I shall not be thought ungrateful, since I offer the bst I have to your Grace: who I think I may say are the only Mecenas of our Age, I am sure the only one that  can boast of
You are he who still preserves and maintains the Magnifince and Grandeur of our ancient Nobility; and being one that's truly great in Mind as well as For∣tune, you take delight in the rewarding and encourag∣ing of Art and Wit: And while others detract from Poetry, or at least neglect it, your Grace not only en∣courages it by your great Example, but protects it too. Welbeck is indeed the only place where the best Poets can find a good reception. Your Grace well understand∣ing their noble Science, and admiring it, while some

men envy it, and others are grosly ignorant of it; and indeed none but the latter can slightly esteem it, who commonly are solid Block-heads, that value business and drudgery, which every industrious Fool is capable of before refined Wt and Sence. It is a certain sign of a sordid and fooli Age, when Poetry is depressed, men, by reason of their folly and loosness of Manners, either not caring to imitate the generous Characters re∣presented by it, or fearing the Satyr of it.
Your Grace is above the imitating of generous Cha∣racters, made by Poets, being your self an Original which they can but faintly copy, nor are you less for your Greatnss, Wisdom, and Integrity above their Satyr. So that your Grace is fitly qualified in all particulars for the support of poor neglected Poetry. Your Excllnce in the Art is enough to keep up the Dignity of it, and your Greatness to encourage and protect it. And accordingly your Grace does so mag∣nificently extend your favours to the Poets, that your great Example is enough to attone the neglect of all the Nation, and among all whom your Grace has obliged, there is none shall be more ready upon all occasions to testifie his Gratitude, than,
My Lord,
