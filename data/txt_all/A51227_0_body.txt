My LORD,
THE Meekness, Peace, and Charity, of which our Savi∣our was so Zealous a Prea∣cher, and so great an Example, seem to be in a manner lost in the beats, bitter∣ness, and noise, with which men manage their Disputes about his holy Religion: as if the Character of a true Christian was to be taken rather from the con∣tentiousness of his Spirit, and his skill in Controversy, than the Purity of his Mind and Conversation. When yet no∣thing can bring a greater disparage∣ment upon Christianity, and prove more fatal to the Professors of it, than to make it the occasion of those Evils and Mischiefs among Men, and of that disturbance in the World, which God purposely intended it should allay and extinguish.
It was my design in this Discourse, which in obedience to your Commands, I now make Public, to take men off from their furious debates about  often, not material to  earnestly to press them unto the ex of those Primitive Vertues, upon which our Religion has always laid so much stress, and which our Lord hath so plain∣ly declared to be the indispensable con∣ditions of our Salvation: by shewing that all necessary Christian Doctrines have a natural tendency to that Godliness, which is now too generally neglected. And I am the more bold to perfix your Lord∣ships name to it; because you are known to be so fair a Pattern of that Practi∣cal Religion I recommend, both in your private life as a Christian; and in your Public Capacity as a Magistrate.
