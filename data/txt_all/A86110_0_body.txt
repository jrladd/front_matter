(My Lord)
THe favours I received from you Honoura∣ble Father in my first journey to Ireland, and now sutable to your Lordshipps Fa∣thers Will seconded; hath emboldened me to offer this poore tribute: not to teach your uncontradictable knowledge, but humbly desire it may kisse your hands as a sacrifice offered from your ser∣vant, or as a weakenesse that stands in neede of your protection, therefore I humbly crave it may not bee offensive if for one houre or lesse I begge you from your more serious thoughts, to vouchsafe the reading of these few lines; The profession of a Souldier is neces∣sary, his ends glorious, and his quality honorable; But when I come to thinke of a minde befitting a Souldier, I can only say this; that how curious, costly, plaine, or deformed the Cabinet be, yet must it necessarily bee filled with all manner of vertues: vice must be as that deadly foe with whom he will never make truce, or e∣ver Capitulate, and the bulwarke to withstand his as∣saults must be Faith and a good Conscience, under the guard of these he must finde his security: A Souldier
