IT is not presumption that hath in∣duced me to this address, but sense of duty, and of that obligation that lies upon me. For besides that ho∣mage which I owe, in common with the whole Nation, to his Highness (whom the Lord hath placed over us, and raised up a Healer and Deliverer in the needfull time) a peculiar and redoubled bond of fealty obligeth me, as living in a Rectory that belongeth to his Patronage and Donation. Which tenancy and dependance, as I cannot but own, in all submissiveness, thank∣fulnesse and duty; so in acknowledgement thereof and of my hearty Loyalty to his Highnesse, I have assumed the humble boldness to present this poor Tri∣bute and Oblation to Him, having no better thing to offer. His Clemency and Goodness will not despise the Offering of a willing minde, though it be but mean,

especially one of this nature: I dare not call the Sub∣ject that I have handled, Mean, because it is the summe of the New Testament, but the failings and meannesse of the handling of it, as it is the more excusable, because aiming at so worthy a Subject (and who is sufficient for these things?) so may I hope that it will finde the more easie pardon, and some acce∣ptance, for the Subjects sake.
With this most humble addresse to his Highnesse, I was desirous to leave an humble memoriall also with your Honours who stand so near Him, not only of pro∣fession of that service and observance that with all the Nation I owe to your Lordships, but also of special thankefulnesse and acknowledgement of goodnesse and favour received from your Honourable Table, in a matter of mine own particular concernment. I can adde no more, but my prayers to the Father of mercies, for his gracious Protection of his Highnesse and your H.H. and that he will guide you in all your Councels and in all your waies.
