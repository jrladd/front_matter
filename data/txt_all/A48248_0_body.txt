Worthy Sir,
I Am not so conceited to per∣suade my self, that these Papers are worthy to be presen∣ted to you, in which a less pier∣cing Judgment than yours is, will easily discover many defects: but the Subject of them is so worthy and edifying, and the Charch, for whose Defence they are de∣sign'd, doth so well deserve your respect and affection, that I pro∣mise my self, that on this view they will not fail of being most acceptable and welcome to you. The onely reason that hath per∣suaded
me to expose them to publick censure, notwithstanding those many excellent Treatises that have been publish'd on the same matter, is to undeceive those amongst the English Dissenters, who pretend and confidently as∣sert, that our French Protestants were of the same Judgment with them in matters of Religion: And the Esteem I have of your Worth, and the Concern you have for the Cause I defend, together with the Experience I have had of your singular Bounty and Kind∣ness, engage me to present them to you; not with an intent to acquit my self of my Obligations, which is beyond the reach of my
power; but onely to intimate, how sensible I am of those highly-va∣lued Testifications of your Love and Good-will; wherewith you have been pleas'd to honour me. A most dreadfull Tempest, such as the Church of God, it may be, never felt before; having toss'd me out of my own Countrey, with the miserable Remains of the Shipwrack of our French Chur∣ches, and in this common Cala∣mity finding my self as a person cast out upon a strange Shore, without any support, help or hope; yet I can say, that even in this state I never wanted any thing; for which great and unlookt-for Blessing, I am bound, next to the
Goodness of God, to acknowledge your unparallel'd Kindness and Generosity, who soon after my Ar∣rival in England were pleased to bestow a Living upon me; by which means I was prevented from being a Charge to the Na∣tion, as many of my Countrey∣men were, and put into a condi∣tion of boasting with St. Paul, that I have not been charge∣able to any man. In a thank∣full acknowledgment of which fa∣vour, I humbly present these my weak Essays to you, wishing they may be so well approved of, as to persuade you, that I am most tru∣ly and sincerely,
SIR,
