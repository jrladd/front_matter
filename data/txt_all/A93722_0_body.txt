IT is reported of a great Persian Monarke, that ha∣ving lost his royall Consort, he was so deeply affected with sorrow, as that he refused to admit of any comfort: In this height of passion, a cer∣taine Philosopher vndertooke, if that he would fur∣nish him with things necessarie for his purpose, to raise the dead Queen againe: the Empirour much taken with the offer, was willing for that end, to exhaust all his Treasures: but the other only demanded of him three names of such persons as had ne∣ver felt any greife or sadnesse, to engrave them on the Queens Monument: which after much search throughout his Em∣pire could not be found. I to the restoring of this bleeding & dy∣ing Kingdom, whose wounds every day grow wider and wider, shall not desire the names of any such persons as have been al∣together strangers vnto sorrow and humiliation, they being those that have drawne the heaviest judgments vpon it; but the names of such as have been reall and solemne mourners before God in the behalfe of this Land, which if in any com∣petent number they may be found, I shall not feare but this Kingdome may see a glorious and happy resurrection.
This affection of sorrow is that which this Sermon did first call for, from the Pulpit, and doth still continue (being pub∣lished by your Command) to doe it from the Presse, as being the most sutable posture and dresse to the present conditon of this Land, it cals and invites all, to an holy mourning
 and humiliatiation before the Lord, whose sinnes have bin as oyle to the lampe, and fuell vnto the fire, to feed and nou∣rish that displeasure, that burnes in the bowels of the King∣dome, But more especially your Honours, who are the two eyes of the Kingdome not only to watch over it for it's good, but to mourne over it for it's sinnes and miserie: not only to be Reformers of it, but Weepers for it. And the first stones of Reformation, which are not like the foundation of the Temple, that was laid with the weepings of the old men, and the shout∣ings of the young men, but with the bitter mourning of all sorts will (I doubt not) in the finishing, and perfecting of the worke receive the joyfull acclamations both of young and old, both of Governours and People, the God of Heaven him∣selfe turning our water into wine on the wet seed-time of teares, into an harvest of joy and spirituall blessings: which that he may speedily doe, prayes,
