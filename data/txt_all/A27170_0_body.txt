My Lord,
THough with great zeal and prudence, you use all the power which your Birth and Dignities have given you, for the defence of the true Christian Religion, as it is amongst us professed, and established: yet I hope this short account of what
is most contrary and most destru∣ctive to it, will not displease you. I know your Lordship understands what is here treated of far better than I do, but so doth not the Com∣mon People: they may receive information from these Papers, and will likely do it the more freely, if you shall permit them to go abroad under your Name; For it is gene∣rally acknowledged that we owe much of our preservation to your Care and Christian Courage: and that you did stand in the gap, when our Enemies were pressing to come in upon us.
My Lord, the watchfulness and labours of your Sacred Order, to preserve the face of a Church, and as much Order and Discipline among us, as the iniquity of the times can permit, is a greater ser∣vice to the Protestant Interest
than many are apt to believe: For our Adversaries expect not to pre∣vail, but by breaking of us, and dissolving those bonds of Govern∣ment, which keep us united: well knowing that those sheep are an easie prey, when scattered abroad, which under the guidance of their proper Pastors are safe and im∣pregnable.
I have therefore endeavoured by what I have said of the Superstiti∣ons and cruelties of Rome, to per∣suade such as are averse to them, that their duty and interest oblige them to joyn with our Church: which professing nothing but the pure and Primitive Religion of our blessed Redeemer, makes use of none of those bloudy and vio∣lent Methods, wherewith the Papal Religion and Authority, are pre∣served: and whose dangers and
persecutions on both hands, are for the best Cause in the world, even for her faithful Allegeance to God and the King.
I shall rejoyce, if what I have designed for the common good, be beneficial to any. And if the hum∣ble offer I make of it to your Lord∣ship, be favourably accepted. How∣ever I shall ever pray for the peace and prosperity of our Jerusalem. And that God would long preserve you, to advance his glory, and be an Ornament and Support to this Church: Remaining,
My Lord,
