MADAM,
THE Meanness of the following Dis∣course would have been an effectual Bar to its Publication, had not your Desire usher'd it into the World. The first thing of mine that came forth from the Press was a Sermon, occasioned by the Decease of your beloved Daughter; and I concluded you would not take it well, if I denied you the liberty of reading that Discourse which was preached at your Husband's Fune∣ral, in a fairer Character than mine own Hand-writing. Besides, that Divine Bles∣sing which I hope attended the Publication of the former, gave me the greater Encourage∣ment to expose the latter to publick View. I

am not so vain as to think printing this Ser∣mon will advance my Reputation among Learned and Judicious Readers, it is more likely to produce a contrary Effect; but if God should bless it to the Conversion of one Sinner, or the building up of one Saint, I hope I shall rejoice more than if I gained the greatest Applause thereby. Tho it be not Meat for strong Men, yet I hope it may be Milk for Babes. To conclude, That he who hath promised to be an Husband to the Widow, and a Father to the Fatherless, would put his Everlasting Arms under you, and sanctify all the Dispensations of his Provi∣dence to you; that he would shower down the choicest of his Blessings upon you and the Fruit of your Womb; that your Children may tread in the steps of their deceased Father, and their living Mother, is the sincere Desire of your Friend and Servant,
