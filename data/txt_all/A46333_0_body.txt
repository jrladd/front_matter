SIR,
THough this Tragedy, in spight of a dead Vacation, and some other impediments, found the applause & approbation of the Theater as oft as it appear'd: yet I esteem it a singular fortune to have had yours in particular: and look upon it like the great advan∣tage, which a rich jewel gives to a ring of gold. Such envious spirits, who thought nothing requisite, but au∣dacity, to become Censors in this Art (which per∣chance is the subtilest of human invention) and upon this ground condemn'd the common suffrage: when they see it confirm'd by yours, will lose the choicest fruits of their malice. In the government of Provinces under Nero, 'tis observ'd, that it was alwayes dangerous to do well; and yet not still safe to do ill. These per∣sons would bring the Stage to the same condition: for as they have sought to condemn this Play for the regular conformity to the rules of art, and reason; so they have not desisted sometimes to decry others for their unna∣tural
incongruities, when they have been inform'd where they are. Sir I could wish that you, so far plac'd above the reach of envy, would honor the Theater with some productions of this nature: For there is nothing more difficult; or which requires a more elevated wit, richer fancy, or subtiler judgement: Which rare qualities con∣cur in you in so high a perfection, that there is no free, noble soul which denyes you herein the just tribute of respect and preference. In the happy return, and con∣duct of our great Soveraign, we see restor'd to us the secure felicity of the times of Augustus. To which you might add the splendour, by affording us the noble fruits and inventions of your wit. Messala Corvinus, and Pollio, the Ornaments of that Court, though eminent in War, prefer'd this way to perpetuate the glory of their names: A desire which naturally inflames Heroical brests; and should do yours: the commendation of the present times being a Patrimony of too contracted li∣mits for so great a worth: which cannot receive deserv'd fame and reputation, but from the bounty of succeeding ages: which I much wish, and at present, the continua∣tion of a flourishing prosperity. I am,
SIR,
