May it please your Highnesse,
I Hae endeuored, a my de∣ty was, to free my Father from that spicio of impiti and ignorce, which the late Booke, falsly attributed vnt him, had well-neere brought him into. And I doubt not, but by this meanes I haue obtained so much of all men, as hereafter not to doubt, but that Casaubon hath beene much abused, to haue such a preposterous birth fathered vpon him. Yet to little purpose were all that I could say or doe, if in the meane time this msked Pamphlet should passe through all mens hands vnder your Highnesse Authoritie; such being the impudence of this Impostor, that hee durst venture to inscribe it to your Highnesse

Patronage, the better to deceiue the world. But since without all question your Highnesse is so farre from patronizing such kinde of men, that You detest as well their fraudulent dealings, as the impietie of the Booke it selfe; I presu∣med of Your Gracious acceptance, if I should present vnto You this Defence of my Father against them; that such Impostors may know, how vainely they haue sought for patronage of their forgeries from Your Highnesse Authori∣tie, which they shall perceiue You haue bestow∣ed vpon the Defence of the Trueth. God grant vnto Your Highnesse, as to the most glo∣rious of all Princes, a life of many and many yeeres, with his perpetuall and fauourable as∣sistance of You in all things.
