Great Sir,
SInce it hath pleased Your Highness to express so much Candour and Condes∣cention,
as to encou∣rage this New Under∣taking, by suffering it to be called by Your Royal Name; this smal Tract, which is a De∣scription of it, presumes to throw it self at Your Highness's Feet, hum∣bly imploring Your Favour and Patronage: For tho it hath too ha∣stily broke Shel, and is stil Callow, yet it ven∣tures to take Wing, and fly to Your Princely Bosom for Shelter and
Protection, rejoycing at the Opportunity it hath given its Author of rendring a Grateful Acknowledgment for those Undeserved Fa∣vours Your Highness hath already vouchsa∣fed him. Particularly, I return Your Royal Highness most submis∣sive Thanks for intro∣ducing me into His Majesty's Favour, and recommending me up∣on the account of the Success I had in Cu∣ring
Consumptive Per∣sons by a Particular Method.
That Your Highness would stil go on to Fa∣vour, and continue to retain candid Thoughts of this Great Under∣taking, now almost Compleated; And that this Bold and Ambiti∣ous Attempt, of pre∣fixing Your Name to this smal Treatise, may be wel resented by Your Highness, is the
humble Request and earnest Desire of,
Great Sir,
