THE industrious and pain∣full
Sea-man, Right Wor∣shipfull
(that I may goe no
farther for an example
then mine owne professi∣on,
because quod supranos,
nihil ad nos) being a long time crossed with
vnfauourable windes, persisteth notwith∣standing
in attempting to attaine to his de∣sired
Port: which not beeing able to at∣chieue
directly and vpon a precise rhomb
or point, he maketh his way by diuers Mae∣anders

and crooked turnings, lying some∣times
East, and anon West, so neere his
course as the winde will permit, and by this
meanes at length he ankoreth in the wish∣ed
harbour. Euen so my selfe hauing of a
long time desired to recouer some fit oc∣casion
or meanes (as my most wished port)
to expresse a thankefull minde vnto your
Worships, for no small benefits formerly
conferred vpon me, (& benè apud memores
veteris stat gratia facti) could neuer through
contrarie windes of aduerse fortune arriue
there in safety: but haue had a long trauerse
to and fro, with little likelihood of fairer
weather, till now at length with my bow∣lins
sharpe haled (pardon I pray you my ru∣der
Sea-phrase) I haue doubled the Cape
of good Hope: from whence I am bold to
send you this first returne of what I long
since tooke vp of you vpon interest, it be∣ing
notwithstanding no way of worth to
countervaile any (though the least) part of
the debt I owe you. For it is now some
yeeres agone that I set sayle from the Hauen
of your help, bound for the Port of Pru∣dence,

(the Vniuersity of Cambridge) beeing
fully fraughted with your fauour & friend∣ship:
where, through mine owne negli∣gence,
(let mee euer sigh to remember it)
hauing foreslowed my best market, and
letting go my most precious commodity,
(my Time) at an vnder-value, I remained a
great loser by my voyage; not beeing able
to make vnto you (my Worshipfull credi∣tors)
such satisfaction as you might iustly
expect. And now entring into a conside∣ration
of your gentle forbearance of me, I
doomed my selfe worthy to beare the
brand of Ingratitude, if I should forget
you. Whereupon, not as any part of pay∣ment,
but as a recognizance and acknow∣ledgement
of that debt and dutie, which I
owe to your Wps, I presume to send you
this insuing discourse, being not more plain
in the manner, then true in the matter. If
you shall daigne to giue it fauourable ac∣ceptance,
I haue what I desired, and in the
hope thereof (alwaies praying for your
prosperitie and welfare) I rest
