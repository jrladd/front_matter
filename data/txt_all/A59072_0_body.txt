My Lord,
THe utmost of my Ambition in this Dedication is with an humble request of its accep∣tance, a grateful acknow∣ledgment of your Lordships many undeserved favours, of which I am every day sensible; being confident, that however weak these my en∣deavours are now made publick, they shall
not want both incouragement and protecti∣on from One, whose constant piety it has been to receive a Prophet, and a Prophet's Message, though there might be no other reaeson, yet for this, that it came in the name of a Prophet.
Some of these Discourses have already had the honour of your Lordships Ear, but I must confess more seasonable to the times we live in, then suitable to that Audi∣tory, amongst whom God is praised in the Beauties of his Holiness, and it is a joy as well as Comeliness to behold our Or∣der; the August Solemnities of an Ho∣ly Worship, there celebrated, are of them∣selves a Continued Praedication of the Subject Matter here treated on, should I be silent, and were these lines with their Author buried in Obscurity: However, amidst the the daily violences offered to God and his Service from wicked and un∣reasonable Men, it may seem requisite that there be these more open Attesta∣tions unto Truth, that so a froward and peevish Generation may hence be rendred the more inexcusable, in that they do not perish without warning.
Whatever was the Motive to this Pub∣lication from a private person in my cir∣cumstances, God knows; and your Lord∣ship
may safely honor me with this Defence, that I seek no great things for my self; and I humbly conceive that the Discour∣ses themselves, if candidly perused, will in∣timate as much; all that is here performed or designed is only a Mite or two out of a small stock, a mean and an unworthy, but an hearty addition to what others have very happily cast in out of their abundance into the Treasuries of God towards the building and maintaining of our Church in its wont∣ed Strength and Beauty.
And as I am not, nor need be much sol∣licitous what entertainment these writings meet with abroad, being conscious to my self of my own integrity; so, I hope it is far from flattery, since a real truth, in that I have no other Apology to make, then to crave your Lordships pardon, whilst I must ac∣knowledge these Discourses to be but a ruae and unpolished Comment on your own daily more pious and severer Practises; so that there may be this satisfaction at lest to your Honor in the perusal, if for the Author lit∣tle, for your Self more, at the same time a favourable coustruction for him, but a com∣fortable and more just reflection upon your self, in the consideration of that reward, which is consequential to well ordered conversation. And here, though it be some trespass upon
modesty, yet to provoke the imitation of o∣thers in this licentious Age, I must bear witness to the world of a most excellently well Go∣erned Family, the constant returns of Ho∣ly Offices, the great care which both by your Lordships example and command is ta∣ken that the Meaneft Person in it be in∣structed in those wholesome Principles of our Church Catechisme, (a piece of Disci∣pline upon Youth so sadly neglected!) in the management of all which, if I am an un∣worthy instrument, I must own the success of all my undertakings of this Nature more to your Lordships favour and countenance, then to any thing of skill or ability in my own per∣formances.
And now, having put Your Honor to this unexpected trouble, I most humbly crave leave for one Short Intimation, which will save the tedium of a Preface; and it is this, That Some of the ensuing Discourses are presented to your Lordship, with relation to the occasion of their first composure in the Discharge of my Duty in a small Cure which I once had in the University, where it was my custome as often as I could to give the Lesson provided to my hands out of the Churches service, not at all regarding that coffing imputation of being styled a Postillar, ut rather endeavouring to inculcate upon
the People that they should consider how suitable many times and seasonable, even in contingent circumstances, is the Message de∣livered to them from God in the Voice of his Church; and for this reason I have in∣dustriously published, what was at first so oc∣casionally Penned and Preached, being sorry that by reason of our continued Factions and Divisions, notwithstanding an Act for Uni∣formity, it still is so much every day, a word in season.
No more; but, what is my daily Duty shall be here an hearty and sincere acknowledgment, (to wit) my uncessant Prayers for your Lord∣ships health and happiness, and for the most Religious and Vertuous Lady your Honor∣able Consort; God of his infinite Mercy eve∣ry day more and more Remember You and Yours concerning this for Good; and He for∣get not, but may the blessing be on You and Your Family, the many Kindnesses You have done for the House of Our God, and the Of∣fices thereof. I make bold with submission, cra∣ving your Honorable Protection both of the Author and his Work, to subscribe my self
