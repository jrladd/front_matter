Right Honorable,
ENvy it self cannot deny that the Lord
hath raised and improved You in an E∣minent
manner to overthrow Anti∣christ,
and to accomplish, in part, the
Prophesies and Promises of the Chur∣ches
Deliverance from that Bondage: In all which Ser∣vice,
the Lord hath not only kept Your Honor unsteined,
but also caused the Lustre of those precious Graces of Hu∣mility,
Faith, Love of Truth, and Love to the Saints, &c.
with which, through His Free Grace, He hath enriched
You, to shine forth abundantly beyond all exception of any
that are, or have been Adversaries to Your Proceedings.
Now as the design of Christ in these daies is double, name∣ly,
First, To overthrow Antichrist by the Wars of the
Lamb; and Secondly, To raise up His own Kingdom in
the room of all Earthly Powers which He doth cast down,
and to bring all the World subject to be ruled in all things
by the Word of His mouth. And as the Lord hath rai∣sed
and improved You, to accomplish (so far as the Work
hath proceeded) the first part of His Design, so I trust

that the Lord will yet further improve You, to set upon the
accomplishment of the second part of the design of Christ;
not only by indeavoring to put Government into the hands
of Saints, which the Lord hath made You eminently care∣ful
to do, but also by promoting Scripture Government
and Laws, that so the Word of Christ might rule all. In
which great Services unto the Name of Christ, I doubt
not, but it will be some Comfort to Your heart to see the
Kingdom of Christ rising up in these Western Parts of
the World; and some confirmation it will be, that the
Lords time is come to advance and spread His Blessed
Kingdom, which shall (in his season) fill all the Earth:
and some incouragement to your heart, to prosecute that
part of the Design of Christ, namely, That Christ might
Reign. Such Considerations, together with the Favora∣ble
Respect You have alwaies shewed to poor New-Eng∣land,
hath imboldned me to present unto Your Hand,
these first Confessions of that Grace which the Lord hath
bestowed upon these poor Natives, and to publish them
under the protection of Your Name, begging earnestly
the continuance of Your Prayers for the further procee∣ding
of this gracious Work: And so committing Your
Honor to the Lord, and to the Word of His Grace, and
all Your weighty Affairs to His Heavenly Direction,
I rest
