Right Worshipfull.
BEauty consists more in pro∣portion of parts then in the exquisitnesse of Complexi∣on; for whatsoever this be, if the other be wanting, it begets a deformity. And was it not so in your late meeting about the greatest affair that ever this County or Nation had, the Proclaim∣ing of the Kings Majesty? I must needs acknowledge, and record it for your Ho∣nour, that you did it with all Alacrity, So∣lemnity, and Loyalty; yet an ill choice was made of your Preacher (an intigrall part of that Service) an old man, much decayd in Strength, Lungs, Parts, plunde∣red
of Abilities as well as Books, by the Discouragements and Distractions of our late Confusions, and this was not so hand∣some; I have but a few things to say for him, besides that he was of their own ap∣pointing, that there was a kind of propor∣tion even in this disproportion, I mean as to the work in some sort to which he was to speak; for concerning this Origens observa∣tion is good, Deus vult ex locustis vincere Gigantes, God will by grassehoppers over∣come Giants, as we see at this day, and as for him, Davids words are verified, Ex ore infantium fundasti robur, God can perfect praise out of the Mouth of a weak instru∣ment: Besides when Abraham entertain'd the Angels, Senex currit, Ʋxor festinat, Puer accellerat, nullus piger est in to fami∣lia; The Servant made haste, the VVife be∣stird her self, & the old man ran too as fast as he could, It's the same Fathers observa∣tion.
It was so when we received our graci∣ous Soveraign, as an Angel of God sent from heaven, in that blessed Proclamation, Nullus piger in tota familia, Every man acted his part with the best of his abil ties; the Sheriff proclaimed, the Gentry atten∣ded, the Country waited, the young men displayed their banners, the whole Town triumphed, Men Women and Children acclaimed, and the old man your Preacher did run too as fast as he could; and though he fetcht not with Abraham a fatling from the herd, yet with Mary be brought his young Pigeons, and his Turtle, as much Af∣fectionate Zeal and Loyalty as the best. And now if you ask why I present it to you the second time in this dresse, being so leane, Answerable to the time I had, I shall not make use of that old Gentleman-usher, or Trapanner to the Print-house, Im∣portunity, not to be resisted, though this
also might be pretended, (the more I pitty their Judgments) the true reason is that the loudnesse of my Voice might be sup∣plied by the loudnesse of the Presse; and that those that could be but spectators, for the Noise, Croud, and my Defects, may now be readers of the Sermon if they please; and thereby both retain and renew within themselves the solemnity of that day never to be forgotten. And upon this account, craving your pardons, and pray∣ing for your happinesse, from under our most Wise God, and our most Gracious and Dread Soveraign, whom God pre∣serve, be pleased to accept the services of,
Gentlemen,
