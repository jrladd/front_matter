Madam,
YOur pardon, if it bee
presumption, my
selfe but newly ad∣mitted,
to preferre
others to your service. 'Tis a
sinne I could not be drawne to
commit, but to avoyd a grea∣ter.
So I conceive each Ca∣suist
rankes the breach of
vowes: which would bee my
obliquity, should I offer at any

other Altar these first fruites of
my poore endeavours. The
French Collector (so hee siles
himselfe) presents these Let∣ters
to the world with a
French familiar confidence:
Raing them sufficiently ac∣complisht
to merit entertaine∣ment.
His courage cannot cure
my feare, knowing they must
passe the censure (at least if
you daigne them a view) of
one (then hee conceits his
worke) far more accomplisht:
and not being ignorant, that
this English habit, made by a
stranger to the tongue, more to
the Courtly dresse, may much
blemish their native beauty:
My comfort is without wracke
of reputation, they may want
some of their originall orna∣ments;
but could I hope your
approbation to trifles hardly

worth your eye, I durst bee
bold, this would procure them
more grace, than they have
lost by their Translator. But,
Madam, tis too much, I dare
not begge it; my most ambi∣tious
prayer shall bee, regar∣ding
my unworthy sacrifice,
you would vouchsafe not to
disdaigne i. Reserve your ac∣ceptation
for more deserving
straines; your prayse for those
that more directly tend to ki∣dle
flame of piety: Your not
rjcting those will proove a
sufficient pasport, and helpe
them travel the Brittish world
without affront, or enemy:
where I am confident there
does not breath such a schis∣maticke
to civility, that, in so
triviall a point, will not wave
his opinion, to one that go∣vernes
his hopes. In which be∣leefe

I devote these papers to
the fate you please decree
them. My onely intent in ex∣posing
them was, to give some
testimony of a thankfull heart:
If I have mist the way, it can∣not
bee denied I had a will to
finde it; and mist nothing but
fit meanes to informe the
world that I am,
Madam,
