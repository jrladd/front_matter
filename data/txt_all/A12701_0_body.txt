ALthough (Right Honoura∣ble) when I had first perused this treatise of Iohn de Albines, I foūd it thorow out a most bit∣ter inuectiue & a malitious de∣clamation, written onely of purpose to deface & disgrace amongst the sim∣ple, both our religion, & the ministers, & profes∣sors thereof: yet finding withal as I did, & as anie indifferent man that reads it shal, that neither for matter nor manner of writing, there is any newe thing of any importance in it, which hath not beene, before euer this discourse of his sawe the light, oftē & that far more substantially vrged by some other of that side, & therefore which hath not also heretofore been as oftē fully & effectual¦ly answered by some or other of ours: I not only iudged this to be the reason, when it hauing now been amōgst vs in english these 16. or 17. yeares, none hitherto had vouchsafed it any further
 particular answere, but also (though vrged as your Honour knoweth to frame vnto it a speciall & direct answere) I could yet hardly be brought to thinke it necessary (so basely I esteemed of it) to aford it any other answere, then either a fewe marginal notes that whē I first red it I bestowed v∣pō it, or frō point to point, as it were in a table to haue shewed the reader, where and by whom he might read the same thing long ago, & often ob∣iected on the one side, & answered by the other, which might haue bene in one sheet of paper ve∣ry well dispatched. Howbeit in the end calling to minde what your Lordship tolde me, concerning the opinion that our poore seduced cuntrimen seeme secretly to haue amōgst thēselues of it, as you learned by one of their owne speeches had thereof vnto your selfe in acquainting you first with the booke, and marking how not onely by publishing it in english, but also by entitling it both in the forhead, & ouer euery leafe a notable discourse against heresies, they themselues haue plainely shewed that they haue it in no base ac∣count, & finding it also since to be the iudgement of a certaine learned man of auncient and long experience euen of our owne side, now this last yeare published in print, that the hauing of this very booke so long in secret amongst them vn∣answered,
 hath bene one great cause of the apo∣stasy of so many yong mē as of late yeares in this our cuntry haue reuolted from the truth to po∣pery: at the last I resolued with my selfe, (though I know that whē I had done what I could herein, that I should be foūd to haue said litle or nothing not said & writtē aswel before by some one or o∣ther of our side) that yet your Lordships request made vnto me to answere it, as fully and directly as I coulde, when you first shewed me the booke & how you came by it, was & is such, as that (both of duty to your selfe particularly for sundry cau∣ses, & to the church of Christ generally, for that by this means many may see togither an answere to that, which otherwise in great part either they might chance neuer to hit of in any other wryter of ours, or else be driuen to search more, & those further then it was likely they would or could) I was bound to satisfy in as good sort as any way conueniently I could. Hauing therefore encou∣radgement by these reasons to take it in hand, & hauing now by Gods grace finished it in maner as you see, I present the same vnto your Honour as an vndoubted token of my dutifull affection towards you, beseeching you not onely to take the paynes as your leasure serueth you to peruse it ouer your selfe, but also desyring you
 to bee vnto it such a patrone, as that it com∣ming abroade thus by your prouocation, it may haue your best protection and counte∣naunce, to passe vp and downe openly and bold∣ly, both in the veiw of frendes and foes vnto it. There was prefixed before Jhon de Albines book, vvhich your honour deliuered me, a long pre∣face to the reader, made as it should seeme, by the publisher thereof in english, and there was annexed vnto it in the later ende an offer of a catholicke (as hee is there termed) to a lear∣ned protestant, consisting of two and twenty de∣maunds and six signes of false prophets, hereti∣ques, and schismatiques: the preface I haue aun∣swered, and the answere thereunto I haue placed next vnto my aunswere vnto Albines booke it selfe: somewhat also I haue annexed (that an∣swere of mine to his booke finished) in the latter ende, to shewe the vanitie and childishnesse of those things, which the author hath vttered in the application of those six signes to vs: but to that which hee hath written concerning those two and twenty demaunds I haue said nothing. And indeed, because otherwise the booke was grow∣en farre greater then I imagined at the first it woulde, I haue not at all inserted that offer nor anie part thereof. The reason of my not med∣ling
 at all with those two and twenty demaunds, and not troubling this my booke at all with anie part of that offer, is, that Doctor Fulke long a∣goe hath aunswered those demaundes, and that also nowe of late Master Crowley hath at large aunswered, both them and that which is added concerning those signes. Doctor Fulkes an∣swere thereunto maie bee had vnder the title of an aunswere of a Christian protestant, to the proude Chalenge of a popish Catholicke, and it is prefixed commonly before his booke writ∣ten in confutation of Allens of Purgatorie. In∣deede concerning the six signes hee saieth no∣thing, not because of any greater matter in them then in the rest, but because at the first they were not published with the other: The demaunds though hee haue aunswered short∣ly according to his manner, yet so sharpely and effectuallie hee hath doone it, that, if the Chalenger were a man of his worde, hee con∣tinued not long after a popish Catholicke. Ma∣ster Crowleys aunswere to the whole offer worde for worde, as it was annexed to John de Al∣bines booke, is extant vnder the tytle of a de∣liberate aunswere to a rash offer &c. and it vvas printed by Iohn Charlewoode in Lon∣don 1588. They both haue vvith their aun∣swere
 set downe the words of the offerer. The trauels of these two men haue eased both me & this booke of mine of medling any further then I haue sayed with that Chalenger: and the ra∣ther because since hee had his first aunswere, we neuer yet heard that hee had either skill or will to replie. I might well ynough, consi∣dering the largenesse and sufficiency of Master Crowleys answere thereunto, haue omitted that vvhich I further haue sayed to aunswere his six signes not touched by Doctor Fulke, but that vvhat I haue vvritten thereabout vvas written before I sawe Master Crowleys answere, and that I thought it not amisse to let it stande, that so betvvixt vs three the vvhole thus might bee tvvyse aunswered. Though it were Master Crowley (vvho as I noted before) in the first leafe of his booke making aunswere to this offer, that gaue that iudgement that Iohn de Albines booke had beene the cause of so much apostasy of late here amongst vs, yet he, as he there shows, would not bestowe tyme in aunswering of it, because supposing by the title it was written by a French∣man, & therefore either in french or latine, he thought that either Beza or some other french protestant had done it already sufficiently. This when I redde first, it caused me to be the slacker
 both in finishing and publishing this answere of mine. Yet in the ende forasmuch as this was now amongst vs in English, and therefore in his opinion had hurt so much and so many English persons, and I could neuer learne of any certain∣ty, that in any other language it had beene dire∣ctly answered by any: I thought it needefull and the best way (whether any such answere in any o∣ther tongue had beene made vnto it elsewhere or not) to preuent as much as maie bee anie fur∣ther such danger amongst vs by it, to accompa∣ny such poyson with his fit counterpoyson, that is, such an English popish discourse with an En∣glish christian answere. And the rather because howsoeuer by the title there is shew that the au∣thor was a Frenchman, yet indeede I can hardly be perswaded that he was so. For his publisher in English taking leasure as he hath to trouble his reader with a long tedious and friuolous pre∣face, hath not therein so much as secretly once insinuated vnto vs, in what language the author wrote it, yea he hath not once mētioned any trā∣slation of it, either by himselfe or any other, the consideration whereof together with sundry phrases and matters conteined in the booke, makes me rather thinke that some of our owne fugitiues, English Iesuits, or seminary priests in∣deede
 haue made it, then any such Archdeacon of Tolosa in France, as is pretended. But howso∣euer it be in this respect, it is not much materiall, and therefore I haue not beene herein curious, for these my reasons notwithstanding in all this my answere vnto him, I frame my speech as to the author whose name it beares. And howsoeuer I may doubt of his person and cuntrey, of this I am certaine whosoeuer he were, French or English, the sonne of that bondwoman, Ismael, was neuer cunninger in persecuting the son of the freewo∣man, Isaac, with scoffes & mocks, then the author thereof was by the same meanes, to doe what might be done, to vex and grieue vs. Whosoeuer he was, the right popish vaine & spirit of writing he had. For in so short a peece of worke (I am per¦swaded by that you haue viewed him ouer toge∣ther with this answer of mine) your Lordship will be of opiniō, that neuer any of that factiō wēt be∣yond him, in shameful begging alwaies the things most in questiō, in subtle slipping frō the matters vndertakē to proue, into other more easy for him & not in question, in false quoting & abusing the testimonies which he alleadges, or in barrennes of matter or methode, in such copy of swelling, bragging, and triumphing words. Sure I am for my owne part, though I know these be the com∣mon
 ornaments of popish writers, that I neuer redde any whose book cōsisted so wholy of these as this of his. But to leaue him as hee is, who∣soeuer he was, and to returne vnto your Lord∣ship, once againe I dedicate and offer this my poore labour, vnto your honourable view & pro¦tection, which I doe not because the truth of god, which I haue therein taught and defended, stan∣deth neede of the patronage of man. For god the author thereof can and will defende and protect that, though al the great mē in the world should band themselues against it, but for di∣uers and sundry other reasons iustly me mouing thereunto. One is (which I haue touched alrea∣dy) that of right the dedication hereof appertay∣neth to you, because I had neuer taken it in hand, but by your Lordships motion & perswasion. An other is, that you since my comming to the place where I am, for these eleuen years last past, haue alwaies been, & yet are, a most louing & fatherly patrone to my ministry, mee, and mine: by which right, though that former reason had not beene, your honour may worthily chalenge, not one∣ly in this, but also in all other, such poore fruites of mine, growing from me thus nourished and cherished vnder your Lordshippes patronage, greater interest then this which I offer you nowe
 herein: But if neither of these two reasons had been, yet you being the man you are, that is by the grace & goodnesse of God as far as you are knowen, (which is very farre) amongst the god∣ly and truly religious, a man by birth honoura∣ble, for martiall prowesse more, and for giftes of sounde learning, religion, and vertue most of of all to be honoured and esteemed, euen that would haue drawen me, though otherwise I had been a meare stranger vnto you, by this means to haue sought to haue testified my duetifull and hartie good affection towardes you. For pietie ioyned with Christian nobilitie hath been the aunciēt cause, why the godly learned in aun∣cient times haue dedicated their works to such, as they haue iudged truly qualified therewith, doubtlesse therby both the better to encourage them, to whom they dedicated their labours to proceede and goe on in the good course they had begun, and thereby to prouoke others to imiate their good exāple, that the like honoura∣ble opinion may by such also bee conceaued of them, & likewise when occasion should serue to their comfort testified publickely of them in the church of God. What else mooued Ambrose to dedicate his bookes of fayth and the spi∣rite to Gratian the Emperour? What else
 caused Lactantius to dedicate his diuine institu∣ons to Constantine, or what else enduced the holy uangelist S. Luke, to dedicate his historie of the ctes of the Apostles to noble Theophilus? It was oubtlesse great honour vnto these men in their imes in the churches of Christ, that thus Am∣rose, Lactantius, and Luke testified their good li∣king of them. Wherefore though I be no body in cōparison of those, & therefore hereby vnable to onour you as those did them, yet being but as I m, giue me leaue (my good Lord) as farre as the credite of my poore testimony will stretch, to testifie that way my good will according to their example towards you. And thus presuming of your fauourable acceptation of this my offer, I cease from any further troubling you at this time, beseeching (as alwaies I pray and will for you) the Lord of heauen and earth in these busie, dangerous, and sinnefull daies, so inwardly to encourage and strengthē your noble heart, and the heart also of your right vertuous Ladie and duetifull wife, as that you both, and all yours, may be so adorned, decked, and beautified with all necessarie and comfortable giftes and gra∣ces of knowledge, faith, zeale, and sinceritie in Gods holie religion, and with all true vertues both of bodie and minde readie alwaies to bee
 shewed in your life and conuersation, that you may all goe on and finish your daies most con∣stantly and comfortably, in all true Honour and happines from generation to generatiō, to gods glory, the churches needfull example, & to your owne eternall saluation. Amen.
