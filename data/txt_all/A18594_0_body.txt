MY Epistle to you, is like the litle Towne that the Cynicke would haue perswa∣ded the Citizens was readie to runne out at the great gates, being scarce so long as the Title. In a word, the negli∣gence of many better able, hath made me bold to write a small Epitomie, touching the abūdant vertues of Elizabeth our late sacred Mistris. In∣treating of her Princely birth, chast life, royall gouernment, and happie death; being a Lady borne, liuing, raigning, dying, all for Englands good. The manner is handled between Shep∣heards,

the forme of speech like the persons, rude: Affection exceedeth Eloquence, and I haue not shewne much Art; but exprest the du∣tie of a louing hart: Shead some teares in rea∣ding our Shepheards sorrow; and in that true passion, let your loue to our royall Lord be shewne: who hateth hypocrites, as iust men hell. Farewell all of you, that giue the dead Queene a sad Farewell, and the liuing King, a glad Wel∣come; the rest are Time-pleasers, and I write not to them.
Foelicem fuisse infaustum.
