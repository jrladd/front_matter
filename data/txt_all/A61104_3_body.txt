Right Worshipful,
I Beseech you take it not amisse, since you have deserved more at my hands, that I prefix you before this Christian Dialogue. It is my due thankfulnesse that urgeth me to it, not that I think so worthily of this small tract, to present it to the view of so many judicious eies, but to shew how much you have endeared me, and I stand indebted to you, not only for a Lecture which I enjoy by your favour, but for your candor and ingenuity, in wishing me more and better places then I am worthy of; for which I must eâˆ£ver hold my selfe,
