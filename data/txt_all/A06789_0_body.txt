TRaffique, (Most Dread and gra∣cious Soueraigne) by Nature Admirable; and by Art Amiable; being the Sole peacible Instrument, to inrich Kingdomes and Common∣weales: may properly be called, The

Praeheminent studie of Princes; the ra∣ther, because the Sacred wisdome hath approued this Axiom: That a King is miserable (how rich soeuer he be:) if he Raignes ouer a poore people; and that, that Kingdome is not able to sub∣sist (how Rich and Potent soeuer the people be:) if the King bee not able to maintaine his Estate. Both which, (being Relatiues) are depending vpon Traffique and Trade, which is perfor∣med vnder Three Simples or Essenti∣all parts, namely, Commodities, Mo∣neys, and Exchange for Moneys by Bills. Whereupon hauing lately perused a Treatise intituled Free Trade, or, The meanes to make Trade flourish; where∣in the Author, either ignorantly or wilfully, hath omitted to handle The Praedominant Part of Trade, namely, the Mystery of Exchange: which is the Publike measure betweene vs and other Nations, according to which, all our Commodities are bought and sold in forraine parts: his only Scope being, to haue the Moneys of the

Kingdome inhaunced in price, and the forraine Coynes made Currant with∣in the Realme at high Rates, (where∣by great inconueniences will follow:) I could not but bee moued, both by my faithfull alleageance due vnto your Maiestie, and the obseruant duty ow∣ing by mee, to the Publike good:) To make an answere to the materiall points of the saide Treatise, by compa∣ring things by contraries for the better illustration; the rather for that it was published in Articulo temporis, when your Maiesties vigilant Princely Care, had beene pleased to referre the Con∣sideration of this important businesse of State, to the learned, Lord Vizcount Maundeuile, Lord President of your Maiesties most Honourable Priuy Councell, and other persons of know∣ledge and experience: amongst whom (although vnworthy) my selfe was cal∣led, and our opinions were certified vnto your Highnesse.
For the Consideration of this weigh∣ty matter of great Consequence, is

absolutely to be submitted vnto your High Wisedome and Transcendent iudgement, by meanes whereof (ac∣cording to the saying of Epictetus the Philosopher, Hoc est Maximè iu∣dicis, Aptare Vniuersalia singularibus,) All Causes both Ecclesiasticall and Ci∣uill, are obserued, discerned and ap∣plyed to their proper and determinate ends.
Your Maiestie therefore, may bee pleased to vouchsafe (with a gracious aspect) the reading of this small Trea∣tise, which (like vnto the little fish, mentioned by Plutarch, swimming be∣fore the great Whale, giuing notice of dangerous shallow places;) shall be amply explained in a Volume (almost imprinted:) intituled Lex Mercatoria, or the Auncient Lawe Merchant, which (in all humility:) is to bee pre∣sented vnto your most Sacred Maiesty; wherein the dangerous Rockes, (to be auoyded in the Course of Traffique, and the meanes therunto conducing:) are manifested for the preseruation and

augmentation of the wealth of your Highnesse Realmes and Dominions, to bee effected by the Rule of iustice grounded vpon Aequality and Aequity according to Ius gentium, which is chiefly maintained by the Lawe Mer∣chant. The knowledge whereof, is of such moment, that all other Temporall Lawes (without it) are not compleate, but imperfect.
Worthy of commendation, are those offices, who can by Prouidēce preserue the Treasure of Kings and Common-weales; worthier are those that both (by honest and lawfull meanes) can preserue and augment them: but wor∣thiest of all immortall praise, are these, who can and doe (by easie, iust, and Politike meanes) inrich Kingdomes and Common-weales, and thereby fill the Princes Coffers with standing Treasure, to serue all occasions in the two seasons, which Princes are to care for; (obserued by the Emperour Iustinian,) namely the Time of Warre, when Armes are necessary, and the

time of Peace, more fitting whole∣some Lawes. In the Theoricke Part of which Study, I haue these forty yeares spent much time and charges at the pleasure of great personages: and albeit nothing did encounter mee but ingra∣titude, yet my constancy to spend the Remainder of my dayes therein, (in hope of Practise,) is as immoueable as the continuance of my daily pray∣ers, to the Great Iehouah, to mul∣tiply your Maiesties dayes as the dayes of heauen. London the 25. of October, 1622.
