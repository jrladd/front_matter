Most Gracious Sovereign,
I Have been long ashamed to see the Ae∣gyptian locusts, the emissaries of Apol∣lyon, and the sons of perdition, under the name of Christ, so much to abuse His sacred truth, as to send forth so impudently, and most ignorantly, such lying Pamphlets; so stuffed with Trea∣son, to animate Rebellion, and to poyson the dutiful affe∣ctions, and the obliged loyalty of Your Majesties seduced Subjects; and seeing we ought not to be sleeping, when the Traytors are betraying our Master, I have been not a little grieved to see so many able men, the faithful servants of Christ, and most loyal to Your Majesty, either over-awed with fear, or distempered with their calamities, or, I know not for what else, to be so long silent from publishing the ne∣cessity of obedience, and the abomination of Rebellion, in this time of need; when the tongue and pen of the Divine, should aswell strengthen the weak hands of faithful subjects, as the Sword and Musket of the Souldier, should weaken the strength of faithlesse Rebels: Therefore, not presuming of mine ability to equalize my brethren, but as conscious of my
 fidelity both to God and to Your Majesty, as in my younger years INon sine meo magno malo. fearlesly published The resolution of Pilate, so in my latter age, though as much perplexed and persecuted as any man, driven out of all my fortunes in Ireland, hunted out of my house and poor family in England; and (after I had been causelesly imprisoned, and most barbarously hand∣led) then threatned beyond measure; yet I resolvedly set forth this Tract of The Grand Rebellion: and though it be plain, without curiosity, —Qualem decet exulis esse: Yet I do it in all truth and sincerity, without any sinister aspect: for, my witnesse is in Heaven, I had rather have all the estate I have, plundred and pillaged; my wife and chil∣dren left desolate, and destitute of all relief; and my self de∣prived of liberty and life by the Rebels, for speaking truth; in defence of whom my conscience knoweth to be in the right; than to have all the praise and preferment that either Peo∣ple, Parliament, or Pope, can heap upon me, for sewing pil∣lowes under their elbows; and with idle distinctions, false interpretations, and wicked applications of holy Writ, hy∣pocritically to flatter, and most seditiously to instigate the discontented and seduced spirits, and others of most despe∣rate fortunes, to rebell against the Lord's annointed. I pre∣sume to present the same into Your sacred hands. God Al∣mighty, which delivereth your Majesty from the contradi∣ction of sinners, and subdueth your people that are under You, bless, protect, and prosper You in all Your wayes, Your Royal Queen, and all Your Royal Progeny. Thus prayeth
