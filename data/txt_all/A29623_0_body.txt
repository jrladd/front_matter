THe many great ob∣ligations which your nobleness hath from time to time laid upon me, doe merit a more serious ac∣knowledgement then

this rude and toyish ad∣dresse can pretend to; whose design is onely to beg pardon and prote∣ction, for that I being se∣duced to print these youth∣ful vanities, have thus audaciously shelter'd them under your celebra∣ted Name. I should not have done it, but that I well know the greatnesse of your soul, and the

Kindnesse you have for me, are a sufficient screen to keep off any of∣fence that I can commit against you: and I have considered also, that there are four great things committed to your custo∣dy; the Soldiers, the Lyons, the Guns, and (which is more power∣ful) the Money. So that if any should have an itch

to snarle at me, they will not dare to open their mouths, least they should be thought to bark at you; In whose Regi∣ment I desire to list this Volunteer, being encou∣raged by this considera∣tion; that, together with those great and serious Emblems and instru∣ments of power, with which you are entrusted,

the Apes and Cata∣mountains, and other properties of diversion, doe there find safety and subsistence; That those priviledges may extend to this Brat of mine, which is no lesse ridicu∣lous, is the ambition of,
SIR,
