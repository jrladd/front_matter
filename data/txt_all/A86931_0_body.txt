Right Worshipfull,
I Am bold to Dedicate the first fruits of my Labours in this kinde unto your view and patronage, unto whom I know the intention is not unwelcome, as ayming at the conjun∣ction of the State and Ministers of the Word in peace and unity, that hitherto have beene kept at distance by these dividing principles, arising from a twofold distinct government, which being agreed on to be but one (and I hope to make appeare they ought not to bee divers) would for ever silence those implacable differences that have long time beene betweene them, and remaine a hard matter to reconcile at this time. Sir, I have ever observed your aime to be at peace, and justice to keepe of violence and oppression from all men, so farre as your trust and imployment (which hath beene great, in and for your Country) would inable you; I aime at the same ends, both to make the Parliament and Ministers all agree, and all ayme at Gods glory, and the Countries safety, wherein I know no man would more rejoyce then your selfe. I confesse the first sound of this my opinion out of the mouth of Master Coleman, was very un∣welcome to our brethren, and I look for no better entertaynment. I have some incouragement, that a man so eminent is gone before me, and doe hope that upon some pause they may receive better satisfactions, and that at they were forwards but Bishops might bee plucked up root and branch, so they will at last be  to plucke up this root of their
spirituall censure, upon which the state and ambition of the Bishops was first planted, I shall not desire to engage you in defence of the cause; but if any good come by it to the Kingdome, that you should enjoy the benefit: unto whose happinesse here, and eternall, my duty doth en∣gage mee to bostow my selfe, and all the abilities God hath given mee.
