SIR,
VEry much to be commended in my opinion is that Cu∣stom amongst the Courtiers and best educated Persons

of China, whereby instad of oral Complements they use to deliver unto their Friends written Protesta∣tions of a sincere and cor∣diall Amity, to remain as a Testimony against them, if they shall afterwards fall short in performing (as ocasion requires) the Dvoirs of a veritable Friendship. The Esteem I have for this Practice, so usuall amongst them, has excited me in these few Lines to assure you of the entire Respect and Veneration, I have for the Amity, wherewith you

have been pleaed to honor me, and at the same ime to present ou wit this lit∣tle History of te Chinse Court, which having rn∣slated into our Language, and finding the Subject such, that I need not be a∣shamed of having bestowed my time therein, I have thought fit to cmmuni∣cate to the Publick under the auspicious Protection of your ever-honored Name. Nor was it possible for me to choose a more suit∣able Patron for this Narra∣ive of the Grandeurs of a Court, where Learning and

Vertue are had in singular Recommendation, than your noble elf, whose pro∣found Science, Heroick vertues, and generous Na∣ture would easily induce me (did not the Principles of Christianity forbid me to believe a Pythagorean Metempsychosis) to think you animated with the Souls of all the greatest Heroes and most eminent Scholars, whose Fame is at this day celebrated in the Universe: For if the Heroick Ge∣nerosity of your Spirit re∣presents to me a Caesar and an Alexander, your extra∣ordinary

Eloquence does at the same time tempt me to think you a Demo∣sthenes and a Ccero▪ I migh her (accordng to the u∣suall Custom of Dedica∣tions) make a large Enume∣ration of these many great and vertuous Qualitis, that gain you a most par∣ticulr Esteem in the Hearts of all those, that have the honor to e ac∣quainted with you; but knowing, how offensive this would be to that Mo∣desty, which you have made your inseparbl ompanion▪ and being con∣scious

lso of min own Inability to give to such high Endowments the En∣comium, they deserve, I here put a stop to my Pen, which is ambitious to ho∣nor it self with celebra∣ting your Praises. Re∣ceive then, Sir, this little Present, which I take the boldness to offr to you, as a pledge of the unfeign∣ed Zeal, I have for your Service, and believe me, that I shall nver think my self any longer wor∣thy to live, than I shal be ready to embrace all Occasions of verifying,

what I here protst, that I am,
SIR,
