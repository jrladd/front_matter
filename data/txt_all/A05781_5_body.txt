VErtuous young Lady deigne Endymion,
Though he be chained in obscuritie,
Humbly to send thee salutation:
Presenting thee with Shepheards melodie,
As wanting ritcher meanes to glorifie
Thy noble Knight, and thee, whose high estate,
Ourania crowneth with faelicitie:
Prysing thy youngest yeares at highest rate.
Noble Sydneian babe Intemerate,
Endymion's feeble infant is his wit,
Such stile and phrase, of worth to fabricate,
As might giue life, and luster vnto it.
But my defects Ourania shall supplie,
In teaching thee and thine Philosophie.
