AFter I had discharged the charge laid vp∣on me by your Ho∣nourable and Wor∣shipfull Court; and was presently after, sollicited by some of your Honourable Societie, to present to the eye, what I had deliuered to the eare.

Though at first, I was indeed very vnwil∣ling, at their intreatie: yet, being com∣manded by your Honourable Court to publish what before you had intreated mee to Preach; and weighing well with my selfe, that words spoken, are soone come, soone gone; but that written withall, they make a deeper impreion: for, by striking as well the Eye of the Reader, as the Eare of the Hearer, they peirce his heart the better, and saue his soule the sooner. Hereupon, that I might testifie how much I honour your lawful Commandements; and withall, that I might confirme with my Pen that grace, which it pleased God to worke by my Voyce; I haue now yeelded to all of your Requests, making that common to all, which then was imparted but to some: onely in desire some way to witnesse my dutifull respect o your Honourable Court, and loue to your Noble Plantati∣on. For, seeing many of your Noble and worthy Company haue spent a great part of their painefully gained estates vp∣on this honourable Action; and reioyce

in nothing more then in this, that God hath giuen them a price in their hand, and a heart to vse it for the furthering of this glorious Worke; How could I, at so ear∣nest intreatie, refuse to adventure this Mite of mine, among so many worthie Adventures of theirs? How could I (I say) refuse to make their publique Bountie, and your publique Thankesgiuing, yet more publique?
If your Honours will be pleased to take in good part what now I impart; it may proue a spurre vnto me, to vndertake some beter piece of seruice for the good of your noble Plantation; at least, if it lie in my poore power to bring it to passe. Thus intreating your Honours fauoura∣ble acceptance, I rest
London this 22 of May. 1622.
