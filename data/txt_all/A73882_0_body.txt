Right Worshipfull,
IT is not any affectation of publicke notice, or vaine-glory, that hath cast me on the
censure of these over-cry∣ticall times, in the publi∣cation of these meane indeavours: No, my record is on high, how conscious I am of my owne weakenesse and defects. But, that I may render some reason of this my action: First (I confesse) the good-will, which (according to my bounden duty) I have to Sion, the Church, wherof I am an unwor∣thy member, moved me hereunto: that if it shall please the all-disposing
LORD of Heaven and Earth, to gather me short∣ly to my fathers (as my crazy body continually mindes mee of my no long continuance here) I may leave behinde me some testimony of mine affection and studie of do∣ing what good I may to my fellow-members.

Bee pleased therefore
