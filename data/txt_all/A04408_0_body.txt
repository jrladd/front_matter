THIS ensuing Re∣lation being sent out of the VVest Indies where it was first printed to a friend of mine in Spaine, & from thence by him to me, after I had read & perused the same, it see∣med
vnto me, & others also whose iudgmentes I fatre preferre be∣fore mine owne, to be worthy the publike view. Whereupon I resolued (though my necessary occasions would scarce affoard me leasure) to steale so much time from them as was necessary for the translating it out of Spa∣nish into our English tongue. More paynes and labour it cost me then at the first I thought it would haue done: and I found therein that true by experience which I had often heard of o∣thers, to wit, that it is not so easy to translate out of one language into another, as is commonly imagined.
Hauing at length finished
the same, I knew not to whome I might better direct it, then to You the poore afflicted Catho∣likes of this our Countrey, for whose comfort and encourage∣ment I did indeed principally from the beginning intend it. For although I do presume it wilbe gratefull to all Christians of what nation or nature soeuer they be, to vnderstand of the propagation, increase, and aug∣mentation of Christian Reli∣gion in those Countries where before there was neuer any no∣tice therof, and of the constant perseuerance of those therein that haue so lately receiued and imbraced it: yet am I certainly perswaded, that it wilbe to you
much more welcome, then to any other; not only because these most worthy Christiās of Iaponia wherof this relatiō doth entreate be of the same Christian and Catholike Fayth and Religon that you be, and not of any o∣ther priuate or particular sect or faction, of which God knoweth there is to great a multitude in the Christian world in these mi∣serable dayes of ours: but also by reason of the great likenesse and similitude betwixt their case and yours.
If it be an axiome in Philo∣sophy, that Omne simile gaudet sibi smili, Euery thinge doth take a particuler delight in such thinges as be like vnto it selfe;
well may it be supposed that it wilbe at least some kind of con∣tentment vnto you (amongst so many occasions of discomfort as are dayly offered) to vnderstand of the estate of those that in ma∣ny thinges do more symbolize with you, then any other persons in the world. For (omitting that they be Inhabitants of an Iland as we be, and of the grea∣test Iland in those partes of the world as we in these, of the like Climate also that we be, all thinges considered, they in a manner Antipodes to vs, and we to them) first of all they be but lately conuerted to the true fayth of Christ from Infide∣lity, and so be most of you from
Schisme or Heresy, which is a kind of infidelity: to them it is graūted according to the saying S. Paul, to suffer for theyr faith; and so it is to you: they be falsly slaundered and calumniated in many thinges by the Diuels mi∣nisters, and so be you: they be persecuted for theyr Religion, many of them to death & more to losse of goods by the enemies of Christ and his holy Church; and so be you, very many a∣mongst you hauing lost theyr liues, and more theyr goods & liuinges for no other cause but only the constant confession of the Catholike Religion. Finally they for theyr valour and con∣stancy in Gods cause be famous
in all those partes of the world, yea, and in Europe also; and you for yours be no lesse glori∣ous, both in all Europe, and in the rest of the Christian world: so that I may well say both of you and them, that which the Apostle sayd to the Romanes (whose religion both they and you imbrace) fides vestra annun∣tiatur in vniuerso mundo, your con∣stancy in fayth is published and famous throughout the whole world.
These then be the reasons for which I thought it most expedient to dedicate this short Relation vnto You; although there wanteth not also another, which truly I must needes con∣fesse
was of great force to moue me thereunto: the which is that I hoped thereby you would both be more carefull to com∣mend in your prayers to Al∣mighty God the necessities of those poore afflicted Christians, your Brethren, as also more willing to imitate theyr admi∣rable examples of valour and courage in the cause of Christ, and of patience and constancy in enduring crosses and persecuti∣ons, troubles and tribulations for the same. Many of you I know haue oftentimes occasions ministred of suffering wronges and iniuries, losses and disgraces for the same cause, the same Fayth and Religion for which
they do endure all these cruell persecutions. If then you do imitate theyr patience, theyr courage and constancy, theyr ioyfulnes and alacrity therein, you shall obteyne thereby the like honour & renowne in earth that they haue done, and after∣wardes in their company euer∣lasting crownes of glory in hea∣uen: for as the holy Apostle te∣stifyeth, Si socij passionum estis, eritis & consolationis; if you be parta∣kers of theyr sufferinges, yee shall also be companions of theyr comfortes, ioyes, and con∣solations.
And because there be some things in the discourse of this re∣lation which proceding from an
extraordinary feruour, are rather to be admired of all, then imita∣ted of any that is not after an especiall manner moued by Al∣mighty God, as we may prudēt∣ly iudge those persons were that did them; I doubt not but that you guided by discretion (reue∣rencing such like actions as is∣suing from the particuler mo∣tion and inspiration of the holy Ghost) will apply your endea∣uours, only or principally, to imitate those other thinges that are more conformable to the common course of vertuous and pious persons 'assisted with the grace of Christ; knowing that thereby you shall both auoyd the domage that is incident to
those that rashly thrust them∣selues into eminent dangers; & also gaine withall no small merit to you soules
It shall not be needfull for me to aduertise you how this persecution of the poore Chri∣stians of Iapone was partly, if not principally, occasioned by per∣sons of the same profession in religion, as those be that perse∣cute you: nor yet to note how like the Diuell is vnto himselfe in all places, causing the Gentiles there to hate and exterminate the pictures and images of our Blessed Sauiour and his Saintes, togeather with all other thinges appertayning to the promotion of Christian piety, as he hath
moued your Persecutors here vtterly to abandon and abolish them: It shall not I say be need∣full for me, to signify these thinges vnto you, for that I do assure myselfe that your selues in the reading thereof will easily obserue these and many other thinges greatly worth the mar∣king; as the great feare and care of the gentiles least any reliques of the holy Martyrs should re∣maine to be reuerenced by the deuouter sort of Christians? theyr extraordinary diligence to make those that were constant in theyr fayth, to dissemble at least a little while in the exterior profession thereof: theyr false and slaunderous calumniations
of the Catholike religion: theyr feares, suspitions, and iealosies of preists and religious persons concerning matters of State, all of them thinges common to them, and to the Gentils of for∣mer times that persecuted Gods Church, as also to the Heritikes of all ages, and in especiall to these of ours.
That which I would wish you to reflect vpon, is only the bad successe euen in temporall affayres which in the end befell to such persons that for worldly respectes, eyther forsooke theyr religion, or without care of theyr conscience behaued themselues to the discredit therof: and how on the contrary those that were
constant therein, and carefull to frame theyr liues according thereunto, besides theyr hap∣pines in heauen, & honour vpon earth, through the Paternall prouidence of Almighty God, were euer in the end after some suffering sufficiently prouided for.
And now because I do i∣magin that many of you hither∣to haue not had much notice of the Kingdome of Iapone, and lesse of the affayres therof, it be∣ing a country so farre distant & remote from ours, as perhaps few or none in the world more (at least, as it is accessible) and by reason thereof you will not so easily vnderstand some thinges
that will occurre in the reading of this relation: I haue there∣fore thought it not amisse preifly by way of a Preface or In∣troduction to set downe some few things concerning the same that may help to giue you some litle light therein. If therewith or by the reading the relation it selfe you shall receiue but so much contentment as I tooke paynes in the translating there∣of, yea or but any confort or o∣ther good at all, I shall thinke any labours very well bestowed, desiring no other thinge in re∣quitall thereof but only to be remembred in your best deuoti∣ons, and made partaker of those afflictions that it shall please
our Blessed Sauiour to giue you grace to suffer for his sake: and so humbly beseeching Al∣mighty God to send you eyther a speedy end of them, or else much patience to endure them as long as it shall be his holy wil and pleasure to permit them, with all dutifull respect I take my leaue, euer remayning
