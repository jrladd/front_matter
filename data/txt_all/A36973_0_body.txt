My Lord,
WHen the Great Atticus retir'd from Rome, to em∣ploy his happy Hours amongst Rural Pleasures, tho his Contentment by that resolution, might be judg'd most Dear to him, at a distance from the Town's Hurry and Noise, to indulge with the charm∣ing Quiet, and sweet Diversions of the Country, yet nevertheless, the Merit and Vertue of such a Patron being too highly Celebrated, to let any envious Space be a Bar to their Addresses; Horace, Ovid, and the rest, never fail'd in their Poetical Correspondence, nor in often Dedicating to so great a Judge, their choicest of Labours.
'Tis from this Scien, my Lord, that my present Am∣bition Sprouts and Grows; and tho the Work I pre∣sent, is not so worthy as it ought to be (aspiring to this Honour;) and likewise tho my Acquaintance and Knowledge of your Lordship, is scarce old enough to warrant this Presumption, yet you have so large an Interest in Fame, that I am well assur'd, your unque∣stion'd Reputation will Dignify the one, and your of∣fer'd

Courtesie, and generous Affability, Excuse and Pardon the other.
The most material part of other Dedications, I am sensible, are generally stuff'd with the Patron's Praises, and tho my Lord, your generous Hospitality, your ad∣mirable Temper of Mind, and many other flourishing Vertues, which the World owns you to be Master of, may justly exact from a Poet his best Skill in an Enco∣mium, yet fear to Offend, or lessen the value of a Modest Courtesie, which in its own Nature, is above all that I can Write to Extol it, makes me desist from a Theme fit to Inspire the best of Pens, and Improve the richest of Fansies.
'Tis doubtless the depraved Quality of the present Times, which makes that often appear Flattery, which considering the real Merit of the Person, may proper∣ly be but Iustice. The greatest Wits of former Ages, I am sure, were of this Opinion, that never spar'd with their highest Elegance, to Illustrate the Chara∣cter of their Patrons, who in return, with their choicest Favours, express'd their Gratitude, without Blushing, or believing that to be a Compliment, which was Na∣turally a due belonging to their Merit.
When Sacred Virgil by Augustus sate
To read the Work he was to Dedicate,
The Praises ev'n Extravagant did seem,
Yet Caesar did not think he Flatter'd him.
But this in our Adulterated Age, is now looked on as an Offence, and consequently the Meritorious miss of their Plaudit. Be pleas'd therefore, My Lord, to believe, I Think what I dare not Write; and if your Lordship will be pleas'd to accept of this way of intro∣ducing my self into your Favour, it will be as well the greatest Happiness, as highest Honour,
My LORD,
