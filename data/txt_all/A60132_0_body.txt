SIR,
IF either the Preaching or publishing of the following Sermon; may be any way useful to promote the great design of doing good; if the seriousness of the Subject, or the weight of the Instance that gave occasion to it, may a∣waken any one Soul to prepare for his final judg∣ment: I know you will heartily rejoyce and bless God with me; and as readily pardon my defects in the management of so important a Theme: and the rather, since I indeavoured only to con∣vince and perswade an attentive Auditory, (con∣sisting mostly of young persons) without the least intention of appearing in Print; as knowing ve∣ry well, that what may be acceptable to a Christi∣an ear, when pronounc'd from the Pulpit, doth often fail of being so, when perus'd afterwards by a critical eye. However, the Impression once consented to, I ought to address it to no other name
but yours; being Conceiv'd and Born in your House, as well as Preacht in your hearing; especi∣ally, when 'twas proper for me to prefix an exam∣ple of the Connexion between seriousness and chearfulness. For having discours'd somewhat concerning the Mirth and Joy of a Christian Life, as well as of the unreasonableness and vanity of sensual pleasures; it seem'd necessary to confirm that Truth by a lively Instance: And were there nothing else to recommend the practice of Godliness, but that tranquillity and peace of mind, that calmness and serenity of spirit which follows a good Conscience, and is the only true ground of a chearful conversation; the argument were very pressing. But I need not mention this, save to let you see the excellency of your choice, and thereby incourage others to make the same. And none, Sir, that understand my obligations to you and to your excellent Lady, will judge me guilty of the usual flattery incident to such Dedications; if I take this first opportunity to avow my Debt of Gratitude and Honour to you both. And such I must profess it, as is exceeded only by the Duty ow∣ing from Children to their natural Parents; my loss of whom, your respects and kindness have in great measure undeservedly supplied.

I have only to add, that as the mention of your Name will doubtless invite many to read the Ser∣mon, who would otherwise be apt to throw it by; so, I am told, I shall lose other Readers, by con∣cealing that of the person, on whose account it was Preacht. To which I have this to say, that his name and quality, his life and Conversation, the circumstances of his sickness, and his temper and expressions on his deathbed, are sufficiently known; to obviate the least insinuation of a Forgery, as to what I have related concerning him. And as to what I have not recited, the Readers benefit would be as unconcern'd in the publication, as his curi∣osity is like to be dissatisfied, if he expect any o∣ther Reason of its concealment.
I am,
Honoured Sir,
