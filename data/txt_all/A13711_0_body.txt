RIght worshipfull, the care of my du∣tifulnes, inforced by the loadstone of your affection, and more then com∣mon kindnesse towards me, hath in∣boldned me to present these few labours, the first fruits of my indeuours, to the eyes of your di∣scretion, hoping you will, in respect of good mea∣ning, and in regard of neighbourhood, I trust, with no lesse care vouchsafe to patronize the same, and suffer them to shelter vnder the de∣fensiue shadowes of your safe protection.
Many I confesse haue trauailed in the same kind before me, both largely and learnedly, (far beyonde the reach of my skill) many wise and
 cunning Bezaleels, fraught with all spirial knoledge, for furthring of spiritual workmanp, hath God in our time raised (and stil may ray I wish) for the building of the Temple of his soin the harts of his children, a temple more glorios . King. 6. then that was of Solomons, though it were ou ∣ayd within & without with the purest gold. M selfe also haue aduenturd to com after thē with my free-will offering, howsoeuer worst able of a thousand to furnish the buylding of the sanctua∣ry, which though it may not presume to prease among the chiefest, yet may it looke for accep∣taunce at least in his due place, like the goates Exod. 35, 23. haire among the fine purple and skarlet.
The booke is too small to bee termed a Ʋo∣lume, your labour will be the shorter in perusing is: But I trust it wil be found of such value, as may vpon due consideration be nothing to your dislike: whatsoeuer it is, I recommend both my selfe and it to your good fauour, and so omitting vnnecessarie circumstances, in regard of your weightie imployments, I take my leaue, resting in more affection, than protestation.
