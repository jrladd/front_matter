SIRS,
I Am prevented in most excuses, for pub∣lishing this which I scarcely dare call a Sermon. I cannot plead special com∣mand
nor yet importunity, it was but a mo∣dest Request, which had therefore the force of a Precept with me, because I am told that my Trumpet was not shrill enough to be heard by those at a distance, I wanted the new in∣vention, or they an Otocousticon, however un∣der your Protection I must plead the privi∣ledg of a Trumpeter to pass without molesta∣tion.
