May it please your Grace:
THough some Writings of extraordina∣ry men may seem to need no Patron, yet I am very sensible that mine do, and this of mine above all the rest (which for the nature of the Subject may pretend to deserve one) because I do easily foresee it will fall under the displeasure of ma∣ny, both for the Author's and Arguments-sake. for the Author's sake, because he hath given his Service to the Church of England, (which he had done many years sooner, but for an invincible impediment, not unknown to your
Grace) and now doth with as much hearti∣ness, chearfulness, and satisfaction, as ever man did, for which there are some that do sto∣mach him the more, because a doubting, trem∣bling, supulous Conformist, is in their ap∣prehension the honestest man that conforms, and in the most safe and salvable condition, though the Spirit of God speaking by St Paul hath told us, That whatsoever is not of faith is sin; and that he that doubteth is damned if he eat.
No less distasteful to many prejudiced and malecontented people is the Argument of the latter part of this Fook: For they cannot en∣dure to hear that Fact called a horrid and bloody Murther, which they have look'd upon as a gallant and heroick Enterprize, not un∣like the signal Atchievements of Jael against Sisera, Ehud against Eglon, recorded in the Book of Judges. I doubt too many had ra∣ther that Act had been made a Precedent, than the Actors thereof an Example. My Lord, If I fly not to your Grace's Protection, men of that ill Character will be ready to swallow me up quick, whilst their rage is kindled against me. For having preached but one 30th. day of January upon the subject of this Book, I know to my sorrow, what it, and a few more expressions of my Conformity cost me; and
how I was made to run the Gaunlet for it, and from some men could have no quarter. But my comfort is, that I have fully satisfied my own Conscience in this that I have writ∣ten, and if your Grace's Judgment shall be also satisfied therewith, I shall value it more, than I shall regard the censure and clamor of a thousand disaffected persons, who for want of Capacity, Learning, and Integrity, are not the thousandth part so able to make a judg∣ment of it. I therefore beseech your Grace, to take both it and its Author under your wing, at least the Author for his good and loyal Intentions, which may extend far to∣wards the covering of his weaknesses, who will easily own that he hath nothing to be proud of (if he may be proud of any thing) but that he had the honour to have been sometime of the same University and Colledge with your Grace, and admitted thereinto upon your Grace's personal Examination and Allowance. I write not this as presuming to invite your Grace to water what you have planted, but only to make a hedge about it, that no wild Creatures may root it up. Now that he whose right hand hath fixed your Grace in that place of Eminency, where you now shine as a Star of the first Magnitude, would always hold your Grace as a Star in his own right hand, and
make you as hitherto your Grace has been, a burning and shining Light, shining forth more and more like the Sun towards the perfect day, is the hearty Prayer of
