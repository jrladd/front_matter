Honoured Sir,
I Present here a Discourse to you which I preach'd to my Parish the Sunday after we had heard of the Death of our late Sovereign: By which you may see how faithfull I am to my Trust, in instructing them to give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, as unto God the things that are God's. And I think it was receiv'd by them with that respect and affection, that is due from all honest and good men to a Discourse of this nature. A while after I had the opportunity to Preach it in the Cathedral at Lincoln, where it was kindly resented by many Loyal persons, of whom the number is very great in that City. But there were a few Heterogeneous men crept in among them that were as much disgusted at it, and no sooner out of the Church, but they fell to calumniate and belye me, perverting my intentions and laying to my charge things that I never said: So that to vindicate my self from the Aspersions of these men I have made the Sermon publick as you see it, after the same Copy by which I spoke it. It will, I presume, endure such a publick Test: For upon a strict
review I find nothing there but what is agreeable to the Doctrine of our Church, and the late General ac∣knowledgments of our Loyal Nobility, Gentry and Clergy in their Addresses to His Sacred Majesty. And therefore I question not your Favourable acceptance of it in particular. As it hath, so it needs, nothing else to commend it to you, but the Loyalty of it, which, it is Argument enough that you approve of, in all its Appearances, because at the Critical time of Trial you abhor'd and withstood the Ʋnnatural and Ʋnchristian Bill of Exclusion; and the same Party, which, in those days of iniquity, would have Excluded His Sacred Majesty from his three Kingdoms, would have also excluded you from the Parliament.
That all future Parliaments may consist of such worthy Members as you, such as will distinguish betwixt Religion and faction, legality and injustice, such as will be as True to the Church and State as the King is pleased to be Gratious to them, is the earnest prayer of,
Honoured Sir,
