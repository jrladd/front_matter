MY LORD,
SInce it hath pleased Almighty God, so to order it, that this present Visitation should happen under your Lordships Government of this great and populous City of London, I have taken the boldness to Dedicate this Treatise to your Lordship, as a Person to whose Care and Piety it seems but a fair respect and duty. It is, my Lord, a short Extract, and just Accompt of every Weeks Christnings and Burials in all the Years of PESTILENCE within the cogni∣zance of the Bills of Mortality; being faithfully drawn from the Registers kept in the Common Hall of the Company of Parish Clerks: Which I hope will redound first to your Lordships satisfaction, and also all the Curious that desire to know the certainty and number of all those that died when Gods hand was upon us, by the most deplorable PESTILENCE. By which the World will have the means and benefit of correcting the Errours
 of divers Papers which have been lately Published by many confident and inconsiderate Writers upon that Subject. So having made this humble tender of my self and my weak Labours to your Honours exceptance, I shall be no farther troublesome, but with my Prayers for your Lordships wel∣fare, and the protection of this famous City, I most dutifully subscribe my self
