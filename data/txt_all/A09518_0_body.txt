BELOVED FREINDS.
IT often falls out whilst some have
thought it nothing to quit the out∣works,
and have blamed the watch
that guarded them, the enemy hath got∣en
within the ports, & the chiefe Citta∣dell
hath beene endangered.
Give mee leave to tell you, that the
cause of all uneven walking, carnall fea∣ing,
& painted profession amongst you,
ariseth from a hart either unbroken or
nbottomd.
For the former of these, you have had
mongst you my poore endevours, I wish
hey had been more spirituall, more pre∣valent.
You had my liberty, and I wish my
ife had gone with it, could that have ac∣omplished
the end of my labours, the
alvation of your soules in the day of the

LORD. I complaine not of unan¦swerable
love from you.
For the second, I send you this tokē
not that you want Catechismes, but tha
you may still know much Water canno
quench my love.
Commend mee to your Children
and Servants and give them this. And
know, that good things, if they bee no
esteemd in the abundance of them, wil
bee better valued by their want.
Oh walke worthy of the Gospell
lest with some desolate Churches you
once say: Wee had the Gospell.
I commend you all to his grace, who
is able to keepe you in the Fellowship
of the Gospel and rest.
