SIR, the great kind∣nesse and courtesie heretofore by me re∣ceiued at your hands whensoeuer I came either to Lam∣beth or Croydon to do my humble dutie vnto your most honorable Lord & maister my L. his grace

of Canterbury, hath many times and often iustly occasioned me to remember you, and to bethinke my poore selfe how happily I might anyway, if not requite you, yet yeald at the least some acknow. ledgement and plaine testimonie of my thankfulnesse in that be∣halfe vnto you. Hereof it com∣meth that being now to publishe this little treatise of horrour of disobedience, I haue presumed (in hope of pardon) to direct the same to you as to a speciall friende me∣riting a farre greater matter frō me. But vntill such time as I may performe some thing of greater moment for you, my trust is you will accept in good part this small

oken of my greate loue towardes ou; And withall still continewour former well-wishing affection owards me. The which I doe ore desire than any waies I am ble to deserue, and yet purpose∣ by Gods grace) further to re∣mpence, if euer either occasion all serue, or power shall better able me thereunto. Euen so with∣anie thankes for your manifold auours, I cease to bee further troublesome at this time vnto ou, beseeching almightie God ll to blesse you with the honou∣able countenance of him whom u serue, and whom for his great ertues sake all good and honest

men doe loue, reuerence, and en∣tirelie honour. From Tanridge this second of Ianuarie 1599.
