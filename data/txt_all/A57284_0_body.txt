Most Noble Patriots;
I Presume, but with that profound Respect which is due to such
an August Assembly, humbly to implore your Protection to
this rude and indigested, yet real Effort of true Love to my
Country, and to you Worthy Patriots in particular, whom all
honest-hearted Scotsmen look upon as the Healers of our Breaches,
and Restorers of our Paths to dwell in: And therefore it is not possible
for any Man who has a drop of true Scots Blood in his Veins, to
hear your Authority impugned, and your Wisdom called in Questi∣on,
without resenting it to the utmost of his Ability: And if, ac∣cording
to the common Opinion of some of our Neighbours, So∣torum
ingenia sint praefervida, an Affront of that Nature is enough
to make them boil over. Hence it is, that in a former Endeavour
I could not forbear to besprinkle, Scotico aceto, some degenerate
Monsters of our Country, who exposed to contempt, as much as
in them lay, whatever Scotsmen account dear in things Civil and
Sacred.
Had it been only a particular Party, or some such pack'd Clubs
as disgraced the Name of Parliaments in former Reigns, and en∣acted
such Laws as their present Majesties, with your Advice, have
declared to be impious; had it, I say been thus, the Matter might
have been the more easily digested; but to have a lawful and a free∣ly
elected Parliament of Scotland, charged in a Neighbouring King∣dom
with a deliberate and malicious Lie, in an Act so unanimously re∣solv'd
on and duly canvas'd, as was that of your Assembly, concern∣ing
the Nation's being first reformed by Presbyters; and that there∣fore
Presbyterian Government is most sutable to the Inclinations of
our People; I say, to have a Lie of that Nature charged upon you,

is a Piece of Impudence that none but the Party culpable could be
guilty of. And yet, as if they had a mind to exhaust all the Trea∣sure
of the bottomless Pit at once, and to bankrupt the Malice and
Falshood of Hell for ever after, they go on to charge you further,
with lodging the Government of the Church, in the Hands of such
blasphemous ignorant and immoral Beasts, as Asrica never produ∣ced
the like; and to aggravate your Guilt, would make our Neigh∣bouring
Nation believe, that at the ame time you have turn'd out
such a Generation of Ministers, as the Primitive Church would
have been proud of for their Sanctity, and adord for their Learn∣ing.
Thus those common Incendiaries, in their printed Libels,
treat the Parliament of Scotland; which for the Antiquity of its
Standing, and fulness of its Power, gives place to none in Europe.
But it is not to be wondred at, most Noble Patriots, that that Par∣ty
should treat you thus, seeing they hate your being any otherwise
than to serve as their Drudges, and devour the best and most industrious
Part of the Subjects; by which both you, and that Ancient King∣dom
which you represent, were well-nigh entomb'd in Oblivion
and Disgrace. It was that Party who changed a well-limited and
regular Monarchy, into an absolute and uncontroulable Tyranny;
that durst arrogate, a Power to cass and annul your firmest Laws,
and treat you with Contempt as perfect SlavesK. James's Proclamation.. It was that Par∣ty
who robbed Christ of his Prerogatives Royal, to be Jewels in
the Crowns of their Absolute MonarchsAct of Supremacy.. It was that Party
which robbed the People of their Consciences, to bring them to an
absolute dependance on the Prelatical MitresAct for friot Confori∣y.: And not only de∣prived
you of the Property of your HousesBy frequent making them Garisons., but denied you a
safe Retreat into your own HeartsExtorting your Thoughts by Torture, and then hanging you for them.. It was that Party who
rendred K. Iames the Sixth so much a Prelatical Bigot, as to the di∣sturbance
both of Church and State, and contrary to his Oath, to
obtrude Bishops upon the Nation, and persecute the sincerest Prote∣stants,
while at the same time he indulged the Papists; and in fine,
had such an aversion for his Native Country, that instead of see∣ing
it once in three Years, for administring Justice according to his
Promise, he never came to it but once after his Succession to the
Crown of England; and instead of favouring his Church of Scot∣land,

which he pretended once so much to admire, he persecuted
those who declin'd a Conformity with the Church of England. It
was that Party who influenced Charles the First, though a Native
of Scotland, to put such an intolerable Affront upon the Nation, as
to demand their Crown to be sent to England; and afterwards to
invade us with a formidable Army, designing an absolute Conquest,
and in an unnatural manner to subject that Nation to his newly ac∣quired
Crown; which his Ancestors did so much disdain, that they
maintain'd 300 Years War upon that Head with no small Glory.
And how the Faction prevail'd with Charles the Second, to requite
our Nation for making themselves a Field of Blood in Defence of
his Title, is so fresh, that it needs not be recapitulated; and it is
yet much more recent, how well K. Iames the Seventh rewarded us
for owning his Right of Succession, when England had in a manner
spued him out by the Bill of Exclusion; he, I say, rewarded us,
by publishing such despotical Proclamations, as with an unparallel'd
audacity, declared us Slaves to the perpetual Infamy of that Genera∣tion
of Scotsmen, who were so tamely bereft of their Liberty, which
our Noble Progenitors maintained against Romans, Picts, Britains,
Danes, Saxons, Normans and English, for twenty preceeding Ages.
So that I say, considering how the Prelatical Faction inluenced those
four Monarchs to treat our Nation, though they derived their Be∣ing
and Honour from it; and were otherwise in many respects,
tantorum haud quaquam indigni avorum. The Resolve of your August
Assembly, that Prelacy was an insupportable Grievance to that
Kingdom, deserves to be engraven in Pillars of Corinthian Brass;
and that all Scotsmen (as no doubt many thousands will) should
not only whe their Pens, but their Swords, in defence of it. It
is that Party, who in this Reign, impugn your Authority, by procu∣ring
Letters from Court to command such things to the Assembly as
by Law they are not obliged to comply with; and if they should have
done it, could neither have been answerable to God nor your Honours
for it, to pull down with their own Hands, that Hedg which he in
his Providence, by your Act, hath set about the Church, in lodging
the Government upon themselves, which no doubt the Wisdom of
your August Assembly judged to be the best Expedient to secure the
Peace of the Church; and yet for noncompliance, how did they
procure the Dissolution and Reproach of that Assembly, to the ma∣nifest
violation of your Authority; and that by the Advice of some
English Courtiers and Prelats, as if they had a mind to homologate
the Ancient Pretensions of that Crown and Church over yours,

and in the view of the World declare our Parliament and General
Assembly not able to give Advice in our own Affairs, but fit to be
over-ruled by a pack'd Club of another Nation: and shall they act
thus impune to affront a Parliament, which Malice it self cannot say,
as their Party did formerly of the English Parliament, That it is but
a superfluous Tumour or Wen: for all who know our History, are
sensible of the share which the Scots Parliaments have, from the first
Constitution of our Government, been possest of, not only in the
Legislative, but the Executive Power: and, if our Historians may be
believed, laid the Foundation, and have often-times since regulated
and limited the Power of our Monarchy; and to the eternal Con∣fusion
of all those who would insinuate the danger thereof to King∣ly
Government, have, notwithstanding, preserved our Monarchy in
a longer and more uninterrupted Succession than any Nation of
Europe.
It is not unknown to your August Assembly what Convulsions
the Prelatical Party have thrown the Kingdom into, since the first
Intrusion of their Prelacy; and how near the Ruine both of our
Religious and Civil Liberties were effected, by their Concurrence
with the Tyranny of the late Reigns, represented in your Claim of
Right; and therefore the World cannot but justify your Conduct
in depriving them of any share of the Government of the Church,
which they only seek, that they may undermine; and tho they
should comply with the Terms required in Law, yet their former
Perjuries and contradictory Tests are but too shrew'd Causes to
suspect their future Levity, which, together with the Disaffected∣ness
they have generally evidenced to the present Government, de∣monstrates
how dangerous it is to entrust them with the Conduct
of Peoples Consciences. And what may justly render them hateful
to all honest Scots-men, is the Obloquy and Reproach they have
thrown here upon the whole Nation; and their under-hand deal∣ing
with the high-flown Church-of-England-Party, who have a
Heart-hatred at our Country and Religion; and have treated you
with so much Contempt, that tho you mov'd for an Union, and
his Majesty was graciously pleased to back it, they disdain'd to give
him any Answer, as thinking you unworthy of a Politick or Tem∣poral
Union; and yet they would be at forcing you to an Ecclesia∣stical
and Spiritual Union, which if they could effectuate, the World
must allow that they ought, in the next place, to beg us for Fools,
who could believe that they have a Kindness for our Souls, who
have one for our Bodies. Yet this is the Party that our Prelatical

Country-men do so much court and make Application to, while
they slight Scots-men who are authoriz'd to represent our Affairs:
So much have they divested themselves of all natural Respect to
their Country, that if their Prelacy live, they care not tho the Name
and Fame of Scotland die: and that they may effectuate their De∣signs,
there's no doubt but they will be forming Parties in your
August Assembly, and make many fair Pretences of desiring Liberty
only to exercise what belongs to their pretended indelible Character
of Pastors, and promise to undertake nothing to the Disturbance
of the publick Tranquillity: But their worming themselves in by
degrees in King Iames the VIth's time under fair Pretences, and
then overturning all when they had opportunity, is a sufficient
Caveat to beware of them, as inwardly ravening Wolves, tho out∣wardly
they appear in Sheeps Cloathing. Your August Assembly
cannot so soon have forgot that the Nation was almost totally ruined,
your Counties invaded by savage Highlanders, your Tenants
murdered, and Families impoverish'd, your Houses plundered, your
Wives, Daughters, and Relations ravish'd, your selves and tender
Infants exposed to Wandring, Hunger, Nakedness and Cold, and
all the Miseries and Oppressions which you groan'd under in the
late Reigns, both as to Soul and Body. I say your Honours cannot cer∣tainly
have forgot these things, so far as to be prevail'd upon by any
Insinuations whatever, again to deliver up your bleeding Church
and Country into the Hands of that Faction, lest the latter end be
worse than the first.
There's no cause to fear a Rupture with England on that account.
The good Church-of-England-Laity, and not a few of their Clergy,
have incurred danger enough from their high-flown Tantivies, and
have smarted sufficiently under their Doctrine of Passive Obedience,
to make them cautious and willing to secure themselves from their
Fury, so far will they be from concurring with them against you.
The chief Arguments used here for re-admitting the Prelatical
Clergy are, That it will contribute to his Majesty's Interest, and
please the Church of England, and supply the vacant Congrega∣tions.
As to the first, How it can promote his Majesty's Interest
to disoblige the greatest part of Scotland, and all the Dissenters in
England and Ireland, is beyond the reach of Mankind to determine.
2. How it can be supposed that a Party, who have hitherto witnessed
so much Rancour against his Majesty's Person, Family and Govern∣ment,
as the Scots Episcopal Clergy have done, is only to be answered
by those who can swear contradictory Oaths, as our Curats did in





their infamous Tests, &c. As to the second, That it will please
the Church of England; it may easily be answered, that we do
not ow them so much Kindness; and if we did, we must first
know what that Church of England is that we must oblige; for
hitherto she hath been an individuum Vagum, that no body knows
where to find, it being as difficult to define her, as to make a
Coat for the Moon. Her Doctrinal Articles are own'd by us, and
all good Protestants; but that is not the Characteristick of
the Church of England: for in the late Reigns Passive Obedience
and Nonresistance were her Shibboleth; but now she hath renounced
those Doctrines, by acting diametrically opposite to them. And for
a Character of the Church of England in this Reign, we cannot
certainly have it better than from a Vote of the last House of
Commons, who resolved on an Address of Thanks to his Majesty
for the Care he had taken of the Church of England, in the Altera∣tion
which was then made in the Lieutenancy of London; and that
was, because by the ill Advice of a certain Prelate and others, the
Military Power of the City was lodg'd in those who had surren∣dred
her Charter, and dipp'd their Hands in the Blood of my
Lord Russel, Colonel Sidney, Alderman Cornish, &c. and contributed
to the Arbitrary Methods of the late Reigns: And because this
is but one half of the Parliament, let's look into the higher House,
and there you will find, that according to the opinion of none of
the least Church-of-England-Men, when the Act pass'd for depri∣ving
the Nonjurant Bishops, it was look'd upon as a fatal Blow
to the Church of England. So that in plain terms, the Jacobite
Party is what that Faction means by the Church of England. And
as a Commentary upon the Text, let's but consider the main En∣gine
which they have made use of to quash the Discovery of all Plots
against the Government, and we shall find that it was by giving
out those Discoveries as the Efforts of Republicans and Dislenters
against the Church of England; and if we look nearer home, and
consider how it comes to pass that such Men are advanced to the
highest Places in the Scots Government, who were the Contrivers,
Enacters, and bloody Executioners of those Laws which your
August Assembly hath declared to be impious, we shall find it to be
done by the Interest of that Party in the Church of England. If we
consider further, whence it is that those who betray'd our Army,
murder'd our People, and plotted the Destruction of your Conventi∣on,
escape unpunish'd, you will fin'd it to be by the Procurement of the
aforesaid Party. Now all these things being considered, it will easily

appear, whether it be your Interest to oblige this Church or not.
Or, if we take her according to the general Acceptation of Bi∣shops
and Ceremonies, the Vote of your August Assembly concerning
Prelacy, your Act establishing Presbytery as most agreeable to the
Word of God, and the Opposition made to the Ceremonies by our
Country in Charles the First's time, will speedily determine the case.
And it will yet appear less reasonable to oblige that Church, so
taken, if we consider, that those of her own Communion, and the
best of them too, look upon both Bishops and Ceremonies to be
indifferent, and not of Divine Institution, as may be seen by the
Writings of Mr. Hickeringil, Counsellor Stephens, and Stillingfleet's
Irenicum. So that in effect, the best of the Church-of-England-Communion
are embark'd in the same Bottom with your selves,
and the common Enemies of both call them Presbyterians as well
as you, and treated them accordingly in the late Reigns: So that
from that worthy part of the Church of England, who are Men of
good Lives, and keep firm to the Doctrine of their Church, you
need fear no Opposition; for to do them Justice, they are as zealous
for the Protestant Religion as any, and never join'd in persecuting
their Brethren of a different Opinion.
To what they pretend of supplying the vacant Churches, may
speedily be replied; The Assembly hath declared their Willingness
to employ such of them as are Godly and Orthodox. And as for
others, the good old way of our Church in the Reformation (when
Ministers were scarcer than now) of appointing Men to preach by
turns to those vacant Congregations till they can be otherwise sup∣plied,
is the much safer and better Expedient, than to entrust such Men
with the Charge of other Peoples Souls, who have discovered so little
care of their own, and whom in your Wisdom you objected against
as the great and insupportable Grievance of the Nation. Nor
have you any such Encouragement from their former Success to
imploy them again: and if it shall seem good in your Eyes to go
on as you begun, and encourage a Reformation, such of our
Country-men as are abroad, will be the sooner prevail'd with to
come home; and others to prosecute their Studies, to adapt them
for the Ministry, and fill up the Vacancies; for it cannot be hid
from your Illustrious Assembly, that the intrusting the chief Ene∣mies
of the Presbyterians in the Government, is a great Discou∣ragement
to all that wish well to our Church or Country; and

administers but too just cause of Suspicion, that we must either be
imbroil'd in a Civil War, or return to our former Bondage, which
nothing but your Care, with his Majesty's Assistance and God's Bles∣sing,
is able to prevent.
Your Honours may perhaps be inclin'd to think, that there is
too much Gall in my Pen against our Prelatical Clergy; but such of
your Number as have been lately at London, cannot but know what
an Odium they have endeavoured to bring upon the Country in ge∣neral,
and your August Assembly in particular; insinuating, That
you are neither the True nor full Representatives of the Nation, and but
a meer surreptitious Faction got together by the Opportunity of tuml∣tuous
Times; and that you neither acted from a Principle of Honour
nor Conscience, but did only what you thought would be pleasing to the
Prince of Orange. And hence they have used their utmost Endea∣vours
to have you Dissolv'd, by the Interest of the high-slown Pre∣latical
English Courtiers, to whom they represent you in the black∣est
Colours, which their Malice or Wit can invent: And not only
so, but they make use of your Name, as the Turkish Slaves do
those of their Barbarous Masters from whom they have escaped, to
move those of the Church-of-England-Communion to open their
Purses, pretending that you have turn'd them out in a barbarous
and illegal manner, or that they have had such and such Indigni∣ties
and Affronts put upon them. And thus they beg from one Cler∣gy-man
to another, and spend what they get at Taverns and Ale∣houses,
or sitting up whole Nights at Cards, particularly at Mills
in Westminster, or Hutchinsons in the Hay-Market: and when their
Stock is spent, renew the begging Trade, or else troop about the
Country, and with their stol'n Sermons, or railing Invectives a∣gainst
the Government of Scotland, both in Church and State, insi∣nuate
themselves into the Adorers of Bishops and Ceremonies;
for the latter of which, though they exclaim'd against them at
Home, they profess themselves to be mighty Zealots Abroad: and thus
they disseminate their Poison in our Neighbouring Nation, by their
lying Tongues and blasphemous Pamphlets. So that hence your
August Assembly may have a sufficient view, whether it be safe to
reintroduce such Men into the Church, who have given up them∣selves
to all manner of Villanies, and are become Devotoes to
those unscriptural Ceremonies, which occasion'd the fatal War in
Charle the First's Time; and have moreover evidenced such Le∣vity

and Unsted fastness both in imbracing & rejecting them at Home,
since the Revolution, that it's visible they are not acted by Princi∣ple,
but Interest; and that their Interest has been always contrary
to what your August Assembly hath now espoused, both as to Poli∣cy
and Religion, is so evident, that whoever casts but an Eye up∣on
the History ever since they were obtruded upon the Nation,
may soon be convinc'd of it: Or by a shorter view, if they please
but to read the Grievances which you desired to be redressed by
their present Majesties, of which the Bishops and Clergy were for
the most part Contriers, Promoters and Actors. And we may the
better be satisfied what those Men who now sollicite for a Share in
the Government of the Church, do chiefly aim at, both as to that
and the State, if we do but consider that their principal Converse
is with the Jacobites in England, and that the chiefest of their
Friends are none of the best Williamites in Scotland.
It's not unlike that your Honours may be accosted with this a∣mongst
other Arguments, that admitting those Men to a share of
Church-Government, will gratify the King to whom you are so much
obliged, which of it self is an impeachment of your Wisdom; for
none can so well know the Interest of Scotland as a free chosen Par∣liament,
who are consequently fittest to give the King Advice:
And seeing the Interest of all good Kings, and their People, is one
and the same, that ought to be most grateful to the King which is
so to the People, and what that is you have already declared. It is
obvious to those that know our History, that ever since the Refor∣mation,
the Church of Scotland hath claim'd a Right of Calling and
Adjourning her own Assemblies, pro re nata; and what dismal Con∣sequences
the Invasion of that Privilege hath been attended with,
to those Kings and Grandees who have attempted it, is so well
known, that it cannot easily be forgot. And whether King Iames
the Sixth's Curse hath not taken place upon those of his Successors
who invaded the Church, the Revolutions of the Crown have suf∣ficiently
witnessed: and if the Hand of God hath not been re∣markably
seen in punishing those Great Ones who were their
Tools, let the Ruin of their Families from time to time declare.
Nor hath the Nation escap'd punishment for the Treachery of their
Representatives, God having been justly provok'd to give them
and their Liberties to be swallowed up by those very Men whom
they would needs set upon his Throne, and into whose Hands they

betray'd the Liberties of the Church, of which your own Claim
of Right is a speaking Monument: and seeing there is no doubt
but your August Assembly had valuable Reasons for abolishing the
Supremacy, it's an Affront to your Authority to demand its Resti∣tution:
Its being possess'd by the Church, can bring no Damage
to the Crown; for Presbyterians are known to have as good, if not
a better Opinion of his present Majesty, than any other of his Sub∣jects;
and all Men of Sense must needs take it for a Proof of it, that
they sollicite for such good Laws in his Reign, as may secure them
from the danger of others. And seeing our Church-men are sub∣ject
to the Laws, and never did refuse to assemble at the Call of
their Kings, and to give an Account of their Affairs, it's but equal
to leave them in the Possession of that Liberty of calling Assem∣blies,
concerning their own Matters, which the Church was pos∣sessed
of before ever there was a Christian Magistrate, if the 15th
of the Acts be the Word of God. And certainly he who promised
that Kings should be Nursing-Fathers, did never intend that they
should be Step-Fathers, to rob the Children of what is their
due.
As for the Calumnies of your Church of-England-Enemies, it is
easy to stop their Mouth with Argumentum ad Hominem; their Car∣riage
to K. Iames the Seventh, proclaims their unshaken Loyalty.
And for your own Episcopal Party, all the World knows that they
and their Kings together, did so tyrannize over your Bodies and
Souls, that you durst scarcely plead a Property in either. And if
the Church of England must be pleased, which is the Achillean Argu∣ment
used by the Party, we can justly answer the peevish Lady,
as the young Crab did the old One, I prae Mater & ego sequar.
Let's see how careful she will be to testify her Gratitude to his Ma∣jesty,
in taking off the Test, and taking in Dissenters to the
Church, which will but just make them even with us; and then, and
time enough then, because we are the oldest Nation, we may think
which way to make the next Advance: for as we have got the Pre∣cedency,
it's but reasonable we should keep it; for I know so much
by my self, that Scotsmen love to go, but neither to be driven nor
dragg'd.
I cannot but acquaint your Honours, that since the writing of
what is above, the Jacobites here are mightily elevated, and big

with hopes of seeing you all in Confusion, and the Nation in a
Flame, by the Designs which they give out to be on foot amongst
you, of lodging the Power of Calling and Dissolving Church-Assem∣blies
in the Magistrate alone, and depriving the People of the
Right of chusing Ministers, by which means they are so bold as to
say, That they hope not only to see Prelacy gradually reintroduced,
but their late Monarch reinthroned: And that they may accomplish
these Designs, will insinuate themselves into both Parties; and are
very confident, that the Result will answer their Expectation for a
speedy Reestablishment, of Prelacy at least; these Measures, as they
give out, being concerted with English Prelats, who have form'd a
Party among you for their Designs. But as they have hitherto re∣proach'd
your Proceedings, there's no doubt but this is a Calumny
from the same Forge, by which they would Ridicule your Authori∣ty,
and represent you to the World as Men of no Principle nor So∣lidity,
but such as will make your self Transgressors, in building
again what you have already destroy'd. But may the God and Fa∣ther
of our Lord Jesus Christ direct your Counsels, so as to issue in
the Comfort of his Church, Peace of the Nation, and Confusion of
those your black-mouth'd Enemies, who are engaged in an Interest,
not only distinct from, but altogether destructive of yours: Of which
there's no room to doubt, if we consider the following Address of
the Representatives of their Church, which they have endeavour'd
to perform on all Occasions; and as they have never yet revok'd it,
we need not doubt but that the Party are still of the same mind.




May it please your most Sacred Majesty,
WE prostrate our selves to pay our most Devote Thanks and Ado∣ration
to the Soveraign Majesty of Heaven and Earth, for pre∣serving
Your Sacred Life and Person, so frequently exposed to the greatest
Hazards, and as often delivered, and You miraculously prospered with
Glory and Victory, in Defence of the Rights and Honour of Your Majesty's
August Brother, and of these Kingdoms; and that by his Merciful
Goodness the Ragings of the Sea, and Madness of Vnreasonable M have
been stilled and calmed: And Your Majesty, as the Darling of Heaven,

peaceably seated on the Thrones of your Royal Ancestors, whose Long,
Illustrious and Uparallell'd Line, is the greatest Glory of this Your Ancient
Kingdom.
We pay our most humble Gratitude to Your Majesty for the repeated Assu∣rances
of Your Royal Protection to our National Churoh and Religion, as
the Laws have established them; which are very sutable to the Graciu
Countenance, Encouragement and Protection Your Majesty was pleased to
afford to our Church and Order, whilst we were happy in Your Presence
amongst us.
We magnify the Divine Mercy in blessing Your Majesty with a Son,
and us with a Prince, whom we pray Heaven may bls and preserve to
sway Your Royal Scepter after You, and that he may inherit with Your
Dominions the Illustrious and Heroick Vertes of his August and most
Serene Parents.
We are amazed to hear of the danger of an Invasion from Holland, which
excites our Prayers for an universal Repentance to all Orders of Men, that
God may yet spare his People, preserve Your Royal Person, and prevent the
Effusion of Christian Blood, and to give such Succes to Your Majesty's Arms,
that all who invade Your Majesty's just and undoubted Rights, and disturb
or interrupt the Peace of Your Reas, may be disappointed and clothed
with Shame; so that on Your Royal Head the Crown may still fourish.
As, by the Grace of God, e shall presve in our selves a firm and un∣shaken
Loyalty, so we shall be careful and zealous to promote in all Your
Subjects an intrepid and stedfast Allegiance to Your Majesty, as an Essential
Part of their Religion, and of the Glory of our Holy Profession, not
doubting but that God in his great Mercy, who hath so often preserved
and delivered Your Majesty, will still preserve and deliver You, by giving
You the Hearts of Your Subjects, and the Necks of Your Enemies. So
pray we, who, in all Humility, are,
May it please Your Most Sacred Majesty,
 Edinburg, Nov. 3. 1688.



Pardon my Freedom, most Noble Patriots; God the Searcher of
Hearts, knows what Veneration I have for your August Assembly,
as Representatives of the ancientest Kingdom upon Earth: I own
that your Wisdom and Authority sets you above the reach of
Dictates; nor is any thing here intended as such; for if the Case
would admit it, I am far from the Vanity of thinking my self able
to do it, but cannot forbear to contribute my poor Mite towards
the Vindication of what you have already done, and to put you in
mind how much your Wisdom is vilified, and your Authority im∣pugn'd
amongst Strangers, which I have the opportunity of know∣ing
better than many of the Members of your August Assembly.
And at the same time to inform your Honours, that the Authors are
our Prelatists, a Set of Men whom you voted to be the insuppor∣table
Grievance of the Nation; and certainly not without very good
Reason, seeing they had in a great measure obscured the Glory
which our Gallant Ancestors had acquired by their noble Defence
of the Liberties of their Country from Tyrants at home, and Ee∣mies
abroad, and particularly Rome, both Pagan and Popish. May
the God of Heaven and Earth pour out his best Blessing upon you
in general, and incline your Hearts, with of that your Heroick Sove∣raign,
to what may be best for the Good of the Nation, and the
Glory of his Name.
