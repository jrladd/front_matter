Right Honorable,
AMongst all the exceed∣ing
great and precious
Promises which the
Lord hath made unto
his People, these are of a very ra∣diant
Lustre, and special Magni∣tude;
2 Sam. 7. 10. That he would appoint a
place for them, and plant them,
that they should dwell in a place

of their own, and move no
more, neither should the Chil∣dren
of Wickedness afflict them
any more as before time. That
he would build them and not pull
them down,Jer. 24: 6, 7. and plant them
and not pluck them up, and give
them an Heart to know him,
and to return unto him with
their whole Heart. Whereby we
understand, that Stability and
Sanctity, Healing and Holiness,
are two most Eminent and Signal
Mercies of God unto a People,
who have been long exercised with
Breach upon Breach, and emp∣tied
from Vessel into Vessel.
How sad the Condition of these
discomposed and dilacerated

Nations hath been; how dole∣ful
the Earthquakes and Concus∣sions
both in Church and State;
how daring the Insolencies and
Attempts of men of unstable minds
destitute of solid and steady Prin∣ciples,
acted by the various and quo∣tidian
Conduct of changeable and
domestical Interests, have been a∣gainst
our Jachin and our Boaz,
Authority in our Parliaments,
and Ministry in our Churches,
hath been so well known both at
home and abroad, as to render
these Nations a Shame to them∣selves,
and a Ludibrium to the
World. What the great Works
are which the Lord by the won∣derful
Series and Vicissitudes of

Providence is doing in the midst
of us, the Hearts of his Servants,
hanging in suspence between Hope
and Fear, do tremulously attend
upon, and labor to understand.
When we consider the maturity of
our mighty Sins, we have great
reason to fear his Wrath; and
when we observe the progress of his
Wonderful works, we have some
comfortable Encouragement to
hope for the renewall of his Mer∣cy.
And that so much the rather,
because he hath stirred up your
hearts in this great City to return
unto him the glory due unto his
name for his goodness to these
Nations, in restoring the Par∣liament,
and unto your selves, in

restoring your Council, and healing
the Wound inflicted on the Honor
of this Renowned City. That the
Lord will be graciously pleased to
crown and consummate the Mer∣cies
which he hath begun, in guide∣ing
the hearts of the people to chuse
for this next Parliament, men of
Eminency for Piety and Pru∣dence,
who may come with healing
Spirits, and make it their business
to repair our Breaches, and be
the Restorers of Paths to dwell
in, who may lay to heart the Interest
of Christ and his Church, and pro∣mote
purity of Doctrine and Wor∣ship,
due Administration of Holy
Ordinances, and whatever may
conduce to the Power of Godli∣ness,

and the Comfort of all that
love the Lord Jesus in sincerity;
That he will be pleased to set his
Eye and his Heart upon this City
for good, and to dwell in it night
and day, to be a Wall of Fire
about it, and the Glory in the
midst of it, to appoint Salvation
for Walls and Bulwarks unto it,
is and shall be the hearty Prayer
of

March 14.
1659.
