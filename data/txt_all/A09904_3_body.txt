THat thou art such a Iudge, so qualifi'de,
As Authors heretofore haue all prescrib'de
A well elected Iusticer should be;
Each man perceiues the reasons pregnancy:
Custome of doing well in lower place,
Can with no spurre of Honor change his pace:
Besides an other cause I thinke vpon,
Thou wilt not blame the Kings election.
But why in stead of Iustice, to these labours
Hast thou afforded them so many fauours?
I know no reason may induce thee too't,
But that it is thy goodnesse makes thee doo't.
