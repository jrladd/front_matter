My Lord,
THe many testimonies of your excel∣lent nature, with so much furni∣ture, and ornament of learning; have in the hearts of the knowing world erected monuments to your living fame, and long since prepard my particular ambition to be knowne to you, that , among other, whose more happy wits have gind by be∣ing onely read under so noble a Patron, might by some timely application derive upon me your Lordships influence. Be pleas'd my most honourable Lord to ac∣cept this Poeme, till something of more high endeavour

may present my service, yet let me not barre it the truth of this Character, it hath beene grateful to the stage, and graciously entertain'd at Court by their Majesties, Now if your Lordship smile upon it in this addresse, and bid it welcome, it shall dwell with ho∣nour and security under your name, and the author glory to professe himselfe
My Lord
Your most humble Honourer,
IAMES SHIRLY.
