DEarely be∣loued:
my
hearts de∣sire,
and
prayer to God for you,
is, that yee may be sa∣ued:
And that ye may
be the better perswa∣ded
of my heartie af∣fection
to you-wards,

I haue heere presen∣ted
to your eyes, that
which heretofore hath
been offred vnto your
eares; nothing doub∣ting
but that, as then it
found attentiue audi∣ence,
so now it shall
receiue kinde accep∣tance.
Yee haue runne
well, endure vnto the
end, that yee may bee
saued. To helpe you
and others forward in
the Christian race, I
haue vndertaken this
taske, hoping that yee
vvill haue remem∣brance

of these things
after my departing
from you, that so yee
may follow the truth
in loue, & in all things
grow vp vnto him
which is the head, that
is, Christ. In the meane
time, I shall thinke my
trauaile and pains hap∣pily
bestowed; my
ministry and seruice
highly blessed, and my
poore labours richly
honoured and rewar∣ded,
if I may bring any
one to a more serious
examination and triall

of himselfe, to a godly
sorrow for the vvant
of grace, and to a holy
hungring and thirsting
after more grace. And
thus, my brethren, I
commend you to God,
and to the Word of his
Grace, which is able to
build further, and to
giue you an inheri∣tance
among all that
are sanctified. Pray
for mee
