GOod Friend: As wee cannot but account it an extraordina∣ry blessing of God in direct∣ing our course for these parts, after we came out of our natiue countrey, for that we had the happinesse to be posses∣sed of the comforts we receiue by the bene∣fit of one of the most pleasant, most health∣full, and most fruitfull parts of the world: So must wee acknowledge the same blessing to bee multiplied vpon our whole company, for that we obtained the honour to receiue allowance and approbation of our free possession, and enioying thereof vnder the authority of those thrice honou∣red Persons, the President and Counsell for the affaires of New-England, by whose boun∣ty and grace, in that behalfe, all of vs are ti∣ed to dedicate our best seruice vnto them, as those vnder his Majestie, that wee owe it vnto: whose noble endeuours in these their

actions the God of heauen and earth mul∣tiply to his glory and their owne eternall comforts.
As for this poore Relation, I pray you to accept it, as being writ by the seuerall Actors themselues, after their plaine and rude manner; therefore doubt nothing of the truth thereof: if it be defectiue in any thing, it is their ignorance, that are better acquainted with planting then writing. If it satisfie those that are well affected to the businesse, it is all I care for. Sure I am the place we are in, and the hopes that are apparent, cannot but suffice any that will not desire more then enough, neither is there want of ought among vs but compa∣ny to enioy the blessings so plentifully be∣stowed vpon the inhabitants that are here. While I was a writing this, I had almost forgot, that I had but the recommendation of the relation it selfe, to your further consi∣deration, and therefore I will end without saying more, saue that I shall alwaies rest
From PLIMOTH in New-England.
