My Lord,
IN the Eastern parts
of the World, no
Man approaches a
Great, an Illustri∣ous
Person, without
a Present: And in these Western
parts it hath been for many

Ages a Custome, (and still re∣mains
so) to dedicate Books
of Curious and Polite Learning,
to Eminent, and Worthy
Men. And this for several
Reasons: for by prefixing be∣fore
the Books they publish the
Names of those Excellent Men
to whom they are obliged for
former benefits, They do
thereby in some measure ex∣press
their Gratitude: As also
by that means their works are
better Adorned; and thus recei∣ving
Splendor from their Pa∣trons
Glory, they thereby gain
the better acceptation in the
World. Some propose the
writing of Panegyricks in Ho∣nour
of their Patrons. But

that looking so like Flattery, I
willingly avoid. Besides, it
were madness to suppose, your
Lordships Masculine Virtues
both of Mind, and Body; As
your Courage, Generosity, Sin∣gular
Prudence, Equity, Candor,
Affability, Compassion to the Af∣flicted,
&c. can possibly be
described, or comprized, with∣in
the Limits of an Epistle:
Nor need I attempt the doing
this, since your Lordships tru∣ly
Noble Qualities, are so E∣minently
known to the whole
Nation.
I Address this Book to your
Lordship, not for any of the
aforegoing Arguments, but
chiefly for the following Cause.

The Art by which the Experi∣ments
produced in these Papers
are made, (viz. Chymistry) hath
in all Ages been imbraced, and
cultivated by both the Learned
Magi and Kings, and is at this day
much prized, and Practised by
many of the Princes of Germany:
And highly esteemed and pro∣moted
by the Example of our
own Sovereign's delighting in
it, and favouring of it. And
it must be granted that the An∣tients
could not bestow so
much Honour upon it, as it
hath gained (in this our time)
by obtaining your Lordships
Favour. For you have
added new Rayes to Illustrate

it, by your Studying and
Practising of it.
My Lord, Having mentio∣ned
this, I have shewed the
cause why I presume to make
you this Present: The Treatise
it self being of that Art, where∣of
your Lordship is so great a
Master; And therefore I hope
the Argument will not be un∣grateful.
The Original Au∣thor
is sufficiently known (a∣broad)
to be both a Learned,
and Practically knowing Man,
and he thought this piece worth
the presenting to a whole Soci∣ety
of Men, that are likewise
such themselves; I mean the
German Academy of the CURIOSI.
It hath also the Applause of

many of our ingenious Vertu∣osi
of the Royal Society: These
Reasons have incouraged me to
put it into English: And to de∣posite
it at your Feet. Desire∣ing
your Lordships acceptation
of it, as a Testimony of Vene∣ration,
And the Eternal de∣voting
of my Self,
From my Study London, 
this 4th of April, 1677.
