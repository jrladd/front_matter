Worthy Sir,
THE grand Concern, in order to felicity in the next World, is that of true
Reli∣gion, in order to happiness in this, that of our health. How industriously and tenderly we ought to demean our selves for the attaining of the former, and preserving of the latter, the elaborate Works of Divine and Spiritual Di∣rectors, on the one side, and Physicians, on the other, are a sufficient testimony.
Among the latter, our Author, Sanctorius, chief Professor of Physick, in his time, at Padua, hath been very eminent for his many Productions upon that Subject; but more particularly by this, wherein he entertains us with a new discovery; but such as he had found confirmable by above thirty years ex∣perience.
But, Sir, as to the present publication of it in the English Tongue, so long after its first appearance in the Original, I have only to say, that you were in some measure the
occasion of it. For, though I had had the Traduction by me some considerable time be∣fore; Yet I should have suffer'd it to have lain by a while longer, if some accidental discourse concerning it, had not awakened my thoughts into a change of that Resolution. And that encourag'd me to this Dedication, with this desire only, that it may stand as a publick acknowledgement of the satisfaction and advantages, which I have derived from your happy ucquaintance, and consequently how much I am,
Worthy Sir,
