Son,
I Have forborne to set your Name on the Forehead of these Animadversi∣ons, not that I am ashamed either of Them or You, but for such like Reasons.
First, because some Truths, I here indeavour to make legible,

the tyranny of Custome and Policy labors to conceale, as destructive to the Project of Government; and therefore unlikely to passe by wise men, without a formall re∣proofe; who have beene long since taught by unerring Experience, That Ignorance drawes with the least reluctancy, in the Yoake of Obedience; being of so sheepish a Nature, as she is no bodies foe but her owne.
Next to spare you the trouble of arming your Reason, in way of defence, upon every Alarum, They may receive, from the Cen∣sures of wiser or weaker Judg∣ments: For not carrying the

markes of your particular Interest, you may stand, as it were un∣seen, behind the Curtine of indifferency, and heare without blushing the Opinions of others, if chance or your will should please to make Them the ob∣ject of their Discourse. Amongst whom, if any accuse Them, as too cheape and obvious, They are unadvised Questioners of their owne Charter, in case they should be Fathers: who were never de∣ny'd yet the fredome to teach their Children to manage an Hobby∣horse, without offering violence to Gravity or Discretion.
Neither do we so ordinarily

fall through the unevennesse or difficulty of the way, as careles∣nesse and ignorance in the Journals of former Experi∣ence: This makes it the greatest demonstration of Paternall Af∣fection, like the Pelican, to dis∣sect my selfe before you, and by ripping up mine owne Bowels, to let you see where the defects of humanity reside, which are not only the occasions of many corpo∣reall Diseases, but of most of the Misfortunes accompanying Life.
And though, in passing through so much weaknesse, They are rendered more deficient, then,

considered in their owne Nature, in truth they are; Yet, being the best I am able to afford you, They cannot but be looked upon by You for as lively a Monument of my Love, as if they bare the Magi∣steriall Impresse of a worke of Solomons.
And in regard of Time, none can be more opportune then this, in which men carry breasts of steele against those of their own Profession (some niceties excep∣ted) under the imperious pretence of Religion.
If any blinded with Ignorance, or misled by a more candid Na∣ture, should engage for the suffi∣ciency

of These, or any thing else, I have writ: I am conscious of too many flawes in my selfe, to be swell'd beyond my naturall proportion.
Your sake alone produced Them, that during the little time I have to live, you might turne to my Iudgment, upon all occasions, without trouble; and converse with me being dead, without feare.
There is no great difference between good daies, & evill, when past; yet if thus fortified by the Advice of a Father, no lesse then the Prayers of an incom∣parable

indulgent Mother, you should breake out into Extravagancies, presuming on the Opinion of your owne Iudgment, and the mediation of our Love, (Though it would be the severest curse remaining in the custody of Fortune, yet unlayed upon mee:) I doubt not, but to receive more comfort, from a Patience able to beare it, then you shall from a Repen∣tance sufficient to blot it out.
But it is neither Delight in me, nor Charity unto you, by Iealousy to antedate Crimes

never yet commited; I desire you therefore to take these Ad∣monitions, as markes to sayle by, not for presages of Shipwrack.
For any faults escaped here, through hast, or other infirmity, I hope your Love will be large enough to cover them, not expo∣sing, out of Ostentation or Idle∣nesse, your Fathers Shame: whereby, not only what is perfect may prove usefull, but the very mistakes and blots obtaine as great a designe, by exercising your wit and industry in their Emendation; which I expect you should faithfully performe in relation to These, or any thing

else you find, may traduce the Credit or staine the Memory of
