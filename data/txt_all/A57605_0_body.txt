ACcording to my Duty, I am emboldened to put your Majesty in mind, that about Fifteen Years past, I presented you a Book of such Extraordinary Importance, for the Honour and Profit of your Majesty and Posterity; and doubting that it hath been laid aside and not consider'd of, I am Encourag'd (under your Majesties Pardon) to present unto you one more, consisting of Five Propositions: Neither are they ground∣ed upon vain or idle Grounds, but upon the Fruition of those wonderful Blessings wherewith God hath endued Your Majesty's Sea and Land, by which means, you may not only enrich and fill your Coffers, but also encrease such Might and Strength (as shall appear, if it may stand with your Majesties good liking to put the same in Exe∣cution in the true and right Form:) So that there is no doubt but it will make you in short time a Prince of such Power, and so Great, as shall make all the Princes your Neighbours, as well glad of your Friendship, as fearful to Offend you. That this is so, I humbly desire that Your Majesty will vouchsafe to peruse this Advertise∣ment with that Care and Judgment which God hath given you.
Most humbly praying your Majesty, that whereas I presented these Five Propositions together, as in their own Natures, jointly depending one of another, and so linked together, as the Destruction of any one will be an apparent Maim and disabling to the rest; That Your Majesty would be pleased that they may not be separated, but all handled together jointly and severally by Commissioners, with as much speed and secrecy as can be, and made fit to be reported to Your Majesty, whereby I may be the better able to perform to Your Majesty that which I have promised and will perform upon my Life, if I be not prevented by some that may seek to hinder the Honour and Profit of Your Majesty, for their own private Ends.
The true Ground, Course and Form herein mentioned, shall make appear how other Coun∣tries make themselves Powerful and Rich in all kinds, by Merchandize, Manufactory, and fulness of Trade, having no Commodities in their own Country growing to do it withal. And herein likewise shall appear how easie 'tis to draw the Wealth and Strength of other Countries to your Kingdom, and what Royal, Rich, and plentiful Means God hath given this Land to do it (which cannot be denied) for support of Traf∣fick and Continual Employment of your People, for Replenishing of your Majesties Cof∣fers: And if I were not fully assur'd to Improve your Native Commodities, with other Traffick, Three Millions of Pounds more Yearly than now they are, and to bring not only to your Majesties Coffers within the space of two or three Years, near Two Mil∣lions of Pounds, but to encrease your Revenues many Thousands Yearly, and to please and greatly profit your People, I would not have undertaken so great a Work; All which will grow by Advancement of all kind of Merchandizing to the uttermost, there∣by to bring Manufactory into the Kingdom, and to set on Work all sorts of People in the Realm, as other Nations do, which raise their Greatness by abundance of Your Native Commodities, whilst we are Parling and Disputing whether it be good for us, or not.
