Most Noble, Ingenious, Learned, and Industri∣ous Students.
BE not offended, that I dedicate to you this weak and infirm work of mine; for though it be not an offering worthy your acceptance, yet it is as much as I can pre∣sent for this time; and I wish from my Soul, I might be so happy as to have some means or ways to express my Gra∣titude for your Magnificent favours to me, having done me more honour then ever I could expect, or give sufficient thanks for: But your Generosity is above all Gratitude, and your Favours above all Merit, like as your Learning is above Contradiction: And I pray God your University may flourish to the end of the World, for the Service of the Church, the Truth of Religion, the Salvation of Souls, the Instruction of Youth, the preservation of Health,

and prolonging of Life, and for the increase of profitable Arts and Sciences: so as your several studies may be, like several Magistrates, united for the good and benefit of the whole Common-wealth, nay, the whole World. May Heaven prosper you, the World magnifie you, and Eter∣nity record your fame; Which are the hearty wishes and prayers of,
