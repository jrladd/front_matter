Yet herein hath writing the ods of Speech; in that by it wee may speake as well to the absent as to the present; by it men restrained by sicknesse, weaknesse; or otherwise from publike imploy∣ment, yet may notwithstanding much profit the publike, and sitting themselves still at home, benefit others abroad; yea by it, not theSola res est quae homines absentes praesentes facit.

Being therefore moved by some that heard of
 it, and the matter delivered in it, but could not bee present at the deliverie of it, to make this weake discourse, by helpe of Pen and Presse, more publike, as dealing in an Ar∣gument not unfitting the present times, and such as they desired to bee more fully either instructed or directed in, which by meanes thereof they supposed that both themselves and many other might bee; I was the rather induced to condescend to this their desire, that by presenting of it to your Lordship, the prime Member of that grave and reve∣rend Societie, where it was by word of mouth delivered: I might give some poore pledge and testimonie of my due and deserved re∣spect to your Honour, and of my thankefull acknowledgement of such favours, as have from time to time, by your Lordship beene shewed mee, as well during the time of mine employment at Lincolnes-Inne, (where your Lordship was one of the first whom I recei∣ved kinde acceptance from, being Reader at the time of my first accesse thither,) as since also. Having therefore during my late re∣straint by some infirmitie and weaknesse that constrained me to keep home, and to intermit my publike imployment, taken some time to re∣view, supplie, and enlarge my former Medi∣tations of the Subject then handled, (which I could not so well finde time for before) I make bold to tender them here (such as they
 are) unto your Lordship, and intreating on∣ly your courteous acceptance of them, with∣out further troubling your Honour amids so many weightier affaires, commit both your selfe and them to the gratious protection and holy direction of the Highest.
