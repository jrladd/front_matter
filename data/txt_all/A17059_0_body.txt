LIke as vines to the entent the bet ter to prosper and preserue their fruit to the vse & plea∣sure of man, require the staye of trees that bee stronger then themselues: Euen so it beho∣ueth them that mynde to put forth any worke to the behoof and commoditie of others, to shroude themselues vnder the fauour of some suche person, for

whose sake their doing may be the better liked and accepted of all men.
The whiche thyng thys my rude and vnpolished transla∣tion of the historye of Leonard Aretine right well perceauyng, at such tyme as being fully fini∣shed & ended it was nowe rea∣die to set fote out of dores and to commit it selfe to the wyde world, beholding it self spoyled of hys Romayne garment and turned into a playne Englyshe cote, beganne to be somwhat a∣basshed and to loke about hym for some fauourable patrone vn der whose protection it myght aduenture to goe abrode. But to whō rather ought it to pre∣sent it selfe then to hym vnder

whose roofe it hath beene har∣broughed and fostered frō the infancie, vntyll suche tyme as it came to his full grouth. And therefore although the wante of fyne pennyng and eloquent indityng of the hystorye in our language, enforce me to con∣fesse it vnworthye to trouble your honour beyng otherwyse busyed in moste weyghtye af∣fayres of thys Realme: ye not wythstandyng partly in cō∣syderation of my dutye, but more vppon confydence of your clemencye, I haue taken bold∣nesse to dedicate the same vnto you: so muche the rather, in asmuche as the worke entrea teth of serious and weyghtye matters.
Wherein if it mai please your ho nour so to accepte my doing, as that this my symple Translati on maye vnder your fauourable protectiō be bold to shewe it self abrode, I shall not only thinke my trauell abundauntly recom∣penced, but also accompt it for a further encouagemente, to geue the aduenture vpon some greater matter hereafter. Fini∣shed at your house in y• Strnd the second of Aprill. 1563.
