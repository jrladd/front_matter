May it please your Ladyship,
SO usual is the Custom of Dedicating Books of this nature to Persons of pi∣ and vertuous Inclinations, that we

very rarely find any venture in to the World without it.
The Just and deserved Fam of your Ladiships unparallel'd and Exemplary Piety, and your having embraced the Power as well as the Form of Godliness, (whilest most in this wicked and profligate Age not only content themselves with the Form, but take a Liberty to be licentious and prophane) toge∣ther with your Ladyships ha∣ving upon all occasions mani∣fested an Extraordinary Zeal and forwardness for the encou∣raging any thing that tends to∣wards the promoting of Piety and Religion; is all the Apology

I shall make for presuming to ay this small Treatise at your Ladyships feet.
The Substance of these Dis∣courses, were Sermons preached by my Father (now in his Grave) upon several Funeral Occasions, and never intended by him for the Press, but having perused them since his Death, and find∣ing them more suitable and per∣tinent for a Funeral Gift (for which they are chiefly intended) than any Book yet extant in so small a Tract: I do therefore humbly implore your Ladiships favour and Protection to them; ssuring my self, that if they hall find Acceptance with your

Ladyship, and have the Honou of your approbation, it will ve¦ry much influence and facilitat their passage into the World, t which I hope▪ they will be ve¦ry useful: For certainly there can be nothing more proper than the frequent and serious reading such Discourses as these when most are so apt to banish from them the thoughts of their Dying Hour, notwithstanding the many Objects of Mortality that are daily represented to their view, and their frequent Invitation to the House of Weeping.

MADAM,
Here in this small Book (pro∣perly

styled the House of Weeping for its suitableness for a Funeral Present) is fully and impartially related,
1. The Certainty of a Dying Hour; and how suddenly it may come, we know not: for this Evening Sun may see us dead, and its Morning Rays may light us to be buried in that cold Earth which now most so negligently tread upon: And that indefatigable Harbinger the Sun (whose constituted place is to Irradiate the lower World) is gone out early this Morning on its winged speed, to score us out the Lodging of a Tomb:

for so many Minutes that are since its setting out this Day, so many Minutes are as so many points deducted from our Life; and so short a Date hath every Mor∣tal Frame, that before Heavens nimble Traveller hath run Ten or Twelve Millions of Leagues, (his daily task) our forward Sands may have posted us to the Hour of Death.
2. The Frailty of the Life of Man: under which Discourse is shewn the shortness of Humane Life; and here under this Head, the Life of Man is compared to a Run∣ning Hour, to a fine Summers Day, Posting to the Night of Death,

and Vanishing away; to a Fly∣ing Cloud; to a perishing Breath, to a Sweet (but Fading) Flower, to a Blooming Spring (which oft Deaths frost Nips in its Sweetest Prime) hasting to a withering Autumn.
3. That the Grave is Mans last Home: under which Sermon those are Reproved, who Live as though they had Imbibed (as an Article of their Faith) one of those ab∣surd and destructive Principles, that all Men come into the World by Accident and Chance, and are to Live in it for ever, and that to no other end, than to Pamper the Flesh, and In∣dulge

their sensual Appetites with all manner of carnal delights and pleasures. Here is likewise shown, that when the black At∣tire of our Funeral is over, and our surviving Friends returned again to their own houses and homes, (after passionately follow∣ing our Hearse to the Grave) we shall be lodged in a State uncapable of Alteration for ever; and likewise what care we ought to take upon that Consideration, to secure our Everlasting welfare in the other World. Here is likewise shown how poorly and meanly Clad we must enter into our Coffins, and how that a Winding-sheet and one poor Shrowd,

is all our Weeping Friends can bestow upon us, when they take of us▪ their last Adieu. And here those are seasonably Repro∣ved, who spend their precious Time (one Sand of which is worth ten Thousand Worlds) in haughty Deckings, in over Cu∣rious Trimmings, when suddain∣ly their Pampered Bodyes may be Sacrificed to the gaping Grave, and be made a Feast for Worms; nay, and if not Strewed with fragrant Flowers (before their very Interment) may become a sight enough to nauseate the Spectators.
4. That there is no Returning

from the Grave: under which Discourse is shown, that when once we are carried (upon the Shoulders of Weeping Friends) to our long Homes, that then there is no Returning again for us, to Live with them upon Earth, but must there rot under ground, till the bright Morning Day of the Resurrection▪
5. That it is the Duty of all to prepare for their last Change: under which Sermon are reproved those who Repent not of sin, till they are deprived of a Power to com∣mit it; who Live as if their Souls were not Immortal, but did dye with their Bodies, and

were not obliged to appear at any Tribunal, to render an ac∣count of any thing done in this Life; who live as if there were no such thing as Hell or Heaven, Re∣wards for Vertues, or Punishments for Vices in the other Life; who Live as if the Brutal and momen∣tary Pleasures of this present world were more sweet and plea∣sant, and to be chosen before those Eternal Rivers of Pleasures that run at Gods right hand for evermore; who Live as if Repentance were not necessary for Pardon, or as those who care not whether they are Sav'd or Damn'd when they Depart this Life.
6. That all, both Good and Bad, must arise to Judgment: under which Sermon is shown, that all men (when the last Trump shall sound at the end of the World) must make their Ap∣pearance (to receive their Last Doom,) before that Judge, whose Sentence they cannot Reverse, whose Wisdom they cannot de∣ceive, whose Equity they cannot bow, whose Severity they can∣not withstand, whose Indignati∣on they cannot Appease, whose Determination they cannot alter, and from whose Presence they cannot fly.
7. That there will be a glori∣ous Resurrection for them that sleep in Jesus: under which Discourse is shown, that at the last day, those who were Heirs of Glory, shall arise out of their Graves, to shine as so many Resplendent Suns in the Empirean Heavens, to Chaunt forth Eternal Hallelujahs in that upper World; where they shall be ever Guarded with the Noble and Innumerable Train of Angels, where they shall ever have the Honourable Society of Patriarchs and Apostles, where they shall ever have the whole Army of Triumphant Martyrs, and a thousand times ten Thou∣sand

times ten Thousand bles∣sed Saints for their Glorious At∣tendants, with whom they shall be to Eternity Happy in a Tran∣scendent manner, above Expressi∣on, above Conception.
8. Eightly and Lastly, In this small Treatise is faithfully related, what is the Swan-like Note of a Dy∣ing Christian; (being my Fathers last Sermon, &c.) under which Discourse is shown, that one Glance of Heaven, one Grape of Canaan, one Glympse of the Crown of Glory, is that which is able to set a Gloss upon the Face of Death, and to make it really Lovely in the Eyes of an Expi∣ring

Saint, filling him with so much Joy, that he can chear∣fully Smile at the Thoughts of the near Approaches of Death, and Triumph at the sight of a Tomb, Death being more Wel∣come to him, than a joyful Trum∣pet sounding out to a glorious Jubilee.


MADAM,
Now if this Weeping House may be any wayes useful to your Ladyship or any Other, I shall have attained my chief and principal end of its Publicati∣on; and with comfortable Hopes that it may, I Humbly beg the Honour to Subscribe (assuring my

self and all the World, that when the Dismal Ewe-tree and flattering Ivy shall grow about your Mourn∣ful Grave, that the longest Date of Time shall not be able to Puffe away the sweet Remem∣brance of your Vertuous Deeds, but that afterwards to the end of the World your Honourable Name shall be a Rival with Time, for the Victory of Per∣petuity;)
MADAM,
