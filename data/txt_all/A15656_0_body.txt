NOble Friends: you whose vertues made me first in loue with Vertue: and whose worths, made mee be thought worthy of your loues. I haue now at last (you see) by Gods

assistance and your encouragement, runne through the Prgatory of imprisonment: and by the worthy fauour of a iust PRINCE, stand free againe, without the leat touch of deiected base∣nesse. Seeing therefore I was growne beyond my Hope so fortunate, (after acknowledgement of my Creators loue, together with the vnequall'd Clemency of so gracious a Soueraigne) I was trou∣bled to thinke by what meanes I might expresse my thankfulnesse to so many well-deseruing friends: No way I found to my desire; neyther yet abilitie to performe when I found it. But at length conside∣ring with my selfe what you were, (that is) such, who fauour honestie for no second reason but be∣cause you your selues are good; and ayme at no other

reward but the witnesse of a sound conscience that you doe well, I found that thankfulnesse would proue the acceptablest present to sute with your dispositions; and that I imagined could be no way better expressed then in manifesting your cour∣tesies, and giuing consent to your reasonable de∣mands. For the first, I confesse (with thankes to the disposer of all things, and a true gratefll heart towards you,) so many were the vn∣expected visitations and vnhoped kindnesses re∣ceiued both from some among you of my Ac∣quaintance, and many other vnknowne Well∣illers of my Cause, that I was perswaded to entertaine a much better conceit of the Time then I lately conceiued, and assured my selfe that

VERTVE had farre more followers then I sup∣posed.
Somewhat it disturbed mee to behold our ages Fauourites, whilst they frowned on my honest en∣terprises, to take vnto their protections the egre∣giousts fopperics: yet much more was my content∣mnt, in that I was respected by so many of You, amongst whom there are some, who can and may as much dis-esteeme these, as they neglect me: nor could I feare their malice or contempt, whilst I enioyed your fauours, who (howso∣euer you are vnder-valued by fooles for a time) shall leaue vnto your postritie so noble a me∣mory, that your names shall be reuerenced by Kings, when many of these who now flourish with

a shew of vsurped Greatnesse, shall eyther weare out of beeing, or dispoyled of all their patched re∣putation, grow contemptible in the eyes of their beloued Mistresse the World. Your Loue. is is that (enabling mee with patience to endure what is already past) hath made mee (also) carefull better to prepare my selfe for all fu∣ture misaduentures, by bringing to my considera∣tion, what the passion, of my iust discontentments had almost quite banished from my remem∣brance.
Further, to declare my thankefulnesse, in making apprant my willing minde to be commanded in any seruices of loue, which you shall thinke fit (though I want abilitie to performe great mat∣ters)













yet I haue according to some of your requests beene contented to giue way to the printing of these Eglogues, which thoug it to many seeme a sleight matter, yet being well considered of, may proue a strong argument of my readinesse to gie you content in a greater matter: for they being (as you well knw) begotten with little care, and preserued with lesse respect, gaue suffici∣ent eidence that I meant (rather then any way to deceiue your trust) to giue the world oc∣casion of calling my discretion in question, as I now assure my selfe This will: and the sooner, be∣cause such expectations (I perceiue) there are of I know not what Inuentions, as would haue beene frustrated though I had employed

the vtmost and very best of my endeuours.
Notwithstanding, for your sakes, I haue here ad∣uentured once againe to make tryall of the wrlds censures: and what hath receiued beeing, from your Loues, I here rededicated to your Worths, which if your noble dispositions will like well of: Or if you will but reasonaby respect what your selues drew mee vnto, I shall be nothing displea∣sed at others cauils, but resting my selfe contented with your good opinions, scorne all the rabble of vncharitable detractors: For none I know will maligne it except those, who eyther particularly malice my person, or professe thmselues enemies to my former Bookes; who (sauing those that were incensed on others speeches) as diuers of you (ac∣cording

to your protestations) haue obserued, are eyther open enemies of our Church; men notori∣ously guilty of some particular Abuses therein txt, such malicious Crittickes who haue the repute of being indicious, by detracting from others; or at best such Guls, as neuer approue any thing good, or learned, but eyther that which their shallow ap∣prehensions can apply to the soothing of their owne opinions, or what (indeede rather) they vnder∣stand not.
Trust me, how ill soeuer it hath beene rewarded, my loue to my Country is inviolate: my thanke∣fulnesse to you vnfayned, my endeuour to doe eue∣ry man good; all my ayme content with honestie: and this my paines (if it may be so tearmed) more

to auoid idlenes, then for affectation of praise: an if notwithstanding all thir, I must yet, not onel rest my selfe content that my innocency hath esc ped with strict imprisonment (to the impayring  my state, and hinderance of my fortunes) but al be constrayned to see my guiltlesse lines, suffer th despight of ill tongues: yet for my further enco ragement, let mee entreat the continuance  your first respect, wherein I shall finde that com fort as will be sufficient to make mee set light an so much contemne all the malice of my aduersaries that ready to burst with the venome of their own hearts, they shall see

My Minde enamoured on faire Vertues light
Ascends the limits of their bleared sight,
And plac'd aboue their Enuy, doth contemne,
Nay, sit and laugh at their disdaine and them.

But Noble Friends, I make question neyther of yours, nor any honest mans respect, and there∣fore will no further vrge it, nor trouble your pati∣ence: onely this Ile say, that you may not thinke e too well conceited of my selfe; though the Time ere to blame in ill requiting my honest endea∣ours, which in the eyes of the world deserued etter, et somewhat I am assured there was in ee worthy that punishment which when God shall iue mee grace to see and amend, I doubt not but o finde that regard as will be fitting for so much erit as my labours may iustly challenge. Meane

while, the better to hold my selfe in esteeme with you, and amend the worlds opinion of Vertue, I will study to amend my selfe, that I may be yet more worthy to be called
