RIght Honorable there be two things, which make any great house truely Noble, Loue to God, Loyaltie to Prince, with the former, this great noble house of KENT is now inuested: in the latter it euer continued ne∣ner tainted; in both a succession hopefull still expected. Religion (which is better then that lot of inheritance, giuen by Iacob to his sonne Ioseph) hath in your Lord∣ship bin so long a Resident, that any good man, euen by popular report, might present an Orphāt in hope of succour: much more my selfe who know so well, am so
much bounden, and can so true∣ly speake that of you which the Spirit did of the Church of Theatyra; I know thy Loue, and Seruice, and Faith, and thy Patience, and thy Workes, and that they are moe at the last then at the first. I haue here exposed myne Infant, (a formelesse Embrion) to the mercie of the Presse, and the Pa∣rent to the mercilesnesse of cen∣sure; the poore abortiue resem∣bling Alcibyades childe, of whom the querulous mother made com∣plaint, That Nature begunne it, but did not compleatly finish it: shrow∣ding both vnder your worthy Patronage, as an Aiax buckler for defence. All is done in benefit of the Church wherein I liue, in to∣ken of dutie to your person, whō I honour: to satisfie my friends whom I loue, and to content any good man, whom I like. Thus de∣siring
the happinesse of Heauen and Earth, to attend your soule and body. I beseech him who made all, to adde much honour to your dayes, and many daies to your honourable life: In hope whereof, I take my humble leaue, and rest,
