MY LORD,
WHile Your Lordship
fits Your Self, in
Your Travels, to follow the

Footsteps of so many glo∣rious
Ancestors, I prepare
for You, in the Culture of
Fruits, a Diversion to those
great Occupations, which
Your Birth will hereafter
bring upon Your Lordship.
I was walking with Your
Lordship, when I first
thought of this Way, to
make our Gardens yield
better Fruits. Besides, My
Lord, I cannot forget what
other Titles you have, to
look upon this as a dome∣stick
Production.

I shall think my self hap∣py,
if I can add something
to the Innocent Pleasures
of many Nations; especi∣ally
this; for which, as well
as most of the Neighbour∣ing
Countries, what I have
to propose seems to be of
most Use.
However, My Lord, I
shall be satisfied, if, by thus
indeavouring to become
useful to Your Lordship, I
express my most sincere
Gratitude, for all the Obli∣gations

I have to Your Il∣lustrious
Family.
I am with all manner of
Respect,
My LORD,
