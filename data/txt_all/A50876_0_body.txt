Madam,
THE honest Plainness, and Truth of the following Discourse found such acceptance with the Relations and Friends, of that Excel∣lent Person, whose immature and much lamented Death, was the sad Occasion of it, That They have prevail'd with me to make it more publick, than I at first intended: Believing it would be as acceptable to your Ladyship in the Reading, as it was to them, when they heard it. I was the more willing to comply with their Desire, not only that it might be a publick acknowledment, of my geat Obligation to Your Family, and to Your Ladyship in particular, for Your many great and lasting Favours towards me, but because I am sensible the Subject is such, as will recommend it to Your Favour. Your Ladyship was a Witness, and a Lover of the many great Vertues of Your Dear and Excellent Friend. Her affectionate

care and concern for Your Good, the Sincerity of her Friendship, the Piety and Prudence of her Counsels, the great Ʋsefulness and Advantage of her Example, at such a time, when you stood most in need of it, by the otherwise irreparable loss, of Your truly Pious, and most tenderly Affectio∣nate Mother, had deservedly endear'd her to You: and I perswade my self, just Allowances being made, for the difference of Your respective Condi∣tion and Circumstances, You will always imitate, whatsoever was Excellent, Amiable, and Praise∣worthy in Her. This will recommend You to the esteem of such as are Wise and Good: Hereby You will be an Ornament to Your Own Family, and add a Lustre to That, into which, by the success∣ful Care, and Endeavours of Your Dear deceased Friend, You are so happily transplanted. If what I now offer, may contribute any thing towards so great and good an End, it will be the greatest accession, to all the other Favours You have shewn to,
Madam,
