and feareing God, so shall prosperity bee to you, (maugure the power, malice, and treachery of for∣raigne Enemies or home borne slaues: which may be feared, for reasons which to some of your Com∣pany I haue discouered, but now silence:) yet easily defeated, by wise, religious, and carefull Officers: and this will bee your wisedome: such wisedome crowne all your affaires, so shall Barmodus be still tru∣ly stiled Summer-Ilands, pleasant and fruitfull to our Nation.
