May it please your Lordship,
THE Great Devotion wherewith your Lordship indefatigably seeks to promote Works of Piety, Loyalty, and Charity, and especially the high veneration that you have for every little thing that concerns the Ho∣nour of the ROYAL MARTYR, hath given me the presumption of this Dedication.
Finding among some neglected Papers such Pie∣ces as seemed to retain (though but an obscure) Character of the , I carefully collected and composed them in this little Tablet. And though I well know that your Lordship hath a far more per∣fect Idea of that Best of Kings engraven on your heart; yet perceiving that this made a good im∣pression on a Loyal Audience at the first view, I have presumed to make it more publick under your Lordships Name, which gives a value and lustre to such things as in themselves are but of little worth: hoping that by this Recommendation of it, it may prove as an Amulet to confirm some in their Loyal∣ty, and shame and convince others of their Disloy∣alty, by manifesting to all, the incomparable Graces
of that Man of God, and the unparallel'd Barbari∣ty of those Sons of Belial, the Ignoramus's and Ig∣natians that were Actors in that Tragedy; some of which still survive, and like the Devil himself, seek to draw others into the like Conspiracies and Con∣demnation with themselves, and by another fatal Blow to deprive us of all those Blessings Spiritual and Temporal which by Gods wonderful Providence and Mercy we yet enjoy, and to reduce us to our for∣mer Distractions and Confusions.
Nor is it your Lorships publick Merit and Repu∣tation onely, but a particular and signal Favour to my self, which (though forgotten by your self, shall be ever thankfully commemorated by me) hath o∣bliged me to this confident Address. For in truth, I have been uneasie and displeased with my self, that I found no sooner opportunity, nor as yet a bet∣ter demonstration, of my Gratitude, and to let the World know what freedom of Access, what can∣dor of Countenance, and endearing Affability, Counsel, and Assistance, the meanest Clergy-man may hope for from so noble and munificent a Spi∣rit. In testimony whereof, I have done my self the right, with your Lorships favour, to subscribe my self
Exon, Feb. 12. 1683.
