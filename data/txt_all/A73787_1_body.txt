Right Honourable, Honourable, and truly Worthy,
YOu (who haue, in an aspectuall, either Trine or Sextile, radiation, vouch∣safed Your auspici∣ous influences, and some directly, other collaterally, all of you fa∣uourably
beheld me; mitigated with your gentler aspects the malice of my opposite Planets, in this inferi∣our Orbe; hindered by Your be∣neuolent powers the maleuo∣lent motions of some irregular Starres in our earthly Globe; and in processe of time, the reuolution of heauen so bringing it about, as your seuerall places and my seuerall pro∣ceedings required, met almost in the same degree, though carried in your distant Spheres, to the clayming, through your concurrences, of the denomination of a Coniunction for my good) may as iustly as ioynt∣ly, & as ioyntly as iustly, both iustly and ioyntly, challenge the publicati∣on of those effects which your worths out of good will produced, and my weakenesse in way of gratefulnesse,
was, is, or shall be, enabled to make knowne.
To you therefore doe I dedi∣cate this first BRANCH OF my GRAFT OF GRA∣TITƲDE, which hitherto hath not appeared, lacking the life-giuing Rayes of one or other Lu∣minary; yet now at last through a happier constellation, buds and begins to blossome in open view vn∣der your Patronages; whose beames of kinde acceptance, if I shall per∣ceiue, Sunne-like to reflexe vpon it, I shall be animated to gather toge∣ther those Siens which lie dispersed in my nurserie; to adapt and in sea∣sonable time to inoculate them in∣to one Stocke; to digge about the root of this GRAFT; and so to prune euery BRANCH
of it, that it may answer the aime of my now attempt, in yeelding some fruit wherewith the Lords name, the Author of all grace, may be magnified; Your names, who are and haue beene the instruments of much good, as with LAW∣RELL were honoured the heads of the well-deseruing, with condigne fame according to your deserts, for patterne sake, an end of my present endeuours, diuulged; mine owne thankefulnesse, who haue bin in some sort the passiue subiect of aduerse might, obiect of affected malice, to God and man, the instant wishing of my soule, expressed; the meanest of the Tribe of Leui (in their pla∣ces, rights, persons, disesteemed, wronged, contemned, so much as ei∣ther Hypocrisie, irreligion, error, or
superstition can preuaile) notwith∣standing all iniurious disgraces, and disgracefull iniuries, in our heauen-respected calling, as my heart hopeth, incouraged; and all men lesse or more, which the Lord now and al∣way vouchsafe, some way bettered. Till when and euer, that your LOƲE and FEARE may so be fixed vpon the Lords MER∣CIE and JƲSTICE (the onely blossomes which as yet this BRANCH doth beare) and all your affections so ordered and so disposed by God himselfe to good∣nesse, that you neuer, either want the sensible feeling of sauing Grace, or goe without the full fruition of eternall Glory, hee praieth who is till death,
