BEfore you read so farre as the Prologue, be pleased to consider this Tragi-comedy was both written and presented above eigh∣teen years since; and if now it seem (in
Language or Plot) to fit these times, it must be by Prophesie, the Author also himselfe having been long dead. He wrote it at the instance of those who might command him; else he had scarce conde∣scended to a Play, his serious thoughts being fill'd with notions of deeper consideration. 'Tis sufficient for its worth that the best lik'd it best; the rest (espe∣cially those great ones of the weaker Sect) should claim no lawful Judicature over it, since it was not written for them, though they thought themselves too severely dealt with, which yet was an injury to the
Author as well as his Poem. Were this translated in∣to
Latin or Italian, it would be grateful to foraign
Wits; and if at home it finde lesse welcome, 'tis be∣cause there is not so much true wit among us as was or ought to be. It is not now inscribed to any for
Protection, but left dedicated (as it was by the Au∣thor when it was first born) to the Authors noble Pa∣tron.
If you bid this welcome, you'l be gainers by it; for then you'l encourage us to publish other Pieces of this Authors, which (we dare say) will convince you to say (what the best and most knowing of this Na∣tion have confessed) that our Author was one of the
 judicious wits of England. Farewell.
