SIR,
THose endearing ex∣pressions, which I, beyond my merit or expecta∣tion, received heretofore from my worthy friend, your indulgent Father; and those other due respects which I

owe unto that Name and Family whereof I am a branch, ingage me to pre∣fixe your Name in the Fron∣tispiece of this little work. I dare confidently put the same into your hands as a solid piece, and deserving your regard. And albeit I am neither ambitious of ho∣nour, nor fearfull of censure, yet I desire you to give it protection; who notwith∣standing you have a diffe∣rent sense from me in points of Religion; yet I

hope you are not so estran∣ged, but that you dare ac∣cept a book, presented by a kinsman, who is moreover, dear Sir,

From my chamber this day of the memoriall of our Lords Passion, 1655.
