Honoured Sir,
THough at first it was free, and in my choice, whether or no I should publish these Discourses, yet the Publication being once Resolved, the Dedi∣cation was not so indifferent; the Nature of the Subject, no less than the Obligations of the Author, styling them in a peculiar manner, Yours: For since their drift is to carry the most Endangered, and Endangering Truth, a∣bove the Safest, when sinfull, Interest; as a Practice upon grounds of Reason the most Generous, and of Christianity the most Religi∣ous; to whom rather should this Assertion re∣pair as to a Patron, than to Him whom it has for an instance? Who in a case of emi∣nent competition, chose Duty before Interest;

and when the Iudge grew inconsistent with the Iustice, preferred rather to be Constant to sure Principles, than to an Un-con∣stant Government: And to retreat to an Innocent and Honorable privacy, than to sit and Act iniquity by a Law; and make your Age and Conscience, (the one Venerable, the other Sacred) Drudges to the tyranny of Fa∣natick, Perjured Usurpers. The next attempt of this Discourse is a Defence of the Mini∣stery, and that, at such a time when none owned them upon the Bench, (for then you had quit∣ted it) but when on the contrary we lived to hear one in the very face of the University, (as it were in defiance of us and our Profes∣sion) openly in his Charge, defend the Quakers and Fanaticks, persons not fit to be nam'd in such Courts, but in an Indictment. But, Sir, in the Instructions I here presumed to give to others, concerning what they should do, you may take a narrative of what you have done: what respected their Actions as a Rule or Admonition, applyed to yours is only a Rehearsal, whose Zeal in asserting the Mi∣nisterial

Cause is so generally known, so grate∣fully acknowledged, that I dare affirm, that, in what I deliver, you read the words indeed of One, but the Thanks of All. Which af∣fectionate Concernment of yours for them, seems to argue a Spiritual sense, and experimen∣tal Tast of their Works, and that you have reaped as much from their Labours, as others have done from their Lands: For to me it seemed always strange, and next to impossible, that a man, converted by the word Preached, should ever hate and persecute a Preacher. And since you have several times in discourse declared your self for that Government in the Church, which is founded upon Scripture, Reason, Apostolical Practice and Antiquity, and (we are sure) the onely one that can consist with the Present Government of State, I thought the latter Discourse also might fitly address it self to you, in the which you may read your Iudgment, as in the other your Pra∣ctice. And now, since it has pleased Provi∣dence, at length to turn our Captivity, and answer persecuted Patience with the unex∣pected

returns of Settlement; to remove our Rulers, and restore our Ruler; and not one∣ly to make our Exactors Righteousness, but, what is better, to give us Righteousness in∣stead of Exaction, and hopes of Religion to a Church worried with reformation; I believe, upon a due and impartial Reflexion on what is past, you now find no cause to Repent, that you never dipt your hands in the Bloody High Courts of Justice, properly so called only by Antiphrasis; nor ever prostituted the Scarlet Robe to those Employments, in which you must have worn the Colour of your Sin in the Badge of your Office: but, not∣withstanding all the Enticements of a Prospe∣rous Villainy, abhorred the purchase, when the price was Blood. So that now being privileged by an happy Unconcernment in those legal murders, you may take a sweeter relish of your own Innocence, by beholding the misery of others Guilt, who being Guilty be∣fore God, and infamous before men, Obnoxi∣ous to both, begin to find the first-fruits of their sin in the Universal scorn of all,

their apparent Danger, and unlikely Remedy: which beginnings being at length consum∣mated by the hand of Iustice, the cry of Blood and Sacrilege will cease, men's doubts will be Satisfied, and Providence Absolved.
And thus, Sir, having presumed to ho∣nour my first Essayes in Divinity, by pre∣fixing to them a Name, to which Divines are so much obliged; I should here in the close of this Address, contribute a Wish at least to your Happiness: But since we de∣sire it not yet in another World, and your Enjoyments in this (according to the Stan∣dard of a Christian desire) are so compleat, that they require no Addition; I shall turn my Wishes into Gratulations, and congra∣tulating their fullness only wish their con∣tinuance: Praying that you may still Pos∣sess what you Possess; and Doe what you Doe; that is, reflect upon a clear, unblot∣ted, acquitting Conscience, and feed upon the ineffable Comforts of the Memorial of a Conquered temptation; without the dan∣ger

of returning to the Tryal. And this (Sir) I account the greatest felicity that you can enjoy, and therefore the greatest that he can desire, who is
