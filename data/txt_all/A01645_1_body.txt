THe earth is watered with drops from above, and in vapours sends them up again: The rivers come from the sea, and flow back again: The aire will cleave the rock to get up to its place again: The fire came down from heaven, and thither it tends up again. From the mixture of these elements, all bodies have their temperaments: Those have in them a character of naturall gra∣titude, and these should follow them. This character an illiterate man may see in creatures without sense; and he that is learned may reade to the life in creatures that have sense. Man is the Epitome of all perfections in other creatures: But without this character he is like to

none of them. He hath spent his time ill at the Vniversitie that de∣nies the first principles, and he would be sent back again to learn the first elements. In the soul of man, as Galen saith, there is an art of arts, and in the bodie of man an instrument of instruments: Rea∣son is the art, and the hand is the instrument: I have both, and both are the Lady COPPENS. I have reason to acknowledge it, and an hand to subscribe to it.
