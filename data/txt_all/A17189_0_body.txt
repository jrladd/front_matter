REuerende Fathers, Honorable, & dearely be∣loued brethren. The Lord Iesus blesse you, and kepe you from al euil. We send you the copie of our writing concerning the mater of Apparell, sent by vs to N. & M. men learned and godly, our worship∣ful brethren. And therfore send we it vn∣to you, that ye maye vnderstande, howe that we deale not priuately with your brethrē, without the knowledge of you, which are the principall Ministers, and that we to the vttermost of our powers doe séeke the peace and quietnesse of your Churches in all things. And we praye the Lord alwayes to saue the state there, and kéepe you in concorde. We also ex∣horte you our right Reuerende, and dea∣rest
 brethren, to haue good regarde vnto faythfull Ministers, and learned men: for such also commonly haue their affec∣tions. Wherfore the Apostle also war∣ned men to beare one an others burthen. Ye by your authority may do much with the most excellēt Princesse your Quene, entreate ye hir Maiestie, that the good brethren may be reconciled and restored. And we praye you honorable, and deare brother M. Horne to whome these letters may be first deliuered, that ye will cause them forthwith to be caryed to the By∣shop of Norwich, and so communicate them with M. Iewell, M. Sandes, and M. Pilkington, to whom by Gods grace I meane to write the nexte Frankford mart. These letters I wrote in all haste aswell in myne owne as in Gualters name, and sent them to Basile, thence to be conueighed to Andwerpe. We praye you hartily to signifie whether ye haue receiued them. Fare ye wel right Reue∣rend. The Lord blesse you & your labors.
At Zurich the thirde of Maij. 1566.
