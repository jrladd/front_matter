Deare Brothers,
IN you I have enjoyed the happy freedoms and privileges of friendship which consociate the re∣motest regions of mens hearts with the partici∣pation of their mutuall thoughts. I communicate to you now these Concep∣tions (the Companions of my solitarinesse) that not∣withstanding
 the Presse is debaucht, yet by the quick passage of it, you might participate of my thoughts at this distance; whereby in part I might turne my Lonenesse into Companie and Conversation. And though the accidents of the time have violently snatcht you from me, whereby you have chang∣ed your freedome for re∣straint; yet all the unplea∣sing passages of Fortune, or her most plausible Court∣ships work nothing upon
 a mind, seated on that firm resolution, to be true to GOD, the King, and his friend the very Heathen could say, Commit thy self to an honest & just action, as to a tutelar God. Those minds alone that are not raised above the trifles and vanities of the world, feele the tyranny of passion and adversitie; others, who lie not levell with its injuries, carry a happinesse in their owne brests, which tents as it were, they can set down in any condition or
 place, & be happy in Saint Paul named no one state wherein he could be con∣tent; but had learned, in what state soever, to be content: & certainly, such a state of mind onely as is agreeable to the traverses of the world, considering every thing as it is in its own alterable nature, and withall making use of the prerogative of the Soule, which is above any crea∣ted thing, can fix or settle in mans life a felicitie, which all men so earnestly court,
 and so few obtaine; many presenting their service to that Mistris of all mens Soules, out of vainglory, or covetousnesse, or worldly interest; she being the most quick-sighted Lady, which will not confer her favors on any, but who are truly inamored with it self; God himself being that essential Aeternitie, who is alone to be loved for himselfe.

Questò e il vero geiore che nasce dà virtu dopò il soffrire.

From Amsterdam, Decemb. 20. 1648.
