Most Reuerend Father in God;
IT may bee thought too high a praesumption (and that not altogether vniust∣ly,) that I should seeke to shroud these my poore Labours vnder the roofe of your Gracious Patronage: which I doe not out of any confidence of the worth of them (for alasse I am too conscious to my owne wants to bee so arrogantly presumptuous) but out of the Conscience of that great obli∣gation
 wherein I stand bound vnto your Grace for your Graces manifold vndeserued fauours, whereof I humbly desire to make this publique acknowledgement. It is a ru∣led case in the Ciuill Law, mancipato Patre mancipantur & filii, the Children are inuol∣ued with their Father in the same engage∣ment: and the Fruits doe of best right ap∣pertaine to him that is owner of the Field. To whom then should this my poore Or∣phant, and these fruits of my poore Labours more rightly appereain then to your Grace; vpon whom I haue such an especiall depen∣dance in the Place where I liue, and to whom I most deseruedly owe my selfe, and the best of my poore Seruice. Moreouer the whole English Clergy (whereof I am a poore vnworthy member) and the whole Church of England, and Cause of Religion owes much vnto your Grace: whereof (vn∣der our most Religious, Learned and graci∣ous Soueraigne) you are a maine Pillar and Spporer; not onely by your vigilant eye of circumspection, in gouerning this Church (according to your high place) but by your zealous tongue in Preaching, and learned
 Pen in writing. I write not this to flatter your Grace, for (besides that my nature ab∣horres such basenesse) he needs no false and flattering praises, that abounds with true: and St. Cyprian saith truly; A good Consci∣ence neither desires praise nor feares accusa∣tions. Epist. 31. For my part, I should not haue presumed to publish to the world these my poore Labours, (which doth occa∣sion mee humbly to craue your Graces Pa∣tronage) but that in these dayes, wherein so many Babilonish Tobiahs and Sanballats, seeke by all meanes to hinder, and (if they could) to ruine it, euery true hearted Israelite that can lay but one stone to further the buil∣ding of Gods Temple, & the walls of his Ie∣rusalem, must not sit idle. Seing therefore your Grace is heerein a Maister-builder; vouchsafe (I beseech you) your gracious ap∣probation of this little Stone that I haue hewen to lay in this Building: and your Noble Patronage of me and my poore La∣bours, though the meanest of those that serue at Gods Altar: (for euen the Sunne in the Firmament shines aswell on the low Shrub as the tall Cedar, and sends his bright
 and glorious beames, aswell into the poore∣mans Cottage, as the Noble-mans Pallace) which if your Grace shall vouchsafe to doe, you shal therby encourage me (to the vtmost of my poore power and skill) to bee still hewing more Stones for this Building; and binde me euer, as already you haue done, to be a dayly Suitor, and earnest Solicitor, to the highest Throne of grace and mercy, that the confluence of all wished temporall blessings and spirituall graces, may be pow∣red downe vpon your Graces head most a∣bundantly in this Life; with the euerlasting addition of a Crowne of Glory in the Life to come.
