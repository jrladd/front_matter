HAving in our Prece∣dent Aphorisms clearly deliver'd such infallible Rules and Instructi∣ons, as are necessary for pro∣ducing our Grand Elixir, or Circulatum majus, the only real Secret of the true Adepts, commanding in all the King∣doms
of Nature, which will, we question not, be no less plea∣sing to all other lovers of Sci∣ences, than to our Disciples; and being farther inclin'd fully to inform them, how to preserve themselves and others in perfect Health by obviating any Di∣stemper, that may otherwise o∣vercome them, before they can attain to the Accomplishment of their Desires: We have thought it convenient to impart likewise to them our three several ways of making our Vegetable Elixir, or Circulatum minus, which may be prepar'd, and brought to
its utmost Perfection in the space of a Philosophical Month by any skilful Artist, who shall comprehend and follow our cer∣tain Directions, laid down in these our subsequent Apho∣risms, where the whole Work is so evidently demonstrated, that none, who is ever so little vers'd in Chymistry, can be liable to mistake. Nor do we any way doubt, but all those, who shall with a sincere and upright Intention peruse these our plain∣ly-written Aphorisms, will find themselves oblig'd to bless Al∣mighty God for his infinite Mer∣cy
in having inspir'd us to open their Eyes, that they may see, what is requisite for their pre∣sent Health, and future Happi∣ness, both which we heartily wish to every one, who, as be∣comes a true Philosopher, un∣feignedly loves God and his Neighbor.
