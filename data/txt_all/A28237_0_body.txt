It may Please Your Highness,
IN part of my acknowledgment to Your Highness, I have en∣deavoured to do Honour to the Memory of the last King of Eng∣land, that was Ancestour to the King your Father, and Your self; and was that King to whom both Unions may in a sort refer: That of the Roses being in him Con∣summate, and that of the Kingdoms by him begun. Besides, his times deserve it. For he was a Wise Man, and an Excellent King; and yet the times were rough, and full of Mutations and rare Accidents. And it is with Times, as it is with Ways. Some are

more Vp-hill and Down-hill, and some are more Flat and Plain; and the One is better for the Liver, and the Other for the Writer. I have not flattered him, but took him to life as well as I could, sitting so far off, and having no better light. It is true, Your High∣ness hath a Living Pattern, Incomparable, of the King Your Father. But it is not amiss for You also to see one of these Ancient Pieces. GOD preserve Your Highness.
