Dearly beloved in Christ,
I Am so much engaged to you, that I owe you even my owne selfe, who because I cannot al∣waies continue with you, I Dedicate to you this child of my old age to be your servant, whom if you please to entertain into your house, I hope it will do you faithfull service; for it is neither given to flat∣tering, lying, nor faction, however it may be to filching that from some, which they have taken from others, and so made up a pack for your profit that shall open it. I could offer its service to particular friends, by the complement of Dedication, if I thought it might honor them as much as their acceptation I know would honor it, or not engage them as sureties are for Apprentices, to answer for the slips of it in a captious world. I commend it therefore only to your service, and will answer (to my ability) for the faults of it my selfe; only I desire you would be pleased to accept it as a love token, though no requitall of your fa∣vours, from one disabled by the malignancy of these latter times, to shew himselfe so thankfull as he would, and hol∣deth himselfe obliged to be,
