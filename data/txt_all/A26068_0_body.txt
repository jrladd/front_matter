HAving been instru∣mental, through God's Blessing, to fix your Belief, I shall now proceed, by the same gracious assi∣stance, to direct your Pra∣ctice. And do very chear∣fully comply with an invi∣tation to so useful a Task, as being fully convinced, That it is much more pro∣fitable, both for me and
 my Parish, to spend my time in Devotion and pra∣ctical Discourses, than in these unpleasing Dis∣putes.
Now the more effectu∣ally to perswade you to a Holy and Religious Life, pray seriously consider this short Admonition.
You must not always be in this World; but in a very little time (perhaps before to Morrow-Morn∣ing) you may be removed into the next. And then you will unalterably be fixt in an Eternal State, ei¦ther of Happiness or Mi∣sery.

Now as in all other Ca∣ses prudence doth direct you to Provide for the worst, so chiefly it ought in the concern of your Souls. Wherein if you do miscar∣ry, the mistake will be ve∣ry fatal: you are utterly ruined.
Let me therefore beg of you (and I do it in Christ's stead) immedi∣ately to break off your Sins by repentance. And re∣solve without delay to make your Peace with God, before you go hence and be no more seen.

To assist you in this ne∣cessary work, is the chari∣table Design of these little Papers. Wherein I shall in the most familiar manner even lead you by the hand; and shall shew you step by step what I would have you to do. And if with an honest and sincere heart, you will observe these following Directions; I trust we shall comfortably meet at the Day of the Lord Jesus.
