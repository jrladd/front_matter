WHen I consi∣der
with my
self, who it
is that brings the im∣portunity
of this address
upon you, I cannot but
be doubtfull of the en∣tertainment
you may

affoord it, but when I
shall withall have re∣presented
unto you, that
things of this nature
have found acceptance
with all the polish'd Na∣tions,
that Tully himself
was not asham'd to ap∣pear
in this kind, & that
the Authour may well be
justified by the example
of Sir Will. Cornwallis,
Dr. Donne & Carpenter in
our own Nation; I have
the more assurance to
offer you this, and so
much the more, as I

must witness for the Au∣thour
those great senti∣nents
of honour & respect
whch a most effective &
excellent virtue, that is
to say, your own can work
upon him; besides that
you are one of the few
that even in a desperate
age inte est your self
in things noble. So
that I do my self but
right in acknowledging
my self your Honourer,
& bringing these things
into your Protection,

which if your Candor,
and usual ingenuity will
not deny me, you have
satisfied the ambition,
and wishes of
Worthy Sir,
