HAuing begunne to make these my pri∣uate Meditations publique, and sen∣ding them vnder the protection of many their best well-willers to
see the world, I should much for∣get my selfe (Worshipfull and most especiall benefactors) if I should forget your names in these my multiplied dedicatiōs. There is no man liuing who may claime that interest in mee, or challenge my very best endeuours in that measure as your selues, who may iustly say to me, as Paul did to Philemon;
Philem. 19. Thou owest vn∣to vs euen thine owne selfe. For besides that, your house hath been to me as the house of One∣siphorus was to Paul,
2. Tim. 1.16. euen this also that I my selfe haue an house to dwell in, and a pastoral charge to labour in, I may impute it vnto your selues, as principall meanes, raised vp by God, to pro∣cure it for me.
Iob 31.20. The loines of me and mine may blesse you, because by your meanes wee are cloathed
with a fleece. I haue nothing to returne vnto you for your so great paines, but these few home∣lie papers, the poore present of an euer remaining debtor; I would they were as worthie of any respect with you, as in many respects they doe belong vnto you. My soule perswadeth it selfe that you both are of the number of those,
Reuel. 6.4. who haue re∣ceiued the seale of the lion of Iu∣dah,
Galat. 6.16. that long since the world hath bin crucified vnto you, and you vnto the world, & that you haue proposed Christ Iesus to your selues the onely gaine:
Philip 1.21. I there∣fore send not vnto you this fare∣well which I haue sung vnto the world to perswade you, but ra∣ther to encourage you:
Phil. 1.6. He that hath begun a good worke in you, will performe it and encrease it
more and more:
Vers. 9. And this I pray that your loue may a∣bound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all iudge∣ment,
Vers. 10. that yee may discerne things that differ, and may be pure and without of∣fence vntil the day of Christ. Amen.
