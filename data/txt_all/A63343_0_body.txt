My LORD,
IF the Custom of a Dedication at this Time did not make it necessary, your Eminent Merits do justly lay claim to the discharge of this Duty. And though the present Impending Storm, the Dread of a Foreign Invasion, has Obnubilated the usual Splendor of this Day's Solemnity, such Remarkable Occurrences have happened, this Year, as will render your Name and Memory famous to all Posterity: What is most to be Recorded, is, the Restoring of the Charter of London, which happened in the Year of your Mayoralty, 88. Auspicious 88! England's great
Year of Jubilee, twice Propitious to this Fa∣mous City: First, In Restoring our Lives and Estates: Secondly, Our Laws and Freedoms, in the free Exercise of our Antient Establish'd Government. What other Worthies durst not Attempt, you like Jason, bravely Adventur'd for the Prize, and brought the Golden Fleece in Triumph home. In the late threatning Deluge, when the Ark was tost upon the Foaming Bil∣lows, you, like the Dove, was sent Abroad, and like the Dove returned with the Olive-Branch of Joy. This unspeakable Mark of Royal Boun∣ty occurring this Year with your Right of Suc∣cession to the Praetorial Chair, will Record your Name to future Ages, beyond all the Witless Panegyricks of,
My LORD,
