Madam,
THe principal intent of our publishing these ensuing Sermons, is no other then Edification:
 and for the avoiding all suspition of being accoun∣ted spurious and illegitimate; we have assumed the bold∣nesse to dedicate them to your Ladiship, with a con∣fident hope of your Honou∣rable Protection; and that whereas heretofore they have been beneficiall to his Auditory, they may now prove no lesse successful to the intelligent Reader; it being pity the Works of so Famous and Eminent a Di∣vine, should be raked up in the embers of Oblivion: And though they have no other Originall then the Pen of a ready Writer; yet such diligent care hath been imployed in emitting them
 to the World, that we doubt not, but you will conclude, we have endeavou∣red the perpetuating the me∣mory of your Pious Consort: For here lurks no Snake under these Verdant Herbs, nor Poysonous Serpent un∣der these Fragrant Flowers; in this inclosed Garden growes no Root of Schisme, no slip of Error, no fruit of Disobedience; but within this pleasant Grove are such variety of refreshing contentments to be found, as may delight your Ladi∣ship amidst your more Solitary Cogitations; and yet these are but parts of that Image which ere long we hope to erect, and in a
 larger Volume. We shall crave leave to (as we doe at present) subscribe our selves,
Madam,
