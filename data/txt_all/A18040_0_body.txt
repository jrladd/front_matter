CONSIDERYNG with my self, how greatelye wee are bounde, to render thanks vnto God, for the great benefits, which he hath bestowed vpon vs: whiche benefits are in∣finit, and wee are not able to yeelde vnto him, prayse, honour and glory, so much as he deser∣ueth, whiche thinge I did well perpend, therfore I thought it meete to practise my pen, in the exercise of the litle talēt which God hath lent vnto mee: to the

augmenting of Vertue, and to abrogate vice, for I was moo∣ued to diuulgate, or set foorth this simple woorke, accordinge to my literature, as far as my capacitie was able to compasse. For I beyng wholy drowned, in the Lake of ignorance, had no∣thing more precious, to present vnto you, but this the paterne of my simplicitie, whiche God hath lent vnto mee. I was the much more imboldened, to dedi∣cate this simple worke vnto you, sith that I haue knowen your zelous affection, which yet you haue euer borne, to the encrease of learnyng, and that your stu∣die hath euer bin prest, to serche

and looke for the preseruation of the same. And moreouer because that I had a good hope and affection, that you woulde as well esteeme of this my sim∣ple woorke, beyng the first fru∣tes of my labour, as though it were a greate deale more bet∣ter. And according as I per∣ceiue and vnderstand how that you doo take this simple woorke being presented vnto you, it wil animate and encourage me, to employ my studie, more then yet I haue doone hitherto. And although that I want the flow∣ers of rethorike, to beutyfi and set forth this simple worke, yet I shall desyre ye, as I haue don

before, to accept it: and if that any fault you finde there in, I shall desyer ye; to ostende your fauour so muche, that I may haue entelligence of it, for I wyll euer more submit my self, to the counsell of the learned: and further more, I shall de∣syer ye, not thinke the worst of it, for I wil not, nor meane not to teache any man, how and af∣ter what sort, he shall behaue him selfe, in any respect. For I my self, haue as much neede of teaching, as he that hath most, but I will alway stande vnder the correction of the learned. Thus hopyng that you will ac∣cept this my trauayle and good

wil, according to your accusto∣med curtesie, and be a patrone, in the defence of this my worke and to gratifie your curtesie, I will shew my self frendable towards you, and now I am lothe to trouble ye, with any▪ more circumstance, but wishyng God to preserue you in health, wealth, and felicitie, to his blessed will and pleasure.
Amen.
