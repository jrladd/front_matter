DEar Brother, and Brethren, I, taking notice of the design of Anti-Christ, whose trou∣ble it is to see the Church of Christ in∣crease, and his honour flourish, it being the decay of his worldly honour and wicked Government, and so he hath as from the very root of envy against the honour of Jesus Christ, and the good of his Church, his, viz. Anti-Christs honour, and interest being concerned in his design, which moves him to indeavour the ruin of Christs honour, and of his people in that, he hath in these last days indeavou∣red to confound Christs Church, and the way his peo∣ple walk in, by using Instruments to perswade them to shift obedience to Gods Ordinances, especially in point of Baptism, and breaking of Bread, pretending as if he hath brought in a new dispensation by way of Revelation and immediate inspiration, consisting of the power of Godliness without the form; sometimes appearing like an Angel of light in point of opinion, and sometimes like a civil honest man for matter of conversation, thinking the Church of Christ could not have espied his painted blasphemy in point of opinion, nor his dissembling hy∣pocrisie in using civil honesty as a cloak for his Knavery;
so that under pretence of bringing men over to serve Christ in a higher dispensation, as he calls it, he might bring them to serve himself in a blasphemous way, giving God the lye, in saying he hath not commanded the Saints now to be Baptized in water, nor to hold visible Com∣munion in the Supper, or breaking of Bread; and thus he indeavours to divide the Church of Christ by this means: but when he could not prevail utterly to confound the Church this way, Christ having some stout Souldiers, who as instruments under God did withstand him, he now attempts utterly to ruin the Church of Christ ano∣ther way; for finding many in the Church, whom he cannot by his former design deceive, they were so zea∣lous for obedience to Gods Ordinances, he now lays his bait where he thinks it is most likely to catch, viz. in actions relating to Ordinances, and so with something like truth, which is not truth, but an error so neatly dres∣sed with truths habit, that few are able to look through truths habit, so as to see the ugly shape of errour that barks under it: he strikes at the very being of the Church; and therefore seeing Gods honour and the Churches Peace and well being is so much concerned in it, I desire all my dear Brethren and Friends, as they with me tender Gods honour and the Churches well being, Impartially to read and deliberately to consider this following Trea∣tise, the which if you do, though Anti-Christ hath pre∣vailed with some, who have a great influence upon the Churches to be Instrumental for the promoting of his de∣fence, though I verily believe they know it not, but as some zealous Presbyters do, when they sprinkle Infants think they do God good service, you shall see this error stript of truths habit, and laid open in its own colours; and whereas Brother Morly in his Epistle to the Reader seems
to be the more confident in his way, because the Bishops kept the name of Gods Ordinances, of which, saith he, laying on of hands was one; but I must tell him and you, that for my part I dare not receive neither the name nor nature of Baptism, nor laying on of hands, as from what the Bishops said or did, no further then they said and did according to the rule of Scripture; and so if your practice had been such a one, as had been taught by way of Do∣ctrine, and injoyned by way of Command from Scrip∣ture, it had been well; but your practise of laying on of hands being such a one as is neither taught by way of Doctrine, nor injoyned by way of Command, is of the more sad and dangerous consequence, as sad experience hath proved; so hoping you will take the Counsel of the Spirit of God by the Apostle; 2 Cor. 13. viz. To examin your selves whether you be right in the Faith or not, I shall refer you to the following discourse for further satisfa∣ction, and rest and remain,
