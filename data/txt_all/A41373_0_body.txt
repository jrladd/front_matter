Right Honourable,
IT is the Saying of a professed Adeptist, That he who Ope∣rates for the Philosophers Stone, attempts the highest



Piece of Philosophy that is in Nature Rip. Rev. pag. 159.: This Essay tending to that purpose, so as to vindicate the Art of it, and to make thē whole more Conspicuous; it is therefore necessary that things, which are said to stand so high in NATVRE, should be sub∣mitted to the Censure of your most Learned Society, best able to judge whether or no they are Built on a good and sure Foun∣dation. Such part of it there∣fore as is orderly gathered from the Sayings of Grave and Sober Philosophers, I humbly Dedi∣cate to your Honours; but that which is Frivolous, and of less Account, I preserve to my Self, as being my own proper Talent. Neither shall I presume to beg your Honours Protection for any part thereof, further than the same may appear to be groun∣ded

on Nature and Philosophy, and tending to the Benefit of all ingenuous Men; for I have per∣swaded my self, that it will prove one of the plainest of Treatises, (especially for Discription and Order of Principles) that have hitherto (on this Subject) ap∣peared to open View; and that, indeed, is the chiefest Reason why it is intended to be made Pub∣lick; an Inducement quite con∣trary to what hath been formerly practised on this Account: And I must, seriously confess, I see not any great Reason for that profound Silence Authors have heretofore imposed upon their Readers, when, at the same time, they exposed their Books to the sight (if not for the use) of all Men: Yet I acknowledge a Moderation may be good in this Matter. Neither do I go about to prostitute the Se∣crets



of this Kind, but so Plainly and Orderly (as I may) to re∣present them in a Philosophical Glass and Habit; that thereby they may be distinguished from the vul∣gar Crowd, and not hereafter be Misrepresented by any Subtil Im∣postours: Besides, I have conside∣red that proper Saying of Sendi∣vogius, in the Conclusion of his Book; viz. That this Art is al∣ways Acquired by the same kind of Wits and Dispositions, So that if each Principle were openly named, yet none but they who are of the same Inclinations: with the Adepti, will be able to prepare, much less to perfect so Great a Work; which Thing also is well known unto to your Honours.


I could not (Right Honoura∣ble) at first Writing, presume so high a Dedication; and there∣fore observed not that Gravity and Decorum, in the Composition, which your Honours may justly expect; but Writ it with a Natu∣ral and Careless Freedom; by which, I hope, the Truth will not be less Edifying to the Searchers, or Con∣victive to the Gainsayers; thô, I must grant, it is somewhat Un∣mannerly thus to approach your Royal Society: For this there∣fore I beg your Pardon, as also for that I have (from the Authors) mentioned the Names of some Heathens, as Gods (by wich ne∣vertheless is only meant, some one Principle or other) and which I could not altogether avoid. There may also be several other Mi∣stakes, and particularly in not di∣rectly Spelling according to the

English Hermetick Poetry; which Failures and Mistakes, if they shall be Excused by your Honours, will be taken as a high Favour to him, whose utmost Ambition is to subscribe himself,
