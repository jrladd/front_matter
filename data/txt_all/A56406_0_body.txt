MADAM,
THE shortness of the Time which was allow∣ed me for the deli∣vering of the Sermon preach'd at the Funeral of your Excellent Mother, would not permit that fuller Account of Her which I now humbly offer to you, (with that Sermon enlarged.)

Notwithstanding which Additions, I am sensible there remains much un∣said equal to the things I have remarked, though assisted by some very conside∣ble Memorials sent to me by a most worthy Friend to your Family, who hath been acquainted with her four and forty Years, and passed many of them in her House.
But there being a necessity of omit∣ting some things, unless I would have exceeded the usual Bounds of such Narratives: I only beg your Pardon if I have not made the best choice a∣mong those Treasures of Excellencies and Christian Accomplishments that were found in Her.
These which I have collected, I hope may be useful to them who have any Inclination to Piety, as serving to
excite to a great degree of Holiness: This being the natural Tendency of great Examples recorded, even to move others to Imitation.
Which Effect I am much assured it will produce in your Self; and You of all others are most obliged to endea∣vour it, having been constantly con∣versant with the Patern, when living.
It is a great Honour to have de∣scended from such a Parent; but it will be much more to tread with that Exactness in her Steps, that all that behold your Conversation, may see Her living in You.
It was Her earnest desire you might survive, and God hath fulfilled it. She hath left You in her Province, clothed with her Mantle. And may a double Portion of her Spirit rest upon
You! that You may honour God, as She did. And that You may enjoy a long and prosperous Life here; and then ascend to Heaven, and partake toge∣ther with Her in equal Glory, is the earnest Prayer of,
Madam,
