SIR,
WHen I had perform'd the Service
which you were pleas'd to call me
to in the preaching of this Sermon, I had
no thoughts of making it more publique.
And yet in this also I was the more easily
induced to comply with your desire, because
of the suitableness of the Argument to the
Age in which we live: Wherein as men
have run into the wildest extremities in other
things, so particularly in the matter of Oaths;
some making conscience of taking any Oath at
all, and too many none at all of breaking them.

To convince the great mistake of the one
extreme, and to check the growing evil and
mischief of the other, is the chief design of
this Discourse. To which I shall be very
glad if by God's blessing it may prove any
wise serviceable. I am
Sir,
Your very faithfull
and
humble Servant
