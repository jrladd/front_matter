May it please Your Highness,
IT was the Design of the Author of the following Papers, a Person very faithful to the Interest of the Crown, to make an Humble Present of himself and them, to Your Highness; but being at this time under great Indisposition, I was desir'd to present his Duty by Proxy, and lay his Performance at Your Royal Highnesses Feet. I will acknowledge to Your Highness, that I am no Friend to Epitomies, especially in Law, where the Truth and the whole Truth is so strictly required: But I look upon this to be one of the faithfullest and perfectest that ever I have seen, having carefully perus'd the whole, to say nothing of that Candor and Ingenuity of Temper, which makes some New Discovery of it Self in every Page of the whole Work, being very far from a Design of Impo∣sing any thing False, or Aggravating any thing beyond the naked Truth, and abounding every where with ma∣ny unquestionable Stroaks of a Courteous and Gentle Nature, very fit if Honestly and Wisely managed, to poyse and balance these uneven Times.

The irrefragable clearness of the Proof, added to the Conciseness of this Author's Method, will shew Your Highness at once, as in a Glass, the imminent Dangers the King and You have escaped, and with You the Clergy, the Nobility, nay, the Commons themselves, who would most of them, before this time, have been Buryed in Confusion, and Rolling in Blood, which as in all it ought to Create a Mortal and Vatini∣an Hatred of those Horrid Principles, by which the Enemies of this Church and Monarchy are Acted, and of those Barbarous, though Natural Conclusions that issue from them; so more particularly in Your Royal Highness, there is no doubt, but the Reflection upon such Villany as this, will inflame so Generous and so Loyal an Heart with an ardent Affection for that Church, which long and sad Experience hath told us, is to be the only true Prop and Supporter of the Crown.
That God would Guide Your Royal Highness by his Council, and after a long and fortunate Old Age, re∣ceive You into Glory, is the Humble and Affectionate Prayer of,
May it please your Royal Highness,
