To the most Noble and Illustrious JAMES Duke of Lenox, Earl of March, Baron of Setrington, Darn∣ly, Terbanten, and Methuen, Lord great Chamberlain and Admiral of Scotland, Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and one of his Majesties most hono∣rable Privy Council in both Kingdoms.
I Offer here to your Graces patronage my best endea∣vors, discovering at large their imperfections, in what I can claim mine in this work. For which however I may have in∣curred

the blame of some, as unable to do the Author, I have under∣taken, his full right, but rather by my rude stile wronging his original lustre; yet perhaps, with others more moderate, I may find favor and good acceptance, as well for my choice of the Author, whose worth will somewhat beare me out, as be∣cause I have contributed hereunto what I ought, which can be no more then what I could. Mine Author was a Florentine, whose national attribute among the Italians is sub∣tilty, and whose particular eminence in cunning hath styled the most cun∣ning, as his Sectaries, Machiavilli∣ans. Nor hath this workman taken in hand a work unproper for his skill, being the discovery of the first foundations, and analyzing of the very grounds upon which the Ro∣man Commonwealth was built, and afterwards rose to such glory and power, that neither before nor after all the ages of the world

ever afforded the like example.
This book I conceived, I might not unfitly present your Grace with, as unto whose service I owe my self and what I can, and whom as well for neereness of blood, as affection and favor, his Sacred Majesty may most probably imploy in this our ship of State near the helme, to the end it may in some part serve for your experience, as a good sea-card, whereby you may become able and expert, as well in the entrances and passages into all creeks and harbors of quiet, as in the discovery and avoidance of all rocks and shelves; for as at sea it is alwaies seen, that in a stormy and tempestuous time, the master dares not trust the rudder in the hand of others then such as are the best approved and experien∣ced Mariners; so, in all States we find, that however in time of peace and quiet, allyance, blood, and favor have a main stroke in matter of preferments and imployments too

yet when the times grow perplex∣ed with perils and difficulties, true worth and experience are sought af∣ter, and then of value. No climate is so benigne, as to afford a perpe∣tual calme, and therefore your Grace may do well to enable your self for the service of your Prince and Countrey, that being called for into the steerage in turbulent times, not favor, onely may give you a place there, but use find you necessary, whereunto if I could contribute a poore mite, I had done enough.
Notwithstanding however my Authour, in what he hath done well, hath far excelled others, yet is he not without his ble∣mishes and errors to; which, as well as I was able to discover them, I have markt, and there∣unto added some observations, taking (as I think) all his no∣torious errors in this book: Where∣in I may have committed faults too,

which you may be pleased to pass over, as no strange thing, but ac∣cept rather the duty of
