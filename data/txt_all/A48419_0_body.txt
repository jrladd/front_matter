May it please your Ladyship,
SInce onely High Priests are to Sacrifice at High Al∣tars, where all Religious Ceremonies, and Devotion are requir'd, the sacrifice I now of∣fer might seem a little strange to your Ladyship, unless the de∣votion, with which it is accom∣panied remov'd your Honours wonder. The hope of this (Ma∣dam) induced this oblation,
 which no wayes is proportiona∣ble to your Ladyships high qua∣lity, but rather as a monument erected to the memory, and re∣ligious sence I have, of your. Ladyships Noble favours to me And since no other motive en∣gag'd me in this Offering, what book could I have found, more agreeable, and more sutable to your Honours condition, where a Life so full of Piety, and so farr above the common pitch of others, is presented to your Lady∣ships view. As the Sun there∣fore (Madame) when it is at the highest, imparts the greatest benefit to the Earth, so your Ladyship, I hope (who is in so high and so eminent a sphere of
 Nobility, and worth) will im∣part the rayes, and influence of a favourable Acceptance, to the low endeavours of
Madam,
