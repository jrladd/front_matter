MADAM,
'TIS from Your innate Good∣ness only, and that conde∣scending Temper which is so re∣markable in You, that this Foreign Leaf dares presume to court Your Favour, and hope for a welcom Entertainment. For where can a Stranger, that was always bred a∣mong a People the most polite of any in the World, expect a kind Reception with more Assurance, than from a Person, whose Con∣versation is adorn'd with all that Civility that even China it self can boast of? And therefore while it

gains Your Countenance, 'twill find it self as happy here, as if it still had stay'd at home; nay, rather with Advantage to have chang'd its delightful native Soil, while 'tis under the more pleasant Influences of Your Protection.
But though the Name of a Per∣son, Madam, so Eminent as You are, both upon the Account of Your Illustrious ORMOND Family, and those particular Accomplish∣ments which give You so distinguish∣ing a Character, were enough to re∣commend this healthful Herb to any that were in the least acquainted with either of them; yet is it not it self destitute of some peculiar Vir∣tues, which may justly claim a very favourable Encouragement from us.
For it is generally acknowledg'd

to be both Pleasant and Medicinal, at once to delight the Palate and correct the Disease, and to heal the Distemper without giving any Di∣sturbance to the Stomach.
And certainly were the Custom of Drinking it as Universal here, as it is in the Eastern Countries, we should quickly find that Men might be chear∣ful with Sobriety, and witty without the Danger of losing their Senses; and that they might even double the Days of their natural Life, by con∣verting it all into Enjoyment, exempt from several painful and acute Dis∣eases, occasion'd very often by a per∣nicious Excess of inflaming Liquors, which render it rather a Burthen, than a Blessing to us.
But in pity, Madam, to this tender Leaf, I must cease from Pa∣negyrick,

lest it should create a Sa∣tyr, and the innocent Praises of it be eccho'd back in sharp Invectives. For since its Constitution is so nice and delicate, as to be injur'd even by com∣mon Air, it will never be able to withstand the Malignity of an envi∣ous Breath, unless Your Honour and Goodness interpose, which are so con∣spicuous, that Malice it self would blush to fix an Imputation upon them.
And from these Excellencies of Yours, which are the Crown and Or∣nament of Nobility, the Author hopes to find Your Pardon in the present Dedication; and that the Greatness of Your Mind will at this time show it self in Your Indulgence to,
Madam,
