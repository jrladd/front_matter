SYR if wee ponder things duely in the Ballance of consideration; wee shall finde that the Sonnes of Adam, are cummonly ei∣ther crossed and combred with the burthen of trou∣ble and a iuersitie; or else doe enioy (in more or lesse measure) quietnes and prosperitie.
The first sort (for the most part) repine and grumble against Gods sacred prouidence; as though he that keepeth Israell, did slumber or sleepe, & they are enfeebled, and faint, & wel∣nigh faile, vnder the weight of tribulation; as though euen as Christ suffeed, and then en∣tered into his glorie, So wee also should not through many afflictions enter into the king∣dome of God: & they turne aside to by-paths
 out of the right course; seeking plenarie con∣tentation in transitorie delights, where it can∣not be found; forsaking the Fountaine of li∣uing waters, and following broken Cesternes, that can holde no liquor; repairing to Beelze∣bub the god of Ekron, as though there were no God in Israel, or Balme in Gilead.
The second sorte forgetting, that Christi∣ans (as fellow-members of one bodie) are in∣teressed one in anothers Felicitie, and there∣fore ought to simpathize mutually, and parti∣cipate their ioy with their brethren; are ei∣ther negligent in making their Election sure, by good workes, and in manifesting the since∣ritie of their Faith, by Loue and Charitie: Or, albeit they haue a most sure word of the Prophets, to guide them: yet they doe not take heede vnto it, as vnto a Light that shi∣neth in a darke place, vntill the Day dawne, and the Day-starre arise in their hearts: Or, they are insolent and proude of their vertues, and puffed vp, with an ouer-weening conceit of their imaginarie perfection: Or, they are tired, & quickly wearied in the race of pietie, & at last fall away from their owne stedfastnes.
They that are attainted with these, and the like, daily and dangerous maladies, by adui∣sed perusing, & effectuall practizing of these following Treatises, shall (through the bles∣sing
 of the God of all Consolation,) feele their infirmities, if not altogether cured and remoued, yet much diminished and miti∣gated: specially, if they applie the enioyned Medicines, in such manner as they ought; Namely, with reuerence, zeale, and faith; and if they bring a minde and longing desire to be recouered.
For it falls out in spirituall diseases, as it doeth in corporall: when a Medicine is not takē in decent order, it becomes vnprofitable: And when the grieued person doth not desi∣rously couet health, all potions are vnfruitful.
Neither onely the receits are here prescri∣bed; but their reasons are drawne out of that Booke, vnto which all humane reason must be subiect: least perhaps otherwise some Pa∣tient might say, as the Prince of Philosophers did in his griefe to his Physitian; Come not to heale mee, as if I were a Neat-heard, or an Hedger, but yeelde me a reason of the things thou commandest, & I will the more prompt∣ly obserue them.
My doings shall be battered with detracti∣on, Cauillation, Controlling. For some feede themselues with the gaule of Animaduersion, and bitternes of reprehension, as it is repor∣ted, that the Quaile liueth by poyson. But my comfort is this; that these backe-biters,
 are not very powerfull, albeit they be fraught with carping; as the Serpent Porphyrus hath venome, but he hath it to himselfe onely, for that hee wants Teeth: and that they will op∣pugne and push faintely, and so retire their∣selues, because they can doe no more hurte; as the Waspe strikes, and then flies away, lea∣uing her sting behinde her: and that by at∣tempting to ruinate the inuincible Bulwarke of Trueth, they will bewray their owne imbe∣cillitie, and fall groueling backward; as hee that throwes a stone against a Marble pillar, breaketh not the Marble, but by the vehe∣ment repercussion breedes his owne perill.
What curtesie soeuer the curious and ma∣lignant will affoorde me; seeing my purpose was to please, pleasure, and profite manie, and to displease, gaule, and offend, none that are godlie: whether hee that studies to doe good, though hee performe it not, bee not to be ac∣cepted; since he that is willing to doe harme, though hee effect it not, is to bee reiected; Let the vnkind traducer answere; as the Phi∣losopher expostulated, when he departed from the Syracusane Tyrant.
When Antimachus was forsaken of all his Auditors, except Plato, yet hee proceeded in reading his Booke, esteeming Plato to coun∣terpoize them all; So though the Criticke
 and disdainefull, shall contemne and deride my doings; yet if the well disposed, that hunger and thirst after righteousnes, that are poore in Spirite, and pure in heart; that mourne for iniquitie, shall entertaine them, they are to mee in stead of all, and I desire no more Readers. As for the daintie; I exhorte them to feede on the fine Flower of the Lear∣ned, whose manifold Bookes abound with ex∣quisite cates; & to passe by this course Beane, which is conuenient onely for hungrie Sto∣mackes. But those that had rather suche dan∣gerous opinions, out of eloquent wordes, then profitable instructions out of ordinarie termes; As though it were better to drinke poison out of a golden pot, then wholesome liquor out of an earthen cup: and those that consume the pretious Time of this Posting life, in long turning and pervsing of toyous and vaine discourses; As though it were safe Fi∣shing with a Golden hooke in troubled wa∣ters, where the labour will yeelde small aduan∣tage, but the loosing of the hooke may bee damageable.
If they will not followe the Example of Marie, in chosing the good part, which shall not be taken away: yet I admonish them to consider, that though Heauen and Earth shall passe away, yet the word of God abideth euer;
 and that howsoeuer the louers of this fugitiue world are deuoted, yet to the truely religious, the Lawe of the Lord is sweeter then Honie, or the Hony-combe, and better then thou∣sands of golde and siluer; and that at last they that trie the inuentions of men in the conflict of Conscience, will crie out with the children of the Prophets, Death is in the potte; and with Ieremiah, What is the Chaffe to the Wheate? and with the patient Iob to his Friendes, Miserable comforters are yee all; Shall there bee none end of wordes of winde?
If you shall fauourablie vouchsafe to coun∣tenance these few vnfiled Treatises, Dedica∣ted by him, that wisheth you the continuall multiplying of Gods graces; I shall account the fruite of my labour in some forwardnesse; and be strictly obliged euer to remaine.
