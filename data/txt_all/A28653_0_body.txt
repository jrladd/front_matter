Dread Soveraign,
I Humbly beseech Your Gracious Majesty, that you would be pleased to pardon my boldness in presuming to present any thing to Your Majesty: But understanding that Your Clemency is very great; and besides, knowing that the thing
 that I here humbly present unto You is that which hath not been known to former Ages, here in our Nation, nor to Foreign Nations is not yet known to this day: That hath Imboldened me to presume humbly to present it to Your Majesty.
And that as Almighty God was pleased that the beginning of it should be in this Kingdom, so now he is pleased that the Conclusion and chiefest use of it (which is to find the Longitude) is made known in the time of Your Reign, for the Honour of Your Majesty and Your Kingdoms: And You have given Command for the Publishing of it, that it may be, not only for the benefit of Your own Subjects, but also for the benefit of all the Christian Nations in the World; for which
 Your Majesty will be acknowledged by the present Generation, and re∣corded to after Generations, to be the Rectifier and Setler of the Geogra∣phy, and Hydrography of the whole World. The Lord God Almighty bless and prosper Your Majesty with a long and prosperous Reign here, and an everlasting Reign in Glory hereafter. So prays
