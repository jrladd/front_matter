Right Worshipful,
I Humbly beseech you to pardon my bold∣ness in presenting these rude and unpolished lines to your learned views: You whom God hath set on high, and like Stars of the greater ma∣gnitude which shine forth
more bright then others; or like as the Celestial Signs moving in their own proper Sphere, govern the several parts of mans body: so in like manner you Reverend Doctors and Heads of Colledges, moving in your Sphere, do superintend and govern the whole Body of this Famous University, being under your Care and Tuition. I had not presumed to present this small Tract to your Wor∣ships, if that of the Poet had not came into my minde, Au∣daces fortuna juvat: whereupon rushing on you unawares, and at an adventure, I beseech your Worships pardon, and that you would be so far pleased as to
grace this small Treatise with your favourable acceptance, which contains in it certain ob∣servations upon the Apostles Creed; or as the Author there∣of John Ellis a Reverend Doctor of Divinity styled it, Clavis Fi∣de the which in a Translation from Oxford to Cambridge, hath in a short space learn'd in plain English to speak its mother tongue: and I rather implore your patronage and protection of it then any other, by reason of the calumnies and aspersions that some may cast upon me the Translator thereof, (qui nun∣quam gradum suscepi) and al∣though I was no Scholar brought up at the University,
yet à teneris unguiculis, even from my tender years I have ever bin a lover of learning, and a Scho∣lars servant, there being about thirty and nine years expired since I was first a servant to Mr Thomas Buck, at the Art of Printing: but having h a long vacation from my em∣ployment of composing letters (in that late and epidemical time of Plague and Pestilence) I began to consider with my self how to spend my time to the best advantage, and ta∣king this small Book into my hand, and here and there per∣using it, I did at last assay to translate it, the which through Gods assistance I have finish∣ed,
and exposed to publick view. And now at length ho∣ping of your Worships favour∣able acceptance and patronage of it, your unworthy servant shall ever be paying that which is but his duty to do, the debt of gratitude and thankfulness to you, though never to the full: Si ingratum dixeritis, om∣nia dicitis; for as one well spake, An ungrateful man is no man, but an enemy to God and man: but your humble servant hopes that your Worships shall have no cause to say so of him, nor yet suspect him to be guilty thereof: but he shall ever pray to Almighty God, that he would so water your studies
with the dew of his heavenly benediction, that after this painful life ended, he would translate you from hence into the Kingdom of his dear Son. The which he prays for, who is, and shall ever remain,
