SIR,
NOthing can be more fit, than to dedi∣cate a Catalogue of that Musaeum to your Self, of which you are the Founder. You having, in your Devotion to the Royal Society, offered up to them That so noble an Hecatombe.
The truth is, I have herein prosecuted, what the Royal Society, by their Order for the making and publishing of this Catalogue, had begun: they ha∣ving done the same, as with regard to Common Use; so to return that which is but Right to your Self, and that they might always wear this Cata∣logue, as the Miniature of your abundant Respects, near their Hearts.
Neither must your Voluntary Undertaking for the Engraving of the Plates for this Work, be un∣known. You having done this, not only out of respect to my Self; but likewise in order to a Pub∣lique Good; whereby you are a Benefactor to all Ingenious Men.
Besides the particular regard you had to the Royal Society it Self; which seeming (in the opinion of some) to look a little pale, you intended hereby,

to put some fresh Blood into their Cheeks; pour∣ing out your Box of Oyntment, not in order to their Burial, but their Resurrection.
To conclude, I have made this Address, not on∣ly to do You Right, but to do Right unto Virtue it self; and that having proposed your exemplary prudence unto others; they may from you, learn, To use the redundant part of their Estates, either to a Charitable end, as this City will witness for your Self; or the Promotion of Masculine Studies, as in the present Case: or other laudable ways, so as with you, to merit a lasting esteem amongst the wiser and better part of Mankind.
I am, 
Sir,
