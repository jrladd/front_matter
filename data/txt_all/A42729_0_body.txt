THE slying of this small piece to your Lordships feet for protecti∣on (against this Ages sharp set Hawks, the common terrour of Doves that are still preying upon Truth and Innocence;

which hath too commonly the weakest defence) hath had in∣couragement by the honour your Lordship hath confer'd upon its Author in your obliging Converse with him upon the subject it treats on; and in some particulars made him new discoveries, for the more speedy producing new Faces to some species of Flora's War∣drope: as
Apriles pandunt Imbres Mineralia Maij.
Down April drops a moist Key
To open the rich Mines of May.
So
Your Lordships skill, like April show'rs,
Produce the choicest of May Tulips flow'rs.
Also
Your Lordships love to, as

well as skill in Plants and Flowers, makes me presume of your favourable construction hereof; and that as your Lord∣ship is exemplarily charitable to all other sutable objects, this cannot (humbly begging it) but find that current still free and running in its natu∣ral Channel. And if your Lordship condescend (being the greatest Florist amongst the chiefest Pillars of cur Church) to water the Flowers in this Book with a gentle Approbation, or cast a Benign Aspect upon them, I shall not then question their flourishing, tho not in equality to that

rare Collection in your Pallace Garden: nor fear its accep∣tance by all good men (for only such are delighted in this Innocent Recreation) over whom your Lordship hath a powerful influence, by your sublime and Florid-parts, dig∣nity of place, noble dispositi∣on, and generous hospitality. I must not here (if being super∣fluous) insist on what the most part of the World is so well acquainted with (that the Sun is a glorious Planet; whose comfortable Beams and Heat, as a secondary means, gives life and maintains all Creatures as well as

Plants and Flowers in the vi∣gorous process of nature) but implore a pardon for doing a∣ny thing to divert your Lord∣ship from your accustomed di∣ligence in that high Calling God hath placed you; which yet may afford some divertise∣ment from that in this so inno∣cent imploy; when the result thereof (beside's bodily health) is the admiration of Gods power and providence (tho but) in the Creation, production and preservation of the many diffe∣rent Plants and Flowers that so chequer the Ʋniverse. But whilst I am begging absolution for a Crime, I am still persisting

in it; therefore with all humili∣ty I leave this small Book, where I first laid it, as knowing none will more favourably, nor can with more ability Correct its Errors; and by such example abate the rigorous Censures from the less knowing, that may her rayes be reflected on
