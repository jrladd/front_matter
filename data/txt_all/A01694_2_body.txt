VErtuous Ladies, and Right Ho∣norable Maides, attending on the only vertuous Ladye and Maide in the world: the du∣teous affection I beare yee, and the vnualuable respected graces receiued from you se∣uerally,

is the onlie aduo∣cate must plead for my pre∣sent boldnesse; what he can say for mee, is but returne of humble thankefulnesse; what hee expectes from you, is but excuse from presump∣tion and fauourable accep∣taunce: both which meet∣ing in no misinterpreted cōstruction, you shal remaine for euer honored, & I in my sute right fully satisfied.
A friend & fellow seruant with me to her Maiesty ha∣uing left in trust with me this litle treatise, being a Paradoxe

Apologicall of womens ver∣tues, written in French by an honorable person, and Dedicated by him to a wor∣thy Dutchesse: knowing my friendes intent to sute with mine, that on you (rather then any other) the same should be bestowed, as only true Ideas of vertue, and glo∣ries of your sexe: In his ab∣sence, (though yet in his harts meaning I know) I offer both his good will and mine thus ioyntly together.
If you giue it but good lookes, it is all I desire, but

if it may gayne your very least good word, his labour and my loue are most high∣ly answered. In which hope (as to hope otherwise from so true spirits, were well wor∣thy reproofe:) I humbly com∣mit this translation to your fauourable perusing, and my very vttermost trauailes to beat your commaunding.
