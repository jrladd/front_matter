SIR,
THO I have so deep a Resent∣ment of those many &
extra∣ordinary Favours which you have been pleas'd to confer upon me, that I
know it impossible to make any proportionable retaliation, and think it
would be also more than  a venial sin, to offer such a
violence to Gratitude, as not to acknowledge them with all Thankfulness; yet
I must assure you and all the World, the Argu∣ments which prevail'd with
me for this Dedica∣tion, were fetch'd from Topicks of a far different nature.
The Discourse is of a Pious and Publick Concernment, and there∣fore no
other Patron could be more sutable, than one of such a Sober and
Well-temper'd Zeal, and that with such a pru∣dent care of the Publick 
 Peace and common good adorn your Station, as all that know you
must bear witness to.
The Cure of Offences, and an endeavour to recover the Age
from the Mis∣chiefs of Misunderstand∣ing & prejudice, and set∣tle
it in a harmonious peace, and united Devo∣tion, will not go under a∣ny other
Patronage, than of so Loyal a Subject to his Majesty, a hearty
well-wisher to the Doctrine & Discipline of the Church of
England, and one that by Inclination, as well as 
Authority, is an enemy to all that of malitious wick∣edness offend against
ei∣ther.
Neither do I fear here∣by to derive (from the most invidious
person) a∣ny envy upon you, or the imputation of flattery up∣on my self;
since it is a well-known Maxime, that Honour as a shadow flies the
pursuer, but follows him close that flies from it: and among thankful men,
Desert will sooner be de∣scried where it obscures it self, and
published with greater applause the less it is affected.
Sir, If these few and unpolish'd Papers, that in
all Humility and Thankfulness, and as a lasting Testimony of my due
Respects I here of∣fer to you, may be ser∣viceable to the Public, in
reducing Dissenters to a Venerable Esteem of our Church, and an
una∣nimous embracing all its Holy Sanctions, I have accomplish'd my end; and
hope to obtain your pardon for making use of your Name to counte∣nance this
honest Design:  in confidence whereof, I shall never cease
to im∣plore the Blessings of Heaven for your self, your Virtuous
Consort, and all your hopeful Is∣sue; and take leave to as∣sume the
Honour of be∣ing
Worthy Sir,
