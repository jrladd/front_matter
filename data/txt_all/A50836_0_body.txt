Madam!
WHEN Religion appears in a declining State, only the greatest Hands can re∣vive the expiring Virgin, make soft Blushes rush out again into her faded Checks, and stubborn and unnurtur'd Souls submit to the sacred Violence of her prevailing Beauties.
Almighty God is the Great Physician who alone can make this happy Change in Her, who, as descended from Himself, depends upon his Smiles, and lives and conquers only to and for Him; but He makes Princes Nursing Fathers, and Princesses Nursing Mothers to that heavenly Charmer. He made a Royal Ʋnbeliever the Pa∣troness of his Friend, the Founder of Judaism, expos'd to the uncertain Fluxes of the Nile; and has appointed Your Royal Highness, the greatest Princess of the Christian Name, the blest Pro∣tectress of that Divine Religion, profestin that Church which he has here founded in his own most precious Blood.

I have endeavour'd to reduce a wandring Ha∣gar, perverted Poetry, to the Service of her sacred Mistress; I have taught her to sing the Songs of Sion in a degenerate Age; I have filled her Mouth with holy Prayers, humble Praises, and devout Ejaculations; have taught her to look up again to that Heaven from whence she came at first; and that she may hereafter take the Nobler Flights, I lay her an humble Pe∣titioner at the Feet of Your Royal Highness.
However I have manag'd the Cause, I'm sure I have taken Sanctuary under the best Protec∣tion: And if THE CHRISTIAN PATTERN, hugg'd so oft in pious Bosoms when in her rustick Habit, can now in a more refin'd State and cheereful Garb give any Delight to Your Royal Highness's retir'd Hours; or, under the Shadow of so August a Name, make Religion and Piety more valued among reputed Christians, I shall think my self invidiously happy, and all those Minutes well employ'd, which gave mean Op∣portunity to assume the Title God's and Your Royal Highness's
