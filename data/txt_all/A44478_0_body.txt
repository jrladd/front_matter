SIR,
I Here present, or rather
pay, what I have often
promised you, and what
you have a right to; The Poems
of HORACE in the English
tongue: To the Translation

whereof my pleasant retirement
and conveniencies at your de∣lightsome
Habitation, have libe∣rally
contributed.
And now according to the Cu∣stome
of my Predecessors, having
spoyled some paper with writing
a bad Book, I am to waste more
in a worse Preface, least I suf∣fer
under the imputation of be∣ing
a heretick in Book-writing.
However, I will be so kind to
you and my self, as to spare so
much time and paper as might
be employed in celebrating your
Greatness, Virtues, and generous
Inclinations towards me, being
Themes for a higher Pen than

dare pretend to, and only tell you
how you came to be disturbed
with these undertakings.
'Twas not because I under∣stand
this Author better than
others do, nor because I thought
I did. But the same temptati∣on
which induced our Gran∣dame
Eve to eat fruit, prevaild
with me to read Horace, meer∣ly
because forbidden.
But the frequent Quotati∣on
of him by all sorts of inge∣nious
men, and the Hault-goust
which the wit and truth of his
excellent sayings gave, made
me languish till I had broken
through all the difficulties which

my imbecillity contended with,
and thrown my self on this au∣dacious
adventure.
In the prosecution whereof I
never blushd to ask the advice
or take the assistance of any per∣son
whom I thought able to con∣tribute
either. And among the
rest, of that indefatigable and
eminently learned person with
whom, by your indulgence and
his own condiscension I had the
honour and happiness to grow
acquainted, whom I found so
skill'd in all the difficulties of
this Poet, that he was to me more
then all the Voluminous Com∣mentators.
Sir, For my speedier dispatch
and your advantage, I made
bold to take in all such parts of
HORACE, as have been Eng∣lished
by the Lord Embassa∣dour
Fanshaw; and what were
omitted by him, I supplyed
with such as have been done
by Sir Thomas Hawkins, or
Dr. Holiday, or both, for they
are both the same; and whether
of the two is the Author, remains
to me undiscovered: What were
not touched by these, I gathe∣red
out of Mr. Cowleys and
other Printed Books; and such
as were not Translated by others,
my self and several friends of

mine at my request have at∣tempted:
De Arte Poetica be∣ing
long since Englished by that
great Master thereof B. Johnson,
I have borrowed to crown the
rest.
So that you will easily finde,
that as this Book consists of seve∣ral
men endeavors, so those se∣veral
men went several wayes;
but all studied to shun a nice
Pedantical Translation, which
Horace could not abide. By
reading all which you are cer∣tain
of two Pleasures, Liberty
of censuring, and variety of
matter.
And I have this felicity, that

if any dislike what is done, it
will not be safe for them to tra∣duce
it publickly, least they
should reproach some of the Un∣dertakers
to their faces; for we
are considerable for number and
quality, consisting of many per∣sons;
and those either Right
Honourable, Right Worship∣full,
Reverend, or (which is as
good) Well-beloved; and if I
for my part have herein played
the Fool, 'tis in very good Com∣pany.
Such as it is I expose it to
publick perusal, with this be∣coming
Confidence, that the
excellence of the Author will

make amends for the imper∣fections
of the Translators; and
having this in my prospect, that
HORACE may chance to find
as good fortune as his dear
friend VIRGIL had, who
being plundered of all his Or∣naments
by the old Trasla∣tours,
was restored to others
with double lustre by those
Standard-bearers of Wit and
Iudgment, Denham and Wal∣ler.
To which end I humbly
commend this rude Essay, to
those Persons whose Learning,
Wit, and Leisure shall ena∣ble
to do him such right as he
serves. And for a president, I

desire them to compare these
lines of Phaer,
This end had Priams destinies, all this chance him Fortune
sent,
When he the fire in Troy had seen, his Walls and Castles
rent,
That sometimes over Peoples proud, and Lands had raign'd
with fame
Of Asia Emperour great, now short on shore he lies with
shame,
His head besides his shoulders laid, his corps no more
of name.
with this done by Sir John Den∣ham,
Thus fell the King who yet surviv'd the State,
With such a signal and peculiar fate,
Under so vast a ruine, not a grave,
Nor in such flames a funeral fire to have:
He whom such Titles swelled, such power made proud,
To whom the Scepters of all Asia bow'd;
On the cold earth lies this neglected King,
A headless Carcass, and a uameless thing.
By which they may perceive
how highly Translations may be
improved. And if any Gentle∣men
will be so industrious and
kind, as to amend, or but to find
out the faults in this Essay (which
may easily be done) or furnish the
Stationer with any better against
the next Impression, they will be
so far from disobliging me, that I
invite them to it, conceiving it a
work by which they may gratifie
and oblige Posterity: And should
rejoyce to see these rude and

imperfect draughts, like the A∣thenian
ship so often and through∣ly
amended, that there shall not
an old plank remain therein: That
so these Poems which were so
acceptable to Augustus in their
native dress, might be so polishd
in our language, that they may be
look'd on by a more indulgent and
greater Prince than he was.
Perhaps it may be expected
that I should have embellished
(as they call it) this Address with
Witty Passages, and Rhetori∣cal
flowers; but indeed Sir, they
are grown quite out of fashion,
and I am heartily glad that there∣by
I am freed from a task which
I was so unfit for.
And now Sir, having tired
you with this flat Narrative, to
make you amends, I will make no
Address to the Gentle Reader;
only I declare to him and all the
World, that I profess my self, and
am what your Goodness has made
me,
Honored Mecaenas,
