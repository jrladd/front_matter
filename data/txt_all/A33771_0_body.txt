Most Honoured Sir,
NOtwithstanding the generall Dedication of this Her∣ball which you will sind at the Foot of my Epistle to the Reader, I have thought it absolutely necessary to ap∣ply my selfe to your Worship in Particular, humbly be∣seeching you to give me leave to commit it to your more immediate Protection, that in case it should meet with any malevolent Spirits, that should have any thoughts to cast forth their venemous detractions and aspersions upon it, the Luster of your name appearing in the Front, might cause them to vanish, no otherwise then the octurnall Spirits doe at the approach of the Sunne. That which imboldened me, though a stranger to you, to presume so much upon your goodnesse was the generall repute, that you have really deserved by those propitious Aspects, that the Noblenesse of your Nature hath vouchsafed to cast upon those, that bend their endeavour towards the advancement of any designe tending to the publique good, especially if it be in order to the laudable study of Physick, wherein you have ap∣proved your selfe a good Patriot, aswell as by those happy discoveries you have communicated to the World; but more especially in that rare cure of the Gout, which your Charity hath dispensed with so much successe and comfort to many that have been afflicted with that pain∣full disease. For as not only those that follow military imployments may be said to deserve well of their Countries, but also those that by a
 more contemplative kind of Life, or lesse Corporally active do lay out their Parts, and hazzard their Reputations by exposing their Labours to the view of the censorious multitude; So they that protect the latter are as worthily to be commended as they that command the former. And amongst the rest, Students in the Herbarary Art are as profitable Members as any other, for besides that they are Trumpets of Gods glory, setting forth it selfe so wonderfully in thsePraesentem{que} refert quaeli∣bet herba Deum. Vegetables, they are also by some, called the Handes of God, because they are his Instruments to apply those things unto Mankind, that he hath Created for their preservation. And in this respect, Physick may be said to be more effectuall then Divinity it selfe, for though the Charmer or Preacher charme never so wisely, yet if the Auditor be not compos mntis, but like the Deafe Adder, he will lose his labour▪ But such are the Powerfull vertues of Herbs administred by a skillfull Professor, that they will even restore those that have lost their Senses, and so not only make them capable of good Counsell and wholesome in∣struction, but cause both mind and body to resume their pristine Integrity. And thus in all Humility, I lay it down at your Worships feet, not without some hopes that you will be pleased to accept it, and to pardon the boldnesse of
Sir,
