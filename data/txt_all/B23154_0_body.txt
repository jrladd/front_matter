OUr dear Sisters in the Co∣venant of Light & Life, wherewith God, our God, hath visited us, and given us the Knowledge of himself in the Face of Jesus Christ, by the re∣velation of his Spirit, and are come to a good Understanding of his Sufferings, Death and Re∣surrection, and this not by a hear-say, or reading only there∣of,
 as all the Antichristian Brood hath, but through the free and universal Grace are brought not only into the Fellowship of his Sufferings, where we have seen him whom we have pierced, and mourned over him, but by faith∣ful Obedience to the Spirit that raised Jesus from the Dead, are come to be Witnesses, that he which was dead, is alive, and lives for evermore; and because he lives, we live also, and are Partakers of the Love of the Father, which extends it self to and through the whole Creation, and in the Aboundings thereof we cannot but bring forth of his Mercies, and have the sensible feeling that it endures forever, and who
 ministers therein will not be weary of Well-doing; and in that which has strengthned us thereto is our Salutation of un∣feigned Love to you, declaring, that your Epistles from Rode-Island, New-York, and there∣away, were very joyous unto us, that the Lord has called his Daughters from far to the Exer∣cises of Love and Mercies to all that stand in need, and be∣ing sate down with us, we shall sit at the one Table, where the Bread is broken that comes down from God, and whoever eats thereof shall never dye; and to the Faith we are come, and the fulfilling of the Promises we witness, and are yet waiting for,
 as being assured, God will give unto him (in whom we have believed) the Heathen for his In∣heritance, and the utmost Parts of the Earth for his Possession: and what if the Lord will honour you, though weak, to bring forth of his Strength among the Ig∣norant and Unbelieving, who have been hardned and shut up in Darkness by the Professing Christians, that talked of a God, of Goodness and Mercy, but brought forth bitter Fruits of co∣vetous practices, self-love & cruelty towards others, not bearing his I∣mage that is sent of the Father, whom we know to be holy and harmles, gathering out of the cru∣elty and violence, that hath entred
 by transgression, up into his Life & Image, that was before trans∣gression was, by the Restorer of all things, Christ Jesus: And so, dear Sisters, we are perswaded you know and feel your high & holy Call, that by believing in the light come to receive of his life; and living Fruits all such do and will bring forth unto God: so your Bounty & Mercy will de∣clare whose you are; for the life of Jesus is the Light of men, and in this Life stands our Fellow∣ship with you, and were glad the Servant of the Lord put this little Book into our hands, a few Widows, that trust in God, that we might with it send our Gree∣ting, and to re-mind you what
 we have experienced in near 20 years service in our Womens Mee∣tings, that though some storms have beset us, scorns and contemnings, slittings & blusterings, winds from the high and self-wise ones devising against us, yet the lowly & faithful have stood, and grown over all, and ye defence of Abraham has been upon us, and his reward has been and is with us, and it is exceeding great, crowning our Labours of Love in his renewed Power and Presence, that is Almighty and Everlasting; into whose Hand of Preservation we commit you, wishing increase of Grace & Glory to be pour'd forth and abide upon you, and remain your Friends and Sisters in that which never changes nor waxes old.
