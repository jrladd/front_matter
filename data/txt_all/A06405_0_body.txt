RELIGIOVS
BROTHERS,
I send you heer
a Manuall of spiri∣uall
Exercises, set forth some
eares agoe, in the Spanish
ongue, by Fa Thomas de Villa∣astin
of your Society, now

trāslated into English: which
doubtlesse will produce spe∣ciall
vertues in you, who haue
the same spirit, wherewith it
was written. And this hath
moued me to present the same
to you, in whom I hoped my
small labours heerein should
be most abundantly recom∣pensed,
by the increase of
your spirituall Comfort and
Profit.
I was furthermore indu∣ced
heereunto, because I dee∣med
no Booke more fit to be
presented vnto you then this,
being deriued, as it seemeth,
frō the very fountaine of your
holy Patriarke S. Ignatius his
Spirituall Exercises. And I
could not doubt, but you the

Sonnes of so worthy a Father
would receaue with great af∣ection
and tendernes, an Or∣hane
of so worthy a Parent.
Another reason was, for
that I hauing receaued so ma∣ny,
and continuall benefites
from your Society (to whom
I am euer, more then most ob∣iged)
and neuer yet finding
opportunity to shew my selfe
gratefull, answerable to my
desires: I thought this small
occasion not to be neglected,
n offering so meane a present
vnto you, in signe at least, of
gratefull memory towardes
your Holy Order.
In this Manuall, you
may behold and contemplate
ost perfectly, the liuely ver∣tues

of our Sauiour, & of his
Blessed Mother, propounded
vnto you for your dayly Ex∣ercise
of Meditation. Heere
may you learne to follow, and
trace out the footsteps of true
Pouerty, Humility, Charity,
Obedience, & the like. Heere
may you tast spiritually of the
most pleasant fruite, which
from these deuout and piou
Meditations is gathered. In a
word, heere may you exercise
your selues in all the heroicall
acts of Vertue, which our
Lord & Maister Christ Iesus,
the most exact & perfect pat∣terne
of all Perfection, hath
left vnto vs for example.
I will not be tedious,
thereby to detayne you from

the triall of what I haue pro∣mised,
by meditating the My∣steries
that ensue. It shall suf∣fice
me, that you wilbe plea∣sed
to tak in good part this
my least labour, and now and
then, in these and other you
deuotions, to remember
