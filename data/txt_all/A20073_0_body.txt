SIR,
IS it not strange that an Owle should write an Almanacke? Yet why not, as well as a Crow speake Latin to Caesar? And why not an Owle prog∣nosticate wonders, which are sure to happen this yeere, as for Astrologicall wizzards to shoot threating Calenders out of their inke-pots at the world, and yet when they hit, their fillups hurt nothing? Lyes are as well acquainted with Astronomers, as othes are with Souldiers, or as owing money is familiar to Courtiers: But Madge-Owlet fetches her predi∣ctions out of an vpper roome in Heauen, where

neuer any common star-catcher was garretted before. Had I a bird of Paradice, I should gladly send her flying to you, and therefore I hope that your acceptance of this Owle (though shee be none of mine, but hiding her broad face vnder my Eeues by chance) will keepe petty idle birds from wondring about her. I wish euery yeere you are to liue, to begin and end with you, as merrily as this Prognostication takes her ayme to make you, and that I may cease to be, when I giue ouer from being
