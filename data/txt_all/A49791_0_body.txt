May it please your Grace,
THis little Book, which shews what Methods have been used in France to support true Honor, by the Suppression of Duels, that are the effects of a false and spurious Bravour, aspires so naturally to
your Graces Protection, as being, under his most Gracious Majesty, the Chief Judge and Conservator of the Honor of the English Nobi∣lity; that the Presumption is only in him who humbly offers to present it: Yet, my Lord, since the Exer∣cise, as well as Jurisdiction of Ho∣nor, is equally hereditary in your Grace, give me leave to hope that your Baton may be extended for pardoning, no less than for com∣manding: And that you will make it appear, that you excel as much in Condescension as Dignity, by smiling favourably upon this sub∣missive Address of,
My Lord,
