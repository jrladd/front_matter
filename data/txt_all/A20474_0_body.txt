THE Apostolicall times, from the Apostolicall doc∣trine (Most Reverend) haue incited me to write this Probleme. It may seeme strange to some, that future heresyes should be thus preuented: but howsoeuer it seeme strange to some, it is not strange to the enlightened and sanctified: for first, he that knewe what was to come, endited
the holy scriptures: he I say that know∣eth  &c. Quae sunt, et erunt, quaeque ante fuere.
Secondly in those tymes in which the holy Scriptures were written, there were the same wits, the same corrup∣tion, the same enemy of mankind, nam∣ly the diuell, which are in our tymes: therefore no maruell, if there be the same opinions, The heathen philosopher said that the same opinions in philoso∣phy were renewed and so it is in diuini∣ty. the Anabaptists haue renewed the opinions of the Enthusiastes. the Li∣bertines defend Pelagius his opinions. and haue not the Vbiquitaryes also brought Eutyches his opinion againe vpon the stage? Cut off Hydras heads, and more will springe vp. I will not an∣swer this pointe in any more words. It remayneth then that I craue pardon, for that I haue troubled your Grace with so small a Treatise: but your Lord-shipe
knoweth that . If therefore Bene be in this booke, and Well be in this worke, it is certaine that much is in the same. But this I leaue to your Grace to iudge of, as I doe allso to the Church of God. The spirits of the Prophets are subiect to the Prophets. The Lord of Lordes multiply his graces vpon you to the good of his Church, and your euerlasting Sal∣uation.
