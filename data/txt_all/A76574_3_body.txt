THe Hebrew Child (God's and the Virgin's Son)
Entred the Lists, when twice six Years had Run;
Gravel'd the Rabbies, 'maz'd the standers by,
And so Revealed his Veil'd Divinity.
Ev'n so, when Tender Years, and Youthful Braines,
Declining lighter Sports, engage their paines
To follow thoughtful Fancy, and to sease on
The Sacred Matters of Profounder Reason:
Judgement, with due proport'on, will incline,
To say they'r Acted by a Sp'rit Divine.
Greenness of Youth, matters Sublimitie,
(Both thine) compar'd, wee'l say no less of Thee.
Goe on, Brave Soul, Maugre Contempt, and Suit
Thy Vernal Blossoms with Autumnal Fruit.
