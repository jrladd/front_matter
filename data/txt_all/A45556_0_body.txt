Worthy Friends,
PArdon me that I joyn you together in one Dedication, since God's ordination, and your mutual affection have made you one. It was your undeserved respect ho∣noured me to be the Instrument of accom∣plishing your nuptials. It was my Cordial desire of testi∣fying my gratitude, and promoting your welfare, made me so bold as to become your humble remembrancer of those duties, which I doubt not you both knew, and resol∣ved to practice before. Finally it was your unexpected acceptance and approbation of my weak labours put you on requiring, and me by that means on effecting the pub∣lication of them.
What hath caused my delay in fulfilling your desire, I suppose you already know: Being now through God's won∣derful mercy raised from my sick nay almost dying bed, I have made what hast I could to finish the work.
This plain and home-spun piece, such as it is, I present Sir, to your candid eye, Madam to your fair hands, to∣gether with my humble thanks for your noble favours.

As the hearing it did affect you, so I hope the reading it will profit you, and not you alone, but others who shall vouchsafe the perusal of it.
And now Courteous Friends, my hearts desire and prayer to God for you is, that you may be ravisht each with others love, that your quiver may be full of those Prov. 5. 19. Psal. 127. 5. 122. 7. harmlesse arrowes, to wit, Children; that peace may be within your walls and plenteousnesse continue in your habitation: Finally that you may live long to∣gether in Earth, and for ever in Heaven. I rest,
