My gracious Lo. and Mr.
SIR,
ALL eyes are vpon you. Those your sweete graces of nature, and ingenuous dispositions to good∣nes, makes men looke vpon your worthy Brother in your princely selfe; holding you the true inhe∣ritor of his vertues as of his fortunes, and making full account that he had no oddes of you but in yeares. If you wil not haue them fall short in their reckoning, this Imprimis of your hopefull begin∣nings, must be continued with many Items of vertuous proceedings, and closed vp with a Sum∣ma-totalis of all princely worthinesse: So shall you like a great and high Steward (as you are) perfect the account you are to make, to your King and to your countrey. Hereunto Example and Pre∣cept

will enable you. Examples you may haue in your owne family, and (which few Princes haue had) in your owne time. Your matchlesse Bro∣ther for these seuen yeares to come, may take you by the hand, and leade you in the faire apprenti∣sage of all honour and vertue: and then your roy∣all Father may for many and many yeares (wee hope and pray) be a liuing and liuely Mirrour vnto you of Pietie, Wisedome, Iustice, Clemen∣cie, and all other regall endowments fit for the high calling to which you are borne. As for Pre∣cepts, you may haue them from those that haue worthily that place of seruice about you, besides others you shall meete with in approoued Au∣thors, whereof I humbly tender you this Epi∣tome. It was your Brothers, and sues among other his seruants for entertainment: hoping vnder the Impression of his worthy memorie, and Stampe of your gracious fauour to passe currant.
