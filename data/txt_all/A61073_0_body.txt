May it please your Grace:
USe hath become a Cu∣stome for Writers to shroud their Pens and Parts under the Patro∣nage of some Honourable and se∣cure

Protection; by which, my Lord, I am emboldened to suppli∣cate your Graces favour; my At∣tempt carrying with it these two Reasons to mitigate my Presum∣ption: First, that these my Eja∣culations and Meditations being Divine, they pretend a Title to your Graces Cognizance; with whose most learned Name being presented to the world, they will undoubtedly sinde an Acceptance among Pious and Judicious Rea∣ders. The other Reason is, That since your Grace was acquainted with my deceased Grand - father Mr. John Speed, the English Chronologer, and laborious Ge∣nealoger, the Author (and this his Enchiridion, he) humbly hopes may obtain your favourable A∣spect:

For which causes, I am apt to promise to my self a fair Inter∣pretation, though they are the Issues of my Retirements in a Pri∣son; since from the like place Al∣mighty God by a Miracle did redeem St. Peter, and our Blessed Saviour deigned to love poor La∣zarus, though in a low conditi∣on: though I write from a Prison to the Palace of England's renow∣ned Metropolitan, it is, however, to testifie the zeal I have for your Graces merits. May your Ho∣nours, as your hours, increase in this Age; may your glorious Me∣mory be admired in futurity: And when your Grace shall ex∣change your Terrestial Theatre for a Coelestial Throne, may a Crown of Glory to eternity a∣dorn

your Vertues; which is and shall be the continual Prayer of,
Most Reverend, Learned, and most Pious Patron,
