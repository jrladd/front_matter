Courteous Reader,
I Have written to thee now about
the Barren Fig-tree, or how it
will fare with the Fruitless Pro∣fessor
that standeth in the Vineyard
of God.
Of what Complexion thou art, I
cannot certainly divine, but the Pa∣rable
tells thee, that the Cumber-ground
must be cut down.
A Cumber-ground Professor, is
not only a provocation to God, a
stumbling-block to the World, and a
blemish to Religion, but a snare to
his own Soul also. Though his Excel∣lency
mount up to the Heavens, and

his Head reach unto the Clouds, yet
he shall perish for ever, like his own
dung, they that have seen him, shall
say, Where is he? Job 20. 6.
Now they count it pleasure to riot
in the day-time, 2 Pet. 2. 13, 14. but
what will they do when the Ax is fetcht
out?
The Tree whose Fruit withereth, is
reckoned a Tree without Fruit, a Tree
twice dead, one that must be pluck'd
up by the Roots, Jude 12.
O thou Cumber-ground, God ex∣pects
Fruit, God will come seeking
Fruit shortly.
My Exhortation therefore is to
Professors, that they look to it, that
they take heed.
The Barren Fig-tree in the Vine∣yard,
and the Bramble in the Wood,
are both prepared for the Fire.
Profession is not a Covert to hide
from the Eye of God; nor will it pal∣liate
the revengeful Threatning of his
Justice, he will command to cut it
down shortly.

The Church and a Profession, are
the best of places for the Upright,
but the worst in the World for the
Cumber-ground: He must be cast,
as profane, out of the Mount of God;
Cast, I say, over the Wall of the
Vineyard, there to wither; thence to
be gathered and burned. It had been
better for them that they had not
known the Way of Righteousness,
2 Pet. 2. 21. And yet if they had
not, they had been damned; but it is
better to go to Hell without, than in,
or from under a Profession: These
shall receive greater Damnation,
Luke 20. 47.
If thou be a Professor, read and
tremble; If thou be Profane, do so
likewise. For if the righteous scarce∣ly
be saved, where shall the Ungod∣ly
and Sinners appear? Cumber-ground,
Take heed of the Ax; Bar∣ren
Fig-tree, beware of the Fire.
But I will keep thee no longer out of
the Book; Christ Jesus, the Dresser

of the Vine-yard, take care of thee,
dig about thee, and dung thee, that
thou maist bear Fruit: That when the
Lord of the Vineyard cometh with
his Ax to seek for Fruit, or pronounce
the Sentence of Damnation on the
Barren Fig-tree, thou mayest escape
that judgment. The Cumber-ground
must to the Wood-pile, and thence
to the Fire.
Farewel.
Grace be with all them that love
our Lord Jesus in Sincerity.
Amen.
