My Lord,
BEfore this Treatise Presumes to hazard it self in the Readers hands, its highest. Ambition is to lye at Your Honours Feet. What in the like Case was once said to a Per∣son of Grandeur, Qui apud te audent di∣cere, Magnitudinem tuam ignorant; qui non audent, Humanitatem, is my Apology for this Loyal Confidence. Were not the Scales of Justice in Your hands; or were the Tribunal, which You Illustrate, under a Cloud for want of a Luminary to en∣lighten

the Law; yet such is the Conquest Your Victorious Condescensions have made on all not-disingenuous hearts; Such Your exact Inspection into Men and Man∣ners; Such Your depth of Just and Success∣full Counsels; Such Your serious Recrea∣tion in the more Noble Arts and Sciences; Such Your Dexterity in Reconciling Law to Equity, by Your Great Prudence in the Conduct of Juridical Contestations; and All under the immediate Ʋmbrage of Majesty; That the Insignificant Author, doubting the Euroclydons of a Censorious Age, and Am∣bitious of his Obligations to Your Lord∣ship, humbly Craves Your Pardon for pre∣suming to take Sanctuary under Your Pro∣tection of Equity, in case this ORPHANS LEGACY proves not so Good in Law, as in the most Critical Construction may In∣demnifie,
MY LORD,
