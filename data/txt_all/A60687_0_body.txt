My Lord;
I Have obeyed the Command of your Lordship, and the Court of Aldermen, in this Publication, which will Vindi∣cate my Reputation, to all so∣ber Men, from those Calumnies which are cast upon me. I deli∣vered nothing in this Sermon, (to which there is such unjust Exception taken) but what I ought to have said, in any City or Corporation in the King's Dominions, on the like occasion.
And had the Citizens been as re∣ally united in their Hearts, as Truth and Honesty are joyned together in this plain Discourse there would have been no such Reproaches. That London may so know the Things which belong to H Peace, that they may never be hid from her Eyes: And that suc∣ceeding Magistrates may follow your Example in your Great Station, is the Prayer of,
My LORD,
