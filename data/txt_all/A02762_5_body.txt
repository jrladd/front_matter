WHilst thoughts of flam's & not consuming fire
(Where tortur'd soul's howle, yel, crie, neuer die)
Inflam'd with breath of Iah's deuouring ire,
(That rents the rockes, and makes the mountaines flie)
Did wound with feares my soule, yet you on hie,
With Eagles wings I wish'd might mount away:
Within the Vaile (at last) to dwell for aye:
Such gnashing, lashing, howling, nere to trie,
Whil'st Sunne-shine light your face doth yet array,
And Bridegroomes comming hath not shut the gate,
That restlesse cries, (which neuer came too late,)
Might tempests stay, force heauen, and make you way.
And (if you will beleeue me) heere I vow,
My censer alwayes shall keepe Wrath from you.
