My Lord,
THough I am almost ashamed to make my Address to your Lordship with so small a Treatise as this, yet ha∣ving no more of it finished, and this little being the Foundation of the rest, I hope your Lordship will accept of it as some acknowledgement of those great Condescen∣tions with which your Lordship hath been
pleas'd to honour so mean a Person as my self.
I might indeed, if I had conceived it better so to do, have kept it by me, till it had grown more complete, and so have made it a more suitable Present to a Person of your Lordship's Character in the Church and in the Court: But I considered that what I now humbly offer to your Lordship and the Publick, must be my Measure in the following Tracts, and so may need the advice of others as well as my own thoughts to perfect it, and I may gain this ad∣vantage by the separate Edition of it, to know from some of my Friends, what in it is weak or imperfect: In which if your Lordship will fur∣ther vouchsafe your admonition, it will make what remains the more fit to be presented to your Lordship, by

Welwynne, Nov. 2. 1685.
