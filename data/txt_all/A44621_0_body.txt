My LORD,
WHatsoever Reception this Poem meets from the World, my De∣dication cannot be censur'd, since made to you; who are justly ren∣dred no less great in Heroick Exam∣ples; than you are Illustrious by Birth;

whil'st you so abound in all the Vertues of your Antient and Noble Prede∣cessors, that you are beforehand with Honor, e'r you possess those high titles which are so justly your expectation, and earnest desires of your Name, to see in due time accomplished in you: And as an Heroick Poem ought to be a Present to the most conspicuous in me∣rit, so it cannot but receive some credit in being addressed to you; as you have a Title from the worth and greatness of your own Actions, to the Patronage of all worthy Subjects, for which cause you may less blame my Ambition, in de∣dicating to you this Poem, being assured, inyou, are summ'd all the Virtues of its Bittish Hero's, which the best abili∣ties

of my Muse have been able (though with the advantage of fiction) to make their glories: And if you judge it worth the entertaining some minutes of your leisure, I shall think it wants no Dig∣nity, it being my greater ambition, to publish my respects to you, than to court fame, which the world so spa∣ringly bestowes, as if there were no consideration for desert in any kind; nor are the spirits of men less sa∣tisfied in any accomplishment, than in the value of wit, which seldom misses the Allay of detraction, as it passes the world; where if it meets a due Reception from the Generous, and truely Ingenious, the labour of lines is enough rewarded; amongst

whom, as I have placed your worth the first in my thoughts, so I commend this Poem to your judicious accep∣tance, with all other acknowlegements becoming
My Lord
