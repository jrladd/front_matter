PRINCES, Great Sir, of superlative Esteem have to their Glory promoted the Excellencies

of Science, and are accor∣dingly conspicuous in Re∣cords of Fame: If they have been Illustrious in their sphere, the Court; they have not judg'd them∣selves greater under a Ca∣nopy of State, than when their Grandeur has Flou∣rish'd, with the Incourage∣ment and Growth of the Arts of Knowledge.
And tho' Princes, as to the conduct of their Affairs, may by their Prudence select their proper Mini∣sters, and Courtly obser∣vance

of such on whom they confer the Grace of Officiary Dignities: 'Tis not to be denied, That Sci∣ence, without other Court∣ship than its own Merit; ought to be an especial Favourite of the Soul, and chiefly so valu'd by the most Eminent of Men.
A Motive of such high Importance, that it caus'd the Great Alexander to de∣clare, That he had rather be a Prince of Science, than Commander of the vast Dominions Possess'd by

him: And doubtless, he in great part, made good the Expression, both as to his own Abilities, and the Improvements he receiv'd from his Tutor Aristotle; whose Learned Works had never been so far dif∣fus'd in the World, had they not been incourag'd and assisted by the Coun∣tenance and Power of his famous Pupil.
The next great Example was Julius Caesar, who is mention'd, by Plutarch, as a Parallel in Valour and

Warlike Conquest's to the Mighty Alexander; but far surpassing the conduct of his Arms and Counsels of State, as to the perpe∣tual Memorial of his Glo∣ry and Erudite Accomplish∣ments; Men famous in Mathematical Science were Authoris'd by him, to a∣mend the then Erroneous computation of the Sun's Annual Revolution; to which at this Day, in the Julian Year, we own our Calendar, and the Month of July dedicated to his

everlasting Renown, in the Year that was Rectified by his Imperial Command: A work transcending the greatest of his Earthly Fame, as to the height of the Sun, the Sovereign of Light, his Name is exalted in Story.
If the Great Julius Caesar from his Soveraign Dig∣nity and vast Ingenuity of Mind, was signally accom∣plish'd to patronise so sub∣lime a Performance; what could recompence the De∣serts of such famous Per∣sons,

who were his sub∣servient Assistants, or as it were the Ministers of Heaven, in order to give the Sun's Ecliptick Year a renovated Conduct and Glory: Of which Persons Sosigenes, a Mathematician of Aegypt is chiefly men∣tion'd.
But were his Astrono∣mical Abilities compar'd with admir'd Tycho, who was of Noble Extraction in the same Nation where the many great Predeces∣sors of your Royal High∣ness

had Dominion and Birth; 'tis not to be doubt∣ed that the accurate Skill and Observations of Tycho the Dane had exceeded So∣sigenes the Aegyptian: And possibly, had he been con∣sulted, might have furnish'd the World with a more perfect Computation of the Year, than is, either the Ju∣lian or Gregorian Account. His admirable Skill, Vigi∣lancy and Experience, im∣ploy'd Twenty Years in Astronomical Science, did in a manner Crown his vast

Endeavours: There being no Observations, at this Day, that can compare with those made by unpa∣rallell'd Tycho.
And 'tis not improba∣ble, amongst his Astrolo∣gical Predictions, were they known to us, that he signally Presag'd the happy Alliance of Your Royal Highness both to the Da∣nish and English Throne: And how, in future Time, you would be no less a Fa∣vourer and Promoter of the Excellencies of Mathe∣matical

Learning, than any of Your Monarchial Pre∣decessors.
Nor can the extraordi∣nary Dignity be unknown to Your Royal Highness, by which that Science does, beyond all others, advance the Elevation of the Eyes and Heart, in order to the Divine Contemplation of the wonderful Movements and Beings of the Celestial Orbs, however far distant from us.
If the Sun Revolves in his Diurnal Circumference

more than Sixteen Milli∣ons of English Miles; to what admirable, tho' less proportion, does then a∣mount the Period he makes in every Hour, and Minute of Time.
Insomuch, that it may be Affirm'd, that by Astro∣nomical Calculations in a high Measure, we are Di∣vinely taught to be more perspicuous Admirers of the Heavenly Works and Conduct of the Almighty, than otherwise could be discern'd by us: Which

wonderful Movements of the Sun, Planets and Stars, together with the Benigni∣ties of Heaven incident to their Illuminations, Cau∣ses and Effects, are, to our Admiration, with such a stupendious Facility Dis∣pos'd, and Ordain'd above; that it can be attributed to no other Original, than the Operations of Incom∣prehensible Providence.
But of what Substance, and Manner of Existence, the Celestial Luminaries, together with the Incom∣mensurable

Orbs, Height and Distances in which they Revolve, may be de∣fin'd; are Thoughts that have been the inextricable Astonishment of Learned Pens, as they have been pos'd to determine the Na∣ture of their Essence and other Proprieties.
Notwithstanding, it ap∣pears, That by Writers of Refin'd Judgments, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, with whatsoever may be denominated the Orbs a∣bove; are deem'd, in a man∣ner,

by them either spiri∣tual Appearances, or equi∣valently such, for want of other extrordinary Epithet, or Definement suitable to the Nature of their Es∣sence and Motion; by reason that their Substance does not admit any visible Change, or Alteration in them: Which would be perceptible, were they not essentially distinct from all Elementary Composi∣tions.

These Instances in brief, I thought fit to present to Your Royal Highness, as preparatory to Your In∣spection of such Particu∣lars as I have Written in this Book, on the Philo∣sophy, and Mathematical Passages Inscrib'd by Des-Cartes: Which are Hum∣bly Dedicated to the peru∣sal of Your Royal High∣ness, by
