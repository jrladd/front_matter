Courteous Reader,
THy kind acceptance of the First Part, hath incoura∣ged me to go forward with a Second, which I here present thee with; being now indifferently confident that it will be no worse used by Thee then the Brother of it was: I hope there is ne∣ver a Part of it, in which thou wilt not find somthing that will please thy Fancy: But for such as profess to be of the zealou∣sest sort of people, and make use of the ge∣stur of casting up the whites of their eys, when they intend to tell you a notoriously, I would not have them to study in it, by reason it speaks a great deal of truth, and

will not be so suitable to their humors; be∣cause it is a bundle of matter that is scram∣bled together, which could not be wrapt up in such clean linnen, or drest up in such holding forth Language and pious hypocrisie, as such generally make use of: It is only fit for truehearted Souls that will solace their Spirits with a little laughter, and never busie their brains with the sub∣version of State and Church government: And being well received by such, it is as much as is expected by him who is thine Farewell.
