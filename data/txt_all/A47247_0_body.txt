Great SIR,
IT has been my Unhap∣piness to be Discharg∣ed of late (though too soon) from Your Majestie's Service in a Military Capacity, In which Sphere, I have unerringly moved in the Service of the Royal Family, even from my Childhood to this time; Only, after the Happy Re∣volution, I served for some time, in another Capacity, for being turn'd out of the Late Kings Army in Ire∣land, by Tirconnel, (as generally all Protestants were) I retiered with my Family into Scotland, And, from thence, I was remitted, and order∣ed
by the then Privy Council, to re∣side at the head Quarter of the En∣glish Army with the Duke of Schom∣berg, and to give account to the Council, from time to time, how all Affairs went in Ireland; Which I did, till Your Majestie's Arrival in that Kingdom, in June 1690. And by the same Authority, I had the great Honour and Satisfaction of at∣tending Your Majesty, in the same Post, thorow all that Campaign, till Your Return to England.
And in my Reteirment, this last Summer, I happily met with The Late History of Europe, Being, A full Nar∣ration of all Memorable Transactions, Both Civil and Military, that have happened for Twenty one Years, preceeding September 1697.
The perusal of it pleased me so well, As I thought it worth my time to Compendize it; Which hav∣ing accomplished, I began to consi∣sider, to whom I should Dedicate
my Puny Labours, when reflecting on the whole Series of the History; And finding WILLIAM HENRY (by the Title of Prince of Orange, for the first Twelve Years; And the same WILLIAM, by the more Splendid Title, of KING of GREAT BRITAIN &c. for the last Nine of the One and Twenty Years) to be a person, who had alwayes made an E∣minent Figure, amongst the greatest Neighbouring Princes and Poten∣tats; And been deeply interested in most of the Grand Affairs Treated of in the History: Without any He∣sitation, I concluded the Dedication most properly, and absolutely due to this most Illustrious WILLIAM.
SIR, I must acknowledge it, far above the rate of an ordinary Confi∣dence, my presuming to Address Your Majesty, with so mean a Pre∣sent; But, I am Animated thereto, by what I have Read in Commenda∣tion of Alexander the Great, who being
presented with a small Basket of Fruit by a Poor Woman, Generously accepted of it, as a Testimony of her Real Kindness, Supposing, If she had any thing of greater value, she would as freely have given it.
Now, SIR, As Your Majesty has alwayes Emulated, (if not Ex∣cell'd) this great HERO, in all Princely and Glorious Atcheivments; So I hope, with him, You will Vouchafe to accept of this small Mite, tendered by him, who (with the deepest Humilty, and sincerest Affection) Prostrats Himself, and His all, at Your Royal Footstool; And who cannot affirm a greater Truth, than that He is.
Great SIR.
