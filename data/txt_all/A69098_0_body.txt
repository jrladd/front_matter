THE aunciente Philosophers (most excellent Princesse and soueraigne Lady) haue ben of opinion, that the natural bodie of Man vvith the offices and duties of the parts therof ioy∣ned and vnited togythers to a cōmon function, do represent the lyuely image and very fi∣gure of a good and perfect cō∣mon vvealth: in the vvhiche their iudgement they seemed to be men of a maruelous vvis∣dome, and of great vnderstanding and knovvledge in the con∣templation of diuine and humain things. For they did perceiue and see, that in the body of man (representing the parts & mem∣bers of the cōmon vvealth (as I haue said) there be diuers partes of diuers and sundry actions and motions, differing muche in forme and numbre, vvhich being knit togethers, and consenting in one vniformitie to the common benefite of the vvhole, doo shevv a maruellous forme of a common vvealthe, and there can not be imagined a greater concord than is proportioned by the freendly vnitie of these diuers and contrary members. For there is suche a mutuall compassion in the sayd partes and members one vvith an other (as it vvere by one common feeling and be¦ing in them all) that no one part can tast of pleasure or pain, (if
 they be liuely members, vvhich els are to be cut of, for infecting the reste) but the others must of necessitie be partakers of the same. And as in the body of man also (vvhiche Plato figureth to be the lesse vvorlde) the immortal soule, is the chief and most excellente parte, vvhiche neuer ceasseth but is continually mo∣uing, and euer occupied in imaginatiō of great and high things, prouidently forseeing and diligently deuising vvhat is to be es∣chued and vvhat is to be folovved, and is alvvays prompt & redy to moue and stirre vp the faculties and membres of the sayd bo∣dy to execute those things vvhiche shal be moste metest for the same: Euen so in the great vvorld, by the vvisdom of god and the vniuersal consent of men, is elected and chosen one principal mā (in noblenesse and vertue surpassing the reste) to beare the like rule and authoritie in the body of euery cōmon vvelth, as the in∣tellectiue soule doth in the mēbers of the natural body of mā: to vvhō is giuen the name of a king or prince, and to him as to the vvorthiest part of the societie of men, God and nature haue gi∣uen the preeminēce and authoritie to rule and cōmaund al, as by vvhose prouidence and vvisdom the cōmon vvelth shold vniuer∣sally prosper and florish: and therfore as he is for his vertues and noblenesse set and cōstituted in the chief place of rule & gouer∣nement, so he ought to excel in the same, and to be a folovver of that, for the vvhich he is chiefly elected and chosen and that his vvel doing may be an exāple to the meaner membres to follovv the same: the true portraict & very image of vvhiche princely e∣state, and vvhat hath bin the cause of such choice & electiō, this present author (intituled Chelidonius Tigurinus, Of the institu∣tion of christian Princes. &c.) amōgs other matters doth maruel∣lous liuely set forth & describe, vvith al the ornaments & attire of vertue mete for the same, as any pen cā declare, or any hart cā vvish or desire, vvhich state being in al points in ful perfection, he extolleth to be so noble & so high a degree of being, as none other in the terrestrial vvorld, is or may be comparable to it. In the discourse vvherof (most noble Princesse) is vouched a great nūbre of famous authors, asvvel sacred as prophane, beautified and enriched vvith many vvorthy sayings and notable lessons, in
 the vvhich (ouer & besides the fitnesse and aptnesse of the phra∣ses, and the maiestie of the sentences therein conteyned) is hid∣den vnder the barke of the vvords therof, a diuine preeminence and authoritie mixed vvith a certaine quickenesse of speeche to reproue vice (yea ready to applye the cauterie, and to pull vp the same by the rootes) vvhere the offences appeare to be inue∣terate and incurable, alvvayes obseruing suche a modestie and reuerence tovvards Princes and Magistrates, as it shoulde seeme rather to be much comfort to their harts, thā any vvays offen∣siue or greuous. And bicause the vvel doings of the good and vertuous, and the disorder of the euil & vvicked might appeare to al posteritie, that they may lerne therby to folovv the one, & to leue the other, this author in this his said discourse (most gra∣cious princesse) hath set forth as it vver to the eie, hovv that ma∣ny being descended of base & vnknovvn bloud, through their vertue, great valiantnesse and vvorthie acts, haue of a very smal beginning, ben aduanced to this noble estate of kings and prin∣ces, vvho after they had atchieued the place of rule and gouer∣nement, by continuing their noblenesse and vvorthinesse, in or∣dering and vsing their authoritie vvel and prudently, haue meri∣ted immortall fame and prayse: and hovv that some others do∣ing the contrary, vvere (by the iust iudgement of God) shame∣fully ouerthrovvn and cast dovvn from high estate and degree, to great vvretchednesse and miserie, to their great reproche and ignomie for euer: by vvhich exāples the good may lerne to en∣crease in vertue and noblenesse, and the vicious and insolent see the frutes of their vvickednesse, and perceyue hovv that naugh∣tie dooings haue alvvayes naughtie endes. And in the treatise of Peace and Warre, (most noble Princesse) added to this sayd Author by the translater therof out of the Latin into the french tong, there is at large set foorth the benefits and commodities of the one, and the discommodities and enormities of the o∣ther: vvhereby all Kings and Princes may rather be moued to embrace and maynteyne peace and quietnesse (as things moste necessarie for all common vvealths) than any vvays be inclined to vvarre and crueltie (moste pernicious and hurtfull) vvhiche
 bringeth nothing else but murthering of innocentes, rauishing of honest vviues and maidens, burning, spoyling and destroying of countreys, euen the very frutes of vvarre, and yet commonly that vvhiche is gotten vvith muche paynes, great expenses, and vnmercyfull effusion of christian bloud, is oftentymes in one moment lost againe. And therfore more praise shall those prin∣ces deserue, that leaue their kingdomes to their successors quiet and vvelthy, than those that for the conquest of others haue im∣pouerished and disturbed their ovvne. And bycause this sayde treatise of Peace and vvarre dothe declare both the extremities as vvell vvhat number of beautifull cities haue ben edified, and vvhat greate countreys haue ben enriched by peace and quiet∣nesse, as also vvhat goodly regions and prouinces haue ben de∣stroyed and ouerthrovvne by stryfe and vvarre, it is very neces∣sary for all Princes and Magistrates to spende some little tyme to reade the same, to the end they may thereby take occasion so honourably to leade their liues, as after their deathes they may shyne to their posteritie, and vvinne thereby euerlasting fame and renoume. And in the other treatise of the daunger and hurt that doth grovv to a common vvelth by incontinencie, and of the commendation of Mariage (added also to this Au∣thor by the said translater out of the latin into the French tong) is shevved and manifested (moste vvorthy Princesse,) by many fearefull and horrible examples, hovve that the Lorde God a∣boue all other sinnes, hath most greuously plagued the vvorlde in all estates from age to age, for that abhominable and filthie sinne of incontinencie, yea euen to the vtter subuersion of ma∣ny noble regions and kingdomes, vvith the rooting out of the posteritie of their kings and princes for euer. For the auoyding vvherof, he hath appoynted and ordeyned that holy and hono∣rable state of matrimonie, into the vvhiche he vvilleth that all estates shall enter (vvhen they feele themselues vnapte to liue sole) as vvell for the procreation of children, as for the comfort and relief of their vveak and imperfect nature, & that vve shold keepe the bondes thereof vvith all purenesse and innocencie of mynde, that it be not layde in condemnation agaynst vs in the
 day vvhen all mennes dooings shall be made open and many∣fest. And this kynde of lyfe is so greatly aduaunced and honou∣red, that it is not onely had in estimation amongs Christians, but also amonges the Heathen: yea and Nature vvoorketh suche effecte in all creatures, that euen amongs the brute and saluage beastes, and also amongs insensible thyngs there ap∣peareth a mutuall affection betvvene the male and female, as shall euidentlye appeare in readyng this sayde Discourse.
And novv (most noble and redoubted Princesse) that I haue sig∣nified vnto your excellencie, the vvhole effecte of this sayd au∣thour (vvhiche I haue turned out of the frenche into oure En∣glishe tong) though not so eloquently as others coulde haue doone, yet (I trust) truly and according to the meaning of the sayde Authour, I doo vvith all submission, present the same vn∣to your highnesse, not as a matter needefull to put your Maie∣stie in remembrance of any thing that shoulde be vvanting in your noble personage, appertaining to the dutie of the maiestie royal of a prince (being most manifest and aparāt to the vvhole vvorld, your maiestie doth dayly fight and combat against those enormities that are most chiefly reprehended in this vvork) but rather to be as it vvere a glasse for your highnesse, to see and be∣holde (to your graces great comfort) the manyfolde benefites that God hath bestovved at all tymes, and in all ages on those that haue loued and feared hym, and hovve that vvyth hys mightye hande he hathe and dayly dothe, keepe and defend all suche Princes and Magistrates, as doo iustely and truly ex∣ecute theyr offices in maynteynyng of Iustice, and seekyng the aduauncemente of his glorie, by setting foorth true Re∣lygion according to his holy vvoorde and commaundemente, vvhyche vvith vvhat greate studie and care of mynde youre hyghnesse trauayleth to do continually, bothe GOD and the vvorlde are vvitnesses: notvvithstanding that dyuerse and ma∣ny greate conspiracies, haue ben and dayely are practized in these perillous and dangerous dayes agaynst your maiestie for the same, vvhich (thanks be to God) haue alvvayes ben reueled before they vver ripe, vvherin of his great goodnesse & mercy
 he hath miraculously defended your noble and royall persone from tyme to tyme, as it vvere in despite of your enimies, and against all their deuises and policies, euen to some of their con∣fusion, and to the greate admiration and vvonder of the reste: vvhiche is a strong and infallible argument that hee is pleased in these your dooings, in the vvhiche if your Maiestie do per∣seuere, it shall be (no doubt) not onely a great reioycing to all your true and faithfull subiectes, and terrour to your sayde eni∣mies: but also a mightie defence and strong bulvvarke ageynst all such as any vvays seeke to trouble and anoy your highnesse moste quiet estate. Ceassing novv any longer to vvearie youre Maiestie vvith ouer many vayne and superfluous vvordes, there resteth nothing for the perfect accomplishement of the same, but a safecundite to serue as a guyde to make it passe the more surely amongs such captious persons as are more ready to fynd fault than any vvayes to put to their hands to amend the same. VVherfore I doo moste humbly beseeche your highnesse not to take it in euill parte, that I doo presume to call vppon your diuine name, and dedicate the same to your excellencie, for a defence and safegarde, beeing moste assured, that it can not bee but vvell receyued, and fauoured of all menne, if it maye haue so good happe to bee defended vvith the beames and brighte∣nesse of the excellent vertues that doo most abundantly flovve in youre moste noble and royall person, moste humbly besee∣ching the same to accepte this at the handes of youre fayth∣ful, true and obedient subiecte, as the first frutes of his labour, and as the gifte of him that vvoulde giue better, if it vvere any vvayes in his povver: praying GOD to graunt youre most excellent hyghnesse vvithall, long and prosperous reygne ouer vs, perfecte health, muche tran∣quillitie, and ageynst all your enemies most happie & triūphant victorie.
