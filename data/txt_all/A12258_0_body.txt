MADAME,
SInce it hath pleased our OMNIPOTENT CREATOR, and gra∣cious Redeemer, to heape vpon your Ladiship manie and sundrie honourable Priuiledges of Nature, and Grace; and by them, amongst manie others, your good Friendes and Seruantes, to in∣gage mee, of a long time, to honour
& serue your Ladiship with such Gra∣ces and Dueties by manie Testimonies of your comfortable kindnesse and care of mee, as I haue hitherto (with a constant intention to bee thankfull) declared my willingnesse to expresse, that I should not come (with the com∣mon sort of this declining Age) guiltie of the foule imputation of Ingratitude, as the weaknesse of my wit and skill might afford, I did communicate with your Ladiship (for your priuate vse) these MEDITATIONS, vpon that fun∣damentall ground of Faith which is THE LORDS CREATION OF THE WORLD, to bee vsed of your Ladiship with daylie Prayer & Meditation, that yee might neuer want matter wherein yee might rejoyce in the goodnesse, wisedome, and power of that Creator; with a perswasion, that his wise Proui∣dence reacheth vnto the conseruatiō of the same, in Mercie and Iustice, vnto the consummation of the Worlde, wherein your Ladiship hath your com∣fortable entresse, euen according to the Lordes euerlasting Decree of your Ele∣ction
Calling, Iustification, Sanctifica∣tion, and hope to bee glorified, with all the rest of his Saincts and elect An∣gels, in the euerlasting sellowship of his Kingdome, besides the manie Ob∣ligations wherewith I stand indebted to my Lord your Noble Husband, for his Lordships fatherlie care and patro∣cinie of mee in all mine affaies, that your honour should not bee smoothe∣red in the Christian affection which yee carrie to the Common-wealth of the Lordes Church, not onelie in per∣mitting, but likewise in vrging that this Benefite might bee made of a pub∣licke priuiledge, to the vse of all them that by a common affection with you striue to worke out their saluation in feare and trembling, and so make their election sure, I haue, according to my duetie, dedicated this little Treatise to passe foorth vnder your Ladiships pro∣tection; that the thankes of the paines which I haue taken in contriuing the same for your Ladiships priuate vse, may redound vnto your selfe, Ma∣dame, from as manie as shall finde the
benefite thereof for their information, and stirring vp vnto anie duetie of Re∣ligion. And as it can neither stand with my Profession & your Ladiships sinceritie, nor yet the superlatiue dig∣nitie of such a glorious subject to pol∣lute the same with the intising wordes of humane wisedome: knowing your Ladiship to be as farre from all delight in assentation and flattering, as yee are from the affectation of salfe and vnde∣serued praise; I haue contented my selfe in the simplicitie of the Lordes trueth, to commende vnto your Ladi¦ship, and all the rest of Gods Sainctes, the constant and carefull practise of the Fayth and knowledge which may bee reaped by the reading and medita∣tion of this Doctrine, with Prayer and thankesgiuing to the Lord, for the happie successe of the same: not that I would wish your Ladiship by this di∣stinction of the matter to seuerall dayes, to bee so superstitiouslie tied vn∣to the same, as if the whole particulars of the Creation should not bee at all times before your Eyes, as a faire Gar∣den,
whereof yee should beholde the beautie, and smell the fragrant Odours together: But heerewithall (if it may please the Lordes gracious Majestie) yee may resent the goodnesse, power and wisedome of God in the Crea∣tion of euerie creature vpon its owne day when it was made.
So wishing the successe of these ex∣ercises to bee according to mine affe∣ction, and intention, for the Christian profit and progresse in the faith of the trueth, which is according to godli∣nesse, I beseech God to blesse your La∣diship, with my Lord your Husband, and your hopefull Sonne Lorde CHARLS, with all Prosperitie in this Life, and euerlasting happinesse in the Life to come, I rest.
