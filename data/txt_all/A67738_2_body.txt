My Noble Patriots,
THat I have not return'd you an earlier Account of those Travels, in which out of a pure love to your Country you were pleased some years since to employ me, I had rather in few words submit to your just Reprehension, than, by making a tedious Apo∣logy, tell my Readers a long story, that little or nothing concerns them. It is I hope sufficient that I acquaint them, that if from the Remarks I have made on the Ballance of Europe, or my stu∣dious prying into the curious intreagues of Trade, and the thriving Politicks of our Neighbour Na∣tions, any Advantage shall arise unto us in this
Kingdom, they must with me return their Ac∣knowledgments wholly to you, whose Generous Souls not only engaged me at first in the Under∣taking, but also wholly maintained both me and my Interpreter throughout my Travels, in the quest of such things, as my own Fortune would have proved too slender to have otherwise acqui∣red. But that I may not be condemned with the Sluggard for laying up my Talent in a Napkin, I herewith present you also an account of my choi∣cest Observations and Practice for this twenty five years in Trade; in which such Secrets as the be∣nefit of your Moneys gave me the advantage of finding out abroad, are at length by great pains and study rendred all practicable here at home, and so adapted to our own Climate and Constitu∣tions, that nothing but Sloth or Envy can possib∣ly hinder my Labours from being crown'd with their wisht for Success: Our habitual fondness of the one hath already brought us to the brink of Ruine, and our proneness to the other almost discouraged all Pious Endeavours to promote our future Happiness. People confess they are sick, Trade is in a Consumption, the whole Na∣tion languishes, and the Physick prescribed is ve∣ry proper and good, but some like not the Sea∣son,
and fain would put it off (like Repentance) still a little longer, until at length it be too late. Others fancy not the Doctor, and so resolve not to like it because his Advice. All that I shall say to both these is, That the Obstructors of our Happiness will purchase to themselves as many hard Thoughts from their ruin'd Posterity for hindring the increase of Wealth, Honour, and Ho∣nesty amongst us, as your Wisdom will create you Blessings, for your study, care, and liberal Expences to promote so Noble a Design. And if by what I here present you, you find I have discharged my Trust like a faithful Steward, your Approbation, as it will be the best Security against the Captious, it is likewise the highest Ambi∣tion of,
Gentlemen,
