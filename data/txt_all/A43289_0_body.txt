My very good Lord,
AMong other Disparagements of this life, collected and sum'd up in my frequent retirements and con∣centrations of my Minde, my Thoughts have, more then once, glanced on the exceeding vanity of that Heroick disease, incident to the best tempered Souls, the insatiate Appetite of posthume Glory. And though I must not but confess, this originary Feaver ele∣mented in the innate Ardor and Scintillations of those Sparks of Divinity, which now lie raked up in the Mass or Chaos, of our eclipsed Nature; and that by the light of these secret Flashes, may be discovered the Im∣mortality of that Semideity, or noble Essence, for a while immured in walls of Clay: yet when I make re∣flections on the unconcernment, and happy insensility of the Soul, once fled home, to an indissoluble Union with



the Soul of Beatitude; as to the trifling affairs of the swarm of Mortals, here below, and that all Relations to the visible and perishable World, are lost in utter ob∣livion, at the instant of her Transition to the invisible, intellectual, and immaterial: I cannot but smile at the Delusion of this Ambition, of having our Memories survive our Ashes, and listing our Names in the Legend of Fame, by the ingravements of memorable and worthy Actions, as seeming to be no more, then a provident Fraud of impaired Nature, whereby man is handsomly deluded into the attempting Actions of such difficulty or danger, as if presented without the speci∣ous disguise of Honor, must appear absolutely de∣structive, at least to the Tranquillity and sober Fruiti∣on of our selves, if not also to our Conformity unto that Catholique Maxime, deeply impressed upon the radical Principles of our Essence, Philautie or Self-conserva∣tion. For what individual Knowledg can w have of Caesar? Or what intelligence can he hold with the spi∣rits of those, who sacrifice the most of Veneration to his Memory? Or did the incense of humane Honor ascend so high, a to approach the Mansion of the Souls of He∣röes, devested of Mortality; which can no more be grant∣ed, then that a man on our Hemisphere, should be sensible of the wagging of a straw in the Antipodes: yet what could the Access of that Nothing contribute to that



state of Blessedness, whose measure is immensity, wherein to imagine either Defect, Satiety, or Mutati∣on, would be a Conceit savoring too much of Sensuality, and of bloody advantage to the absurd Metaphysicks of the Alcoran? And how much more noble a plea, to the immarcescible Laurel, shall that modest head obtain, which, in all Anxieties and Difficulties of Virtue, drew encouragement onely from the simple and naked loveliness of Virtue; then that fond ambitious one, whose suffer∣ings were caused by no better a Flame, then the Ignis Fatuus of Applause, and desires knew no other at∣tractive, but Vain glory.
This Meditation, my dear Lord, as it could never stifle the irradiations of my Genius, or render me less sensible of the incitements of Virtue, to enterprise some∣thing, that might be grateful in the nostrils of Posterity, when my Dust shall be offensive: so hath it wrought my resolutions to that Stoical temper, that while I fix one eye of Reason on that domestick Security, and internal Serenity, which necessarily redounds from the severe practice of Goodness, in this life; and the other of Faith on that infinite Compensation, ordained to reward our pious endevours, in the next: I can comfortably ac∣quiesce in the secret discharge of my duty to God and the World, at least in the sincerity of intention: and though I should arrive at such unexpected Felicity, as



to be an instrument, or accessory, either in the discovery of some Magnale in Knowledg, or in the Contribution of some Benefit, conductive to the repair of the Common breaches of Humanity; yet I dare confidently hope, I should have no ear open to the invasion of Popular Euges, nor admit any dream of happiness, in the esti∣mation of succeeding Ages.
Now, though the too acute Severity of some, may here be furnished with latitude enough, either to charge this my Theory of Aversation from Praise, on my being conscious of such Fragility, Lapses and Imper∣fections of my Pen, as might conclude, that the best part of my Judgment lies in the politick Conceal∣ment of my Name; or deny me qualified with abili∣ties of reducing it into Practice: yet I have this Com∣fort left to take Sanctuary in, that I may (without ingaging your Lordship, into the Patronage of a fals∣hood) appeal unto your judicious integrity, for deter∣mination, whether my Scepticity, even in such Noti∣ons, as my self hath, to the most precise, anatomical subdivision of each subject, and abstracted perpension of each minute particle thereof (not much below the accurate Method, invented by the Stoicks Plutarchus, in Ep. ad Pha∣vrinum, de Frigore Primi∣genio., and late∣ly revived into use by the most ingenious Mons. Des Cartes In sua dsser∣tatione de Me∣todo Veritatis in Scientiis in∣vestigand, p. 10.) examined and transmitted to the World, for indubitate and irrefragable Truths; be not evidence



strong enough to make good, that I prefer the mani∣festation of any one single Verity, to all other sinister interests, in this Vale of Error, and therefore should embrace and assimilate the decisive Contradiction of riper heads, with joy equall to that of benighted Ma∣riners, at the eruption of their faithfull Pilot, the North starre, as the Soveraign Remedy to my former Wandrings. To the other branch of the praesupposed Scandall, may justly be opposed your Lordships pri∣vacie, to my obstinate reluctancy, against the Ad∣visoes of my Honoured Friends, urging mee to a pub∣lick Appropriation and Avowance of some papers, not long since, dispersed through Europe, without the pro∣tection either of Author, or Dedication: as also my denyall of Light, to some Philosophicall Enquiries, whose Conception, Formation, and Maturity (though of inconsiderable value, in the account of more perfect Learning) cost mee the profusion of so much Time and Oyle, as if summed up by the Algebra of Candor, might well have purchased the Charitable Forgivenesse, if not the friendly Approbation of the Reader.
And in the serene darknesse of this Latency, I had still remained invisible to the effascinating Opticks of Envy, and celebrated a constant Jubilee of immunity from the virulent blasts of Detraction; had I not



been intempestively drawn upon the Stage, by the supe∣rior violence of two invincible Magnets: whose potent Alliciency I could provide against by the opposition of no strength, but such as either a dangerous Rudeness, or indiscreet Morosity must have afforded. The first, the inexorable Commands of your Lordship and other Persons, of so much Honor, as Nobility in Birth, Knowledg, and Fortune can contribute; which led me from the more direct Path of other Contemplations more per∣pendicular to my Profession, into this wanton digression, and upon the penalty of the deprivation of that, which I have good reason to value much above my life, the place I held in your and their favourable Regard, charged me with the managery of this small Province, for the space of two moneths onely. And had I withdrawn my Obe∣dience from such absolute Soveraignty, as, I must ac∣knowledg, your Lordships and their more learned Spirits deservedly hold over mine: Doubtless I had inevitably faln upon that so much to be abhorred rock, refractary Incivility, and run my self to an eternal loss of those Stars, whose conserving influence, and vigorous warmth, are so necessary to the Vitality and Growth of my Stu∣dies. Whereas now, in this election, I have adven∣tured onely to bear up against the impetuous torrent of Censure. The other Attractive, the too early Dif∣fusion of these sheets, and the immature admittance



of a multitude to the acquaintance of them, and the weak hand that Copied them; insomuch, that the con∣cealment of the Translator, carried the face of an im∣possibility, without the joynt concealment of the Trans∣lation: It being (by an error of Necessity, the Confor∣mity to the unresistible importunity of those Orbes, to whose motion, mine is, and must be, subordinate) transmitted to a Community, beyond the power of Re∣vocation.
Thus much I was concerned to speak, as to the Precaution of Scandal, deductive out of my Apo∣stasie, from my Resolution of Self-concealment, and the publick avowance of my self for the Father: It remains onely, that I endevour a Palliation of this bold lapse of my judgment, in stooping your Lordship to so low a Patronage, as to be God-father, to this a∣dopted Childe.
I ever looked upon Dedications, with the same aspect of neglect, and presumption of inutility, that I beheld Prologues in the Front of Comedies; having upon the unhappy Experience of most Poets erected this unrefutable Maxime, That a good Play may commend a bad Prologue; but the best Prologue never expiate the Errors, or peece up the defects of a bad Play; and upon a mature Audit of all the benefits, which the most Elegant, and Judicious Pens have acquired by this



imaginary Refuge, in the Sanctuary of great Names, or great Judgements, found that the totall result amounts to no more, but a delusive hope of security from the Contagious emissions of that Uni∣versall Basilisk Detraction; whose venome, in a proud confidence of Victory, laughs at the most vigo∣rous energie of any the most sacred Antidote, and from the infection whereof, he onely can bee saved, that dares encounter it with Contempt.
Again, my faith hath long swam smoothly downe the current of the Popular opinion, that Translati∣ons praesent the lise of their Text, at as great disad∣vantage of Dissimilitude, as the backside of Hang∣ings exhibit the story interwoven: and are at best, but slender Adumbrations, or pale Counterfeits of those more lively Images, drawne with more strength of Art, in the Primitive Phansy of their Protoplast. Nor could I ever be alienated by the Phrensie of Nar∣cissus, into such a fond dotage of Partiality, as to ex∣pect a better Fortune should belong to the lines, copied by my unaequall Pencil, then what I have observed to have accrewed to others upon more laudable Transcrip∣tions. This I would not have rashly extended by any, to an imputation of occult Blasphemy, against the Ve∣nerable▪ Majesty of our Mother Tongue; out of which, I am ready to assert, may be spun as fine and



fit a garment, for the most spruce Conceptions of the Minde to appeare in publick in, as out of any other in the World: especially, since the Carmina∣tion or refinement of it, by the skill and sweat of those two Heroicall Wits, the Lord St. Alban, and the now flourishing Dr. Browne; out of whose incomparable Writings may be selected a Volume of such full and significant Expressions, as if uprightly fathomed by the utmost Extent of the sublimest Thought, may well serve to stagger that Partiall Axiome of some Schoolemen, that the Latin is the most sympho∣niacall and Concordant Language of the Rati∣onall Soule.
These Diminutions as well of the Epidemick custome of Dedications, as of Translations in generall, and of my owne in particular, I have praemised with designe, to manifest my owne exceeding Audacity, in conse∣crating so contemptible an oblation, as this transcriptive Landskip of Magnetisme, to the Altar of so much sober Learning; as whoever hath the happy honour of admission to your closet lectures (the onely priviledge I can be proud of, and be forgiven) or but with a discreet eare to taste your publick Discourses in earnest, must allow your Lordship to be Master of.
Having thus devesed my self of all other praetences, I direct my addresse to the Plea of those two Cardinall



Motives, upon the swindg or rapt of whose violence, this my bold Error may seem naturally to depend. The first, (and in troth, the Prime) is your Lordships known Candor and humility; which acquired by a long and habitual Exercise of Virtue, endows you with an in∣evitable propensity, to forgive the Poverty of his offer∣ing, whose Wealth is onely Zeal The other, your Animadversion and careful influence bestowed upon each sheet of this Work, successively, before the Ink could be fully dry: Insomuch, that the Justice of some might safely escape the imputation of Rigor, should it determine the Book to be properly your Lordships by a neerer right, then that of Dedication. This duly con∣sidered, I dare put my self upon the tryal of Aequani∣mity; whether an Alienation of what is rightly yours, to more then a moity; or an equitable Resig∣nation of the same, to your peculiar use, can best stand with the Justice of his Duty, who endevours, by all possible observances, to make good the title of
