Honoured and Honourable Gentlemen,
I Account it my great happinesse that Mr. Bushnel of Box having published a heavy charge against the Commiss. of the County of Wilts, appointed for the ejecting of scan∣dalous and ignorant Ministers, and therein bent himself most fiercely against mee as a most grievous offender, hath, by dedicating his Narrative to you, put a necessity upon mee, (unlesse I would plead guilty to all hee
