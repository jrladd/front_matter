NOw the businesse is ended. If you look upon this skirmish with a generall eye, you wil see nothing but (as in a Battail) smoak and confusion: But if you mark every ones particular behaviour, you wil easily distinguish betwixt a rash fierie spirit, and a truly valiant. In the Doctor, you shall find a David, fighting Gods defensive Batâˆ£tailes, without sinister respects, or private passion: In Cal. you shal see the son of Nimshi, matching furiously, and hewing downe the Priests of Baal, yet neverthelesse a great worshipper of Calves: In the Replyer, you may behold Ionathan comming a Reserve to David, though perchance shooting his arrowes sometimes wide, and sometimes open: It lyes in you, Readers, now, to judge, and give the Palme: For the Doctors part and mine (would Cal. durst make the third) we both resigne our shares: Let Truth be crowned with the Victory, and the God of Truth, with Glory.
FINIS.
