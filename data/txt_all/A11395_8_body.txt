Though in thy Brook (great Charles) ther swim a Sw
Whose happy, sweet, immortall tunes can raise
The vertuous Greatnes of thy Noble praise
To higher notes, than my faint numbers can:
Yet, while thy Lucan doth in silence scan
Vnto himself new-meditated laies,
To finish vp his sad Pharsalian fraies;
Lend ear to BARTAS (now our Country-man).
For, though his English be not yet so good
(As French-men hardly do our tongue attain)
He hpeth yet to be well vnderstood;
The rather, if you (worthy Lord) shall daign
His bashfulnes a little to aduance,
With the milde fauours of your countenance.
