Most Honoured Lord,
THis posthume book is furnished vvith worth, but it wan∣teth a Patron. A worthier thē your elfe the Booke could not find, nor your Lordship a more patheticall Poet to Patronize. If in Poetry, He∣raldry

were admitted, he would be found in happinesse of wit neere al∣lied to the great Sydney: yet but neere; for the Apix of the Coelum Empyrium is not more inaccessable then is the height of Sydneys Poesy, which by imagination we may ap∣proch, by imitation neuer attaine to. To great men our very syllables should be short, and therfore I make my Conclusion a Petition; That your Lordshippes acceptation may shew how much you fauor the no∣ble Name, and nature of the Poet, and Booke. VVhich deigned by your Lordshippe, I shall thinke my paines in collecting, and disposing of these Epigrams well placed, and euer rest.
