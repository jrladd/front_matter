SIR,
I Am confident you cannot have greater cause to wonder at my boldness, then I have rea∣son to admire at your Learning, and Piety; for indeed the rare example of your virtues addd much alacrity to my endeavours, which are but shallow if compar'd to the depth of your un∣derstanding. Sir, the limits of my request (though they are large) extend themselves no further then this, That You would be pleas'd to permit this my unfleg'd bird to rest under the wings of Your pro∣tection, that I may ever be engag'd to boast of so worthy a Patron: Sir, as I know I have errors, so I know you have goodness to excuse them, and I a heart to be thankfull, and alwayes be a faithfull honourer of Your Virtues, whilest I am
Sir,
