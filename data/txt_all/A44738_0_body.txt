My Lord,
I Have heard the English Toung often traduc'd abroad, that, whereas the witt and wisedom of a Nation is much discernd in their Proverbiall Speeches, The English is more barren in this kind then other Languages; To take off this Aspersion, and rectifie the Opinion of the world herein, was one of the main Motifs that induced me to impose this (no easie) taske upon my self of Collecting and publishing these English Proverbs, or old Sayed-Sawes and Adages, which I dare say, have as much Witt, Significance and Salt in them as any of the other Languages that follow. Some of them may be said to be as old as Pauls Steeple; And we live in those destructive fatall Times, that are like to verifie a very ancient Proverb of that stately Temple (the greatest Ornament London ever had) viz. Pauls cannot alwayes stand, alluding to the lubricity of all sublunary things.
'Tis confessed that other Languages are fuller of Them, specially the Italian, whereof Signior Florio (who deserved so much of the English Nation, by his Dialogs and Dictionary, (specially this last which is more compleat) hath published about six thousand, and divers of them are allowed to be bald being so old.
Now touching the Patronage of these Antient Free denisons, and Franklins of England (for so Proverbs may be called,) It may, under favour, well become your Lordship, in regard you make one of the most Eminent part of the Nation, if one look upon your

numerous and Noble Family, whereof the late Addition of your son, James, Lord Norris, that hopefull bud of Honor, is none of the least.
But, my Lord, besides the premises, there was another main reson did prompt me to this Dedicatory addresse, which was, that late Po∣sterity (for Proverbs are long-liv'd) as well as the present Age, may find it upon Record, how much I was your servant for so many Noble Favors of sundry kinds, so that I may say you do herein as in all things else, truly Patrizare with my Lord your Father, in whose Favor I had the happinesse to live many years, that Noble Hero, who having received some mortal wounds upon the true Stage of Ho∣nor, as he commanded in chief a Royall Army, you did preserve him for the time (though with the apparant hazard of your life and liberty) from the fury of the firing Enemy.
So with my hearty prayers to Heaven for an affluence of all Fe∣licities upon you and yours, most humbly desiring to live still in your good Opinion and Favor, (which I account one of the greatest con∣tentments of my life) I rest,
My Highest Honored Lord,
