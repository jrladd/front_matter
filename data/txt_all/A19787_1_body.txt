Sir,
THough it bee most safe and easie for a man (with the Psalmist) to commune with his owne heart in si∣lence, according whereto the Prouerbe also sayth, Bene vixit qui bene latuit; yet for that it is more behoouefull to the Common good (either in Church, or Common wealth, for one of which all men are ordained) that such Talent wherewith God hath enabled any, bee it neuer so small, should bee imployed and communicated to the good of others; The consideration hereof hath mooued
 me to aduenture this, (as other my for∣mer weake Labours) to the view of the World. And although I haue offred in this my labour, to the honourable Pa∣tronage of one to whom I am in dutie bound; yet withall, out of that respect which I doe owe to you, I am bold to tender also this little Treatise to your view, and to desire your acceptance hereof, as a token of my Loue to you, to whom I must acknowledge my selfe, for many your fauours, much obliged, and shall euer remaine,
