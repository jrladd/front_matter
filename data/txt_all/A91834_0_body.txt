KINGS (Mighty Soveraigne) like Pla∣nets in their Orbes (under that Primum Mobile, from whence all beings derive their existence and continuance) are sea∣ted in their severall Thrones, to rule and guide the people committed to their charge by the sweet influence of Love, and unreprovable motion of their justice; which axiome of State more especially di∣rects it selfe to your Majesties consideration, who (as the Sunne in respect of other Luminaries) do shine▪ in a spheare of such eminency, as besides the unparalleld lustre it re∣taines at home, doth communicate its splendor to forraine parts, as a patterne for the greatest Potentates.
And hereupon, as according to the propinquity or di∣stance of the Sunne in its annuall peregrination, the ele∣mentary bodies receive their augmentation, or diminution accordingly: so are the hearts of all your loyall Subjects il∣luminated with the presence of this gracious aspect, and miserably overshadowed with sorrow in the least absence thereof.
But bleare eyes are no fit objects for such bright rayes, nor are meane conceits allowable subjects for Royall appre∣hensions;

neverthelesse, as the Sunne loseth nothing of its splendor, when it so farre declines in its beames, to kisse the low shrubs as well as the tall Cedars, and though it be alike diffusive to all, yet admits no taint in the touch of the vilest creature: So if your Majesty vouchsafe to cast downe a gracious eye on the humble present of your meanest Subject (as from the hand of a more able giver) your High∣nesse cannot suffer much in this abasement, but your good∣nesse shall shew it selfe transparent, and like that glorious mirrour of all beautifull perfections.
Howsoever I durst not to have presumed thus high up∣on any imagination that your Majesty wanted farre better information or advise, especially from so honorable an As∣sembly as that of the present Parliament; but as in a ge∣nerall obstruction of water currents, it is naturall for the shallowest Brookes as deepest Rivers, to seeke way for their passage; likewise in a common calamity, the meanest (who are commonly the first sufferers) cannot be blamed for put∣ting a finger to the griefe, nor justly constrained to ex∣presse their complaints in silence onely. But if my intentions have faulted in the matter or manner, (being errors of skil not will) I beseech your Majesty so farre to beare with either, as may pardon the presumption of him that is a dai∣ly Orator for your Majesties temporall, and eternall hap∣pinesse;
