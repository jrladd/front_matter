MY LORD,
I Am very sensible, that you are the known Favourer of Men of eminent Worth and Learning; I only take this Op∣portunity of acquainting the World, that You were so, of the Author of these following Discourses, that so you may re∣ceive in larger Measures those Tributes which are due to Pub∣lick

Benefactors, the Prayers and Praises of Mankind; For they who have, or shall be bet∣tered by This great Author's Works, are oblig'd in a peculiar Manner to remember that Right Honourable Person, who by his Countenance did not only encou∣rage him to be serviceable, but did really endeavour to render him more useful to us, by pro∣curing for him a little Recess from the Toil and Labours of his weighty Employment: Had this succeeded, in all Humane Probability he had lived longer, and then we should have seen that truly Pious and most sublime Design he intended to pursue;

and should have been well ac∣quainted with that uncultivated part of Religion, The Duties of Piety towards God: And perhaps by Them, we should have given a guess at the Praises and Hallelujahs of those blest Be∣ings above, when they had been managed with that Strength of Eloquence, that Fervour of Spi∣rit, pois'd and temper'd with such a Judgment as his. But he is gone to bear a part in the Heavenly Choir, where (if he knows what is done here below) it will be a pleasing Prospect to my dear departed Friend, to see Your Lordship and your Noble Family, the Possessors and design'd Heirs

of the Honours of both Worlds. I am,
My Lord,
