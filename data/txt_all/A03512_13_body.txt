IN Choice of all our Countries Noblest spirits
(Borne slauisher barbarisme to conuin)
I could not but in uoke your ho or'd Merits,
To follow the swift vertue of our Prince.
The cries of Vertue, and her Fortresse, Learning,
Brake earth, and to Elysium did descend,
To call vp Homer: who therein discerning
That his excitements, to their good, had end
(As being a Grecian) puts-on English armes;
And to the hardie Natures in these climes
Stikes-vp his high and spiritfull alarmes,
That they may cleare earth of those impious Crimes
VVhose conquest (though most faintly all apply)
You know (learn'd Earle) all liue for, and should die.
