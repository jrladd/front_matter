THAT the Providence of our most gracious God, having stirred me up to see, and consider, and lament the most dreadful Ruin and Destruction of the Loyal Seamen of England, in their Lives and Pay, that ever these Nations did behold, and to Represent the same in all Humility to your Ho∣nours; and considering also, that some of their Miseries were, in my Judgment, against Grace, and Reason and Common Sense; and also sometimes against those other Four Things that used to be esteemed of as Jewels in England; that is, Religion, Liberty, Property, and their Lives: To say nothing of the Fifth, without Law, made me to dread the Consequent; and I did observe that it was hidden from his Maje∣sty and your Honours so long, until there was the Loss, as I represent∣ed to you, of the Lives of above Forty Thousand, and of the Pay of above Sixty Thousand of them; and if there had been occasion to question the Truth of it, I would have proved at any time by the King's Books, in twenty Four Days time, without Two Pence Charge to the King or Nation; and considering that his Majesty has spoken for their Relief, and your Honours, who had raised money enough before to have kept them from Ruin, and to have spared a Million or Two of it by Capt. St. Lo's Rule.
Besides, if they had been but managed as the English Seamen were in former days, and as the Dutch and the French do at this day, to save near half their money, and most of their Seamens Lives. But I say, Your Honours being now also Resolved to study their Relief, I pre∣sume, in all Humility, to cast in my Mite also. Now, in order to the
same, which I would intreat your Honours to accept of, as Rough and Unframed Timber, to be squared and fitted to what part your Ho∣nours please; and one thing is, many crooked pieces are made use of in the building of Shipping, that when placed aright not only serve to strengthen the Ship, and help to preserve the Lives of the Seamen, but formally use to help tohold the Ships together, while they daily beat their Enemies; and tho these Pieces may not be always so readily known to all Landmen, I will presume some may serve now, and some another time.
And I do assure your Honours, if I had better at hand, I would present them to you: But they are my own, and so saved me the trouble of begging, borrowing, or which is worse, stealing; and I intreat your Honours Patience; for their Miseries being so dreadful, and so many years a growing, and so many times Ten Thousands, as they could not have been easily represented, except one should have said, their Case was almost all together Miserable: But blessed be God that it is not: They have a good King and good Countrey for their Friends, if their Cases are not blinded from them: And as to their Remedies, it requires a great deal of Care and Inquiry: And when I look back to what I represented before; and forward, to what strange need there is of them now, and when I hear that a great many there is that are in Droves, travelling in other Countries without Shooes or Stock∣ings, seeking to enter into the Service of the Merchants of England there, or to serve other Nations, and Run away from che Merchant-Ships also, and lose their Pay, some of them not being willing to come home, for fear of the Press; This makes my Heart dread the Effects of it, and do suppose these Two Things would be worth while to be inquired into by the Parliament, to know how the Case stands with them in these respects.
First, Let every Man of War's Book, that hath been in the Streights, or Spain, or Portugal, be searched, to see what Numbers Run away out of any Ship, or every Ship, at any Port or Place.
And, Secondly, To have an Account of the Men of War and Mer∣chant-Ships lost this Eighteen Months to the French, with the whole Number of Men taken in each Ship, and in the whole Shipping lost; and then have also the Number of Men return'd from France in that time, that did belong to those Ships, and what is wanting may be supposed to be entred into the French Service, if not dead; and if
of the East-India Ships taken, there be come home short, near an Hundred of those men that were taken; it is to be fear'd, the rest will stay until warm weather, and then get some Money and Cloaths, if our Press is so great this Winter, that they meet the poor Captive Wretches when they Return home in their Lousie Cloaths from France, and beg their way near an Hundred and Fifty Miles; then before they come to Lon∣don, catch them, and carry them on Board, Rags and Lice, as they Run; put them down in the Hold of the Vessel, to lie on the Boards or Ballast, or what they please, if they be with∣out Bedding; and as Queen Esther said, if they perish, they pe∣rish.
This is a Notable Age to tame Prodigals in, if they be ordi∣nary Seamen; but if they be Double-Pay Officers, then it may be they Run up and down, and be as bad or worse than be∣fore; and so it may be will not be worth, some of them, a Groat a Dozen, when the War is over; tho they most times Live; For the Officers that have Liberty to come on Shore, die very few of them. But this by the way. But I am too large in the Introduction.
I did think to say something more as to the Seamen's Encou∣ragement, in this Preface; as that without the Seamen be paid off yearly on Shore, and have a Fortnight's or Month's Liberty to Recruit their Healths, I am afraid they will never be encou∣raged to come into the Service, neither stay there; and if they do, and die, it is as bad as Running; for if they Run away in England, and the Merchants get them, it is an help to Trade, and the King may have them again; and I could never know the Reason of that pretence of keeping the Seamen in such sla∣very in their payments, in this Age more than any other, to be paid on Board; as if his Majesty's Service was not as good as in any Age of the World. For my part, I say, according to the money raised, there could never have been better Pay for the Seamen in the world. And indeed I would not have the Sea∣men of England say Justly, That God and the King sent good Meat, but the Devil sent them Cooks that spoil'd it half in dres∣sing.

But in short, I cannot see how the Nation, in the general, can answer the Seamen's being left to Ruin:
For, First, as I said, it is against Grace, against the gracious Law of Christ, not to do to them as we would others should do to us; which is taught the Children in their Catechisms.
2. It is against the gracious Providence of God to these Na∣tions, who did, by a Miracle, send over our gracious King Wil∣liam, to be a means to secure our Religion, Liberties and Pro∣perties; and if the Nation, who enjoys all these in Peace at home, should let the Seamen be Ruined, and lose all together, and their Lives into the bargain; I am afraid Christ will tell us another word in our Ears, That the Scripture shall not fail; and the same measure men mete, shall be meted to them again.
And so much to their being managed contrary to Grace.
2. Contrary to Reason; for Reason tells us, other Ages en∣couraged their Seamen, and paid them on Shore; and other Nations do so now. And Reason may tell those who have un∣derstood the Nature of the paying on Board, That the Seamen's Families and Relations have not enjoyed the Benefit of little more than half their Pay, to their Familie's Comfort.
3. It is contrary to common sense, to think that if Seamen do usually die, great part, where they are kept 2 or 3 years on board, that they should have any Policy to keep them until they die, rather than to pay them off, to Recruit their Health and Lives.
And indeed, who could be ever imagined to come freely into that Service where nothing but Death can part again, and then the Widow denied their Mony oft-times at last. And besides the Loss of the Seamen's Lives, there is extraordinary Charge to the Nation, and no benefit to the publick; but it may be the Commanders that had abused the Seamen all the War, could not get more, and would want a Ship to get Mony in, and so might want bread, while our brave Commanders would have Men enough But those who have driven away the Seamen from their Ships, and could have a supply by turning over men from other Ships, these might be at a Loss for Men next Year. But my Skill in Sea Affairs is too small: Did it but attain to the heighth of my Faithulness to his Majesty, and Love to my Na∣tive Country, I would, if the Lord assisted me with Life and
Health, write such an History of the Knavery, Folly, Cowar∣dize, Treachery, Ruin and Destruction of this War; in the Sea-Affairs, the Land would admire at; and would write eve∣ry Line, to the best of my Judgment, what would be found true, not only in another Age, where they will speak plainly, how his Majesty, and the Parliament, and Nation, and Merchants are cheated and abused. But I would write what I believe will be found true in the Day of Judgment, where all Cloaks will be thrown off; and then it will be known, that God did not send Mankind into the world to be like Fishes, the great ones to de∣vour the little ones; and I bless the Lord, who kept me from being one of the Devourers of the Age; for I have had an op∣portunity with ease to be a Monster, when I laid out an hundred Pound a week, or two, in Seamen's Pay, if I had bought at half Profit, or Twelve Shillings in the Pound Profit, as some Mon∣sters did, I should have doubled my Mony so often, to have been able to have swallowed up 3 or 4 Seamen's Pay for a Breakfast, besides what I had for Dinner and Supper; and then I should never have said a word of the Ruin of the Seamen, but should have been forc'd to have kept all Counsel, if the King had been cheated of a quarter of his Money, and the Seamen of above half their pay.
But I presume it will be well to look back to the most happy state of our Ships of War, when we did most effectually beat our Enemies, and incourage our Seamen, and see if we do not find the neglect of their method hath been the Loss of half our Seamen, and many of our Ships.
And, Secondly, Whether their way was not to go out in the Summer, and take all Opportunities to sight and destroy their Enemies, and come in again with the greatest part of the Fleet, and pay off the Seamen, and save their Lives and Pay.
Whether if this had been done, the Seamen would not have been incouraged to come freely into the King's Service, as in other Ages, as into a place where there was Mony, and Liberty, and Release, and not perpetual Bondage. And if at last discharged by reason of Sickness, and had Tickets signed by all the signing Officers, for the same to be deprived, otherwise cheated publick∣ly of their mony, to the shame of the Pay, and the Ruin of the discharged; and whether any can now, on the last Terms,
be safe to serve their King and Country: and it may be questi∣oned, whether it be not a shameful thing, when poor Seamen have had their Pay received by false Powers, they should be de∣nied the sight of the Ship's Books, to see who received it; and therefore whether also this, and the denying them otherwise the knowledg of their Case, be not an unjust and unreasonable thing to let poor Creatures be Cheated and Ruined, and hide it from them. And what advantage it is to the Government, to let their poor Seamen be so managed, besides the King's be∣ing at extraordinary Charge to pay them so far from London, and the City deprived of the benefit of taking their mony, as in other Ages, wherein the City of London was not used to be so slighted, neither the Seamen so Ruined.
But I shall presume to say more in the Body of my Book; for whoever pleaseth to read it at their leisure, what my Thoughts are; and if the Honourable Houses pardon me, I shall not need much to trouble my self with the Offences any others may take at it; for I write for good, and not to please, but to hinder Cheating the King, and Ruining the Seamen; and not to flat∣ter those that would have it all smuggled up in silence; which makes me think of one lately, that because he could not find any thing false in my book, had this supposition, and that was, That he supposed if I had Represented so much in France, the French King would have hanged me.
Now to that, being only a Supposition, I will answer it with other Suppositions: As,
1. I must have been a Fool or a Knave to have writ it, if I did not consult before I writ it, whether I could, with a good Conscience, have suffered Death for the same; and if I could, that might have been an easier Death than the Stone or the Gout. And,
2. I suppose, by his Leave, if the French King's Subjects are Ruined and Destroyed, it is by his Knowledge and Appoint∣ment; and not Ruined and destroyed without his knowledge, and the knowledge of his Nobles, as I presume our Seamen's Ru∣in are hid from the King and Parliament, and the blame must at last lie somewhere; and it may be the next Age will won∣der at she History of it; therefore I take pains to inform the King and Parliament, that they may let the blame and shame be
laid on those who have been Unjust, and Cruel, and Barbarous in the management of the Ruined Seamen and their Families: And indeed I suppose also,
3. That the French King, tho he plagues almost all Mankind, yet he incourages his Seamen, let's them come on shore every Year, and mony in their Pocket; lends them his Men of War to Privateer in, gives them his Tenths; and in short, if they have gotten Three Millions of Riches this Year from us, his Seamen's Share is more Hundreds of Thousands of Pounds than would pay our Ruined Seamen all their Q's and R's.
4. I suppose if he had seen his Seamen had been half dead, or frightned away, or Cheated of their Pay, and he not known it before-hand, I protest I do not only suppose, but really conclude they would have been more likely to have hang'd some that ru∣ined his Seamen, for being Knaves to do it; and those that see∣med honest, for being Tools to consent to it; and that might have escaped well next time, or at least had as good Quarter for telling as they for acting.
And suppose one Supposition more, That if the French King did know that his Admiralty, and Navy-Board, and Com∣manders of Ships did Ruin and destroy his Seamen's Lives and Pay, the Seamen would not so constantly go home to France a∣gain as they do; neither would he have Men enough to man his Fleet; neither would any other means secure his Seamen's Lives and Pay, without Managers that were as merciful to them as good men are to their Beasts, who do not let them groan and cry, and languish away for want of that Provender that is due to them for their Labour, for that day's work wherein they fell sick under their Burden, which is too sad, and too tedious to in∣large on.
And if your Honours think it to be too tedious, it may be considered, That the Miseries of the Seamen in England, have been of more various Kinds, and peradventure various Num∣bers than the Miseries of all the Corporations of England, and cannot be Represented in a few Words; besides all their other Miseries of their Families that they are subject to, equal with the lost of Mankind; And as their Diseases are many, they re∣quire honest faithful Doctors, in order to their Cure, and not leave them in the hands of hard hearted Wretches, to Ruin
them. But I could write until I tire your Honours and my self. But I beg your Honour's Gracious Pardon, and do lay my self at your Honour's Feet, and beg of God to give his Majesty Wis∣dom, as an Angel of God; and that God would fill your Ho∣nours with all Wisdom, and that in his and your Prosperity the Nation may be happy and blessed; and then I hope I shall in mercy injoy a share of the same; Who subscribe my self a faith∣ful Lover and Servant to his most Gracious Majesty King Willi∣am, and all your Honours, and all good men, while I remain,
Hermitage-Bridge, Jan. 44. 1695.
