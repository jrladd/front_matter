SIR,
I Made bold to Dedicate this small piece to you, though somewhat a stranger to you at pre∣sent, yet being desired by a faithfull friend of yours: who informed me of the great respect you owe to Art, I could do

no less; therefore good Sir, let me Crave your pardon in this my presum∣ption, and let me desire you to pass by my imbecilities, which I do not fear but that you will, when you have seri∣ously consider my Minority, and how hard a matter it is to comprehend the profundity of this most sublime Sci∣ence: and now to let you understand what moved me here to make my self publique, is the true love that I owe to my Countrey, and I hope most will receive benefit by those my weak indeavours, and upon this account one∣ly, I have presumed to make known to the world this little tract of Astrology touching Theft, knowing it must pass the Censure of various capacities, and from the unskilful I expect blots, but from the Judicious a friendly Correcti∣on, and if at last it may be crown∣ed with your Protection, my ex∣pectation is fully answered: who

faithfully desires to subscribe him∣self,
Sir,
