Honoured and Worthy Sirs,
YOu must not expect an Excuse for my Dedica∣tion, when the Work was in Obedience to Your Command: and if I have fail∣ed in the perfection of it, I hope my Good Intentions will be accepted, and my inability but lightly Taxed.
 I protest solemnly I never had any fond desire of appearing in print; but my main Ambi∣tion is to do you Faithful Ser∣vice; and I reckon this a part of it. And besides, the per∣formance of your Business, and discharge of the Trust reposed in me, I think I ought to do the utmost in my Station or Calling, for the general good of Mankind, and the Benefit of Posterity. It may be said I was unfortunate in this Voyage, but not unsuccessful, in preserving the Cargo and returning with the Ship. And in reading it, I hope you will find, no wilful neglect, or
 want of skill was the oc∣casion of what happend; since others at that time suffer'd the same with me, and some worse. And if by that means I have had opportunity of informing my self better of the Coast, and thereby of Instructing others, I shall not torment my self or repine at what I have suf∣fered. We ought to acquiesce in every thing as by Divine Providence ordered; and ac∣cording to that principle you seem to have acted, by your ready allowance of the da∣mage I charged: which Kind and Honourable Dealing with me I must acknowledge to the
 world, and for ever record in my mind.
I find it very hard to for∣bear falling into the just Com∣mendation of your several Worths; but I know the Bluntness of a Seaman, does not suit with Haranguing: Besides, having set my Com∣pass for saying nothing at this time, but what relates to the following Treatise; I must steer thereby, and keep stea∣dy. I value your Excellen∣cies, and Honour your Per∣sons, and am in all duty,
