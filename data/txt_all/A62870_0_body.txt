THrough the influence of the favour of many of you as instruments of the Lord for my liberty to preach the Gospel and peace at the Tem∣ple in London, I enjoyed sundry years in the late tempestuous times an unexpected calm, until a new storm arising by reason of the violence of men bent to bear down dissenters from the determinations of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, by reason of the pub∣lishing my Examen of Mr. Marshals Sermon for Infant-bap∣tism, I was necessitated to leave the harbour I had at the Temple, and to remove a great distance from London, to the place of my nativity, in which I hoped for a setlement, which I found not. For partly by the States selling my lands out of which my maintenance there arose, and partly by reason of the alienating of mens spirits from me through the distance between me and the Antagonist I here answer, I was in a great measure frustrated of my hopes. But it

pleased the Lord nevertheless to order things so, that by the means of some of you as Patrons, and others as helpers, I enjoy a comfortable supply for my maintenance, together with that which is dearer to me, the liberty of holding forth the truth of the Gospel, where I laboured many years heretofore. In testimony of my thankful acknowledge∣ment of that ample favour which it pleased some of you to vouchsafe me by your appearing for me, and bounty to me at the Temple, and testimonial of me at my departure thence, the readiness of you all either to invest, or to setle me in the maintenance I now enjoy, & that there may be some∣thing in your hands to vindicate me from injurious aspersi∣ons, under which my self with the truth I avouch do suf∣fer much, I humbly presume to present this writing to your hands, and praying that you may honor God in your places who hath raised you up to do him service, I subscribe my self

Lemster, De∣cember 26. 1651.
