MY LORD,
YOur Lordship, the best judg of Writers, will
not I hope condemn me, for inscribing your
name to the History of Famianus Strada.
He is indeed a Modern Roman, but in
happiness and freedom of expression, so like
the Ancients, Livy, Sallust, and Tacitus: that 'tis no
injury to the past, or present World, to say, their Age pro∣duced
not his Superiour, nor ours his Equal; since those
that have not arrived to his perfection may be good Histo∣rians;
those that have, eminent. The Fame of so great
an Authour, made me ambitious to interpret him to my
Countrey: not considering (for I as willingly acknowledg
my Errour as his Merit) that I was to Copie a Principal,
comprehending new and various Narrations, Princes
Letters, Speeches, Debates and Results of Cabinets and
Councel-tables, Battells, Descriptions of places, Chara∣cters

of Persons, and very prudent Observations, summed
up in brief sentences. Besides, I found all these apparelled
in the most captivating Figures of the Latine tongue: not
like the French, Spanish, or other Languages of Com∣merce,
easily reducible to those now spoken; but hard to be
rendred in any; especially in English. Yet after I had
ingaged, that I might play my game to the fairest, I bor∣rowed
the invention of Alexander Farneze, when he
dissected Don John of Austria in the Low-countreys:
and had him shewed in Spain, new-joynted skinned and
almost spirited, to Philip the second. In imitation where∣of,
I took to pieces the actions of Don John, Alexander
Farneze, and the rest of their famous friends and enemies,
as they were described in Italy: and present them here to
your Lordship, like the parts of Don John's body, intire,
although not breathing. For which I can make no A∣pologie,
but that 'tis the fortune of this History to be dedi∣cated
to Princes. And when the first Dedication was
made to the Duke of Parma; it concerned me to address
the second to a person of like honour: and my Genius di∣rected
me to such a one, in whom Eminence of Dignity is
joyned with Eminence of knowledg, that affording me Pa∣tronage;
this, reputation. For what Ammianus Mar∣cellinus
reports of Physitians, that they were held lear∣ned,
if they had once been at Alexandria; we know to
be true of Books if they come but to have your Lordships
Approbation: which is the highest aime of
