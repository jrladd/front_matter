SIR,
THE manifold undeserved Favours I have received from your Hands, being altogether a Stranger to you, have laid an eternal Obligation on me: And I being uncapable of making any re∣turn of Gratitude at so great a Distance, besides the acknowledgement of Your Courte∣sies, I have made bold to present you with the Perusul of a few Essays, of a dull Fancy, and my idle Hours. The Subjects treated on, tho' not handled with that Judgment and Fancy that an abler Pen
would have done; however, some of them may serve to intimate, that true Office of a Friend, which is to mind the eternal good of his Friend. Which unquestionably, Sir, is the utmost bent of Your Thoughts. However I do hope (Sir,) you will set a good Construction on this presumption of Mine; and axcept of these as a faint Ac∣knowledgment of Your unmerited Favours, from him who will ever remain,
