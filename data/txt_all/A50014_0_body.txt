My Lord,
I Am not unsensible that some part of the World, when they shall see your Lordships Name affixt to this Book, will be apt to say, That my inducements for laying it at your Honours Feet, are those generally made use of by Authors; to wit, the necessity of an Illustrious Patronage to defend the Work against the assaults of Envy and Ignorance: But I must beg leave to assure your Lordship and the World, that the true Reason for this my Dedication, ariseth from a well-grounded Belief, and the general concurrence of the Learned Part of this Nation, that your Honour is the properest Person to patronise a Work of this Nature, having by all the Actions of your Admired Life fully convinced the World, that you only are the absolute Master of the whole Body of PHILOSOPHY; and I my self have ever held it as a reasonable Position, That the Works of the Learned, like the Actions of the Noble, ought only to be judged by their Peers; nor can I think your Lordship, or any Learned Person will say, that a virtuous desire of Knowledge (and such I humbly conceive is Philosophy) needs or wants a Protection from any, since 'tis an experienced Truth, That Vir∣tue carries her own Safeguard, as well as her own Reward.
But as to the Subject Matter of this Book, and the method of handling it, I shall not say any thing, but refer your Lordship to the Book it self, of which your Honour is so great a Judge; having in my memo∣ry, the admonition of Apelles to Alexander the Great, speaking impro∣perly of the Noble Art of Painting; In things you understand not, says that Great Artist, be alwaies silent, lest by speaking, you betray a wantof Judgment. But as for the Designing and Engraving the SCUL∣PTURES which Imbellishes this Work, things more properly mine, than any other part of the Book, and in which through Practice and Ex∣perience I may be allowed to have some knowledge; I must beg leave to assure your Lordship, that they are, if not accurately, at least elaborately done; and had I not been therein concern'd, might have ventured to have said, they are the best over made publick in this Nature and Nation. And if they be so happy as to contribute in the least o your Honours Satisfaction, or Entertainment, I shall thereby be abundantly rewarded for all my Care, Charge and Trouble; for the very White at which I ainted, both in publishing this Book, and writing this Epistle, was to have it in my power to declare to your Lordship, that the ultimate of my Ambition is to serve you whilst I Live, and when Dead, to be recom∣mended to Posterity under this desirable Character, That I had the happi∣ness to be known to your Honour, who is allowed by all the Judicious, to be the Glory of the Age you live in, and to excel all that have gone before you, and to stand a Great, Noble, and hardly to be pattern'd Ex∣ample to those that shall succeed. And of You, most Noble Sir, 'tis with more Truth than Complement said, that HENRY Lord SYDNEY doth abundantly surpass both in Wisdom and Heroick Performances, the so much famed Sir PHILIP SYDNEY (whom, the Age he lived in, thought worthy to be a King) and▪ that in times to come they will mention his Alliance to you, to aggrandize his Character. Nor are these, my Lord, half the Hecatombs of Praise offered up to your great Merit, by the grateful and understanding part of Mankind; nor one third of what I might justly say: But such is your Lordships great Modesty, to be equalled by nothing but your Courage, that you always decline hearing a recital of your Illustrious Actions, tho' you never omit any opportunity of performing them: And therefore I shall only beg leave to tell your Honour, with all due Deference to your Exalted Station; that there is no part of the World which You have graced with Your Presence, and obliged with Your Goodness, is, or can be more truly sensible of what they owe You, or more willing entirely to sacrifice their All to your Lordships Service, than the Publisher of this Work; who is, may it please your Honour, with the most profound Respect imaginable,
My Lord,
