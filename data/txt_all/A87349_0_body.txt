MADAM,
WHen I first intended to publish these unwor∣thy Sermons, I did not thinke them fit to be Dedicated to any (much lsse unto you) or to bear any other name, save mine own; but afterwards, considering that the Vul∣gar people would hardly be moved to look into them, ex∣cept they did beare some good name before them, and knowing no name of better acceptation then your Ladi∣ships, I have been bold to use it, and that for divers rea∣sons: to passe by the maine and great obligation, where∣with I am bound unto your Ladiship, for which these weak endeavours may no way expresse my thankfulnsse, the Dedication of them being rather a disparagement, then an honour to your Ladiship, (but that I know your goodnesse to be such, that you had rather sustaine  such disparagement, then be wanting to the furtherance of a Common good.)
I say, to passe by this reason, which if it had been any, should have been the first; the true reasons why I have used your Ladiships name, are, first because what for the Antiquity of the House, of which you are descended, and the worthinesse of that whereunto you are united, but
 specially for the excellent and singular gifts, and graces which you have exercised, both in the North, and in the South of Wales, farther and wider then I expect, these Papers should be either seen or read, your name is preci∣ous, and will attract the vulgar eye, first to look upon it, and then upon my book.
The second reason is, that under your Ladiships name, I may finde protection against Detraction; and Envy, for I may not expect that this, as humble and as low a worke as it is, may passe without the envy of some, especially it proceeding from so meane and weake an Author as my selfe: one will blame me for not writing Welch, in Welch Character, another for mixing English words among the Welch, and a third for writing in Welch at all; when they shall cast an eye upon your Ladiships name in the Frontispiece, they will deliberate, & take time themselves to answer to their owne objections, rather then questi∣on what your Ladiship is pleas'd to owne in a gratefull returne for this and other favours, he shall be a daily Ora∣tour to the throne of Heaven, for the welfare of you, and of your family, that subscribes himself
Madam,
