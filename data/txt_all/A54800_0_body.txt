IT is an old Observation that one Misfortune always at∣tends
another. I have sufficiently experimented it; and
I may as justly say the same thing of my folly, in the
Conduct of my Life, and in what relates to this Play. It
was folly in me to Write at all, greater to Write no better,
and chiefly to Print what I have Writ. If in any thing I
have acted with Conduct and Prudence, 'tis in begging Pro∣tection
for this from your Grace, who are so able to shield
both this and its Author from their Enemies. And indeed,
I may say it is natural in me, to claim this from you; because
your Family have vouchsafed to be the Patrons of mine for
several Generations. Nor shou'd I doubt your proving so to
me, since you are replete with Goodness, and inherit all the
Virtues of your Ancestors, had I the least Pretence to say so
of my self; but I can only boast the same Zeal and Affection
for your Service and Interests.
I perceive that the Characters of Alboino and Rosamund
are not agreeable to the present Taste of the Town; the
best defence I can make is, that I have follow'd the truth
of the Story, as any one will find, who will take the Pains
to read it in the Fourth or Fifth Page of Machiavel's Hi∣story
of Florence: There are, without doubt, other faults in
it, I wish, those who have the Wit to observe them, wou'd
have the Candour to inform me of them, that if ever I am

Idle enough to write again, I might indeavour to avoid them:
And tho' this shou'd abound with more, yet I fancy, there are
many in this Town, who will have good or ill Nature enough
to acknowledge, there are great Allowances to be made to a
Man's first Play, and to a Man of Ireland.
A considerable time after this was Writ, I was inform'd,
That Sir William Davenant had made a Play on the same
Story; I knew it not before, nor have I yet seen it: It was
very unhappy for me to happen on the same Subject with so
Ingenious a Person; I suppose no one will think me design∣edly
guilty of such Confidence; that is a Vice, I hope I shall
never be justly tax'd with; and yet I have now insensibly
slid into it; for it does not argue greater assurance in one
so weak as I am, to write after him, than to write to you.
And therefore tho' I allow the Errors the Criticks may please
to find in this Trifle, and tho' I slight no one's Opinion or
Censures; yet they must excuse me, if I declare, I dread
not those so much, as that your Grace will not Pardon this
Presumption in,
May it Please your Grace,
