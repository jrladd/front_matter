May it please your Excellence, and your Honours,
WHEN I consider what Occa∣sion there is for the exhausting, and what Disadvantages we are under by the defacing of our Coyn, though I have but one Myte, I would gladly cast it into the Treasury.

My Offering is not considerable for Value, but I hope it will be found to be of just Weight. And since your Lord∣ships are the Keepers of CAESAR's Purse, I promise my self you will vouchsafe to look upon my Penny. To which if your Lordships will give your Stamp, I doubt not but it will pass for Sterling.
I know the Metal I bring is Course, but I must leave it to better Artists to Refine; I bring it to your Lordships, as we are wont to do our Gold and Silver to the Assay Masters, that if it bears your Touch, it may be Coyned, if it proveth Counter∣feit it may be Suppressed.
I am, my Lords,
