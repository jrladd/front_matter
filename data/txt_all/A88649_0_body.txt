Grave Senators,
Presents are accepted, not for their bulk, but for their Virtue; those smaller Offerings from mean per∣sons were under
the Law; not on∣ly appointed, but approved off by God himself; the Intention not the person commends the Gift: the grea∣ter may be more Specious, the lesse more precious; E∣ven the Widdows two mites, were not only not rejected
but received and commended by Christ himself.
Vpon these I gathered courage and confidence to Offer this small Tract to Your Noble Protection: who have suffici∣ent Ability to De∣fend it from In∣jury.

And I hope Your Honours will be willing to afford it your Ac∣ceptance; It spea∣king but what's true, and needfull at this present; It shews what other Nations have done, and to their utmost uphold, what this Land hath in former
times rightly and powerfully per∣formed by our vi∣ctorious Navies at Sea; and as tis ho∣ped and expected will be as resolute∣ly and powerfully Continued and Augmented by Your solid Wise∣dome, Your hap∣py and successeful Government. It
layes open those subtile and Inva∣ding Enemies the Dutch; with their unjust attempts a∣gainst us of this Nation, together with the manifold miseries our Land will be subject un∣to in a short time, if our Seas be de∣barred us by that Insolent people.

So praying that God would speci∣ally Assist and al∣wayes Direct you in all Your Hono∣rable and Weigh∣ty Consultations, I crave Pardon and Humbly
