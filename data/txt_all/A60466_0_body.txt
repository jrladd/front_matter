May it please Your Most Excellent Majesty,
ENcouraged by the Procla∣mation Your Majesty was graciously pleased to put forth some Months since, concerning the Fishing-Trade, and having gained some little Experience in that Particular, during my stay upon the Coasts of Shotland: I presume humbly to offer to Your Sacred Majesty the following Discourse, being a short Description of That, and the Ad∣joyning

Islands; the Conveniency of the Place, what course the Dutch have con∣tinually taken, in order to their carrying on that great Business; their Infinite Gain thereupon, and by what means the Industry of the English may render all their Trade there inconsiderable. Be∣seeching Your Majesty's Gracious Ac∣ceptance of this small Endeavour,
