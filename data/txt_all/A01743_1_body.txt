WHile I was at Norwich, in the yeere 1597, I writ this Treatise vpon such oc∣casion as appeares therein, and delivered it unto that Hereticke, that by himselfe, if God would, he might consider and be perswaded. Since which time I have kept it by me: and though some of my private friends desired copies; yet allow∣ing that wisedome of Solon, who would make no law against Pa∣tricide, lest the mention of the fact might give occasion to commit it: and withall considering that it is too simple and poore for the publike view, I refused to make it common. Yet after perceiving a present necessitie, because that some began to wander in this la∣byrinth: and withall remembring, that if any weakling shall here∣after entertaine this opinion, he may, before he be wholly posses∣sed therewith, find the absurdity of it and be reformed; that ma∣ny a novice in Christianity, who therefore doubts of the truenesse of his Religion, because he finds no familiar reason to per∣swade,
 but onely the racke of authorities to constraine him to ac∣knowledge it; may perhaps bee hereby satisfied and finde com∣fort: and that they who are already strong, may by this over∣plus, triumph in the goodnesse of God, who requires them to beleeve no more, then they may by that understanding, which hee hath given them, bee perswaded of: I have for their sakes who may reape benefit thereby, neglected all froward Censu∣rers, not guilty unto my selfe of any offence which I can commit in making it publike. Such as it is, accept (kinde Sir) as a par∣cell of that assertion, which may hereafter follow, of every Ar∣ticle of our Christian faith; if God shall vouchsafe me understan∣ding, leisure, and maintenance thereto. I therefore offer it unto you, both because I know you are diligent in reading of bookes of good argument; and because I have none other meanes, whereby to shew my selfe thankefull for your manifold kindnesses and your love.
 London, this 20. of April 1601.
