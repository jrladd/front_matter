My LORD,
WHen I had writ this small Philosophical Treatise, I was cast∣ing about in my thoughts, whether this Infant needed a Patron, it was not (as I judg'd) so much) an Embryo-An∣chorite or of such tender Age, but it might go abroad without hold; nor so much stricken in
years, as it had need of a Staff, in as much as ipsa veritas suimet patrona est maxima; nor yet that it was arriv'd to that full strength as to need no support: Amidst which considerations my Lord, your Grace fraught with experimental Philosophy came in view; but I stopt a while, pausing upon it, not daring at the first glance, to be so confi∣dent, till I had taken a better prospect of your personal can∣dour to Ingenuity; (which was not the least of those resplen∣dent Gems that adorn the brest of Nobility) your incouragement to the improvements of Philo∣sophy, grounded upon Mechani∣cal Experiments; your favouring
that for of Physick founded up∣on, and illustrated by the Noble Chymia, the Basis of a genuine Philosophical Hypothesis; and in particular your great condescen∣tion in familiar discourse con∣cerning matters of this nature: All which, My Lord, duly weigh∣ed, has given me the boldness to take liberty of dedicating these my Labours (the first of their kind, I know off, yet ex∣tant) to your Grace: If worth the perusal, it's well: with what curiosities they will enter∣tain you, let them speak for themselves. May these Philo∣sophical Speculations shade them∣selves under your Tutelage, and take shelter under your suffrage,
shall doubtless give them bet∣ter lustre abroad, rendring them more acceptable to others, and give him an incouragement to a further concern, who is
My Lord,
