Madam,
THe necessitous Melancholly hours that I have sustain∣ed in this place, have been the Authour of the Collecting this small Method of Devotions which I intended only for the private use of my Self and poor Children but being instigated by some Reverend Persons, to commit the same to publick view; I humbly beg
 leave of your Ladyship to let some lustre be added to it by setting your worthy Name to the Frontis∣piece thereof, being very confi∣dent, that so Illustrious a Person as your Self, being named at the beginning of this small Tract, will give great encouragement to all that shall see it, to believe that certainly there is something more in it, than in truth it is (had it come from the most Learned and Pious Prelate) especially when your Ladyship is considered to be the Daughter of so Reverend, Learned and Pious a Prelate as the Reve∣rend Father in God John late L. B. of London, deceased; and Sister of that most Reverend, Learned, and Pious Prelate Henry now L. Bishop of Chichester; besides your
 most worthy, pious, and vertuous Relations, who when you meet to∣gether, are under that Ecce of the Kingly Prophet; Behold how for good and joyful a thing it is Brethren to dwell together in unity, &c. for truly, Madam, a worthy Gent, who told me he had once the happinesse to see your La∣dyship, and great part of your own Relations together, which was as pleasant to him as the Dew of the sweetest Morning, and could not resemble you better to any thing, more than to the true Family of ov. Madam, I have seen very much my self, and know what a great blessing God Almighty sent that worthy Family where your Ladyship now is, when you came amongst them in your most pious
 and discreetest Government in all your Domestick affairs, be∣sides your learned and great Read∣ing, Madam, I do once more humbly beg your Ladyships pardon for this great presumption, and in doing that, Madam, you will add a great favour of Charity to him who hath been a very large sharer of your Ladyships Munificence, and shall ever pray for your ho∣nour and happiness, and the ho∣nour and happiness of that Family where you are now and continue,
Most vertuous Madam,

Castle at Glocester, the Feast day of the Annutiation of our Blessed Lady St. Mary the Virgin. 1669.
