HEartily praying the Lord and Head of the Church, to keep them in Unity, Peace, Humility, Vigilancy, and Stedfastness in the Truth; and to cause them to contribute their utmost endeavours for the setting up of able faithfull Teachers, and building up the House of God, which hath so long been neglected, and which hath now so many hands imployed to divide and demolish it: And that the Lord

would save them in this hour of Temptation, that they may be approved in this tryall, and not be found Light when God shall weigh them. And that he would acquaint them with the dai∣ly serious exercise of this most precious, spiritu∣all, soul-exalting work of HEAVENLY MEDITATION, and that when the Lord shall come, he may finde them so doing.
