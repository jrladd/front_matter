IF the Golden Axioms (Right Worshipful) of Grave Pytha∣goras be authentical, I am then by the influence of his flou∣rishing precepts induc'd to believe, that courtesies once received ought to be repaied with thanks; which har∣monical Nectar-sentence penetrating the (Daedalian) cittadel of my adrupt Muse▪

as also presenting th'Idaea of your kind∣nesse before the Theater of my contem∣plations; I could in conceit reap no (Ambrosian) applause of my capacity, untill (although in Baucis homely dish) I had presented you with the first April-fruits of my cerebrosities extraction: by vertue of which audacious resolution (arming my Muse with obedience, and my Pen with submissive humility) I have presum'd to present you this my unpolished Pamphlet, or rather to betake my FLOWER OF FIDELITIE under the (benigne) wings of your worthy patronage: the mate∣rial effect whereof (albeit deriv'd from the Index of Cytherea) I have so overvailed with the maske of chaste modesty, that I hope not onely the apparition of scandalising me∣thod is abolished, but also the Physnomy of superfluous amorous terms (which may not correspond with the climate of your complexion) utterly raz'd out. Accept therefore, worthily Worshipful, this my peevish Pamphlet, as the pledge of my zea∣lous affection; and grace my FLOWER OF FIDELITIE with this happi∣nesse, to be established in the fragrant Gar∣den

of your flourishing Library: so shall I esteem my Labours coroniz'd with the Laurel of content, my Muse invested with the exquisite Trophies of applause, and my selfe smooth'd up in the Terrestial Eden of fortunate delectation.
