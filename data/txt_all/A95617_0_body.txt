BEing called to this service by your command, I could not think of a fit∣ter subject, & more seasonable to the times and your places then this, tou∣ching the Kingdom of Christ: first, to set before you the chiefe employment God cals you to, and the duty lies upon you in it, that is, to study all the waies by which Iesus Christ may be best setled in his throne, and his government most spread throughout these parts of the world, where your work lies. Secondly, to hold out unto you the great encouragement to so great a work, in which you are sure to meet with so great oppositions; to let you know, God himself will carry it on, and Christs government shall be e∣stablished, notwithstanding the rage of people, and the plots of Princes against the Lord and his Annointed. If you go on in this cause with upright hearts, there is no reason your spirits should faint, or your hands slacken in fear of the issue: you are on a rising side, and in a work that
will improve it self. And indeed you have need of encouragement, even from heaven, to go on in the work of reformation of the Chuch, and of establishing Christs government amongst us, where the endeavours of many are so mighty to oppose it, and their tongues so malignant to disgrace it. But while your hearts are faithfull with God, resolve to goe on with Gods work, knowing you must passe through evill report as well as good report.2. Cor. 6.8. They who are called to great works, must be willing to sacrifice all, estate, credit, life, in the cause of God: so we keep faith and peace with God, and doe not shipwrack a good conscience, it matters not much what else we lose. If Christ carry you through the work here, he is all-sufficient to reward you hereafter. The Lord make all great mountaines that lie in your way,Iac. 4.7. to the setting up of the Kingdom of Christ, as plaines before you:Rev. 2.2. and in the end, reward your works, and your labour, and your patience; So praies,
From my Study in Battersea, Nov. 6. 1642.
