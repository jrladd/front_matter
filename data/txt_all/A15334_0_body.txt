IF men, nay, if vve our selues (brethren) that profes godlines, had any, either harts to conceiue, or eies to see, or mouths to speake, vve can not choose but beleue, behold and confesse the vvon∣derfull goodnes of Al∣mighty GOD tovvards this last, and yet vvorst age of the vvorld, vvherin vve liue, he hauing plentifully poured forth vpon it, so many excellent and great graces, specially spirituall, as no time heretofore hath bin indued vvith better: VVherof had vve nothing els to bear vvitnes, but that huge heap of
light and religion, that GOD hath made to break forth a∣mongst vs, it vvere sufficient not only to iustify & approue this truth, but to condemne the vvorld of horrible ingrati∣tude, in not thankefully receiuing, and of cursed carelesnes, either in abusing or not profiting by such singular fauour, some as vve see, notvvithstanding the sun-shine of GODS blessed vvord, vveltring and vvallovving in the blindnes and ignorance of their ovvn harts, not knovving vvhat a pretious ievvell it is; others in prophanenes and atheisme horribly scoffing and scorning at the same, notvvithstan∣ding the excellency therof; others talking of it for vaine iangling, but vvithout care of obedience, polluting by a levvd life that vvhich is most holy of it selfe; othersome making that vvhich is indeed spiritual, and as a man may say, heauenly, a stepping-stone of preferment and vvorldly glory; vvherunto being once lifted vp, they fall to fostring of pride in themselues, and disdainfull carping at others; som as sathans seruants and instruments, vsing, or abusing it rather, for the maintainance of erronious and hereticall opinions, &c. So that a man may safly and certainly con∣clude, that though the light of GOD be come into the vvorld, and hath indeed gloriously appeared amongst vs, yet men haue loued, and daily doo affect darknes rather than light.
But hovvsoeuer the strength of this impietie doo most plainely and plentifully appeare in the desperate vvicked of the vvorld, the poison of this infection, hauing spread it self abroad, from the very heart of the vngodly into all their veines and sinnevvs, so that all the partes of their bodies, and povvers of their soules are polluted therevvith, yet shall vvesee, that by reason of the remainders of originall iniquitie, some stinch of the same hath burst foorth, euen in the sonnes and seruants of God, though not to defile them
vvith such fearefull transgressions as the vvicked of the vvorlde are ouertaken vvithall, yet to hinder them from the doing of such holie duties, as vvherevnto, in pietie to∣vvards GOD, and in charity tovvards men, they are (if my iudgement faile me not) straitly bound, vvhilest some of them, considering mens setlednes in sin, and hovv hard they are frozen in the dregs of their iniquity, and hauing fevv or no arguments of doing good, labor little or nothing at all; othersome againe vveighing the vvorthines of gods graces, and being loth to offer the glorious mysteries of the Lord to open despite, and so thereby to increase the con∣demnation of the vvicked, doe leaue off all means almost to reclaime men from vvickednes, and to vvinne them to GOD.
VVhat I vvrite novv, the godly of the land vvil vvit∣nes vvith me I thinke, and the small labors publike or pri∣uat, of men othervvise vvell qualified, and the little fruit flovving from the same, vvil yeeld sufficient proofe: yea, as I knovv by practise and experience in some, so I feele the same by assaults and suggestions in my selfe, to vvhich, though mine ovvn naturall corruption, and the vvorld of vvickednes that is vvithin me, do bid me gladly consent, yet that poore portion of grace (I account it so, not as it commeth from GOD, but as it is tainted through my sin) that God hath bin pleased to bestovv vpon me, vvil hardly suffer me to yeeld, bicause I see no reason in truth, vvhy o∣ther mens sins, or the imperfections of GODS children should vtterly discourage them from doing the duties that GOD hath laid vpon them, for if vve should so doo, vve should neuer perform any seruice to GOD, men, or our selues, bicause ther vvill be alvvays vvickednes in the vvorld, and manifold vveaknesses and vvants, euen in the dearst saints and seruants of GOD.

The thing that I rather vvish vvith all my hart, is, that euery one of vs, and my selfe especially, in due examination of our ovvne souls, might through Gods great goodnes to∣vvards vs in Christ, find our selues fit, not only in affection & good vvil, but in al heuenly strength & spiritual knovv∣ledge also, our manifold transgressions being remoued and doone avvay, according to our measure of graces receiued, in this behalfe, to do good vnto many. For mine ovvn part, I vvillingly acknovvledge my selfe the meanest and the basest of many my good brethren in the ministery of GOD: yea so far off am I from presuming any thing as of my selfe, that I do asvvell in the sight of my sins before GOD, and feeling vvithal of his hand of iustice and iudgement vpon me for the same, as in the acquaintance that I haue vvith mine insufficiency ye ignorance before men (both vvhich (no doubt) may iustly cause me to be dull and heauy in eue∣ry good duty) think (and so do vnfainedly confes) my selfe vnfit and vnmeet for such vvorthy vvorks. And yet I cannot but lay foorth this much, that relying vppon the goodnes of the cause, and hoping (though it seeme almost against hope) that GOD vvill giue a greater blessing to the carefull and christian labours of his seruants, than vve can see vvith the eie of flesh and bloud, I haue bin bold to publish this litle treaty, vvherby, if the mouths of such e∣nimies of GOD, as bark against his holy truth, may in som sort be stopped, and the comfort and instruction of his peo∣ple prouided for, I shall haue vvherin to reioice, as for the common good, so on your behalfe (my very deare friends) of vvhom I am asvvell persuaded as of my selfe, and to some of vvhom (I freely confes it) I ovve in Christ more than my selfe, if I could tell hovv to pay it. But not being able to perform that, and vvithall vnvvilling to continue still in my vnthankefulnes (I must confes it) tovvards you,
I haue thought meet novv at the length, to offer vnto you in print that vvhich I once vvrote, for the best and dearest priuate friend, next vnto my naturall parents, that euer I had in this vvorld, that as GOD hath stirred you vp, to succeed him in kindnes tovvards me, so I might make you (as those vvhom I loue much in Christ) partakers of those poore labors and loue that I performed tovvards him. In vvhich respect also I am vvillingly content to let it come abroad to behold the light, not only desiring you and euery of you to accept it, as a small token of my vnfained good∣vvill, vvhich vvhen it can offer no better presentments that it hath, but also praying the Lord to make it povver∣full to aduance his ovvne vvorke of saluation in his seruants, and of iudgement and confusion, in all his and their obstinate enimies.
