Great Sirs,
THe following Tract, humbly offered to your Lordships, and for which the Author implores your Patronage, is a brief, but yet true and impartial History of
the Life and Policies, the Rise and Fortunes, Troubles and Exit of the late Earl of Shaftsbury, whose great Actions, constant Loyalty, and successful Councils, certainly are worthy the transmitting to Po∣sterity; for whose sake, as well as the vindicating his Name and Ho∣nour from the bold and confident, although ridiculous and groundless Calumnies wherewith the Roman Achitophels have maliciously asper∣sed him. I have endeavour'd to Decipher him, and draw his Image according to the best of my skill, although infinitely below his De∣serts; which justly merit the being pourtray'd by a more skilful hand; and one whose extraordinary ac∣quirements, and admirable profi∣ciency in Politicks, renders capa∣ble of representing his Lordships wonderful Parts and Abilities, in the most apt and lively Touches.
Especially in regard the malice of  hath somewhat  his best Feature, and un∣fully sullyed the most Beau∣tiful and Loyalest of his Actions.
My Lds. It was the extraordinary Endowments wherewith this Earl was inrich'd, that drew upon him so much Envy, and swell'd his Ad∣versaries to such an heighth of Ma∣lice and Fury; fearing lest he might prove their Rival, and ac∣quire a greater Interest in the Fa∣vour of his Soveraign, then they were willing he should. Or else it was his imitation of the magna∣nimous Roman, who being Com∣manded by the Emperor to for∣bear coming to the Senate, and threaten'd with Imprisonment if he presumed to appear in that As∣sembly, boldly answer'd, You may do as you will, but I must do as I ought. Nor had ever any Man
larger Experience (then his Lord∣ship) of the truth and reality of what the famous Sir Walter Raleigh so long since wisely observed, That he who follows Truth too near at the Heels, may have his Teeth struch out thereby; and that he who goes after her, oft loseth her sight and himself too.
Most Noble Patriots, I acknow∣ledge that it is no small persecu∣tion of your Illustrious Greatness, to be thus troubled with the im∣pertinent Address of one so much below you. And am very sensible, that the Generosity and good Na∣ture of persons, who, like your selves, shine with Glory and Splen∣dor in a superiour Orb, frequently draw upon them unnecessary and needless Dedications. And there∣fore I should not have been guilty of presuming to six your Honou∣rable Names to any trifle of mine,
had not the nature of the thing laid a kind of necessity upon me, and furnished me with an unan∣swerable Argument and sufficient Apology for so doing.
May it please your Lordships, You are all under the same Circum∣stances, and you have (like him) adventur'd to stem the Stream, and dared to be Virtuous, when to be wicked and debauch'd is in Fashion: And have presumed to be Loyal, under the disadvantage of exposing your selves thereby to the malice and rage of a sort of Men, who with an Hellish Indu∣stry have long endeavour'd to Me∣tamorphise your very Virtues into Vices; and Transubstantiate your Loyalty into a Crime. You have with a firm resolution and un∣daunted courage, opposed in the very face of danger, the ambiti∣ous and growing designs of a
bloody and malicious Crew, who have Burned our City, Assassinated our Magistrates, Forged Shame Blots, and invented Meal-Tub Conspira∣cies to ruine our Nobility and Gen∣try. And if Divine Goodness had not protected us, and disappointed them, would have murther'd our Soveraign, Massacred our Persons, Extirpated our Religion, Plunder'd our Houses, seized our Estates, trampled upon our Laws, inslaved our Wives and Children, and sub∣jected our Posterity to a Bondage infinitely worse then that of Egypt. And whatsoever is Sacred and Dear to us as English Men or Christians, must have been sacri∣fic'd to their Revenge; for the sa∣tiating whereof, and to give vent to their fury, they would have turn'd the Paradise of the World into an Acheldama.

And moreover, my Lords, his Enemies are your Enemies, his Re∣proaches are all directed at and centre in You. You were all to be involved in the same Guilt, and made Parties in the same preten∣ded Conspiracy. And You were by an imaginary Power (derived from that Infallible Fop the Pope) all condemned to the same Fate, in the secret Consults and private Cabals of Rome, as appears by the Scheme found in the Meal-Tub, and after∣wards more fully discovered by Mr. Dangerfield. Nor is it unwor∣thy Your consideration, that the time when that cursed Conspiracy was hatching, and some Circum∣stances in the management thereof, renders it not altogether improba∣ble, that it derived its Original from, and was ingaged in, upon the success of a certain Story; upon the account whereof, the
greatest of You stands at this day strip'd of all Your Honorary Places.
But that which further encou∣rag'd me to make this Address to Your Lordships, was, Your being his intimate Acquaintance and constant Companions, his familiar Friends, and only Associates, with whom he maintained an exact Correspondence, and almost daily conversed withal; whereby You must necessarily be better acquain∣ted with, and have a clearer pro∣spect of the Principles and Temper, Designs and Inclinations of his Lordship, than any of his detra∣ctors can possibly pretend to: since many of them never had any personal knowledge of, and much less intimate Acquaintance with him; and most of them never saw him in their Lives. Nor have many of his Accusers, notwithstanding
their formal and confident charging him with Treason, ever born a Part, or made a Figure large enough in the World to procure them admit∣tance to his Person, or imbolden them to appear in his presence, or so much as exchange two words with him in their whole Lives. You know his Loyal Behaviour towards, and constant cleaving to the Inte∣rest of his Soveraign; and are sur∣viving Testimonies of the extra∣ordinary Reverence and profound Veneration wherewith he always made mention of His Majesty, whensoever you had occasion to speak of him in Your publick or private Discourses; nor can You have forgotten his frequent lamen∣ting his own unhappiness, in being so strangely mis-represented to His Majesty.
And, may it please Your Lord∣ships, as Heaven has been so
propitious to the Earl to remove him far above the reach of his Enemies Fury, so I am firmly assured, that the same Almighty Power will always protect your Lives and Honours from the dire effects of Romish Policy, and all the Jesuitical Crafts and subtle Artifices of the Antichristian Crew. And render the implacable malice of those, whom all intelligent Men begin now to see are Your Ene∣mies without cause, unable to effect any thing to Your prejudice And make it serve only as a File to set off the Glory of Your Loyalty, or like an Eclipse to the Sun, make the Lustre of Your Innocence appear to the whole World with the more Brightness and Splendour; or at least, enable You to take an extraordinary plea∣sure and satisfaction in the delight∣ful contemplation, That Your
Name, shall live when theirs are dead, and survive with Honour, whilst theirs with Infamy and Shame shall be buried in Oblivion; and that the remembrance of your Virtues shall be to all succeeding Ages, as Odoriferous as the Ara∣malick Spices, and the exhilera∣ting Perfumes of Arabia, or the delightful fragrancy which natu∣rally flows in the Months of April and May from a Garden of Roses: When the remembrance of their wicked and treacherous Enter∣prises shall be nauseous and offen. five to all Men.
But the Fabrick being so small, I must not suffer the entrance into it to exceed an equal pro∣portion; nor by enlarging my dull praises of the deceased Earl, injuriously detain your Lordships too long from the Harmony of his Actions; the Reviewing whereof
afford abundantly more delight and satisfaction than any thing I am able to say in his commen∣dation can probably yield. And therefore (wishing your Lord∣ships may long shine as Stars in our British Hemisphere, and in conjunction with our glorious Sun, send forth such Illustrious Beams and powerful Rayes, as may effectually dispel those sable Clouds which have so long over∣spread and darkened our Island) I commend Your Lordships to the protection of him that sits in the Heavens, and laughs at the Ma∣chivilian Plots of Rome, and sees and derides all their subtile En∣terprises; hoping he will graci∣ously defend you from all impen∣ding dangers, by hiding you in the hollow of his Hand, and un∣der the shadow of his Wing. And humbly beg you would put
a candid construction upon my presuming so rudely to obtrude a Dedication upon you; and intreat a favourable Acceptance of the mean and incongruous Present of him who is really ambitious to subscribe himself,
