My LORD,
THE Design of the ensuing Discourse, now made publick by your Lordships Order, is to promote Truth and Righteousness and Peace amongst men, and so eminent an Instrument has your Lordship been, both by your Example and Authority, to dash the growing impudence of the contrary vices, that I presume it need not much doubt of your Lordships Shelter and Protection; the seasonableness of it, in this loose and ungovernable Age, will I hope, somewhat atone for its want of dress and elegancy; however, I am con∣ten, it should be thought without Wit and without Art in the Composure, so
 it be not without truth in the substance, nor without profit in the consequences of it; may it therefore, by the blessing of God, succeed to the producing in some good measure its design'd and desir'd effects in the minds of men, and may your Lordship and Honourable Brethren live many and many days to serve God, the King and establisht Government in Church and State, and thereby become restorers of Peace, and Virtue, and Uni∣formity to this (at present) unhing'd, and discompacted City, is the earnest Prayers of,
My Lord
