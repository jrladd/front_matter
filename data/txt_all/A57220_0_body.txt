MY LORD,
AS His most Sacred MAJESTY (whose Life and happy Raign God long preserve) did very
Providentially make Choice of Your Lordship, as a signal Instrument in that great and
glorious Action; which un∣der God was the Preservation of His MAJE∣STY and His Kingdoms: So was
Your Lord∣ships
readiness as Eminent in the performance of all His Sacred commands; insomuch that
by the Loyal obedience, the Conduct, Care and Courage of Your Honourable self, together with Your
Illustrious Associates, there was a short end put to the raging torrent of an unparallell'd
Re∣bellion; wherein the influence of Your Lord∣ships examples wrought Miracles never to be
forgotten.
My Lord,
As I had often the Honour to be a witness of Your Lordships brave and generous behaviour
towards His MAJESTIE'S Forces, so I had the further Honour of being commanded by Your Lordship
into the Pulpit, and afterwards to commit that to the Press, which I had de∣livered before to the
Army, which could I with modesty have declined, had been.
But since the Discourse was chiefly upon Non-Resistance, I ought not to be
the first that should dare oppose Your Lordships commands in that particular, being
resolved to be obedient in all others.
And though I know the following Discourse may upon the reading of it, be subject to the
Censure of some, who I believe will not be back∣ward
to asperse even Majesty it self; yet I am the more at ease, because I
reckon my self to be under the Protection of a person whose Character gives a reputation to
all that have the Honour to serve him.
Nor can I, My Lord, but be sensible of Your Lordships Candid acceptance of the
little Ser∣vice I did in my happy Intercepting the two Posts and Letters of the Rebels, and
bringing them to your Lordship; which was the occasion of Your Commands on me, to Preach the
next day; and having therein obeyed Your Lordships Com∣mand, Your Goodness hath given me some
sort of Title to presume upon this Dedication, which begs only Your Pardon for the confidence
of a Loyal Subject; and a person otherwise at Your Lordships devotion, by all the tyes that
can ob∣lige an honest man, and,
My Lord,
