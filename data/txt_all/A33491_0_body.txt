THE Church's aim in all her Services was to make them reasonable; and therefore, she hath not only put them in a known Tongue, but also instructs us in the Nature of them, making her Prayer-Book a Sum of Divinity; but because we are fal∣len into an Age, that many (who call themselves Saints) do actually mock and ridicule her sacred Offices: It's surely a Duty incumbent on all her Obedient Children, to vindi∣cate the Honour of their Holy Mother the Church.
I thought it therefore Time not ill spent (having re∣tired my self to a Private Life) to collect such Reasons out of the Writings of the Reverend Bishops and Do∣ctors of the Church of England, as may justifie not only her Commands, but enforce our Obedience to her Pious Edicts, and to the Observance of her lawful Ceremonies: And that my Affection may last longer than my Life, I present ye with these my First-Fruits, hoping, that not only the Example and constant Practice of your Ancient Father, but his Advice and Counsel, may prevail with you to persevere to the End, in the Doctrine and Disci∣pline of that Church in which ye have been Baptized, Educated and Instructed, and let not Men deceive you with vain Words.

I only at First, designed these Collections for my own private Satisfaction, but I was prevailed upon by some Friends to make them Publick; for this Reason, because they assured me they would be of Use and Advantage to those of the meaner Understanding, and not despised by others that knew them already; which I chuse to say that I may prevent the Censure of those that may think this Publication proceeds from an itching Desire of Applause, or at least from Vain-Glory.
Let not the Meanness of my Performances lessen your Reverence to the Holy Offices of our Church, but live in the constant Use and Practice of them, and the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, will bless you both in Soul and Body, guiding ye by his Counsel here, and bringing ye at last to his Glory; which is the hearty Prayer of
