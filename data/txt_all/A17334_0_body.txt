THis Sermon, being at first exacted by reuerend authori∣ty, and since pulled foorth by violent importunity, and euen pressed to the Presse, inioyeth this onely freedome, that it runneth cheerefully to your Lordships
hands, presenting it selfe a true (howso∣euer slender) testimony of the Authors thankefull and dutifull respect, of your honourable fauours, not onely in particu∣lar towards himselfe, whom you haue beene pleased to grace farre beyond de∣sert; but also in generall to Gods Mini∣sters, whom with a iust and zealous care, you as Gods vpon earth protect from oppression. Who seeth not, how resolute witnesses hauing armed themselues to se∣duce a tractable Iury, with as formall a tale, as the two Elders had deuised a∣gainst Susanna; your Lordship full of the spirit of Daniel, that is, the iudge∣ment of God (for so his name signifieth) by prudent sifting, and vnexpected inter∣rogatories, haue bunted out, and dissol∣ued their plotted falshood? Who seeth not, how vnaccustomed customes incro∣ching
vpon the Lords portion, allotted and allowed to his Laborers, haue shew∣ed as faire pretences of remote Antiqui∣ty, as were the old sackes, old bottles, old clothes, and mouled bread of the Gibeonites, when your discreet inquiry before the Inquest hath espied and descri∣ed their neere bordering neighbourhood? In a word, your Christian care to main∣taine the hedge of Iustice for a fence to the Lords vine (that euery one which passeth by, may not plucke of her grapes) putteth into our mouthes a ioy∣full gratulation, that your Honours are none of them that seek honor, by muzze∣ling the mouth of the Oxe, that trea∣deth out the Corne. And this leadeth vs to a farther duty, viz. to looke vp to∣wards Heauen vnto him, that looketh downe from heauen vpon vs, to behold
and visit his vine, which he hath plan∣ted with his owne right hand, and made strong for himselfe: and as hee hath giuen vs such nursing Fathers, so we to returne vnto him prayse for your good beginnings, and prayer for your good continuance, to the glorie of his Name, the vpholding of his Church, the incou∣ragement of his Ministers, and your owne eternall reward, through Iesus Christ our Lord, Amen.
