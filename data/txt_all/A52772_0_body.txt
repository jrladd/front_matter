Good SIR,
HAving had the Ho∣nour, as well as the Happiness, for these Four Years past, all the Time I

was at Sea, to be your Sur∣geon, in His Majesty's Ships, the Monk, and Windsor, as an Acknowledgement of the ma∣ny Favours, I have receiv'd from you, I humbly beg leave to Dedicate this small Trea∣tise to you.
Sir, It is a difficult Mat∣ter, for all that know you, to say, whether your Good∣ness, Courage, or Care be greatest.
As to your Goodness, your Friends, Relations, Officers, Sailors, Prisoners, Menial

Servants, and private Ene∣mies, I have seen and known, sufficiently to taste thereof.
As to your Courage among others, that Action at Cama∣rett Bay, where you Com∣manded the Monk, will for ever speak for you; when all your Decks were cover'd with Blood, and the poor shatter'd Remains of dead Bodies: Your inimitable Courage then, like Lightning, struck such a Spirit and Life through all your Men, as made them ea∣ger, even to engage the Stone-Walls,

which secured the E∣nemy from them: And you like a Second Alexander, as one of the Admirals was plea∣sed to style you, for that Day's Action; or rather Hannibal, would have broke your Way through Rocks and Piles of Stone, to serve your Coun∣try.
As to your Care, you have been pleas'd to make your self a perfect Slave to it, ear∣ly and late; remarking still all Action, during our tedious Voyage.

In a Word, His Majesty can never want a Faithful, Good, Brave, and Careful Commander while you live, to serve him. And that all I have here mentioned of you, is perfect Truth, and not Flattery; the frequent Sub∣ject of other Mens Dedicati∣ons, I defie, Envy it self, to maintain the Contrary.
Go on, Good Sir, and may you be prosperous in all your Undertakings; may you meet with a suitable Reward here for all your just, useful and painful Services, and in

Heaven hereafter, an immor∣tal and incorruptible Seat of Glory, is the hearty Wish of,
