GENTLEMEN, expect not in this my slender
volume, amorous passions of some Courtly Louer,
graced (as the custom is, with super fine rethoricall
phrases: look not here for some melodious ditties, de∣scended
from the wel-tuned strings of Apollos sweet-soun∣ding
Cittern: here plainly haue I presented vnto your view
rusticke Tyterus, rehearsing in rude countrey tearmes to his
fellow Thirsis his happy blisse, and luckie fortune in obtay∣ning
the loue of his desired Phillida: Or clownish Coridon,
one while taking and giuing quaint taunts and priuy quips
of and to his froliking Copesmates: One while againe con∣tending
for superiority, in tuning rurall ditties on Pans pa∣storall
pipe. Now Gentlemen, if with Coridon, you shall
find me not to play so well as the rest of my fellowes, my
sole and humble request is, that you would not foorth with
proceed in condigne iudgement against me, but with wise
Faustus concale your opinion, which doing, you shall ani∣mate,
otherwise altogether discourage a yong beginner.
