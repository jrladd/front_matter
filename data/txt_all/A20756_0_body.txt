THere is no time (Right Hono∣rable) for carelesse securitie, when there is no place free from danger: But whilest a Christian liueth in this world he is encom∣passed with perils, walketh a∣mong snares, and is beset on all sides with many mighty ene∣mies. For though hee were at peace with all visible creatures, yet those  of which the Apostle speaketh, doe in all times and places make warre against him. Without him there are many legi∣ons of wicked spirits assisted with the strong aydes of worldly enemies, which beeing farre superiour vnto him in power and policie doe besiedge and beset him on euery side, watching all opportunities to worke
 his destruction; within him he harboureth many se∣cret traitors euen innumerable fleshly lusts, which (if hee preuent not the danger by continuall watchful∣fulnesse) are euer ready to open the gates of his soule and letting in those forraigne forces, to ioyne vvith them in spoiling him of those rich treasures, Gods sauing graces, and in making him thc miserable cap∣tiue of sinne and Sathan. In which regard it becom∣meth all Christian Souldiours whiles they liue in the Church militant, not to dreame of peace or ease, but to stand alwaies in their station with vndaunted va∣lour, and vnwearied watchfulnesse, and to bee armed continually with the whole armour of God that they may resist these enemies and obtaine the victory. But especially this courage and care is required of Gods Ministers, that they may with Timothy  2. Tim. 1. 18. . Vnto which is required not onely that they bee valourous in fighting the Lords battailes, but also prudent and skilfull in the militarie discipline, that they may bee able to teach and traine others in these feates of Armes and how to vse their valure, strength and weapons for their best aduantage, seeing they are called of God, not to be common Souldiers but Captaines and Leaders of his holy armies The consideration and conscience of which dutie hath moued me (the least and vnworthi∣est of this number) to intreat of this Christian War∣fare, that for the present the weake and vnskilfull might haue some helpe and direction for the streng∣thening of themselues and defeating of their ene∣mies, vntill some of Gods greatest Worthies doe vn∣dertake this taske and purtray perfectly this spiritu∣all patterne of militarie discipline, which I (as I
 could) haue rudely delineated. The finishing of which worke in all the parts thereof was when I first vndertooke it, in regard of my weakenesse and other imployments in the worke of my ministerie, so farre in my conceipt aboue my hopes, that I durst scarce aspire vnto it in my highest desires, though in this kinde ambitious aboue my strength. And yet now the Lord who taketh delight to manifest his power in the weakenesse of his instruments, hath enabled me to finish the last part of this worke. And as in the other parts to describe the Warfare betweene the Christian and his forraigne enemies, the Diuell and the World, with the meanes whereby hee may bee inabled to ouercome; so in this, the intestine warre that is in our selues betweene the Spirit & the Flesh: wherin if we will get the victorie we must after a sort flee and abandon our selues, and if wee will kill our enemies, wee must mortifie and crucifie our earthly members. The which my poore labours I humbly offer to your Honours patronage, not because I thinke them worthy your learned view, or so perfect that they may merit approbation in your iudicious censure, but that passing as tolerable in your esti∣mate, they may appeare euen commendable to wea∣ker iudgements, and (like meane seruants of Hono∣rable Lords) may be more esteemed and better en∣tertained, when as they come abroad graced with your name. Neither haue I offered this Discourse of Christian Warfare to your view (like Phormio to Annibal) as though I thought I could hereby adde any thing to your skill in this militarie discipline: but onely that it might finde shelter vnder such Ho∣nourable shade against the stormes of seuerer cen∣sures,
 knowing that the weaker the pupill is the more neede he hath of a strong Patron and Guardian. Nor dare I say that hereby I desired to honour your name by commending it to posteritie as truely honoura∣ble (although these paper monuments are often∣times more durable then those which are erected of lasting Marble) for what glory can my dimme candle adde to your sunshine? And what increase can my mite add to your treasury? And yet though the main Ocean bee neuer the fuller by the accesse of small springs and little streames; notwithstanding they run into it, as taking some delight to doe their homage; and those who are of meanest abilitie to honour their superiours, doe take some pleasure in indea∣uouring to doe it, because hereby they manifest their will, and in their greatest impotencie expresse in some sort their loue and dutie. The which not onely your personall worth may challenge as due from all of my profession, as excelling in those treasures which we onely acknowledge worth the coueting, the vn∣valuable riches of the minde in all kindes, especially those chiefely precious Iewels learning and religion: but also the outward exercise of these excellent en∣dowments for the good of others, by letting hereto∣fore some streames (vnualuable in their worth and vnmatchable in their kinde) flowe out in common from the fountaine of your rich minde; and now in place of honour and gouernment by approuing your selfe a notable pillar of Gods holy Temple, in profes∣sing and vpholding his true Religion, a worthy Mae∣cenas of the Godly learned, and a faithfull and vncor∣rupted Patron vnder his excellent Maiestie, in the freee bestowing of Church-preferments vpon such
 as you conceiue are worthy to bee preferred. The Lord inrich you more and more with all gifts and graces of his holy Spirit, and make you faithfull vnto the end in the imploying of his rich talents, which he hath committed so bountifully vnto you, for the aduancement of his glory, and good of his familie; that so when you are called to giue an account of your Stewardship you may doe it with ioy, hearing that blessed Euge: Well done thou good and faithfull seruant, thou hast beene faithfull ouer a few things, I will make thee ruler ouer many things: Enter thou into the ioy of thy Lord.
