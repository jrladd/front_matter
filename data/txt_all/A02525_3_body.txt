RIGHT Honourable, I
know, and in all humility
confesse, how weake my
discourse is, and how vn∣worthy
of this diuine subiect which I
haue vndertaken, which if an Angell
from heauen should say he could suffici∣ently
comment vpon, I should distrust
him. Yet this let mee say, (without any
vaine boasting) that these thoughts
(such as they are) through the blessing

of God, I haue wouen out of my selfe, as
holding it (after our Sauiours rule) bet∣ter
to giue then to receiue. It is easier to
heape together large volumes of others
labours, then to worke out lesser of our
owne, and the suggestion of one new
thought is better then many repeated.
This part (which together with the
Author is yours) shall present to your
Lordship, the busiest of all the Patri∣archs,
together with his trialls, and suc∣cesse:
wherein you shall see Esau strip∣ped
by fraud, of that which hee willingly
sold, Iacobs hard aduentures for the
blessing, and no lesse hard seruices for
his wiues and substance, his dangerous
encounters ending ioyfully, the rape of
his onely daughter seconded with the
trecherous murder of his sons, Iudahs
wrong to Thamar repayd by his owne
vncleannesse: Iosephs sale, imprison∣ment,

honour, piety; The sinne of his
brethren well bestowed, well answered. I
so touch at the vses of all these, as one
that know, it is easie to say more, and
impossible to say enough. God giue a
blessing to my endeuours, and a pardon
to my weakenesses; to your Lordship, an
increase of his graces, and perfection of
all happinesse.
