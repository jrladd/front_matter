TO you, in whom knowledge & goodnesse meet,
Whose ends are honest, and whose sole conâˆ£tent
Is to revive your heart-sicke patient,
In humblest sort, as Clients use to greet
Their pious Patrons, doe I make retrait:
To whom I owe my selfe, my life, my love,
My praise, my prayers, next to the Powers above.


The high Physitian, in whose glorious hand
The globes of Heaven and Earth contained are,
Give blessing to your cure, cure to your care,
Prosper your practice both by sea and land,
And give successe to what you understand:
For in you I have found, what's rare to finde,
A curious knowledge in a vertuous minde.



For th'artlesse Mounteb anke, whose cure's to care
How to deceive a Gull, so much I hate it,
I wish but execution of the Statute,
To such penurious venters of base ware,
Who, as Hippocrates relateth, dare
Purchase, by Patients death, a little art,
Which they by peece-meale sell at ev'rie Mart.


For you, so long as life runs th'row these veines,
I will retaine a gratefull memorie,
And blaze the fame of your integritie
n such a these, or in some choycer straines,
To gratifie your care, your cure, your paines:
For if we honour him that gives us wealth,
What owe we him that gives us life and health?
"For had I treasure offer'd, I'de refuse it,
"Wanting the sov'raigne meanes of health to use it.
