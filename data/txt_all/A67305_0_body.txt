THERE is a secret Pleasure as well as Awe in addressing to those above us, we flatter our selves that from their height we receive some addition to our own, that we are like Vapours drawn up by their Influence; it satisfies our Ambition, the most prevailing Passion of the most elevated Souls, but when, besides the advantages of Birth and Fortune, they have all the powers of the Soul in full Perfection, its Operations, Harmonious, piercing Wit, quick Apprehension, unerring Judgment, qualified with the most candid Temper inclineing to o'relook the defects of their In∣feriours, all these crownd with the most engaging graces of an agreeable inviting Conversation, then our Souls are truly ravished, 'tis then we really are what we cannot express. How then must I be extasid when blest with that Eloquence which charm'd the Savage Indians, with Orphean strains infus'd a Soul into the Barbarous World? What greater proof of all your Virtues, than his Most Sacred Majestyes choice of you to represent his Royal Person in an Island which none but you could govern? Whose Inhabitants are by Nature brave and generous, but by their unhappy distance from our World deprived of all advantages by Learning and Polite Converse, so that they required
 a Philosopher as well as Politician for their head. How wisely you discharg'd that office their Improvements demonstrate, their noble fortifications speak you as great a Warriour as your judicious Laws and prudent Management a Politician, and both the most lively Image of your Royal Master: But what commands at once our Thanks and Admiration, is, that you Civiliz'd the People, Grafted good Breeding on this unpolisht stock, Refin'd their Principles in Re∣ligion, Policy and Manners, and by your own most Instructive Ex∣ample made 'em indeed Humane: You Inform'd the Ignorant, Con∣firm'd the Wise, with your winning Behaviour brought over even Prejudice, and with a becoming Grandeur curb'd those insolent Seditious Spirits whom no King could govern nor no God could please; this indeed was a Master-stroke which we must admire without presuming to comprehend. To whom then should my poor Off-spring sue for Pro∣tection but to him in whom all Virtues meet that are Essential to a Patron? You honoured me with your presence at its Representation, and 'twas my ambition it should be as happy in the Press as upon the Stage, which has drawn upon you the inconvcnience of a Dedication; so dangerous is it to countenance a young Poet who upon one favour builds his pretentions to another: That which most emboldened me was the great Esteem you have ever expressed for my Father, this made me presume you would protect his Son; but I forget while I beg your Patronage I should also beg your Pardon for detaining you with such a trifle from Affairs of the greatest moment, and that I may not persist in my rudeness I beg leave to assure you, I am with all Sincerity,
SIR,

London, the 14th July, 1698.
