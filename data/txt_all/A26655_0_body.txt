MY Lord, this ensuing Treatise comes to Salute the World, and appear upon the publick Stage under the Honorable Shade and Patrociny of your name, not presuming to add any Lustre thereunto, where∣of it is uncapable, and whereof your Lordships Prudence and Vertues have been such publick Heraulds to the World, that I shall rather im∣pose a Cessation to my Pen, and enjoyn my self a necessary silence, as my highest Encomium, than be Guilty, with Apelles in forming of the Image, of interweaving the constrained Fail∣zeurs of my best Rhetorick with your Lordships deserved Commendation.
But knowing the hazard of these publick Scenes, and the Worlds view, where there is always a Momus ready to carp, it comes to seek
shelter under your Lordships favorable Pro∣tection, whereunto it is also encouraged with good hopes of obtaining the cheerful Countenance of your Authority, because of your Pious and Lau∣dable Zeal against all the enemies of our Ortho∣dox Faith, and the Divine Truth; especially these pernicious and (beyond all Heathens) most inhumane Proto-plasta's of Quakerism (I mean the Jesuits) unto whom the latter Profession owes the Founding of their Order, and a great many of their Principles, be they never so shie and nice to Confess it.
It doth also with Modest humility lay claim to one interest into your Lordships Tutelage be∣cause, albeit it was elsewhere conceived, and had the form of one Embryo, yet it hath re∣ceived its just measures for a regular Birth with∣in the precinct of your Honorable Jurisdiction, and though of Scottish Parentage, yet it is truly London Born.
I know very well there are many in this de∣clining Age of Christianity, who account all Dis∣putations about Principles of Religion, how ne∣cessary soever, providing men live well, to be but vain Jangling (wherein they exactly Homo∣logate the Quakers (as I well know) but their provision, though it were granted to be enough (which it is not) is impossible, if people be
misled in necessary Principles; seeing no man can live well who mistakes his Rode-way; and follows wrong directions and lies) and therefore as we are very heartily willing to Discharge all Debates a∣bout Opinions which yield no fruit to Edification, and make us no sounder Christians; so their great care is to have all the other Cashiered also.
But when the most necessary Truths are bold∣ly invaded, and our common Faith in danger to be supplanted, it looks not like Christian Courage, or Zeal, but is rather a plain betray∣ing of Truth, for us to hold our peace, and suffer the enemy how contemptible soever they may seem, by their real Triumphs, though but counterfeited Trophees of a pretended Victory, erected meer∣ly upon our Cowardise and Sloth, not the over∣throw of our Cause, or their Strength, to gather Proselytes, and increase their numbers. This is not to be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth. Christ did not so let the Sadduces (a contempti∣ble and foolish people) pass without a demon∣strative Confutation. Paul also fought with Beasts at Ephesus, and his Epistles declare what care he took, at the Spirits direction too, to re∣dargue the Errors of his time.
This Tractate shall not much value the obloquy and Sarcasms of these men, nor of any other whom nothing can please, which is not either the fruit of
their proper Invention, or else, at least, adequately adjusted to their prejudicate apprehensions, and foreconceived Opinions; if it be but (which is its great ambition) acceptable to your Lordship, and Edi∣fying to such as desire to know and love the Truth.
And though, reflecting upon the Brutish absur∣dity of the party against whom I have Embarqu'd in this Province, not only renouncing all true Prin∣ciples of Religion, but also stifling their very fa∣culties of reason, my adopting of this piece so high may almost seem unsutable, yet when I contemplate the great Worth and Excellency of the Subject, Matter, and Theme I am to treat upon, being no less then the whole Divine Ordinances of the Gospel, and the most precious, and many of them most necessary Truths of Jesus, I hope my Nuncu∣pation shall no ways be thought incongruous, if I have but been so happy, as rightly to encounter the Adversaries, and dextrously to vindicate and dis∣play the Standard of the Sacred Truth, which with what force and evidence I have done I submit to your Lordships Ʋmpirage and Judgment, whom that God may bless, and make prosperous here, and eternally happy hereafter, is the earnest Prayer of your Lordships most Obedient Servant,
