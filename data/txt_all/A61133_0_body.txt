Noble Patriots,
IF I mistake not, you may here single out something of the Lords from what is mine, and discern some beams of God amongst many things of man. I know the candle of the Lord cannot shine anywhere with more snuff then in me; however since the Lord hath lighted it, I dare not but let it shine (or rather glimmer) before men. I have writ your Names to my Book that I may be one of your Remembrancers amongst the rest to the ad∣vancement of Truth; not but that they who know ye, know ye to be acted by a Spirit of Truth in your selves. The Lord remember ye according to all the good ye have done (in your several Ministrations) to this people; and do that for ye which gives you most, and yet takes most from ye, even filling ye with himself, till he hath emptyed ye of all but his own glory, and gathered ye up into the fulnesse and righteousnesse of himself in Christ, where we are onely nothing in our selves, and every thing in him; and surely the most, and best, and greatest thing he can do for the sons of men, is, thus to make them nothing in their own ac∣count, that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord. I may seem strange to wish ye thus; but I know it is not strange to ye, who know the Mystery of the Spirit, and of Christ.
My Lord, and Sir, Go on still, yet still laying your designes in a glory above that of States and Kingdoms, and involving all your counsels there, where there is most of Heaven, and lest of the World.
So prays
