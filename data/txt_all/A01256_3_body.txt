EÆ²rops Glory, Englands greatest Good,
O! maist thou flourish like the fruitfull Vine,
And make Great Brittaine rich in Royall blood;
The life of all our hopes liues in thy Line:
Liue euer blessed, and be more a Mother,
And from thee may that of-spring issue forth,
That may secure their Kingdomes, conquer other,
Make all the world to wonder at their worth:
Nay, win it all, and part it too (Heau'ns smile)
As Brutus sonnes did once diuide this Ile.
Maneant afata nepotes.
