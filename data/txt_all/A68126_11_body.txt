MOst Gratious Prince:
IT is not from any conceit of such worth in my labours, that they durst looke so high. A lower patronage would haue serued an higher work. Jt were well if ought of mine could be worthy of popular eyes; Or if I could wring ought from my selfe not vnworthy of a iudicious Reader. J know, your Highnesse wants neyther presents, nor counsells: presents from strangers, counsells from your Teachers; neyther of them matchable by my weaknesse: onely duty herein excuseth me from presumption. For, J thought it iniustice to deuote the fruit of my labours to any other hand beside my Masters: which also J knew to be as gracious, as mine is faithfull. Yet (since euen good affections cannot warrant too much vilenesse in gifts to Prin∣ces) lest, while my modesty disparages my worke, J should hazard the acceptation; here shall your Grace finde variety, not without profit. J hate a Diuine that would but please; and, withall, thinke it impossible for a man to profit, that pleaseth not. And if, while
 my style fixeth it selfe vpon others, any spirituall profit shall reflect vpon your Highnesse, how happy am J! who shall euer thinke, I haue liued to purpose, if (by the best of my studies) J shall haue done any good office to your soule. Further, (which these times account not the least praise) your Grace shal herein perceiue a new fashion of discourse, by Epistles; new to our language, vsuall to others: and (as Nouelty is neuer without plea of vse) more free, more familiar. Thus, wee doe but talke with our friends by our pen, and expresse our selues no whit lesse easily; somewhat more di∣gestedly.
Whatsoeuer it is, as it cannot bee good enough to deserue that countenance; so, the countenance of such Patronage shall make it worthy of respect from others. The God of Princes protect your person, perfect your graces, and giue you as much fauour in Hea∣uen, as you haue honour on earth.
