Honoured Sir,
THe Authour of this ensuing Discourse has been importuned by divers Friends to make it publick long since. If he had done it himself, you might have expected a more formal Epistle. But it seems other Considerations or Persons have been more preva∣lent with him. He has notwithstanding, upon a Friends request, been so courteous as to impart a Copy of it for my own satisfaction. And truly, whatever his reasons may be against it, I am con∣fident they cannot out-weigh the significancy of its Publication. I have therefore adventured upon his Candour, to do that Service to the World, which his Modesty, or I know not what, would not permit him: And also to Dedicate his Endeavours to
Your self, not onely because you are a great friend to the Author (as of whom he often speaks with the most grateful resentments) but also because you are a known Patron of his Subject, of that Truth and Simplicity, that Ingenuity and Sincerity which he contends for.
If I have herein made too bold with you or him, I leave my good intention to plead for me, and beg pardon.
