SIR:
THe sinne of Ingrati∣tude hath euer beene ranked by men of in∣genious and liberall education in, the first place amongst the of-scouring and scum of vices, whose iudgement and opinion here∣in, I professe I alwaies approued. To wipe off then, and cleare my selfe from the asper∣sion of this foule enormitie, I haue, on adui∣sed
deliberation presumed to consecrate and offer vp vnto your memorie this small Treatise concerning my vnfained conuersi∣on vnto Christ, as a pledge and token of my thankefulnesse for many benefits and fa∣uours plentifully conferred on me. For your most eminent and conspicuous vertues, whereof I oft haue had experience, especi∣ally your wisedome, bountifulnesse, courte∣sie, your feruent zeale to the reformed reli∣gion and pietie, which so attend and guard your person, that you can hardly be seuered or abstracted from them, promise and assure me, that this small Treatise giuen and con∣secrated on the Altar of an honest and sin∣cere heart, will be most gratefull and accep∣table to your Honour.
