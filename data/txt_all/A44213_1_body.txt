Dearly Beloved, and longed for, our Joy and Crown;
YOu shall with more praise to God, light and stability to your selves, read the ensuing Treatise, if you first consider, and lament, that (for abuse of Ordinances) Satan, transforming himself into an Angel of Light, hath undermined all Ordinances of divine Light and Life: The Lords-Day not moral, publique solemn As∣semblies turned into House-meetings, publique Ministry exchanged for private Conferences, publique preaching of the Word common to gifted Brethren with called Ministers; no prayer but when the Spirit moves, no communion in the Supper, but in Churches new∣ly gathered, and no Baptism for Infants. No wonder if religious Ordinances be thus undermined, when the Doctrine of the holy Trinity, the Deity of Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost, the divine Authority of the Scriptures, the Obligation of the Deca∣logue, and other Fundamentals of Faith, Holiness and Righteous∣ness, are, by the Ministers of the Prince of Darkness, professedly overturned. No wonder that Children are unchurched, when so many Churches are unchurched, many of them that have done the former having begun at the latter. They who would not be saved by Ordinances, shall perish for want of Ordinances; and they that would not unite themselves to the Fountain of Life by Faith, shall be separated from the streams and conveyances of Life, that they may apparantly wither and dye: only, upon the living in Jerusalem, that by the subtilty of delusion, or power of interest, are darkened and benummed, pray and weep, that the Sun of Righte∣ousness may arise, with healing in his wings. But the Ordinances being the purchase of Christs blood, as well as the Church, the gifts
of his Princely Government, the Ensigns of his Victory over the Kingdom of Darkness, and of his glorious Ascension, he will by his soveraign Power maintain; And to that end successively enoble the spirits of some with beams of heavenly light and courage, that they shall discover the stratagems of Opposers, and adventure upon their Armies marshalled against them, and triumphantly overcome by his glorious power, redeeming the captived Ordinances of their King unto a just and glorious Liberty. This being so high a favor from Christ, the glory of his Grace and Power, it is most thank∣fully to be accepted, and his Instruments to be had in honor, by all that rejoyce in the glory of his Kingdom. His Ministers he hath designed to be the Executors of his last Will and Testament, to them it belongs by divine appointment, to give out the several Le∣gacies there bequeathed, and to put in suit all them, in the high Court of sacred Scripture, who shall, upon any pretence whatso∣ever, detain any Legacy bequeathed; and where will their faithful∣ness more appear, then to open their mouth for the dumb, and to sue for Childrens rights, whil'st they are forcibly wronged, and unable to right themselves? where is greater Trust, and more shining Fidelity? The right of Infants to Baptism hath of late been openly impleaded in reference to Lancashire, and the Bill printed to be published there in special, with expectation of the concur∣rence of the godly; but, blessed be God, one of the Lords Execu∣tors (in Manchester, where part-taking was most desired and ex∣pected) hath wisely and faithfully joyned issue, and by clear Evi∣dence hath procured a determinate sentence for the setling of their undoubted right upon Infants, to our great comfort, and the honor of the Kingdom of Christ, in the Right whereof Infants are right∣ly baptized. And our hope in the Lord Jesus is, that the question∣ing of the Right of Infants, and the shaking of their title, will have that influence upon all the godly in Lancashire, especially Pa∣rents (peculiarly in Manchester, and the rest of the associated Churches) that out of enflamed love to Christ, and the Souls of their Children, they will so much the more settle their Judgments in this Truth, by the conscionable and diligent use of this hlp, pro∣vided by the Lord amongst them, so seasonably in respect of danger, and so suitably, in respect of clearness, brevity, and charge; that will happily lead to the believing, repenting, and prayerful use of this Ordinance, which is the Covenant-way of conveying to their
Children the sure and saving Mercies of the Covenant: so shall they, and others, who have seen the holy Seal set on in Infancy, clear∣ly behold, in their holy life, the lively characters of the Spirit of the Covenant, the Image of the Lord Jesus in their riper years; To their own abundant satisfaction, the silencing of Adversaries, the increase of the Church mystical, the encouragement of them that have carefully and painfully pleaded their Right; and above all, the honor of the Lord Jesus, who in their Infancy opened unto them his Arms and Bosom in his Church, that in an hidden way he might warm them with a spiritual Life, to be manifested in due time. In this hope we pray for you, and labor amongst you, that we might present Parents and Children in Covenant-obedience and blessing, at that great Day. This is the principal Desire and Soul-travel of
