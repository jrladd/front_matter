SIR,
WHEN Men take the liberty to appear in Publick, with Opinions out of fa∣shion, it's but a Reasonable Policy to court the Countenance and Protection of some Approv'd Judgment: For which reason the World might well conclude, to you, Sir, this Address is made, did I not profess to know your Principle is, to defend Truth, whoever said it; and to protect Error for no Man's sake; Besides, I do not de∣sire what is erroneous should meet with Protecti∣on, but will always be as ready publickly to dis∣own what shall be made appear so, as to defend what is right. But the Subject of these Papers having often been the Subject of our Private Debates, I thought it but reasonable to present you with what Improvements I have made by your Ingenious Conversation. You know, Sir, Opinions may alter, but the Nature of Things are still the same: And therefore, if we would be
right, we must not bottom upon Opinion, but make a strict search into the Nature of Things, and take assistance from Holy Writ in making that search. The reason why Error spreads, and is establish'd among us, is, because the general part of Mankind take things up upon Trust; whereas if they would be at the pains, with the assistance of the Holy Scriptures, to inform them∣selves, many currant Assertions would but appear the more comical for their blustering and magi∣sterial air. It is something pleasant to observe, that the great Step which makes an approv'd Philosopher, is to talk unintelligibly, and to solve us One Difficulty by making Twenty more: These are the mighty men in vogue, whilst the poor man that gives a Plain Reason for what he says, is put by for a Coxcomb, he wants Pro∣fundity. However, I have adventur'd to write so as to be understood, and that will not un∣dervalue me in your Judgment, which I have al∣ways reverenc'd; and therefore shall always be,
SIR,
