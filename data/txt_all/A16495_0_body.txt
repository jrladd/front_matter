THough you haue gra∣ced the Labours of some (as much admi∣red for your courtesie as they for their in∣discretion) who might haue beene condem∣ned for presuming to importune you for their Patron; yet it would seeme a prophanation of greatnesse to place your name vpon the Fron∣tispice of euery vulgar Paper, but as no Worke hath more need of your countenance, then the En∣couraging of Colonies; So it would appeare to me (I know not suspecting my owne partiali∣tie, whither seduced by Desire, or warranted by Reason) that there is no ground whereupon your
countenance may shine with a more publike ap∣plause. This is the way (making the Gospell of Iesus Christ knowne in vnknowne parts) by sup∣plying the necessities of many, with a lawfull in∣crease of necessary commerce, to procure glorie vnto God, honour to your selfe, and benefit to the World; By this meanes, you that are borne to rule Nations, may bee the beginner of Nations, enlarging this Monarchie without bloud, and ma∣king a Conquest without wronging of others, whereof in regard of your youth any good begin∣ning in this (like your vertue vpon which it doth defend) boding a speedie Progresse Time in your own time, doth promise a great perfection.

Kingdome, where so many of your▪ Ancestors were buried, and where your selues were borne. I haue both by reading what doth rest vpon Re∣cord, and by conferring with sundry that haue beene imbarked in such a businesse, beene curious to remarke the managing thereof, that the ex∣perience of times past might with the lesse dan∣ger at the charges of others, improoue them that are to practize at this present. And the fruits of my Labours I doe humbly offer heere vnto your Highnesse, hoping by the commendable endeuours, therein remembred (though it selfe be but a tri∣uiall Treatise, not worthy your sight) to conci∣liate your good opinion towards them that are to aduenture in this kind. Amongst whom (if euer my fortunes haue any conformitie with my mind) I purpose to contribute as much as my weake abi∣lities can bee able to affoord for accomplishing this braue Designe, wherein my greatest Ambi∣tion shall be that both this Age and the Posteri∣tie may know how much I desire by some obserua∣ble effect to be remembred for being
