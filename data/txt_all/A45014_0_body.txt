Humbly sheweth,
THat they give you thanks from the depth of their hearts, for the great and many benefits they have already reaped from your no lesse chargeable, then In∣defatigable paines, and in particular for your necessary Ordinance of the Militia, on which, as we conceive (under God) our safety doth depend, un∣to which we most cheerefully, sudmit, as is manifest by this dayes appearance, not onely of the Trained Bands, but of well neere a thousand Voluntiers, that make all demonstration of Obedience, as well to this, as all other Commands that shall come from your Honourable Houses, in opposition to the Popish

malignant Party at home, or any other power from abroad, notwithstanding the many visible discourage∣ments from ill affected persons that make it their bu∣sinesse to blemish the validity of your Authority, as also by the Lord Lieutenant's absence contrary to the trust reposed in him.
Therefore we humbly implore the continuance of your care for our Safeties, and to appoint such a Lord Lieutenant, in whom we may confide, as surely you may in us, who are resolved to lay our lives and fortunes at your feet, in defence of the King and Parliament.
And we shall pray &c.
