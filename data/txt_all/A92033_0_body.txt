Gentlemen,
IT is true, I may looke for (when I seriously consider my own insufficiency and lack of good utterance and a pleasing oratorious phrase) many censures, and be perplexed with doubts, whether I have or no chosen the better part; since most, or the generality of men are carried away sooner with a pleasing and deluding tongue, then truth, delivered in an homely or mean stile: especially since this most noble study that I un∣dertake

here to defend is so vulgarly traduced, and commonly both ill spo∣ken of: which indeed at the first, was some disheartning to my underta∣kings; yet because my Antagonists Coat is such, as that a word against Astrologie sheltred under it, will by the vulgar be more heeded, then an Oration from another; and this noble Art in danger hereby to suffer (most falsely) an ill esteeme in their opinions; for the well wishes I owe both to it, the truth, and all ye the students therein, and lovers of lear∣ning whatsoever. I thought good rather to incur the harsh censure of some, then by my silence to give oc∣casion to the ignorant, and enemies thereof to vaunt themselves against it: and truely notwithstanding all this, I had not thus taken him up;

since neither he nor any one else can say ought against this science but what hath been formerly most fully answered:Looke Pirova∣nu, Goclenius, Bellantius, Ma∣raseallettes and Sir Christoph. Heydon. but for the Readers satisfa∣ction, who perhaps would have concluded (had no body undertaken to answer him) he had been past answering. I very much fear there are many most grosse faults and mistakes in this Treatise, it being pen'd at that instant of time, I was more perplexed and troubled then in all my life before; my occasi∣ons being such, that I had no time to study a better method, or correct what hath escaped; it being the fruits of what my weake Genius did pro∣duce in every house and place I came in (in pursuance of my then occasi∣ons) where I could happily meet

with the least occasion. Yet my hope is, that in what I have been defective (as I doubt not but your piercing judgements will soon discover) you will both support, supply and amend, hoping also ye will accept of the will for the deed: to whom I here Dedi∣cate both my self and weak labours to serve you to my weak power.
 Die ☿ 4. Decembris, 1650.
