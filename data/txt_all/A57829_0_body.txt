Dear Brothers,
THis Dedication becomes both you and me, being design'd for a publique en∣gagement of such mutual affection, as be∣comes three only Reliques of a most ancient Family, never yet stain'd with any spot of Dishonour or Disloyalty. The one of you God has made Steward of the Estate of the Family; which though greatly dimi∣nisht by the death of our Great unkle, John Ramsay late Earl of Holder∣ness, &c. without Issue, and too soon after by the death of his Brother and Heir

Sir George Ramsay our Grandfather, who left my Father too young to manage Affairs; and by the last Kings Warrs, in which my Father rais'd a Troop of Horse at his own sole Charge, and suffer'd much; and by the death of our Eldest Brother before the Kings Return, and of our Dear Father quickly after; yet the God of our Family is the same still, and can raise it again in due time: Only be we thankfull for his present great favours; and serve we him in the advantageous stations where∣in he hath placed us. The other of you, God has renown'd with Military Skill and Action at home and abroad, as he did many of our Family before, and lately two great unkles, Collonel Ramsay and Major General Ramsay under Gustavus Adolphus. I am placed between you, as in Age, so in Station; a Steward and a Souldier too, but in Spiritual matters; wherefore let me now be as a mediant term

of union to joyn ye in one. I think I am the first of our Family of this Function, at least in England. Wherefore, as the Function it self is Honourable and Di∣vine, give me leave, to the Honour of my Choice, to essay something in Vindica∣tion of the Truth; I may say, in Vindi∣cation of our Church and State. For the Truth, which I here assert, hath receiv'd such solemn Attestations from King and Parliament, from all manner of Testimony, that to deny or oppose it, were to give the Lye to Church and State, and to affront the Throne as well as the Pulpit. I par∣ticularly stand engaged to bear this Testi∣mony, being more intimately acquainted with the Principles and Practices of the Church of Rome, by occasion of my Fo∣rain Travel for twelve years among them. Now this Plot is justified by those Prin∣ciples, and highly prais'd, defended and rewarded by that Church: Therefore those

Principles are manifestly condemn'd by this Plot, and that Church to be detested for it, to be denyed, and utterly forsaken by all that love the Truth and the Gospel of the Peace of Jesus, to whom you are daily commended by the most earnest and hearty Prayers of
