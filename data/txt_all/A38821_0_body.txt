GREAT SIR,
IT is for the amplyfying of your Name and Dignity, for the Patronizing and
Securing of true Religion at home and abroad, and in special gratitude to my
Masters in the Faith, that I introduce these undone French Supplicants to
Petition and Appeal to your Majesty and your Grand Council for your Medi∣ation
or some other Redress, which they with all possible submission and reite∣rated
Applications, nay with tears of Blood, and with broken Hearts and Backs, have
long sought in vain of that incroaching Monarch that rules and tramples over them:
as may appear by these following Sheets.
That which makes them conceive the greater Trust and Confidence, is certain Ti∣tles
of your Majesties, and that particularly of Defender of the Faith, which they
hope you will think to fulfil, according as occasion at home will suffer your Pru∣dence
to turn your eyes to their Exigencies and the present Opportunities abroad.
The Solemn Embassies that your Majesties Protestant Predecessors sent thither, for
to expostulate with the French Kings concerning the illegal oppressions of the Hugue∣nots,Mem. of Rohan. and others.
contrary to the Edict of Nantes, (whereof the Kings of England
were held the Guaranties,) were allowed and are found Recorded in
their own Memoires and Registers of State, without the least animadversion or dis∣claim,
it being a Privilege that the Kings of this Realm had used as their right to
practise and insist upon; and which we in our days ought by no means to lose by
Prescription. Now if that King should go about to huff at any Forraign Princes
concerning himself in this Nature, with the State of his Subjects; besides the pre∣mised
reasons, his mouth may be stopped with this argumentum ad hominem. That
he himself took the same liberty in writing to the Duke of Savoy in favour of his op∣pressed
Protestant Subjects of the Valleys of Piedmont, at that time when not only
England, but Sweadland, Denmark, and most of the Protestant Princes of Europe
had done the same.
But this Patronizing Spirit for the Protestant Interest, which was so conspicu∣ously
famous even in a Woman, a Princess of this Nation, was not suffered to de∣cay
in the hearts of the English People it self during that unhappy absence of your
Majesty from your Kingdom, for amidst their Civil Distractions, they forgot not
the right our Nation had to Mediate and succour their French Brethren of the Re∣formed
Religion; For, besides Letters and Messages they sent for their present
solid Relief twenty thousand two hundred thirty three pounds by Sir Samuel Mor∣land,
as part of a General Collection made for them throughout England, where∣of
remained in ready Cash, sixteen thousand three hundred thirty three pound ten
shillings to be improved for them; and we know in whose hands this Sum was deposi∣ted
at your Majesties happy Restoration, but since it is so scattered, that few knows
what is become of it, which is a thing that we humbly beg your Majesty and Par∣liament
to give order to inquire into, who they were that laid Sacrilegious hands on
such an holy offering of the Nations to the indigent members of Christ in Foraign
Churches. The French Church in London have a Procuration to receive it
for the Piedmontoes.
In Fine, both divine and Humane Reasons do clearly demonstrate, That what∣ever

temporizing Pseudo-Polititians may insinuate, nothing would (as it is presu∣med)
so much strengthen your Majesty at home and abroad, as to give all possible
proofs to your Neighbours, that you roundly and vigorously intend to shew your self
The Head of the Protestant Religion, and that you will appear to be Defender
of the Faith indeed. And certainly the opposite Interest (God be thanked) does
so visibly decay, according to his unsurmountable Decree; That the Protestants are
and shall be found to be the best friends and strongest supporters your Majesty may
have, did worldly Prudence it self lead one to make a Choice.
Now the matter of this Book will afford sufficient matter for your Royal Com∣passion
and Protection, and though you see here but a rough draught of their Mise∣ries,
and a few of the very many Decrees (which I have by me) that were made a∣gainst
them, yet here is as much as may satisfy your Majesty and the World, that
they suffer not as evil Doers; as 'tis plain by the Edict of Nantes here inserted,
and their Plea out of it, and other French Laws.
France was sadly distracted and disjoynted within it self for many ages upon this
account of Religion, when the Popes Emissaries would never suffer the poor Hugue∣nots
to live as peaceable Subjects among them, striving (though in vain) utterly to
extirpate and root them out. But all their Devices turned to their own shame, and all
their other attempts for the stling the Peace of that Nation in any other way, still
proved unsuccessful till this healing Edict called of Nantes was Enacted by Henry
the Fourth at that City, whereby the free exercise of Religion in determined fixed
Places throughout the Nation with sundry other Priviledges, were allowed to those
of the Reformed Religion. This wrought such a general Unity and Harmony and
such a blessing from God upon that Kingdom, that both Popish Bishops and Presby∣terian
Professors lived quietly together for about a whole Century, till now of late,
those proud Prelates not induring any Fellows in the Ministry, and not content with
the whole Fleece, will have all the room to dilate their Phylacteries, and so upon se∣veral
superstitious pretences and jealousies they drew that King to grant those Decrees
against Protestants, as oft as he would require Money of their Convocated Clergy.
Thus they first of all break the Bonds of Charity and Christian Unity, and after∣wards
that of the Civil Concord of the Nation, by incroaching upon the Civil Ma∣gistrates
Power of making and executing of Penal Laws, in their Courts against
their Fellow Christians; wherein they are Antichrists Successors, not Christs, nor
his Apostles: For his Kingdom was not of this World.
But may it not then be hoped and humbly offered that the ordaining of such ano∣ther
Edict of Nantes here in England, would in allowing some limited Privileges to
the Non-conformists conforming in Fundamentals, (whose Principles are not destru∣ctive
to Monarchy nor Morality) work the same good effects here as it did in that
Country, and prevent those further growing Divisions and Distractions in Church
and State. In sine, both we and the French Protestants ought in all humble thankful∣ness
to acknowledge the late bountiful relief of your Majesties, for the conveying
some of the most indigent Banished French Protestants into Carolina, and giving
them an Azile there; but be pleased to consider, that if some course be not taken to
protect them, rather where they are, that it seems no greater pleasure can be done
to the French King nor his Bishops; for by a too considerable transportation of
them, the Protestant Interest in Christendom will grow weaker, and the French
and Popish will become by so much the stronger, the Ballance of Europe shall not be
maintained, which may be your Majesties true Interest and Privilege to preserve;
and besides, Religion will be made to flee to America, while State-Policy calmly looks
on, and inthrones itself in its place: therefore the Premisses, and the finding out any
other more fit Expedient, is humbly laid at your Majesties feet, and your Grand
Councils Censure and better Deliberation and Resolve,
