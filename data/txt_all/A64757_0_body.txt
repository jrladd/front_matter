Honoured Sirs,
THIS Tract how little soever, yet contains within its Circuit the Interest and Con∣cerns of many worthy and Honourable Per∣sons, to whom the late Author was in hopes it would be no less acceptable
then beneficial; especially if admit∣ted into your protections, who for the greatest Reason understand the management of all Affairs therein discoursed. You cannot but know the many alterations that happeneth in those Counties upon the uniting thereof unto the Crown of England; for the better understanding of the then settlements there, upon which the proceedings of these Courts are grounded, there is now added the effects of all the Statutes yet remain∣ing in force. So that in this short view, you see the basis and super∣structure of the Law, as it stands setled by Statutes, and the usual and ordinary proceedings thereupon, with the just Fees, all reduced to our modern Scale, which in the dead Author's behalf I offer to your Ho∣nours, desiring to approve my self in all things,
