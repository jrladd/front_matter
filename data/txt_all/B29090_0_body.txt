Madam,
HIS worke of Grace, by many passag∣es of provi∣dence seemed to bee kept
for a yeare of Grace. And indeed, as any free Mercy given out to a Nation, both sin∣full and miserable, may well beare the Name of Grace, so more par∣ticularly that may fitly bee called a Time of Grace, when Grace may freely speake for it selfe, and have leave to be heard.
This Leave by the Grace and Goodnesse of the All-ruling Provi∣dence
is now obtained for this worke. A worke which began after a conference with my ever-honoured Bro∣ther, Master PYM, wherein it was dis∣coursed; That the ve∣ry maine Plot, and Summe of the Scrip∣tures, was to shew, that the Will of the rationall Creature, was onely safe in the keeping of the Creator; and there∣fore to the Creator a∣lone
did belong the Glo∣ry of 
Ʋpon this great ob∣ject▪ this  (as a narrow Map of a Large World) being , it  came to your Ladyships hands, from whom I re∣ceived it againe, with a promise to returne it in this shape▪ wherein it now appeares. Accor∣ding to this promise, (though not without
sundry intervenient difficulties) it is now pre∣sented; and being made publicke, if any publick benefit arise from it, it owes some acknowledg∣ment to your Ladiships Religious calling for it, and furtherance of it; to whom by the best ob∣ligements of Pietyand many other merits I pro∣fesse my selfe.
