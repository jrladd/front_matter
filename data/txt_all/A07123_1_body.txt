IF any aske, how I, so young, so raw,
Durst fasten on this head-strong Time a Iaw,
How I, (that scarce can speak) should dare to write:
And that a Satyre too, (in times dispite)
I answere; Loue to Vertue (quite defac'd)
And hate to Vice, (that in her roome is plac'd).
Then call me Child, or Foole, or both, I care not,
They both doe tell the truth, when wiser dare not
