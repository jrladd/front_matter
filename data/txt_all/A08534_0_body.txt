YOur high Place, your princely Honours and Ver∣tues, the hereditary vigilance and wisedome, wher∣with Hercules-like, you assist the protection of the whole State: Though these (most honoured Lord) are powerfull encitements to draw all sorts to the desire of your most Noble protection. Yet besides all these (in more particular by your Lordships speciall Fauors and Gra∣ces) am I emboldened to present this Father of Musicke Ornithopar∣chus to your worthyest Patronage, whose approoued Workes in my tra∣uailes (for the common good of our Musitians) I haue reduced into our English Language. Beseeching your Lordship (as a chiefe Author of all our good) graciously to receiue this poore presentment, whereby your Lordship shall encourage me to a future taske, more new in subiect, and as memorable in worth. Euery Plant brings forth his like, and of Mu∣sitians, Musicke is the fruit. Moreouer such is your diuine Disposi∣tion that both you excellently vnderstand, and royally entertaine the Exercise of Musicke, which mind-tempering Art, the graue Luther was not affraid to place in the next seat to Diuinity. My daily prayers (which are a poore mans best wealth) shall humbly sollicite the Author of all Harmonie for a continuall encrease of your Honors present happi∣nesse with long life, and a successiue blessing to your generous posteritie.
Your Lordships humbly deuoted
Iohn Douland.
