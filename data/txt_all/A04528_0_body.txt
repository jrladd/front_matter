SIr,The Authors Epistle. more then twenty yeeres are past since lighting on the substance or matter of this present booke, han∣dled in Latin, in forme of an Oration, by the in∣ducement of certain good Personages, I was per∣swaded to reduce it into the forme of an Action or Suite at Lawe, and to cause it to bee Printed in the Flemish tongue, with hope that this small Treatise might conduce some-what towards the edifying of Christians: And vnderstanding that diverse impressions haue beene sold in the Low-Countries: Hereupon I at the last resolved to make it change language, for the vse of our Churches, and especially, of the Churches in the Kingdome of France, where

are to be found these two formall complaining parties, brought in as contending or pretending title in this cause of Religion: that is to say, they which make profession of the Romane Religion, as accusers or Plaintiffes on the one part, and they which make profession of the Reformed Religion as the ac∣cused or Defendants on the other part. I assure my selfe that both the one and the other will herein finde occasion, more seriously to consider of this so impor∣tant businesse and debate; yea and whosoever will not be wilfully blinde, may easily here discerne, how this suite or cause of Religion hath beene for many yeeres past wranglingly and cunningly pleaded, by them that seeke for nothing else but to charge and burden their adverse partie with vniust and false accusations, and reproches; and to hinder the comming at length to a finall decision or determination.
God grant that even the most simple and ignorant may reade it heedfully, and without preiudice or pre∣iudging, to the end they may seriously resolue to ioyne with the better party, for the advancement of Gods glory, & of their saluation in our Sauior Iesus Christ.
For the rest (Sir) I haue presumed to dedicate vn∣to you the French edition, of this religious suite or action concerning Religion: hoping you will accept, receiue, and take it in as good part, as I offer this my poore labour with a sincere affection, especially be∣cause I vnderstand, that you are much addicted to the reading of bookes, which tend to the maintaining and defending of the doctrine of Iesus Christ. Be pleased then (I beseech you) that I may here make vnto you some small publique acknowledgement and I hum∣bly

desire our good God, to fit you with his especi∣all blessings, most conducing and tending to his glory and your eternall salvation.
At Harlem about the end of Ianuary, in the yeere of our Lord, 1614.
