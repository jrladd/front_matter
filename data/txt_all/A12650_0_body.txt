MOst lines do not the best conceit containe,
Few wordes well coucht may comprehend much matter:
Then, as to vse the first is counted vaine,
So is't praise-worthy to conceit the latter,
The grauest wittes that most graue workes expect,
The qualitie, not quantitie respect.


The smallest sparke will cast a burning heat:
Base cottages may harbour things of woorth,
Then though this Volume be, nor gay, nor great,
Vnder your protection I set foorth,
Do not with coy disdainefull ouersight
Deny to reade this well meant orphanes mite.


And since his father in his infancie
Prouided patrons to protect his heire,
But now by death none sparing crueltie
Is turnd an orphane to the open aire:
I his vnworthy foster-sire haue darde,
To make you patronizers of this warde.



You gloreng issues of that glorious dame,
Whose lie is made the subiect o deaths will,
To you succeeding hopes of mothers fame,
I dedicate this ruit of Southwels quill:
He for your Vncles comort first it writ,
I for your consolation print and send you it.


Then daine in kindnesse to accept the worke,
Which he in kindnesse writ, I send to you,
The which till nw clouded, obscure did lurke:
But now opposed to ech Readers view,
May yeelde commodious fruit to euery wight
That feeles his consience prikt by Parcaes spight.


But if in aught I haue presumptuous beene,
My pardon-crauing pen implores your fauour:
If any fault in print be past; vnseene
To let it passe, the Printer is the rauer,
So shall he thanke you, and I by duety bound,
Pray, that in you may all good gifts abound.
