I Have thought good, as a Servant, to the Labours and Memory, of that Noble Lord, the Lord Viscount St. Alban, to Collect into one, these few, rather Parcells, than Just Works, of his excellent Pen. Which I have done for these Causes. First, to vindi∣cate the Wrong his Lordship suffered, by a cor∣rupt and surreptitious Edition, of that Discourse of his, Touching a War with Spain, lately set forth. Secondly, by way of Prevention, to exempt from the like Injury and Defacements, those other Discourses of his, herein contained. Lastly, to satisfie the Desires of some, who hold it unreasonable, that any the Delineations of that Pen, though in never so small a Model, should not be shewn to the World. I know, it carries the Excuse with it, after the Authors Death, to publish Fragments. Therefore I will make none. These Works, being all, for the Argu∣ment, Civil, I cannot represent better, than in

Resemblance of Aristotles Parva Naturalia, to account them as his Lordships Parva Politica. Howsoever, I doubt not, but every Judicious Reader, finding of his Lordships Spirit in them, will know them to be his; And will afford them, a Place of Reputation, amongst his Greater Works.
