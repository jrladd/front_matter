THis imperfect brat and Embryo of my brain was dedicated thine in its first con∣ception; it hath not been the la∣bour of many dayes, or the product of serious hours, but the repose of my minutiall vacancies; therefore as its travail hath been but short, and its birth basty, so it cannot evade the greatest monstrosity without the largest candor, which
 as it cannot hope for from the world, whose eyes behold with pre∣judice, so this is not intended for it, but thee, who knows to enter∣tain a Truth though it cannot plead prescription, and embrace a veritie without a Panceroll. Su∣perstitious credulity will condemn me as a heretick, and by the world (whose native dialect is reproach) I stand excommunicated; I walk secure while Truth is my passport, and as long as I enjoy her for my gantlet, my station is above the reach of envy. If I have failed in my relation, I hope that Ingenuitie will extenuate the lapses of my minoritie, and I promise my more mature judgement shall correct what my flexible infancy hath un∣warily
 imbibed. I cannot contest with Calumnies, nor know I for the stile of heretick, to return my ad∣versaries the name of Antichrist: that devotion I owe to knowledg, engageth me upon conviction to repeal by Writ of Errour what they accuse as heresie: till then my zeal must crave its libertie (the end being knowledge) cannot be suppressed; it hath many heads, which if it lose its current in one place, it will break forth into some other; thus Truth can triumph in its martyrdom, and being naked can best defend it self.
Since the depravitie of the protoplast distraction hath been imposed upon the weal of know∣ledg, and the obstinacy of posterity
 hath encreased it to a paroxysme of madness beyond the power of Hel∣lebore, unless the discretion and policie of future ages coerce cre∣dulitie, and commit to flames what our stubborn parents have obtru∣ded upon the tender infancie of their successours:
Lame knowledge that expects no Cure
Till books confess a Calenture. Every mans soul is his living li∣brary, whose activity must needs flagg in the channels of an other body, and whose wings are clipt whilst its nature is confined to a Ne plus ultra, and thus to ex∣pire in the arms of our fathers, is a slavery equalizing the torment of Mezentius.
Dear Friend, that ingenuity I
 alwaies found in thee whilst we were Chamber fellowes, doth pro∣mise to me thy connivance at those errours that shall occur, and a mi∣noration of grosser crimes to ve∣nial peccadilloes, and likewise an entertainment of the cradle-ser∣vice of this disguised brat, whose little desert, though it cannot ex∣pect thy perusall, yet its diligence to kiss thy hands, may merit thy acceptance, whereby he shall be en∣couraged to higher designes, whose highest ambition is to be.


An Antidote Rideo. Fortiter contemno.
