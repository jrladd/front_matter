Reverend Fathers, & Brethren,
IT is a sacred and certain Truth, wit∣nessed by the Spirit of God in holy Scripture, and manifested in the various turnings of the wheels of Gods Provi∣dence in all ages, that the Lord Jehovah, the Omni∣potent, all-sufficient and only wise God doth and will order all things for his own eternal Glory, and the
everlasting happiness of his Church and Children, be∣loved in the Lord Jesus. But yet the dispensations of God, and the foot-steps of his infinite wisdom are somtimes so obscure and dark, that our blind and weak eyes are not able to see the cloud of his Gra∣cious protection walking with us by day, nor his pillar of fire to give us light in the night. So that a troubled and trembling soul is somtimes amazed and constrained to cry out with that great Apostle, Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his waies past finding out! And somtimes with the Prophet to reason the case with God, in a time of trouble, fear, and danger; O Lord how long shall I cry and thou wilt not hear, even cry out of violence and thou wilt not save? Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance, for spoyling and violence are before me, and there are that raise up strife and contention. It is apparent that since the fallen Angels left their first habitation; and by the subtilty of the Serpent, tempted and over∣came our first Parents, to break that first Covenant, and to sin against God, and lose that happy estate wherein they were created, and since God was pleas∣ed to publish the second Covenant in that Gospel-pro∣mise, the seed of the woman shall break the Serpents head, that old Serpent the Devil & Satan, and the seed of that Serpent, the wicked of the world,
discovered at full that enmity that is in them, against the seed of the woman, the servants of the most high God, the sons and daughters of the King of Glory, in Christ the Redeemer: The Lord hath prosecuted his design according to his eternal councel, for the sal∣vation of his people, and to this end, as he himself preached the Gospel at first, and revealed his mind and will to our first Parents in Paradise, so he con∣stituted Christ his only begotten Son, to be the A∣nointed, the eternal High Priest and Prophet and King of his Church: And this Prophetical Office, as Christ did exercise and execute himself, som∣times before, and somtimes since his coming in the flesh; so did he call and ordain his holy Prophets and Apostles, part before, and part after his resur∣rection, yea, after he ascended up on high, and led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men, he gave some to be Apostles, and some Pro∣phets, and some Pastors and teachers, for the work of the Ministry, for the edification of the body of Christ, untill we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, and unto the mea∣sure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ; and hath promised to be with them to the end of the world. And for their comfortable maintenance and encouragement, although the great God his Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, after he had created the world, and gave to Adam and his posterity the
Lordship and dominion over the creatures, (to hold upon his and their good behaviour) of the Lord himself their Creator, as chief Lord of all; yet the Lord did never give all to Adam or to his posterity, but hath reserved a special part to himself (as he did the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the gar∣den of Paradise) this special part to be for his wor∣ship and service, and the maintenance of his Mini∣sters and Ambassadors to the end of the world, as is fully proved (to my understanding) in this follow∣ing Treatise. But as God hath prosecuted his de∣sign to further the salvation of his people, and main∣tenance of the Gospel, and Gospel-Ministry, so hath the Devil and his Angels and servants had their design to hinder the Lords great work by all subtill frauds, and open hostility to their power, the wicked to this end have laboured to get and keep in their hands Gods reserved part: They robbed God of old, be∣fore the coming of Christ, and they have robbed God since, and their plots and designs still are to rob the Lord Christ and his faithful Godly Mini∣sters and Ambassadors to the utmost of their abili∣ties, both in these Nations and other Parts, where the Gospel of Christ is, or hath been preached. It was the policy and practise of Julian that Apostate Emperour, that he might more easily destroy the Gospel and Gospel-Ministry, to destroy and take away their Maintenance. And this certainly is, and hath been the design of those who are enemies
of us the Godly and Faithful Ministers of the Go∣spel of Jesus Christ, and under the name of Anti∣christian Ministers, seek to destroy us, and our Maintenance, and perswade many godly people a∣gainst us, and labour to stir up the godly Magi∣strate, yea, the Parliaments and powers of the Nation, to take away our Tithes, and to allow us no setled Maintenance, but that we should live of the Charity and almes of the people, that we might be starved as anti-Christian Ministers (as some of them have expressed themselves to me) although it is evident, none are more zealous and laborious to bring down the Kingdom of Antichrist, and to set King Jesus upon his Throne, than we are; not by blood, as some dream we would have it, but by the powerful preaching of the Gospel of peace, and our winning of souls to God; not by blood (I say) for this is, and hath been the nature and design and practise of Antichrist, that whore of Babylon to be drunk with the blood of the Saints & Martyrs of Je∣sus Christ fulfilling the Prophecy of our Saviour, that the time should come that whosoever (of the blind wicked world) should kill his Ministers and Disci∣ples, should think they did God good service, & these things shall they do unto you (saith Christ) be∣cause they have not known the Father, nor yet me. This is that which divers seduced souls have lately discovered to be their desire and design; not only that the faithful witnesses may prophesie in sck∣cloath,
by taking away their Maintenance, but be slain, lie dead, and unburied in the streets, to the rejoycing of the wicked damnable world. But the Lord hath wonderfully preserved us to this day, blessed be his Name. The many Pamphlets lately written and printed against Tithes, or any setled Maintenance to the Ministers of Christ, and the Petitions delive∣red to many Parliaments, by that Generation of men (poor deceived souls) confirm this to the full. But the Lord hath yet put it into the heart of the Parliament not to destroy, but to defend the Faithful and Godly Ministers of the Gospel, and their just Maintenance, established both by the Laws of God and the Land, for which let us praise God, and pray to the Lord still, to be so present with them as to guide and rule their hearts, that our wise Se∣natours may rather establish and increase the main∣tenance of the Godly and Faithful Ministers of Christ in the Nation, than take away or diminish any part of it, for this will be not only for the honour of the Parliament, but for the Glory of God and good of the Nation, whatsoever seduced Spirits would perswade to the contrary; for whom let us pray as Christ did for his Persecutors, Father for∣give them, they know not what they do. And my beloved Brethren, let us who are the Lords re∣membrancers, give God no rest, nor day, nor night, till he establish his Gospel and Faithful Ministers and their just maintenance, and by enabling us by the
assistance of his blessed Spirit to perform constantly our duties in our several places, that his and our Jerusalem may be made a praise in the earth. But if our adversaries, & the adversaries of the Gospel should prevail against us, & all should be taken away (though they cannot take Christ away nor Heaven away,) Let us labour to live by Faith, and depend upon God, who hath provided for many of us, when we had lost all, preserved our lives, when we were in eminent dangers, and will preserve us to his Hea∣venly Kingdom. In the mean time, Honoured and Reverend Brethren, let us labour by wisdom and power from Christ, to fulfil our Ministry which we have received from the Lord, to preach the Word in season and out of season, to Catechise and instruct our people in the first Principles of the Oracles of God, and this both publickly and from house to house, often to confer with them, and to build them up, and confirm them in the knowledge of Christ, that if it please God they may know the Lord, as the truth is in Jesus, that they may walke as becometh the Gospel of Christ, and manifest the truth of their Faith, by fruitfulnesse in all good works; that they and we may by our holy and righteous lives, put to si∣lence the malevolent spirits of all our adversaries, and bring forth abundantly like trees of righte∣ousnesse the planting of the Lord, that God may be glorified. And for our selves (especially) let us by the Grace of God, endeavour the unity of the
spirit in the bond of peace; and although our light be not equal in all respects, yet let it be far from us by our divisions, to rent in pieces the seamlesse coat of our Lord and Saviour, but rather in love enlighten, and by our frequent communion streng∣then one another, that though they speak evil of us, as the wicked and deceived souls have done of the Prophets and Apostles, yea of Christ himself, yet seeing our holy lives, & faithful performance and discharge of our duties in our Ministerial Office, they may be convinced, and glorifie God in the day of visitation, knowing that if we fight the good fight of Faith, and keep the Faith, and be faithful to the death, there is laid up for us the Crown of righteousnesse which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give us at that day, and not to us only, but to all them that love the Lord Jesus, and wait for his appearing. Which that we may persevere to do, and enjoy, is the most humble, hearty and daily prayer of
London, June 18, 1659.
