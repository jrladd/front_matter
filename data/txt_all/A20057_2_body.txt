GOD is the best Schoole-master, his laws the no∣blest studie: and what lessons (of Him) are taught, (truely) how plaine soeuer the Method be, the wisest need not be ashamed to read them. So that I pre∣sume, you will fauour these yong blossomes, because your selfe are but in grow∣ing. They are dewed with the drops of a Pellicā whose property is to suffer her own bosome to bleed, that others may be fed. It is the

bird of Charity, & the true Embleme of Christ on the Crosse, (who was al Loue.) His sids are here pierced, & his blood here runs forth, making a riuer, in which only (& by no other foun∣tain) the leprosie of sin is for euer to be clensed. You shal find only 7. heads of sinne (here) cut off by prayer: not because it hath no more heads but 7. or that these ar the greatest: but being not able to fight (in so narrow a roome) with the multitude of thē al, I was contented to set vpō a certain nūber. The Armour to encounter with them is here prepared: it is made fit for any Christian to weare. If you vouchsafe to put it on, others by your

example wil vndertake the same quarrell. To fight for Christ is an honorable com¦bat. Sins are his vtter ene∣mies, & here you may learn how to cōfound them. The war is godly: the victorie glorious: your triumph will be in heauen. To wrastle a∣gainst such foes shall well become your yeres, and to giue thē the ouerthrow wil be a crowne to you in olde age. To the honor of which I do as heartily wish you may come, as you are hap∣pily ingrafted into religi∣ous & vnblemished Fami∣lies, which (to your cōfort) you may reckon the first of those good blessings which God hath multiplied vpon you,
