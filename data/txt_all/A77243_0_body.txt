My Noble Lord,
A Late Author in his severall Treatises wherein he endea∣vours to defend (I will not say the Arminian Tenets,
Mr Pierce. because he is unwilling to have them so stiled, but, which is all one) Free∣will and Conditionall election, whether because he was touched with compuncti∣on for his former errors, as he thinks them; or else to make his present opinions more taking and plausible (as if he had not fell into them by chance, but got them after much and serious study) I find that he frequently doth usher them in, by profes∣sing that he was once a Calvinist (for that it
seemes must be the Name of Obloquie to those, who, according to Scripture (of which Calvin was the best Interpreter, that God hath yet vouchsafed his Church) do maintaine Absolute Predestination) but he was frighted into his wits (for so he is plea∣sed to play upon himsefe) by considering the Hor∣rible consequences of Absolute Reprobation.
Were I willing to make my selfe worke in this time of my retirement here, by engaging with a Person, who is, as some thinke very able, I am sure very confident, and very Angry; I would not desire greater advantage then these few words of his might give me: for to be an Arminian, I meane an Asserter of Universall Redemption, and of those other Tenets which lead to it or flow from it, a very little paines will serve the turne; and every man is so Naturally apt to make himselfe a sharer with God, and to cozen himselfe with hopes of mercy, that it is a much harder matter to escape those opinions, then to attaine them. Besides for any to be deferred from the maintenance of any truth in Thesi, because it seemes attended with unanswerable difficulties, and many ill consequen∣ces, is to my thinking very unreasonable: since if that may be admitted, all the mysterious part of our Religion which containes the Credenda must never expect either to be entertained or defended. I might adde farther, that for any to be frighted into his wits, is a thing altogether unusuall: and if it hath indeed in this matter so fared with that Gen∣tleman,
he is the first who can boast of the Expe∣riment.
But, my Lord, I am not desirous to dispute at all in these matters, much lesse with one, who is so ta∣ken up with abusing persons of greater worth, that he cannot find leasure to take notice of one so In∣considerable as my selfe: onely entending to handle some part of that question which is now in contest, I must crave leave to professe, that I never yet was satisfied, but that those fatall consequences, what∣ever they are, which are thought to attend Absolute Reprobation, they do as farre as I can see equally Accompany Gods Prescience, of which yet this Gentleman is a zealous assertour. For if God foresees who will refuse the meanes of Grace, he foresees likewise that he will assist one and not ano∣ther: and that without such particular Divine assi∣stance, it is impossible any should believe and be saved. Now what is this else, but for men at long runne, after much time mispent in wrangling, to have recourse unto Gods Absolute but yet discri∣minating Will and Power, which at their first set∣ting out they were desirous to decline.
As for those Tragicall stories and dreadfull No∣things, wherewith that Gentlemans writings, and before him Acta Synodalia are stuffed, concerning God's cruelty, Tyranny and I know not what else— As also the vaine and impertinent declaiming from the common places of Gods Justice, and mercy, thereby to enervate or at least to Enveigh against
Gods Absolute, Irresistable, and Unaccountable Sove∣raignty. All this terrible talke is nothing but Noise and Flourish, fit indeed to amuse a country Audito∣ry, or to impose upon a lazy and superficiall reader; but certainly of very little weight with them, who dare not be frighted from, nor talked out of their faith, and who thinke Scripture truths are to be embraced and followed, in spite of all mens corrupt and empty reasonings against them.
Out of the Scriptures therefore I have underta∣ken briefly to demonstrate these two things,
First, That whatever opinion is manifestly revea∣led in Scripture, (such as I take Absolute Reproba∣tion to be) to argue against it, and by Artifices of Humane Wit, and Eloquence to seek to overthrow and disgrace it, this is nothing else but to dispute a∣gainst God, and impiously to be wise above what is written.
Secondly, That God hath from all Eternity designed a particular Number unto Eternall life, and that this Election is Absolute. From whence it followes, that all those who are not by God in that Act of Absolute Election appointed to life, they are reprobated, i. Designed for destruction; which Decree is Absolute, made by Soveraigne Will, but Executed in justice.
And this my Lord, is the summe of the Ensuing Treatises; for the publishing of which, next to the care, every Christian should have to see the Truths of God, so farre as they are revealed to him asser∣ted
and freed from cavill, especially in a contra∣dicting, and every way too quarrel some Age; I have no one outward motive more prevailing with me, then my, perhaps too great, Ambition of presen∣ting something to your Lordship, whereby I might testify to the World, not onely that reall esteeme I have of your Lordship's singular worth and emi∣nence in generall, but likewise to manifest in parti∣cular how mindfull I am of those many signall and Unparallelled markes of Favour, which You have been pleased to conferre upon my selfe; for which, though the service of my whole life will be too poore and meane a sacrifice, and no endeavour can amount to deserve the name of requitall, yet I could not but thinke it my duty to study an ac∣knowledgment: which Zeale of mine, if your Lord∣ship pleases either to accept or pardon, I have at∣teined my end; For I aime at nothing more then the Honour of being owned for
My Noble Lord
