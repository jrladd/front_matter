MVch here is said, Tabacco to defend,
And much was said, abacco to disgrace:
Reade, marke, and scan: then censure in the end:
Both you are men, most fit to iudge the case.
Esteeme of me, as you in me shall find:
Craue pardon first I do: and that obtaind,
Know this, that no man shall with better mynd,
Each where declare to you his loue vnfaind.


Come what shall come, to this poore Indian toy:
Vnto you both, I wish immortall ioy.
