Thou eye of Honour, Nurserie of Fame,
Still teeming-Mother of immortall seed:
Receiue these blessed Orphanes of thy breed
As from thy happie issue first they came.


Those flowing wits that bathed in thy foord,
And suck't the honie dew from thy pure pap:
Returne their tribute backe into thy lap,
In rich-wrought lines, that yeelde no idle woord.


O let thy Sonnes from time to time supplie
This Garden of the Muses, where dooth want
Such Flowers as are not, or come short, or scant
Of that perfection may be had thereby:
So shall thy name liue still, their fame ne're dye,
Though vnder ground whole worlds of time they lie.

Stat sine morte decus.
