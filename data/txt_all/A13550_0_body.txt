MADAM;
HAving im∣portuned and pre∣vailed with that
 Reverend Preacher, who performed that last office for your LADISHIPS late Servant, to af∣ford me a perfect Coppie of his Ser∣mon, (which for the fitnes and wor∣thinesse of the mat∣ter, I thought much pittie to be buryed with her) and pur∣posing to adde a short Relation of the happie Life and
 Death of my deare Wife, both which I thought were ve∣ry exemplary; I em∣boldned my selfe, to present the same to your HONOVR, not only as a thank∣full testification, of my humble dutie and service, for all those gracious en∣dowments, which I so happily enioy∣ed in her, (of all which, vnder God,
 your HONOVR was a chiefe instru∣ment) but also be∣cause I know that your HONOVR, who gladly appre∣hended all the meanes of her com∣fort through her life, would as glad∣ly receiue the true Narration of her as∣sured Comforts and Conquest in her so Christian death and dissolution.

 Neither is the Ser∣on vnfit for your HONOVRS perv∣all, whom God hath honored with o many dayes, and eares; and taught ot to feare eyther he end of your Pil∣grimage out of this strange Countrey, or the neare ap∣proch to your own ome.
Thus humbly pray∣ng your HONORS
 acceptance of tha which is most pro¦perly yours. I pra the Father of me¦cies, to adde to a your noble Vertue the continuance o your true prosper¦tie.
