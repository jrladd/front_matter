MADAM,
SOme years since ca∣sting my Eye on a Catalogue of the Ministers of State, I thought it a defect in History, that such Persons as had imme∣diately born the Supream

Office under their Sove∣raign, as the Governours of Ireland (than whom none comes in State and Dignitie, nearer the Confines of Ma∣jesty) should want their just Register, imperfect ones (a∣dulterated with other cir∣cumstances) I have seen ma∣ny. And there upon (though conscious of much Tenuity) I applied my leisure to re∣duce their Succession to the present Age. But not be∣ing satisfied with my endea∣vours (no more than with the late crude Efforts of others in this kind) I suspended the Work till MDCLXXII.

that the excellent Charles Earl of Derby (your illu∣strious Lord) vouchsafed his Mecoenacie, on which I re∣sumed strength. But He being (that Year) unseasona∣bly hewed down by many complicate distempers (bet∣ter born than evicted) I languished in the Combate, yet (after some pause) ha∣ving nothing to offer at his Shrine (to whom so much is due) but what (before his death) was the oblation, I thought it ingratitude to withdraw it, whilest I might presume on your counte∣nance, ever ready to secure

his Indulgence and extend Yours, though after all  fear I have, with most Pain∣ters drawn an excellent face to its disadvantage, the work being much maimed of what I intended, some things in this Age being not safe to think of, much less to publish. However (having traced the Succession of the Empire to the present) I know not (on the score of having designed it for my Lord) whom to entitle it more proper to, than to your self (his Relique) de∣scended from a Noble Pro∣genie, clear in its Original, more by its sufferings in a

Cause the State and Su∣pream Council of this Kingdom once owned with all imaginable Zeal, it being thought Infidelity and Cru∣elty, yea Improvidence and folly not to succour it: and therefore you are the like∣lier, by a Sympathy, to coun∣tenance those, who, by a se∣ries of Troubles, have wa∣ded through the Affronts of an unsetled and subtle Na∣tion, at whose Helm many of my Lords Ancestors have long sate. As also those, and their Ancestors too, with whom your illustrious Son hath contracted the nearest

and most honourable Alli∣ance: so as this leads you to their Merits, whose Effi∣gies you have often reveren∣ced in your Gallery, than which I had nothing more solemn to offer, though this intrusion summons all your Vertues to absolve
Madam,
