THere is none Prints
more, nor publishes less
than I; for I Print one∣ly
for my self and pri∣vate
Friends (and had
I not thought these more passible than
the rest, I had never made them so
publick as I do.)
I write chiefly to avoid Idleness,
and print to avoid the Imputation:
and as others do it to live after they
are dead; I do it onely not to be
thought dead whilst I am a live: (for
as the concealing what one does, little
differs from Idleness, so the being I∣dle,

little differs from being dead.)
Epigram in general, is a quick
and short kinde of Writing, rather a
slight, than any great force of the
Spirit; and therefore the more fit for
me, who  not to take pains in any
thing, and rather affect a little neg∣ligence,
than too great curiosity
(which I desire may serve for excuse
of my negligence in some of these.)
Epigrams at their first institution
served onely for Inscriptions of
Ports, and Entries of Temples, and
publick places, and consisted onely
in a Distick, or line or two; till at
length, by degrees, they became so much
enlarg'd, both for matter and quain∣tity,
as there was nothing that was
not matter of Epigram, and no
length it woud not admit of, so it
kept but close unto the matter, with
that lse and quickness which was Re∣quisite
and essential to it; and espe∣cially
aoided long discourses, which
is  improper for it, as a long Robe
for one who is to run a Race.

For these here, they are chiefly in
praise of worthy persons, of which none
had ever a more plentiful subject than
I, having been always conversant with
the best and worthiest in all places
where I came; and amongst the rest
with Ladies, in whose conversation,
as in an Academy of Vertue, I
learnt nothing but Goodness, saw
nothing but nobleness; and one might
as well be drunk in a Christial Foun∣tain,
as have any evil thoughts whilst
they were in their Company. Which
I shall gladly always remember, as
the happiest and innocentest part of
all my life; and that they are mixt
with the dispraise of others, 'tis one∣ly
as sawce unto the rest, which shud
always have somewhat of sharp
piquant in it.
I was long deliberating before I
publisht them, whether I shud range
them in order, or let them pass pro∣misculously,
till at last (to save the
Heralds labour) I resolv'd on this
latter way, onely I have separated

the more Light and Theatical ones,
and the more Grave and Pious ones
from the rest, as being particularly
subjects of themselves.
Of which Pious ones, this I will
onely say, that Piety and Devtion,
Consisting chiefly in moving the Af∣fection,
Verse seems the fittest lan∣guage
for it, and of all Verse, that of
Epigrams: it being a short Jaculatory,
kinde of writing, and therefore the
aptest to penetrate the brest, it is that
which strews the way of Vertue and
Piety with Roses insteed of Thorns:
and one reason why no more are de∣lighted
with it, is because it is no
more delightfully perswaded; and
then it was when Verse was wholly
imployed in Devotion, that Poetry
was called the Language of the Gods,
your Poets, Prophets, and such as
Moses and David were Poets: nor
will it ever be well with the World,
till things return to their first insti∣tution,
and Poets take as much pains
to render Piety and Vertue delight∣ful,

as now they do Vice and Impiety.
Whatsoever they are, they are yours,
for I have made them for you, and to
dedicate them to any one in particu∣lar,
were to do injury to the rest, take
them amongst you then, for 'tis but
just, that I should Dedicate all I have
to you, to whom I have dedicated
my self.
