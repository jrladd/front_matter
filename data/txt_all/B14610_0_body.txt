THis translation (worshipful Sir) liynge longe in obscurîty, which might, ere this, haue benefited manie, had it bene brought to light: a thing which I instantlye, for that cause, desired: to bring the same to passe, by earnest en∣treatie, I obtained it as a guift of your sonne my very friend, concealing my intent & pur∣pose, from him. Since which time, being more and more pricked forward aswell by my
 first motion: as by other my friendes perswasion, that had the sight therof: I was vrged, for this and other reasons, to commit the same to the Prin∣ter: that by the publishinge thereof, eche Christian reader, (for whose sake, the godly au∣thor, whosoeuer he was, did first sette it foorth in french) might receiue such profitable, and comfortable instructions, as are therein contained. And because that it is a vsuall thing amongst many, (wherof some doe it for a custome, some in hope of commoditie, & some of meere affection) to dedi∣cate such laboures to speciall patrones: consideringe with my selfe that your fatherlie desertes towardes him, who haue bene the onelie author of all whatsoeuer he hath, did
 claime the same: I shold haue done great iniurie to him, and you both, if I had commen∣ded it to the patronage of any other, then to your worship, to whom no man can be more bound, then he is: for indeede the benefites of the parents to the childe do passe all other. Thus beseeching god to graūt him such successe in all his stu∣dies, as may be to his glorie; & your worship like encrease, of all spirituall and temporall blessinges: do humblie com∣mit you to his heauenlie pro∣tectiō.
 Oxon. the XVI. of No∣uember. 1581
