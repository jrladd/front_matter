HAuyng a duetifull desire, moste re∣doubted
soueraigne, to be daily exer∣cised
in some seruisable deuice and
action (that maie please my Prince
and countrey) I neither spare paines
nor season, to purchace through prac∣tise
of pen, and studie of heade, my desired hope.
But waiyng the greatnesse of your Maiestie and
Princely iudgement, I am to seeke, not onely what woor∣des
dooeth best become me, but likewise what woorkes I
should present, especially to her highnesse, that hath suche
giftes frō the heauens, as all our earthly imaginations, &
base matter here belowe, maie of right giue place vnto.
And to offer any present where suche parfections doe
abounde, and the fountaine of many graces dooeth freely
flowe, the presumption were greate, and the boldenesse
scarce pardonabel. Yet moste gracious Ladie, albeit I dare

not bryng water to the well heade of knowledge, and com∣fortable
spryng (frō whence all kinde of people doe drawe
succour and releef) yet my hope is, that my humble and
vpright meanyng (of this my woorke) shall finde fauour
in your highnesse sight.
In whiche worke I compare, Flaunders, Fraūce,
Portugall, Irelande, and Scotlande, to bee the
shell of a precious Nutte, the sweete Kirnell whereof
is the blessed state of ENGLANDE. And though
with worldly wickednesse, and troubles of our tyme, the
goodly shell is somewhat wormeaten and cracked, the Kir∣nell
shewes it self so sounde, that Gods greate goodnesse &
glorie is partly or altogether therein expressed.
And now by my verses and description is onely tou∣ched
(by all curtuous and reuerent meanes) but the trou∣bles
and misfortunes of euery countrie a parte, goyng no
further in any frase of speeche, then Christian zeale, loue,
and duetie maie commaunde a good minde to sette out, as
knoweth our liuyng Lorde, who sende your Maie∣stie
many good and gracious newe yeres,
with a blessed and prosperous
olde raigne ouer vs.
FINIS.
