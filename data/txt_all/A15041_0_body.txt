SIr the renowne, of the right honourable, the late Lord kepers ver∣tues, and the regard of my vnablenesse to re∣port them, staied my indeuor (for a time) to worke a remem¦brance of his worthy and wel imploied life, and hindred my desire, to commit my notes to your learned censure. But waiyng that wise men winne moralitie out of trifles, as Bees draine honie forth of weedes: and worthie mindes allowe

of euery mannes good will, as the chie∣fest garlande of curtesie. I haue perfor∣med my attempte, and aduentured on your acceptance, beseching your wor∣shipp, in iudgement to imprint, what I haue left of his vertues vnreported, and to pardon my owne inuentiō, not wor∣thy your vewe, for sure I am to faile in the one, whether I exceade or no, in the other. Appelles easily and liuely coun∣terfetted Alexander, but learned Plu∣tarke, hardly discouereth his conditiōs. Heracleotes perfectly painted Hellen, but Ouid erred in penning her wantō∣nesse. So difficulte a woorke it is to dis∣course, the liues bothe of the good and bad, as (according to Senicaes opinion) it is ncessarie that the vertuous reporte the one, and the vitious publishe the o∣ther.

For that in these causes, it is more needefull, to haue experience to iudge, then wit to deuise. Phormio learnedly deuinyng of warre, of Haniball was deamed vnwise, for that beyng a Phi∣losopher, he vndertooke the charge of a souldier. The like maie be my check, that presume to pen the life of a graue Counseller, that of yeres am grene, & of iudgement incertaine: neuertheles I am the rather to bee pardoned, for that greater clarkes haue in this pointerred. (besides my good will) the woorke in∣structes, and no waie hurtes, whiche if it passe with your fauour, I hold my self fully satisfied, and my paines well īm∣ployed the 4. daye of Marche.
