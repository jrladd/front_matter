RIGHT HONOURABLE,
WHen I first received your Commands for the publishing of this Discourse, I dare not say, but that I did secretly rejoice: But not upon those vain Reasons that perhaps some may invidiously suppose, but only that I had hopes thereby given me, that the Truths therein were as favourably entertained, as (I am sure) they were honestly intended, and therefore the more likely to have some good effect upon them that heard them.
I am very sensible, both how meanly they were delivered, and how homely worded, but, my Lord,
 Your acceptance supplies both those Defects. And if they may in any little measure promote the great Ends of Preaching, and be serviceable to any in the Purposes of Religion, but especially if they may induce this City to pursue the Methods to Honour and Safety, and to Divine Protection, the great Ensurer of both, I shall have great cause to rejoice in my labour, and bless God for the Success of it. In humble hopes of which, I shall instantly address to him, who can give all these Effects, and who is always ready and forward to do so, even God Almighty: Who that he may still continue his Mercies and Compassions to this City, is and shall be the Prayer of,
Right Honourable,
