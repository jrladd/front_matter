RIGHT REVEREND,
THese few Sermons cannot in good man∣ners expose them∣selues to the view of all, except they first make an humble re∣cognition of your Lordships fauor to their Author. For some of them were vttered in the hearing, others by the appointment of your Lordship, whose
zeale hath euer reioyced, not onely in your owne personall paines taking that way, but in drawing priuate Talents vnto publicke vse for the buil∣ding vp of Gods Church. None I suppose but iudgeth himselfe honoured in your Lordships imploiment: I am sure, tis hard for affection to wish your Lordship more good, then the effect of all their praiers, who, when they saw the light of their common example, and the strength of their general incouragement increased, thought them∣selues raised in your Lordships preferment. Amongst whom mine heart can truly testifie, that he mistakes not, who∣soeuer ranketh,
