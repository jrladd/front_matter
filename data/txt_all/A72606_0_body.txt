SYR, I am bould to present vnto you these few MADRIGALES, and I pray you as you haue heeretofore (rather for your exceeding loue to mee, then for any worth that I acknowledge of the Songs) giuen them your priuate applause & liking, when I sent them to you euer as they were composed in loose papers, so you wil much more now, (for now in-deed when they come to the worlds eye and censure, they had more need of it then euer) Vouchsafe to giue them your good countenance and publick patronage. In trueth I must confesse, they are like young birds feared out of the nest before they be well feathered, & finde no place so fit to light on as on the braun∣ches of your fauour: where (such is your loue to mee and Musick) I hope they wilbe so shrou∣ded in the leaues of your good liking, that you will giue leaue neither to any rauenous Kite nor craftie fowler (I meane neither to any open mouthed Momus nor more slie detractor) to deuoure, or harme them, that cannot succor nor shift for themselues. I could wish them a Cage of as many sweet singing Nightingales to salute your eares with the choisest of delight∣full Notes and the melody of most eare-pleasing harmony, that your idle time might not passe without delight, if they might yeeld it to you. But whatsoeuer they are, yours they are, & for you onely they were made. It was your good countenance that did encourage mee to this; Your loue to Musick doth not onely chalenge it of mee, but euen the vttermost that Musicks art can afford; which if it were in mee, I would most willingly offer to you; Now let these my affectionate indeuours be accepted, since this is all that I can performe: except the honoring of your Vertues, and obseruance of your worthinesse.
