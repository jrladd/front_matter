Most gracious Soveraign,
WITH no smal paines (and the more for want of my books, and of any setled place, being multum terris jactatus & alto, frighted out of mine house, and tost betwixt two distracted Kingdoms) I have collected out of the sacred Scri∣pture, explained by the ancient Fathers, and the best Writers of God's Church, these few Rights out of many, that God, and Nature, and Nations, and the Lawes of this Land have fully and undeniably granted unto our Soveraign Kings. My witness is in Heaven, that as my conscience di∣rected me, without any squint aspect, so I have with all sincerity, and freely traced and expressed the truth, as I shall answer to the contrary at the dreadful judgement; ; therefore with all fervency I humbly supplicate the divine Majesty, still to assist Your Highness, that, as in Your lowest ebb, You have put on Righteousness as a breast plate, and with an heroick Resolu∣tion withstood the proudest waves of the raging Seas, and the violent Attempts of so many imaginary Kings; so now, in Your acquired strength, You may still ride on with Your
 honour; and for the glory of God, the preservation of Christ his Church, and the happiness of this Kingdom, not for the greatest storm that can be threatned, suffer these Rights to be snatched away, nor Your Crown to be thrown to the dust, nor the Sword, that God hath given You, to be wrest∣ed out of Your hand by these uncircumcised Philistines, these ungracious Rebels, and the Vessels of God's wrath, , unlesse they do most speedily repent; for if the unrighteous will be unrighteous still, and our wickednesse provoke God to bring our Land to Desolati∣on, Your Majesty, standing in the truth, and for the right, for the honour of God, and the Church of his Son, is ab∣solved from all blame, and all the bloud that shall be spilt, and the oppressions, insolencies, and abhominations that are perpetrated, shall be required at the hands, and reven∣ged upon the heads of these detested Rebels. You are, and ought in the truth of cases of conscience, to be informed by Your Divines; and I am confident that herein they will all subscribe, that God will undoubtedly assist You, and arise in his good time, to maintain his own cause; and by this war, that is so undutifully, so unjustly made a∣gainst Your Majesty, so Giant-like fought against Hea∣ven, to overthrow the true Church, You shall be glorious like King David, that was a man of War, whose dear son raised a dangerous rebellion against him, and in whose reign so much bloud was spilt; and yet, notwithstanding these distempers in his Dominion, he was a man according to God's own heart, especially, because that from α to ωAs, in the be∣ginning, by re∣ducing the Ark from the Phi∣listins, through∣out the midst, by setling the service of the Tabernacle, & in the ending by his resoluti∣on to build, & leaving such a treasure for the erecting of the Temple., the beginning of his reign, to the end of his life, his chiefest en∣deavour was to promote the service, and protect the ser∣vants of the Tabernacle, the Ministers of God's Church. God Almighty so continue Your Majesty, bless You and protect You in all Your wayes, Your vertuous, pious Queen, and all Your royal Progeny. Which is the dayly prayer of
