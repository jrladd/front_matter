HONOR DENYeS not grace to any Muse,
When any Muse attributes grace to HONOR;
Then had these Sisters teares, which here insues
Not dul'd my Muse and throwne these woes vpon her,
(Most Noble Lady) at whose happy birth,
Men gaue you HONOR, and the heauens such grace,
That you are thought their Angell vpon earth,
My Muse had sung your prayses in this place:
Yet since these three faire Ladyes, for your worth,
As partner in their plaints for HENRIE dead,
From all your tender Sex doe choose your forth,
Vouchsafe to grace these Funerall teares they shed:
And for such grace may all the learned nine
All prayses offer at your HONORS shrine.
