MADAM,
YOUR dearest Relation was pleased to order both the Text and Preacher for the Solemni∣ty of his Funeral. This plain, un∣polish'd Sermon hath nothing to deserve to appear in Print, but that it hath a profitable Subject; these are Truths that do not only deserve the serious enquiry of Mortals, but the studious speculation of Angels. Nothing can be more profitable than the frequent and familiar thoughts of that state to
 which we are going. Now, Madam, that your affectionate Consort is gone hefore, let your Faith look upward to the Counsel of God, and forward to the promised Resurrection: Faith sees things at the greatest distance in their futurition: He is out of sight, but not lost; he lives still in his better part in the highest Heavens; he lives still in the hopeful Branches left be∣hind him; he lives still in his good Name among all that knew him, and will in after Ages; he shall live and return to a more glorious Life when The Heavens shall be no more. Let your Faith and Hope hold out till they have landed you in that upper Hea∣ven that shall never be dissolved. That these few Lines may contribute to this great end, is the Prayer of him that rec∣kons himself much obliged to serve you.
