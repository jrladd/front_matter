SIr, I stande at a stay like the Ladie of
THSSALI, and in a mamering
maze like ALEXANDERS man, the o
making pitious plaintes in beholding
the picture of her person, fearing she
shoulde not be fancied, and alwaies la∣mented
when she wrote any letter,
doubting it shoulde be disliked: The other wept in win∣ter
for extremitie of colde, and sorowed, in summer to re∣member
the returne of HYMS. So rest I assayled vvith
such perplexities, and frozen with like eare, not only dou∣ting
to discouer these honorable Actions, for feare of the
misreporting: but also fearing mine  vnworthiness
and want of skilfull eloquence to set fth so woorthie a
matter (as was the last Triumph perfourmed before her
Maiestie:) Yet I considered with my selfe, better an ill re∣porter
then a dumme speaker, better badly  open then
quite forgotten, & better Porredge then no  VVhen
APPOLLO is a sheepe then AN is chief nstrill: vvhen
PALLAS is absent, then SERES is  when TVL∣IE
is out of tovvn, thē CRASSVS may crake of his cun∣ning.
Therfore sh no mā vvriteth at al of these vvorthies,
nor no persō publisheth the exploits of these nobles, rather
thē oblition should diminish their merits, I haue attēpted
the vvriting. And so nere as I could I haue made a collecti∣on
both of their names, speaches, and chiefest inuentions,
vvhich as they bee, I present to your presence in name of
a nevvse or noueltie, knovving none more vvorthie then
your self, to vvhom to present this Pamphlet, both for your
knovvledge in approued Martial Chiualrie, nor none vvhō
I honour or ovve more dutifull loyaltie. As report hath
rong forth your deserued vvorthynes, and flying FAM
hath resouded your seruice, both in greene youth and

these your graue yeres, employed asvvell in vvarres as in
peace, in quailing the enemie, as in ruling your countrey,
in aduenturing abroad, in aduertising at home, then a con∣ductor,
novv a  valiant as MARS, novve made
a ciuill MAGISTRAT, then boldly in battell till the last
blovve, novve  home in trayning vp souldiers, and
to be short, then  ted a Captaine, like ACHILLES
for coura  as SCIPIO for singuler cun∣saile.
 vvould delight you to heare of the
tovvar  English Nobles, and of the courage of
our courtlie crue, sith you vvere absent at the perfouing
of these pleasures, I haue at this present for your recreation
thus certified these courtly and knightly discourses, to
you vvho in times past haue bene, as gallant a courtier as a
valliant souldier: But if you ere this haue bene tolde of this
Triumph, it may be you heard not the names of the parties▪
ad though you haue heard of the number of rumours, ye
paraduenture you knowe not theffect of their speaches,
and though you haue hd of their seueral coppies: yet hap∣pely
you misse of their sunde inuentions, and though
you be priuie to most o these matters, yet hope I you vvill
like nere the vvorse of my labours, nor make lesse account
of this my vvel meaning: therfore as one more aduenturus
thē vvarie, more presuptuous thē vvittie, more oole hard
then praise vvorthy, I submit my selfe to the knees of your
courtesie, to like of me and my present, hopng to find that
fauour at your handes vvhich an Emperour once shevv∣ed
to his simplest Subiect, vvho more esteemed his poore
dish of vvaer, thē the gifts of gold of his richest machāts,
the one proceding of loue to his povver, the other in hope
of a greater gain? vvhose Image if you imitate I pronounce
my self happie, and tho gain that I looke for, is your graci∣ous
good vvill? vvhereby I shalbe emboldened to attempt
some vvorke more vvorthy, to gratifie your goodnes and
to make mo manifest my dutifull loyaltie, vvishing you
novve and eueral things vvorldly to your vertuous vvill,
& after the time of this transitorie life, your soule may sing
Alleia vvith the number of thelect, and reap that revvard
vvhich remianeth endlesse.
