Sir,
THe cause why the a∣bundant satisfaction I inwardly conceived, at the receipt of your most obliging Letter, and reading of that excellent Diatribe of Doctor Basiers, which accompanied it (by Mr. Coventrie's fa∣vour)

according to your di∣rection, hath no sooner thus dilated it self on Paper, hath been that ingenious young Gentlemans absence these Holy-daies, as hee himself will (I doubt not) for my further justification, testifie; I do therefore, Sir, with all gratitude, acknowledge both Dr. Basier's, and your ample favours, in this whole de∣sign, no less relating to what is already so worthily per∣formed, than to what is also so meritoriously projected

and intended, as that I should do my self great wrong to re∣fuse the annex of my name; where it should rather be my ambition to have it appear; But, on the other side, give mee leave, Sir, to suggest one caution, that you take heed (since you intend it should pass currant in Eng∣land) the stamp of my name do not, in regard of my Re∣lation to my Royal Master, (I will not say, adulterate the coin, or abate the intrinseck value, but) make it less wel∣come

to praeoccupated and misperswaded Readers. The Doctor's English Letter, to mee, I hold not only fit for the Press, as a testimony of the Authors eminent indu∣stry and merit, but also as it is useful to the publick, in∣deed, such a one, written with so Apostolical a spirit, as that I have been often heard to say, that I could never read it, but as a kinde of nine-and-twentieth of the Acts; Use therefore I beseech you, Sir, my name with all freedome,

as you think good, you can∣not entitle mee to any thing of this kind, which doth not add, as to my honour, so to my obligation to you; whose prone, and undeserved, fa∣vour herein I shall, upon all occasions, ambitiously en∣deavour to requite by some more solid acknowledge∣ment, than this bare signing my self, Most Worthy Sir,
Paris,
this first day of the year, 1658.
which I heartily wish you most happy.
