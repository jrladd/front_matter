KNowing what Building is, and shown it at your owne Charge, this Little Treatise is then (as I do conceive) well ad∣drest to you, without any tedious repetitions in this Epistle; nor doth the Treatise (by many Lines) entrench on the time and pati∣ence



of a Reader; It recommends to a good Clark of the Works, to see the Workmen per∣form what they know ought to be done to Build well; and this cannot be offensive to men that mean so, nor more then the respects of,
Honoured Sir,
