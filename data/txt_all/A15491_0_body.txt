MOST Noble Princes, such is the loue which out of my souls humilitie I owe vnto your High nesses, that I may not but in con∣science
of all binding dutifull al∣legiance expresse vnto your Ma∣iesties, moved so to doe vpon the first ioyfull generall good newes of your Maiesties safe approa∣ching, your happie welcomming, and receiving both, (by so manie thousands of your Loving Sub∣iects,) into the Garden-plotte of Albion the citie of London, the most stately imperiall throne of your Excellencies. with whō for so much as it fared not so well with mee thē absent, to participate of their congratulating mirth, in behoul∣ding with thē, (which was a thing most comfortable vnto all true English harts,) of your sacred Per∣son, and at this instant to increase the word for the increasing of our
ioy, of your Persons: I nowe ac∣cording to my ranke and place, a Scholler by profession, (though the meanest amōgst ten thousād) haue thought it a matter benefici∣all to manie of the houshold of God, and not preiudicial (I hope) to anie which will be counted the friends of God, to offer this Glasse and maine point of Christianity, the verie tutchstone and seale it selfe of our profession, vnto your Graces favourable Clemencies; so much the rather I say, because we assure our selves that you are the Lords annointed, raised vp & preserved by th'almighty Jehouah to sway the Scepter of this most happy Land, in having your Roy∣all presēce to manage the affaires
thereof: as eke more speciallie to reare vp and magnifie his truth, which was likely to bee thrust vn∣to the walles through the vnder∣mining & cankerlike fretting de∣signements of pestilent wicked men. Besides, after the smallenes of my talent, which the Lord in mercie hath lent me for a time to exchange vnto his glorie, I shall most humbly beseech your High: favours to be invited by me, (the vnderling and lowest one of all your subiectes,) as the choisest & chiefest guestes, vnto the Lords owne mysticall & heavenly holy banquet. By meanes whereof o∣thers, who as yet do keepe a loofe without, by taking example from your Excellencies, (which casteth
forth both light and life vnto our selues, that are within) may bee at length allured from the hedges and high waies side, to drawe still neerer and neerer, & sitte downe as guestes vvith you at the selfe same table, and so furnish vp the empty roomes of Christ his king∣dome, which remaine behinde, and doe continually waite and lie open night and day, for farther & more frequent companie.
Thus with all submission en∣devouring to testifie the inward loyaltie and soundnes of my obe∣dient heart, which manie others both of high place and lowe haue done before mee: I will end vvith humble supplicatiō for your Ma∣iesties, that it would please God
of his mercie to be your mightie tower of defence against all your enemies domestical & forraigne, that he would extend your daies & renue your yeares, making you stronge & lustie as an Eagle, for his owne glories sake, to both your owne soules health & com∣fort, the good of the Church, and the honour of England: lastly, that he would giue vnto you both  Oxon: Iulij 26. 1603.
