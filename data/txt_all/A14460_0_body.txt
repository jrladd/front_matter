HAVING englished (right honora∣ble) this litle short Treatise of the Cawtelles of the moste Blasphemous, Abhominable, and Monstrous Po∣pish Masse: And hauing withall well weyed and considered that the enemies of the grace of God (the Papistes I meane) both in elder dayes helde, and at this day hold in meruelous great estimation and reuerence the same, as the chiefe ground worke, maine piller, & onely corner stone of their superstitious and i∣dolatrous religion, (if it may be sayd a religion) an in∣uention most contrary to the holy institution of the sup∣per of our Lord Iesus Christ, to the great dishonour of
him & of his Church, still fiercely & bloodely (where they haue dominion & rule) with sword, fire, & fagot mainteining it: I thought it (in my poore opinion) a worke most necessary both for the glory of God, & also for the benefite of the ignoraunter sorte of my countrey men, to send it abroad amongest them, that they might thereby perfectly see & rightly iudge (if they will not continue willfully blind) how grossely both their Aun∣cestors, and they them selues also, haue bene by that shorne broode of Antechristian Balamytes, the onely blockish and shameles deuisers of the same horribly a∣bused & fondly led. And because (Sir) the booke es∣pecially and chiefly the comment vpon the same is wor∣thy the publishing: I haue therefore in a Christian boldnes presumed on your honorable curtesie, to offer & present it vnto your wise and graue consideration, as to a moste honourable personage worthy & meete to stand the Patrone & defender of so notable a work, most humbly beseeching you not so much to regard the basenes of the Translation, as the sounde dealing of myne Author in the discouering & confuting of their most monstrous & palpable dolteries. In doing where∣of your L. shall not binde me alone in myne owne perti∣culer, but all the whole Church of God also in gene∣rall, within all her Maiesties Realmes and dominions, dayly to pray for the prosperous estate of your L. long to continue. London the sixt of February. 1584.
