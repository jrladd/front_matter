Reverend Sir,
IF the PRESENT which I here make
You, should occasion any Renewal of
Your Grief, You know where to Charge
it. Though I should Hope, a repeated Re∣flection
on Your Deceased Yoke-fellows Cor∣respondence,
both in Temper and Practise,
with the Instances and Patterns propos'd for
Imitation in the Text, which I (with Your

Approbation) fixt on for the Subject of the
Ensuing Discourse, might administer Conso∣lation
and Refreshment.
FOR it cannot but be very comfortable,
to have so good Grounds to believe, that at
the same Time when withdrawn from You,
She was remov'd out of a troublesome World,
into that Better Countrey, which had Her
Heart so long before: Where She hath un∣speakably
better Friends, and better Enter∣tainments,
than this World was ever capable
of affording Her; and that without any mix∣ture,
or fear of Change.
IT hath pleas'd GOD (Sir) that in
the midst of a great many signal Mercies, You
have met with a Variety of Difficulties and
Troubles; some of which have been attended
with very uncomfortable Circumstances. I
take this Opportunity to join with You in
heartily Rejoicing, and Blessing Him, who
hath so wonderfully supported You under, and
so comfortably carry'd You through all hither∣to.
Methinks You had a peculiar Mercy,

under the most Furious Assaults of those enve∣nom'd
Spirits, who combin'd together (some∣time
since) to blast Your Reputation, (of
some of whom 'tis sufficiently evident, that
they aim'd at giving a Wound to the Ministry
in General through Your Sides;) in having
such a Domestick Instance of Exemplary Pa∣tience
in Your Dear Consort: Who though
deeply Affected, and not free from just Re∣sentments
of their Inhumanity; (especially
in Charging You with Vnkindness to Her,
who ever retain'd a most thankful Sense of
Your endearing Love and Tenderness;) yet
carried it all along with that evenness of
Temper, that Christian Composure, and Vn∣dauntedness;
(being fully satisfi'd from first
to last, of the Groundlessness of their malici∣ous
Insinuations) as seem'd wonderful to all
who knew, and observ'd Her. I am persua∣ded,
You then reap'd much Comfort and Be∣nefit,
as from the serious Supplications of
Your Loving Flock, and many other Christi∣an
Friends on Your behalf, so also from Hers
Particularly, which were sent Vpwards with
a peculiar Tenderness and Fervour. And

Your Loss of Her Prayers, by Her Removal,
is with me (and I doubt not with You much
more) of considerable Account.
WOVLD the most Angry and Censori∣ous,
but take the Pains to peruse, and have
the Patience seriously to consider, those Genu∣ine
and Vnaffected Breathings of a gracious
Heart, a Gospel Spirit, and truly Christian
Temper, which I have inserted in the Annex∣ed
Character of the Deceased, out of Her own
Papers; I could not but Hope, if they had
any remaining Tincture of Sober-minded∣ness,
they would see the Folly of Inveighing
against that sort of Ministry, either as Le∣gal,
or Vn-Evangelical, which GOD so bles∣ses,
and makes use of, to Form Christians
of such a Make, and Spirit, and Temper:
If not, let them go on, and see what they'l
get by it in the Issue. And although, while
they persist in this Course, I am well assur'd
they are doing the Devils Work, yet all the
Hurt I wish them is, that they may not in the
Event fall short of Her, whose Character is
here faithfully though imperfectly given, and

others of the like Stamp, to whom GOD is
pleas'd so remarkably to bless that sort of Mi∣nistry,
which they with so much bitterness
Censure and Condemn.
MAY You (Sir,) If it be the Will of
GOD, shine the Brighter the more others
study to Eclipse you: May the Devil (who
is too subtle to Rage most, where his Interest
is least Assaulted) find You through Divine
Assistance, the more effectually supplanting
and undermining his Kingdom, the more
Opposition he raises against You: May You
be more and more fixt out of the reach of En∣vy
and Bitterness, Rage and Malice: May
the Exemplariness of Your Life and Carriage
silence all the Calumnies of Your Adversaries:
And the Eminent Success of Your Ministerial
Labours, more and more Confirm the Truth
of the Doctrine You deliver: May You still
have fresh Supports afforded, suitable to Your
Tryals and Exigencies: And long remain an
Instance of Publick Spiritedness and Integri∣ty
in a wretchedly Selfish Age: May You have

an abundant Reward above; and have Your
Memory (when You are gone to Rest,) blest
here Below:
This is the Hearty Prayer, Of
SIR,
