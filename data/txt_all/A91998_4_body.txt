Reverend Sirs,
I Have here presented to your view, the Confutation of a Pamphlet, intituled The Doctrine and conversation of John Baptist, wherein you have Christ and Free Grace pretended; and yet the power of grace in the Soules of Christians contemned, and the Kingly Office of Christ rejected, and under colour of Faith and beleeving, the Law of God made void, which the Apostle Rom. 3.31. cries downe with an Absit: and God forbid such doctrins should be suffered, standing so much in opposition to Scripture. Those of this Sect pretend, great know∣ledge, great zeale, great holinesse; so did the Pharisees in Jerusa∣lem; the Donatists in Afrique; the Electi amongst the Manichees: but their knowledge is ignorance; their zeale madnesse; their ho∣linesse hypocrisie: Their writings, speeches, behaviour, are cleare demonstrations of this: It is high time to looke unto, and to meet with such mischievous Doctrines as these: Claudenda Cavea, ante∣quam aves Evolaverint; the cage had need be shut, before such un∣cleane birds as these be flowne: God make you famous instru∣ments for his glory, the good of your King and Country: To the beating downe of Superstition, Heresies and Schisme, and send you favour with God and man: and thus I humbly take leave, desiring your favourable acceptance of my poore endevours.
Et Postquam nos alma Ceres meliore beavit
Fruge: dabo vobis quam dedit illa Ceres.
