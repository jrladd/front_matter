My Lord,
THIS Tribute of my Muse, in Me∣mory of Your Grace's worthy Pre∣decessor, was favourably accepted by many Eminent Persons, and particularly by Your Grace.
Zeal and Affection supply'd my want of Genius; at least Your passionate Respect for
so dear a Friend, inclin'd Your Indulgence to my Performance.
Our Loss in that excellent Patriarch, was justly lamented; but the same Royal Choice that had so well provided for our Church, has once more approv'd it self in supplying her Pastoral Chair.
His Majesty was truly sensible what Mode∣ration of Temper, what Integrity of Heart and Piety of Mind; what Judgment and Constancy were requisite for so Sacred an Office, and so exalted a Station.
My Lord,
If Panegyrick were (as it never was) my Talent, I should decline it in Your Grace's Presence.
Great Souls are least delighted with their own Praises, and the Pious (even in Places of highest Dignity) are Ambitious of no other Encomiums than the private Testi∣mony
of their own Conscience. But even to That I can appeal for the Sincerity of Your Grace's Designs and Endeavours for the real Interests both of our Church and State.
They are so unfeignedly the Motives and Measures of all Your Counsils and Actions, that every English-Man and Well-wisher to his Countrey has a Right of speaking his thankfull Acknowledgments, and, amongst the Rest,
My Lord,
