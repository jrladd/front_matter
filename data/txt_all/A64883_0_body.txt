Worthy Sir,
IT might seem a strange Speech (had it not had a private interpretation) that of Tirestas the Prophet, quoted by the Poet, who answe∣red Liriope, enquiring of him, Whether her son Narcissus should be long lived or not? he re∣plied, He should if he knew not himself; an an∣swer as strange as it was obscure: for that Learned and wise Greek, held, That the knowledg of a mans self was the first step to vertue; and sad experience witnesseth that many in our daies have been ruinated for lack of it, but unhappy Nar∣cissus (if the Poets say true) fell inammored on his own beauty, and so perished. If it made any thing at all to my present pur∣pose, I could quote you what many other Histories say of him; however the Moral of it (if rightly considered) may give a check to such, who pursuing after shadows, lose the substance: As for the Speech of Tiresias, if it be taken in a general accep∣tance, it will be found as false as what is falsest, the knowledg of a mans self being of all Natural knowledg the most profound and most to be desired, for he that knows himself aright cannot but know all the world, because he is an Epitome of it; Know∣ledg was that which Solomon desired when God gave him all the world to chuse in, and bad him ask what he would have, and he would give it him, as you may reade 1 Kings, 3. he said, Lord, give thy servant an understanding heart that he may judg between good and bad: And the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this
 thing: And God said unto him, because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thy self long life, neither hast asked riches for thy self, neither hast asked the life of thy enemies, but hast asked for thy self Knowledg to discern judgment; Behold, I have done according to thy word, Lo, I have given thee a wise and understanding heart, so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee; And also I have given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor. It seems God rewards those with transitory things which seek knowledg of him in the first place, and if so, how will he reward those that labor what they can with might and main to hide knowledg from their Brethren and fellow Creatures? Indeed those that are used to behold and view the Nature and Reasons of things, may easily perceive, not only by the inward Gifts and Endowments of mans Mind, but also by the outward Shape of his Body, far passing and surpassing all o∣ther living Creatures, that he was made for some notable end and purpose above them: This the Poets themselves could and did discover.

Prona{que} cum spectent animalia caetera terram,
Os homini sublime dedit, Coelum{que} videri
Jussit, & erectos, ad sidera tollere vultus.


And whereas others see with down-cast eyes,
He with a lofty look did man indue,
And bad him Heavens transcendent glory view.

It was a most Divine Speech of the Poet indeed, Man was made with an erected face to admire at the glory of the Creator; a man shall seldom hear a truer word in the Pulpit, so that it is palpable that man was not made for Pleasure, nor Honor, nor enough of needful outward things which they commonly call Riches, which the men of this Iron Age look after in the first place, though they be indeed the last and lowest part of the world; they are necessary servants to a man, and as servants they are to be used; and whosoever is respected in this world for his riches sake, he is respected for his servants sake, and not for his own: and indeed neither the Phylosophers of Old, nor yet the Men of our Daies could ever make a true definition what
 Riches was, or at leastwise such an one as could please me: Ari∣stotle held Riches to be enough of things needful, but if that be true, then a Beast is as rich as a Saint. The Stoick Phylosophers held riches to consist in having enough Earth and Air, but if that be true, how should a man do for Victuals? this present world holds riches to be enough of Gold and Silver, but what one of their enoughs is I know not, nor (I am confident) them∣selves neither.
Crescit amor mummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crescit.

—the event doth prove
As Riches doth encrease, so doth its love.

The more Riches men have, the more they desire, and they never know when they have enough; for if a covetous man had as many Needles as Pauls would hold, and as many Bags of Gold as all those needles would last stitching, they would never be contented: besides, if riches consist barely in the enjoyment of money, then that man which Pliny (when Hannibal besieged Casiline, and there was a sore famine in the Town) quotes, would be accounted a very rich man who sold a mouse for two hundred pence one day, and died himself for lack of food the next.
But worthy Sir, It is not Riches I treat of in this Book, but Knowledg, and particularly the knowledg of a mans Body: I will not stand here to prove how much the exact knowledg of the Body conduceth to the mending or marring of the internal Faculties or Endowments of the mind, for that were but to trouble you in the midst of your business amongst your many Imployments, both private at home, and publick abroad for the good of this Nation, the last of which hath made your Name precious in the eyes of all honest people: neither shall I spend time in making an Apology why I appear in print in this Nature wherein I have so many Predecessors in the English Tongue; the reason is clear, Some of them are too large, others too short, none of them have the Demensions of Mans Body so exactly cut in Copper as you shall find them in this Book, wherein, as in a looking Glass, you may see man turned the wrong side out∣wards, and all his internal parts laid open to you view, where∣by
 your spirit may be even ravished in the consideration of the Wisdom and Power of that God who hath made man in such an absolute form, so accurate in all his delineaments; if such be the Creature, what is the Creator?
Lastly, Let me crave pardon, and I hope I shall not be de∣nied it, in presuming to stamp your Name in the beginning of it: Truly your reallity to the good of this Nation was such, and so still continues even in that crooked and perverse Generation in which we live, that I knew no other way how to shew forth a thankful mind to you than by doing as I have done: If it be accounted a fault, let it be venial, and let an honest intent find sooner entertainment with you than a hare-brain'd action.
The God of heaven and earth bless you with the Blessings both of this Life, and that to come, that you may go on in the good work as hitherto you have done, even till such time as it pleaseth him to let us enjoy one desired Liberty. Sir I am
