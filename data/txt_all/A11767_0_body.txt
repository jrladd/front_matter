RIght Worshipfull, because heereto∣fore it hath been a vsuall custome, that those which first haue been re∣sident in other forraine Countries, as Turkey, Persia, and Musco∣uie, haue registred such matters as haue hapned worthy of note in their times, beeing in those partes of the maine Continent Land; wherefore I hauing been lately Resident for your Worship in the Iland of Iaua ma∣ior, toward the East parts of the world: Albeit I am no Scholler to performe it with an eloquent discourse; yet fea∣ring, and withall beeing put in minde by some friendes, that if I neglected it, I should be condemned of slouth: haue thought good to present vnto your Worshippe, these few Lines: the which may certifie you of the great blessings of God, both in preseruing the greatest quantitie of your goods, and our liues; which are come home out of that rude and dangerous Region, into our owne natiue Countrey. Likewise your Worshippe shall vnderstand by this plaine

Discourse the situation of the place, and the manners and fashions of the people; with some other strange accidents, which for breuitie sake I did not certifie you of by my Letters sent from thence: but in this small Volume you shall see, from time to time, how euery thing hath been ordered, and performed in your businesse, and other affayres. All which, I hope, will be to your good liking, considering the place, and extremitie wee were in. So de∣siring GOD to blesse and prosper all your proceedings, I rest,
