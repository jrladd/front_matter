PHilostratus, a famous Phi∣losopher, wri∣ting somtimes to a Noble young man, v∣seth these words: Cauen∣dum esse ne temporis pre∣ciū sine fructu praetereat:

and Nazianzenus sayth, that our time beeing but short, and yet precious, is not carelesly, and neg∣ligently to be let slip; but that euerie man in his Place, and Calling, is to doe some good to the Countrie & Common∣wealth wherein hee was borne. For which cause, I haue taken some paines in the publicatiō of these Aphorisms; a worke ve∣ry needfull to be known, and vnderstood, by all sorts of people: and as Leonardus Fucchius wit∣nesseth, the best worke that euer Hip. compiled;

wishing that all Physici∣ans and Chirurgions, should carrie them in their bosoms: as it is re∣ported of Tully, concer∣ning the Comedies of Terence, tanquam in sinu portare, & to haue them at their fingers ends.
These Aphorismes were first of all written in the Greek, and since translated into Latine by many excellent and lear∣ned Physicians, and are dailie set forth with large Comments: which doth shew vnto vs their excel∣lencie and worthinesse. For a man may by them

preserue himselfe from sicknesse being in health, and being sick cure him∣selfe of sicknesse.
Accept therfore I pray you of these Labours, which I for the benefit of my Country haue vn∣dertaken to make com∣mon: which if you shall so do, I shall little esteem of the venemous teeth of anie carper. For, to you onely I present them as a token of my loue, & affection, which I beare vnto you: not for many fauours which I haue re∣ceiued from you, but for your many vertues and

loue of learning which is known to be in you. For (truly) I doe not knowe to whome bookes may better be presented, then to those that loue books, whereof I knowe you to haue manie; a great ritches to you, but little regarded with thousands of your rank. But I leaue to trouble you: and wi∣shing you as many hap∣py yeeres, as you haue vertues, I commit you to the Almightie his pro∣tection.
