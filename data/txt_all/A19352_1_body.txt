HOnourable friends:
I Number it amongst your many fauours, the protecting mine Idlenesse, for I can∣not confesse them labours: hee gest right (that sayde, I woulde bee glad to do

any thing that might be accep∣table to you, but not iudicious∣lie) to thinke these a fit present, for they are too light for your grauities, and too meane, for they are but papers: I had as lieue leaue gratefulnes to words spoken, as to written wordes, and these are no more, when I giue, or serue, or performe any of these offices to you, I would be glad, they should be armed with some other desartes, besides the Widdowes mite, or the tale of the King of Persia and the poore bodyes gifte of water: I am poore enough, but like not to come so neere begging, as to confesse it, nor to confesse it in this common apparrell of Epi∣stles, it hath beene worne by so

many as it may be infected, and then it were ill for you, and it will be ill for me, for I should borrowe it, and a poore estate, and a poore minde, and poore euery thing, would make me fit for nothing but a Spittle-house. No more worthy Ladyes, I will not binde you to the penance of reading further, I doubt not you will receiue all, hauing taken some, and doubt not you, but I will be euer the true obeyer of your commaundements.
