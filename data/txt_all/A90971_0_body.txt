Right Honourable,
GReatnesse and Goodnesse as they are infinitely in GOD, so in what degree they concentre in Man, they have a God like Divine influence and power to create Love, and Respect Boldnesse and Reverence in Persons Inferior; Your goodnesse hath made you Great, and your Greatnes (contra∣ry to common Experience) hath made you Good; and both these hath emboldened me humbly to solicite your Excellence, that this small Snapsacke, upon the strictest search of your dilligent Sentinels, and approbation thereof, may freely passe among your Com∣mon Souldiers: It is not my presumption to present your Excellence, with the broken Morsells Cram'd up therein, knowing that Curious
Carving fit for such a personage, becomes not a Snap sacke; and well Considering, both your plentifull Supply from your Spirituall Quarter∣masters, and mine owne insufficiency, being neither a Prophet, nor a Prophets Sonne: but the best of my hopes, is your
EXCELLENCIES permission of its free Portage; and could it procure the light of your countenance, and your Command of it's use as a taken hereof it would be to its Author like the filling of the poore Widdowes Vesslls for the Oyle in the Cruce, a greater reward, then ever
s look't for: howsoever, the Eternall God, and our succeeding Posterity shall call you blessed for your Love, Zeale, and Courage, in Gods and your Countries Cause: And that the Almighty may not onely make you a Moses, to lead his Israel
out of Egypt, and bring you to Mount Nebo in the sight of the good Land; But a Ioshuah to bring them into the Possession thereof, removing all Obstacles, supplying all wants, in your way; fill you withall the divine qualifications of the worthies of Israel; make you Strong and of good Courage, bee with you, never leave you nor forsake you, is the earnest Prayer, as of many thousands the Israelites of GOD, so amongst them, of your EXCELLENCIES most humbly Devoted, Vnworthy, whose Name should be Spel'd out,
