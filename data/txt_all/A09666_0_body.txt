ALL hayle, (Ã´ Tom Norman,)
I make thee, the Foreman
Of Pimlyco Iury:
You are chargde to enquire Sir,
What kindles that fire sir,
That burnes with such fury.
What fire doe you suppose sir?
Tis the fie of your Nose sir,
Which your Face beares about.
For (like to the fornace,
That glowes in the Glasse-house,)
It neuer goes out.
To keepe that hye Colour,
And make it looke fuller,
You shall die it in graine sir:
Of the Pimlyco Iuice,
If you get the right vse,
O how well will it staine sir.
I create you Sole Patron
Of the Pimlyco Squadron,
choose therefore Ale-cunners.
That now against Easter,
(If you purpose to feast there)
may be your fore-runners.
Hoyst then vp your Sayle sir,
For rich Pimlyco Ale sir,
That cullors like Roses,
With your Copper Seale, marke sir,
All those that Embarke sir,
For Pimlyco-Noses.
Vade, Vale, Caue ne titubes.
