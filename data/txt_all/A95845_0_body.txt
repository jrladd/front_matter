MAY it please your Grace, If I had an Offering, that might be any way Acceptable, There is none to whom it is so much due, as unto your Grace; And that because I drew my first Breath, and had my first Education, where the Ancient, and Noble Fa∣mily of Dowglas was the Grand Planet, Regnant in that Hemisphaere.

 Secondlie, Your Grace, by the Alwise Providence of GOD, and the Choice of our Great, and Gracious Protestant King, being made his Majesties High Com∣missioner to this Parliament: Stand in the place of Zerubbabel, in my Text, and are chiefly concerned to notice, What GOD calls for at your Hands, in Or∣der to the Building up the walls of Our second Temple, the foundations whereof have been wonder∣fullie and mercifullie laid some Years ago; And now, Your Grace, and this Honourable and High Court of Parliament, are again called to carrie on this begun Work, both by the Providence of GOD, that hath put a New Opportunitie in Your hands; And the Call of the Preached Word Awakening and stirring You up unto the Work. And O that Your Grace, and this Honour∣able Court, may give such a speedie Return to both these Calls as this Jewish Government did: For we may see from the first chapter of this prophesie of Hag∣gai, that within the space of three weeks & three daies; after this Prophets first sermon, they fell zealouslie to the work, and that with great courage and unani∣mitie; And also without anie further delay, or anie visible dissent among them, and whereas the stoutest of them before had no great mind to the work, now when alarmed by the Prophet, in the Name of the LORD, the verie weakest and most timorous, are forward, and bold to carrie it on. Thirdlie, And who could be so fit in all the Nation for this Work, as Your Grace; Being not onlie of so Noble a Descent, where Va∣lour
and Courage has been remarkablie for so manie Ages Connatural to the Family: (And let it not be lost in You, especiallie when called to lay it out on so Noble an Interprize, as the Propagation and Protection of Religion, Liberty and Property:) But also, being advanced to Represent the Chief Fa∣mily of the Kingdom, and whom GOD has blessed with a Goodlie Person, Excellent parts, a Numerous, Noble, and Hopeful Progenie: A Blessing that fitts You to speak with Your Enemies in the gate; And that Divine Hand, that has now promoted Your Grace, to so high a Trust, wherein Ye may do great things for the Advancement of CHRISTS Kingdom, will look for some proportionable Return: If the Great Land-LORD of the World expect a Rent from the meanest Cottage: What a large Revenue must he look for, from so great Families; For, to whom much is given, of them much will be required. Learn to pay this, and it will draw down not onlie Blessings on Your self, but on your Posterity. It was the Honour of Abrahams House, that from Father to Son,  many Generati∣ons they were Heirs of the same Promise. Heb: 11.9. O that there were such a Succession to be found in the House of the Nobilitie, and Gentrie of our Land: But alace Plentie abused, disposes to Sin, and Vice: And it is toe Ordinarie for the Greatest, and bravest Spirits, to think the Power of Religion, a base and mean thing, which taketh off from their Grandeure,
and Esteem among men, and that the strictness of it, is inglorious: But a Conjunction of Goodness and great∣ness together, is the most Lovelie and comfortable thing in the World; And greatness without Goodness will be a Tastless Cordial at the Long Run.
I have presumed to thrust these following Sheets un∣der Your Graees Patrocinie, being perswaded that a Favourable Smile from such a Potent Prince, will give them sufficient Protection; And although the Fab∣rick be mean, yet the Statliness of the Frontispiece may beget a Curiosity in many to look into it: hoping that your Grace will Pardon wherein I have presumed, and will Favourably accept of the smal token of my Sincere affection to your Grace, and those Noble Fami∣lies (for they that have not Gold must offer Goats Hair) I make Bold to subscribe myself,
