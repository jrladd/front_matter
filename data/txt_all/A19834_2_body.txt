Although the meaner fort (whose thoughts are plac'd
As in another region, far below
The Sphere of greatnesse) cannot rightly taste
What touch it hath, nor right her passions know:
Yet haue there aduentur'd to bestow
Words vpon griefe, as my griefes comprehend,
And made this great afflicted Ladie show
Out of my feelings, what she might haue pend.
And here the same, I bring forth, to attend
Vpon thy reuerent name, to liue with thee
Most vertuous Ladie, that vouch saf'st to lend
Eare to my notes, and comfort vnto me,
That one day may thine owne faire vertues spread
Be'ing secretarie now, but to the dead.
