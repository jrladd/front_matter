Madam,
IT is said of Jacob that when he came to be perswaded that his lost Joseph was alive, and a great man in the Land of Egypt, his spirit revived, he banisht his Sad∣ness and dried up his Tears, and joyfully resolv'd to go down to see his Dear Son. Madam, you have lost a Daughter, deservedly as dear, and your grief is too much propor∣tion'd to your loss: But I hope

you will also be comforted when you Consider that she is alive, and in a Happy Condition, that she dwells in place much better than Egypt, and is the Favorite of a greater Monarch than ever was Pha∣roh. I know you have resolv'd to go up and see her: and if she were here, I am well assur'd you could freely leave her to ascend to that blessed Place where she now expects you. Your Affliction therefore is now reduc'd only to this, That she is gone to Rest and Glory first, whereas you thought She must have followed you. This, Madam, is no great Evill, you had shew'd her the way to God, and she hath out-run you: but you will soon overtake her, and then forever you rejoyce and dwell together.

 I have writ, and sent your Ladi∣ship the inclosed Papers, not so much to honor the Memory of your most blessed Child, as to minister what comfort I could against the grief of her Absence, both to you and to your Honorable and most pi∣ous Mother: Not but that both your good Meditations do far exceed mine: but because in the case of Sorrow we generally want a Remembrancer, and, even our own Balsom applied by another hand is more healing and effectual.
Why I have herein closed a Ser∣mon which was never preached, nor never intended to be, was partly to divert your thoughts from your Grief by a comfortable Text of
 Holy Scripture; and partly to coun∣tenance the Method of the Oration that follows. I believe a plain Rela∣tion of the Life of your Excellent Daughter might have been better: The Rehearsal of her vertuous Acti∣ons was the best Praise she could re∣ceive: But I wanted particulars to compleat a full History: and the defects of my Memory and Infor∣mation were best supplyed and con∣cealed by the Rhetorical style of an Encomium.
What I have done, I wish it may be acceptable and someways service∣able to your Ladiship: and that you may not take it ill, if an un∣known hand indeavours to wipe the Tears from your eyes: for though
 unknown, yet the Author truly is, and accordingly desires to subscribe himself
