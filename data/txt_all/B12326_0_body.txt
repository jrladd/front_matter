RIGHT ILLVSTRIOVS AND WORTHILY HONOVRED LORD,
May it Please your Honor.
THe purity of this offring seeking an Altar in the world Consecrated on∣ly to Vertue. Pardon me if I have beene forc't to present it to your Honour, Since you are an Altar, or rather a Temple, where all vertues meete and all perfections are adored in a degrae of Glory and Admiration. And indeed I could not more me∣ritoriously dedicate this Booke then to you. It
 seemes that Heaven hath guided my pen in this attempt for to tender you by this present that which was already due to your Merits, and if you wonder that I should choose you out from our whole Nobility, to render you this respect of Homage and servitude to your Honour. The reason why I doe it is more pleasant and fairer then Curious, forasmuch as the Queene of the Amazones and the Divine Plato have wandred far behold meerely the shadow of Valour and Wise∣dome. Vnder the name of Alexander and of Socra∣tes, Can I not be touched with this Laudable desire to shew the World that I admire it really in you both in Soule and Body, for all do know that you are such a Lord as Alexander would have beene for a Monarch, I meane conquerour of a new World, Since that you conquer the glo∣ry of this, but onely for the love of the other, and that you are not onely one of the wise of Greece, but one of the wisest of this World, as having beene honourably educated in true Honours Schoole, whence it comes that you so abound in Noblenesse and Humility; Your greatnesse be∣ing so perfect, that after you have vanquisht your enemies, for your last Victory, you tryumph over your selfe. Who would not bee curious (most illustrious Lord) to see another Atlas bearing the heaven of the Empire upon his
 sholders, I strive that succeeding Ages may know, I have erected this in Honor of you, who are as loyall a friend to Vertue, as a fatall foe to Vice, I meane, an Altar of Eternity unto your Immortall praises, to the end that my Muses ashes may not blush with shame in the Grave, for depriving your illustrious Lordship (who is this Ages honor) of a Tribute so just, and of an Homage so necessary as this is. Nor do I set forth these truths for to praise you (my Lord) your Throne is elevated vpon another Olympus, where no Winde of Flatterers can reach unto. For al∣though I should say, that you are the best Lord that ever was, yet it would not be a full expressi∣on of your Goodnesse, because that you have Heavenly Guifts extraordinary, that exceeds Na∣ture: to compare you to all the Lords together that were illustrious, I should feare to offend their memories by an excesse of flattery, for none is ignorant how that you have putchast more Crownes then their ambitions could wish: and moreover, their Trophees were but of Lawrell, whose ashes are meerely imaginary. But your Glorious Honour, having alwayes had faire E∣ternity for object, the same Eternity shall bee its bounds and limits. To match you unto your selfe, I should feare yet to offend you, because I should be forced by the Comparison to repre∣sent
 unto my selfe an object to resemble you in all things, and I cannot have any other but im∣perfect Idea's, since that the brightnesse of your perfections, will rather dazle mine eyes, then enlighten them. What shall I say then most No∣ble Lord) to begin to speake of the least of your Noble qualities, if every one of them bee a De∣dale of Admiration, where I should enter into a Laborinth by the contemplating and publishing of your vertues: they are so rare and Divine, that the acutest Wits bee so farre from putting them in practice, that they cannot conceive the least Idea thereof: And from the continuall ad∣miration that I am in, beleeving how blest you are, and not knowing names fit for those great prayses due unto you, I will praise the resolu∣tion I have taken to carry along with me to my grave, the Honourable and just Title, of
