Christian Reader,
IN this changeable vicissitude of decaying time, and conti∣nuall succession of dying ages, there is nothing more certain then death, which is painted forth in the face of all living creatures, Man not excepted, the noblest of all, who in all sexes, rankes, and conditions must once die, and then enter into judgement. For this radicate moisture must drie up, and this naturall heat must grow cold, this soaring breath must flie up, and this surmounting soul must flit out of this earthly tabernacle, that it may returne unto its native soil, where it shal rest eternally in these hea∣venly mansions, stately habitations, and most pleasant paradise of God: Whereunto Christ the spoiler of prin∣cipalities and powers, our captain, fore∣runner

and perfect Saviour is victori∣ously and triumphantly gone before us, and now (according to his comfortable promise) is preparing a sure place, a royall palace, for all those, who with a godly sorrow groane under the unsup∣portable burthen of their grievous sins, and with assurance of faith beleeve in, and long after his saving and glorious appearance. So that we need not sorely and immoderately lament, for the ab∣sence of those whom we once dearly loved in this sower valley of tears and wearisome pilgrimage of many stati∣ons, every houre whereof is more dan∣gerous then another; Seeing they have joyfully and happily arrived at their journeys end, heaven, and at last are crowned with incomprehensible glory, strengthened with never▪fading im∣mortalitie, replenished with exquisite joyes of Gods favourable presence, and drowned with over-flowing pleasures at his right hand for evermore. These

points with many others in that kinde I have handled in this subsequent medi∣tation, first publickly delivered by me in a Sermon at the buriall of an honou∣rable Baron with his religious Ladie both laid in their grave at once, whose names of blessed memorie I conceal from thee, for such reasons as I thought good. Which meditation surely I had buried with them, or at least closed up in my study, if not the good opinion of conscionable and zealous hearers had raised it up again from the grave of ob∣livion, by their diligent search and le∣cture of manuscripts here and there dis∣persed far from my expectation & for∣mer intention. So that I was forced to review and inlarge the originall copie by the advice of my learned and much respected friends; such as reverend pre∣lats, doctours and pastours of our church, who have best skill in such mat∣ters of spirituall importance. For I have ever been of that minde, that every wise

man should make choice of some intire and trustie friends, who will be so far from flattering and fostering him with a self conceit, that by the contrary they will plainly admonish him of his er∣rours and infirmities, and give him sound and ripe counsel, when there is any businesse in hand that may especial∣ly concerne his credit and estimation. Amongst the which the operations which flow from the gifts of the minde have the first place: & seeing none, how capable so ever, is fully adorned with them, he should seek help of others. For God hath not given all gifts to every one; and he who is shorter-sighted then I, may see a spot in my face which I cannot see my self; and it were to be wished that there were more premedi∣tation in this age, so fertile of invention, wits and writs. Did the Greek oratours and Poets go to their Athenaeum, and the Latine to their Aedes palatinae, for to consult with the most learned of their

time about the divulgating of their mo∣numents; and we who have more di∣vine documents then ever any paganish Writer could dream of, bring forth so abortive fruits? As for my self, I will not answer for others, but if I had had no other to take counsel by, surely this lucubration should never have seen the face of the sun, or come unto the hands of these censuring and critick dayes: where there is nothing so good, but it hath its own carpers and enviers, no∣thing so bad, but it hath its own favo∣rers and embracers. In it I meddle not with curious and fruitlesse questions, new doctrines, dangerous tenents, ac∣companied with varietie of ostentative and sophisticate learning, and farded with the abused colours of pratling and adulterate eloquence, wherewith too many seek their own praise, by disgra∣cing their sincere profession, by venting their loftie presumption, by scandali∣zing their holy mother the church, by

defiling the white robe of Christs righ∣teousnesse, laid abroad to us in the gra∣vitie, integritie, simplicitie, and maje∣stie of divine scriptures, which ought to be the only square and rule of our acti∣ons, the touchstone of our speculations, and the soveraigne judge of all our con∣troversies. Which controversies alas, to the unspeakable grief of the better sort, to the pitifull seduction of some miscarried simple ones from the puritie of truth to the impuritie of errour, to the inevitable destruction of many ob∣durate ones to fearfull and damnable inconveniences, what by sects, schismes and heresies this long time ago, what by oppressions, murthers, massa∣cres, as bloudy consequences, have trou∣bled the peace of this Christian world. Neither did I suffer this sermon to come to open light, because it was my own brood, and first issue upon that grave purpose, which requireth moe years, deeper learning, sounder judge∣ment,

longer experience, then I, a youth, can attain to for the present, but be∣cause of two reasons which I adde to the former: The first is, because there is no meditation more familiar to me then that of death: Out of the countrie, many thousands did fall on every side of me: and in my countrie, since my ad∣mission to this painfull and dreadfull cure of souls, one speciall point of my charge is to visit those good Christians (over whom I watch) at their last fare∣well to this world, that I may render a joyfull and comfortable accompt of them to my Master the great shepheard of the flock. The second reason is, be∣cause of two men, whom I highly ho∣noured during their pilgrimage here; The one was a principall nobleman of my paroch, who in his journey to hea∣ven took such pleasure in reading this meditation, that he himself did dict it to one of his servants a little before his death. And I dare say, without flatterie,

that his generous and religious soul did even in this life in a singular man∣ner taste of the glorie to come. O what divine sentences! O what comfortable speeches did he utter to us who attended on him! O what ravishing contemplati∣ons and private soliloquies had his soul with God on his death-bed! These, as so many antidotes, preservatives & corro∣boratives he used against that last ago∣ny: By these, as so many scales he climb∣ed up to the heavens. The other was my dear & honourable father, who before his departure out of this mortall life de∣lighted much in reading, hearing & me∣ditating on this discourse, and hoping that others should get instruction, dire∣ction and consolation thereby, com∣manded me to publish it. So that I could not disobey him, who was Gods instru∣ment to bring me unto this world, to train me up in the fear of the Lord, and who both in, and out of the country, did prosecute me with his tender & fatherly

affection in my painful travels, and dan∣gerous expeditions for the golden fleece of vertue, & whose life was a clear mir∣rour of Christian charity, yea above his power oftentimes, which he did recom∣mend to his children: for the Lord bles∣sed him with abundance to the end, and in the end crowned his former favours with a pleasant and peaceable death, which he oft craved at Gods hands, and which was a matter of greater content∣ment to me, then if he had left me heire of whole territories, which with the rest of the toyes of this perishing world have but transitorie joyes, like clouds rising in the morning, but dissolving ere night without any memorie of them at all. Neverthelesse, honourable birth, good education, the patterne of worthy acts, and the immortall fame of renow∣ned ancestors, either in church or poli∣cy, communicated to the emulous po∣steritie for imitation, is not the least portion of humane inheritance: and he

who follows their famous examples, ingraven with letters of gold in chests of cedar, or in tables of marble, in the never-decaying temple of sacred me∣mory; he (I say) is not only in the way to worldly honour and preferment, but al∣so their footsteps lead him from grace to glorie, which is the most precious purchase a Christian can acquire. With∣out the which all is but dung and drosse: for one drachme of goodnesse is better then a whole world of great∣nesse; even as a little pearle is of greater worth, then a big rock of flint; or as the sun is higher esteemed then the whole body of the firmament spangled with stars, every one striving with another in beautie.
To be short then, it is no inbred opi∣nion of my self, who am conscious of many infirmities in this body of death, that maketh me to acquaint thee (O Christian Reader) with this funerall meditation, which perhaps may live

when I am dead. In the mean time I wish it may teach thee, me, and other mor∣tall men, our Christian duety in this point, rest with us familiarly at home, warne us in our journey, remember us of our present mortalitie, guard us against our last enemie, prepare us for that future immortalitie and full happi∣nesse of soul and body conquered to us by the victorious death, and meritori∣ous passion of the only son of God our only Saviour: In whom I rest ever,
