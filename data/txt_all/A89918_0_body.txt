My Lord, and Gentlemen,
THe ensuing Problemes are a part of those enquiries, which the Writer of them thought necessary for him to make, before he engaged in the above mentioned Warre: although he had observed that thousands made no bones, to declare themselves on the one side, and on the other, before either had given any account to the world, of the grounds of their having taken up Armes; and so before it was possible for any man to judge, whether side had the better of the Cause: And though after this he had yet further observed, by discoursing

with sundry persons of all rankes, and qualities, en∣gaged on both sides, that not one of an hundred of them, could tell what the quarrell between them was; nor one of a thousand state it aright. Whether you, my Lord, Aldermen, and Common-Councel men, were more carefull to inform your understandings of the truth of these, and other generall Problemes, and to make ap∣plication of them to the particular case, or matter of fact, and right in question, before you enclined your wills, either singly, or in Body to make choyce of the part you have taken, and given example to others to take in that great action, wherein your part hath been so great, and upon what motives you took it, God knowes, and you can tell. If you were not, it doth the more import you to put these Questions home to your consciences now, before those everlasting Books be sealed up by death, as they will be opened when we must all come to judgement. And what I take the liberty to say to you, I here aske leave in all humi∣lity to wish that all other men, in City and Coun∣trey, whom it may concerne, would say, and say in earnest to themselves, The Kings most Excellent Majesty and the Lord and Commons now, and heretofore, assembled in this Parliament, not except∣ed; of whose pardon for this so high presumption, I shall not doubt when I have made this sincere

profession: That it is not my intention in making this most humble Request, or in publishing these Pro∣blemes to reflect any otherwise upon either of their Proceedings, then as in reference to the meanes of advancing a Peace between them, and with Him, whose displeasure neither of them can more en∣dure then I can theirs. I humbly beseech all others in∣to whose hands this Paper may come, to read it to the same end, and with the same temper of spirit one to∣wards another, that I beare in my breast towards all, and every one of them. And then perhaps it may not be impossible, that all parties interessed, and engaged in the late warre in any fashion, may find it easier to ob∣serve an errour in their neighbours reckonning, then to passe their own: nor that thereupon they may be de∣sirous of the leasure of a cessation of Armes for the perfecting of their accounts, before they be called for at their day, or at His, who is coming, and at the doore to keep the great Audit of the whole world: nor that in fine they may all conclude, it is much safer to seek out meanes to expiate the blood that hath been already spilt in so nice a quarrell, then to run the danger of drawing the guilt of any more upon themselves, and their posterity: nor that after every of us shall be inclined to forgive one another, pray for one another, and to beare one anothers burdens, God may be enclined

to forgive us all, to heare our prayers to remove all our burdens, and to give us the grace when we have first made our peace with him, at last to be at peace againe one with another. Which through the help of his Spirit hath been, and shall be a part of his daily prayer who by his grace is unfaynedly desirous to live and dy a good subject, a good Englishman, and a good Christian, and who is, as he here subscribeth himselfe,
My Lord

12. August. 1648.
