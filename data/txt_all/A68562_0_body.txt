Right Worshipfull and most famous Merchants:
THe hard adventure my poore selfe and fellowes under∣went in your Worships ser∣vice, is a great deale plea∣santer for others to reade, than it was for us to endure. How ever hard, wee have now endured it; and if ever after∣ages
shall speake of it, (as the world still doth of the Dutch-mens hard Winter in nova Zembla:) thus much of the Voyage shall redound to your honours, that it was done by your Servants. This may also returne to our Countreys good; That if the first inhabi∣ting of a Countrey by a Princes Subiects (which is the King of Spaines best title to his Indyes) doth take possession of it for their So∣veraigne: Then is Green-land by a second right taken livery and Seisin of, for his Maje∣sties use; his Subiects being the first that ever did (and I beleeve the last that ever will) in∣habite there. Many a rich returne may your Worships in generall, and the brave Adven∣turers in particular receive from this and all other places: and may your Servants be ever hereafter, warned to take heede by our harmes. God send your Worships long life, and much honour, and sufficient wealth, to maintaine both. This is the hearty prayer of your Worships poore servant
