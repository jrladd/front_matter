MOST GRATIOVS AND SOVERAIGNE LADIE.
The authour of this Treatise, eldest sonne by descent, & heire by na∣ture of the family of that vvorthy Martyr, vvhose life is described in

it: had he liued himselfe to haue set it forth to the vievv of Christian eies, vvould not haue thought vpon any other patron and pro∣tectour to dedicate it vnto, then your most excellēt Maiestie. For he vvas most constantly affected alvvayes to the French Nation and crovvne, next after the duti∣full obedience vvhich he ought to his ovvne natural Lord and so∣ueraigne. And this his affection did he manifest in all occasions, but especiallie in the treatie of the happie mariage of your highnes, vvith the King our soueraigne Lord and maister; Assembling

at his ovvne costes and charges, vvith vnvvearied industrie all the English persons of note and esteeme, that then vvere in and about Rome, & vvith thē all, (as the mouth of thē all) supplicating to his Holines for the dispatch of this most hope-full and happie contract, yeelding such reasons for the effecting thereof, as highlie pleased the chiefe Pastour of the Church vnder Christ our Saui∣our. The same affection did he te∣stifie sufficiently in the last period of his life, leauing his bodie to be buried in the French church at

Rome vvhere vvith great contēr of the French Nobilitie it lieth interred.
This being the affection of the author of this treatise I should much vvronge his memorie, if these labours of his should be of∣fred to the patronage of anie other then of your roiall Maiestie. The glorious Martyr himselfe, demāds likevvise, that his life should be read vnder your Maiesties prote∣ction: since he lost his life in this vvorld (to gaine it in the next) in defence of an innocent stranger Queene (for reasons not to be mētioned by vs) debarred from

her lavvfull bed. Although (God be praised and magnified therefore) the heauens haue rained such graces vpon your Maiestie, that there neuer can happen any such causes of defence; your glorious Hus∣band and Lord, our soueraigne King so dearlie affecting you, and the hope-full yssue (the chiefest bond of matrimonial loue) so povverfully knitting your hearts together, and your gratious Maiesties goodnes, virtues, and debonnaire discre∣tion so recommending you to him first, and then to all his true

loyall subiects of this great vni∣ted Monarchie; That vve may vndoubtedlie expect from al∣mightie God a long and pros∣perous enioyāce of your joint∣gouerment, and a glorious race of happie successours to this crovvne frō your royall loines; vvhich happines, and heauen after long prosperitie on earth, vpon my knees I vvish vnto your royall grace; remaining for euer,
