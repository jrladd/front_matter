RIght worship∣full, although it be much a∣gainst my disposition,
 who preach so often, to commit any one Ser∣mon to the publike view, especially this, whereof I haue as meane conceit as of the rest ordinarily de∣liuered. Notwithstan∣ding, if it may giue any satisfaction, I doe humbly intreat, that you would be pleased to accept of so small a testimonie of my greater thankefulnesse. To whom as I acknow∣ledge
 my selfe much obliged, so shall I euer be readie to render a farre greater signifi∣cation of my dutie. And albeit this sub∣iect deserueth to bee amplified much more then my leasure in the throng of other busi∣nesse would at this time permit: yet vn∣derstanding of a ru∣mour spread, as if vpon conference with some, I should beginne
 to alter my minde; I haue chosen rather to set it downe word for word as it was at that time vttered, then to enlarge any branch of it. I laboured most to deliuer the naked truth in this point, without ornament of speech: such nakednesse is ne∣uer to bee ashamed. Thus desiring Almigh∣tie God that the sim∣ple truth may so worke vpon the consciences
 of euery one for the establishing of peace, order, and gouernment amongst vs, that we may haue a most ten∣der care of all such Oathes from that Oath of Allegeance to his Maiestie, to the Oathes taken by the meanest Church-Wardens in our parishes: I doe humbly commend you in my praiers to the gratious protection of the Almightie.

From S. Stephens Walbrooke, Lon∣don. May 25. 1615.
