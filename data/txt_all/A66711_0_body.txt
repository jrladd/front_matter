WORTHY SIR,
YOu cannot be more surprised to see those Notes made publick, than I was (being then so wholly a stranger to you) by your desi∣ring me to perform that service which occasioned their composure. And though you us'd a civil Apology, for giving me so short a warning for
so solemn an appearance, I shall trouble you and the world with none, for yield∣ing to their importunity who drew them from me.
I confess an obvious objection oc∣curred, which would have resisted all their entreaties, had I esteemed so low a consideration, as my own reputation, fit to be put into the balance against the good, I was made believe, they may do, viz. lest the acceptance they obtain'd, when transiently delivered to the ear, they should lose, when expo∣sed to the severer censure of the Eye. It being no unusual thing for Dis∣courses to sink, when divested of the advantage of being spoken with some quickness, warmth, and pa∣thos. But if they meet with com∣mon candour in the Reader, which I request, and modestly expect, I hope they may be useful. However, his ex∣pence will be so little, either of mo∣ney or time, that a small charity may excuse his disappointment, if any hap∣pen.

I have, Sir, inscribed your name up∣on them, as a testimony of my re∣spects, the omission of which would have been so indecent, that I hope it will neither by your self, nor others, be imputed as a fault, to
Worthy Sir,

July 17, 1678.
