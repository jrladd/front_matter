LIKE A STORME-beaten-ship,
with many vnfor∣tunate
conflicts (in my long-some
journeyes) here and there haue I
still beene tossed, till now at last
I haue arriued to the safe harborie of your Lord∣ships
favour: being sore fatigated in my trou∣blesome
trauailes, I am very eagerly willing to
be comforted with the rare fruites of your Ho∣nours
admired Engine, who with a most gene∣rous
spirit, can temper thy greatnes with benig∣nitie,
thy Majestie with meekenesse, thy Heroy∣ick
minde with courtesie, thy Noble hand with
liberalitie, and thy Herculian-heart with cle∣mencie,
such is the inestimable ritches (of thy re∣nowned

these my Labours as the true tributarie

Humorous world, the strange alterations of
Time, and the inconstant wauering of my euer∣changing
Fortune, will afforde mee no other
Subject, it may truly be saide, Fortuna vi∣trea
est, quae cum splendet frangitur. My
peregrinations enlarged my curiositie, my soul∣diers
estate promised to preferre mee, and the
smiles of Court stuffed my braines with manie
idle suppositions. Heere abruptly must I needes
breake off, fearing least the great occasion of
this discourse, make mee forget my selfe, and be∣come
tedious in reckoning vp my losse of Time.
So in my neuer-ending-loue, I end, wishing your
Lordships valour, good fortune, your estate

all happinesse, and that your Honours discre∣tion
may sepulchrise this boldnesse of
