RIGHT noble Lady, whose rare vertues, the wise no lesse honour, then the learned admire, and the honest ferue: how shall I, the abiect of fortune, vnto the obiect of honour, presume to offer so simple a present, as the poeticall discourse of a poore pilgrimes trauaile? I know not how, but, with falling at the feete of your fauour, to craue pardon for my imperfection: who hath redde of the Duchesse of Vrbina, may saie, the Italians wrote wel: but who knowes the Countesse of Penbrooke, I thinke hath cause to write better:  if she had many followers? haue not you mo ser∣uants▪ and if they were so mindfull of their fauours▪ shall we be forgetfull of our dueties? no, I am assured, that some are not ignorant of your worth, which will not be idle in your seruice: that will make a title, but a tittle, where a line shall put downe a letter: and if shee haue receiued her right in remembrance, you must not haue wrong in being forgotten: if shee were the honour of witte, you are the comfort of discretion, if shee were the fauourer of learning, you are the mainteiner of Arte, and if she had the beauty of Nature, you beautifie Nature, with the blessing of the spirite: and in summe, if she had any true perfection to be spoken of, you haue many mo truly to be writtē of: which amōg all, the least able to iudge of, and of all, the very least worthy, in your fauour to write of, your poore vnworthy named poet, who by the indiscretion of his youth, the malice of enuy, and the disgrace of ingratitude, had vtterly perished (had not the had of your honor reuiued the hart of humility) will not so bury in the graue of obliuion, but that your deserued fame, shall so sounde in the eares of ho∣nourable hearts, that, if I spake, more then I maie, the Iudgement of the wise, and the tongues of the learned, I know will no lesse clecre me of flattery, then wish, a minde of more perfection, to be emploied in your seruice: to conclude, I beseech you so sauour my labour, as to looke on the worke, thinke not of the ruines of Troie, but helpe to builde vp the walles of Ierusalem▪ which figure▪ if it seeme obscure, let the poore pilgrime, that seeketh Paradise, finde heauen

the better by your fauour: to the comfort of which, committing vnder heauen, the hope of my heartes happinesse, with humble pray∣er, for your eternall prosperitie, I rest in no lesse bounden duety, then humble seruice.
