HAving by the space of almost forty years lived comfortably together, and God ha∣ving been pleased to give us Children and a Posterity, to whom (instead of Plenty which they might have expected I might have left unto them) I am now like to leave nothing but the same want and poverty which is already befallen my self; I have sent unto you and them the best Legacy that I can think of, to leave amongst you, which is a Discourse consisting of two Parts. In the first, the Motives of Honour, Loyalty, and Religion are set down, which deterred my Conscience from taking Armes against the King: In the second, I endeavour a Vindication of my Honour and Innocency from that severe and injurious Sentence of Exception of the Houses, whereby they have declared me a Delinquent, that must not expect Pardon or Mercy, either in point of Fortune, or of Life, which must of necessity insinuate me unto the World, and unto Po∣sterity, to have been a Malefactor of a more hgh and hor∣rid Nature, than the Generality of those that have served the King in this War,
I wish you and they may have as much Comfort in the reading of it, as I had in the writing of it, which I believe to have been greater (notwithstanding my Banishment and Want in my old Age) than hath remained in the Breast of any of those that have made us so miserable.
Although you may communicate it with your Children and Family, and near Friends; yet I would not have it ge∣nerally divulged, or made publike: for although it com∣meth to you in Print, That is only because I wanted the means of transcribing it, and I found here a great Conve∣niency of Printing it; And it is not the more divulged thereby, for that there is not any one Copy thereof, but such as remain in my hands; And this unto you is the only one that I have yet parted with.
The last request you made unto me with Tears, when I departed from you, and left the kingdom, was, That I would set down in writing mine own Proceeding, and the unavoidableness and Iustifiableness of the Cause, for which we have suffered, and whereof I had so often discoursed unto you. And truly, such hath been in all kinds your great Deserving from me, That I have taken this pains chiefly for your Satisfaction, as I should do much more in any thing that I should judge might be to your Comfort, and that might remain as a Testimony of my Kindness, Affection, and Value of you.
