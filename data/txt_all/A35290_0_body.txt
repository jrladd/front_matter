My Lord,
THis poor Off-spring of my va∣cant
hours, having slept a∣while
in the shades of obscu∣rity
and silence, I knew not
when it might better walk abroad, and
take the Air of popular censure, than in
the Sun-shine of your Lordship Patro∣nage.
I am very sensible of the mean∣ness
of the Subject (being wholly ficti∣tious)
and the poverty of its dress; and
none can think more contemptibly of
it than my self: I was scarce twenty
years of Age when I fancyed it, and
therefore it must needs want those mas∣culine
conceits as do violence to mens
understandings. I am not ignorant
that things of this nature are onely

to ease and supple a Brain that hath
long bin in the Rack of severer Studies:
and I am afraid this will hardly be pre∣ferred
to so noble a use, since a lofty In∣tellect
that hath been Airing its Wings
in clear and sublime Meditations, will
hardly stoop to Bath in the puddle of
these low and sordid Fancies. If
throughout the whole Utopia, there be
an expression, or a person whose Cha∣racter
or Passion may deserve a transi∣ent
glance from your eye, it hath com∣menced
a degree of Honor above my
expectations. And I shall esteem my
self highly and generously rewarded, if
I may hereby in any degree merit the
title of,
My Lord,
Your Lordships most
humble, and most
obedient servant,
