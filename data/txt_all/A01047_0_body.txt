MY LORD:
OVt of the darknesse of a former Age, (enlighten'd by a late, both learned, and an honourable pen) I haue endevoured, to personate a great Attempt, and in It, a grea∣ter Daunger. In other Labour's, you may reade Actions of Antiquitie discourst; In This Abridgement, finde the Actors themselues discoursing: in some kinde, practiz'd as well What to speake; as speaking Why to doe. Your op is a most competent Iudge, in expressions of

such credit; commissioned by your knowne A∣bilitie n examining; and enabled by your know∣ledge in determining, the monuments of Time. Eminent Titles, may indeed informe, who, their owners are, not often what: To your's, the addi∣tion of that information, in BOTH, cannot in a∣ny application be observ'd flattery; the Authori∣tie being established by TRVTH. I can onely acknowledge, the errours in writing, mine owne; the worthinesse of the Subject written, being a per∣fection in the Story, and of It. The custome of your Lops. entertainements (even to Strangers) is, rather an Example, than a Fashion: in which con∣sideration, I dare not professe a curiositie; but am onely studious, that your Lop will please, amongst such as best honour your Goodnesse, to admit into your noble construction
