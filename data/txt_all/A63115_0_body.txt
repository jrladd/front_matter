Qui capit ille facit.
WHen I consider your great Zeal to your Country, how much you have expos'd your selves for its Service, and how little you have improved your own Fortunes, I think it is but Justice to your Merits to make your Encomiums the Preface to the following Discourse. 'Tis you that have abated the Pride, and reduced the Luxury of the Kingdom: You have been the Physicians and Divines of the Commonwealth, by purging it of that Dross and Dung, which corrupts the Minds, and destroys the Souls of Men. You have convinced us that there is no Safety in Counsellors, nor Trust to be put in Ships under your Conduct.
You have clear'd the Seas, not of Pyrats, but of our own Merchants, and by that means have made our Prisons as so many Store-houses to replenish your Troops. In fine, to use the Expression of the Psalmist, Your Hearts are unâˆ£searchable for Wisdom, and there is no finding out your Understanding. When I consider all this, and

compare your Merits with your Preferments, how you came by them, and your behaviour in them, I cannot but think a Standing Army a Collateral Security to your Title to them, and therefore must commend your Policy in promoting it. For by these Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice. These will be our Magistrates, who will not bear the Sword in vain. These, like the Sons of Aaron, will wear their Urim and Thummim on their Backs and Breasts, and will be our Priests, who will hew the Sinners to pieces, as Samuel did Agag before the Lord in Gilgal. By these you will be able to teach us Passive Obedience, as Men having Authority, and not as the Scribes. You will have your Reasons in your Hands against resisting the higher Powers, and will prove your Jus Divinum by the Sword of the Lord and of Gideon.
