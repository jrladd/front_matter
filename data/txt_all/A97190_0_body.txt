Madam,
SINCE they who may justly chal∣lenge those admired Qualities, which are become the common
Forms of a Dedica∣tion, are generally dis∣pleased with Addresses of that nature; I shall
omit that undisputed Title you have to such Excellencies, and beg
 leave to inform the World, how much it is indebted to you for a just Example of what
Respect we ought to pay to the Memory of our De∣ceased Friends: E∣specially when they were
adorned with all those Endowments, which were so con∣spicuous in Your Ex∣cellent Brother: Who
besides those Accom∣plishments wch com∣manded
 an Universal Esteem, join'd the Affection of a Friend to that of so near a
Relation: which makes it difficult to determine whether he deserv'd, or you ex∣prest the
greater Sor∣row. It was my fre∣quent Reflection up∣on this, that first mov'd me to this At∣tempt;
which how∣ever mean in it self, will have enough to
 recommend it, if hon∣our'd with your Pro∣tection: Which I the more confidently
pre∣sume upon, since that Relation it bears to you (as you have had the justest Cause of
Grief, have shewn the most tender Sense of it, and yet none ever more religiously
Con∣quer'd it) makes it wholly yours. I design not, MADAM, by this Discourse to Accuse
 you of any Neglect, but only to shew what you have Practic'd, and by Copying out
your Behaviour teach others their Duty. I am sensible by the Advantage of so Emi∣nent a
Pattern, much more might be said upon the Subject, and that too, much bet∣ter treated of: But if
this rude and un∣polisht Essay may ob¦tain the Happiness of
 being receiv'd as a Te∣stimony of my Grati∣tude, for the frequent Obligations both
His and Your Favours have laid upon me, all other Defects will be abundantly sup∣ply'd, and I
shall at∣tain the chief End and Honour I pro∣pos'd by it, of being Esteem'd
MADAM;
