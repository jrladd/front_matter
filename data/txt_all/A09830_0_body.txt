MAdame: it were in
vaine for mee to seeke
to embelish your chri∣stian
graces by a dead
letter: Seeing they are
most lively, & giue a
farre greater lustre in
your selfe, where God
hath planted them, then can be expressed by
the blunt & vnlearned Pen of a Souldier. But
seeing God hath made them so transparent, &
hath kindled in you so holy a flame of loue and
zeale vnto the true & onely worship of his name:

Me thinkes this plaine translation of mine, not
for any worth that is in me, but for the subiects
sake, hath found out a fitt Patronesse, whose per∣son
& practize affordetth a reall confutation of
that superstition which is here vnmasked,
And so much the more presuming vpon your
Ladiships favour & gentle acceptance: in regard
I dedicated this same Authours former refutati∣on
vpon the invocation of Saincts, vnto my ho∣norable
Lord your husband; so that now, as God
hath made you one, I may make you both equally
interressed in this one subiect (though diversly
handled) striving for that honour, which is due
vnto his name.
These Popish iuglings cannot bee vnknowne
to your Ladiship, seeing the vnholy blood of Hales
(which did cleere & thicken as the Pilgrims purse
was light or heavie) is of your owne house, & of
so fresh remembrance, whereby your honourable
Auncestours did learne to detest such divelish
cousenage, as the burned bones of your most wor∣thy
Granfather did long agoe witnesse, to all the
worlde.
Moreover, (Madame) there are also some
abhomiations in this disputation, which I know
made my Authors pen to tremble in copying
of them out, and mine to quake in translating
them: others againe, which may drawe from
your Ladiship a chast smile and a modest blush:

but let the shame light vpon their heads, who are
the authors thereof: & the more they blaspheme
and dishonour our blessed God & Saviour, the
more let vs worship and honour him, and learne
as Bees to sucke honey from banefull weedes, or as
cunning Physicians to extract Antidotes from
poyson, since God turneth the very abhominati∣ons
& execrations of the wicked, as exsamples
for the good & edification of his children.
Here with (Madame) as with the chiefe
end of this labour I ende, beseeching God to blesse
my honourable Lord and you, with all happi∣nesse
and ioy in this world, and euerlasting feli∣city
and blisse in the world to come. From our
Garnison of Dordrecht this 18. of October.
1611.
