Most gracious Soueraigne,
IT was the coun∣sell of Aristides, . To wor∣ship GOD with consecration of Temples, but to honour Noble

personages with Dedication of bookes: following this aduice, I beganne not long since the descri∣ption of Great Britaines Monar∣chy in three Columnes, Histori∣call, Panegyricall, and Prophy∣lacticall; intending thereby to stir vp your leige people to a religious admiration of Gods wonderfull Prouidence in vniting these two famous Kingdomes into one Mo∣narchy; to a iust acknowledge∣ment of our exceeding happinesse therein: as also to an vnanimous desire, and endeauour for the ab∣solute Vnion and perpetuall pre∣seruation thereof. In the meane time Heauen it selfe offered a faire occasion to manifest the feruent zeale long smothered in my loyall

breast towards your MAIESTY, the late strange, and admirable Comet, which hath filled so ma∣ny eies with his rayes, and their thoughts with Meteors, or doubts. An Astronomicall de∣scription whereof delineated in a celestiall Planisphere, with some briefe touches in the Progno∣stickes, and Morall applications thereof, I humbly offer to your princely Excellence, beseeching you to proiect the beames of your sweete, and gracious in∣fluence both on it, and the Authour; that, as the glorious Sunne of Heauen with his re∣splendence enlightned this (o∣therwise obscure) Comet: So your MAIESTIE our terresti∣all

all Phaebus would vouchsafe to illustrate
