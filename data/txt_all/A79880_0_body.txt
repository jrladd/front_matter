SIRS,
SO long as the enmity lasteth, betwixt the seed of the woman and the Serpent, so long must the Godly, (though mirrours of piety and grace) be subject to wicked mens unjust molestation, for the Just shineth, as lights in the midst of a crooked Generation; and the tongues of wicked men (the lying off-spring of the father of lyes) are un∣der such command of Satan, to act this restlesse malice against the truth and holy Religion, both in Doctrine and practise, that Godly men cannot expect to have their names free from reproa∣ches.
It is no wonder then, that I find your names, (worthy and ever Honoured Friends) which (no doubt) are written in the book of life, and whom good men honour, abused upon Record, by one of Satans Emissaries, who seeketh to bring about the bad cause he hath in handling, by such bad and wicked means, as shamefull lyes. The which, the lesse ground and colour of truth they have, with the more clamor and impudency, he thrusteth forward into the world, endeavouring thereby (as if he were the first born of Satan) without all shame and fear, to darken the bright and shining light of your clean and unspotted Conversations.

That Lesson which the Devil taught his apt Scholar Machiavel (Calumniare audacter aliquid sultem haerebit) he hath perfectly learned; by confidently belying you, he hopes to fling some dirt of reproach in your faces, and that not only, because ye run not with him and his followers, but also, to make others to run wih them, to the same excesse of riot, of licentious Doctrines and practises, against the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints.
What advantage Satan hath gotten in this age, as well as in other ages, by the strength of Lyes, to bring Gods Truths and our Holy Religion into suspition and disgrace, may be seen by the easie entrance that Calumnies make in the corrupt minds of men of these times, who will hardly be dispossessed of such preju∣dice.
Faction and Schisme, being maintained by works of darknesse, and unconscionable deceits, the multitude are ready to drink in the venome thereof out of a Cup of Lyes, the which they greedi∣ly catch, and swallow down, though to the poysoning of their soules.
It hath amazed me to consider how a lying Pamphlet will amaze the poore ignorant people of the Land, nay put men of more setled judgements at a stand; Nay did I not know the pro∣bate of it, by ocular and experimental demonstrations, I could never have brought my understanding to beleeve, that such groundlesse lyes, as this Pamphlet contains (called Strange and rue Newes from Gloucestershire) should have such a vent of be∣lief in the hearts of men as they have.
Alas! That ever men in their wits, should believe such un∣truths, and yet they do; Though the wonders expressed therein be Lying-Wonders; and that,
First, In their Original, as proceeding from the Father of lyes.
Secondly, In their matter being bottomlesse and grosse falsi∣ties.
Thirdly, In their end, which is lying and seduction: Yet the Current of them are so swift and dangerous, as greatly needeth to be stopt by some Sluce of contradiction.
I therefore having some experimental knowledge of you (my
ever Honoured Friends) and the spreading infection of these lyes, which are scattered to eclipse your worthes, and to advance sepa∣ration, thought it my duty to stop the mouth of this Detractor, who with impudent face, and seared conscience, hath out-faced the world, by publishing to the world this Short and sudden Narra∣tive; being a plaine refutation of the Lyes therein contained, and a right demonstration of the truth of the matter, not only, to un∣deceive deluded poor souls, by acquainting them with the subtil∣ty of these Impostors, and to preserve others out of the snares of such Serpents; but to preserve also the preciousnesse of your names in the hearts of all good men, which the Relator setteth up as Buts to shoot his lying Arrows against, thinking thereby to wound your unblemished Reputations; that those honoured names of yours, which like a precious Oyntment doth not only persume your own houses, nay your Town of Fairford, but sendeth forth a sweet savor to all that know you, or ever heard of you, might not be (like the precious Oyntment of the Apothecary) corrupted with any dead Flies of slanderous, and lying reports.
And if I may be thought of you to presume too much herein, I beg both your pardons, because this action proceedeth meerly from the passion of love; And all such actions (according to the Lawyers position) are not lyable to Law, at least pardonable in respects.
Pardon therefore I humbly beseech you, this action of mine, which proceedeth from the love I owe to God, whose Glory I ought to advance; To the Church in general, of which I am a Member; to my Mother Church of England, of which I am a du∣tiful Son, to your Town of Fairford, as having spent some time in the execution of my Ministerial Office therein; to your selves and relations, whose Christian stedfast walking through these un∣setled times, I have with much comfort and benefit been an ob∣server, whose stedfast, pure, and holy conversation in these delu∣ding times, have not only strengthned your own assurances for the hope of happinesse, but have been props to them that live under you, dwell by you, and converse with you, to keep them from Apostacy, and Spurs to further their Christian race, provoking them by your pious examples, to presse the more towards the same glorious marke.
