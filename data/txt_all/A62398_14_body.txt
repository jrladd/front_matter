WHose former Genealogie is already spoken,
The Fable of the Golden Fleece began,

Because Sheep did yeeld such store of Gold to Men,
For he that hath great store of VVoolly Fleeces,
May when he pleases, have store of Golden Pieces;
Honest Iames Scot of Sheils-wood,
Whose like there is not many,
Whose love and piety doth feed and help so many;
It is no doubt, but these good deeds of his,
Will help to lift his Soul to endless bless.
Of his Genealogie I will speak no more,
Because his Brother Grass-yards is set down before;
I hope Iasons Fleece shall never from him flee,
Because he is inclin'd to Hospitality.
