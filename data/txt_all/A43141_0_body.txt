WHat was by me intended onely for your bearing, is now at the re∣quest of many of you, exposed to publike reading. Wherein, as I have yeelded to satisfie your desire, even against mine owne liking, so I trust, you will satisfie mine, in testifying as occasion serves, how unwillingly I was perswaded to it. Not that I envie the publike benefit, or (hun to have knowne to all Congregations, what I deliver
in one; but that so many excellent works in this kind already extant, makes mee assured there is little need of mine, nor can I thinke these poore weekly labours in any sort meet for so generall a view as they are now offered to; nor can I see in them wherefore they should be preferred before, other of their fellowes: yet lest I should be wan∣ting in any thing that might further your spiri∣tuall proficiencie, I have denied mine own judge∣ment to serve yours, beseeching Almightie God it may do that good to you and all Readers, which you beleve, and I earnestly pray for.
