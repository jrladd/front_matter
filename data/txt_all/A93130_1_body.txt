MADAM,
THis following Discourse of the Holy Ghost, his im∣pressions and workings on the soul of man, was first intended only for private satisfaction to your Ladyships pious desires; That being well grounded in the Orthodox Doctrine, and having a right under∣standing of the true Spirit of God, it might be as an impregnable Bulwark against so many suggestions and temp∣tations of the false and deceitful spi∣rit: For the minde of man, being either devoid of the Spirit of Grace




and Holiness; or else of a right un∣derstanding of the things of Gods Spirit, who is the Fountain both of Grace and Truth; is too apt and prone to close with the suggestions of the evill spirit, who is the author and promoter of sinfulness and error: Never Age produc't so many spiri∣tual Monsters, as this wherein we live. And I think few parts of England be so much infected with them, as these Northern parts be. They were very impudent and daring, when they ad∣ventured to tempt your vertuous minde, and by inticing words to allure your good opinion of them; as full well knowing, if they could but have effected thus much, to have made you not an enemy to their pro∣ceedings, though you did not close with them; it would have given much lustre and credit to their erroneous Sect: But God be praised that you are better grounded, then to be Pro∣selyted by such Ignoramo's; better re∣solved
then to be taken with such shallow delusions, which a good Chri∣stian with half an eye unprejudic'd, may easily see through.
It is your goodness (for Bonum quo melius eo communius) to de∣sire the publique communication of this short Discourse of the Spirit, as a Doctrine both seasonable in respect of the many spreading infectious Errors, so much prevailing amongst us; and also necessary as an Antidote against that contagion which issuing out of the mouth of Hell, presumes most impu∣dently and impiously to hide its ve∣nome under the name and title of the Holy Spirit: I could wish the Do∣ctrine were for this end, manfully and satisfactorily cleared to the mindes of men, by the Pen of some more Judi∣cious Writer; This mean Tract the Author in all humility acknowledges to be guilty of many defects and imper∣tinencies, and himself one of the mean∣est of the faithful and obedient sons
of the Church: The small acceptance it shall finde in the world, will be de∣rived from your white Name and Ver∣tue: in which Sanctuary it may escape the black-mouth'd Detractions of the Censorious, and rest secure of the good acceptance, if not benefit of others.
May you be every day more happy in the increase of all Christian vertues, growing up in the knowledge of God, and persevering in the constant Pro∣fession of his holy Truth, and consci∣encious practise of the same, till you arrive at the Haven of true Happiness. This (Madam) shall be the constant endevour, and is the dayly prayer
