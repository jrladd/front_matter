MY most Gracious Good Lords, I desire to leave te∣stimony to the world, how highly I honour as well the Miter as the Lance: there∣fore where my last Booke presented three most honourable Earles with a subject of Warre, and received from them favourable acceptance: the worke I now prosecute, concerning the Plantation of New-England, for the increase of Gods Church,

converting Salvages, and enlarging the Kings Dominions, prostrates it selfe humbly to your Graces; who as you are in the name of Prelacy to this Kingdome, so you are to mee in goodnesse both Fathers and Protectors un∣expectedly. God long preserve your Gracious lives, and continue favour
