Gentlemen,
IT was with great readiness that I undertook the Preaching of this Annual Sermon, and it is not with any great reluctance that I submit to the Printing it: I propose the same end, and entertain the same hopes, of doing good by it now, as I did then; and somewhat the more, I promise my self, by how much farther it may chance to spread. I am loath to say, that the Absence of a great many Persons whom I looked for, whom Custome, and the obligation of their Trust should call together on these Solemn good Occa∣sions, might furnish me with an excuse for making publick this Discourse, if otherwise I wanted one: For if it be necessary men should hear these things, we must pursue Them when they fly from Us, and give them Opportunities out of course, when they will not take them in the appointed Seasons. But I hope there
 is no need of any Excuse for doing this. It is an ex∣cellent Subject I have taken in hand, and greatly con∣cerns us all, but those especially whom God hath bless'd with great Estates. Whether I have treated it well or no, will best be seen by its effects; for if that be the best Sermon, which brings forth the best Fruits, it will depend entirely upon You, whether This shall be a Good one or no. Make it, I intreat you, in the name of God, as good as possibly you can; and let the Poor and Needy in their several kinds, both see and feel, that you like and love to practice, as well as read, a Sermon upon Charity.
The God of mercy and compassion keep and bless you, for your Care and Faithfulness, in the discharging that good Trust reposed in you, and raise you up continually Benefactors, to support the constant great Expence that you are at, To the Glory of his Great Name, the Ho∣nour of our Holy Church and Nation, and this great City in especial manner, and to the comfort of his poor and needy Servants.
I am, Gentlemen,
