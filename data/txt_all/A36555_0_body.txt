MADAME,
WOnder not that I presume to thrust this Tractate into your hands, as not having that Relation to your self, usuall in all such Dedications; yet finding so great an affinity betwixt your Goodnesse and the Tractate it self, so great unitie betwixt your Meditations daily ex∣press'd in your Practice, and these here im∣printed;
 I thought it not onely fit, but ne∣cessary to prefix your name unto it: For it is most just, That in whom these Meditati∣ons have been continually imprinted, she at last should be imprinted in these Medi∣tations. Take therefore this Book, reade it your self, and explain it to others, least that Gulf in the Title, ETERNITY, catch and involve those at unawares that might fore-run it. Let the Reader know that it is alwayes to be thought on, though never to be understood. Let him believe that every moment we travell unto it, and shall quickly come to our journeys end, that vast place of entertainment, the Inne of Eternitie: Let him look he bespeaks good Lodging, and good Company; for the next morning, as soon as the Sunne of Righteousnesse appears, he shall begin a journey that shall never have end; in which he shall still move on, yet never pro∣ceed; for going forward is but as standing still, in that motion to which no period is allotted. But this you know: in a word therefore; Take this book, now your owne: for though your lesse skill in the La∣tine tongue may deny you to have made the Originall, yet the zeal and piety of your Life is the best Translation. Shew it
 therefore to the world, that its Meditations whilest you live may be a Pattern for o∣thers, and when you are dead the Historie of yours.
So I have brought this Book and you to∣gether, I know you will quickly be ac∣quainted, and talk out the rest; therefore now ceasing to trouble you, I steal away in silence, remaining,
