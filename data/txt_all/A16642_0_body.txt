RIght Honorable, as
you being the Head,
and gouernour of the
Cittie, are careful, and
paineful, for the pre∣seruatiō
of the helth,
and wealth therof: so
if euerie member, and inhabitant be rea∣die
to do that he may, and ought to do:
our care, and paine, maye take the bet∣r
effecte. For the heade deuiseth, and
prouideth for all the bodie: but the hāds,
eete, mouth, stomacke, and other partes
serue it, as God hath ordained: by which
meanes it continueth in liuely estate, so
long as God hath appointed. So I being
one of the leaste members of the Citie,

haue taken paines to penne a short trea∣tise
of the Pestilence: wherewith it is of∣tentimes
annoyed: being persuaded, that
if it be generallye receyued, it maye doe
much good, for the preseruation of the
Citizens, and other inhabitauntes, from
the daunger of this disease. Therefore, I
haue thought good to present it to your
Honor: not doubting, but as your office
moueth you to be carefull, and you are
carefull according to your office: so you
wil haue care to publish this little Boke,
so farre forth, as you shall vnderstand by
your owne iudgemente, and by the ad∣uice
of other, both wise, and learned, that
it may profite the Citie: vnto the which,
& vnto the whole Realme, I wish con∣tinuall
health, and godly quietnesse:
and vnto your Honor, per∣petuall
and true
felicitie.
