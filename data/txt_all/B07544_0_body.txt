LICVRGVS (Right Wor∣shipfull) the LACEDEMO∣NIAN Law∣maker apoin∣ted condigne punishment for euery offendor according to the of∣fence, but for an vnthankefull person

he could finde no seueritie (nor seuere punishment) sufficient; In considerati∣on therefore of your worship, and euer approued fauours towards me, as I am bound, so I am moued to remember them, and shew my selfe mindfull and thankful for them, least I should seeme culpable of the grose sinne of Ingrati∣tude: and not haue power to performe my Gratuitie with gifts of excellencie. I haue made bolde to present to your Worship (in testimonie of my loue) my poore labours, wherein I laboured when I was the Lords labourer, in that Congregation where your Worships fauours were well approued, not to me alone, but to all that were faithfull preachers of Gods word, and confor∣mable ministers to the commendable Lawes of our gratious kinges Maiestie: Those apparant and approued giftes of grace, with many other commen∣dable gifts of nature by God planted in you, hath prouoked me to present;

as vnto a deuout patron of pietie, the fruits of my labours, and arguments of my loue, by Gods grace purposing and faithfully promising (vpon your wor∣shipful acceptation of this my widows mite) to dedicate more ample mani∣festation to you and yours, of my vn∣fained affection. In the meane time humbly crauing pardon for this my boldnes, and euer heartily (according to my bounden dutie) desiring our gratious God in your heart (by his gratious blessing) to increase such ho∣ly and heauenly vertues, whereby the good gifts of grace and nature planted in you may flourish, and bring forth such fruits of godlines, whereby Gods name may more be glorified, Christes members comforted, our gratious Kings loyall Subiects, by your godly obedience, to like obedience in coura∣ged, your Worships worthinesse more illustrated, the bodies & soules of you and all yours with blessinges Tempo∣rall,

more and more inriched, and with the Diadems and Crownes of glory, by the glorious King of Hea∣uen eternally Crowned, I rest. London the first day of September. 1617. (∴)
