Right worshipfull and well beloved,
AMongst my many friends, I have at this time made bold to prefixe your names to this small tract: you have been my people, and I doubt not, but will bee my patrons; you have already appeared my purgators from the reproa∣ches,
 which hereticall rage hath raised against me: yet that is not the end of this Dedication, the truth is Gods, and I doubt not his defence of it, and its Author, but to express my hearty af∣fections towards you, I think I may say you know I love you: I hope to rejoyce in many souls among you as seales of my Ministry: I cannot but let the world know, my Ministry afforded me most comfort among you; The Lord forgive the sin of such as divided between me and you, as my love is to you, my care is for you. A peo∣ple you are obnoxious to
 temptation, & conversant in holy cōference; & so sit for these instructions: you are sub∣ject to the same providences with other men, and no less apt to be swayed by them against divine precepts: your schismaticall neigh∣bours studying to seduce you, will (without doubt) ply you with the arguments of providence: and the luke∣warmness to, and slighty re∣cession from holy Ordinan∣ces of many among you; the Skepticisme of others who change their tune with the time and company, the se∣paration already made by some, and the Errastianisme
 of others, making the Church no other then the Common-wealth in a reli∣gious dress, decked by the looking glass of the civill Magistrates mind: The at∣tendance of the allegiance of some of you on whomso∣ever by a providence, though never so prophanely can step into a chair of State; but especially the late dis∣cords which have fallen out between you and your Mi∣nisters, & the rather (for that as I have heard) your Town hall hath (though but for a time, and that it may bee by connivance too) become a Chappell of contradiction to
 your Church, wherein the Lords day was spent in a different worship, to what you profess; cannot but make me fear, that you too much incline to dance after providence, beyond what God alloweth, & Scriptures doth direct: I must confess if providence must be our rule, universall toleration, nay, rather protection & propa∣gation of schime, error, and heresie, must be our duty, but I would desire that you may know the providences of God may dispose our condi∣tion, but not direct our con∣versation. I would beg you, to approve your selves obe∣dient
 to Scripture precepts whilst observant of successe∣full providences; as sen∣sible that one divine direction will afford more comfort in evil times then all providen∣tiall dispensations: notwith∣standing therefore, your eyes see to the trouble of your souls, men of Atheisme, & irreligion, perfidie & per∣jurie, schisme & sacriledge, subverting all civill Magi∣stracie, supplanting Gospel order, blaspheming Gods truth, and ordinances; ma∣king schismes in, and from Christ his Church; and set∣ting up themselves by sin∣full projects, and violent
 intrusion into Church and State, yet prosper in this pro∣phaneness, tempting God by stout words and religiously espousing him by fasting & prayers unto their horrid impieties, and yet are deliver∣ed be you carefull you do not admire providence into illogicall and irreligious con∣clusions: I would not dar∣ken any the dispensations of God to our Land, but wish that in our revolutions all men may read that God ruleth in the kingdoms of men, he pulleth down and setteth up by bis own soveraignty: but my work and endeavour is to direct men to the righ
 husbanding of providence, that successfull sin may not be lifted up, with the crie of sanctity, nor oppressed loy∣alty, justice, and piety, bee dejected, despised, and disowned: We live in changing days, and therein great is the cry of providence the godly are censured for not dancing after provi∣dence into Jeroboams chan∣ges in Church and State: whilst palpable & positive prophaneness is pleaded for as piety and generation-work of God: I pray you consi∣der sad are the changes which are onely defended by after providences: alteration may
 be of divine appointment, yet disowned by God, when effected by mens sinfull ac∣complishments, they have set up Kings but not by mee, saith God, in a case against which Israel must not fight, for this thing is from the Lord, 1 King. 12.21. Hos. 8.4. It will never content a gracious heart to attain an end of Gods appointment, unless by means of Gods approvement: anointed Da∣vid, provoked by persecuti∣on, durst not cut his way to the throne, his heart smote him for cutting the lap of Sauls garment, when pro∣vidence put his head into
 his power. Jeroboam for catching a Kingdom by a providence beareth this brand, Jeroboam who made Israel to sin; better it is to wait on, & walk with God in affliction, then be the sub∣jects of such providences, to wander with David in a wilderness til God cleer the throne; then with Jerobo∣am by perfidie, sedition, & rebellion to rend away a Kingdom, and possesse it themselves, though this condition be of divine ap∣pointment.
But (beloved Sirs) that I may not too long parley with you at the threshold,
 shall I be bold in the name of the Lord to propound unto you some few duties to be done by you in such days of providence? shall I beg that in these evill times you will observe these four directions?
1. Propound the word, not providence of God as the rea∣son of your faith and rule of conversation. This, not that, is appointed to this end: Jesus Christ by one provi∣dence might have made to himselfe many proselites, yet would not allow it, but ever referred his hearers to Scriptures: the new lights of our age blaze much with
 providence but look you to the Law and the Testimonie if any speak not according to this rule, there is no truth in him: Oh let not Christian faith be founded on Tur∣kish reason.
2. Persevere in truth and piety, Heresies must come, that they who are sound may be made manifest; Schisme must succeed, that the fixed in Christ may be found sin∣cere: these must not onely come on the the stage; but stand and succeed; it may be unto persecution of the Orthodox and sound; as did Arrianisme in the Gre∣cian Empire, & Anabaptisme
 in Germany, they are no o∣ther then tryalls of faith and patience: be it your care to cleave to truth, when dis∣owned and disregarded: and continue in the Church, though disordered and dis∣couraged: let not the boy∣sterous blasts of providence remove you from your sted∣fastness in the faith, or uni∣on of the Church Catho∣lick. I know the design of some schismaticall neigh∣bours, by courting, nay some of them by creeping into your town is to paganize you, (as they have done other places) and set up their own schismaticall as∣semblies;
 and I fear your over affectionate observati∣on of the providential rising of some from you, hath been as a snare of separation from the Churh unto more then naturall relations: but how∣ever Church gatherers have gathered the power & trea∣sure of these Nations to themselves: forsake not you the assembling of your selves together, as the manner of som is, and stand out against the sinful assembling of Church gatherers: The glittering glory of particular Churches of selfe-constitution (that way of Corah) and selfe consecra∣tion (that way of Jeroboam)
 will prove, nay I may say doth prove an ignis fatuus, leading into the fools paradise of high expectations, but leaving men in the wilderness of confusion. They that feared God in Israel followed the despised and driven out Priests to Jerusalem; let it be your prayer & care not to fol∣low the flocks of Christ his pre∣tended companions, I pray you recall to mind what instructions I gave you many years since from that Text Cant. 1.7. & whilst you have power pre∣vent Congregational foxes from spoiling your vines, though you cannot keep them out of close corners, you may from places of concourse, and command them out of your common Hall, and
 publick places of assemblie, give them no countenance whose on∣ly errand is confusion: you are now a Church of Christ become not the guilded Synagogue of Satan. Will not reason tell you selfe-constitution is a sedition in the Common-wealth and schisme in the Church? Is authority essen∣tiall to a civill, and not to a re∣ligious Corporation? What su∣perstructure can bee built on a sinfull schismatical foundation? judge ye: though it flourish flie from it, it cannot but fall: I say bee you stable in truth, steady in the union of the Church, con∣stant to Gods covenant, and continuing in prayer, though God carry discouragingly to∣wards his people: for God
 laughs the Devill to scorn, when Job serveth him for nought: and the Saints constancy in holiness doth witness that there is a re∣ward to the righteous, when the prospering providences of the prophane do suggest, it's in vain to serve God.
3. Prize and preserve among you a sound and zealous Ministry, such you have enjoyed, such you may (by your own advan∣tages which you above other Towns) enjoy, Pastors to feed witb knowledge and understanding, are Gods promises and his peo∣ples priviledge, bread and water of affliction to be imbraced be∣fore their removeall: let not the generall contempt provi∣dence poureth on Mnistry, dead∣en
 your affection to your Mini∣sters; but know them as over you in the Lord: I am not a little grieved for your late differences with godly Ministers; I wish you would seriously surveigh your souls, see wether some spirit of pride, passion, preju∣dice, or vain glory, do not act and occasion them: take heed you jar not with Ministers, untill you wreak your quarrell on Ministry; I wish some of you have not already proclaimed o∣pen warr: I will not acquit your Ministers from their infirmities; but desire you take heed to your selves; in this day of discoura∣ging providences to Gods Mi∣nisters; true piety should prize & prefer them: so evill are
 the times that dis-satisfaction in a prophane Minister can scarce∣ly pass without the censure of dis-respect to Ministry; much less when fomented & continued against a man who is a faithful, painful, and diligent (and in the generall course of his life, let malice say its worst) a godly Minister: my beloved, let the office and person be distingui∣shed, and the dignity of the one will darken and cloud the infir∣mitie of the other; and the authority of the one will awe duty denied to the weakness of the other. Receive Ministers as they are indeed the messen∣gers of the Lord of Hosts, & Em∣bassadors of Jesus Christ, and
 then despise them even in their distress if you can:
4. Pursue your conference and mannage it with all prudence, avoid the evills incident to it, pursue the directions herein propounded: you have here∣tofore been acquainted with them but have need to bee put in remembrance: take heed of spirituall pride in conference, least it prove an Audley confe∣rence that may plunge you into the precipice of Anabaptisme, and other heresies: my heart bleeds over those men with whom you know I have some∣time past had sweet commu∣nion though they wil not now hear mee, bee warned by their example.

Be carefull of, and constant in these and other duties dire∣cted in the word, what ever men say or cross providences seem to suggest: Let Ecebolius whirl about with every wind of providence in the Empire, untill hee proclaim the shame of his own unconstancy; be you pillars of truth, and Cedars of holiness, standing in stormy days, as indeed rooted and built up in Christ, and resolved into divine revelation as your rule, however disposed by pro∣vidence as to your present outward condition: where∣unto that you may bee strengthened, read these notes as helpfull, and offered from
 the hearty affections, and with the hearty prayer for Gods blessing,

from my Study in Bo∣tolphs Algate Lon. Nov. 3. 1659.
