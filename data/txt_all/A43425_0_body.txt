SIR,
I Had scarce made a Con∣clusion of these following Lines, before an unex∣pected Message from You found me, while my Thoughts were yet warm with the Influ∣ence of Providence: And the Truth is, I was amazed at the Surprizing Instance of Your Favour; to find so Worthy and Generous a Patron! to behold so signal a Kindness streaming from an Ʋn∣known
 Fountain! and to find the News conveyed by a perfect Stranger! Truly, so singular a Favour, freely conferred on a Person both Obscure and Ʋndeser∣ving, was a fresh and convincing Argu∣ment to me, That the smallest Figure in the World was Naked and Open to the Eye of Providence. And I hope the World will excuse the trouble of these Papers, seeing they are Publisht as a Hearty Testimonial of my Thankful∣ness; which is a Debt always to be pay∣ing, but never to be sufficiently discharged,
Honoured SIR,
