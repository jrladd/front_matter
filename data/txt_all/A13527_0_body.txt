WOrthy Sir: Sithence the smallest tra∣ctates in this age passe not without their Dedicatories; I would not seem singular in denying this little Booke that ordinary priuiledge; which being but newly hatcht, doth (with the Philosophers bird, which flew into his bosome) seek shelter vnder your Worships co∣uerture; whose name I durst not prefixe before so weake a worke, but that I haue some encouragements: as first, the inward familiarity which once I had with you for di∣uers yeeres together in your tender age. Againe, your loue to learning, and that affection you haue alwaies shew∣ed towards them that leane that way: moreouer, that re∣ligious respect which you haue alwaies testified to the do∣ctrine of truth, one maine branch whereof is briefly laid downe in this Treatise; and lastly, those employments whereunto you are sometimes called, by reason of your place of Iustice-ship; vnto the faithfull discharge where∣of, this little (Mappe of Moses) will afford you some
 direction. I dare not (for feare of flattery) blaze the least part of that commendation which a worthy Gentle∣man of your acquaintance hath giuen you in his Booke dedicated vnto you,M. Tho. Ganif∣ford I squire pnt d th  116. and intituled, The Secretaries Stu∣d: et I my boldly affirme that that generous toward∣nesse, which he with others at that time discerned in you, was but as a dram in comparison of that weight of worth which is now found in you: which as it is no little com∣fort vnto your godly and worthy Parents, whose earnest desire alwaies was to giue you their Lemuel, a truely re∣ligious and generous education: so it hath much reioyced me to heare the relation both of your religious loue to∣wards God, as also of the affection of your Country to∣wards you, testified sufficiently in their late nomination and election of you for one of their Knights in the Parli∣ament. Now Sir, as for this poore tractate, I humbly en∣treat your Worship to accept, as a certaine testimony of my thankefull minde, qui, si non potui maxima; parua dedi: such as I haue I present vnto you; a few blotted leaues, wherein you shall not meete with any flourishing words, or curious lines; yet with Gods truth euidently laid downe in the plainest dialect; in acceptance wherof, I shal not be wanting in my prayers, for Gods blessing vpon your selfe, and your vertuous Lady, that your house and ho∣nour may continue vnblemished.

That God may direct you in all your proceedings, en∣crease in you his sauing graces; blesse you and all yours with long life, and much happinesse, to his glory, the pub∣like good, your owne comfort here, and eternall glory hereafter; in hope and full perswasion whereof, I humbly take my leaue, and rest,
