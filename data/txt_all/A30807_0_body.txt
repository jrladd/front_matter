Gentlemen,
ALthough so great a
Vein of Medicine
be put into your
Hands, I presume you nei∣ther
intend to commence Do∣ctors

your selves, or give
Degrees to Others at those
Wells.
I Confess that to be in any
measure Intrusted with the
General Health of so Popu∣lous
a City, whether for its
Preservation or Recovery,
is no small Blessing, if right∣ly
Manag'd. And that
You are made Trustees by
the Providence of GOD,
for the Publique Good,
in this Affair, seems better
Order'd, than if it had fell
into the Hands of Physi∣cians

Themselves, who are
too apt to Monopolize, and
make Arcana.
I did last Year observe
how Freely, and on what
Easie Terms you set Open
those Salutiferous Foun∣tains,
so that None cou'd
complain for want of their
Benefit. I likewise took
Notice of a great deal of
Mis-Management in the
Ʋse of those Waters. Least
therefore such Wholesome
Springs should not be us'd

aright, and so have their
Just Value abated; I have
kindly Ʋndertaken to give
some Account of their Na∣ture
and Virtues. To which
Others, or my Self (after
further Experience of 'em)
may add a fuller Character,
Adorn'd with the Observa∣tions
of Various Cures.
I have also directed a pro∣per
Method for their Me∣dicinal
Use, in shewing
what Care is requisite in the
Drinking of 'em. But how
the Body is to be prepar'd, and

the Method of 'em discreetly
carried on, that the Waters
may become more Effectual
to so many Various Di∣stempers,
and Different
Constitutions, recourse
must be had to Physicians.
Now altho' I have play'd
the Hydrotomist with
these Balsamick-Wells,
and by the Rules of Art in
my Laboratory strictly
examin'd their Principles;
so that I am tollerably fur∣nish'd
with a fair Account

of so New a Discovery; Yet
I will not Post my Self at the
Wells, or expose an Apo∣thecary's
Shop, as many
may do, to get rid of some Old
Medicines, &c. But Re∣serve
at my own House those
few Medicines I judge fit
both to Prepare the Body,
and Accompany the Ʋse of
the Waters variously de∣sign'd.
For I wou'd have
every Industrious Physi∣cian
qualifie Himself for
Real Service, and then 'tis
pity but he shou'd be heard.

And I hope this my Ʋn∣dertaking
will candidly be
accepted by All, and escape
the abusive Censures of some
Physicians, who are not
willing to be at so much
Pains, yet shall think their
Merchandize hereby obstru∣cted.
I hope, Gentlemen,
you will be very Industrious
to keep Open these Balsa∣mick
Springs, that they
may long Flow to the Ad∣vantage
of many: And that
the Other Accommodations

may be so Dispos'd, as to be
only serviceable to this Great
and Good Design; that no
Disrepute may be cast on the
Wells, nor Sobriety offen∣ded
by contriving the Enter∣tainment
of Luxury and
Needless Diversions,
and so become an Unhand∣some
Rendevouz. But
I doubt not but under your
Prudent Conduct, their Me∣dicinal
Virtues will raise
'em to such a General Good
Esteem, that they'll become
the Metropolitan Fountain.

That these Rivulets may
joyn together, and become
one lasting Spring; And that
the love of so great a Blessing
may unite Proprietors and
Physicians, in Contriving
'em the best way to be ser∣viceable
to the Publick Good,
are the Ʋnfeigned Wishes of,
Gentlemen,

From my House
in New-Street,
by Shoe-Lane,
near the Five-Bells.
