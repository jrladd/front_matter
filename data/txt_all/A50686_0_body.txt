SIR,
YOu cannot favour the Book so much, as wonâˆ£der
at my presumption; nor I could not
have had the boldness, as to present it, but
that the symphaticall nature betwixt us
did draw my Genius, as by a North-Pole
virtue, to make you the Patron of these my indeavours;
I wish the Praises were like Tearus streams, and rellish
so in the Appetite, as to invite your serious eye to make
pursuit through it, gaining your favour so farre (which
is my sole Ambition) to rest under the wings of your
Piety and Learning, which having obtain'd, it may
say I merrily through the World, fearing neither Rock
nor Quick-sand; for they are like Castor and Pollux, to
scoure the carping Criticks from it in their censorious
manner of guiding and directing: Now my intreaties
(mixt with a little hope) have made their Petition,
which if they return with fertility, it shall ever binde
me to your virtues, in the chains of Amity with a
Phrygian knot, which to loose is impossibility in my
heart; thus fearing no tempestuous scorns, nor full
mouth Borea's blasts of reprehension, because you are
the Pilot, stearing the Rudder of its weaknesse from
all such dangerous shelves, and wishing eternal honour
to your virtues, is the hearty desire of,
Sir,
