MAdam, after all the admired wittes of this excellent age, which haue labored in the sad complaints of faire and unfortunate Rosa∣mond, and by the excellencie of inuention, haue sounded the depth of her sundry passi∣ons; I present to your Ladiship this Epistle of hers to King Henry, whome I may rather call her louer than beloued. Heere must your Ladiship behold variablenes in resolution; woes constantly grounded; laments abruptly broken off; much confidence, no certainty, words begetting teares, teares con∣founding matter, large complaint in little papers; and many deformed cares, in one vniformed Epistle. I striue not to effect singularitie, yet would faine flie imitation, & prostrate mine owne wants to other mens perfections. Your iudiciall eye must model forth what my pen hath layd together, much would shee say to a King, much would I say to a Countesse, but that the method of my Epistle must conclude the mode∣stie of hers, which I wish may recommend my euer vowed seruice to your Honour.
