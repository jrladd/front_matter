Gentlemen,
IT is not unknown to the rest of the Nation, how like your selves you have acted. What great things you have done for the Glory of God, and the Protestant Religion, for the Preservation of His Majesties Royal Person, and for the Peace and Safety of the whole Kingdom, is obvious to all persons that have consider'd your several Loyal Petitions to his Majesty, and candid Applications to the late excellent House of Commons: The just Harmony, and reciprocal Kindness betwixt your City and the Nations Representatives, have given no small Terrour to our Ene∣mies, and no small Comfort to our Friends. I need not trouble you with any further instance, how much your proceedings influence the Countries, more than by putting you in mind how the Papists thought to ruine them, by laying you in Ashes. You are the only Ʋnited Force that can oppose them, and You only can protect your Soveraign, as being the chief support of the Government, the chief Refuge of the People, and the Curb or Bridle to the unjust illegal Ambition of all Arbitrary and Evil men: and this made those Firebrands of the World, I mean the Jesuits, (of whom Mar∣tial prophetically spoke, when he wrote, Turba gravis Paci, placidae{que} ini∣mica quieti) first endeavour to compass your destruction, before they made any attempt upon the Person of the King. Your late eminent choice of Offi∣cers, as Mayor, Sheriffs, Recorder, &c. hath given much discontent to the Popish Party, who stand in need as well of corrupt Juries, as Judges. But above all, your most prudent Election of such untainted Members to serve in the last Parliament, did render to other Corporations so worthy a President, and your great Example was of so vast consequence to the rest of the Nation, that I may without flattery say, as we owe good Laws to a good Parliament, so must we in some measure attribute a good Par∣liament, to your good City. And therefore, Gentlemen, although I address this Paper to all other Cities, Shires, and Boroughs in general, yet more particularly to You, the honest Citizens of London, whose Honourable Proceedings so highly conduce to the preservation of that Church, that King, and that People, for either of which, I would most freely render my self a Sacrifice; dreading no curse like that of a Popish Successor, and wishing no happiness more then his present Majesties long and prosperous Reign. Now as a Parliament must prevent the one, so does it at the same time help to preserve the other, the King's Life being no longer in danger of the Papists, after once the Exclusive Bill is pass'd. Ʋpon the choice of this Parliament, depends the happiness or misery not only of his Majesties Dominions, but of the whole Protestant Religion, and of all the Reformed
Churches in Christendom: A good Parliament may be a means to pre∣serve the poor Hollanders from becoming an innocent Victim to all our for∣mer and present Evil Counsels, as well as Flanders and the whole Empire from being reduced to the French Yoke; after which, the ruine of this King∣dom would be an unavoidable consequence: A good Parliament may ad∣vise his Majesty to such things as shall fortifie the Protestant Interest, and terrifie the French Tyrant into a greater moderation towards the disconso∣late Hugonots: A good Parliament may retrieve the distressed Protestants in Ireland, from that second Popish Massacre which so daily threatens them: And last of all, as to our own Domestick concerns, a good English Parliament may secure us from our Enemies both abroad and at home; may encourage the Kings Evidence, after those many Discountenances they have receiv'd as well from Protestants as Papists; may make it appear not only more honest, but more safe, to discover a Plot, then to contrive one; may remove those distractions and fears which so daily amaze and threaten us; as also establish us in such peace, tranquility and plenty, as may render us a fit object for the Envy of all Christendom. Therefore (Gentlemen) since providence (though against our wills) hath once more transmitted our fortune into our own hands, Let us not be weary of well-doing, but pre∣sent his Majesty with no worse a Parliament then the Last, who acted in all things for the glory of God, safety and honour of the King, and welfare of his three Kingdoms; in fine, such a Parliament it was, that no one could except against, but such guilty persons, who justly merited their Resent∣ments, and for the same reason would decry all Parliaments whatsoever. And therefore if your Members be mostly the same again, you do thereby express that Gratitude, which they have justly merited from you by their former Services; as also justifie the prudence of your preceding choice: Neither is it a small benefit to the Nation, if you elect such men as are well acquainted with the manner of Proceedings in Parliament, and of whose integrity and prudence you have had a former tryal: this not being a time to enter Novices. However, to consult the publick Interest herein is best; and in so doing, that God would endue you with the Spirit of Judgment, and direct you to all things that may be for the good of King and Kingdom, is the daily and hearty prayers of
(Gentlemen)
