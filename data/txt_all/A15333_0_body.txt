Madame.
THE deepe understanding you have in all the Arts, and perticular excellency in this of Musicke, doth by a cer∣taine kinde of right, challenge the Dedication of the bet∣ter sort of Labours in that Facultie; especially in these times when Musicke sits solitary among her sister Sci∣ences, and (but for your Honour) often wants the fortune to be esteemed (for so shee is worthy) euen among the worthyest. But besides that generall right, my true and zealous deuotion long since de∣sirous to expresse it selfe in any humble dutie to your Honour, and borne up by the daily experience of your most Noble and singular disposition, hath neuer thought upon other Patron for this work, then your Honour, whose neuer-failing Iudgement in the depth of Musicke, I do wish might be pleased with some of these; which happinesse if they attaine, I know not what iudgement can avow to mislike them. Howsoeuer they behaue themselues, I humbly beseech your Honour, to beleeue this truth; that they are the sincere oblations of a heart euer prepared for your seruice. And so with all humble and due reuerence done to your Honour, I be∣seech the Almighty to make you in all the passages of your life truely hap∣py, as you are in the worlds true opinion vertuous.
