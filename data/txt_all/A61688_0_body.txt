Great SIR,
THO I'm no Soldier my self, yet four years Conversation with men of that Profession has emboldened me to Ad∣dress Your Sacred Majesty, not for Your Royal Protection against the future
 Attacks of those who will call the Ac∣count I have given of their management in Ireland, A new making War upon them; Nor to ask Your Majesty's Pa∣tronage to a Work so imperfect, which would be a Presumption impardonable: But with the deepest sense of Duty, and humblest Submission, to beg Your Ma∣jesty's Pardon for adventuring formerly to publish some part of Your Majesty's Ge∣nerous Actions, and Hazardous Ʋnder∣takings in that Kingdom; and now for my Ambition in repeating the same, which will always be a Subject far beyond the reach of so mean a Pen as mine.
I have nothing to value my self upon, but the honour of being imployed in Your Ma∣jesty's Service ever since Your Majesty's happy Accession to the Throne, encouraged thereunto for those Reasons amongst many more, That all English-men who have a
 pretension to the Title of being Brave, ne∣ver had a more happy opportunity of reco∣vering and maintaining the Ancient Glory of this once most renowned Kingdom, than under the Auspicious Conduct of Your Sacred Majesty; by whose Great Example many of those whose very Constitutions were of late softned with Ease and Pleasure, are now invited to Feats of Arms worthy the Off-spring of their Ancestors. And what greater Comfort and Satisfaction can Men of any other Profession receive, than in seeing Your Majesty still so zealous in the defence of that Interest, which themselves have so great a share in?
May Your Majesty therefore, and Your Royal Consort, be as happy in Dutiful and Obedient Subjects, as we are under Your most Prudent and Gra∣cious Government; to which no man can bear a greater Zeal, nor pray more
 heartily for Your Majesties long Life, Health, constant Prosperity and Glory, than
