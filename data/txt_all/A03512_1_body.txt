AMongst th'Heroes of the VVorlds prime years,
Stand here, great Duke, & see theÌ„ shine about you:
Informe your princely minde and spirit by theirs,
And then, like them, liue euer; looke without you,
For subiects fit to vse your place, and grace:
VVhich throw about you, as the Sunne, his Raies;
In quickning, with their power, the dying Race
Offriendlesse Vertue; since they thus can raise
Their honor'd Raisers, to Eternitie.
None euer liu'd by Selfe-loue: Others good
Is th'obiect of our owne. They (liuing) die,
That burie in them selues their fortunes brood.
To this soule, then, your gracious count'nance giue;
That gaue, to such as you, such meanes to liue.
