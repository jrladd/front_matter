Mother of Muses, and great Nurse of Art,
Which lent'st the roote from whence these sweets are grown,
Now with increase, receiue a bounteous part,
Which thou mayst iustly chalenge as thine owne:
That Grant may to the comfort of her streames
Behold her (Seedes of late) now Dulcet flowres,
And with the plentie of the famous Thames,
Attyre her Nymphs, and decke her watry bowres
And cherishing these Choyces of delights,
With daintie Garlands, Crowne the peacefull shore,
Prepard for Feasting, and Triumphant sights,
More Beautifull than ages heretofore:
Whil'st all the Floods so famous but of late,
Shall giue their glorie to adorne her state.

Sua cuique gloria.
