WOrshipfull, being fully assured of the sincere loue and affection which you bare vnto him, whose memoriall these lines desire still to reuiue: I am bold to present them (though rude and vnpolished) vnto your fauourable Patronage and protection. First, because of that singular loue and liking which you haue vnto Reli∣gion, and religious men, especially such as are faithfull Ministers and Preachers of Gods Word: Secondly, be∣cause I thought it would be vnto you no vnacceptable ser∣uice, if I endeuoured by dead letters to preserue his ver∣tues and perfections in liuing name, whom cruell death hath too soone taken from you and vs, and vntimely laid in dust: and lastly, to manifest vnto you the thankful∣nesse of my heart, for those many good and vndeserued fauours and encouragements in my calling heretofore, from himselfe, and since his death receiued from you. These are the reasons which haue induced me to publish this my simple Weakling, vnto euery vulgar hand and

eye vnder your Worships name, nothing doubting, but that your fauourable patronizing of it, will bee a principall meanes to couer the many wants, and innumerable weak∣nesses thereof, which men of gifts will soone espy. Now the God of heauen blesse you, together with that hopefull Branch that God hath sent you, from his loynes who is now with God, as a token of Gods loue and fauour to you both; with long life beere on earth, and eternall in the heauens.
