POntanus in his 19.
chapiter de magni∣ficentia,
among o∣ther
thinges ma∣keth
mention of one Aco∣nitanus,
that presented vnto

Alphonsus King of Calabria,
a Box of Amber, very curi∣ously
& artificialy wrought,
which being opened by the
King: had nothing else but
a little sflye enclosed within.
Surely (sayd Alphonsus) the
reward is but smal, notwith∣standing
a Prince that mea∣sureth
it not so much by the
price, as by the rarenes ther¦of,
accountes it for a moste
precious present. And ha∣uing
so sayde, hee stoode a
great while amazed, be∣thinking

himselfe, with
what kinde of rewarde hee
mighte worthily recōpence
him that gaue a gifte so gea∣son:
Madam I offer not vn∣to
your honoure an Amber
Box with a Fly, as Aconitanus
did, nor my cap ful of water
as Synctes did, nor mine hād¦ful
of leaues, as another
Persian did, and yet the
thinge that I offer agreeth
in one respect to all these
three, & againe in one point
differeth from one of them

onelye. It agreeth with all
three in basenes: and it dif∣fereth
onely from the Am∣ber
Box, which preferred a
glosing and bewtifull showe
to the outward vewe, and yet
had nothing with in it
but a thinge of noughte:
much lyke vnto an house,
which outwardlye is verie
sumpteously adorned, yel∣ding
a port of great maiestie
and magnificence to the eie,
but when a man is entred in
to it, there is nothing to be

seene but onely the bare
wales. VVherevnto the
thinge that I offer is cleane
contrary: For it yeldeth no
glorious nor glistringe glose
nor any coloure of delighte
vnto the eye: notwithstan∣ding
I haue so prouided
that the matter therein con∣tained
shall suffice to com∣mend
it without the helpe
of any externall ornamēts.
And hauing at last brought
the same to perfection, I
could not call to remēber∣aunce

any person of estate,
on whome I had greater
cause to bestowe it, then vp∣on
your honoure. For con∣sidring,
your courteous &
amiable acceptatiō of those
fewe ragged verses, whiche,
aboute two yeares paste I
presumed to tender vnto
your discreete iudgement, I
must needes confesse that,
from that time to this pre∣sent
day, I haue bene depe∣ly
indebted vnto your good
Ladyship. And nowe, some∣what

what to discharge my selfe
of that continuall burthen,
and to make satisfaction in
part, of the debte which I
haue so longe owed: I haue
compiled this little booke
of Prayers grounded vpon
the deuine promises contai∣ned
in the sacred Scriptures,
which I haue aduentured to
publish vnder the patronag
of your Ladyships name,
crauing that as ofte soeuer,
as God shall put it in your
mynde to withdrawe your

selfe into your closet, there
to meditate vpon the hea∣uenly
promises, of our most
mercifull Father, (as your
vexteous mynde is very sel∣dome,
or neuer at all, other∣wise
enclined,) that then you
woulde vouchsafe to take
this booke in hand, and tur∣ning
to any title whatsoeuer
may serue your tourne, to
apply the prayer folowing
vnto your present purpose.
But perchaunce you will say
that there are alredy extant

diuers & sundry bookes of
prayers, which haue bene set fourth
by men of greater
vnderstāding & riper iudge¦ment
then I, and therfore
it was a needeles and super∣fluous
trauaile to wade any
furthar in that matter. In∣dede Madame
I graunt that
ther are many praier bokes
published, but yet I am of
this opinion that if there
were ten tymes as many, yet
there were not to many. For
the common prouerbe is,

Bnum, quo ōmunius, eo melius:
The more common a good
thinge is, the better it is
And therefore will I hardly
be perswaded, that my la∣boure
could anye way haue
bene better employed, then
in suche causes as concerne
the aduauncement of Gods
glory, and the propagation
of vertue. VVell such as it
is I haue presumed to offer
vnto your honoures idge∣ment,
with assured hope,
that you will deeme of it, as

your noble nature hath ben
alwaies enclined to iudge of
them that attempt the like
enterprises: & that you will
accept it as a sure tokē and
testimonie of his loyall af∣fection
and readie dutie,
that would thinke himselfe
happie to bee accoumpted
but as the least in the num∣ber
of those that woulde be
allwayes at your Ladiships
commaundement.
