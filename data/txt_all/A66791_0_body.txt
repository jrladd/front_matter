IT is a more Blessed thing to Give, than to Receive; There∣fore, having hitherto been a Receiver only, I am now de∣sirous to be a Giver also, though it be but of a Mite, or of a Cup of cold water; For, we are not to expect Benedictions or Ac∣ceprations, strictly answerable to the quantity or quality of our Gifts considered in themselves, but according to our Purposes and Abilities; which incourages me to send you a handful of such Fruit as grows upon my WITHERD-Tree, now almost past bearing, that if you find it as pleasant and as wholsome, as I conceived it to be, you having therewith refreshed your selves, may if you please, pick out some of the Kernels, and by sowing and replanting them in your Orchards, preserve the kinde for future use, when my Tree is rotten.
I make not tender of this Diminutive Present, by way of Rtri∣bution; For, GOD is your reward: but to be a testimonial of my Gratitude, and of my willingness, to have done more, if I had been able; or rather, that it may be a memorial of GODS Mercy to me vouchsafed by your hands when I was deserted of the World; which ought never to be by me forgotten: For, I confess, I have thereby lived to produce this, and whatsoever I shall do hereafter in discharge of my duty, and had else, ere this day perished from the Earth, for ought I know to the con∣trary, though in my greatest wants and uncertainty of Supplies I was always as far from a despairing Distrust, as if I had then possessed a Vault filled with hidden Treasures, which no man could take from me: And (though I am yet in no more cer∣tainty in respect of External Supplies) GOD preserves in me the same confidence, and I believe he will always preserve it in me.
This, is so great, and so extraordinary a Mercy, considering the many terrors, distrusts & necessities, wherewith many thou∣sands of better men are daily exercised & proved, that I conceive my self obliged in conscience, openly to acknowledge it both to glorifie him who vouchsafes it, and to confirm in my self and other men, our Christian hopes, by delaring what GOD hath

done for my soul, who have nothing in my self to deserve it, but what is of his gift, and who have much more of my own, which rather deserves the contrary. I am, and I hope shall ever be so far from being ashamed of my preservation by meer Charity, that I do esteem it a greater honour & happiness, than to have the most plentiful subsistance which the world can confer upon me by a constant Revenue, with an eminent dignitary annexed: For I have seen the best Provisions of that kind, not only to fall but to bring their Possessors also to be worse than nothing.
I had superscribed your Names (or hereto added a Cata∣logue of them:) but many of you are personally unknown, and, the rest having discovered themselves unto me, for our mutual comfort and conversation only (without any desire that notice might be taken by other men of what hath been communicat∣ed, and passed between them and me) I do forbear making your Names publick, for that and other considerable respects. You are my friends by the surest side: For you were not made mine by my industry, merit, solicitation, or in respect of any carnal Relations, but meerly by GODS Mediation who inclined your hearts to that voluntary compassion, whereof I had fruit in due season, sufficient to preserve me, without sordid want or dejecti∣on, in that condition wherein I am likely to be continued to fit me for that service, which I have yet to do; and I am confident that he who made you my Friends, will so keep you; and make me thankful to him and you, whilst we live in this world. Your Acceptation I doubt not of, nor of assistance by your prayers to the end of my Pilgrimge: For, though some of us may cir∣cumstantially differ in our Iudgements, we are one in him and with him, in his Essential Truth, and in that love which knits all the Saints into one blessed and everlasting Communion. I am
