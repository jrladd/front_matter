MADAME,
I Do not offer unto you any thing of my own, for that it is already yours, or that you are worthy thereof, since your eyes have not so many charms, nor your attractions so much power to captivate hearts, as the lustre of your Vertues do expresse unto
all men the admirable per∣fections both of Nature and Grace which are ex∣tant in your person.
Your modesty, the mild∣nesse of your discourse, and that gracious humility with the which you enter∣tain those who have the honour to be acquainted with you, are precious jewels which do atchieve your renown.
Give me leave then (Madam) to end this my thrice humble dedication, with that homage and with that bounden oblation which I owe to your all at∣tracting goodnesse, and let your favourable ac∣ceptance deign to receive
it, since it's presented with all the submissiv'st respects imaginable by him who puts all his heart in his Pen (the better) to assure you, that amongst those who admire you, none can be more then himself,
Madam,
