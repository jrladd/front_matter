THou glorious Laurell of the Muses hill,
Whose eyes doth crowne the most victorius pen,
Bright Lampe of Vertue, in whose sacred skill,
Liues all the blisse of eares-in chaunting men,
From grauer subiects of thy graue assayes,
Bend thy coragious thoughts vnto these lines,
The graue froÌ„ whence mine humble Muse doth raise
True honors spirit in her rough deseignes;
And when the stubborne stroke of my harsh song,
Shall seasonlesse glide through almightie eares,
Vouchsafe to sweet it with thy blessed tong,
VVhose wel tun'd sound stills musick in the sphears,
So shall my tragick layes be bleft by thee,
And from thy lips suck theyr eternitie.
