Right Honorable & Right Worshipfull,
THe much Christian Courtesie and very
many and most constant immerited fa∣vours,
whereof from time to time, I and
mine have most sweetly tasted from your
Honour and Worships: But especially, the serious
observation of the pious and painfull, yea, even in∣defatigable
Labours of Love, for God and his
great Cause, which not onely I, but even the whole
Kingdome in generall, and this renowned City in
speciall, have cleerly taken notice of, and been
most happily sensible of, to proceed from your Ho∣nour
and Worships, (Et, O terque quaterque feli∣cia
saecula, quae Vos tales Patriae genuere Parentes)
This double and indissoluble Ligament (I say) of
ever bounden Gratitude, hath most deeply enga∣ged
me to dedicate and consecrate, This third Part
of my Parliamentary-Chronicle to your good Ho∣nour
and Worships, as a most true Tessera and
Sincere Symbole of that ever obliged observance,
which (together with my poor All) I most justly
and ingenuously acknowledge to be most due

unto you All, my ever most highly honoured
good Friends in generall; and hereby also in a
more speciall and peculiar manner to take opor∣tune
occasion to give-in my most cordiall congra∣tulation
and just and joyful Acclamation for your
good Honours happy inauguration unto the most
honourable Majorallity of this celebrious and most
Renouned City of London; which, though it may
seem to come somewhat too tardily, yet I assure
your Honour it comes now most cordially; and
though it cannot speak so loudly as others, yet I
assure you (my good Lord) it speaks as lovingly
as the best of your good Lordships most devoted
Votaries. Which, therefore, together with my best
Services hoping your good Honour & Worships wil
in your accustomed Candor and even connative in∣genuity,
receive with the Heart & Hand of courte∣ous
and candid Acceptation; I shall hereby be still
more and more deeply endeered, in all my best en∣deavours,
especially, in my poor Prayers to presse
the Thron of Grace, that your good Honour and
Worships may long flourish, as most famous tall-grown
Cedars on the tops of the Mountains of this
our English-Lebanon, inferiour to None of your for∣mer
famous Predecessours; and shall hereby also
most obligedly rest,
