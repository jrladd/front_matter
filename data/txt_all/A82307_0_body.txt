RIght Honourable and Religious Collonel, grace, mercy, and peace be unto you from God the Father, and from our Lord Iesus Christ. The cause of this my writing unto you is: that I may be one of your Remembrancers amongst the rest to the advancement of truth. Right Honourable Collonel, I have a little opportunity, have gathered into a little booke these scattered meditations: Not but that you know much more then I am able to present before your view; but having no better thing to present to your Honour; having confidence that you will
not dispise the least Talent imployed to the best of any power. I do make bold to offer these weake meditations to your  hoping you will accept of them; though weake, desiring God that he will fill, you with himselfe, and empty you of all but his own glory, and if you finde any thing thereâˆ£in that may glorifie God. I desire that all may be ascribed to him to whom all glory belongs.
