I Was bold (Madam) for two causes to de∣dicate this Nosegay vnto your ladishippe. The first is, the gentle acceptāce that I know it shal haue at your hands, who haue al∣waies been a fauourer of learning, & of them that are learned: The seconde is, that comming out vnder the name of so woorthie a Patronage, it shalbe the better accepted of all men. I am bounde also for twoo causes to doe the same, first to satisfie in part the duetie which I owe vnto you, and to shew some signe of the loue that I ow to you and yours: Secondly that the worlde may see that
alwayes a green tree is not fruitles: but that that garden which before bare brā∣bles and thistles, if it be wel tilled, will beare also sweet smelling flowers. The slips hereof were set in sundry Italian gardens, & with branches therof I met at Paris, which smelled so sweetely, that I tooke the paines to transport them hi∣ther into England, and to binde them vp in this small nosegay, the which I pray your Ladiship so to accept, as with  humble hearte I present the same. Thus wishing continually the increase of your woorship, with al other things which you would either to you and yours, I ende.
