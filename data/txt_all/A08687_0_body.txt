GReat Britaines great Hope, Parents sprouting Vin
Fathers and Mothers Halfe, by Princely Line,
Wel-nigh vn-pattern'd Patterne of rare Parts,
WhoÌ„, though Few equall, All Loue in their harts:
These Princely Parts, whence had they this great growth
From Fathers Loines or Mothers Paps? From Both.
Be still, (as th' art) Parents Idea right;
Let none thee equall in such Princely Light:
That being Vertues Prince and Principall,
Heauen may Thee Blesse with Blisse Angelicall,
