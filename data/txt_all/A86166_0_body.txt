THou'rt gone, and yet Thou'rt here, to let us see
The pow'r of verse, how't makes Ubiquitie:
Thus th'husbandman away the Harvest bears,
And leavs the Poor to glean som scatter'd ears▪
Thus we enjoy the Tap-wort of thy Muse,
Whilst others quaff off thy Diviner juyce:
That thou wilt drop these Crums, 'tis Comfort yet
To them that Cann't deserve thy Cates to eat;
Thy Dainties are for forreign pallats, wee
Are bless'd with scraps, That too, no thank to thee;
For had not Fate, or Providence thrown us These,
Hunger had been our Fare—and without Ease.
But I have seen thy choycest cheer, and wish
Thy several Arts to th'making up one dish:
Thy rich Composures. I have seen Thee Frame
Varietie in that, which was the same:
But much-good-do't-you Friends! for Wee're not right,
Either in Pallat, or in Appetite.
Ne'r fewer Raptures in an Age, less wit,
Less Judgement, Fancie, Poetry, and yet
Th'unthristy science ne'r more credit gain'd,
Nor Poesie in greater triumph raign'd:
The Laurel fades on Mercenary browes,
But on the neck of Honour spreads her boughes.
When Salary and profit rul'd the Age,
Some few, would, now and then, ride post, a stage;
But Now 'tis otherwise—the Nobler steed
Fames fleetest Coursers, Pegasus own breed
Do stately praunce 'bout Helicons Lov'd Brink,
And at the Muses-Well would daily drink.
The Alteration of the Times is such,
Great ones turn Poets now—and so grow rich.
All witt at Livery stood before, but now
The Gentry are at leisure, a Lord too▪
Can spare his great attendance, whilst hee sits
And Votes—Happy the man 'Can live by's wits.
And such art Thou—
Had'st thou breath'd, then, thine Ayres, so pure and free
Th'adst won the VVench, that now enjoy'st the Tree;
Apollo, then, would ba' been forc'd t' resign,
His Courtship (friend) would have come short of Thine:
The greater favour, thine, I take to bee,
While Hee grasps Her, shee twines Her Arms 'bout Thee.
