SIR,
ALthough none can have so good Title to your Father's Labours as your Self, and the improvement of his Posterity by them was his great desire; yet he did not intend to confine them to his own Family, but his Study tended to the publick good. Amongst those very many and large Volumes Writ∣ten by his own hand, and his Ser∣vants, I made choice thoroughly to revise these Journals, in the Collecting of which, the most indesatigably Industrious Au∣thor imployed much Time, Labour and Cost, constantly endea∣vouring to find out the Truth, and faithfully and impartially relating the same. In his own Preface (to which there needs no other to be added) he doth declare his Credentials and Vouchers̄, and also the Usefulness of the Work. But there are several other good purposes, to which these Journals are very conducible, not par∣ticularly mentioned in his Preface: Yet I shall name but two, The one to be a discovery of the true intent and meaning of some Acts of Parliament of those times which are now controuerted; The other to be a just representation of that Sincerity, Per∣spicuity and Unreseruedness with which the Members of Par∣liament then exprest their Minds and gave their Advice, that there was no difficulty to understand them. The Authority and substantial Excellency of these Collections (especially since the Original Journal Books are not now extant) and their rarity do sufficiently recommend them to all Judicious Persons, and did

abundantly convince me, that I could do no better service to my Country, nor greater Justice to the Memory of my Worthy Uncle, than to publish this Monument of his Fame; Nor do I know how duly to express my thankfulness to you otherwise than by this publick acknowledgement; as of your many other Favours, so in particular for my free access unto, and use of your well stored Library, which hath furnisht me with this opportunity to subscribe my self
