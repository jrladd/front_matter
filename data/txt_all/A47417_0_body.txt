Madam,
ALL who know your Ladyship will easily excuse me for Pub∣lishing this Discourse, if at the same time they are acquainted it is done, in Obedience to your Com∣mand. But did they know the par∣ticular obligations I lie under, they would Tax that modesty, which should suppress it, for ungrateful. Now though I find no small aversion in me to the Publication; yet I find a greater to ingratitude. I have been a Witness of your great Affliction, and if I can do any thing that may be serviceable to you under your pre∣sent loss, and grief, if I can Admi∣nister

comfort to the Mourner, which is a Special act of Christain Charity, I shall be glad of the occasion, and not value the Censure may be justly due to this hasty and indigested Trea∣tise.
That an happiness suitable to your Virtue, and Piety (for I need wish no more) may attend you here, and an infinitely greater crown you here∣after, is the Prayer of,
