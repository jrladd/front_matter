Dread Soveraign,
THat your MAJESTIES great and
Princely Endowments of Nature,
have Arrived to an admired Accom∣plishment
in the Sublimest Art of Govern∣ment,
is doubtless the advantage your Wis∣dome
hath made of Afflictions: The
Sufferings of the same Times, have also en∣abled
your Subjects to a more exact and
fearless Obedience. The very knowledge
of their Enemies, maketh even those other∣wise
lyable to Temptation, to abhor Sediti∣on;
and they are become more circumspect
for Prevention, and by Suffering more suffi∣cient
for Toleration. Having before me two
Royal Patterns, with so many Ilustrious
and Pious Attendants, (together with a

Fathers Example, and daily admonitory
Care the Calamities of the late Times
could not but prove my Benefit. Being in my
Childhood inured to them, Persecutions
for the same Cause (even in these better
Times) are borne with a kind of natural
Fortitude. To be sharply exercised above
Eighteen Years at all Weapons, which
Fanatical Fury could administer to the
Assailants, and that above these last six
Years, they notoriously boast of Victory, by
procuring my Dammages and frequent
Confinements, is so little discouragement,
that by these I seem chiefly to Rise and
Triumph over them. The narrowness of an
Estate or Corporal distress, cannot bate my
delight in an entire Obedience to your Ma∣jesty
and the Church of England, but
are the enlargement of my affections; and I
am still high enough to look down upon mine
Enemies with Pity, and thence afford them

these directions (such as I am furnished with)
to Safety. Nevertheless, when perswasions
and Arguments are rejected, I hope your
Majesties discovering and coercive Felicity
will alway disarme their Rage, and so con∣vince
and protect them. If in the forward∣ness
of my Zeal, I have by any Imbecility in∣jured
a Cause so great, I cast my self by
Supplication for Pardon at your Royal
Feet: Which, that the Almighty be gra∣ciously
pleased to keep and confirm, to
walk on prosperously to length of days in
this World, and Eternity of Glory in the
next, is and shall be the constant Prayer of,
