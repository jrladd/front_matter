THales a wise Phi∣losopher, beeing demaunded what was the hardest thing in the world, aunswered, for a man to know himselfe, beeing then demanded what was the easiest thing, he answered for a man to giue good counsaile vnto another. Both which his resolutions, to the sayde de∣maunds, I may be thought rightly to verify, by this mine enterprise, beeing of so slender iudgment, and young of experience, taking vpon me to discribe vnto the learned and wyse, a forme for their better instruction, wherein many may condemne my selfe, in neglecting the princi∣ples of the same. But (right worshipful, notwithstanding my weaknes) my good meaning, is not heerein altogether to be condemned, who of my selfe am nothing, and can doo nothing, Sed Deus bene facientes adiuuat, God is euer ready to further the good attempts of euery man, his hand is ready to guyde the pen of all that endeuour to

glorifie his name by their dooings, from whom if I should not acknowledge all godly desires to proceede, and attri∣bute the benefit of euery mans godly trauaile vnto his prouident care of our welfare I should not but thinke my selfe an enemy vnto his diuinity. VVherby incurring his heauy displeasure, my trauaile should turne to mine own trouble, and my desired prayse vnto my deserued paines: But for asmuch as Lex domini imaculata est, conuer∣tans animas, testimonium eius fidele sapientiam pre∣staus paruulis. The Law of the Lord beeing vndefiled conuerting the soule, his testimony faithfull and gyuing wisedome euen to the babes and little ones, mine hope is that his hand was the directour of my pen, and his grace the gouernour of my heart in my proceeding: and as my selfe haue had, no small comfort and sweetenes, in the exercise thereof already. And so much as I perswade my selfe it can not be, but likewise beneficiall to such as in eale shall vouchsafe to bestowe some time in the fayth∣full practise thereof. Notwithstanding, some will say there is prayer bookes inough (in my iudgement) not too many, so that they bee consonant and agreeable to that forme of prayer which Christ himselfe sette downe and prescribed, wherein is conteyned sixe petitions or requests vnto God, whereof the three first are for the setting forth of the glory of God, the three last pertayne onely to our owne commodities, as for all thinges necessarye for our bodies for remission of sinnes, and to bee preserued from temptations which concerne the soule, in which sixe pe∣titions, is conteyned the some of all prayers whatsoeuer.

And as it hath beene lawfull for the zealous & godly for their owne godly practise, heeretofore to writ, & the same for the benefit of others allowed to bee published, I pre∣sume, (acknowledging my trauaile altogether inferior to those) to cōmit this my practise to the Print, not deemeing it of my selfe worthy, but by the iudgment of others, lear∣ned, perswaded to consent therevnto, the rather wylling for that my purpose in wryting, and intent in publishing rightly wayed, and the matter duely considered, none (or rather the lesse) by reason of your good countenaunce wyll seeme to vomit out theyr contēptuous termes of the worke or reproches of the poore paintaker, as against the best booke, and most zealous Author that euer wrote, the enui∣ous haue doone, but for mine owne part, I hold me rather woorthy rebuke then reward, for wading so farre into that that belongeth vnto the zealous, learned, and men of most sounde iudgement to sette foorth, and I (beeing as it were ignoraunt) should put before the eyes of such as haue bothe knowledge and wisedome, a glasse or spec∣tacle for their better light and furtheraunce when as (in deede) I should rather repayre vnto them, as blinde, for theyr ayde to direct my selfe. But (right worshipfull) ac∣knowledging my fault heerein (vpon hope of your taking it in good part) I presume to present this my simple tra∣uaile vnto you, taking it in hand with no lesse good mea∣ning vnto the highnes (my light, & guyde) with no lesse good will to you, then he who hath deserued farre bet∣ter for his trauaile, I haue intituled it A pensiue mans practise: and I thinke (not vnfitly) who in my too much

liberty in the seruice of the right worshipfull, Lady Ann Knyuet, your late disceased mother, and my good Lady and Mistresse, spending many dayes in idlenes and voyd of good (but in fryuolous) exercises, among many incly∣ning to theyr owne pleasaunt deuises, considering that S. Ierom sayth that Per publicā viam non ambule∣mus we shoulde not walke after the moste: And weying the sentence of Terence, who sayth (truely) that Om∣nes deteriores sumus licentia, All men are the worsse for too much liberty. I withdrewe me from their so fa∣miliar society, insomuch, as I was thought of some sul∣leyne, of some prowde, of some foolish, and none past with out his verdite of my solitarines, wherevnto vpon these considerations, I had drawne mine vntoward desires, in so much, as by sundry sodaine passions, and greefes of heart, for thinges passed and to come, I was often per∣plexed, the grace of God (onely of his mercy) more preuai∣ling with me, thē an infinite troope of carnall perswasions I betooke me to often & sundry prayers vnto almighty God in all my perplixities, and troubles, with earnest de sire to the reading of that, that most might stirre my dulled and vntoward minde to the desire therevnto, whereby by little and little, feeling a certaine inwarde sweetenes and comfort, to grow in myne heart, by the practise thereof, (the flesh being alwayes repugnant) it began to be of such force, & to my comfort in my neces∣sities, as I thought it a fitte practise in allpensiuenes, a practise in all perplexities most precious, in all distresses most delectable yee in all thynges, in all places, at all

tymes most requisite and comfortable, which (although some wyll condemne my circumstaunce) mooued mee to gyue it the tytle of A pensiue mans practise, which (I speake not to myne owne glory) I woulde that euery one in all extreamityes would vse the same (I meane pray∣er) he should finde comfort therein, yea he shoulde finde (as I know by experience) pleasure in perplexitye, for no thing mooueth sooner desire of inuocation vpon God thē bodely necessities, for the pleasure of the body taketh a∣way the good desire of the soule, we ought to pray for the gyft of the spirite of God, and then shall not our desires depart empty away, a zealous and faythfull inwarde de∣sire, without motion of the tongue in our distresse, sen∣deth vppe euen to the throne of God so sweete a sauour. That euen the holy ghost, in our greatest pensiuenes, wyl∣be most ready to giue assistaunce to our good desires, and wyll bring the same to most wished perfection. But cor∣ruption aboundeth in all men, all men are prone to doo euyll euen by nature, and none there is that dooth good, no not one. The spyryte is often wylling, but the flesh is alwayes weake, we must therefore pray continually, and when we are so dull as that the outward showe dooth ar∣gue insufficient feruency, in vs hauing (yet) a longing desire. Let vs then in hart▪ faythfully say: Oh Lord in∣crease our faith, and let vs bee occupyed in continu∣all contemplation of heauenly thinges, and no doubt but dulnes will soone vanish, and the spirit haue his effecte: for it is not the tongue onely or lippes, that maketh the sacrifice of prayer, sweete and acceptable to God, but an

humbled minde, a contrite and sorrowfull spirit, decly∣ning from sinne, and inclyning to God: wherefore it behooueth vs vnder the burden of our sins, with Dauid to groane in heart, saying, wee haue sinned, we haue doone amisse, we haue dealt wickedly, and in the name of that seconde Adam, let vs pray for power to tread the fruites of the first Adam vnder our feete, for of our selues we are weake, we are of no force to remooue that is euill, or to imbrace and follow that which is good, but all what good is commeth from God, to whom we ought at all times to bend our repentaunt heartes, and pray him for his sweete and welbeloued sonne Iesus Christes sake to shew vs and guide vs, by the working and direction of his holy spirite, the right pathe vnto the kingdome of heauē, that all things▪ as wel ghostly as bodely, may be mi¦nistred vnto vs. It were superfluous to make any great collection of proofes, of the singuler effect of this most ex∣cellent practise, of earnest & faythfull prayer, for praying in the name of Christ, he shall obteyne whatsoeuer hee knoweth needefull for vs, examples whereof are infinite, wherefore, omitting further discourse, I haue sett before euery perticuler prayer, certaine godly motions vnto the prayer following, the rather to induce and stirre vppe the godly minded to the vse thereof: hoping by his assistāce, by (whose these small fruites haue proceeded,) to per∣forme the execution of my small Tallant, to a further benefit of others heereafter: It resteth now (right wor∣shipfull) to pray your fauourable pardon, for presuming to publish the same vnder your good acceptaunce, not

standing in deede, long in suspence, to whose handes firste to committe my trauaile. But your woonted clemencye, wisedome, and zeale, soone stirred my willing minde to present it vnto your selues, dismaid at nothing, but at the simplenes of the painetaker onely, who beeing in all re∣spectes poore, presenteth this day a poore gift, praying par∣don for his boldnes, and lawfull fauour at your handes for his rewarde. And though many be the precious giftes, that this day passe from one to another, and they tende (but as the smallest and simplest) to the remembraunce of the newe yeere, I most humbly beseech your worships wil∣lingly to accept this handfull of cold water, flowing from the fountaine of the well of life, which gift as it is not mine: so I craue but contentation at your hands & wyl∣ling enterteinment of the simple messenger, the presentor heerof, & with him to giue thanks to the heauenly giuer. In whom as all wisdome consisteth, so I humbly pray hym to instill into our hearts, that water of heauenly life, his holy spirite to direct vs al, to perfect perfection in heauē∣ly things for his sons sake, in whose name I hartely wyshe you as a whole & happy new yeere, & many heereafter to his wil, so new ioyes heere, and in the end eternall ioyes of eternall blisse. Westminster. 22. December.
