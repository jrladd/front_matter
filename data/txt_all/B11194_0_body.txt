GEntlewomē, though it is to be feared that your setled wits wil aduisedly cōdemne yt, which my cholloricke vaine hath rashly set downe, and so perchance, ANGER shal reape anger for not agreeing with diseased persons: Yet (if with indiffe∣rencie of censure, you consider of the head of the qua∣rell) I hope you will rather shew your selues defen∣dantes of the defenders title, then complainantes of the plaintifes wrong. I doubt iudgement before trial, which were iniurious to the Law, and I confesse that my rashnesse deserueth no lesse, which was a fit of my extremitie. I will not vrge reasons because your wits are sharp and will soone conceiue my meaning, ne will I be tedious least I prooue too too troublesome, not ouer darke in my writing, for feare of the name of a Ridler. But (in a worde) for my presumption I craue pardon, because it was ANGER that did write it: committing your protection, and my selfe, to the protection of your selues, and the iudgement of the cause to the censures of your iust mindes.
