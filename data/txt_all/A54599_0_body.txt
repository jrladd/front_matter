SIR,
THIS Treatise of the Mines Hum∣bly submits it self to Your Patro∣nage, and the rather, because as I therein observe, at every 70 Years some signal Occurrence revived them to our Me∣mories; for in the sixth of Eliz. after several 70 Years, a German gave us the clearest Guidance to their Conduct; And your HIGHNESSE about 70 Years after made them very useful to his late MA∣JESTIES Martial Affairs during the Civil Wars; and now in time of Peace, we have made choice of you for our Chief Governor to both So∣cieties: But in respect you were not privy to the Grants and Priviledges belonging to us, I conceive this short History or rather Abstract of what con∣cerns us, may be acceptable to you; I confess, they are unfit for your Perusal, were not my Intents more zealously employed upon higher Advantages,
as your Highness may collect from my fisth and sixth Chapters; for I think it requisite that the Countreys and Villages, where such Mines and Minerals are, should be exactly and publickly known, which I shall in time divulge (with the like for Plants) whereby such Metallists, Minera∣lists, Botannists, or other Artists, who have occasion to use them, need not trouble forein parts; for with more ease and as much plenty, they may be suppli∣ed at home. But not to trouble your Highness further, I was under your Command in the late Wars, where I was in part witness to your great Conduct, and Heroick Acts, and I am now once more under your Command in the Affairs of the Mines, whereby I have also observed your incom∣parable skill and general Knowledge in the les∣ser Arts and greater Sciences, worthy of a Prin∣ces Recreation and Study, all in their kind tending to some publick good, and to inspect them no dimi∣nution of Greatness, and in these wherein your Judgement may tonceive my Capacity extend∣able, be pleased freely to Command,
SIR,

Anno 1670.
