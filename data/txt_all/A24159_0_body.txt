SIR,
AS your Commands gave the first being to this Attempt, so 'tis but Justice to offer it to your Self; and 'twas but necessary to crave so advan∣tagious a Protection, to defend it against the Difficulties, things of this Nature meet with, in this Censorious Age.
I shall wave, as less grateful to you, a large Description of the Happiness the Royal Society enjoys under such a Presi∣dent, whose perspicacious Judgment is actu∣ated by a true desire of promoting real Knowledge; and shall rather give some account of the Work it self: It was pre∣sented in a Publique Meeting of the Royal

Society, March 12. 166 ⅞ by Sigr. Lorenzo Magalotti, and Sigr. Paulo Falconieri, from the Most Serene Prince Leopold, Bro∣ther to Ferdinand the Second, Great Duke of Tuscany; and has ever since layn in our Library expecting a more skilful Pen, to perform what I have here aimed at. The Experiments are many, and curious, made under the favour of that Prince, by the Members of the Academy Del Cimento, men of great ingenuity; and related with much sincerity by the Secre∣tary of that Academy; which Society (I hear) is now scatter'd, and the Hopes of those Benefits the Learned World might justly expect from them, frustrated. Many indeed of these Experiments have been made, and shewn in several Meetings of the Royal Society (before, and since the Publication of this in the Italian, in the Year 1667) by the

Honourable Robert Boyle, Esq and other worthy Members thereof; but for all this, I hope it may not prove unacceptable to find the Ingenious in other Parts of the World, have not thought their time mispent in these Endeavours, what contrary Sentiments so∣ever some may have; nor will the agree∣ment between the success of Experiments made there, and what has been attempted here (often with a differing Apparatus) be less plea∣sing▪ very many, I dare undertake, are New to most Persons, except your self, and upon that account will prove more diverting. I need not add the great Expence of Care, and Charge, and Fatigues of the Academy in this Work; nor the scarcity of this Piece in the Original, no small Motive to this Under∣taking (that it might be obtained with more Ease, and at a cheaper Rate;) which how performed, I submit to your Self, and

the worthy Members of the most Illustri∣ous Royal Society; begging Pardon for this Presumption; desiring onely to sub∣scribe my self,
SIR,
