SIR,
WHat Simplicius says of some Beings, that, for the compleating the Order of the Universe, were Cre∣ated, Utriusque nexus mundi: is applicable to that Place you stand in, in this famous Church of Eng∣land, you being, utriusque vinculum Ordinis, the highest of the Inferiour, and nearest Boarder on (what nothing but an un∣parelled Modesty and Self-denyal, could have hindred your ar∣riving to, long ere this, The highest Dignity of the Clergy; You not only knowing, but Ingrossing the Perfections of both. And therefore to one that moves (though its his greatest Honour bet to be ) in the lowest Orb of its Order, as my self doth, (and who is mightily influenced by such great Lights as your self) to have prefixt your Name, (without your Knowledge and Consent) to this Dedication, would have been an unpardonable Crime. But that I know your Candor is so great and generous, as to give a kindly Reception to what ever hath but the Resemblance, much more, to what bears the Rea∣lity of the greatest Truth (as the Subject of the following Dis∣course doth; and that that Comprehensive Charity of yours, which can cover a multitude of Sins in Persons, would not dis∣dain to correct what Faults may drop or flow from my Pen; espe∣cially about a Subject, which is such a substantial Truth, that that Eloquent Father [Lact. Just. de Veritat.] calls it, Pa∣bulum animae. St. John,  That which con∣tains such wounderful Rarities and Super-Excellencies, that it ministreth New Matter of Admiration to the blessed Angels, even in their Beatisick Contemplations and Visions of it; whose Source and Head, like that of Nilus, becomes not only Dark, but to the nearest Approaches (of any Mortals Eye) must darken; as St. Paul declares, 1 Cor. 13.12. . That we have but cloudy Conceptions of it in this
State, the brightest & most illustrious Exhibition whereof, being reserv∣ed to the other; which then we shall there behold , in its Unvailed Face and Appearances. And therefore I am the bolder to expose to publick View, these my Twilight Apprehensions of the Eternal Ʋncreated Truth, under the shadow of those Meridian Ones of yours, most brightly displayed in the visible Representation of the Pillar and Ground of Truth in that Learned and Profound SERMON, on 1 Tim. 3.15. Your Pillar being most firmly built on that Rock, erected on that Basis, which Christ the Amen (in the fol∣lowing Sermon) is described to be. And without Insinuation, Sir, to your most Advanced and Admired Parts; I humbly conceive, you have so unalterably fixt it on its proper Basis, that J. S's Foundation for sure Footing in Christianity, proves but Sandy and Sliding: your Pillar becoming like that of Hercules, a ne plus ultra, to the Romish-Church's, or to any other Local Church's Infallibility. The Ʋniver∣sal, Catholick and Apostolick Church being only Invested with an Au∣thority to Deliver, as is demonstrated, (not to make) New Articles of Faith, and to declare the Ʋnshakenness and Ʋnmoveableness of what it is grounded on) Christ's the Amen's Truth and Ve∣racity.Ground and Pillar of Truth, p. 21. 22. l. 4. 5. So that the Super structure and its Foundation, the Pillar and its Basis being such near and necessary Relatives to each other, that the Former cannot stand without being supported by the Latter. To whose Judgment then, could I better recommend the Survey of the Basis, than to such a Master-Builder's, who so wisely hath Built thereon, as that he needs not be ashamed of his Work. I question not your approving what is positively asserted: (Ground and Pillar, p. 22.) of Christ's the Amen's Spirit, being the fittest and firmest Basis for the Pillar of Truth: I only fear that the Dimensions which I have hewen and roughly cut out, may not be proportionable to it. However, how unpolisht soever they be, when 'tis considered, that they are dugg out of the hardest Rock, (1 Cor. 10.4.) even out of what hath been consolidated from Eternity. I presume on your favourable Accep∣tance of this Dedication of them, not only in respect I may renew to your great Mind, and Contemplative Soul, what's most endearing to it, the Consideration of the greatest Truth; but also, as its a Pub∣lick Testimony of his just Esteem of your great Parts and Piety; and of his being-with all sincerity,
SIR,
