YOur well known
goodnesse which
makes you admired &
praised by every one,
excited long since a de∣sire
in me to testifie un∣to

the world, and your
self, that though a stran∣ger
unto you, yet I was
not such a stranger in
the city, but that I had
heard and taken notice
of your daily pious and
charitable workes. So
that this my translation
being to goe forth into
the view of the world,
I have made bold to de∣dicate
it unto you for
two causes. The first,

my desire to make
knowne unto you that
you had an unknowne
servant, who had long
wished for some op∣portunity
whereby he
might manifest the de∣sire
he had to tender his
service unto you. The
second, to make this
poore worke more ac∣ceptable
to the world,
by prefixing your be∣loved
name in the front

of it, which is greater
in the worlds esteeme,
Quam cui possit invidia
nocere. Your curteous
and noble mind will (I
hope) not disdaine the
gift, though so smal that
it meriteth not so great
a Patron: I promising
ere long to present you
with something which
shall bee mine owne
invention. So wishing
you many happy daies,

fore-runners of eternal
happinesse, I rest,
