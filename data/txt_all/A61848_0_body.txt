YOu were plea∣sed to put me upon that sad service of Preaching at the Funeral of your wor∣thy and dear Pastor; And shortly after that, upon
 another service of Print∣ing what I then had pub∣likely Preached; I con∣fess that I never Preached a Sermon (in this kind) with more grief of heart, and never did I discern a Sermon heard and attend∣ed with more weeping eyes: certainly God had given in unto him the af∣fections of many persons, who loved him in his life, and bitterly lamented him at his death.
I was almost fallen out with the thoughts of pub∣lishing any occasional Sermons, as being most
 proper for scope, and use, and working, to the pre∣sent Auditory: But your general desire hath pre∣vailed upon me to deny my own judgement; and since it must be so, here you have those sudden and weak fruits (such as they are) and the blessing of the Lord go with them.
Of what other advan∣tage they may be (besides the keeping up a while the name and memory of so pretious a servant of Christ) I know not; but yet I trust thar God may
 intend them, and now doth send them abroad for the good of the li∣ving.
Of this I am sure, that every personal change in the world is an effect of his Providence; and that there is a Doctrinal will for the living, in every providential will of God concerning the dead; and the greater that any per∣son is in his relation of usefulness and service∣ableness to Christ and his Church, the more em∣phatical Selah doth the Lord (in the removal of
 him) print out for the children of men.
There was honey found by Sampson in the carcase of the dead Lyon; so are there many sweet instructions and lessons to be gathered, not only out of the lives, but also out of the deaths of the Ministers of Christ. The last Sermon which a people are to study, and diligently to peruse, is the death of their Godly Pastor; for in this God himself doth immediatly preach unto them.
As when Ministers do
 live, it is but hypocrisie to give them only a few good words: so when they dye, it is but a forma∣lity only to shed over them a few sad tears.
O that you your selves, (and the many other Congregations) who of late have carried their Faithful and Laborious Ministers to the grave, would seriously remem∣ber that you must answer God for the quick and for the dead, for your li∣ving Ministers, and for your dead Ministers: there are living uses to be made
 out of dead instances: Live, and live the better, live up to the power of Truth and Godliness, live like such as are even part∣ing with life, and in haz∣zard about a season: Live like such who did enjoy, and who again would en∣joy a choice servant to your Minister.
Though Ministers die, yet Christ lives, and he is present with you, and he observes all your heart and ways: therefore as you formerly have, so now especially strive to abound much more in
 heavenly wisdom, in sound Judgement, in Faith and Love to our Lord Jesus, in meekness, and gentleness, and profi∣tableness one towards another, and in all exact∣ness of holy walking be∣fore your God; hereupon shall you finde your late great loss gratiously sup∣plied in the answer of your fervent prayers: here∣upon shall you finde the testimony of a good con∣science; hereupon shall you finde peace in death, and after that, the Crown of life, which God will give
 to all that love him.
And for other People, let them repent of the evil handling of their Faith∣ful Ministers, and beseech the Lord to give them hearts in their day of Grace, yet to know the things which do concern their Peace; which that we all may do, shall be the prayer of
