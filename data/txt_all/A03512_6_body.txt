STand by your noblest stocke; and euer grow
In loue, and grace of vertue most admir'd;
And we will pay the sacrifice we owe
Of prayre and honour, with all good desir'd
To your diuine soule; that shall euer liue
In height of all blisse prepar'd here beneath,
In that ingenuous and free grace you giue
To knowledge; onely Bulwarke against Death.
VVhose rare sustainers here, her powres sustaine
Hereafter. Such reciprocall effects
Meete in her vertues. VVhere the loue doth raigne,
The Act of knowledge crownes our intellects.
VVhere th'Act, nor Loue is, there, like beasts men die:
Not Life, but Time is their Eternitie.
