Dear Hearts,
YOu love the Lord Iesus Christ, and not him alone, but Christ with all his Train. Great shall be your compensation: for your Love, you shall have Loves, Can. 7. 12. Amores, a plurality, and infinity of Loves which none but God in Christ hath to bestow. The best of his rela∣tions upon earth, have but single Love (and tis happy they have Love) to the Brethren; But Christ hath Loves for the meanest of you, the least of his. May you and all his (in whom there

are yet but buds, scarce visible appear∣ances of Graces) prove fruitful Vines, grow from Buds to Blossoms, from Blossoms to abundance of fruits; That when the Lord shall get up early to visit his Vineyard, you may feast him with pleasant fruits new and old, you may bless him for his Loves of former and latter days, and be ever to him an hum∣ble, holy and thankful, and to his bre∣thren a comforting people. Glory in your habit; you wear the signal Fa∣vours of the King of kings, and Lord of Hosts, the Great and Mighty Je∣hovah, Love: By which I know to whom ye belong, because ye love the Bre∣thren
