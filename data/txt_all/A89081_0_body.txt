To my much honoured Friend, George Bowerman Esquire.
SOme men (not so good as you) might perhaps think that while I have thus long been unfortu∣nately hindred from paying the respects due to your many good Offices and Kindnesses, I have blotted them quite out of my me∣mory,
and become utterly unde∣serving both of them, or any fu∣ture Favour; and there may possibly some Reasons be urged for the entertainment of such suspicions: but I am more than half confident they cannot at all have reached you: for as your Kindnesses were free and un∣constrained, out of your own pure and natural Goodness, so I am bound to believe they were accompanied with a Judg∣ment which cannot easily think it self deceived, because it were both a sin and shame it should be.

And therefore to endeavour the best I can to disperse any such Clouds that may be gather∣ing, I have taken this course to let you perceive that I have preserved a Remembrance of You and your Kindnesses, and am meditating of them, even when you perhaps may believe they are least in my Thoughts; and though this be the misera∣blest way in the World to re∣quite Courtesies, and can no way form an Aquittance for any Obligation, yet at worst 'tis an Acknowledgment, which ge∣nerous
Minds use to receive in good part, and where they find it, think the Defection of a Larger Satisfaction, proceeds rather from Misfortune than Fault.
As such then, Please to accept this small Present I now send you, which when in the Original, was thought worthy of being presented unto the FRENCH KING: and was a Book He Himself passed the License for under His Seal, when He officiated
as His own CHANCEL∣LOƲR.
I will not prevent You with its Contents: Let them speak for themselves. Onely thus much I will say, That in my Judgment it may be as Ʋseful for This Horizon as That for which it was Cal∣culated. And if the Plea∣sant Stories contained in it, shall give You and other Gen∣tlemen that shall peruse it, any Divertisement, I shall have received my Satisfaction,
and have no more to addle, but to beg you to value me still, as one that will ever be,
SIR,
