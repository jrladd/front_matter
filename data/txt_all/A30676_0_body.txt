Sir, and Madam,
I Foresee there may two or three questions arise upon this my undertaking, in which you may desire satisfaction; the first may be, why I write at all? the second, why I write on this subject? and the last, why I pre∣fix your Names to what I write? To these I shall answer in order: For the first, though I hope Gods glory and the publique good, be chiefly intended, yet my own satisfaction is also included; for I being set apart in my Edu∣cation for the work of the Ministry, and de∣dicated thereunto in my Ordination; and though I have but one talent, I would not have it wrapt in a napkin, when an account is required how I have employed it, lest I be
 found speechless, Aulaedus sit, qui Citharaedus es∣se non potest, a man may be useful that is not excellent, and therefore I thought it my du∣ty what howrs I could spare from my secular employments, should be improved, and em∣ployed for the good of souls: as for your se∣cond demand, why I write upon this subject, seeing so many have gone before me, and what I do is but Alcinoo pomo dare, or in our English dialect, to light a candle when the sun shines, or bring coals to Newcastle? to this I answer, if this lesson be so well taught, it is a shame it is no better learnt: I fear there is not one of ten amongst Christians, but are guilty of the neglect of this profitable duty, which I suppose would bring the soul more real benefit, then many litigious controver∣sies about the modes and circumstances of worship, about which many argue themselves not only out of Charity, but out of their Christianity, and lose the substance, while they strive about the shadow, and fill their heads with notions, rather then their hearts with graces: I conceive it is real communion with Christ, and the life of faith, that makes the soul fat and flourishing, and I think that meditation doth conduce as much to this as a∣ny duty whatsoever: prayer I know brings in supplys from heaven, and so doth this; and these two usually are concomitant, and where the one is neglected, the other is sel∣dome
 well performed: Meditation like the Bee fetches honey both from flowers and weeds, yea, this divine Alchymist extracts gold out of the coursest Mettles, and is the true Philosophers stone that turns all into gold, and gold it self into a spiritual substance; those books which reduce religion into pra∣ctice (which in our days lyes much in the theorick) and serve to reconcile the head and the heart, and maintain the vitals of religion, and the power of godliness, and further our great designe for heaven, should be well studi∣ed, and of them I think store is no sore: By this heavenly art of divine meditation, wisdome may be extracted out of folly, as Solomon gain∣ed instruction by beholding the field of the sluggard, Pro. 24.30. &c. and doubtless man was not plac't in the world as Leviathan in the Sea, to play therein; nor indowed with so many excellent faculties to be like bruit beasts, only idle spectatours of the works of God; The use of reason doubtless was given for an higher end, to help us to view the Creator in the glass of the creature, and every thing lends a helping hand to a wil∣ling minde in this work; There is no man so busy if not sinfully employed, but may finde some time every day to converse with God, and now and then make a journey to heaven, and view those Caelestial mansi∣ons prepared for those that love God; There
 is none so dull-witted, if honest hearted, but may learn some profitable lessons in na∣tures school; the least worm or gnat, or leaf of a tree, will point out God, to an ob∣servant Christian: That Meditation is a Christian duty; none that pretend to religion or to reason it self, will deny, and that to meditate upon Gods works as well as his word, is our duty, is evident; God some∣times sends us to the oxe, and ass, to learn our duty, Jsay. 1.3. sometimes to fowls of heaven, the stork, the crane, and the swal∣low, Jer. 8.7. sometimes to the pismire or ant, those despicable insects, Pro. 6.6. and 30.25. and all to learn our duty; David learned humility by beholding the moon and the stars, Psal. 8.3, 4. and Christ grounds many of his excellent sermons upon the va∣rious occurrences that dayly fell out, as we see in the parable of the sower and the seed, the tares of the field, and the draw∣net cast into the Sea, the leaven, the mu∣stard seed, the fruitless figtree, and many o∣thers: what heavenly use doth he make of earthly things, and all this is for our imi∣tation, that by this means we may of these earthly materials frame to our selves a Ja∣cobs ladder to ascend to heaven; for all those visibles will mount us up to beholde invisi∣bles, and give us a Pisgah sight of the hea∣venly Canaan, even of those things within
 the vail: And that soul that hath this hea∣venly art, can set it self on work, and need not be idle or ill imployed, for time will fail us, and death surprize us, before we can have searched natures garden from end to end, or gathered hony from the several flowers: here we may walk at liberty, and crop what flowers we please, and no man is damnified thereby; in other respects our bounds are set, hitherto may we go and no further, but in this we have an unli∣mitted circuit: meum & tuum, which hath set the world in a flame, hinders not in this case, the poor here hath as much li∣berty as the rich, and the servant as his master, for with the Bee we may suck sweet∣ness from our neighbours fields and flowers, without his leave or licence, and feed up∣on his pasture without any dammage to him; 'Tis true in these my meditations I have contented my self with a small plot, and but seldome past the bounds of a garden or orchard, but had the publishing of it been designed at the first, I should not have ti∣ed up my self in so short a lether, when the whole creation lay before me; The book of the creature stands open to us, and God may be read in every line of it, o∣therwise why doth God discover to us the state of the fallen angels, and of the rich glutton, and the state of the damned, if no
 profitable use could be made of it: no place is so barren as a barren heart, each dead tree will yield some fruit to us, if the soul be not dead: I have pluckt here and there a flower, as others have done before me, and he that comes after us may finde as good as any we have gotten: Those I have gathered are rather to comfort the heart, then to please the fancy, rather to benefit the soul with their vertue, then to please the eye with their beauty; their nature (if I mistake them not) is to draw the heart and affections to God, and cool and deadden it to the world and sin; But a gracious heart is then required to make the extracti∣on, for if it be mixt with the dregs of hy∣pocrisy it will prove useless: The hypo∣crite like a puppet in a play, may counter∣feit mans shape and gestures, yea, like a parrat his voice, when he understands not what he saith or doth, yea, such a one mars all he sets his hands to; but a good man hath an holy heart, as well as a holy tongue, and this will prove a soul-satting Ordinance to such a man; this will raise up the heart to hoaven, which is one of our surest evidences for heaven; If any yet pleade, there are too many books on this subject extant already, the more shame for us then that the duty is so much neg∣lected, that is not sufficiently taught, that
 is not sufficiently learnt, and I fear those that are readiest to make the objection, are not the most conscientious in the perfor∣mance of the duty: There are many that make conscience of morning and evening prayers in their families, that spend little time in this duty; if any quarrel at the language these meditations speak, let them know, my designe is, to make men live bet∣ter, and not to make them speak better; if they speak the language of Canaan they will be understood by true Israelites, and will be owned by those that had rather be fed then flattered; it is a distempered sto∣mack that must be fed with kickshaws, truth looks best in the plainest dress, and a dia∣mond needs no painting, via trita est via tu∣ta, and plain sence is the best orthography of an honest heart. In short, the reason why I write upon this subject is, not to please mens humours, or satisfy squeasy sto∣macks, but because I judge this to be a ne∣cessary, though much neglected duty, and therefore most necessary to be treated of.
As for the last of your demands, why I prae∣fix your names to it, I think there are none that knows both you and me, and my en∣gagements to you, that need stumble at it; but I shall answer it, first negatively, and then affirmatively, I do it not, because I think you have more need of it then
 others, for I know but few better able then you to gather such flowers as these for your selves; But it is, because I think you are better able to judge of it then most are, and if you think I have not mist my way, I care not much what those say, that never travailed in this road: I speak to those that understand the language, for to others, haply I may seem a barbarian: A hypo∣crite may pretend to the language, but un∣derstands it not, he spoils this as well as all his other duties; I present this first to you, for if it pass this text, I matter not much what many others say of it; And also that thereby I may tell the world, ra∣ther then you, what my thoughts are of you, and to point them out a pattern for their imitation; for I verily believe, and I think upon serious observation, that the se∣veral branches of both your families, do maintain the vitals of religion, and the pow¦er of godliness in as eminent a manner, as any family of your rank that I know in the Nation, and keep themselves as unspotted in the world, and as free from the conta∣gious diseases of the times: And he that is the searcher of all hearts, knows, I speak my thoughts without flattery or fauning, and I do it for no sinister end: but (as So∣lomon did commend the good huswife, Pro. 31.29. that God may be glorifyed for his
 bounty to you, and your hands may be strengthned in well doing, and others may take example by you, and your lives may be for their imitation. I cannot praise my present any further, then from the truth of the heart that sends it; had it been bet∣ter, it had been sent with a better will: I send it as a poor man doth a present to his superiour, not to supply his wants, but to manifest his love, thankfulness and depen∣dence upon him; or as a debtor to his cre∣ditor, who when he cannot pay the debt, pays the interest, or at least testifyes his willingness, if ability be wanting: What I have done in this my undertaking, I judged to be my duty; David bids us, commune with our own hearts, Psal. 4.4. and he calls upon others, Psal. 66.16. come and hear all ye that fear the Lord, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul: I have not the con∣fidence to think, that this or any thing I can do can pass the test of this critical age, or indeed can contribute much to the adorn∣ing of the spouse of Christ, I know a hand∣full of goats-hair was not formerly rejected, neither will a cup of cold water where there is no better, nor two mites where there is no more, by him from whom I expect my reward: When you can write fairer then the Copy which will quickly be, you may lay it aside, and give it to some one
 that cannot, for whose sake it was chiefly written: but that it may prove beneficial both to you, and yours, and to the Church of God, for the advancing of the the pow∣er of godliness, and the life of religion, and the restoring this too much neglected duty of holy meditation, shall be, and is, the desire and prayer of him, who is
