Courteous and friendly Reader,
FOr so my believing charitie perswadeth me to style you, although my mean and inconsiderable deserts cannot hope to lay claim to the title;
As it is a certaine truth for our comfort, that man's passive extremitie, is Gods active opportunitie, deliverance then stepping in, when in our apprehensions were are past hopes of being delivered; so it is as necessary a truth to be practised, that when Kingdomes, Cities, Fa∣milies or friends are most passive under the extremitie of accumulative miseries, threatning ruine and desolation; then to be most active in our assistance counsell, and to our power, deliverance. Such like thoughts as these possessing me in these unhappiest of unhappy times, wherein a generally-feared destruction hangeth over our heads like a sharp pointed sword, only by a small thread, perswaded me with the poore widow (my abilities not being able to bestow more) to cast in this my following mite; and if it shall (though in it selfe worthlesse) prove by the con∣curring operation of Gods Spirit upon the hearts of men, in the least manner, instrumentally contributary to the reformation of some, infor∣mation of others, and a desired restoration of the whole Kingdome in ge∣nerall, the City of London in particular, where I received my first birth and being, to their ancient honour, and former truth and peace, return your thankes to the Lord of heaven and earth, the fountaine of all Meroies, and pray for the Eternall happinesse of:

Maii prim. 1648.
