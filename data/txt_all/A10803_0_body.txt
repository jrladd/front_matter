ALEXANDER (Right Worshipfull) amongest men greatest on the earth, ceasing his hard toile frō pursuit of his enemies, he held no recreation in such account, as reading of histories, especially such as treated of the honours gained by noble warri∣ours long before his time entombed in the intralles of the earth: wherein his delight was as much as in maniging his steed, or shiuering his lance in the midst of his foes.
SCIPIO that noble Romaine which subdued ma∣nie nations had no small delight in the like exercise: no∣ting by reading the euentes of war, and pleasant baites of fortune, how Warriours gained honor: and then a∣gaine how they were subdued: the mighty kings by pe∣santes and men of base account displaced, and the ig∣noble exalted, changing all estates at her pleasure. This Fortune (of the Poets fained a Goddesse) hauing the

raigne of all estates in her hand, disposeth like a blind guide, at her wil, setting vp and pulling down, whom she list to ouerthrowe or aduance.
An example of which (right Wor.) I present to you in this historie, wherein you shall see her mutabilitie, shewing continuallie her froward & vnconstant mind, in crossing that noble and vnhappie prince Andrugio, sometime Duke of Saxonie, whose miseries exceeded al that euer I read or heard of: from the sixteenth yeare of his age neuer inioieng long time of content accor∣ding to his estate, but manie daies spent he in extreame miserie, as the historie of his life shal manifest, to which I leaue you: humbly beseeching your Worship to shield it vnder your protection, and when time shall permit you leasure, vouchsafe the reading of it, in which I doubt not (albeit the style be rude) but that you shall finde something to delight you.
And if it so happen, I haue my wish, and the long desire I haue had to make my zeale knowne vnto your worship, in som sort is satisfied.
