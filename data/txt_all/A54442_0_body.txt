BEhold, Great Sir, a Champion of your own moulding; and tho' not altogether of the growth, yet the perfect Manufacture of France. For in your Court he had his Education, and learnt his first Rudiments of War, under one of your greatest Generals, who God rest his Soul, was curs'd in his Mothers belly, as being kill'd with a Cannon Bullet, upon the Dry Land. 'Tis true, that once upon a time, you felt to your sorrow, the puissance of this are adful Cham∣pions Arm; but that Brush being over, and all things reconcil'd, he has ever since most Cor∣dially and Strenuously fought all along for your Interest and Exaltation. He abandon'd the Re∣ligion of his Fathers, and Embrac'd the Ido∣latry of his Mothers to make you Great, aad run through Fire and Water to serve your turns: and I humbly submit it to your incompara∣ble Judgment whether those two Elements, as your Champion managed them, did not con∣tribute
 very much to the Advancement of your Great Designs. These things you consi∣der'd, and told him that your Interest and his were so clearly link'd together, that they who oppos'd the one should be look't upon as Enemies to the other. Vouchsafe then Great Sir, kindly to entertain him, returning to your Country laden with Renown and the Spoils of your Enemies; and if not in con∣sideration of his Immortal Exploites, yet for the sake of his and your most beloved Messa∣lina, bestow upon him one Corner of the Vast Pasty of your Conquests, for him to rest his Limbs grown Old and Enfeebl'd with the Toyls and Hardships of those many Combats which he has undertaken in your Quarrel. Such a Grateful Generosity will oblige both us and all your Votaries to pray, that your Suc∣cesses for the future may be all like his, and that you may prosper in all your enterprizes as hitherto he has done.
