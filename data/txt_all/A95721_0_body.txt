My Lord,
AMong those many mercies which our good God in the happy Restoration of his sacred Majesty, hath poured upon this unworthy Nation; it is look'd upon by some pious and judicious persons as none of the least, yea rather,
 as one of the greatest, that his Maje∣sty hath placed such Iudges over us, who understand both Law and Gospel, and are able not only to administer Iustice and Iudgement to the people in their Ci∣vil Causes, but to be guides and examples to them in their devotions and addresses to God.
It was no small comfort to me, being by the Providence of God called to this service, and directed to this argument, that I found your Lordship such a practi∣cal Auditor, recommending my mean discourse to the better consideration of the people, by your exemplar reverence in the House of God: And I have the sooner digested the Obloquy which was cast upon these weak pieces, when I saw the duty which they pointed at (Reve∣rence in Divine Worship) was so well
 known, and so evidently performed (be∣side your self) by so many learned, and pious, and honourable persons.
Many and sore were the evils which lay upon this Church of England in our late troubles; and although our chief cor∣dolium arose, that we see some of the fun∣damentals of our Religion undermin'd and shaken, it could not but beget some sighs and sad thoughts in us, to hear the circumstantials so decryed and despised, as if Divine Worship consisted only in our hearts and spirits, and it had been super∣stition in any respect to have glorified God with our bodies.
It was an ingenuous concession of Mr Calvin in the case of Ceremonies, that if they were few in number, easie to be ob∣served, and clear in their signification, they might juvare rudiorum imperiti∣am,
 assist the weakness of the ruder sort of people, and that they would conduce, Christum illustrare, to make Christ better known to them.
And certainly the devout and reve∣rend servants of God, in the various and humble postures and gestures of their bo∣dies in Divine Worship, have no other design, but to testifie that awful sence which they have of an extraordinary presence of God in Holy Assemblies, by them to instruct and edifie the ignorant, and to prepare them for their more so∣lemn approaches to the Throne of grace.
It was judiciously said by a late learn∣ed man, that reverence was the pale of Religion; if that pale be broken down, the Roes and the Hinds of the field, as Solomon calls them, weak and unstable souls will break out, and wander into pro∣faneness
 and Atheism, and in a short time forget that God whom they see worship'd in such a sleight and homely manner.
Wherefore we have cause to bless the Lord, that notwithstanding the Sectaries (like wild Boars) were so long foraging in his Vineyard which he had planted here amongst us, and had well neer laid it waste, by destroying the Dressers, and rooting out those goodly plants of Order and Decency, and Ʋniformity, he hath yet preserved an holy seed who know him, and fear him, and come with hearts and bodies to sanctifie him, at what time, or in what places soever they draw neer to him.
It is the joy of our hearts, notwith∣standing we live so far remote from the Imperial City, to hear of the signal re∣verence
 of his Sacred Majesty in ho∣ly Worship, and it is our wish, that his pious example may have such an influ∣ence upon the Nation, that this Church of England which was so lately black∣ned by her own intestine troubles, may recover her former comeliness, and be∣come once more a praise on the Earth.
Our expectations of this happiness are somewhat raised, since we see the E∣piscopal Chairs, and the Seats of Iudica∣ture fill'd with such eminent persons, who have given so ample testimony of their Loyalty to their King, and their con∣stancy to their Religion.
My Lord, I am a poor stranger to you, I had not the happiness (to my best remembrance) ever to see your face, till I met you in the House of God, and af∣terward received from your Lordship
 that more then sufficient reward, a very candid signification of your acceptance of my well-meant labours. And I hum∣bly and heartily congratulate to you your Honour, that by the favour of your Prince, you shine in the Orb of Iustice, and are such an illustrious (and yet be∣nevolent) star in that (Now) glittering Constellation.
Good luck have you with your Honor, and may you ride on prosperously (as you have begun) judging the Tribes of England in Truth, and Meekness, and Righteousness; and may he, whose name is, The Councellour, be continu∣ally assistant to you; may you grow old & honourable in the service of your Country and your King, and your God; and then, when your Change shall come, your com∣fort and assurance will be so much the
 greater, that you shall be translated and adscited into the number of those, who shall sit upon Thrones, judging the Tribes of Israel. These hopes and wishes shall be constantly and fervently seconded by the prayers of,
My Lord,
