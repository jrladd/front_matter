ALthough your worthinesse may seeme in all mens iudgements to merit a more polisht stile, or better contriued plot, then you are likely to finde here: yet that my affection may bee somewhat answerable to your great deseruings, I make bold to tender you this youngling Poesie: which for the worth is not equiualent to your dignitie, yet being the first fruites of my labours, I trust will be accepted of you; which if I finde, when my riper yeares shall attaine to better knowledge, I will endeuour to make my proceedings an∣swere

more fully to your merits. Till then let this slender worke be a true signall of the du∣tious affection I beare you, which to augment, I will endeuour continually.
