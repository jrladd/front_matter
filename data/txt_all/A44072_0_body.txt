Honoured Sir,
THE many Charities and Benefacti∣ons of Sir Peter Wentworth your Brother in his Life-time, and the ma∣ny considerable Legacies he left to Ministers at his Death, and particularly that to my self, all paid by you with such speed and inte∣grity, together with your own love to Learn∣ing, manifested by the Settlement you have made upon the School at Northampton, and by your Love and Respects to good Ministers may be a sufficient Apology for my prefixing your Name to this Paper, which contains the substance of a Sermon sometime preached to the Ʋniversity of Cambridge, concerning The Necessity, Dignity and Duty of Gos∣pel Ministers.
Sir, may you long live a Pattern of good Works, and a Patron of good Men; and when you die may you leave a Name behind
 you better than of Sons and Daughters. May your Name and Memory be like the re∣membrance of good Josiah, Eccles. 49. like the composition of the Perfume, made by the Art of the Apothecary, sweet as Honey in the Mouth of all that speak of you, and as Mu∣sick at a Banquet of Wine in the Ears of all that hear of you.
Which is the hearty desire of Worthy SIR,
