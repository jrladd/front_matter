THe knowledge of your growing vir∣tues, have begot in all men love, in me admiration, and a desire to serve the manifold obligations I have to the true Example of worth Cap∣taine Endemion Porter, instructed me to this pre∣sentation of my devoted respects to your noble selves, the true Ideas of his virtues. You are so equall in all the attributes of goodnesse, that it were a difficult in∣deavor for mee to distinguish betweene your per∣fections: Onely noble Captaine that prioraty which your birth has allowed you, ingages me in the first place to tender my service to your selfe, which I im∣agin'd could not have beene really accomplish'd, had I not joynd your brother in this act of my gratitude to you. Accept therefore heroicke paire of brothers, this tender of his best devotions▪ to you who has no greater ambition then to be esteemed,
