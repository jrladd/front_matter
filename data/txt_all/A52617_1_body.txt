Most Serene Prince,
I Have undertaken to write this History, not out of any vain design to publish my own name, but by an impulse not unworthy commendation, to eternize my duty to my Country, where it having pleased God to give me my birth, and make me partaker of its liberty, I have thought it a small thing to dedicate to it the short moments of my life, if I could not find out some way be∣sides to continue my obedience even after my death, and leave a monument to my fellow Citizens, and the World, of the famous actions and signal deservings of so high and mighty a Common-wealth. This Work was begun amidst the fatigue and labour of many other employments, and for the most part in Ambassies in Foreign Courts and Coun∣tries, and would have run the hazard amidst the distracti∣ons and the management thereof, of having been destroy∣ed even as soon as it was conceived, if by stealing time from my rest, and rest from my self, I had not taken pains to present it at last at the feet of your Serenity.
Your Serenity ought in justice to accept it because you commanded it, and in your goodness to bear with it; and its faults may appear more innocent, and many of its defects excusable, whilst in place of that honest leisure and quiet which study requires, I was obliged to suspend my Pen, as often as my Country was pleased to require from me, in several occasions, the usufruit both of my life and endea∣vours: I have taken Truth for my Guide, as being the soul of History, and a duty which ought to be stipulated by every Writer with God and Man.
This I may say, that I have not wanted courage to speak

it, nor means to discern it. Because, besides the Writings of so many (though some not sufficiently instructed in the knowledge of things, or free from passion, have preferred the sparing of truth before silence;) the access to Princes, the negotiating with Publick Ministers, discourse with those who were the Actors of the things most remarkable, the view of situations and places, have fully informed me with what passed abroad; I have had means to be instructed at home, not only by the free access to our publick Records, and the most secret Counsels, but because they have been managed in a good part by my Ancestors and Relations, and some of them by my self. Nevertheless I have not suffered my self to be defiled with partiality, but passing by the priviledge of venerable antiquity, which to a face of Truth hath another closely adjoining, that of Falshood; I have chosen to expose my self to tryal, and perhaps to reproof, and that I might render a testimony of more au∣thority to posterity, to write of the present Age to the Age it self.
I know it is a sacred thing to compose Histories, and not to be undertaken but with an upright mind and undefiled hands; and that for that cause the memory of them was consigned to the Temple, under the faithful custody of the Chief Priests, as the witness or trust of those that went be∣fore, and the treasure of those that should come after, not to be handled but as a religious thing, and with great cau∣tion. In sum, the Historian taking to himself an absolute Dictatorship, nay an authority more than humane, over times, persons, and actions, governs fame, measures desert, pene∣trates intentions, discloses secrets, is, with an undistinguish∣ed arbitrement over Kings and People, the Judge of Ages past, and Master of those to come, absolves or punishes, deceives or instructs. Whence, not without reason, the Pen of Writers may be compared to that Lightning, which striking out but one Letter from the Name, Caesar Augustus, made him a God; because praise is a thing so tender, that one dash makes illustrious and a little blot infamous, and the censure of the world thereupon is so severe, that it either con∣secrates to eternity or proscribes to infamy. For my self,

Most Excellent Prince, I know not what else to wish, but that every one would take upon him to read this work with the same disinterest and innocent mind with which I have writ it, confining my confidence to this one thing, that the present Age will not be so unjust to me, nor so ungrateful to posterity, as to deny me the opinion of sincerity, and the merit of obedience.
For the rest, the August name of your Serenity, which will be one of the principal subjects of my ensuing labour, when I shall come to adorn it with the years made signal by your glorious Government, is chosen the Tutelar Deity of this first part, to that end the work may defended by the shadow of your protection at present, as it will in a little time be made famous by the splendour of your Heroick Virtues, which being acknowledged by this our Age for pe∣culiar gifts from Heaven to our Country, will be reveren∣ced in time to come, as Examples in a free Common-wealth of a great Patriot, and a greater Prince. I presume not to insert my private observances towards your Serenity, amidst the publick considerations of my duty: I only implore a benign reflection of your powerful approbation, as a comfortable Ray of that fortune, with which your Sereni∣ty, Governing with happiness and wisdom, after glory got∣ten in the dangers of so long a War, shall confirm with Victory and Peace, perpetuity and security to our Country.
