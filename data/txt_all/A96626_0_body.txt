Deare Soules,

TO let you know that one as truely now
Forgets himselfe, as he remembers you,
I heare present you with I know not what,
To doe you service.â€”
What though some rotten Upstart swell, what then?
So you take't friendly, what care I for them.
But would you know this-Sir that's hre intended.
His titles what, and whence he is descended;
Then know they call this Gent. sprung from a Fig,
The blew-new-made one and Times Whirligig:
Titles sufficient to make him a flaunting,
And now-time-Gallant (tho true worth be wanting)
But that which workes in me the greatest marvell.
Is how beholding you are for his travell;
You above all the rest, nowfie upon it,
You he must serve though he look blewly on it;
And well the foole may so which comes to you,
In whom there's such antipathy to blew;
Yet if you but consider him the same,
That he deserves by playing of his Game,
And how he flourishes you'l judge the toole
Then by your leave to be more knave then foole;
How ere he be (brave Sirs) for that I know
You only are, were, must, and shall be so,
He comes to kisse your hands, and hopes that you
Will give him Quarter for a night or two,

 And afterwards if so you thinke it fit
To burne him, doe, or teare him every bit,
Wishing poore Englands Tyrants all so us'd,
That have so many honest men abus'd;
And that is all, and that is scarce enough,
For them or this drest up in such a stuffe.
