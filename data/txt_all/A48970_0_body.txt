GENTLEMEN, (For such should be Scholars, and Scholars
are no less,)
THis Work seems of right to chal∣lenge your protection: The
true Nobleness, Virtue, Learning and Wisdome of many I know, has brib'd me
to honour your re∣membrance, and bring my endea∣vours to the test of your
sober and judicious Judgments; which if accepted and candidly interpre∣ted,
in earnest, it's all I expect and crave; nor shall I valuewhat
others disprove, if you do but approve of my inten∣tion: Nobility of Blood,
Gentlemen, is but the fruits and effects of Learning, and culture of
the mind, where∣by the Country has ever tasted the sweet fruits thereof:
and thus Virtue and Honour become Rivals, when vice and baseness become
extinct: Honours and Titles, are but attendants on the most Noble deserts
of a Learned and virtuous mind; nor can they be accounted above Apparel and
Drapery to a comely person; for true Gen∣tility hangeth not upon the Nothing
of vulgar applause, but is absolute in it self: I remember a story of
Doctor of the Civil Law, that having Knighthood hung to his Estate by
Sigismund the Emperour, presently accounted the Society of his
fellow Doctors at a cheap rate, only valuing Knights as most fit consorts
for his new Degree; for which great folly he was publikely accosted at the
Counsel of Constance by the Emperour in these words; Fool
who preferrest Knighthood before Learning, the gingles of Fame before that
true worth of the mind; I can coin a thousand Knights in one day, but cannot
one Doctor in a thousand years. You may imagin he wisht himself out
of the Senate: Such men are not wanting in all ages, that overvalue their
fortune, and undervalue their best and truest riches; which I hope is not a
fault that sticks to your more sober and solid esteem of
Knowledg and Learn∣ing. To be endowed with both, is that
(Gentlemen) which priviledges your free access to the Title of
Honour, and proclaims you the very Honour of your Country.
But if there be any so unfortunate, as naturally to fall under
the Rank of my Dedication, and are not poised with apt endowments for the
service of their Country for want of Learning and Knowledg;
or not using both to the best end; I am sorry to think how they disrobe
themselves of that Title which by birth they claim: For either
Reason mocks me, or else I think to be born a Gentleman (and not bred a
Scholar, nor studiously bent to gain Knowledg by study and reading,) may
well in∣vest him in his Fathers Lands, whilest he is uncapable to govern
himself as he should, or his Country as it must be; and is a greater
blemish to the true Honour of a Gentleman, then the vastness of an
Estate can compen∣sate; for though hereby a man may be Richly
respected, yet is he not honoured for that true Worth, which is ri∣veted in
by Learning and Knowledg; which indeed are additions beyond
Nobility of Birth or Honour of Blood. without them its but a glorious
Ignorance: and therefore it is accounted amongst the most Judicious
Rusticks sim∣plicity, to take the gayest Courtier for the Wisest man,
though the latter wears the more gorgeous and rich Ap∣parell, that of the mind:
in as much as Riches are only the Ornaments to Gentility, whereas
Learning and Know∣ledg is the Essence, and true
being of a Gentleman. Yet must we not forget, that there is a true Worth to
be found Accomplisht by the 
Elsewhere enlarged.
study of Books, where Learn∣ing never advanc't: but where
Learning meets with a Generous and Brave mind, all must needs
acknowledg and bow to him with respect: These are the best Instru∣ments
to open the Veins of true Worth and Wisdome, as well as the Seal and Stamp of
Double Honour: so that if wrong education have produc't Ignorance in some
Gentlemen, yet may they here make up that defect, by their Industry in
seeking after Knowledg above that of Pleasure or Vice; which will
install them into the Privi∣ledg of their naturall Birth.
What need then Gentlemen, is there to Read and study
Books, whereby to gain so great a Purchase; TheAdvantages of
Translations of History, &c. from the La∣tin, Italian,
French, &c. the neglect of which (to such Gentlemen as have been
so unfortunately dealt with by their Parents, as not to know other Languages
then their own) is the grand Reason that many of great Estates, can hardly
make their mindes or thoughts, stretch to a Geometricall measuring of their
own Lands: thus too many idly sit down in the Chaire of Ignorance, travelling
by the fire side, with the Wandering Knight Sr John
Mandevil, or it may be Bevis of Southhampton; whilest the Laws
of Nations, admirable foundations of Common-wealths, pass undiscovered or
dived into. Others, Hunt and Range, and hope to hit it to a Hair.
These are Escapes somewhat too hard for excuse in the Gentry; who
certainly, if any be, they are born for better and more Noble ends then the
Vulgar; there are sparks and seeds, which are naturall Plants in the minds
of Gen∣tlemen, that in others seem not to be known; and for these to take
any growth than according to their naturall tendency to Learning,
Generosity, Urbanity, Knowledg, &c. is a greater pity than can be
expressed. It's noysed of Alexander the Great, that he had
Virtues by Nature, and Vice by Accident. Let Tinkers and vulgar Brains, drown
and soak their meaner wits and conceptions, in draining a Country Alehouse.
Let Gentlemen seek their own Honour, and blazon their own Reputation, by
their Noble and brave deportment; which is only to be ac∣complished by
Study, Reading, and converse with Discreet and Wise men; and
thus may you prove Thorns in the way of Wickedness, rather than Supporters
and nourish∣ers of Debauched courses, to the ruine of your own For∣tunes,
and blush of your Relations: Thus may you strive to recover your selves
from the Tyranny of commonEducation, which lies now much in wearing
fine cloathes, eating, sleeping, drinking, and know nothing above the degree
of common and low understanding; many being only by their rude demeanours,
the constables slaves and a derision to all, drowning those parts,
bestowed with their Parents cost, and it may be purchased with the
sweat of their own Industry: thus like high spirited Horses that beat
out their fiery lives in their own litters. Pure oyle cannot mingle with water,
nor the extracted Quintessence of true nobleness (in a right Gentleman)
with the dregs and subsistence of unworthiness; and this is all the
harm I wish to the Gentry of these parts: who I hope are more ge∣nerous
then to storm at what I say, or exile this Councell and advice, by a
prejudicate acception. I love not to be so unnaturall to my own relation, as
to blemish the name of a Gentleman, because so; I hope I am not so ill
read in Ethicks, as to blot others and defile my own nest; such thoughts I
beg may have no roome to step over the threshold of your entertainment; let
them harbour only in base and degenerous breasts▪ what I say,
desire, and in this work design; I do really profess to be only intended,
for the ge∣nerall good of these parts, which I hope wise men will see and
so Judg.
These thoughts create in me, aswell as in others, a great fear
of a dearth of Knowledg, for want of study, whereby we shall have
little of Nobility or Gentry left, but that of Birth and Pedegree quod omen
Deus avertat. Those that are not equally fitted for the use of their
Country, as well as themselves, are only to be accounted stakes in ditches
that rot rather then grow.
These Counties recorded for Honour, have not been yet worthy to
be branded with any thing, that could truly stick to them so much, as the
present want of StudiousGentlemen; and though I reckon
Learning of late daies, to be that which the misery of these
Tempestuous winds of a civil War, (worse then Euroclydon that
troubled Paul) hath made too great a stranger to these parts, yet
now it seems to plead for it self, by the generous education of ve∣ry many
hopefull branches, from good families: whereby I hope these Counties will
call back the Ancient daies, when by their valour and noblenesse, they
seemed to at∣tract the Estimation of all the rest to themselves.
Chro∣nicles will free me from the least tincture of flattery, if a∣ny think I
am beyond the bounds, either of sincerity or truth.
For the next order of such as I boldly beg leave:
Gen∣tlemen you are such as (Indeed ought, and amongst the best
of Men and Christians) are dignified with the largest respect, and that
as by your Knowledg and Learning in the best things, you
are made capable to instruct others, so are you also thereby fitted to
receive advice, in as much as true knowledg puffs not up: Yet will I not
undertake to direct, but wish you may on all occasions, promote the
ge∣nerall designe of Learning and Knowledg: which may be
much gained upon and improved, by Reading and Study∣ing;
encouraging, and helping, such as desire it, and prompt others to it; you
know the great advantage that's to be got by reading; besides it will make
mens minds so pliable and beget such a reducement, as that they need not
alwaies beat as on an Anvill: for you have more to do to peice a dull and
ignorant understanding, then one more already verst in some
Knowledg; this will break a way for your more facile aproach to the
very hearts of men.
For such as are in the lowest form they may by the help of
Book-ushers, climb to the highest pitch of Knowledg; a
thing that none can despise but the ignorant; and that onlybecause they have it not; they indeed depose themselves of Human
society, that give it not the advancement above all things in the World.
And now Gentlemen seeing learning and
knowledg are such Real things, as need no other props to support
them but what is cut out of themselves; and also that this de∣sign I have
undertaken, is to sow knowledg, which the whole Nation may reap, a
better medium to effect it then by reading Books I know not: and to let all
know what Books are daily prest for their service, seems to me
as good an expedient to follow it as any; and though there be a complaint that
the world seems opprest with Books, yet do we daily want them; and indeed,
there is no reason, any should deny, but that they are the best
furniture, nor do I know any reason, why others with my self, should not
think their variety the most excusable Prodigality; Therefore have I for
the advantages of these Northern parts, where I am so much Indebted;
endeavoured not on∣ly to have such choice both of Divinity, History,
Law, Phy∣sick, Mathematicks, &c. as never yet were in the Country,
but also intend, that not any in England, of esteem, or of easie
purchase, shall escape me: and that's not all, but have taken the paines
to let you know all, whereby you may fathom them, and by your sober choice,
retain the best, whilst the chaffe you may refuse; that your judgments
may like deep Rivers let weighty things sink, whilst sticks and straws
swim down the stream. Now I have nothing left but to Intreat your Candid
acceptance, and (Gentlemen) to place me in the number of those; that Honour
your true Worth, and am no less then in the greatest measure
