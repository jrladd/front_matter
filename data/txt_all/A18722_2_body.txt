I would haue searched the bottome of my studies and chiefest of my labors (good Sir Edward Dimmocke) if my leasure had serued, to haue foūd out some peece of worke worthy of your reading, but doubting that verse delightes you not, & Tragicall discourses breeds but a heauie conceit in a pleasant dis∣position, I thought it more fitter to treat of a Marshiall cause (wherein great honor consists) that may moue ma∣ny considerations in a noble minde, and so not only stir vp vertue but also beat downe all occasions that hinders the quiet & sweet societie of mē, not meaning that I see any motiō, cause, or action in this age, that may procure

my pen to go beyond the compas of my reach in refor¦ming the same: but to shew there is no greater blessed∣nes on earth then freindly felowship and amitie among men, and all the disturbers thereof are rather instrumēts of dissention, than mayntainers of good will. And for that in your long trauells abroad (where variaunce is moderated with wisdome) manie quarrells you haue seene or heard off, I haue written a little peece of the na∣ture of a quarrell compounded on many accidents, not teaching anye man a newe course & peaceable order to his life, but to nourish gentlenes & kindlie loue among all our noble natiō. So trusting no matter of mislike shal passe my Pen, I present you with this little peece of pa∣per that follows, wishing you the good fame and honor your own hart can desire.
