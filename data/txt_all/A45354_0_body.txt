May it please Your Grace
TO permit these Ser∣mons to go under the Protection of Your Great Name. Books often receive a more favourable

Acceptance upon the Account of the Worth and Merit of the Person they are addressed to: But that is not my De∣sign; which if it were, I could never have made a more agreeable choice of a Patron than Your Grace, whose known Integrity and Learning, and whose Noble and Generous Sentiments of Religion, which you have studiously endea∣voured to instill into others, are enough to inspire the most sluggish Genius to attempt something that is not Common. I am obliged in Justice and Gratitude to present Your Grace with something, and

this being the best I have, if it may not merit Praise and Approbation, yet at least I hope it may appear to Your Grace to be not altogether Contemptible. And if some uncertain and wavering Sceptick shall, by the read∣ing of these Discourses, reap any Benefit and Satisfaction, I shall think my self to have obtained the chiefest end I aimed at. For, as I am sen∣sible I cannot do all that Good that I would, in that narrow Sphere of Action wherein I move, so I had rather ven∣ture the various Censures of Men in the publishing my own

Thoughts, than not be aiding and assisting (according to the utmost of my Ability) to form in the Minds of others the truest Conceptions of that Re∣ligion by which the Christian World expects Immortal Bles∣sedness. I most humbly beg Your Grace's Pardon, both for the boldness of my Address, and for the Imperfections Your Grace will find in what I offer; which I hope I shall the more easily obtain upon the score of the long Acquaintance I have had the Honour to have with Your Grace. Now that GOD would long prosper Your Grace in Health and

Happiness, for the good of his Church, is the earnest Prayer of,
MY LORD,
