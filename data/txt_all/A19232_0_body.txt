I Am accused of presumption (right ex∣cellent Lady) by this noble Common∣wealth which I heere present vnto you, who gloriously shining in the cleere knowledge of her owne incomparable worthinesse, doth like a beautifull vir∣gine, that seeing her faire picture foule∣ly handled of an vnskilfull painter, blush at the view of her wronged beauty, and reproueth me for hauing with such feeble forces so farre presumed in the description of her rich and roy∣all history; a matter which the rarest forraine spirites of our time haue by their learned pens so highly enobled with such ex∣cellent art & ornaments: she wel knoweth the cleernes of your iudgement, and therfore feareth bearing the burthen and ble∣mishes of so great a weakenesse to approch the rayes of a censure so vndeceiueable and absolute.
I haue no shield nor excuse to oppose against this iust impu∣tation, but onely the defence of your Ladishippes fauours, who though by former experience knowing my vnfitnesse for such a worke, did neuerthelesse impose this taske vpon me.
Now therefore my humble request is, that howsoeuer the vntuned harshnesse of my disioynted stile shall seeme vnplea∣sant in your eares, yet that you will vouchsafe to be a gentle &

propitious defendresse to this renowned Commonwealth, that nothing more desireth then to bee gracious in your sight, and here frankely offreth vnto your view the naked full discouerie of her faire and be utifull lineaments, not concealing any part of her rarest perfections. Onely she humbly desireth, that si∣thence it is her happe to bee brought into Englande, she may haue free and quiet passage vnder your honourable safe conduct and protection: for such is the generall loue and reuerence, which the great worthinesse and integritie of your vnblemi∣shed life, and your long constant continued course in the exer∣cise of a spotlesse vertue hath vniuersally gained you, that bea∣ring with her the faire warrant of your so many waies enobled name, she shall not need to feare any vnciuill or disgracious v∣sage, no not of those, whose minds are diseased with the grea∣test enuie.
Finally, I beseech you (good Madame) not to measure my duetie towardes you by this meanes, wherein I seeke to shew it: for this I know to bee ordinary and vulgar, and so farre from the satisfaction of mine owne mind, as that I am in a manner therewith displeased, but the other, if euer your commande∣ment, opportunity of time and occasion, or the vttermost strain of my inuention and indeauour giue me leaue, shall discouer it selfe in a better proportion: for I will neuer forget, but still re∣taine engraued in the marble table of a thankefull memory (be∣sides the dutie our family oweth vnto that noble house wherein you matched) the many fauours you haue done me in particu∣lar, and he many wayes you haue sought to doe me good, where∣in though the violence of my own fortune hath stil encountred your enaeuor, yet ther remaineth vnto me no small comfort, & withal I doe somewhat the better esteeme my selfe, in that your Ladishippe, whose iudgement, wisedome, and vertue passeth

with such generall allowance; hath deemed me worthy of your honourable good opinion, and thereof hath made me assured by many most essentiall testimonies. In conclusion Madam, I will neuer cease to honour you, and in the meane time humbly beseech you to accept in good part, these the fruites of my ex∣tream idlenes, the poore pledges of that duty, which I would discharge towardes you in greater matters, if I were able, and for my part I will neuer cease to pray vnto the almighty to blesse you with honour and happines, such as so great worthinesse, and vertue deserueth. Selsey this thirteenth of August. 1598.
