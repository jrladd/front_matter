TO THE Worthy and Ever Honoured, Thomas Papillon, Esq; One of the Representatives of the Ho∣nourable City of LONDON, in the present Parliament: AND The Deservedly Respected, Philip Papillon, His Only SON.
WHEN I had perform∣ed the Service which you were pleased to Call me to, in the Preaching of this Sermon, I had no Grounds of Fear
 you would Importune me to make it more Publick.
THERE are few can be desi∣red to send their Pulpit Discourses to the Press, upon greater Disadvantage than my self; who have no writ∣ten Hints to recollect what I deliver, and must therefore be forced, when urg'd to it, to Desire Help from some of my Hearers; and refresh my Memory with their Notes, which alwayes labour under considerable Im∣perfections. To this I was parti∣cularly forced in the present Case, which I thought a sufficient Reason, for my desiring (as I did) it might (when committed to Paper) be kept for your own Private Perusal.
THEY that know us, will not
 expect I should say much of you, when I write to you: However, I am bold to be your Remembrancer of what was your Deceased Consort's Satisfacti∣on, in her Languishing Hours, because it may on equal Grounds be both yours: To have about Thirty descend∣ing from you, or nearly United to them that do, and no One but what gives just Cause to all of us to believe, the Root of the Matter is found, and Christ formed in them, is a Comfort many want after all their Pious Coun∣sels, Holy Examples, and Care of their Disposal. And tho' this be but one of the many Distinguishing Marks God hath Honoured you both with, yet this alone should raise our Thanks and Hopes about them.
AND that God will continue them,
 and especially You, Sir, his Worthy Son, in the Steps of such a Father, to fill up many of his Useful and Exem∣plary Posts, both Religious and Civil, is the Desire, and shall be the Prayer of

Upper Moorfields, Octob. 27. 1698.
