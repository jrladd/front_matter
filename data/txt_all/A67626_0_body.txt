Right Honorable, Honorable and Worshipful,
TRue Honor is the splen∣dor of Vertue and ho∣liness, and where it hath its just deriva∣tion and place, it is a shadow of that sacred combination of Greatness and Good∣ness
which are originally conjoyned, and even the same in God himself, and which should never be separated in the Creatures; indeed all true Greatness is the issue of Goodness, if it be rightly begotten, and then like a good Childe it is ordained to be the Nurse of its own Mother, it being dispensed by God unto the Sons and Daughters of men, to be an advantage and encouragement, as well as an engagement unto ver∣tuous, honourable and generous un∣dertakings. Of which, however the blear-eyed and doating world is mi∣staken, there are none so truly and eminently glorious as those that are conversant in Religion and di∣vine Worship, which as it is the highest end that God did, or could aim at in the creation of Man; so it must therefore needs be the great∣est eminency and perfection, that the generations of men are capable of; for every thing is by so much
more excellent, by how much the more it is advanced towards the scope and design of its being, and draweth nearer (if we may so speak where there is no comparison or pro∣portion to be found) unto him who is the sum of all that perfection which is in the accumulation of all Great∣ness and Goodness together; and truly earthly Honor is then in its increment and exaltation, when it is made the ornament of Religion and Godliness, or rather is adorned by it. When the rayes of Eminency of Birth, Place or Reputation where∣with God shines upon persons of Dignity and Honor, reflect back a∣gain in holy gleams of heavenly love to God, and holy beams of il∣lustration upon his Worship and Or∣dinances, and when they raise that holy return unto God that was in Davids soul at the dedication of his house, Psal. 30.1. I will extol thee, O Lord, because thou hast lifted me up, and
not made my foes to triumph over me: And certainly this is the great∣est end for which God bestows Ho∣nor upon the greatest men, that they may be the more conspicuous, and the more exemplary in the service and adoration of God, and not be as too many in our Age and Nation, like unthankful clouds, obscuring the Sun that raised them; or like the Moon in the Dragons Tail eclipsing that glory from whence she receiveth all her light. It is therefore the great∣est advancement that you can give to your State and Dignity to let it shine in the Sanctuary of the Lord, that you may by your holy and eminent patterns help to undeceive the besot∣ted World, that looks upon Offices of Religion as if they were a business fit onely for those that are of a low condition; that you may make them know that Crowns and Diadems, and Robes of Honor ate never so resplendent as when they are cast be∣fore
the Throne of the great God: How amiable was it to see you of late as so many Stars in your several sphears and degrees of Glory, shi∣ning as a propitious constellation at the new birth of this our Convert, when you were Witnesses at his Bap∣tism! and I hope you were orient and ascendent at that hour, and then I need not doubt but you had your happy influence, as well in the pro∣curement of a spiritual blessing upon his Soul, as you honorable Madam have been special and noble in taking care for his supportance and encou∣ragement. And I wish you may never want the milk of the divine breast of that God unto whose new-born Child you are become so bountiful a Nurse; wherein you have provided not onely for him, but for the ho∣nour of the Christian, yea of the poor English Church, and for the encouragement of others to come in to the embracement of Gods Truth,
in the entire reliance upon the divine mercy, which I wish you may see ef∣fectual in a happy confluence of ma∣ny multitudes unto the Gospel of Christ, to the advancing of the re∣ward of your piety from his hand whose abundant blessing I wish upon you all, who am,
Honoured Madam, Noble Lord, Worthy Sir,
