SIR,
IN this Vniuersall sicknesse, giue mee leaue (in a few Leaues) to salute your Health, and I am glad I can do so. To whom, in an Epidemiall confusion of Wounds, should a man flye, but to Physicke and Chirurgery? In both which you haue skill. In the last, the World crownes your Fame (as beeing a great Master.) Many of your excellent Pieces haue beene (and are to bee) seene in this City. No Painter can shew the like, no Limner come neere such curious Workemanship. What you set out, is truely to the life; theirs but counter∣feit. I honour your Name, your Art, your Practice, your profound Experience: And, to

testifie I doe so, let this poore Monument of my loue bee looked vpon, and you shall finde it. The Sender beeing sorry, it is not worth your acceptation: But if you thinke o∣therwise, he shall be glad,
