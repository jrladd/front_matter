Most Illustrious and Peerelesse Prince,
THat which your Highnesse be∣holdeth in the Sunne rising, how in displaying his bright Beames, hee dispells all mistie vapours, and comforts, by the vigorous influence thereof, the feeble sences of inferior bodies: the same might easily haue bin discerned in the faces of all his Maiesties subiects (who formerly drouping through the Fates destinie) are at last cheered and reuiued by the happy Rise of your Highnes into the Princely throne of Wales, where you were no sooner enthronized by Gods graci∣ous prouidence, by lawfull authoritie, and by the loue
of all his Maiesties liege people (who are the Princes principall Supporters) but it was a wonder to see of a sudden, what a sweet spring, what a happie change, what a powerfull renouation was wrought in the vi∣tall spirits of his Maiesties sayd subiects, who daun∣ced for ioy, filled the Aire with shouts and acclamati∣ons in all quarters, but specially in your proper Meri∣dian of Ludlow, the beautifull seate of his Maiesties chiefe Castle and Counsell of Wales, where my selfe (being not altogether an idle Actor, nor vnwilling Spectator) was so rauished with the fullnesse of ioy, which I saw in the hearts of the people, as I wished my selfe then to bee transformed into the shape of the sweete Nightingale, which was counted Vox prae∣tereà nihil, that with Fames golden wings I might eccho out to the eares of all men, the loyall affection of the Brittish Nation to their royall Prince, and the royall fauours of their gracious Prince intended to them, whose very Name caused such a surplusage of mirth and admiration, as my Penne is not able to decipher the halfe of the reioycing which they ex∣pressed, nor were they any way able with all their indeuors, to testifie the full measure of Gladnes which their hearts conceiued: If then in the divulging of this plaine Narration, I eclipse much of the glorious substance of the Shew, I hope your Highnesse in be∣holding my loyall intention, will be induced to par∣don my daring presumption. And what is now the period of all our Petitions, but that Heauen may adde constancie to the felicitie of your Triumph, and then
we doubt not that our Ioyes shall euer waxe olde, but whiles your Highnesse continues to accept of the roy∣all Title of Prince of Wales, his Maiesties people will still haue new matter of reioycing in your graci∣ous Gouernment and powerfull protection: Thus in most lowly manner vpon my knee, crauing pardon for this my presumption, hoping your Excellencie will not discusse Nec quis, nec quid, sed quo animo, neyther the meanenesse of my selfe, nor the smallnesse of the matter, but onely the minde and heart of your poore Vassall, I rest praying for all blessings external, internall, and eternall to your Highnesse. 
From Ludlow this last of Nouember 1616.
