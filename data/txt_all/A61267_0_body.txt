SIRS,
DIvers others Reasons (besides the Consciousness of my In-sufficiency for these things) made me at first, unwilling to appear in Print; one of which I shall acquaint you of, to shew that my desire to be excused, was Real, and not without some ground.

Ye know, The burnt Child dreads the Fire. I never published but one Sermon be∣fore, and that too by His MAJESTIES express Command, and yet, I was not only Challenged publickly, and Animadverted upon for it, but (to make the Scene more plea∣sant in exposing me) the same Ingenuous un∣known Hand, tied me to the Cart-tayle of a Non-Conformist, as if I had been one of the Changelings in my Text, a false Brother; Or, in the new Style, a Trimmer.
Indeed I did not think fit to accept his Challenge, but (know all men by these presents) that was for the Author's sake, and Theirs that set him on work, more than my own. And I have taken occasion to mention this now, partly, to let them see I can forgive a wrong, without the formality of receiving Satisfaction; but chiefly to convince You, that a man may be in some danger of censure under your Protection, when he is not safe, or out of Gun-shot, though armed with the KINGS Authority.

After all, you see, I have performed more then I would promise, and denied my self to gratify You. For your repeated Importu∣nity hath prevailed upon my second thoughts to believe, That the making this Sermon pub∣lick, may possibly contribute one Mite to his MAJESTIES and the CHƲRCHES service in this nice Juncture: And then, let the Criticks shew their Teeth, and Conscious Men betray their Guilt by being angry with me, it shall not break my sleep, so long as I have gained my Point, that is, done no∣thing but what was my Duty to do, as became,

London, April the 30th. 1683.
