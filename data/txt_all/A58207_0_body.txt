them the wholeEph. 6. 13. armour of God, that they
may be able to stand. I may safely say, no
one age ever felt such various oppositions

of truth; Satan seeming in former times
but to skirmish, but now to storm theRev. 20. 9. be∣loved
City and Tents of the Saints with all
his Legions of errours drawn up into one
body: of all which none more infet or
hinder our work, then those Moabites and
Ammonites;Deut. 23. 3. who contrary to Gods ordi∣nance,
have intruded into the work of the
Temple, pretending to build with us; say∣ing
with those enemies of Israel,Ezra 4. 2. We seek
your God as ye do. Now the noon-tide Devil
is on the Stage in his last scene, whose part
is (if itMat▪ 24. 24. were possible) to deceive the very
Elect. To which no ordinary dress can
now fit him or his Ministers; it must be
(and so is) some close semblance of sancti∣mony,
in which the Saints delight; without
which Satan could not easily take them,
with which he often doth; whilstIncautè creduli circumveniuntu ab iis quos o∣nos putabant. Minuc Fel. Oct. incau∣tiously

hunters of Ostriches used to dress them∣selves
up with their feathers, imitate their
motions, and scatter grains of seeds before
them; so the false2 Cor. 11. 13, 15. Apostles, deceitful wor∣kers,
seduce by transforming themselves

into Apostles of Christ, Ministers of righte∣ousness;
scattering out of their delightful
bags, seeds of dangerous Heresies and
Schisms.
Why I undertook this polemical task,
you know who were present at my first
imbarquing in this controversie; as also
many of my reverend brethren, who af∣terwards
importuned me to the first part
hereof. If any ask, why it comes out so
late to publike view? let the false2 Sam. 16. 3.  Sam. 1. 5, &c. Zi∣baes
answer; I can conjecture but not re∣solve;
it is now about two years since it
was much desired, fairly promised, and
accordingly sent to one Press; where the
 Vid. Isa. 37. 3 children were come to the birth and there
was no strength to bring forth. Why I write
after so many, so much more able to defend
the truth, might possibly put me to the
Oratours quaere What is left for me to do?
but new adversaries arising, giving fresh
assaults, and impudently affronting and
challenging me in my publike charge to
answer them; what could I have answer∣ed
the Lord, if seeing the Wolf coming
into the fold, I had withdrawn or betrayed

the souls of my Auditors; who might pos∣sibly
have thought our cause deserted, for
which none durst plead. All lovers of
truth owe it respective defence: and too
much caution cannot be in things of so
great moment as salvation ofSimiliter a∣cis, ac si me ro∣ges, cur te duo∣bus contuear oculis, & non altero tantum, cum idem un assequt possim. Cic. de nat. or. l. 3. souls. No
man rationally asketh, What need we two
eyes who can see with one? I am far from
pleading universality for defence, or multi∣tudes
for Patronage of truth: let our ad∣versaries
reckon themselves many, and
think that

They have many Writers; but if the cause
be weighed by Scripture and solid reason,
then as2 King. 6. 16. Elisha said, they are more with us
then with them: yet I heartily wish that
many more would shew themselves on our
part, and neither betray the truth by their
silence, who can seasonably and ably speak
in its defence, nor encourage the adversa∣ries
thereof by such a Laodice-like luke∣warmness
as shews a dangerous symptome
of neutralitie. For my part I cannot but
be conscious of much disabilitie, yet dare
not but endeavour to defend the. Gr. Nazianz. Orat. 13. truth:





for this, let whoso will condemn or acquit
me; God is all-sufficient. Such as these
endeavours are, I submit to the judgment
of the1 Tim. 3. 15. Church of God, the pillar of truth, and
dedicate them to you who love the truth;
and by Gods assistance2 Pet. 2. 12, 13. will not be negli∣gent

these things, though you know them, and be
established in the present truth; yea, I think
