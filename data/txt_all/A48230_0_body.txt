My Lord,
THe Honour I had once to be Yours, gives me the bold∣ness to
affix your Graces Name before this Book, made English in
your Service, at those vacant hours I could borrow from the Function of my
Employment: It is a Romance, but so like a True Story, that your Grace may
reap by it the use and pro∣fit of a true History. It was a good
Tale in Monsieur Segrays dress, therefore I must humbly
beg your Graces par∣don if I have spoil'd it in the Telling.
The scope of it, is chiefly to shew the deformity of
Treachery, Ingratitude, the Folly and Mischiefs of ill-grounded Jealousies;
as also to punish Vice, and reward Vertue, though Vertue be 
—Pulcherrima merces
ipsa sibi— Yet if not cultivated
and ap∣plyed, it may be truly said of her, as in this our Age is made out; 
—Virtus Laudatur & alget.
But if we may ground our Conjectures upon those early Rayes of
hopeful Good∣ness, which breaks forth like a glorious Morn from your
tender Years, we may with Assurance promise the World that
You will not starve her.
And that the Riches and Beauty of your Mind, will in time
out-shine that of your Body; in which, although the Majesty of your
Great Sire, and the lovely features of your Mother, at once
dasle and surprize the eyes and the hearts of all that see
you; yet the clearness of your Un∣derstanding, the quickness of your
Apprehension, the hap∣piness of your Memory, your Gracefulness and Manly
car∣riage in performing all your Exercises, your Solidity in
Reasoning, well-grounded assurance in Discoursing, even with the
greatest and most Learned men, may confirm us in our most
assured Hope (that if the Almighty be graciously pleased to pro∣long
your Life) you will out-doe our just expectations of You.
And that when you are called by the Prerogative of your Blood, to
publick Em∣ployments, you will embrace them, not as
prises of Am∣bition, Oppression, Injustice, and
Covetousness, but as your proper Sphere wherein you will move,
most usefully for the Service of God, the safety and honour of
your Prince and Country, nourishing Arts and
Vertue wheresoever you find them:
And that when all occa∣sions of the publick are at a
stand, you will be able most profitably to actuate upon your self, as the
properest object of your Industry, God having made you so rich a
Soil, that you will be still improvable, and rather chuse to bestow your
time in Cultivating the rich mines of your Great and Princely
Soul (of which you give daily most clear demonstrations to
all those that have the ho∣nour to Converse with you) than to suffer your
self to be carryed away by the ill managery of others, or by the example or
imitation of such who Mispend their times in evil Conversation
and worse Manners, and that you will not let so
hopeful a Field produce a degenerate Crop; having this Maxim still in mind,
That 'tis Ʋertue alone that can make you powerful and happy, and
that nothing but Ʋice, and the practise thereof can debase what
was intended so Great.
I therefore most humbly beseech your Grace to par∣don 
this my boldness, and to accept this small Oblation of this
First Part of Zayd, with that goodness which is so
na∣tural to you, from one, whose chiefest Ambition has been (since he had
the honour to know and serve your Grace) to approve himself,
My Lord,
