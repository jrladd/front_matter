AS it hath been for the most part (right Honorable) a very commendable and orderlie course a∣mongest the lear∣ned, as well diuine as prophane wri∣ters, to publish their workes to bee read and heard of the common people, either in their owne vulgare toong for their be∣nefit, or els in Hebrew, Greeke, or Latin, for the learneder sort: so hath been also their maner to dedicate them vnto some honorable or worshipfull personages, for the patronizing of those their paines and trauels: which their doings, haue at this present made mee presume vppon your
honourable curtesie, to dedicate this my trauell of these Sermons of Maister Iohn Caluin, translated by me out of French in∣to English, for the benefit of my Coun∣try men, that vnderstand not the same language. Most humbly beseeching you Sir, to accept hereof, as a tokē of my pore good will towards you, not in respect of my trauell which is but rude and of no worth, but in regard of the worthines of the matter, and of the graue and reuerend handling thereof by mine Authour. The Lord of Lords increase all honorable and godly vertues in you (that you may be as excellent a Magistrate in this common∣weale as your honourable and most wise father hath of long time been and stil is,) with prosperitie in this life, to his diuine pleasure, and after the course of this time ended, perpetuall ioy and felicitie.
