My good Lord:
THere is a Royall marriage to beheld,
In the Mount Syon (that God loues so well,)
It was determin'd in the dayes of eld,
And now's at hand, and I am charg'd to tell,
Some noble friends, to th'end they may prouide,
T'attend the nuptialls of the Lambe and's Bride;
To be made members of it: therefore I
My office and my seruice, both t'approue
Towards God, and you giues this to testifie,
In chaines of duty, and vnfained loue,
I'm bound so fast (It shall be vnderstood;)
I cannot, mooue (except to do you good,)

I come t'inuite your Honor to a feast,
That's heauenly, holy, happy, and ne'er ends,
You are elected as a proper guest:
Nobillity, vertue, honor, are those friends
Must grace the nuptialls, the bad must be gone,
"Good will haue good associats, or else none.
My Lord I know you, and I know y'are stor'd,
With wisedome, learning, bounty, beauty, loue,
Humillity, piety, grace, a compleate Lord,
Your merits vow to build your seate aboue,
Your foes on earth with grace; and (sayth the story)
Mercy will build your seate in Heauen with glory.
I haue a licence from the greatest power,
To build a lanthorne for the Kingdomes sight,
And vpon stately Lathams eagle Tower,
I thus presume to place it, to giue light
Vnto the present, and the future time,
Of the true worth of Derbyes Prince-like line:
Keepe you it in repaire, and you shall proue,
I owe you life, although I pay but loue.
