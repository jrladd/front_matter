Madam,
I Can not, I may not for∣get those re∣spects which my selfe some years since found from your late ho∣noured Husband, and your selfe; how, during my exile (in the late dif∣ficult times) from the

Great Yarmouth place to which God first called, and hath since returned me, you were pleased to provide me a residence and subsistance in your neighboring
The Is∣land of Loving∣land. Pat∣mos; where for some time I exercised my Ministery, first as a Teacher, in a
Lownde Village near you, and after as a Pastor in the
Somer∣leyton. place of your owne ha∣bitation. As a gratefull acknowledgement of that immerited favour (not having a better present) I doe here put this small Tract into your Ladi∣ships
hand. The sub∣ject matter whereof (what ever the Work∣manship be) is such, as may deserve a reception. Acquaintance with God, it is the cheif hap∣piness of the reasonable creature. This, (I trust) your Ladiship is not alto∣gether a stranger to. My desire is, that you may grow up to a further de∣gree of this blessed famili∣arity. And to that end I shall crave from you a se∣rious perusal of this smal Manuall; wherein you
shall find, as the Nature of this great Duty open∣ed, so the Practice of it Incouraged, directed, Cautioned. May my labours in this way prove usefull to your Ladiship, I shall look upon it as the best retribution that I am, or ever shall bee able to make you. In the desires and hopes whereof, I hum∣bly take my leave, resting

Yarmouth 14. July Anno. 1653.
