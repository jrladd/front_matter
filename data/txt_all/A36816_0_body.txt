SIR,
UPon second thoughts, and better advice and consi∣deration, I have altered my resolution; and the generall and particular discharge of my duty, and conscience, now prompts me to present you with this Tragical Discourse (being part of the fruits of my 31. years East-India experience and observation) and the rather, because of your knowne ability and alacrity to publike good; as also your serious and often observation of some late passages in relation to the principall suffering subject thereof, (this Commonwealth excepted) whose case and cause seems to cry aloud to heaven and earth for Justice and Judge∣ment, saying, (Care ye not that we perish?) When will it once be, That judgement shall run as a river, and righteousnesse as a mighty stream: And although a good foundation of East-India Trade was also intended and laid by that Mirror of Merchandizers (and so then an incomparable Commonwealths-man) Sir William Courten Knight, deceased: As appears by his unparalleld Expe∣ditions to the West, as well as the East-Indies (the chiefest de∣sirable Trophees of this whole universe, to advance and inrich a Nation) yet withall to consider how in his life time, himselfe was unjustly dispossessed of the one by the late King, and his Courtiers, or Favourites: And since how William Courten Esquire, his son, hath likewise been as unjustly opprest in the other, by the govern∣ment of an illegall Patent (derived from the same power) to his utter undoing, administers matter of astonishment (yea even to very heathens in my knowledge) Because Justice and Judgement between man and man, is not executed speedily. But lest by my silence I should become accessary to his and others sufferings ther∣fore I tender the disposal of the sequel to your most serious and ju∣dicious wisdome and discretion: You may please to perceive with me, that I could have put it in another dresse, of a deeper dye, and withall hold the rules of truth and sobriety; but I chuse rather to prejudice many by a modest forbearance, then offend any by harsh and unpleasing expressions, conceiving here is matter suffi∣cient to convince the oppressors of the errours of their wayes, if they consider (intr. al.) but their last destruction of trade and sup∣plies, and so of the Plantation, and discoveries of Madagascar,
and adjacent Islands Assada, and the rest, which is now become their first and onely foundation, and best hopes of the present Traders, in order to advance themselves, and this Commonwealth, from the hidden ruine, and remaining basis of the abovesaid parties, as long since they were plainly and truely informed: And I am perswaded Heaven will not alwayes suffer Earth, injurious Earth thus to passe unregarded, unrewarded, but in his due time stir up some in highest Authority, of approved Excellency and Eminency (that knows and remembers they bear not the sword for nought) to question and determine the whole matter, and forthwith order the securing of Carwar, for advance of Trade, and good of this Commonwealth.
And seeing the principall matters and passages in difference are extrinsecall and extrajudiciall, and so (humbly conceived improper for, and remedilesse here by any Court of Justice or equity (much lesse for any Commission thence proceeding) because his just right and propriety to Trade, Factories, and Plantations in both Indies, are things in Nature and Eminency co-essentiall and con∣substantiall to, and with the being, and well-being of a Common∣wealth (and so to be accounted) being rather honours and emol∣luments onely proper to the Crowne and Dignity of a Nation for protection, defence, and preservation; and in no wise (as formerly) to be referred to the neglect, or weak endeavours of an Incorpo∣ration, or particular person for oppression, losse, and destruction, as sundry instances in this ensuing Tract may sufficiently evince: But in this (as in all other) I most humbly submit to better judgements. And seeing moreover, that both the father and the son (at so dear a rate) have opened a door, and prescribed a way for Trade to perpetuity (which no other would, or could do) where∣by this Nation in time may become the Mirror and Terror of Kingdoms & Countries, therefore I well hope such deserts (in point of justice and equity, as well as incouragement to others) will not alwayes lye in the dust, but be had in high and honorable esteem & remembrance by the most wise, prudent, and best affected, and re∣warded accordingly; Which doubtlesse will be well pleasing to God, and great rejoycing to good people, and so procure Heavens blessing upon all your designs, ever accompanying such acts of Justice and Mercy: And these are the prayers, and perswasions, hopes, and earnest desires of him who willingly remains, Sir,
