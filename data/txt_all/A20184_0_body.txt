THE zealous care
of that religious
and learned Tea∣cher
Mr. Dent, to∣wardes
the edifi∣cation
of Gods house, in the ex∣hortation
of his people vnto ho∣linesse
of life; as it hath suffici∣ently
approued it selfe to the ge∣nerall
view of the World in di∣uers
worthy workes of his now
extant: so by the consent of ma∣ny

deuout and iudicious Christi∣ans,
it hath not in any one peece
or other of his doing, more fully
aud truly expressed it selfe; than
in that Sermon which himselfe
first preached, and afterwardes
caused to be published, vpon Re∣pentance.
It might haue been sup∣posed,
that this delicate Age of
ours would scarcely haue put on
so rough a garment. But the ver∣tuous
cunning of that excellent
Artist, had so thicke ouerlaced
the same with heauenly promi∣ses
and comfortable perswasi∣ons:
that although at the first as∣saying
thereof, it found it selfe
inwardly prickt and perturbed;
yet after a little wearing, and by

daily vse, the straightnesse there∣of
became both profitable and
pleasing, and it reioyced not a
little to be so happily deceiued.
Behold heere another peece of
Worke, made by the same hand,
A short Treatise of Restitution:
Array thy selfe likewise (good
Christian) with this Vesture; be∣ing
indeed an Ornament, which
will make the rest of thy cloa∣thing
appeare more gracious.
This is the true Touch-stone
which tries thy repentance; and
giues thee to God and the world
either a true Christian, or a coun∣feit.
Be not afraid to vse it: but
as thou hast vouchsafed the for∣mer,
of Repentance, to weare in

thine heart, and hast thereby no
doubt (if thou be a Christian) re∣ceiued
great consolation; so let
this latter, of Restitution, be as a
Posie in thine hand, to thy more
assured & greater comfort. This
is the furniture which renders
the guest acceptable at the hea∣uenly
marriage. If then thou
desirest to bee welcome to that
Feast, enter thus suited. Now for∣asmuch
as this so necessary and
Christianlike a worke, penned by
so singuler a Minister of the Gos∣pell,
and so much conducting to
eternall blisse, hath by Gods
goodnes come vnto my hands:
and considering that Repentance
is of small force where Restituti∣on

is wanting, as being the one∣ly
Key which openeth the way
vnto Remission; I held my selfe
bound in Christian Charity, to
communicate the same vnto my
Brethren. Such Talents must
not be hid, but put to vsury, that
they may be increast with profit.
Praise God for the Author of so
good a worke; and vse it to the
rectifying of thine owne consci∣ence,
that God may be glorified;
which is the accomplishment of
my desire. Farewell in the Lord.
