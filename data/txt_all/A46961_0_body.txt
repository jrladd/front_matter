My Lord,
YOur Lordship has the largest Inheri∣tance of Honour of any Englishman be∣sides, and your very early Years promise to the World, that you will rather improve than waste your Patrimony. I hope

your Great Father will Live in You, and that there never will be want∣ing a Great Lord Russell in Succession, which is the only way wherein Mor∣tal Men can stay any while here upon Earth. That You may follow Him in his Piety, in his Devotedness to his Religion and Countrey, in his Integrity, Wisdom, Magnanimity, Constan∣cy, and all the Parts both of a Christian and a Nobleman: And that

You may be the Joy and Delight of your Countrey (as He was,) but Never their Grief, is the Hearty Prayer of
My Lord,
