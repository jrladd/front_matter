SIR,
TO apologize for this Dedica∣tion under the worn pre∣tence of a desire of Protection, were at once to do violence, both to the Character of my Author
(whose Fame has rais'd him a∣bove the need of any) and my own Modesty, who am too con∣scious of what the best perfor∣mances of this kind amount to, not to know, That Pardon only

(without Protection) is Indulgence
sufficient to the frailties of a Tran∣slation.
THAT then which alone emboldens me to the inscribing this to YOUR REVER'D NAME, is a belief I have, that the Copy cannot be disagreeable to YOU of an Original, in whose diversities of Entertainment and Reading, You have been sometimes pleas'd to own so much satisfaction, espe∣cially upon a Subject of such sin∣gularity as this, touching the dif∣ferent Rites of Funeral in practice with Mankind.
OF which Rites, however entitled YOUR VIRTUES have long since rendred YOU to those of the most Solemn, or YOUR
severer PHILOSOPHY may ne∣vertheless make YOU partial to
 others of the less studied Methods mention'd in this Treatise; GOD grant Your arrival at either may be as late for the benefit of Others, as YOUR KNOWN INTEGRITY and FORTITUDE render im∣possible its coming too soon with regard to YOUR SELF. Which is the most fervent Prayer of,
HONOUR'D SIR,

Novemb. 6.
1682.
