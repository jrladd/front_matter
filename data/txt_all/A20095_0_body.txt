SIR THOMAS,
YOu shall behold drawne (on this paper) certaine Plat-formes of ground, vppon which two mi∣ghtie, and (al∣most) inuincible Armies are this present Summer to ioyne Battaile: Here you may knowe what Tren∣ches they cast vp, what fortifications they raise, what Rampires, what Pa∣rapets, what Counterscapes, &c. Let it not appeare strange, that from the Regiment of knights Military, I

make choise of you, to be a Chiefe in e best of these armies (you beeing no professed Warriour.) But I my selfe serue on the one side, and the World markes you out to be an able Commaunder in the other. Before the Allarum be strucke vp, behold I offer my selfe (and all the forces which I leade) into your hands. With the Pen, (a most daungerous peece of Artillery) doe I vse to come into the field: That shall be dischar∣ged to do you all the Honour it may, and I be ready, in any seruice fitting such a souldier, to Fight.
