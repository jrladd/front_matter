MADAME,
THese my travels, upon the medicinall wa∣ter of
Peter-head, are yours, as the Well is, and many miles about: neither ar my travels only, but my self am, and many of my progenitors, parents, and kinred are, and were yours, as receaving first breath under your L. most noble and famous house of
Marshall. Wherefore I have taken the bold
 to publish them to the world under your L. name, that who∣soever shall bee benefited hereby, may, next to God, blesse your L. for that blessed instrument of their health. What I have written, I have not written at randon, but by infallible grounds of reason and experience. And if neither the Well, nor the Writer were yours, yet the singular vertues and graces wherewith your L. beautiful minde is richly adorned, should have furnished reason sufficient for this dedication, and for much more then  spring of my years could pos∣sibly produce. Receave herefore, Noble Ladie, these first fruits of my small ingine, as an earnest of a greater harvest of service: which, if it please God, may bee after reaped, for your L. and your most noble Family, and hopefull progenie: whom God continue in felicitie and honour, so long as the Sun and Moon shall last.
