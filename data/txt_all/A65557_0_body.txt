May it please Your GRACE,
I Have presumed to In∣title Your Grace to this small Piece, not out of con∣ceit of its Merits, but sense of mine own Obligations. People use to pay their debts as they are able; and when All they can do is in effect Nothing, to have publickly
 acknowledged themselves In∣solvent, is, to have aimed at being Just.
May then Your GRACE please to Accept of my having intended well, both in the Book and Dedication: And to believe amongst the Numerous Votaries to Your Illustrious Self and Family, he who brings only this mite of Gratitude, has as much Zeal to approve his full Duty, and as industri∣ously watches opportuni∣ty to do so, as any man li∣ving.


MY LORD,
I shall never fail daily, till Your GRACE shall be above such Services, to of∣fer up to that God, whom You have imitated in hum∣bling Your self to raise the poor out of the dust, my most cordial Supplications, for the encrease of Your Glo∣ries and Felicities. The Su∣preme Lord, the Master of the whole Family in Heaven and in Earth, will repay, what his poor Menials can∣not, all the Good Your GRACE
 has done to his House, and therein, to the unworthiest of his Vassals,
