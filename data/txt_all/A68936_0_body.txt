SIR,
HAd these Lines beene
loose, and lasciuious, I
had either pickt out a
lesse honorable Patron,
or stood to the courtesie
of euery wanton Reader; But being (as

they are) of a diuine subiect, therefore
subiect to the ill-digested humours of
light heads, by your fauour (thrice noble
Lord) you are bound to protect it, being
the knowne Patron to goodnesse. There
are too few such: This makes glorious
Vice so bold, and bashfull Vertue so in∣glorious.
You are a bright Starre in our
Orbe; on which, all good eyes are fixt,
and by the speciall influence of which,
these presented Lines, had their conce∣ption,
their birth, their being; and now
crept forth, repay themselues to You, hope
to receiue honour from You, and sue for
protection vnder You. So I commit them
to the honour of so great a fortune.
SIR,
