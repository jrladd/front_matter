SIR,
THough Dedications, those especially that usher Poetry into the World, are commonly repu∣ted the Authors low design of Profit: Yet I hope this may claim an Exception from the Gene∣ral Rule, when I aver that it was never the intent or meaning of the Composure. However when that Famous Elegy made upon the Cities Death, thought it not a thing unseasonable to trouble the whole Body of the City then in Mourning, it may perhaps seem now the less impertinent, if this Panegyrick seek out for one single Patron to whom it may as freely communicate the General Joy now rising from the Ci∣ties Resurrection. A presumption that I hope may gain pardon, though from nothing more than the con∣fidence it has in the choice of such an eminent Person,
 whose industrious Care in the designing, was equally deserving as your known Expences have been magni∣ficent in finishing the famous subject of the following Poem: Which if it gain favour at your hands for the Subjects sake, is all the Author can expect who has no other Intercessour but that (as he hopes) prevailing charm to obtain his own pardon, and your leave to subscribe himself,
