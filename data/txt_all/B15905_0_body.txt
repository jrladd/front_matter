With due respects, and iust obseruances
I offer vp my faire remembrances,
Liuely continuing, by this true record
Long lasting memory, to my honour'd Lord;
I doubt me nothing but I am come short
(Against my will 'tis though) in my report:
My genius is too meane, too poore, too lowe,
Let me craue pardon yet for fayling soe,
Since I haue done my best, accept then this,
Passe by my errours, that you find a misse;
Each man a liue knew his exceeding worth,
Nor need it to haue beene by me set forth,
Can though a thankefull heart forget to bring
Earnest acknowledgements for euery thing
Rright plentiously receiued? the Muses were espected by him, and they thanke him here.
