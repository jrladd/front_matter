Most Honorable:
KIng Salomon did choose to haue his Throne,
Borne vp with Lyons, and admitted none,
Of baser beasts that should imployed bee,
In office neare vnto his dignitie,
Accounting wolues, and asses beasts too base,
To be imployd about a Throne of grace.
Your greatnesse being goodnesse doth affect,
The best supporters, because you protect,
Both art, and wit, and grace, I wish to bee
Preseruer of your pious dignitie:
Great Earle, a Diuine muse vnto you brings,
A sacrifice worth the respect of Kings,

Not for my merit, by whom now it comes,
But for his merits that hath brought the sonnes
Of Adam backe to Eden, giue to mee,
Such fauours as befits the ministrie;
And for requitall God giue you, I'll pray,
Many good yeares, and then one lasting day.
