EVen as by the law of God & man, Children are bounde to honour, reue∣rence, & obey their Parents, both Spirituall and Temporall: so in like sort is it comprehended in the same, that Parents are no lesse obliged to haue a due care to nou∣rish and correct, to comfort also, & instruct their Children. Where∣fore, deuout Brethren and Sisters,
 seruants of Iesus Christ, pardon me (vnworthy the name of a Fa∣ther) for that these many yeares past, I haue not written vnto you all in generall, but onely once, to encourage you in the holy Profes∣sion, which our Lord hath called you vnto, and in the battaile which you maintaine against the flesh, the world, and the deuill, by rea∣son of the happy waye, and perfect course of Penance, which you haue begunne. For if the father, which begetteth one according to the flesh, is so bound to bring him vp in his youth in vertue, that if through his fault and want of due correction, and instruction, he do amisse, great punishment hangeth ouer his head (whereof we haue a lamentable example in Hely the high Priest, who for default of his children was punished himself with suddaine death, and his house ouerthrowne and quite deiected) Much more care ought the Spiri∣tuall Fathers haue, to cherish, in∣struct, and encourage their chil∣dren
 in the vertuous course, which they haue begunne, and to admo∣nish and reprehend them, if they do otherwise, for that most seuere is the threatning of Almighty God against them, if through their negligence any should fal to ruine, saying by the mouth of Ezechiel:Ezec. 34. That he would require the blood of those which shall perish at the hands of such, as by their negligence were cause therof. Where∣fore, though heretofore whilst your number was but small, I was able by worde and presence to sup∣ply, what by writing I omitted to doe, yet now, your holy companie daily encreasing, and my yeares & strength continually decaying, my purpose & desire is by Gods grace, (and his diuine ayde assisting me) now to accomplish and performe that, wherein I haue hitherto fay∣led, and to that end, I haue com∣piled this little TREATISE OF PENANCE, for your direction and comfort: to whom, with all sincere and fathertly affection, I dedicate it, making humble petiti∣on
 in my poore prayers, and dai∣lie Sacrifices with my whole hart, to the end I may further you in what possibly I can, to winne and procure at last the crowne, prepa∣red for you in heauen, and promi∣sed you here on earth, at your profession, for your Penance and paines taking, to gaine the fauour of God, which euery good Christi∣an ought also chiefly to seeke: for I assure you, a Christian hath but this one businesse, or at least this ought to be the principal, to learne how to finde fauour before God, seeing that to please him, is the happiest thing that can come vnto vs: for without this, what are all other things but affliction and mi∣serie? But hauing well laboured therein, and accomplished that matter, ther is nothing that should terrifie vs, because hauing Gods fauour, one ought not to care, al∣though all afflictions and paines should fall vpon him. And I feare that one of the causes why manie liue, without hauing, or obtayning
 the fauour of this our Lord and Redeemer, contenting themselues with the vanities of this world (which by your Rule and holy Order, you are to contemne) is, for that they know not the worth thereof, or the vehement desire he hath to bestow it on vs, and him∣selfe withal, in whom all grace and goodnesse is comprehended. For who is hee that should perfectly know, that in one thing onely, all goodnesse is heaped together, but would truely desire, rather to haue it, then to wander vp and downe, begging of euery creature some parcell thereof, and after much paines, to remaine as if he had got∣ten nothing? For though he had gotten all the world, yet if hee want the fauour of God, all is as nothing, for that it would nothing at all profite him. Our Sauiour Iesus Christ by his holy grace, giue vs his light, that wee may lift vp our eyes to him, and that his loue and fauour may appeare to be so worthily accounted of, that with∣out
 any feare at all, wee may goe foreward in that happy course we haue begun to obtaine it, that wee may giue for it whatsoeuer he will demand of vs in exchange, for who soeuer will giue but something for the loue of God, and not all, hath too base a conceit of the same, and therefore deserueth to remaine without it.
Wherefore, though in this third order, you are not bound or com∣manded to sell and giue away all vnto the poor, as in the other two orders they are counselled to doe, either in deed, or good will at the least: yet all such as will do well, and get Gods grace & his fauour, must giue all that they haue, and themselues withall, wholly vnto God, who did not thinke much to giue himselfe wholly vpon the Crosse, for our sakes.
Wee must giue much, to haue much, and to rejoyce not a little, that wee haue to giue, that which God demandeth for himselfe, and his honour, thereby to declare our
 affection vnto him. And if this bee good (as good it is) for all sortes of people, by farre greater reason doth it appertaine vnto you (most deere Brethren and Sisters) which after a more particuler maner then others, are his chosen seruants, which haue renounced the vani∣ties of the world, to serue him in this holy order of Penance.
But forasmuch, as the naturall inclination and disposition of men is such, that seldome or neuer will they willingly vndergoe any dan∣ger, labour, or paine, vnlesse they hope thereby to get honour, gaine, or pleasure; but where there is ex∣pectation of any one of these, there is no danger so imminent, no pain so grieuous, nor labour so great, but they will voluntarily vnder∣take it, for to obtaine their wished desire. What danger is there so perrilous, but the valiant Souldier will expose himselfe vnto, in hope to atchiue honour? what paine so grieuous, but that the voluptous men, and louers of the world, doe
 subject themselues here vnto, for to obtaine a momentary pleasure? What toyle and trauell is there so great, but that the husbandman will vndertake, for future hope, and vncertaine gaine.
Wherefore, seeing that all other persons also, of what degree or e∣state soeuer, are thus naturally in∣clyned, and that not onely Pe∣nance it selfe, but the verie name thereof, seemeth hatefull vnto ma∣ny, for want of the knowledge, and due consideration of the honor, profite, and pleasure, that it bring∣eth man vnto. For that cause, be∣fore I go about to set downe your holy order of Penance, or declara∣tion of your Rule and maner of life, which our B. Father S. FRAVNCIS, by the inspiration of the holy Ghost, did institute in the yeare of our Lord 1221. for all sorts of persons, whose desire was to liue deuoutly in their owne houses, to flye the pompes of the worlde, and to intende chiefly to the workes of pietie. The more to
 encourage you in your good pur∣poses, & to animate others to fol∣low your vertuous examples, I deemed it not a misse, to take away first, that hardnesse and hatefulnes which seemed to many to bee in Penance, by declaring the neces∣sitie and vtilitie thereof, with the great graces which redound vnto all persons in generall from it, but especially from this your holy or∣der of Penance, which forasmuch as it requireth euery moneth some exhortation to be made vnto you thereof: I haue set downe here this little Treatise, to the end that at such times as you want that o∣portunitie, you might read some of these Chapters following. And seeing that our holy Patrone S. FRAVNCIS, doeth require in his children, an speciall obedience a∣boue all others, vnto the Catho∣tholike Church, I as a poore childe of his, do with all humble submis∣sion of will, minde and vnderstan∣ding, submit not onely this my simple collection, and declara∣tion
 of your rule, vnto the cor∣rection and reformation thereof, but in like sorte, all my actions and thoughts, beseeching sweete Iesus, which is our chiefe Patrone, that this my poore labour may re∣dound to his honour and praise, & vnto the encrease of grace & ver∣tue in you his deuout children, so hoping of your fauou∣rable acceptance of good will, here∣in I rest,
