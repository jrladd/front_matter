SIR,
SƲch hath been the sad Distractions of these our unfortunate times, that Learning hath in a manner been trodden under foot, Arts and Liberal Sciences contemned and villified: amongst the rest, Astrology hath had a grand Ec∣clipse; many Scioli and illiterate persons like mush∣roms have sprung up, and arm'd with Ignorance and Impudence, mistake themselves for great Rabbies in that most profound Science. And this scum of the many, undertakes to tell Fortunes, predict future Contingents, inform silly Girles who shall be their Husbands, with thousands of such like fopperies. This Grave, Judicious, and Learned Author, Bene∣dictus Pererius, comming by accident into my hands, after I had seriously perused him, I esteemed it not

amiss to dress him in English habit, and teach him to speak our Language, to undeceive such as have been inveigled and misled by pernicious Star gazers. I know there will not be wanting those who will carp at my Labours, and therefore, Noble Sir, knowing your Education to be above the ordinary strain even of Persons of Quality; your Judgement excellent; your Skill in Mathematicall Conclusions transcen∣dent; your knowledge in Tongues and Sciences ad∣mirable; and your Extraction Honourable; I hum∣bly beseech you to patronize these my weak Endea∣vours, and give them leave to appear in Publick un∣der the Wings of your auspicious Protection: which if you vouchsafe, I shall neither fear Momus nor Aristarchus, but rest secure, and subscribe my self,
SIR,
