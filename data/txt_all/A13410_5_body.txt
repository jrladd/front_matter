Worthily Honored:
THere is a sumptuous feast prepar'd,
Vpon Gods holy hill:
Of dainties, and of plenties, shar'd
Amongst all those that will,
With reuerence, and louing feare,
Attend to be the ghests:
At the Lambs nuptialls, to be there
The Lord (by me) requests,
Your worthy selfe, therefore prouide,
Your wedding garments fit;
And you by Gods-sonnes-sacred side,
In glories seate shall fit:

Peruse these lines, and though they be,
No measures that excell,
Yet th'are diuine, and comes from me,
That knowes and loues you well:
Yet for my knowledge and my loue,
Accept it not, but for
His glorious name that fits aboue,
And is th'all gouernour.
I know you'll giue this meete respect,
And for your Noble name,
Time shall preserue, and still protect,
With the sweete lippes of fame:
To all posterities to come,
When this short life is past,
These lines shall liue, and when your tombe
Shall perish, these shall last.
