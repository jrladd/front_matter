Right Worshipfull Sir,
WHen I first put on Reso∣lutions of making this Discourse Publick, I found no Dispute within my self to whom the Dedication of it was a just Debt; the Sense of my many Obliga∣tions to you soon put me in mind, that the Discourse and the Author might deservedly Own the same Patron: the chief Errand upon which it came a∣broad,

being to make my gratefull Re∣sentments of them as well known to the World, as those great Endearments and noble Ʋsages you have past upon me, have been to all, both our Clergy and Gentry, on this side of the County of Hertford: 'Tis by your Donation that I enjoy a Comfortable Subsistence; 'tis you alone that have been the Au∣thor of the most visible Contentment I receive in this World; and not then to have paid you the just Tribute of my Duty and Thanks, in the Dedication of this Discourse, had been a palpable Contradiction to it, and made the Au∣thor himself a Heretick, at least in Morals, and an unpardonable Schisma∣tick and Separatist, both from Gratitude and Civility; for which he might have justly been Excommunicated from your good thoughts, which (next to that

dreadfull Excommunication from the Church) would, in his eye, be the greatest misfortune that could befall him. What title this Sermon had to a Visitation, it held from you in Capite; for it was by your means that the Au∣thor of it was admitted (I will not so lessen your kindness as to say a Mem∣ber) to be the Head and Rector of the Church of Ansty; it was you alone that preserv'd him, I cannot say from Schism, or Separation from the Church of England, (for be ever resolv'd to live and dye a dutifull Son to that in∣dulgent Mother) but from a Separa∣tion from the Church of Ansty. I am not ignorant how unfit a Present this Trifle is to be offered to such a Per∣sonage as Sir R. L. nor do I swell so much in my own conceit, as to think it any part of a just Return; I only de∣sire

it may pass as a small acknowledg∣ment of those many great favours you have heaped upon me, in the same manner as of old a pair of Doves were accepted from those, whose abilities could not reach to a Lamb: and unless that great God, who was pleased to imploy you as a great Minister of his Providence to me and mine, shall en∣able me, beyond either my deservings, or expectancies, to pay my great Debt I owe you, I must run further upon the Score with you, and in the deepest sense of duty and affection, court and grasp all opportunities of owning how much I am

From my Study at Ansty, this 20th. day of December 1672.
