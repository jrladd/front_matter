My LORD,
IF the subject
which I have
chosen, were ha∣bited
in such ap∣parell,
as belongs
to it; the world that knowes so

well your Lordship's accomplish∣ments,
would lesse blame me
of presumption in demanding your
eye and countenance. But I know
not what inclination to your per∣son,
having been the more ele∣vated
by some particular favour,
makes me promise to my selfe
I know not what acceptation above
merit: a thing wherein I should as
much flatter my self from the glorious
name of Sr PHILIP SIDNEY,
were he now living to be my Pa∣tron.
But you, my LORD, or
no other, being heir of his perfe∣ctions,
as you are of a higher

QUALITY to adorne them,
I humbly present this simple dresse
of truth and reallity (so far as I
could attain to it) to be credited
by your Lordships name, which is
a great authority to any intelli∣gence
of this nature (especially
FRANCE within the sphear)
and cloaked with your Lordships
favour, which however bounteous
makes no largesse unadvisedly,
that so it may not fail to be recom∣mended
to such spirits, as are more
curious, in a mode of readier en∣tertainment.

Wherein you shall
oblige infinitely,
My LORD,
