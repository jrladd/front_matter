Right worthy Sir,
I Litle thought of printing this Ser∣mon, when I preach't it, much lesse of dedicating it to your Worship, after I had resolued to print it. But I was per∣swaded vnto the one, by ma∣ny

of my freinds and audi∣tors (who do better conceit of it then I my selfe): and I am emboldned vnto the other; first, quadam affinitate, by some small alliance, which makes me to presume more vpon you, then vpon any other. Secondly, by the re∣port of your Worships loue towards vertue & learning, which, as most men say, ex∣ceeds your greatnesse: and herein you do no whit dege∣nerate from your Ancestors and forefathers, whose loue vnto learning did so abound, that their famous and chari∣table deeds, (of which both

the Vniuersitie of Cambridge, and many other places, can testifie) do aeternize their me∣mories, in the Register of euer-liuing fame: There let them liue, and may your Worship continue in trea∣ding their foot-steps, that your vertues may as long continue also after your ob∣sequies. And as I am bold to present vnto you this smal gift, this plaine Looking glasse; so I humbly intreat your Worship, as willingly to ac∣cept of it, and to looke in it, that being shrouded in the chamber of so worthy a Gen¦tleman, it may be kept from

being cracked by the ca∣lumniations of censorious tongues. So shall I remaine
