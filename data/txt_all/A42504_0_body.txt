SIR,
I Implore your pardon on the flexed knees of that grand respect which I must show diurnally, and owe you diuturnally for this Pyramidall presumption of obstetricating this
 Gygantick Birth, under your Pegasian, or ra∣ther Helliconian Patrage.
Your rash Negation will but irritate Al-Man-Sirs, and my just passion, in denying that Protection, which the Gods have courted us to accept under the Heaven-spreading lofty Wing of Joves Eagle, when she sits abrood on a Cloud to hatch Lightning and Thunder, with which her Master doth Tonnitruate and Fulminate the affighted inhabitants of the Universe in∣to a Non-entity of rational Intelligence.
That Pallas was the product of Jupiters Head-ach, Manu-ducted into the Society of Celestial existencies, by Vulcanian Midwifry, is an opinion not to be opposed, if we believe, no Fabulous dotage in Veterane Parnassites, or Hypocrenians: but who the Gossips were to this Jovial Off-spring, comes not within the vierge of our stricktest indigation, if none; a great oversight in the Gods to act a∣gainst approved custome.

To avoid which errour (for it seems the God of old, were subject thereunto as well as Mortals) I have udiciously elected you as Godfather for the Reciprcal Reputation of you both; your lofty expressions, and Al-Man-Sirs loud actions, having already timpani'd Fames Cheeks into the danger of a Rupture. For at the Inauguration of your vulgar-non-intelligible-invisible conceits (invisible I call them, because they soar out of the ken of dim-sighted Mortality) Ophtolmick Fame stood on Tip Toe, ready for the Wing, who, as soon as she heard you named, commenc'd her Com∣mission thence, and flew first through Englands Metrapols, in all the secret recesses thereof, then to its adjacent Suburbcarians, and in all places, with her Trumpet sounded the harmonious Levets of Pmmllian Eulo∣gies.
And that your Cheek may not seem to bor∣row tincture from Aurora's complection, for Patronizing what cannot claim desert, or me∣rit
 know, that Al-Man-Sir may boast of as much Deity as Pallas, and not inferiour in Metaphysical extraction, if you observe this parallel between them: Pallas proceeded from Joves Head, Al-Man-Sir from Mars hs Buttocks, by a slash in Battail, the first and Virgin cut of that bloody, yet bawdy Cornuter, thus you see he was begot by a Sword, conceived in a wounds Womb, and obstetticated, with the blood which flowed from the profundity thereof. Both their Genitors were Deities, yet differ in this, one is of the upper house, the other of the lower.
My final, and ultimate request is, that you, being placed in the Zenith of sublime fancy, will so instruct this Stripling, that he may no fall into the Nadit of low, and popular ex∣pression; cloath his understanding out of your Wardrope of hard words, such, so difficile, long, and Syllabically extended, that each word may require an half hour in the pronunciation; and when delivered and stretcht out, a whole
 league by the chain in length, and let them have so insufferable a sound, they may as in∣fallibly kill, as Cannon-shot at the same di∣stance. This will be a great ease to Al-Man-Sirs hands, and feet; the one will not be trou∣bled to foot out their Revenge, nor the other to hack and hew out the way, if his tongue, by your help may be furnished with words shall kill, as sure as his Sword, by this means, that, with his Battoon, will have some respit from their bloody Sweats, and labours, and for the ease you give those dreadful Executioners, their Master shall give you the Turn-over of their future Service, and I shall dayly pay you the tribute of my just admiration, whilst I am known to be,
