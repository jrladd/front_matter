Madam,
THE favourable Re∣ception, which you have been pleased to afford to my first Novel,

makes me hope the same Fa∣vour for this, I have now more need of your Prote∣ction than ever: I compose the History of a Man, who is so Generous to yield his Mistress to his Rival, and now there being but few Men capable of such great Things, and that Persons are rarely mov'd but with such things towards which they have some disposition, I have cause to fear the success of this Book. But, Madam, great and lofty Sentiments are met with in Royal Souls. Above all,

they are in yours in the Su∣perlative, and peradventure in that respect the Count D'Amboise may please you. If I durst entertain that Hope, I should have no cause to complain, seeing that those who would not be fit to relish it, would at least be capable of having a Respect for your Gusto. But it is not in that single Vow, Madam, that I take the liberty of presenting You with it, it is to have the Ambition of rendring You once more an Homage which is so justly due to

You by your eminent Qua∣lities, and above all by your Bounties. I am with a pro∣found Respect,
MADAM,
