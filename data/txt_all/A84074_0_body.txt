My Brethren,
I Spake last for the peace of the State; now I shall a word for yours (and all the Saints with you) in bonds. Heb. 13.3. This Scripture is still in force for all who are in bonds, we being of the same Body with them.
The Members of Christs Church, I mean the Church of the First-born written in heaven, which I hope to see on earth with you in spiritual glory; when all the scattered Saints, scattered in forms and flesh, are gathered up inâˆ£to One, and One in All.
