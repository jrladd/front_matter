MOst worthy Sir, I send into your view,
This litle Pamphlet, most of it is true,
According to my Dream, I yet commend,
I know no foolish man can you offend,
Of four and twenty Shepherds I did Dream,
Whereof Iames Grieve in Common-side was one,
An honest Man you know it sure,
And one that doth relieve the Poor,

Your Generous Noble Sp'rit, as I do understand,
Emboldens me to dedicat him to your hand,
He that may hunt in every inclosed Ground,
A Park of's own he needeth not to found,
The stately Staig, when he his horns hath shed,
In sullen sadness he deplores his loss;
But when a Wife cornuts her Husbands Head,
His gains in horns he holds an extream cross,
The Staig of lossing doth his loss complain,
The man by gaining doth lament his gain,
Thus whether horns he either loss or found,
They both the Loser and the Winner wound;
Hunting is pleasant, but yet wearisome,
To him that can no Venison obtain,
Thou worthy Swain chuse in Dianas stream,
Amongst the Sisters nine, and pick out one of them,
Wit, Courage, Valour, Stature, and State
Remain with thee, don't fear a horned Pate,
Now good Iames Grieve, I wish thy Flocks increase,
That thou may chant and sing, and still keep Iasons fleece.
