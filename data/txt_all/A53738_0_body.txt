SIR,
THE great and many Obligations, which I have received from your self and good Lady, made it easie to determine to whom I ought in Duty to direct this Discourse, as a publick Testimony of my Gratitude and Thankfulness. And truly, I have had a very great Longing, for some time, to meet with an Opportunity of paying my Respects to you in some eminent, visible way, to the end the World might see and know, what a grateful Sense I have of those Favours which I am never able to requite.
But there was another Consideration which did mightily prevail with me to ascribe this Sermon to your Patronage; and that is, the Agreeableness of this Subject of Loyalty with your Practice and Inclinations, who gave suffi∣cient and the most convincing Proofs of it in a time of Tryal, when Loyalty was going down the Wind, and when some People who had no just or

material Objection against Sir Jonathan Ray∣mund upon account of his fitness to serve the Publick, yet reflected upon his Loyalty, as his Crime, and that which, in their Opinion, did spoil all other Qualifications. But Sir, This has much redounded to your Honour and Repu∣tation among all good Men, that you did so slight the Censures of some malevolent People, who had ill Will against you, for no other Reason, but because you had such good will to His Majesty and his Government, as to shew your self such a brave Example of sted∣dy and unshaken Loyalty, in unstable Times; and one that out of pure Choice would under∣take to come in in the very heat of the Day, and steer the Affairs of a great City, when the Government was in great Distress, and pester'd with powerful and implacable Enemies on all sides. Nay, such is your Love of Majesty and Zeal for Loyalty, that you are promoting it in all Companies wherever you come; and, as I have particularly observed, you take singular Care to train up your Children the same way, and encourage nothing more, both in Children and Servants, than Loyalty to the Government.  such is your Temper and Humour, that you  not easily admit any as your Friend or Ser∣  who is not a true and trusty Subject. Your

House seems to me a kind of School and Semi∣nary of Loyalty; and you have so large a Stock and Treasure of it in your Self and Fa∣mily, that you are able to plant and furnish a whole Town.
But I fear I may be thought a Bold and Con∣ceited Man, for venturing such a plain and ea∣sie Discourse into the World, when there are Numbers of excellent Discourses upon this very Subject, which are no less elegant than profita∣ble. But as to this, I dare undertake to vin∣dicate my Self and Sermon too, forasmuch as the Subject I now treat on is so great and ex∣cellent in it self, that it needs no Flourishes or Advantages of Oratory, to recommend and set it off: And I humbly conceive, that the plainer it is, the fitter it will be for the plainer sort of People, which are most numerous; and if others shall blame me, for not whetting my Style, and using that Tartness of Expression, which is now the modish way of treating all Dissenters, and Persons that appear disaffected to the Govern∣ment; I answer, That Severity, in any sort, is much against my Nature, and that I have studiously declined all Satyr and Invectives, for this very Reason, Because I have known many hardned by that means, but never any con∣verted.

And now Sir, not to detain you any longer, I here present you with a plain Discourse of Loyalty, and the true and only way to preserve all People in Obedience to Authority; which as I am confident it will gain your Favour and Protection, for the sake of its Subject, so I hope it may do some general Good in the World in that way it is designed; which is the earnest Wish, and principal Aim of,
SIR,
