Worthy Sir,
I Imagine it altogether frivolous to make any Apology either for publishing this ensuing Treatise to the VVorld or Dedicating of it to your self, since (to my knowledge) had my Father lived some few Months longer, he would have done (though more accurately) both the one and the other. And truly Sir, I should have been very injurious both to the Manes of the Author (though Spirits are impossible) and to Your self also, should I have deteined from you that Legacy which was bequeathed to You by my deceased Father. The Storks gratitude is expressed at their coming into the VVorld: let His Victime be accepted at his going out.
In short, Sir; I cannot, without a deep resentment of my Infelicity accruing by my Fathers Death, sufficiently acknow∣ledge
and delineate your super-abundant favours conferred on him in his life, the least, of which might justly challenge a Publick Dedication; for all which (besides private Obligati∣ons to us all) I commend these Sermons to your serious consi∣deration, knowing that the memory of the Author (which is still precious to you), and your own natural propensity to good∣ness and clemency (in giving candid Interpretations of dubi∣ous actions), will be inducements sufficiently prevalent to cause you to excuse Errors not wilfully committed, and to cast a fa∣vourable Aspect upon this somewhat uncompleated plece.
Acccept therefore (I beseech you) these , which (though but dead Sacrifices, yet) I hope will be so far from pu∣trefaction, that they will be pleasing to the Nostrils both of God, and all good men. I conclude with that of Ruth, 1. v. 8. The Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me, which is the hearty Vote and unfai∣ned Desire of him, who is and ever shall be
