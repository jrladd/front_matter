Sir,
THe late Conspiracy was to put you out of all hopes, my Ambition is to take away despair by reminding you of your self, that in the midst of these meâˆ£naces, you may recreate in your natural courage and Innocency. For, (did we not know so much all ready) your Life, (which has been a scene of Miracles) may teach the World that Heaven has a peculiar regard for Princes, and among these, a yet more especial Love for such as your self, whose constitution imitates the divine Mercy. Fear not then Sir but

dwell in Smiles, under those Angels, those prayers, which daily are your Le guard de Corps. And thus in the arms of security, wealth, friends and health; may you still Rule Our Theosebia.
