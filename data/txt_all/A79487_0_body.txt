O ye Assembly of Mortal Gods,
I Formerly presented you with a Trea∣tise against Idols Temples; Here is a Tractate against Idols Times: It's in your power to demolish the Idols Temples, and abolish the idolatrous Times, and to suppress the prophane crew of Chrismas-mongers, and ex∣pel such unclean Spirits from your coasts, and destroy the names of the Idols out of these places.
The Antichristian sect of Chrismas-mongers is of many hundred years standing, and to be rooted out; espe∣cially considering that it hath over-spread the Nations like a Gangrene; and this their way is their folly, yet their posterity approve of their sayings, Psal. 49.13. And although their fore-fathers have inherited lying vanities, yet they will not be wiser: But you (Legislators) have a restraining power over them, and therefore I am bold humbly to present these lines following unto you who are the Heads of the People, and leave you to do as God shall per∣swade your hearts, and so rest,
