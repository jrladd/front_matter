May it please your Lordship,
AS it was an Act of the Highest Charity and Conde∣scention
in your Lordship, (upon Dr. Lloyd's
Motion) so speedily and effectually to Address
your self to his Majesty for a Reprieve of my Bo∣dy
from Death, for some small time, in order to the Prepa∣ration
of my Soul for that Eternity I am ready to enter on;
so that I think my self in Duty and Gratitude obliged, not
only to give some Account to the World how that time is Em∣ployed,
but also to submit this Account to be Ordered and
Disposed of as shall seem best to your Lordships great Wis∣dom.
If it be thought useful, (as I hope it may be a loud
Caveat against bold and daring Impiety) I humbly desire it
may not steal abroad, but take along with it the Honour
as well as authority of your Lordship's Imprimatur. That
Learned and Charitable Person which Presents it to your
Lordship, has promised to Order and Dispose of the confusion
of these loose Papers, so as shall be least troublesome to your
Lordship in the Perusal; and to make my Apology for Pre∣senting
them to such an Honourable Hand, in such a Rude
and Disorderly Form. The Circumstances of my present

Condition will not suffer me to put them in any better: But
what I have now Presented to your Honour is sincerely the
Truth, and there is not a Tittle here but what is the Exact
Transcript of those Impressions I find upon my Conscience.
I hope they may in some measure contribute to the Advance∣ment
of His Glory, whom I have so beyond all Example dis∣honoured;
and convince all that are not willing to catch at
irrational Inferences to support themselves in their Atheisme
and Debauchery, That our Excellent Religion, and this Sa∣cred
and Honourable Profession, are not to be Judged
and disparaged for the Miscarriages of such unsound Mem∣bers
as I have been. This gives me also some Ground
to hope, that I shall obtain▪ your Lordships Pardon and
Prayers, together with that of the numerous Clergy under
your Lordship's Government, in this great and populous Ci∣ty;
which I most humbly and heartily begg. God continue
your Honour to be what you are, as great an Ornament to
the Protestant Profession, as I have been a Scandal to it.
In a deep Sense of your abundant Charity, I shall not cease to
improve that Breath you have borrowed for me, as for my
Own, so for
