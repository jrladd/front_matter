RIGHT NOBLE AND RIGHT VERTVOVS,
FOR these two titles due vnto your HONOVR (one from your An∣cestours, the other from your owne worth and endeauours blessed by grace from heauen) these glorious Saincts of our natiō doe willingly pre∣sent their liues vnto your eyes to suruey them, and their prayers for your soule to profitt by them. The poore Historian, who making the first triall of his penne,

hath out of diuers auncient monuments gathered their faithfull Legends, with as great diligence and true simpli∣citie as he could, perswaded himself, that, then your HO∣NOVR no man could challenge more right in the dedica∣tion of these first fruits of his labours, and that the Saincts them selues would haue no other Patrone of their holy stories then You, who loue to reade them, to serue them, to imitate them: And he him self, and all of his coate and familie acknowledging You their noble fauourer, iud∣ged it a plaine obligation to protest by this publick profession, the high eslceme they haue of your honourable loue vnto them, and the loyall endeauours they will all waies employ, to pray for your HONOVR'S eternall happines, and dayly encrease in prosperitie, and heauenly blessings. It may please your HONOVR to pardon this bouldnes, and esteeme of them, as yours truely deuoted, and of me the vnworthiest amōgst them, as oe who thinketh it the grea∣test honour to be thought,
