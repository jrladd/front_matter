LET some with, servile, mean
Devices bow,
And bend their Souls, as well
as Bodies, low;
Flatter the Great, cringe deep, to gain Esteem,
And by their own Dishonour, honour them.
By Wiles like these, new Favours, poorly
claim;
I pay your Lordship, but what's paid by
Fame,
'Tis through your Merits, not my own, I
choose
Thus to salute you by my rising Muse;
Not fawning low, like others must she sue,
She must fly up, to pay Respect to you.
Let others spread their Patron's Feathers far,
The Toys of Peace, your Laurels spread
thro' War.
Some Pride in Wreaths, which bolder Arms
have made,
But your own conquering Hands have
deckt your Head.
To you, my Lord, a double Crown is due,
At once the Hero, and the Poet too.
Since NASSAW'S Actions still remain untold,
While Dryden lives; immortal; yet he's old.
'Tis you, we hope, will make them far a∣dor'd,
And serve him with your Pen, as well as
Sword.
Beyond his Trumpets Clangors, make them
known,

Name NASSAW'S Acts, and all must know
your own.
With Powers unequal, I the Task resign,
A Task too great for any Strength,—but
thine.
What other Genius can our Sovereign choose?
War's your Delight, Bellona is your Muse.
Your Pen and Sword with like Success you
wield,
Fam'd thro' your Study, glorious thro' the
Field.
With the same vigour and impulse of thought,
Now may you write, as thro' the Plains you
fought.
In the Attempt, tho' my weak Genius fail,
Be pleas'd at least, to recommend my Zeal.
Unknown, this Favour dare I humbly claim,
Unknown to you, my Lord, unknown to
Fame.
I, like those Soldiers, which in War you led,
Disdain to fear, while I have you, my Head;
Your well-rais'd Greatness my Success secures,
I grow assur'd of Fame, by trusting yours.
Great both in Arts and Arms; our Iove, in
you,
Secures his Lightning, and his Thunder too.
Thus, shou'd your Judgment my Presump∣tion
blame,
Pleas'd shall this Semele expire in Flame;
To you, my Lord, most fit, this Suit I move,
You, who are plac'd at the Right Hand of
Iove.
