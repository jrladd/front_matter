May it please your Majesties;
THE present Enjoyment of our Religion
and Liberty being wholly owing, under
Heaven, to your Majesties; and the Pre∣servation
of them having engaged your Majesties
in an expensive War with the most powerful E∣nemy
to the Religion and Prosperity of this Na∣tion;
It is become the Duty of every particular
Person (as well as of the whole Body of the Peo∣ple)
to contribute his Endeavour for securing
and perpetuating those inestimable Blessings. This
Consideration engaged me upon those Thoughts
which I have digested in the following Treatise,

and now mst humbly present to your Majesties:
Wherein I principally aim'd to furnish your Ma∣jesties
with the Hearts and Purses of your Sub∣jects,
by proposing such a Method for the Supply
of your Majesties, that it shall be their very Inte∣rest
to support your Majesties and the Govern∣ment,
whether in Peace or War.
It is the peculiar Felicity of our Constitution
that makes this Design practicable only in Eng∣land,
(for no People under an Absolute or Ar∣bitrary
Government is capable of it;) and if my
Zeal does not blind my Judgment, I think I have
laid a Foundation for this Nation's Greatness and
Riches, which none of our Neighbours are capa∣ble
of disturbing, or arriving to themselves.
That your Majesties may long enjoy the
Fruits of it, and the Nation long enjoy the
Happiness of your Government, is the hearty
Prayer of
