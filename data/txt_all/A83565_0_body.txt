Worshipful and wel-beloved,
I Cannot say of these indigested Meditations as the Apostle St. Paul said of himself, That he was one that was born out of due time; for your impor∣tunity to print them, was a good argument of hope, that they took some considerable impression upon your hearts when they dropt from me, and that they were words spoken in due season; which Solomon compares to apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.
Did not the love of Christ constrain me, yet loyalty to our Soveraign, and love unto your City, and your souls, are like so many goads to prompt me to this pub∣lication; and I should appear to be too head-strong, to draw back, with so many spurs in my sides to prick me for∣wards.
Had I a minde to apologize, the most I have to say, would
be this; Its pity but so sublime a Theam had met with a more sublimated Oratour: but naked loyalty in plain Eng∣lish, looks more lovely then a painted strumpet in the fairest dress. The inward comfort, and consciousness of loyalty to God and man, are to be preferred far before the external reputation of Wit and Eloquence; this hath the head for its subject, which is subject to the Vertigo, and many other Capi∣tal distempers; but that, the heart, which is primum Vi∣vens, & Ultimum moriens; the first noble part that lives, and the last that dies. This is but aerial, and may extinguish like a Meteor with a falling blaze; the other is like a Star of the highest altitude, and greatect Magnitude, fixed in its sphere: till Heaven and Earth pass away, the least iota of it falls not to the ground.
Yet having now to do with men whose hearts must be led by their ears, I could now wish that I had the tongue of the learned, that I could speak like Steven, with such a Spirit, and so much authority, that no adversary should be able to resist. It's fabulously storyed of Amphion, that he played so melodiously upon a Lute that Mercury gave him, that the stones followed him to the building of Thebes, into the places where they should be laid. The moral is, That he was King of Thebes, and by his wonderful and rhetorical Suada, he brought a people of rude and stony hearts, to live together peaceably and lovingly in that place, under his do∣minion. Our gracious Soveraign hath a most notable faculty in that Art of winning men over to themselves, to one ano∣ther, and to him; and in this Treatise I have touched a few strings of his own tuning: it's to be doubted, I have sounded a charm to many a deaf Adder, to many a heart of stone, and heart of oake; of which I must be constrained to say in the end of a Labour in vain, I have piped unto you, but you have not danced: and indeed, in most places there
are so many knotty and cross-grayn'd blocks, that they are not worth the labor of cleaving; of whom it may be said, as it was said of Pharaoh, that proverb of obstinacie and obduration, That neither Ministry, nor Misery, nor Miracles, nor Mercy, could work upon him so as to mollifie his heart. And indeed, if you look well about you, we have had all these means in the bundle, and there are yet too many in this Land of vision (which is like Goshen, where the children of Israel had light in all their dwellings, when the Plague of darkness covered all the rest of the Land of Egypt) that have frustrated fair means, and foul means, and all means which have been spent upon them, & are still setled upon their lees, frozen in their dreggs, and lie soaking in their lusts, as if God had punished their sinful blindness and hardness with paenal blinding and hardning. And yet it's reasonably and charitably to be hoped, that God hath his thousands in Eng∣land that have not bowed the knee to Baal, nor worshipped Jeroboam, nor his Calves; and that we may meet with many choice, and smoother peeces, from which Gods work∣men may get credit and comfort, by their planting and wa∣tering labours, by their preparing and polishing; & God may have the glory, by giving an increase. However, duty is our part, and we must commit the success to God.
I appeared to your summons with the more confidence when I came to deliver it viva voce, considering that as I spake to a single Congregation, so I spake it in the house of friends: but now being to speak unto the multitude of friends and foes, and in such a censorious age, I should write Manu tremula, with a shaking hand, had I not in some measure learned to pass through thick and thin, through evil report and good. Suspecting that these inconsiderable lines will be sent from Critick to Critick, as a poor vagrant from Constable to Constable, I have taken the boldness to give
it a Pass under the name of your City, that such male-contents as will not afford it house-room and lodging, may send it to the place where it was born; beseeching you to entertain it for the Lords sake, and to think favourably of the Author for the works fake; who desires, while he lives, to serve his Generation, and to live no longer then he may approve himself to be thankful unto God, loyal to the King, faith∣ful to the Church, and
