BEcause sicknesse hath re∣strained mee from prea∣ching, I am content to doe anye good by writing. Happye is that Author which is in stead of other, that after his Booke is read, men neede reade no moe of that matter. I goe on a Theame which many haue trauersed before mee prolixely, or cursorily, or barrenly: If I Reuerendis. Couerdalū excipio. haue performed by studie any more than the rest, let my reader iudge, and giue glory to him which teacheth by whome he will. What I haue endeuored, my selfe doo feele, and others knowe. We are ig∣norant of many things for a few that we vnderstand: but I haue bin alwaye a∣shamed, that my writings shoulde waigh lighter for want of paines, which



is the bane of Printing, and surfetteth the Reader. Now I send thee like a Bee to gather Honie out of slowers, and weedes. Euery Garden is furnished with others, and so is ours. Reade, pray, and med; thy profit shall be little in any booke, vnlesse thou reade alone, and vn∣lesse thou reade all. It is one of the births of my fainting, therefore take it with a right hand, and if thou finde any thing that doth make thee better, I repent not that others importunitie hath obtained it for thee. Farewell. As Iacob blessed his sonnes when he left them, so now I Gen. 49. 1. must leaue my fruite to others, I pray God to blesse it, that it may bring foorth fruit in other, and be the sauour of life to 2. Cor. 2. 16. all that reade it.
