SIR,
MY special respects and obligements to your self, was that which drew me forth upon this service: What was preacht at your desire, is now publisht under your Name. If I have spoken somewhat free∣ly in matters of so great concernment; it will be (I hope) in these times of freedome, if not commendable, yet par∣donable: Et veniam pro laude peto. I am not ignorant, that the World is even surfeted on Sermons, many ha∣ving been hearers so long, that now like them that live by the falls of the River Nilus, they are grown spiritually deaf, hear no more. But the occasion of this Sermon is
not ordinary, may be less hereafter; and such as will not patiently heare, may possibly better see their own errour, who while they pluck one stake after another out of the hedg of Government, endanger the laying all flat and level.
Magistracie and Ministery are the great stays of the World, preservatives of Order, Distinction and Reve∣rence. The Ministery is the Magistrates guard, bank and bulwark; of singular use, even to civil peace and obe∣dience, unless we can believe that a people will honour Magistrates, and obey their Laws, that through barba∣rous irreligiousness fears neither God nor men. But some men are so unjust as to desire a Ministery, and yet to grudg them their maintenance, unless what's next to none, an arbitary, poor and uncertain one, as hard to come by, as to live on.
SIR, be you pleased still to continue a cordial friend to Magistracie and Ministery, Religion and Learning, Piety and Sobriety; which will engrave you on the Annals of Time, a true Common-wealths-man: Praying the blessings of Heaven on you and yours, I rest
