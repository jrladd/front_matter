Gentlemen,
AS your Society even ab origine hath de∣servedly acquired an eminency in many respects above others of this kind; so more especi∣ally
for the pregnancy of its Members in the composing of Peals. For when the Art of Cross-pricking lay enveloped in such obscurity, that it was thought impossible that double Changes on five bells could be made to extend farther than ten, and triple and double Chan∣ges on six farther than sixty; then it was that a worthy and knowing Member of your Society, to dissipate those mists of Ignorance, and to usher in the bright morn of Knowledg, prickt those much applauded Peals of Grandsire and Grandsire Bob; which for their excellency have for many years together
continued triumphant in practice amidst all others whatsoever; and which indeed have been a great light in the production of that great variety of new Peals herein contained; the greatest part of which being also the off∣spring of your Society, I there∣fore thought fit to usher them into the world under the wings of your Protection.
Gentlemen, as a member I held my self obliged to add my Mite to your full fraught Treasury of Speculative and Practical Know∣ledg of this kind; though I con∣fess your acquisition on this ac∣count will be very mean, since my want of ability sufficient to
undertake a thing of this nature, and also want of opportunity by converse with others to sup∣ply my own defects, have ren∣dred the Book less acceptable than it might have been done by some more knowing head and acuter Pen. And although I am conscious that it meriteth not your acceptance; yet I as∣sume the confidence to believe that you will favour it with a kind entertainment amongst you; and the rather; for that I know you are too judicious to sentence it without first casting into the ballance of your indif∣ferent judgments some Grains of Allowance: The countenance
you shew it will silence Detra∣ctors, and be Armour of proof against the fools bolts which may happen to be soon shot at the Author, who is
Gentlemen,
