IF ever it was true, it is now, That
Scribimus indocti, docti{que} So that it
may grow almost a question,
whether now the Sword, or Pen is
most busie? or more effusion of Ink, or Blood?
What here offers it self to your view, comes

from a modest and peaceable hand and
heart, and meerly relative to the good of
those Countries, whose happiness I am con∣fident
you prefer before any particular inte∣rest.
Conceptions of this kinde I have not
yet seen any; and though (praised be God)
our hands are pretty well restrained, yet that
our hearts be wholly purged of the old poy∣son,
there is some slender endeavour to in∣form
our Country-men with the right un∣derstanding
of the Parliament, and its prin∣ciples,
and clear demonstrations of Gods
speciall providence and goodnesse in its pre∣servation;
so that to harbour a thought a∣gainst
it, we must take heed we be not found
To fight against God:Act. 5. I confesse them but a
rude heap of thoughts; I have laboured to be
Seneca his Scholar, and in writing to observe
his rule, not so much the Quemadmodum, as
the Quid, being assured None can be more
eloquent, then he that hath well conceived a
Truth; It is with things of this kinde, as
with burthens of the womb that are teemed
with perturbations and dangers, they prove
lesse thriving; and what is here might have
appeared more comely, had they not been

conceived at such times and places, when
and where indeed I durst not scarce owne
them as Thoughts. Worthy Sirs, whatever
they are, they implore your favourable ac∣ceptance,
they court neither for praise nor
preferment; If the poore Author may not
still be under the insultation of our old ene∣mies,
Mutato nomine, and enjoy but Common
Iustice, it is the Apex of his desires: I would
not be behinde for my poore Mite to fur∣ther
the great work, which (blessed be God)
I hope I may say is a finishing, wherein I,
not unlike that Bird, (that is fabled) when
the Kings of Asia contributed great treasures
to the building of a Temple, it having no
other wealth, went thither to present her
Feathers.
Truth was never without adversaries, but
never more mortall ones then now. You
may see I have drawn in its quarrel: You are
Gods champions, and its; I humbly beg
I may not suffer, but let your countenance
and protection be at hand, and I shall hum∣bly
pray, that as He hath singled you to be
Instruments of His glory here, you may so

act, and honour Him, that hath so honoured
you, that you be partakers of His glory and
blisse for evermore.
The Prayer of him who ever hath been, and will
be ever really devoted to You in this great ser∣vice
of GOD and his Country,
