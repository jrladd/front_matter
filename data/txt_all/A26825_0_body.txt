THe Author, as to the first
part of his Animadversi∣ons
touching the late mo∣tions
of the State, in the
visible pursuance of Ar∣bytrary
power, presents
them not as newes to a
Court of Parliament, the evidence whereof be∣ing
obvious to all the world, onely hee ranckes
them here in a new fyle, for satisfaction of the
incredulous Malignant, not capable to owane
his owne friends, neither will be sensible what
your indefatigable labours have beene, or take
notice of the pains you have taken, during these

foure yeares, for Preservation of the common
freedome and liberties of the Kingdome.
As to the second part, which is a narrative,
touching the Warre under the conduct of major
Generall Laughorns, it is offered to all of discer∣ning
Iudgements, how mirakculously Gods spe∣ciall
providence hath evidently appeared as well
in that particular of the County of Pembrook as in
the Generall prosperity of the Kingdoms armes.
The conclusive part, is both humbly mono∣tory
and petitionary, that, that poore dessolated
County, with the parts adiacent may be timely
taken into your compassionate consideration,
and such a speedy course taken therein as may
best suit with your present great and urgent af∣fairs:The inve∣terate fewds and dissentions of this County, hath beene a great hin∣drance to the publike service, and if not time∣ly com∣posd, may be of a more dangerous consequence
The distressed condition whereof (through
Gerrards cruelties) is truly laid open unto you; as
also the way of this Counties repaire (in some
competent measure) humbly presented in a few
Propositions, which may both rectifie the many
grievances and dissentions of this County, toge∣ther,
with the disorder of the Souldier; with∣out
other charging the State, or farther
troubling, your important Consultations,
otherwise, then in your timely designation of
some honest and able Gentlemen, (as your Com∣missioners,

to examine all grievances, especially
in the behalfe of such, as have suffered in the losse
of their whole estates in the publike service, and
are at present reduced to extreame want and pe∣nury,
the care whereof in all humblenesse is de∣sired
and left to your pious providence, least the
constant party there should bee utterly disheart∣ned,
and at such time, as there may be present use
of their farther service, since probable it is, that
the Irish Rebels (on their late victory) may
thrust over such Forces into that County and Mil∣ford
-Haven, as may turn the Skales of your Victo∣ries
here (if not timely prevented, by garding
those Coasts with a strong Fleete,) both the
Welch Nation, and English Malignants in the
generall (howsoever now mastered) retaining
still their wonted hearts, may in all likely-hood
on all occasions joyne with the strongest.
And thus in all humilitie hath the Author ta∣ken
the boldnesse to present unto your wisdoms
the whole scope of his poore indeavours, and
humbly craves farther leave to concludewith the
Oracles of two great Princes, wishing, that they
may profit such, as they most concerne.
The strength of a King is the preservation of
the State,King James his Speech in Parlia∣ment, 1609. the foundation thereof, is the people,

and woe unto them, which devides the weale of a
King from that of the Kingdome.
How guilty the Delinquent and malignant
party have beene in the fomentation of the pre∣sent
devisions, the appeale is made to their owne
Consciences, which have most unnaturally inva∣ded
the people in their representative, and have
indeavoured to deprive both King and King∣dome
of their great Councell.
Aequius est me tot, & talium amicorum consilium,
quam tot & tales, meam unius voluntatem sequi.
How averse His Majesties great heart hath
beene in following the vestigia of this famous
Emperor and how fatall to himselfe, let 3. ruined
Kingdomes be the Arbiters, and his owne con∣science
the faithfull umpier.
