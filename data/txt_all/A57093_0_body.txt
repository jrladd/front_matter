MADAM,
THE following Play seems naturally to claim the Pa∣tronage of a Lady, for which Reason no true Englishman will wonder that the first Person who occurred to my Thoughts on this occasion should be the Dutchess of Marlborough.
Not all the Security we enjoy by our safe and honourable Peace, can make us unmindful of the Gratitude we owe to your Name. All the Blessings which have been procured for us by our late Treaties, are not greater, than what might have been expected from the long Course of the Duke of Marlborough's Victories.
If we are at leisure to cultivate the Politer Arts, if our Trade flourishes, if our Credit rises both at Home and A∣broad, if we have obtained a general Peace for our Allies, if the Catalans are obliged to us for our Protection, the Ger∣mans or our Faith, and the French for our Generosity; who could have promi∣sed to themselves less Honours and Ad∣vantages for their Country, from the ma∣ny Glorious Campaigns and uninterrupted Successes of our late Great General.
It has been often observed, that when the French have been worsted in the Field they have saved themselves by Treaties; but such are the consummate Abilities o our present Ministers, that the World is as much astonish'd at their Negotiations,

s it was before at the Duke of Marlbo∣rough's Conquests.
There are indeed too many among us, who are apt to be affrighted at every thing that seems to threaten our Religion and Liberties; but why should private Men believe themselves in any Danger from the Pretender, when the Govern∣ment is not apprehensive of it? But this is certain, we have less Reason to be so while He is still living who has so often defeated the Ambition of France, and broken its best concerted Measures.
Among the many eminent Virtues which I might here take occasion of ce∣lebrating in your Grace, I shall only single out that which I believe your Grace will be most delighted to hear mentioned, I mean that truly conjugal Frindship and Affection with which you accompany this Great Man in His Absence from His na∣tive Country, and share with him in all the Cares and Inquietudes his Extraordi∣nary Merit has brought upon him.
That You may have many Years in re∣serve for your own mutual Happiness as well as for your Country's Good, i the hearty Desire of every honest Man and particularly of, Madam,
