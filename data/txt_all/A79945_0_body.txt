MADAM,
NEver were the Scales so even be∣tweene presumption and dispaire as they are now poysed in the as∣piring votary, for as the height of your Judgement makes me justly diffident of my unworthy offering, so I am assured your censure will relent in pardon; when you looke upon it as an error of devotion, the same alter which disdains the acceptance of my blemished sacrifice, will neverthelesse give refuges and protection to your grove∣ling offenders: Madam, It is a violation of your worth, to present you with vanities, all sacriledge is not dressed after the fashio∣nable cut of this age, in Rapine and Rob∣berie, it may bee committed in giving,
where the gift is a demunition and by a scandalous homelinesse, profanesse, as it were the very consecration, but I will not traverse your Ladiships commands by plea∣ding the meanesse of the trifle you have dey∣ned to require, I am resolved to obey you at all adventures, and with the losse both of credit and modestie to inhance my obser∣vance, let others in their addresses seek af∣ter fame, and by choosing Honourable Gossips to their pettie Issue, drive a lustre from their Dedications, my endeavours are of a more bashfull Mode, then to aske bles∣sing of the sunne, yet since your Ladiships summons hath beene pleased to intitle them to a roome in your Cabinet, that Ca∣binet which alone is Theater sufficient for all the rarities and perfections of the Age, they shall attend you Madam, but striped of all interest since a sinceere obedience, as you may see by my enclosed Committee∣man, who is so voyd of Ornament that he seemes to be shaped, after his new Modell of self deniall, Madam it is a Brittish tri∣bute
that Antiquity paid in the head of wolves, how aptly this present of the Committee-man revives the Custome; for as his ravenous nature hath a neere alliance with that of the other, so nonefitter to re∣turne to the first fruits, of his tributary pu∣nishment.
Than your Ladiship who have suffered so much by the savage Beast in your worry∣ed fortune, in which my attempt of vin∣dicative Justice, if my abillities have not kept pace with my desire, if my revenge be not as keene and poynant as the malice of my subject, it will be your Charity to ima∣gine that I was dull upon designe, and did industriouslly rebate my Edge to prolong the Torment of his execution, I desire Madam, let me bee your supplyant in this, that when you have guilded the Pa∣per with the beams of your proposall, you will confine it after to shade and solli∣tude, both because Satyrs like Bandog ac∣quire a fiercenss by being tyed up, and with∣all because it is the opinion of your servant
that published Compositions are but so many Breves that wander for the Als
 of approbation.
MADAM,
