ELect Lady,2. Ioh. 1.2. (for so S. Iohn sty∣leth an Honourable Matrone to whom hee sent his se∣cond Epistle) your holy sor∣row for the losse of the for∣mer Illustrious, and former service to the excellent gracious Prince CHARLES, deserue much respect of all good harts. VVith these, another argument particular∣ly doth incite me to offer this service, a sacri∣fice of my sorrow to your worthy hands: The grace and Countenance you afford Religion and her followers, which will bring a blessing vpon you and your posterity, as is already apparent in those fruitfull beautifull Oliue branches your
sonnes, of whom our (ollege is much ioyfull, be∣cause they are so truely hopefull adding to No∣bility of birth Nobility of vertue. Continue Noble Lady to bee a faithfull client for truth, your sex in scripture hath had honourable ex∣amples, & this age hath a holy example of you. Painted sepulchers shall rot, and Popish Hypo∣crites shall rise to sorrow, when, after many and happy yeares in this world, you shall appeare with ioy before God with Sara, Rebecca, Debo∣ra, Davids Abigail, Salomons Sulamite, and the Noble Sunamite in the better world. And so with my devotions for your Noble husband, your ver∣tuous selfe & all yours, wishing you all the bles∣sing of both Testaments, and both liues, I rest
