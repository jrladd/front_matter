RIght Honourable, your zealous loue to diuine studies, hath made the Muses of that Nature, to present your fauour, with the best fruites of their delights, which in the exer∣cise of their spirituall Contemplations, haue brought sorth these comfortable Meditations: which bound vp in this little volume, they haue presumed with my seruice, to present to your good Ladyship, be∣seeching the same, with that good fauour to accept them, that may vnder heauen be the greatest grace, that they desire vnto them. It is intituled, The

Harmony of the Soule, who in the gracious thoughts of Gods blessing, and humble talke with his mercy, thinkes her selfe halfe in heauen ere shee come there: where, after that you haue passed a happy pilgrimage on this earth, God send you the eternall felicitie of the faithfull.
