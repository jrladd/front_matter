Right Honourable and Right Worshipfull,
LOyalty as it is the Kings Joy, the Kingdomes Happinesse, So the Sub∣jects Glory; So long then as your Hearts continue Loyall, your Names shall continue Glorious, being hereby a meanes to restore Joy to your King, and recover Happinesse to the Kingdome. To you I Dedicate my Labours, That as they afford a Lesson, So you a Patterne, both of Loy∣alty; whereby men may be the better moved either to yeeld the one their Practise, or the other their Imitation, Besides (Right Ho∣nourable, and Right Worshipfull) They who

take up Armes against the King, will not faile to take vp Armes against the Author, and Arguments too against his Worke. Your Patronage therefore must be my Refuge, and whilst you are pleased to Protect my person, I feare not (by Gods Assistance) to main∣taine the Truth. Not in confidence of mine owne Ability's (for they are too weake) but because (as Their Acclamation before Darius) Magna est Ʋeritas & Praevalecit: Great is Truth and it will Prevaile. You have Uouchsafed these Sermons your Approbati∣on in the Pulpit, you have honoured them with your Command to the Presse; and now my request is, that you will be Pleased to Countenance them with your Patronage to the Publique Veiw; In which I am confi∣dent nothing is delivered, but what may be∣seeme either the Tongue, or the Pen of a good Christian, of a Loyall Subject, And of

York, Novemb. 20. 1642.
