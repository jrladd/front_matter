Madam;
I Believe, no discerning Reader will
question my Judgement in point of
Election, nor accuse my Election of
much presumption in Dedicating
this princely new piece to your La∣diship.
Touching the first, the Fancy comming from
that Country which doth challenge as much Inte∣rest
in your Illustrious blood as England, I humbly
conceived it might well become your Ladiship to
be Patronesse thereof.
Touching the second reason, it having been not
onely Represented, but Acted so many times (and
reserv'd yet for entertaining Pimentel the Spanish

Ambassador) by a Great King in person, with such
a number of Princes, Princesses, Nobles, and a∣bove
a hundred Representators besides, so that
the charge of the scene and shewes amounted to
half a million of French liures; But above all, it
being an invention so cryed up, so well contriv'd
and trac'd, so full of wit, and variety of Musicall
airs, with other gentilesses; I deem'd it would be a
thing not unworthy of your Ladiships private en∣tertainment.
Lastly, Madam, the Fancy being so fresh, and
sutable to the season, it comes to usher in a hap∣py
and healthfull spring to your Honor, attended
with affluences of all Felicity present and future,
according to the humble and pregnant votes of
My most Highly Honored Lady,
The first of May
1654.
