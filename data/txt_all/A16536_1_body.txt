MADAME,
I Heere humbly dedicate unto your Ladiship, now of tender yeeres these two compends of the Catechisme.
Saint Iohn, the Cu∣sin, and beloved Disciple of Iesus Christ, who for his high doctrine was compared to an Eagle that mounteth very high, dis∣dained not to write unto Children. In one chapter of a short Epistle hee hath▪ I write unto you little children;1 Joh. 2 12▪ vers. 13 and againe in the same words, I write unto you little children; of that his writing

hee giveth two reasons; the one is in these words, because your sins are for∣given you for his Names sake; the other reason is in these words, because yee have knowne the Father: For this end, Madame, have I written unto you these two compends, that yee may know the Father; whom I most humbly intreat to increase his graces begun in your Lady∣ship in a good measure▪
From Glasgow
the 19. of Ianuar, 1639.
