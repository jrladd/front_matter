I Haue aduentured (Right Honou∣rable Lord) vnder your Noble pro∣tection, to publish to the world, a poore testimony of my loyalty to my Prince and Countrey. A little Pamphlet it is, but a sweete comfort, and a sound counsell for good Subiects, describing many fayre examples of Traytours foule ends; shewing, that the reward of Treason, is destruction, and after death, lasting in∣famy.
The matter agreeing with the condition of this troublesome time, hath made mee the bolder to present it to your Honourable censure: Acceptance I doe not doubt; for no good subiect can mislike it. For here, in the name of Experience, I aduise all men, whose heads clyme aboue the heyght of their present con∣ditions,

to make loyall and honest actions, the Ladder of their aduauncement, which will commend them with a beloued life, or an honorable death, when Trea∣son is the Hatchet that seuereth life, and ioyneth In∣famy vnto death. The Lord be with your Honour in all your affayres; for whose health and Honorable prosperity, the good subiects of England conti∣nually pray.
