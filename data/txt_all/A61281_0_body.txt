May it Please Your Grace,
THAT the few follow∣ing Discourses may have the Privilege of recom∣mending themselves to the World, by the Honour of your Grace's Protection. Of which how un∣deserving soever the Quality of the Performance may be, yet the
 Design, I assure my self, is every way worthy a Patron of your Grace's Goodness and Character. For this is purely to enforce a se∣rious and active Application of Mind to those Practical Duties of Religion, wherein the very Life and true Excellence of Chri∣stianity consists. In order here∣unto, I have endeavoured to re∣move some of those false Preten∣ces, whereby Men olther suffer themselves to be diverted from the most necessary and useful parts of Religion, or are supported in a Wicked Course, or are apt to be discouraged in a Good One. And I hope, these Matter are (I am sure I intended they should be) stated in perfect Agreement with the Sense of that Church, which Your Grace, while in an in∣feriour Station, did adorn with so conspicuous a Piety, Vigilance, and
 every Pastoral Vertue; and whereof the Good Providence of God hath now so deservedly ad∣vanced You to be the Common Spiritual Father.
But, Besides the Right Your Grace hath to the Work it self, You have also a very particular one to the Author, Whose La∣bours have been all along favour∣ed with your Countenance and Encouragement; and Who ever since your Promotion to the Epi∣scopal Order, hath had the Hap∣piness to live under Your Grace's Inspection, formerly in Your Di∣ocesan, and now in Your Metro∣political Capacity.
These, my Lord, are sufficient Inducements for my offering this Tribute of Gratitude and Filial O∣bedience: and will not suffer me to doubt the favorable Acceptance of a Publick Acknowledgment, upon
 so many Accounts your Due. In which I shall detain Your Grace no longer, than while I beg you to believe, that I esteem my self in a peculiar manner obliged (not only by my hearty Prayers to Al∣mighty God, for his constant Blessing and extraordinary Assi∣stance upon all Your Grace's De∣signs for the Good of his Church committed to your Charge, but) by every Instance of Reverence and Duty in my Power, to ap∣prove my self,
My LORD,
