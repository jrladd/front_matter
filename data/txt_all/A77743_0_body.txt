SIR,
COULD I be ungrateful, your Name had never been prefixed to this Sermon: For as you were pleased to command me this last Office of respect to the Deceased, of which you gave me an Example but a few Months before on the like sad and sorrowful Occasion that call'd us together as Mourners: So 'tis but Justice you should allow me the liberty, when my dearest Friends go off the Stage so fast, to express my Thankfulness for one living, whose Friendship is so greatly valuable.
Any who know me, know I truly rejoice in the hap∣py Relation that favours me with the honour of calling you Tutor, or Brother. Reading, and Books, have been but part of my small Improvement; Your Friend∣ly and Affable Converse in your Family, and since, has been such as I must blame my own Dulness for, if
I have not been advantaged thereby. We were ever mutually dear one to the other; distance and absence have but heightened our Reciprocal Affections; that on your part must be owned the result only of a kind ge∣nerous Disposition; but on mine, as a just Tribute paid to your real Worth.
And may it be yet our Emulation, which of us shall continue the most Affectionately Cordial: May the God of Heaven long lengthen out your days of Service to his Church; and Crown therein your Ministerial Labours with the most blessed Success:
There are none more desirous of it, than is,
SIR,
