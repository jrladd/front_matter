MAECENAS fauouring Lerning, was in high esteeme with Honorable personages then ly∣uing; but remayneth aeternized by the me∣morable monumentes of men of vertuous qualities now dead: So as this honor after so many hundreds of yeeres, being proper then vnto him selfe; remayneth now common vnto all those whose mindes are enclined vnto Learning; or vnto the patronage of her professors. Which honour, least you should loose (deseruing so well from mee and my impouerished Father) I prostrate this my Infant vnto your Patronage. It is the onely recompence of poore Schollers to follow their friendes with honest Commendations: the which your iust desert claymes from mee; and which my duetie promiseth in humilitie to put in practize for you, that after your death, the tytle of Honored Maecenas, may be ingrauen vpon Brasse or Marble ouer your Tombe. Accept this fauorablie; so shall your respectiue countenaunce both incourage and inable mee to some greater performaunce.
