IT is reported by Taci∣tus, that Licinius grew so stupid, that if he had not been put in minde by others, he had forgot himself to be a Prince. If I should forget the HENSHAVVES, I should for∣get my self to be a man: For an un∣thankfull man is no man, but an enemie to God and man: so the Per∣sians were wont to call him. Where bounty hath an hand to give, thank∣fulnesse should have an hand to write received. I have formerly record∣ed with mine own hand your names in the catalogue of my benefactours:

And that hand should deserve to be cut off, if it should now expunge them. The old copie may decay: I thought good therefore now to re∣new it. Gerards Meditations had never seen English light for me, if yours and others bountie had not set my head on work to finde out some occasion to give publick testi∣monie of my thankfulnesse: If Ge∣rard had not been, I might still have been to seek for an occasion. As often therefore as Gerard and I live together, at every impression you may challenge at my hands a new expression of my service. This debt I shall be alwayes readie to pay, but not as men pay money: for that being once paid can be required no more: But this I shall be alwayes paying, and still remain your debter.
