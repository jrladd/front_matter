SIR,
AT the Return of a long absent Prince, when many thou∣sands flow together as to a common stream of joy; some eminent Persons only fall under a

particular remark, and are digni∣fied with the special observation of the Princes eye. While the inferior sort, that make up the crowd, think it sufficient for them, that they carry on the common joy, and be observed in grosse, with a gene∣rall approbation and acceptance of their well-meaning. It fares so with Books Presented to great Persons, the most eminent are taken notice of: the triviall sort (such as this) peradventure scarce seen or heard of by those Patrons, whose names they carry in their Epistles Dedica∣tory. And because I delight to dwell on so beloved a similitude, presented to my thoughts by the last years most happy occurrences: I may further observe, that as a prease of people is rather troublesome, than advanta∣geous to a triumph; so the excessive multitude of Books hath been

thought rather a means to hinder than advance learning: yet both are tolerated because commonly pre∣sumed to flow, the one from a loyall affection to the Prince, and the other from a well-wishing to learning. And so I have this to excuse me for troubling the world, already pestered with Books, that I do my good will; and that in such a subject as hath not been much studied by the learned: and may receive some advancement from a mean pen that hath been seriously imployed in it. To present to your most sacred Majesty a thing of so mean worth, is an act (I confesse) of great presumption: yet in regard, that books which but pretend use∣fulnesse no the subjects, have ordi∣narily addressed themselves to the patronage of Princes; I want not precedents for such a boldness, and

being conscious to my self of no worse aime in the publishing of this work, than the good of my Country: I have this presumption besides my other, that I shall not incur your Majesty's displeasure.
