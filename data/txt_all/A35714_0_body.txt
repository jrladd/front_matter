TO You (Gods Vicege∣rents on Earth, over all persons, whether Ec∣clesiastical or Tempo∣ral, next under God within Your own respective Domini∣ons Supreme Governour;) I con∣cieve fittest to Dedicate, and Direct the ensuing Papers; To You (Most Illustrious,) they address themselves, as to persons most concern'd in the
 Subject they treat about; whereby is endeavoured the Vindication of Gods Honour,Mr. Edward Tyldsly a Ro∣manist, was railing against the Jesuites to a friend (then) of theirs; say∣ing, they were the Firebrands of the Christi∣an World; to whom his friend replyed thus. — I must confess (Mr. Tildesly) I am very much for the Jesuites, for I am sure, if it were not for them, the Church of Rome would soon be lost, for they are the chiefest supporters of it wherein as his Vice∣gerents You are highly concern'd; also Your own Supreme Powers and Authorities, which in former Ages, (and yet still in the Doctrinal part,) have been often Invaded by the Bishop of Rome, and their Abettors, amongst whom the Jesuites have been still in the front, as the principal cham∣pions against You; and for those Bishops from whom all Anti-Monar∣chical Principles have proceeded un∣der the veil and cover of other Religi∣ons, — as Quakers, Anabaptists, Inde∣pendents, &c. which several Sects have been abetted by several of the Ro∣man Clergy, (thereunto Authorized and commanded by the Bishops of Rome,) to prevent a Reformation a∣mongst themselves (always a terrour
 to them), and the better to divide the Reformed Churches over the World, according to that Maxim, Divide & Impera, — whereby they have not a little impeded the Christi∣an Profession, in the Inlargement of the Kingdom of Christ, and thereby given occasion to the enemies of God (the Turks, &c.) to Blaspheme, and enlarge their Dominions and Terri∣tories; hereby the Isle of Rhodes has been lost, and Candia is in danger, to the eternal reproach of the Christian Profession; for while Christians are disjoined, the common Enemy takes the advantage, which by a happy Union, he would loose; and that this may be accomplished, is both the Prayer and Endeavour of the Author of the ensuing Papers.
