YOu that haue made, in our great Princes Name
(At his high birth) his holy Christian vowes;
May witnesse now (to his eternall Fame)
How he performes them thus far: & stil growes
Aboue his birth in vertue; past his yeares,
In strength of Bountie, and great Fortitude.
Amongst this traine, then, of our choicest Peeres,
That follow him in chace of vices rude,
Summon'd by his great Herald Homers voice;
March you; and euer let your Familie
(In your vowes made for such a Prince) reioyce.
Your seruice to his State shall neuer die.
And, for my true obseruance, let this show,
No meanes escapes when I may honour you.
