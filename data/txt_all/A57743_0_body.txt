SIR,
THis Sermon I present your Majesty with, was not intended by me for the Press, but for the Pulpit, where many Imperfections of it might have past with the time of its delivery
Sed eundum quà via patet.
Trees that grow amongst Rocks, must be shrubs, because they thrust out their branches onely as the Rocks will give them leave.
Ʋt monstrent se enecari.
I have been now above 30 years upon your pub∣lick
service, standing by custome upon your Cata∣logue of preferments, and I hope I shall not stay till all be preferred, as the Countrey man did waiting to see the River run away that he might go over.

Rusticus ex pectat dum defluat amnis at ille,
Labitur atque labetur in omne volubilis aevum.
