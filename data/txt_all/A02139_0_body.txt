MOST Honou∣red Lady; It is not the least of your Ver∣tues, that you are not proud of your Vertues; which, if it
had beene in the Angells that fell, they had perhaps not fal∣len. And because you delight so much in Humblenesse; It makes mee bold to Present un∣to you, these Psalmes of Davids Humiliation. How happie were I, if I could make a Des∣cant, answerable to Davids plaine song: but what is wan∣ting in mine, your owne Me∣ditations will happily supply; which cannot but be excellent, being followed by the practice of so Vertuous a life; of which I wish I could as well make a Monument to remaine to all Posteritie, for their Example; as it will certainly remaine to your owne Posteritie, for their
glory. But least I should adde the offence of tediousnesse to boldnesse: I humbly crave par∣don for having said so much; but more, for having sayd no more; and make it my aspiring suite to bee accounted as I truly am,
