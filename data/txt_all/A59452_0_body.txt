My Lord,
I Having had the Honour to have liv'd so many years in Your Lordships favour, and to have been always exceedingly oblig'd by Your Lordship, ought to be glad of any opporttunity of Publishing my Gratitude. And the offering this Comedy to Your Lordship may not per∣haps be thought an improper occasion of doing it; for the first Act of it was written at Copt-Hall; and Your Lordships Approbation of it (whose Wit and Iudgment have ever been unquestion'd) encourag'd and inspir'd me to go on: When I had finished it, which was in a Months time, Your Lordship, upon the perusal of the whole, was pleas'd to say that you thought it a true, and diverting Comedy.
This, I must confess, made me hope for success upon the Stage, which it met with, but so great, as was above my expectation (in this Age which has run mad after Farces) no Comedy, for these many years, having fill'd the Theatre so long together: And I had the great Honour to find so many Friends, that the House was never so full since it was built, as upon the third day of this Play; and vast numbers went away, that could not be admitted.
This extraordinary success the more emboldens me to lay the Play at Your Lordships Feet; in whose service, I should be glad to employ my whole Life.
I shall not, according to the Custom of Dedications, make a long Panegyrick to Your Lordship, 'tis superflu∣ous

and impertinent, to praise him whom all men speak well of, and of whom I never heard any man speak ill: Your Lordship is the Favourite of Mankind; and You deserve to be so, for You are ever obliging, and seek∣ing out occasions of doing good, and exerting Your Cha∣rity and Generosity, in which You never lose a day.
I must acknowledge my self infinitely oblig'd to Your Lordship every way; but particularly, that I have the freedom of being receiv'd as one of Your Family at Copt∣hall; where not only the excellence of the Air, and re∣gulariy of Living contribute to my Health, but I have the Honour of enjoying the conversation which in all the World I would chuse.
It is to me, and it must needs be to all who wish Your Lord∣ship well, an extraordinary satisfaction to observe that You have laid so certain a foundation of solid happiness, for all the remaining part of Your Life; in retiring from all the unsatisfying pleasures, and noisie troubles of the Town, to so sweet a place, with so admirable a Lady, who in Beauty is exceeded by none, and has all those qualities of mind besides, which serve to make an excellent Lady, an extraordinary Governess of a Family, and an incompa∣rable Wife; whose Fruitfulness is like to bless Your Lord∣ship with a Beauteous, Noble and Numerous Issue. And may Your Lordship and She long enjoy one another, and all the Blessings You Your selves can imagine or desire. I am,
