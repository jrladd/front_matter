VVOrshipfull Sir, being excited, as well by the bond of kindred, as al∣so by your loue and courtesie towards me, to shew you some thankfulnesse, withall to te∣stifie a reciprocall and mutuall loue towards you againe, not forgetting that duty, which both as a kinsman and friend I owe unto you, I adventured (albeit my best strength bee but weaknes) upon a bold assay, namely, to tran∣slate this worke, and present it unto you, as a small mite of that tribute, which even nature bindeth me to render. But seeing my first worke unluckely suppressed it selfe, I have added unto my former boldnesse, a more au∣dacious part, namely, not onely to translate it againe, but also to illustrate it according to my small ability, by the plaine and facile way of a Dialogue. May it croude it selfe into your presence and gaine the least aspect of a favou∣rable countenance, I shall thinke my time wa
spent, and not onely so, but imploy my selfe a∣bout weightier matters. What said (weighti∣er? this Science & Author may stand before Princes, if not spoiled by my own unskilfulnes. However it shroudeth it selfe under your pa∣tronage, vntill the stormes of reproch and ig∣nominie be overpassed, soliciting in the meane time a pardon for mee, in that I have presu∣med to offer such a trifle to such a kinsman. So hoping that the worke, though small, may be accepted, and benevolentlie intertained, I sub∣mit both it and my selfe unto your favourable cogitations in all dutifulnesse; and rest.
