IF it be compliance with Custom that induces me to a Dedication of the ensuing Discourse, 'tis obedience to Reason that moves me to in∣scribe them to your Honourable Name. They are the ingenious Productions of the most accomplish'd Gentlemen of our Neigh∣bour-Nation, and so could not be more fitly pre∣sented then to One of our Own, who to the ad∣vantages of a most Illustrious Descent, hath con∣joyn'd whatever is particularly excellent in Many. That celebrated Aphorism of Plato, which pro∣nounceth Felicity to that State wherein either the Philosophers are of chief dignity, or those of chief dignity are Philosophers, holds no less true in the Commonwealth of Learning then in Political Go∣vernments. Arts and Sciences, when cultiva∣ted by Persons of quality, not only derive lustre from the rank of their Professors, but acquire en∣largement of Territory by their Conduct: He∣roick souls disdaining the enslaving formalities practis'd hitherto by the Sovereigns of the Schools, and by the restauration of Freedom, laying open the way to Conquest. I shall not undertake to de∣termine whether the restitution of Philosophical Liberty began first by the French, or by some great Personages of our own, particularly the renowned

Lord Bacon (from whom 'tis said, not improbably, their Des-Cartes took the grounds of his new Theory) but 'tis certain that his way of Experi∣ment, as now prosecuted by sundry English Gen∣tlemen, affords more probabilities of glorious and profitable Fruits, then the attempts of any other Age or Nation whatsoever. But as it would be a fault in me to insist upon Comparisons, so it will be an injury in such as shall think you, Sir, any way concern'd in these Discourses, either upon the account of their Matter or Translation. 'Tis true, they are extreamly well fitted both for In∣struction and Pleasure, they handle weighty Que∣stions with great facility; and what would be a load in the ordinary modes of Writing thereupon, is here as fully and substantially deliver'd, and yet with exceeding Elegancy and perspicuity; but however commendable in themselves, 'twere criminal to think that you need them; but, on the contrary, I well un∣derstood that the Book needed you; and therefore I must humbly beg your pardon, if I have herein been too forward for its Interest by this Dedication, as also for my own in taking upon me so publickly the quality of,
Sir,
