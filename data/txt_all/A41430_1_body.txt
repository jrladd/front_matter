SIR,
THese Trifles at Your Feet I'd humbly lay,
And gladly these for my vast Debts repay;
I'd beg the great Protection of Your Name,
To have that Altar sanctifie my Flame:
My little All, lent Stock I would resign,
With reason, proud to serve at such a Shrine;
But that they're Trifles all, and all those Trifles
mine.
Admit them moderate: the Seed that's sown,
At first was Yours, much more the Crop's Your own.
You gave the Talent, that improv'd I bring;
By You my Chirping Muse was taught to sing.

You warm'd my Soul with new Promethean Fire,
Your Wings my flagging Thoughts learnt to aspire.
You all the Wheels of my slow Fancy move,
My doubtful Wit at Your true Touch-stone prove.
My Pegasus was in Your Pasture bred,
Not on coarse Birch, but Buds of Ivy fed.
Hail the profess'd Palaemon of our Isle!
Aetonian Helicon for every stile!
Now give me leave these my First-fruits to bring,
Pledge of the Summer, and the Pride of Spring.
So Primroses are upon Altars laid;
And Pepper-corns for Rent by Beggars paid.
