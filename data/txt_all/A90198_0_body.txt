SIR,
SInce it is become a generall custome to affix before Bookes the names of the Authors best friends; I could not without cal∣ling in question so manifest a truth as your desert, and running the ha∣zard of being esteemed ungrate∣full my selfe, but present you with what followes: for which (however it fares) I shall descend no lower in my desires, then that your name may remain as perpetuall a monu∣ment to my merit, as I am confi∣dent it will prove of your goodnesse, which can never die or be out of credit: whereas Bookes are during one Age neatly bound and choicely preserved, and the next, condem∣ned to the basest of imployments.
 Nor had I ever exposed my self to the danger of a present censure, no lesse then a future contempt, but that I gain by writing a diversion from discontent, the highest felicity my fortune ever gave me leave yet to injoy: who, notwithstanding the cold commendation Authors find during their lives, shall venture so far on the constancy of my owne Fortune, (which some are pleased to call desert) and the worlds judge∣ment, as to peep abroad again up∣on my single security, without so much as desiring your protection, though a frequent Petition in such like Epistles, or borrowing com∣mendations from my Acquaintance, more ready to lend me their good word, then I was ever yet able to deserve it, which doth not seldome betray the Reader into the purchase of an ill Book; or at best, gratifies his expectation no more, then a
 base and rotten Inne can a Travel∣ler, because prefaced by a gawdy sign-post. All I beg, is, that in case it comes short of former ap∣plause, you would consider me, not your self, as the party abused. And not weigh your acceptance or my will to serve you at the common Beam, but by the Standard of your love, in which you have so far ex∣ceeded those of my own blood, as I cannot but acknowledge you, and subscribe my self
