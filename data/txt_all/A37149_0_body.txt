MY LORD,
BESIDES the many in∣dispensable reasons I have to present this Exposition of the Mass to Your EX∣CELLENCY, the very subject it self seems to oblige me to it. For the Mass being an Embassy, as the word Missa (from whence it is derived) imports, may be rightly said to claim the Patronage of an Embassador so
 Illustrious for his piety towards this August Mystery; which is indeed a Sacred Embassy from the Catholick Church to God the Father by the Mi∣nistery of her Priests, who in the name of all Mankind negociat affairs of highest importance, as are the ten∣der of subjection and vassalage of the Creature to his Creatour, and Sove∣raign Lord. His grateful thanks for the dayly and reiterated benefits he receives from his divine hands. His submissive supplications of pardon for offences committed against his Di∣vine Majesty: And finally his humble petitions for new favours, and Bles∣sings from his bounteous liberality.
Hence appears the great Office of the Priest at the Altar, being there in quality of an Embassador and So∣licitour general of all Mankind: Pro Christo legatione fungimur, said S. Paul for himself, and for all Priests.
These and the like considerations, have induced Your EXCELLENCY
 to adorn with so much care and cost, that Sacred place where this Divine Mystery is dayly Celebrated: For which reason I wish that this Dedi∣cation may fly like the Prophet Za∣charias wing'd Rowl, Video volu∣men volans, Cap. 5. 2. to publish to the World Your transcendent zeal, and how much You delight like David, to deck up the House of God, with Your own hands.
But here Your EXCELLENCIES known aversion from hearing what may savour of Your own praise, checks the forwardness of my pen, not gi∣ving me leave in speaking of Myste∣ries, to reveal those of Your solid and discret Piety; but, forcing me to an unwilling silence, permits me only to subscribe my self
