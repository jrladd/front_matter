Noble SIR,
TO let you see what absolute So∣veraignty you have over me, and how little power I have to obey, even the strongest inclinations of my own Genius, when your commands have once told me, I must apply my self to complaisance with Yours; I have strugled hard to master my natural aver∣sion to Writing, and for a day or two taken up my long discontinued Pen;

choosing for my Argument, a short Story, such, Whose Truth might supply the bar∣renness of my Invention, and whose pleasantness renders both the harshness of my style, and the morosity of my humour, the less offensive. It concerns a beautiful and good natured Creature, whose Adentures have been thought so memorable, that time it self hath not been able to sink them in that Abyss of ob∣livion, in which, many potent Monarchs have been swallowed up; nor have many great Scholars, and eminent Wits, thought it beneath the dignity of their Pens, to transmit the memory of them to posterity.
I cannot tell you the Womans name; my Authors having been in that point unanimously silent; but you may call her, if you please, the Wandring Greek: for, she hath visited more Countries, than▪ Queen Christina, (who, though now naturalized a Roman, doth yet re∣tain much of the Goth and Vandal) and

is perfect in more Languages. After I had seen her in the Greek, Roman, Ger∣man and French habits, and observed such a natural comeliness, as made her appear lovely and pleasant in each dress, that ingenious Foreigners had clad her in; and been assured by some of them, that even Princes had sometimes made her a Favourite: I had a humour also to put her into our English garb, that you might be acquainted with her, and judge, whe∣ther that be not as becomming and graceful as any of the rest. If I have set her forth in an equipage somewhat too grave and solemn, according to the fa∣shion of my own phansie, which is most delighted with sad colours, and plain useful garments; so that she may now seem the Mistress rather of a Philosopher than of a Courtier▪ it was, because I would not have hr appear altogether a stranger, and ignorant of the mode of the time, wherein the greatest levity and li∣cenciousness, is commonly wrapt up in

the most austere looks, and sober formali∣ty of dress; and Lasciviousness generally usurps the long vil of Modesty. I have not furnished her with Jewels, and made her shine with gaudy Ornaments, bot because I had none of my own, and be∣cause I think them fit only for such, who wanting native Beauty enough to fill the beholders sight, avert him from discern∣ing their defects, by catching his eyes with the lustre of Pearl, Diamonds and Rubies; whereas this our Matron is so largely beholding to the bounty of Na∣ture, that she scorns the mean charity of Art; and you may as soon perswade her to turn Adamite, as to make use of preci∣ous Stones. Yet I'le promise you, her Linnen is fine, clean, and white, though plain and unstarched. And because she is a Mourner, I have accoutred her in a sable Veil: which she puls down, as often as she hath occasion to hide her blushes; and turns up again, when she is pleased to be more free, and discover the charms of her smiles.
Nor can I tell you precisely her Age, though I guess it to be near upon that of the Roman Empire, which is, by some hundreds of years, elder than the Wan∣dring Jew. But, let not that discourage you; for she is yet youthful, sprightly, and gamesome, and hath not a wrinckle in her face; insomuch, that a Gentleman, who surprized me, with her in my com∣pany, would not be perswaded but she was my daughter. Besides, what is im∣mortal (as she seems to be) must, you know, be ever young and flourishing.
As for her Religion, I confess also, I can give you no certain account of it, be∣cause (contrary to the custom of most of her sex) she is very reserved in that par∣ticular. Yet, if I may have the liberty of conjecturing from some Actions of hers, I should take her to be of old Epicurius's Faith, following the simple dictates of mother-Nature, and living by the plain rule of her own Inclinations; as hold∣ing it a contradiction, to be born under

one Law, and to another bound: or else a Sister of the family of Love, which scruples at no freedom with a san∣ctifd Brother, and justifies her famili∣arity with fervency of Zeal, and sug∣gestions of the spirit. Do not you there∣fore conceive her to be a Vestal, or one that resolves to pervert the purpose of Na∣ture, and hath abjured the end of her Creation; albeit you see her in a Vault, in a lamenting posture, and with a small Ta∣per burning by her: For really, she is a Cyprian Nun, consecrated to the God∣dess of Pleasure▪ inflamed with zeal of Priapus: She is furnished with an Al∣tar, with Incense, and with Fire too, and wants only a Priest to come and animate her Sacrifice.
For her Humour, you will find her in all things a perfect Woman, a little subject to changes, seldom out of ex∣treams; wing and smiling in a beath, leaping at once out of a Charnel∣house into a Nuptial-bed; soon quitting

a violent grief for a good Husband late∣ly deceased, for to solace in the embra∣ces of a new Love; this moment, in the bottom of despair, and the next in the height of fruition; now endeavouring to destroy her self, and anon, doing her de∣voir to procreate another, and give Be∣ing to posterity; too wise to refuse a good proffer, or neglect a fair opportunity; highly sweet and obliging upon occasi∣on, even to a stranger, and at first enter∣view, full of frankness and endearments, where she affects; forward to excuse and palliate the errors of her friend, and ad∣mirably witty, in projecting a way to a∣vert suddain danger threatning him. And what would you more from a Woman?
Notwithstanding all these excellent qualities, let me not only desire, but also conjure you, to imprison her in your pri∣vate Cabinet, so that she may be seen by no eyes but your own. Not hat you need be jealous of either her chastity or repu∣tation; for, the one is proof against the

corruptions even of Peter Arentine him∣self, if he were alive and conversant with her; and she hath cunning enough of her own to preserve the other: but, for fear she meet with affronts from the La∣dies, who will never be reconciled to a Woman that is so weak, as to betray the frailties, and lay open the secrets of her own Sex. Besides that, she is a professed Enemy to their own darling, Platonick-Love; and ingeniously confesseth, she knows no flames, but such as arise from the difference of Sex, and are kindled in the blood, and other luxuriant humours of the body: and that her Amours always end to the propagation of somewhat more Material, than the simple Ideas of vertue, of which our Philosophical Ladies so much talk. Which heretical doctrine, if they once hear her preach, 'tis not all the Armies in the world shall protect her from suffring the fate of Orpheus; or shall you, Sir, with all your good language, and other ingratiating Arts, be

able to vindicate hercause, or secure your self from the hateful brand of a Woman-hater. As therefore you value this Ephe∣sian's free conversation, or the favour of Ladies, be sure you keep her to your self; but, if you will needs shew your self to be of the number of those open-breasted men, who think no pleasure compleat, until they have boased of it; yet, at least, be so just to the sacred Laws of friendship, as never to reveal who brought her into England, only for your private recreation; and then leave her adversaries to consult their grand Oracle Lilly, how to find out,
Most honoured Sir,
