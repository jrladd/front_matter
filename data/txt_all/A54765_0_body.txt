Sir,
THere is no man that puts Pen to Paper but has so much kindness for the offspring of his own fan∣cy, as to think it may deserve some Cha∣rity, though it be but a Blew-coat enter∣tainment. If men cavil at the subject, as perhaps some Paedagogues may for affron∣ting their Classic Author) tis no more then if they should see Virgil himself now playing at the serious game of Irish, and by and by, turning the Tables, and tri∣fling away a little time at the idle sport of Draughts. I know it is a rudeness to inter∣rupt the serious studies of any person, but

for the same person to take his own pastime is no ill manners to himself; though as to what relates to my defence, perhaps I may aver that he who reads the following pages may find so much of the  in∣termix'd, as wilperadventure turn' emmore into a serious Satyr▪ then a jocular story. Let others think what they please; if these extravagant howers of mine shall have the happiness to gain your approhation, tis' what I expect. The chief reason why I make this address to your self, being, because I am fully perswaded, that he who has been so true a judge of Loyalty, can be no less a judge of Ingenuity.
