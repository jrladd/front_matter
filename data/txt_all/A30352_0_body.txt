SIR,
THE first step that was made in the Reformation of this
Church, was the restoring to your Royal An∣cestors the Rights of the Crown, and
an entire Dominion over all their Subjects; of which they had been disseised by
the craft and violence of an unjust Pre∣tender: to whom the Clergy, though your
Maje∣sties Progenitors had enriched them, by a bounty no less profuse than
ill-managed, did not only adhere, but drew with them the Laity, over whose
Consci∣ences they had gained so absolute an Authority, that our Kings were to
expect no Obedience from their people, but what the Popes were pleased to
allow.
It is true, the Nobler part of the Nation did fre∣quently in
Parliament, assert the Regal Prerogatives against those Papal invasions; yet
these were but faint endeavours, for an ill-executed Law is but an un∣equal
match to a Principle strongly infused into the Consciences of the people.
But how different was this from the teaching of Christ and his
Apostles? They forbad men to use all those Arts by which the Papacy grew up and
yet sub∣sists:  They exhorted them to obey Magistrates, when they
knew it would cost them their Lives: They were for setting up a Kingdom, not of
this World, nor to be attained but by a holy and peaceable Re∣ligion. If this
might every-where take place, Prin∣ces would find Government both easie and
secure: It would raise in their Subjects the truest courage, and unite them
with the firmest charity: It would draw from them Obedience to the Laws, and
Reverence to the persons of their Kings. If the Standards of Ju∣stice and
Charity, which the Gospel gives, of doing as we would be done by, and loving
our Neighbours as our selves, were made the measures of mens acti∣ons, how
steadily would Societies be governed, and how exactly would Princes be
obeyed!
The design of the Reformation, was to restore
Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those Corruptions,
with which it was over-run in the later and darker Ages.
GREAT SIR, This work was carryed on by a slow and unsteady
Progress under King Henry the VIII; it advanced in a fuller and freer
course un∣der the short but blessed Reign of King Edward; was Sealed
with the blood of many Martyrs under Queen Mary; was brought to a full
settlement in the happy and glorious days of Queen Elizabeth; was
defended by the learned Pen of King Iames; but the established frame
of it, under which it had so long flourished, was overthrown with your
Majesties bles∣sed Father, who fell with it, and honoured it by his unexempled
Suffering for it; and was again restored to its former beauty and order, by
your Majesties happy Return.
What remains to compleat and perpetuate this Blessing,
the composing of our differences at home, the establishing a closer
correspondence with the Re∣formed Churches abroad, the securing us from the
restless and wicked practices of that Party, who ho∣ped so lately to have been
at the end of their designs; and that which can only entitle us to a Blessing
from God, the Reforming of our manners and lives, as our Ancestors did our
Doctrine and Worship; All this is reserved for your Majesty, that it may
appear, that your Royal Title of Defender of the Faith is no empty sound, but
the real strength and Glory of your Crown.
For attaining these ends, it will be of great use to trace the
steps of our first Reformers; for if the land∣marks they set be observed, we
can hardly go out of the way. This was my chief design in the following sheets,
which I now most humbly offer to your Ma∣jesty, hoping that as you were
graciously pleased to command that I should have free access to all
Re∣cords for composing them, so you will not deny your Royal Patronage
to the History of that Work, which God grant your Majesty may live to raise to
its per∣fection, and to compleat in your Reign the Glory of all your Titles.
This is a part of the most earnest as well as the daily Prayers of,
May it please Your Sacred Majesty,
