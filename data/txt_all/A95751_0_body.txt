MADAM,
FILIALL duty being the more bind∣ing in me, that I doe owe it to the best of Mothers; if in the discharge thereof I observe not the usuall manner of other sonnes, I am the lesse to blame, that their obligati∣on is not so great as mine: Therefore in that doe

presume to imprint your Ladiships name in the Frontispiece of this Book, and proffer unto you a Dedication of that, which is beyond the capacity of other Ladies; my boldnesse therein is the more excusable, that in your person the most vertuous Woman in the world is intreated to Patronize that, which by the learnedest men may happily be per∣used.
I am confident (Madam) that your gracious ac∣ceptance of this Present is the more easily obtain∣able, in that it is a grand-child of your own, whom I thus make tender of, to be sheltered under the fa∣vor of your protection; and that unto your Ladiship it will not be the more unwelcome, for proceeding from the braines of him, whose body is not more yours by generation, then by a most equitable purchase are the faculties of his mind; the dominion which o∣ver my better halfe you, by your goodnesse, have ac∣quired, being, in regard of my obedience, no lesse voluntary, then that of the other is for procreation naturall.
Thus (Madam) unto you doe I totally belong, but so, as that those exteriour parts of mine, which by birth are from your Ladiship derived, cannot be more fortunate in this their subjection (notwith∣standing the egregious advantages of bloud, and

consanguinity thereby to them accruing) then my selfe am happy (as from my heart I doe acknow∣ledge it) in the just right, your Ladiship hath to the eternall possession of the never-dying powers of my soule. For, though (Soveraignty excepted) there be none in this Island more honourably de∣scended then is your Ladiship, nor whose progeni∣tors, these many ages past, have been (on either side) of a more Noble extraction: Yet, laying apart Nobility, beauty, wealth, parentage, and friends, which (together with many other gifts of fortune) have hi∣therto served to adorn your Ladiship beyond others of your sex, who for all these have been deser∣vedly renowned; and (in some measure) not e∣steeming that properly to be yours, the receiving whereof did not altogether depend upon your owne election: it is the treasure of those excel∣lent graces, wherewith inwardly you are enrich∣ed, that, in praising of your Ladiship is most to be pitch'd upon, and for the which you are most highly to be commended; seeing by the means of them, you, from your tenderest yeeres up∣wards, untill this time, in the state of both Ʋirgini∣ty and Matrimony, have so constantly, and indefati∣gably proceeded in the course of vertue, with such a∣lacrity fixed your gallant thoughts on the sweetnesse

thereof, and thereunto so firmly and cheereful∣ly devoted all your words and actions, as if righteous∣nesse in your Ladiship had been an inbred quality, and that in your Will there had beene no aptitude of declining from the way of reason.
This much is sufficiently well known to those, that have at any time enjoyed the honour of your Ladiships conversation, by whose most unpartiall reports, the Splendour of your reputation is both in this, and foraine Nations accounted precious, in the minds even of those, that have never seen you. But in so much more especially, doe the most judicious of either sex admire the rare and sublime endowments, wherewith your La∣diship is qualified, that (as a patterne of perfection, worthy to be universally followed) other La∣dies (of what dignity soever) are truly by them esteemed of the choiser merit, the nearer they draw to the Paragon proposed, and resemble your Ladiship; for that, by vertue of your beloved society, your neighbouring Countesses, and other greater Dames of your kindred and acquain∣tance, become the more illustrious in your imi∣tation; amidst whom, as Cynthia amongst the obscurer Planets, your Ladiship shines, and darteth the Angelick rayes of your matchlesse example

on the spirits of those, who by their good Genius have been brought into your favourable presence to be enlightned by them.
Now (Madam) lest, by insisting any lon∣ger upon this straine, I should seeme to offend that modesty, and humility, which (without derogating from your heroick vertues) are seat∣ed in a considerable place of your soule, I will here, in all submission, most humbly take my leave of your Ladiship, and beseech Almighty God, that it may please his Divine Majesty so to blesse your Ladiship with continuance of dayes, that the sonnes of those whom I have not as yet begot, may attaine to the happinesse of presenting unto your Ladiship a brain-babe of more sufficiencie and consequence; and that your Ladiship may live with as much health, and prosperity, to accept there∣of, and cherish it then, as (I hope) you doe now, at your vouchsafing to receive this, which (though disproportionable, both to your Ladi∣ships high deserts, and to that fervencie of wil∣lingnesse in me, sometime to make offer of what is of better worth, and more sutable to the grandour of your acceptance) in all sincerity of heart (confiding in that candour and ingenuity, wherby your Ladiship is accustomed to value gifts,

according to the intention of the giver) and in all duty, and lowlinesse of mind, together with my selfe in whole, and all my best endeavours, I tender unto your Ladiship, as becometh, (Madam)
