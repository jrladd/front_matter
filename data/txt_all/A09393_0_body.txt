MY Honourable Lord, I neuer affected flattery, if I had I should now haue beene much disap∣pointed; for your no∣ble worth exceeds what I can say. To particularize your honourable Titles, or here to blazon your excellencies were needlesse, and shall rather be printed in my faithfull heart, then published by my ruder pen; especially vpon the dedication of so slight a subiect. Sir, I haue long waited

for opportunity, & this great while whipt oc∣casion on, whereby I might tender some open testimonie of my loue, before I dye, which may remaine as a perpetual memoriall of my euer∣deuoted seruice. To that end (my Lord) I haue runne backe into my younger yeares, to summon the delights of my able youth, toge∣ther with the fruits of my more experienced age, (comprised within a few leaues) to at∣tend your Lordships leasure, and humbly to craue your Honours patronage. To arrogate to my selfe by an immoderate commendation of the Worke, were poore: to derogate too much from it through modesty, were as silly: Therefore (not to be excessiue in the one, nor too liberall in the other) I would (with your honourable fauour) doe you thus much to vn∣derstand: As for the subiect it is not waighty (being but a Treatise of sport) and to attend and to giue place to your Lordships honoura∣ble affaires, and more serious imployments; but as for the handling of the Subiect (I dare, and will boldly say and auerre) it is good: Nay, I will submit my selfe to partiall censu∣rers

vpon due triall, and bazard my reputa∣tion vpon true iudgement. My Lord, I frame not my wauering surmizes vpon probabilities of sic dicunt; but I ground my constant opi∣nion vpon certainty of probatum est: Nor can I quote any Author but my selfe; and out of my owne industrious experiments I (first) extracted my owne conclusions: I reape no mans haruest, but plough with my owne Hei∣fer. In fine, I here dedicate to your Lordship the delights of my Childe-hood, the pleasures of my youth, the experiments of my age, my faithfull (though painefull) labours, my fruit∣full (though slight) indeauours, myselfe, my continuall seruice and obseruance to your truely-noble Selfe, humbly requesting your Honour not to be ashamed to Patronize that which your seruant is not afraid to present: And that shall crowne my poore indeauours, and giue my labours an eternall sufficit; and make me euer rest
