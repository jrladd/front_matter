Right Worshipful, &c.
THe singular Favours, Which you have shewed to me, do merie a gratefull acknowledgement from me. In testimony therefore of my obligations, I dedicate unto you this Treatise. May it prove, what I design it, a lasting monument of your generosity, and my gratitude. Through Gods blessing on the conjoyn'd erdeavours, pious care, and prndent conduct of Magistrate and Mini∣stir,
 your Corporation now is, as Jerusa∣lem of old was, as a City that is at unity in it self. A rare blessing that, at all times, but especially in dividing times. Few Cor∣porations in England cawboast the like. God continue that happiness to you, and to yours after you from generation. Thereto if these Papers of mine be in any measure contributory, as I do most sincercly wish it, so I shall most heartily rejoyce at it; as being one who takes a great pleasure in the Prosperity of your Corporation, and no less in being serviceable in any manner, or mea∣sure to it. So begging your kind acceptance of my good meaning in this Dedication, and wishing a perpetuation and inorease of Ʋni∣ty, and Amity, and all the blessed Conse∣quents thereof among you, I present these Papers to your favour, and remain
