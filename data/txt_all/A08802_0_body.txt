MOst reuerend, and my honorable good Lord, in these fruitful times wherin so many pain∣full in Gods husban∣drie, doe make daily Presents to the Church, of their profitable Labours: I thought my selfe behinde-hand too much, to sit out so long, without giuing some testimony of my equall desire, to aduance so good a Worke. I am too cōscious of my insufficiencies, to presse

in with the first, and I feare to doe no∣thing. These days afford plenty of rea∣ders, if plenty of writers ouer-charge▪ variety may delight. These my medi∣tations haue hope of welcome from the Argument, which is our own loiall Al∣legeance to his Maiestie, who are the Preachers of Loyalty to our People: and from your Honorable protection and countenance, to whom the Church of God here owes many acknowledge∣ments of honorable seruice by you per∣formed to her, & to whom I best know how much my selfe in particulars doe stand obliged. I pray God for the en∣crease of his best blessings on you and yours, and rest wishing your Lordsh:
