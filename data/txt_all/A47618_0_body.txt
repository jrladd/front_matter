READER,
THe Church even
in her Infancy,
the Christian
Church was un∣der
the Crosse, Stephanus
lapidatus, Jacobus truci∣datus,
saith Austin, Ste∣phen
was stoned, and James

beheaded. The Church hath
had two kinde of persecuti∣ons,
When any common ca∣lamity befell the people or State, as famine, dearth, pesti∣lence, they straight∣way impu∣ted it to the Christians, saying, that they and their wicked religion were the cause there∣of. Christi∣anos ad Leo∣nem. Tertul. Away with them to the Lion, to the stake. one from Rome eth∣nicall,
the other from Rome
Papall. After the Apostles
what a continuall storme
arose against Christians,
which lasted three hundred
years under the ten mon∣sters
of men those bloudie
Emperours, Nero, Do∣mitian,
Trajane, Anto∣ninus,
Severus, Maxi∣minus,
Decius, Valeria∣nus,
Aurelianus, Dioclesi∣anus,
whose rage was such
as a man could not set his
foot in Rome, but tread
on the graves of Martyrs▪

Nero was the AuthourConsule Commenta∣rios vestros, illic reperietis primum Ne∣ronem in hanc sectamtum maxime Romae orien∣tem Caesari∣ano gladio ferocisse: Sed tali de∣dicatore damnationis nostrae glo∣riamur. Qui enim scit illum, intelli∣gere potest non nisi grande aliquod bonum à Nero∣ne damnatum. Tertul. Apol. cap. 5. of
the first grand persecution,
wherein Saint Peter (as it
is said) and Saint Paul
were martyred at Rome,
with others innumerable,
and Jacobus Iustus at Je∣rusalem,
whence Tertul∣lian
inferred, That the
Gospel must needs be a pre∣cious
thing, because
Nero hated it.
Dioclesian raised the
tenth and extreamest per∣secutionVide Euseb. lib. 8., wherein Church∣es
were overthrown, Bi∣bles

burnt, whole Cities ra∣zed,
women hanged upon
trees naked with their heads
downwards. The Chri∣stians
yet in that time under
the Heathen Emperours had
many lucida intervalla,
many breathing spaces un∣der
Princes not altogether
so bloudy. But the Popes
have persecuted the Prote∣stants
for six hundred years
together, and that without
any intermission.
I might exemplifie in ma∣ny
of their cruell practices▪
1. In their wars against
the Waldenses and Albi∣genses.

2. In the Massacre of
France, in which the rivers
were died with bloud.
3. In our tempora Ma∣riana
Queen Maries daies;
Who hath not heard of blou∣dy
Bonner and Gardiner?
4. In the rebellious in∣surrection
in Ireland, and
the cruell butchery of above
200 thousand Protestants
there. Platina writes of
seventeen thousand martyr∣ed
by Dioclesian; but Me∣terane
writes of 50 thou∣sand
slaughtered by the Pope
only in the Low-coun∣tries,
aud that in the time
of Charles the 5th▪ Na∣talis

Comes of sixty thou∣sand
in France only in one
year. Iulius the second in
seven years shed the bloud
of above two hundred tho∣sand
Christians.
Antichrist is drunk
with the bloud of the
Saints, Revel. 17. 6. and
18. 24. In her, that is,
Babylon, now Rome, was
found the bloud of Pro∣phets,
that is, of all those
that preacht the Word of
God, and of Saints, and
of all that were slain upon
the earth; They were put
to death by the authority of
the Pope. Some hold that

the bitterest persecutions of
the Church of God are yet to
come, but two considera∣tions
may much support
the spirits of Gods peo∣ple.
1. The shortnesse of the
Persecutours lives, and their
miserable ends for the most
part.
2. The good that comes
to the Church of God by
affiction and persecution.
I will not speak of the short
lives of many Popes, and
the short reign of Queen
MaryOf all since the conquest her reign was the shortest, only excepting that of Ri∣chard the ty∣rant, but much more bloudy then was his. Speeds Chro. in Q. Marie., nor of the misera∣ble
end of many persecuting
Emperours, but shall out of

Foxes Martyrology, instance
in the exemplary punish∣ments
of some of the perse∣cutours
of our Martyrs.
George Eagles (alias,Foxes Acts and Monum. 3d vol. pag. 1023.
Trudge over the world)
hid himself in a Corn-field,
and by the benefit of the
height of the Corn, and
breadth of the field he had
escaped, had not Ralph
Lurdane one of his perse∣cutours
with more malici∣ous
craft, climbed a high
tree to view over the place,
and so descried him.
This persecutour a lewd
fellow of life for theft and
whoredome, within a few

years after he had appre∣hended
the foresaid George
Eagles for gain of money,
he himself was attached of
felony for stealing a horse,
condemned and hanged in the
same place and Town of
Chelmesford, where
George Eagles before
suffered martyrdome. A
Bishop coming to Stephen
Gardiner (Bishop of Win∣chester)
on his death-bed,
put him in remembrance of
Peters denying his Ma∣ster;Foxes 3d vol. p. 95.
he answering again:
said, That he had denied
with Peter, but never re∣pented
with Peter, and

so both stinkingly and
unrepentantly died.See also in Fox a nota∣ble story of the death of Dr Whitting∣ton a perse∣cutour. Do∣ctour
Storie was a great e∣nemy
to the Protestants in
Queen Maries daies, but
in Queen Elizabeths reign
he being beyond sea was by a
handsome wile brought over
into England,Fox ubi supra and suffer∣ed
as a Traitour, on whom
the boyes sung these verses,
D. Story for You I am sor∣rie,
The hangman must have
Your gown:
Your father the Pope,
could not save You
from the rope;
For all his triple crown.

Secondly, The people of
God like Commomile, the
more they were trod on the
more they did spread, and
(like Rabbets in frosty wea∣ther)
did thrive under per∣secution.
OneMr Manton on Rev. 2. 3. saith,
Martyrologie and cate∣chizing
were the great
engines by which the re∣formers
battered down
Poperie. Jerome com∣pares
the state of the Chrch
under Constantine and
some Christian Emperours
with that under Dioclesian
and some persecuting Empe∣rours:
under the former the
Church increased much Po∣tentia

& divitiis, in power
and wealth, but diminished
virtutibus, in vertue▪
How strangely was that pro∣mise
accomplished in Eng∣land
and France,Mat. 25. Who∣soever
will save his life
shall lose it; and whoso∣ever
will lose his life for
my sake, shall finde it.
William Wolsey Mar∣tyr
being in prison sent by a∣nother
a noble to Richard
Denton with this com∣mendation,
That he mar∣velled
he tarried so long
behinde him, seeing he
was the first that deliver∣ed
him the book of Scri∣pture

into his hand, and
told him that it was the
truth, desiring him to
make haste after as fast as
he could.Foxes Acts and Monum. 3d vol. p. 433 This money
and message being delivered
to Denton almost a year
after Wolsey was burned,
his answer was this. I con∣fesse
it is true, but alas I
cannot burn. But he that
would not burn in the cause
of Christ, was afterward
burned against his will; for
his house was set on fire, and
while he went in to save his
goods he lost his life. On
the contrary, some that were
in prison, and purposed to

suffer for the truth, were
y the death of Queen Ma∣ry
happily preserved, that
being a true observation
whichDr Hall. one hath, As good
husbands do not put al their
corn to the oven, but save
some for seed, so doth God
ever in the worst of persecu∣tions.
When Henry the fourth
of France had conquered
his enemies, he turned Pa∣pist,
and gave this reason of
it, That he might settle
himself in peace and safe∣ty.
Ravilliak who slew
him, confessed that the rea∣son
why he stabbed him, was,

because he was of two religi∣ons.
It is well noted by a
Reverend DivineDr Gouge on Exod. 13. 13., That
the book of martyrs was
in high esteem all the
days of Queen Elizabeth:
All Churches by authority
were injoyned to have it, so
as all that would might read
it. There was scarce a fa∣mily
of note that had it not,
it was usuall to spend the
long winter evenings in rea∣ding
it. By the constancy
of Martyrs therein set out,
people were much encoura∣ged
to stand to that faith
which was sealed by their
bloud. Whether the killing

of the two Witnesses be near
at hand or no, I determine
not, but sure there is likeli∣hood
enough of troubles and
persecutions to Gods people,
therefore I conceive these
severall Tracts, Of the
Martyrs in generall, and
Concerning our Eng∣lish
Martyrs, Of Martin
Luther a couragious Re∣former,
Of the Cove∣nant
and Promises, Of
living and dying by faith
may be very suitable to our
times.
But some may urge,
that for the first subject
concerning the Martyrs,

there was a book long
since published, stiled,
The Mirrour of Mar∣tyrs,
usefull that way. I
deny not but that book
might be profitable to di∣vers
Christians, who ei∣ther
wanted money to pur∣chase
or leasure to reade
the large book of Mar∣tyrs:
But my drift in this
worke is to excerp onely
(among the many dicta fa∣cta
of the Martyrs) those
speeches and acts of theirs,
which were specially obser∣vable.
Master Coton
(who composed the book be∣fore
mentioned) hath con∣fusedly

jumbled divers things
together: some of which are
ordinary, though others may
be remarkable, and I believe
he mistakes in that which he
hath of Voes, it being not
consonant to the originall
whence he took it. He hath al∣so
the same thing twice of
Iohn & Christopher Waid.
I hope therefore (though I
have many things the same
with Cotton, that this work
will be of speciall use to those,
who would not be ignorant of
the living speeches of dying
Christians. The Saints are best
toward their end; so it was
with Jacob and Moses,

as appears in his excellent
song made a little before
his death,Deut. 32. so David,
Solomon, what an ex∣cellent
Sermon and praier
did our Saviour make a
little before his death.John 14. 15. 16. and 17. chap. I
have likewise long since
put forth a Treatise of
the Covenant and Pro∣mises,
yet having collected
divers new Observations
of that excellent subject,
(for some of which I was be∣holding
to two of our worthy
LecturersMr Mar∣shall and Mr Strong. at Westminster)
I thought good to adde
this Tract to the rest, it
being of speciall use al∣waies

for Christians, espe∣cially
in evil times. Thus
hoping God will blesse these
my endeavours for the good
of his people, I rest
