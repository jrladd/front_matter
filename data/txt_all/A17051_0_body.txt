RIght Worshipfull, It must not seeme strange vn∣to you that a new occasion hath made also a new change of stile; since occasion daily sheweth so many changes in the world. A∣mongst all which alterations, I must beg of you still to continue your countenance vnto these few plaine homely Sermons: In token that no change (I hope so long as I liue) shall keepe me from mani∣festing vnto the world (as all occasions shall serue) how much in dutie I am bound to your true vnfei∣ned loue and vndeserued fauours to me the vn∣worthiest of all. For which I can but wish you to

be euer attended with those two faithfull compani∣ons of the Saints: peace of conscience and ioy in the holie Ghost: and at the last to haue a speedie hearing when your Spirits shall faile, to tran∣sport them into Abrahams bosome; there to enioy eternall and vnspeakeable rest, for euer and euer.
