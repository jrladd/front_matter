THese Sermons, deli∣uered in the hearing of our chiefest Mariners the Brethren of the Trinity house, at their anniuersary meeting, which they reli∣giously obserue, are especially addres∣sed to the vse of the Sea-men. I haue conceiued hope, that they whom they most concern, may make some good vse of these Meditations, euen then, when they are far off from those many helps which our Church at home affoordeth,

both for Knowledge and Deuotion. I haue also made choice to recommend them by especiall direction, to you, the honorable Gouernor, and worthy Ad∣uenturers of that Societie, which sends forth the Sea-man furthest frō home, to the remotest partes of the knowne world, beseeching you to admit of this mine aduenture amongest yours, with which you shall euer haue my earnest praiers to God, for the prosperous suc∣cesse of your commerce & nauigation. For this I rest Gods petitioner for you all, humbly acknowledging my thank∣full duety to you, by whose vnexpected and vndeserued hounty, my Labours and Studies haue been comforted and encouraged.
