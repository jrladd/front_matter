IT may seeme in me (by a strict construction) more presump∣tion and boldenesse then either art or iudgement thus to publish my rude collections, and prostitute to your censu∣rings the depth of my knowledge, sith I cannot let passe so sleight an error, which to you wil not appeare most grosse, & lie discouered in the playnest nakednesse, because you knowing all thinges which in right shold belong to a wel accomplisht rider are the best able both to correct and condemne mine errors, as hauing in you the onelie sufficiencie both of power and autho∣ritie: but my hope is, that my worst fault is the rudenes of my phrase, not mine ignorance in the arte which I handle; and though this subiect might haue beseemed (some of you that are my Maisters) much better then my selfe, yet since it is the for∣tune of my forward spirrit, to which you haue giuen an especi∣all libertie through your silence, let me be helde excused, and what you shall finde to differ either from your owne rules, or from the square of auncient practise, after you haue argued it with reason and the nature of the beast, of which I treate of, if then you haue cause to condemne me, I wil with al humble∣nes submit to my punnishment which I perswade myselfe shall be moste charitable, because I rather desire your loues then any o∣ther mens admirations.
