I Do not arrogate to my self (Most Reverend in our Lord) in Present∣ing to your Hands this following Discourse, to offer you any thing but what you have before receiv'd from the most Excellent Master, and Teacher, the Holy Spirit, in the
 Scriptures, and Word of God; Given by the Great High Priest, and Apostle of our Profession, that One Shepherd, the Chief Shepherd, and Bishop of our Souls, Christ Jesus; and what you your selves have often, I have greatest Rea∣son to hope, and believe, Dis∣cours'd, with clearest Evidence to the Understandings, and Convi∣ctions upon the Consciences of them, that heard you.
This notwithstanding I have very great Reasons, for ma∣king this Humblest Offerture to you.
1. That by discoursing and arguing a point so acknow∣ledgly Great, so Fundamental and Essential, not only to Chri∣stianity,
 but to Natural Religi∣on, and all Morality: If it shall be acceptable to you, as I can∣not but trust it will, because it is so agreeable to Scripture; I may reconcile my self to your more, not only Favour∣able, but Deep Consideration in so great Points of the sure Word of Prophecy, as I have hereto∣fore presented to you; and have made some Reference unto, in this very Doctrine of Repentance, as most Connatu∣ral to it.
For though I know there is a Difference between such a plain, and uncontestable Truth of Scripture, as Repentance is; and what lies in the darker
 Folds and Plaits of Scripture, in the Hieroglyphick Figures, and Prophetical Numbers of it; and it may seem therefore impossi∣ble, or highly improbable, that I especially should attain the Cer∣tainty of the Words of Truth, to answer and apologize the Words of Truth, in the great dependencies of Prophecy, to them that send to me for them.
But, as it is well urged a∣gainst the enemies of the Natu∣ral Religion, as well as Revealed; that though there cannot be Mathematical Demonstration of those Great Truths, as of Eu∣clid's Propositions; yet there may be as Convictive Proofs, in their kind, and as satisfactory to
 true Understanding: Even so I affirm, that the Prophetick Ima∣ges, and Numbers, if they are attently eyed, and compared, may be as certainly Assur'd; and In∣tellectual enquiries even satia∣ted with the evidence of them; Though they are not under such Proofs, as the plain Do∣ctrines and Precepts of Scrip∣ture, yet by such a Probation, as is most proper to them, they are certain in their kind: As the proof of so plain a point in its kind, as Repentance is, is as cer∣tain in its kind, as the proof of Natural Religion, in its Kind; which is as certain, as a Mathe∣matick Proposition, in its kind: So sure is Prophecy: In the Good∣ness
 of our Creator, and Mediator; in giving, and sustaining our Faculties in the true use of themselves; so sure are each of these; and each of them, in their kind, as sure the one, as the other; even the Word of Prophecy, sure as any.
For as I have often said, e∣ven these Enigmatical parts of Scripture, are most certainly, as will be easily allowed, infallibly true in their own sense: They are therefore to be under∣stood; For so is all Truth: They are Revealed; and therefore it is intended by God, they should be understood. If to be understood, they may be known, they are truly understood, by the Consciousness to ones self of
 the evidence of those Critierions, and Marks of Truth, most Con∣natural to them; that All Parts answer one to another; that they answer to what must be most apparently the main Scope and Intention of the whole; and that Historical Matter of Fact answers all along; which makes all certain; As he that hath a Key to a Cyphar, or to Hi∣story in Picture or Emblem, may be assur'd he hath it, when he Finds all agree, one part with ano∣ther; and the whole with what was reasonable to be expected, and supposed to be the Design.
And if any one should say, Why should this be Revealed to me
 so unworthy; so little prepared with all the Advantages of Learning and Books.
I do most humbly Acknow∣ledg the Dint of this Prejudice; and can only Answer, as I have done : So it pleased him, and to humble me to lowest Abasement (How∣ever I most humbly Confess wholly by my own sin, and guilt) as in a solitary Patmos for it; And I cannot but hope, now I look upon my Testi∣mony as near Finished, and that things are just now upon their Complement, he may be pleas'd also to Disconfine me when his Witnesses are so near, Comming out of their
 Sackcloth, and that I shall in their Rising, rise out of this Civil Death: But not my will, but his will be done.
I have therefore, I say, up∣on the whole, presented this Discourse, as upon one Rea∣son; that by it you may look upon my other Treatises, as not the Performances of a Fana∣tick or Phantastick; or one that would  but . Much less, , or what is Written, but to speak forth the words of Soberness and Truth, as well in the one, as the other.
2. That from the Conjuncti∣on of the one part with the o∣ther, the Prophetick with the
 Doctrinal, you may be, (as however I Hope; and am Per∣swaded you are) more excited, and may move more Vigorous∣ly and Zealously in the Promot∣ing National Repentance and Re∣formation; as I have also in the Inferences of the discourse, press'd; seeing therein is most certain∣ly the greatest Magnification of your National Office, or Episco∣pacy; that as having greatest nearness to the Affairs, and Per∣sons, that are at the Top; and who, as Springs, move what is below them; you do therein  minister in Offering them up to God; For not Worldly Gran∣dieur, nor any of the Cathedra∣lities of your State, nor an
 Animal or Sensitive, (however not Sensual) Hospitality will sustain you; but this is the best Account that can be given of such a Pre-eminence; when it is indeed of National Superi∣ority in an Elijah Like Fervor, and Influence for National Reformation; seeing it is certain in an Union in true Religion; a National Episcopacy Devoted to its true ends, tho in it self but Civil, may be service∣able to National Godliness.
Hereon I have set my Foot in this Dedication to you, and Acknowledgment of you; that if you are indeed for, and with God in your Pre-lations; you will be Blessed, not only with
 Good Wishes, and Endeavours, but with happy Successes; not only in Word, but in Power, in such your Character and Sta∣tion. For all Wise and Good Mens Eyes are now upon you, to know not your Names or Titles, or Speech, but your Power in Ho∣ly Influences upon the Nation from you.
But the very want of Blessing from Heaven and Success therein, and to find that National Vices, and Irreligion surmount your Sphere, and grow up above it to Heaven, is reason for great Humiliation, and even Jealousy over your Constitu∣tion; tho without your guilt.
But this will bear you in so great a Revolution, so near, as
 I declare to you. For even as that Building, call'd Pauls, that is rising so Sumptuous, e're it climb to its top, shall only stand, if it can be any way Serviceable in that Kingdom's Succession so nigh; so it may be supported; else its goodly Stones and Building will not, at least, to such an use, as Cathedral only, be one Stone left up∣on another, with how magnificent a Zeal soever it be carried on: It is begun too late to such a pur∣pose, if it be so intended: Even so a National Episcopacy suffer∣ing the Loss of all that is but Hay and Stubble in it, as by Fire, may yet be Sav'd, or Continue in its National Presidency, if it can be found as such, Service∣able
 for Offering up whole Na∣tions more speedily to God, and Christ; else it will vanish away as Froth, and empty Bubbles; For let us all be sure, the Kingdom of God is coming upon us, which is not Word but Power; Although therefore, you do not smite the men-servants, or Maid-servants, or eat and drink with the Drunken; Yet I humbly beseech you to take heed, that as Wise, and good Stewards set over the Houshold, you give diligently that portion of Meat in due Season, all the most efficacious Perswa∣sions, and Influences for Repentance, and even National Reformation.
And herein what can be so mighty to perswade, as if with
 United Applications to it, You would search, and encourage all that do search, and hold out that sure Word of Prophecy; that hath shone so long, and yet shines in the Dark place of this Apostacy, till the very day dawn, and the day Star arise; Because I most Hum∣bly Assure you in the Name of the Great Master of the Family, he will no longer delay his Coming, but he is very near at hand. I hope Providence hath Introduced you to such a purpose; and as I humbly hope, this Doctrine of Repentance is presented to your Hands, to∣gether with so many Discour∣ses, that the Kingdom of Heaven is nigh at Hand; that upon that very Consideration you may be
 most Zealous in it: So I earnest∣ly Pray, you may be Blessed in your Lord finding you so doing: Verily, I say unto you, he shall make you greater Rulers in a truly Evangelical Sense, than now you are: And as to the black and dark side I make no mention of it; be∣cause I am perswaded better things of you, and such as Ac∣company the Salvation, and Glory of that Kingdom.
