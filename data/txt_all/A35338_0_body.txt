SIR,
PRomises are due debt; you were pleased not long since, so far to encourage my en∣devours as to claim this Poem; which I (having nothing which I might truly ar∣rogate to my self, but you might justly challenge yours, as purchas'd by your fa∣vours) thankfully promised; and now at length, like Pharaohs Butler, on the consideration of your manifold Curtesies, being check'd to a remembrance of my promise, humbly tender, and with it (like the poor Spa∣niard, who when a Father of the Inquisition desired but the Fruit, presented him the Tree) present my self; ac∣cept this with the like candour of mind, as I devote it with it really, and I shall esteem my hopes anchor'd in a happy Bay. If any upbraid me, being a Poet, with the fatall name of a begger, I answer with the sweet Singer of Isra∣el Adhuc & vilior fiam, so I may but herein do God the least service, and so render my self gracious to your ac∣ceptance; nor doubt I but time may so midwife it, that here∣after I may tender some thing which may (if not redeem some of my engagements) yet induce your courtesie to forbear the debts wherein stands obliged
