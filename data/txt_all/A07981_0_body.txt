RIght VVorshipfull and VVorship∣fuls, considering that the Libra∣ries of the Greekes and Romaines are plentifully stuffed with the records of their owne atchieue∣ments: whereby they haue not onely preserued their names, but haue also gotten thereby an euerlasting fame vnto all posterities: therefore hauing so fit an occasion to manifest my loue, and so worthy a subiect to expresse my dutie, I haue thought good to tempt your acceptance in this small presentment of her Maiesties royall Entertain∣ment: which although it be not beautified with refi∣ned words, nor yet sufficiently adorned with Poetical

For, as the Sunne obscures all lesser Lights,
So Vertues lustre dampes all Enuies sleights.
Finally, if you but daigne to shew a fauourable aspect vpon these Orphan-Lines, I will neyther feare the distaste of the Cinick, nor the sole conceite of the Censorious: for although many carpes are ex∣pected when curious eyes come a-fishing, yet our pa∣tience shall suppe vp, and make roome for better ser∣uices, when Zo-ilus with his barkings, or Momus with his detractions, waites to serue the Table: meane while prostituting these rude Lines to the sole approbation of your iudicious Censures, and my selfe to your Seruice, I rest
