SIR, the stranger may these my sa∣lutations seeme vnto ye, in that I being a Stranger and neuer treading on English ground till this instant, make choice of you for my first En∣tertainer, intruding my selfe as a guest, whereas yet I haue no acquaintance at all. But if you

shall deeme me blame-worthy heerein, (as I will not greatly stand in maintaining anie pre∣sumption) the fault indeed is a kinde Countrimans of yours, who would needes haue mee leaue my honourable Friends in Italy, and those great prefer∣ments alotted me in France, to trie the aire & climate of faire Englands Maiden Kingdome. And whereas diuers others in∣treated me to honorable habi∣tations, yea, as great places of reckoning as anie mine owne natiue Soile affoorded me: yet the perswasions of this your wel-wishing Friend hath ouer∣ruled

me, to lay all my fortunes at your feete, & either by your fauour to liue here for euer, or by your discountenance to re∣turne backe disgraced. The rude English I speake, I learnd it of him: the danger I may in∣curre, I impose vpon him: one∣ly (for his friendly association in my trauell) if you allow me anie grace, bestow it on him. For, as his affection to you ex∣ceedeth that of manie: so, (in mine opinion) if you trie him, you shall finde him as forward to your welfare as anie.
