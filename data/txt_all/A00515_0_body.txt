RIght Honorable, hauing (long since) often weighed and considered, with my selfe, the great care & paines that haue been taken, in setting forth sundry necessary books for plan∣ting & grafting of fruit, & finding it (by much experience) no lesse needfull, that the right order, in gatheting & keeping thereof, should be made knowen, & obserued: I re∣solued, at length (for the general good of the whole kingdome) to lay downe, in this small Treatise, the disorder and abuses of the vnskilful in this kinde; together with the true & due course to be taken therein. The worke now finished, I haue presumed (though far vnworthy) to publish it, to the world (vnder the shadow of your honorable protection) as the first fruites of a willing minde, ready to make tender of his humble seruice, & acknowledgement of all duty, to your Lordship, to performe it, in what he may. Not doubting, but that, as your Ho: (next vn∣der his Maiestie) hath been the protectour & preseruer of the whole realme of Ireland, you will also vouchsafe to patronize and protect one Irish-borne, who (by long experience) hath made triall of that which he deliuereth to others. Wherefore, humbly crauing, that your Honour will bee pleased to accept hereof, & to giue it countenance (that so the rather it may haue free passage, in despite of malitious & scornfull tongues, into the hands of all such as desire to eat the fruite of their owne vi∣neyards, in their due season): I conclude with my earnest and feruent prayers to Almighty God, for the protection and pre∣seruation of your good Lordship, in all true honour & happi∣nes, in this life; & hereafter to make you partaker of that inua∣luable & incorruptible fruit of the life eternall, which groweth not in orchards of mens planting, but in the Paradise of God,
Nouember, the 7.
