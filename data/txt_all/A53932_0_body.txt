You may remember that one Mr. Paul Hobson, who prosesseth and preaches up that faith which teaches a man to doubt whether Christ died for him or no, did write a little book by way of Answer to the fourteen Queries, and ten Absurdities which I presented unto him
Which book I thought I was bound to answer, for the sake of truth, because he doth labour by so ma∣ny subtilties to overthrow the very foundation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: And indeed, had there not been an urgent necessity compelling me thereto, I should not have undertaken such a task, being I con∣fess very unable to manage so great a work, in such a publick manner; which I have done, though accor∣ding to truth and my best endeavours, yet not with∣out some fears, lest my weakness should disadvan∣tage the righteous and undoubted cause I have in hand. I had also another discouragement upon my spirit, when I considered how many most excellent works are now in Print already, about this subject, so far transcending what I could say; Notwithstanding I
was perswaded to adventure, upon this consideration, That if I should have buried all in silence, many of the Lords people might have stumbled, and fallen from the truth of the Gospel, and the adversaries thereof would have triumphed, and so have hardned their necks more and more against the light of the glory of God, shining forth to all the world, in the face of Jesus Christ.
I desire you (dear Brethren) to accept this my small, and first work of this nature, in right good part, and seriously peruse it over with an attentive eye; I have endeavoured as much brevity as would stand with plainness.

But ye unto whom God hath given a spirit of discer∣ning between truth and errour, I trust will defend this little book, because it labours to deffend the truth.
I pray God of heaven to encrease in you all vertu∣ous and sound Principles, that from thence may spring, and also encrease a holy and Godly conversa∣tion, more and more, until we come to be perfect be∣fore our God in Sion, This is the earnest request of
