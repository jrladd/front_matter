BOokes are but poore gifts, yet
Kings receiue them: vpō which
I presume, you will not turne
This out of doores. Yet cannot
for shame but bid it welcome,
because it bringes to you a great quantitie of
my loue: which, if it be worth litle, (and no
maruell if Loue be solde vnder-foote, when the
God of Loue himselfe goes naked) yet I hope
you will not say you haue a hard bargaine, Si∣thēce
you may take as much of it as you please
for nothing. I haue clapt the Cognizance of your
name, on these scribled papers, it is their liue∣ry:
So that now they are yours: being free frō
any vile imputation, saue only, that they thrust
themselues into your acquaintance. But gene∣all
errors, haue generall pardons: for the title

of other mens names, is the common Heral∣dry
which all those laie claime too, whose crest
is a Pen-and-Inckhorne. If you read, you may
happilie laugh; tis my desire you should, be∣cause
mirth is both Phisicall, and wholesome
against the Plague: with which sicknes, (to tell
truth) this booke is, (though not sorely) yet
somewhat infected. I pray, driue it not out of
your companie for all that; for (assure your
soule) I am so iealous of your health, that if
you did but once imagine, there were gall in
mine Incke, I would cast away the Standish,
and forsweare medling with anie more Mu∣ses.
