Dear Brethren,
YOu have here presented to your view those profitable Sermons, which sounded sweetly in your Ears. He Preached on this Chapter, as for your Edification and Consolation, so (as he told me) for his own, for he had many Warnings of putting off his Taber∣nacle. They were Preached on the former part of the Lords day, for he Preached on the after∣noon from other Scriptures, more suitable to the greater part of his Auditors. These were his last Sermons.
We read of the great Prophet Elijah, that he left his Mantle, when he was caught up to Hea∣ven, 2 King. 2. 13. by which great Wonders were effected. And by the blessing of God, who giveth the increase, great things may be wrought by a spiritual, though not miraculous operation, in the reading of these Sermons.
By these we may understand what a great blessing you enjoyed in such a Minister for above

Thirty years, who was abundant in Labours. And likewise how great your Loss is under which you yet mourn!
He was (as is well known) an Interpreter one of a Thousand, Job 33. 23. An Apollos, mighty in the Scriptures, Acts 18. 24.
Though you are in want of a good Shepherd to feed the Flock, yet you must say as Abraham (of old) to his Son Isaac, God will provide.
I intend brevity, and only add a word or two more to you that were his Flock; Remember how you have received and heard, and hold fast and repent, Rev. 3. 3. Brethren, farewel, be per∣fect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you.
