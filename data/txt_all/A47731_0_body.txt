May it please Your Grace,
THE General Complaint of the want of Books of Fortifica∣tion in our English Tongue, has encouraged me to Translate at of Monsieur Vauban: To which I as invited by the almost Universal Applause  has received from the most competent dges. Nothing could have emboldned me  the Presumption of this Address, but the od and Welfare of my Native Countrey,  proposing your Grace to the Imitation of

our Nobility and Gentry, which seems to be the only Means for this Kingdom to recover its Ancient Glory. I doubt not, but that brave Example which your Grace continually sets to the whole Nation, will inspire the Men of Quality to come up to it, as near as possible: Which, if they had always done, Vauban might, without any great Detriment to us, have been confin'd to the Territories of his Master. That your Grace may ever prosper, and re∣ceive the Honours due to so great Merits; as it is the greatest Good can be wished you, so it is no less the uneigned Desire of,
May it please your Grace,
