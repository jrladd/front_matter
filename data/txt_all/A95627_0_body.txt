May it please your Grace,
SO great and high are your Graces zealous Affections, and just Ve∣neration for the best of Kings, that no Sermon which is perswa∣sive to Allegiance can pass unregarded by you, but receives in∣couragement beyond its merit; of which observed truth, your Commands for this mean Discourse are an evident Demonstration. I little thought, having so happily escaped your learned Ear, to undergo the Test of your most piercing Eye: but having then preached Obedience to others, I must practise it my self, and submit to the kind Injunctions of so great a Superior; 'tis therefore laid at your Graces feet, hoping my Loyalty will attone its many imperfections, and the dayly fears of our Soveraigns Assassination may justifie its zeal and warmth; For, what tongue can be silent, to see the Father of our Countrey assaulted with such variety of Deaths? To see the Ponyard at his sacred Breast, the fatal Dose preparing, and the Gun ready to fire, must fill every true Subject with horrour and resolution. He is the Head of the Body Politick, and as in the Natural, all the Members strive to defend the Head, and share in its pain, so should it be in this; the bloody hand which is lift up against him must wound all loyal souls, the cursed Sword which strikes at him must pierce their hearts; they must value the Life of their Prince infinitely above their own, and run through the greatest difficulties to preserve him; and if they dye in his defence, they perpetuate their Name on Earth, and re∣ceive the Reward of their Fidelity in Heaven; which true Protestant Principle made many thousands in the late times leap into the midst of dangers, and run through the armed Troops of their too potent Enemies; their greatest force could not make them yield, but they covered that Post with their Bodies, which they could not maintain with their Arms, and willingly died martyrs for their King, their Religion, and Country.
This (my Lord) many places can witness, but none more in this King∣dom than this Loyal Town, in defence of which, your Graces valiant Bro∣ther
(famous for Courage and Conduct) and many hundreds more, did triumphantly lose their lives; their blood ran in streams through our streets, and like the brave Leonidas in the Straits of Thermopyle, they with a small number opposed an Army, and no doubt but there are vast multitudes in each of these Kingdoms, who will imitate those He∣roick spirits, and cheerfully fall, for the King, and the Church.
And if ever good Subjects should demonstrate their Courage, it is now; if ever Protestants should love, honour and obey their King, it is now; when the cruel Jesuits are plotting and consulting to murther him, and subvert our Religion; in this they are closely combined, this they hold lawful and just, as I have proved out of many of their Books, besides Mariana, (though a Jesuit lately executed would confess none else of that Judgment.) But alas! instead of uniting against them, we ban∣dy into Sects and Factions; we run into Schisms and Divisions, and make way for them to destroy us; we forget how the Civil Discords of our Ancestours brought our King and Countrey under the Subjection of the Roman Emperour, and I wish our violent heats about Religion, do not at last bring our Church under the vassalage of the Roman Bishop, and our State into some imminent danger; for without an agreement in that, our Kingdoms cannot flourish: Where men differ in Ecclesiasticks, they usually clash in Politicks, and have their own intrigues and designs to promote their Opinions; they are jealous and doubtful one of another, and like the several Factions in Rome and Carthage, while they pre∣tend the good of the Commonwealth, they destroy it.
Of this, our late bloody and tragical Devastations are an undeniable Evidence, and that we are falling into the same miseries again, is more than probable; for seditious and fiery spirits do now (as formerly) fill the floating heads of the vulgar, with causless fears and jealousies, and make the King and his greatest Ministers the common Subject of their Dis∣course, and if all things be not done, and timed according to their humour, (as if they knew all Reasons of State, and had Intelligence from all parts of the world) then do they calumniate and slander the Government; and asperse those most, who have ever been most eminent for their Loyalty to the King and the Church, and would now die in their defence; and thus are the people deluded, and made subservient to some aspiring male-contents, who by their Agents and Emissaries do in all places reflect on
the Management of Affairs, and make them Patrons of Pope∣ry, who have ever abhorred it, and were lately for their aver∣sion to it to be cruelly murthered, as is constantly affirmed byDr Oats's Nar. p. 16. 23, 25. those on whose Evidence most of our late Discoveries depend.
But your Grace well remembers, this was their method in the begin∣ning of our late troubles, they (according to Machiavals Advice) did boldly libel and calumniate, and to destroy both Church and State, they subverted their strongest Pillars, under the pretence of being cor∣rupted and rotten with Popery, and by clamour and noise made all Pa∣pists, who were not as rash, furious, and disloyal as themselves. Nay those holy Prelates, whose most learned Works will be eternal Arme∣ries, and most impregnable Fortresses against the whole power of Rome, were most unjustly and ingratefully branded with the same Character; and such are now their Designs and Practices; They would perswade the people to have an ill opinion of our Governours, that they might the more securely carry on their own Designs; But I hope God will infuse a spirit of Discerning into our King, our Parliaments, and Counsellors, and that all who are in any Authority will fix one Eye on those subtile Ʋnderminers both of Church and State, that while they are most zealous and intent (and blessed be God they are so) on the suppression of Popery, our rigid Sectaries may not grow too numerous and formidable; for when greedy and voracious flames seize on both ends of a Ship, the mid∣dle part is like to perish; and we know Diseases long neglected may prove destructive. In the beginning of the Reformation, the Genevian Infecti∣on did spread it self, and the good Queen could not easily prevent it, her Thoughts being chiefly employed in the Extirpation of Popery, which dangerous Evil the wise King James did soon perceive, and resolve to redress, as appears by his Proclamations against them, and his first Speech to his Parliament, in which, speaking of the Sectaries and No∣velists, he says, They are ever discontented with the present Govern∣ment, and impatient to suffer any Superiority, which makes their Sect unable to be suffered in any well governed Commonwealth; yet he did not do it; for the Gunpowder Plot turned his Eyes wholly on the Pa∣pists, and so had the Separatists an opportunity to increase to such: prodigious number, as proved destructive to his Son, the Church, and these Kingdoms: Which, with the two late Rebellions in Scotland,
may move our Governours to look back sometimes, and watch the mo∣tions of the Kirk: But I presume too far; and must beg your Graces pardon, for the loss of your minutes in viewing this rude Address, so low a Style is no way fit for your Graces view, who are (as was said of Clem. Alex,) Inter Doctos, summè Eloquens, inter Eloquentes, sum∣mè Doctus; In you the Piety and Zeal, the Wisdom and Courage, and other justly admired Accomplishments of your Graces late great Prede∣cessors, are most happily met; You every way fill and adorn your Chair, in which, that your Grace may long sit, and continue what you are, one of the greatest Pillars both of Church and State, is the Prayer of,
