Gentlemen,
OUR Countrey is the most fam'd of any, in the World, for the Liberty we enjoy, and the se∣curity we have made to our Property by its excel∣lent Laws: Yet, I think Societies are, upon some occasions, so very strict, that to less discerning Eyes they may seem meer Monopolies. I must complain of my own hardships in this matter espe∣cially; but to whom, I know not; for tis from You that all my misfortunes flow; and since this Error of the first Concoction cannot be so easily re∣trieved among you, by Reason of the fault and defect in the Constitution that hinders People of singular parts, tho' now of a mean Office, at last to arrive to the liberty of being admitted a Fellow among you: to be a Licentiate will not go down, since Colbatch s admission. I confess I did once re∣solve to have suppress'd all those aspiring thoughts, with considerations of Religion; but when I see scandalous Libels thrown about against you, and these so fitted to the Capacity of the Mob, that you think their Author below your wrath; I must per∣swade my self that my Religion obliges me to se∣cure my Neighbour's good Name, and that the following defence of my old Masters may entitle me a great deal better to a Diploma, than any thing this feigned friend of the College can pre∣tend

to; and may also prevent my Petitioning the King and Parliament to oblige you to do me Justice.
But if we look into the merit of the Cause, it must be allowed me that I who have seen so many Dissections, heard so many Lectures, over-heard so many Examinations of Young Physicians, I who have kept the Books written by our learned Mem∣bers, and have very often carried their Gowns and Caps, must be a great deal more knowing in all the difficult parts of Physick than He. Did I not hear the learned Dr Harvey talk after so lively a man∣ner of the Blood's Circulation, and his Generation ex Ovo, that I vow and swear, I have thought I have seen the Drunken Heart spew out its Blood into the great Artery, and I could trace its Stages thro' the whole Body? then for the business of the Valves, I have so lively an Idea of them, that I can show you them only by look∣ing upon you Skin. But as for the Generation, that did so tickle me when I was a Young Man, that I easily apprehended the false Notions of for∣mer Physicians upon that Subject: I can yet give a very plain description of that genital liquor at∣tacking the ripe Egg in the Ovarium, and a great deal more that I saw at some diffections he made to King Charles II. nay, for my part, I thought all this matter was so clear that I wonder the Dr never found the way to get a Male-child at one bout of a Consummation Action. We have Sir George Ent's Book too that defends his Circulation contra omnes mortales, for as easy a matter as Colbatch thinks it; but had he had to do with Parisanus, the old fellow wou'd have plaid the Devil with him, and his Li∣gature too; then came Dr Glisson with his Livers, Stomachs, and Guts so nicely prepar'd, that the Secretion of the Gall, the Digestion, the business of the Chyle, and the Excrements were so familiar to me, that I had no difficulties left me in that affair. But as for Dr Willis, he was the first that

taught us to dissect the Brain, that we might see all its parts; when Physicians before him were con∣tent to slice it down like a piece of Pudding, and when Des Cartes did see his Glandula Pinealis stick∣ing in a slice like a Plum, he was a great Master who could hit upon it once in five times; but our Dr cou'd show you any thing, and when you pleas'd; he trac'd out all the Nerves, and describ'd nobly the whole Brain: I have heard him talk of his Anima Brutorum, his Books of Fermentation, Ʋrins, Fevers, &c. with that exactness, that I must own that I have had sometimes the Vanity to think my self as learned a Physician as himself. Dr Wharton began first to number the Glands, and to undeceive the World of a fancy they had about Parenchymatous substances. Next came Dr Lower, who told us of the Hearts being Muscular, and put it under the same laws; he tells us in the same Book of putting Blood out of one Animal into another, and what advantage that may be in cu∣ring some Diseases. Dr Havers gives us a Book of the Make of the Bones, and Dr Riddley gives us a Lecture upon the Brain, tho' a Frenchman one de Vuyssens had made Dr Willis's way more clear, yet not so much neither, but that the Dr has done it in greater order. Dr Garth read very finely upon Respiration and the use of the Lungs: Dr Lister has oblig'd us with the Anatomy of Snails, and Dr Cockburn with an O Econom. Animalis. Of Bota∣naists we have had a vast number, and lately Dr Sloan has given us an excellent account of the Plants of the Leeward Islands: Pharmacians, a great many, and lately Dr Bates. But for the Theory and practice of Medicin, no Countrey has exceeded us: in my time Willis both for the Theory and the Practice, Dr Charleton, Sir Theoder Mayern, Dr Bates, Dr Morton, and Dr Cockburn, who first told us how they are sick at Sea.
Now, can any Man think that I can be such a blockhead, as to have liv'd among all these Masters

in Medicin, to be bred up as it were at the foot of Gamaliel, and for so long a time; and not to be better qualified for my Admission than a fellow that either cannot think, or at least cannot tell us what he thinks, and yet is so vain as to esteem himself more knowing, than any of your worthy and learn∣ed Members; one of whom he attacks, because he▪s Dead, one still alive, and by Name; and ano∣ther he has only the courage to hint at, tho' he has told his story so plainly over the Town, that 'tis now no great difficulty to know him: and there∣fore I may hope that my thus proving a dutiful Servant, in giving my self all this trouble, may give me greater pretences to a Diploma, and to be more and more,
Gentlemen,
