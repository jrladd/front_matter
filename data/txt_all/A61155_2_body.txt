Noble Patriots,
IF I mistake not, you may here single out somthing of the Lords from what is mine, and discerne some beames of God amongst many things of man. I know the candle of the Lord cannot shine any where with more snuff then in me; however since the Lord hath lighted it, I dare not but let it shine (or rather glimmer) before men. I have writ your Names to my Book that I may be one of your Remembrancers amongst the rest to the advancement of Truth; not but they who know ye, know ye to be acted by a Spirit of Truth in your selves. The Lord remember ye according to all the good ye have done (in your severall Ministra∣tions) to this people; and do that for ye which gives you most, and yet takes most from ye, even filling ye with himself; till he hath emp∣tied ye of all but his own glory, and gathered ye up into the fulnesse and righteousnesse of himselfe in Christ, where we are only nothing in our selves, and every thing in him; and surely the most, and best and greatest thing he can do for the sons of men, is, thus to make them nothing in their own account, that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord. I may seeme strange to wish ye thus; but I know it is not strange to ye, who know the Mystery of the Spirit, and of Christ.
My Lord, and Sir, Go on still, yet still laying your designes in a glo∣ry above that of States and Kingdomes, and involving all your Counsels there, where there is most of Heaven, and least of the world.
So praies,
