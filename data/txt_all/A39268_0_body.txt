May it Please your Grace,
WIthout any Apology, either for my weakness, too apparent in this Performance, or for my boldness in the Dedication; I here in all humility beseech your Grace to accept of this very slender Present; tho' it can signifie no more, but only this, that I acknowledge a duty incumbent upon me, and (tho' I shall never be able to make full payment) I am very desirous to do all that I can towards the dis∣charging of it.
In these little things which I have the confidence to call Two seasonable Dis∣courses, I have endeavour'd to do some part of that great Duty, which I owe both to God

and the King, both to Church and State, and particularly, to that Congregation wherein, under your Grace's noble Patro∣nage, I am set to exercise the Ministry committed to me.
It cannot therefore, I hope, look like a Presumption, to give your Grace this ac∣count, how your Tenants are instructed by me in their great Duties of Religion and Loyalty. And if in that which is here hum∣bly offered to your Grace's eye, any Satisfa∣ction be given in that particular, I must account it reason enough why I thus expose my Infirmi∣ties to the view and Censure of the World; and also why I despair not of a Pardon, if it make so bold with your Grace, as to tell the World, wherever it comes, that it is but the smallest part of that great Debt and Duty which is owing by
My Lord,
