SIR,
HAd I no scale (more then this bare and plaine moulded Epistle) by which to come to your Worships eares, yet in respect of the honest Liuery which it carries (being necessary and husbandly collections, especially gathered for the Country and Soile wherein you liue) I know, it cannot chuse but finde both fauour and mercy in your acceptation; but when I call vp into my consideration, the great worthi∣nesse of your experience in this and all other the like affaires, which tend to the generall benefit of the Com∣mon wealth, and weigh the excellency of your wise∣dome, iudgement, bounty, and affection vnto hospita∣lity (which giue both strength and aduancement to pro∣iects of this nature) I could not but take vnto my selfe a double encouragement, and boldly say vnto this worke which I offer to your goodnesse; Goe and ap∣proach

with all thy sweetnesse before him, he that so per∣fectly knowes all which thou canst or wouldst discouer; he that is able both to correct and amend any thing that is imperfect in thee, hee, for vertues sake, will ne∣uer forsake thee. Beleeue mee (worthy Sir) should this subiect wish it selfe a Patron, I doe not thinke, it could wish beyond you; for you are a volumne full of all that of which it intreateth: witnesse your yeeres, your place, your supportation of the poore, and your continuall imployments; with any of which, there is not (of your Ranke) a second liuing in your Country, to walke hand in hand with you; Being then (deare Sir) the oldest and best friend to your Country; for∣sake neither her, nor this which comes to serue it; and though in this Glasse some lineaments may appeare im∣perfect, yet by the helpe of your fauour (though little be exact or most excellent) nothing shall bee grosse or vnworthy the suruay of your worthier patience. And so I rest,
