QVeenes, the Mothers of our Kings, by whom is continued the blessing of succession that preserues the Kingdome, hauing their parts running in the times wherein they liue, are likewise interressed in the Histories thereof, which containe their memories and all that is left of them, when they haue left to be in this world. And therefore to you, great Queene of England (and the greater by your loue to the nation, and the blessing you haue brought forth for the continuation of the future good thereof) doe I your humblest seruant addresse this peece of our History; which, as it is a worke of mine, appertaines of right to your Maiestie, being for the most parte done vnder your Roofe, during my atten∣dance vpon your sacred person: and if euer it shall come to bee an intire worke, and merit any acceptation in the world, it must remaine among the memorials of you, and your time, as brought forth vnder the splendor of your goodnes. Howsoe∣uer, this which is done shall yet shew how desirous I haue beene to lay out my time and industry, as farre as my ability would extend to doe your Maiestie, and my Country seruice in this kinde.
And though at high Altares, none but high Priests ought to sacrifize, yet vouchsafe mighty Queene, to accept this poore oblation from the hand of your Maiesties
