FOr a testimoni∣all to the world, how I haue and doo (I praise God) bestowe the pretious treasure of time, euen now in the state of my virginitie or maiden∣hood; lo heare I dedicate to all good Ladies, Gentlewo∣men, and others, who haue a desire to inuocate and call vp∣on the name of the Lord, a
 small handfull of grose hearbs; which I haue presumed to ga∣ther out of the garden of Gods most holie word. Not that there is anie vnpurenes there∣in, but that (peraduenture) my rudenes may be found to haue plucked them vp vnreuerent∣lie, and without zeale.
Wherevpon of the learned I may be iudged grose and vn∣wise; in presuming, without the counsell or helpe of anie, to take such an enterprise in hand: neuertheles, as GOD dooth know, I haue doone it with a good zeale, according to the weakenes of my know∣ledge and capacitie. And al∣though they be not so plea∣sant in taste, as they can find
 out, to whom God hath gi∣uen the spirit of learning: yet doo I trust, this small handfull of grose hearbs, holesome in operation and workeing, shall be no lesse acceptable before the maiestie of almightie God than the fragrant floures of o∣thers, gathered with more vn∣derstanding.
But without presumption I may boldlie saie, they haue not sought them with a more willing hart and feruent mind; nor more to the aduancement of Gods glorie, & the desire of acceptation, than I haue doon. Which if I may obtaine, with the good iudgement and li∣king of all my brethren and sisters in the Lord, I shall
 thinke my time most happilie bestowed: for that thereby I did auoid idlenes, to the plea∣sing of almightie God; and haue gained those, whom I know not, as well strangers to me, as my acquaintance, to be my freends, that shall taste these grose hearbs with me.
The Lord Iesus Christ, who moisteneth all his elect with his most pretious blood, giue vs all a sweete taste in him: whome I humblie beseech, from the bottome of my hart, to giue vnto those that are vertuouslie bent, a desire to increase therein; and those, which haue not yet reached therevnto, I praie the holie Ghost to inspire their hearts
 from aboue, that they and we may be worthie to meete to∣gether, in the blessed king∣dome of our heauenlie father, which his deare sonne our sa∣uior Iesus Christ did purchase for vs; whose blessed name, with the liuing father, and the holie Ghost, be prai∣sed and magnified now and for euer, Amen, A∣men.
