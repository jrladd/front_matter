SIR,
I Cannot express a truer or greater Regard to You, (in compliance with whose Desires this Discourse is made Pub∣lick) than (agreeably to the Subject of it) to Wish and Pray, that You may be ef∣fectually prevailed upon thereby, seriously to fore-think what Your Last Wishes shall be; and to make Your Present Re∣solutions accordingly, viz. To live the Life of the Righteous, and then, You
shall Die the Death of the Righte∣ous, and Your last End shall be like his. This I do most heartily Wish and Pray for, on behalf of You and of all those, for whose Souls I am more especi∣ally concerned, for I am, in the best and highest Sense,
