Sir,
YOur Approbation of some wandring Papers,
brought casually to your sight, and whisper'd to
be mine, inuites me to owne this, and send it a∣broad
secur'd by the Safe Conduct of Your Iudgment: I ven∣ture
to transforme a Stoick into one of the Muses, to reduce
to Harmony a rigid peice of Philosophy; and because an
Imperiall Envy, and therefore the highest, (that which de∣sign'd
the suppression of Homer, Virgil, and Livie,)
censur'd the Authors Workes, to be but Arena sine calce,
I have without any violence knit up His short Booke of
the Shortnes of Life, into a naturall Poem; which
may bee thus farre usefull, that the Readers memory may
retaine his Acute and Redundant witt with more facillity:
I make the addresse to you, thereby to prefixe a President,
that wisely spins out this narrow Thread of Life in the way
prescrib'd; which Remarkeable Example (that being all
the Addition I make) must needs contribute no small vi∣gour
to the Precepts of Seneca.
