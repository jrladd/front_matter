Right Honourable,
IF you suffer not in your Judgment by commanding the following Discourse to be made publick, I am very well satisfied, I cannot in my Obedience, it being the best Application of any Sermon, next to that of the Hearers practice, to be inforced by so good Autho∣rity; Especially where the chief design of what is deliver'd in it, is but to discover some of those present Epidemick Distempers of the Nation, for which in your wise Counsels, you have allready prescribed such wholsom Remedies; so that in what the Preacher is most earnest to be heard, 'tis only where you have been so before him; I mean, as in your timely discountenancing those men of evil designs, who matter not what name they make use of, no not, though it be that of the best Religion, the Re∣form'd Protestant Faith it self, to bring us into disorder and confusion; so in your Care to restrain that exorbitant Li∣cence
 of the Press, so much of late abused to the purposes of Sedition and Rebellion, as if what was the Invention of a Soldier at first (for so Printing was) must have so much of its Author, as to be still sounding the Alarm to the Public: But (God be thanked) you have not been wanting to do your Parts to prevent all its mischiefs, you have not been wanting in your Wisdoms to divert the Ruin, on the Brink whereof we have so long stood; you have hi∣therto been the Shield to defend us (let me use the words of my Context) against the Bow the Wicked had bent, a∣gainst the Arrow they had made ready on the string: Nor need we fear the destroying the Foundations, as long as it shall please God in his good Providence to keep this great and Royal City upon a firm bottom; that is, as long as you shall go on to Execute the good Laws, under which to the dread of our Enemies, and the Envy of all round about us, we may so safely dwell: As long as you shall continue to uphold the Establisht Religion, which in so critical a time you have so worthily avowed: Let but this Jerusalem, be as a City that is thus Compact to∣gether, and at Unity within itself: Do but you go on to lead the Example of Loyalty to the most Gracious and best of Princes, and of Obedience to his and Gods righteous Commands, the Reverence you pay the Laws, will be re∣turn'd in the Obedience due to your own Government, the Care you have for the true Religion, repaid in the Care God will have of you: Nor is it, I trust, a mean in∣stance of this his Care, that, (as 'tis so frequently applied to the Judges he raised up to deliver his own people) those
 whom you call out to it, seem to be such on whom His Spirit is to carry them through their weighty charge: 'Tis your Honour, 'Tis your Happiness that your own Body still furnishes you with Members worthy so great imployments, That as in this nick of time, wherein I am commanded this Duty, If the same Person whose name is prefixt to the Order continues not in the Office to see it Executed, how∣ever the Office and Government still survive the same; and one Excellent Magistrate lays not down the Sword, but to deliver it up to Another, who will not fail to wield it in Defence of the same Laws and the same Reli∣gion: That God Almighty would strengthen your hands, and hearts in both, shall be the dutiful Prayer of,
Right Honourable,
