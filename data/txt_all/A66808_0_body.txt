My Lords,
BEing necessarily engaged to appear again in Pub∣lick, in Vindication of what I formerly writ upon the Subject of Scarbrough-Spaw, and the asserting of the Mineral Princi∣ples thereof, it reminds me of my Obligations to Your Lordships, to whom of right belongs from me what ever Product that Spring affords. What there I had said about the Principles of that Spring, I have here further made good by convincing Arguments, answering all Objections to the contrary. My Lords, Here is
also a Defence of the Rational Method and Practice of Physick, which a fierce Chymical Pretender has designed to blast, to which I have added my En∣deavors of a Reconciliation between the Galenists and Chymists, in Refe∣rence to some Differences started up among them, through the pervers∣ness of some late Upstarts. The Ho∣nourable Testimony I have heard Both Your Lordships give of your sin∣cere Affection to Your respective Phy∣sicians, and the Art of Physick, doth justly challenge this Acknowledge∣ment, and renders Your Lordships most fit Patrons of This, that designs the Peace of the Faculty. Be pleased to accept this as a Symbole of Thanks and Service due to Both, from
My Lords,  York, May 25. 1669.
