COnsideryng (Ryght welbeloued) that since ye first age of our forefather Adam and his posteritie, great was the iniquitye which daylle more and more increased in the hart of man: again vewyng what a vice is Idlenes the moother of Deuo∣cion, ioyned with her handmayd Igno∣rance: I thought it conuenient to keepe my selfe vnblameable & excused of these two, so great, so wicked and detestable mischiefs, lest ye in any one iot I should be reproued in leanynge to these two so notorious vices. Pondring againe, the
 great vnfained frendship, which I haue receaued at your handes, I could not but shewe mine indeuour in requitynge the same, although not by outwarde gifte, yet by the inward affection, which lieth and hath alway remayned in mee, to the intent to recompence (though as it is in deede but slackly) your good will mani∣festly shewed vnto mee. But now as touching the matter from the tyme of our first Progenitoure, to the yeares of Noah that faithfull seruant of God, such was the diffused condicion of all estates, in followynge theyr wanton lustes and froward deuises, that God was sore dis∣pleased and his anger was vehemently kindled agaynst theim, so that were it not that his fatherly wisdome had sayd I will not alway striue with man seeyng hee is but dust, yea & repented him that hee had made him, were it not I saye for this hee had ben destroied for euermore.
Yet still did hee leane to his owne way neglectinge his maker, so mercifull and sauourable a God, so that iustly hee sent a Flood which couered the whole face of
 the earth, in whych inundation onelye Noah and his posterytie was saued, be∣yng preserued in the Arke, Since which Flood and the fyre of Sodoma and Go∣morrha, mannes corrupted nature was such, that yet he seased not to offend that now in the last age and yron world, ma∣nifold be thoffences which are dayly com¦mitted, to the grief of Gods elect. Yea since the two former worldes, the Gol∣den, & Brasen, which wer both nought, and yet the one worse then thother, ther remaineth yet this yron obstinat world, in wickednes exceeding bothe. And yet vndoubtedly gods word (God be praised therfore) is as much preached nowe as was then, but fewe be ryght followers therof. Wherfore because I haue in∣uayed against it, I praye you iudge not amisse of mee bycause here by you maye perceaue whyche bee the selye sheepe, and whyche the rauenynge Wolues, and how to make a seperation betwene them both. Desyrynge you to ac∣cept
 my good wyll in thys my small and barbarous indeuoure and hereafter I shalbe encourage to attemt a grea∣ter enterprise. And thus fare ye well.
