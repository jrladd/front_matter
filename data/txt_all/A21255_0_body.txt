If he come in loue let him liue, if otherwise, let him beare the price of his presumption. Wherefore though imboldned by a general report of your respectiue fauours to men any waies well quallited, I haue vnacquainted, boldly preâˆ£sumed to present this little Booke vnto your worships good acceptance: yet my meaning pretending a loue and dutious well wishing, And the Subiect prefering

no idle or vnprofitable substance, J hope, you will (with Aurelius) kindly regard the one, and fauorably censure of the other: for heerein J do but imytate the prescriptions of all former writers, who from time to time haue as well selected strangers, as those of their acquaintance to patronize their endeuors, beeing knowne to be louers of learning and vertue. I haue (in the like) heeretofore pleased many, and my trust is, J shall not now (in this) displease you, in which hope, J tender my labors to your good liking, And leaue your worship to the happy fruition of all your goldly, and hopefull expectations. Euer resting
