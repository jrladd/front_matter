THis mine ill-husbanded Suruey, long since begun, a great while discontinu∣ed, lately reuiewed, and now hasti∣ly finished, appealeth to your L. direction, whether it should passe; to your correction, if it doe passe; and to your pro∣tection, when it is passed. Neithervnduely: for the same intreateth of the Prouince, and persons, ouer whose bodies, and estates, you carrie a large, both Martiall, and ciuill commaund, by your authoritie, but in whose hearts, and loues, you possesse a farre greater interest, by your kindnesse. Your eares, and mouth, haue euer beene open, to heare, and deliuer our gricuances, and your feete, and hands, readie to goe, and worke their redresse, and that, not onely, alwayes, as a Magistrate, of your selfe, but also verie often, as a suiter, and solliciter to others, of the high∣est

place. Wherefore, I, as one of the common be∣holden, present this token of my priuate gratitude. It is dutie, and not presumption, that hath drawne me to the offering; and it must be fauour, and not desert, that shall moue your Lordship to the acceptance: and so I take hum∣ble leaue, resting no lesse willing to serue you, then vnder you.
