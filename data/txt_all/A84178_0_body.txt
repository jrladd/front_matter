SIR,
THAT neare Relation which you had by a con∣jugall tye to this most ex∣cellent Person: and that exceeding great kindness which shee had for you in that respect; as also upon the account of your owne worth: and that service (by me never to be forgotten) which I owe to her sacred memory, prompted me to some
selves, but by setting the world a better pat∣terne. In the meane time, may the love and faithfulnesse of such a Wife, and her Exem∣plary goodness towards others, but especial∣ly her piety towards GOD, make such deep impressions in your selfe, as that you may really endeavour again to see and enjoy her in that place of blisse, where they neither mar∣ry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the Angels of God in heaven. Which shall alwayes be the prayer of
Sir
