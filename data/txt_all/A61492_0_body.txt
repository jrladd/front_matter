SIR,
I Should be too unreasonable, by a
tedious Epistle, to divert you
from those more weighty and serious
Affairs wherein the greatest and most
Eminent Wits of the Nation have

thought you worthy to be employ'd,
but that I find a mean nonsensical
Preface over a Glass of Wine, with∣out
Purging or Blooding, is not suf∣ficient
to Commend so Illaborate a
Piece, without a Dedication.
Not that I am so much an Ape
to follow the Fashion for any Fools
humonr, tho' it has been done long
before me in the State of Ignorance,
or, as the Author calls it, Inno∣cence,
or that I am affected with a
gaudy Frontispiece to a mean Build∣ing,
like a Close-stool with a Vel∣vet

Seat larger than the Pan that
receives the Excrement, or a gawdy
Miss in fine Cloaths, whose Out-side
is of greater value with the Brokers
than the whole Body: But that I
doubt so inconsiderable a piece of
Paper-work against the loud, robu∣stious
Wits, will hardly be able to
withstand the Storm without a Snp∣porter.
And since I must have a Patron,
to whom can I better Address my
self than to one who for his singular
Endowments and Eminent Qualifi∣cations,

is not only of sufficient Abi∣lities
himself, but hath (as he just∣ly
merits) the whole Strength of
the Nation for his Support.
Besides, were I not obliged, on
the account of your extraordinary
Bounty, who have from time to time
so plentifully stored me with all the
Rubbish of the Age, to give you
the Tribute of my mean Talent, I
ought in Civility to beg your Par∣don
for Monopolizing upon your
property, besides your Apology to
all our Friends for the Errata's of

the Press, which you would not for∣give
the meanest Hackney without
a Broad-side of Curses.
I must confess they are your
Right, and you might have made
that Advantage of them in single
Sheets, which I never expected to
make of the Impression.
But I hope you, whom the wiser
Fundaments have thought fit to
make their Scavenger, will not leave
this sudden motion a Nusance to the
vulgar Multitude, but preserve it

from their Violence, till, like the rest
of your former Collections, it comes
to the best hands, and if it serves
them in its proper Vse, it shall be ac∣knowledged
a Favour beyond the
Merit of
