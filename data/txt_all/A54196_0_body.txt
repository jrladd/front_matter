Reader,
BY this short Ensing
Treatise, 
perceive the Subject, of it,
viz. The Light of Christ
in Man, as the Manifesta∣tion
of Gods Love, for
Mans Happiness. Now,
for as much as this is the

Peculiar Testimony and
Characteristick of the Peo∣ple
called Quakers; their
great Fundamental in Re∣ligion:
That by which they
have been distinguished
from other Professors of
Christianity, in their Time,
and to which they refer all
People about Faith, Wor∣ship,
and Practice, both
in their Ministry and Wri∣tings:
That as the Fingers
shute out of the Hand, and
the Branches from the Bo∣dy
of the Tree, so, true Re∣ligion,

in all the Parts and
Articles of it, Springs
from this Divine Princi∣ple
in Man: And because
the Prejudices of some are
very great against this Peo∣ple
and their Way; and that
others, who Love their Se∣riousness
and commend their
good Life, are yet, through
Mistakes, or want of Inqui∣ry,
under Jealousie of their
Vnsoundness in some Points
of Faith; and that there
are not a few in all Perswa∣sions
which desire earnestly

to know and enjoy God in
that sensible Manner this
People speak of, and who
seem to long after a State of
Holiness and Acceptance
with God; but are under
Doubts and Dispondings of
attaining it, from the want
they find in themselves of in∣ward
Power to enable them,
and are unacquainted with
this Efficacious Agent,
which God hath given and
appointed for their Supply▪
For these Reasons and
Motives know, Reader, I

and so often trod upon and
treated as the Off-scour∣ing
of the Earth, are the
People of God, and Chil∣dren
of the most High.
Bear with me Reader, I
know what I say, and am
not high minded but fear.
For I write with Humi∣lity
towards God, though
with Confidence towards
thee. Not that thou shouldst
believe upon my Authority
nothing less, for that's not
Act upon Knowledge but
Trust: But that thou

shouldst try and prove what I
write: For that is all I
ask, as well as all I need,
for thy Conviction and my
own Justification: The
whole, indeed, being but a
spiritual Experiment upon
the Soul, and therefore seeks
for no implicite Credit, be∣cause
it is Self-evident to
them that will uprightly try
it.
And when thou, Rea∣der,
shalt come to be ac∣quainted
with this Princi∣ple,
and the plain and hap∣py

Teachings of it, thou
wilt, with us, admire thou
shouldst live so long a Stran∣ger
to that which was so
near thee, and as much won∣der
that other Folks should
be so blind as not to see it,
as formerly thou thoughtest
us singular for obeying it.
The Day, I believe, is at
hand, that will declare this
with an uncontroulable Au∣thority,
because it will be
with an unquestionable E∣vidence.
I have done, Reader,

with this Preface, when I
have told thee. First, That
I have stated the Principle,
and opened, as God has en∣abled
me, the Nature and
Virtue of it in Religion:
Wherein the common Do∣ctrines
and Articles of the
Christian Religion, are deli∣vered
and improved; and in
which, I have endeavoured
to express my self in Plain
and Proper Terms, and not
in Figurative, Allegorical,
or Doubtful Phrases; that
so I may leave no room for

an Equivocal or Double
Sence; but that the Truth
of the Subject I treat upon,
may appear Easily and Evi∣dently
to every common
Vnderstanding. Next, I
have confirmed what I have
writ, by Scripture, Reason
and the Effects of it, upon
so great a People; whose
uniform, concurrence in the
Experience and Practice
thereof, through all Times
and Sufferings, since a Peo∣ple,
challenge the Notice
and Regard of every serious

Reader. Thirdly, I have
written briefly, that so it
might be every ones Mony
and Reading: And, much
in a little is best, when
we see daily that the Richer
People grow, the less Mo∣ny
or Time they have for
God, and Religion: And
perhaps, those that would not
buy a large Book, may find
in their Hearts to give a∣way
some of these, for their
Neighbours Good, being
little and Cheap. Be seri∣ous,
Reader, be Impartial

and then be as Inquisitive
as thou canst; and that
for thine own Soul, as
well as the Credit of this
most misunderstood and a∣bused
People: And the
God and Father of Lights
and Spirits, so bless thine,
in the Perusal of this
short Treatise, that thou
mayst receive real Benefit
by it, to his Glory and
thine own Comfort: Which
is the Desire and End of
him that wrote it; who is,

in the Bonds of Chri∣stian
Charity, very much
and very ardently
