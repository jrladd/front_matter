VOuchsafe my good Lord, to patronage this small Treatise of the Re∣demption of lost
Time, which heere I present vnto your Honor (as an vn∣doubted token of my dutifull affection to∣wards you) not pre∣suming thereby to instruct your Lo. in any thing you lear∣ned not before, being a Person wel known to haue deepe insight in the due value and
worth of TIME, and wisely to vnderstand how to estimate, im∣ploy and diuide the same, rendring to euery action his due Time, and to euery Time, his right fun∣ction: But that vn∣der the shadowe of your wings and pro∣tection, I may bee freed frō that Taxe,
whereof the best Bookes now adayes imprinted cannot e∣scape censure. And verily, if they bee commended whoe bring vs any com∣modities, drugges or delights, fashions or fruits from forraine Countries, how can I be iustly reproued, if after long pursuit
in a strange land, J bring home a dish of rare dainties, profi∣table and necessary, a pretious Iewell ri∣cher then the gold of Ophir, the Re∣demption of lost Time. Thus cea∣sing to interrupte your Honors waigh∣tier businesses, I cō∣mend this vnto your
Lordsh. fauour, and your Lordsh. to the Almightie his pro∣tection.
Londonthe 10. of May. 1608.
