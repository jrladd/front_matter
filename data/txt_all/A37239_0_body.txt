MY LORD,
I Was oblig'd to Your Lord∣ship
for the first sight I had of
this Poem; Your Lordship
was then pleas'd to express some

Commendation of it. Since that
time I have waited an Opportunity
of getting it Publish'd in a more con∣venient
and portable Volume; the
Subject-matter being of that Impor∣tance
to every Person, as requir'd its
being made a Manual for People to
carry about them. Nor can my
Pains and Care herein be unaccepta∣ble
to Your Lordship, who are not
only the Patron of the Muses, but of
Publick Good in all kinds.
The Book has a just Claim to
Your Lordship's Protection, both
for the Solidity of Judgment, and
extraordinary Genius that appear in
it. 'Tis the Portraicture of a Hu∣mane

Soul in the Perfection of its Fa∣culties
and Operations (so far as its
present State is capable of,) which
naturally directed me where I ought
to present it.
But as Justice engag'd me in this
Address, I must upon all Occasions
confess my Obligations to Your
Lordship, and particularly for pla∣cing
me in His Majesty's Service; a
Favour which I had not the Presump∣tion
to seek. I was conscious how
short I came of my Predecessors in
Performances of Wit and Diversion;
and therefore, as the best means I had
of justifying Your Lordship's Kind∣ness,
employ'd my Self in publish∣ing

such Poems as might be useful
in promoting Religion and Morality.
But how little I have consulted my
immediate Interest in so doing, I am
severely sensible. I engaged in the
Service of the Temple at my own
Expence, while Others made their
profitable Markets on the Stage.
This, I confess, may seem im∣proper
in a Dedication, especially
where I have so large a Field of
Panegyrick before me. But Your
Lordship's Character, by Consent of
Mankind, is above all our Encomi∣ums;
and Persons of greatest Worth
and Accomplishments are always
least fond of their own Praises.

I shall therefore only mention the
business of my present Waiting on
Your Lordship. I have here got a
useful Poem Reprinted, and beg to
have it Recommended to every Bo∣dy's
perusal by Your Lordship's
Acceptance of it; desiring only from
its Readers the same Candour Your
Lordship has been pleas'd to use, in
making some Allowances for the time
in which it was written. Nor will
the Author often have Occasion for
Favour; in the main he will need
only to have Justice done him.
But I will not forestal the business
of the ensuing Preface, written by an
Ingenious and Learned Divine; who

has both done Right to the great
Manes of the Author, and made some
Amends for this Unpolish'd Address
from me, who am only Ambitious of
professing my self with utmost Zeal
and Gratitude,
MY LORD,
