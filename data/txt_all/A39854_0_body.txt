My Lords,
THE Sermon which I had the Ho∣nour to Preach at the Consecration of Your Lordships, I do now Publish, in hopes that it may give a little Satisfaction to some mistaken People, who may happen to read it; and I dedicate it to Your Lordships, in hopes that Your Lordships will demonstrate, that that is feasible which I say will be expected
from, and that that Respect is deserved by, which I say is due to, those of Your Lord∣ships Order.
