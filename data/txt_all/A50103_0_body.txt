MY LORD,
IT was with no great confidence that I appeared before such an Awful As∣sembly of the Reverend Judges and the Chief Magistrates of this City; nor is it without some uneasie reluctance, that I now expose this Discourse to so publick a View; but having received Your Lord∣ship's Order, I find it necessary to comply, lest I should seem to dispute your Judgment, or contest your Authority. It was the Sub∣ject, I know, that recommended the Dis∣course; and the favourable acceptance it met with, is an argument of the Excellent Temper of those who approv'd it; and how happy may we not think our selves, when they who Interpret and Administer our Laws, are such Friends to Moderation? I have not design'd in this Discourse to
plead the Cause of any Party, or to deter∣mine any of the Cases of Difference which are among us; but to recommend that Mo∣deration which all Parties want, and which would be the shortest and surest Ex∣pedient for composing all our Differences. I must expect that they who have not this good Temper, will be angry with Me, as they are with one another; but whatever they may object, I am conscious of no other Design in this Discourse, but to promote Religion, and the Publick Good of the Church and Nation, to which I am rela∣ted. May Your Lordship continue, by Your good Conduct and Example, to in∣crease and encourage this Moderation a∣mong us; and if this Discourse can contribute any thing thereto, it will much rejoice,
MY LORD,
