Right Worshipfull,
I Remember how Noahs Dove (after some longer stay then was expected) returned at length unto the Arke from whence shee was sent with a branch of Olive in her mouth. Your worthy Family was the Arke out of which J was sent into these farther parts of Essex; and thus long have J beene abroad, ere J could finde out an Olive-branch fit to present you with at my returne; such as it is, I beseech you take it in good part, and let it finde (as the Authour

hath done) favour and acceptance at your hands. And the God of peace lengthen your tranquilitie, and continue to preserve your house and family, that it may ever remaine as an Happie Arke wherein both you and yours may successively bee saved,
