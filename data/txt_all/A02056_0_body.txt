AS I had conference with my self, right honourable and worshipfull, of the great vtilitie, delectation and estimation, procured to euery Commonweale, by the sciences Mathe∣maticall, and how muche more vnto those coū¦tries, wherein knowledge and vnderstādyng of the saied sciences doeth florishe & abounde ouer and aboue other the same wātyng. And also notyng the diligence of sondrie authors of moste Nations in their vulgare langua∣ges in writyng of the premises, to profite their countries. I of good will not inferiour
 to any other, to profite the Commonweale, whereof I am a member, so farre forthe as with moste diligence and vnderstandyng, by the goodnes of God I might haue habilitie: I was moued thereby to employe some en∣deuour, wherein my good will in part might appeare, treatyng of the premisses, not with∣out greate hope to preferre many thynges, in euery of the saied Sciences, as maie bee founde of rare and commodious effecte, for moste vocations and degrees of people. And for that Arithmetique is the grounde, direc∣tion, and producer of the moste parte of suche Haruest, as in the fertile fieldes of the saied sciences is to bee reaped. I haue therefore framed this rude discourse of the Arte of numberyng, the first fruites of my good wil, dedicated to your wisedomes, containyng as well the sondrie partes of the saied science, in whole and broken Numbers, the same ap∣pliyng to seuerall vses, for furtheraunce of common vtilitie, as also many and sonderie Rules of breuetie of woorke, no lesse profita∣ble, then rare to bee seen in any authour, En∣glishe or other. Besechyng your wisedomes, to haue more regarde to my good meanyng herein, then either to my boldnesse, or rude
 order in penning of the same: & as the effecte of my diligence, may procure cōtentation, or benefite to any vocation in the cōmonweale, so I maie haue cause, not onely to reioyce of my trauaile, but also incouraged to further other workes of greater consequence, there∣in assisted by the goodnes of ye almighty, who increase your honour and worshippes with grace, wisedome, and god∣lie felicitie.
