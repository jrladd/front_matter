SIR,
IN those happie daies, while
yet Apollo's Tree (as a
preservative against the
wrath of Heav'n) flourisht
at everie noble Patriot's
Gate: your careless eie by
chance surpriz'd a Virgin scarcely drest, Poor

Astraea, whose Tongue and Habit I had fa∣shion'd
to our use; by Her Access to your
Protection, pretending to have won fair shel∣ter
from the blasts of Critick Tongues; and
as the Right of my Respects, to have tender'd
unto you, My Lord, the first fruits of my
Pen; but e're her Pastoral Reed could vent
her humble strains, 'twas silence't by the cla∣mours
of the Drum. My Designs are the
same they were, my Lord; the Subject's
onely changed with the Times, which (since
most Pens were fashion'd by the Sword)
Weight want's not in the Election; In which
regard, my Lord, by chance This falling
to my hand, I have adventur'd to prefer to
yours. Although perhaps the Character there∣of
would in a vulgar eie scarcelie win Credit
to move Acceptance or Perusal; A Piece so
Antick, ev'n worn out of use. And truly had
I as slightly it perus'd; I should in my Judg∣ment
have blemisht your esteem, and in your

Judgment forfeited my Own, to have presum'd
to give it so eminent an Introductor, as your
Self; The publick Oracle to whom all Doubts
appeal: But finding so large a Catalogue of
the choisest Autors of everie Age, becom Inter∣preters
to This (though I confess but slight
Expositors) It added yet new Fervor to my
Will, to make This your Divertisement, the
onelie Object of my Industrie, wherein I hope
the Errors you shall finde will meet a favoring
Censure, when you, My Lord, are pleas'd to
weigh the varietie of the Subject, not abso∣lutelie
scrutable; The Troubles of the Times
in which it formed was; and the Integritie of
His Passion to your Interests; who is
My Lord
