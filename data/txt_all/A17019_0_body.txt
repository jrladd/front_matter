MOST GRATIOVS QVEENE.
RIght noble, and other worthy La∣dies; as by place of dignitie you are honorable in this world, and ho∣nour is that which many of you e∣nough, if not to much, affect to haue: and being had, continue as careful to encrease, and feareful not to loase it: So seeing you consist (as al men and women doe) of two portions: the cheif and best by nature immortal, and the other, after a short life and death, to be cloathed with immortalitie; and al ho∣nors, and pleasures here, be fading & mortal, and no obiects of delight for creatures immortal: It is wisdome in time, for al that loue and desire honor, to prouide how to ioyne honor & im∣mortality together: for most sure it is,

that both you, and al humane kinde shal be immortal, and if we seeke not here for a better honour then this which is mortal, we shal remaine with∣out honour, and be in dishonour for euer. And al who haue or claime title vnto honour, must also render true and due honour to euerie one more honou∣rable in degree. For, to render honour is the vrgent and bynding law of God, Nature, and Nations.
But they which be often honourable in this world, are not alwaies so strictly bound for accepting or seeking honour. And because I do not doubt, but ma∣nie, or most of you, are expert enough in the second case of admitting honour vnto your sues, and as negligent, or ignorant in the former, so generally commanding precept of performing honour, office, and dutie: I haue (to condemne ignorance, wilfulnes, and al vaine euasions) perused the bookes of armorie, of the best and most anutient Heraldes, in the Religion of Christ: next vnder him his holie Apostles, their happie successors, the practises of A∣postolick

and al Churches, with the learned vertuous Fathers of this sacred Primatiue vnspotted Church, of the first, second, third, fourth, fift, and none after the sixt hundred yeare after Christ: and out of them gathered to∣gether, and set downe in this breife Summarie of true honour: To whom, when, where, how, and what honour, these most diuine and honourable persons, yelded vnto others: nor by anie pri∣uate inference or exposition of mine owne, but in the very wordes & prai∣ers them selues, without anie sillable added, or altered; by which those ho∣lie Churches & Fathers, publikly pro∣fessed and proposed to al posterities, that inward faith which they beleued; and also, that office, dutie, and ho∣nor, which they and al good Christiās owe, and ought to render. That ex∣cept anie men or women, naming them selues Christians, wil be so impious An¦tichristians, to condemne these most holie guides, and Pastors in the king∣dome of Christ, and now by these pro∣fessions of their faith, & performinges of dutie and honour, glorious and hap∣pie

Sainctes in heauen, and our most B. Sauiour & Redemer him self, Christ Iesus, to be a seducer: the cheifest con∣trouersies of this time in Religion, be∣ing in this short Treatise, by these in∣uincible Argumentes and authorities demonstratiuely proued, made euident, and adiudged, for the most sacred doc∣trine of the present Romane Church, wil haue an end: the wilful and obsti∣nate inuincibly refuted, the ignorant truly instructed, the vniustly persecu∣ted truly rewarded and pitied, most sa∣cred preisthood and Sacrifice, by many so prophanly vsed, wil here thus pro∣ued appeare most reuerent, holy, and glorious. To be breife, what homage, honour, dutie, loue, pitie, compassion, or releife we owe, and must render, to the Church Triumphant, Militant, or patient, that we may truly, with the o∣ther Articles of our holie Creede, be∣leue and confesse the holie Catholicke Church, the Communion of Sainctes: they are here thus manifestly and vndeniably determined: and al cheifest matters now called into question, so decided. Diuers praiers of this subiect, I haue

wholly here omitted, being alreadie lately published in my Manual of Me∣ditations and Prayers. And in some few Cōtrouersies (though of least momēt) because their praiers do not belong to al estates for which this booke is pu∣blished, I haue bene silent. The cause why I principally dedicate it to you, is not to make you patrons of the prai∣ers of Sainctes, and their holie faith, but to make them Patrones vnto you: not to constitute you Iudges of the ho∣nour which is due to the High Queene and Ladie in Heauen, but to make you ladies there: nor to make your vn∣learned sexe vmpeare ouer the whole Church of God, but to procure you to be true members of that holie com∣panie, forth of which there is no salua∣tion; not because I woud exclude your Lordes, whom I duly honour, but to haue it presented to them by you, and you in knowing, and performing the true honours and duties here remem∣bred, to be more honourable both to them and others; and them, by this and your example, to learne and do the ho∣nours and duties they owe to others.

Neither do I omitte the inferiour of your kind, to be grateful vnto you, (though the vertuous among you, I honour with double honour) that liue in state. But because vertue or vice, is often learned from the higher, I wish you the first, and you therin to be imitated, and made a Rule. And so in al dutie I shal euer rest
