To the Right Honorable, KATHERINE Countess of PEMBROKE, &c. Together with her truly Noble Sister, THE LADY MARY SOANDES; As dear in affection, as near in blood; The Ornament of their Sex and Name.
AND To the true Exemplars of Piety, Honor, and Faithfulness; whether of Nobility, Gentry, Ministry, or Citizens; Late Auditors and Communicants, at the preaching of the Word, and ministration of the Eucharist, At S. PETERS.
Robert Mossom Dedicates the ensuing MEDITATIONS: which, conceiv'd in the Closet, have had their Birth from the Pulpit; and being now grown up to the Press, they take heart to travel the World under so just a Patronage and Protection.
AND The same holy Spirit of Truth, which accompanied them to the ear and the heart of each reverent Auditor; bless them also to the eye and the soul of every ingenuous Reader: For a sustaining with grace in the present Warfare; and a crowning with glory in the future Triumph of Christs holy Church. Amen.
