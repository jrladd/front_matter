WORTHY SIR
SINCE the time that it first pleased your honourable Fa∣ther to commend you vnto the
 religious government of this Colledge, wherein you now liue, your carriage hath beene so sweete & louely, that it hath wonne, I dare say, the heart of each member thereof to a rea∣dinesse of respecting this your goodnesse, as in word so in deede, according to their seve∣rall places and dignities. Nei∣ther could I suffer my selfe, standing in a more neare rela∣tion than any of the rest vnto you, to come short in the per∣formance of this office; Where∣fore I here offer vnto your re∣ligious meditation this ensu∣ing treatise, collected and com∣posed
 first for private vse, but now published; not to gaine the applause of any (from which my owne vnworthinesse sufficiently checkes mee) but chiefely for these two respects; first to testifie that loue, which I both owe vnto you and am ready to make good; Secondly and more principally to invite you to a due consideration of those holy duties therein con∣tayned, that by a seasonable knowledge of the same your actions may bee the more carefully ordered, and God's name in the faithfull practise thereof more fully glorified.
 The subiect is a matter not of humane learning, but of God's service; and thereof a parte, without exception, the grea∣test; the due receiving of the holy Communion. A duty, I confesse, better knowne, then well considered; and more of∣ten thought on, then sincere∣ly practis'd: if it were not so, bad actions would not bee so commonly priviledg'd by the greatnesse of the Agents, as now they are; but they to whom God hath giuen most honour here, would ever thinke it their greatest glory to honour him most again by their faith∣full
 service vnto him. And good reason why they should, if they remember that to whom God hath given most, of them hee requireth most a∣gaine; yea such, who haue the precedency of others in place and dignity, may do well to consider, that, in making a conscience of matters of Reli∣gion and leading their liues according to the rules thereof, they doe not onely provide well for the salvation of their owne soules, but giue a good occasi∣on to others also, while they happily provoke them to the practise of the same duties by
 their good examples: which are ever held as liuely pre∣cepts, and serue for a secret reproofe to an ingenuous in∣feriour, when hee shall see him∣selfe defectiue in that, where∣in his betters haue gone be∣fore him. Let the Honou∣rable & Mighty thus remem∣ber how farre they shall ho∣nour God by a religious life, and then they cannot but ac∣knowledge that it is their glo∣rious fredome to bee his hum∣ble Servants. Others, if they please, may take notice of this perswasion; and perhaps they would, if I were not vnwor∣thy
 to advise them: but now I speake to you alone, whom I well knowe willing, as freely to make vse of others helpe, so truely to accept of this from mee. Your owne happinesse you must confesse, with thanks to God, that by his providence you liue in that Society, whose Religion is as firme as vndefi∣led; where you cannot say you want the rule either of louing precepts or exanple; according vnto which you haue already ioyned with the rest in a reli∣gious communicating at the Lords Table. My desire is to perswade you to a constant
 perseverance in what you haue so well begunne; that so devo∣ting your tender yeares, with those which follow vnto the service of th' Almighty, you may againe from him receiue and fully enioy his dayly bles∣sing, which doth ever attend on those that truely seeke him. Some meditations which perhaps may serue for your direction, I here present vnto your view; in which I free∣ly acknowledge almost nothing mine (to prevent the censure of a curious Reader) but onely the labour of composing;
 this I now commend to you, and you vnto the blessed pro∣vidence of the most Highest re∣sting ever
