TO make triuiall Apologies for publishing
bookes in these times, were idle, since the rea∣sons
some alleage for their defence therein,
are common, and ouer-worne. And there∣fore
if I should with others vrge the earnest
entreatieo, friends for a coppie of this Sermon, as a reason for
publishing thereof, rather then the expresse commandement of
some which haue authoritie therein, and vnto whom I am most
obliged in all dutie; I could not bee free from such suspition
also. In which respect, since as it was preached, so being now
published (as both my dutie and loue bindeth mee) I present
it vnto your Lordship with all due respect. Humbly desiring,
that (as vnto my vnworthy selfe, so also vnto this) you would
bee pleased to vouchsafe your Patronage: If not; your par∣don.
But howsoeuer, I hope your acceptance, since I offer it
with a truely deuoted loue I beare towards your Lordship in all
dutie. And so addressing still my praiers vnto God, for your
Lordships long health aud prosperitie, Irest
