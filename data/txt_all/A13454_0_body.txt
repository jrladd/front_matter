TO thee I consecrate these mourning lines
Of Royall Henries sad vntimely hearse,
For want of whom this Kingdom weeps & pines,
With sighs and grones and eye-bedewing verse:
I know his losse thy manly heart did pearce,
And mongst thy woes, this woe exceeds the worst:
I know thou rather had'st (death's Iaueline fierce)
To saue his life, thy loyall heart had burst.
But tis our fortunes and our fates accurst,
Amid'st these daies of sorrow to suruiue;
And lifes vnpermanent all trustles trust
Is fled from him who kept our hopes aliue:
But let sweet patience subiugate your sorrow
A heauy eu'ning brings a ioyfull morrow.

Your Worships euer most obseqiuous.
