MADAM,
THe worthy Author giving me the view of this Translation in Paris, at my comming from thence I begged a cop∣pie, which he was pleased to bestow: and as he performed the work for his private use and re∣creation, and after dedicated it to his vertuous Mother the Lady Digby: So I, who have no other share then the conveying it to be printed for the publique good, do offer up my little in∣dustrie therein to your La: Yet not for this on∣ly, but that indeed I willingly take occasion to tell the world, how much my Lady Winter is esteemed and valued by her faithfull Friend, and Kinsman,
