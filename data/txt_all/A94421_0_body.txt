Honoured Sir,
THat which (for the most part) em∣boldeneth men, to dedicate their La∣bours unto any Personage, is the affi∣nity between the matter of the Work which they present, and the Mind of him to whom it is presented. I have here swerved from this custom, being altogether too weak to present you with a Work, sutable to your far more excel∣lent parts: Yet when I considered my Design, viz. to serve my Countrey, and to instruct the un∣learned, in this so excellent and necessary a Sci∣ence; I thought none so fit to patronize and en∣courage
 a piece of this nature, than one who hear∣tily desires the publique good; which publique Spirit, and charitable Principle, I have (in a more than ordinary manner) observed in you; and your poor Neighbours (to their comfort) are daily sensible of. Sir, I need not tell you, how useful, a subject of this nature, may prove to the Commonalty, whose ignorance of their own condition, whilest they are sick, and want of strength of body or purse, to confer with a Physi∣tian, proves fatal to many a poor Christian in this Nation. I shall leave this to the considera∣tion of the Reader, and humbly crave your fa∣vourable acceptance, of these my weak endea∣vours, and First-Fruits of my few years hard study: Which if I obtain; my Book, though a Stripling, and very impotent of it self; yet under your favourable protection, I am confident, will manfully obvert and defend it self against the venemous Bitings of Slanderous Tongues, from which it must expect not a little opposition. I hope, nay confidently believe that this poor Infant, though but meanly clad, will find your encourage∣ment, being an honest mans Child, no Vagrant. I beseech you, Sir, excuse my confidence, who dare thus rush into your presence; and demand, without any merit of my own, your favourable protection.

But it is your good Nature, of which I am an Admirer, that hath so far emboldened me. Had Nature been more liberal to me in Expressions, or had tipt my Tongue with Eloquence; yet I durst not make use of it to you, for I know you delight not in it; nor is my self therewith affe∣cted: Therefore, in all humility, sincerity, and plain Language, I subscribe my self,
