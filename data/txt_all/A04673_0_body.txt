FAyre louely Ladie, vvhose Angelique eyes
Are Uestall Candles of sweet Beauties Treasure,
Whose speech is able to inchaunt the wise,
Conuerting Ioy to Paine, and Paine to Pleasure;
Accept this simple Toy of my Soules Dutie,
Which I present vnto thy matchles Beautie.


And albeit the gift be all too meane,
Too meane an Offring for thine Iuorie Shrine;
Yet must thy Beautie my iust blame susteane,
Since it is mortall, but thy selfe diuine.
Then (Noble Ladie) take in gentle vvorth,
This new-borne Babe which here my Muse brings forth.
