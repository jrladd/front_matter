THe learned (right Ho∣norable and my verye good Lord) haue alwaies in their account and re∣gister of morall vertues, assigned a certaine prerogatiue of excellency in one more then in an other; not for that they deemed the troupe of ver∣tues (being in thē-selues simply con∣sidered) to surmount one another in singularity, al being per∣fectly good, and mutually combined together, but in respect of some generall benefit and publique commoditie, accrew∣ing & issuing from some one, more then from an other. And in this respect haue they dignified and priuiledged Iustice with this honourable tytle, tearming her: The soueraigne Queene and chiefe Ladye and Mistresse of all vertues, be∣cause she not only is a vertue, in each degree perfect with the rest, but also for that (besides her other offices, partes and eff∣ects) she is distributiue, yelding vnto euery one, that which in right is due there-vnto: wherein she sheweth her selfe publiquelye beneficiall to all Countryes, States and cōmon∣weales, where she is had in price, reuerence, regard & honour,

and where she i fostred, vpholden, maintained & cherished.
Which assrt on being granted (as it cānot but be true) me thinks there is great reason offred & ministred to prefer Hy∣dographe or Nauigation before any other arte or science, not so much for that it iumpeth in equalitie, and matcheth in singularitie any other whatsoeuer, in sundrie subtill de∣uises and ingenious inuentions, with the vse of manye nota∣ble instruments, as Compasses, Astrolabes, Plats, Quadrants & many other appendances incident to the same, as cheefly for the greate and pulike commoditie in generall, redoun∣ding (by the vse & practise thereof) to the whole bodie of the common wealth, and each particular member in the same.
The fist inuention whereof, furthered with the artificiall aide of many a hiddē, strange, & almost supernatural deuice since added to the same by the studious trauailer & industri∣ous Mchanician: he yt wold throughly cōsider, shold finde matter rather miraculous to wōder at, thē to be thought com∣passable with the reach of humaine brain or penetrable to the capacitie of a fraile silly worldling: yea he may herin as it were in a mirrour, beholde and see the inestimable bounty and infinite goodnes of the Lord, who of an especial loue & purposed good wil, which in his secret wisdōe he had deter∣mined for the maintenance & reliefe of humain society, hath from aboue infused this so excellent a skil & knowledge in to the mindes of men, onely thereby to haue his wonderfull workes euerie where knowne, his praises resounded, and his holy name from one generation to an other glorified.
By this art we inioy by participation such commodities as grow in other Regions & haue the same plentifully brought home to our doors by exchāge & entercourse of such wares as we (euen in superfluous measure) possesse within our own countrie: by it we see & learne the cituation, natures, custō & dealings of other countries, by mutall traffique, bartering with them, & enterchāgeably giuing & taking by exchāge one commodity for an other, wherby the neede that one mā

hath of an other, more cleerely appeereth: and therby is socie∣te the more willinglye embraced & brothely, frequented. By it many a poore commoner labouring about these commodi∣ties is relieued, and many housholde from pine preserued: by it the Marner is maintained, whose seruice n al marine exploits stādeth the Prince in special steed. To be short, by it is the Na∣uy Royal furnished, the Realme fortified, & the cōmon wealth inriched. Is it possible therefore that there can be any so vnna∣turall to his countrie, or so iniurious to himselfe, that without blushing face cā say, he is not maintained or at least not great∣lye furthered (if not wholye and intirely, yet in great parte and quantitie) by Nauigation? Truely I thinke none. And if any should bee so fond or vndescreet, his absurde opinon would soone be discouered, and the in conueniences or rather mischeefes wherein we should bee so soone enwrapped, would quickly fal vpon vs, if God in his wrath and iustice for our vn∣thankfulnes should stay the vse therof, wherunto we are moste humbly still to beseech him in mercie to graunt continuance.
These so many, so necessarie, and so profitble vses of Na∣uigation, aduauncing the honor of our countrie, and increa∣sing the wealth of the same, haue enforced mee in discharge of some part of my duety to my natiue soile & Region, & the ra∣ther because of my profession, to further the same with this small worke translated out of Duth, containing the gatherings of diuers experimented men, necessarie to be knowne and ob∣serued in or common Nauigation: as Tides, Depthes, Soun∣dings, Marks & Sandes, with the rising of sundrie lands which by no Chart or Plat is expressed or knowne, but rsteth onely vpon the relation of the experimented Traueller.
All which being finished & ccording to my slender skill ended, I am the bolde (being therunto by duety boū, to pre∣sent vnto your honour as a pledge or token of my thankfull heart for the manifolde beefis and nole ncouragementes whih to my great comfort I hue contiualy son in your ordship towards me, eseching you hoo to  ro∣tect

the same, as the poore labours of him, who in all points of loyall dutye acknowledgeth himselfe your Honours moste bounden suppliant and seruant. For although the worke bee intituled. A Safe-gard for Saylers, yet so small is the force of a litte paper in this our dainty age, that it is not able to defend or shift for it selfe, much lesse to be a safe-gard to others, except your honor according to your accustomed goodnes and won∣ted generositie, persist & still remaine as a Bul-warke both vn∣to it, and the Marine Coates, who continuallye pray for your Lordships daylie increase of Honor in this life, and after your mortall race heere (heroically runne) a place among the elect of God in the heauenly Hierar∣chie.
