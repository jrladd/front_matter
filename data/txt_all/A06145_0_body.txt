ALexander the great (most noble and vertuous Queene) rebuked Aristotle the Philosopher, for that he read in A∣thens cōmonto his Peripatetians, which was peculiar to Princes: such is the state and dignity of a king, that the same Alex. commanded, that none should set him in collours but Apelles, nor in metals but Lysippus,
I had not attempted (most soueraigne Lady) to intreat of sacred Princes, to write of their natiuities, inaugura∣tions, coronations and annointings: of their feasts, tri∣umphes, vowes, sacrifices, with other pompe & solemp∣nitie therunto belonging, thinges far beyond my reach, had not 3. seueral most iust causes moued me therunto.
The first, the day of your Maiest. birth The 2. the day of your Highnesse cōming to the kingdome, And the 3. the day that your Highnes was crowned Queene of England, three most happy, ioyful & triumphant daies to England: through the which; we triumphed 2029. daies with triumphs of Ouation: the ioies whereof for∣ced me most hūblyto present this to your Maiestie, tru∣sting that your Highnesse wil so accept of a Britane for Brutus sake, as Artaxerxes the great, accepted of the poore Persean Sinaetes, a glasse of water of the riuer Cyrus, for Cyrus sake, In maximis enim voluisse sat est.
Your Maiesties most humble and obedient seruant
