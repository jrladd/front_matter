IF I had not observed that
the greatest humilitie,
reigns in the bosoms of
the Noblest Persona∣ges,
I should not presume to Dedi∣cate
this most unworthie Fabrick to
your Honours; especially when I
consider the poorness of my endea∣vours,

and admire the Learned Sid∣ney's
Pastimes; Whereof I beseech
you charitably to believe, that my
ambition was not raised to so high a
pitch, as the Title now manifests it
to be, until I received Commands
from those that cannot be disobeyed.
But however, if your Ladiships will
graciously vouchsafe to peruse such a
confused Theam, I shall harbour the
better opinion of it, and shall ac∣knowledge
my self, as in all Grate∣fulness,
