Madam,
I Humbly present to your La∣dyship these few Gleanings, which I have gather'd and ty'd up into this
 little Sheaf. I am not asham'd to acknow∣ledge, that much of it is none of my own: In Divinity, all men must be Borrowers; and no man knows more, than what is Reveal'd; the Ambition of Disco∣very, has been one of the chiefest grounds of those many Here∣sies and Schisms, with which the World is at this day over-run, and the Church di∣vided.
 And to me 'tis no great wonder, when men dispute Wisdom with their Maker; when soaring Wits will not stoop and submit to the plain Truths of the Gospel, but think themselves able to cor∣rect Scripture, and find out more New, and Easie wayes to Heaven, than our blessed Saviour, or his Apostles, have ever
 inform'd the World of; that so many Wander, and Miscarry.
You have here, Ma∣dam, set down the thoughts of several Learned Divines, upon the same Subject; Vari∣ous Rules, from di∣vers Hands, directing our Practice; and yet all of them so Weighty, as I doubt not but your Ladyship will confess, few of them could have well
 been omitted: You will find men, of different Opinions here, All consenting to further Holyness of Life.
It is the mischief, Madam, of our Days, that men are too much of a Party in Religion; and regard not so much what is said, as who is the Preacher: So that 'tis as dangerous to quote Charnock, or Owen in the Pulppit
 as Mead, or Sander∣son in a Meeting. This, Madam, is one Reason why I conceal Mens names; that the Reader may be no way byass'd by them: And I have indeavour'd so to mingle different Parties, that 'twill not be very easie to discern the Bishop from the Doctor, or the Coat from the Cassock; that so men, that are set up∣on Quarrels, may Fight
 in the dark, where 'tis odds they mistake their man. And this, Madam, is the only excuse I have, for hi∣ding my self in the Croud of your Admi∣rers; among whom you have not,
Madam,

Covent Garden, Sept. 15. 1683.
