My Lord,
IT is not above a day or two since I thought of recommending this Discourse unto the World under the Patronage of some Great Name; not that I believed it sufficient of it self to walk abroad without such a support, but because I was unwilling to lay the Burden of its faults upon such a one as had not Fame and Re∣putation enough to bear the weight of them; and, on the other hand, I did believe it too great a Crime to charge any person with them, that
had. And had not Your Lordship obliged me so much, as of late you have done, I should not have thought of doing it now, much less of doing it under Yours. Men had need be well assured of the Goodness of those Discourses, which they publish un∣der the Name of some known Friend; because Dedications detract from those, whom they design to Honour, if what is offer'd to the World under their Protection be mean and trifling. But this is not the worst of my case; For though I know Your Lordship by the report of Your Exemplary Pie∣ty and Vertue, yet I am so altoge∣ther unknown to You, that I am a∣shamed to think, that That, which gives a Lustre to Your Goodness, should be an Aggravation of my Crime in defaming Your Judgment so publickly; and that too, while I tell the World I am bound in Grati∣tude to confult Your Honour.

The Subject, My Lord, I here pre∣sent You with, is great and worthy the most serious Consideration of e∣very Christian: For it sets before us the Glad-tidings of the Gospel, and the indispensible Necessity of a Holy Life. Two things of that vast mo∣ment, that were they well consider'd, it would not be a very easie thing for Men to do themselves so much mis∣chief, as to forfeit their Hopes of an Immortal Life merely for the sake of a Bodily Lust, when they judge it a hardship upon us to be condemn'd to a Mortal condition for Adam's fault. And though I know my own Defects too well, to believe I can write any thing upon a Subject of so lofty a Nature suitable to the Dignity of it; yet if it will but contribute any thing towards the awakening Men to a sense of that Obligation to Holiness, that our Religion, by acquainting us with the ground of that Hope, we are be∣gotten
to, lets us know we are under, I shall presume upon Your Lordship's known Goodness for a Pardon for the weakness of my Performance: And the World I hope will believe, that at least I meant well, when I ventured this way to own my self
