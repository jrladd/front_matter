IT is ordinary with Writers in their Dedi∣catory Epistles, highly to extoll and com∣mend the Persons and Vertues of those, to whom they Dedicate their Books; for the most part little heeding, whether the Praises they give them, be just or unjust, deserved or undeserved: And if any one chance to ask the reason, they usually answer, That they Characterize and Paint them out, much like Xenophon his Cyrus; not al∣together such, as they are, but as they should be: As
for my self, I may safely and ingenuously say, that I am very far from these mens courses, or any thing at all, that looketh that way: My main aym hereby, is rather to declare unto others, then to Your Highnesse, the true Motives and Reasons, that induced me to Dedicate this Piece unto Your Highnesse.
The first and chiefest was, for that the Subject of this Treatise, is concerning the Reformation of Abuses, and the Extirpation of Schisms and Heresies, in the Church of God: Now then, Your Highnesse's most Illustrious Predecessors have been the first of all other Princes of Germany, or else where that received the Reformed Religion in the greatest Puritie of it; And not onely so, but who from time to time have been the surest Asylum, and Refuge, to all the Saints of God, that suffered for it, yea and a Terrour also to all such, as persecuted it: And this the great Forces, wherewith so potently they assisted the French, as also the States of the Low-Countreys, so oppressed by those, who so unjustly have oppressed Your Highnesse, manifesteth so abund∣antly, that whoever knoweth it not, must be born, and bred with the Antipodes, and be altogether a Stranger in the whole Christian World. What also those Illustrious Princes of blessed Memory, Your Father, and Grand-Father, did for the old Duke of Bouillion, in all Christian, Civill, and Military Vertues, the very Hero's of His time, I my self and many others, have bin Eye-witnesses. And as for Your Princely Vertues, I know, that Your
Highnesse taketh no pleasure to hear them so highly commended, as they merit; neither is my Pen able to do it; and if I should attempt any such thing, I am assu∣red, I should come as far short, as he, who would go about to Paint the Sun with a Coal: Neverthelesse, this I hold my self bound to say unto the World, That I have heard sundry of the prime men of this Island, both Noblemen, and Ecclesiastiques, yea, those of the most Learned and Godly of them, extoll very Highly Your Princely Vertues; and it is no small praise and commendation to be praised and commended by those, who themselves are so praise worthy and commendable. To whom then should I rather Dedicate this Book, that concerneth Reformation, then to his Highnesse, whose Illustrious Ancestors are so celebrated in all Histories, for promoting of the blessed Work of Re∣formation? And this, as I said before, God knoweth, I say not to flatter Your Highnesse; but to the end, that Your Highnesse having so great and worthy Examples of so Heroick Vertues, and those not far sought, but found at home, you may thereby be encouraged against all difficulties, to go on in that Royall Way, that they have scored out unto you: Your Afflictions verily are great, and such as I cannot think upon, but with a bleeding heart, and that no lesse for our selves, then for Your Highnesse; for alasse! what a check, and affront is this put upon all the Protestant Churches, to
see Him brought so low, whose Predecessors put them so high, even when they were at their lowest ebbe? What a dishonour must it needs be to the three Kingdoms, to see the Kings Majesties Nephew reduced to such an Estate? What serveth our Alliance for? What esteem can For∣raign Nations make of us, who esteem no more our own Blood? Truely, God hath put your greatest Ene∣mies very low; Some also, who formerly have hindered that seasonable Assistance, that we should have afforded you, are now themselves on the suffering hand; And who knoweth, whether this be not one of the present quarrels God hath against us at this time? Oh! that God would pitty us so far, as that we could but once learn to pitty our selves; then might His Majestie be a glorious King; we most happy Subjects; and You, Right Illu∣strious Prince, soon be restored to Your Ancient Sove∣raignties, and Dominions, so long, and so unjustly u∣surped upon You, by Yours, ours, and all Protestant Princes open and professed Enemy: And now it seemeth, that God hath already prepared the way, if we could prepare our selves to enter into it: We see how the Lord hath powred out his vengeance upon the House of Austria, and raised up against it the French, whose Predecessors stand so many wayes obliged to Your Highnesse's House, and that of late memory, yea, in our own times: We have seen heretofore what hath been the King of Denmarks zeal in this Cause; and I doubt not,
but the States of the Low-Countreys would contribute as much, as any other, to put down their Immortall Enemy, and to raise up again their old Confederate, and dearest Friend. If at this present, when other Princes are in Arms one against another, we could serve our selves of such an occasion, to make a Peace here at home, we might easily procure an happy Agreement amongst our Friends and Confederates abroad; so we might make our selves no lesse considerable every where, by such a Peace, then now by our Distractions, we are inconsiderable to all the World. But this I leave, and return to Your Highnesse: In a word; my aym in pleading here, for a Reformation, is to let all true Pro∣testants know, how this Dispute is due to Your High∣nesse; and how they stand all bound in Conscience, to take to heart the Cause of such a Prince, whose Ance∣stors were the first Reformed, and truest Reformers, and who Himself, in the midst of so many Temptations, so constantly continueth in their wayes: If they should (which God forbid) forget so great Services, that those never sufficiently commended Princes of Your Illustrious House have done for the Cause of God, they could not but prove very unthankfull, both to God, and to Your Highnesse: And yet in such a case, must not Your Highnesse for all that loose courage; Your Cause is his Cause, who is All-Sufficient; And therefore Your Highnesse will do well to cast Your
Self wholly upon him, attending his good pleasure; and I am assured, that Your deliverance shall come in his good time; which, that he would be pleased to hasten, So prayeth, so hopeth, so earnestly desireth he, who is wholly resolved, in all sincerity, all his life long, to remain
