AS Providence, Right Honourable,
made you Inheretrix of so Princelike
a Mansion, as few of your Sex have
ever been superior therein; so are you
hardly to be parallel'd in those more
estimable possessions treasur'd up in your mind,
being as well familiar with other Tougues, as the
owning Orator of that harmonious Lutetian Lan∣guage,
in the voluble, and elegant pronuntiation
whereof so to be admired, and in all other gifts and
endowments both of body and mind so transcen∣dent,
as if Urania seem'd onely in your person and
presence to erect a second Parnassus for her learned
sisters. But amongst your Honours matchlesse ver∣tues,
that of your Modesty, together with my owne
insufficiency, would disallow the expatiating in a
Panegyricall addresse; I shall therefore decline fur∣ther
prayses, which not to seeme flatteries where
you are not knowne, would doubtlesse be thought
detractions where you are. An obligation (most Ho∣nour'd
Madam) under which a great and undeserved
favour from your honour, having brought mee long
since, (not only after my septennian travels, and re∣turne
into the Land of my nativity) in then admit∣ting
mee a servant in your most Noble Family and

House of Kinsington, but also commending mee af∣terward
as Secretary to King James (of Famous
Memory) his Embassadour. And therefore being
ignorant how I might give testimony of my boun∣den
duty, I took upon mee the boldnesse to devote
these few lines, onely to manifest I had a desire
(though unable) to make expressions of a due en∣gagement,
and so be delivered of that most pregnant
conception of my devoted service; not doubting but
as the Persian Monarch kindly accepted the poore
mans handfull of water, so your Honour will likewise
admit this mite into the treasury of your Noble ac∣ceptation.
As it hath pleased our Gracious God to
give you patience (that precious and powerfull Pa∣noplie)
in all troubles, not onely in the most injuri∣ous
deprivation of goods and lands, but also in the
Martyrdome of the nearest relation: so that there
may be, as with holy Job, a double restitution; as also
that all the blessings on mount Gerizim in this life,
and in the next all the blessings that Christ preached
on the Mount, may be multiplyed in your Honou∣rable
Person and Posterity, shall be the daily prayers
of
