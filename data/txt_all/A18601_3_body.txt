SIR,
TO the most Iust, the Bal∣lance; to the most Valiant, the Sword. To whom may this Discourse of Valour be more lawfully dedicated, then to your Maiestie? Kings and People giue Her place. They all with one consent doe giue Her this advantage without enuie, knowing that Shee hath well deserued it. It was dedicated to your Maiestie eleven yeares since; since which time, there hath not one yeare passed, but I haue giuen your Maiestie some thing, and you haue not giuen me any thing. This disproportion did put me backe: your Maiestie hauing done me the honour to say often, That I was one of the olde seruants of her house, and an honest man. At this second Edition I would addresse it to

some other. I looked among Srangers, among : In the ende, I found it behooued not to change the North. Strangers doe atttribute this glory vnto You, to bee the perfect modell of Valour; Your owne doe confesse, that that which they know of this excellent Vertue, hath been learned vnder the lightnings and invinci∣ble force of your Armes: they bee Triumphes vnto them, to haue profited in so famous a Schoole. So I doe cansecrate it to your Maie∣stie, for the second time. The Worlds eyes are vpon your Maiestie for Valour: The World lookes vpon you for Iustice. Men doe attend to see how your Maiestie will effect the solemne Oath you made, to take away the horrible con∣fusion of Quarrels. They hope for the execu∣tion of it, and then the complaint which I make for my particular, (whereof I doe attri∣bute the cause rather to my selfe, then to your inclination, absolutely Royall and Heroicall) and that which Christendom makes for the ge∣nerall, shall be effaced, by the most rare Trophy that euer was erected to any Prince of the earth. Euen as you are the Greatest, I pray God prosper your Maiestie for euer: remayning
SIR,
