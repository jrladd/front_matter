My Lord,
IN making you a Present of the He∣roine Musqueteer, I do but restore you what already belongs to you: Bearn, where she was born, is a Province so sensible of its Real Obli∣gations
to my Lord Marshal, your Father, and You, that the Ho∣nours paid you as Fa∣thers of your Country, exceed those they owe you as Governours of it. The kindness you have for the Province in general, and particu∣larly for those of Bearn, is so well known, that many younger Brothers quit their Fathers Hou∣ses with incredible Con∣fidence,
and run com∣monly into the Armies, without any thing to trust to but your Prote∣ction, which generally proves more useful to them than their Patri∣mony, by your bounty and liberality to such as are in need of it, and the Favours and Imploy∣ments you help them to who deserve it. This, my Lord, gives me hopes you will vouch∣safe
your Protection to a Heroine you have in∣gag'd in the service by the Fame of your Great Actions in Poland, Flanders, Holland, and Germany, which sick∣ness only and infirmities have been able to put a stop to. My interest, (had I no other reasons, would have ingag'd me to pay you this Ho∣mage, the best defence I could provide for my
Book, being the prefix∣ing your Name to it. It belongs properly to the Jurisdiction of the Fair Sex to pass sentence on Works of this Nature; and I have reason to be∣lieve my little Story, ap∣pearing under the Pro∣tection of a Person of your Quality (who are not only the greatest Gallant of the Court, but have the best Meen, and are most in favour
with the Ladies) will be kindly received, as having been written on∣ly for your divertise∣ment, and to give me the occasion of a pub∣lick acknowledgement with what Profound Respect I am,
My Lord,
