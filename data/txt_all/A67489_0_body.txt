SIR,
THose who have done good offices for other men, may forget them if they please; and by how much the less they insist upon them, the greater certainly is their Generosity: But he who hath been on the receiving hand, or any way as∣sisted by the Goodness of another, is bound to preserve the obligations he is under, in everlasting remembrance. Besides, if when opportu∣nity favours him, he do not some way express his Gratitude, and shew at least his willingness to be thankful, he betrays abaseness utter∣ly unworthy of a second Benefactor. Sir, many years ago it was my happiness to have you my Friend; and then I had frequent experi∣ence of a Steadiness and Constancy, a Humility and Integrity, which I have met with but in few of those persons that are of a quality like unto that of yours. You were pleased to do for me more than ever you had made me the promise of, and much more than a man of my slender merit might reasonably expect from you, or any other. These things I have many times delightfully considered of; and since I am not

likely to render you any other compensation or return, I was willing to make you this Address, wherein I might give some publick testi∣mony how sensibly I find my self affected with the memory of your manifold kindness towards me: a great addition to which will be the acceptance of this mean Present which I here lay at your Feet; and then cease to give you a further trouble from
Coventrey:
Iune 17, 1677.
Honourable Sir,
