May it please your Grace,
GRatitude is as essentially necessary to a Poet as wit: For, of all Man∣kind,
they generally share the hardest Fortunes, and were they
not sometimes relieved by the generous Few, might utterly starve
and perish: And since nothing can be expected from them, but the
poor Returns of Thanks, What Monsters were they, should they
neglect the paying so small a Tribute; and how odious must they seem in the
Eyes of all Men, stain'd with Ingratitude: 'Tis with them as with Common
Beggars, where the Donor may rationally demand not only Thanks but Prayers,
he has an unquestionable Right to 'em, and to wrong him of 'em, were as hei∣nous
as picking his Pocket.
I need not tell the World, your Grace has for many years been the best Pa∣tron
of the best Poets, and that your Grace has the largest and truest Soul
of Bounty and Generosity of any Man living, that would be needless; 'tis like
shewing Men the Sun at Noon-Day: Yet I hope I may so far presume upon your
Grace's Modesty, as to say, None has more largely tasted of it than my self: I
will not say, your Grace has fed me upon all Occasions; yet I must declare I
have din'd at your Table when all the world besides have denied me a Morsel of
Bread. But your Grace's Bounty do's not end here; Your Grace has not only
reliev'd the Poets in general, but the best and most learned part of the World
besides; for, not to reckon the vast Shoals of Debtors, Prisoners, Stray-Ap∣prentices,
Bailiffs, Sharpers, Rooks, Pimps, Gamesters, &c. that daily eat of
your Bread and drink of your Drink; a great and vast Number of Divines,
Casuists, Projectors, Painters, Musicians, Rhetoricians, &c. are daily main∣tained
at your Graces Table; and 'tis this thing that singles your Grace out
from the rest of Mankind, and your Grace is more known by your Acts of
Hospitality than ever Alexander the Great was by all his Conquests. The Tables
your Grace do's every Day support and uphold, are almost innumerable; for,
besides the most noted ones in Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Covent-Garden, St. James's
Park, &c. Your Grace has several in Moor-fields, Goodmans-fields, Tower∣hill,
&c. and all so well furnish'd and set out, that your Grace's Bounty
seems as unlimited as the Sun; and if so, how impossible is it for us to be fuf∣ficiently
thankful.
May it please your Grace, then to accept this poor Trifle, a an hearty Ac∣knowledgement
of the Author, for the many Favours your Grace has bestow'd
upon him, and may your Grace live long and flourish, for the Support of all
decay'd Persons, and particularly, of the sading Sons of the Muses, is, and
ever shall be the hearty and earnest Prayer of
May it please your Grace,
