VIrtue sometimes is no less interessed than Affecti∣on: Both, Sir, are glad to receive from time to time pledges mutually answering for those that have united them∣selves in a close correspondence. Yours indeed should demand of

me such, as might be a security to you for the advance you have been pleased to make me of your Friendship. But since at present I have nothing worth presenting you with; and yet am unwilling to give you any leisure to be dif∣fident of my realness, or to re∣pent for having so easily given me a share in your esteem, I here send you a Relation of INDOSTAN, in which you will find such con∣siderable Occurrences, as will make you confess, I could not convey to you a more acceptable Present, and that Monsieur Ber∣nier, who hath written it, is a very Gallant Man, and of a mould, I wish all Travellers were made of. We ordinarily travel more out of Unsettledness than Cu∣riosity,

with a design to see Towns and Countries rather than to know their Inhabitants and Pro∣ductions; and we stay not long enough in a place, to inform our selves well of the Govern∣ment, Policy, Interests and Man∣ners of its People. Monsieur Bernier, after he had benefitted himself for the space of many years by the converse of the fa∣mous Gassendi, seen him expire in his arms, succeeded him in his Knowledge, and inherited his Opinions and Discoveries, embar∣qued for Aegypt, stay'd above a whole year at Cairo, and then took the occasion of some Indian Vessels, that Trade in the Ports of the Red Sea, to pass to Suratte; and after Twelve years abode at

the Court of the GREAT MOGOL, is at last come to seek his rest in his native Countrey, there to give an Accompt of his Observations and Discoveries, and to poure out into the bosom of France, what he had amassed in India.
Sir, I shall say nothing to you of his Adventures, which you will find in the Relations that are to follow hereafter, which he abandons to the greediness of the Curious, who prefer their satisfaction to his quiet, and do already persecure him to have the sequel of this History. Nei∣ther shall I mention to you the hazards he did run, by being in the Neighbourhood of Mecca; nor of his prudent Conduct, which made him merit the

esteem of his Generous Fazelkan, who since is become the first Minister of that Great Empire, whom he taught the principal Languages of Europe, after he had Translated for him the whole Philosophy of Gassendi in Latin, and whose leave he could not obtain to go home, 'till he had got for him a select number of our best European Books, thereby to supply the loss he should suffer of his Person. This, at least, I can assure you of, that never a Traveller went from home more capable to observe, nor hath written with more knowledge, candour, and inte∣grity; that I knew him at Constan∣tinople, and in some Towns of Greece, of so excellent a Conduct,

that I proposed him to my self for a Pattern in the Design I then had, to carry my Curiosity as far as the place where the Sun riseth; that I have often drowned in the sweetness of his entertainment the bitternesses, which else I must have swallowed all alone, in such irksome and unpleasant passages, as are those of Asia.
Sir, You will do me a plea∣sure to let me know the senti∣ment, your Illustrious SOCIETY hath of this Piece. Their Ap∣probation begets much emulation among the Intelligent, who all have no other Ambition than to please them. I my self must avow to you, that if I thought I could merit so much, I should not so stiffly oppose, as I do, the

Publication of the Observations and Notes I have made in the Levant. I should suffer my Friends to take them out of my Cabinet, where, from the slight value I have for them, they are like to lye imprisoned, except the KING my Master, by whose Order I undertook those Voyages, should absolutely command me to set them at liberty, and to let them take their course in the world. Mean time, Sir, you will oblige me, to assure those GREAT MEN, who this day compose the most knowing Company on Earth, of the Ve∣neration I have for the Oracles that come from their Mouth, and that I prefer their Lyceum before that of Athens; and lastly,

that of all their Admirers there is none, that hath a greater Con∣cern for their Glory, than
