THis Treatise (right Worshipfull) tending to the commendation of Cockes, and Cocke-fighting, was by me long since pro∣mised in London, Bostone, and other places: but like an ill Debtor, I haue bro∣ken many dayes of payment: yet now at the last I haue made perfourmance, although perchance not altogether in such good manner, as some men may expect, yet is it in the best sort that I can: and as it is, I hope you will accept it. Mison could not paint so exqui∣sitely, as Apelles did, yet Darius allowed of his labours. Silly Baucis could not feast Iupiter in siluer plate, but in wodden vessels. All that honour Esculape, cannot decke his shrine with Iewels: neither can all they that write, expresse their mindes, so well as they would. But as Apollo gaue Oracles, as well to the poore man for his mite, as to the rich man for his million: so I doubt not, but your worship will accept of this my poore offering, and patronize this booke as willingly, as I dedicate it har∣tily,
 and although I know it is vnworthy, to weare your worthy name: yet haue I (presuming on your wonted curtesie) placed it on the browe of it, to be an ornament vnto it to grace it, and a shield to defend it, against all enuious detractors. Now, the reason why I haue made choyse of you, rather than of any other, is, both in regard of the good will you beare to Cocke-fighting, (wherein I know you take exceeding great delight) and also to mani∣fest my loue, and dutie vnto your worship, to whom I am more than much beholding, for many and most vndeser∣ued curtesies. Being loath to trouble you with too tedi∣ous an Epistle, in all humility, commending my booke to your fauourable protection, I end, hoping one day to doe something that shalbe more worthy of your acceptance, till when and euer, I rest your Worships, to commaund.
