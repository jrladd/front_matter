AS in all Actions and attemptes (Right Honorable) it is moste requisite to choose out suche as are moste politique and prudent performers, so in causes of prote∣ction it is moste necessarie to account of suche as are greatest fauoures of the cause, whereuppon: knowyng your Honor to bee a Piller and vnder∣proppe of true Christianitie, a maintainer of Re∣ligion, and a zealous professor of the Gospell, J thought it not amisse, to offer these trifles (in wisemens Judgementes, yet diuine miracles in the wilfull and Ignoraunt Papistes opinion) to your Honor, to be safcundited vnder your graue title, and the rather, for that my simplicitie shall finde sauegarde vnder so Honorable a name, and my good meanyng (whiche would stretche farre

if abilitie were corespondent) might be manifest vnto you, who haue bounde me by seuerall good turnes, and in whom those in necessitie alwaies finde refuge.
Maie it please you therefore to giue it the o∣uerreading, and as it deserueth, the laughyng at, and as your Honor likes of the miracles, so imparte it for the straungenes to those shall best like you. And thus J moste humbly take my leaue.
