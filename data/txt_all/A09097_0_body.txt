VVo principal causes among o∣thers (right honorable) are wōt to inuite mē to dedicate any booke or treatise to a person in autho∣ritie, the one priuate duty & ob∣ligatiō, the other publiquevtility, in respect that the matter may concearne that person for the cōmō good. And to cōfesse the truth, both of these ioyntly, haue moued me at this tyme, to present vnto your honour aboue others, the two bookes ensuing, which conteyne a conference had in Holland not long since, about the pretences & pre∣tenders to the crowne of Ingland, as your honour shall perceaue by the preface of each booke, & ther∣fore herof I shall need say no more, but only declare the fore said two causes of this dedication.
First then I saye, that my particuler obligation towards your honours person, riseth partly of good turnes and benefites receaued by some frendes of myne at your Lordships handes, in your last voyage & exploits in Frāce, but principally of far greater fauours receaued from your noble ancestors, I meane not only your father whose untimely death

was to Inglād no smalle woūde, but of your grādfa∣ther also, that worthy Knight Sir VValter Deuorax who though he liued not to come to those titles of honor, wherunto he was borne; yet left he behinde him so rare a memory for his excellent partes of lerning, wit, feuter of body, curtesie, & other such noble commēdations, as none in Ingland perhapps the lyke in our tyme, wherin also hath liued your honours great grandfather Sir Henry Deuorax visconde Ferys wel remembred yet by diuers of my said frendes obliged vnto him, as also recorded by our Inglish histories, as well for his merits & worthines, as in lyke manner for his match with the heyre of the most famous & noble house of the Bourchers earles of Essex, wherof also your honour Polyd in vita H. s. is knowne to be discēded, & to hold at this day as wel their nobilitie of bloode as dignitie of title, & this shall serue in this place for my perticuler obli∣gation, wherof perhapps here-after vppon other oc∣casion, I may giue further relation and testimony to the world, in token of my gratitude.
But for the second pointe of publique vtilitie, I thought no man more fitt then your honour to de∣dicate these two bookes vnto, which treate of the succession to the crowne of Ingland, for that no mā is in more high & eminent place or dignitie at this day in our realme, then your selfe, whether we

respect your nobilitie, or calling, or fauour with your prince, or high liking of the people, & consequently no man like to haue a greater part or sway in de∣ciding of this great affaire (when tyme shall come for that determination) then your honour, and those that will assist you & are likest to follow your fame and fortune.
And for that it is not cōuenient for your honour to be vnskillfull in a matter which cōcerneth your person & the whole realme, so much as this doth, and finding this conference had by two learned Lawyers, to handle the question very, pithely and exactly, and yet with much modestye, and without offence of any, and with particuler affection and deuotion to her Maiestie, & with special care of her safetye: I thought not expedient to let it lye vn∣published, as also I iudged that no hāds were fitter to receaue the same, nor any protectiō more secure or plausible, then that of your honour, whom God long preserue in all true honour and felicity, to the comfort of your Lordships faithfull seruants & clyents, & to the publique benefite of your country: from my chamber in Amsterdame this last of December. 1593.
Your honours most affectionate
