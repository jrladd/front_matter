NOt for you were my Master (though that Name
Shall sway me more then any other can)
Nor out of any priuate hope, or aime,
More then my duty, I engaged am:
But onely for you are a Chirurgean;
And one whose Practise and Experience
(Two things that Crownes the Artists excellence)
Time and the VVarres, by Sea and Land began.
Then since you are most worthy this respect,
I should be too Ingratefull to neglect
Your wel-tride Iudgement (though the enuious grudge)
Yet if with mildest cnsure you suruay
This following Treatise, I dare boldly say,
PARIE will haue a fauourable Iudge.
