SIR,
IF the Honour conferr'd upon me, in selecting me par∣ticularly
from my Brethren, for the Preaching of this Sermon, were not a sufficient
Reason for the present Dedication, yet the likeness of the Subject to
your Virtues, would make the Discourse tend naturally towards you: For it's
chief import is concerning those best Qualifications, which are your great
Ornaments (viz.) Religion and Loy∣alty. And, tho it may
possibly want Cultivation, yet I'm sure 'tis not destitute of Charity
and Honesty; which alone will be prevalent enough to make it grateful to Sir
Walter Blount, whose kind and upright Conversation has oblig'd all
to whom it has extended; It has created an extraordina∣ry Love to your
Person, where there has been a Disesteem for your
Religion, and forc'd ev'n the prejudic'd Mobile to confess,
that 'tis possible to be at once a Roman Ca∣tholick, and an Honest
Man. I must confess, such has been the Rude Insolence ev'n of my
Brethren, and those of my own Communion, towards me, upon my Preaching of
this Sermon, that I may be judg'd by some to want rather a Regiment, than a
private Person for my Patron; and to lie under a high Obligation of my giving
God Thanks, that there is the force of an active Power to obviate the Out∣rages
of Passive Obedience. But Truth, which is it's own Defence, is
able, when it only shines, like the Light which Converted St. Paul,
to strike it's Enemies to the Earth;and as I never did:
so with Gods help, I am sure I never shall want Courage to Act
honestly. And therefore I will con∣temn their Frowns and their
Threatnings; and more espe∣cially because, Sir, I am under the Influence of
such a Pa∣tron, who, like your Royal Master, never dis-regarded your
Friends, nor deserted your Servants; and whose Counte∣nance alone, like
that of Caesar to his Soldiers, is able to inspire an undaunted
Resolution into him who is, Sir,
