SIR,
I Make bold to present you with this little New-years Gift; the Subject is Sur∣gery. You being one of the Commissioners of His Maje∣sties Navy, Surgery a part of Naval furniture, falls off right into your Province for Pro∣tection;
the matter is plain but useful. I am not a stran∣ger to the ill usage good en∣deavours commonly meet with; however I presume the number of my Enemies will be less, when they shall per∣ceive I have shelter under a shield so capable to defend me. If any little Zoile or Mome will be making Gri∣maces, and carping, my re∣gard of them shall be less than of those small Insects, which let alone would spoil the best meat, if not corrected with
a Fly-flap. Sir, I have had the honour to be known to you many years in the dis∣charge of my employments by Sea and Land; where the multiplicity of Favours conferred on me, imposes the obligation on him, who subscribes eternally,
