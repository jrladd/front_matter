Ingenious SIR,
AND I hope as kind, otherwise I must expect to meet with Frowns, for so slender hath my performance been, that if there be such a Grace, as Modesty, I may blush to own it. However a courteous Eye may pass over all my slips with a gene∣rous Indulgence; Indeed this is the presage, to which I may impute all my boldness, and if I am deceived, its my too forward praecon∣ception of your Candor hath beguiled me: And yet I am brief enough, and therefore guilty of the fewer Faults; had I been more prolix, I might have tyred out the greatest

Patience, but seeing you are secured from that, I hope it will be one Graine more in the Scale to make your Lenity the heavier. If I shall attain this undeserved Favour, I shall have my wish, and be engaged to ap∣prove my self,
SIR,
