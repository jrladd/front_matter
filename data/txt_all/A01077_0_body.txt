Right Honourable:
I Need not be in doubt (as many men be) to chuse a fit Personage to patronize this mine Embrio, or my first Crude, and vndigested medi∣tations;

seeing that (vnder God) I haue from your Honours my pre∣sent earthly being: and therefore may iustly challenge as much in∣terest in mee as Paul did in Philé∣mon, both my selfe and all my la∣bours: for it hath beene the graci∣ous splendor of your Honourable kinde fauours, that hath so boun∣tifully shined vpon so base an ob∣iect, (not through any deserts of mine obtained) Alasse, I am too priuy vnto mine owne wants, qui rudis & iners: not worthy to bee named the same day with learned men: but that the bright Rayes of your Honourable kinde fauour in this, are like vnto the Royall Sun beames, that shine as bright in the poore mans cottage, as in the Kings pallace. Your worthinesse in your

Honorable attempts in promoting learning & religion, is an euident proofe of your godly & religious disposition: without flattery, these I professe, which haue had a more particular experience of your gra∣cious fauors: (For they need not false praises that abound with true,) And I appeale vnto al those that haue had a triall of your Honorable fauours: which freely haue beene found a∣mongst a great number both of in∣borne & forreiners: wherby your honorable names may be well regi∣stred amongst the worthies in this age, which no doubt, will remaine in all ages, & neuer be blotted out in your honourable posterity. And lest that I should incur the censure of ingratitude, (which is a monster by nature) for all kindnesses receiued:

I haue cast this smal mite into your treasury: that as I walke vnder the the safegard of your honorable roofe I may goe in safety heerein vnder your Honors tuition: beseeching your Honors to accept of it as our Sauiour Christ did the poore wid∣dowes gift, because I giue all that I haue, hoping that you will not re∣gard the meannesse of the gift, so much as the minde of the giuer, which if I louingly find in your gracious acceptance, I shall thinke my selfe most happy in all mine es∣saies: & shall daily pray (as by duty obliged) vnto the God of mercy, for your Honors happinesse in this life, and euerlasting happinesse in the life to come.
