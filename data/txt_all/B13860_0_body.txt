Most gracious PRINCE:
IT is not from any conceit of such worth in my la∣bours, that they durst looke so hie.
 A lower Patronage would haue serued an higher worke. It were well, if ought of mine could be worthie of popular eyes: Or if J could wring ought from my selfe, not vnwoorthie of a iudicious Reader. I know your Highnesse wants neither Presents, nor counsels: Presents from stran∣gers, counsels from your Tea∣chers; neither of them match∣able by my weaknesse: Only du∣tie heerein excuses me from pre∣sumption. For, J thought it in∣iustice to deuote the fruit of my labour, to any other hand beside my Maisters: which also J
 knew to be as gracious, as mine is faithfull. Yet (since euen good affections can not warrant too much vilenesse in gifts to Prin∣ces) lest while my modestie dis∣parages my worke, J should ha∣zard the acceptation; here shall your Grace finde varietie, not without profit. J hate a Di∣uine, that would but please; and, withall, thinke it impossible for a man to profit, that pleaseth not. And if, while my stile fix∣eth it selfe vpon others, any spi∣rituall profit shall reflect vpon your Highnesse, how happie am J! who shall euer thinke, I haue
 liued to purpose, if (by the best of my studies) J shall haue done any good office to your Soule. Further (which these times ac∣count not the least praise) your Grace shall heerein perceiue a new fashion of discourse by Epi∣stles; new to our language, vsu∣all to others: and (as Nouel∣tie is neuer without some plea of vse) more free, more familiar. Thus, we do but talke with our friends by our pen, and expresse our selues no whit lesse easilie; some-what more digestedlie.
Whatsoeuer it is, as it can not be good enough to deserue that
 countenance; so, the countenance of such Patronage shall make it worthie of respect from others. The God of Princes protect your person, perfect your graces, and giue you as much fa∣uor in heauen, as you haue honor on earth.
