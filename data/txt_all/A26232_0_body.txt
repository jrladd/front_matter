Honoured SIR,
THE Prophet David tells us, the workes of the Lord are wonderfull, sought out of all them that have plea∣sure therein: and he hath laid some of the secrets of Nature so deepe, that no humane understanding can fathom, or find them out: Yet neverthelesse he gives wisdome unto man (who is studious thereabout) to discover multi∣tudes of rare, and excellent things, for the use and comfort of man∣kind, that God in all things may be glorified.
Every man hath a Talent, (or more) given him, to improve, for the honour of him that gave it, and the advantage of himselfe, and others: and not to hide it, or lay it up in a Napkin, as very many slothfull persons do, to their shame, and destruction: Especially of those who have the greatest portions, and Revenues in this world: and there∣fore think ther's no need (nor reason) they should labour, either with body or mind: Directi∣ons for walking with God; pag. 49. But Mr Boulton (now in heaven) hath left a Lesson behind him for such to learne, He is (saith he) a cursed drone, a child of idlenesse, and sloth, the very tennis Ball of Temptation, most un∣worthy of the blessings, and benefits of humane society, who doth not one way or other, cooperate, and contribute to the common good, with his best endeavours, in some honest particular calling, or course of life. It brings true honour to be Instrumentall for the honour of God, and good of others: we may take his word for it, who hath said, Them that honour me I will honour, but those that de∣spise me, shall be lightly esteemed. All men desire a good name, which is no way attainable, but by obedience according to the Scrip∣tures: the truest worth, and Nobility, is to be borne from above, to have Relations in Heaven, all earthly honour is but a shadow to it.
Now I wish (for their good) such persons would look upon you, (wor∣thy Sr) and set you as an Example, and Patterne before them, of Lear∣ning, and studiousnesse, in all profitable knowledg, your diligent search,

and indagation into the noble Art of Chymistry, (as it relates to Ve∣getables, and Animals) having already produced many excellent ef∣fects, and been profitable unto many; your study also of other parts of Philosophy I doubt not but ill (in due time) bing forth speciall fruits; And tha in paricular about Fermentation, (and other waes of prparation) of Liquors, more especially that of Cider, which you are now in hand with. It is well knowne, how acceptable, and profitable it is, and hath been, for many generations past, for the health of our bodies, abov many (if not any) other kinds of Liquors, knowne to us; Now in case it may be advancd, and made much better, by Fermenta∣tion, (as there is no doubt but it may) then it will be of more speciall and generall use, then ever yet it hath been, if unto all this be added, vi. to make it of those fruits wich are knowne by Experience to be the best for that purpose: The Learned, and incomparable Author Sr Francis Bacon hath left unto men such Rules, and helps in all kinds of Learning, that thy will be much wanting to themselves, if Arts, and Sciences improve not, very much above what they have been in former ages; And as the foresaid worthy Author was eminently seen in all Arts and Sciences, so his delight was especially (as is recorded of him) in Vegetable Philosophy, which was as it were, his dar∣ling delight, having left unto us much upon Record in his Naturall Hstory; some part whereof referring to Fuit-trees, Fruits, and Flowers, I have, (by encouragement from himselfe) endeavoured to improve unto publique profit, according to what understanding, and experience I have therein: (I think it would not be in vaine, if others who are seene, and experienced in other parts of the said History, would do the like) And seeing I perceive (since you have been plea∣sed to honour me with your acquaintance) that your Genius is towards things of this nature, to promote them, in order to the Common good, and that I have encouragements in my labours thereabout, (both as to the Theory, and Practise) I humbly, present these following Ob∣servations into your hands, and am (for all your favours)
(honoured Sr)
