SIR,
MY childish Muse is in her Spring: and yet
Can onely shew some budding of her Wit.
One frowne vpon her Worke, (Learn'd Sir) from you:
Like some vnkinder storme shot from your brow,
Would turne her Spring, to withering Autumne's time,
And make her Blossomes perish, ere their Prime.
But if you Smile, if in your gracious Eye
Shee an auspicious Alpha can discrie.
How soone will they grow Fruit? How will they flourish
That had such beames their Infancie to nourish.
Which being sprung to ripenesse, expect then
The best, and first fruites, of her gratefull Pen.
