MY LORD,
IN the present Solemnity of Your Lordship's Inauguration; never was Entry made to that fair Post of Honour, under more Expectations than from Your Lordship, nor more Confidence of seeing those Expectations answered. 'Tis not only the more unthinking Crowd of Homagers, those cheaper Lips, salute You; but Judgment and Sense have their Eyes fixt upon You, as fully satisfied that You bring those ample Qualifications for Our Metropolitan Royal Representative, that ne∣ver Chapplet more fitted the Brow that wears it.
And as no little Illustration to the eminent Figure that so much Worth must make, I may justly say of Your Lordship, That Au∣thority as it never approach'd a Fairer, so it never entred under a more Prideless Roof than Your Lordship's. For never certainly was Power more affable, nor Command more familiar. Your State and Your Regalia wait You no farther than Your Chair; which more troublesome formal Attendants of Office are instantly dismist, and Your more genuine softer Train, all Your Sweetnesses of Con∣versation, and the condescending Graces of Courtesie, Goodness and Humanity are called in as Your gentler and nearer Menials. And to all these there runs that Bravery of Spirit through You; a Glory so particularly Your own, that in all the Knees that bend before You, You give an occasion to Thank wherethey Pray. Your Lordships more generous Goodness is not worshipt by empty Gazers only, but by a more sensible Zeal and Devotion. But not to instance the acknowledgments of Duty and Gratitude, the Ad∣dresses and Panegyricks You receive where You have bestowed Smiles and showr'd Favours: Those are no more than the payment

of Debts that are owing You; and Greatness and Power every day meet such Homage. No, my Lord, Your Lordship's Virtue soars a pitch yet higher, a Virtue so attractive, as creates You Vo∣taries at a much farther distance: For Your Lordship has reacht a Character so universally Grateful, that You are every where ho∣noured, even where you never obliged.
And indeed 'tis no more than the Common Justice of mankind to pay that Esteem to so noble and publick spirited a Principle as Your Lordship's; Your Lordship, that think Your self made for the World, as well as the World for You, and consequently (not like too many rising Favourites of Fortune that look no higher than home; to be Rich to themselves, and Poor to all mankind besides,) You make it an equal, if not larger part of Your Ambition to hoard a fair Name as well as a fair Mass to leave behind You.
But in all Your Personal Accomplishments to furnish out the Magistrate, Your Lordships innate Gallantry and Honour are in a high measure owing to Your Generous Extract, and as Generous Education, Derivative from Your Veins, and suckt in from Your Cradle: Your Lordship that possibly has that extraordinary Ad∣vantage, that Additional Weight in your Scale, a Blazon so rare, or at least not in every City Coat, as to descend from that fair Original, the Ashursts of Ashurst, a Family that brought in the Genti∣lity in their Blood, and the Normand Fleur de Lis's in their Scut∣cheon, with the First Great William; and have ever since conti∣nued in that unbroken Chain both of Fortune and Reputation, as has trod as near the Heels of Nobility as any First Rank Gen∣try in England. And as one Honorable Derivative more of Your Lordship's, Your Ancestors have been constant Assertors and Cham∣pions of Religion and Virtue, Witness Your Lordship's Uncle in the Reign of King Charles the First, who then High Sheriff of Lancashire, had the hardy Christian Courage as to lay a Criminal by the Heels for the violation of the Sabbath day, though a Transgressor in that kind and at that time within the Verge of Priviledge, under the Umbrage and Protection of the then newly publisht Metropolitan Canterbury License and Authority.

But whilst my weak Oratory, the meanest Trumpet of a Renown so conspicuous, is only repeating of what all Tongues are already filled with; I beseech You to believe, That this Epistle is not ad∣drest to the Right Honourable Your Lordship; but the Right Worthy, Sir William; not any tributary Devoir to the Greatness You wear for a Year, but the great Soul You wear always. For as Your Lordship's present Dignity is not presented You as a Gift, but paid You as a Reward; under that consideration, to level at the true Object of our Veneration, we must look beyond the Robe You wear, to the Merit that put it on. For the Foundation of True Honour, is like that of the Pyramide: The Basis is always larger than the Pinnacle that Crowns it. 'Tis in that capacity, as both an Honour to the City, and an Ornament to Your Country, I Congratulate Your Lordship's Accession to Your Praetorian Chair, and our proud Metropolis's Happiness in such a Member, and such a Magistrate, being with no little Pride,
MY LORD,
