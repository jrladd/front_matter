IF the attentive eye may bee as gainefull to the understanding as the listning eare; if the fu∣gatious words, which escape the eares pursuit, by that may bee arrested to the doome of judge∣ment, if it can scruple at Erra∣ta, when the eares credulity sums up with approbation, then may I discharge my selfe, and fru∣strate censure, of an apologie, for exposing to a more deliberate review of the eye, what posted by the laborynths of the eare with lesse delay.
