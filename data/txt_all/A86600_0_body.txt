Reverend Brethren,
THese meditations acknowledge themselves yours, as drawn from your command and call.
They were commanded to your ears, and now are commended to your eyes.
I beseech you receive them as your own again, although not such as you deserve, or as I could desire, yet such as I am able to be∣stow. I am conscious of my own insuffici∣encies, but withal, of your candid ingenui∣ties, especially to them who love the truth of Christ insincerity.
I throw this childe of old age, into the arms of your pious Patronage: I beseech you let it finde a room in your hearts, and a word from your lips, either to defend it, or at least to excuse it from the murmurings of any Momus, or the cavils of any Critick
that may check, or chide it, or with black-mouthes blame it in your hearing. And this I beseech for his sake, that doth pro∣mise, what I am, or may be (Christ strength∣ning me) shalbe Gods, & yours, & his people.
There are very many daily sending in their presents to the Church of Christ, of their profitable labors: I thought it not amiss to send in my mite into this Trea∣sury, as a testimony of my equal desire; which in Gods account, goes for current coyn, and is accepted: And I hope shall finde favor with some, although it may be contemned by others.
But if it may at all, or in the least mea∣sure, bring any glory unto God, or good to the Church of Christ, I have my end and aim: it is all I look for, and it is abundantly enough.
For which purpose, I send it unto you my reverend Brethren, with prayers for to ac∣company it, and follow it; humbly request∣ing that I may have a portion in your assi∣dual prayers for him, who will retaliate them, with heart-panting petitions to the throne of Grace, that yours, and mine, and all the labors and layings out of the Mini∣sters of Jesus Christ, may prosper in the hearts of our people, which is and shall be, the constant prayer of Your weak, unwor∣thy Brother,
Prees, from my study,
March 26. 1656.
