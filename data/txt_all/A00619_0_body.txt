MADAME,
IF euer Reso∣lutions were needfull, I thinke they

be in this Age of loose∣nesse; wherein, 'twere some vnhappinesse to bee good, did not the Consciousnesse of her owne worth, set vertue firme, against all dis∣heartnings. This makes her of so specious a glo∣rie, that though shee need not the applause of any, to adde to her happinesse; yet she at∣tracts the hearts of all that know her, to Loue, Seruice, Admira∣ration.

That I haue sa∣cred this offertory of my thoughts to your Ladyship, this is reason inough; if not, your Loue to my dearest friend, may second it. To apparell any more in these paper vest∣ments, I should multi∣ply impertinents; and perhaps displease. For I haue euer found face∣commendation to dye Wisedomes cheeke of a blush-colour. Discreet

Nature is alway mo∣dest, and deseruing best, loues least to heare on't. This onely I will truely adde: that I know not the thing of that value, should make me shrine vp a worke of this na∣ture, to any, in whom I could obserue, the pos∣sibility of a faile in Ver∣tue. Such a Dedication were to put Vertue to a Stepdame, that would not nurse, but stifle her. With your Goodnesse, I

am sure, shee shall finde the tendernesse of a ma∣ternall loue. And if in these weake extracti∣ons, your Iudicious eye light you to ought, in∣creasing that affection (all by-respects put a∣way) my next Petition will bee: that it may please you to command
