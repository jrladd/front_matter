VAliant whilome the Prince that bare this Mot,
ENgraued round about his golden Ring:
ROaming In VENICE ere thou wast begot,
AMong the Gallants of th' Italian spring.


NEuer omitting what might pastime bring,
ITalian sports, and Syren Melodie:
HOpping Hlena with her warbling sting,
INfested th' Albanian dignitie,
LIke as they poysoned all Italie.


VIgilant then th' eternall majestie,
ENthraled soules to free from infamie:
REmembring thy sacred virginitie,
INduced vs to make speedie repaire,
VNto thy mother euerlasting faire,
SO did this Prince begette thee debonaire.


SO wast thou chast and princely Nymph begot,
VNder Ceilias education
STrong in allyed friendes of highest lot,
AMidd the court of estimation
NOr doe I giue thee this for adulation:
NO Pen can show thy propagation,
ALl heauens blesse thine operation.


NAked we landed out of Italie,
INthal'd by Pyrats men of noe regard,
HOrror and death assayl'd Nobilitie,
IF Princes might with crueltie be scar'd
LO thus are excellent beginnings hard.


COnioyn'd thou art to great Mongomria,
A Peerelesse Ladie onely fit for him:
SOber and chaste, he was in Cardiff Cambria,
THe Knight I knew before mine eyes were dimme,
IF Temperance, and continence, an Earle may trimme,
VNder the Orbe of mightie Phoebes round,
SYdnian Knights like him are hardly found.
