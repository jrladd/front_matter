ALthough (right Honorable) to bring fire to the
Altars when the Sacrafice is ended; or Epitaphs
for the dead whē their funeralles are halfe for∣gotten,
is to wish for rayne when the haruest is
past: yet considering with my self the neuer dying vertues
of the worthie once hopefull Gentleman of England Sir
Phillip Sidney Knight, a mā so beloued of al, as obliuiō fea∣reth
to perswade time any waies to impaire his immortall
fame: & seeing that all in heart & diuers in their labours
did bewayle his losse, painting out in Poemes & Epitaphs
his vertues & their owne sorowes: amongst whō a gentle∣man
and seruaunt of your Honors George Whetstones, had
before his going into the Low Countries writtē learned∣ly
an Epitaph of his life and death: although destinie and
fate hath too vntimely ended his daies: yet sith his works
before his departure were dommitted to my hands, I,
thought it my dutie and held it as a religion, first not to
depriue the gentleman of that due which his willingnesse
and labours did worthely deserue: secondly for that his
workes bewrayed the vertues of such a Paragon of our
time: and lastly & not the least cause, for that your honors
seruant had dedicated his Poems to your Lordship; whose
Epistle as he wrote it to your honor I haue prefixed. These
considerations (right Honorable) moued me to attempt
the impression of this Epitaph, which I humbly present
vnto your Lordship: desiring your Honor to vouchsafe of
my good meaning, and not to misconster of my boldnes.
In which hope testing, I commit you to the Almightie.
