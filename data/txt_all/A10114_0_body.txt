THe endelesse making of bookes was a vanitye in the dayes of Salomon, when Printing was not. The end of all, is the seate of God. Certainely men may not make it a light matter in consci∣ence, to trouble the worlde with vnprofi∣table writinges. Yet, as in the shewebread that was shewed to the people as a figure of Christ the olde loaues hauing serued to their use were remoued, and other sup∣plied in their roome, yet still breade in na∣ture, & twelue loaues in nomber: so those writinges that figure out Christ, and set foorth Christian duetye, may be often∣times treated of, and eftsoones repeated and added to other mens doinges, not withstanding no great variety in the mat∣ter or maner of handling. It hath beene thought expedient I write & publishe this litle treatise. Wherupon (right Honorable)
therewithal I haue thought it my boundē duetie humbly to present it to your ho∣nours viewe: the rather, in parte to excuse mine ouer great boldnesse else when, but principally, to craue such furtheraunce in the setting out therof, as your honors piety and place accustometh to shewe, to such as in their calling with their talentes, ey∣ther fiue, two, or but one, labour to set foorth the trueth, to instruct the simple, & to saue soules. This hath bene mine en∣deuor: the successe whereof is to be pray∣ed for of the almightie and merciful God, who alwayes preserue your honour to the glorie of his name, the benefite of his Church and this our countrie, in all faith∣full seruice to her Maiestie, and great cō∣forte of her louing subiectes in the Lorde. Februarie. 14. Anno. 1582.
