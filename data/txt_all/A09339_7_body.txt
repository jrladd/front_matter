RIght Honourable, the kingdome of heauen, of which the Scripture speaketh so oft, is properly a certaine state or cōdition, wherby we stand in the fauour and loue of God, in and by Christ. And this kingdome is compared to a graine of Musterd-seede, to teach vs that a man is euen at that instant alreadie entered into the kingdome of heauen, when the Lord, that good husband-man, hath cast but some little portion of faith or repentance into the ground of the heart: yea though it be but as one graine of musterd-seed. Of this little graine I haue penned this little treatise, in quantitie answerable thereto: and now I present the same to your Laship, not to supplie your want (for I hope you are stored with more graines of this kinde) but to performe some dutie on my part. Ho∣ping therefore that your Ladiship will read and accept the same, I take my leaue, commending you to the blessing and protection of the Almightie.
