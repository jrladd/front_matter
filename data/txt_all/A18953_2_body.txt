THe hardest heart, with rudest hand,
That is least subiect to command,
That feares not God, grimme Death, nor Hell,
Nor euer knew but to rebell,
Seizing by force, and rifling all
That in his greedie Clutches fall,
As you passe by, must in a Maze
(Æ²oyd of all power) stand and gaze;
Such awe a Ladies presence beares,
Filling a Rake-hells heart, which feares;
Besides, you alwayes haue your guide,
And a safe conuoy, as you ride;
Not to protect you (there's no need)
Is then this Storie, (you may reade;)
This chiefly is, to let you see
My good amendments constancie;
Our blessed Queene (mou'd thereunto
I doe presume, by some of you)
Preseru'd my life; accept you then
Iust thankes, from my vnskilfull pen;
Loe, this I was enioyn'd to write,
But I meane shortly to indite
A perfect, true, and ample Storie,
That shall speake nothing, but your glory;
Accept (meane while) what heere you see;
You'le otherwise, dishearten mee.
