GENTLEMEN,
THO' this Sermon was preached at your earnest Request, yet I could have wished you would have excused me from the Publication of it. But since you would not be denyed, I should be very well pleased

if you share not in the Faults and Imperfections of this Discourse, which you have now made your own, by espousing the Subject, and obliging the Preacher to the Printing of it. I have only this to say for my self, that your Ge∣norous inclinations to do Good, and your present Resolutions to encourage all the Worthy Gentlemen, who were educated at St. PAUL's School, to lay a new Foundation of Charity for that Place, led me to the Subject of this ensuing Discourse. And I hope this will be one Consequent of it, that this beginning of your Charity will annually be emproved by all those who bear any Relation or Love to the Place of their Education. And I do not question, but succeeding Years may raise a noble Superstructure of Charity from this Ground-work you have so happily

laid, for the Honour of our School, and for the Encouragement of all Arts and Learning.
May all your excellent Designs pros∣per, your Christian Charity in General flourish, may you bring Honour to our Establish'd Church and Kingdom, where∣of you are Worthy Members, and may you never want a Blessing and Success in all your particular Stations and Em∣polyments; which is the hearty Wish of,
GENTLEMEN,
