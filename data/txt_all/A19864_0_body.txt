IF Caesar, most gracious Soue∣raigne Ladie, encouraged his Pilot being feareful in a tempest at sea, by saying to him, Feare not thou cariest Caesar: howe much more may we be comfor∣ted, & feare no wind of fortune, your sacred person being in our arke, and your royall hand at the sterne of our gouernment: for greater is your Maiestie then Caesar, and of more power to giue life to the fift Monarchie which shall haue no ende; then he to the fourth almost ended.
To subdue mightie nations remaineth onely in the monuments of time: but to conquer men with pietie (the guidon of all the vertues) is to leaue a Trophaea of your Maiesties victories, so great as no age can comprehend. The consideration of this moueth the world with a re∣uerent regard of your Maiesties proceedings; which be∣ing houed vnder the wing of God, can suffer no altera∣tion of time or fortune.
Who would an instance hereof, he can haue none more honorable then the resolution of all men to with∣stand the Spaniards intended inuasion; they being then most enclined to your Maiesties seruice when the danger seemed greatest by the neere approch of the Spanish Ar∣mado.
Seing then most mightie Princesse, the blason of your vertues is best knowne by expressing their barbarous ty∣rannie, contraries being perceiued by their contrarie ef∣fects, I thought meete in regard thereof (my dutie to your Maiestie commanding no lesse) to display some Spanish colours, whereby the brightnesse of your glorie issued from your qualified gouernment, may the sooner ap∣peare to all men.
This collection I most humbly Dedicate vnto your most excellent Maiestie, beseeching him who hath pla∣ced you in the royall seate, and miraculously preserued your Maiestie from sundrie sorts of great danger, to giue your Highnesse a most prosperous and long life in assu∣red tranquillitie, to the glorie of his name, and comfort of your faithfull and louing subiects.
