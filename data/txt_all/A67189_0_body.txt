May it please your Lordship,
ALthough the ensuing Discourse might by many more Titles justly be stil'd your Lordship's, yet since it was preach'd and made publick under your Lordships Government, no Person (but your Lordship) ought to be dis∣satisfied, that I presume to affix the Name of so Great a Patron, to the Dedication. I had the happiness
 (though in a lower Sphere) to be known unto your Lordship, in a Colledge where I liv'd under your light: I had the advantage to partake of those influences constantly dispers'd and diffus'd by the example of your Noblest Education; I there contracted that Venera∣tion and esteem for your Lordship, which I ought al∣wayes to preserve and acknowledge; and not this Re∣verence alone, but an ambition of being sheltred under a Name so truly Illustrious, put me beyond all choice, and in a manner destin'd me to this Address. I most humbly beg the protection of your Lordships Name for an Author newly complemented (against his na∣ture) into the Press, perhaps at first not altogether with his will perswaded into the Pulpit. If your Lordship shall vouchsafe to favour me so far, I shall be encouraged to have a better opinion of my perfor∣mances in this kind, and I hope to do better. I may without Vanity say, I have done some things with more accuracy and correctness, but there is a fate in Writing, as in men, the smaller and most inconsi∣derable are very often preferr'd; and this is the first known by my name, and the most early Testimony
 I could with any tolerable excuse (for the occasion) give the World of my endeavour to express my self,
My LORD,
