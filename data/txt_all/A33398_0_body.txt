MY LORD,
THere are several things in
the World that carry a∣long
with them no real
use or profit; but serve only to
fill up the vacuities of the Cre∣ation,
and please purely upon the
account of Variety: Among this
class of Beings some Men have

graciously vouchsafed to rank all
Essayers in this kind: and our
Authors further add, That if Na∣ture
ever made any thing in Vain,
'twas a Poet. Well, for once let
Poets have the worshipful Name
of Jesters to Mankind; let us grant
for once, That they are but Risus
plorantis Mundi, as was said of the
Rainbow, the Sport and Caprice of
Nature; Men work'd off when she
was in an excellent merry vein.
Yet hard Fate it is, That while
like Silk-Worms, they unravel their
very Bowels for the Pleasure and
Luxury of Mankind; they must
lye Entomb'd in their own bot∣toms.
We read, I confess, of few
of the Tribe that have been Lord
Mayors or Secretaries of State, Men
of vast Business or Politicks: Yet

let me oppose to this bold Slander,
by way of Apology, for the use∣fulness
of Poetry, what stands Re∣corded
of the Famous Alcaeus, that
great Poet and Souldier, who used
to make his Speeches in Verse at
the head of his Army; and
thought there was as much Martial
Musick in the Harmonious Ca∣dence
of Numbers, as in the lou∣der
noise of Drums and Hautboys.
Nay we further read, Poets were
the Civility Masters to Mankind,
and the only Divines of the old
World: and even the greatest
Preachers of our days are not a∣shamed
to make use of their Ser∣mon-Notes,
and bespangle their
Discourse with the Golden Re∣mains
of their Compositions.

I question not, but Your Lord∣ship
does presently fore-see what
Advantage I intend to make of
this Preamble; For where now
shou'd persecuted Poetry fly, but
to the Patronage of the Great?
Whose very Title, at the Front of
its Productions, is Charm enough
against all the peevish Bolts of an ill∣judging
Age. And, I hope, Your
Lordship will the more easily par∣don
the Presumption, in prefixing
Your awful Name to these Trifles,
when You shall consider, That the
Greatest Men the World yet pro∣duc'd,
have been Your Fellow-suf∣ferers,
have been pester'd with Ad∣dresses
of this kind: The great Sci∣pio
had Ennius always in his Camp:
And a greater than he, the Mace∣donian
Youth, carried a whole Knot

of the Brothers of the Quill, into
Asia, with him. And Your Lord∣ship
may, with Modesty enough,
put in for a Share in this Privilege,
of having Poeta a latere; whose
Sword has already acted Wonders;
and will in time, no question, cut
out more Work for Heroick Poe∣try;
than the ablest Pen can en∣grave.
But still, My Lord, these Motives
had been too weak, had not Your
Natural Candor and Ingenuity o∣pen'd
a way for this bold Attempt:
And here I have but too large a
Field to expatiate in. I may safe∣ly
say, You possess all the Virtues,
separate from the Vices of a Cour∣tier.
All that have the Honour of
Your Lordship's Acquaintance, pro∣claim
You Master of a Soul, that

is unruffled with Passion, undistur∣bed
with the Freakishness of Hu∣mour;
where Affability with State,
Humility with Greatness, meet and
center.
This is Great and Illustrious: But
Your Lordship's steady and unby∣ass'd
Loyalty, is the Brightest Star
in this Constellation of Virtues: Far
from the Humor of some Male-Con∣tents
of our Age, who upon the
least Pique, and Court-Disgust, fly
off to the Faction; not unlike the
Fellow, who had God on one side
of his Shield, and the Devil on the
other, with this Motto, If You won't
have me, here's One will.
Thus, when Nature had fitly
fram'd Your Mind, she left not
off here, but took order the fair In∣habitant
shou'd be lodg'd in as de∣licate

a Body; a Structure of such
admirable Contrivance and Regula∣rity,
that I must here apply what
Plato has said of Philosophers, That
the Souls of Vulgar Persons are
lodg'd in their Bodies, but the Bo∣dies
of Philosophers in their Souls;
their very Bodies being so pure, de∣fecate
and refin'd: Never was a
happier Match made by Fate, ex∣cept
in that bless'd Conjunction of
Your other Half, Your Honour'd
Lady, and Your Self; a Couple
so well pair'd by Heaven, that if
all the Beauty and Proportion of
both Sexes shou'd be lost, here it
might be retriev'd: And such is
the Harmony of Your Souls, so
strong the Tie of Conjugal Affe∣ction,
as it cou'd scarce be greater,
when the whole World had but

Two in Family: An Example of
such admirable Influence, that it
were able throughly to Convert a∣ny
Age, less lewd than That we
live in.
But in vain, My Lord, I seek to
play the Panegyrist, when Heaven
it self has long since design'd You
for a lasting Ornament to this Na∣tion,
by chusing Your Lordship to
be a Part of those precious Remains
of the Scoth Wreck: and his Roy∣al
Highness has taught the World
how to value so much Worth and
Excellency, when Your Lordship
had the Honour to be the Second
Man call'd into the Long-Boat.
As for these ensuing Trifles
Your Lordship may easily perceive
by the Weakness of the Child, that
the Parent is of no strong Mascu∣line

Constitution in Poetry: But if
the World will be pleas'd to take
'em as they are, I promise, for their
Comfort, never to trouble 'em
more. But why do I appeal to the
Many? No: With the Wise Hea∣then,
Contemno minutos istos Deos
modo Jovem propitium habeo: Let
the World freely damn 'em for
their Money, so they live but in
the favourable Opinion of Your
Lordship; which is the utmost Am∣bition
of,
My Lord,
