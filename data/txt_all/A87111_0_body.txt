Right Worshipfull:
WHen Appolonius desi∣red
Vespasian the Em∣perour,
that he would
give entrance and ac∣cesse
to Dion, and Euphrates, two
Philosophers, he thus answered;
.
I have my Gates alwaies open to
Phisosophers; but even my very
breast is open to thee. Let your
Gates be open to all true lovers
of Arts and Sciences, that so lear∣ning
may be advanced, and its
lovers encouraged; and let your

eares be open to the Parliaments
servitours, that so desert may be
rewarded, and the laborious ani∣mated.
I have laboured day and
night in the Parliaments Service,
and have had some encourage∣ment
from your Worship, and
other of the Right Worshipfull
Deputy Lievtenants, as likewise
from Captaine Andrew Ball at
Walmer Castle, to whom I am
not unthankfull; but I must con∣fesse
I have found slight respects
of some, who have been to me
ingrate; that was my comfort,
this my grief.As Walmer n Kenr. Now go on (Right
Worshipfull) with truth, equity,
and justice, that God may blesse
your great designs and weighty
affairs for Englands Parliament.
So prayeth
