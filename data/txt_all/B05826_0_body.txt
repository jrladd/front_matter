Blessed TRINITY,
FRom an Affectionate and willing Spirit, from a Heart desiring to please Thee, and to be in all things right toward Thee; I humbly Dedicate this Discourse to the Uses of thy Glory, Love, and Obedience; begging this on∣ly for my self, That I may not Preach to others, and be my self a Cast-away: For thy Faith∣ful People, begging Pardon and Peace, That they may be cleansed from all their Sins, and serve Thee with a quiet Mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Amen, Amen.
