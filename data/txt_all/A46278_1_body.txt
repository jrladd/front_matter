GENTLEMEN,
IN obedience to Your Commands, and punctual performance
of my Promise, I crave permission to salute You with a
perfect Copy of this Years Triumphs, wherein I have
not express'd such sterility of Invention, as to reiterate or
imitate any thing which I have formerly done my self, or any
other Authors that heretofore have performed this Duty, either
in designation of the Whole, or composition and order of
the Parts, relating either to the Figures, Structures, or
Orations, those things only excepted which are the Trophies of
Antiquity, and especial Marks of Distinction, in the fre∣quent
Representation of the Worshipful Companies Crest and
Supporters, the Camel and Gryphons, with all their Ac∣complishments
and Decoration. If in all, or any thing, I have
made my Endeavours correspondent to Your Expectation, I
shall humbly hope, I may deservedly acquire the Title of,
GENTLEMEN,
