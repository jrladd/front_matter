SVch is now, and euer∣more hath been, the in∣constant, and interchan∣geable estate of humane affaires (good Sir) that nothing hath beē which hath not had his in∣crease, his hight, as also his declining: and albe∣it, it may bee said that among the rest, martiall discipline was neuer in any age neglected, or vnregarded: Yet can it not be deny∣ed, but that in former ages the same hath been manna∣ged with much more honourable regard and reward, then now it is. Witnesse the many honoures, which the Greekes, and Romans allowed to Souldiers, and men of high desert. And in especiall, the stately and costly Triumphs which were allowed to their Consuls

Neyther haue writers left their atchiuements or wor∣thy designes vnrecouered, and smothered in obliuion: which benefit many worthy Commanders of our Na∣tion haue wanted. Among which, Iohn Hawke∣wood, whose honour and memoriable exploits, acted in Forraine Countries had been forgotten, had not Paulus Iouius, and some few others rather remem∣bred them, then expressed them according to their worth. This moued me some few yeeres since, for my owne recreation, to collect these Histories ensuing: hoping that some one or other, better furnished then my selfe, would haue vndertaken to deliuer them to the world in more ample manner, and more plausible termes: which not falling out according to my expec∣tation, but being put to the Presse, I being most assu∣red of your generous and worthy disposition, haue im∣bouldened my selfe in this to make tender of that loue which I beare and owe to your vertues: wishing to you all that happinesse which may equall your godly and vertuous intendments,
