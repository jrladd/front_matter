My LORD,
HAVING attempted a Task of as great Use to the CHRISTIAN CHURCH, as of dif∣ficulty to perform, viz. The Reformation of Our COMMON CALENDAR, and
a Right Stating of the Holy Feast of EASTER, (I hope,) for Ever, I do in all Humility cast both my Self, and It at Your Lordships Feet, Imploring Your Honours Protection of both, so far only as Your Lordship shall judge the Work, and Authour Deserving. It is a Subject that hath caused more Heats in the Primitive Times, than any Other, and not without the Ex∣pence of much SWEAT and BLOOD; So Zealous were the Antient Christi∣ans in Contending for the TRUTH. This Method Once Embraced, as I hope, and am sure it will the sooner for Your Lordships Owning, there will never need any more Quarrels or Contentions about it.
You are, (My Lord,) One of the Greatest Stars in our British Hemi∣sphere,
and move in an ORBE of Honour very near unto Royal PHAE∣BUS himself. Nay, I must, in all Hu∣mility, beg leave to remember the (Unthinking part of the) World, That, to your very Great Honour now, and Greater Glory in Ages to come, Your Lordship was Once nearly E∣clips'd with Him too; Being Con∣strain'd to an Unonable Travel in your Elder years for the Security of your Life and Liberty, when both were boldy struck  by the EXCLU∣SIONERS of our late Perilous Times, that bid so Fair for the Un∣inging of the GOVERNMENT it self.
These things, (My Lord,) then be∣ing true, Your Lordship is the most Fit of any, (if at least you shall judge my
Mean, but Well-meant Pains, worthy so great regard,) to bring this Mer∣curial Discovery to the KINGS most ROYAL EAR. The Gogitating HERMES sometimes makes MO∣NARCHS shine as Gloriously, as the Valiant and Commanding Ma∣vors: And the Ever Famous JU∣LIUS CAESAR derives as Last∣ing, (I will not say so Great,) an Honour from his Correction of the CALENDAR, as from his Victory obtain'd in the Pharsalian Field.
And if this my Minute Attempt happen to be but Embraced by your Lordship, I shall then hope to live to see MENSIS OCTOBRIS, (in our BRITISH CALEN∣DAR, at least,) Exchanger its
Name, for that more Glorious and Au∣spicious One, of MENSIS JACO∣BI: To which Remarkable Month your Lordship hath a more then Or∣dinary Title, as being most happily Born therein, and on a Day so near the best of KINGS, and in Con∣junction with a Most BLESSED EVANGELIST, though in Dif∣ferent years.
Pardon, (My Lord,) I beseech you, my Great Confidence, in presu∣ming to Think That any thing I am able to Write should be Worthy of your Lordships Notice. And if This my Humble ESSAY should fail of a Ge∣neral Approbation, Let it, however, (with your Lordships Noble Fa∣vour,) stand me in this stead, viz. to Tell the World, and your Lordship,
how much I am, (according to my mean ,) willing to promote the English , and also, in a Just and Grae Duty to your Lord∣ship, Record my self, by many Obli∣gations,
(My LORD,)
