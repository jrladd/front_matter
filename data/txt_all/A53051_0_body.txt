MY LORD,
I Have mentioned in my other Books,
that I think it not fit I Should Dedi∣cate
unto your Lordship the Single
parts of my Works, before I de∣dicate
all the parts in the Whole;
yet I cannot chuse but declare to the World how
happy I and my works are in your Approvement,
which makes the pastime of my Writing very
Delightfull; besides, it makes me confident and
resolute to put them to the Press, and so to the
Publik view, in despite of these Critical times
and Censorious age, which is apt to find fault
with every Action, let it be never so innocent or
harmlesse, or with any Work although good and

profitable, yet they will sting spiteful Aspersions
on them: But I have heard your Lordship say,
that most men Believe themselves not Wise if
they find no Fault with their Neighbours Acti∣ons,
and that it is as Easie to find Fault, as it is
Hard to do Well; It seems such men have more
Evil in their Natures, than fustice in their
Censures; but your Lordship, who is full of
Truth and Generosity, Reason and Knowledge,
will give your Opinion Clearly and Uprightly,
and my Works having your Approbation, I re∣gard
not the Dislike of other men, for I have
Dedicated my Self and all my Actions to your
Lordship, as becomes
