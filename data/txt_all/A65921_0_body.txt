My Lord,
NExt to despising those Dominions, the Vindi∣cation of which I have presum'd humbly to offer at in the Discourse aext, a demurr to your Honours Order for this impression of it, would be a Crime of greatest magnitude; which I could not contrive how to attone for. I know too well mine own deficiencies, to render my self and them obnoxi∣ous to the publick Censure of this critical Age, but withal know as well, who is Gods Representative in this Kingdom, and the Kings, in this Great and celebrated City; where like a Wise Master-Builder you have laid such a Foundati∣on, that if your Successours shall make a Superstructure pro∣portionable, the Top stone will come to be advanced in glory to the best of Religions, Kings, and Churches in the World; And thereby Monuments erected of just and Pious fame, to your self and them, more lasting than those of Brass and Marble; more Glorious than the Re-erection of this splen∣did City: Where the Foundations have been lately attem∣pted to be destroyed, in a sadder sense than ever. Towards the prevention of which great Fatality, what here I have (with no other prospect than a truly conscientious one)
 design'd, I have also endeavour'd to make good by Scripture reason, the best, and most authentick; which none will, or can deny, but those that have dar'd of later days to ab∣jure both.
How propitious a reception this, and its poor Compiler found with your Lordship, I can never sufficiently own to the World, with that gratitude and obedience which is due, for those great and Everlasting Obligations you have deign'd to lay upon me; having no better return to make, than the best and most importunate of my Devotions; That the Great God would graciously continue to assist you with that just and generous courage as well as conduct, which you have given very ample proof of, for carrying on the good Work you have begun; that at last it may be con∣summate; and your security, reputation, and satisfaction with it, in that of our Most Gracious Soveraign, and his tru∣ly sober, stedfast, Loyal Subjects; in which Vote your Lord∣ship may assure your self of the most cordial concurrence of all such, more especially those of our Function, and most pecu∣liarly that of him, who though the meanest, yet cannot but be ambitious to be reputed,
My Lord,

August 10. 1682.
