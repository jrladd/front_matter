OUr graver Muse from her long Dream awakes,
Peneian Groves, and Cirrha's Caves forsakes:
Inspir'd with Zeal, she climbs th' Aethereal hills
Of Solyma, where bleeding Balm distills;
Where Trees of Life unfading Youth assure,
And Living Waters all Diseases cure:
Where the Sweet Singer, in coelestial Laies,
Sung to his solemn Harp Iehovah's Praise.
From that faln Temple, on her Wings she bears
Those Heavenly Raptures to your sacred Ears:
Not that her bare and humble Feet aspire
To mount the Threshold of th'harmonious Quire;
But that at once she might Oblations bring
To God; and Tribute to a god-like King.
And since no narrow Verse such Mysteries,
Deep Sense, and high expressions could comprise;
Her labouring Wings a larger compass flie,
And Poesie resolves with Poesie:
Lest she, who in the Orient clearly rose,
Should in your Western World obscurely close.
