BIg-swolne with sighes, & almost drown'd with teares
My Muse out of a dying traunce vp-reares;
Who yet not able to expresse her moanes,
In steede of better vtterance, here groanes.
And least my close-breast should her health impaire,
Is come amongst you, for to take the ayre,
I neede not name the greefes, that on her seaze,
Th'are knowne by this, beyond th' Antipodes.
But to your view some heauy rounds she brings,
That you may beare the burthen, when she sings:
And that's but Woe: which you so high should straine,
That heauens vault might Eccho't backe againe,
Then, though I haue not striued to seeme witty,
Yet read, and reading note, and noting pitty.
What though ther's others show, in this more Art?
I haue as true; as sorowfull a hart:
What though Opinion giue me not a Name,
And I was ne're beholding yet to Fame?
Fate would (perhapps) my Muse, as yet vnknowne,
Should first in Sorrowes liuery be showne.
Then, be the witnes of my discontent,
And see, if greefes haue made me Eloquent:
For here I mourne, for your our publike losse;
And doe my pennance, at the Weeping Crosse.
