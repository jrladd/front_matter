SIR,
MY Obedience to your Commands so happily concentring with my in∣clination, to this Subject, have in less than three days space producted, what here you see. To you I need make no Apo∣logy for it's artless habit, who very well know my want of years, and a necessary ex∣perience in this Ages humor, having never had more than two Months conversation in London. But I must confess that was sufficient to instruct me in this Subject; for among all the Poets I was in company with, I heard nothing but their complaints, who unmercifully damn'd both the times, and one another, neither have I seen a mo∣dern Play, but either begun or ended in the same tune, some of which you will find
quoted in this Poem. And as for the Cha∣racter of Poetry, it is a piece I had lying by me, which I think is a more correct and a seriouser thought, than is the Poem, most of which was writ Ex tempore, and too morrow being the day I take shipping I wanted leisure to transcribe it. Besides you know I never lov'd to take much pains. Then as for my declaring my self a Poet, yet per∣forming it to illy, I know I must needs seem guilty of a vain ostentation. But you knew before that I have been above this year an incorrigible scribler. But notwithstanding my discontents at home, could I any where in England have met with encouragements any way suitable to my endeavours, I had not in this passion shaken hands with it. But now I am in hast to be gone, yet will ever remain
