THE High Ascendent, of your so Juvenile and Early accomplish∣ments, as they attract the Admi∣ration of all, so they advertise your Friends in particular, what Cal∣culation
their Hopes may make, of the Generous Influences your Meridian-Perfections, will one day impart to your Country and Family, in the Happy Conjun∣ction of Experience with your present Eminent Qualities.
But this is not the onely Auspi∣cious Prognostick of your Grow∣ing Excellencies, to such as have any Acquaintance with your Illu∣strious Family, and remember either the assiduous Education you have received from your most Excellent Lady-Mother; or the Hereditary Virtue, to which by a long Descent from your Brave Ancestors (as Sr. John
the Strong, Sr. John the Loiall, and Sr. Thomas (as your Ho∣noured Father's Works speak him) the Learned) you are Heir Apparent, and Tenant en le Taile.
But, Brave Sir, to overpasse, in this Place, that Just Tribute, which I can never sufficiently render to your Merits, much lesse when confin'd to the brevity of an Epistle; It is your Fame, that hath brought the Injur'd Lover (after his Travells, through Ita∣ly, France, and Spain,) to im∣plore from your Generosity that Protection, wherewith you may at once change both his Name and Fortune.

And be pleads that his Addresse is most properly Directed to you, Sir, in that the Subject of this Story, is a Seasonable Lecture to such Young Gentlemen, upon the many Malignant Influxes, evill Women have upon the Honour and Happinesse of such, who in∣cautelously converse with them.
Now, to conclude, Honoured Sir, The vouchsafe of your Patro∣ciny, and Courteous Reception of this, will encourage me to expedite my intended Translation, of the Life and Labours of your Ho∣nourable and Learned Ancester, the Famous John Salusbury, Lord Bishop of Chartres, and
Minister of State to Henry the Second. Whose Discourse judici∣ously treating of the Vanities of the Court, is almost ready to be Prest for your Service; A work, which will be more suitable to your Improving Gravity, and more proportionate to the extra∣ordinary obligations of,
Worthy Sir,
