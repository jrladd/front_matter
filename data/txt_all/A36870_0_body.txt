Madam,
THis Book that
fights against
Vanity is justly
yours, because you
have overcome it; we sight
against it in words, you
overcome it in actions; acti∣ons
so much better than
words, as health is better
than Physick, and Victory
than the Battell. Your name
alone in the front of my

Book shal give me my lesson,
for if I will paint out Vices
with my pen, your life is a
pattern of opposite Vertues:
Nay to speak truly, you teach
me what to write, for when
I would picture out vices, I
set before me the contrary of
that which I behold and ad∣mire
in you, To have often
the word of God in your
hand, but more often in your
mouth; To be dayly praying;
To be adorned with modesty
without art; To open the
hand to the afflicted, and
shut the ear against vices;
To be freely religious with∣out
scruple (which makes
Christian wisdom affected
austerity) are vertues which

the greatness of your family
makes more remarkable,
and the corruption of this
age more admirable; an
age wherein vices are man∣ners,
wherein prophane
vanity and vilany become
Nature, and turn into com∣plexion;
amidst all this
darkness you shine as a Can∣dle
in the night. I know well
your modesty likes not this
discourse, but the publique
utility requires it, that all
may know what esteem we
make of vertue, and that
vices which come up of
themselves, and grow with∣out
watering, may find ar∣gument
from you either to
amend or condemne them;

this is also an honour to us,
that the sacred seed which
we sow falls upon so good a
ground, and proves so fruit∣full,
and that there are ex∣amples
among us, shewing
the difference btwixt true
Godliness, and that super∣stitious
devotion which
thinks to amuse God with
gestures, and binds it self
strictly to certain numbers
of reiterated words, and re∣duceth
Religion to the sin∣gers
end.
Having now Madam so
many just causes to present
this book unto you, yet I
durst never undertake it,
had not you commanded it.
I am not stuffed with orna∣ments

according to the di∣stastfull
humour of this age;
I cannot ruffle it out in
swelling termes, and full∣blown
bubbles of words, which
are for none but brave spi∣rits;
I cannot talk of Barri∣cadoes
of vices, or Scala∣does
of vertues, nor call
Iesus Christ the Daulphin
of heaven;As Father Cotton in his prin∣ted Medi∣tations. I do not compose
prayers upon a Fan or a
Nosegay; I am content to
speak French, and aym at
nothing but to be understood,
and in deciphring vices to
plant in mens minds the
contempt of the World, and
the love of God; in low
tearms I discourse of high
matters, and paint out light

with a coale; a fault which
partly may be imputed to
mine own dullness, partly
to my tossed and troubled
condition; It is not easy to
study among gunshot, nor to
mount the spirits high, when
a thousand things interpose
and pluck them down again
and stop their flight: But
the same your goodness
which moved you to perswade
me to write, will perswade
you to bear with my imper∣fections,
considering also
that at the first it was not my
purpose this writing should
come abroad, and therefore
I bestowed less care to dress
it: Now that it is come
forth by your command, you

shall receive it from the
hand of him who prayes to
God for the greatness and
prosperity of your thrice No∣ble
Family (which God hath
honoured with his sacred Co∣venant)
and from him
whose chief ambition is ever
to obey you, and while he lives
to be
