THE TRIVMPH of FAITH, formerly DEDICATED, and now again, for euer Consecrated to the grate-ful Memorie of the first kinde Fosterer of our tender Muses, my neuer∣sufficiently-Honored deer Vncle W. PLVMB, Esq.
For whose deer Bones we would a Toomb aduance Of Golde, and Silver, and CORINTHIAN Brasse, VVith Ivorie Pillars mixt with Iette and Rance, Rarer and richer than th' olde CARIAN's was;


And stately deck the same
With Stories of his Fame:
And round-about it wright
His Vertues shining bright:


But, sith the most of our poore Meanes (alas!) Not the least part of that Rich Pride affoords; For want of Wealth, we build a Toomb of Words:

Which (though it cost less) shall out-last
The proud cloud threatning Battlements,
Th' aspiring Spires by NILVS plaç't,
And Hell-deep-founded Monuments.

For greedy waste of Houres, that al things els deuours, Spares the sweet Maydes of sacred HELICON: And those fayre Ladyes, to their Friendes alone, This pretious Gift doo give, Still (after Death) to Live.
