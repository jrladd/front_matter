SIr, how dearely I loue you, and with what zeale I wish I could doe you seruice, I would this poore trybute of my labours could giue a true testimony, that then you might know what power you haue in a poore Creature, but since neither it, nor any lymits can bound thinges infinite, conceiue of mee according to the square of your owne Noble thoughts, which I perswade my selfe euen to aparant errours, would lend most Charitable constructions. I haue in this vo∣lume darrd a bold enterprize, the rather sith there was ne∣uer before this day moe Champions either in perfect skill, or in strong imagination of their skill, that may easily bee infla∣med to rise vp against me, but I haue chose you for one of my honorable defenders, not that you shall stand betwixt me and my hazzard, but be a meanes to bring me to an equall com∣bate, for I know my selfe to be so safely armed with Art, ex∣perience, and the grounds of reason that I feare no maligni∣ty, but an vnlawfull counsell, which to preuent, those Noble Princes and your selfe whom I haue chosen, I hope will bee my protectors, to whose mercy and gracious opinions, I pro∣strate me and my labours.
