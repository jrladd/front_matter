SIR,
NEver till I had the Ho∣nour of your Conversa∣tion, was I sensible how uneasie Ambition sits upon Mankind. This has made me labour long under the Pride of
 presenting something to your Pa∣tronage; and design'd it upon a Graver Subject than what now im∣plores your Protection. But con∣sidering the Politeness of your Learning, and that there is nothing in the whole Circle of Sciences, that has escap'd the justness and severi∣ty of your Censure, I durst not stand the Test of so nice and uni∣versal a Critick, in offering any Philosophical Essay to your View. This made me change the Design of putting off some of my imperfect Tracts under the Glory and general Approbation of your Name, in the Common-wealth of Learning, into that of Contributing to your Di∣version. A Relaxation of the Mind from more serious Studies, is often
 necessary to the largest and most vigorous Genius's; and I am sure by furnishing to your Recreation, I gratifie all that know you. Be∣sides, Sir, I fancy the fair Sex will justifie me in this Address: and there is possibly a World of La∣dies of a Noble Gentleman's Ac∣quaintance, whose Hearts, if we consulted, would tell us, with how much Justice the Disorders of Love lay Claim to his Protection. And here, Sir, an infinity of Mat∣ter presents its self for Panegyrick. And might I expatiate, I could run through a long History of the Glo∣ries of your Family; but that the World would tell me, that as the best of Families might pride themselves in your Ancestors, yet your own Vir∣tues
 are so transcendent, that the most illustrious of your Ancestors, can pride themselves in nothing more than you. And indeed, when the whole Nation was almost tainted, your Loyalty was Ermine-like. And thus you credited Arms, and Let∣ters, and Good Mien. A Plain Dealer, Sir, would tax me here, I am sure, with being wanting in your just Eulogies; but I am sure I shall never be wanting in the Zeal, Re∣spect, and Passion, wherewith I am,
Sir,
