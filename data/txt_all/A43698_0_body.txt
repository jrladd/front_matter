Right Honorable and Right Worshipful,
IF I had judged this Discourse worthy of the Press, both the general consent whereby you ho∣nour'd me with the Title of your Servant, and the particular expressions of your Favour to me, would have obliged me to publish my gratitude in this Dedication, though you had not obliged me by your Com∣mands. But since I understand how unreaso∣nably I am censured for this Discourse, and that those censures must in some manner re∣flect

upon you also, who have been pleased to afford me a more favourable Character; I find my self bound in honour, as well as in gratitude and obedience, to vindicate both you, and my self, by this Publication. The objections I need not here either repeat, or an∣swer; they are so groundless, that every ra∣tional man will be satisfied by reading the Sermon, and they which are otherwise, will not be convinced by an Epistle. Against these I humbly beg your Protection, and as in duty bound, I shall ever pray for your happiness, and Dedicate my self wholly to your service.
My Lord, and Gentlemen,
