Right worshipfull,
IT is not vnknowen vnto the most of you, that I was a long, (and the last) seruant, vnto the Right Worshipfull, Mr. THOMAS BON∣HAM Dr. of Physick; (and one of the Assi∣stants of your noble Societie,) who whilest he liued was to me a Master, yea more, a Fa∣ther, and at his death a bountifull Bene∣factor; for he gaue and deliuered vnto mee before he dyed, all his Manuscripts, both of Physicke and Chyrurgerie: the which being knowne vnto sundrie of your Societie, they requested the sight, suruey, and copies of them, or of such of them as they should best like; whereunto I yeel∣ded. But being drawne forth of the City, vnto the place where I now reside; the opportunitie of satisfying their request, and performing my promise was cut off. But not forgetting what I had promised, as leysure would permit: I gradually composed this present Worke, and haue procured it to be prest for your seruice. If there be any thing in it that may accommodate but the Iunior sort of your Societie; I shall be glad. If not; I pray you accept my loue therein, and I shall for euer rest,
