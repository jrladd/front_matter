My Lord,
THough I shall be always ready to yeild all due Deference to your Lordship's Authority, and to the Ancient Government of the City of Lon∣don, where I drew in my first Breath, and to which I have many other obligations besides, yet I shall freely own that the Character which your Lordship hath so deservedly obtain'd amongst all Good Men, hath done more then any thing else, to the engaging me to a chearful Compliance with your Lordships first Order, which appointed me to this undertak∣ing, and to that which I have since receiv'd for the Publication of what I had done therein; for it hath been always a settl'd Principle of my mind,
and which I hope I shall now never depart from, to value Men more by their Goodness then their Great∣ness, by their Virtues then their exalted Stations; especially, since I am so happy as to have all man∣kind think the same (whatever they may say or do to the Contrary, to serve a turn) as well as the Divine Oracles (which always judg aright and speak the Truth) to assert it too; for the Righteous, in whatever outward Circumstances he is plac'd, is, and always will be more excellent then his Neighbour in this World, and Infinitely more Happy in another, which that your Lordship may for ever both deserve and find, shall be the hearty Prayer of,
My Lord,
