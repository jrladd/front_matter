Most Gracious and Dread Soveraign,
MOre then twenty years are slipt
away, since I entred upon this task
of sacred Contemplations; presu∣ming
so long agoe to prefix your
Royal Name to some of the first pieces of this
long work, which I rather wished, then hoped
I might live to finish. The God of Heaven
hath been pleased to stretch out my daies so

farre as to see it brought, at last, (after many
necessary intermissions) to an happy end; Now,
not with more contentment then boldness, I
bring to your sacred hands (besides variety
of other discourses) that work complete,
whereof some few parcels saw the light be∣fore,
under subordinate Dedications. The
whole is your Majesties due, no less then the
unworthy Author; whose age pleaseth and pri∣deth
it self in nothing more, then in the title
of one of your Majesties most ancient Atten∣dants
(in my station) now living,
