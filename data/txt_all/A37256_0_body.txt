Sir,
I Do not trouble you with these Lines to flatter you, your high me∣rits and just and numerous Praises raise you above the reach of that usual indeavour of self-seeking; But to pre∣sent you with those things which re∣ceived being at first, and now pub∣lishing by you desires, as also to leave in your Hand some few short Remarks of the many large Excellen∣cies
of a near Relation of your own, whom (I know) your Nature and Conscience will invite you to imitate. What I here offer to your perusal, stands in great need of your candour, because it was drawn up under great discomposure of mind, the reason of which you will easily gess. That you may close the world as your dearest Aunt did, that is, full of days, Peace, and Honour, &c. is the most hearty Prayer of
Sir,
