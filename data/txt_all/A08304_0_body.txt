YOVR MA∣iesties
moste
gracious ac∣ceptance
of a
poore former
trauaile of mine, The Mir∣ror
for the multitude, (my
most dearely beloued So∣ueraigne)
Emboldeneth
me, once againe in al loyal
obedience, humbly to be∣seech



the same to afforde
the like gracious accep∣tance
of this Progresse vnto
heauenly harts ease: which
although it might haue
carried a more base title,
in regarde of myne vn∣worthinesse,
yet conside∣ring
the course of the trea∣tise,
and the estate of the
time, whose happines and
harts ease, is of some cen∣sured
after the quantitie
and qualitie of euerie par∣ticular
mans worldly feli∣citie,
I thought it not vn∣fit,
vnder your Maiesties
most royall protection, to
giue it that title, for that it
leadeth vnto the true



peace of the inner man:
who (howsoeuer the bo∣dy
in bodily thinges, fare
in this life) ought onelye
to bee comforted and ea∣sed
with the due contem∣plation
of Gods most di∣uine
loue, ready helpe, &
prouident regard of our
inward and outward mi∣series:
wherewith we can
not but bee touched in
some measure while wee
liue here.
And because we haue
here no continuing cittie,
but seeke one to come, it
behoueth vs to goe out of
the campe of these world∣ly



cares, and take our pro∣gresse
in the way of piety,
vnto that heauenly har∣bour
where wee shall rest
through the assurance of
Gods loue towards vs, in
this life, inwardly endued
with such ease of the hart,
and peace of conscience,
that whatsoeuer affliction
or crosse, thwart our ende∣uours,
yet shall we rest as
the Saintes of God, in a
heauenly harts ease, vntill
we come to that heauen∣ly
Cittie, newe Ierusalem,
where wee shall haue full
fruition of all happie and
heauenly hearts ease for
euer.


Now forasmuch, most
deare Queene, as that
your gracious lenitie, af∣fordeth
acceptance vnto
the least showe of loyall
loue, therby enciting ma∣nie
to shewe themselues
willing, to present their
trauailes vnto your sacred
view: I the worst and vn∣worthiest,
in all humilitie
presume to reach out the
hand of my heartie zeale,
and vnfained loue, to bee
laide euen vnder the feete
of your most sacred will
and disposition: And
woulde thinke mee your
most happiest poore sub∣iect,
might it please your



Maiestie fauourablye to
accept this my poore
Progresse.
