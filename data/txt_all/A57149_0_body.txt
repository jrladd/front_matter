Dearly Beloved,
THough I could not with
any decency decline the
Publication of this
Sermon, which had
been by you so earnestly
desired, then, when the greatnesse of
your Love and respects to my Person,
and function, did for many dayes ex∣presse
it self in a most free and noble
Reception: yet it pleased Divine
providence, by a sore visitation on my
Family, to obstruct the performance

of this Service, so long, till I might
justly have hoped to have been no more
minded of it. But being disappointed
in that hope, I now, though late, send
it forth, without altering any one Line
or period of what I then delivered.
And although it be but a very Slen∣der
Return for the great favours I re∣ceived
from you alone, yet I must
crave your leave to professe, That as
a Ring, though placed only on a finger
is yet a token of Love to the whole per∣son;
so this little Sermon, though de∣dicated
only to you, is intended as a
Testimony of that Honour & Thanks
which I owe to all Orders in this great
Diocese, for those signal and publick
favours, which, in mine attendance
on the service thereof, I every where
received. All the Answer I can

make to so great an Obligation, is dai∣ly
to pray, That the Church of Christ
in this large Diocese, may be beautifi∣ed
with the blessings of Truth and
Peace, of Vnity and Holinesse; That
the Clergy thereof may with all fide∣lity
deliver the Word of Gods grace,
and that it may by his effectual opera∣tion,
have a free and successfull pas∣sage
into the hearts and lives of the
people committed to their Charge.
And as this is the Continual Prayer,
so I hope, that through the Assistance of
Divine Grace, it shall be the unwea∣ried
Endeavour of him who desires to
approve himself
