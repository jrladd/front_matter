SIr, euer since I began to be∣stow my selfe vpō the com∣mō good, studying wher∣in my labours might bee most seruiceable; I still found they could bee no way so well improued, as

in that part which con∣cerneth deuotion, and the practise of true pie∣ty: For on the one side I perceiued the number of Polemicall bookes, ra∣ther to breede, than ende strifes; and those which are doctrinall, by reason of their multi∣tude, rather to oppresse than satisfie the Reader; wherein if we write the same things, we are iud∣ged tedious; if different, singular. On the other part respecting the Rea∣der, I sawe the braines of men neuer more stuffed,

their tōgues neuer more stirring, their hearts ne∣uer more emptie, nor their handes more idle. Wherefore after those suddē Meditatiōs which passed me without rule, I was easily induced by their successe (as a small thing moues the willing) to send foorth this Rule of Meditation; and after my Heauen vpon earth, to discourse (although by way of example) of heauen aboue. In this Arte of mine, I confesse to haue receiued more light from one obscure

namelesse Monke which wrote some 112. yeeres agoe, then from the di∣rections of all other wri∣ters: I would his humili∣ty had not made him nig∣gardly of his name, that wee might haue knowen whome to haue thanked. It had been easie to haue framed it with more cu∣riositie: But God and my soule knowe, that I made profit the scope of my labour, and not ap∣plause: and therefore (to choose) I wished ra∣ther to be rude than vn∣profitable: If now the

simplicitie of any Rea∣der, shall bereaue him of the benefite of my pre∣cepts, I knowe hee may make his vse of my ex∣ample. Why I haue hono∣red it with your name, I need not giue account to the world; which alrea∣dy knowes your worth and deserts, and shall see by this, that I acknow∣ledge them: Goe you on happily (according to the heauenly aduise of your Iunius) in your worthy and glorious profession; still bearing your selfe as one that knowes vertue

the truest nobility, and Religion the best vertue: The God whom you serue shal honor you with men, and crowne you in hea∣uen. To his grace I hum∣bly commend you: re∣questing you onely to ac∣cept the worke, and con∣tinue your fauour to the Author.
