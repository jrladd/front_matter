READER,
THOUGH the cheats of some preceding pie∣ces that trea∣ted on this subject (whose Title-pages, like the contents of a weekly Pamphlet, promised much more than the Books perfor∣med) may have provided this but a cold intertainment at its first coming abroad; yet I know it will not stay long in the world, before every ra∣tionall Reader will cleare it of all alliance to those false pre∣tenders. Ladies, forgive my

confidence if I tell you, that I know this piece will prove your favourite; and if any thing displeases you, it will be to see so many uncommon, and undeflour'd Receipts pro∣stituted to the publique view, which perchance you will think might have been plac'd better among the paper-se∣crets in a few of your Cabi∣nets; but 'tis easie to pardon that offence, which is onely committed in favour of the Common good. I could say, that the skilfullest professors of either Art need not blush to take out new lessons from hence, but 'tis not safe to pre∣possesse and bespeak expecta∣tion.
Farewell.
