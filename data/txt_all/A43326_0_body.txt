SIR,
THis Account of the greatest DISCOVERY that has been made in this Age, of several Large Countries, situate between the Frozen Sea and New Mexico, I make bold humbly to Dedicate to your Ma∣jesty. Having liv'd Eleven Years in the Northern America, I have had an Opportunity to penetrate farther into that Unknown Continent than any before me; wherein I have discover'd New Countries, which may be justly call'd the Delights of that New World.

They are larger than Europe, water'd with an infinite number of fine Ri∣vers, the Course of one of which is above 800 Leagues long, stock'd with all sorts of harmless Beasts, and other Things necessary for the Con∣veniency of Life; and bless'd with so mild a Temperature of the Air, that nothing is there wanting to lay the Foundation of one of the Greatest Empires in the World.
I should think my self very happy, and sufficiently Rewarded for my La∣borious Travels, if they could any ways contribute to make those Coun∣tries better known, under the Glo∣rious Name of your Majesty; and if through your Royal Protection I might serve as Guide to your Subjects, to carry into those Parts the Light of the Gospel, and the Fame of your He∣roical Virtues: My name would be bless'd amongst those numerous Na∣tions, who live without Laws and Re∣ligion, only because no body endea∣vours

to instruct them; and they would have the Happiness of being Converted to the Christian Faith, and the Advantage of seeing at the same time their Fierceness and Rude Man∣ners softned and civiliz'd, by the Com∣merce of a Polite and Generous Na∣tion, Rul'd by the most Magnani∣mous King in the World.
This Enterprize is worthy of your Majesty, who never Frames but Noble Designs, and pursues them with such a Prudence and Vigour, that they are always crown'd with a Glorious Suc∣cess.
I dare not presume to give here a particular Account of what your Majesty's unparallell'd Valour and Prudence have done for the Felicity of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the United Provinces; the Happiness of your Kingdoms, and the Mildness of your Majesty's Government, proclaim that Truth to all th World, as also the Tranquility of the United Nether∣lands,

amidst a dreadful War, which ravages most Parts of Europe. Your Majesty drove back a formidable Ene∣my, who had penetrated into their very Heart, and keeps him since at such a distance, that they have no∣thing to fear from his Ambitious De∣signs.
The rest of Europe is no less inde∣bted to your Majesty than your own Kingdoms and the United Netherlands; for your Majesty exposes every Year your Life, at the Head of your Ar∣mies and Theirs, to protect their Coun∣try and preserve their Liberties from a fatal Invasion. The Allies know, and own with Gratitude, That your Maje∣sty's Prudence, and the great Respect which so many Princes have for your Personal Merit, are the only Cement that was able to maintain the Great Alliance, wherein Europe is enter'd for its Preservation.
Your Majesty's Glorious Atchieve∣ments being a Theme above my Pen,

I must not presume to speak of them; but my Religion obliges me to men∣tion what I have seen with my own Eyes, and publish to all the World, That I have seen your Majesty Pre∣serving, with the utmost Care, Our Churches in the Netherlands, while Others, who, by a Principle of Con∣science, were oblig'd to Protect them, left them expos'd to the Inso∣lence of their Soldiers, violating in the face of the Sun the Respect all Christians owe them.
It is this great Generosity and Equi∣ty of your Majesty, as much as your other incomparable Exploits, which have gain'd you the Esteem and the Hearts of all Christian Princes, one alone▪ excepted; and have engag'd the King of Spain my lawful Sove∣reign, the most Catholick Prince in the World, to make so strict an Al∣liance with your Majesty.
That Great Monarch being too re∣mote from the Netherlands to defend

his Dominions, has found in your Majesty a Valiant and Trusty De∣fender; who being Seconded by the Invincible Elector of Bavaria, protects the Spanish Dominions against a Prince who makes all possible Efforts to deprive his Catholick Majesty there∣of, notwithstanding their Proximity of Blood, and his Professing the Same Religion.
His Catholick Majesty having therefore so often experienc'd that your Majesty's Royal Word is more firm than other Princes Treaties and Solemn Oaths, could not also but leave his Dominions to your Dis∣posal; shewing by that unparal∣lell'd Piece of Trust, how much he relies upon your Majesty's Honour, and what Esteem he has for your Royal Vertues, which are mix'd with no manner of Imperfections.
I don't question but many, out of Envy or Malice, will blame me for entring into your Majesty's Service;

but I care very little for what they say, since it is by the Permission of his Ca∣tholick Majesty, the Elector of Bava∣ria, and the Superiors of my Order. I design to keep the Integrity of my Faith, and serve Faithfully the Great Monarch who has Honour'd me with his Royal Protection. I owe my Services to the Generous Protector of my Country and of our Altars, who besides has so kindly receiv'd me at his Court, while other Princes neglect∣ed me, or forbade me their Presence. It is then out of Gratitude that I devote my self to your Majesty's Service, and in order to contribute to the Con∣version of the several Nations I have discover'd, and to the Advantage of your Subjects, if they will improve this Opportunity, and make Planta∣tions in a Country, which is so fertile as to afford Two Crops every Year.
The Gentleman with whom I be∣gan this Discovery, had form'd Great Designs, and especially upon the

Mines of St. Barbe in New Mexico; but his Tragical Death prevented their execution.
I humbly beseech your Majesty to accept this Publick Mark of my Respect and Gratitude; having pray'd the Almighty for the Preservation of your Sacred Majesty's Person, and the Prosperity of your Reign, I beg leave to subscribe my self, with all the Submission and Respect ima∣ginable,
SIR,
