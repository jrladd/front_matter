My Lord,
THis Sermon, which was Preached at Your Lordships Command, and Printed at the Request of Your Clergy, naturally flyes to the Altar for Protection; and if it may be allowed to take Sanctuary there, it will not fear the Censure or Assaults of any Adversaries. The subject matter of it being concerning Spiritual Gifts, 'tis in a manner intituled to the Care and Patronage of Spiritual Persons; and especially of Your Lordship, who is deservedly placed in the highest Rank and Order of them. If any Evil Spirits shall arise, and oppose these Gifts of the Holy Ghost, as Jannes and Jambres of old withstood Moses, and Simon Magus and others resisted the Apostles, we need not doubt but the Author of them will help us to defend the Argument, and the Finger of God will elude the Ma∣gical Enchantments both of Atheism and Enthusiasme.
If this Discourse may any ways help forward the right use of these Spiritual Gifts; if it may serve to correct the
Abuse of them in some, or to discountenance the vain Pre∣tences to them in others, it may perhaps prove one of the Best Gifts that could be Presented to the Church by one of the meanest Well-wishers to it.
My Lord,
I have Obeyed Your Lordships Command, which the Obligations of Duty and Gratitude must ever make me willing and ready to do.
That all Your Clergy may Reverence and Obey Your Lord∣ship as their Spiritual Father, and that Your Lordship may long continue to be a Blessing and Support to Your Clergy, is the Hearty Prayer of,
My Lord,
