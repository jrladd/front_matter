MADAM,
SInce the Divine Providence hath been pleased to bind up the great breaches of my little fortune by your Charity and Nobleness of a religious tenderness, I account it an excellent circumstance and handsome∣ness of condition, that I have the fortune of S. Atha∣nasius, to have my Persecution relieved and comforted by an Honou∣rable and Excellent Lady; and I have nothing to return for this honour done to me, but to do as the poor Paralyticks and infirm people in the Gospel did when our Blessed Saviour cured them, they went and told it to all the Countrey, and made the Vicinage full of the report, as themselves were of health and joy. And although I know the modesty of your person and Religion had rather do favours than own them, yet give me leave to draw aside the curtain and re∣tirement of your Charity; for I had rather your vertue should blush, than my unthankfulness make me ashamed. Madam, I intended by this Address not onely to return you spirituals for your temporal's, but to make your noble usages of me and mine to become, like your other Charities, productive of advantages to the standers by. For although the beams of the Sun reflected from a marble return not home to the body and fountain of light; yet they that walk below feel the be∣nefit of a doubled heat: so whatever reflexions or returns of your Favours I can make, although they fall short of what your Worth does most reasonably challenge, and can proceed but towards you with for∣ward desires and distant approaches; yet I am desirous to believe that those who walk between us may receive assistences from this entercourse, and the following Papers may be auxiliary to the enkindling of their Piety, as to the confirming and establishing yours. For although the great Prudence of your most Noble Lord, and the modesties of your own temperate and sweeter dispositions, become the great endearments

of Vertue to you; yet because it is necessary that you make Religion the business of your life, I thought it not an impertinent application, to express my thankfulness to your Honour by that which may best become my duty and my gratitude, because it may do you the greatest service. Madam, I must beg your pardon, that I have opened the sanctuary of your retired Vertues; but I was obliged to publish the endearments and favours of your Noble Lord and your self towards me and my re∣latives: For as your hands are so clasp'd, that one Ring is the ligature of them both; so I have found emanations from that conjuncture of hands with a consent so forward and apt, that nothing can satisfie for my obligations, but by being, in the greatest eminency of thank∣fulness and humility of person,
MADAM,
