LEarned and honourable Gentlemen, whose kind and fauourable acceptance of my late discourse of the life and death of Peirs Gaueston, hath emboldened mee, to publish this tragicall Historie of my Ma∣tilda, which otherwise, the fonde censures of the sottish and absurd ignorant had alto∣gether discouraged me: (of those detract∣ors I meane,) who without iudgement of reading, haue rashlie and iniuriously wronged the most rare & excellent men who haue written in this age wherein wee liue. They themselues, eyther wanting the vse of those tongues, which as the keyes of knowledge vnlock the treasurie of most rarest inuention, or els theyr dull eyes, so ouer-clowded with mistie ignorance, as neuer able to looke into celestiall secrets of diuine Poesie, thereby to discerne the right and true method of a perfect and exquisite Poeme.
And yet, such is the folly and shamelesse impudencie of some, (as wee see euery day,) which in their wanton and adultrate con∣ceits, bring forth such vgly Monsters, as a modest and sober eye, can hardly abide to view their deformities. Then it is no meruaile though the diuine Muses, take so small delight in our Clime, fin∣ding their sweet and pleasant fields, which should be holy and sa∣cred, defiled, and polluted, with such lothsome ordure. And al∣though there be many, furnished with sundry sorts of good lear∣ning, yet wanting that diuine touch and heauenlie instinct which giueth life to inuention, doe basely disgrace that, wherein theyr owne experience tells them, they bee altogether ignorant. But onely to you, excellently qualified, and rare accomplish'd Gen∣tlemen, the true heyres of the Muses, I consecrate my labours, whose wise and discreet censures, haue heeretofore made knowne to me, the true perfection of your owne honorable dispositions: & onely to you Matilda committeth her short discourse.
