May it please Your Majesty,
THE Title of De∣fender of the Faith, is so inherent in the Royal Dignity, and so essen∣tial a part of its security as well as of its glory, that there was no need of Papal Bulls

to add it to the Crown that Your MAJESTY now wears: You hold it by a much better Tenure, as well as by a more ancient Possession. Nor can one reflect on the Pope's gi∣ving it to King Henry the VIIIth, without remembring what is said of Caiaphas, that being High Priest that year, he Prophesied. For since that time, the true Faith hath been so eminently Defended by our Princes, and that of both Sexes, we having had our Pulcheria's as well as our Con∣stantine's and our Theodose's, that this Church has been all along the chief strength and

honour of the Reformation, as well as the main Object of the envy and spite of those of the Roman Communion.
But tho Your MAJESTY'S Royal Ancestors have done so much for us, there remains yet a great deal to be done for the compleating of our Reformation, especially as to the Lives and Manners of men. This will most effe∣ctually be done by obliging the Clergy to be more exem∣plary in their Lives, and more diligent and faithful in the dis∣charge of their Pastoral Duty. And this Work seems to be reserved for Your MAJE∣STIES,

and designed to be the Felicity and Glory of Your Reign. To serve God by promoting this Great and Glorious Design, which is so truly worthy of Your MA∣JESTY'S best care and endea∣vours, I have purposely writ∣ten this Treatise, which I do with all humility Dedicate and present to Your Sacred MA∣JESTY.
May that God who is the King of kings, and hath bless'd us with Two such Excellent Princes, preserve You Both long to us, and make You as happy in us, as we are in You▪ May You Reign over

us till You have accomplish∣ed all those Great Designs for which God hath raised You up, and with which He hath filled Your Hearts: And may this Church be made by Your means the Perfection of Beauty, and the Ioy of the whole Earth.
These are the daily and most fervent Prayers of,
May it please Your MAJESTY,
