RIGHT HONORABLE,
THE Lords Supper being commonly tearmed by
Divines, both in their Writings and Sermons
(though never by the spirit of God in sacred
Writ) a Sacrament, and a Seale; yea, Gods
GREAT SEALE of Grace, and of the Cove∣nant
of Grace; wher of our Syon Colledg Mini∣sters
now preted themselves the divine LORD KEEPERS, asserting
that by the will and appointment of Jesus Christ himself, they
have both Commission and Authority to suspend al such whom
they shall deem Ignorant or Scandalous from this SEALE (though
they earnestly thirst & hunger after it, and be not actually excō∣municated
from any other publicke Ordinance, or the society of
Christians:) I conceived I could not so fitly Dedicate this Briefe
Examination and Refutation of their Divine claim and new In∣stitution
of sole suspention from the Sacrament (so much contest∣ed
for) to any others, as to Your Honors, the present Commissio∣ners
for the Custody of THE GREAT SEAL OF ENGLAND;
to whose Noble Patronage I humbly recommend it, so farre forth
onely as it shall appear to be consonant to the Word of Truth.
My little Treatise, intituled, The opening of the Great Seale
of England, was, through Gods blessing on it, one speciall meanes of
passing the first Ordinance for the New great Seale of England,
which hath ever since continued in your keeping; and I have some
good hopes, that by the like divine Benediction on this smaller
Pamphlet, the Lords Supper (the GREAT SEAL OF HEA∣VEN,
as many stile it) shall be opened, and communicated to many
poore soules cordially desirous to receive it, who otherwise might
have most injuriously (by colour of the pretended Will and ap∣pointment
of Jesus Christ) been suspended from it.

Where this Will and Appointment of Christ is to be found in
Scripture, it rests on the Divines of Syon-Colledge to demon∣strate;
for my part, after many diligent inquiries to find it out either
in the old or new Testament, I alwayes returned with a Non est
inventus: only this I have observed in my reading, that when ever
any matters of Ecclesiasticall or Pontificall Jurisdiction have
come to be debated, the Clergy in all Ages have made very strange
Interpretations and perversions of Scripture to maintaine their
pretended Divine Authority. What ridiculous Inferences the
Popes of Rome, with their Parasites have published in print to
support their usurped Antichristian supremacy over all Bishops,
Churches and Kings themselves, from, Thou art Peter; arise Pe∣ter
kill and eat; Lanch out into the deep; Feed my sheepe; God
made two great lights; Behold, here are two swords: Ye shall
find an Asse and a Colt tyed, loose them and bring them hither:
Tell it to the Church, &c. is known to all who peruse their Books of
this controversie; Whether some of our Divines have not incurred
the like solecismes, and made almost as grose Misapplications of
Scripture as they, in maintenance of their new Church-govern∣ment
and Discipline, I submit to the determination of such who
without partiality have perused their lae Discourses of that sub∣ject:
For my part, having neither any private interest nor Design
to misbyas my judgment,2 Cor. 3. 8 I a can (I dare) do nothing against the
Truth, but for the Truth in this present controversie. My im∣partiall
debate whereof, though it may displease some, will I trust
conduce much to the settlement of our publike peace (which the
unhappy controversies about Church-government have disturb∣ed)
and find acceptance with all lovers of Truth in generall, and
your Honours in particular, from the hands
