MAdam: This simple Treatise is yours in al right; therefore it of∣fers it selfe and its ser∣uice vnto you: But at your request, it had not been preached, where it was; But for your importuni∣tie (you know well) it had much lesse been printed, as it is. Seeing it is yours, I beseech you accept it, and make much of it, and (if it be fit for so good a purpose) make much vse of it. Howsoeuer, I pray you continue to wish well to him that sends it, who doth much approue of your
graces, and respect your person, and will alwaies continue to pray for the wel∣fare of your selfe, and all yours, resting euer,
