HOLY SIR,
I Do here, with all imaginable Deference and Humility, pre∣sent you (I will not be so un∣mannerly as to say, with a Pig of your own Sow, but) with a Rich Cabinet, and good reason too, be∣cause your own: for 'tis unjust that you should be the Proprietor, and another the Usufructuary. A
 Cabinet, wherein are display'd all the commendable Qualifications, and inimitable Perfections of some of your Famous Predecessors, that have had the Honour to sit in St. Pe∣ter's Chair; and in some particu∣lars, a weak Character or Adum∣bration of your Holiness's Endow∣ments, which no Pen can fully de∣lineate. Nor can you any way complain of foul play herein, since this Tract contains no Quo∣tations but what are collected from the most Authentic and rigid Ro∣manists that ever espoused the Ca∣tholic Cause and Persuasion.
The Candid Reader, by a seri∣ous perusal of this Treatise, will, I presume, not onely receive sa∣tisfaction thereby, but also make a Discovery of those rare Vertues
 which embellish the minds of St. Peter's Successors, more to their re∣nown and Glory, than the resplen∣dent Diamonds and Rubies that shine in, and adorn the Triple Diadem; and therefore, I hope, that your Sanctity will leave the Author out when you presume to Curse all Hereticks (as you miscall them) once a Year in the Bulla Coenae; or otherwise you shall hear of him agen in a more Sar∣castic Style and Satyrick Humour, this being only at present Joco∣serious. If any thing herein clinch too close, and offend; let those of your own Party beg your pardon, (whose Duty it is) that afforded the Materials, which, compiled together and collected, make up this Epitome of your Memorable
 Acts and Monumental Transacti∣ons. But withall, I must needs confess, that no Bigoted Prote∣stant, who moves in the highest Sphere of Ecclesiastical Dignity, dares presume or pretend to ar∣rive to the height of those Excel∣lencies herein mentioned, which are only peculiar to the Roman Miter. If the subordinate Clergy storm at the Contents of this Book, let them thank themselves for ex∣posing to the Public their Cheats and Chicaneries so apparently, that an inconsiderable Lay-Prote∣stant could not possibly avoid ta∣king notice of, he being only the Amanuensis of their own Authors, and hath taken the pains to trans∣scribe out of them such Memorials as he thought convenient to reduce
 to the Method observ'd in this small System or Collection. I be∣queath this Aurea Legenda to your Holiness first, and then to the rest of the Inferiour Clergy; it being a Brat of their own Brain, a Babe of their own Procreation; and so bid you all farewel, who sub∣scribe my self
