SIR,
THE great Actions of worthie and eminent
Persons, haue ever been esteemed so powerfull
for the instruction of succeeding times, that all
Civill States haue made it their principall
care, to preserue and transmit them to Poste∣ritie,
for their Example and Imitation. The Meanes by
which this is done, is HISTORY, a powerfull suggester and
Recorder of Gods providence in publike Blessings and Iudge∣ments,
the Mother of Experience, the Nurse of Truth, the
common bond and ligature, which unites present times with all
ages past, and makes them one. To manifest this, if othr
Arguments fayle, the Examples of the greatest Emperors and
Generalls were sufficient, who in the midst of their Conquests,
thought their publike dutie not discharged, if they imployed
not some time, to leaue the immortall memory of their owne
actions by writing to Posteritie. The omission of this hath bin
a great defect of some ages foregoing ours, being the Middle
times betweene learned Antiquitie and this latter age, wherein
Language, Arts and Elegancie haue revived and flourished;
In those times though there haue been many, Qui fecerunt
scribenda, yet there were few, qui describerent facta. I dare
not say that this our. Age and Nation are guiltie of the like
errour or negligence, in deciphering to the life the occurrences
of our owne times and affayres by such as best knew, and faith∣fully

would relate them; A want of which many haue com∣plained,
but few haue laboured to supply. That which I now
in all humilitie present, is your Majesties by many Titles;
First, from the subject matter, being the finall Dispersion of
that cloud of Rebellion, which hath so long hung over that
Kingdome of Ireland, which by undoubted title, and lawfull
succession is descended to your Majestie, and that performed
by the prudent fortitude of the English Nation, which your
Majestie now so happily governes. Next, from your Ma∣jesties
late faithfull Servant, the Earle of Totnes, whose Acti∣ons
are not the least part of the Argument of this Historie,
hee being at that time chiefe Governour of the Province of
Mounster, which was the Stage whereon the last and greatest
Scene of that Tragedie was acted, and since advanced by your
Majesties Royall Father and your selfe to many Honourable
Titles and Imployments of State. And lastly, from the Pub∣lisher,
through whose hands nothing can passe, which to your
Majestie is not justly due, both by common All geance, and
particular Service. Pardon (gracious Soveraigne) this pre∣sumption,
in aspiring to so high a Patronage, and graciously ac∣cept
this poore Tribute of Dutie and thankefulnesse from him
who hath eternally bound himselfe
