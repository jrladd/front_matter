MY LORDS;
I Have observed, that long Epi∣stles
are as little pleasing as
long Sermons; and therefore
shall not be troublesome by a
tedious Dedication: Onely your Lord∣ships
may please to take notice, that this
Sermon, which is now Printed in obedience
to your Order, before it goes forth to pub∣like
view, comes first to be Presented to
your Honours. It is sufficient assurance
of acceptance and countenance, that your

Lordships pleasure is to have it published.
If now this little sparke, or rather al∣most
dead coale; shall give the least
light or heat to any heart, that shall vouch∣safe
to reade it; and hereby any accession
may be made, to the praise, or to the fear
of This glorious and fearfull Name,Deut. 28. 58.
THE LORD OƲR GOD: It is
that which is desired, and as much as can
be expected by,
MY LORDS,
Your Honours most unworthy
Servant in the work of the Ministery,
