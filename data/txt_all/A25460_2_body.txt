Gentlemen and in Christ dearly Beloved▪
WHat I first entered upon about three years ago in another place,Weston. Octo. 25, 1657. I brought to perfection within these few days in your audience; and truly for their sakes for whom the foundation was layed, was the roofe chiefely fitted and squared.
I am emboldned to affix your names to this trea∣tise, judgeing that as your patience and charity gave it hearing from the pulpit attentively, your zeal and affection, will entertaine it from the presse kindly.
It happened to be your lot (after the nations un∣settlement) to receive orders, for providing me a book of Common-prayer, as a means judged by our superiors for the Churches tranquillity: you hve here in a few words that book defended, by which our submission, (not for necessity but for conscience) unto it may be justified, and God be praised, that he was pleased to give you that honour, as in the least to be helpers in a publick way of that distressed Church, into whose doctrine you were baptized.
Enter into this treatise and learn how to behave your selves in prayer, to God and men, and for men to God, and to some men chiefly for God, and to all men in God, that with all Saints you may be glori∣fied by God, unto which end, he shall further con∣tribute his prayers and endeavours who is.
