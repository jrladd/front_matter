With this regarde, J haue distinc∣tiuely bundled them vp into a catologue volume, accompanied with a more liberall & enlarged choice then hath at any time as yet come to your refined eares: and withal, haue now made bould to present them as things not altogether vnnecessary to doe you pleasing seruice, but also to liue and dwell with you vnder the protection of your good allowance, and the testimo∣nie of my euer-bounden thankefulnes. And as they are in number many, so are they of nature variable to please vari∣able natures: & yet doe they al meete in consente hermonical deseruinglie to winne your onlie good acceptance and liking: wherin I shall hold my selfe richlie satisfied, & euer rest.
