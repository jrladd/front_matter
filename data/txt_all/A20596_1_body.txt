MY Lord, being dsirous to warrant a protect my selfe, fro the iniurie and repro of false French-mē, vder your inexpugna shielde that are so great a Prince and Prela most faithfull to God, the King & the esta which by diuine grace is now (though wi mighty and trouble-some trauerses) in yo most noble and royall House: your genersitie and kindnes, excusing me frō the tear of ouer-bold: prouoked me, peraduentu some-what rashly (hauing enterprised witout your knowledge) to addresse this dcourse to you; For this cause, to with-stan such as will immediatly cry nothing but 

reique, vnder shadow of making passage to th, as being cloaked with the habit of holi∣es & religiō: betray God, to whose seruice ey are vowed, in sporting with their swords  the seruice of the deuill, father of dissenti∣, and author of blood-sheds and murders. herby we may euidētly discerne, that they ue no part of religion but the habit, & that y abuse their profession, seeing that with∣t any feare of God or the Magistrate, & to  great disgrace of Christian religion: they mbat for the earth with material Armes, &  for heauen with spiritual forces. I beseech good men, that duly vnder this habit make ofession of Christian Catholique religion,  to make a scandale of it, seeing that kee∣ng this pure whitenes, the humility & sim∣city of their forefathers, & not contending war otherwise then vnder the Ensigne of rist Iesus, they cannot heere sustaine any derance: protesting, that hetherto I haue  in Christian religion, & therein wil per∣seuere

so long as God giues me grace.
As for the rest of my discourse, touchi the prayses and Trophies of our victorio Prince, & the obedience (which I haue prued by scripture) his subiects owe him of dtie, what-soeuer pretence the Leaguers opose: I thinke there is no one, if he be not uer passionate, an Anti-catholique or Spnyarde (as are these zealous murderers a theeues of the rebellious vnitie) that can will speake against it. If there be any one  hardy, as dare produce any false inductio on the behalfe of the rebellion of these fa French-men, to beate down the estate roy or to vse any collour against your royal ho (which they attache with a false semblance  shew of religion) by estranging, or stayni the French Nobility, that stand in defence  theyr King: the sword of this great and mananimous Prince, put into his hande by t highest puissaunce, shall quayle (by his ayd all such shyfts, scourge the Rebels, vp-hol

 estate, and preserue the florishing No∣esse, that with so good hart doe follow his ruice.
And if these Armes will deigne to admit e assistance of the penne, there are so many rned and faithfull for his Maiestie, as soone ll dysprooue such false propositions: God ding, whom (my Lord) I pray to preserue d keepe you, as an ornament and piller of s Church, the good of this estate, so vexed d afflicted by the Stranger: as also the ma∣ging of his affayres (which so neerely con∣rnes you) for the seruice of his Maiestie.
From Toures the 27. of February. 1592.
