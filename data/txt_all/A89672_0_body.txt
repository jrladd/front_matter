May it please your Grace,
I Having begged Protection for the former Part of this mean Perfor∣mance, under the Ʋmbrage of Your late Dear Friend, and our good Bishop, I presume to lay the Second Part at your Grace's Feet, whom God has made next under himself; the Succourer of his Afflicted Family. And I humbly

pray, That You would be pleased to add one more Token of your Respect to the Memory of that Admirable Per∣son, as favourably to accept this poor Present from one of his Ʋndeserving Friends. This, My Lord, I address to Your Grace, with all Heartiness and Sincerity, and with the humblest Thanks for your kindness to the Rela∣tions of my Ʋnfortunate Diocesan, and for Your Assistance in getting his Sta∣tion, in the Church, supplied by so excellent a Successour, thereby mitiga∣ting the unspeakable Loss, sustained by the whole Diocese, and, in parti∣cular, by,
My Lord,
