MADAME,
HAVING ma∣ny yeares since, more by prayer then study, gathered this Posy of Hea∣uenly flowers, from the Mir∣rhy high Mountayne of our
 Sauiours Passion, to sweeten chiefly, and delight my owne Soule, with deuout reuiew∣ings, and memories thereof; I haue at length, by the ad∣uise of worthy Friends, ad∣uentured, for the good also of others, to publish the same; with an especiall desire to in∣crease deuotion, by its often perusing, in You, & Yours: To whome therfore, I haue presumed to direct it, as a friend, obliged, and desirous to serue your Honour, and Them, in all he may.
