May it please your Honor,
CVstom hath made it usual (if not necessary) on the new year, to offer some signal of duty. No∣thing of mine is worthy acce∣ptance: but the engagement of Christ to reward wise and faithfull service, is, though transcrib'd by a hand not onely vveak but defective. On this account (as an ac∣knovvledgment of many debts vvherein I stand bound to your Honor) I presume on this Dedication, or rather Oblation.
Sir, This Sermon vvas a child of obedience to his Excellency's and the Council's Order; at its first birth entertain'd like children, vvith regard or not, as love is borne or not borne to the parents; and novv layd open to pub∣lick vievv, because the face gives clearer evi∣dence than the voice, and the eye a faithfuller verdict, than the ear. Though its subject
 matter needs not to seek a Patron (for Magna est Veritas; vvho can do ought (eventually) a∣gainst the Truth?) yet the author having tasted the bitterness of persecution by both the ex∣treams, and observing the same Spirit (though in new cloaths) attempting to act still; pre∣sumes to publish it, (which is now charged as his great crime) and to present it to your Honor, whom the World knovvs too just to acquit the nocent, and too charitable to con∣demn the innocent; and whom the Author confesseth his no less good than great friend, (pardon the expression) and therefore is glad of any occasion solemnly to profess himself,
(Right Honorable!)
