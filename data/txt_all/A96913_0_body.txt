SIR,
FOr asmuch as you have caused great searching of heart, and di∣visions among many of Gods People by a sudden, strange, and un∣expected alteration of Government, and other actions to the great astonishment of those who knew your former publick Resolutions and Declarations; considering also, how (contrary to foregoing Acts and Engagements) you have taken upon you a Power by which you are utterly disinabled (if there were in you a heart) to prose∣cute the good things Covenanted and contended for, with so many great hazards, and the effusion of so much precious blood: and by reason whereof you are become justly suspected in your ends in time past, and actions for future to very many of those, of whose affecti∣ons and faithfull services, you have enjoyed no small share, in all
the difficult passages and enterprizes of the late War. These things considered by us, (as we know they are by many Churches & Saints) and there being a deep sence upon our Spirits of the Odium, under which the name of Christ, his Cause, People and wayes do lye (as it were) buried; and also of the exceeding contempt which the won∣derfull and excellent operations of God are brought into; even those eminent wonders, which the Nations have been Spectators and witnesses of, and wherein your hands have been partly engaged; We cannot after much serious consideration and seeking of the Lord, many of us, both together and a part, but present to your hands the ensuing testimony, wch (however you may look theron) is no more then necessity exacts from us, for the clearing of our own Souls from guilt and discharging of our duty to God & men. Therefore we ear∣nestly wish you to peruse and weigh it, as in the sight of God, with a calm and Christian like Spirit, and harden not your neck against the truth as you will answer it to the great judge, before whose impar∣tial Tribunal you (as well as we shalbe very shortly cited to give an account of the things done in the body, whether good or evill. Where the true motives and ends of all your Actions will be evident, where no apologie will be accepted of, your slighting and blasphem∣ing of the Spirit of God, nor for the hard measure you give his peo∣ple, by reproaches, imprisonment and other oppressions; and where Pride, Luxury, Lasciviousnesse, changing of Principles and forsaking the good wayes, justice and holinesse will not have the smallest rag of pretence to hide them from the eyes of the Judge: Which things (whatsoever you say for your self) are (even at present) to be read in your Fore head, and have produced most sad effects every where. Especially, first, The filling of the Saints hearts and faces with inex∣pressable grief and shame: And secondly, The stopping (at least) of the strong current of their Prayers, which was once for you; if not the turning thereof directly against you. To these we might adde (thirdly, The hardening of wicked men, yea the refreshing and justi∣fying of them in their evill doings, and speaking against the Gospel, Name, and Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ. And lastly, Gods signall withdrawing from you and your designs. Oh then! that you would¦ly down in the dust & acknowledge your iniquity, and return unto the Lord by unfeigned repentance, doing your first works, and that you would make hast to do so, least Gods fury break forth like fire upon you, and there be no quenching of it. This would rejoyce us much, as being reall welwishers to your souls everlasting happinesse, though we must declare with equall pity and detestation against your designes and way.
