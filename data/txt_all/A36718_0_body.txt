THe Famous Chi∣nois
comes, as
obliged, to∣waite
upon you
in a habit of
English phrase: putting
him into which I have in
the general taken patern,
measure and materials from
that which was some years
since made him in Frenth

by Monsieur Du Ball;
but, (if I may say so
without suspicion, of arro∣gating
or detracting as well
as without guilt of it) not
without more pains in
particulars than Transla∣tours
commonly take, or
else use to have ascribed
to them. I have thus em∣ployed
some months, because
I have not had opportuni∣ty
of atcheiving more ele∣vated
studies, because I
would not for my own sa∣tisfaction
leave unfinisht
what I was by the com∣mendation
of others indu∣ced
to begin, and because

though there are abroad se∣veral
historicall discourses
very ravishingly and ad∣vantageously
composed of
Loves and Gallantries, they
for the most part have come
out of the shop of inventive
fansy, but this under a
Romanticke colour and fa∣shion
records not only very
considerable traverses and
events of the same kinde,
but those also as true as
considerable, and no where
else to be found. Whether
my pains are worth either
their own time, or that of
perusing them, I submit
to your examination and

judgement, whose sageness
and Candour together with
the other transcending be∣auties,
which shine in you, in
a high degree concile to you
the admirations and obser∣vances
of all that know
you, but of none in a higher,
than of Eleutherius.
