BRethren, my hearts
desire for this our
Israel, is, that it
may be saued: Saued tem∣porally,
saued eternally.
And from the abundance
of this desire in my heart,
my mouth speaketh. True
it is, that I am not willing
to encrease the vnnecessary
burthen of words, vnder
which the world groneth;

yet therefore necessarie
words may not be retained.
And as I said in the for∣mer,
so may I not say yet
in this latter, Is there not
a cause? Is there not yet a
cause to take more physick,
as long as there are yet
more diseases? Neuerthe∣lesse,
these are thrifty ad∣ditions,
both in measure &
manner. That is added
which seemeth to bee neces∣sary;
and where things are
already done, men are di∣rected
to fetch new health
out of old Medicines. But
indeed a Medicine should
not be accounted old as our

Fashionists terme oldnesse,
as long as new health is to
be gotten out of it. In bo∣dily
sicknesse, a man will
not loathe a Medicine that
can cure him, because hee
knowes it: much lesse will
hee auoide to bee throughly
recouered by it, because in
part thereby hee hath beene
already recouered. And
least of all should any man
thinke, that the reading of
a Receipt without the ta∣king
of it, is able to cure
him. This were to vse it
for a Charme, and not for
a Medicine. Yet the fashi∣on
of men now a dayes, is in

these kindes most vnreaso∣nable,
and most lamentably
to their owne losse: For
they reade things profita∣ble,
only for pleasure; and
so being content with a va∣nishing
shadow; they wil∣lingly
lose a solid and sub∣stantiall
good. The plea∣sure
of newnesse, or some
handsome shape, wherein
wholsome matter doth ap∣peare,
is the tentation of
their reading. But this is
the very folly of children,
who loue to play with guil∣ded
Pills, because they are
guilded, but will not take
them as Pills, or meanes of

health. Surely, I wish that
these men who professe
to hate oldnesse, would
hate this fashion; for it is
an old one, euen as old, as
the captiuity of Israel.
Thou art vnto them as
a very louely Song of
one that hath a pleasant
voyce,Ezek. 33. 32. and can play well
on an Instrument; for
they heare thy words,
but they doe them not.
But though this wanton∣nesse
may fall out in health,
yet it ill becomes sicknesse.
Wherefore let men consi∣der
whether they haue any
griefe, or not; and if they

haue, let them leaue their
playing with physicke, and
fall to taking of it. Espe∣cally
physicke, which is so
confirmed by proofe, that
of all those that haue taken
it soundly, none did euer
perish.
