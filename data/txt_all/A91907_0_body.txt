Honoured and Right Worshipful.
IT will not (I hope) be thought strange, but Duty, if (a∣mongst the many that are cordial∣ly affected towards you) I also bring my Mite into your Trea∣sury; unto which all that know you, and can distinguish true worth and goodness from a seem∣ing shew, or a meer popular gloss, cannot but pay the Tribute of their due respects.
As for this present addres here made unto you; your singu∣lar integrity and fidelity to th publick, your true affection to soli and undissembled Piety, your un∣tainted Loyalty to the Prince, your Love and Nobleness to the Church, (so well known) and lastly, your many favours and counte∣nance, not only to those of my Function in general, but to my self in particular, are all such as justly entitle you to the sub∣ject of this following Discourse; you being that in your lesser Sphere, which our Gracious So∣vereign is, in his higher and lar∣ger, A true Nursing Father. God of his goodness encrease the Gifts and Graces of your mind, and the number of your Imita∣tors.
May the Vertues of your Soul (in despight of that Veil that would hide them) prove more and more conspicuous, like the Sta∣tues of those two Romans of old, which the more they were concealed and covered from the publick sight, were but the more taken notice of.
May the fatness of the Earth be your lot, and may the Dews and Blessings of Heaven fall here and ever upon you and yours, so as to redound to Gods Glory, to the publick good, and to your own inward comfort and eternal reward. So prays your unfeign∣ed Orator at the Throne of Grace, and faithful Servant to his power,
