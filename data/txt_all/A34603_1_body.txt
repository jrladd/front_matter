Most Illustrious Lord,
I Have brought forth to breath the Common Air, this small Tract, at the desire and com∣mand of several (ingenious) Gentlemen, whose high merits, straightly requires at my hands, a devoutly-obedient, strict and sudden performance, of their imperious and not to be questioned commands. If the Rayes of your Transcendant Magni∣tude had not given it life, I was without any hope (after I had conceived it) ever to see it breath. And now I am constrained to dedicate it unto your Lordship, before whom it ought to have appeared as richly endued with Ornaments, as you are with Vertues. Vouchsafe (I be∣seech you) to accept, in excuse of my boldnesse, the necessity of my obedience, by receiving this Infant into your high and gracious protection,

Being now delivered from the Presse, I am humbly bold to present it unto your Lordships Patronage, at no lesse a distance then the Center can be supposed from the Circumference, not questioning but your high candour and courtesie will acquit me of the presumption.
Great Lord, I do it not, as if I hereby thought to add the least Atome to your Transcendant Magnitude and Merit; (a thing impossible to your inferiours) but to set the better Lustre upon my Labours, that their passage through the world may be the more current, as having the impresse of your High and Illustrious Name and Au∣thority upon them. Besides your exquisite skill in, and affection to all Mathematical Arts and Sciences, is suffici∣ent to entitle you Mecoenas to a Piece of far greater worth and Learning then this I present you with: But the meridian of my glory is this, That the Pilot of my poor Vessel is a Person most Illustrious and Excellent, in whose breast, the sublimity of all vertues are concentred.
I hope your Lordship will excuse the meannesse of the present, (seeing the smallest Penny is stamped with His Majesties Impresse, as well as the greatest Jacobus) for Princes cannot expect from their Inferiours Presents proportionable to their high magnitude and merit. And though I cannot now (by this affectionatly-bold at∣tempt) avoid the censure of rashnesse, yet this is my comfort, that I have but assayed to do that whereunto I was wholly oblieged (by your High-meriting favours) and that with the greatest affection and submission ima∣ginable, that the world may know how much I am
My LORD,
