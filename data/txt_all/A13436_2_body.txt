BRaue Sparks haue amōgst you, though

Christmas be old, yet you shall per∣ceiue that hee nei∣ther feares your Toledoes, Bilboes, or Steelettoes; I know that each of you haue more shadow than substāce, more tongue than truth, and more haire than wit, though many of you be bald or beardlesse. You that haue Ror'd a∣way your Land, Whor'd away your money, and Scor'd away your credits; that with often vn∣naturall going to bed at Sun-rising, and rising at sup∣per time to breake∣fast, by turning the course of time out of his natural circum∣uolution; as the day into night, and the night into day, like Owles, Bats,

and Glowormes, are monsters a∣gainst nature, that pay more for the maring of your clothes, then for the making, giuing twice as much for the cut∣ting as for the sowing; whose exercise is drink∣ing and dicing, and whose grace is swearing; who entertaine old Christmas with Gluttony and E∣briety, with the ill gotten expen∣ces of thieuery, cheating, vn∣thristy borrow∣ing, vnmeasura∣ble exhausting, vnmercifull op∣pressing, or any vnlawfull obtai∣ning; Know, all the whole kennell

or litter of you, that I scorne you and your surfei∣ting welcome: let me perswade you to be wiser hereafter, and not to keepe mee company in such prodigall man∣ner, that you must be forced to fare the worse all the yeere af∣ter: Let it not bee imputed to mee, that I and my company did in twelue dayes, eate vp that which shold haue lasted 365. The old Prouerb saith Enough is a feast, and as you loue to feast, so haue no more then enough, lest to much feasting perforce, doe

breed and engen∣der to much fa∣sting spight of your teeth. Fi∣nally, Know, that I doe come euery yeere in memory of a great bles∣sing, and I would not haue your wastefull pro∣fusenesse to turne that blessed time of Remembrance into an accur∣sed vse of im∣pious blasphemie, and worse then Heathenish, Pa∣ganish, Baccha∣nalliall Beasti∣allitie. So wish∣ing euery of you to vse your best endeuours each one to mend one, I leaue you till the next yeere, in small hope to haue

my request gran∣ted.
