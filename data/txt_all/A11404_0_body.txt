ALthough (most gracious Prince) it be a commō receiued opinion, that the fruits of learning are only sweete, and the rootes bitter; yet to him that will be but a litle con∣uersant in the Hexameron of Du Bartas, it will rather appeare a pa∣radox then a sound position. For though his subiect be verie excellent, and consequently verie difficult, for ; yet he hath made such an insensible mix∣ture of profit and pleasure, & so artificially cōpounded them together, that when the reader thinks peraduen∣ture but to tickle his eare, with the sweete measure and delicate cadencie of a maiestical verse; he finds that both Diuinity and Philosophy do steale vpon him vnawares, and make him learned, ere he thinke of being taught. Which I iudge to be one of manie reasons, why your Kingly Father in those his learned instructiōs to you his dearest Sonne, doth grace him with so high a commen∣dation;

that he not onely thinkes him most worthie to be . read by any Prince, or other good Christian; but doth spe∣cially wish you to be well versed in his workes. Wherein his Maiesty hath bene so much pleased, that part of his poe∣ticall exercises at vacant houres, haue bene translations of some of his poems; delighting to beautifie his books and speeches with such pitie sayings, as do abound in this incomparable Poet. The consideration hereof makes me presume, that this Translation which here I offer to your Princely view, shall not want gracious ac∣ceptance. Whereof I do the rather assure my selfe, re∣membring your gracefull embracing of my former Es∣say of this verie nature, coming but accidentally vnto your hands. In which confidence reposing my hopes, I humbly presume to take my leaue; continually praying for your Graces happie growth in all Princely and he∣roicall vertues.
