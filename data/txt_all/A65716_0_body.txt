Honoured Sirs,
WHen I had the honour to preach one of these Sermons to your Regiments before your Expedition against Monmouth, I was so happy as to obtain Your Approbation and good Opinion of the Author of it; And since, upon a late Occasion, have receiv'd such Expressions of your Kindness to me as cannot be forgotten with∣out great Ingratitude. Being therefore desirous to give some publick Testimony of the great Ob∣ligations you have laid upon me, and of my due resentment of them; I humbly intreat you to ac∣cept this small Expression of my Gratitude, which I am the more encouraged to offer, because it as∣serts the Old Church of England Loyalty,
which You, to Your immortal Honour, have pra∣ctised in the worst of Times, and signaliz'd of late by that Cheerfulness and Bravery with which you ventured your Lives for the best of Princes and Governments: In Obedience to which, I shall always endeavour so to live, that you may never be asham'd to own,
Honoured Sirs,
