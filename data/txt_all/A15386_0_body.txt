RIght Honorable: It is not long since I came forth in a Marchants shippe, and nowe it is Gods prouidence, and your good pleasure, that I shall publish my selfe in a storme: In the appeasing whereof, since it hath pleased your Honour to vse my seruice as the word ioyned with the Sword, or rather as the Sword of the Spirit with the Sword of Iustice, I haue discharged my selfe as indifferently as I could to the cutting downe of offence in all: It is true that we are fallen into tempe∣stuous and troublesome times, wherein
 the excessiue couetousnesse of some hath caused extreame want to other, and that want not well disgested hath riotted to the hazard of all; yea and by these stormes we are cast among the rocks, euen two the most dangerous rocks of estate, Oppression of the mighty, and Rebellion of the manie, by mischiefe wherof many florishing king∣domes and countries haue miscarried, and so had we in this vndoubtedly, had not God by your good indeauors preuented it; & therfore between these two rocks I saile, admonishing in the passage the one sort, that is, the Mighty, that man liueth by bread, but the other sort, that is, the Many that mā liueth not by bread only, to the intent that they which know the ordinary course of God in preseruing nature might make a conscience of impairing the means of mans preseruation, and they likewise which knowe that God hath wayes to pre∣serue beyond the meanes of nature, might learne with christian wisdome & patience to temper thēselues in want: And because Right Honorable wee haue obtained great quietnesse through you, & your worthy A∣gents, and that great things are done vnto our countrie through your prouidence, God forbid, but that as Tertullus did to Foelix
 so we much more to you should acknowledge it wholy, & in all places, & with all thanks: yet in this we are bold to intreat you, that as you haue bin meanes for the due execu∣tion of iustice vpon the rebellious, so like∣wise (as opportunity shall serue) to promote the cause & cōplaints of the expelled, halfe pined, and distressed poore, that they rebell no more. It is the end of al mens exaltation according to the proportiō of their state & powre to do workes of mercy & iustice, for he that sat vpon a throne did confesse, that the thrones were set vp for iudgement Psal. 122. Now iudgement looketh both wayes: and therfore as it chastiseth the of∣fendor, so it represseth him likewise, by whose couetousnes & cruelty the offence cō∣meth: especially it will be looked for at your hands (Right honorable) strongly to main∣taine the cause of corne & of bread, God hauing giuen you a sheafe supported with Lyons, as the highest top, & chiefest emi∣nence of your Honor. Neither is there any greater promise of establishment made to the families & persons of mē, thē by a reli∣gious respect of the poore, which who so fol∣loweth, his righteousnes remaineth for euer, & his horne shal be exalted with honor. Psa. 112. God continue & increase in you an affection of the one, that you
 may bee made partaker of the other. And thus in my deepest deuotion commen∣ding to God your selfe, your state, and honorable family, I humbly take my leaue.
