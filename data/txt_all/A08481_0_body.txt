SIR
IT hath been my continuall de∣sire, euer si∣thence it was the Almighties pleasure, to take from vs, vn∣to himselfe, your worthy and

honourable Father, that some skilfull hand, would haue enterprized this worke, thus rudely by me both begunne and finished. For the more beautifull the face is, the more exquisite is the Limmer that it challengeth. (Let the Cobler meddle with his slipper, and let A∣pelles only draw the picture of that great Alexander.) If such a one would haue vndertaken it, how happie should I haue thought my selfe if as his ser∣uant, I might but haue ground his colours. But see∣ing none would; I as you see haue done it; Plainely I must needes confesse, howbeit as

neere the life as possibly I could. And to you, his only sonne, doe I deuote this I∣mage, of so rare and onely a father. Your tender yeeres perhaps, will for a time dim your eye, that you shall not be able so clearely to discerne, that deale of worth that is here pourtraied, and shadow∣ed out. But Pictures, are al∣waies best discerned some distance off; and therefore my comfort is, that although, not now, yet in time you wil: The which time being once come, let me desire you, that whatsoeuer excellencie you finde here expressed, you

would be pleased, to imbrace, and follow; shaping your selfe and all your actions, ac∣cording to so noble, and ex∣cellent a Patterne. So, what∣soeuer honours, your Father in his life possessed, you his sonne after him shall be sure to inherit, and the same bles∣sings that attended him, shall questionlesse, be doubled vp∣on you. The which I shall not whilst I liue cease beg∣ging at the hands of our hea∣uenly FATHER. Alwaies resting
