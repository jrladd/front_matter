THis Booke (right Honorable) comming to my handes, with his bare title without any Authours name or any other ordinarie ad∣dresse, I doubted how well it might become me to make you a present thereof, seeming by ma∣ny expresse passages in the same at large, that it was by the Authour intended to our Soue∣raigne Lady the Queene, and for her recrea∣tion and seruice chiefly deuised, in which case to make any other person her highnes partener in the honour of his guift it could not stād with my dutie, nor be without some preiudice to her Maiesties interest and his merrite. Perceyuing besides the title to purport so slender a subiect, as nothing almost could be more discrepant from the grauitie of your yeeres and Honorable function, whose contemplations are euery houre more seriously employed vpon the publicke adminisration and seruices: I thought it no condigne gratification, nor scarce any good satisfaction for such a person as you. Yet when I considered, that bestowyng vpon your Lordship the first vewe of this mine impression (a feat of mine owne simple facultie) it could not scypher her Maiesties honour or prerogatiue in the guift, nor yet the Authour of his thanks: and see∣ing the thing it selfe to be a deuice of some noueltie (which commonly

giueth euery good thing a speciall grace) and a noueltie so highly ten∣ding to the most worthy prayses of her Maiesties most excellent name (deerer to you I dare conceiue them any worldly thing besides) mee thought I could not deuise to haue presented your Lordship any gift more agreeable to your appetite, or fitter for my vocation and abilitie to bestow, your Lordship beyng learned and a louer of learning, my pre∣sent a Booke and my selfe a printer alwaies ready and desirous to be at your Honourable commaundement. And thus I humbly take my leaue from
the Black-friers, this xxviij. of May. 1589.
