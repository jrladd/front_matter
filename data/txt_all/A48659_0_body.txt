Madam,
IT is not without good reason, that I presume to address this Sermon to Your Ladyship, though it be the meanest Offering that could be made, to the Memory of your deceased Daughter. All that is exhortatory in it, will more nearly concern your Ladyship than it can any other: Though I confess, 'tis an unwarrantable Assurance to imagine, That your Ladyship should regard such weak Argu∣ments from me; who, in so many Occurrences of your Life, have been the highest Instance and Ar∣gument of Religious Patience.
You know, Madam, that this Discourse was made publick first in the Pulpit, and now in the Press; by their Solicitation; whom I could neither with good Manners, nor good Nature deny; though
I am sensible how much it will expose me. It is true, this is but a miserable Excuse for Printing so poor a Trifle; yet I am confident, that your La∣dyship (to whom I think my self chiefly accountable in this Case) will allow it for reasonable. I am afraid it will as little prevail with my Reader for a favourable Reception, to tell him that it was begun, and finish'd in a piece of a Night: and at a Time, when my thoughts were under very great Disadvantages, from a most sensible Concern, for the Loss of so good and valuable a Friend. As your Ladyship knows the Truth, so I doubt not, you will grant the Equity of this Apology, and allow it as an Extenuation of its Defects; for others, I ex∣pect to be told that the hasty Birth should as hastily have expired, and died immediately after the De∣liverance. Perhaps, I am much of the same Opi∣nion my self; but since I am much of the same Opi∣nion my self; but since I am assur'd by some, and those no incompetent Judges, that the Sermon may be tolerable in the Perusal, and possibly, not wholly unprofitable; I chuse rather to believe them impli∣citly, and so to comply with the Desires of several, who would have it Publick, than to be guilty of perhaps, a less pardonable Vanity; that I should fansie it worth any one's while, but especially, some of good Sense, and much Honour, to Flatter me.

The Subject I am sure, needs no Defence for be∣ing Publish'd; and had it met with one capable of doing it Justice in the Inlargement, ought not in Reason or Charity, to be Suppress'd. As it is, I hope it may be Ʋsefull to some of Your Excellent Daughters, Young Relations, (Your Surviving Daughter particularly) who may be won to a con∣stant Perseverance in the Ways of Religion and Virtue, by having so Fresh, and so Extraordinary an Example in their own Family.
I can hardly fear so ill an Effect from this, as that of making Your Ladyships Wound Bleed anew: For as it gives but a very imperfect Idea of Your unspeakable Loss, so I think it carries with it a lit∣tle of the Weapon-salve Virtue, and if it Wound, it may Heal too. At least it should give Your Lady∣ship some Comfort to remember, That You have gi∣ven to the Choire of Heaven, an Eminent, Glorious Saint, and to Earth, one of its most perfect Pat∣terns: And that, under the Age of Fourteen Years, and in the midst of all the Temptations of a very Vain, and Deceitful World.
So sublime a Theme, thus meanly handled, will very much need Your Ladyship's Pardon, and it will I hope, be some Plea for it, that I was not a willfull Offender: However, it is some Satisfaction o me, thus to own the great Obligations that I
have to Your Ladyship's Family, under whose Pa∣tronage I first entred upon the Duties of my Fun∣ction; and to whom, I shall think my self Happy to be any way Serviceable: And if my Capacities must be always Limited, nothing shall set Bounds to the heartiest Wishes, and most fervent Prayers, of theirs, and
