SIR,
WHat at first was preached at your single request, and designed solely for your service, being now published at the instance of many, and sent abroad to serve the mul∣titude, makes its first return to you who gave it be∣ing, as the Rivers to the Sea, from whence they came. Doubtless, Sir, there are such a Generation abroad, as this little Tract detects and reprehends; these I expect will rail, as not being able to bear that light, which discovers their Deeds of Darkness, or pardon him who dares publish their Secrets.Gen. 49.6. (My soul, come thou not in to them, mine honour be not united to their Assemblies) However, I have the less reason to dread the consequence of my searching these Serpents Nests, having such learned Judges, so loyal a Sheriff, and Gentlemen of the Grand Jury, standing by, to encourage and protect;
enough in Form of Law to acquit or condemn. My next security is the honesty of my Design; not to ex∣pose any, but to convince and reform, by perswading such, if possible, into a due observance of the Apostles Advice,1 Thess. 4.11. viz. to study to be quiet, and mind their own business; not the State or Government, it being none of their Province, until the King calls them to it. Indeed, the summ total of my aims be∣ing the service of my God and my Generation, the quiet and prosperity of my Master, the security and support of his Government, the reclaiming of turbu∣lent restless designers, the welfare and quiet of his peaceable Subjects; I ought not to regard what they can say or do: for if these things succeed, I have what I preach and pray for; and will be the rejoycing of,
SIR,
