May it please your Lordship,
THis ensuing trifle was not a voluntary, but a piece of obedience to the collected body of the Clergy of Ireland; their Commands gave it first life, since publication: Some Schoolmen say Angels (to the enervating Christs Divinity) may Create; surely were the sentiment true, it might be usefull to me at this time: I might hope those Ana∣logical Angels might work something out of this no∣thing. However I desire that nothing of Divinity may be injur'd by it; of which it contains many rem∣nants

such as Pedlers use to broak in, and those but narrowly handled, because being many they shoulder one another for elbow room: yet I must assert some∣thing of Election in them too; Your Lordship knows the Meridian of Ireland, and they were in some measure fitted for the Longitude and Latitude of many of the Clergy there: That is, the state thy have been (not are) in, through the wise conduct and great sedulity of the Reverend Fathers of the Church, and your Lordships (in a most eminent manner) in your own Province, where you have wrought great changes with little; not made ruine, and power the Instruments of your Reformation, but solid convictions, and amicable insinuations; So that now, though all the Diocess be right, no man complains of wrong; and the once seduced are not affraid of their Bishop, but ashamed of themselves: a vertue so much the greater in you because acted on the scene, and to many of the persons by whom in bad times your self suffered, when Loyalty and Or∣thodones were your Lordships greatest Crimes, and Schisme and Persecution their Virtues, yet their Re∣psntance has kept them safer, than your Innocence could you; and your mercy has changed them, when their cruelty could not you.
My Lord finding your influence so generally benign, I could not fear a soure aspect; if my understanding

could not, my memory might relieve me from your fa∣vours to my self which are fresh and recent; my hopes must be the same with the Moons now, who by sheltring her self under the Suns beams, has all her spots hid: Your Lordship has goodness enough to communicate these truths; that these papers were the scrapps of an ill memory, divested of all helps from Books, the products of almost an inch of time (but two poor dayes) the subject insolite (to preach on a Sacrament before a Convocation) and the Authour having the Sea so newly floating in his brains, that it might well drownd all things which it found there. And who will not believe such an Authority, especially when the work it self conspires to give in so clear an evidence to it. Had those ob∣stacles been removed, possibly another air might have animated these papers: However, in the unhappiness of having done ill, I have the happiness that charity may construe I might have done better. If any think this discourse bends not enough on practise, they must remember, that it was not conposed for the body of the Church but Quire; it was practical for them, it must be more by them: the dress of it I leave to your Lordships favour, but the truth of it to the greatest severity; for as I cannot offend that, so I would not this; being a Father of the Church submits all truths to your cognizance, but having a particular

charge of the sphere whereto I have the honour of a Designation, my motions in it more especially; where∣in as I would at no hand prove erratick, so my judg∣ment shall take its measures of access or retreat al∣wayes from your Ecliptick, whilest your charge: Thus my Lord design and duty have stept in to disho∣nour you with this patronage; but had both failed, friendship and love would not; that (before this late more August dependance and subordination) had the power of making, and (if they should expire) will alwayes have of keeping me.
