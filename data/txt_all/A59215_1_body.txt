MOst Reverend Father in God, We greet you well. Whereas the hold abuses and extravagancies of Preachers in the Pulpit, have not onely by the experience of former Ages béen found to tend to the dishonour of God, the scandal of Religion, and disturbance of the peace both of Church and State, but have also (through the licentiousness of the late times) much increased, to the inflaming, fomenting, and heightning of the sad distempers and confusions that were among us. And whereas even at this present (notwithstanding the merciful providence of God, so signally manifested in restoring Vs to Our Crown, and Our pious care and endeavours to govern Our Realms in peace and tranquillity) the said Abuses do yet continue in a very high measure in sundry parts of this Realm, through the busie diligence of some unquiet and factious Spirits, who instead of preaching
the pure Word of God, and building up the People in Faith and Holiness, have made it a great part of their business to beget in the minds of their Heaters an evil opinion of their Governours, by insinuating fears and jealousies to dispose them to discontent, and to season them with such unsound and dangerous Principles, as may lead them into Disobedience, Schism and Rebellion. And whereas also sundry young Divines and Ministers, either out of a spirit of contention and contradiction, or in a vain ostentation of their Learning, take upon them in their popular Sermons to handle the déep points of Gods Eternal Counsels and Decrées, or to meddle with the affairs of State and Government, or to wrangle about Forms and Gestures, and other fruitless Disputes and Controversies, serving rather to amuse than profit the Hear∣ers; which is done for the most part, and with the greatest confi∣dence, by such persons as least understand them: We, out of Our Princely Care and Zele for the honour of God, the advancement of Piety, Peace, and true Religion, and for the preventing for the future, as much as lieth in Vs, the many and great Inconve∣niencies and Mischiefs that will unavoidably ensue, if a timely stop be not given to these and the like growing Abuses, Do, accor∣ding to the Examples of several of Our Predecessours of blessed memory, by these Our special Letters straitly charge and com∣mand you, to use your utmost care and diligence that these Directi∣ons, which upon long and serious consideration We have thought good to give concerning Preachers, and which We have caused to be Printed, herewith sent unto you, be from henceforth duly and strictly observed by all the Bishops within your Province. And to this end Our Will and Pleasure is, That you forthwith send them Copies of these Our Directions, to be by them spéedily com∣municated to every Parson, Vicar, Curate, Lecturer and Mini∣ster, in every Cathedral, Collegiate, and Parish-Church within their several Dioceses: And that you eanestly require them to imploy their utmost endeavour for the due observation of the ame, whereof We shall expect a strict accompt both of you and every one of them: And these Our Letters shall be your sufficient Warrant and Discharge in that behalf.
Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the 14. day of October, in the 14. year of Our Reign, 1662.
