Dear SIR,
WHat I here Offer You, I
choose to Pay as an In∣stance
of my Gratitude, and as
Part of the Debt I owe to the
Honour of your long-continued
Friendship and Acquaintance;
Notwithstanding you might rea∣sonably
Demand it on your own
Personal Account and Merit;
as being able to pass Sentence

both on the Author and Tran∣slator,
and to determine whe∣ther
the Criticisms are well
grounded, or the Translation
just and proper. For you have
not fail'd to Improve the Ta∣lent
Nature has given you, by
the Advantages of Study and
Education; having a Mind
Inquisitive and Curious, Pene∣trating,
Solid and Retentive,
averse to Sloth, and always
Busy and Industrious: So that
you brought to the University, a
greater Stock of Sense, than ma∣ny
Gentlemen carry from it;
and Built successfully upon the
Grammar-Foundation, so well
laid by your Excellent Master,
a Superstructure of sound, ra∣ther
than superficial Acquisi∣tions.
It was your distinguishing
Prudence, forthwith to make

Choice of the best Company, as
well as Books, thereby season∣ing
your Mind with a true
sense of Learning, and good
Manners; which thing alone,
were there no other Engage∣ments
on you, had made you a
Friend to the University and
the Church, and a worthy
Member of both; whilst others
bringing nothing but Ignorance
and their hereditary Vices hi∣ther;
and Conversing with none,
but those of the like Stamp
and Character, make the De∣bauchery
of the Colledge the
chief Topick of their Discourse
when they have left it: Those
being ever most forward to Re∣vile
the Universities, when
from them, who in them were
their greatest Scandal and Re∣proach.
And now, Sir, though

a plentiful Estate calls off some
part of your Thoughts and time
from your Study, yet the choice∣est
of both are still imploy'd up∣on
your own Improvement;
since you think it no less becom∣ing
a Gentleman to inlarge his
Mind, than his Fortune, and to
have his Head, than his House,
richly Furnisht; upon which
Account I shall not pretend, by
the Present I here make you,
to Inform you so much as Di∣vert
you, whenever you shall
please to allow some of your lei∣sure-minutes,
in comparing the
Copy with the Original. But if
this Comparison of the Two
Best Historians, and Reflections
upon History, shall either Pro∣voke
you to take Pen in Hand,
or Assist you hereafter in Pro∣jecting
a Piece of that Nature,

I shall Merit more of the
Publick, than will at first
View be discover'd: How∣ever
it may happen, I shall
not fail of my Design, which
was my own Satisfaction, in
making, tho' a Poor, yet Real
Acknowledgement of the fre∣quent
Favours you have Con∣ferr'd
on,
SIR,

Magd. Coll. Oxon.
