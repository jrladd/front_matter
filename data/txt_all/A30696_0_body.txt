Reverend Brethren,
THough in the ensuing discourse I treat of the necessity of a Willing Mind to the acceptable performance of our Duty, I must confess I was not (if I could have handsomly avoided it) very willing to Preach to such an Assembly, much less to Print the Discourse: I have done both at your request, because I took it as a Command which I could not but Obey; and yet knowing how unfit I was to do either, I thought that an excuse for my Unwillingness, notwithstanding which I re∣solved to give a due submission to your Judgment; without that I should declin'd both the one and the other: the true Reason why I chose to speak to this subject, was because I found in my self a great defect of this disposition, and I considered it might be so with o∣ther Ministers as well as my self, and in stirring up you to the Willing and Chearful Performance of your Duty, I hoped to warm my self by the same Fire which I was to make for others: if in what I have done, I may but serve as the small Wood to kindle the Fire, 'tis as much as I designed. I am afrayd we are not enough thankful to God and the Government for the peaceable exercise of our Ministry, which is not given us upon a design (as formerly) by a Prince that did what he did in this matter to exalt his own pre∣rogative, aad to trample upon the laws in order to bring in Pope∣ry, but by a Prince that hath adventured to shew kindness to an afflicted depressed party, in the Face of those that seem to envy us this kindness, as much as ever the Patriarchs did their Father Jacobs to their Brother Joseph. Surely all things considered
 our Liberty to attend our Duty in Peace and Quietness is one of the greatest Instances of a Divine project baffling the Counsels of Men, that hath hapned in our days in this Nation; for hereby that is given by Law, which some Men never Intended to suffer, much less to Establish; behold in this the Wisdom of God that hath so circumstantiated our Liberty, that now it seems to be in∣terwoven with the Interest of the Government, so that who ever declares himself an Enemy to the former, will hardly be thought a hearty Friend to the latter. And We shall never express a grate∣ful sense of this Mercy of God to us without a more chearful performance of our Duty, in submission to our present Circum∣stances; Discouragements will never excuse us in the worst of times, much less now, whilst we have what the Apostles never liv'd to see; for they only had the future reward, but we with that the allowance of the Law, and by that means a freedom from trouble, a mercy which whilst we wanted we valued more than now we seem to do.
The Discourse as 'tis Printed varieth not from what was de∣livered, at least from what I designed to deliver: I have added nothing to, nor omitted any material passage that I found in my Notes. The Lord give us all more of the Apostles Willing Mind, that we may have the same Reward.
