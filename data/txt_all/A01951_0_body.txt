IT is repor∣ted (Right Honoura∣ble) of Cal∣licratides, that being appointed by the Lacedemo∣nians to succeede Lysander as Admirall of their Fleete, th Atheniens sente out aboue  hundred & fiftie Shippes ∣ainst him: wherevpon the

Master of his Shippe persua∣dinge him to retire without offeringe hys enemies anye play, because he was to deale with the greater number; he answered, that Sparta wold be neuer the woorse though hee were oylde, but to e, was in hys iudgemente, the greatest reproch of all. So fa∣reth it this present time with me, which giuing forth my Defiaunce vnto Playes, am mightily beset with heapes of aduersaries, yet such is the Maiestie of the Cause, that, though all the pride of mine enemies, and pompe of A∣thens be ship to meete mee,

it will stand vpright, when I with Callicratides am ouer∣throwne, but to shrinke in so good a quarrell, is in my opinion, more foule a dis∣grace then death it selfe. God knoweth I neuer vndertoke thys troublesome peece of woorke for any vaine glorie as Crassus did his Inuectiue a∣gainste Carbo, and repented him afterwardes, because it was a hatchet to hys owne libertie, setting many mens eyes a worke to watch hym; nor of any fantasticall ouer-hardinesse, as he that hauing taken a Wolfe by the eare, neither letteth hym goe; for

being assaulted; nor is able to master hym for wante of mighte: But as the Wrastler entring the liste, first tasteth his strength, by lifting some churlish peece of vveight at the armes end, & therevvith as it vvere rebateth hys sto∣macke, for being too rough vvhen he comes to grapple; I first vveighed in my hands the aunciente Fathers of the Church, that the massinesse of theyr argumentes in thys matter might cause me not to deale so ouerthvvartlye & stubbornelye, as the Defen∣dantes of Players haue deser∣ued. Neuertheles I thought

it necessarye to nettle one of their Orators aboue the rest, not of any set purpose to de∣face hym, because hee hath dealt very grossely, homely, and vncharitably vvith me, but like a good Surgeon to cut, & to seare, vvhen the place requireth, for his ovvn amendment. Which thinge I trust shall neither displease your honor, nor any of the godly, in the reading, so lōg as the person vvhom I touch is (as I heare by hys ovvne frendes, to hys repentance if he can perceiue it) hunted by the heauy hand of God, and become little better than a

vagarant, looser than liberty, lighter than vanitie it selfe. The righte, for the recouery vvherof I framed these acti∣ons belongeth not to mee, but vnto God, vvhose man∣ner is to beate dovvne the loftinesse of vsurpers, not vvyth the vvisdome of the world, or with preparation of speare & shield, but with the foolishnes of the Gospel, and the nakednesse of hys truth. Therefore it had bene as daungerous for me, in this simple Confutation of our Comedies, to play with my penne by seekinge fine pou∣ders for deintie noses, as it is

for the soldier to dally with his weapon when the bat∣tell ioynes. It is one thing to flourish, an other to fighte, one thing to bragge, another to come to handye gripes. Finding Playes of thēselues, as filthy as the stables of Au∣gia, impossible to bee clean∣sed before they be carried out of Englande, wyth a stiffe streame, and the banishinge of them as worthy to be re∣gistred in the labors of Her∣cules as the conqueringe the monstruous wilde Bore, of Erymanthus, that wasted the countrey round about: If e∣uer so notable a thinge bee

brought to passe it must bee done by some Hercules in the Court, whom the roare of the enimy cā neuer daunt. Whiche perswaded mee a∣mongest all the patrones of vertue in her Maiesties court to dedicate both this & my selfe vnto your honor, that your wisedome might be a countenaunce to my study, your authoritie a buckler vnto my life. Agamemnon a valiaunt Captayne of the Greekes, thought verely, that if hee might haue but tenne suche as Nestor to take hys part, it would be no trouble to sacke Troy: I haue beene

alwaies of this opinion, that if but one suche as Nestor, that is, your honor, doe no more then thruste out your hand to succour mee, let the wicked discharge their shot at my face, Playes will bee easely fired out: and I when I sleepe shall be as safe, as the childe in his cradle, whose mother will not suffer a flye to bite him. Meane while I most humbly craue pardon for my bouldnesse, in presu∣ming, to crepe into your ho∣nours patronage: I make as much accounte of your ho∣nour, as the Atheniens did of Paralus their holye shippe,

that was nuer lanched but vpon high, & great affaires The Getlemen Players in the citie of London, are gro∣wen in such a heate, that by their foming, their fretting, their stampinge, my frendes do perceiue how their harts woorke, and enforeme to bring to your honor no cō∣mon fraighte, but as much as my life and securitie here∣after shall be woorth. If the prouidence of God, who many times scourgeth a mā with the sinne that he loued, haue ordeined those players whome I fed with fancies, to be a whippe to my back,

and a dagger to my brest, the fault is mine owne, the pu∣nishmente due: But if it be the pleasure of the Almigh∣tie, rather in mercy to deli∣uer, then in iustice to con∣found; & by your honora∣ble patronage to snatch mee out of the iawes of those ra∣uenous wolues, that haue whetted their teeth to pull me downe; I shall learne to employ my study to the glo∣ry of God, and be bound to your honour vvhilest I liue. Thus vvishing a charitable minde to them, better suc∣cesse vnto my selfe, plentye of happines to your honor;

I leaue them and me to your honors consideration, and your honor to the tuition of God himselfe.
