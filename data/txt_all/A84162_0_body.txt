BEleved, the good effects that my Books which I wrote from tim to time had ta∣ken upon his Highness the Lord Protector, and upon his party, hath always been crossed by such Plotters as have sought the life of his Highness, & to involve the Kingdom in blood again: the Plotters foolishly thinking, that God is well pleased with blood, and that it is im∣possible for the King and his Highness to agree and come to be in mutual love and peace a∣gain. And this I speak, because I finde the too too sad consequence of the late Plot, that hath altered the good affection of his High∣ness, & of others that are about him, that was wrought on them by Gods blessing on my book called The Voice of Michael the Arch∣angel, and those motions for peace which be∣sides I propounded then to them by word of mouth, tending to union between the King & his Highness. And these motives about three months agone, when I was there, were well re∣sented.

Upon which reception, I wrote some∣thing accordingly, to shew that I found those motives good effect. Which conception of mine, (to the honour of the true, peaceable, loyal affections of his Highness and of his party, shall be discovered hereafter, if God permit. But now having a further discovery to shew his Highness, even that which he should speedily do, to prevent an ensuing evil, I wrote and went to the Court, not doubting but that my way to his Highness was as pass∣able as before: yet coming there, I found no passage, by reason the unsavouriness of the late Plot was so hainous among them, that all we now which mention their peace with Charles the second, are counted their adversaries; though haply his Highness is of anether mind. Nor because I was not admitted, am I per∣swaded that his Highness is unwilling to hear me in a matter of so great concernment; but I look upon it as the fancie of the others that kept me from him. Therefore blame me not (being debar'd from him) for printing it, that it may come to his hand. And though you do blame me, I had rather suffer, then that his Highness should be ignorant of Gods minde shewed in the foresaid Writing; which is as followeth.
