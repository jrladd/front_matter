Right Honourable,
THe following Discourse was never designed to go further than your own Chappel, o∣therwise it had not been left so Imperfect: but since you have thought fit to Order it should be more Publick, it would ill become me, who do in it so earnestly Press Obedience to Superiors, to dispute your Commands. Such therefore as it is, I humbly Pre∣sent it to you, heartily wishing it may in



some degree Minister to the Promoting Peace and Unity and Brotherly Love among us, which is the onely thing there∣in aimed at by
RIGHT HONORABLE,
