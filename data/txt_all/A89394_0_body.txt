Mrs CRESVVELL,
AS the Lord hath abundantly bles∣sed you with in∣ternal graces, so hath he likewise honoured you with external blessings; whereby you are instrumen∣tal in relieving the wants, and binding up the Wounds of

your poor Sick and Lame Neighbours: my experience of your affections and endea∣vours thereunto, (if I were not otherwise obliged) is no small cause of this assay. But large courtesies require large acknowledgements, from all that would not willingly lye under the Ignominious brand of ingratitude: And many have endeavoured, and sought by this means, to ren∣der satisfaction for benefits received: but no such con∣struction must be made of my present intention; that is not my end and scope, but only to shew a thankful acknow∣ledgement

for your former favours. Then that I have thus chosen you out by a sin∣gle Dedication, to be the Patroness of these my Lucu∣brations, I hope you will account it but a venial trans∣gression. If therefore you shall please to accept of these my poor presented pains, there shall my Ambition Anchor. And I doubt not but your reading and practise of this small Treatise, will gain you the poors Prayers, and plead my excuse.
London, July 23 1656.
