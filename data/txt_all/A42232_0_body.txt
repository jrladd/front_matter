Right Honourable,
IT is the Great Name of the Author, not any wor∣thiness of the Transla∣tor, that gives this Book a capacity of so high a Dedication. The Author, born in a low Countrey, hath, by his excellent works, both Divine and Humane, raised himself to the just Repute of the most General, and the wisest Scholar of his time; So that, it is become a character of an Inge∣nuous Student (as it was said, in the last Age, of his Country-man, the Great Eras∣mus) to be well versed in the Books of Gro∣tius. Out of whose Magazine, our best English Writers, to their praise, have bor∣rowed some of their best furniture. The Argument of this Work is worthy the study of Princes, and Great Persons; From whom, certainly, God expects a greater care of his
 Churches Peace and Order. To which pur∣pose, the Grave Author hath here said, some things first of all; some, with a better Grace than any other; and some, that al∣though they have been said very well by our own Men, yet perhaps will be better taken (as the English humour is) from the Pen of a stranger. The Translator's Designe is, partly publick, in this scribling Age (where∣in yet, we have need of more good Books, to Out the many bad ones) to cast in his Mite into the Treasury of the Church of England: (whom, as the Moderate Author much ho∣nour'd, so He professeth himself to be one of her poor Children:) partly private, by this Dedication of it with Himself to your Ho∣nours, to leave a Gratefull Monument (and a lasting Monument, he hopes) in those Graci∣ous Hands, that have supported him, in his worst and weakest Times. May Your Honours Both live to see the Publick Breaches, both of Church and State, fairly made up; and particularly, the Ruines of your Sudely: And, may Your illustrious Names and Ver∣tues live after you, and be increased in your Children. So prayeth,
Right Honourable,

Sudeley, Jan. 6. 1651.
