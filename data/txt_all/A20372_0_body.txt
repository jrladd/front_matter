THere is nothing more vsually com∣mon in this last part of this worst age (most Honorable, and vertuous∣ly Honorable Lord) then the publi∣cation of Bookes, how-euer their genealogies spring euen from the lightest vanities: amongst whom, (to saue the World and Bitternesse a labour) I condemne my selfe, as an Author and Abettor of that customary error, onely with this halfe-part excuse, that albe in my writings I haue neither Feminine honie, nor Masculine gall, yet I either doe, or desire to retaine a tast∣full rellish of a little saltnesse; which, may it ca∣rie but the least imagined season in your No∣ble sence, I shall slieghtly respect the curiositie of any other, how-euer his stomacke be estee∣med for best iudgement. The Noble French∣man Mounsieur Portes, who was the first Author of this worke, was a man of great wit, famous learning, and Noble place; each of which cur∣rie

in them, defence sufficient to shield him from imputation: so that questionlesse, the bo∣dy of the worke must needs be faire, and onely the deformitie in his English apparell: and no wonder, for I protest the Translation was fi∣nisht, and forth of my hands aboue a dozen yeares agone, a time wherein bumbasted bree∣ches, and straite whale-bon'd dublets had nei∣ther vse nor estimation. How-euer, all mine es∣capes, both boldnesse in daring to your pre∣sence, rudenesse in the worke, & wants in mine Arts perfection, must flie vnder the couert of your Noble Patronage; a defence, that giuing my Muse an immortall life, shall binde my loue and seruice to you, and your Honorable house for euer.
