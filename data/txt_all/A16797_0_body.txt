RIght Hono∣rable, I haue read, that newely af∣ter the Co∣ronation of Alexander the greate, di∣uers

of his subiectes, as well of the Nobilitie, as meaner condition, did present his greatnesse, with such giftes as their abilities could pur∣chase, to manifest the na ture of their loue, or seruice: among all which, a poore Mason, not so rich as cun∣ning, in his Arte; and yet as willing as any, in some token of his seruice, to make some manifestation of his humble loue, brought into

the Court a bagge full of stones; but what they were, or how they were wrought, was not know∣en to anie, neither would hee let any man see them, till hee was brought vnto the Emperour: where, vp∣on a table, hee laid be∣fore him his owne Image, but in so deade a colour, as if hee were to be laid in his graue, with these words written vpon his breaste,

Talis eris. Diuers of his Court, at the beholding thereof, began to frowne at the poore Mason, that hee durst at such a time of plea∣sing triumphes, present his Maiestie with a picture of such melancholy: but the Emperour, taking by the in∣spiration of Gods holy spi∣rit, a gratious apprehension of the poore mans loue, not only did thankfully accept the present, which he cau∣sed to be set vp in his owne

chamber, euer after, as a cō∣tinual glasse for him euening & morning, & at all houres to looke vpon, but after a bountifull reward, entertai∣ning him for his owne Ma∣son, vsed these wordes of him vnto al those that did at∣tend in his presence: Here are many of yee, that I am beholding to, for many to∣kens of your loue and ser∣uice, but chiefely vnto this man: for some of yee haue beene sent by your fathers,

some, by your friends, some from your own spirits, with such thinges as ye haue pre∣sented: but this man neither from father, friend, nor from himselfe; but onely from God of heauen was sent vn∣to mee, not with a toy to delight mee, nor a Iew∣ell to enrich mee, but with a continual warning, not to sinke in the delight of vani∣tie, nor to trust in the drosse of this worldly treasure, but in the greatest of my great∣nesse,

to humble my selfe, to him that is greater than I, & who hauing made me greate, can bringe mee to nothing at all; and what∣soeuer, I am, or may be, doth she we mee what in the end I shall be. Thus farre of this historie I haue set downe for my purpose. Your Lordship, newly stept vp vnto the state of Honour, I know shall be followed with many friends, and gratified with many presents, which I know you

will not receiue vnthankful∣ly: but among all, I beseech you not to refuse, at the hands of an humble heart, the passionate meditations of a patient spirite: which, in the Euening, and Mor∣ning, and at all houres, if your Lordshippe wil vouch∣safe at your leasure to looke vpon, yee shall see, that whosoeuer hath come to you, and whatsoeuer is brought you, GOD that

set mee to worke, hath sent mee vnto you, to present you with such a glasse, as will shewe the great comfort of his grace. By which I humbly be∣seech his eternall Maiestie, to guide your thoughtes, wordes, and deedes, to his infinite glorie, the con∣tentment of her Maiestie, the increase of your owne Honour, and the com∣fort of all that loue you:

among whome, the least worthie to bee named, I humbly rest
