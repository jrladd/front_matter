RIght Honourable, hauing spent the most part of my time in the profession of Armes, and that among forraine nations, as the French, the Dutch, the Italian, and Spaniard, I haue bene moued by sundry my friends, to set downe in writing such Martial points, as I haue noted, gathered, or learned from them, where∣by, such young Gentlemen, and others, my willing countrie men, as haue not, as yet, entred within the boundes of Mars his bloudy field, may, at the last, ga∣ther some instructions, to be the readier at the Alarme giuen: the which seemeth not farre off. And sith my principall scope and purpose hath bene, to open these discourses to the behoofe of the yonger and vnexperi∣mented sort, I haue therfore emboldened my selfe, with your good Honours consent, and fauour, to dedicate them vnto that Noble yong Lord your sonne, as a mat∣ter (were it handled by a more perfect souldier then my

selfe) befitting his Lordship, as well for the Martial ver∣tues already shining in him, as for the sympathie that his honorable birth and Nobility hath with this sub∣iect which we treate of, being warre and Armes. Thus humbly crauing your good honours consent, I beseech the Almighty for euer to blesse you with all honour and felicity.
