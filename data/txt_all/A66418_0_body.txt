WHatever encouragement there may be for Printing Sermons in our Age (very fruitful in that kind) yet there cannot be much ex∣pected for such as are Occasional, how perti∣nent and well-received soever in the Hearing: For being ordinarily directed to a particular purpose and Auditory, the Publick is the least concerned in them. And therefore since what you were entertained with (at the late general meeting of our Country-men) was of that kind, it is the less fit to appear in the World. But since you are pleased to desire

it, it's not easie for me to deny it, and that to you, to whom our Country owes so much for the reviving of a useful Society out of a Charitable design; and the Society owes so much for the prudent managemment of it. To the good order of which, if this Sermon did any way contribute (as you were plea∣sed to think) or may for the future recom∣mend the Duties therein insisted upon to others, I shall neither repent, of First Preaching, nor now of Publishing it at your Request.
