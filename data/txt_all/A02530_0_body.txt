Right Honourable:
AFter some vn∣pleasing inter∣missions, I re∣turne to that taske of Contemplation,

wherein onely my soule fin∣deth rest. If in other imploy∣ments I haue indeauoured to serue God and his Church, yet in none (I must confesse) with equall contentment. Me thinkes Controuersie is not right in my way to Heauen; how euer the im∣portunity of an aduersarie may force me to fetch it in: Jf Truth oppressed by an erroneous teacher cry (like a rauisht virgin) for my ayd, I betray it, if J releeue it not; when I haue done, I

returne gladly to these paths of peace. The fauour which my late Polemicall labour hath found (beyond merit) from the learned, cannot di∣uert my loue to those wrang∣ling studies. How earnestly doth my hart rather wish an vniuersall cessation of these armes; that all the Profes∣sors of the deare name of Christ might bee taken vp with nothing, but holy and peaceable thoughts of deuo∣tion; the sweetnesse wherof hath so farre affected mee,

that (if J might doe it with∣out danger of mis-constructi∣on) I could beg euen of an enemy this leaue to be happy. I haue already giuen account to the world, of some expen∣ces of my houres this way, & here J bring more; which if some reader may censure as poore, none can censure as vnprofitable. J am bold to write them vnder your Ho∣nourable Name, whereto I deeply obliged; that J may leaue behind me this meane, but faithfull Testimony, of

mine humble thankefulnesse to your Lo: and your most honored and vertuous Lady. The noble respects I haue had from you both, deserue my prayers, & best seruices, which shall neuer bee wan∣ting to you and yours,
