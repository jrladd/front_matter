BEloved, It may seem strange (to many) that I am inter∣medling
with Controversies amongst the Learned
in Divinity. And therefore it▪ is likely that some will
say of me, as it was somtime said of one, Thou art but
a stripling, but they are men of War from their youth▪ and there∣fore
not to be encountred with by thee. And they will think it
more safer for me to be employed about meaner matters, of a lower
Nature, rather than to encounter with gyants. And (perhaps)
give me a nipping check, like that of Eliab to David; viz. Where
are those few sheep left in the Wilderness? It is thy pride that mo∣ved
thee to come and see the battel. But my answer is as that which
then was made, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? &c.
There were Israelites on the one side that stood for the glory of
God▪ and the lawful liberty of his children; and there were Phili∣stines
on the other side, that did defie Christ and his redeemed Ones,
and they had one great Goliah on whom they did cast their confi∣dence,
and he did approach towards the Israelites with reproach and
defiance, and yet those Israelites remained in a kind of astonishment.
Our condition is somwhat like theirs (if well examined.) And
although I am not furnished with such complete Armour as some o∣ther
(spiritual) Warriours are, yet if the stone of Israel be with me,
I shall have good success; You know, a jaw-bone was but a strange
peice of Armour, yet a thousand Philistins could not stand against
it, for God was with it: And his riddle did occasion the quarrel be∣tween
them; for they brake the Covenant of Garments and Sheets,
as some have done in a Covenant with me here.
I will not compare my self with any of those Warriours: yet
give me leave to put forth a Riddle;
By weakness comes strength▪
Yet strength beareth down weakness.
Canterbury, May, 1648.
Yours, for Truth,
