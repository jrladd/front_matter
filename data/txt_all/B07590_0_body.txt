SISTERS, vnto
your Brother all as deere,
As Sisters ought to bee
vnto a Brother;
A token of my loue
I send you heere.
(True loue will flame
or at the least will smother.)

Though it bee but
a slender paper-scrowle,
It further may
the safety of your Soule.


Should J wish to you
Coffers packt with Gold;
Or wish you noble
Ladyes at the Court;
Should I you wish
more dayes then can bee told;
And with long dayes
all meriment and sport:
What would these great,
these glorious wishes proue,
But the vaine breath,
of a meere carnall loue?


Could J you make
all these things which I write;
Nay, should I you aduance
to state of Queenes,
With Beauties grac'd
procure you all delight,

With length of dayes
the richest Judian Mines;
And yet the care
of your poore soules omit,
This were nor loue,
nor honesty, nor wit.


Life ends in Death,
and death will quite vndoe
The goodliest frame
of earthly happinesse.
What then would all
this glory come vnto?
What come of vs
and of our outward blisse?
All vanish would,
and in that wofull houre
If wee preuent not,
Hell might vs deuoure.


From which most dreadfull,
dolefull, dismall place,
GOD of his mercy deare
your soules deliuer:

And you vouchsafe
his rich and sauing Grace,
Jnto this gulfe
that you doe tumble neuer.
Oh therefore while
this gracious time doth last,
Make your saluation sure
and hold it fast.


Make sure, make fast,
and in your health prepare
Against the houre
of your most certaine Death;
Thrice happie you
if you prepared are,
When you must render
vp your fatall breath.
This I doe pray for,
this J doe contend:
For this to you,
this little Scrowle I send.


A Winding-Sheete 'tis call'd,
which you I send:

Refuse it not;
let it as welcome bee,
As euer was
from your best loued Friend,
Your Wedding-gowne
your Ring or better fee:
The Wedding-gowne,
you must be hind you leaue,
The Winding-sheete
your body must receiue.


The Wedding-gowne,
in time away doth weare,
And oft with it
the wedding comforts fade:
Fresh springing comforts
fall vnto their share,
Which in their Winding-sheet
in peace are layde.
And there in peace
who doe desire to lye,
Let them oft put
it on before they dye.

Doe so with this,
vse it, and on it muse,
Read it, and to
your reading practice adde;
So Death shall neuer
bring you heauy newes,
But bee a welcome guest,
a message glad;
A day wherein
to CHRIST you shall bee wed,
Your Sheet a Gowne,
your Graue the Marriage bed.
