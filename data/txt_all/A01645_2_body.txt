A Generous benefactour writes what he gives in running water; so doth Sr John Hanburie: A thankfull receiver writes what he receives in a pillar of marble; so would Ralph Winterton. The one professeth the art of forget∣fulnesse; so do you: The other practi∣seth the art of remembrance; so will I. Six yeares are passed since the golden streams of your bountie flowed down upon me: But the water of Lethe hath not yet washed them out of my me∣morie. I hope I shall never be sick of a lethargie: But it is good to use a help for memorie. A benefit once re∣ceived ought alwayes to be remem∣bred: Mans alwayes is not alwayes: Come death, farewell memorie. Let∣ters

after the death of them to whom they are sent, are usually burnt for waste papers. Therefore I durst neither trust the one nor the other with keep∣ing the record of your bountie, and my thankfulnesse: knowing that death for certain will blot out memory, and fire may burn up the Registers office. It may be your bountie would have been well pleased with a private ac∣knowledgement: But my dutie could not be satisfied without a publick mo∣nument. None more publick then that which hath passed through the presse: For that of one can make a thousand; so it did formerly. But now I have made fifteen hundred witnesses of my thankfull remembrance: and more may hereafter. Gerard where he is known is in favour every where: But he is no where without Sr JOHN HANBURIE,
