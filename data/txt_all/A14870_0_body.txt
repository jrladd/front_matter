MY Right Noble Lord: I present to your
voidest leasure of Suruey, these few
sparkes, found out, in our most glori∣ous
Prince his ashes: I could not have
thought this worthy your view, but
that it aimes at the preseruation of His
fame; then which, I know not any thing, (but the sacred
liues of both their Maiesties, and their sweete Issue)
that can be dearer vnto you. Were my whole life tur∣ned
into leasure, and that leasure acccompanied with all
the Muses, it were not able to draw a Map large enough
of him: for his praise is an high-going sea, that wants
both shore and bottome. Neither do I (my Noble Lord)
present you with this night-peece, to make his death-bed
still floate, in those compassionate riuers of your eyes: you
haue already, (with much lead vpon your heart) sounded

oth the sorow Royal, and your Owne: O that care should
euer attaine to so ambitious a Title! Onely heere (though
I dare not say) you shall find him liue: (for that assurance
were worth many kingdomes,) yet you shall perceiue
him draw a little breath, such as giues vs comfort, His
Critticall day is past, and the glory of a new life risen,
neither subiect to Physicke. nor Fortune. For my defects
in this vndertaking, my wish presents it selfe with
that of Martials.
O vtinam mores animum{que} effingere possem!
Pulcrior in terris nulla tabella foret.
Howsoeuer: your protection is able to giue it noble lusture,
and bind me by that honour able courtesy to be euer
