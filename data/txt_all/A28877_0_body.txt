Learned SIR,
AS no one can be more con∣cerned
than your Self,
in Vindicating Lear∣ning,
and discouraging it's
Opponents; so without Pre∣sumption,
I may say, no one
is more able to take upon him
such a Task; of which You
have long ago satisfied the

World, by appearing Pub∣lickly
in the Defence of That
College, of which You are
now a very worthy Member.
And as you have given a ve∣ry
full Proof, that you are suffi∣ciently
qualified to Defend
Learned Men from the At∣tempts
of those who endea∣vour
to Oppose them; so it
consequently follows, that I
could not possibly make choice
of a fitter Patron for this Book,
which is a Vindication of all
Learned Physicians, from the
vain and false Pretences of an
ignorant Man.
And tho', I presume, to
ask your Patronage of this

Book, yet it is not because
I think the Adversary I ap∣pear
against, nor all his adhe∣rents
formidable Opponents;
but because, any thing that
carrys with it a Vindication
of that Learned Society, of
which you are a Member,
cannot have a more proper
Name prefixed to it than
Yours, who have so signally
appeared in their Defence.
But tho' it be an Honour to
appear in such a Cause, yet it
is not that which bears the
highest Place in your Cha∣racter:
For Religion and Ver∣tue
which are the Measures
and Rules of all your Actions,
make you Useful both to the

Church and State, it being
Part of your continual Care
to instil into young Men
a just Veneration for a Deity
and noble and great Notions
of the extraordinary Merit of
so great a King.
And your Prudence is not
more remarkable in respect of
the Publick, than your own
Private Affairs, where Judg∣ment
and Learning are the sure
Guides of successful Practice,
and Vertue and Tranquility
extend themselves through∣out
your Family.
These are but short Hints
of so great a Character as the
Conduct of your Life affords
materials for; a Character which

claims a better Pen, than mine
to take a Draught of, and
which one that is intimately
acquainted with those Vertues,
in their utmost Extent can on∣ly
describe.
For which Reason I fear,
that whilst I only endea∣vour
to shew my self sensible
of those Obligations your
Favours have laid upon me,
and for which Gratitude can
be the least Return, I shall ra∣ther
be condemn'd by those
who know how far I come
short of your Merit, for un∣dertaking
to mention any
thing that belongs to a Cha∣racter
so much above my
Reach.

Yet from your self I can
easily hope for Pardon, since
you are so free to give it to
all those that transgress not
too far Divine and Human
Laws, nor unreasonably tri∣umph
in their Ignorance, to
the Dishonour of Learning
and Learned Men, for all
which you have so great a
Veneration, and therefore I
am more hold humbly to sub∣scribe
my self,
Learned SIR,
