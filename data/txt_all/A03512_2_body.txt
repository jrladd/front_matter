THat Poesie is not so remou'd a thing
From graue administry of publike weales,
As these times take it; heare this Poet sing,
Most iudging Lord: and see how he reueales
The mysteries of Rule, and rules to guide
The life of Man, through all his choicest waies.
Nor be your timely paines the lesse applyed
For Poesies idle name; because her Raies
Haue shin'd through greatest Counsellors, and Kings.
Heare Royall Hermes sing th'Egyptian Lawes;
How Solon, Draco, Zoroastes sings
Their Lawes in verse: and let their iust applause
(By all the world giuen) yours (by vs) allow;
That, since you grace all vertue, honour you.
