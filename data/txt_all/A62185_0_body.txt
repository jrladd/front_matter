MY LORD,
I Once thought to have de∣dicated
these papers, sent
me by a friend, to some
of the most eminent of
our Protestant Clergy: but
I considered the Romane
Church had carried their
interest higher by much than any other, and
therefore it must be singular Piety, an high Self-denial,
and a sincere love of God, that must se∣cure
their opposition to the growing greatness
of Rome amongst us. I therefore quitted that
thought, and in the next place designed to ad∣dress
my self to some person of great Quality
of the Protestant Religion: but then I consi∣dered
that great ffices, Favour and Interest
with some great Men might be preferred to
their concers in Abby-lands, and render them
cooler than cur cause requires. My last refuge

then was to cast this small thing into your
Lordships Arms and Protection, a Noble man
of a great and ancient Extraction, and there∣fore
I hope not willing to exalt, more than
needs, the dominion of the Priests.
Besides, though your Religion be of the
Romish Faith, yet your dependence is not on
Offices and Preferments, nor can they coun∣tervail
so great an Estate in Land; and you
may be content to be saved in the private ex∣ercise
of your own Religion, though the Pro∣testant
be uppermost, nay much better saved,
than if the Church of Rome, returning trium∣phant,
reduce you from an Estate in Land
of ten thousand pound per annum to a Lease
from an Abby of two or three hundred pounds
a year; which however it may exalt your
Faith, must undoubtedly destroy your Cha∣rity.
What terms you are certainly to expect
if England ever submit its self to the See of
Rome, the Author out of whom these papers
are extracted, a man of unquestioned Credit,
and of your own Religion, will inform you;
which your Lordship, of all other persons,

hath reason to believe, because one of your An∣cestors
was employed to Rome in the very Am∣bassy
here mentioned, and you must needs
have amongst the papers of your Family (if
they are extant) authentick proofs to con∣firm
it,
