RIght worthie, and reverend Syr: As I have alwaies thought the place wherein I liue, after heauen, principally to be desired, both because I most want, and it most abounds with wisdome, which is fled by some with as much de∣light, as it is obtained by others, and ought to be followed by all: so I cannot but next vnto God, for euer acknow∣ledge myselfe most bound vnto the hand of God, (I meane your∣selfe) that reacht downe, as it were out of heauen, vnto me, a be∣fit of that nature, and price, then which, I could wish none, (one∣ heauen itselfe excepted) either more fruitfull, and contenting r the time that is now present, or more comfortable, and en∣couraging for the time that is alreadie past, or more hopefull, and omising for the time that is yet to come.
For as in all mens iudgements (that haue any iudgement) Eu∣pe is worthily deem'd the Queene of the world, that Garland

both of Learning, and pure Religion beeing now become her crowne, and blossoming vpon her head, that hath long since laine withered in Greece and Palestine; so my opinion of this Island hath alwaies beene, that it is the very face, and beautie of all Europe, in which both true Religion is faithfully professed with∣out superstition, and (if on earth) true Learning sweetly flourishes without ostentation: and what are the two eyes of this Land, but the two Universities; which cannot but prosper in the time of such a Prince, that is a Prince of Learning, aswell as of People: and truly I should forget myselfe, if I should not call Cambridge the right eye: and I thinke (King Henrie the 8. beeing the vni∣ter, Edward the 3. the Founder, and your selfe the Repairer of this Colledge, wherein I liue) none will blame me, if I e∣steeme the same, since your polishing of it, the fairest sight in Cambridge: in which beeing placed by your onely fauour, most freely, without either any meanes from other, or any desert in my selfe, beeing not able to doe more, I could doe no lesse, then ac∣knowledge that debt, which I shall neuer be able to pay, and with old Silenus, in the Poet (vpon whome the boyes—injiciunt ipsis ex vincula sertis, making his garland, his fetters) finding my selfe bound vnto you by so many benefits, that were giuen by your selfe for ornaments, but are to me as so many golden cheines, to hold me fast in a kind of desired bondage, seeke (as he doth) my freedome with a song, the matter whereof is as worthie the swee∣test Singer, as my selfe, the miserable Singer, vnworthie so divine a subiect: but the same fauour, that before rewarded no desert knowes now as well how to pardon all faults, then which indul∣gence, when I regard my selfe, I can wish no more; when I re∣member you, I can hope no lesse.
So commending these few broken lines vnto yours, and your selfe into the hands of the best Physitian, IESVS CHRIST with whome, the most ill affected man, in the midst of his sicknes, is in good health, and without whoms, the most lustie bodie, in his greatest iollitie, is but a languishing karcase, I humbly take my

eaue, ending with the same wish, that your deuoted Observer, nd my approoued Friend doth, in his verses presently sequent, that your passage to heauen may be slow to vs, that shall want ou here, but to your selfe, that cannot want vs there, most secure nd certeyne.
