Madam,
THough there be too many Ladies in our Day (for which the Land mourneth) that are called Ladies of Honour; but alas! they have been Ladies of Pleasure, as well as of Honour. But I can call you with confidence, not only a Lady of Honour, but of Holiness also. I know, that the holy Education wherewith the Lord did bless you under your very Religious Parents (both of them belonging to famous Mr. Bowles his Church at York) hath left a Divine Tin∣cture abiding upon your spirit unto this day, and I hope it will accompany you into a better World, Rev. 14.13. Whereas other Ladies, do spend most precious time in beholding their Fa∣ces by Reflection, and do therein (as it were) even nail the Eyes of their Heads upon the surface of their Looking-Glases; yet all this while they hereby overlook the most important Concerns of their most pretious and immortal Souls, quite forgetting what Solomon saith, Favour is deceitful, and Beauty is vain, but the Woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised] Prov. 31.30. But I presume your Ladyship hath learnt better Lessons in Christ's School, Eph. 4.20. namely to improve all opportunities in viewing the state of your Soul as the Looking-glass of the Law of Liber∣ty doth represent it to you, James 1.25. and nailing (as it were) the Eyes of your Mind, to the substance of the Word of God, which you do prefer above all the most costly Chrystal▪ Mirrours in the World, as it doth exceed and excel them in many unparallel'd excellenceis. As (1st.) In its Clearness; no Dooking-glass that is but of Man's making, can be compred to this Mirrour of the Word which is of God's own making. (2dly.) In its Truth, making no false Representations of evil for good, or of foul for fair, as some Artificial Glasses will do. (3dly.) In its Largeness; for God's Word sheweth to those that seriously inspect it, what they are within, as well as without, and what they are behind, as well as before, which the best Glass of Man's making cannot perform▪ (4thly.) In its Duration; one foul fall may break the finest Looking-glass, but this of God's Word doth last for ever, and not one tittle of it can fail, John 10.35. Matth. 5.18. Yea, it will serve at laft to break those who endeavour to break the Commands of it by a wilful neg∣lect, or a scornful contempt, John 12.48. (5thly.) In its singular Efficacy; this Divine Glass can smooth those wrinkles, wash away
those spots, and amend those faults which it discovereth, when the Spirit doth take Chariot in the Word, John 17.17. Luke 5.17. (6 thly.) In its manifold Variety of Images it presents and represents for an holy imitation by all Ladies in all after-Ages; yea, and all those Images or Objects are to be seen at large, and all at once (which is both impracti∣cable and impossible in common Looking-glasses) by a sincere inspection into it. Those holy Ima∣ges for imitation are threefold: The first is of holy Persons; the second is of holy Actions; and the third is of holy Qualifications, all re∣lating to the Female Sex. First; of the first, The Holy Persons, or Religious Ladies, that the Looking-glass of God's Word doth represent to open view, are many, both in the Old and in the New Testament, all for holy Patterns and Imitation. (1st.) In the Old Testament. As (1.) Sarah leads the Van like a Royal Lady, and is presented as a most eminent Ex∣ample to all Ladies for Faith, Obedience, &c. Heb. 11.11. 1 Pet. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. (2.) Rebekah, Gen. 25.22. and 27.4, 6. (3.) Rahab, Josh. 2.11. James 2.25. Heb. 11.31. (4.) Deborah, Judg. 4.4. & 5.1, &c. (5) Naomi and Ruth, Ruth 1.16, 20, &c. (6.) Manoah's Wife, Judg. 13.3, 23, &c. (7.) Hannah, 1 Sam. 1.13.28. & 2.1, 2, &c. (8.) Abigail, 1 Sam. 25.25, 26, 28, 31, &c. (9.) Bathshebah, Prov. 31.1, &c. (10.) The Queen of Sheba, 1 Kings 10.1, 8, 9. Matth. 12.42. (11.) The Shunamite, 2 Kings 4, 8, 9, 10. (12). The Widow of Zareptah, 2 Kings 17.12, 15, 18, 24. (13.) Esther, chap. 2.20. &c 4.16, &c. To name no more here for brevity's sake. (2dly.) In the New Testa∣ment; As (1.) The blessed Virgin Mary, who found favour with God above all Women, &c. Luke 1.30.46, &c. (2.) Elizabeth, Luke 1.6, 42. (3.) Anna, Luke 2.36, 37. (4.) Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary, Matth. 28. v. 1, &c. (5.) Joanna the Wife of Chusa, and Susanna, Luke 8.3. & 24.10. (6.) Priscilla, Acts 18.18.26. (7.) Tabitha or Dorcas, Acts 9.36. (8.) Phoebe, Rom. 16.1. (9.) Lois and Eunice, 2 Tim. 1.5. Many more might be added, seeing some Criticks do observe that, the New Testament affords more holy Women upon Record, than the Old doth. Secondly, The Holy Actions of Religious Women (that are Recorded for imitation, Rom. 15.4.) be many more than the Confines of an Epistle can contain. Take a few Instances, beside that of Sarah (whose Name Hebr. signifies a Lady, or Princess) above-mentioned. As (1st.) 'Tis a lasting monument upon the heads of those, wise-hearted Women, who span with their hands Blue, Purple and Scarlet, &c. for the use of the Tabernacle in Moses's Time, Exo. 35.25. I do not at all doubt but your Ladiship hath spun fairer Threads for the Service of
the New Jerusalem, &c. (2 dly) 'Tis a Memoir of great Honour to those De∣vout Women who so willingly resigned up their own curious Looking-glasses, that a Sacred Laver of Brass for God's Service be made of them, Exod. 38.8. Resol∣ving, that whereas other Women, out of vanity, do spend many hours in looking upon their Looking-glasses; these zealous Souls will spend their precious Time bet∣ter in Fasting and Prayer at the Door of the Tabernacle: Likewise I dare with confidence affirm, Madam, that you spend much more precious Time in looking into the Looking-glass of God's Word, how you may adorn the hidden Man of your heart, 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. to render you the more acceptable to your Creator, &c. than you do to compose your Outward Dress in your common Glass for Acceptance among Fellow-creatures; and you could freely sacrifice all your Artificial Looking glasses, so the glory of God's service might there∣by be promoted. (3dly) Abigail is fa∣mous upon Record for her meek and quiet Temper (which is in God's sight of great price, 1 Pet. 3.3.) who would not cross her Husband while the Spring∣tide of his Passion lasted; but she pru∣dently waited until it was a low Ebbing-water, and then she made an effectual Application, 1 Sam. 25.36, 37. And 'tis a Ruled Case, that the Husband and the Wife should never be angry both to∣gether, &c. (4thly) Phoebe hath an high Title of Honour given her, Rom. 16.2. where she is called not so much an Helper, but a Patroness; as the word  signifies. (5thly.) Priscilla is called a Co-worker with the Apostle, as the word  signifies, Rom. 16.3. see verse 6. and 12. There is not Room to add more Instances.
Thirdly; The holy Qualifications summ'd up together, (1.) Virtuous, Ruth 4.11. (2.) Gracious, Prov. 11.16. (3.) Prudent, Prov. 14.1. (4.) Faith∣ful, 1 Tim. 3.11. (5.) Sober. (6.) Grave. (7.) Chast. (8.) Holy, &c. Titus 2.5. 1 Pet. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If I say these Virtues have an happy conjunction in you, I can assure you, Madam, 'tis not the stinking breath of a sordid Sycophant; for I must say with Elihu, [I know not
to give flattering Titles to any; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away] Job 32.21, 22. This I must say, you affect not the vanity of those foolish fashions drawn up by the Finger of God himself in that Map of one and twenty Ornaments, Isa. 3. where the Moons there mentioned, verse 18. (which Women wore upon their heads then) seem now grown to the full Moon, in our wanton Dames; but your Dress is decent, rather below than above your Station, &c. That you may retain your Honour by Humility, as the strong Man retaineth Riches (by Wisdom and Power) Prov. 11.16. That you may still walk humbly with your Ma∣ker, both in God's Arm, and in God's Armour; and that all those Sacred Truths contained in this Volume may be writ by the Spirit of God upon the Table of your heart, as the Epistle of Christ, 1 Cor. 3.3. is the unfeigned prayer of.
