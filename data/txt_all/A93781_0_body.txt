My LORD,
THe ample experience I have had of your Favour and Benignity, both at home and abroad, com∣mands me to put these Pape nder the shelter of your Lordships pro∣ection: Which I do not so much to let he world see my gratitude, as to satise y self in point of judgement and disre∣tion.
 For were I altogether a stranger t your Person, or to that place which wa once my Home by your Lordships good∣ness; yet the Rarity of your unblemishe Honour in this ignoble age, and the Emi∣nency of your Heroick Spirit, would in vite me to cast my anchor on the firmes bottom.

My Lord, You shall meet with nothing in this Treatise that may preserve it from contempt and scorn, more then the plain∣ness and sincerity of it; which being directed to your Tenants (in discharge of my faithfulness to them) owes it self in the first place unto your Lordship, which
 I shall follow with my prayers, that God would make it unto them a Glass wherein they may see the error of their doings in these rebellious times; and that he would preserve your Lordship to be yet a more glorious Instrument of his justice, upon a Blood-thirsty and Decitful Generation of Hypocrites. This shall be the constant and sincere Devotion of
