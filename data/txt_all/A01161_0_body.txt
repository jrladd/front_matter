IF in this Epistle, (Excellent La∣dies) I containe not my stile within the bounds of breuitie, let the large scope which the fielde of your vertues proffereth, bee a sufficient excuse to my imputed blame: if in the course of the worke, which this Epistle presen∣teth to your Patronage, multitude of errors haue beene ouerslipped, yet I humbly beseech it bee so much graced by your beautie, as what is good may bee acceptable vnto you, and my infirmities which are most may with all other (who bee they neuer so great, are or haue beene seruantes to some in your place) for your sake lye couered, my weaknesse beeing the more augmented, in that my pen is so meere a straunger to my profession, en∣tertayning it onelye, and that rarelye to ouercome that Idle∣nes

of time, which to my selfe is ouer familiar, rather in wast and void papers exercising the fame, then fit for any ende or purpose. Among which a few parcells haue ne Translated by me some yeeres since vnseene or vnthought of and had stil so continued, had J not (Noble Countesse) beene by those which had full power ouer me otherwise enioyned. Wherein I haue sooner chosen to eternise my own insufficiencie, the render their perfections any waies vnsatisfied. And therfore haue made choice to publish these fower first Bookes by an vnknowne (without name, but a most iust and faithful) Author, at the first digested in a forren tongue, wherein J must needes yeelde to adde so much more to my owne vnperfectnesse, as shall come within the view of your eyes, or pon∣der of your iudgement, as then receiuing most blemish, when you shall vouchsafe the Author in his owne and proper language: Who cannot in himselfe but much satisfie such is his stile, iudge∣ment, truth and varietie of matter, wherein the minde of man most delighting, doth vndoubtedly couet Historie, before all o∣ther writinges, and if Historie what more pleasing then is in him contained? So many euents and alterations disclosed; secret disseins, and intentions of mightie Princes reuealed; Emper∣ours not enduring equalitie, Kings disdained, swelling warres, treacherous truces, Popes practisers, and triumphing in periu∣ries, generall Councels disauowed, Empires voluntarily resig∣ned, princes murthered, Crownes vsurped, Popes deposed, Rome beseaged, his holines and Cardinals in danger to be hunger star∣ued, descriptions of Citties, Townes, Castles and fortes, repre∣sentations of Royall armies, Inundations, Plagues, Earth∣quakes, famines, and other Gods wrathfull iudgementes, Sects and Scismes in hollie Churches, hot persecutions, Religion made a Couerture to faction and ambition: the selfe same Kings at one instant prosecuting in their owne Realmes, what in person they

assisted, and protected in the Empire; with the true cause, roote & foundation of al the miseries, which the state of Christendome at this day, and since fiftie yeares hath endured; vnder the dis∣course of the French estate, ouerrunning al worthie occurents of Europe, Turkie, and America: A Historie though modern, & familier to many now liuing Actors therein yet yeelding prece∣dence, for matter, methode, knowledge and iudgment, to none, but thee triumphant Tacitus, sacred Emperors lying subiect to thy pen, and the mightiest Monarchy of the earth, to thy censure. As my poore trauailes (which most of all kept me from being willing to diuulge the same) obscured by thy stately Sauile. Exquisite Sauile honour to thy Vniuersitie, though in thy vertue an enemy to me, ouerdropping and shadowing my endeuours, as the high broade Oke doth young and tender sproutes, wrong not thy selfe and country with longer silence of thy pen, proude in thy Author, proude in thy Sainte, and not least proude in the commender of thy worke, thy A. B. thy secret and haughtie Mecaenas, dis∣guised in the two first letters, the whole Alphabet not being en∣ough to set foorth his worthe, but he may not so escape in a shad∣dowe, his eloquence discouereth his Arte, his iudgement his ex∣perience, and his experience (in hauing assaulted the dreadfullst Monarch of our world, to the verie gates of his chiefest Cittie,) hath confirmed his valour, to his neuer dying glorie. But how much the more naked I stande frustrate of countenance, subiect to errors, & so thorough error to reprofe, (as whatsoeuer is mine can be no other worth, so much more (high and worthie Coun∣tesse) doth the power of your patronage in my protection, extend it selfe, and the grace of your fauor in vouchsafing the reading of this worke vnworthie only by my owne vnablenesse, to set it forth vnto you like it selfe. The subiect whereof, though loftie in man∣naging the glorious actions of anointed Soueraignes, and repre∣senting

the fierce exploits of vnmercifull and bloudy warres, can no waies yet be strange, or dissonant to your eares, daughter to so great an Earle of Bedford, graue Councellor, commander and gouernour, sometimes of that Royall towne and Garrison, which bordereth on the Scottish soyle: and deare wife to that redoubted Ambrose, Earle of Warwicke, expert and faithfull Coun∣cellor, (Sonne to so puissant and Magnanimious a Duke) his name, his fame, his valor resounding in foraine Regions, while he had the honour to bee commaunder and Lieutenant generall ouer a Royall English armie, by your birth and Marriage see∣ming to be chosen, and consecrated to Mars himselfe, happie in father, more happie in husband, but most happie in your Soue∣raignes grace, ornament of her Courte, true patterne of pietie, de∣uotion, charitie and vertue.
And you (Excellent Mistrisse) to whome as well for your honour, bountie and fauours, my fruites and Labours are most due; as hauing first vndertaken the same, eating of your bread, vouchsafe your Patronage, & disdaine not my Authors English weede, who presenteth his attendance vpon your Person, at such time as wearied with other occasions, you are accustomed to re∣tire your selfe to your Bookes and Muses. Ʋerified is that in you, that neuer, Les alone; then when most alone, for the more part spending your vacation of time, either in Meditation of holie letter, or conference and reading of some notable and fa∣mous Historie, which whether it treate of peace, pollicie, war, or martiall exploits, can hardly discouer ought, new or strange vnto your wisedome, the one by your high place, long seruices, and Courtelie conuersation, made familiar vnto you, the other by no∣thing more, then the signall acts, and heroicall prowes of Mag∣nanimious and victorious Charles, your Lo. and husband, true patriot, carefull Councellor, vigilant commaunder, rightlie and

iustly deere to his Soueraigne and Countrie, dreadfull to the e∣nemie, terror to traytors, and scourge of Spanish Monarchie, which the defeate of that inuincible army, (for so in Print thē∣seues published) can best testifie, the glorie whereof can not but stirre vp those two young Jmpes of great hope and expectation, (ouer whome you haue euer beene a carefull Cornelia) as well to succeede their renowmed Father, in his vertues (which neuer shal perish) as other his humaine dignities & possessions; wher∣of if you shall not in this Historie haue the like profered to your view, (for no age hath left any such recorde) yet cōtemne not the reading of my Author, by whome you shall receiue the true first motiue of all the Ciuil and foraine warres of Fraunce in our age, and her neighbour Countries: with such memorable accidents and occurents, as continually were ministred. Not like to that impudent, though excellent writer, Paulus Iouius, no lesse wor∣thy to be a Bishoppe, then a Historiographer, who plainly auer∣red, nay was not ashamed himselfe in his Bookes to vaunt, how he made no accounte in writing a lie, were it in matter of conse∣quence, or to please the appetite of great ones, which shoulde set him a worke: for that wher ther was one in his time, which knew the fault from the truth, all posterity hereafter would notwith∣standing belieue and giue credite to what he should set down, my Author contrariwise, hath beene so little tickled with the couet of rewarde or ambition (capitall enemies to the truth) as that he refuseth to set his owne name to his so painefull labours, mildely and with such great temperance ouerrunning the proceedings of all enemies, as hee cannot iustly be suspected of any partiall lea∣ning to the one side more then the other, wishing for my own part that some one ther were (according to my tast giuen) who in this scribling age (whereof translating humours and quoters are plentie) would finish out the rest, many fragments and sundrie

Bookes yet lying by me (as I once intended, but since, through an accident that happened) in a pelt flong away my pen, confi∣ning what I had done, (as I then thought) to vtter darkenesse, weary of giuing Liueries to other mens retayners, like a con∣ceyted builder, rather delighted with an inferiour model of his owne framing, then to rough-cast, or adorne a more goodly and sumptuous pallace left vnto his hands, reseruing my selfe to som∣what (though simplier) of my owne hammering and digesting, which the proiect already being fausied, time may finish and per∣aduenture bring to light, if feare of receiuing foyle by that illust∣rious Camden, doe not otherwise withdrawe my humorfoyle, yet honour enough to be an imitator, and carrier of thy Bookes, (Precious & curious Camden) thy owne Country prints not sufficient to extend thy name, worthy to finde Kinges thy nur∣cing fathers, and Queenes thy nurses; rare Iewell of Britaine land, enemie to inglorious obliuion, tresurer of memorie, trum∣pet of Albyons fame, register of Antiquitie and poursiuant of eternitie.
It now resteth (glorious and beautifull Ladies) adorned with your stately ranke and place, humbly to intercesse pardon for my presumption in seeking so boldely to shrowde the infirmi∣ties of my pen, vnder the shadowe of your winges. And that it will please you to grace with your generall safe conduct this my newe English Denizen to passe from place to place, (free from any Menippean search) vntill he may make his rende-uous in some contemplatiue, or retired hands, who though he now seeme Clownish & Rogish like, yet notwithstāding in his own Country guise, is well esteemed of, & very commendable. In which albe∣it many of you bee singularly well able to iudge of him, yet if it please any of the rest, to vouchsafe to entertayne his broken Eng∣lish, I dare assure that for his discourse, you shall finde him very

delightfull, for his newes not ordinarie, and for his truth can bring good securitie, when soeuer he may be permitted to attend vpon your leasure, not importioning his accesse, vntill weried with your more weightie and serious seruices, a desire may possesse you, insteede of recreation, to spend with him some fewe howers of the day. A matter heretofore accustomed (in my knowledge) by ma∣nie high and loftie Ladies, who often times to be meete with wearisomnes, exercised themselues in studie, & reading of wor∣thie writers, as Marguerite Countesse of Lennox, Anne Coun∣tesse of Oxford, Francis Countesse of Sussex, Elizabeth Coun∣tesse of Lincolne, the Ladie Marie Sydney (liuing my thrice honoured mistresse) truely liberall and bountifull, rare Mother of so heroicall an ofspring, by her noble minde and cariage easily discouering greatnes of birth and Princely parentage; and that wise good, and godly Ladie aduancer of so many excellent perso∣nages, both in Arte and Armes, employing her credite with her Soueraigne, (then whome none had greater) in doing good offi∣ces, for all sortes in generall, but especially preferring those, in whome she might perceiue any signification of vertue to appeare. That graue Matron, harmelesse Courtier, and faithfull ser∣uant Francis Barones of Cobham, (late wife to the noble L. and trustie Councellor yet liuing) to whome I was so much bound (in many duties being likewise to the whole house) as that both in her health and languishing Maladie, she sundrie times ad∣mitted me, to conferre or reade with her, finding in the Ecclesi∣asticall Historie her most delight. But no waies may I heere without extreame note of grosse ouersight pretermit in this lift, that famous Religious and learned Ladie (flower of her fami∣lie,) prouident mother, blessed in her posteritie, Mildred Ba∣rones of Burghlie, besides her knowledge in the Latine letters, (wherein of a subiect she excelled) such were her studies, exer∣cises,

and continuall Meditation in the Greeke Doctors of the Church, (especially Basil, Ciril, Chrisostome and Nazi∣anzene,) as a chiefe reader in that tonge (Laurence by name) hath ere now confessed vnto me, that in his iudgemēt she Egalled if not ouermatched any, in whose profession (as expected so) most was to be required. Neither were these excellent parts of hers, onely Theoricall, but still put in practise like an other Dorcas, full of piety and good works, as without any ostentation or , besides her readines in solliciting for poore and distressed sutors vnto her deare Lo. (the auncients Councellor of Europe, Pater Patriae, piller of the state, thorough whose prudent pollicie, and carefull watchings iustly may be applied, Neque periculum in R. P. fuit grauius unquam, noc maius otium) in her life time setting on her owne charge so many poore aworke, her exhi∣tition to Schollers, liberallitie to Vniuersities, bountie to exiled strangers, and her most abounding charitie euerie quarter to all the prisons about London hath manifestly declared; I hope that in so long insisting vpon the vertues of this Lady and others, I shall not be misliked, for insinuation, lesse feare to be suspected, namelesse like my Author and yet if knowne most will confirme, that Non mihi promptum in adulationes ingenium. But I haue the rather presumed of your patience, in delighting of these honourable personages, to the end to incite you to treade in their steps, and imitate their examples. Such as you are, were they, and such as they now are, shall euerie one of you be, who though they seeme faded, and as it were vanished from among vs, yet doth their goodnesse, and memorie stil remaine fresh and fixed in the minds and harts of manie.
But how can it otherwise fare (Illustrious Ladies) but that you must needes succeede, or rather abounde in all or greater worthinesse hauing the honour and blisse to bee trayned vpp,

in the same Schoole, from the which they (and all other) borrow their light as the Moone doth frō the Sun, at the mouth of that diuine Oracle, Ex cuius ore, melle dulcior fluit oratio, that sacred Queene, vnmachable and victorious Ʋirgine, Supere∣minens omnes, Mans mirror, Ioues darling, worlds wonder, and natures perfection, whose Angelicall face so often as I doe beholde, (as behold to often I can not) me thinketh J still (with daseled eyes) see as it were in full aspect Solarem Maiestatem, cum Saturnina grauitate.
That the powerful and essentiall thing of things, may number the peaceable yeeres of her Raigne like the sands of the Sea, that the shadow gonne downe in the Dyall of Ahaz, may be ten and ten degrees brought backward, that the Sunne abide, and the Moone stand still, vntill she may be auenged of her enemies. Let all her Subiects pray, our age rest thankefull, posteritie admire, and the heauens eternise her name for euer.
