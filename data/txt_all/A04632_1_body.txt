I Vnderstand you, Gentlemen, no your houses: and a worthy suc∣cession of you, to all time, as be∣ing borne the Iudges of these studies. When I wrote this Poeme, I had friendship with diuers in your societies; who, as they were great Names in learning, so they were no lesse Examples of liuing. Of them, and then (that I say no more) it was not despis'd. Now that the Printer, by a doubled charge, thinkes it worthy a lon∣ger life, then commonly the ayre of such things doth promise; I am carefull to put it a seruant to their plea∣sures, who are the inheriters of the first fauour borne it. Yet, I command, it lye not in the way of your more noble, and vse-full studies to the publike. For so I shall suffer for it: But, when the gowne and cap is off, and the Lord of liberty raignes; then, to take it in your hands, perhaps may make some Bencher, tincted with humanity, reade: and not repent him.
