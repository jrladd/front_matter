Precious and Beloved:
THere be but two irresistable arguments  any ingenuous nature to resigne ones selfe to the desire of another, viz. That of duty, and that of affection; both which (you know) hath strongly engaged me both to preach and print this Sermon, upon this sad and sodaine occasion; the former task required by the deceased himselfe, whose very relation (being a Father so full of care and affection to us all) heares the nature of an injunction, not to be disobeyed: the latter importuned by the concurrent request of you all surviving so neerly related; that except I could put off duty and humanity at once, without all dispute, you must be also gratified: which undertaken, I presume to make mine earnest request to you all in some few particulars; which I hope the Lord Jesus will both move and enable you readily to condescend to me in, viz.
 1. That so precious a patterne and president of vertue and piety be really imitated of you all.
2. That you be practicall, and turne the words you de∣sired of me, into the works which God requireth of you.
3. That by the savory Ʋnction of brotherly concord amongst our selves, you will endeavour with me to be so con∣solatory to our deare surviving Parent, that albeit we can∣not supply her invaluable losse, yet we may argue our gratefull acknowledgment of her right commendable be∣haviour to, and paines with him who is now with the Lord.
4. Lastly, that you will excuse me, and make mine apo∣logy for speaking so little in the prayse of him that deser∣ved so much; mine affection and experience indeed in∣stigates: but counsell to one so aproximate must be obser∣ved, viz. Let another praise thee and not thine owne Prov. 27. 2. mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. So I commend you to the provident care of him who is faithfull, and bath promised so much to the widow and fatherlesse; and in him, according to my severall relations, to each of you, rest,
