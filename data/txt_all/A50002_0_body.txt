My Lord,
HAving not long since undertook to vindicate the eminent and glorious Church of England, from the Errors and Superstitions of the Church of Rome, to blot out the false asper∣sions which the Enemies of the Church and Nation put upon the Liturgy and Rights which she observes in the pub∣lick and sacred Worship of God; I could not choose among the Nobility of this Countrey, a fitter Person then your Honour to patronise that Work: I know
(though unknown to you) the rare qua∣lities and commendable vertues of your Honour; they being scattered abroad by your glorious fame; I am not ignorant what a Noble and Loyal Subject, the Great though Exiled Monarch of Eng∣land had in your most generous Person, when all things were in confusion a∣mongst us, and Subjects rebellious to their King; I have often heard that the Sequestred Clergy found a Protection and Refuge under your eminent good∣ness, as your Ancestours, as well as your Honourable Person, received with all affection strangers, nay, all those that were faithfull to his Majesty our Gracious Monarch, whom God pre∣serve, were welcome to your Honour: Your Lordship was not afraid to ven∣ture both life and Estate, to serve so ex∣cellent and incomparable a Prince, be∣cause it was your glory, nay, more then
that, the glorious fame of your merits tels me, that your care was to preserve the Church as well as the State; you did strengthen the afflicted members of the Church of England, that they might keep close to their Mother; and now the chiefest of your Lordships Enterpri∣ses clearly appears to be the bringing of the discontented people of this Nation to a better understanding; that they may be united with those that do sin∣cerely honour the King, and acknow∣ledge their mother the Church of Eng∣land under the government of their pi∣ous and most reverend Bishops; par∣don me then (my Lord) if I have assu∣med the boldness to present your Ho∣nour with a Vindication of the Church our Mother, whom to protect was your great ambition, from the errours and superstitions of the Church of Rome, where I have had my Education; for as
I am not the first who have adven∣tured a Dedication to so Noble a Per∣son to whom the Authour is unknown, so I thought I might do this, and per∣haps without offence to your Lord∣ship; seeing the incomparable good∣ness of your most Honourable Per∣son assures me of your kinde acce∣ptance, and makes me confident that you will not reject a stranger, who wisheth you all prosperity and happi∣ness, and further demands that favour, to be,
My Lord,
