SIR,
THE former Discourses were long since Dedicated to your Worthy Brother, now with God, and they have born several Impressions. It is high time these should follow, to complete The Defence of Christian Religion; and they gladly come forth under your
Name, hoping for the like fa∣vourable reception amongst in∣genuous Readers; because the Author is the same, and the Translator; and the De∣dication now will add as much Grace to this little Piece as the former hath received. And it serves my Design as well, that is to remain as a little Mo∣nument of my Thankfulness to your self and your Noble Fa∣mily, whom I daily pray God to bless.
