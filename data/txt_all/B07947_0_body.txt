REnowned Rulers of this sacred seat,
Wherein all goodnesse, graciously abound,
Whose fames for worth, whose vertues are compleat
Whose liues are lights, whose learnings are profound▪
Amongst all these, who loue your vertues best,
And they whose workes vnfained witnesse beare,
I'm loath to bee, the last, albeit the least,
Who would approue, how I your worth admeare.
Therefore let this invention of my Muse,
(Which though not worthie, boldly weares the ba
Of these your names, even for its worthiest chus
Obtaine your loue, its errors to inhedge:
And let it please you, these my Lynes to take
Into good part, and doe my paines approue:
If nought for else, yet for affections sake,
And for assurance heereby of my loue:
And since I know your generous minds admit,
A signe of loue, as were more worth therein:
Heerefore am bold to beate my braines and wit,
To see if I can to your vertues win:
For loe for loue, on my part of your worth,
And through desire for to ingraue your glore,
I haue imployde my pen, for to set forth,
Your just deserts, by men admyrde before.
And that my Lynes may ever witnesse bee,
For to impart a portion of your praise,
Although such knowledge not consists in mee,
To wryte your worth, or dignities to raise:
Yet though my words▪ should render but a view,
And not attaine, the full to testifie,
This I professe to bee your proper due,
Yee are of the superlatiue degree.
And as th' Arcadians, gaue to Pales bot
A fleece of woole to testifie their loue:
Th' Athenians loe, to Pallas did alot,
A dish of O liues, duetie to approue,
So likewise I, haue with these two nothing
To giue, but these vnpolisht lynes of mine:
Which I confesse not worthie is to bring
 such Patrones, for my first propyne.
 Minerva, did an Owle defend,
 vnder covert of her Targ at saue:
 did her liuely armes extend,
 the deformde Cyclops might perceaue.
 Apollo by his heav'nly Lute,
, night-raven, vnder it did hyde:
 please you, to supplie my sute,
 eerein keepe my errors vnespyde:
 I finde the secreet of my thought,
 can know, till they the same shall view,
 perfection fully brought,
 loue was firmely fixt on you:
And though sometimes I secreetly did send,
Some lynes abroad, or yet to publicke eye,
My aime was ay, but that I might amend,
The same to you, your worth to testifie.
Considering then, the worthinesse of you,
I did determine, as the trueth requyrde,
Yee were the onely object whom I knew,
My Muse of duetie ought to haue aspyrde.
Therefore at last these Lynes I did compose,
Which being done, I doe present them heere,
To craue your aid, to keepe them from their foes,
Which if they finde, they shall not fret for feare.
And I who pend them, shall your praise proclame,
And still procure your honours rest on hie:
Your severall names, and actions conquese fame,
Which by all ages may admeered bee:
Then in the ballance of affection, proue
And try my labours, if they equall are,
Vnto one motion, of my matchlesse loue,
And yee shall find my favour passe them farre:
And though I can no protestations make,
Yet for your honour, I shall alwayes pray,
Vnto such tyme, as I occasion take,
To proue more largely I am yours for ay.
Thus you intreating, yee will pleased bee,
Them to receaue, and loue them for the Art,
Whence in some maner, they proceede yee see,
And doe receaue resemblance in apart:
So of you all, what is divine as due,
I to the three vnited powers commend,
And what is subject vnto change of you
I know your valour alwayes will defend
As for my part, what power I can afford,
To death I shall still honour Bon-acord.
