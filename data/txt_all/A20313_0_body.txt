COnsideryng with my self (rigt worshipfull) that it is not onely sufficiente for menne towardes their benefactors, to beare an in¦ward affection, and minde gratulatorie for benefites receiued, but also, that some outward and exter∣nall token, of necessitie bee thereto adioyned, liuely to expresse outwardly, the secrete affectes of the same, though notwithstandyng inwarde good will, bee suche an excellent vertue, as who so euer hath it, stādes partly in securitie, but who soeuer hath and expresseth it, to hym is all thng made sure: Euen so, and for because I haue uer

studied, and imployed my diligence, to flee vn∣thankefulnesse, that notable vice detested of God and man, and to imbrace gratefulnesse, that hea∣uenly Sacrifice, approued of God, manifestyng it to the whole worlde, in discharge of my duetie towardes my Lorde your father, whom for many respectes, vnfainedly I honour, and in hym to your worship as a pattrē of all benignitie, proce∣ding from so honorable a kindrede, with all seme∣ly reuerence I worship, I saie with all humilitie, sinceritie, and integritie of mynde, as a notable argument of my vnfained good will, these my la∣bours beyng the fruites of my trauell, I humblie doe offer, assuryng my self of your fauorable coū∣tenaunce therein, to whose protection I am so muche the more bolder to commēde them, by how muche I vnderstande your excellent Nature to∣wardes all laudable exercises. And though (per∣aduenture) some will impute me arrogante, and passyng presumptuous in attemptyng the same: Hauyng respect but onely to the naked partes of the outward gifte and giuer, not waiyng the in∣ward motion of the mynde, whereof the outward accions spryng, nor yet sufficiently ponderyng, that as it is impossible, for fire to be without heate

or the Sunne without brightnesse, no more can the good meanyng of the good bee for euer repressed, but that at the laste it bursteth forthe & is made manifeste, shewyng it self openly muche like the flames of fire, after a thicke and smouldryng smoke: not yet diligently consideryng, like wise and cunnyng Carpenters, that by how muche the weaker a house and buildyng is, by so muche the stronger ought the postes and pillers to bee, (I saie) thei hauyng regard to none of these thyn∣ges, or at the leaste not fullie consideryng theim, neither remembryng how commendable a thyng it is, for euery creature to yeelde his fruite sim∣plye in his naturall kinde, without colouryng or dissimulation, bee it little or muche, but ra∣ther castynge their eyes like sencelesse beastes downe to the grounde, chauntyng vppon the outwarde Elementes, damnyng, and con∣demnyng those externall actions, signes, and to∣kens, and as vaine, friuolous, and of no effect, yet not withstandyng this maie not discomfort me in that whiche I haue here determined, but that (maugree their beardes) my good will muste ap∣peare, giuyng them to vnderstande, that it is as possible for them, to put the whole seas, into a lea∣ther

Bottle, and to driue all the VVoodkarne of Irelande, into one Shepheardes bagge, or Satchell, as it is to driue me from my pretended purpose, because I knowe it consisteth in your worshippes free choise, and libertie, to make bothe the gifte, and giuer, seeme sufficient worthie, &c. Thus be∣yng emboldened through fame of your courtesie, with hope of remission for this my temeritie, I duetifullie ende, besechyng God to preserue your worship, in good health, and long life, with muche encrease of worship, and honour, &c. At Dublin her Maiesties cheef Citie in Irelande, xvj. of Iune. M.D.LXXVIII.
