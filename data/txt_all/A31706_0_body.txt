SIR:
HAving ended this task of Observations, and
according to your gratious pleasure and com∣mand,
supplied such parts as were wanting
to make up the Totall of these Commenta∣ries:
it doth return again, by the lowest
steps of humblenesse, to implore the high patronage of your
Princely favour; emboldened specially because it carrieth
Caesar and his Fortunes, as they come related from the
same Author:. which, in the deep Judgement of his most
excellent Majesty, is preferred above all other profane
histories; and so commended, by his sacred Authority, to
your reading, as a chief pattern and Master-piece of the
Art of war. And herein your admired wisedome may
happily the rather deem it capable of freer passage, in that
it is not altogether unproper for these happy daies; as
knowing, that War is never so well handled, as when it

is made an Argument of discourse in times of sweet and
plenteous peace. The blessings whereof may ever crown
your years; as the soveraign good of this temporarie life,
and the chiefest Ornaments of Princely condition.
