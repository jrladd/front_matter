RIGHT Honourable Lords; I formerly Dedicated a small Treatise vnto the Honourable Societie of the reuerend Iudges, who then filled the awfull seates of Law and Iustice. I aduen∣ture the second time to present it, reuiewed, augmented, and cleared from some part of that darknesse which haply hath hitherto clouded it from bright acceptance. Information tending vnto truths discouerie, though from the meanest wit or person vnto your Lordships, cannot be vnacceptable, whom Law doth make the Sentensers of Trueth; which is the Soule and Sentense of the Law. The matter and subject propounded is not trifling or vn∣worthy, nor can be any disdaine vnto Noble great∣nesse;

nor is vnto any Honourable order more pro∣per then to your Lordships. Indeede the difficultie of the matter presseth a studious consideration, an orderly continuall linking and holding together of all materiall circumstances vnto the maine scope, a faith∣full and strong memorie, quicknesse of apprehension and solide iudgement, but in the end vnto such as are industrious and desirous of Trueth, will yeeld a de∣lightfull and thanke-worthy compensation thereof. I presume not to direct or prescribe, nor doe purposely oppose any other different opinion, but inoffensiuely tender my owne vnto the publique good, and hauing meerely deuoted it vnto truth; doe humbly submit it vnto your Lordships, the vowed Patrons of right and truth:
