HAuing reserued the Copie hereof (Right Ho∣norable, and gentle Readers) these fortie yeares for many secrete vses, corrected by the most learned of our time, and feeling my self, now through age declining, and otherwise hyndred with troublesome suites in law, which cōstrained me to discontinew these and such other cōmendable prac∣tises, for the benefite and defence of my Pince and Coun∣trie: I haue thought good to publish the same, the rather for that there are but a few copies left, and those for the most parte corrupted by negligence, or mistaking of igno∣rant writers thereof: Being partly encouraged hereunto by the learned Philosopher Seneca, who accompteth it an Act meritorious to preserue or reuiue Science from the Cinders, and to eternize vertuous acts with perpetual me∣morie: Finding it strange, that so excellent a Monument as this most rare and learned worke of George Ripley, should so long lye hidden in obscuritie, & passe frō hand to hand a hundreth and fiftie yeares without vtter defacing; see∣ing that many notable works published, haue in far shorter time perished. He liued in the time of king Edward the 4. & Richard the vsurper, in great fame & estimation, for his rare knowledge in these secrets: And to vtter his further cōmendatiō in a word; if this his worke be perused with the

eye of iudgement, and practised by those that are experi∣enced, I shall not neede to feare the losse of my labour, when some of my Countriemen which cannot attaine vn∣to the highest hidden mysterie, shall yet finde many things both pleasant and profitable, diuers wayes seruiceable to Kingdomes, States, and Common weales: And if one amōg tenne thousand can hitt the marke, (whereat the whole worlde hath aymed) we shall not hereafter neede to seeke out the Sandes of Ganges, for that which lyeth hid in the secrets of Ripley: which I offer here to the view of the lear∣ned, and haue presumed the publishing hereof, chiefly for the benefite of my Countrey men; and especially to satisfie the often & importunate request of many my learned good friēds, not doubting but that the skilfull wil yeelde me my due▪ howsoeuer the ignorant shal esteeme therof: which if I shall finde to be accepted according to my good meaning, I shall therby be further encouraged to imparte some other rare experiments of Distillations and Fire-workes of great seruice, not hitherto committed in writing or put in prac∣tise by any of our nation; although of late some meere toies haue beene highly admired, and extraordinarily rewarded: The charge whereof will be found vtterly lost, when per∣fect tryall shall be made of their slender vse and force. To conclude, If this my good intent shalbe answerable to your expectations, I haue obteined the fulnes of my desires.
