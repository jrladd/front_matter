THE Kinges Majesty (right honorable) myn¦ded a fauour to my poor studies, vvhich M. lames Melvin vvrote I should look for. Yf it please anie of your Lordships, to putt his highnes in mind, I hope it vvillbe sone performed. And I vvold glad∣ly take one yeres paie, of that vvhich vvas purposed yerelie. Besides, I am to request your Lordships to consider a Genevean injurie done to me for the Kin¦ges sake: That, I have expressed in an Epistle vnto themselves. Yf the King knevv the vvhole mat∣ter, his Majestie vvold be readier to vveigh my dā¦ger for his affaires: & to further my paines, for the common good of Christendome.
