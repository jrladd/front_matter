SIR,
THe Psalmist speaketh of those that go down to the Sea in Ships, that they not only see the Works of the Lord, and his Wonders in the Deep, (Psalm 107.23, 24.) but also that they meet with dangers and difficulties in that Deep. As they see somthing that causeth
Wonder and admiration, so also something that causeth Fear and Consternation. St Paul speakes of his perils in the Sea. And as it was the say∣ing of one, Qui nescit orare, discat navigare, thereby in∣timating that at Sea men shall meet with such dangers and difficulties that will put them upon crying every man to his God, as it did those Mari∣ners, Jon. 1.5. Dangers I know you meet with at Sea, and although you are safely arri∣ved here, yet dangers and diffi∣culties are to be expected. You and all Christians (while on this side Heaven) are still upon a Sea; so is this World said to be (Rev. 15.9.)
a Sea of Glass mingled with Fire.
Sir, I present you with this small Tract, the Scope of which, is, To teach you and all Christians, the Art of bearing troubles without much troubling of themselves. It is only to shew us (if we must fall into trouble) how to make our fall the easier, viz. Forward, and not back∣ward, into troubles foreseen, and not into troubles that were not fore-thought. And this is by putting cases of difficulty to our selves, till God bring us to our desi∣red Haven, which is Hea∣ven.











So wishing you all Happi∣ness Temporal, but especially Spiritual and Eternal,
