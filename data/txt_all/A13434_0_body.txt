Lord, Maister, Good∣man, Gaffer, or Knaue, Lady, Mistresse, Good∣wife, Gammer, or Whore, Readers.
I Would not haue you to take me for a Bawde or a Pander, for that I send a Whore amongst you; for though it be my pleasure to call her so, yet you in the perusing of her, and conuersing with her; shall finde her honester then some of your Wiues or Mothers: indeede shee hath no great Kindred to boast of, for my poore braine like Ioue was the fa∣ther and mother that begat and bare her like a new Pall as And my Pen the Midwife that first wrap'd her inragged verses in stead of cloutes, where the Printer hath vs'd her as he would be loth to be vs'd himselfe, for he hath publish'd and proclaim'd all her faults to the view of the world, and yet I know the poore Whores paine is not past, for now she is to be examin'd a thousand wayes, & tortur'd vpon
the Rack of censure, and amongst all that shal view and handle her, the hot whoremaister will deale most discourteously with her, for when he perceiues her honesty too hard for his Knauery, he will in an∣ger, with three tushes, foure pishes, fiue mewes, six wry mouthes, and seuen suruy faces, teare her and pull her worse then the Rusticall Rabblement did vse to vse cōmon whores on former Shroue. Tuesdayes. But all's one, let him doe his worst, she is confidently arm'd with Innocencie: and the threates or danger of the bad, cannot affright her but that she will attempt to recreate the good. In a word, all that is amisse in her, I pray you impute to my bad Tutorship, and her owne frailety; all that I hope of her, is, that she is a merry Whore, full of good words: A kinde Whore to bee had for money or loue any where; a true Whore and  constant, for shee will neuer forsake any man that will keepe her: and (by reason shee is an honest Whore) she is a poore Whore, and hath neither money nor Sprats; so take my Whore amongst yon as she is.
Now after this, I'le be exceeding briefe
To send another Pamphlet call'd a Thiefe;
The Hue and Cry is out, and I protest,
Thought he scape hanging, yet he shall be prest.
