IT is not many Years since England stood in need of Two Great Salvations, one was from our professed Enemies in the Land, and the other, and far greater, the open Wickedness and Ungodliness abounding therein. Your Majesties have not only been the Glorious Instruments of the first, but have made several Pious Attempts and Endea∣vours towards a Deliverance of us from the last; not only by your own vertuous Examples, but also by commanding the Laws against Vice and Immorality to be effectually put in Execution: Whereby your Majesties have given a Publick Testimony against that which you know is so hateful to God, and de∣structive to Government; and that Achan which has so troubled our Israel, and interrupted our Joshua in his laudable Enterprizes against the Canaanites and the Philistines. And if inferiour Magistrates or Offi∣cers



have, or do neglect to prosecute your Maje∣sties pious Orders, they have a great deal to an∣swer for to your Majesties, and more to God they will bring the Guilt of others Sins upon themselves. The Design of this Paper, is an humble Attempt of the like tendency with your Majesties, and en∣tirely subordinate thereunto, and therefore is hum∣bly prostrated at your Royal Feet, both for Acce∣ptance and Protection, by one who can in Sinceri∣ty subscribe himself,
