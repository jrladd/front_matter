My Lord,
YOU may please to re∣member, that some while ago I acquainted your Lordship, with my inten∣tion to Translate into English the Life of Hai Eb'n Yockdan, or The Self-taught Philosopher; which had been set forth some years before, in Arabick and Latin, by the Care and Pains of our

Learned Professor of the Orien∣tal Tongues in the University of Oxford. At which time you were pleased, not only to en∣courage me unto the work, but even to ingage me to the under∣taking it. Since that, I have dis∣patched it at last, after many Diversions, and amidst as ma∣ny Interruptions. And upon the Review have ventured to send it abroad into the World; being willing to hope, that it may not only please for the rarity of the Subject, but pro∣fit also in some measure and Degree, in regard of its Com∣modiousness and Seasonableness; among the Men of this licen∣tious Generation, whereof some are too loose in their Principles, and others in their Practices; the one living by no Rule, and the other by no certain

one, but giddily following their own Phancies, or other Mens Opinions, whom they have unadvisedly chosen to them∣selves for the Guides of their Faith and Manners. Whereas the Philosopher, whose life is here described, will instruct them in such principles of Mo∣rality and Religion, and such alone, as the light of Nature discovers, and which must needs be acknowledged for True by all those, who will judge and act as Men, according to the Dictates of Reason, and the Conclusions resulting from Experience. And I heartily wish indeed, that All of us were arrived even thus far, by the guidance of this light, and agreed in such principles as humane Reason teacheth out of the Book of Nature, which sets forth to our view Gods

works of Creation and Provi∣dence. For this foundation be∣ing laid, there would be more hopes of agreement about that, which the Supernatural light of Revelation discovers to our Faith, and superstructs thereupon. But your Lordship will find the usefulness of this History, in its Philosophical and Theological discoveries, more amply set down in the Preface, which comprehends the chief parti∣culars, and acquaints the Reader with the main of it design. And however my de∣sign in publishing this Tran∣slation thrive abroad in the World, yet I have good hope that it will not fail of its end in obtaining your Lordship's fa∣vourable Acceptance, and re∣main as a Testimonial of my Gratitude for the many, and long

continued favours, received from your Lordship; which as they do at present, so will al∣ways ingage me for the fu∣ture, to shew and approve my self upon all good Opportu∣nities,
My much honoured Lord,
