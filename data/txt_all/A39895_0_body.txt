SIR,
THe severall ties and deepe en∣gagements that have sometime combin'd me to your Honour (have in a manner) inforced me to present and humbly dedicate my little Mannuall Echo, or Silver-Trumpet, unto your knowing view; I must confesse, I tooke it out of your owne study, I meane the Word of God; which how you doe affect, unto the world is knowne apparently: witnesse your valour and couragi∣ous Acts in still resisting those that have at∣tempted for to suppresse the holy and all sa∣ving Word of God. But Sir, thinke it not strange that I present you with a gift which every day, if so you please, you freely may
 command; for though the irregularity and mis∣demeanour of too many has now of late some∣thing eclipst & blemisht the quality, God at the first ordained it for a good & better end; as you may read in very many places of the Scripture. I doe remember a pregnant story in the third of Daniel, where Nebuchadnezzar dedicates his Golden Image in the plain of Dura, that when the Princes, the Governours, and Captaines, the Judges, the Treasurers, the Counsellors, the Sheriffes, and all the Rulers of the Provinces were punctually assembled: presently after the Heralds voyce there was the Cornet, Flute, Harpe, Sackbut, Psaltery, Dulcimer, and other sorts of Musicke, but not a Trumpet mentio∣ned; the reason (I conceive) was this, God would not have so good an Instrument to be seene, or sound before so bad an Idoll. But I grow tedious; yet ere I part, pray give me leave to say to you as once St. Peter said unto the Cripple which sat at the Temple of the gate called Beautifull, Silver and Gold, saies Peter have I none: so may I really affirme to you; No Golden lines, nor Silver straines have I, to linke your candid, wise, and solid judgement to my most weake and imbecill harsh Quill; but such as 'tis, you are welcome to, as was the Dove into the Arke of Noah.
Now, the King of Jacob blesse you, and grant when Sodome is on fire you still may have a
 Zoar to fly to; when Egypt is encumbred sore with famine, a Joseph still to be your faithfull friend; when Saul, or persecution doth assaile you, a Jonathan or Paul still neere to help you; and when commotions and strange opinions of the true Religion shall even shake the World, that then, even then, you still may have a Synagogue of our sweet Saviours for your Sanctuary:
So prayeth, and ever shall
