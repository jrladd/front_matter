WHEN I HAD TVRNED into English this vvorke, I cōsidered in my selfe, that in aunciente time and also in this our age, men haue accustomed to dedicate their trauayles vnto such vertuous perso∣nages as they haue honored. And I exami∣ning my selfe, vnto vvhome I moughte addresse this little labour of mine, thought good to presume vppon your goodnesse, and to addresse the same vnto your hono∣rable Ladyship knovving this vvorke to be a meet subiect for the exercise of noble spirits, in the which they may see the great mercies of God tovvards mankinde, and learne hovv to be thankfull for the same tovvards his diuine maiestie: It may please you therefore (good Madame) to accepte
 this present, at the hand of him, vvho vvi∣sheth vnto you great encrease of spirituall blessings, and that after this momentayne life, you may be one of those vvhich shall euer vvayte on the Lambe in the heauen∣ly Ierusalem, vvhich vvas slayne for the sinnes of man before the foundation of the world was layde, to the end he mought make vs acceptable vnto God, by vvhome vve haue redemption thorough his bloud (euen) the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, according to the riches of his grace.
