it was none of my Duty to dispute that, so whom of right does it belong to, but to your Lordship and your Brethren, who were pleased to joyn their Commands with yours.
The Peace of Jerusalem is the important Subject; and what way so proper to secure that, and prevent the Nations Ruin, as Prayer to the Almighty, who alone can preserve us, Ʋnion in his Worship, the better to prevail with him, and such a Spirit running thro' the whole Body Politick, as actuates the Prayer and promotes the Ʋnion.
My Lord!
It is Matter of Joy to all good Men to find Persons of your Autho∣rity and Example entirely of these Sentiments. 'Tis a promising Presage of Good to the City, and of Welfare
 to our Country, when the Chief Rulers themselves do at once pray for the Peace of Jerusalem, and without regard to any Party, wish all may prosper that love it, when they scorn to be so far misguided, as to act the Business of a Faction, or suffer any private Interests to mislead their Af∣fections from the Common Good, when in a word, they wish for and endeavour an Ʋniversal Ʋnion in Religion, and in the mean time act as if there were one. For as this shews the Publick Spirit in all the parts of it, so where this governs in the Magistrates, even tho' the Nation be ripe for Vengeance, yet for their sakes Heaven it self shall with-hold the Stroak, and shower down Blessings on the Publick.
That our Destruction may be averted, and Peace be still in our Jerusalem,
 the Almighty continue a Succession of such Magistrates in that Chair which your Lordship so honourably fills. This is the most Affectionate Prayer of,
My Lord!
