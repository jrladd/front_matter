LEa and Rachel, (most Noble
Queene) left and forsooke
their Countrey Mesopotamia,
to come to Israell, to bee the
mother of the twelue Tribes
of Israell▪ Ruth the Moabite,
came from Moab to Iudah, to
be the mother of many great
and godly Kings in Iudah. Your Maiestie descen∣ding
from many Kings and Princes, came from Den∣marke
to Scotland, from Scotland to England, to be the
mother of many Kings and Princes, in great Britane.
Thus wee are bound to the prouidence of God,
by whom Kings do raigne, and Kingdomes are sup∣ported,
and that by Gods good and gracious means
in women, as by Thermus Pharoes daughter to saue
Moses in Nylus; to bring the Children of Israell out
of Egipt, by King Tharbus daughter of Ethiop; to yeild
the Citie Saba, and thereby the victorie to the He∣brew
Armie; thus heathen women by God are ap∣pointed
to serue Israell at neede.
How much more is Esher famous for her great vi∣ctory
ouer the Persians. Iudith by cutting off Holofer∣nus
head was in Bethulia both for euer famous: noble
stratagems of women. But your Maiestie by putting

your Highnes helping hand to pare their feet lesser,
their eares shorter, their eyes out, and their mon∣strous
heads off, that can come and goe, that can see
and heare from Rome, from Rhemes, from Spaine to
Great Britaine, such victories shold haue double try∣umphes,
the one in earth, the other in heauen.
Whē Rachels Image was buried by Sychē, Israel be∣gan
to flourish; then Debora a woman within a while
after became a Iudge in Israel for 40 yeres in mount
Ephraim: when Maachas idoll Priapus, was buried and
ashes throwne to Caedron, then Iudah prospered, and
Hulda a woman dwelling in Hierusalem, to whome
Iosias sent to know how to serue the Lord, and to be
instructed by a woman, to purifie Iudah from Images
and Idols.
God raised wise, godly▪ and vertuous women in all
countreys to feare him, & to feed his seruants; a wo∣man
in Sarepta to feed Elias, a Sanamite woman to
lodge Elizeus, to a woman of Samaria Christ asked
drinke, & confessed himselfe to be the Messias.
Since Christ was so conuersant with womē, that to
women Christ spake his last speach before his death,
& after his death he first appeared to women, I wish
some women should haue Christ in their hearts in
Great Britane, as Anna had in her armes in Hieru∣salem,
to pray to him and not to Saints, to worship
Christ in the Church, and not Idols and Images in
Closets and Galleries: then did Iudah prosper, then
did Israell florish, and then shall Great Britane bee
happie.
