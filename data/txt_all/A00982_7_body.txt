TO make those Worthies liue againe.
Which long agoe were lapt in Lead,
Is worthy praise for taken paine,
To him that raiseth from the dead
Such Princes as in time possest
The Regal Scepter, Crowne and Globe,
And in their Tumbs haue taken rest,
That once did weare a kingly Robe,
Now to appeare on princely Stage,
And to resigne a princely power,
Vnto a Prince whose tender age
IEHOVA blesse, and grant each hower
Him to attend the royall hest,
And follow after true renowne.
He then from heauen shall be blest,
Nor dare proud Fortune euer frowne
On him that vertuously doth liue,
To whom eight HENRIES honour giue.
