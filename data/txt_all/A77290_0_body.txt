Honourable:
AS David and the Apostles before me said, We believe, and therefore speak, so I believing the truth of the Scrip∣tures, did presume to write you of many things strange before, but now evident since accomplished: I am once more bold to write you from the Gospel of things shortly to be fulfilled, which will seem strange, but will prove most true in its time, however, mine enemies are stirred up to hate and oppresse me for it, the day will come they will be ashamed at it. Sir, I hope, I have deserved no other but your love, wherewith you have loved me, and the love of those love God in the Country, and those hate me doe it without a cause, even for my standing for, and witnessing to the truth of the Gospel, with which I am intrusted, which should occasion their love, were they of God, and not hate, to the defence whereof you are called, and blessed shall you be if you contend for it, and consent not to the detain∣ing of the discovery thereof, which the Lord preserve you from, and keepe you to immortality and life, and set you with Christ in his sight, to the full enjoyment of himselfe for ever.

Aprill 1, 1649.
