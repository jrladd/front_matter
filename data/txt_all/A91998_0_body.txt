SIR,
IT is a fault sometimes in good men, when they write to great men, to be too large in their praises, farre beyond their deserts; but Jobs rule shall be my guide, not to give flattering titles un∣to man. Your Father, Sir Rowland Lytton, being long dead, yet speaketh, there being in St. Hieromes phrase, concerning Asella, Sermo silens, and Si∣lentium loquens; a silent speech, and a speaking silence: his workes of love to God, godlinesse, and good men, speake aloud in the eares of his Country, his name be∣ing very precious among them; Your selfe to my know∣ledge did expresse your love to God and your Coun∣try, and that in the hardest times, to the hazarding of your owne Liberty, and Fortunes, if not more: And all this while you have, with that Honourable Court,
borne the burthen and heate of the day: yet they and you are not without some that are ready to murmure a∣gainst you; It puts me in minde of Africanus Superior, who as Valer. Maxim. lib. 5. cap. 3. reports, made the City of Rome, (being in a Consumption, and ready to give up the Ghost) Lady of Afrique; but see his requitall: Afterwards, being Banished into a poore Country Towne, his will was, that his Tombe should have this Inscription upon it; Ingrata Patria ne ossa quidem mea, unthankefull Country, thou hast not so much as my bones. I know You have had a tender care, with others, to recover Englands consumption. And while with labouring for your Countries good, you bring your selfe to the
Cineres ei suos negavit, quam in Cine∣res Collabi pastus non fue∣rat, Valer. ibid. dust, I desire you may not (through the mis∣apprehension of some, and indiscretion of others) have cause to cry out, Ingrata Patria! O unthankefull Coun∣try! God still make you constant to him, loyall to your Prince, loving to your Country. Thus asking pardon for my boldnesse, and Patronage for these poore lines, I shall alwayes rest,

E Musaeo, Septemb. 25. 1643.
