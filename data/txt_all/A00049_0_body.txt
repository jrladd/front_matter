TO whom should I these pleasing paines commend,
My Muse hath ane Frugality to trade?
But to the Muses deare and noble friend,
Who, as in Honour, seekes to thriue in Grace:
Who, truly nobe, honoureth his Place;
Nor fr his Place is onely honoured:
Whom should the Muses more desire to grace,
Then whom they haue vp in their Bosomes bred,
And who with bountous gifts them ath reguerdoned?


Such Bounty is true Thrift: Thus thou dost lay
Thy treasure vp in heau'n; thus thou dost gaine:
By giuing of some fading goods away,
True honour, which for euer shall remaine:
If thou wilt pleased be to entertaine
Thrift and her traine, into thy Patronage,
I boldly dare in her behalfe maintaine,
Shee is faire, bounteous, sober, graue and sage,
And fit to counsell thee, in Youth, in Strength, and Age.



Next, Prouidence shall guide thee and ,
In all wherein  hand is diligent,
And holy Care and Labour shall direct
Thy Counsels to a iust and good ,
To hau'n of Rest, to harbour of Content:
And if thou please to reade Deaths Meditation,
Thou shalt perceiue her as an Herald sent,
To summon thee to heau'nly habitation,
To blessed Bride and Bridegroomes marriage-consummation:


Most happy end of all, that rightly runne
Their courses in the dayes of vanity!
With Wisedomes study Solomon begun,
But ends all with this Epithalamic:
Sweet Swan-like Farewell of Mortality!
Taste of true Ioy which euer shall remaine!
Then know, it is thy highest Dignitie,
This Earnest sure, of heau'n on earth, to gaine;
Which I will pray for, Thou must labour to attayne.
