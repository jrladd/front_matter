THou art gone vp on high, thou hast lead captiuitie captiue, thou hast receiued gifts for men; yea for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them.
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and will glorifie thy name for euermore.
For great is thy mercy towards me, and thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest hell.
Let the speaking of my mouth, the writing of mine hand, and the thinking of mine heart, be pleasing in thy sight, O Lord my strength, and my Redeemer.
Amen. Amen.
