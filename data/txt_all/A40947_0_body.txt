SIR,
I Might not without Reason suspect
your Resentment and Admirati∣on,
when you behold so trivial
and mean a Work of this Nature,
confidently sheltring it self un∣der
the Infallible defence of your worthy Name,
from the piercing storms that are frequently rais'd
by the heat of certain creatures called Criticks:
But, Sir, that sweetness and everness of your
Temper, which all who know you, do with great
satisfaction take notice of, has denyed me to fear
the danger of displeasing a Person whom nothing
but very Baseness can make Angry. To that
Goodness therefore, I presume to offer up these

Fruits of so little worth, they wanted; a good Sea∣son
to grow to any Perfection in, as having but
seldom any Sun-shine weather, unless when your
Influences did actuate their Principles; if any
then amongst them have arrived to more Beauty
and Ripeness than their Fellows, they owe it im∣mediately
to that Warmth and Vigour they
received from you; and in this respect, Sir, you
may claim them as your own; for the Sun may be
said to have more right to the Fruit he gave co∣lour
to, than the Tree that bore it. Vouchsafe,
Sir, then, when you unbend from your more
weighty and useful Employs of Time, to cast a fa∣vourable
Eye upon this Poetick Off-spring, that
foresees a happy Life if he may be admitted in∣to
your Service, where if he can please in his Mi∣nority,
he promises himself such an increase of
Spirit and Fancy, that he will aspire to more
lofty thoughts, even Sir, to the Ambition of be∣ing
worthy to stile you the sweet Maecenas
SIR,
