Grace here, glory for euer in Christ.
LOuing, & beloued frend. The title of this heauenly hymne shevveth the excellency thereof. For it is called the song of songs, or the Canticles of vvise Soloman. The subiecte is most sacred, for it is the uptiall loue song betvveene Christ, & his spouse. Wherein their mutuall loues by svveete resēblāces

are mystically, & maruelously ex∣pressed What more comfortable song then to sing our harts loue vve beare to Christ in the blessed vnion by one spirit vvherby vve haue euerlasting life. Tvvo of the first chapters of vvhich song I haue metaphrased into Monosyllables, vvhich I haue bequethed to your loue as a signe of mine, & to seale both ours. Receaue it as the rest of your colleagues, for I vvish you all the happines of both vvorlds in the sauing mercies of Christ t vvhich I recommend you, & a that looke vpon you vvith loue resting.
