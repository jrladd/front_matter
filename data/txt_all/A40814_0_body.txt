SIR,
THe Design of this Book, humbly

laid at YOUR MAJE∣STY's Feet, is to give some Account of an Island, which, tho' sub∣ject to Your Royal Predecessors upwards of Six hundred years, and seated in the Channel, is less known than some other of YOUR MAJESTY's Dominions and Islands, that are latter Acquisi∣tions, and remov'd to a greater Distance. The Knowledge of Us may

be of some Use to YOUR MAJESTY's Service, and may mi∣nister to some of those Great Ends of Provi∣dence for which God has rais'd You up, and which are one day to be wrought by Your Means.
Ever since our Anci∣ent DUKES exchang'd their Coronet for that Imperial Crown which YOUR MAJESTY

now wears, we have been noted for Our Fi∣delity to Our KINGS. We Glory not in the Extent or Riches of Our Country, which can∣not be brought into Parallel with the mean∣est of those Provinces that constitute Your Great Empire; but we Glory in Our Loyalty, which we have kept unblemish'd to this Day.
What profound Ve∣neration then must we now have for a Match∣less Pair of Incompa∣rable Princes whom God has given to these Nations in his Love?
That Heaven would preserve YOUR MA∣JESTY from the ma∣ny Dangers to which You daily expose Your Sacred Person, and crown with Success the Justice of Your Arms,

is the hearty Prayer of,
May it please YOUR MAJESTY,
