Madam,
IT is purely in compliance with your Ladiship's repeated Request (which I could neither in Gra∣titude, Civility, or good Nature, refuse) that I publish this Sermon: and therefore, though I cannot deny but the defects of it are mine; yet I must crave leave to tell your Ladiship, that I think those much more excuseable than the Publication of it: and for that I am not answerable, unless it be a fault to gratify the most kind and obliging.
In the Composure of it, I happen'd, I know not how, to be so affected with the Argument, that my thoughts ran out to a much greater length than I intended: In∣so much, that when I preach'd it, for fear of presuming too much upon the patience of the Auditory, I was for∣ced to omit a great deal of what I here publish, not doubting, but that many, who had not then leisure enough to hear it, might, one time or other, find lei∣sure enough to read it. For, how defective soever the Composure may be, I am sure the Argument is such, as richly deserves our most serious Thoughts and Con∣sideration.

Such as it is, Madam, I humbly present it to your Ladiship, who, I must needs own, have the most equitable Claim to it, as being the nearest concerned in the sorrowful occasion of it. And that it may prove worth your Claiming, by being in some measure con∣tributary to the increase of your Piety and Vertue, and to the support of your dejected Spirit, under the dear Lost you are lamenting, and of which (Pardon me, Madam, if I tell you) you have been, and I fear are, still too tenderly sensible; is the hearty Prayer of,
Madam,
