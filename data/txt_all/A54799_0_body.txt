MADAM,
WHEN I Consider the mean∣ness of this Offering, that comes to Prostrate it self before your Feet, and Consider your Greatness, born with Goodness, Pure, and White, as the Lilly of the Valley; it makes me blush at my own Ambition. Your Excellencies fill the whole World with Admiration, and your Virtues are as Beauteous as the Purple of Kings, as the Roy∣al Purple, which we see Distended like a Mantle, all about the Resplendent Stars that Ennamel, and Guild, the, Spacious Sky, more Beauteous than Prosperity, that is
Embroydered with Jewels by the Fingers of Fortune. These have Darts so Sharp, and Flaming, that like the Stone Ceraunia, they Dazle all Eyes; They are Mountains of Per∣fume, they are Suns, that are wholly Radiant, that bring Light, and Life, and imprint Perfections more Curious than Figures, more Curious than the Colours of the Rainbow; and are all as Natural, as Flight to Birds, or Beauty, to Flowers. He that would equal this Worth, should, he draw from Minerals the Riches that the Earth hideth in its Veins, would rather find Insufficiency in his Purpose, than want of Merit in his Subject.
Then who is he that can Enchase your Fame?
Behind your Glories we must lag with Shame,
As if the Numerous-Feet of Verse were Lame.
Thus do you seem to be form'd by Hands of Angels, unfit therefore to be display'd by the unable Pencil of
Madam,
