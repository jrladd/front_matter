MADAM,
THere appeared of late at White-hall a Philistin in black, defying the Armies of the living God. His strength was in his Tongue, not in his Arme: His weapons, Breath, and his combat, an houres Boast. Yet as to his own conceit, a huge Goliah: he blew down Mount Sion at a puffe, and split in pieces the Rock, against which the Gates of Hell shall never prevaile. In that conjuncture, because no adversary could securely be seen, the applause flew high, victory and triumph rebounding from all the hills of great Britany. Yet, God knowes, all was but wind. Flaverunt venti. The windes blew: Sion stands still immoveable, and the Rock unshaken. The blasts vanisht to nothing at the first jossle against the House

of God, because it was founded upon a Rock. This hath lately been demonstra∣ted by the excellent Pen of S. C. clearly evincing the no lesse ancient, then un∣changeable truths of our Doctrines. But indeed there needed no such Gyant to de∣feat that Goliah: the least of Iesse's Family, the Church, supported by the power of his Cause, may hope for successe in such a Duell. Upon which account I was encou∣raged to trace out another way of answer, tending to disable his proofs, by stripping his arguments, and shewing them in cuerpo. Now the Doctor's Sermon having been both Preached and published under a Royall shadow, I come with an humble suit, prostrate at your Majesties feet, that I may shelter this Answer under your graci∣ous protection: whose name, as it is most renowned in the Christian world, for zeal of Religion, so upon your Royall assent, 'twill render all-secure the Author of this slender work,
Madam,
 June 1. 1663.
