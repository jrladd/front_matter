I Have often wondered that the Cruelties as
well as Villanies of the Romish Church have
not long ere this provoked Almighty God to
avenge upon her all the Blood of his Saints, which
she hath every where as so much Water, spilt up∣on
the face of the whole Earth; but reflecting upon
the many Sins of Gods own people (which certain∣ly
have been the only cause of the withholding of
his most just and expected Judgments from being
poured forth upon her from the fullest Vials of his
Wrath) I have again considered of the Justice as
well as Goodness of God herein; Justice to be re∣vealed
from Heaven upon her, when the Fulness
of her Abominations shall be accomplished; and
his Goodness and Mercy to his People, in purging
them by these his Chastisements from the Dross
and Tin of their Iniquities. Here we have a Re∣velation
of the great God in two of his greatest and
most glorious Attributes, his Mercy and his Judg∣ment,
according to their respective Objects. The
Holy King and Prophet David wondred no less
than he grieved at this matter, till he went into the
Sanctuary of God, where he understood the End of
wicked men, and that verily there is a Reward for
the Righteous, and a God that Judgeth in the Earth.

With what Antichristian, no less than Inhumane
Cruelty she hath behaved her self towards the Saints
and Servants of God,, whom she calls Hereticks,
this small History will sufficiently acquaint Your
Grace, and will, I hope, prove a sufficient Alarm
to the Nation, to rowse her up as one Man, to pre∣vent
and hinder the Rooting or Springing of her
vile Superstitions here for the time to come. No,
Sir, the People of England are doubtless sufficient∣ly
cautioned and fortified against any such At∣tempt;
however it may not perhaps be unseasona∣ble
to remind them, and fully set before them the
barbarous Cruelties & unchristian Severities where∣with
the Holy Inquisition (for so they falsly stile it)
is to the shame and sorrow of the best amongst
them in Foreign Countreys, where it is suffered in
the highest pitch of Rigor to be managed; no, we
hope so great is the Goodness of God both towards
our Prince and People, that 'tis past not only the
strength, but Malice of our Romish Adversaries to
hurt either his Sacred Person or the Government.
May the Good Will of him that dwelt in the Bush
preserve and ever keep Your Grace from any of
their wicked Attempts upon Your Excellencies
Person, from dividing you from Your Princes Fa∣vour;
or, which can never be, Our most Sacred
and ever Dread Soveraign from His good Subjects
and People; and let all true-hearted Englishmen say
Amen.
