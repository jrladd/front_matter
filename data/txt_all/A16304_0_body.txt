GOOD Madam, the manifolde courtesies, and exceeding great fa∣uours, which not onely mine elder brother, but also mine owne poore selfe, haue receiued and founde at Chilworth, is the occasion and cause we are so much bound and beholding vnto you: In signe whereof, I shall desire you to accept this small testimonie of my duetious good will, towardes your worthie Howse, vntill better satisfaction shall follow to make some amendes for the same: It is a Nouell Matter, & therefore I send it vnto you as a New-yeers gift these Hollidayes, resembling herein the fashion of some cunning Drapers, who when they would vtter a

badde piece of doth, carrie the same vnto the falsest & darkest window they haue, thereby to make the badde colour shew thee better: So I, desirous that this my simple Translation might passe the safer, haue sent it vnto you these short dayes in Christmas, that reading the same by candle light, you may the lesse perceiue the faults thereof: yet howsoeuer it is, I doubt not but your Ladiship will accept fauourably of it, and at some idle houre or other, reade it ouer. And thus (good Madam) crauing pardon for my boldenesse, and fauour for such faultes as may be committed in the same, I wish vnto you, all such happie contentment, as eyther your wor∣thie selfedoth desire, or your vertuous Thoughtes any way deserue: and so I humbly take my leaue.
