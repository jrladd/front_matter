Madam,
THIS little piece of the growth of Spain, was plea∣sing to me in the reading it; and having too much leasure now, I took the pains to make it speak En∣glish; and when I had done it, I had an inspired thought (on some previous Discourses of your Noble Family, and particularly of your self) to present it to you; supposing as it could add little to your better diversions; yet at least it could take little from them;

besides I had Presidents from others, who have done some∣thing of like nature, Dedica∣ted to Persons of Quality to manifest their respects and ser∣vice to them. Thus encou∣raged in this attempt by such examples, I durst publickly prefix your Ladiship, for such a Patroness so Honourable by Descent, and so fam'd for In∣genuity: For you Madam, to the invincible Courage and Conduct of your Heroick An∣cestors (some whereof worthi∣ly knew how to make an Alli∣ance between the Laurel and Olive, as a living Branch of their Illustrious Stem) have added to their Renown, that

Sweetness, Beauty and Inge∣nuity, which eminently have influenced all who have had the honour to be well-acquaint∣ed with you, to esteem and re∣view you for them. That sin∣gular Virtue you are Mistriss of, obliges me among others to pay you this Homage, which I humbly supplicate you would vouchsafe to accept, as coming from a person that loves and honours you with all his heart; desiring that you would par∣don my confidence in this Ad∣dress, which sprang from the observation I have made and heard of your Goodness and excellent Merits; at least that you would be pleas'd to

connive at my boldness to De∣dicate this Trifle to kiss your hands; thereby imitating that Roman Emperor's meekness, who dain'd to accept of a Cup of Water from a poor Woman that in humility presented it: I am loth to tire you with rea∣ding of my zeal to serve you; (for I have not Rhetoric enough to express your Praises) and therefore I hasten to tell you, that I remain with a particu∣lar reverence, as being one who counts it his highest ho∣nour to publish himself.
Madam,
