BEloued in Iesus Christ, my first fruites, I haue nothing but this myte to leaue with you, which is the summe of al my sermons, ye haue heard it alrea∣dy, & as th'apostle cals the Corinthi∣ans his epistle, so ye should be my ser∣mon;2, Cor.  that is, my sermon should be prin∣ted in your hearts, as this is printed in paper. If ye haue not giuen your hrs yet to him which sent for them, nowe thinke that god hath sent for them a∣gaine, and heare me writing, whom ye cannot heare speaking. Take not cu∣stome for religion shun occasion aswel as sinne sek the vse of euery thing, de¦sire not to haue your Kingdome here.

And so I leaue you all with Christ, whom I haue preached, to bring forth the fruit of that seede which is sowen, beseeching you for al the loue that you haue of heuen, that ye would not count any thing in this world worthy to keep your harts from God, but think of the day when you shal giue account of eue¦ry lesson which ye haue heard, and hee which hath called you in this prison, wil glorifie you in his pallace, where ye shall see him to whom yee haue geuen your hearts, and enioy that blessing of blessings, which makes all the worlde to worship him. The father of our lord Iesus Christ, which hath begunne to draw you to his Kingdom, neuer leaue you vntil you come vnto it, Amen.
