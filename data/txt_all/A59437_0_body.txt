My Lord,
THE Favour which your Lordship was
pleased to shew to this Play, I value
more than all the loud Applauses of a Theater:
Nor can it be less esteemed by any man that has
had the honour of knowing your Lordships
Person, or the pleasure of reading the diver∣sions
of your pen. It seems by your obliging
kindness to the Poets, and your great example
in writing, as if you were design'd by Heaven,
among many other great uses, for the sustain∣ing
of declining Poetry. This consideration,
with the boldness which your frequent favours

have given me, pull the trouble of this Dedi∣cation
upon you. You see, my Lord, the dan∣ger
of encouraging any of us, who are too apt
without it to use the names of great men for the
defence of our weaknesses and follies; nay, some
are so arrogant to believe their injurious Dedi∣cations
competent returns for all the Obligati∣ons
they receive from the generosity of their
Patrons. But I, my Lord, have been too much
obliged by you to think of making any return:
all that I can do, is to beg leave to make an hum∣ble
acknowledgment of all your favours; and to
take this occasion to publish my self to the
World,
My Lord,
