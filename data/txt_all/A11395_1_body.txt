Henricus Stuartus.
Hic strenuus ratus.

THE TROPHEIS, & MAGNIFICENCE.

THe gratious Welcome You vouchsaf't yer-while
To my grave PIBRAC (though but meanly clad)
Makes BARTAS (now, no Stranger in this Isle)
More bold to come (though suted even as clad)
To kiss Your HIGHNES Hand; and, with Your Smile,
To Crown His Haps, and Our faint Hopes to glad
(Whose weary longings languish in our Stile:
For, in our Wants, our very Songs be sad).
Hee brings, for Present to so great a PRINCE,
A Princely GLASSE, made first for SALOMON:
The fitter therfore for your EXCELLENCE
As oft to look-in, as You look vpon.
Som Glasses flatter: other-som deform:
This, ay, presents You a true PRINCE'S Form.
