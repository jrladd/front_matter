Madam,
THough I have put the ensuing Trea∣tise into English, yet it speaks still a Langu¦age few understand, and therefore wants so powerful a Patroness as your Ma∣jesty; who both Understands it, and can Vindicate it from
those Censures that may be cast upon it, by such as do not. Wherefore vouchsafe to give me leave to publish it under Your Majesties Gra∣cious Patronage; and to take this opportunity of giv∣ing our Nation an Idea of the Devotions Your Majesty exercises in Your frequent Retirements, which many Admire, but few Imitate: Falsly judging that Prayer and Conversation with God is a tedious and irksome Imployment, whilst a Pious Soul finds the contrary, and Experiences it to be the on∣ly
true Comfort upon Earth, and a Foretast and Pledge of that everlasting Happi∣ness it hopes for in Heaven. Other seeming Comforts may allure our Hearts to a search after them, but when with much labour they are obtain'd, they manifest then emptiness and their inability to give the content they Promised, leaving the Soul in a more languishing and sad condition than they found it, and only satisfy∣ing it of this Truth, that God created our Heart for the enjoyment of himself,
and that nothing less than Him can satisfy it. Vouch∣safe; Madam, to pardon my Confidence, in present∣ing a bare Translation of so small a Treatise to so great a Person. The Widdows Mite was not unacceptable to the King of Heaven, be∣cause it was all she had, and because she gave it with a very good will, which is the most valuable thing in all Presents; and I can assure Your Majesty, that both these Reasons do plead for this little Offering. Your Ma∣jesties acceptance will, I hope,
persuade the World to turn over these few Leafes; and if your Example likewise can prevail with them, to practise what they Read, I question not but they will soon cease to wonder that Your Majesty so often leaves the Entertainments of the Court, for the Solitude of Your Closet; when they per∣ceive that the greatest Hon∣ours, Riches, and Pleasures of the Earth, are (what the wisest of Men stiled them) meer Vanities; nay, even Vexations, in respect of those Substantial and Satisfactory
Delights, which are enjoy'd by Conversing with God. Which indeed are such, that none but those who with Your Majesty have Experienc'd them, are able to conceive them. That Your Majesty may pro∣ceed in Your pious Exercises, till at length you come to re∣ceive the Reward of them in an everlasting Joy, is the constant Prayer of
Madam,
