May it please your Grace,
THAT I take the liberty to Prefix so Great a Name to so small a Treatise, only the
 Dignity of the Sub∣ject, indeed makes some Compensation for the defects and meanness of the Pre∣sent, for the Argu∣ment is Truly Great and Noble in it self, and what would de∣serve a much abler Pen, more leisure for Abstractions, a more Philosophical Genius, and both a
 wider compass, and a closser collecti∣on of Thought, than any I can pretend to. Thus much however may be said, that a sense of that Edification, which ought always to be the cheif aim and Design of the Pulpit, which first gave Birth to this Discourse, obliged
 me to write as fami∣liarly and Practi∣cally as the Subject would well admit of. Such as it is, My Lord, my Relation to the Church of York, the Just e∣steem one has for the Concurrence of so many excellent qua∣lifications in one Person, and my particular obligati∣ons
 to your Grace makes this publick Acknowledgment of them a Just Debt from,
My Lord,
