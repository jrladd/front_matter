SIR,
SIth Heauen, and Earth, your Blood and your Uertue haue made you a most Illustrious and Exqui∣site Prince; and sith your Highnasse Court is a true





and conspicuous Academie of Generositie and Honour; I therefore conceiued, that this French Courtier was oblieged to tender you his homage in English, and to proffer vp his best seruice to the Dignitie of your resplendant and Princely Vertues. And as Presidents are still the best and powerfulst Precepts, aswell to instruct the accutest wits, as to pollish and refine the finest Natures and Iudgements: so those of my Sa∣cred Soueraigne, your liuing Father, and of that most ex∣cellent Prince, your dead (yet

euerliuing) Brothers haue made your Highnesse an inimmita∣ble Patterne and Paragon of all Court perfections.
Yet notwithstanding, when your more serious studies and generous exercises will permit you to descend so low, as to per∣use this Courtier (which say∣ling from France, is now arri∣ued in England)▪ J hope hee will deserue, and consequentlie obtaine this testimonie from your Highnesse, that his Ambi∣tion hath no other end, nor hee any other Ambition then to shew what Courtiers are, what

they should bee, and not how Great, but how Good they are bund to make themselues in their conduction, both to their Prince and Countrie, to the end that they may prooue as happie, and as Illustrious Or∣naments to their Dignities, as their Dignities are to them. And although I cannot rightly define, whether Ambition were more predominant, or Zeale preualent with me, in daring permit this poore and vnworthy Translation of mine to soare so high, as to your Highnesse pro∣tection and Patronage; yet

sith my Author was both Noble, Learned and Honest, whose fidelitie and fame hath crownd both himselfe and his Workes, I (out of the rich trea∣sure of your Goodnesse, which sweetly shines to the world, as∣well in your lookes as actions) flatter my selfe with this hope, that your Highnes will vouch∣safe to shelter him from the scandall of the Enuious, and to protect him from the Enuie of the scandalous.
Goe on Illustrious and Ge∣nerous SIR, in your Heroi∣call progression of Uertue and

Honour (wherewith both Arts and Armes ambitiously con∣tend to Embellish and adorne you) that as we are now truely happie in Royall IAMES your Father; so we futurely may bee as truly blessed in Princely CHARLES his Sonne, that your Sword and Launce se∣conding his Pen, and your Laurels growing vp with his Palmes and Oliues, may still make the Church and Estate of these famous Kingdomes of great Brittaine and Ireland, alwaies Triumphant, alwaies Uictorious, against the malice

of Rome, or the power of Hell, which shall dare seeke, either to ecclipse the triumphes of their glory, or to assault (much lesse remoue) the Trophes of their glorious and flourishing pro∣speritie.
