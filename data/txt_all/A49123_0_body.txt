IT was prophesied of our Savi∣our,
that the Government should
be upon his shoulders, Is. 9. 6. and
though he have devolved that bur∣den
upon mortal men, which is
Angelicis humeris formidandum, yet
doth he , put un∣der
his shoulder and help them to
bear it, or they would soon sink

under it. For however it fares
with the Church, whether it be un∣der
persecution, none are so much
exposed to a fiery trial as they; or
whether it enjoy peace and plenty.
Pride and contention swels up some
corrupt members to the daily vex∣ation
of their Heads & Governors.
And how blameless soever their
Persons be, their Office is made a
Crime.
Better things might have been
expected from the Author of the
Treatise hereafter considered,
wherein there is so much contempt
poured out upon the Episcopal Of∣fice,
and on all Church authority
and administrations, that the Ink
is not more black than the Calum∣ny.
But where should the impetus
of discontent and faction vent it
self, but against those rocks that are
set by God Himself to give check
and bounds unto it?

Now that in the Apostles days
this sacred Order was appointed
(among other great ends) as a re∣medy
against Schism, is acknow∣ledged
by such as are its reputed
Adversaries: In the Church of
Alexandria from the time of St.
Mark the Evangelist they were
continued as a bulwork against
Schism, saith St. Hierom in his E∣pistle
to Evagrius. And in the
Church of Corinth, when Men be∣gun
to say, I am of Paul and I of A∣pollo,
this Office was appointed,
that the seeds of Schism might be
taken away, saith the same Father
on the first Chap. to Titus. And
he tells the Luciferians in a Dialogue
with them, That unless an emi∣nent
and uninterrupted power be
by all given to the chief Pastors,
there will be as many schisms as
there are Priests. In all this St.

Hierom followeth the more ancient
Fathers—Passibus aequis, for Ignatius
advised the Trallians to do nothing
without their Bishop. Which ad∣vice
he repeating again, tells them:
It is not my word, but the Word
of God; and if ye suspect me to
say this, as understanding that
there are Divisions among you, he
is my witness for whom I am in
bonds, that it was not man, but the
Spirit that declared this to me.
St. Clemens in his Epistle to the Co∣rinth.
p. 57. says, That the Apo∣stles
foreseeing that Divisions
would arise as Christ had foretold,
did establish Bishops. And the
32. Canon of the Apostles ordain∣ed,
That if any Presbyter or Dea∣con
should make conventions with∣out
his Bishop, he should be de∣posed.
In the 4th. Oecumeni∣cal
Council of Calcedon consisting

of 630. Fathers, there was read
an Ancient Canon of the Council
of Antioch to this effect: If any
Presbyter or Deacon contemning
his Bishop shall separate and erect
another Altar, and will not obey
the Bishop, calling him home
once and again, we do utterly
condemn such a one. Which
Canon being read by Aetius an
Arch-Deacon, the Fathers with
one consent proclaimed This is a
righteous Canon of the Holy Fa∣thers.
In the Second Council of
Carthage by the Eighth Canon it
was provided, That if any Pres∣byter
lifted up with pride should
make a Schism against his Bishop,
let him be accursed. But in de∣fiance
of all these Canons and cur∣ses
they have been accounted the
only blessed Men in our times,
who have most vehemently decry∣ed

this holy Order, and success∣fully
maintained a Faction against
them. To whom, if they are yet
capable of any Counsel, I would
commend the moderation of Mr.
Calvin, who speaking of Popish
Bishops, Instit. l. 4. c. 10. S. 6.
saith, If they were true Bishops,
I would yield them though not
so much authority as they do re∣quire,
yet as much as is requisite
for the well-ordering of Ecclesi∣astical
Government. And what
he means by true Bishops he ex∣plaineth,
S. 1. The form of the
Ancient Church sets before our
eyes a pattern of the Divine insti∣tution
for the order of governing
his Church. For though the Bi∣shops
of those times did set forth
many Canons, in which they
seemed to express more than was
expressed in the Holy Scripture;

yet they composed their whole
Oeconomy with such caution, ac∣cording
to that only rule of God's
Word, that you may easily per∣ceive
that they held nothing in
this respect differing from the
Word of God. And in S. 4.
he repeats the same: Si rem intu∣emur,
reperiemus veteres Episcopos non
alium regendae Ecclesiae formam voluisse
fingere ab eâ quam Deus verbo suo
praescripsit. With how much truth
and reverence doth this Learned
man speak of those ancient Bi∣shops,
of whom he says not only
that they did not actually swerve
from God's Word as to their
Government, but that they would
not. This Candor is much want∣ing
in such as pretend to be Mr.
Calvin's Disciples, with whom
this Sacred Function and all its
Administrations are defamed as

Antichristian and Popish, and a
Covenant for extirpating them
root and branch is still pertinaci∣ously
adhered to. But though the
authority of these men be despi∣sed,
yet methinks that of our Sa∣viour
who hath made them his
Ambassadors, (and Apostolus cujus∣que
is est quisque) and hath told us,
Luke 10. 16. He that heareth you,
heareth me; he that despiseth you, de∣spiseth
me, and he that despiseth me
despiseth him that sent me] should
not be rejected, nor those severe
penalties under which he exacts
our obedience to his Officers be
slighted. For whoever will not
hear the Church, is to be accounted
as a Heathen or Publican: and Mark
6. 11. Whosoever shall not receive you
nor hear you—It shall be more tolerable
for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of
Judgment than for them. And

though wicked men do securely
despise the censures of the Church,
yet hath Christ said, Matth. 18. 18.
of his Officers, Whatsoever ye shall
bind on Earth shall be bound in Hea∣ven;
which authority the Church
of God would not have exerci∣sed
in the purest and most primi∣tive
times by so many and dread∣ful
Anathema's, if their great Lord
had not authorized them, or if
they had not experienced the good
effects of them. Did the Apo∣stle
in vain derive a power to the
Church of Corinth, 1 Epist ch. 5.
v. 5. In the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ to deliver such a one (as the
Incestuous person) unto Satan for
the destruction of the flesh, that the
spirit may be saved in the day of our
Lord Jesus? Or can we think the
Records of the several Churches
in those first Ages, which relate

the divers painful and languishing
Distempers of Body, as well as
the anguish and trouble of Mind,
which seized on such as by the
Censures of the Church were cast
out of Christian communion into
the power of Satan, to be false
or forged? The Divine Judg∣ments
which pursue such as in our
times have been deservedly eject∣ed,
or do wilfully depart from the
Church-communion, who are for
the most part given up to a re∣probate
sense, and being possessed
with a spirit of Giddiness and per∣versness
do as Cain run up and
down from the Presence of God
in his Publick Worship, like Va∣gabonds
from one Faction to ano∣ther,
till they fall into unnatural
and diabolical practices, and stray∣ing
from Christ's Fold are made a
Prey unto the Devil, do evidently

demonstrate that the Church-cen∣sures
are not bruta fulmina, but
have powerful effects for the con∣version
or confusion of contuma∣cious
offenders.
But non tali Auxilio, That Sacred
Function which your Lordship su∣stains
in our Church needs not so
weak an Apology as I can make
for it. I have only endeavoured
(as I was able) to silence the re∣proaches
and contradictions of un∣reasonable
Men, by whose strivings
the burden of Government, which
of it self is weighty enough, is
made to sit more uneasie on the
shoulders of our spiritual Guides.
Against whom, it is no difficult
work to maintain that assertion of
Dr. Hammond in his answer to the
Catholick Gentleman, p. 134.
That as long as any particular
Bishop remains in due subordi∣nation

to his Canonical Superi∣ors,
so long the departure of any
Clergy-man that is under his Ju∣risdiction
from that obedience
which canonically he owes to
him, is in him that is thus guilty
of it an act of Schism. But this
comes not now under considera∣tion.
My present endeavours I do lay
at your Lordships feet, as an ac∣knowledgment
of that great hap∣piness
which we of your Lord∣ships
Diocess do injoy under your
Government; in which, Autho∣rity
and Meekness, Candor and
Courage, Piety and Prudence are
so duly tempered, that though
each of them be visible, yet it is
hardly discernable which is most
prevalent. That free and favour∣able
access which your Lordship
hath vouchsafed me in more pri∣vate

concerns, hath incouraged me
to this publick Address for the ser∣vice
of the Church, hoping that
the Work may find the like gra∣cious
acceptance as the Author hath:
both which, as they really need, so
they humbly beg your Lordships
pardon and protection, which will
be a sufficient Sanctuary against all
Adversaries of the truths which he
defends, and therein of
