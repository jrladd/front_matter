Christian Reader,
IF thou art in any measure awake in
these daies wherein we live, and hast ta∣ken
notice of the manifold, great, and va∣rious
Temptations wherewith all sorts of
persons that know the Lord, and professe his
name are beset, and whereunto they are
continually exposed; with what successe
those Temptations have obtained to the
unspeakable scandall of the Gospell, with
the wounding and ruine of innumerable
soules: I suppose thou wilt not inquire any
farther after other Reasons of the publi∣shing
of the ensuing warnings and dire∣ctions,
being suited to the times that passe
over us, and thine own concernment in
them. This I shall only say to those who think
meet to persist in any such enquiry, that
though my first engagement for the expo∣sing
of these meditations unto publick
view, did arise from the desires of some,
whose avouching the interest of Christ in

the world by personall holiness, and constant
adhering to every thing that is made pre∣tious
by its Relation to him, have given
them power over me, to require at any time
services of greater importance, yet I dare
not lay my doing of it so upon that account,
as in the least, to intimate, that with res∣pect
to the generall state of things mentio∣ned,
I did not my selfe esteeme it seasonable
and necessary. The variety of outward Pro∣vidences
and Dispensations, wherewith I
have my selfe been exercised in this world,
with the inward trials they have been at∣tended
withall, added to the observation
that I have had advantages to make of the
waies and walkings of others, their begin∣nings,
progresses, and endings, their ri∣sings
and falls in profession, and conversa∣tion,
in darknesse and light, have left such
a constant sense & impression of the Power
& danger of Temptations upon my mind
and spirit, that without other pleas and pre∣tences,
I cannot but own a serious call unto
mē to bewar, with a discovery of some of the
most eminent waies and meanes of the pre∣valency
of present tēptations, to have been

in my own judgment, in this season, need∣full.
But now Reader, if thou art amongst
them, who takest no notice of these things,
or carest not for them, who hast no sense of
the efficacy and dangers of Temptations
in thine own walking and profession, nor
hast observed the power of them upon o∣thers;
who discernest not the manifold ad∣vantages
that they have got in these daies,
wherein all things are shaken, nor hast been
troubled or moved for the sad successes they
have had amongst professors, but supposest
that all things are well within door, and
without, and would be better, couldest thou
obtaine fuller satisfaction to some of thy
Lusts, in the pleasures or profits of the
world, I desire thee to knovv, that I vvrite
not for thee, nor do esteeme thee a fit Rea∣der,
or judge of what is here written.
Whilest all the issues of Providentiall dis∣pensations,
in reference to the publick con∣cernements
of these nations are perplexed
and intangled, the footsteps of God lying in
the deep, where his pathes are not known;
whilst in particular, unparalleled distres∣ses,
and strange prosperities are measured

out to men, yea to Professors; whilest a spi¦rit
of errour, giddinesse, and delusion goes
forth with such strength and efficacy, as it
seemes to have received a Commission to go
and prosper; whilst there are such divisions
strifes, emulations, attended with such evil
surmises, wrath, & revenge, found amongst
brethren; whilest the desperate issues and
products of mens temptations are seen day
in partiall, & totall apostacy, in the decay of
love, the overthrow of faith; our dayes be¦ing
filled with fearful examples of back
sliding, such as former Ages never knew
whilst there is a visible declension from
Reformation seizing upon the professing
party of these nations, both as to perso¦nall
holinesse, and zele for the interest
of Christ; He that understands not that
there is an houre of temptatiō come upon the
world to try them that dwell in the earth
is doubtlesse either himselfe at present ca∣ptivated
under the power of some woefull
lust, corruption, or Temptation, or is indeed
starke blind, and knowes not at all what
it is to serve God in temptations: With
such then I have not at present to doe; for

those who have in generall a sense of these
things, who also in some measure are able to
consider that the Plague is begun, that they
may be farther awakened to look about thē,
lest the infection have approached nearer to
them, by some secret & imperceptible wayes,
than they did apprehend; or lest they should
be surprized at unawares hereafter by any
of those temptations that in these dayes ei∣ther
wast at noone, or else walke in dark∣nesse,
is the ensuing warning intended; &
for the sake of them that mourne in secret,
for all the Abominations that are found a∣mong,
and upon them that professe the Go∣spell;
and who are under the conduct of the
Captaine of their salvation fighting and
resisting the power of Temptations, from
what spring soever they rise, in themselves,
are the ensuing directions proposed to
consideration. That our faithfull and
mercifull High Priest, who both suffe∣red
and was tempted, and is on that ac∣count
touched with the feeling of our infir∣mities,
would accompany this small discourse
with seasonable supplyes of his spirit, and
suitable mercy to them that shall consider it,

that it may be usefull to his servants for the
ends whereunto it is designed, is the prayer
of him, who received this handfull of see
from his Storehouse, and treasure,
