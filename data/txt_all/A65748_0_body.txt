Honourable Sir,
IT being the purpose of the de∣ceased Authour my Father (ha∣ving some thoughts in his Life∣time, upon the Earnest sollicita∣tion of some friends of exposing this Treatise unto publick view: had not the continuance and increase of our then ge∣neral distractions altered his resolution at that time, and induced him to defer it for a more seasonable opportunity) to dedicate it unto your self being one of his Hearers, as an acknowledgment of your great friendship, and the severall Courtesies he had received from you. I thought my self bound by duty, as not any longer to deprive the Church of God of so profitable a Work; so to pre∣sent it, being now at last (after some con∣siderable delay, by the death of a faith∣full friend into whose hands it was in∣trusted
for that purpose) made publick to recommend it unto no other hand but yours: not doubting of your favourable acceptance in what duty binds me unto. If it may be any way profitable unto your Self, and the Church of Christ, as the Authour shall receive the fruit of his Labour; so it may be an Encourage∣ment unto the Publisher, to commit some other Treatise of the Authours unto the Presse, which may be of general use. That God would give you more and more to discern, his Wisdome, Power, and Goodnesse in his Works both of Creation and Providence, and lay open before you the Wiles and Depths of Sa∣tan; so as you may shun and avoid them, (unto both which this Small Treatise may through the blessing of God afford You with others some Light) is and shall be the Prayer of Him who is de∣voted
