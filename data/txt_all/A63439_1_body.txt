Sir,
SInce 'tis the Mode of the Age, that no Book comes forth without a Dedication, I hope I shall not be blam'd for addres∣sing these Travels to your Self, as being the Person that has contributed so much to the Ornament and Perfection of the whole Work. Hereby have I sav'd the labour of making Encomiums upon an Author, of whom You have testifi'd your Approbation, by the Encouragement You gave the Publisher. Nor is it reasonable, that TAVERNIER coming into England, should prefer others before a person that hath shew'd him particular kindnesses. For my part, after I had tak'n a Prospect of your personal Candor, I knew not where to give so choice a Stranger better Accommodation: not without some regard to my self; since I could not think that

he who had been so kind to the Original Author, would be an Enemy to his Interpreter. Upon which score, as I presum'd at first, I hope You will pardon the far∣ther presumption of styling my self,
SIR,
