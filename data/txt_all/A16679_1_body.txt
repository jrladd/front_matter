ASsumpsits are Law-ties in Courts above,
So be Assumpsits in respect of Love;
This hath induc'd me, Sir, to render you,
Neare to my day, a tender of my due.
For in Gants aged-towne last time we met,
I promis'd you, and promises are debt,
To publish some choice subject in your name,
And in this Toy have I perform'd the same;
Which, give't no pleasing relish to your minde,
It shall by fire be purged and refin'd,
Where by the airie substance of my booke,
May be resolv'd to nothing else but smoake,
But how so re this Subject you approve,
It acts his life and death that many love;
So a, be you but pleas'd to see his death,
Next time we meet wee'll laugh him out a breath:
Meane while accept this gage, till I have time
To mold my love in an exacter line.
For th' Court, where now my suit depending is,
Hath forc'd me write in forma pauperis;
From whence dismist, your equall selfe shall heare
My Muse can mount unto an higher Sphoere.
