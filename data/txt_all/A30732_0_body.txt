MY LORD,
I Have obeyed your Order for the printing this Sermon, and the more readily, because it will be a publick Acknowledgment of the Ne∣cessity and Ʋsefulness of Religion, especi∣ally in your own Hearts and Lives, to the good and happy State of the
 People committed to your Care and Go∣vernment. A Confession very seasona∣ble and honourable in such an Age as this, wherein so little Regard is had to Religion in all our Schemes of Po∣liticks. My particular Obligations to your Lordship do also deserve the most pub∣lick Acknowledgment.
I endeavoured, in this Discourse, to represent and inforce the Magistrate's Duty with the greatest Plainness and Sincerity, that whilst I was preach∣ing the Duty of others, I might not be thought to forget my own.
May the God of Heaven, stablish, strengthen, settle you in every good Work, in a prudent and impartial, a diligent and courageous Execution of those great Offices he hath called you to,
 to the Glory of God, the Joy of the People, and your own double Ho∣nour both here and hereafter. This is the hearty Prayer of,
My Lord,
