THese Hymns were most composed in the dark,
When restless hours interrupted sleep:
With a design to stop that rambling work,
Ungovern'd fancy useth then to keep.
Better make Hymns then yield to Melancholy,
Or take the World to govern by a thoughtful folly.



Hands off you venomous Creatures; you that draw
The rankest Poyson from the sweetest flow'rs:
Yea, that by Rigor of a lustful Law,
Would force Divine love to conform to yours.
I fear, if you should light upon this Book;
You'ld force it from it self, and like a love-song look.



But if you do, our Loves are still Divine;
The stinking Dunghils can't put out the Sun:
While you sing out your shame, we will incline
To sing the Praise of Gods eternal Son.
We will in Psalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Song,
Outsing the Mirth obscene, which unto you belongs.




Come then you Virginâ–ªSpouses of the Lamb,
Joyn consort with the Holy Ones above:
Put off the Clog, your Body, if you can,
And melt your selves into a Mass of Love.
Out with the dregs, and draw the Spirits higher,
Let Love be Love Divine, and not a lustful Fire.



I have liv'd out now, more then threescore years,
And never yet could find my heart in tune
For such a Work as this; it plain appears,
Love's hard to be refined! O, how soon,
Returns the dregs and smut! the strength of Grace
And Ages weakness, both at work, take little place.



Nor had this been expos'd to publick view,
But that the Child was drawn by Cogent hand:
'Twas hard to trust it, when there are so few
Chast Eyes, and pure Minds, abroad the land.
But let it take the Covert of the wings
Of Him, whose work it is; of Him, whose praise it sings.
