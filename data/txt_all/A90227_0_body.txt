Reverend Sirs,
According to my duty at your divine entreaty, I have reduced those pious instructi∣ons received from you, into such a pleasing forme, as I hope, shall not only affect, but abundantly edefie the people of this Kingdome under your holy Jurisdiction; for considering your spirituall care over them, and how your time hath been taken up wholy in the procurement of that sacred Ordinance for Tythes, wisely thought on before the Directory, for he is an Infidell and denyeth the faith, that doth not provide for his family: your late humble Advice digested into severall Asser∣tions: your sore travill and paine you have daly ever since your holy Convocation undergon, to bring to birth his Holynesse, Sir JOHN PRESBYTER; and o∣ther your toylesome endeavours for the Henone of your holy cloth, I have therefore more willingly become your Joyrnoman to ease your Burthen in this your toyle∣some time of Deformation; and having thus prepar'd my endeavoures, fit for the puolike vew, I am emboldned to Dedicate them unto your divine protection, not doubting of the sacred imposition of your hands upon them, to sanctifie them unto the people, as, truly Presbyterean, that comeing forth with your Classicall Authority, they may obtaine a reverent estimation with them. And seeing I have made such a happy beginning, I doubt not of an answerable encouragement from you to proceed as I have begun, but a small matter will please MARTIN, if you sanctifie him with the Benediciae of a Cornelian Benefice of 400. l. per annum, to knocke downe the Anabaptsts, Brownists, &c. with your thumping, bumping, Presbyterean, Classicall CLUB, that shall suffice pro tempore, and withall to gratifie him with the De me of Pauls House that's but a small matter, it will be∣come his worship very well for the present, and afterwards you may doe, as it shall seem best to your divine wisedomes aeeording to his best deservings therein; he is a singular man in such a busines, and wants nothing but preforment; you doe not thinke, neither doth it enter into your hearts, how reverend Yongue MARTIN can thunder-thump the Pulpit, O, he can staer most devnitly, raile and bawle most fervently, storme most tempestiously even till be foame at mouth most precise∣ly; Oh how be can spetter't out! O these caused Anabaprists, these wicked Brow∣nists, these Hecetickes, these Scismatickes, these Sectaries; O MARTIN hath it at his fingers end, ha's an Vniversity man, skild in the Tongues and Sciences, and can sophistioue any Text, O he is excellent at false Glosses, and Schola∣sticke Interpretations, he can wrest the Scriptures most nearly, tell the people

it is thus and thus in the Originall, an excellent man to make a Presbyter! and O Bretheren, if MARTIN thus delude the people & thrash those Hereticks in hope sure MARTIN shall be partaker of his hope, you will not muzle the oxe that trendeth out your corne; no, MARTIN hath better esteeme of the Assembly, he doth not once suppose, that like Bell's Assembly of Priests they'l devoure all them∣selves, and leave nothing for MARTIN, but it is no matter, MARTIN will be content with hard meats rather then desert the service of such on holy, such a reve∣rend Assembly, such a Quagmire of croaking skip-jacke Presbyters, such is his zeale and pious affection to the Cause, he is resolved to worke with his awne hands, rather then be troublesome: Thus committing his endeavoures to your learned Consultations, pious Debates, and sacred Conclusions he rests in expectation of his Reward,
