My LORD,
THough the interposal of my
Lord of Canterburies Com∣mand
for the Publication of
this mean Discourse, may
seem so far to determine, as even to
take away, my Choice; yet I must own it
to the World, that it is solely and entirely
my own Inclination, seconded by my Ob∣ligations
to your Lordship, that makes
this, that was so lately an humble Atten∣dant
upon your Lordships Consecration,

now ambitious to Consecrate it self with
your Lordships Name. It was my Ho∣nour
to have lived in the same Colledge
with your Lordship, and now to belong to
the same Cathedral; where at present you
credit the Church as much by your Go∣vernment,
as you did the School former∣ly
by your Wit. Your Lordship even then
grew up into a constant Superiority above
others; and all your After-greatness,
seems but a Paraphrase upon those Pro∣mising
beginnings: for what soever you
are, or shall be, has been but an easie
Prognostick from what you were. It
is your Lordships Vnhappiness to be cast
upon an Age in which the Church is in its
Wane, and if you do not those glorious
things that our English Prelates did two
or three hundred Years since; it is not
because your Lordship is at all less than
they, but because the Times are worse.
Witness those magnificent Buildings in

Christ Church in Oxford, begun and
carried on by your Lordship; when by your
Place you governed, and by your Wis∣dom
encreased the Treasure of that Col∣ledge:
and, which must eternally set your
Fame above the reach of Envy and De∣traction,
these great Structures you at∣tempted
at a time when you returned
Poor and bare, to a Colledge as bare, af∣ter
a long Persecution, and before you
had laid so much as one Stone in the Re∣pairs
of your own Fortunes: By which
incomparably high and generous underta∣king,
you have shewn the World how fit a
Person you were to build upon Wolseys
foundation: A Prelate, whose Noble
design you Imitate, and whose mind you
Equal. Briefly, That Christ-Church
stands so high above-ground, and that
the Church of Westminster lies not flat
upon it, is your Lordships Commenda∣tion.
And therefore your Lordship is not

behind hand with the Church, paying it as
much Credit and Support; as you receive
from it; for you owe your Promotion to
your Merit, and, I am sure, your Merit
to your Self. All men Court you, not so
much because a great Person, as a Publick
good. For, as a Friend, there is none so
hearty, so Nobly warm and active to
make good all the Offices of that endearing
Relation: As a Patron, none more able
to oblige and reward your Dependants;
and, which is the Crowning Ornament of
Power, none more willing. And last∣ly,
as a Diocesan, you are like even to
out-do your self in all other Capacities;
and, in a word, to exemplifie and realize
every Word of the following Discourse;
which is here most humbly and gratefully
presented to your Lordship, by
