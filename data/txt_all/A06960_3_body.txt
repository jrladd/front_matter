WHen Alexander read Achilles prayse,
VVith honours enuie, and a loftie hart,
He shed stout teares, in ruth of stonie dayes
VVhich to his acts no Musicke could impart,
So all my all, essence of what I am,
Though our Achilles praise play in thine eye,
Feare not records for thine inrouled name,
VVhich shall out-liue immortall Poesie,
A thousand Sirens in the worlds last age,
Shall sing of thee, thy valure, and thy skill,
And to their lines, lay Angells eares in gage,
With soueraign charmes sent froÌ„ a soueraigne quill;
Meane while, vouchsafe to grace my worke & me,
Gracing the soule beloued of heauen and thee.
