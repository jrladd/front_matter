Honoured SIR,
THat which was at first Preach'd upon your Request, and is now Publish'd by your Command, hath a just Claim to your Patronage: And I cannot but lay hold of it as a particular Advantage to my Sermon, to have it recommended to the World under the good Esteem of a Person whose exemplary Vertue and Sobriety, and whose zealous regard for the Ho∣nour of God and Religion, do so eminently distin∣guish his Character in that Dissolute and Profane Age wherein we live.
'Tis for want of more Examples of this kind, that Discourses of this nature are not only useful, but necessary: And till more of the Men of your Rank and Quality amongst us are happily con∣vine'd of this important Truth, That to serve God

is the most effectual means they can use for the Ser∣vice of their Country; and, That to be good Chri∣stians is the very best proof they can give of being good Patriots, we can have no very comfortable Prospect of the lasting Blessings of that Peace and Prosperity which we now enjoy.
This (Sir) is a Truth of which I know you are throughly persuaded: for you have not only pro∣fess'd it with your Mouth, but exemplify'd by your Practice, having throughout your different Stations in the World let both the Court and Country see, that good Inclinations, cultivated by a good Edu∣cation, are able to secure a Man against all those Temptations to which any the most hazardous Cir∣cumstances of Life are obnoxious.
That you may long live to enjoy the inward Com∣fort and Satisfaction of your own Vertue here, and receive the Reward of it hereafter, is the sincere Wish of
(SIR)
