HAving seen a Pamphlet some time since,
Entituled, Reasons whereupon the
Duke of York may most strong∣ly
be reputed, and suspected to be a Pa∣pist:
Not knowing, but that it may come into

the hands of some, whom I would not have Poy∣
with those fallacious Arguments; I thought
it my Duty to Answer them: That the World may
see the Malice and Rage of some Seditious Per∣sons,
who, by loading the Duke with Scandalous
Aspersions, endeavour to lessen his esteem with the
King: And, if that will not do, to brand his
Reputation in the opinion of the Credulous Multitude;
That they may the sooner introduce their own Max∣imes
into the Government; which are not more
fatal to the King, than Destructive to his Sub∣jects.
Therefore, kind Reader, beware, and think
not, whilst these Stigmatize the Duke, they are

Innocent themselves: 'Tis their Guilt makes them
endeavour to overthrow the Government; And, they
had rather see the Nation Ruined then themselves
brought to answer their breach of Laws: And ob∣serve
it when you will, Whoever shall go about to
Fortify the present Government against Faction, and
Rebellion, shall, by the Seditious, be reported to in∣troduce
Popery; Or, to be Popishly affected:
Knowing, at the same time they do so, they win
upon the giddy Vulgar, who have no greater
Antipathy then against the Bishop of Rome:
And by this Device, commonly, they deliver them∣selves
from that Punishment which they ought
justly to undergo. And, this, to me, is a better
Argument, that the Duke of York is no Papist;

since the Seditious only would have him thought
so, then, all the Reasons they have given, can, pro∣bably
make him one. Your belief of this will com∣pleat
my wishes, which are, that you may be Hap∣py,
