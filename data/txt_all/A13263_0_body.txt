MY HONOVR'D Sr.
HOweuer the publishing of other Labours may enti∣tle mee to Osten∣tation, this cannot but touch vpon Humilitie, since I haue exposed that to the Eye onely of a Nation, which I had formerly to the Eare of a World, a Vniuer∣sitie; a World more Glorious then that which inuolues it, by how much it exceeds
the other, in her Iudgement, in her Chari∣tie, and (what is Noble, too) her incou∣ragement; of the latter, I had some taste in the deliuery of this, when I was a fitter object of her Pitie, then approbation, whether shee reflected on Minde, or Body, my Dis∣course, or Mee. But that was the extensi∣on of her goodnesse, nothing that my weake∣nesse could expect, or point at, but the Mercy of my worthyer Friends, amongst whome, as, you were then pleased to approue it, so, now vouchsafe both to peruse and Counte∣nance; In that you shall glorifie the endea∣uours of him, who lookes no higher, then the honour of this title,
