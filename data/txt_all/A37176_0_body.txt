THe King thinketh that the number of things absolutely ne∣cessary to salvation is not great. Wherefore his Majesty is of opinion that there is no readier way to a generall accord, than diligently to sever necessary points from unnecessary; and so that there be a consent in the necessary articles, in the other un∣necessary place may be given to Christian Liberty. The King judg∣eth those Points simply necessary, which are either expresly in the word of God commanded to be beleived or done, or collected out of the word by the ancient Church, by immediate consequence. If this distinction were well applyed to the deciding of Controversies at this day, and divine Lawes fairely severed from positive or Ecclesiasticall Constitutions, it is very likely that godly and moderate men would not long be at any variance in things absolutely necessary. For they are but few, as we said before; and they are already almost agreed up∣on among all that call themselves Christians. And further, his Maje∣stie doth so approve of the former distinction, and esteemes it to be of such moment for the lessening and setling of Controversies (which at this day so much vex the Church of Christ,) that in his judgement it is the duty of all godly men that love truth and peace most diligent∣ly to teach, presse, and urge it.
