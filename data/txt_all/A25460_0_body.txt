Right Honourable,
WHen first the wise Disposer of all States and Persons called me into his Vine∣yard, he apointed me my splace and task, (during my residence in the uni∣versity) by your honours Patronage and meanes.
There were two noysome weeds with which the Garden of the Lord, which is his Church, was then overspread, men being (as if the last

times had been come,) lovers of themselves: and having (to colour that) a form of Godli∣nesse, which to pluck up so far as I was able was my purpose and resolution at my entry.
What was done in order to the formr is yet in the closet, but what was done in reference to the latter is now brought to the house op, my affections leading me still for the good of that people, whose teacher, in those days of er∣rour and darknesse,  by Gods designment was, and whose attention to the truth of what was then taught, did generally appear unto my comfort, and (I hope) their own good by their conforming thereunto, though contrary to the practise of that age, wherein these follow∣ing Doctrines were delivered, men generally giving up themselves to be shaken to and fro by every wind of doctrine, speaking evil of, & devising devises against those that either stood to, or taught the truth of the good old way.
Which last made your honor once merrily shew me, that if I continued so preaching, I should get the whole country about my eares; but, Sir, you know I did and still do continue so preaching, that is preaching down the sins of the times; and

my eares, though sometimes they have glowed, are yet untouched, for I never feared, nor valu∣ed the tongues of men, and against their vio∣lence the Kings laws protected me.
Sir, My design was to maintain the power, dignity and purity of these three grand ordi∣nances, the Word, Sacraments and Prayer, which were trod underfoot by the unreasonable men of that age, who like swine rooted up all things though establish'd of God, that were but tend∣ing to order, decency or uniformity, that their own opinions, though contrary to all Scripture and their own practises, though contrary to all Saints, might alone be nourished and followed; so highly did they love themselves.
The doctrine of the word was throughly handled, and also that of the Sacraments, though here it be impres'd with some addition; Prayer was not at all touched upon, God casting me providentially upon subjects of another na∣ture, untill I gave a farewell to your honour and that people.
Knowing with what the inhabitants of that place was most affected, I was zealous, after three years divertisment, to fall upon that or∣dinance

of prayer, and more largely in some par∣ticulars go through the nature of the Sacra∣ments, and to publish all unto the world. And since Epistles Dedicatory in this kind are usual, unto whose patronage can I better come then unto your Worships, being assured alrea∣dy of your good will, both to the Doctrine taught, and to the Teacher of it, as appeared by those many noble favours which your bounty was pleased to throw upon him.
Accept then, Right Honourable, into your hand, what for the most part you heard by the ear, for should I say all, I am perswaded your Honor would not believe me, here are only the main pillars upon which the doctrine stood, with some small addition in the questions, the rest are enlargments as they dropped from my pen in my Christmas and Lent meditations.
Hoping for your Honours acceptance, I close this Epistle, assuring your Honor that he is not unmindful when he is before God of your self and family, who once was and still desires to be,
From my study at Leighton
July 23. 1661.
Right Hourable,
