RIght Honou∣rable, there was a custom among the Iewes, that such dettors whose debts
amounted their abilities to satisfie, were to be sold themselues, their wiues and children to become slaues to content their Creditors. So calling to minde how farre I stand ingaged to your Honor, not onely for your great and daily bounty, where∣of I haue continually ta∣sted from time to time; but also in that you haue willingly furthered mee by your other many and sundry fauours, when oc∣casion required: the con∣sideration of which for∣ceth me to confesse that I also should incurre the penaltie aboue said; ha∣uing
no other meanes to cancell the obligation, wherein I rest bound to your Lordship; and now in your Honors absence, (aye me) I finde no other like minded towards me. Wherefore as one Sopho∣cles, a poore schollar of Socrates did; so I hauing nothing else, doe dedicate not onely my selfe, but whatsoeuer is of mine, wholy to your Lordships seruice: continually pray∣ing, that the Lord would multiply his many and sundry blessings and gra∣ces vpon you, and yours in this life; and that hee would hereafter crowne
you with glory, and eter∣nall happinesse for euer, with his Saints and An∣gels.
