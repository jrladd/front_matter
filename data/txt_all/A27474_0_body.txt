Madam,
IT is now become so ge∣neral
a Custome to
Devote things of this
nature to some eminent

Patronage, that such as
appear in the World
without a considerable
Protector, seem like men
abandoned by their good
Genius, run a kind of
Gauntlet, and lye expo∣sed
to the lashes of every
Satirical Wit. Thus,
Madam, having found
so much Innocence and
Beauty in this Story, as
made me think it Meri∣ted
a better Destiny; I
have presumed to make

an Offering of it to your
Ladyship, in hopes that
the entertainment it may
afford, will both atone
for the confidence of this
Address, and ingage
your Ladyship to allow
it your Favour and
Countenance. I was ea∣sily
made sensible, that it
could be no where so sure,
as in such a Sanctuary,
since so many Illustrious,
even Divine Qualities
conspire to the Compo∣sing

your Ladyships Cha∣racter,
that it would be
a kind of Prophanation
to attach it, when own∣ed
by a Person of your
Fame and Merit. For
it is not only, Madam,
all the advantages of
Wit and Beauty, of Al∣liance
and Extraction,
that have procured you
that Universal admira∣tion
in the World; your
Ladyship is as much re∣nowned
for the Qualities

of your Mind, as you
are for those of Body
and Fortune, insomuch
that all the Incense the
Age can afford is not suf∣ficient
to Celebrate so
much Merit and Virtue,
nor am I able to express
the respect and Devotion
with which I am,
Madam,
