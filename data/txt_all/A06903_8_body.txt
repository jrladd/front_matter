TWo strong motiues (Right Honorable and moste noble Lord) hath imboldned me to of∣fer this part of my labours to your worthie protection; first your owne not to be contro∣led knowledge in all the best partes of the Arte; and secondly your place which makes you the greate maister both of the best horses, and the best professors of the best Horse-manship; and albe it may be obiected against mee that others of my countrie men haue done so excellentlye in this subiect, that mine will proue but a surcharge to memory, yet (vnder thereformation of your Honorable fauour) I sup∣pose they are so much clad inforraine attire, that their pre∣cepts are fitter for reading then practise; and truely for Gri∣son and other of his ranke (to whome is due all the worthie prayses that possibly can be giuen) and whose memorie I both loue and admire this is mine opinion, that were they liuing at this houre, and saw but some of the horse men and horses of this nation, they would confesse that time and perfection had purgd their skils of many grosse deformities; but of this your Lordship can better iudge by your owne knowledge thē by my relation therefore it shall be grace enough for me, if your honor vouchsafe the viewe of my paines, and please to number me amongst those which euer will be prest to doe your honor ser∣uice.
