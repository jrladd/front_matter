SIR,
THese Discourses which were ut∣tered in Obedience to Your Majesties Command, and out of a Principle of Zeal and Loyalty to Your Sacred Person and Heroic Line, are now humbly prostrate at Your Royal Feet, as a small, but hearty and sincere Testimony of the Duty and Grati∣tude of their Author.
God grant we may have more occasion for Solemnities of this kind, and that Your Majesty may live to see a numerous Issue, that may establish and assure the Throne, and carry down the Image of Your Princely Virtues to the latest Poste∣rity of Times to come,
