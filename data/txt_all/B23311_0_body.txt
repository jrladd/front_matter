I Have formerly in this History presumed to trouble your Honour, and now adventure the second time. Indeed this Treatise con∣taineth the description of your large De∣mesnes, and larger Royalty and Command. Should I therefore present it to any other, save your self, it would be held as a STRAY indeed, (wandring out of the right way it should go in) and so, (without any thanks to me) would fall to your Lordship, as due unto you by the Custome of your Manor.
