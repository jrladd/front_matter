Nle Lady, and my worthy Mother;
THERE are two chiefe reasons why I dedicated this Treaise of the Promises unto your Lady∣ship First the excellency of the subject, with which I know you are much affected,  My neare relation and engage∣ment unto your Self. I deemed

none fit to patronize such a work, but some noble Theo∣philus, or Elect Lady; and to have sought a remoter Friend having one so neere and pro∣per, might have bin construed folly. I wish the Booke may give content unto your Selfe, and others of Gods people, and then I doubt not, but the dedi∣cation of it unto a Christian, and such As Paula & Marcella were to Ie∣rome, so is your Lady¦ship to those iudicious persons, which resort unto you, a great Quest∣ionist, & they to whom you propound your doubts do tam profi∣cere quam prodesse, as well benefit by you, as benefit you. a Christian, will be approv'd. The knowledge of the Promises is necessary for Christians, who do, or ought to live by faith, and therfore this Treatise (I conceive) may be generally usefull unto them both for the right perfor∣mance of holy duties, the exer∣cise

of divine graces, and like∣wise to uphold the soule in all manner of distresses.
1 It will be very usefull for the right performance of any good duty.
What better motive to and help for prayer, hearing,Quis virtutē ampectitur iosam, praemi∣si tollas, Inë Sat. 10. He that be¦leeves not the iude∣ments will never sticke to do any e¦vill, he that believes not the Promiss wil never be forward to do any good rea∣ding, meditation, conference, &c. then to call to mind Gods gracious promises which he hath made to assist us in those services, and to accept them rightly performed? but because I handle this point in the Trea∣tise it self, mentioning the spe∣ciall promises made to parti∣cular duties, I will here pro∣ceed after another manner, and shew, how there are Pro∣mises

in Scripture for every Commandement.
For the first Commandement
How many Promises are made to the true knowledge of God, Psalm 91.14. to the true acknowledgement of God, Pro 6.3. to the love of God, Pro. 8.17. Iohn 14.23. Cor. 8.3. Iohn 16.27. to con∣fidence in God, Ps. 125.1. Ier. 177, 8. Ps. 55.22. Esay 40.31 Rom. 5.5. Ps. 10.5, 6, 7. Esay 6.3. to the Feare of God, Ps. 33.18. Ps 115.13. Ps. 111.5. Lu. 50. ro. 1.7.

For the second, there is a promise annexed unto it, Exo

For the 5 Commandement, there is an expresse promise in it to that speciall duty it in∣joyneth,

Exo: 20.12. & in o∣ther places of Scripture, there are promises to such as being elders in yeers give good ex∣ample to their youngers, and are teachers of good things, Esa 65.20, 22. Iob 25.26, to good Princes, Prov: 20, 28 & 29.19. 1 King. 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. Deu: 17.19, 20. to good Mi∣nisters, 1 Pet. 5, 2, 3, 4, to the husband that is loving and kind to his wife, Pro. 3.10, 1, 12. to the wife that is lo∣ving & reverend to her hus∣band, and wife and carefull in the education of her children, Pro 31.28, 29, 31. 1 Tim: 2.15 to good Masters, Pro. 5.33.

good Parents, Pro. 10.1. & 23 24, 25. to obedient children, Eph; 6.3. Gen: 9.27. of spiri∣uall things, Col. 3.20 Ps, 117 8. Ier: 35.19. Pro: 1.9. & 6 23 24. to Subjects, Ier. 29.7. Rō. 8 13.3, 5. Pet. 2.15. to Servants Pro. 17.2. Col. 3.24. Eph. 6.8. to those which do honour the faithfull Ministers of Gods word, Iohn 13 20. Mat. 10.41 to those that honor their El∣ders in years, 1 Pet. 5.5. Luke 1.1.
For the 6. Commandement, there are many promises in Scripture made unto those, who shall seek to preserve the life of their neighbour, 1 Iohn 4 12. Mat. 6.14. Mat. 25.40.

Pro. 25.21, 22. Mat 5▪ 7, 9. Pr. 14.29. & 16.3. Iam. 1.4. Psalme 25.9. Proverbes 1.20. Ps. 133.1. Luke 6.35, 37 Pro. 29.7, 22. & 21.3, 21. Esa 3..1. Eccl. 10.4. & also to the meek Mat. 5.5.

For the 7 Commandement,
Chastity is a fruit of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. and there

are promises to it, 1 Cor. 6.19 Eze. 18.6, 9.
For the 8 Commandement, See Heb. 13.16. Mat. 5.7. Deu. 5.10. & 24.1, 13, 19. E∣say 58.8. Eze. 18.. Pro. 11.26. & 19.17. Pro. 21., 21. & 22 9. & 28.27. Ps. 14.5. Ps. 116.6 Mat. 6.4. & 10 42. Lu. 6.38 & 11.41. & 14.14. & 18.22. 2 Cor. 9.10. Pr. .10. God pro∣miseth a temporall and eternal benediction to those that are righteous & bountifull to the core, Ps. 1.5. & 112.9. There are promises also to righteous∣nes, or just dealing, Mat. 6.33. Pro. 10. & 1 1. Pro 8.0. to the publik Magistrate hat dealeth justly in judge∣ment,

Pro. 16.12. & 25.5. & 15.27. & 28.16. to the private person that dealeth justly, Deut. 25.15. to him that being just useth diligence in his calling, Pro. 10.4. & 12.24.
For the 9 Commandement, See 1 Pet. 3.10. Lu. 6.37. Gen 1.3. Pro. 3.2. & 18.20. & 20.15.22. most ample goods are promised to those that speake the truth from the heart, Ps. 15.9. Pro. 12.19 23.
For the 10 Commandement, See 2 Pet. 1.4. Mat. 5.8. Iam 4.5.6. 2 Cor. 1.9. Pro. 22.5, 11. Ps. 24.4, 5. & 3.. Pro! 14.2.
Thus graciously doth God

deale with his people, he might out of his absolute soveraign∣ty over us, command only, and we were bound then to obey; but he is pleased (the better to quicken us to obedience) to an∣nex these gracious promises, to his righteous Commande∣ments, and those that truly performe the duty which he commands, shall undoubtedly receive the mercy, which he promiseth.
Secondly, this Treatise of the Promises, may be useful (I suppose) for the quickning and exercising al holy graces. How doth the sound knowledge and frequent meditation of Gods sweet and precious Promi∣ses,

strengthen Faith, quicken hope, in flame zeal, confirm pa∣tience, and foster al the graces of Gods Spirit? When we stag∣ger through unbelif, and are tempted to doubt of any thing, if we would have recourse to the promises, they would up∣hold us▪ as for example, if this cogitation should arise in me, certainly if I doe not as the world doth, I shall loose my cre∣dit, and never come to any wealth, or estate like others, by & by I should remmber what is written touching this mat∣ter, Sam. 3.0. Mat. 6.33. and then consider the genra∣lity nd certainty of these & o∣ther promises, and that would settle the soul.
Lastly, against all troubles nward, outward, painful, sin∣full, of soul, body, good name, state, Faith in Gods promises is a soveraigne Antidote; this is my comfort in my affli∣ction (saih David) thy word (that is, thy promise made un∣to me in thy Word) hath quickned me, Ps. 119.50. He telleth not what kind of trou∣ble he was in; in any trouble whatsoever, he received sin∣gular comfort by meditation in the Promises: by Gods promi∣ses, adversity, sicknes, poverty & death of Friends are sweet∣ned, we are upholden by them in time of temptation, and in the pangs of death, receive

consolation: Against all Evill that may assaile us, 3 thing there are that we may with joy behold in the promise; 1 Protection, 2 Restitution, 3 Deliverance. Doth the Lord permit us to temptation? his grace is sufficient to support us, 2 Cor. 12 9. doth he suffer us to be overcome in tempta∣tion? yet promiseth he restitu∣tion, by a new act of grace, rai∣sing us, and at length to set us out of the reach of all tempta∣tions. In the defects of good things, and the small measures therof, we may draw comfort likewise from the promises. God promiseth,  Preservati∣on, 2 Growth, 3 Perfection, of

ace and glory. If we enjoy a∣y good grace of God, though never so weak measure; first e assures us, that little is a ledge of more, 2 Cor. 1.22, econdly, even that little, he ill enable to get finall victo∣y, Rev. 3.8. and will perfect t to the day of the Lord Ie∣us, Phil. 1.6. and after this ife make us pure as he is ure, perfect as our hea∣venly Father is perfect.
Thus we see what Balme her is in Gilead, what sweet∣es in Gods promises; they are he Christians aqua vitae, to evive him, when he is ready o swound; in al or in any estate be may extract abundance of






comfort from that thrice pre∣cious promise, Ps. 84.11. and those three heavenly conduits of sweetest consolation, Rom 8.18, 28, 32. and if one or a few verses afford so much com∣fort, what cordiall sweetnesse and refreshing may a Christ∣ian sucke, out of all those wells and brests of consolation and Salvation? Indeed the Faithfull can never want grounds of comfort. First GOD the Father is the GOD of all consolation,Esa. 12.3. comforting them in all their troubles,Esay 66.11. 2 Cor. 3.4. Secondly, CHRIST is the Fountaine of comfort, ver 5, Thirdly, the HOLY GHOST

 the Comforter of all the aithfull, oh. 14.16, 20. & 15 6.7, 1 Fourthly, al the Scrip∣ure makes for their comfort, o. 1.4. The whole Gospel is a plentifull Store-house of Com∣fort, called 1 Good or glad∣som tydings Esay 9.3.2. and a good word, Heb. 6.5. be∣cause it cheareth the heart, as good newes doth him that is in heavines▪ 2 The Gospel of Peace, Rō. 10.15. Eph 6.15. because it pacifieth a troubled conscience: but the ve¦ry pith, marrow and quintes∣sence of all true consolation is contained in the Evangeli∣call promises, Psal 119.92. Thus assuring my Self, that

your Lady ship wil often per¦use this booke, wishing tha your Soule may daily prospe by it, and that the LORD woul now fill you with all joy an peace in beleeving these promises,3 Ep of Iohn 2. Rom. 5.1▪ and hereafte crowne you with all happines in the full fruition of the things promised, I rest,
