My good Brethren,
I Do give God most humble thanks, that I had the happiness to have my education and breeding in your College, where I found the seeds of Religion, and learning, the good example of others, and truly many favours in mine own particular; I did ever resolve (in token of my thankfulness) to give you some memoriall, not of any great value or price, but onely out of a desire that I had, (wherewith I did acquaint some of your Fellowes) that you would conform your Studies to the present occasion and necessity of these Times; for whereas before your Studying of Philosophy, did only serve for your Disputations, and your keeping of Acts for your degrees; now I could wish, that they might tend to some practise, whereby they might be more usefull, and serviceable unto you in the course of your lives; and therefore I had thought to have given you all the Mathematicall Instruments, and some things which belong to Chymistrie, together with Optick Glasses, and Herballs, and whatso∣ever else did tend to the Practise of Philosophy; for seeing Man is not wholly spirituall; therefore I would not have him to content himself onely with the Theorie: the charge I confess had not been great, but whatsoever it was, I am now so utterly plundered, that as yet I am able to perform nothing.
In stead of giving, I am now become a suitor unto you, while I was in your College I began a quarrell, and it was against the Socinians,





and the Antitrinitarians; and truly the rather for namesake, because our College is dedicated to the honour of the Blessed Trinity, and therefore we are bound both to the adoration, and to the defence of that high Mysterie; now in my old age upon some occasion, this quar∣rell is again renewed; and as it is usuall in all duels, to have a second, so I do desire your College to second me; and being very old, I cannot live long; for I have now been these nine and twenty yeers to∣gether the Ancientest Bishop of your College I do therefore leave you this Legacy, to be the Heires and Successors in this my quarrell, and to continue a deadly fewd with the Socinians and An∣titrinitariants; and not only to spend your Inke, but to adventure your blood in the cause. Thus I have done my uttermost endeavour, I have desired the secular power to asssist me by way of punishment; and your selves in point of Learning, and Religion, to stand in de∣fence of our Faith, and cause▪ for it concerns, as your souls health, so in effect no less then the foundation of your College.
This is all my business, and here I should take my leave of you; but in truth out of my love and affection, I cannot so soon and so ea∣sily part with you; but I must claim the privilege of old men, to speak of things which are past; and by calling them to minde to renew them, and so to continue them, [ad perpetuam rei memoriam,] It is now much about 54 yeers since I came to your University: and even then both the Church and Learning had many enemies, and they raised up many malitions and false reports, yet during all my time, I may truly say, (for though I was a young Scholar, yet I might fee and know the actions and carriages of my governors) there was not an University in Christendom, nor any City or Corporation bet∣ter governed; neither can I conceive, how it could be better governed, without Religious Vowes: And for our College in particular, I may truly say, that as the Members were not inferiour to any others, for their Learning, and Studies; so for their discreet carriage, and be∣haviour, for their wisdom, and Prudence, in worldly and temporall affairs, I did verily believe, that no society in England, whether of Churchmen, Lawyers, or Citizens, did exceed them: I was then in the hardest times, when the College in effect was new built; when we could not get chambers or lodgings, and the debts were great in re∣gard of the building, yet then did they flourish exceedingly, and had much credit and reputation.
And because I was a Member of several Cathedral and Collegi∣ate Churches (which are now dissolved) lest posterity may hereafter blame them, and think their offence to be great, I shall therefore give them this Testimony, that I take God to witness, I did never see any thing amongst them, but what did proceed from Piety, Charity▪ and Goodness. I was a very diligent observer, and truly in their Chapters things past with as much wisdome and discretion, as ever I did see business pass in the Lords House of Parliament. What charity did we shew to our Tenants, in accepting such small Fines? by our counsel we sometimes made them good husbands; very often we prevented the sale, and preserved the Lease for the true Heirs, e∣specially if Orphans: And in a word, they lived better under us, as Tenants, then ever they will do as they are Land-lords; and I do verily believe, that if the Parliament had been pleased to imploy the Members of the Church, in stead of their Committees, Surveyors, and other Officers, (who were the very worst of men) that with renewing Leases, and putting years into lives; they would have raised as great sums of money, (yet reserving the Rents and Inheritance to the State) as now they have done by selling the Inheritance; and truly we were very provident, in improving the Church revenews; I am at this time in wants, I would desire of God no more to live upon then what I have raised, and improved in Church Rents; and what I have done together with others, that I might have but according to my propor∣tion; so that in a maner pro tanto, we were in effect Founders of the Church; for we might have converted our improvement to our own private uses.
And that posterity might judge of the Clergy, at this time, that we were not so faulty, or wanted courage, which might occasion our Ruine, there are two Common Lawyers who have done very ill offices to the Church, Mr. Selden and Mr. Pryn; and truly I did once think to have answered them both: but when I considered that we did differ in the course of our Studies, in our Method, in our Style, so that we should not have the same or the like weapons to encounter each other, I did therefore forbear; yet some of my intimate friends did it. For Mr. Pryn, he is pleased to write as bitterly as he could against Bishops, yet could he not charge any one of them with Corruption or Bribery, or any great sin; no man is accused for igno∣rance,

or unworthiness: yet it cannot be denied, but the Gentlemen who were imployed for the buying of Impropriations (whereof I con∣ceive Mr. Pryn was a principal man) did tempt Bishops with bribes, with no other intent, but to accuse them; and to me in par∣ticular they sent twenty Angels, in the business of Cicester, but I thank God for it, I had the grace to refuse it. If a man were to write against other Professions, suppose the Lawyers (as God for∣bid any man should) he might have found a hundred times more, and worse faults, then Mr. Pryn hath done against Bishops. And on the contrary I dare boldly say, that many Bishops in their own particular persons, have done so many acts of Piety, of Charity, of Goodness, as all the enemies of the Church, taken together, have not done the like. They that did impeach us of high Treason, onely for entring a Protestation, they would never have spared us, if they could have ound any just cause of complaint against us.
Yet I confess that God would never have permitted us to have suffered in such a manner, as we have done, had we not provoked him with our sins; and that I may be our own accuser, I think our greatest offence did consist in these two things: First, that many of us did not spend our Church-means in a Church-like manner, but converted them to our own private uses, or otherwise misimployed them, therefore God justly takes them away, and permits Sacri∣ledge; we our selves having first offended in the same kinde: for certainly Church-means should have relation as well to the uses, as to the Persons; and a Church-man in mis-spending them, commits Sacriledge. And whereas many excuse it in regard of their Wives and Children; God forbid, but regard should be had of them, ye still with moderation: I cannot excuse the excess of Apparel, and some other courses of expence. Yet this I must te∣stisie or a truth, that speaking privately with some Bishops, they told me (and I beleeved them) that they laid not up one farthing of their Bishopricks: and this may appear, or many of them died very poor, as Worcester, Hereford, Peterborough, Bristol, and not unlike but others will do o.
Another great fault in the Church was, the intolerable abuse of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction; therefore God hath made us now unca∣pable of any Jurisdiction, so just and wonderful is God in all his

Judgements. I confess in mine own particular, I did as much desire and labour to reform it, as any man could do, yet I could ne∣ver prevail. Herein a little to excuse the Church, I have it, and can produce it at this time, under the Kings own Hand and Seal, wherein he forbids that any Church-man or Priest in holy Orders, should be a Chancellor; and this was the occasion of all the corru∣ption of the Spiritual Court: for the Judges at the Common Law have their Pensions and Allowances, but Chancellors have none at all, they live onely upon the Fees of the Court, and fo them to dismiss a cause, it was to lose so much blood: Now if they be naugh in themselves, then they must for their own advantage and prosit▪ have Instruments and Agents accordingly; so the Registers, Pro∣ctors, Apparators, they were pessimum genus hominum. Whil the Spiritual Court was onely governed by Church men and Priests, as it ought to be, (and hath ever been so heretofore) they ha their Spiritual Benefices and Dignities to live upon, and did scorn the Fees of the Court: besides, the holiness of the Profession kept them from bribing and corruption. Little do men think how much they suffer by this one position, That Church-men should not in∣terpose in Civil and Moral affairs: Whereas formerly Bishops and Church-men were onely trusted with Last Wills and Testa ments, and granting out Administrations: and certainly, if ther be any honesty amongst men, it must be supposed to be rather in them then in others; but there having been such an abuse, it must be ac∣knowledged that God is most just in all his wayes, and what hat befaln us, it is according to the deserts of our sin.
And now at length, my good Brethren, I will be no further troublesome unto you, but onely make this small motion, which pro∣ceeds out of my love: Your Statutes do allow the Fellows to travel beyond Seas, to see the state of the Christian world, to better their experience, whereby they may be fitter to do the Church and the State service at home. Now I would fain adde some encouragement i this kinde, and perswade you to be forward, thereby to learn Lan∣guages, and to enable your selves to do the State service; and while you are in your Travel, though you are not publickly imploy∣ed, yet to do your Countrey what good office you can, by way of in∣formation. This is my suit to the Fellows in general: but I do

earnestly intreat the Master and the Seniors, that they would be so far from abating any part of their allowance, as that they would rather give them some addition towards their charge, besides all brotherly assistance and furtherance. This is the onely motion which I make: but if any of your Members should offer me his help in my Study, now that mine own sight and memory do fail me (for I would very fain finish my intended course, to give satisfaction to Natural Reason, in all the Mysteries of Christian Religion) truly, if ever God should enable me, I would reward him. So GOD BLESSE YOU ALL. I rest,

June 4. 1653. being the Eve of Trinity Sunday, which we were wont to keep very solemnly, and I hope you do so continue still.
