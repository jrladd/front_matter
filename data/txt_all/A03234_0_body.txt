Right Honorable,
IT was the speech of a Learned and graue Philosopher the Tutor and Counseler to the Emperour Gratianus, Pulerius multo parari, quam creari nobilem. More faire and famous it is to be made, then to be borne Noble, For that Honour is to be most Honored, which is purchast by merrit, not crept into by descent; For you; whose goodnesse, hath made you thus great. I make my affectionate presentment of this annuall Celebration, concer∣ning which: (without flattery be it spoken) there is nothing so much as mentioned (much lesse enfor∣ced) in this your Ius honorarium, which rather commeth not short, then any way exceedeth the hope and expectation which is now vpon you▪ and therefore worthily was your so free Election, (without either emulation, or competitorship con∣ferd

vpon you▪ since of you it may be vndeniably spoken: that none euer in your place was more sufficient or able, any cause whatsoeuer shall be brought before you, more truly to discerne; being apprehended more aduisedly to dispose, being di∣gested, more maturely to despatch. After this short tender of my seruice vnto you, I humbly take my leaue, with this sentence borrowed from Seneca Decet timeri Magistratum, at plus diligi.
Your Lordships in all obseruance,
Thomas Heywood.
