Most gracious Prince:
BEsides my particular zeale, there is a naturall interest in this ensuing Discourse to your Highnesse, as being the hopefull heyre of this Kingdome of Great Britaine, and the true inheri∣tour of your Noble Vncles vertues,

(Prince Henry) as of his fortunes. The eyes of all men are upon you, in full view of those sweet graces of Nature and ingenuous disposition to go dnesse which all admire. If you shall be plea∣sed to adde these examples and pre∣cepts to those of your Royall Father, taking them hand in hand, they wil lead you in your tender yeares, in the faire continuance of Honour and Ver∣tue; and then his Majesty your Roy∣all Father may for many yeares (for which we hope and pray) be a living Mirrour unto you of Piety, VVise∣dome, and Iustice, and all other Regall Indowments fit for so great a Dignity, to which you are borne.
Glad I am that it was my chance to meet with this pa tof Ireasure, truly ga∣thered by that worthy Knight, decea∣sed Ireasurer to your Highness Vncle;

and great cause I have to rejoyce that by this (through your gratious acce∣ptance) I have the opportunity, hum∣bly to tender, with this, my prayers at your Highnesse feet, for your long and happy prosperity.
