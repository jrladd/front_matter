Honoured Friends,
THis Sermon, though it be primarily Dedica∣ted to a Prince, whom you did always ho∣nour; yet of right it doth most properly be∣long to you, who have been like Princes in the Enter∣tainment of the Kings Friends (for which I can say, you too much suffered then, if not still, by reason of the then prevailing times) whiles they were in exile∣ment abroad, and being in Italy. Amongst which, I cannot but ingenuously confess, though I was one of the most unworthy, yet I was, without any Relation, or Letters of Credit and Commendation to you (the only supporters of Gentlemen in their Travels) most worthily entertained, and for many years, when I was in Italy; still fostered by you. In my last being with you, at my return from Grand Cairo (when after our Conflict with three Spanish men of War, being set upon by them, in the good Ship Recoverie, having discomfited the other two, we brought in the third, the great Alexander, their Admiral, with triumph in∣to Liverno) upon the happy news of His Majesties Re∣turn into His Kingdoms, this Treatise was conceived in your House: In your House it was framed and composed; and in your House, if occasion had served, it should have been delivered. But that which oppor∣tunity then would not permit me to Preach, having
been, (as you very well know,) delated into the In∣quisition, by some ill-confiding Brethren, for Preach∣ing once before, (though not in your House,) there, necessity doth enforce me now, having preached it, for vindication of my self against some Phanaticks, to Print it here. So that, though I could not preach it before you, where it was conceived; yet, being now in Print, I could not but, by way of gratitude, present it unto you, by whom (though you knew not of it) it was foster'd. I know, if it were longer, it would come far short of acceptance, in point of requital for those favours which I have received; and yet I know your ingenuity to be such, that being as it is, you will ac∣cept it, as a testimony of my gratitude. I should, I confess, long e're this, have otherwise expressed my thankfulness, if either I had been restored to my own, (which, though it was given me by my Princes favour, His SaCRed Majesty of happy memory, is still unjustly kept from me by some of His verSHute, and versatile Subjects) or settled in some other Li∣ving. But the late Parliament, An. 1660. (as is sug∣gested,) not permitting the one; and my hard for∣tune, (because I came home alone, and not accompa∣nied with yellow Pages to assist me) not indulging the other; I cannot make those Returns of gratitude, which I then intended, and would still, if ability were answerable to my will, yet see performed: But here Ovids Apology must intercede, and make excuse for me:— In magnis est voluissefatis: or if you please, Sit voluisse, sat valuisse. However, that I might not shew my self to be Ingratus Hospes, (as sometimes Philip, King of Macedon, did inure a Souldier of his with that stigmatical censure,) I had rather, coming lately from exilement, in this exile and low condition, in which I am, expose my self, in the eys of the now fa∣stigious, and fastidious world, to be disgraceful, than
any ways be thought to be unthankful. Upon this ac∣count, Gentlemem, (my worthy, and never to be forgotten friends,) I make this my address to you now, with my first-fruits from the Press, since I came into England; and till such time as it shall please God to meliorate my fortunes, whereby I may endeavour to requite you with deeds, I do desire you to accept of this Pa∣per-Return of words. Yet think not, Gentlemen, that I do intend to  you only with windy words for your good deeds; or to fopp you off with verbal ex∣pressions for your real actions: But assure your selves (and I do enter into Bond before the world for the performance) if ever ability on my part will permit; and occasion on your part shall require it; I shall, with a grateful Metamorphosis, transform these words into deeds; and turning letters into factures, (which yet are both required in your Factory) I shall invest these vocal and sounding words, into substanti∣al and sound works. In the mean time, I shall dispatch my wishes, which are , (if I may so ex∣press that Phrase of Homer) as so many winged mes∣engers to the White-Hall of Heaven, thereto impor∣tune the King of Kings, who is the Author and Dis∣poser of all good things; (who can make Job, and all others, of rich men to become poor; and of poor men to become rich again, as he did him, at his good plea∣sure,) that he will repair your great losses with a re∣duplication of your former fortunes, and temporal blessings, here in this life; and repay your curiesies to me, and to others, which we can never do, with eternal blessedness in the life that is to come. Gentle∣men, these are the darlings of his wishes for you, who acknowledgeth himself to have been, and still pro∣fesseth himself to be,
SIRS,
