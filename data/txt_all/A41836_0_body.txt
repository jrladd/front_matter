Right Honorable, and most Worthy Patriots;
THE following Narrative, and Deduction of the several Cases, gives a brief Account of the vast Improvement and Riches of England by Trade and Enterprises of those two famous Merchants, Sir William Courten and Sir Paul Pyn∣dar, Knights, Deceased, who for their Publick Spirits and Loyalty, had not their Equals in the Age they lived: Their Names being as well known, as their Memorable Actions throughout the World: Their great disburse∣ments upon several emergent Occasions, and their Greater Losses, occasioned by the unhappiness of the late troublesom Times, when Iustice was not only Obstructed, but pervert¦ed to their great prejudice and oppression. Wherefore the Complaynants thought it most seasonable and conveni∣ent to give this following Relation of their Services and Sufferings; and consequently of the Losses and Damages sustained by their Heirs, Executors, Administrators and Creditors, which include many Hundred Families within the City of London and this Kingdom. The causes of Complaint continuing so long are the more grievous, under a Government so renowned for the Laws, Liberties and Properties of the Subjects. Yet since it is the Priviledg of English men to represent their Grievances in Parlia∣ment, the Complaynants have modestly done it, being rea∣dy with their Vouchers upon Record to justify every par∣ticular of their Charge, promising to themselves in this Iun∣cture,

that the Cause of the Widdows and Fatherless may be heard and relieved.
It is very remarkable, That the Ancestors of Sir Wil∣liam Courten, fled out of Flanders into England for Pro∣tection of their Lives, Liberties and Estates in the time of Queen Elizabeth, from the Spanish Inquisition, under Duke de Alva: And that William Courten Esq was forced out of England, to preserve himself from Want and Imprisonment: And even his Son William Courten, the Grand Child of Sir William, constrained to live in Exile, to escape the Prosecutions of his Fathers and Grandfathers Creditors (inter alia) for those very Moneys lent, to supply King James and King Charles the First, towards the Sup∣port of the King of Bohemia, and Relief of Rochel and the Isle of Ree.
The several Abstracts of these following Cases, being of very high import to the Honour and Interest of the King and Kingdom, may easily invite every person that is a Lo∣ver of his Country, to a through perusal, and even to grati∣fy himself with some remarques not vulgarly known,
Obliging thereby, Among all the rest of the persons interessed and concern'd
