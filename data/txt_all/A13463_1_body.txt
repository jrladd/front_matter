MY hearty condemnations, I send forth,
Vnto a crew of Rascals, nothing worth,
(Yet in some sort I wrong their high reputes
Some of them are worth hanging for their sutes)
Such as (to pay debts) haue the meanes, not mindes,
Whose words, and bonds, are coustant as the windes,
Such as thinke satisfaction is a sinne,
And he most veriuous that's in debt most in,
Such for whose sakes, (to my aparent losse)
To Germany, I twice the Seas did crosse,
To Scotland all on foot, and backe from thence,
Not any Coyne about me for expence,
And with a Rotten weake Browne paper Boate,
To Quinborough, from London I did floate:
Next to Bohemia, o're the raging maine,
And troublous lands, I went, and came againe.
Next with a Wherry, I to Yorke did Ferry,
Which I did finde a voyage very merry.
And lastly, late I made a desperate launte,
From Famous London, (sometimes Troynounte)

To Salisbury, through many a bitter blast,
I, Rockes, and Sands, and foaming Billowes past,
That in ten thousand mouthes, the City round,
The lying, flying, newes was, I was drown'd:
But I may see them hang'd before that day,
Who are my Debtors, can, and will not pay:
These toyle some passages I vndertooke,
And gaue out Coyne, and many a hundred Booke,
Which these base Mungrels tooke, and promist me
To giue me siue for one, some foure, some three:
But now these Hownds, no other pay affords,
Then shifting, scornefull lookes, and seuruy words;
And sure I thinke, if I should harrow Hell.
Where Diuels, and cursed Reprobates do dwell,
I might finde many there, that are their betters,
And haue more conscience, then my wicked debtors.
Thus to my seauen-fold troope of friends and foes,
My thankes, and angry Muse, thus onward goes.
