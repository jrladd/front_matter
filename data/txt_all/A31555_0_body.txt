May it please your Grace,
WERE I to present a Poem equal to your Grace's merit, I should justly be guilty of a Crime un∣pardonable, in addressing this, which contains nothing but the unpolish'd draughts of an incultivated Muse, and therefore must implore Your Graces pardon for the Presumption I take to send it into the Censorious World under your Grace's Patronage; all that I can say in it's Defence is, that though it may appear rude and disorder'd, not set forth with so Beautiful an Out∣side, nor dress'd in such gawdy Trappings, as the real and innate worth of the Subject ought to Challenge, yet your Grace will soon discern the foot-steps of a Loyal Endeavour; and indeed nothing ought to Presume to approach your Grace's hands, but what has some Impres∣sion of Loyalty instamp'd upon it.
If Vertue be the only Nobility, certainly there is no greater Vertue than Loyalty, and consequently no great∣er Nohility; it blasts the long and tedious Rolls of Pe∣digrees, and makes Antiquity it self become her adorer.
Nam Genus, & Proavos, & quae non fecimus ipsi Vix ea Nostra voco—

Yet if Nobility can be deriv'd from Ancestors, your Grace has a double Claim to it, the unparallell'd Acti∣ons of your renowned Father, (whom the best of Kings, our present Sovereign, Honour'd with the Appellation of Father) render your Grace Noble, but your Vertue and unshaken Loyalty render you much more so, not only an Heir to his Fortunes and Honours, but to his stock of Vertues, which your Grace has so far improv'd, that I might truly stile you, (and without flattery) one of the strongest Props and Pillars both of Church and State. And, my Lord, I have all the reason in the world to Confirm it, when I consider in how lofty and sublime a Sphere his Majesty has been pleas'd to place you, where your Grace shines like a Star of our first Magnitude, and one of the brightest Jewels in his Sacred Crown.
This (my Lord) arms me with the Confidence to lay this my poor, yet Loyal endeavour, at your Grace's Feet, where I doubt not, but it will meet with a Candid En∣tertainment. Thus once more imploring your Grace's Par∣don, wishing you length of Days, and a continual in∣crease of Riches and Honour, I am
