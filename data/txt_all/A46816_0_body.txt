IT is Solomon's advice, Prov. 27.10. Thy friend, and thy fathers friend forsake not; that is, use all good means to keep and preserve such a friend▪ Such a friend have you always approved your self to the Author of these Annotations, and all his Family: and on that account I am forc'd to think my self obliged to take this opportunity of testify∣ing my grateful sense of such Friendship, by present∣ing to you these Annotations, tho I know they would otherwise have been valued and made use of

for the Authors, as well as your own sake; towards whom, and all his, you have inherited a most kind and affectionate Friendship from your Worthy and Pious Father deceased, and your yet surviving e∣minently Holy Mother, who is as great an instance of a religious, humble, uniform, persevering Chri∣stian, as any I know. I am sure I need say nothing to inhance the value you have for the Authors Me∣mory; whose true, plain hearted, Cordial, affectio∣nate Friendship, I have so often heard you mention with a great resentment of his loss. But I may not forbear gratefully to take notice of your constant and frequent Visits of the Authors Widow, my most dear Mother, notwithstanding the infirmities of her age hath rendred her unable to be apprehen∣sive of the greatness of your kindness. I am never like to have any other way of returning your love and kindness, than by hearty desires of the welfare of you and yours, and praying to the Lord to re∣turn into your bosom full measure, pressed down, and running over. And therefore I heartily pray the Lord to continue those earthly blessings which he hath bestowed on you, and to enable you so wise∣ly to improve them, that they may not hinder, but fit you for those better, most solid, and durable

blessings, which remain to be the portion of all that love and serve the Lord; and that he himself may be a God and Father to you and yours, shall be the Prayer of,
MADAM,
