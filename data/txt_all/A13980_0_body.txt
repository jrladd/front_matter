RIght worthie Sir, Artaxerxes sir-named Long∣hand, the fift king of Persia, vsed to haue the Chronicles both of his predecessors, as also the affaires of his own time, read before him euerie night ere hee setlod his eies to any con∣tented rest; aswell to haue knowledge of the dignity of his Auncestors, as to remember in his raigne how he bestowed himselfe. And Alexander the great, had that noble writer of the famous battell of Troy in such prize∣lesse estimation, that about what affaires soeuer he inclined his ac∣tions, he had his workes about him, nor euer slept but they rested vnder his pillow. Moreouer, comming into a School, and not fin∣the the labors of Homer there, he struck the maister with his fiste, meaning thereby, that the knowledge of Histories, was a recrea∣tion fitting all estates and degrees, and that it was a great and ca∣pitall offence to be without them. For like as in Musicke, manie discord notes and manie tunes make one consent, and one delight∣full harmonie, so in a historie, the varietie and multitude of exam∣ples tend all to one end; that is, the aduancement of vertue, and ouerthrow of vice: offring themselues as a most perfect mirror for man to behold, not the outward portraiture and shape of his bo∣die, but the liuely image and expresse figure of his inward minde, instructing him how to apparell himselfe in decent ornaments, & to discard from him his wilde infirmities.
For what can enforce more to Cheualrie, then not barely to

heare of, but as it were presently to behold, the sage and graue con∣sultations of expert Captaines, the speedy and prouident putting in practise of deuised stratagems, the pollicies and sleights in their present execution, the fauourable assistance and successe of the same, with the fame and renown, that continueth (longer then rich Monuments) of valiant enterprises? Or what can be a more readi encouragement to vertue (which is the soule and light of a good life) then to behold men (who not so much as thoght of before) by their proper desert to rayse their name vntō high estate and Hon∣nour, to giue themselues cause with Cicero to speak of themselus, Egomeis maioribus virtute prluxi:
Or what may giue a greater obiect to loath vice, then to see others whose Nobilitie was giuen them as an inheritance, whereby per∣petually to follow and maintaine the steps of their auncestors, by their vnnoble disposition, to root out the renowne that was raised to them by their parents: For better is it to be Thersites, who was a man of obscure calling, with condition to be Achillis, then to be hauiored like Thersites and Achilles our Father, for vertue is the true Nobility: withall, to se realmes florish, common-wealthes prosper, the laborer beloued, the drone loahed; to see the good Cittizens aduanced, (for euery man should be a citizen to his own Contrey) and the bad dissranchised of anie worthie societic; to see peace and tranquilitie obserued, Nations willinglie to offer their obedience; to see long continuance in felicity, and euery man so desirous to liue, that he may haue an honorable report after death; Or what a more forceable dehortation from vice, then to haue plainely pictured and set foorth, not onely the heinousnes and enormities, that is heire to euery seuerall offence, but also the mi∣series, calamities, punishments, and shames worthily ensuing, as a portion giuen to them in life, with endlesse reproche and infa∣my after death, and so consequently, What can be more como∣dious then a History?
Moreouer, what can be more pleasant to diuide the time, or sa∣tisfie vs in the houres wherein we would be delighted, then to sit quietly and receiue tidinges of things concluded thrugh the whol World: to behold the places, the persons, the times, the affaires, with the order and circumstances in determining the same, to see

so many running streames, so many high and stately mountaines, so many raging and turbulent seas, so manie forrests and vnhabi∣table deserts, so many kindes of strange Beastes, Fowles, Fishes, Serpents, Herbes, Trees: so dissipate and large Countries, so rich and populous Citties, so wel gouernd Common-wealths, so good Lawes and Customes, so sundrie sortes of people, togither with their natures, dispositions, effects, descriptions, scituations, com∣modities, pleasures and displeasures, foundations, continuances and decaies, beginnings, proceedings, and endings of the same: & in such an ample Globe, that they shall not seeme to bee repor∣ted, but instantly presented.
Right woorthy Sir, I hauing at this time brought to an end the Translation of these Histories of Justine, with the Empe∣rors liues (who in so small roome, and in so few wordes com∣prehended, so much with as many & so notable examples, that it isto be doubted, whether it be more briefe of sentence, or plen∣tifull of Subiect, (J staid with my selfe) as if it were to take breath at the end of so laboured a iourney, deuising to whom J might specially dedicate the same as an euelasting monument crected to his name, and he thereby a woorthy countenance to my en∣deuors, the remembrance of your name, did the first present it selfe vnto mee, as a fit foster father to a Childe of such merit, when presently my deuotion accounted the many J might make choise of, as short of your perfections, as a body dyeng, is of a life flourishing, and beleeuing that no disdainefull scorne could grow in so noble a breast, J submitted me to your censure, perswa∣ding my selfe, that this Justine being accepted by Anthony the Emperor in Latine, it could not but be acceptable to you in En∣glish, thus wishing that Fortune might haue eies, if but to cherish you and those you loue, what is mine, euen to my soule is yours.
