I Have prepar'd su∣pream Councel, a∣gainst the much ex∣pected time of your sitting, this treatise; which, though to all Christian magistrates equally be∣longing, and therfore to have bin written in the

common language of Chri∣stendom, natural dutie and affection hath con∣fin'd, and dedicated first to my own nation: and in a season wherin the timely reading therof, to the easi∣er accomplishment of your great work, may save you much labor and interrup∣tion: of two parts usu∣ally propos'd, civil and ecclesiastical, recom∣mending civil only to your proper care, ecclesi∣astical

to them only from whom it takes both that name and nature. Yet not for this cause only do I require or trust to finde acceptance, but in a two∣fold respect besides: first as bringing cleer evidence of scripture and prote∣stant maxims to the Par∣lament of England, who in all thir late acts, upon occasion, have professd to assert only the true protestant Christian re∣ligion,

as it is containd in the holy scriptures: next, in regard that your power being but for a time, and having in your selves a Christian libertie of your own, which at one time or other may be oppressd, therof truly sensible, it will concern you while you are in power, so to regard other mens consciences, as you would your own should be regarded in the power of others; and to consider

that any law against con∣science is alike in force a∣gainst any conscience, and so may one way or other justly redound upon your selves. One advantage I make no doubt of, that I shall write to many emi∣nent persons of your num∣ber, alreadie perfet and resolvd in this important article of Christianitie. Some of whom I remem∣ber to have heard often for several years, at a

councel next in autoritie to your own, so well joining religion with civil pru∣dence, aud yet so well di∣stinguishing the different power of either, and this not only voting, but fre∣quently reasoning why it should be so, that if any there present had bin before of an opinion con∣trary, he might doubt∣less have departed thence a convert in that point, and have confessd, that

then both commonwealth and religion will at length, if ever, flourish in Christendom, when either they who govern discern between civil and religious, or they only who so discern shall be admitted to govern. Till then nothing but troubles, persecutions, commotions can be expected; the in∣ward decay of true reli∣gion among our selves, and the utter overthrow

at last by a common enemy. Of civil libertie I have written heretofore by the appointment, and not without the approbation of civil power: of Chri∣stian liberty I write now; which others long since having don with all free∣dom under heathen em∣perors, I should do wrong to suspect, that I now shall with less under Christian governors, and such e∣specially as profess openly

thir defence of Christian libertie; although I write this not otherwise ap∣pointed or induc'd then by an inward perswasion of the Christian dutie which I may usefully dis∣charge herin to the com∣mon Lord and Master of us all, and the certain hope of his approbation, first and chiefest to be sought: In the hand of whose providence I re∣main, praying all success

and good event on your publick councels to the defence of true religion and our civil rights.
