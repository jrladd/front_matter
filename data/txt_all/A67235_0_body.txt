My Lord,
THe only Reason that obtain'd my consent to the publish∣ing
of the ensuing Discourse, was the Opinion they had
who heard it, that it might be serviceable to his Ma∣jesty,
by reducing some of His misguided Subjects into a right
sence and practice of their Allegiance towards Him; to which
end I beseech our good God to give it his blessing.
And the Honour I have to be related to your Lordships truly
Loyal and Religious Family obligeth me to Dedicate it to your
Lordship; most humbly begging your Lordship's acceptance
of it as a Testimony of the Duty owing to your Lordship, from
My LORD,
