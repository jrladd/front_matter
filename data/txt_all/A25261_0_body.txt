TO all Master Vintners residing in London,
And Westminster, both to the Rich and the Undone.
VVho when Wines are grown sick, and have Workings amain,
Can with Caudle of Eggs to Life fetch 'em again;
And when with a Flying Lee troubled, with Allum,
Bay-Salt, and White-Starch, to their Sense can recall 'em;
VVho when Clarets are Ropy, and apt to be Muddy,
Can with Spirit of Wine make 'em leave their brown Study;
VVho when French Wines are Eager and just about Pricking,
VVith Allum and Flanders-Tile make 'em leave Kicking.
VVho with Racking, Infusing, and Clarification,
Play some delicate Tricks with the Wine in this Nation.
To all Female Bar-keepers, Young, Airy and Pretty,
VVhether Widows, Wives, Maids, Pert, Brisk Merry and VVitty,
VVho can Banter young Fops, of their Mony and Reason,
VVith a Wit, which like Beauty is ne're out of Season.
To those Riddles of Men, whom we VVine-Coopers call,
Neither Merchants nor Vintners, and yet they are all;

Who with Peggs, Peircers, Addice, and large pair of Bellows
In their Vaults would be thought to be very good Fellows.
To all the choice Lads who are Cellar-men known,
Who visit the Hogsheads when Company's gone.
To all Dealers in Wine, of what Figure or Fashion,
Is Humbly Presented This new Visitation.
