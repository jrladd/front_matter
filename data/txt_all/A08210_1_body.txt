MAdam, seeing diuers haue di∣uersly reported, and written, of these voyages and actions which J haue attempted and made, eue∣ry one endeuoring to bring to light, whatsoeuer inklings or coniectures they haue had; whereby many vntruthes haue bene published, and the certaine truth concealed: as I haue thought it necessary my selfe, as in a Card t pricke the principall Points of the counsailes taken, at∣tempts made, & successe had, during the whole course of my imployment in these seruices a∣gainst the Spaniard, not as setting sayle, for maintainnig my reputatiō in mens iudgement, but onely as sitting at Helme if occation shall be, for conducting the like actions hereafter: So J haue accounted it my duty, to present this Discourse to your Matie. as of right, either for

it selfe, being the first fruits of your seruants Pen, or for the matter, being seruice done to your Mati. by your poore vassall against your great enemy, at such times, in such places, and after such sorte, as may seeme strange to those, that are not acquainted with the whole cariage thereof: but will be a pleasing remembrance to your Highnesse, who take th'aparent height of th'almighties fauour towards you, by these euents, as truest instruments, humbly submit∣ting my selfe to your Gracious censure, both in writing & presenting: that posterity be not depriued of such help, as may happily be gay∣ned hereby, and our present age (at least) may be satisfied, in the rightfulnes of these actions, which hitherto haue beene silenced, and your Seruants labour not seeme altogether lost, not onely in Trauell by Sea and Land, but also in writing the Reporte thereof, a worke to him no lesse troublesome, yet made pleasant and sweet, in that it hath beene, is and shall be, for your Ma•ies content; to whome J haue deuoted my selfe, liue or dye.
