Men, Fathers, and Brethren,
I Have with a mourn∣full eye, and a sad heart beheld the distracti∣ons of these times, and seene the devill, that Mille-artifex, taking the opportunity (as alwaies he doth) to erect his throne upon our wofull
miseries. They say Rome must packe out of England, so 'tis credibly repor∣ted: and now the Envious-one la∣bours to bring-in Amsterdam. The KINGS power, in causes Ecclesiasti∣call, must be taken from the Pope, and reason good: and now the devil la∣bours strongly to lay it upon the people; so that (if the devill can do it) Caesar must alwayes behold his Glory in Captivitie. Ceremonies must downe, and let them fall, if they and the Gospell may not stand toge∣ther; but let not American novelties ponere obicem, to the Covenant of free Grace. Stand fast (yee Worthies) and acquit your selves like men; View over this Treatise (I beseech you) and (if it may not be to your dispa∣ragement) vouchsafe it your Patro∣nage.
Nay more (if you thinke it may any way further the Protestant cause) joyne with me (I pray) in pre∣senting it to the Honourable Court of PARLIAMENT. Nothing is herein (for ought I know) dissonant to the Orthodox faith. It is the first fruits of my labours that ever saw light, and I Dedicate it to my deare Mother, knowing that hereby I shall have an affectionate construction put upon all mine assertions. I pray let it not be thought ambition in me, that I sue unto you for Patronage, but accept all in favour, as I present all in love: What is amisse (I pray) correct, and what is right (I pray) allow. And thus (not to retard your more weigh∣ty imployments) I commit you all to the good dispose of Israels Keeper
(who can do for you beyond what I can aske or thinke) and so I rest
