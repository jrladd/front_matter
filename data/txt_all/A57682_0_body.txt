'TIS not unknown, how you have vouchsafed to espouse my Cause in many difficulties I have strug∣led with. Which is very much my Glory, that so eminently worthy and accom∣plisht a Person, and so great a Votary of the Church of England as Your Self, hath not only judged favourably, but on many occa∣sions actually interested your self on my be∣half. It therefore behoves me to lay hold on any opportunity to demonstrate a grateful Mind, tho' it be accompanied with a new Ad∣dress for further Favour, as this at present is, to countenance a small Polemical Dis∣course; for I cannot but call to mind, hav∣ing so well experienced its truth in you, that known Aphorism, which a Reve∣rend Prelate lays down in the close of his Parable of the Pilgrim: Those will be our best Friends, not to whom we have done good, but who have done good to us; which speaks the abounding goodness of a Benefactor. Ʋpon this ground I take the confidence of making this Dedication. 'Twould be tedious to recount to you the various Motives that have induced me

thus to engage in this Controversie, when so many Tracts have been already set forth of this Nature; it may suffice to clear me from all aspersions, that I can justly say from the Observation of others, as well as my own, that 'tis, like the Quakers, a growing Sect with whom I contend; and that they have lately, in my Parish of Up-Ottery, built them a Synagogue of such a Structure, as if they meant it should out-vy the Parochial Church there. These things, I humbly conceive render it necessary, and make it my more pe∣culiar Province, to endeavour with others to stop the growth of the Faction, that so my own Flock may not be worried and miss-led; but that I may be assisting to them in my ne∣cessary absence, as well as when I am present amongst them; and by any means reduce some, and prevent others from going astray from the holy Communion of our Church, whose Peace and Prosperity all its true Members, especially the Clergy, ought to Consult and Promote. Sir, my Prayers and Endeavours are intent upon these Things, and as far as I continue stedfast in such labours, I am se∣cure of your good Opinion,
