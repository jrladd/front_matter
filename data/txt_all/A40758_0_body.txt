My Lord,
YOUR Command to Preach, and your Incouragement to Print this Sermon, have given me the Confidence thereun∣to to prefix your Name, and more especially yours, for that Respect you have to Truth, Loyalty, and Peace, the Pro∣moting of which is my sole Aim in casting this Mite into the Trea∣sury of the Church.
I am fully satisfied, it will meet with a multitude of Enemies, be∣cause the Church hath many: but I look on't as a shame for that matter to concern my self, after its Consecration by the Blood of so many Martyrs, especially that Royal one, King Charles the First, who hath given us an Example, not to be Paralell'd, but in one only, in that of our Blessed Saviour.
I pray God grant (when his forty Years of Patience shall be ex∣pired, and so long he waits to see if a People will Repent) this Nati∣on may not suffer for that Prodigious Wickedness (as we have just Cause to Fear) the like things that Jerusalem did for Crucifying Him.
But my Hope is, it will not; and that for this Reason; because it was not the Clergy of the Church of England, nor was it any thing in her Doctrine, or Liturgy, that brought our most Gracious, and Re∣ligious King to the Block; but Rebells, Murderers, Traytors, Spiri∣ted by Achitophel's Chaplains, who, if they might have had Leave given 'em, would by this time near hand have Prayed all Christianity out of this into another World.
God Almighty preserve his Sacred Majesty, that now is, from the
 Divinity and Mercy of such Men; and then I doubt not, but he will ever, as he hath done, proceed to Protect that Liturgy joyfully, which directs us to Pray for him so devoutly, shewing it self in that Re∣spect, as well as many others, to be truly Apostolical.
My Lord, It would be Libellous for me to Recommend these things to your Wisdom and Care, because 'tis to move you to that which you already eminently do I shall only therefore Pray for your Lord∣ships Health, and that God would be pleased to continue his Blessings to the Church, and to this whole Nation, and so give off: only beg∣ging the Honour to Subscribe my self,
