NOBLE SIR,
THat I prefixe so deserving and eminent a name before such light stuffe: I doe n more then Tavernes and Innes doe, with us heere in England, and in o∣ther Countreys, to credit their houses, hang up at the porch, the Pictures (for signes) of Kings; Queenes, Princes and other eminent Persons, under whose subjection they live, or unto whom they stand most affected. The Great Turk sets his own stampe upon Terra Lem∣nia, an Earth, or Clay; Virgil thought his Gnat not unworthy the view of Octavius Caesar: and with the same confidence I offer thes few leaes un∣to your view; who are so belov'd at home, and honor'd brad, especially for that your memorable service

somtime at Mount Auban in France, that Towne even to this day acknowledging her safety, and pre∣servation to your valour onely, and whom for your resolution and forwardnesse in our late Fleete, your Noble Admirall, the Earle of Lindsey honored with the dignitie of Knighthood: If your selfe, Sir, or any else shall aske mee, If I had no better imploy∣ment to set my selfe about then this, I could answere them; The wisest Counsellers and greatest Scholars have ever season'd, and sweetened their profoundest Studies, and greatest employments, with these and the like passages of inoffensive Mirth. Erasmus commended the Foole. Homer writing his Illiads, wrote also the battell betweene Froggs and Mise. Fannius extolled the Nettle; Sir Phillip Sydney made good sport with Rhombus his Countrey Schoole-master: and the like many others. Besides, wee live in that Age, wherein Difficile est Saty∣ram non scribere. But the trueth is, I being at this time in hand with a serious and laborious work for the Presse, ere long to see light; my Printer desi∣red of mee, that hee might not sit idle in the meane time. Sir I take my leave, desiring to bee remem∣bred and recorded among the number of those, who for your owne worth and goodnesse, truely love and honour you.
February 19. 1636.
