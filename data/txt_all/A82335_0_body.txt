Ye justly challenge all Respect and Love
From me, who do in that same Body move
With you, who by the Pen and Ink Command
Th' attendance here of Nobles of the Land.


Here by this Letter I present you Love,
How richest Friends Unnatural oft do prove;
How I have run a little piece of Fate
By rash procedure, and my now Estate:
Sweetness of Converse, and the Divine Man
Contempt of Riches hereby you may Scan.


The Matters Flat, Unpolish'd; but 'tis true:
Receive it kindly in it's Nat'ral hew:
I have not Homer's, Pindar's, Virgil's flight's
Dryden's nor Cowley's, these Terrestrial Lights;
Neither could I by this rude, vulgar Letter
Better things write than taught me GOD and Nature:
I have not Cicero's nor Demosthenes wits,
Nor fluent Raptures and Diviner fits
Of a Commanding Eloquence, to dare

And damp the Vulgar, else you'd had a Share:
Nor Soaring Flights of Poetry to give,
Or write with more Success than I can Live.


The Prodigal Returned, receive with Charms,
Of Love, and take him kindly in your Arms;


For as the Romans by their Wit and Sense,
More than by Force, contriv'd a strong Defence;
So Love and Friendship by Mysterious Arts,
Vanquish the hardest Adamantine Hearts.

GENTLEMEN,
