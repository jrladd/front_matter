Dear and Christian Friends,
TAking notice of many pretious lines that have been to the view of all, which have made for the honour of God, and good of his people; yet having not read any as yet speaking of that I speak to in this Treatise, even the duties of Ministers and People one towards another; but have heard much com∣plaining,

one speaking hardly of the other, whereby God hath been dishonoured on both parties; which was one great motive to this work, wherein you may see how Pastors ought to be, and what they ought to do, and how people ought to behave themselves to∣wards their Ministers, in words, and actions, according to the minde of God, revealed in the Scriptures, so that they might not accuse one another wrongfully, and bring the anger of the great God on them for so doing. My whole end, and aim, and hearty desire, is, That both Ministers and People may walk so, as to discharge a good conscience towards God and one another, that all may be found blameless, and presented spotless unto God the Father at the last day, when there will be no re∣spector of persons; which is, and shall be the Prayers of me
