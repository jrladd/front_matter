May it Please Your Lordship and Worships,
THese Three Books of Assize, most hum∣bly crave to be admitted to the Freedom of this Honourable City. Their Design is not to Intrude on any Corporation, but rather to be Admitted among them all, as a help to each Member. First, To the Majestrates, to ease them of the great trouble of Calculating every Assize, and Regulate the Weight of Bread, so that every one (but especially the Poor and the Soldier)
 may have their full Weight for their Penny: Ac∣cording to such plenty, as GOD will be pleased to afford. Secondly, To the Bakers, that they may not mistake in the Weight they ought to give, and so prevent the Seisure of their Bread; and the Punishments which follows. Thirdly, To all other Freemen, that they may be Judges themselves whether they get full Weight or not: But particularly to the Grand-Juries, who are the proper Judges between the Bakers, and the poor Prisoners; unto whom all Bread under Assize do justly belong.
The Premisses considered, and for as much as they will without doubt be useful to all Citizens.
May it please your Honours to grant this Humble Request, and unto me the Liberty of Subscribing my self, as in Reallity I am
