I Am (Noble Maecenas) a spendthrift, vnwisely libe∣rall; more prone to propine Presentes, and make foo∣lish Feastes, then to pay my Debts: All my babling Bils are alreadie baptized, and nothing left, saue these subsequent Songes; which to your Honor, in all duetifull loue and deuotion, I dedicate. Philopae∣men did sometime leaue his companie, and com∣ming aloue to a house where he was expresly looked for; his Hostes, who knew him not, and saw him so euill fauored a fellow, employed him to helpe her

Maydes to draw water, and mende the fire for Philopaemen. The Gentlemen of his traine find∣ing him busie at worke, enquired what he did? who answered, I pay the forfeyture of my vnhand∣somnes. I haue thought good (my Honorable good Lord and Maister) to giue these Songs the last place in my Booke: if any demaunde the cause, I answere with Philopaemen, For their methodles and irregular vnhandsomnes. If your Honor doe not protege and defende them, some Parasiticall Abdagasis will seeke to kill Asineus and his bro∣ther vnder trust: But be you a royall and seconde Artabanus, who sayd to Abdagasis, (I can not cōsent to betray a man that trusteth to my protecti∣on; and since he hath giuen mee his hand, I will keepe the oath I haue made to him by my Gods:) Doe herein (deare Lord) as you will encourage mee hereafter to vndertake a greater taske. I haue highly (I confesse) abused both time and talent in these amorose and idle toyes. But your Honor vpon the gracious acceptaunce hereof, may haplie ere

long see mee recouer my estate, and reedifie the de∣cayed walles of my youth. What I haue heere set downe, is for your sollace; and so I beseech your Honor to accept from the Table of my Chamber, at your liberall charge and allowance, the .5. day of Nouember 1606.
