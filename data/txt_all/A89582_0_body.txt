My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Am not ignorant of the truth and weight of that speech of Pliny, Aliud est scribere uni, aliud omnibus: the same holds of Preaching, it's one thing to Preach a Sermon to a Congrega∣tion, another thing to Preach it to all the world in Print; especially upon such an occasion as this, and such a season as this, when the spirit of jea∣lousie and mis-understanding is let loose, and mens

hearts as tinder ready to catch and kindle at eve∣ry sparke; yet since you are pleased to conceive that this plaine Sermon may bee usefull to others, and thereupon to order my publication of it, I hum∣bly obey your Order, desiring the Lords blessing to accompany it so farre as to make men wisely con∣sider the wonderfull works of God, and returne to him the glory due unto his name; The same Lord watch over you, sanctifie you and guide all your consultations, that you may bee his blessed instru∣struments to make this Land a quiet habitation for his people, and a place which himselfe may delight in: This is the daily prayer
