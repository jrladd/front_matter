MADAM,
THIS Work was design'd and begun when
Our Church was in the Lowest degree of
Danger, out of a belief that it might contri∣bute
something to her Preservation, in that Storm which
lay so heavy upon her; the Duration of which could
then be known to none but God.
I thought That a seasonable time to Imitate the Di∣vine
Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and to set
before us that Cloud of Illustrious Persons who had with
an Heroick Courage baffl'd the Rages of former Per∣secutions
by their Faith and Patience.
The Reflections I had, in private made to my self,
on the many Deliverances the Holy God has, in these
last Ages, so often wrought for his distressed Church,
when she seem'd ready to be swallowed up by Popish
Fury and Fraud, was so great a support and comfort
to me, in those Melancholy days, that I passionately
wished I had had some means of communicating them
to others.

To that End was undertaken the Translating this
Excellent History, as the best means I could think of
to raise the same Thoughts in others: And as Your
Majesty was ever in our Minds, I wish'd I might have
some favourable opportunity of laying it at Your Feet,
tho' I could then have no prospect of that Happiness.
Since then the late Wonderful Revolution has put
so sudden and unexpected an End to our Sufferings and
our Sorrows, and brought Your Majesty back to Eng∣land,
to be the Defender of our Holy Faith, and the
Deliverer of our oppressed Church; I humbly beg
Your Gracious acceptance of this History, which is due
to Your Majesty, as the chief Patroness of the Refor∣mation.
That God would, for many years, continue us un∣der
Your most Auspicious Government, and at last re∣ward
Your Piety and Virtues with a more Glorious
Crown in Heaven, is, and ever shall be, one of the
most fervent Prayers of
Madam,
Feb. XX. 1688-89.
