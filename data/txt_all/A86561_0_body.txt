Men, Brethren, and Fathers,
I Propound unto your consideration this ensuing Discourse upon this much-discussed point of Infant Baptism, not that I conceive my self able to instruct you, but because I desire the point may be well looked into and further scan∣ed, that the truth of God therein may be made more evi∣dent to all, that what is Christs may be owned and more cleared to be his, and what is of Antichrist may be discove∣red and thrown down, and that the Churches of God may be established in more Peace and quietness in this matter, to which things by my forwardness I would provoke others that hitherto have done little or nothing herein. I have herein acted to my little ability, according to the talent given me, searching the Scriptures about this matter, ra∣ther then old Ecclesiasticall Authors, of whom I am not so richly furnished, as many others be, and amongst whom I finde difference, and little certainty save in this, That di∣vers testifie that the practise of it hath been very Ancient,
 and none of them point us to any certain known begining of it in the Church of God. Some rather disliking it unless in some cases of supposed necessity, and others commending and pleading for it, none that I finde wholly condemning it, I mean none of primitive standing within the first five or six Centuries at least; for the manner of Baptizing Anciently they seem more cleer that it was usually by plung∣ing or diping in their heads, save that some did it but once, some thrice; but I question whether their practise be at all obliging, I conceive not further then the Scripture hath tyed us. I would not willingly abet any Antichristian pra∣ctise, and as unwilling am I to condemn that that is Chri∣stian: how I conceive it to have ground and bottom enough in the Gospel and Apostolical writings, I have here expressed; if any of you see further into it either pro or con, I desire not to shut my eyes against it, but yet further to weigh what shal by any of you be propounded to the Church hereabout, and therein to my self, who shal God assisting, in∣gage that if any or all the Antipaedobaptists shal substantial∣ly Answer and confute what I have here propounded, I wil (unless God give other and further light yet) never more Baptize any Infant, but I conceive they will not do it, but leaving my self and endeavours to Gods blessing and your perusall, I am bold to subscribe my self
