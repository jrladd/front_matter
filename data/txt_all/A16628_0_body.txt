RIGHT HONOVRABLE, and RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL.
SALOMON sayes,Eccles. 3.7. There is a Time to keepe Silence, and a Time to Speake. From this Rule take I this boldnesse, upon a just occasion to
 present this my duty & care to this Fame-crown'd Citie, in You; who are indeed Her Three-fold facultie of life: I confesse my selfe to You a Stranger, but yet I am a Sonne of London: in her womb had I both Birth & breeding. Her danger is apparent, Shee grows sick; and I (having skil not only to see it, but also to do something hopeful in it) dare not be silent; It is now my Time to speak. Let your Noble favors then streng∣then this weak Hand which a Sons duty reaches forth to a Mothers support. Grate∣full Pitty commands me thus to do; and my knowledge both by Reading & Experi∣ence justifies the act. Yet such is the nature of Detraction (who is grown a Giant in this Age) that if a man will seem to shew that he knows more in some things then ma∣ny others; he shall thereby the more em∣bolden those that know lesse to cry him down I have cause to speak this, & there∣upō have cause also to flie to the shelter of your Honored wings for protection; which obteyn'd (as from your farre-fam'd Goodnes I have assurance, I shall) I will remaino.
