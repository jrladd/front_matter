MAy it please Your Excellence, to accept the affectio∣nated tender of your humble servant, for why your Noble and Iuditious Honor hath still been held a Patron of the Muses, a Lover of Arts, and Art∣like Siences, and all good Arts ingenious man attaines to; Let not me then dispaire, though the first dip of my weak forward Pen ascend unto so high a Dedication, I gently crave it might not meet refection, because it is my love, if so, it would quite kill my hopes prepared journey, and that sacred Mount I now am labouring up, fall from't, and perish, and made a scorne unto the Law∣rell tree, in my desire to touch it, but noble Nature mixt with gentill Spi∣rits, ascends like Mirrh unto the saving Heavens, and gives the same de∣sire to you on earth, from whose favours warmth, I hope my spring flourish, and these few mixt Poems here in Prose and Verse, he mildly sensured; and my obedient Service, with my love thought free from flattery, to whose Noble and Iuditeous sensure I recommend them unto Your Excellencies view.
