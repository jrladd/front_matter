Reverend Sir,
THE Importunity of Friends could never have prevailed with me to let this Discourse come abroad, had not your better Judgment complyed with their desires. This is enough to make it pass among those within; And as for those without, I must expect to become their Enemy because I tell them the Truth; and though I have endeavoured to rebuke them with a spirit of Meekness, I do not suppose they will receive it so. They have a way of answering us, by those Instru∣ments of Cruelty that are in their habi∣tations; so that we shall never reply more, unless by our blood, that cryes for Vengeance. But the Will of God be done: If we must be sent as Sheep in the midst of Wolves, and that too by the great Shepheard and Bishop of our
Souls, it behoves us all that are under-Shepheards, by Patience and Innocence to become Examples to the Flock. But I hope the Lord of David will snatch us out of the Jaws of these Lyons and Bears, and Experience works that Hope that he who hath deliver'd, will deliver us; and he hath deliver'd us out of six troubles and out of seven. But whatso∣ever becomes of such mean Lamps as my self, my hearty Prayer to God is, that such burning and shining Lights as You are in the Church, may never be put out by these Extinguishers, but continue to turn many unto Righteousness, till in God's good time you shall be translated to shine as Stars in the Firmament of Glory. Sir, I earnestly recommend you, and all your Pious and learned Labours in the Vine∣yard, to the Blessings of him who is Lord of it, and am
From my Study  this 16 Novemb. 1678.
