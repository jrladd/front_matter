Right Honourable,
I Am emboldened to desire your approbation of this ensuing Treatise: in all ten∣derness of heart, humble∣ness of minde, and sincerity of love and affection I pre∣sent it to you. In which I commend to your considerations the most weighty Case of Blasphemy: and the rather, in that I see the wise of the world are at a to-be-admired loss about the nature and being of it; the most wise God, as by a veil, having hid it from their eyes; whose glory is most neerly con∣cerned therein. And your selves are never able to discharge your trust to God or Men,
but in your conscionable declining of it with fear in your selves, and suppressing it in others.
I have no more to commend to you, but my remembrances of you to God, that he would sanctifie you to the great work he hath to do in the world; and that he would also direct you in the way thereof, and enlarge your hearts thereunto, that glory may dwell in our land; that your selves may be accepted with, and saved of the Lord, in the day of salvation, and the people (as they are capa∣ble) by you.
And so resting, I remain, as I am bound in duty, to be a faithful well-wisher to you all, and to all in the nation under you; subscri∣bing my self
From Winton, Novemb. 22. 1653.
