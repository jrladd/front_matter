My LORD.
THE abundance of indulgent Favours I have received from your Lordship, and the No∣ble Family to which you are now ally'd; made me presume, humbly to crave your kind Ac∣ceptance of this First Fruits of a Young Muse: And tho I cannot assure my self of deserving so great an

Encouragement as your Lordship's Espousal of this Trifle; yet I will, to my utmost Endeavours, sa∣tisfy the World, how much a generous Patronage may encrease a natural Genius, and that an indiffe∣rent Beginning may, by the Assistance of so great a Person extreamly improve it self.
For what bold Censurer (tho never so Maliti∣ous) dares question what your Lordship takes in∣to your Protection: Safe, I'm sure, it will remain, as plac'd upon an Altar: And indeed, when I call to mind how many, less deserving than your Lord∣ship, have been stiled Hero's, and Demi-Gods, it makes me accuse the Ingratitude of our Age, and call much in Question its Judgment.
Give me leave, my Lord, but to call to mind (tho far too worthy for my Pen) the famous, and never to be enough praised Actions of your An∣cestors, the Douglasses, whose personal Valours have always been so great, that they seem'd the Souls of Armies, as having Life only where they charged: And whatsoever Quarrel they espous'd, Victory al∣ways dwelt there: Their Courages were such, that what is in ancient Legends of others Romantick, was really justly true of them.
And since they are gone to encrease the Number of the Hero's above, who does not see the true Image of their Souls in your Lordships: Every thing you undertake must have Success, for what you do is with such a noble Assurance, that Fortune seems afraid to contradict it; and you carry her with you

always bound, and in Subjection to your Pleasure.
Indeed every thing in you is Extraordinary: To witness only your first early Valour with a Person of Honour, which shew'd an Example of your ex∣act Niceness in Gallantry, and was the true Test of Courage.
Give me leave to add to the rest of the Virtues, the Loyalty of your self and Family; the never to be forgotten Transactions (now fresh in Memory) of your Two illustrious Relations, the Dukes of Hamilton; One sacrificed for his Prince, by the bar∣barous and detestable Rebels; and the other, re∣gardless of his Life in so meritorious a Cause, dy∣ing in endeavouring the late King's Restauration.
And tho their Sufferings are as well set forth as an original Collection, and an ingenious Historio∣grapher could well model: Yet the secret Virtues of that inestimable Pair, which, but themselves, and the glorious Martyr they liv'd and dy'd for, knew: Imagination cannot reach, of if known, 'twould tire Fame to sound 'em.
And still to add to your Never-dying Name: This last happy Union, with a Family of such Worth, that Fortune seem'd proud of the Match, and contrived it as an Honour to both Parties.
What a vast Happiness do I enjoy that have a Person of so unparallell'd a Family as your Lordship, to countenance my feeble Endeavours; and tho the Worthies of the World might justly claim the Ho∣nour I sue for; yet, as the Widdow's Mite was

acceptable, so may this poor Performance be to your Lordship's unbounded Goodness.
Perhaps some Momuses of this Time, may imme∣diately (without farther Thought) decry this Pa∣per, and call it Flattery; but those that will im∣partially judge, must own that Flattery and Truth were never ally'd; and I have said nothing here but what the well-known Merits of the Persons will justify.
May the noble Partner of your Heart live like her Virtues, which were a sufficient Security (if Heaven would suffer her Absence) for an Immor∣tality on Earth: May the Excellencies o both Ge∣nerations wait on you two; may Goodness, Ho∣nour, and Loyalty never depart, from whence they have seem'd to take their Dwelling, but with tha untir'd Sincerity (which your Predecessors have still perform'd to their Soveraign) attend you; whilst I, at a Distance, shall rejoice, and with all Humility crave the Title of,
