MAdam, after all the admired wits of this excellent
age, which haue laboured in the sad complaints of
faire and vnfortunate Rosamond, and by the ex∣cellency
of inuention, haue sounded the depth of her
sundry passions; I present to your Ladiship this Epistle of hers to
King Henry, whom I may rather call her louer then beloued.
Heere must your Ladishippe behold variablenes in resolution;
woes constantly grounded; laments abruptly broken off; much
confidence, no certainty, words begetting teares, teares confoun∣ding
matter, large complaints in little papers; and many defor∣med
cares, in one vniformed Epistle. I striue not to effect singula∣rity,
yet would faine flie imitation, & prostrate mine own wants
to other mens perfections. Your iudiciall eye must modell foorth
what my pen hath layd together, much would she say to a King,
much would I say to a Countesse, but that the methed of my Epi∣stle
must conclude the modesty of hers, which I wish may recom∣mend
my euer vowed seruice to your honour.
