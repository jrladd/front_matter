My Dear,
THE Excellent Author of the following Discourses, wrote them for the only use of his Dear Wife, without any intention of Printing them; but some Friends (obtaining a sight of them in Manuscript) were so delighted with them, and so satisfied with the Philosophy and Reason of them; together with the Scriptural evidences here made use of, (which do clearly reveal and plainly Manifest very





much of the nature of mans future State and Condition) as that they did not only judge them worthy of the Publick view, but making it their earnest re∣quest to him, did (by the Me∣diation of so prevalent a person as his nearest Relation) gain his consent (as he tells us) for the publishing of them.
Dear Heart, I did, sometimes since, Translate them also for your use, and now at your desire, I do suffer them to pass the Press; you have Communicated them to some of your Relations: who think that they may be of great advantage to devout and pious Souls. I do therefore, willingly commit them to your and their Disposal; and if they may pro∣mote, and increase a love to, and a faith in that blessed future State,

which is the Subject of them; I shall most Heartily Rejoyce therein.
I very well know that such subjects are very congruous, suit∣able, and pleasant to your Soul; and it was the knowledge there∣of, that did engage me at some Vacant hours to Translate them. You have Experienced much good already by them; and I doubt not, but they will tend yet further to encrease a passion in you for God and Heaven.
It may be also, that God may bless them to produce the same Effects, upon many others, that shall peruse them.
But as the Author inscribed them to no other Name than Hers, for whose sake he Wrote

them: So I, having made them English for your Use in a Espe∣cial manner; do now make the Dedication of them only to your self; always praying, that God would so bless them to the profit of all that shall Read them, that they (together with us) may be made Partakers of that blessed Inheritance; a clear Map where∣of, is herewith so lively Deline∣ated, and so plainly Exhibited, to our, and their Eyes.
Now the God of peace fill thee (my Dear) with all joy through Believing, which is the Dayly Prayer of, thine,
