Great Sir!
MY Presumption in this Dedication would be Ʋnpardonable, were it not that the Subject Matter of this Book is such, as does particularly Entitle Your Majesty thereunto, and makes it fit for a Prince to Patronie: For it is not only the History of the Lives and Reigns of Your Majesty's Royal Predecessors, but also a Description of Your Majesty's Kingdom of Eng∣land, and Principallity of Wales: A Country that has been Rescu'd by Your Majesty out of the Jaws of those Devouring Monsters, Popery and Slavery, which were ready to swallow it up: 'Twas when the Nation lay Expos'd to the Will and Lust of her Insulting Ravishers, that Your Majesty, as the Guardian Angel of Great Britain, came to her Timely Rescue; Exposing Your Royal Person to the Danger of the Sea in the worst Season of the Year, that You might Save It from impending Ruine. And to whom could the History of England
 be better Dedicated, than to a Prince who has done such Great Things for it? Who has Rais'd it from that Oblivion to which the Supineness of the late Reigns had Reduc'd it, to make the most consi∣derable Figure of any Kingdom in Europe, of which Your Majesty has also again made it the Arbiter: Having Rais'd the Genius of the Na∣tion, by Your Own Heroick Example, above what it was in our Third Edward, or Fifth Henry's Days. 'Tis true indeed, both those Princes obtain'd Great Victories over France; but it was then Weak and Divided; Void of all those Acquisitions that Lewis the 14th has Ʋnjustly Raish'd from his Neighbours: Whereas Your Majesty has Hum∣bled France in the very Zenith of her Glory, when she was Laying the Foundation of an Ʋniversal Monarchy.
But it would be too great a Boldness in so Weak a Pen to attempt any thing in Your Majesty's Just Praise, when even the most Celebrated Writers must fall far short of Performing it as they ought.
That Your Majesty may long Live and Reign, the Terrour of Your Enemies, the Joy of Your Sub∣jests, and the Delight of all Mankind, shall be the daily Prayer of
