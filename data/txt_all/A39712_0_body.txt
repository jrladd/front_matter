Madam,
I Profess to all the world, that Er∣minia is more yours then mine. From you I took the pattern of the Plot; from you the spirit of writing it; nor am I ever more Poet, then when I am with you at Mestham. There, free from the Distractions of the Town, my minde is recollected: there, 'tis at Repose, free from trouble and molestation: and there 'tis chear'd and delighted, with chearful and de∣lightsom company. Your green Walks

are my Parnassus; the Spring or Fountain-head, my Helicon: Nor could all the Muses together, more inspire me, then you alone.
I am most glad then, that amongst my other Heroick Portraits, I made not yours before, that I might do it in a more particular manner now, in that of the Fair and Vertuous Er∣minia: And more particularly de∣clare, how much I honour you; and how much I am,
Madam,
