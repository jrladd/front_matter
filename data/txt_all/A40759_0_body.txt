May it please Your Grace,
THis Discourse was design'd to attend and che∣rish the Publick Devotions of a very Loyal and Worthy Corporation; to which Your Grace has lately vouchsafed to own a Relation, and whose In∣terests You are pleased to Espouse: But it had the Fortune to wait upon Your Grace, likewise, in the same Solemnity, at the Head of an Illustrious Assem∣bly of Persons of Great Honour and Quality; All full of most Dutiful Affections to His Majesty, and Ho∣nourable Thoughts and Veneration of Your Grace.

Coming into the World under such kindly Aspects, and honestly (however weakly) endeavouring to speak out upon an agreeable Argument; it met with a Fa∣vour from Your Grace, bigger than it did aspire to, or could deserve: Which was, to have Your Repeated Commands for its Publication. After this, Duty was to govern and control my Inclination; and it became me, on the first fitting Occasion, to lay It and my Self at Your Grace's Feet. This I now do in all Hu∣mility: Beseeching Your Pardon of my Presumption Herein; Which I am the more encouraged to hope for, when I reflect upon that Great Goodness, and Sweetness of Temper, which in Your Grace is as Emi∣nent, as Your High Authority and most Noble Des∣cent. I am,
My LORD,
