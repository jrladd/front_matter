Mistresse,
BY your faire hand I have made bold,
This little scroll of caution out to hold:
That by the fairnesse of the frontispice,
Many may be induc'd to cast their eyes,
And seing your honoured name, may further look,
To be informed what's within this book.
I doe expect the brand of a black cole,
Cavill, will (if it find none) make an hole.
Me a poore spirited man you might suppose,
Should I affect the suffrages of those.
Let it but in esteem with you prevaile,
And in their Temples it will prove a naile.
They'l blaze but for a while like kitchin-stuff,
And instantly will vanish in a snuffe.
Mistrisse,
