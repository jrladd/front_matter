I Do not question but you will accept of my Cloriana, though she be not set out in her full Lustre and Lan∣guage fiting her Vertues and your Entertainment; yet the onely thing I build on is, that these my poor endeavours are chiefly laid out for to pleasure you, and such as you shall think fit to present it as worthy by your commen∣dation: Who though they may very well ac∣count

your commendations partial, yet it is all my ambition at this time, to dedicate this, the Employment of my idle hours, to your kinde acceptance: which being grant∣ed, it will very much oblige,
