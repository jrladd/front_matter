My Lord,
THough the ensuing Reasons, by the Nature of the Thing, are addressed to the Honourable House of Commons, whereof you are so valuable a Member; It being that Great Council, whose Ʋnited Votes can alone promote with Effect, what is herein humbly offered. Yet, my Lord, by rea∣son this Work is of very great Import, and (as in all such Cases) re∣quires the more time to demonstrate the Value, Ʋsefulness, Neces∣sity and Feaseableness thereof, or otherwise is apt to be neglected or thrown by; Therefore I have taken the boldness to Dedicate the same in particular to your Honour, as a most proper Advocate and Patron, humbly intreating, that as you are a known Publick Spi∣rited Promoter and Encourager of all things tending to the Weal, Safety and Prosperity of the King and Kingdom, so your Honour would be pleased to recommend these Reasons and the Matter Pro∣posed, to that Honourable House, and to improve your Interest to have the same read before them, If after your Perusal, your Honour shall find them worthy of such your Countenance and Approbation; wherein I hope you will do your King, City and Country no inconsi∣derable Service, as well as a very great Honour to,
My Lord,
