GOE! hunt the whiter Ermine! and present
His wealthy skin, as this dayes Tribute sent
To my Endimion's Love; Though she be farre
More gently smooth, more soft than Ermines are!
Goe! climbe that Rock! and when thou there hast found
A Starre, contracted in a Diamond,
Give it Endimion's Love; whose lasting Eyes,
Out-looke the Starry Jewells of the Skies!
Goe! dive into the Southern Sea! and when
Th'ast found (to trouble the nice sight of Men)
A swelling Pearle; and such whose single worth,
Boasts all the wonders which the Seas bring forth;

Give it Endimion's Love! whose ev'ry Teare,
Would more enrich the skillfull Jeweller.
How I command? how slowly they obey?
The churlish Tartar, will no hunt to day:
Nor will that lazy, sallow-Indian strive
To climbe the Rock, nor that dull Negro dive.
Thus Poets like to Kingsâ–ª (by trust deceiv'd)
Give oftner what is heard off, than receiv'd.
