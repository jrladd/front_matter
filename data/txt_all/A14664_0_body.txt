OFten haue I desired some oportu∣nitie of testifying thankfulnesse to you. I haue had many comforts for my body and mind from you. Golde and Siluer haue I none, neither doe I lacke any; and had I, it is a requitall which you need not, nor doe looke after: For God hath well blest your Familie and whole stocke as with the note and credit of Religion, so with encrease both of persons and wealth aboue any (for the number and qualitie) that I know in these parts; but such as I haue I doe giue you. Which is such, as you doe valew aboue all gold and siluer, being the sauing Truth, euen that truth which bringeth to life them that beleeue and practise it. Being therefore moo∣ued vpon some respects to publish an Epitome or

Abridgement of all my doctrines which I euer taught in sixe principles, I thought withal by this occasion to de∣dicate to you these two short Sermons: One the Practise of the Saints, preached at the Funerall of your kinse∣woman Mistres Francis Perker: the other, the Perseue∣rance of the Saints, first copied out at the earnest re∣quest of one of your kinsmen; and therunto haue ioyned two short Treatises of the Sacrament of the Supper; one touching the doctrine thereof, the other touching the du∣tie of Communicants; the one informing the iudgement in the truth of that Mysterie; the second working the af∣fections to a reuerend loue and regard, and to a carefull vse of it. Accept them as poore loue-tokens, pardon my presumption in presenting them vnto the world vnder your names; vse them to your best benefit; and he, whose truth it is, write it in your hearts to your eternall good.
