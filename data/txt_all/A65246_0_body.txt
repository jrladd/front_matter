TO The Honourable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of the Commons House of PARLIAMENT.
The humble Remonstrance and Petition of many of the Citizens of London.
Shewing.
THat ever since the beginning of these present distra∣ctions which threaten ruines to these flourishing Kingdomes, and indeede ever since the sitting of this present Parliament, they have been ready out of their zeale to the cause of God, and sence of their duty to to this Honourable Assembly, upon all occasions to contribute subserve, and lay out themselves in all those wayes, which they did either discerne, or were directed, did tend to the mainte∣nance of that Cause, or were necessary for the defence of the common safety, wherein they have at all times with all cheer∣fulnesse and readinesse, advanced such monies as have bin de∣sired, (in the whole to very great and vast summes) and have levied and raysed amongst them the greatest number of those men, who both first formed and now also recruted the Army.
By all which they hoped to have seen the end of their dan∣gers and removall of their feares, by the just, severe, and ex∣emplary punishment of Delinquents, who are the causes of all these ruining perturbations, and to have been by this time setled in the enjoyment of that happy Peace they have always

desired: but deceived of this hope, they cannot omit humbly to remonstrate, that after all this vast expence, they find them∣selves but little neerer their end, if not more dangerously in∣volved, and like enough to keep those intestine Wars on foot,  they shortly become a prey to forreign force, as late disco∣veries give them cause to feare.
And however they are very sensible of the great burthen of renued contributions, both beyond the example of former times, and their owne expectation of such supplies; yet they shall with the samelife and cheerefulnesse go on to adventure more; so as it may be employed in a more speedy and effectu∣all prosecution of the Warres, which they humbly conceive would not have beene drawne out to this length, had it not bin for giving eare to those counsells of accommodation, a proposition induced by our enemies to gain time, which if concluded, they will keep only so long as to serve their ends, but the very conclusion of it wholly incomptable, as your Re∣monstrants humbly conceive, with the Protestation of bring∣ing to condigne punishment these grand Delinquents, and in∣cendiaries, who have imbroyled our State, and sought to iu∣troduce a tyrannie, without whose counsell and influence nothing on that side can be concluded, and as also the ready way to expend and wast their remaining Treasure, and render them thereby wholly unable to defend themselves.
The contemplation of their emminent danger thereby, in∣forceth them humbly to remonstrate, that if these destru∣ctive counsells of accommodation be re-assumed, they shall think it necessary to look to their own safeties, and forbeare to contribute to their own ruine; to which onely accommo∣dation, and not the greatest force of these enemies of the pub∣lique peace can ever bring; the motion whereof your Remon∣strants beleeve, will be exploded with the greatest indignity

by all the good patriors of your honourable assembly, yet humbly desire you will be pleased to publish such a Declara∣tion herein, as shall seem good to your Wisedomes, whereby not only the people may be assured, that men mis-affected to the publique may not serve their own ends, or drive on their particular designs in this destructive accommodation; but al∣so the Ingenires of these contrivances may lye under the ex∣pectation of a just and heavy censure; if they shall yet by such dangerous and unreasonable interpellations, to bereave us of the right and wholsome use of our advantages and opportu∣nities; by which for the present, besides all other dangerous effects, the Delinquents and Incendiaries are incouraged with the hope of a good retreat, when they have done their utmost.
The sad effects of this accommodation appearing at di∣stance, more terrible unto your Remonstrants then the present view of the worst of this unnaturall war, gives the boldnesse to them, to make this humble addresse to this most honoura∣ble assembly: withall professing that they are resolved with the utmost expense of Lives, and estates to stand by, assist, maintain, and execute all your counsells and command, that shall tend to the vigorous and effectuall prosecution of this Warre.
They therefore humbly pray you will be pleased to declare your Sense against this dangerous accommodation, that being assured of your fixed resolution not to treat with his Majesty, but in parliament, and divided from his wicked and despe∣rate Councellors, they may with the greater resolution bee prepared to go on cheerfully in such supplies, as are necessary to bring these distractions to a happy issue.
For which they shall ever pray, &c.
