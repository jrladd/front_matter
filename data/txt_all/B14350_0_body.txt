THe holie Apostle S. Paule doth plainely teach,Rom. 8.18. that all things fall out for the best vnto them that loue God: which thing, the manifest depar∣ting of many from the fayth, doth suf∣ficiētly confirme: for this defection & falling away from the truth, doth giue vnto the children of God, occasion of a more neare search, & diligent inqui∣rie after the truth, while they haue not satisfied themselues, to set opinion a∣gainst opinion, and perswasion against perswasion: but as the aduersaries of the gospel haue beautified their errors with the best, that their abilitie could a∣foord: so the friends of the same, haue
 from time to tim ade it manifest, that all that beaut was but borowed, & that their dealing therin hath bene such, as is the practice of an impudent woman, who by wearing the heare of another, seeketh the cōmendation of that beautie, which is not her owne: Whereby this gaine hath growne vn∣to the godly: that against temptation, touching the trueth of doctrine: our enimie findeth vs better armed and more sufficiently prouided: in that we haue not onely an opinion, that that which we hold should be true, but can also bring foorth store of argumentes and authorities, aswell for the vphol∣ding of that, as for the ouerthrow of the contrarie. So that, entrance is both wayes denied vnto the enimie.
Moreouer while we see the gospel, cō∣tinually casting out suche huge heapes of Fome and Froth: wee learne, that it cānot be otherwise, but that our selues are to be cast out as scumme, vnles the Gospel shal find fauour with our affec∣tion, aswel as it hath entertainmēt with
 our tongue. For seeing that mōstrous doūghil of Popery, is nothing els, but the sweepings of the Gospel: Howe shoulde not at the leaste experience, which profiteth the dullest heades, in this pointe preuaile with vs? And see∣ing the Gospel keepeth not all that come vnto her: can it be that we shold not godly feare aswell the daunger of our deuorcement from her: as nowe we are ashamed, not to be reputed as those, who bee betrothed vnto her: Now as the wicked (taking more liber∣tie of life, and growing into a greater contempt of al duty, both vnto God and man, by being offēded at the gos∣pel for the breaking out of their wic∣kednesse: whether in opinion or con∣uersation, who haue been brought vp some time in the bosome of the church:) therby doe euidently declare, that they are of the wicked: for vnto the good, all thinges fal out for their good: So do we by getting this gaine of these controuersies in religion, that therby we better both our iudgemēt,
 and our affection towarde the trueth: make it assured, vnto our selues and vnto our owne soules, that wee are of that number that feare the lord, whose propertie it is, euen to gaine great∣ly by that, which bringeth losse vnto many. Let our warines thē be so much the greater, and our paines so muche the more, as the times whereinto we be fallen, do tel vs how hard a matter it is, to keepe vs euen and vpright with our God: and how daungerous: whē we once be trusted with his Gospel, to deale vnfaithfully in our obedience to∣warde the same.
The cause why I haue published this matter, is, for that he, who required my answeare to his Assertions did not vouchesafe for al that after he had re∣ceiued it, so much as once to reade it. Wherevpon diuers haue mooued me, to make that cōmon vnto moe, which founde so small fauour with him, for whose cause it was taken in hand, that seeing himself, would not geue any oc∣casiō, to think my paines wel bestowed,
 in respect of any good done vnto him: yet should it be lawful for others, (the Lorde blessing it) so to profite by oc∣casion of him, as to receiue some fruite of that, which was not doone but at his request, and for him.
These my labours, (how slender so∣euer, in the defence of religion, against Poperie and superstition) I am bolde to offer vnto your worships: princi∣pally because the Lorde hath aduaun∣ced you vnto the greatest worship, that is, to the worshipping of himselfe in spirit and truth, and vnto those minds that beare such good will towards his truth, hath ioyned in like maner armes of great authoritie in your Countrey, to be able to cherish, credit, and main∣taine the same: secondarily to leaue behinde me a perpetuall testimonie, of the duetie and good will, which both in this common respect, and in manie other priuate touching my selfe, I doe beare vnto you. And last of all, that this publique recorde, might become a spurre vnto your further profiting
 and a stay, to keepe you from the dan∣ger of falling away, and not answering vnto the hope and expectation of such a beginning. The Lorde of all maie∣stie and power, continue his graces to∣ward you, that he may haue the prayse, of a continued and complete woorke of mercie in you.
