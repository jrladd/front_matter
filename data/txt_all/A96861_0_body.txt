My Lord,
THough I may seem bold, I am not so blind, but
that I perceive your Lordship taller by the
head than most I can set by you, and so come for
patronage in hopes of a favourable smile, being
sure to have frownes enough from them, who not able to look o∣ver
the heads of others, croud as it were hood-wink'd after those
that goe before them. It was the ancient practice of enslaved
Rome, after death to Deifie her Tyrants, and this her badge
of slavery we in England have long worn as a Livery of our bon∣dage;
whose Kings (when dead) must be of Famous, and
Blessed Memory, though they liv'd most infamous for Cow∣ardize,
and detestable for Tyranny; and though this was acted
to flatter their Successors at first, yet by custome it hath so pre∣vailed,
that notwithstanding the cause is now taken away, the ef∣fect
remains among the multitude (to whom Logick must give
place in their irrationall actings) and from a naturall necessity
is become a divine institution; so that immortall, as earthly

Crownes are givem them Iure Divino, to dye Saints, as they
live Kings: Indeed Rome may have somthing pleaded in her ex∣cuse,
for she had her infernall Gods, whom by sacrifice she endea∣voured
to appease from doing mischief, so little inferiour was her
superstition to her slavery, which was as great as tyranny could
create. I know our royall Idolaters will lay hold of the Horns of
this, De mortuis nil nisi bonum; but it can afford them
little safety, and me lesse danger, whom the Metaphysicks have
taught, that bonum & verum convertuntur, that J can∣not
write good, unlesse J write truth; thus what they have ta∣ken
for their shield, is the dart which pierceth their Liver, and by
what they would ward off, they are smitten with the blow of
high-treason, themselves being the only and grand transgressors
against the majesty of History, whose Prerogative it is not onely
to reward the good, with honour and renown, but also to punish
the evill, with ignominie and reproach. The case standing
thus, I am assured of your Lordships protection, against all
storms such inchantments may raise against me, whose rationall
eye being able to pierce these foggs doth perceive what hath so
long been invelop'd in the mist.
Thus my Lord, having looked aside at selfe, yet I constantly
kept your Lordship in my eye,, and your honour stood fore-right,
my safety but on one side in my choice, not out of presumption that
my weak endeavours could adde any thing to you, but in assu∣rance
that others seeing what profit they have received, what mi∣sery
they have escaped in the book, will return to the Dedication,

and with honour read your name, who have been so great an
iustrumet under God of their deliverance.
God hath chosen you to judge between a King and a people,
and your sentence hath shewn you are sufficiently informed of
what this Discourse treats: yet as a Pharos may be usefull to
delight a man with the prospect of those rocks, shelves, and sands
he hath escaped, to whom it was a sea mark to guide safe in∣to
the Port; so may your Lordship with comfort cast your eye up∣on
the ensuing Discourse, viewing the dangers you and all good
Patriots have past, especially having had so great an hand in
the steerage into the Harbour.
And now give me leave to mention your worthy acts, that
it may be known I am not unmindfull of a good turn, it is the
onely thanks I am able to repay in the behalf of my Conntrey
and self: I know some will be apt to condemne such an action
as savouring of flatterie, but the most free from that vice, the
most severe, the most rigid in the School of vertue, a Cato
himself hath done the like, and that not onely upon the Score of
gratitude, but to encourage and incite to further gallantry, and
the most censorious of them may perchance perceive their own
black Shadows by your light, and from your example take out
a new lesson of duty to their countrey whom they ought to serve
before themselves.
You have undauntedly stood the shock of what ever slavish
malice could bring against you, and have been eminent in vin∣dicating
the right God and nature invested the nation with from

the power of usurping tyranny, no counterfeit rayes, no glitter∣ing
impostures gilded with pretences of sacred, and Majestick
have dazzeled your eyes, but with a steddy and impartiall hand
you have guided the Scale of justice, wherein that bubble of
worldly honour hath been found too light to counterpoise those
sinnes of murder and oppression, which brought such heavy judge∣ments
on the land, whose yoe hath been broken, whose guilt hath
been removed in a great measure, by having justice executed
without respect of persons.
 saith the Philosopher, to do good to one is
honourable, to a nation is heroicall; to perform the first, is the
private mans duty, to be able to do the latter is the publick magi∣strates
divinity. God hath not onely given you power, but a mind
also to employ it well, you have been good as wel as Great, and
God hath preserved you, & honored you in your integrity, of which
we have received such sure signs, that it must argue us more se∣vere
than just, more suspicious than Charitable, but to doubt that
the Honour of God, the good and freedome of your Countrie shall
not still possesse the first part of your affections, and be the ultimate
end in all your actions, that so the goodwill of him that dwelt in
the Bush being with you and your fellow Builders may enable you to
perfect the great work of Reformation to his glory, your own ho∣nours,
and the happinesse and freedome of this nation, all which
are uufeignedly desired by him who craving pardon for this bold
approach as by duty obliged subscribes.
My Lord
