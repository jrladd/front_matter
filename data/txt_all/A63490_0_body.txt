ROYAL SIR,
HOW much the English Name and Na∣tion are obliged to Your Royal High∣ness, the voluntary Exposing of Your Illustrious Life to the most hazzardous and Dreadful of all Combats and Dangers, for their Interest and for their Glory, will be an Eternal Testi∣mony so long as Fame shall be able to celebrate them with her immortal Trumpet; and not to mention that Bravery and Conduct which in a thousand Occasions You have shewn at Land. Those Terrible Actions

upon the British Ocean, whose Thundering Eccho's have transported Your Glory to the remotest Shores, will for ever rank Your Name among the greatest and most famous Captains of the World.
One would think it impossible, that even while the Laurels were yet fresh upon Your Conquering Brow, there should be found any so enviously Malicious, to endeavour to blast them; and with a base Ingratitude, by con∣spiring Your Disgrace, Your Ruin and Destruction so to repay Your Merit, and their Deliverance and Preser∣vation from the Hostile Attempts of Powerful and En∣croaching Neighbours, who by cutting the smews of our Traffique, endeavoured to divest His Majesty of his glorious Inheritance the Sovereignty of the four Seas, and His Subjects of those Riches which Maritime In∣dustry entituled them to.
But this is the natural effect of those Principles of Zealous Separatists, the implacable Enemies not only of Your Royal House and Person but even of the Mo∣narchy it self; and certainly none but such prodigious Monsters whom no Goodness is capable of Obliging, nor Innocence of Escaping, could so suddenly have Ex∣tinguished the Remembrance how freely Your High∣ness had Exposed Your Illustrious Life to Preserve not only the Reputation, but the just Dominion of the Sea to the English Nation, as to be induced contrary to all the Laws of God or Man, and all the Obligations of Duty, Gratitude, and Humanity, to endeavour to Disinherit and Exclude Your Royal Highness, from Your Hereditary Right of Succession, to the Land. And to those who measure them according to their for∣mer

Actions, it will appear no Wonder to find the pre∣sent Dissenters so exactly resembling their Parents and Predecessors in Cruelty, Ingratitude, and Treason; or that they should so violently endeavour to Exclude the Son from the Right of Succession, who so inhu∣manely and barbarously Excluded his Father from the Possession both of his Crown and Life, and our Gra∣cious Sovereign, so long as they had the least Power, from his undoubted Right, the Throne of his Illustrious Ancestours and Predecessours.
But if their endeavours for Exclusion, fill'd the minds of many who did not throughly understand their Design, with surprize and amazement, their late Explanation of themselves, by the infamous Commentary of the most ungenerous Treason, have fill'd their hearts with Hor∣ror and Detestation against such base Actions and Brutish Principles, as lead men under pretence of Religion and Conscience to the most ignominious and Cowardly Vil∣lany of Assassinating Sovereign Princes.
But His Majesty and Your Royal Highness hav∣ing by the immediate Care of Heaven, Escaped these Dangers, as it fills all Loyal Hearts with Dutiful Joy; so it instructs them, from their Danger, of the inseparable Necessity of their Interest and their Duty; and that they ought not only to satisfie themselves with a Passive Loyalty, but to Ʋse their most Active En∣deavours to contribute what lies in their Power, to Se∣cure the Publique Peace, and support the Govern∣ment. And as it is the Interest so it is the Glory of the Church of England, that She hath not the least blemish of Disloyalty in Her Beautiful Face, but that

Her Fidelity to the Crown hath been Tryed to the Ʋttermost, and She hath Constantly endeavoured to sup∣press the Growth and Progress of these Fatal Principles, Destructive of all that is Great and Good, and for my own particular, as I esteem it my greatest Honour to be one of Her meanest Servants, so I look upon it as my chief∣est Glory, if I can be capable of doing any Services against these Wicked and Dangerous Principles, which may in∣cline Your Highness to pardon the presumption of this Ad∣dress, and the Ambition of avowing my self,
Great Sir,
