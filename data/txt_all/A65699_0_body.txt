May it please your Grace.
IT is the Custom of the Adver∣saries of our Church to thrust out their Errors into the World, under some great name; that by the Protection of some honorable Person, to whom they Dedicate their Books, they may render them
more plausible in the Eye of the World, and add greater weight and Authority to their gross Fal∣shoods.
My Lord, We live in such an age, in which Truth stands in greater need of a Patron than Falshood it self: and though this little poor Treatise be not worthy to bear your great name in the front, yet the Truth I here defend, will I doubt not, be owned and supported by your Grace; whose great design in this World is to support the Church of England. 'Tis the same Faith, and the same Doctrin I here deliver which your Glorious Predecessors in both your Sees of Canterbury, and London; Cranmer and Ridley owned and asserted even unto Blood. 'Tis a defence of that great learned man, who has made it his business, now
for some years, to defend the Writings of the renowned Archbishop Laud; for whose memory and wri∣tings you have often expressed so great Veneration. These conside∣tions are enough alone to prove the fitness of this address. But besides these, your Grace may justly chal∣lenge the labours of all your own Ʋniversity; You have obliged them to that degree, that the Gifts of half their Benefactors, amassed into one summe, would scarce equal your famous Theatre. And as they fail not to give God thanks for so great a Patron, at the times of publick solemnity, so am I under the same Obligation, for that support you bestowed on me for some years to∣gether, whilest I was a member of Trinity Colledge, and before I had the happiness and honor to be rela∣ted
to my Lord of Sarum. Who∣soever knows this, will certainly ex∣cuse my boldness: and if to make this address be impudence; yet not to have done it, would have been ingratitude.
