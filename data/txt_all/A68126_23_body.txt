NO lesse than a yeere and a halfe is past (Re∣uerend, Deare, and Holy Mother) since J wrote a louing monitorie Letter toSmith and Robinson. two of thine vnworthy Sons; which (I heard) were fled from thee in person, in affection, and somewhat in opinion: Supposing them yet thine in the maine substance, though in some circumstances their owne. Since which, one of them hath washt off thy Font-water as vncleane, and hath written desperatly both against Thee and his owne fellowes: From the other, J receiued (not two moneths since) a stomack-full Pamphlet; besides the priuate iniuries to the Monitor, ca∣sting vpon thine honourable Name blasphemous imputations of Apostasie, Antichristianisme, Whoredome, Rebellion: Mine owne
 wrongs I could haue contemned in silence;Meam iniuri∣am patienter tuli: impieta∣tem contra Sponsam Christi ferre non potui, Hieron. ad Vi∣gilant. but, For Sions sake, J cannot hold my peace: Jf I remember not thee, O Ierusalem, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth. It were a shame and sinne for me, that my zeale should be lesse hot for thine in∣nocencie, than theirs to thy false disgrace. How haue J hastened therefore to let the World see thy sincere Truth, and their per∣uerse slanders! Ʋnto thy sacred Name then (whereto J haue in all pietie deuoted my selfe) I humbly present this my speedie and dutifull labour: whereby I hope thy weake Sonnes may bee confirmed, the strong encouraged, the rebellious shamed: And if any shall still obstinatly accurse thee, I refer their reuenge vnto thy Glorious Head, who hath espoused thee to himselfe, in Truth and righteousnesse: Let him whose thou art, right thee: In the meane time, we thy true sonnes shall not only defend, but magni∣fie thee: Thou maist be blacke, but thou art comely: the Daugh∣ters haue seene thee, and counted thee blessed; euen the Queene, and the Concubines, and they haue praised thee: thou art thy Welbeloueds, and his desire is towards thee. So let it be, and so let thine be towards him for euer; and mine towards you both, who am the least of all thy little Ones.
