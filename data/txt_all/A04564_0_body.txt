BEING not altogether
(right honorable) vnac∣quainted
with the fame
of this wel gouerned ci∣tie,
the heade of our
English florishing com∣mon
wealth: I thought
nothing (considering it somewhat tou∣ched
my dutie) could be more accepta∣ble
to your Honour, then such principles
as first grounded the same as well by do∣mesticall
policie of peace, as forraine ex∣cellence
in resolution of warre. This cau∣sed
me to collect from our London gar∣dens,
such especiall flowers, that sauoured
as well in the wrath of Winter, as in the
pride of Sommer, keeping one equiuo∣lence
at all kinde of seasons. Flowers of
chiualrie (right honorable I meane) some
that haue sucked honie frō the Bee, sweet∣nesse

from warre, and were possessed in
that high place of prudence, wherof your
Lordship now partaketh. Other some that
haue beene more inferiour members, and
yet haue giuen especial ayde to the head,
beene buckler to the best, and therby rea∣ched
to the aspiring toppe of armes: If
your Lordship shall but like of it, procee∣ding
from the barren braine of a poore
apprentice, that dare not promise moul∣hils,
much lesse mountaines, I shall thinke
this by-exercise, which I vndertooke to
expell idlenesse, a worke of worth, what∣soeuer
the gentle cauld kind, that are vn∣gently
inkindled, shall with ostentation
inueigh. These (right Honorable) the nine
VVorthies of London, now vnable to defend
themselues, seeke their protection vnder
your gracious fauour: and the Authour
pricked on by Fame, to be patronagde for
his willing labour, whereof not misdoub∣ting,
I humbly commit your Honour to
the defence of heauen, and the guider of
all iust equalitie:
