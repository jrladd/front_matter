TO all you zealous snufflers through the Nose,
I dedicate this Posie in Verse and Prose,
Smell out and spare not, for from thence
More savour comes, then your New Reforâˆ£mation. surreverence;
Be you Presbyter or Independent,
Rebell or Traytor, 'tis to you I send it;
You, whose edifying Noses can smell Plots
Betwixt Langdale, and your Bretheren Scots,
For which Malignant Reprobates doe say,
You voted have a new Thanksgiving-day:
Praise God for this too, turne up your goggle eyes,
Then smell to your proud treasonous sacrifice;
I offer this too, for your bretherens good,
Written as your Religion is, in blood
Of Innocents whose sad and dying groanes
Make the earth tremble, rends the rocks and stones,
Piercing the Heavens, doth for swift vengeance call
So loud, ere long it will confound you all:


Whilst you give thankes for blood and murdering
Ile sing, the glories of a gracious King.
