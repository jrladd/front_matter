WHEN I was (as you are) a Young Man, it pleased God to put into my heart an earnest desire to seek the Welfare of that Generation, who are now past their Youth. From thence it was that I Published the last Sermons of my Brother ELEAZER MATHER (who rested from his Labours above Five & Twenty Years since) which were then designed for the benefit of the Young Generation: From thence also it was, that I did both Preach and Print that Call to the Rising Generation; several Editions whereof have been dispersed and disposed of; I hope not altogether with∣out some fruit. GOD having lengthned my days to see many of the third Generation standing thick upon the Stage, As my beloved Sons let me warn you.
It has been Observed, that when the Lord i about to remove His Servants, He doth by a
secret Providence incline their hearts to speak something which may concern those that shall live after they are gone: So it has hapned to several near Relations of mine: So my Bro∣ther, but now mentioned: So my Father (whose Memory is blessed) a little before his death Preached many Sermons on Davids dying charge to his Son Solomon. I have more reason  I shall express, to believe that my Opportunities of Serving any (and in special You the Young Generation) in New-England, are very near unto their end. And I have therefore been the more willing to put this into your hands, that so I might thereby speak, when I shall be seen no more amongst you. In the mean time, I can never cease desiring, and (so far as I am Capa∣ble) Endeavouring your SALVATION. I beseech you Remember that it lies with you, whether the LORD shall Continue to be the GOD of New-England. The most of you are Children desended from Godly Parents: For∣sake not your Fathers God and Friend; and you shall never be forsaken by Him.
