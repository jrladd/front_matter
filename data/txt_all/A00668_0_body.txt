RIght hono∣rable, I am inioyned, by that re∣uerend authority which in al duty I stand bound to obey, to publish
 these small endeuors: which albeit they may passe inuisibly vnregar∣ded of the meanest, be∣cause they are so small; yet the subiect requi∣reth the Patronage of the most honourable. Not that it is a contro∣uersie (for amongst wri∣ters I finde not mine ad∣uersarie) but because if actions interpret mens minds, the most part of the world be against me. Such is our conflict
 while we vse the sword of the spirit. Manie re∣spects haue mooued and incouraged me to craue your Lordships Patronage. Your inte∣gritie, who I persuade my soule may safelie wash your handes of these spoiles. Your ho∣norable place and au∣thoritie, in whose pow∣er it is to cherish the tribe of Leui, and pro∣tect a great part of our bodie. Your loue and
 affection extending it selfe to manie woorthie members of the same. My duty, your vnwor∣thie Chaplaine, who if I should signifie to the world what incourage∣ments I haue receaued from your Honour, it might seeme in mee ostentation, as if I de∣serued somwhat. Then let that fauorable coun∣tenance which hath e∣uer shined vpon Scho∣lars, vouchsafe the ac∣ceptance
 of a simple Scholars mite, for want of larger offrings. Ac∣cept this little testimo∣nie of my greater de∣sires, who shall neuer cease to offer vp praiers vnto God for all such blessings & happinesse vpon you, and your honourable family on earth, as may bee vn∣doubted fore-runners of your heauenly blisse.
