SIR,
I Very much congratulate this occasion, though
I readily acknowledge, that this poor Present
brings small advantage to any, but him that gives
it; who gains thereby the opportunity of publickly
owning those great respects he shall alwayes pay
your name, and of setting his hand to a paper, as a
voluntary surrendry to you, of all his good Wishes,
and Services. If the Treat he provided be not so
well drest, or serv'd up, as it ought to be, pray let
him beg pardon, with that common, yet necessary
excuse of a young House-keeper, one not well set∣tled,
and scarce with any thing in readiness. Sup∣pose
his Garden newly planted, very little, or no
fruit to be expected the first year, and the unexperi∣enced
Planter, not as yet well skill'd, in keeping off
the cold winds, and nipping Frosts; howsoever he
intreats you to receive what he has rais'd, and to eat
kindly of his first-fruits, with which the greatest
men have been alwayes pleased, and Heaven claims
them before other off rings.

Now dear Sir, as I once lov'd you with your
other Brothers, so those hopeful Gentlemen being
dead, I will center my good wishes on you; may you
joyn their virtues and sweetness to your own, may
you be one fo all, to your Relations, and Friends,
and may you like your excellent Father, be as emi∣nently
concern'd in the World, and as honourably
prais'd by it, to the great satisfaction of
Sir,
