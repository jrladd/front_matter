I Holde it but right & iustice (Honorable Lord, and you the rest of this Polliti∣que bodie) to giue you that which you haue best deser∣ued: to wit, a true taste of that dayes sollemne Triumphe (in honor of so hopefull a Prince) and wherein your

great loue appeared not a little. Your time for preparation was verie short, and mine, for your seruice, much shorter: yet (of mine owne knowledge) bothe of them were verie Royally and gratefully accepted, which J am sure was all your chiefest expectation, and, then which, nothing could be more de∣sired by my selfe. Accepte then your owne, and me at your continuall seruice.
