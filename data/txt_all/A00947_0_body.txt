MOst gracious
Soueraigne,
beeyng em∣ployed
in
your Maie∣sties
seruice
to the Em∣perour
of Russia, I obserued the
State, and manners of that Coun∣trey.
And hauing reduced the
same into some order, by the
way as I returned, I haue presu∣med
to offer it in this smal Booke
to your most excellent Maiestie.
My meaning was to note thinges
for mine owne experience, of
more importaunce then delight,
and rather true then strange. In

their maner of gouernment, your
Highnesse may see both: A true
and strange face of a Tyrannical state,
(most vnlike to your own) with∣out
true knowledge of GOD,
without written Lawe, without
common iustice: saue that which
proceedeth from their Speaking
Lawe, to wit, the Magistrate who
hath most neede of a Lawe, to re∣straine
his owne iniustice. The
practise hereof as it is heauy, and
grieuous to the poore oppressed
people, that liue within those
Countreyes: so it may giue iust
cause to my selfe, and other your
Maiesties faithfull subiects, to ac∣knowledge
our happines on this
behalfe, and to giue God thankes
for your Maiesties most Prince∣like,
and gracious gouernment: as

also to your Highnesse more ioy,
and contentment in your royall
estate, in that you are a Prince of
subiectes, not of slaues, that are
kept within duetie by loue, not
by feare. The Almightie stil blesse
your Highnes with a most long,
and happy reigne in this life,
and with Christ Iesus in
the life to come.
