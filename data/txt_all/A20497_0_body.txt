SIR,
IT is ones pro∣per right to challenge that for his due, for whose sake, and at whose commaundement is was first vndertaken: which being granted, this can rightly belong to none but your self, from whom it first sprng, & at whose

desire it was first vnderta∣ken. I can promise no∣thing in the behalfe of it, but as at the first it was the worke of your will, so now I referre it to your iudgement. This good office at the least it will performe, eyther put you in mind of that you knew before, or else confirme you in that opiniō, wher∣in I assure my selfe you are already setled; if it per∣forme any thing more, I shall attribute it rather to your good nature, and o∣pinion, then to any effica∣cie in it selfe. But howso∣euer it is, I cōmit it to you

as that which is brought forth vnder you protecti∣on. Thus wishing but my abilitie answerable to my will, that I might do you seruice, I commit this to you, and you to the Almigh∣tie.
