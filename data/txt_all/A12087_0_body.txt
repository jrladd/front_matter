Reverend SIR:
THe Meditations here in this Treatise pre∣sented to you, are at their highest pitch of ambition, if they may obtaine, that your judicious eyes (at your con∣venient

leasure) shall passe over them. I suppose, it will be asked why they solicit you rather then any other, for this favour. It is, first for your many yeares with which GOD hath crowned you: and then also in respect of your experience in your owne particu∣lar, of what in this Tract is deli∣ver'd: that is, of GODS free∣ing this age from the Imputations cast (in a generality) upon it: and his deyning you above many others, the blessed and comforta∣ble priviledges, of which it is ca∣pable, and for which it hath the best helps, and most opportunities. I desire not to be made knowne un∣to you. It sufficeth, that to me you

are well knowne: and hat, not by heare-say (though with that pre∣tious ointment, a good-name Eccles 7. you are renowned) but cheefely out of my many obser∣vations, when I was a Student in the Vniversity, and for a long time, one of your Auditors. Eve∣ry way you ratifie and make good this Encomium SENECTV∣TIS. And therefore yours it is, and to you it comes, both to bee corrected and disposed of, incase it may seeme in any degree, wor∣thy your so much paines. And cer∣tainely, should I cause my thoughts to range abroad among the Wor∣thies that are knowne unto me; none would be found that might

give so ample testimonie to what you shall heere reade, or be so li∣ving an example of it, as your selfe. This (I hope) will excuse my presumption, and prevaile with you for your paines in rea∣ding the Discourse, though it should not with your judgement for approving it. I beseech the ANCIENT OF DAIES, to continue and increase unto you, the good your many yeeres have possessed you of; that as they are found in the way of righteousnes, so they may be to you a crowne of glory, Prov. 16. and a crowne of righteousnesse, 2 Tim. 4▪
