My Lord,
THese Sermons ha∣ving been, many of them, preach'd be∣fore his Majesty in the Isles of Scilley and Jarsey,
 and much approved and acce∣pted of by him, I cannot think to whom they may be more welcome, under that qualifi∣cation, than to Your Lordship; Your Goodness likewise gi∣ving me a confidence of Your Acceptance, Your Greatness of their protection. That is not only known, but admired too by all that indeed know you; This, as I long since had the good fortune luckily to fore∣tel, so I do now most hear∣tily congratulate. Nor had I need to erect any other scheme for this prognostick than that of Your own Countenance,
— vultus portendebat honores, When You were yet young, the traits of Honour were there fairly visible to any dis∣cerning Eye, which now by the accession of His Majesties favour are grown so eminent, that he that runs may read Your yet increasing Grandeur and Felicity. May Heaven add its blessing to all your En∣joyments here, and prepare for You hereafter such as Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to con∣ceive. These, My Lord, as
 they are my earnest wishes, so they are my real hopes; for the accomplishment whereof his Prayers shall uncessantly be poured forth, who humbly begs leave to subscribe him∣self,
My Lord,
