Sir,
AMong all the Creatures God hath
made (Devils only excepted)
Man is the most apt and able to
be his own tormentor; and of all
the Scourges with which he lasheth and af∣flicteth
both his Mind and Body, none is
found so cruel and intolerable as his own
fears. The worse the times are like to be,
the more need the mind hath of succour
and encouragement, to confirm and forti∣fie
it for hard encounters, but from the
worst prospect, Fear inflicts the deepest and
most dangerous wounds upon the mind of
man, cutting the very nerves of its passive
fortitude and bearing ability.

The grief we suer from Evil felt,
would be light and easie, were it not in∣censed
by Fear; Reason would do much,
and Religion more, to demulce and lenifie
our sorrows, did not Fear betray the suc∣cours
of both. And it is from things to
come that this prospecting Creature raiseth
up to himself vast Hopes, and Fears; If
he have a fair and encouraging Prospect of
Serene and prosperous day, from the
Scheme and Position of second causes, Hope
immediately fills his heart with cheariness,
and displaies the signals of it in his very
face, answerable to that fair benign Aspect
of things; but if the face of things to
come be threatning and inauspicious, Fear
gains the Ascendant over the mind, a
unmanly and unchristian faintness pervades
it, and among the many other mischiefs it
inflicts, this is not the least; that it brings
the evil of to morrow upon to day, and
so makes the duties of to day wholly unser∣viceable
to the evils of to morrow; which
is much as if a man having an intricate
and difficult business cut out for the next
day, which requires the utmost intention
both of his Mind and Body, and (haply
might be prosperously managed if both were
duly prepared) should lie all the night

restless and disquieted about the event,
torturing and spending himself with his
own presaging Fears, so that when the day
is come, and the business calls for him; his
strength is no way equal to the burden of it,
but he faints and fails under it.
There is indeed an excellent use that God
makes of our Fears to stimulate our sloth∣ful
hearts to greater vigilance, and prepara∣tion
for evils, and there is a mischievous
use Satan makes of our Fears, to cast us
under Despondency and vnbecoming Pusilla∣nimity;
and I reckon it one of the great
difficulties of Religion to cut by a thred
here, and so to manage our selves under
threatning or doubtful Providences, as to
be touched with so much sense of those ap∣proaching
evils, as may prepare us to bear
them; and yet to enjoy that constancy and
firmness of mind in the worst times, that
may answer the excellent principles we are
professedly governed by.
These last times are certainly the most
perillous times; great things are yet to be
acted upon the Stage of this World before
it be taken down, and the Scena ante∣penultima,
latter end, I say not the

last, will be a Tragedy. There is an
Ultima clades adhuc metuenda, a dismal
slaughter of the Witnesses of Christ, yet
to be expected: the last bite of the cruel
Beast will be deadly, and if we flatter not
our selves, all things seem to be disposing
themselves in the Course of Providence to∣words
it.
But Sir, if our Vnion with Christ be
sure in it self, and sure to us also; if Faith
give us the daily visions and Praelibations
of the World to come, what well composed
Spectators shall we be of these Tragedies!
Let things be tossed Susque, deque, and
the Mountains cast into the midst of the
Sea, yet then the assured Christian may
sing his Song upon Alamoth▪
A Song composed for God's hid∣den
ones.Psal. 46. This so poiseth and
steddies the mind, that we may enjoy the
comfort and tranquillity of a resigned will▪
when others are at their wits end.
With design to promote this blessed
frame in my own and others hearts in these
frightful times, I meditated, and now pub∣lish
this small Tract, to which a dear
friend (from whom I have often had the

fair Idea and Character of your excellent
Spirit) hath occasioned the prefixing of
your worthy Name; I beg pardon for such
an unusual presumption, as also your cha∣rity
in censuring the faults that will ap∣pear
in it, when it shall come under so ex∣act
and judicious an eye; it may be use∣ful,
though it be not elegant; its season∣ableness
is its best commendation, and its
aim better than its performance. As for
you Sir, I hope Faith hath really placed
your Soul in that Serene and happy station
where Seneca fancied Moral Virtue to have
placed a good man, Fatendum est, cacu∣mine
Olympi constitutus, supra ventos &
procellas, & omnes res humanas. Above
the Storms and Tempests of this unquiet
and distracting World; but there are ma∣ny
gracious persons, at this day, labouring
under their own Fears, and whose hearts
are ready to fail with looking for those things
that are coming to try them that dwell
upon the Earth; and possibly somewhat of
relief may be administred to many such
by this discourse: Some bivious and stag∣gering
Souls may be established; some dis∣couraged
and fainting Spirits may be re∣vived;
some doubts may be dissolved that
have long perplexed gracious 

Whatever use it may be of to any, I hum∣bly
call in the aid of your Prayers to my
own, for a special blessing upon it, and re∣mains,
Sir,
