FOr as much (Right vvorship∣full) as I finde in sundry histo¦ries of antiquitie, of the thāk¦fulnes of diuers kindes of bea∣stes (vvhich vvant reason and vnderstanding) shovved vnto their Be¦nefactors, and for that I vvere very lothe to be included in the number of vnthankfull Creatures: I haue therfore presumed by this little trifle, vpon the curteous inclination of your gentle nature vvhich to all men is ap∣parant, to shovve my self to be an other poore Sinatas vvhose good vvil and thank∣fullnes in hart and minde, I trust you vvil vvay asvvel in a drop of svveet running vvater as if it vvere a gift of some precious or more greater value. For as I remem¦ber Erasmus in his vvittie Appothegmes
 saith that, Donum quodcunque dat aliquis, proba: & Munerum animus est optimus.
But paraduenture your vvorship vvil mer∣uail vvhy I (beīg one of small or no vnder∣standing) haue attempted to put my Pen to the paper to vvrite of a more vvaightyer matter thē my vvittes or learning are able to attaine vnto. The trueth is though I ne∣uer vvent further then a little in the Gram∣mer Schole (yet by common experience, read∣ing of bookes, and mine ovvne industry and trauel) I haue conceiued some thing. For vvhen I consider the sundry mischaunces of fickle Fortune (if any such thing there be:) the miserable estate of mankinde, novv puffed vp in Pompe of all Pleasures, novv throvvne dovvn into the dungion of all do¦lors, anon commeth a flovving flud, by and by a lovve eb vvater: so that the vncertain¦tie of this vaine fleeting life may be vvell compared to a violent flood, vvhich is quick in rysing, svvift and troublesome to passouer, induring but for a vvhile in one condition and certentie. VVherfore these (as the first
 frutes of my good vvil vvhat soeuer they be) I haue dedicated to your vvoorships Patro∣nage, vnder vvhose Sheeld of defence a num¦ber of afflicted members haue sure sauegard, and gentle refuge, amongst vvhome I am one, vvho am bound by double dutie & vvil be prest (if seruice by hand or hart may doo any thing) to you and yours for euer.
But for asmuch as the hugenes of the head defaseth a little slender body, and a tedious tale may breed some offence, & lest in length¦ning myne Epistle I should disgrace that small thing vvhich follovveth, heer in breef I vvil end, remem∣bring that a little Musicque to the heauy hart is often found more delight∣full and pleasant then a great deal of vntu∣nable me∣lody.
