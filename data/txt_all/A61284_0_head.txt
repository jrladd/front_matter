To the most worthy my well beloved, and dear Relations in the Lord, of the Con∣gregational Churches, both Officers and Members; whom I humbly crave to Pa∣tronize this small and mean Treatise, for whose sake I chiefly formed it, and for whose benefit I now present it; For whom I can do no less but wish all increase of Grace, and fulness of Peace; and as a further Duty and Obligation, to pray and intercede for your Perfection.
