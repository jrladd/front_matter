SIr, it is a custom amōg the best minds, to cal their thoughts daily to account, to whom and in what they are behol∣ding, which considered, they fall next to the endeuour of desert, and last of all into a hate of themselues, if they performe not something, wherin they are seen to be themselues: now, finding my selfe so much bound to your vndeserued fauours, that I cannot auoid Ingratitude, to bury them in obliuion, I haue a∣waked my dull spiit to salute your kindnesse, with this token of my loue: wherein you shall finde a matter of more worth then I am worthy to meddle with, hand∣ld in Diologue-wise, betwixt three Philosophers: in which, vnde the Title of the Dignitie or Indignitie of Man, are discoursed many necessary points to be cons∣dred of▪ as well for the outward as the inward parts; wherin it may be you shall finde pleasant wittes speake

to some purpose, no Machauilian pollicies, nor yet idle fables, no straunge Riddles, nor vaine libelling ballades, but quicke spirits whetting their braines, to shewe the edge of their inuentions: and not to be tedious in my Preface before you come to the matter, you shall finde in summe, that true worth, wherin lieth the whole mat∣ter, that only maketh the worthie or vnworthie man, and the due glorie vnto God, who is only worthie of all honour, & of all men: the greatest part of this booke was in Italian, dedicated to a man of much esteeme, in the Dukedome of Florence, and this booke in this our Lan∣guage, I haue thought good here in England, to present to your worthinesse, of a better worke, in this her Ma∣iesties Royall Tower of London: in which, as by your continuall trauels in your place, you doubtlesse deserue no lesse gracious regarde of the greatest, then account with the wisest; so would I be glad by the due fruite of my thankfulnesse, of your selfe, and men of your worth, to be worthily thought honest. In assured hope where∣of, leauing my booke to your kinde acceptation, and my loue to your like account, I rest.
