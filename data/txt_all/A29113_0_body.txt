Most gracious & dread Soveraign,
TO your sacred hand & view I humbly offer this little peiee, because your Majesty is in some sort concerned in it; I know your Majesty hath little time to read books, but there are some books which both for the usefulnes of the subject & matter which they treat of, and for the smoothnes of the style & language they are cloth'd with, are both pleasant & pro∣fitable, and so the reading of them is but a stu∣dious recreation, and such is this at least in one of these respects, and it is but a little one, it took not up above two dayes in the writing of it, lsse then one hours time in the reading

of it will dispatch it, and I humbly beseech your Majesty that you would bestow upon it those few minutes, that you will be pleased to read it and that you would read it through, and that you would read it your selfe, for there are some things in it which perhaps there are many that are not willing your Majesty should be acquain∣ted with, and therefore against such I hum∣bly beg your Majesties protection, howsoe∣ver I shall keep my self within the bounds of truth & sobernes, and if I do disserve any of them it shall be in order to the serving of your Majesty, which when I can do no way else, I shall supply with my prayers publike and private for all the blessings which may make your Majesty happy both here on earth, and eternally hereafter in heaven. Amen.
