THere came of late to my hands, (right vvor¦shipfull) a discours of the seueral & sundrye customes, and manners of diuers nations, which are founde to inhabite in the North, in the North East, and in
 the East partes of the worlde, &c. Collected and written by a certaine learned man called Francisco Tha∣mara, a reader in Spayne, in the citie of Cadiz, and dedicated by him to the moste excellent Lorde, Don Iohn Claros de Guzman Earle of Niebla, and inheriter of the duke∣dome and estate of Medina Cido∣nia: And vnderstanding the pur∣pose of your worthie enterprise, for the discouerie of the passages by sea to all those regions of the North, and Northeast, &c. for very great zeale I beare to you, and of desire I had to farther you in so famous an enter∣prise, I tooke the translation of the same worke in hande, and bestowed the same in writing on such as you sent in the sayde discouerie in your two Pinesses, late sent forth, that fal∣ling on those coastes, foreknowing the natures of those people, they
 might the better shunne perilles, and on the other side take the benefite of the place the better. And nowe ha∣uing thought good to committ the same to print, and to dedicate the same to your worships, that eache of you may be partaker of the contents, praying you to accept of my small trauell, & good meaning, and to take the same in good parte, wishing that I were more able to do you pleasure or seruice, to the furtherance of so noble an enterprise: since the same tendeth to the ample vent of our cloth, and other our commodities of England, to the increase of our nauie, to the supply of sundry our wants, and to the annoy of the mor∣tall enemies of this kingdome, wher∣by you shal please God, purchace the prayer of the poore, and not offende any one or other honest person of the realme, and so I commit your
 worships to God, wishing the moste happy successe that is to be wi∣shed.
From London this xv. of Iuly. 1580.
