SIR,
BEing come with your Majesty's Ap∣probation, and by Permission of my King, of his Electoral High∣ness of Baevaria, and of my Supe∣riours, into these happy Provinces of Hol∣land, in order to publish an Account of our great Discovery; I hope that since Your Majesty did me the Honour to re∣ceive the First Volume, You will also be graciously pleas'd to accept of this Conti∣nuation, which I presume to lay at Your Majesty's Feet.
I relate in it the Voyages of a Man, whom I have accompany'd for several Years in America, and whose sudden Death, oc∣casion'd by the Fury of his own Soldiers, prevented the Designs he had upon the Mines of St. Barbe in New Mexico. The Observations I make upon this last Voyage

will shew to Posterity, that a Man must ne∣ver be ungrateful to his Friends: and that in imitation of Your Majesty, we never ought to be reveng'd of our Enemies any farther than it concerns the Publick Good, which should always prevail over a private Interest. This Maxim, GREAT SIR, is the distinguishing Character of Your most Illustrious House of Nassau, which has heretofore fill'd the Imperial Throne, whose Triumphs you pursue in the Field of Honour and Glory, and which we now see vested with Sovereign Authority over Three great Kingdoms in Your Majesty's Royal Person.
SIR, All the Universe does avow, that by a Concurrence of Nature and Grace, a perfect Idea of all the Christian, Politick, and Military Virtues of Your Ancestors, is happily reconcil'd in Your Majesty's Per∣son. I mean the Sublimity and Extensive∣ness of an Universal Genius, in which no∣thing appears but what's Noble and Great; a Heart Magnificent and Bountiful, so wor∣thy of Your Majesty's Birth; a Temper ever good and kind, even to Your own Enemies; a winning Sweetness which gives a free and easie Access to Your Majesty; a Greatness of Soul, which alone has suppor∣ted You in all the Changes of Fortune; in which You have shew'd Your Valour, Ju∣stice,

and Uprightness; an Evenness of Temper both in Prosperity and Adversity; and a Mind full of Piety, always Superiour by Courage and Resolution. All these, SIR, are the Paramount Qualities which have been, as it were, the Soul of Your Majesty's Conduct in the Management of Publick Interest, ever since two and twen∣ty Years of Age, when You begun, GREAT PRINCE, to shew Your self at the Head of Armies; and freed these Potent States of Holland from a fo∣reign Yoke; giving every where signal Proofs of Your Valour, and of the deep∣est Wisdom of the greatest General of our Age; appearing even then, like a Tre loaden with Fruit in the Spring, that pro∣mises still a greater Crop in the Au∣tumn.
Never did any Prince know better how to soften the Humour of so many different Nations; manage their several Interests; watch their Designs; dissipate their Facti∣ons; fix the Instability of stirring, restless Minds; and create at once in them both Love and Fear, Obedience and Respect: So that during the Presence or Absence of Your Majesty, no Man ever durst make any Rupture among Your Subjects, altho' they have been powerfully sollicited to it by Your dreadful Enemies.
All these Advantages, SIR, have been gain'd without Effusion of Blood in Your Dominions, and therefore they are only owing to Your Majesty's Wisdom and Vi∣gilance, and those great Blessings which GOD has been pleas'd to bestow on the Uprightness of Your Intentions; His only Honour having been the Chief Spring of Your Majesty's judicious Conduct, without the least regard to Your private Interest. If GOD Almighty, SIR, has permitted that so Just, so Equal, and Peaceful Con∣duct should be obscur'd by some interpo∣sing Clouds, through the wicked Designs of some disaffected Persons; 'tis only the better to establish the solid Merit of Your shining Virtues, heighten Your Glory with a new Lustre, and give an Opportunity to all the High Allies of expressing publickly their Approbation of Your Majesty's Wis∣dom. GOD Almighty had also reserv'd to Your Majesty the greatest Share in the Honour of saving Europe from being rui∣ned in the Present Wars, after You had so happily contributed to dispose all things for a lasting Peace, for which all the World will be eternally oblig'd to Your Majesty.
Your Glory, SIR, shines with so bright a Lustre, that it will never be in Your Enemies Power to obscure it. We behold every Year Your Majesty at the Head of

Your own Armies, and those of the other Potentates Your Allies, toiling for the Li∣berty of Europe, which was ready to be oppress'd. You maintain the good Under∣standing which makes the Strength of their great, long, and unparallel'd Union, and which alone can keep so many Countries from falling under a foreign Yoke.
Your Wisdom like that of Caesar, Your Valour which surpasses that of Alexander, and Your rare Prudence, SIR, whereby like another Annibal, You lead those great Armies in so admirable a Manner, keep up that Glorious Alliance, and will give it a happy issue for the Tranquillity of droop∣ing and exhausted Europe.
GREAT SIR, Providence that over∣rules the Universe, and entertains the Or∣der and Beauty of this great World, amidst the Changes and Revolutions which conti∣nually alter its Face, has rais'd Your Ma∣jesty, and plac'd You at the Head of Three Powerful Kingdoms, that whilst You pro∣mote the Good of Your own Subjects, You may at the same time procure the Felicity of Europe, and deliver its several Nations from this dismal and bloody War.
SIR, I beg Your Majesty's Pardon, for presuming to take this Occasion to com∣plain to You of some private Persons of this City, who though professing the same

Religion as I do in outward appearance, industriously endeavour to render me odi∣ous, and defame me among the simple un∣der the colourable Pretence, That a Fran∣ciscan Friar prints in this City Two Vo∣lumes dedicated to Your Majesty, of the History of the great Discovery I have made in the Northern America.
Yet since I do it with Your Majesty's gracious Approbation, and by Permission of the High and Mighty States of this Pro∣vince, those Persons do not reverence as they should, the sacred Authority of Your Majesty, and the Protection You were pleas'd to grant me, no more than the Honour which their Lordships have done me.
Those Persons now prejudic'd by Passi∣on and Interest, will one day acknowledge their own Errour. I have no other Aim in what I do, than to promote GOD's Glo∣ry, and to go under Your Majesty's Com∣mands to view the new Passage to China and Iapan, so often attempted by the Eng∣lish and Dutch through the Frozen Sea, in order to avoid going twice over the Line, which is so tedious and troublesome. I hope, SIR, to have a share in that Great Work, which through GOD Almighty's Assistance, I am morally assur'd may be ac∣complish'd before the beginning of the

next Age, by the Help of our Disco∣very.
By the same Means, SIR, the Name of the True GOD will be prais'd among a vast Number of Nations hitherto unknown to our Europeans; And as the SON of GOD has foretold, that his Gospel would be prech'd over all the Universe, the Pi∣ety of the Faithful has always increas'd, and been concern'd in the Accomplishment of that Prophecy with respect to barbarous Nations.
Permit me, SIR, to tell all the World that GOD Almighty has reserv'd to Your Majesty's pious Endeavours, the Honour of Carrying the Light of the same into Gospel those many Countries we have discover'd, which are still in the Shades of Ignorance. I should account my self Fortunate, if at this happy juncture I could my self have a share in Opening the Eyes of so many blind-folded Nations, and instructing them in the Truth.
Those numberless Nations, GREAT SIR, would undoubtedly be extreme glad to submit themselves to Your Majesty's Em∣pire, which would be so great an Advan∣tage to them; They would be Faithful and Obedient, deeply affected with Gra∣titude

and Love, for a Monarch so Gene∣rous and so Tender of his Subjects. They would at the same time most happily be brought to the Light of the Gospel: And so many Nations who have hitherto been depriv'd of the Word of One God-and-Man, CHRIST, would henceforwards acknowledge him for the Sovereign Judge of the Quick and the Dead in Heaven, and Your Majesty would have the Satisfaction to see his Sacred Name rever'd in all this New World on Earth.
I pray Heav'n, SIR, ever to accompa∣ny the Justice and Uprightness of Your great Actions, ever to prosper with Suc∣cess Your Majesty's Glorious Enterprizes, and preserve Your Royal Person in the Promotion and Defence of the Interest You have espous'd of my King, his most Catholick Majesty, and all his August Al∣lies, for the Happiness of Your own Sub∣jects, and of all Europe, now e'en crush'd by this Fatal War.
These are the continual Wishes I make from the bottom of my Heart; my great∣est Passion being to worship my GOD, and continue my most humble Services to Your Majesty with Zeal and Affection: I shall ever faithfully execute the Commands

You will be pleas'd to lay on me; and in a deep Sense of Gratitude, I leave this Publick Mark of the most profound and inviolable Respect with which I am,
SIR,
