IT is not many daies past sithens I beyng retyred for a time (my good lord) into the vilage, and there taking the commoditie and pleasure of the faire sweet fieldes, a certaine frend of myne sent vnto me a worke in the Castilian tongue of the lord Antony of Gueuera bishop of Mō∣douent, & Chronicler of the Emperour: in reading whereof I founde great pleasure and profit. The title of the booke is the Dis∣praising of the Court, and the prayse of the life rusticall, dedicate vnto the king of Por∣tingall in such sort, that the better to keepe and to hold the wise sentence and erudiciōs therein cōteined, I employed certain houres after supper to trāslate the same into frēch, not thinking amōg mine other simple works
 euer to put it abrod, but after that I had cō¦municate the same with some of my frends that haue knowledge of the Spanish tongue, I thought it not good to leaue it in a corner to make it meat for Rats & Mise. Now for truth, the first exēpler was so euil deuided, and the leaues so out of order that I gaue charge to the Scriuener that was my nye neighbour to copy thē, & as who should say to write it faire and in order, the which so euil went about it, although by ignoraunce he could not ensue the originall, yet for to gette a litle money he solde where his plea∣sure was the copies so vncumly set together that I was sory and repentant that euer I consumed the time to translate it, till at the last moued by the persuasion of Annas Re∣gin Vicar general, and by Peter Cister your aduocate, by them twaine my great frends, I thought it better to present to the eyes of all men this euill translated, then to suffer lenger those euill exemplers so corrupted to my blame in the handes of those that haue no right iudgement, to know from whom the faulte came: wherefore my good Lorde, vnder your prudent fauor and correction
 I doe aduenture herein my name & fame acording to my knowledge, trustyng assu∣redly that your only name shall suffice to vanquishe and set aside this slaunder, the which slaunder as enemie to learned men, cease not to withdrawe those that haue good will and mynde to studie: I saye this that as mee seemeth it is well worthy that worke of the wyse bishop of Spayne be presented to his semblable or superior in learnyng in Fraunce, or rather aboue him knowledge and vertuous maners. I will adde to this, that the graue sentences and perswasion to vertuous lyfe contei∣ned in thys booke, deserue to bee offered to you that are accustomed to vse them after suche sorte that euery man haue playne opinion of you that yee are sent of God to bee protector and patron of ver∣tue, troubled and dispised. Therefore (my singuler good Lorde, as one of the chiefest of the best sorte) I dedicate to you this my little labour, not that I thinke it worthy to come into your handes, but for to be a per∣petuall witnes that I do owe vnto you my
 seruice with al reuerence, to the which most humbly I recommend me. From your Citie of Cleremont this fyrst day of May. Anno. M.D.xlii.
