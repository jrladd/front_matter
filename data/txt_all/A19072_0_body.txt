MY good Lord: it may seem in the conceits of the ouer∣curious, that in some sort it fareth at this instant with mee, as it did some∣time with the old Philoso∣pher Phormio: who a∣midst the most sumptuous entertainmentes at Ephesus, which K. Antiochus made vnto Hannibal in the time of his banishment from Carthage, for a further delight and recrea∣tion was willed to dilate vpon some theame: and accordingly he tooke in hand to discourse of the duetie of a Captaine, and to teach what
