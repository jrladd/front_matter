CONSIDDERING with my self (maist worthie Knicht) the greit frailtie and vnsurenes of all strent his irthly quhatsūeuer, quhairin mā leising god, vsis to put his traist on the ane part, & the sure fortres and saifgaird of vp∣richtnes, howbeit destitute of all aide warldly on the vther part: I culd not withhald my pen frō vttering of that praise and commendatioun of vprichtnes, quhilk in my mynde I had consauit of the same. Being cheifly mouit heirunto be the Miraculous (as I may weill call it) and maist wonder∣full preseruatioun of that maist notabill seruand of God, and sinceir Preicheour of Christis Euangell, Iohne Knox. Quha being bot of small estimatioun befoir the eyis of the warld (ʒit greit befoir God) was hatit vnto the deith. And that euin be Kingis, Quenis, Princes, and greit men of the warld, and finally be all the rabill of Sathanis suddartis, in Scotland, Ingland, and France. Ʒea, not only was he hatit, and raillit on, bot also persecutit maist scharply, and huntit from place to place as ane vnworthie of ony societie with man. And althocht thay wer michtie and potent, ʒea, and wantit na euill will, and he on the vther syde ane pure man, alane, and oft tymes without help, or assistance of ye warld, ʒit was he michtely preseruit, and as in a maist sure saifgaird (all the wickits attentis quha thristit nathing mair nor his blude being frustrat) conductit to ane maist quyet, peaciabill and happy end, to the greit aduancement of Goddis glorie, and singulare comfort of his Kirk, and to the confusioun of the and discōfort of all his wickit Instrumētis. Thairfoir  dotabil & euidēt ane documēt of the louing cair  wardis his seruāds suld not with him be bury it
 bot abyde recent in memorie till all the Inhabitantis of this Realme in all ages to cum. I haue preissit schortly in this ly∣till paper to mak, as it wer, ane memoriall of the same, & yat in that lāguage quhilk is maist cōmoun to this hail Realme, to the intent that asweill vnleirnit as leirnit may be pertak∣eris of the same. Not that I think my self abill to handill sa worthie ane mater worthelie in ony toung, bot that partly I may schaw my gude will in this mater, and partly to gif oc∣casioun to vtheris, that baith hes mair dexceritie in sic thin∣gis, and greiter opportunitie of tyme, to intreit the same at greiter lenth. That be calling to mynd this notabill exēpill of Godis louing cair towardis vs, we all in chir feirfull dayis (quhairin he that seis not tryall approching neir is destitute of Iudgement) may be strenthnit & incourageit to ga ford∣wart vprichtly, euerie ane in our a win vocatioun, ithout declyning outher to the richt hand or to the left. And prin∣cipally that our watche men faint not, nor begin to look, or flatter with the warld for feir of Tyrānis, bot that thay may haue brasin faces, & foirheidis of Iron aganis the threitnings of the wickit, cōdempning impietie of all persounis in plane termis, following the ensāll of this maist zelous seruād of God, of quhōe heirtofoir we haue maid mentioun, and that being assurit gif sa thay walk vprichtly in dischargeing of thair office, that thay ar in ye protectioun of the Almichtie.
¶And this small frute of my sober trauellis, I haue thocht gude to offer and present to ʒow (maist worthie Knicht) not same kill for that, that I thocht it worthie to be presentit til ony: as that I wald let my gude will and grate mynd, be the same appeir towardis ʒow, throw quhais procurement I ob∣tenit the benefite of that godly and faithfull (thocht mockit alsly traducit of the warld) societie, quhairof presently I a participant. For the quhilk I acknawledge me, and my humbill seruice alwayis addettit to ʒour honour. And how∣beit (as I mon confes) nathing can proceid of me that may in ony wayis correspond to ʒour meritis towardis me: ʒit sal the thankfulnes of mynd at na tyme (God willing) be defi∣cient. Quhilk is to be acceptit, quhair vther thingis ar lac∣king, in place of greit rewaird. And the rather haue I takin
 auldnes to dedicat this lytill Treateis vnto ʒour honour, bath becaus I vnderstude, ʒow euer to haue bene sen ʒour Chyldheid, ane vnfenʒeit fauourar, and mantenar to ʒour power of vprichtnes, quhais praise in this lytill Volume is intreatit. And also, that this notabill seruand of God (quhais michtie preseruatioun, notwithstanding the wickitis rage, to ane quyet end, cheifly mufit me to this busines) was maist belufit of ʒow quhile he leuit, and yat for yat greit vpricht∣nes quhilk ʒe saw from tyme to tyme maist viuely expres the self in him. And finally, that ʒour honour may be mufit heirby, as ʒe haue begunne and continewit to this day ane zelous professour of Goddis word, mantenar of the samin, and lufer of his seruandis: sa ʒe may perseueir to the end of ʒour lyfe, without sclander to ʒour professioun, euer appro∣uing the treuth, and haitting Impietie in all persounis, not leaning to warldly wisdome, nor louking for the plesure of greit men in the warld: Sen nane of thir thingis, bot only vprichtnes can outher mak ane plesand to God, or ʒit sure in this warld. And sa traisting that ʒour honour will accept this my sober offer (till God grant better occasioun of greter) intill gude part. I commit ʒow to the protecti∣oun of the Almichtie, that quhen it sall pleis God to tak ʒow furth of this miserie, ʒe may end ʒour lyfe in the Sanctificatioun of his haly Name. To quhome be praise and Glorie, for euer, Amen. From Sanctandroi the XVIII. of Febr
