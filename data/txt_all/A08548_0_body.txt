ARISTOTLE (right Worshipfull) be∣ing demaunded, what benefite he had obtai∣ned by Philosophie, answered: This is my gaine, that vncommaunded I can doo that I ought, and auoide dooing that I should not; For, (saith he) the ignorant for feare of pu∣nishment abstaine from euill, but the sapient can shunne the same of their own accord: noting, that studious exercise brin∣geth experience, and maketh as well ciuill pollicie, as martiall prowesse apparant. For which cause, there haue bene sundry in times past, and some in this our present age, that haue not onely penned with great labour the laudable workes of An∣tiquitie: but also with as much trauaile haue imitated cer∣taine olde writers, by inuenting of histories, no lesse profita∣ble to repulse other hurtfull pastimes, then pleasaunt to passe away the tediousnes of time. Amongst the number of which late workes, there chanced about a three yeares since to come into my handes, the first part of a Spanish translation, intitu∣led, The Mirrour of Knighthood: which beeing published was so accepted, that I was importuned by sundry Gentlemen (my very friendes) to procure the translation of the seconde part: whereto, (partly to accomplish their desires, and partly for the vulgar delight of all) I condiscended.
And finding this Spaniard adorned with all good exer∣cises, which pertained to the exalting of vertue, and the ex∣tinguishing of vice: I laboured (as much as in mee laye)

to finde an English Patrone of conformable qualitie, whose countenaunce might as well preferre him with the curteous,  protect him among the enuious. But I had not long be∣thought me, when the consideration of your worships cour∣tesie with the good reporte of your vertue, expelled that doubt, and incouraged me to present you with this worke. Beseeching you to accept in good part, this poore pre∣sent at the handes of him, which wisheth to you long life, with the continuall increase of vertue, prosperitie, and health: and after this life endlesse fe∣licitie.
