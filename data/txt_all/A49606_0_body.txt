SIR,
IF the Greatness of Kings derive its value and lustre from the number of Vertues which they possess; I render you now the ho∣mage of my observance, and sub∣missions, as to one of the greatest Monarchs of the World, since
you are the Majesty of all Vertues together. What an agreeable com∣pulsion is this, to see a man's self powerfully forced to become the sub∣ject of a forain Prince, by the sove∣raign authority of his merit? To this point am I reduced, Sir, your all-royal perfections im pse upon me so absolutely such sweet lawes of servitude, that I have no more liberty, but to accept its yoak. And in this, my incli∣nation and duty make a fresh injun∣ction over me, which dispute pre∣beminence with all the rest: for who can keep himself from rendring homage to your Majesty, the onely fame of whose Renown capti∣vates through all the Universe, instructing us, that you are as abso∣lute
over your Passions, as over your Subjects; and that you reign as Soveraign in the esteem of men, as in your Royal Estates: And the Truth of this set your glory at so high a worth, that the felicity on 't may perhaps be envied you: but the like Merit not to be reacht by others, because Nature is very sparing of the like gifts, and Hea∣ven does not every day such mira∣cles. For me, I am but one of the Admirers, not of the greatnesse of your Dominion (although on∣ly the vast extent of the Ocean marks out its limites) but of all the divine qualities which you on∣ly possess in proper as a Good, Time, Fate, nor Death can take from you. Nor is this the all in all,
to be Wise, Valiant, and Gene∣rous, in the height of Native de∣duction; All these Titles of Ho∣nour have degrees of eminence, which mark out to us the gradations of their several perfections, and whereof your Majesty shewes us now the onely pattern, having in possession all admirable Vertues, with so much purity and luster, as dazles its very envyers, and for∣ces them to adore that in your Ma∣jesty, which elsewhere they admire not. And it is my belief, that you stand thus unparalled even amongst your semblables, since besides the Crowns of your Cradle, you car∣ry above them others, and such as shall exempt you from the Grave. I a vow, that I have studied long
time to speak condignely of your Majesty; but although my pains and watchings are equally un∣profitable, my defect yet is still glorious howsomever, that it is a shadow from your Light. It sufficeth me to have taken Pen in hand, to publish onely, that I am
SIR,
