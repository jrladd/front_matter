Much Honoored Sir,
IT hath pleased God since I pre∣sented my last Book unto you, to take out of this Life my immedi∣ate Patron, Sir William Cholmley, your Nephew, to whom that Book was principally Dedicated. And through Gods goodness, your self being my only sur∣viving Patron; I am not only obliged in Du∣ty, but in a manner necessitated to reflect up∣on your worthy Self. I desire ever thankfully to remember, and acknowledge your Good∣ness and Kindness to me, from my first com∣ing to live neer you; and I must ingeniously confess that it was no little encouragement to me in the study of Divinity, that you were pleased to be the first Patron that open∣ed a Door for my initiating, and entrance in∣to the Ministery. I need not make a Recapi∣tulation of those Christian Vertues, which are conspicuous in your sober, and Religious
 Conversation: nor of those gracious abilities wherewith God hath been pleased to endue you, being well known, to as many as know you. I hate both Flattery, and Ingratitude. As for this small Piece, which I now make bold to Dedicate to you; having a disposi∣tion for the satisfaction of some Learned and worthy Friends, to copy a draught of it, I thought I might with one Labour do a pub∣lick, good, and give them their private con∣tentment: and insinuate my thankfulness to your self. Be pleased to afford this small Pre∣sent your favourable Aspect and Patronage: the Subject is Grave and Ponderous, and of great concernment to all true Christians, who desire Eternal Happiness, as for my manner of handling it, I leave to the Censure of Gods Church and People. Thus praying for your Temporal and Eternal welfare: I commit you, and yours to the grace of God in Christ Jesus, and rest
