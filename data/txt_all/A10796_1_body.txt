RIght Worshipfull and religi∣ous) while Poperie preuailed in former times like a thicke fogg, though it quenched no∣thing, yet it smothered for a time, almost all points of sa∣cred truth. But Poperie now vanishing, as mist before the sunne, all points of truth doe shine cleare againe, to the praise of God and our comfort; And yet hath not that duskie vaile beene foulded vp all at once, but by degrees; so that some points appeared more timely, others haue beene the longer vnperceaued. The School∣men, Alexander Alexand. e Ales  u∣lo  & . & Gullm. Gr. quos oms  subtilitai∣bus prost∣bid An∣tchri rg∣no rmauit. Cent. 13. cap. 10. and his Schollers 1200. yeares after Christ, were the first that taught that tythes were not due by the Morall law. And this they did,

to iustifie the exorbitant practises of the Pope. It is therefore a Popish doctrine. Diuers yet, no small aduersaries vnto Rome, haue receiued that for truth, which is meere Poperie. But the sonne is now vp in such brightnesse, as that none shall be deceiued but onely the wilfull. Therefore amongst others, who happily laboured to fling away the vt∣termost skirts of the Romish mantle, that it no longer shadow this part of truth, I haue aduentu∣red to stretch foorth mine hand. What God ena∣bled mee to performe, I humbly offer to your fa∣uourable acceptance, vnto whom by peculiar bonds, both of ciuilitie and conscience, I am obli∣ged. The point is a case of conscience, and of great consequence, and therefore would be thoroughly considered. Yee are wise to iudge as religious Ma∣gistrates, yee are fauourable to religion as zealous Protestants. God Almightie blesse both your publike state with increase of Worship, and your seuerall persons with daily augmentation of his speciall grace. Cambridge. Nouemb. 1613.
