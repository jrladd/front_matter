Madame
1. WHen I finished this little worke, called the Soul's delight, I knew not, to whom I should dedicate or direct it; vntill at length, reflecting on the piety and deuotion, which in your, ladiship I obserued being at Kilkash: and with all, considering the orderly composition of your Chappell, with those deuout pi∣ctures of the Altar, decent vest∣ments, fine and cleane Altar clo∣thes, the obseruance of houres,

for prayer, the great content which you tooke in speaking, and con∣uersing of spirituall matters; and aboue all, the seruent desyre you had, to aduance your soul, in the way of perfection, and the loue of God; for vvhich end (if you re∣member) you told me, that somtymes, your sisters, and your selfe, of purpose, did visit the most honourable, and truly vertuous Lady of Thurles, your Mother in law, though liuing a farre of; and parting thence, as from the schoo∣le, and Mistrisse of vertue, all of you were wholy renewed in spi∣rit, with great feruour, and desire of more seriously louing, and ser∣uing God, the only goodnesse, and faithfull spouse of all deuout and louing soules.

2. Reflecting (I say) on these, (with which certainly I was not a litle edified) I did resolue for your spirituall comfort, and part∣ly their's, to dedicate this Soul's delight, to your Ladiship, with whom, I knowe, it will receiue a better welcome, then those boo∣kes, which treate of the vaine de∣lights, and pleasures, of this transi∣tory world. And though the bul∣ke and substance be but small, yet your humility, and piety, is such, that I feare you will prise it, be∣yond its worth, through that high esteeme you haue, of the smallest treatise (though neuer so simple) which speaketh of God; this being a true token of the loue you beare to his diuine Maiesty.
3. Madame, I haue considered

it; and well may all that knowes your Ladiship, admire, to see so many vertues (but chiefely so great humility) in a soul of so worldly an outward show. Yet truly, I cannot but confesse, that it is the prerogatiue of a vertuous soul, and not the least of vertues, to know, how to cloake and hyde without note, the inward graces and gifts of God. But as the swee∣test perfumes which are closely shutvp, being openned, with greater vigour and fragrancy of their odours, doe recreat and de∣light such as are present, euen so those sweet hidden vertues, close∣ly shutvp in the secret cabinet of your deuout soul, venting them∣selues, by that spirituall language of yours, cannot but very much

comfort, and delight the hearers; which, and your actions, doe tell vs, what fire that smoake com's from; and more then so, it leaueth in the hearts, of such as you con∣uerse with, no small desire to bur∣ne with the same fire; experience teacheth what I speake, I say no more; but doe acknowledg that it hath beene a motiue to me, not only dayly to commend your La∣diship to God, in my poore pra∣yers, but also to addresse this litle worke, vnto you, which treateth of prayer being an excellent mea∣ne to forvvard a soul so pious, and amynd so vertuous, in true perfe∣ction, and the loue of God.
4. Accept therefore of it, I be∣seech you, not so much for its vvorth, as for the affection vvhe∣revvith

it is giuen, and giue it no more praise, nor esteeme, (though called the Soul's delight) then you shall find profit thereby. Yet pe∣ruse it well, and read it with atten∣tion, then vvith your vnderstan∣ding, and vvill, by a serious con∣sideration, and pious affection, vvalke in euery sort of prayer hee∣re laid dovvne for each state of li∣fe, as in the alleyes of a pleasant garden, delighting your spirit, with the varieties of such nosegaies of vertuous flovvers as there are found, and God is vvont to be∣stovv on his ovvne. Or suppose, that heere is a table set before you, vvith many diuersityes of ban∣queting stuff, and dishes of rare, and comfortable meates; taste novv of the one, then, of the

other, and doubtlesse you shall not onlly please your pallat, but also receiue a svveet refection, and spirituall nourishment, by an admirable satisfaction vvith diuine consolation, in the appe∣tites, and invvard povvers of your soul; This is the vvay to delight your selfe, in, and vvith our Lord, vvho seing your diligence heere∣in, vvill easily graunt you the peti∣tions of your heart, and replenish you abundantly, vvith his grace, and loue, in this very life; and in the other, afford you his glorious fight, in vvhich all true happines∣se, and endlesse delight, doth con∣sist: this, he heartely vvisheth vnto your Ladiship, and vvil pray for, vvho is.
Madame
