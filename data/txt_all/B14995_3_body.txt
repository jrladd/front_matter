THough (noble Ladie) in your Honors prayse,
Beneath the shadow of your fauours wing
A sweet Siluester Nightingale doth sing:
The graceful musick, of whose heauenly laies,


From times bests wits, now beares away the baies.
Yet (Beauties best) since meanest birds, ech Spring,
To choisest eares some pleasing sounds do bring;
Vouch safe to heare my Muse in her Essayes.


Where vrg'd by hope, thogh yet not free froÌ„ doubt
That once her sisters teares did fauour find,
Your Honours image heere doth portrait out,


As th' humble pledge of my true thankfull mind.
If that did erre, I hope in this alone;
Since Honours chiefe, this image is your owne.
