My LORD,
YOUR Grace having been pleased to com∣mand the first, and more imperfect, Edition of this Discourse, I have pre∣sumed that your Candour will accept the Draught that hath had my last hand upon it. And though I am not fond enough to phancy any Art or Orna∣ment in the composure to recommend it; yet, I know, the Essay is seasonable, and contains things which relate to our biggest Interests; the design being to secure some of the Out-works of Religion, and to regain a parcel of ground which bold Infidelity hath invaded. And, my Lord, I cannot but observe sadly, that while the Sects are venting their Animosities against each other, and scrambling for their Conceits, and the particular advantages of their way, they per∣ceive

not that Atheism comes on by large strides, and enters the Breaches they have made. Sober and considerate men see the formidable danger, and some of them have strenuously endeavoured to maintain the Walls, while the factions within are so busie and so divided, that they cannot at∣tend the desperate hazard, and will not joyn in a Common Defence. Among those generous De∣fendants I desire to pitch, and have undertaken to make good one of the Forts upon which the Enemy hath made impetuous Assaults, and I hope with no contemptible success.
For my part, my Lord, I am very little concern∣ed for the small pedlaries that some mens fond∣ness calls Religion, by which that sacred thing hath been exposed to a great deal of contempt and dishonour. But yet I think it my duty to have a zeal for those great and certain matters upon which our hopes in an other world are groun∣ded: And that our expectations of a future Being, are not imaginary and fantastick, we have reasonable evidence enough from the Attri∣butes of God, the Phaenomena of Providence, and the nature of our Souls, to convince any, but those who will stupidly believe that they shall dye like Beasts, that they may live like them. I confess the Philosophick Arguments that are produced for the desirable Article, though very cogent, are many of them speculative and deep, requiring so great an attention and sagacity, that they take no hold upon the whissling spirits,

that are not used to consider; nor upon the com∣mon sort, that cannot reach such heights of Ar∣gument: But they are both best convinced by the proofs that come nearest the sence, which in∣deed strike our minds fullest, and leave the most lasting impressions; whereas high Speculations being more thin and subtile, easily slide off even from understandings that are most capable to re∣ceive them. For this reason, among some others, I appear thus much concerned for the justification of the belief of Witches, it suggesting palpable and current evidence of our Immortality, which I am exceedingly sollicitous to have made good.
For really, my Lord, if we make our computes like Men, and do not suffer our selves to be abu∣sed by the slatteries of sense, and the deceitful gayties that steal us away from God, and from our selves, there is nothing can render the thoughts of this odd life tolerable, but the expectation of another. And wise men have said, that they would not live a moment, if they thought they were not to live again. This perhaps some may take to be the discontented Paradox of a melan∣cholick, vext and of mean condition, that is pinched by the straitness of fortune, and envies the heights of others selicity and grandeurs; But by that time those that judge so, have spent the heats of frolick youth, and have past over the several stages of vanity; when they come to sit down, and make sober reflections upon their

pleasures and pursuits, and sum up the accomp of all that is with them, and before them, I doubt not but their considering thoughts will make Solo∣mon's Conclusion, and find, that 'tis but a mise∣ry to live, if we were to live for nothing else. So that if the content of the present life were all I were to have for the hopes of Immortality. I should even upon that account be very unwilling to believe that I was mortal: For certainly the pleasures that result from the thoughts of another world in those that not onely see it painted in their imaginations, but feel it begun in their Souls, are as far beyond all the titillations of sense, as a real lasting happiness is beyond the delusive Images of a Dream. And therefore they that think to secure the injoyment of their pleasures by the insamy of our natures in the overthrow of our future hopes, indeavour to dam up the Fountain of the fullest and cleanest delights; and seek for limpid waters in the sinks and pud∣dles of the strects.
You see, my Lord, how my zeal for this mighty interest transports me to a greater length in th address, than perhaps may consist with strict de∣corum; and I indulge my Pen the rather in th licence, because possibly your Grace's name may draw some eyes hither that have need of such suggestions, and those that have not need a great deal more. It cannot be proper to add here those large accounts which would be requisite in a design of full conviction: But for the present, if they

shall please to look forward, they may likely meet some things not unfit for their serious thoughts; and I intend to take a season to present them others, more particularly suitable to what I know is as much their interest, as I doubt it is their want.
But, my Lord, I fear I am importunate, and beseech your Grace to pardon the boldness of
My LORD,
