Right Honourable,
THis plain Sermon, when prea∣ched, was entertained by Your Lordships with singu∣lar attention; and now comes to publike view by Your command. I shall not presume now to make another tryall of Your patience, by a long Epistle, as I did then in a long Sermon: I onely present it unto You, and (since You

please to have it so) to the eye of the World, humbly beseeching the Lord to accompany it with his blessing, that all who read it, (espe∣cially Your Lordships) may in it behold, as in a Glasse, the Glorie of the Lord, and be changed into the same Image by the Spirit of the Lord; thatso they may account it their greatest Honour to promote this Worke; to beautifie the place of Gods Sanctuary, Esa. 60. 13. and to make the place of his feet glorious. So prayeth
