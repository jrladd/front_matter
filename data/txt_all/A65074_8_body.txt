RIGHT HONOURABLE,
IN compliance with your Order and my own du∣tie; I have imbarked in∣to this service of com∣mitting these Semons to publick view, which did both re∣ceive life at first, and do now begin to
 walk abroad by your Command, not doubting of the same Candour from your eye, which was afforded by your ear, there being little in them that might commend them to the world, or You, beside their seasonablenesse to the Occasion, and time in which they were born.
Though the Government of this Ci∣tie be worthily renowned through the world, yet it must be acknowledged unto the good will of Him that dwelt in the Bush, that our eyes have seen, and do see this our Ierusalem, a quiet Habi∣tation.
And though the Magistrate be cal∣led the Corner, the Shield, the Naile the Stay, &c. of the Common-wealth, yet all things would doubtlesse soone swerve into Anarchie and discompo∣sure: if he that puts a Bridle into the mouth of the Sea, should not still the
 querulous disposition of the People, and make them subject.
There is one thing which makes the burthen of this great people some∣what more tolerable (as I hope) and that is Religion, planted within your Jurisdiction, which teacheth subjecti∣on for Conscience sake, even to the most Morose, much more to the Godly and benign Magistrate.
For sober Religion, teacheth us to obey the Minister, and Sword-bearer, of God; both for the Lords sake, who giveth him his Commission, and for our own, who receive the benefit: And indeed, no man that is wise for himself, would if he might either lop the Tree, whose shaddow shelters him, or goe about to weaken subje∣ction, and so pluck away the Ivie from the Tree that supports it, especially, when He that climbs the Tree, doth it
 not to fill his own pocket, but to shake down the fruit to them that are under it. But (my Lord) I must not make too great a porch to a small building, and therefore shall onely say this, that a pub∣lick Spirit most becomes a Publicke Person; and that the whole work of Ma∣gistracie is a self-deniall; so as if he keep that in his eye, that he is to rule propter Dominum, his example will the better teach the subject to obey, propter Domi∣minum, for the Lord, and the true Bounds and Bonds of this Relation be∣tween Magistrate and Subject shall be inviolably kept; which shall be the pray∣er of your Honours
