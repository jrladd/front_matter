MAy it please You to accept of this Sacrifice which I offer be∣fore Your Supreame Judica∣tory to the service of the times. The fire is that of loyalty, neither wilde
 nor common; nor is the thing altogether forbidden and uncleane. I confesse its maymed and unworthy, yet its the best that I have; and in that regard whiles I now stand at Your Barre, if You shall please to dismisse me without kneeling, I shall in that posture doe the Houses the best service that I can elswhere.
