Honoured Madam,
TO make an Apologie
for Dedications, in
an Age wherein it
were almost ridicu∣lous
to appear with∣out
them, were a folly like his
that should excuse himself for
not being singular; besides that he
must needs be a person of a very
desperate desert and fortune too,

who can neither finde nor make a
friend that will accept or patro∣nize
his labours; and it must
needs be scandalous for the childe,
whose both parents and friends
are ashamed to own it. But
that I should single out You, most
Excellent Madam, from the rest of
your fair Sex, to shelter me from
the dreadful effects of merciless
Criticks, need be the wonder of
none but Your self, whose Modesty
hath restrained You from too
near a familiarity with your own
deserts, and made You happily ig∣norant
of Your own vertues and
power; the knowledge of which
ought not to be trusted with any
goodness less than Your own. But
tyranny, and insolence, and trium∣phing

over the infelicities and mi∣series
of those men whom them∣selves
have made so, is such a piece
of Barbarity, as will finde enter∣tainment
among none but the
basest and the worst of men: which
is all the security I have that I may
once see a period of those suffer∣ings
I have so long patiently, and
scarce patiently endured, since the
remedy is in the power of her
whose very outward appearance
carries with it a certain indication
of generosity and goodness. I was
long silent, and with much relu∣ctancy
at last broke it: but if
grief, though silent, have a voice;
if anguish without a tongue be
vocal; if sorrow be lowd to Elah,
or the groans of an expiring Lover

can be accented; if a mighty a∣mazement
and consternation of a
mind but reasonably sollicitous
for its own happiness, have any
Emphasis; my present sufferings
can neither want arguments nor
oratours: and whilst I plead my
own Cause, and that with You, I
shall much sooner be at a loss
where to begin, than what to say.
Dearest Madam, this little
Book will inform You what You
can do, and I have suffered: my
torments (the Characters of Your
powerful Beauty) are here exactly
delineated, that You may read and
pity me, now almost become
Loves emphatical Martyr. It will
seem a wonder scarce capable of
his belief, should I tell the Reader,

The described Passions in this Book,
come short of what I have, and
the Torments of what I endure for
You. In some places You will
see Your self deservedly seated on
a Throne, which can dart astoni∣shing
influences and a dreadful plea∣sure,
distributing desirable afflicti∣ons,
and pleasing deaths, which the
most greedy of life would desire,
and joyfully embrace: In other
places You may visit Your easie-gotten
Conquests, and see the un∣happy
Trophies of Your Beauty.
Others You have slightly touched,
and but with a few Darts, Me
You have transfixt with a thou∣sand:
their wounds do not need,
mine are scarce capable of cure; and
their greatest Emphasis is their

not being mortal. Yet We valiant
Lovers like these pleasing Cruel∣ties,
love the hand that strikes us,
play with the flames that scorch
us, and enjoy them the blessed
Authors of our deaths.
But lest, whilst I talk of Suf∣ferings,
my trespassing too long
upon Your patience, may justifie
Your inflicting them, and so turn
them into Punishments; and lest
the Prologue drown the Play, and
forestal the patience of the hearers,
which would be more advanta∣geously
reserv'd for the ensuing
Acts; I retire, onely begging
leave to advertise You, that where∣as
some Expressions in this Book
are harsh and uncouth, that may
not be charged upon the Transla∣tor,

who hath in favour of Your
fair Sex trespassed more than once
upon the Author, and fears he
shall stand in need of the learned
Reader's pardon for making so
many, as he begs Yours for not
making more alterations.
Dearest Madam, read this little
Book, and see the reflex image
both of Your self and Me: there
You will finde what You already
are, and what all other Ladies
from Your example fain would be;
who onely blame You for setting
Your Example so high, that it
deceives their sight, baffles their
hopes, and discourages their endea∣vours
of imitation. In mercy to
the gazing world, bridle this Lu∣xury
of Vertue, this Prodigality of

Goodness: 'tis thrifty counsel, and
conduces to Your happiness and
Ours too: it gives us hopes, that
though we can't attain Your course,
we seeing our Guide, may go part
of that Religious way: for though
by a higher pitch of Vertue (if
that supposition be no Crime) You
might be transcribed into some∣thing
above humanity; yet wrapt
in Clouds, we had lost our know∣ledge,
You our love; and You
leaving us in danger of seduction
into Idolatry, lest you should be
without fault, are become guilty
of ours.
But methinks I begin to forget
my Crime, which I promised to a∣mend▪ which cannot be better done, than by not anticipating

Your reading of this Book, which
when read, will supersede the
trouble of subscription. Whatsoe∣ver
is there of Love or Adoration,
I shall do You that Justice and my
self the Honour of acknowledge∣ment
and payment: which tribute
I humbly beg You will not refuse
from,
Dearest Madam,
