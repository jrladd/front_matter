Dread Soveraigne,
I Have beheld with regard the crucifying of our Saviour in his name, and the shamefull handling of his Church for not assenting to the act. A Paper-statue is extant of both, and Dedicated to a Member in Your House of Commons. Against it my pen adventures. Whereto Conscience bindes, thither I

tend. No clouds of horrour shall frighten my obedience from God and the King. Acknow∣ledging therefore your Majesties Supremacy, the next under Christ, I appeale unto Caesar. At the footestoole of your Sacred Throne, Mercy may be had in Iudgement. Who hold this against any right, I sue not to them for pardon. That is one way, I am sure, and enacted too, to strangle the independent Monster. An evill daily felt: and let me not live to pray, if I pray not God heartily for the Reformation. My Petition to your most Excellent Majesty humbly begges a gracious ac∣ceptance of this Primetiall, and the forgivenesse of such presumption. The Almighty settle peace, continue the Gospell, and prosper both: Both under your Majesties Highnesse, and your High∣nesse Progeny, till Christ come in power and glory.
