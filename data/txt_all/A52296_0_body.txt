Most Honoured Sir,
IT is not that I conceive any Worth in this poor Treatise, or that I desire to gain Reputation to it, by prefixing so great a Name to so mean a Perfor∣mance,

that makes me pre∣sume to lay such a Trifle, as This, at your Feet. It is on∣ly the Effect of my Gratitude, which must eternally stand obliged to you, for your so great and undeserved Favors; and to testifie to the World, that, whatever my weak La∣bors are able to produce, are a Tribute due to you alone Who, next under God, have been the only Rewarder o them. It may seem, I am a¦fraid, but an unlucky Under¦taking, to make you no bet¦ter a Return for so good a Preferment, you have been

But truly and sincerely, Sir, my Thank∣fulness is such, that it could not but find a way to express it self in, although it were at the Hazard of your Honor, and my own Reputation; and upon mature Consideration, I thought it more adviseable, rather to let People say you have preferred one who was little deserving of your Fa∣vors, than one who was not

As to these Papers which I have thus ventured abroad, Part of them were composed a considerable Time ago, un∣der an Indisposition of Bo∣dy I then had; when I found my self uncapable of severer Studies, and when the Bent of my Thoughts was alto∣gether this way. The Rest were fitted up at my Lei∣sure since. If they shall be in any ways serviceable to the World, which, consider∣ing the Dissolutenss of the Age, stands in need enough of such Treatises. I shall

praise God heartily for it, or it will content me, only to have used my Endeavors, and to testifie the abundant Thank∣fulness of
