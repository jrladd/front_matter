SIR.

THE time is come again, in which we may
Use Tricks of Youth, and safely see a Play;
Hear Tavern-Musick, and such harmless things
As neither wrongs Gods Precept, nor the Kings:
For all those Recreations are set sree
In sixty one, were damn'd in forty three,
By those Trienial Traytors, who agreed
To make the Publick Faith weigh down the Creed.
When Ten Commandements they did deface
And put a League and Cov'nant in the place.
When in contempt of Spiritual Affairs,
In one day they cry'd down Prelates and Players,
But now the times are well return'd that we
Under the Sacred Beams of Soveraignty,
May in our Comick Nombers sit and sing
Peace to the People, Honour to the King:
Which aptly doth administer Occasion
For me to represent this Dedication,
To your good hands, whose Patronage is fit
To Crown the Play, and add long life to Wit.
For let Mens Wit be nere so well exprest,
'Tis witty acceptation makes the Iest.
This Play consists of Humour, Tricks of Youth,
Done by known Persons, Fancy mixt with Truth.
Which is ambitious of no higher Fame
Or preservation, but your Noble Name,
That, singly can sufficiently prefer
This Poem, and
