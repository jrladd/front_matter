SIR,
NEITHER the considerable Posts, to which your Me∣rits have formerly advanced you in Armies abroad in other Coun∣tries, nor those which by your Experience in Military Affairs, you have justly gained at home in your Own, could ever be able to hinder you from delighting your self with Books. Those are your

Companions, as well in your Tent, as your House; wherein your Genius hath faithfully guided you in the true Paths of Honour; Pallas being the Goddess both of Arms and Learning. The Greek Hero could not sleep without Ho∣mer's Iliads under his Pillow. Be∣sides whom, you have two others for your Pattern, the most ac∣complished Gentlemen, and Men admirable in your Profession, the World could ever boast of, I mean the famous Scipio, and Iulius Caesar, both equally addicted to Arts and Arms.
I confess I know your Inclinati∣ons lead you to things of more so∣lid Learning, yet guessing that a

Variety may not be unpleasant, I have ventured to Dedicate this to you, hoping it may serve your Diversion when tyred with Bu∣siness, or your more serious Stu∣dies. In this Piece there is a Mix∣ture of Subjects as well as of Au∣thors, some of which, I presume, may give you the Satisfaction, I wish, in their Perusal; For I can justly boast that the Translations, are from many of the most admi∣red Poets both Ancient and Mo∣dern, in their several Languages extant, which of themselves would need no Apology for their appear∣ing in public, were it not for the Blemishes they may have received in passing thrô my hands; And

none of these having been English∣ed by the Ingenious Translators of our late published Miscellanies, as I ever heard, may possibly appear new to you.
Sir, I hope you will pardon the Liberty I have taken, in shewing, by so slight a Present, the Respect, and Honour I justly bear you, I being glad to lay hold on any oc∣casion to declare to the World that I am,
