May it please Your Majesty.
AS the Greatness of Your Concernment in
the present good of our Dread Soveraign
and his dear Consort, and the interest in
the felicity of their Succession; render You the fitâˆ£test
object, for the application of any our expressions
of Joy, or hope thereof: So the goodness of Your
greatness it is, that lays the way open to Your Throne
of Favour, where We may offer up such Devotions.
Wherefore presuming that my boldness is already
Pardoned, I adventure to present to the gracious
acceptance of your fair Hands, these silly Papers.
I Madam that am not worthy to Kiss your Royall
Feet, but am ready to stand off, at what distance
your Majesty shall please, and be your Majestyes,

Calend. Jan. 1664.
