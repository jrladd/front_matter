SIR,
THis hath had the good For∣tune
to wait on you so of∣ten,
that it must now be
grown somewhat familiar and acquaint∣ed,
which will excuse you from a
considerable part of the trouble of

being told what it is, and why it
presumes on your Protection. And
certainly, Sir, you had been whol∣ly
freed, if it were not pleasant,
now I am safe on Shore, to look
back, and smile at the impotent Ma∣lice
of that Sea that tost me, and
gratefully acknowledge his Goodness to
whom I stand principally indebted for
my Safety. Envy, Sir, according to
the usual description, bears a very
frightful Figure; Thin, Pale, Mea∣ger
is her Face, and Whips and
Snakes her Ornaments; such the
Painters draw, such the Tragedians
represent her; and who then, Sir,
would be acquainted with so gastly a
Vice? who in love with Deformity it
self? No, we must guess from her
general influence on Mankind, that
this Picture shews but one side, the
other is smooth and gay, smiling

and as well drest as Flattery. As
it carries the Poyson of a Serpent,
so it hath the shining of its Scales,
and creeps with as little Noise. I
could point out some, were it safe,
whom you must acknowledge sate for
this very Draught, who threw a
Snake or two to envenom every Line,
and then cry'd out against it as
noxious in it self, and full of it's
own Poyson; but that design fail∣ing,
a thousand little Stories came
abroad, and innumerable personal Re∣flections;
each Man clapt together
what he thought was worst, and
made a more ridiculous Composure
than Horace's Painter could have
contriv'd from all the various Parts
of the Creation: So that when I
look'd upon my self as I came from
their Hands, Heavens! How much
was I chang'd from your old Ac∣quaintance!

Some should be menti∣on'd,
could I perpetuate their Folly
without injury to my self; but there
is so close a Connexion, that I can∣not
venture them but in such pri∣vate
Entertainments as you are pleas'd
now and then to divert your self
withal: These were pretty sure
Cards, but they wanted Art to Play
the Game, and therefore the other
Face was turn'd, and all seem'd
fair and pleasant to look upon:
Fame attended me forsooth, and
my flying Daphne was presently
chang'd into a Laurel: And this,
Sir, ad almost intic'd me to a
Precipice; till your Iudgment dis∣cover'd,
and your Kindness shew'd
me the Danger; till I receiv'd In∣structions
how to avoid the present and
prevent future Practices; till you were
pleas'd, to innumerable others, to

add this Obligation of my safety,
and preserve me in condition to be
intirely,
Wadham College,
August the 12th, 1683.
