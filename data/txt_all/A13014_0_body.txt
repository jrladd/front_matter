Right Worshipfull, Beloved, and Christian friends▪
AS it was in the build∣ing of the Temple, many hands were im∣ployed in the raising of that glorious Structure: So∣lomon did raise a tribute of men

for the work, and they were all imployed according to their se∣verall abilities; some did work in gold, in silver, in brasse, in iron, in purple and blew silk; some did hew and square, o∣thers did bear and carry the stones and timber, to the raising of that sacred pile: so it is in the Church of God, of which that materiall house was a cleer re∣presentation; there is no man so mean, but may be some way usefull to the house of God; those that cannot work in gold, and silver, and silk, yet may cut and hew; and those that can do neither, yet may carry bur∣thens. This latter is the task that I have undertaken; vz. To

serve the Church, in bringing forth this provision which is here presented to you, of ano∣ther mans cost indeed, yet not without some labour and care of my own, to prepare the ta∣ble, and set things in order be∣fore you. I am the rather incou∣raged in it, because I know that God can as well serve himself of my labour in this, as of the skill and ability of the learned Author: and if in this I may be a helper of the joy of Gods Church, I have wherein for to rejoyce.
These insuing Sermons were first preached unto you, they were yours in the delivery, and are yours of Right, as conceived

and brought forth for you; and I know not how you should lose your Right in the pub∣lishing of them, but rather owe Patronage, Apology, Harbour and Recommendations; there∣fore I have made bold to prefix your Names before them, and so to publish them for the good of the Church; being well assu∣red, that you will not grutch this communication, of your own right and interest in them, to others.
For the Author, hee needs not my Candle to light his Sun, nor my Pen to make new im∣pressions of honour and love in your hearts, who have so fully known his Doctrine, manner

of Life, Purpose, Faith, Long-suffering, Charity, Patience, Humility, &c.
I may say of this posthume Birth, that the Author died, as Rachel, in travell with it; and it may well be called Benjamin, the son of his Right hand: whil'st he was a carrying of you up into the Mount, to shew you the land of Promise, God took him, and by Invisible messen∣gers, caried him to the fruition of Eternall Blessednesse: he is taken out of your sight, and if you desire to finde him, you must aspire unto the heavenly Paradise, by walking in that tract which he hath in his Do∣ctrine here chalked out unto

you; and in those steps of his religious and zealous conversa∣tion, which he hath walked in before you.
But lest you should let these things slip; this booke may be your continuall Remembrancer, in this, hee being dead, yet speaketh. But his labour will be lost, and my undertaking fruitlesse, except you be pleased to make the practise of these things your trade, and the me∣ditation of them your Recrea∣tion.
Here you may see wherein true happinesse doth consist: the right placing or misplacing of happinesse is the Ruder of a mans life, the fountaine of his

well or ill doing; according to which, men take their marks, and shoot right or wrong, in all the actions of their lives: you will be mistaken, if you seek it in these outward things, it is on∣ly to be found in God; there is no other independant good, nei∣ther is there any other good that can be communicated to all the heirs of Blessing, but only God; that which all must pos∣sesse, and that together, must needs be some infinite thing. It will then be worth your while, to call off your affections from the world, and to abate of your eager pursuit after the things of this life: you are not made for Riches, but they are made for

you: the Bee will forsake the Flower that yeelds her no Ho∣ny; the fruit that the World affords you, is but like that which grows upon the banks of the dead Sea, a fair apple, which under a red side, contains no∣thing but dust: it will be your wisdom, not to cumber your selves about many things, when one thing is needfull: the say∣ing of the Roman Generall to the souldier that kept the tents, when he should have bin fight∣ing in the field, Non Amoni∣mium diligentes, will be used of God, if when he cals us to seek after true Happinesse, yet vve busie our selves onely about things of an inferiour Alloy;

God will not like such busie∣bodies: our chiefest care and pains should be bestowed, in the attaining of that which is our chiefest Happinesse; if you be industrious in this, your labour will not be in vain: you must think of Religion as of trading, which will bring no gain, un∣lesse diligently follovved and practised: Arise therfore, and be doing, and the Lord will be with you.
Give me leave to tell you, first, that God hath done much for you, exalted you to heaven, in regard of the means: It is true, your eyes have seen wor∣thy Lights, shining in their life and Doctrine, and by death

extinguished; and yet your losse hath not been more bitter∣ly lamented, than in a good measure graciously supplied; the causes of your hope and joy, have been in a good proportion equivalent to your grief and losse.
Secondly, GOD looks for much from you; viz. an adorn∣ing of the Gospel, and walking worthy of it, in a holy, fruit∣full and obedient conversation: such favours bestowed, must needs raise great expectations; and this expectation frustrated, doubles the judgment. But I hope better things of you, and such as accompany salvation.
You did receive the Author

with so much love and honour, as that you cannot but counte∣nance this Posthume Birth, which was first conceived, and brought forth for you; & your selves being witnesses, contains no other things, than what you have heard and learnt: and so, though others should deny it, yet you must give unto it, Har∣bour and Intertainment. Ther∣fore I have, in the name of the Widow of the Reverend Author, intitled you unto it. If it shall be approved usefull to the Church, fruitfull to you, & beneficial to any, I shall rejoyce; my prayers shal be for their suc∣cesse, and for your happinesse.
