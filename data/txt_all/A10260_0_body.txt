SIR: two things more espe∣ciall haue made me indu∣strious to doe your Lord∣ship seruice: The one is, the loue you did beare to my (long since) deceased Father; whom (dead) your Lordship did please to honour with your Noble remem∣brance. The other is, your vndeserued Fa∣uours, and Honourable Countenance to∣wards me in your passage thorow Germany, where you haue left in the hearts of men, a Pyramis of your Worth. As for the first, I am heire to that seruice, which my Father, (alwayes ob∣seruant

to your Honour) was ready to per∣forme. As for the second, my selfe, in more particular stand obliged. In respect of both, heere I dedicate my selfe, and these few leaues to your truly-Noble Selfe, hoping your Lord∣ship will vaile my boldnesse in your good ac∣ceptance, and crowne my labours with your approbation:
SIR,
