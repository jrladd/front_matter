Dear Countrey-men,
IT may be in this conjuncture of Affairs, you may think I have said too little, as things now stand between His Majesty of Britain, and the Flemings, truely I could say more, it being my duty to vindicate my Countreys Honor and Interest, as far as such high Provocations, multiplied

by the weight of so many Obligations, may justly bear; yet have I been so far from set∣ting Wounds bleeding afresh, (since I hope there is an Anidote making ready in Hol∣land) that I have labored (perhaps without thanks) to salve with as much gentleness as modesty could give me leave, the sad and fatal Breaches; However, I shall be more ready to ask pardon, than offend by being too censo∣rious, or violent against an Enemy; for, give me leave to tell you, I think we live in an Age that cannot well be flattered by fine words, truth and the matter is that they expect, I hope I have laid it down, and that without gilded Sentences. Accept them, and weigh them justly for on my word they come from a faithful and loyal Subject to His Majesty, though never in his pay.
