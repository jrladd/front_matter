Noble Lady,
AS you have been plea∣sed
to make me happy,
by permitting me to
gaze with admiration upon the
rare structure and goodly fa∣brick
of that beautifull temple

of your Vertues; so give me
leave to passe through this, into
your temple of Honor, and there,
at the shrine of your perfections,
to lay this Centurie of Divine
Meditations; a sacrifice, I
know, more acceptable to you
then whole Hecatombes of fat
beasts, or the smoake of Sabean
incense. Your noble Progenitors
have devolved upon you many
naturall endowments, whereby
you out-strip most of your own
sex: but grace hath gifted you
with cleernesse and perspicuitie
of judgement in the mysteries of

speculative Divinitie, even be∣yond
many who think themselves
learned Clerks of our sex. Ma∣dam,
though you are every way
honourable, yet nothing doth so
much enoble you, as your zeale
to Religion, and love to learned
men: When your beautie, wealth,
outward honours and pleasures
shall determine in death, even
then Religion and Learning will
beautifie and inrich your soul,
and immortalize your name. The
highest pitch of my ambition in
this, and the former Dedication,
is only to shew my gratitude to

your honourable Husband, and
your Self, though in small mites,
compared to your noble favours;
and withall, to set forth the
lustre of your own knowledge in
these points which still perplex
the mindes of many Christians.
The Father of Mercies crowne
you both, and your hopefull Issue,
with the blessings of both hands
here, and of Eternitie hereafter.
This is, and still shall be, the
prayer of
