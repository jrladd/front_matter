THis testimonie of my true hearts zeale,
Faire, and (for euer honord) vertuous maide:
To your kinde fauour humbly dooth appeale,
That in construction nothing be mis-saide.
Those fierie spirits of high temperd wit,
That drinke the dewe of heauen continually:
They could haue graced you with termes more fit,
Then can my lowlie, poore, weake ingenie.
Let not my loue (yet) slightly passe respect,
Deuoted onely to your excellence:
Winke woorthy Virgin at my lines defect,
Let will extenuate what ere offence.
It is no bountie that is giuen from store,
Who giues his hart, what gift can he giue more?
FINIS.
