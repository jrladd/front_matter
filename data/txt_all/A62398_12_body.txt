IT's such a Title of Preheminence then,
To bear the name of Shepherds Swain,
That David who so well his words did frame,
Did call our great Creator by that name;
Our bless'd Redeemer God's eternal Son,
Whose only Merits our Salvations won,
He did the harmless name of Shepherd take,
For our Protection, and his Mercies sake,
Which makes thy rest like those that restless be,
Like one that is pursued, and cannot flee;
Or like the bussie bussing bumming Bee,
Or like the fruitless naught respected Flee,
That cuts the subtile Air so swift and fast,
Till in the Spiders-web he's fetter'd fast.
So falling fast asleep, and sleeping in a Dream,
Down by that Dale which flows with Milk and Cream,

Thy dearest Dame did to thee say,
Francis, Francis, Come away,
I wondred when I heard that name begun,
Francis, Francis, that was Adams son,
And Adam in his time deserv'd no misreport,
He was the son of Gilmanscleugh Robert,
And Robert was a pretty Gentleman,
The Heir to Iames, he was his eldest son,
The first of Gilmanscleugh Iames was then,
Who was the youngest son of Thirlston,
And Iohn of Thirlston I let you know,
Was son to David Scot of How paslaw,
And David Scot that worthy man,
Was son to Sir Walter of the same,
For Gilmanscleugh I've said enough,
His first original is from Buckcleugh;
Now of all Beasts that ever were or are,
None can for goodness with a Sheep compare,
Indeed for Bone and Burthen I must grant,
He's much inferiour to the Elephant,
The Drumadarie, Camel, Horse, and Ass,
For Load and Carriage doth the Sheep surpass;
Strong Taurus, Eunuchs son, the labouring Ox,
The stately Staig, the bobtail crafty Fox;
These and all rav'nous Beasts of Prey must yield,
Unto the Sheep, the honour of the Field;
Where Sheep abounds in Scotland more or less,
There's still a part of Iasons Golden Fleece.
