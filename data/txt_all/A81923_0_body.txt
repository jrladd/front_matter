Reverently and humbly sheweth,
THat seeing for the space of these ten yeers by∣past, your Petitioner, as without all pre∣judice and partialitie against any Prote∣stant Church or person; so with all favou∣rable permission, good liking, approbation, and encou∣ragements from chief men of all sides, whom in a Civill or Ecclesiasticall way it doth concerne, hath solicited the work of reconcilement amongst Protestants: where∣in he is gone so farre, as in a private Theologicall way

of Treaty may bee proceeded with forraign Churches, to prepare their mindes unto further resolutions in due time. And now finding, by Gods good Providence, an opportunity of publick meetings, both here in England, where his solicitation is laid to heart; and also in his native Countrey and Church, where hopefully his purpose may be in like manner promoted by publick ap∣probation and counsell of the godly, wise, and learned Ministery:
Therefore he thinketh it a part of his duty to deferre his humble respect unto your Reverend Assembly, in∣treating for the love of the Spirit, and by the Communi∣on of Saints, that in the feare of God, so good an endea∣vour, though meanly hitherto countenanced, may not bee slighted; but that the scope and prosecution thereof may be taken up without prejudice, according to the true mea∣ning thereof, which is laid open in the printed English Relation, and Latine Information herewith offered unto you: And that the writ given to M. Alex. Henderson, containing a draught of the particular means and man∣ner of proceeding, wherein the way of your sued for con∣currence is specified, may be taken seriously to heart, and some Declaration of Christian advice, and answer there∣upon returned, which may conduce, and help to advance the glory of God through the unblameable and peaceable profession of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amongst Pro∣testants: And I your Petitioner, as in duty bound, shall pray daily for your eternall and temporall felicity, and his Majesties long life, in a peaceable and prosperous Go∣vernment over you, and all his Kingdomes.
