To the Worthy JOHN LUPTON, Esq Head of the Family of LUP∣TON, Eternal Happi∣ness.
THough my Personal O∣bligations to you are very many and consi∣derable, and may very well screw me up to a very high strain of gratitude; (and me∣thinks I find my self very ready in this particular to do you right, and to acknowledge my self very much bound to you and
your Family; yet) I must say, I honour you more for the Lati∣tude you take in doing good to all, and promoting every good Design that comes within your reach, without the least Hesi∣tancy: Orphans, and Minors, and such as are destitute of help, to whom you have be∣grudg'd neither pains nor cost, will plead for you, I hope, bet∣ter than my Tongue or Pen can. There are none that know you, but must confess, how close a Friend you are to Religion and Learning, and at what rates you would promote them. Surely it had been a Crime in
me, having so good occasion, to have conceal'd your Worth and Merits towards me, whom you have intrusted with your best Treasure, and given me all en∣couragement and help to their good Education, not regarding the Slanders of some that would make themselves seem wiser in such Affairs, wherein they have been little vers'd, than o∣thers of far greater experience. I know you need not such an Orator as I, whose Virtues will more commend you, than the best Pen and Ink can do. How∣ever, I will ease my self a little of the burthen under which I lye
and make some publick acknow∣ledgment of my Obligations to you, wishing this Practical Treatise may come so near your heart, as that it may do you everlasting good; and that God would continue to bless your Family, as he hath hi∣therto done, that your Posteri∣ty may not degenerate from the exemplary practices of their Ancestors. So prayeth,
Sir,
