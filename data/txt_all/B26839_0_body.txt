Right Honorable,
THis Sermon was intended only for my private Auditory, but (ex malis mini∣mum) to avoid a greater inconvenience, I am constrain'd, to present it to a pub∣like view, and have presum'd, to dedicate it to your Honour▪ Be pleas'd (I humbly intreat) to afford it your favourable protection, that under your honored name, it may find the more free en∣tertainment.
 And accept it, as a testimony of my gratitude, for those immerited favours, I have re∣ceiv'd from your selfe, with your vertuous Lady, who hath beene a great encouragement to mee in my Ministery, since my comming to this place. I must ingenuously acknowledge my inabilitie of repayment, but by my daily vote to Heaven, for your felicities, here, and hereafter, and ever rest
