MOst Mighty Prince; I doubt not but the world may deeme me ouer-audacious, and you this worke te∣dious
and troublesome; the former, that I should presume to dedicate such an indi∣gested, immature Embrio to your Hignesse; the latter, in regard you Highnesses eyes haue diuersity and multitudes of more worthy obiects. To the first, J answer; that by how much the worke is more meane, by so much it hath more need of a mighty Protector, and therefore, though they may deeme me impudent, yet it is not a thing imprudent, but important, that it should seeke to shelter it selfe vnder the patronage of your Highnesse. To the next, J beseech your Highnesse, (nam nil nisi vota supersunt) not so much to respect the weakenesse of the worke, as the wil∣lingnesse of the Author, to performe duty vnto your mighty Personage, who though hee cannot goe for ability, yet he creepeth to offer this Sacrifice vnto you, and is em∣boldned through the abundance of obedi∣ent
loue, to cast this mite into the trea∣surie of your Highnesse.
Farre be it from me, with the Ape in the Fable, (who brought her young ones to the Lion, as the most amorous and beautifull) to present this issue of my braines, and off-spring of my labours, as worthy of the view of your Highnesse: Oh no, I am no waies guiltie of such a Phi∣lautie, but in regard your royall selfe is the Subiect of which it treateth, shewing the happinesse which is deriued by the most fortunate contract betweene your High∣nesse and that most incomparable Lady and pure Ʋirgin of France; in which though with a weake vnable pensile, J haue drawne forth and portraied the di∣uine parts of your princely Personages; of the which, though all knew some, yet some knew not all which J haue related: in the which description and map of your
perfections if I haue failed, (as J cannot hope to the contrary) I humbly craue par∣don, and prostrate my selfe at the feet of your mercifull censure; beseeching you that the true affection of the Author may couer the imperfection of the worke.
The reasons which moued me to this boldnesse to craue your Highnesse his Pa∣tronage, were these:
First, in respect you are the chiefe Sub∣iect of this Marriage Song, the which Subiect though it be impossible for mee to honour by my worke, yet it is most certaine, my worke is honoured by it.
Secondly, in regard as you, for all ver∣tues are the adamant of admiration from all men, so most especially for your resplen∣dent vertue of humility, who though you be high in Maiesty, yet you are low in minde, and despise not, but incourage men, though weake & impotent, in any good en∣terprises
and vertuous endeuours, that so being nourished by your fauour, & cōfor∣ted with your countenance, they might in∣crease and grow in goodnesse, and in fine attaine to the summe of all perfections.
Moreouer, J know that I doe not one∣ly owe my labours and all that J haue to your Highnesse who are the Conduit, by which God conueys felicity not only to me, but Millions of people; the which constrai∣ned mee in gratitude to consecrate this worke vnto you.
Reiect not therefore these fruits of my Industry, which were inuented & pre∣sented out of meere respect to your High∣nesse, and the ioy conceiued for the late contract with France; and as you are the patterne of all vertues, so vouchsafe to bee the Patron of this booke, which is but an abridgement & the compendium of them, & an expression of the happinesse, which is
likely to be an attendant and follower of this your intended and promised mariage with the Lady Henrette Maria, Daugh∣ter to Henry the Fourth, King of the French & Nauarre, & Sister to Lewis the Thirteenth, now French King; the which grieuing to see, that none more able than my selfe would vndertake, J (though with weakenesse) haue performed.
Let therefore this booke which was writ∣ten onely for your Highnesse, is Dedica∣ted to your Highnesse, be accepted of your Highnesse; of the which, not despairing, J wish vnto your Highnesse a higher than the highest Happinesse, that you may haue a long and fortunate life, remaine the comforter of your friends, the Conquerer of your enemies, and be the Father of ma∣ny happy Children.
