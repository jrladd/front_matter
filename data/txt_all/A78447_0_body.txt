Reverend and beloved Brethren:
WHen the Sun of Righteousnes had first favourably risen to them that fear the Name of God in this Land, after a dark and stormy night of corrup∣tion and persecution; then, even then were the quickning beams of the sun of ci∣vil Authority in this inferionr world caused first to light upon you, to form your renowned City into severall Classes, and afterwards into a Provinciall Assembly: not onely that you might

have the birth-right of Honour (which we cheerfully remember) but also, that being in∣vested with Authority from Jesus Christ, and the civill Magistrate, you might be prepa∣red to stand in the front of opposition, the powers of Hell being startled and enraged at the unex∣pected reviving of Gospel Government and Dis∣cipline, which seemed so long to lye for dead; and, that having your strength united, you might be enabled and encouraged to plead the cause of God against the Divine right of Episcopacy, and for the Divine right of the Ruling-Elder, that the one might not be shut out of the Church, and the other might not recover in the Church; both which have been, and still are un∣der design. VVhat you have already done this way, as a thankfull improvement of Divine favour, and with speciall reference to the respe∣ctive Classes and Congregations within your Province, doth evidently appear in your Vin∣dication

of Presbyterian Govern∣ment, and your Jus Divinum Ministerii Evangelici: which choice fruits of your Provinciall Assembly, are not onely refreshing and satisfying for the present, but do promise fair for time to come; such clusters do shew there is a blessing in the Vine, which the Lord of the Vineyard continue and increase.
When you, our Reverend Brethren, had first been shined upon, and made so fruitfull, the Divine grace caused a second enliven∣ing beam of civill Authority to fall upon this remote and despised County, to constitute in it also, severall Classes, and afterwards a Provin∣ciall Assembly; since which time such heavenly influence hath been stayed. As our Lot hath happily fallen to follow you in the favour of God, and civill Authority, so we have unhap∣pily fallen into your Lot, (especially this Classis) to be followed with the anger, opposition,

reproaches and contradiction of men of con∣trary mindes: which though hid in the ashes in great measure formerly, and but sparkling now and then, here and there in a private house or Congregation, yet when we would conscientiously and tenderly have improved the Government, for the instruction of the ignorant, and reformation of the prophane, it brake out into a flame; and no way, but that flame must be hasted to such a Beacon, that it might not be quenched, till the Nation had seen and taken notice, especially the whole opposite party awakened, a very de∣sign. You have pleaded the civil Authority for your acting in the Government, but have setled the Government it self (for the satisfaction of your own consciences, and the consciences of the people of God) upon the firm basis of divine Scripture authority, and so have we: thence you have been authorized to bring into the Church, and keep in it (by the mercifull

intervention of civill Authority) the despised governing Elders; and so shut out of the Church, and keep out of it, that Lordly and self-murthering Episcopacy; and so have we. You have been forced to flie to the testi∣mony of your consciences, concerning your aims, and ends in your publick undertakings, in the cause of God, and so have we. It was scarce pos∣sible for you to wipe off the dirt cast upon you, but some of it would unavoidably fall upon them that cast it; nor can we. Ʋpon these, and other considerations, we knew not in what Name of right, to publish our enforced Vindication in the same common cause, but in your Name, who have gone before us in the work, and have afforded us light and encouragement, whose seasonable and solid Labours, have already found ac∣ceptance in the Church, and blessing from God. And we pray that your Bow may abide in strength, and the armes of your hands may be

made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob, that though the Archers have sorely grieved you, and shot at you, and hated you, yet you may still possess the rich blessing of truth in Doctrine, Government and Discipline, and may foyl the adversaries thereof, till the renewed, and enlarged favour of God hath overspread this Nation with the Reformation, so happily begun; and till that, so much desired, prayed for, and endeavoured accommodation of dissenting Brethren (alas, alas! too hardly attained) may sincerely, edifyingly, and lastingly be effected; that when all our undermining, scorn∣ing and opposing enemies, do hear, and see these things, they may be much cast down in their own eyes, perceiving that this work hath been wrought of our God, in whose arms of mercy and truth we leave you, and the Cause we manage.
