SIR, amongst many which most deseruedly loue you, though
 the least, yet am loth to be the last, whose endeuours may
make knowne howe highly they esteeme of your noble and
kind disposition; Let this Epistle Sir (I beseech you) which
vnworthily weares the badge of your woorthy name, acknow∣ledge
my zeale with the rest, (though much lesse deseruing)
which for your sake doe honour the house of the Mounsons. I
know true generositie accepteth what is zealously offered, though
not euer deseruingly excellent, yet for loue of the Art frō whence
it receiueth resemblance. The light Phrigian harmony stirreth
delight, as well as the melancholy Doricke moueth passion, both
haue theyr motion in the spirit, as the liking of the soule moueth
the affection. Your kinde acceptance of my labour shall giue
some life to my Muse, which yet ouers in the vncertainetie of
the generall censure.
