IT is not without good reasoun, nather contrair commen∣dable example RICHT HONORABLE, that I presume to dedicat this present treatise, being the first fruitis of my ingyne vnto ʒour Lordschip. For this hes bene ane daylie pra∣ctise and an old custome at all tymes be thame obseruit, quha with grit trauel & eirnest diligence hes profited in letters: that quhensoeuer at any tyme thay ar myndit to commit their lau∣bours vnto licht, they do harbour them vnder the countenāce & couer thē vnder the autority of sum noble personage. mouit theirto be dyuers considerations, pairtly to procure sum de∣fence and protectioun to thair works: Pairtly to purches sum commendatioun to them selfis.
This being throughly weyit and dewly be me considerit I haue takin the boldnes through example, by the dedicatioun heirof to acknawledge ʒour Lordschip as an maist worthie pa∣troun of my good and Godly meanings.
And as I am encouragit sumquhat be example, so I am not a lytill heirto inforcit by ressoun. For seing my self to be wholie addictit vnto ʒour Lordship, al yt then quhilk ather I am wil∣ling to accomplisch or able to performe, dois iustlie apper∣tene ʒow. My dewtie crauis na les althoght ʒour com∣mendable vertewis deserueth mair, quhilks if I war of any ha∣bilitie to frame them so decently by toung, as ʒour Lordschip practises them commendablie be work, I wald think my selfe contentit in my concait. Bot sa it is, that I rather confesse my imbecillitie heirin by schamefast silence, then to impair ʒour Lordschippis praises by scarcitie of words. Thairfoir leuand the rehearsel of thais vertewis quhairwith ʒour Lordship is a∣dornit

to be decorit with gritter eloquence, I will not cease continually to meruell at thame quhilkis now I can not suf∣ficiently commend.
My houpe mekill ineressis that thir my laubours salbe mair freindly acceptit be ʒour Lordschip, then any wayis disdain∣fully misly kit. For hauing vnderstād baith be ʒour Lordschips letters, and be the report of vther gentlemen, quhat grit re∣membrance ʒow haue dayly of me, conioynit with a singuler fauour and a maist eirnist loue: of the quhilk I haue na small assurance, I may be certen, that ʒour Lordschip will als courte∣ously raceaue this present (being the significatioun of my guid mind & plege of my effectionat seruice) as I offer it willinglie▪ And so vpoun the consideratioun of my dewtie, and vpon the considence of ʒour Lordschips accustomit courtesie, I haue takin the boldnes to decore this treatise with ʒour Lordschips noble Name. This leauing to trouble ʒour Lordschip any longer, I cōmit ʒow to God, who send ʒow a goodly encrease in vertow & a prosperous returne to ʒour countrie.
