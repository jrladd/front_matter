May it please Your Honours,
IT is the greatest Happiness of
the People of England that the
Laws by which they are go∣vern'd
cannot be made without the
Consent of their Representatives, who
as they obtain good Ones from
the Favour of their Prince, so 'tis
their own fault if they pass such as
are bad.
Amongst all our Laws none tend

more to the promoting the Wealth
of this Nation than those which ad∣vance
its Trade and Manufactures,
by the latter we not only imploy
our Poor, and so take off that Bur∣then
which must otherwise lie heavy
on our Lands, but also grow Rich
in our Commerce with Foreign Na∣tions,
to whom we thereby sell our
Product at greater Prices than it
would otherwise yield, and return
them their own Materials when
wrought up here, and encreased in
their Value by the Labour of our
People.
This little Tract I humbly offer
to this Honourable House, not to di∣rect,
but with all Humility to lay
before Your Honours an Anatomy
of the Trade of England, dissected
and laid open so as to discover
its Vitals, which have seemed to
be struck through by some late Acts.

Whatever doth Prejudice to our
Manufactures, or burthens our Fo∣reign
Trade above what it is well
able to bear, stabs them to the
Heart, and where Taxes are thus laid,
they disable the Subject, and conse∣quently
are so much more burthen∣some
as they make him less able to
pay them; But when our Manu∣factures
are encouraged, and our
Foreign Trade made easie, and well
secured, the Lands of England will
be advanced, and Taxes paid with∣out
Discontent, because they will
scarce be felt, especially when
equally laid; and in such a Man∣ner,
that every Man shall pay his
Proportion in a Regular way.
If what I have written may be
serviceable to this Honourable House,
I shall think my Time and Labour
well imployed.

That God will direct your Coun∣cels,
to the Advancement of his
Glory, and the Welfare of this
Nation, shall ever be the Prayer of
