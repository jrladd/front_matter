MY LORD,
IN all flourishing Kingdoms throughout the
Universe (especially Islands) honest Merchants
and useful Merchandize have been ever had
in a reverential Esteem. Their Profession in all
former Ages highly magnified, and their
Persons honourably valued: In that by their
Cost, Adventures, Diligence, and Vigilance,
incognite Countries have been discovered, Royal
Amity introduced and confirmed with Transmarine Estates and
Princes: As also (by reason of their generous Examples, and
prevalent Perswasions) very brutish Nations, with barbarous
Natures, have been reduced to Meekness, Order, and Civility.
By Merchants, all Exotick Commodities from every Part of the
World are made communicable in Traffick with us, whose
numerous Varieties, pleasant Rarities, and substantial Necessaries,
serve both for Delight and Profit to the Crown and Kingdom.
They increase Shipping, multiply Navigators, and employ all
Handicrafts. Many of them have not only been the Erectors
of stately Structures, but the Founders of great and famous
Cities. What may be said of Merchants and their Trafficks,
their Antiquity, Dignity, Magnanimity, Generosity and Ur∣banity,
is fitter to fill a Volume, than to be contracted in the
narrow Bondage of a compendious Epistle.
Therefore since Your Lordship hath so ample an Interest in this
precedent Character, it is an especial Act of Almighty Providence,
to indulge and dignifie this Honourable City with such an Ac∣complished
Magistrate, whose Examples and Precepts are both
prudent and pious, and may justly provoke all Persons under Your
Government to be regular and obedient; which although but for
One Year, yet is the Epitome of a Life-time: Thorow which,
that you may have the daily Manuduction of that Great Governour
of Heaven and Earth (the only Ruler of Princes) shall be the
assidual Wishes and devout Desires of, My Lord,
