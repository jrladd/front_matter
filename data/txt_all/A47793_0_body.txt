MADAME,
WHen I consider you a person so much above
your Sex, in the command of those Lan∣guages,
wherein things of this nature
have ordinarily their first birth, and
consequentlie, that what is intended for
the entertainment of others proves your trouble; a Tran∣slation
being no lesse to one that hath read the Original:
When I reflect on your curiosity to look into these things
before they have hardlie taken English aire, as it were to
prevent the earest applications of those who labour in this
kind: When, in fine, it runs into my thoughts, that what
I now bring your Ladyship will haplie have the fate to be
cast by, with, I have long ine read it in the Original,
'tis but poorly done into English; I must confesse my self
guiltie of a strange suspense of resolution, whether I should
venture on this Addresse or no.
You see then, Madam, with what deliberation I presume
to interrupt your divertisement, when, after all this fore∣seen
and acknowledg'd, I offer you what is likely to prove
your importunitie; but I hope you think this confidence the
effect of something more then the assistances of my own cou∣rage.
For, reflecting on your great affection and respects for

the excellent CLEOPATRA, your particular enquiries
after her wellfare and adventures, and the tenderness which
makes you wish the misfortunes of so great a Princess were
at a period, I can think it but just, that the person, from
whom she had, unknown, received those great Civilities,
should accordingly be returned the particular acknowledg∣ments
thereof. These, Madam, I thought motives strong
enough to remove all suspence, and to vindicate the Present
I make you proper for your acceptance; but heightned by a
reflection on the particular favours I have received from
your Ladyship, it may haplie have forced me to some excess,
as whence it might be inferred this confidence proceeded
from a secret encouragement, haplie somewhat of esteem you
are pleased to have for,
Madam,
