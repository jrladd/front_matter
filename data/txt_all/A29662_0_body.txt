I Know full well that it is the design of Parents (that are not thoughtless and altogether improvident) partly by rugality and industry, and sometimes by un∣justifiable wayes, and with the hazzard of their innocence, and violation of thier own peace of Conscience, to acquire estates for their Chil∣dren, that they may look big in the World,
and be more than common Cyphers: The first do well in taking care of their posterity, yet when that care is joyned with too great parsi∣mony, and an over earnest desire to advance their Children high in the worlds esteem, for Riches or Honour; it is a sign they have too great a value for those things, beyond the Rules of Christian Religion: and by design∣ing their Sons to be Gentlemen, they slack their necessary industry, and their honest ingagement in business; give them up to vice and idleness, and expose them to many tem∣ptations, and the subtleties of men, watchful for such opportunities, which an honest cal∣ling, and constant love to business would have freed them from.
The other course of procuring an Estate, is altogether unwarrantable, and is com∣monly cursed, and decayes in the second, or third Generation, if not in the first.

The world as it is ordered has many difficulties in it, The people are very nu∣merous, Trade is overburthened, and all professions almost have too many ingaged in them: Pride and Luxury inforce too great expence, outsides only are esteemed, Tem∣perance and all other Vertues created with man, and injoyed by the founder and first Propagators of the Christian Religion, are much decryed, and of low esteem. Upon consideration of these particulars, though I reckon it my duty, not to enter you into the world bare, and without some competent foundation for your industry, yet do I judge it much more incumbent upon me, and more advantagious to your well being here, and hereafter, to furnish your minds with sound and solid knowledg, that may support you in all states, and conditions: and keep you from those vices that too much swell men in prosperity, and depress them under adversity.

These are my motives of writing the following discourse, which I therefore call A Durable Legacy, because though rich∣es may a thousand wayes fail, yet wisdom will alwayes indure, and will best guide and conduct you through all the rugged paths, which more or less every man meets withal in his passage through this world: I had thought to have conveyed it to you only by writing; but better bethinking my self, that that way might meet with difficulty, and hazzard of its wholly being lost, I have been at the charge of Printing it, with an obli∣gation from him I intrusted with it, that no more than fifty should pass the press, and only for my use: These I purpose to give amongst you my children, that you may transmit them to your posterity, and if that should in time exceed that number, some one amongst you I hope will have so much regard to his Fathers memory, and so just a value for the Contents of the Book as to take care for the reprinting it.

The Counsels and Directions I here give, will concern the well managing of your lives, from the time you are capable of considering what is best for you, to the age wherein you may be more able, than I that advise you, having this help and advantage.
It is intended to make you Wise, and Good: the last I chiefly aim at, the first but in order to it. And indeed he is not to be accounted a wise man, who is not so to himself: Who acquires not knowledge, and makes the chief end of it to be, the well regulating of his mind, so that it tru∣ly understand what is best to be done in all occurrences and exigences of Life; no to secure wealth or honour, but peace of Con∣science, a worthy fame from integrity of Life: for the accomplishment whereof, I take this pains, it being infinitely more de∣sirable to me, to have it said of you that you are wise and just, than that you
are indowed with great Wealth, or Titles; The truest and most intrinsick honour, being that which is an inseparable concomitant of Vertue. And which the Word, will it, nill it, must and doth tacitly acknow∣ledge.
Take not up this Book slightly, as if written with the common design, of fur∣nishing your brain for discourse. 'Tis better not speak, than talk for vain glory, or not for some good or allowable end. Look up∣on it as that which is to be a Reli∣que to your Families: and ponder upon it, as you would upon advice given, if life were in danger.
With the Authority of a Father I injoyn you frequently to take Counsel of it, with the affection of a Father I beseech you: Be assured it was written with a hearty desire of doing you good: Possessions I am not
sure I shall leave you, nor can you be sure to keep them, but Wisdom will teach you how to avoid difficulties, and goodness will inable, you to bear what are una∣voidable.
I would not have you think meanly of this Book for the plainness of the style, it was purposely so writ; with a resolution to de∣cline all subtlety of speech, or curiosity of Language, that no impressions might be made upon you, save what arise from the verity and apparent certainty of its Con∣tents: It is falshood, imposture, and the delusive opinions of the world, that need, and are usually supported by the artifice of words.
In matters dubious and opinionative, though I have thought fit to declare my judgment, and acquaint you with the reasons and grounds that have inclined me; yet I would not have you therefore give up your assents
thereunto, for Paternal Authority does not extend so far; but for what is plain, and agreeable to the rules of Vertue, and Gods Sacred Word, and therefore universally acknowledged, here you are bound up, and obliged in your lives to a strict observation thereof.
I have not writ it methodically, with dependance of one Chapter upon another; nor does the nature of the Subjects bear it: Besides my business in the world has been much, especially in my own profession; I have writ it by piece-meal, and as the several subjects came into my mind, and therefore 'tis no wonder they they have no dependence one upon another: They may each be separately considered, as need shall require, and the Table direct. Methods are for what is Scholastical, written for Sale, and Fame; neither of which are by me intended. Besides I never purpose it shall go abroad, and therefore the home∣liness
of the dress attended with truth's plain∣ness will not misbecome it.
I design it also as well for my Daugh∣ters as my Sons: though some things there∣in are peculiar to men, yet much of it is of equal concernment to the Female Sex, who also may have male Children, and as they are mine, I allow them an equal title to it: Women of middling quality esteem things worthy, rather more than men, are generally less vitious, better guarded with modesty, have less temptations, and a great love to Vertue and Goodness, give an easier assent to what is just, unless biassed by their Husbands interest, or prevailing power: And therefore I intend this Book as much for them as my Sons: not doubt∣ing but that they will, and that more fre∣quently peruse it, more deliberately and seriously weigh the contents of it, because their business will not be so much, nor their diversions so frequent, as those of my
Sons: I bestow it therefore with a like alacrity and expectation upon them, and expect at least answerable fruits as from my male Children.
Lastly, let no imputation remain upon me, if I have in the progress of this Book mentioned the same things upon several oc∣casions more than once; for being I was it may be, two or three years in writing it, it is no wonder if my memory did not retain the sense of the whole: Tautologies in this case are not so disallowable, the intention being good, and the matter necessary.
May it have an influence upon your minds, suitable to the affectionate desires of my heart, that you may be no dis∣honour to your Country, nor no ble∣mish to your Family: That however others demean themselves, it may be truly said, that you all, and your Families will serve the Lord, in truth
and sincerity of heart, in all Godliness, and Honesty, and so my blessing be up∣on you all, and the blessing of him who is the Author of all Beings, the Eter∣nal God.
