His Majesties Principal Secreiary of State, of his most honourable Privy Council; and Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter, &c.

MY LORD,
Tis become the mode of this writing age, to trouble Per∣sons

of the highest Rank, not only with the Real Productions of Wit; but (if so I may be allowed to speak) with the trifles and follys of it; hardly dos an ill Play come forth without a Dedication to some great Lady, or man of Honour; and all think themselves sufficiently secure, if they can obtain but the least pretence of Authority to cover their imperfections: My Lord, I am sensible of mine: but they concern only my self, and can never lessen the dignity of a Subject, which the best of Poets, and per∣haps

the greatest Wits too, have celebrated with just applause.
I know not how, my Lord, I may have succeeded with this adven∣ture, in an age so nice and re∣fin'd, but the Die is cast, and I had rather expose my selfe to the for∣tune of it, then loose an occasion of acknowledging your Lordships fa∣vours, which as they have oblig'd the Father, so ought they to com∣mand the gratitude of the Son: nor must I forget to acquaint your Lordship, that the Author of this Poem address'd it to one of the most

Eminent Persons in France; and it were unhappy if it should not meet with the same good Fortune in England; I am sure the origi∣ginal deserves it, which though it may have lost much of its Lustre by my Translation, will yet recover its credit with advantage, by ha∣ving found in your Lordship so Illu∣strious a Patron. Great Men have in all Ages bin favourable to the Muses, and done them honour; and your Lordship, who is the true Mo∣del of Virtue and Greatness, can∣not but have the same inclinations.

for the delights which adorn, those Titles; especially, when they are innocent, and useful, and excellent, as this Poem is pro∣nounced to be by the Suffra∣ges of the most discerning; I had else my Lord, suppress'd my ambition of being in Pring, and setting up for a Poet, which is neither my talent nor design: But my Lord, to importune you no further, this peice presumes not to intrude into your Cabinet, but to wait upon you in your Gardens at Euston, where, if when your

Lordships more weighty affairs give leave, you vouchsafe to di∣vert your self with the first Blos∣soms of my Youth, they may by the instuence of your Lordships fa∣vour, one day produce fruits of more maturity, and worthy the obla∣tion of
My Lord,
