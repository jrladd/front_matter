MY Lord, ha∣uing nothing but two mites with the poor widdowe wo∣man, to cast into your Trea∣surie, euen the seruice of the body and the minde, and the whole man, a tribute that of duety is due vnto your Lord∣ship: seeing I am iustly char∣ged with this oblation, I hope your Honour will acquite mee
of presumption, both vse and liuely feeling, giuing mee pro∣tection: vse wyth every tenant to pay his Landlord rent, and sensible feelyng of your Lord∣ships bounty, iustly extorting this as my bounden duty. Our Lorde forbid, that we receiue a benefit, as a beast his dyet, and neuer respect and beholde the founder of it. My master Christ,Iohn 6 who commanded the fragments of a benefit bestow∣ed vpon an hungry people, to be gathered vp in baskets: in∣sinuateth thereby, that the ba∣sest benefit that is done vpon
vs, should not be forgotten. Hauing therefore so deepely dyued into your Lordshippes debt, how can I not but drawe from as deep thoughts, as euer any water was drawne from Iacobs well, the memoriall of your goodnes.Iohn 4 Since it pleased your Honor by the ryght wor∣shipfull sir Hierome Bowes Knight, the onely worldely arch, and supporter of my e∣state, to take sight of my poore person, and honourable com∣miseration of my afflicted con¦dition. If I make no relation of your Honors most christian
clemencie when J drewe my breath but faintly, how I had recouery, and regained free recourse to my woonted study: If I rip not vp the circumstan¦ces of your zealous fauors, J doe but as Salomon wyth the brasse in the Temple, who be∣cause it was so massie, hee would not stand to weigh it: or as Portius Latro who engra∣ued in his minde, that which others ingrossed in a booke.
This pretious pearle of the worde of God, which shineth, which way soeuer you turne it, and flieth vnto all, I haue
wrapped vp in this little ma∣nuel, and fastned it vnto your Honors vertuous name, as vnto a ribband and golden Chayne that will keepe it the better. Your Lordship haue alwayes worne it about you, and haue bound it as a Signet vnto your hand, and with the faithful Congregation of Co∣losse haue suffered it aboun∣dantly to dwell in your heart: whenas with most worldlings, Gods worde, as the Leuite that went to Gibea wandreth in the streetes, and haue but slender entertainement
among men. I encourage my selfe, that GOD will geue a blessing to these labours, that the argument it self wil draw heartes vnto it: and you my Honorable Patrone will be a sufficient protection to my per¦son. God almighty euery way prosper your Honour, double your honour and dayes among vs, and giue you all honor in his heauenly kingdome.
