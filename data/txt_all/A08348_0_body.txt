Warre is that highest, wor∣thiest, and most commodious Science that great Princes ought to preferre before all others, were it but for Cicero his reason, Vt sine iniu∣ria in pace viuamus; Peace being by instinct of Na∣ture of all men most desired, And warre by the greatest Emperours and Princes of the world euer with Sword and Pen most highly magnified, ingenuously finding there∣in innumerable inuentions, and diuers subtill secrets, and admirable deuices, Engins and Stratagems to ouer∣come their Enemies with; yet none comparable to the Art and Practice of Artillery, comprehending in it the greatest matter of importance of our Militia at this day. And fin∣ding also (Great Duke) many ardent magnanimous minds to coole, for want of speculation to inuent, and diuers He∣roike actions to passe by vnatchieued, for want of practice to performe, I, the meanest of many, hauing with long
practice, and no small study, and some cost, beene somewhat instructed and conuersant therein; and seeing the penury of expert Gunners, and vnderstanding men, and the weaknesse of the present meanes to breed more hereafter, I haue for aid formerly offered my poore Talent, called the Art, and the Practice of Artillery. And now also depending vpon your Graces fauour, presume to offer these few lines, called the Gunners Dialogue, vnder your Excellencies Patronage, as well to further others therein, as herein to shew some part of my thankfulnesse for your Graces fauour, that it pleased you to imploy my seruice, were it but to view and censure other mens workes (I be∣ing not naturally scrutinous) wherein I protest I faithfully related to your Grace, my poore opinion truly, if not iudi∣ciously, the effect, if they be put in practice will manifest, but certainly cleere it was from all partiality or enuy, as might appeare by my preferring Salinors Booke Lesson, he a Forreiner, before my Country man Iones his vnexperi∣enced inuentions, both strangers to my acquaintance. Ac∣cept therefore, I beseech your Excellencie, this small vn∣worthy Present; so shall I be encouraged with your High∣nesse fauour and leaue, to publish my Treble Archite∣cture, Ciuill, Military, and Marine, almost ready for the Presse; if these speed with fauour, which will imprest my seruices, to attend your Graces future pleasure, and en¦gage me to rest
