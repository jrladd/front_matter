THou City of London, I am one of thy sons by freedome, and I do truly
love thy peace; while I had an estate in thee, I was free to offer my Mite
into thy publike Treasury Guild-hall, for a preservation to thee, and the
whole Land; but by thy cheating sons in the theeving art of buying and sel∣ling,
and by the burdens of, and for the Souldiery in the beginning of the war,
I was beaten out both of estate and trade, and forced to accept of the good
will of friends crediting of me, to live a Countrey-life, and there likewise
by the burthen of Taxes and much Free-quarter, my weak back found the
burthen heavier then I could bear; yet in all the passages of these eight yeers
troubles I have been willing to lay out what my Talent was, to procure En∣glands
peace inward and outward, and yet all along I have found such as in
words have professed the same cause, to be enemies to me. Not a full yeere
since, being quiet at my work, my heart was filled with sweet thoughts, and
many things were revealed to me which I never read in books, nor heard

and must die, for action is the life of all, and if thou dost not act, thou
dost nothing. Within a little time I was made obedient to the word in that
particular likewise; for I tooke my spade and went and broke the ground
upon George-hill in Surrey, thereby declaring freedome to the Creation, and
that the earth must be set free from intanglements of Lords and Landlords,
and that it shall become a common Treasury to all, as it was first made and
given to the sonnes of men: For which doing the Dragon presently casts a
flood of water to drown the manchild, even that freedom that now is de∣clared,
for the old Norman Prerogative Lord of that Mannour M Drake, cau∣sed
me to be arrested for a trespasse against him, in digging upon that barren
Heath, and the unrighteous proceedings of Kingstone Court in this businesse
I have here declared to thee, and to the whole land, that you may consider
the case that England is in; all men have stood for freedom, thou hast kept
fasting daies, and prayed in morning exercises for freedom; thou hast given
thanks for victories, because hopes of freedome; plentie of Petitions and
