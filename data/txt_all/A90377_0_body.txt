MADAM,
IT will be no small addition to all your great Titles and o∣ther Excellencies, that you have been so careful to preserve, & now command to be published, these elegant Poems; Neither could your Ladiship have employed one that would bave more willingly obeyed your Commands, I having been obliged to that Honora∣ble

Family, not only by descent, but am by many favours now bound to that Person, who is Heir to all their Virtues as well as Fortunes. The Church that covers his sacred ashes, must submit to time, and at last lye buried with him; But this Monument that your La∣diship hath erected to his memory, will out-last the Calculation of all Astro∣logers; who though they could foretell the time that he should leave us, could set no Date to the Fame that he should leave behind him; which, though it have lain aslecp in all this noise of Drums and Trumpets, when all the Muses seemed to be fled, and to have left no∣thing behind them, but a few lame Iam∣bicks, canting at the corners of our de∣solate

streets; yet they are now content to be awakened by your Ladiships com∣mand, & under your Patronage to come abroad, and meet, and salute that peace that gave them their first being, and to tell the World, that what-ever was ex∣cellently said to any Lady in all these Poems, was meant of you; and that the Poet himself being inspired by your La∣diship, you only that are extracted from an ancient and Royal Family, have the Right and power to give life and perpetuity to so noble a person.
MADAM,
