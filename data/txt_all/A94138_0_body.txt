Sir,
Iunii 18. 1645. I received from you a Thing called, The Souldiers Catechisme, composed for the Parlia∣ments Army, written by R. Ram, Minister of Spalding in Lincolne∣shire; you desired me to answer it, because it had done some Disservice to the King, as is supposed, in misleading some simple soules.
I have read it and beleive the supposition; and for present answer returne you the same Title, with this alteration onely, Composed for the Kings Army; certainely perswading my selfe that this truth (and it is nothing else but truthy may reduce those whom his False∣hood
hath seduced; yet promising you, if so you will have it, speedily to answer his verbatim, and largely, which is here done onely in sense and breifely; yet fully I imagine for the ser∣vice abovesaid, namely, To reclaime my Coun∣trymen to their ancient obedience, which is your and all good mens desire, and amongst them,
Sir,

Junii 19. 1645.
