RIGHT HONORABLE,
I Present not these rude lines, thereby to beg protection; for if they be not able to stand of themselves, I de∣sie they should no be supported by others; but onely because some years agoe a short draught of them was brought to your hands, and your Honour was then pleased to judge it worthy of your view and consideration, which makes me bold to mind you of what then I intimated unto you, which was and is thus much, That seeing divine Providence hath made you (with the rest of those faithfull and gallant men of the Army) signally instrumental, both in redeeming the Eng∣lish Liberty, almost downed in the deluge of Ty∣ranny and self interest, and also unmanacling the simple and pure truth of the Gospel, from the chins and fetters of cold and dead Formality, and of restrictive and compulsary Power, two of the greatest blessings our Nation ever yet enjoyed, I hope the same Providence will also direct you to be assistant to continue the se, against all the bitterness and cruelty of those, who, having obtain∣ed liberty for themselves, care not though others be bound up and persecuted, And moreover guide

you to set to your hand and endeavour for the pur∣ging and reforming of Academies, and the ad∣vancement of Learning, which hitherto hath been little promoted or look'd into. And I am the more imboldned in this confidence, having ex∣perimental knowledge and trial, not onely of your Honours Abilities that way, but also of your sin∣cere affection and unparalleld love to Learning, and to all those that are lovers and promoters ther∣of; which have been the principal motives to incite me to tender this rude Essay, and these few unpolish'd lines to your profound and mature judgement, which, besides the good will of the Au∣thor, have little in them worthy your deliberate consideration: Yet I suppose, if rightly weighed and examined, there will appear something in them of necessary consequence for the promoting of Lear∣ning, or at least to stir up some more able wits to make a stiny into these things that are here controvered, which is the greatest aim of my flag∣ging desires. Bu lst while I speak for truth and Learning, I may speak my self in stead thereof, which is natures epidemical disease, and in not glo∣rying may seem to glory, I only leave them to your Honours jure, and my self
