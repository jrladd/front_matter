Madam,
HAving had the Honour to be serviceable to your Devotions, by Preaching in your Royal Chappel, on the Anniver∣sary Remembrance of your Royal Grand-father of blessed Memory; and received your gracious Approbation of my Sermon then, and your Commands since to publish it, for the benefit of them who could not croud in to hear it: It would be a Protestation against that Obedience which I press'd upon others as their Duty, if I should not rea∣dily give up it, and my self, in all Humility, to your Service.

As many as shall think fit to peruse it, will here find recommended two of the greatest Examples of Zeal and Piety; of Patience and Constancy; the first Chri∣stian Martyr St. Stephen, and the first Christian Prince who ever sealed his Religion with his Blood; concerning whom, I hope I have said enough to con∣vince the Reader, that Death and the Grave have no power over his immortal Name; that the sharpest Sword of his most malicious Enemies cannot wound it, nor the venom of Adders poyson it. His Body lyes buried in a peaceable obscurity, but His Fame is Immortal like his Soul, and his righteousness shall be had in everlasting remembrance; and that his Enemies are now as ridiculous and vile, as they would have rendred the Christian Religion. God hath shewed them to the World, to be the very Persons they were, and the subtile Artifices of their wicked Contrivances, upon which they wrote his Name, to be the Suggesti∣ons of their Father the Devil; he hath rescued his, and the King's Glory, out of their Hands; nor shall they be able again to invest Impiety and Injustice with the Titles of his Providence and Spirit. I hope, we shall never live to see the Defender of the Faith any more destroyed for Conscience-sake, as we did that Glorious Martyr, of whom the World was not worthy. His Blood does still run in your Royal Veines; and you have prov'd your self to have such an eminent share of his Piety hitherto, that we have no reason to questi∣on,
 but you will continue a Glorious Pattern of the same to your Lives end, and remain constant in that truly Catholick Religion, for which he dyed; for your adherence to which, your Fame is already so deservedly Great in these Kingdoms; in which Faith, that you may stedfastly continue, until your Graces be Crown'd with Eternal Glory, you have the dayly Prayers of,
MADAM,
