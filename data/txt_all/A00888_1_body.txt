MADAME:
I Am bold to adde one Booke more to your Li∣brary, though it be but as a Mite into your Trea∣surie. I that haue found you so euer fauourable to any worke of mine, cannot but confidently hope your acceptance of this. Not for the worth of it, but because it beares your Name (and my dutie to it) in the forehead, and of∣fers it selfe to the world, through your Patro∣nage.

They that know you, know your apprehension quicke, your Iudgement sound; and (that which graceth all the rest) your affections religiously deuoted. Yet since it is no small part of our goodnesse, to know that wee may be better, I presume to present this Booke, and (with it) my owne dutie to your Ladiship, the poore testimonie of my present thankefulnesse, and pledge of my future seruice. The God of Power and Mercie continue his Fauours to you; who haue still continued your fauours to
