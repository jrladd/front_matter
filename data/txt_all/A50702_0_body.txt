SIR,
AStrology, as it is a Noble Science, (and therefore fit for the Study of the Noblest of Persons) hath this Misfortune commonly attends it, viz. to sink and suffer for want of Noble Advocates and Pro∣tectors. Therefore it is (Learned Sir) that I am thus presumptuous to shelter my mean Endeavours in that worthy Science, (in opposition to one that hath abu∣sed it) under your gentle Patronage, being assured that both Mine & the Adversaries Arguments will be justly weighed and considered by your more curious Judgment, under which I am most willing to stand or fall. Your exquisite Skill in this Learning is such, that thereby, like the thrice Excellent Knight Sir Christopher Hey∣don, (who defended Astrology so happily in the last Age) you are able to judge and distinguish between Mr. Holwel's bold and fallacious dealing, under pre∣tence of explaining the meaning of the triple Conjun∣ction of Saturn, and Jupiter in Leo, wherewith he hath encouraged Mahomet, and crucified our Saviour afresh, and my humble Pains and Apology for the promotion of Christian Courage, and imbasing of Turkish Pow∣er, in expounding the same Conjunction.
Be not offended, (I pray Sir) if I am bold to tell

the World, and your Honoured Self together, that you are the only Person of Loyalty, (that I know of) fit to be my Judge in this Matter, as having for many years, among other Nobler Employments, diverted your self also with this abstruse Science, even before the hap∣py Restauration of his most Sacred Majesty, and all the Royal Party, and by your well-grounded Confidence therein, you kept many of Them (when beyond Sea) from desponding, with your , and an Assu∣rance of the Return of Monarchy into England again; which more than common Presage was (to Yours and Astrologies Honour) happily verified in the year 1660. and for the Hopes you conceived of that happy Year, you affirmed your Loyalty, even in the worst of Times, thereby hazarding your Self to become a Victim for the Truth you had so happily avowed. Nay, so ob∣liging a Patron and Maecenas have You been, to the Glories of Urania, that to your Pains and Search all the Sons of Art owe the Knowledge of that Illustri∣ous Geniture of the Great Carolus Gustavus, late King of Sweden, which you, Sir, first transmitted out of Ger∣many into England, at that time when the victorious Arms of that King were the Astonishment of almost all Christendom: Which hapning into the Hands of my worhy Friend, Mr. John Gadbury, by making some Remarks upon, and printing it, (as I have heard Him say) was one of the principal Causes of His (as he was pleased to call it, Little but envied) Fame in the World; so happy have You been to Art and Artists, even

then unknown to You, as if You were born to befriend not only Astrology it self, but all its honest Professors too.
Neither let me forget to mention it; That You (Honoured Sir) in our now later Times of Confusion and Disorder, have stood firm to your Principles, in adhe∣ring and paying Homage to that Monarchy, whose Re∣turn, by this Art, you had happily encouraged; and are also the only Person of your Name and Family, that have shew'd your Loyalty by Addressing, when it was little less than Treason against that Monster the Republican, and Antimonarchical Interest, so to do, and you have dared to own and to teach the World this Maxim, That Loyalty to the King, and a dutiful Regard to His Royal Highness, are inseparable. Pardon (good Sir) my Freedom in mentioning these Things, (for loyal Actions no more than loyal Persons, ought never to be forgotten) and ex∣cuse my humble Boldness, in making use of your No∣ble Name, and give me leave to end all with this cordial Vote, viz. That Monarchy may have more such Friends, and Astrology more such Defenders: So prayeth, (ever Ho∣noured Sir)
