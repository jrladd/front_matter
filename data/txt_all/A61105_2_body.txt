Noble Sir,
IT was your favour to make me your Chaplain at Brom∣ley, when I was so flieblown by some of Baalzebubs swarm, that I resolved upon privacy, rather then publick imploiment. But by your goodnesse I was brought to light again, and have found a little Zoar to secure me in the com∣mon combustion, yet not without some envy, though I have nothing about me worthy envy, save the love of my friends, the effect whereof is by envy so much obstructed, that my next remove must be like Lot, to a cave, or my
grave. In the mean time, Sir, I pray except of this poor mite of my thankfulnesse, which is an abstract of my la∣bours bestowed on my loving Parishioners of Bromley, to whom you commended me, and them to me; for which benignity I shall for ever rest,
SIR,
