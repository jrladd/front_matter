Honoured Sir,
WHereas by the All-disposing hand of the Almighty, this Sermon had its birth in your hearing, of which your Worship was pleased to manifest your favourable ac∣ceptance, now being importuned to publish the same, I thought it but equall, it

should againe returne to your selfe, as an humble and thankfull acknowledgement of all your many and great kindnesses both to me and mine, and the rather because your former acceptance was no small incouragement hereunto. Kind Sir, the experience that I have of your wonted benignitie, gives me rather assurance then hope that you will not value the same by the imperfections of the worke or writer; but by the weighty matter, of e∣ternall concernment, for every soule contained therein; and by the good will of him who sincere∣ly desires the present prosperity and eternall feli∣city of you and yours; Who is also
London, Septem. 20.
