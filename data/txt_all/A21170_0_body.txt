DEere Sir the titles resyant to your state,
Meritorious due: because my penne is statelesse,
I not set downe, nor will I straine it foorth,
To tilt against the Sunne, with seeming speeches,
Suffizeth all are ready and awaite,
With their hartes-soule, and Artes perswasiue mistresse,
To tell the louely honor, and the worth,
Of your deseruing praise, Heroicke graces:
What were it then for me to praise the light?
When none, but one, commendes darke shady night.


Then as the day is made to shame the sinner,
To staine obscuritie, inur'd supposes,
And mainetaine Artes inestimable treasure,
To blind-fold Enuie, barbarisme scorning.
O with thy fauour, light a young beginner,
From margining reproach, Satyricke gloses,
And gentle Sir, at your best pleasing leysure,
Shine on these cloudy lines, that want adorning,
That I may walke, where neuer path was seene,
In shadie groues, twisting the mirtle greene.
