May it please your Honours,
IT is a curious Art to make a Watch, and he must be a skilful Artist, that exactly sets a broken Bone, God for the sins of this Na∣tion, hath several times in this Age, took the Clock of this Common-wealth in pieces, and many of the pins and wheels have bin and are misplaced. It now requires great skill, to place and set every thing in its due order.
Your Honours have a great work to do, God hath broken us in pieces, and divided our Councels, and none can unite us, but he that hath wounded us, he only must cure us, and bless and sanctifie all lawful means, or
 else our disjoynted bones will never be truly knit, or exactly set.
For this end hath God apointed a select num∣ber of honourable persons, of which number your Honours are Members, whose heart God hath fixed for this great Work, to revive the stones out of the heap of rubbish, and to build the Walls of our Jerusalem, though the Sanballats, Arabians and Ammonites be worth, and conspire altogether to fight against Jerusalem, to hinder this VVork.
Right Honourable, if you will finish this good VVork you have begun, you must do as Nehemiah did, keep good watch day and night, because of your enemies, lest your ad∣versaries serve you, as they served Nehemiah, for they say you shall not know nor see till we come in the midst amongst them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease, if this be not prevented, this Parliament will have a fatal end.
Presidents in Courts of Justice is a great Guide to all just Judges, especially when they have been made by the Grave and Learned,
 and are recorded in the Sacred Bible, the chiefest Book that every good Statesman walks by; such Statesmen that walks by Ma∣chiavels rules, the wicked Maximes of these troublesom times, they do as Saul did when he left God, and went to the VVitch of Endor, he pretended to go to speak with Sa∣muel, and met with the devil, so these times have produced many a Fast, the pretence hath bin to seek God and Peace, when the true end hath bin to get to be the Head of a Party and Faction, to make division, and to get the Peoples money: The People are now very well acquainted with such canting, and as we know after a flash of lightning, there comes a clap of thunder, so hath it ma∣ny times fallen out, after Fasts hath followed an erecting of an High Court of Justice, or one remarkable oppression or other.
I humbly present you here in this Epistle, with a good President made by a great Statesman Nehemiah, such a one as God hath recorded was a Saviour of his Countrey, a Builder up of Jerusalem, in the like case, and
 in the like straits as it is now, or suddenly without Gods infinite mercy will be vvith us, he took this course. In the first place, he sought God, and prayed before the God of Heaven, and did not make a mock-Fast; then he used the means, he fell to his VVork, and built up the walls of Jerusalem, and did not only build, but he built wisely and poli∣tickly, and had there bin a Sanballat found amongst them, the people would have stoned him.
On the lovver places behind the vvall, and on the higher places, he set the people after their families, vvith their svvords, their spears and their bovves; and vvhen he had set him∣self in a posture of defence, he made the peo∣ple to be his Guard, and delivered an Orati∣on to the Rulers and People, saying, Be not afraid of your enemies, remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sonnes and your daughters, your wives and your houses.
I shall humbly desire your Honours to ob∣serve, vvhat vvas the effect of this orderly
 and good posture. Nehemiah and his peo∣ple did not their work carelessely and by halfes, and spent their precious time in need∣lesse questions, but did all things upon sound advice. For when great things are quietly without Faction disputed, and the Result con∣cluded; then to use expedition and resoluti∣on is just policie.
But all hasty and unadvised attempts at long running brings the Common-wealth in∣to great danger, and the Actors generally in∣to contempt and misery, many men in their designes thinking to catch a great Fish, but after long angling bring up a Frog; this daily experience hath shewed, and I can experi∣mentally say it to be true.
For those men that read Machiavel, and make it their Rule to walk by, in stead of the Bible, because they are in great places, to practice Iniquity by a Law, as Ahab did for Naboths Viniard, who did not only cheat him of his Land and Inheritance, but robbed him of his Life, and to seem holy called a Fast, the effect of that godly Fast was to set two
 mens sonns of Belial, to beare false witnesse that Naboth had Bsasphemed God and the King, sending a warrant for the Execution of innocent Naboth before ever they tryed him, that he should be ston'd to death right or wrong, what a sad End the Authors of this murder and robbery come to is well known, how many great and Noble Persons of the eminentest for quality in this Nation, have bin Trappaned and perjured out of their Lifes, Lands and Estates, and some of the witnesses upon their Death beds with horrour of Conscience, and great Remorse have con∣fessed the perjury that they were suborned by others, to the great scandal of the Justice of the Nation by such waies to get mens Estates.
This is most apparent God is comming to visit for these things, and when man cannot bring the Delinquents to Justice, he causeth the guilty Persons one to punish another, till by the dividing and subdividing they are so weak, that as the flood cam upon the old world and destroyed mankinde, so by these divisions
 the strength of the Nation is disjoynted. Every man upon and against his Neigh∣bour, making a passage and way for the com∣mon Enemy to come and swallovv the Inno∣cent with the guilty, if God be not mercifull.
Moses divided the Red-Sea, and the Children of Israel passed over on dry Land, God hath by nature made a Sea betvveen us and our Neighbours, he hath hedged us in, and made a vvall of seperation between us and Popery, but our sins at this day are pluck∣ing down this wall, the wilde Bore of the For∣rest is come in amongst us, the Devil and the Jesuites have plaid their parts in this Nation, to the ruining of many Body and Soul, and to the admiration of Christendom, the Jewes Crucified Christ thinking to gratifie Caesar, Caesar a few years after paid them to purpose for Crucifying him.
May it please your Honours, The ten Com∣mandements and Fonts for christning of children at the beginning of these Troubles were plucked down; and now comes Pulpits to be beaten in pie∣ces, and frequent tumults in several Churches
 within the city of London, as lately at Ald∣gate parish hath bin done, which is a corner of the city, where many poor live, and are fit for any Insurrection.
When I see children with a candle amongst powder or chips, I feare the burning of the house, or a blow with powder; when wee see the buds ap∣peare, the spring is near: these are as certaine signes of a mischief; as the plague-tokens are to a man that hath the Plague, the best symptomes are a purple fever; a shaking, an earth-quake, if not a dissolution. The pride and vanity of some Lecturers and Ministers, who in the Nation having studyed points of dissention and division, in¦stead of the Gospel of Christ preach themselves, (too much plenty have made them wanton.)
No doubt but some of them do it with the ad∣vice of the Iesuits to make a separation in Coun∣tryes, Cities, Townes, Parishes and Families, till without Gods infinite mercy, the Iesuits bring a destruction both on the Churches and hou∣ses of the Nation, and on this Great Citie of London, and set every man to cut one anothers throats. Would not the end of these things bring
 an unhappy deformation, instead of a blessed Re∣formation, when we are exposed to the fury of a forein Enemy by the vileness of the Iesuits, and folly of our own Divisions?
What a divelish State trick vvas put upon the late Protector Oliver, and his Secretary Mr. Thurloe, by Sir Kenelm Digby, and several other Persons Jesuitically inclined, in setting the Protector on that fatal businesse of Hispa∣niola and Jamaica, without ever advising and consulting with many of the English Prote∣stant Planters, who had for many years lived in those parts, and had they had the honour to have been consulted with, they could have told them that those fiery Regions was not for the constitution of our bodies.
That Fox and subtile Statesman Sir Ke∣nelme Digby, his very name should have bin fatall to the Protestants cause, if the Lord Protector Oliver and Mr. Thurloe would have bin pleased to remember the Gun-pow∣der treason.
This fatal designe of Jamaica cost the Pro∣tector and the Commonwealth above tvvo
 millions of pounds, beside the lives of above twentie thousand valiant Englishmen, destroy∣ed by the unhealthfulness of the Climate, and want of necessary Provisions; and when these valiant men were almost famisht, (who had they bin in any part of Christendom, the Spaniards durst not have look't them in the face, had they bin twice their number,) yet these gallant Souldiers were all like sheep led to the slaughter, and their blood spilt like wa∣ter on the ground, by the treachery of some of their Officers, who no doubt had private instructions from some then in power to do what they did, which upon examination was the cause they kept their heads upon their shoulders, and escap't both with lives and e∣states.
May it please your Honours, I hope your Honours will pardon these sad and necessarie truths, proceeding from a loyal heart. I have formerly ventured my life many times to get the Common-wealth two hundred seventie eight thousand pounds in money, I now ven∣ture my self in these dangerous times to speak
 truth. It is now as it was in the daies of Noah; no man but Noah and his Familie believ'd a flood would come, till it did come and sweep them all away.
And if I be justly used, I may now in your streights bring you in presently as great a sum in money again as I saved you formerly abov three hundred thousand pounds, fevv of the Council of State when I undertook to disco∣ver the Spanish Ambassadors fraudulent claim to this Silver, I say there was but few of that Council did believe that I could ever get the State this Silver, or that I would be so faithful to refuse ten thousand pounds which was offe∣red me by the Claimers of this Silver, which is certified in this Book by severall honourable Persons to be true, should I bend my braines as much to study the disturbance of this Common-wealth, as I have ever done the peace and happiness of it, I could Demonstrate to you, a pen and Inkhorne-man as I am can do more service or disservice then many hundreds of Red-coats, I humbly pray my faithfulnesse be not paid with Ingratitude.

As for my own life, I desire to have it no longer preserv'd then I can serve and benefit my Countrey. I will wait on God, and ex∣spect an happie issue upon this my humble request, knowing that if the Reputation and Iustice of the State, and the Certificates of honorable persons be of any value in your Honours sight, my great expence, pains and faithfulness, shall have its due and promised Reward; considering that in these humble Proposals which I have propounded to your Honours for my satisfaction, I take no money from the publick, but humbly offer to pay in monethly a great Revenue to the maimed Souldiers, to regulate the abuses of the Ma∣nufacture of Gold and Silver Thread and Lace, to give a stop to the Transportation of Gold and Silver, to keep your Mint constant∣ly at work to coyn money, great quantities yearly: all which services are of very great consequence to the Common-wealth, the consideration of the premisses I humbly leave to your Honours, and remain
