MADAM,
BY the Divine Providence, which disposes all things wise∣ly and charitably, you are in the affections of your No∣blest Lord Successor to a very dear and most Excellent person, & designed to fill up those offices of Piety to her dear pledges, which the hast which God made to glorify and secure her would not permit her to finish. I have much ado to re∣frain from telling great stories of her Wisdom, Piety, Judgment, Sweet∣ness, and Religion; but that it would renew the wound, and make our sins bleed afresh at the memory of that dear Saint: and we hope that much of the storm of the Divine anger is over, because he hath repaired the breach by sending you to go on upon her account, and to give coun∣tenance and establishment to all those Graces which were warranted and derived from her example.

You may observe, but cannot blame, my ambition; so long as it is instanced in a religious service, and means nothing but this, that I may signifie how much I honour that Person who is designed to bring new Blessings to that Family which is so Honourable in it self, and for so many reasons dear to me.
