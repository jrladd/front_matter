RIGHT HONOVRABLE, &c. Although the obscurenes both of my selfe and merits, may seeme to breed some preiudice of boldnes and pre∣sumption in me, daring thus to pre∣sent my selfe, and a small worke of mine equall in merit to my selfe, to you a Heroe indued with no lesse Goodnesse, than greatnes, of equall Vertue and Honor, Of a like Courage & Courtesie, of as much Clemencie as Valour, Paralels that siel∣dome meet in one.
Yet Fame the blazer of good Actions, resound∣ing from yours, to our Coasts, the report of your Honourable Courtesie and loue to good Endea∣uours, I haue bin emboldned by this small Present, to manifest the loue, or rather seruice I owe to your selfe and Honourable Name; a Name no lesse knowne and renowned Abroad, than loued
 and honored at Home, as terrible to foes, as gtate∣full and pleasing vnto friends. And although the Noblenes of your honorable and ancient Progeny with the noble and Warlike actions of your Va∣lorous and renowned Father & Ancestors might yeild to you, their generous Of-spring, sufficient cause of praise & glory; yet you knowing, that the good parts of body, or prosperous casualties of good Fortune, can scarce bee called or accounted our own; you I say to these haue added Vertue, the beauty & strength of mind, knowing that Nobili∣tas sola est atque unica virtus. This hath made you Non tibi sed toti genetum te credere mundo Go on thē generous Gordon, and by attaining the height of Vertue, obtaine the top of honour; Be you a Gem in the Vnion of Great Brittaine, follow the foot∣steps of your renowned Father, and if it be possible in vertue out goe him; and according to your ge∣nererous disposition accept this small Present of your humble wel-wisher, the gratious acceptance of which shal stir me vp to some greater endeavor wherby to eternize your Name and Vertues.
Sola{que} non norint haec monumenta mori.
