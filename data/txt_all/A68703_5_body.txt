THe folly which in man with wit is fixt,
Must needes haue pleasant things with wholesome mixt;
Else Nature loath it. Homers frogs and mise
Instructs Achilles: Virgil is not nice
Totue an Oten pipe. These toyes I send:
Accept; to please, and profit is my end.

Sic paruis componere magna solebam. Virgi.
