I Have presumed to dedicate these my labours unto you, Right noble sir, the off-spring and undoubted Heire of my
 noble friend your father de∣ceased; and inheritour of his Lands and Livings, and the chiefe of that great and re∣nowned family. And as you doe inherit his Lands and Livings, so my prayer is, that you may inherit him in his integrity, zeale, & wisdome. I speak not this out of doubt∣full feare, but in officious love; and herein take no∣tice, I beseech you, of this happinesse and blessing of God, cast upon you, not only to be the chiefe of this great and worthy family; but al∣so take notice of the true cause of the worth and great∣nesse of your Ancestours, and
 imitate them therein, and then inheriting their worth together with their wealth, you shall also most undoub∣tedly enrich your selfe with the obsequious attendance and hearty affection of your native Countrymen, and so grow in grace and favour with God and man. For which cause I have presu∣med to present you with this Tractate, and to publish the same under the protection of your name, hoping of your courteous acceptance; and beseeching you to grant it your favourable protection and Patronage: which though it be but indifferent∣ly
 contrived, yet strongly warranted, for it hath the undoubted truth of God for its authority. There may be many Tractates found ten∣ding to these ends; but all that I have seene of others, though they may bee more pithy, yet certaine I am, this is more plaine; I trust not unpleasant, nor unprofitable. God give all grace to make right use of it. And so commending my labours, with all the desired good that may be unto your good Worship, and both you and it to the speciall grace and protection of the Almighty, who is aboundantly able to
 fill your heart with grace, to crowne your daies with blessing, and to finish them with eternall comfort, life, and glory, Amen. I rest, a true desirer of your best good,

October 22. 1638.
