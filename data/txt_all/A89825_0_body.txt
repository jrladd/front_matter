Honoured Sir,
THere be two Rea∣sons, why this Stranger presu∣meth to address himself to you. The one is to take Sanctuary under the Patronage of your honoured name. For, though he be no Grand Delinquent, nor guilty

of any such offence, that he should much fear or fly the Sen∣tence of Justice: yet for many small faults & imperfections in his bok (which the over ha∣sty casting together of his obser∣vations could not well avoid) he will be found perhaps not a little obnoxious to Molestati∣on and Censure. The other is to pay a Tribute of Due Ac∣knowledgement to your Vertue and Nobleness; of which, all that know you are good wit∣nesses. And who doth not know

you, either in your Person or Fame, in this great and flou∣rishing City? Who doth not speake you for a Mirrour of much Generosity and Good∣ness in your self; and also a Fa∣vorer and Cherisher of all good and honest endeavors in others? For this reason Sir (it being the Authors ambition, not to seem altogether ignorant of a thing so generally known) he presumeth upon this bold Address: being only unhappy, that he cannot (for some neces∣sary

reasons that hinder him) Immortalize his own name, as he hopeth to doe his book, by an inscription of such eminent Merit and Worth. Permit it, noblest Sir, for this once to be thus. Hereafter (if it please God) I may have some better liberty to profess my self your Servant, and to let the World know how much I honour Ver∣tue and Goodness in you. So resteth, Sir, with his best wishes for your health and the en∣crease of all prosperity to you,
