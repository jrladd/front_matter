Madam,
'TIS the Custom in EPISTLES DEDI∣CATORY to make large Encomiums in Praise of their Patron or Patroness; I have as Spacious a Field to walk in, and as much to say in your due Praise as any one; But having found that all such Addresses (by your Ge∣nerous Soul) are stiled Flattery, and declared displeasing to You, I dare not more attempt it: Only Madam, give me leave to acknowledge the many Fa∣vours I have received by your Encouragement of my former Books; and in acknowledgment thereof, I have taken the boldness to select Your Grace the Patroness of this Treatise of the HISTORY of NATURE, and shall be proud of the Honour to have permission to lay it at Your Graces Feet, and to be stiled,
Madam,
