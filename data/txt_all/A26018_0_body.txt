My LORD,
I Take the boldness to Dedicate to Your Lordship some Me∣moirs of the Life of an Excellent Person, who was Your Country-man, and
 one for whom Your Lord∣ship had a just esteem. It is not to recommend to Your Lordship any Party of men among us, but plain Christi∣anity in Legible and Lively Characters; and to remove a Common Objection against the most Excellent Precepts of our Blessed Saviour, that they are hard Sayings, and impracticable things. Here, in a very plain manner, is pre∣sented to Your view a Mi∣nister of Jesus Christ, who had no other Design in the World, but that of doing good to Mankind, and is now partaking of the Eternal Joy of his Lord and Master, to
 whom he was so entirely de∣voted.
It is Your Lordship's Qua∣lity, and Ancient and Noble Extraction that sets You a∣bove the common Level of Mankind, and draws the Eyes of the World upon You; but there is somewhat greater, Your Exemplary Piety and Zeal for our Holy Religion (in such a dege∣nerate and licentious Age) and the Countenance you give to Serious Piety, where∣ever you find it among all the different Parties that we are so unhappily broken into, that makes you the Orna∣ment
 of Your Country, and highly esteemed by Wise and Good Men, and obliges me to be with all imagina∣ble respect,
My LORD,
