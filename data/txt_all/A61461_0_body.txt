My LORD,
ALthough the Sins of this Nation, which call for frequent Fasting, and sincere Humiliation, might give us but a very Me∣lancholy Prospect of Affairs, yet when we call to mind the many Deliverances which God hath heretofore, and of late wrought for us, it will point out a Door of Hope to us, and may serve for a promising presage that he will go on to do
 us good, will perfect our Deliverance, and secure our Righteous Establishment.
But St. Austin teaches us, That he who made us without any help of ours, will not save us without our own Concurrence; and this is true as well in respect to our Happiness in this Life as in another. Men who are well-affect∣ed to the common Interest of their Countrey must be Zealously Active to promote it, watch the seasonable Appearances of God in their be∣half, and cheerfully co-operate with those Means which his Providence has recommended to 'em for their common Preservation
Your Lordship is one of those who cannot sa∣tisfie your self with an Ʋnactive Vertue. You sludy the Welfare of your Countrey Diligently, and pursue it Affectionately. And it ought to be no little matter of Joy to us all to see the Chief City of the Kingdom acting by so Noble a Prin∣ciple in the Choice of Magistrates to Rule over them, as to pitch upon one who could never stoop
 so low as to serve a narrow Interest, or a base, or private End; who prays for the Peace of Je∣rusalem, and without regard to any Party wishes all may Prosper that love it; may this good Example of the Metropolis have a happy Influence upon all other Corporations, and en∣gage them to an Imitation of such a Choice.
If the Soveraign Prince be taught from all the Characters by which his Super-eminent Of∣fice is describ'd in God's Word, that he can Espouse no Interest separate from that of his People (as is shewn in the ensuing Sermon, which was at first Preach'd, and is now Pub∣lish'd by Your Lordship's Order) surely no Man is qualify'd for any Inferior Magistracy, who can be so far misguided as to act the Business of a Party, or will suffer any private Interest to mislead his Affection from the common Good.
Plato had once a Project to preserve the Community by destroying Property; he sup∣pos'd that a common Fund set up for the whole
 Body Politick would necessarily engage a pub∣lick Spirit in every Individual; but a greater Law-giver than he has taught us, that Pro∣perty and publick Weal are to be preserv'd by loving our Neighbour as our self. And when this Spirit prevails among the Rulers of a peo∣ple, what may not be hoped for in Favour of such a Nation?
That Almighty God may still continue a Succession of such Magistrates in the Chair which Your Lordship so Honourably fills, is the Hearty Prayer of
My LORD,
