SIR,
I Cannot think there needs much Apology for an Ad∣dress of this Nature to your Lordship, although from a Stran∣ger. The Patronage of Poetry has always belong'd to the No∣ble and Virtuous: On this ac∣count

therefore as well as others it is dangerous for any Person of Honour to be so early Eminent as your Lordship, because those Excellencies that create Envy in evil Minds are sure to meet the Applause of the Muses; which to some Tempers may be the greater Persecution. Such Cha∣racters indeed are now so thin sown in Courts that they are ea∣sily singled out. Your Lordship may think that Flattery which the World knows to be Truth;

I will not therefore pretend to draw your Lordships Character, or to speak more properly I need not. As far as Constancy of Temper, Loyalty, Justice, and Generosity in the most eninent degree can oblige a Nation: the Court and Age are indebted to your Lordship. It was this great∣ness and integrity of Soul that plac'd your Lordship above the example of Nature, and against the general Frenzie made you declare for oppressed innocence.

It is therefore no wonder that such endowments of mind have gain'd the Favour of the most Just and Pious Prince. I could descend to particular Instances of Honour and private Friendship; but I design no Panegyric, being on∣ly Ambitious to pay my Devo∣tion to your Lordship by this small present, most humbly De∣dicated by
My Lord,
