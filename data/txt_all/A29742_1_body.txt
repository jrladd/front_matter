AMong many your schollers whose diligence haue made them more able: I haue aduētured to put for∣ward my selfe, being of all other most vnfit and insufficient. My purpose herein is not the gaining of mine owne commendation, but to cōmunicate that with others, which I finde beneficiall vnto my selfe. The commendation is wholy yours, from whome as from the Sunne we receaue, as in these exercises, all the light we haue. And hereunto may be added another cause of this my bold enterprise, namely, that others, who are better furaished, may by mine example, being a nouice in these studies, make proofe vnto the worlde, that your labours are not in vaine, but that there are many which haue greatly profited thereby, and which in due time (I hope) will breake forth, both to the great commoditie of the common wealth, and com∣mendation and credit of the Mathematicall Lec∣ture. Take in good parte (I pray you) these my first fruites of your owne planting, and make fauou∣rable construction thereof, correcting the faults, and pardoning my boldenes.
