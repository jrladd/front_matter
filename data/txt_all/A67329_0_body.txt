My LORD,
THE way to make these Bleak Northern Islands more Tem∣perate, will be your Lordships

taking 'em into your Indul∣gence and Protection: They are not so distant as to be un∣acquainted with your Chara∣cter, for the Latitude that is so must not be inhabita∣ble.
Every one that wants 'em feels the Effects of your Lord∣ships good Actions, but no Bo∣dy sees you do 'em. Your care and concern for mankind is your own, but your Fortune is your Friends. Your Wit is the only thing you are not enough Diffusive off, and what others covet of

you most, you your self va∣lue least.
In the Ardour to de∣clare the perfections of your Lordships Pen, I forget to conceal the Imperfections of my own, which are most par∣donable when I most pro∣fess to be,
My LORD,
