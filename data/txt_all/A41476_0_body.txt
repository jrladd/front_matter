SIRS,
IT was your pious and devout Recognition
of the Divine Favour in giving Victory
to our King, and an utter Overthrow to
those that rose up against him, which
gave occasion to this Sermon. And it being
preached by your Command, and by the repeated
Sollicitations of some (who had a just Power
over me) being desired to print it, I resolved
upon the Publication of it. Now though I am
not ignorant how things of this nature will be

treated by a malevolent and Censorious Age;
yet under Your Patronage (I hope) it may light
of such a Construction, as my Sincerity then de∣sign'd
it. Of Right the Dedication belongs to
You; from whom I have received an ample
Encouragement for many years of my Pains
and Attendance. But further, that I may give
a Testimony to the World of the sense I have of
that great Obligation that lies upon me, to let all
Men know the Respects you have constantly
shewn to such as have had the Honour to serve
You in the Ministry; May Religion, Loyal∣ty,
and the Study of the Law always flourish
among You, is the sincere Prayer of
SIRS,
Your obliged Servant,
and Chaplain,
