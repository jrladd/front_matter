Gentlemen Souldiers,
IT is hard to say whether God hath appeared more gloriously with you in breaking the powers or blast∣ing the policies of your enemies, as he hath been your strength unto the one, so your wisdom unto the other, by whose presence with you, neither wis∣dom nor weapon have prevaild against you: the great conten∣tion between Christ and the Devil, and the seed of either, is to destroy each others work in the world; and although the issue thereof shall be the mortal crushing of the head of the o; yet shall the heel of the other be bruised thereby.
Noble Sirs, the mdlling and managing, making and main∣taining, preserving and prosperig your happy Army,  such a

transparent work of God in the world, that it dazels the eyes of all spectators: the presence of God and the prayers of his people have always attended your valiant attempts, by means whereof your ones have chased tens, and your hundreds have put thou∣sands to flight: it is too true, you have met with hardship abroad▪ and unkindness at home: but your honor it is that neither the one or the other hath made you bow unto a base unworthy and sinful deportment: God hath subdued the common Enemy by you, this he may do more for others then your own sakes; but when he subdues your enemies within you, it is more for your own th other mens sakes; that he doth in love to others; this in love to you: that as he makes you executioners of his fierce wrath; thisWhen we speak of the Army we would be understood of the honest party there∣in, which (we con∣ceive) is of a greater number then there is the like in any Ar∣my in this world. as he makes you the objects of his free love: When you conquer men, you conquer flesh, and so one beast may conquer another: but when you conquer sin, you conquer spirit; and this is the work of none but Christ: the blood of your Enemies may feed the root of your present power, but the blood of your sins doth water the root of your eternal happiness; that an Army should be humble under victories, meek under injuries, patient under provocations, fear no men, yet tremble before God, should be a terror to the wicked, and a tower to the Saints, should be Lions in fields, and Lambs in families; this imports your pow∣erful hamering by the hand of the spirit upon the anvil of Truth into a blessed battle-ax, compleatly aptified for the hand of God unto the breaking in peeces the envious enemies of his Son and his Saints, according to the predict counsels of his holy Word, and hence it is, that the Antichristian where is filld with fears that you are the men cōmission'd by God to execute upon her the Judg∣ment written, to stain her glory and spoil her beauty,  bastards brains against the stones, & to give her blood for blood to drink, to burn her flesh with fire, for the prevention whereof that you may not torment her before her time, she hath summon'd the Princes of the earth that have committed fornication with her, with their sons of whoredom to band their might and strength a∣gainst you: but the Lord that raised you and called you to his foot (Isa. 41. 2) gave the Nations before you, making you Ru∣lers over Kings and Princes, giving them as dust to your sword, and as driven stubble to your bow, making you to eat up the Na∣tions,

your enemies, to break their bones, and pier them through with your arrows, and then causing you to couch down like a Lion, none daring to sti you up; but this wrish Dalilah per∣ceiving your might by breaking her forces like Sampsons coards, i trying her tricks to find out your strength, and the seat thereof, and well perceiving that it lies in your hair, rted together in your head. (we mean in your Ʋnion with Christ, and each with other,) se hath applyed her self in her several Instruments, by her enticing words to cut you from him, and then to divide you each from other, whose curi cunning in that unhappy work is here set forth in one of her supposed faithful factors Mr Willim Wlwyn, whose various manners in corrupting and dividing (by himself, and others,) the honest and true-hearted party to Religi∣ous, and the Kingdome interest in the Army, City and Country, i truly declared; having received satisfaction touching the truth of thse particular instances given concerning him, (though we knw his profest principle is to say or do any thing whatsoever against him whom he thought engaged against him to destroy him, yet) we cannot but subscribe our own Observations and Experiences of his general course in all his ways, as they are here set forth. As for Mr Richard Overton we know him not but by his Pen, the complexion whereof hath quit our desires of any fur∣ther acquaintance with him. Mr Lilburn, and Mr Prince (we verily hope) are for better in their ends and aims, then in their game in hitting their marks (viz. the real Interest of their native Country,) though (we must confess) we look upon them as simple∣hearted, so simple-headed, to be drawn, as they are, into such ways as they walk. For although in words they profess, yet in works they deny, and destroy the Interest of England; for who seeth not not that these clamorous Complaints insated into the Army, and spread abroad in the City and Country, Vi. That the People assembled at Westminster are not a lawful Parli∣ament, but there  by the power of the Sword to over∣awe and tyranni over the free-born people of England, That it is against the Laws of the Land, that there should be any Mar Discipline over Souldiers in time of peace, (though there should be an Army under pay,)  as if we were all in peace which we are not like to be while such  of  are

kindled by them, that the design of the House at Westminster,  Councel of State, &c. is to keep down the people under  and Slavery by an Army, as if it was possible (a the  stands to settle this Common-wealth without an Army▪  the Commons of England (whom in their several Papers they have acknowledge to be the Supream Authority of the Nation, must be tyed to govern by the known Laws, not to alter the Go∣vernment, viz. to establish a Councel of State, and yet have power to take away the life of the King, and to abolish the House of Lords, &c. That the sending over Forces to Ireland is for not else but to make way by the blood of the Army to enlarge  territories of power and Tyranny, That it is an unlawful War,  cruel and bloody work to go to destroy the Irish Natives for  Consciences, (though they have kil'd many thousand Protestants for their Consciences,) and to drive them from their proper natu∣ral and native Rights, (though they have done the like to many thousand Protestants, who, though English, had as true natural and native right to their Lands and heritances as the Irish had: We say, who is so blind as not to see that the true design of all these chantings is to divide the Army, and break it in pieces by jealousies and discontents, to hinder the happy and hopeful relief of Ireland, to betray these poor Protestants that lie trembling and panting between hope and fear, (not knowing whether yet they shall live or dye,) break the Parliament and Councel of State, and consequently by the utter and irrecoverable loss of Ireland, ruin of the Army, crushing the presēt Authority, dividing the honest party, the Irish Rebels may come with all their Powers from all parts a∣broad, and in this Nation, like a mighty Torrent, sweeping all befor them, and put themselves into a capacity of putting into execution their bloody, cruel, tyrannical and revengeful thoughts against the honest party in the Land. We have ever observed, that this Mr Walwyn in all viciscitudes, and turns of affairs, hath still withstood the present Government, yea, though model'd according to his former pretended desires, which argues a hidden design in all his pretences; Tis true, when Magisterial Power asheth against Divine, and men in authority ight against God by oppression and tyranny, they shall be broken in pieces as a glass against a Rock; for though the fountain of Government springs from the People,

and the end thereof  their only benefit, yet while the Power in the People is uncontracted, and their own Authority is untrans∣fer'd, it is like (shall we say a tallent hid in the earth without uses) ay rather as the inordinate heat in a stack of corn, firing it self with its own heat. Where all men are alike Rulers, none will be ruled, and then into what precipices should we run? To live to∣gether is the Law of Nature, and how can this be when every mans lust shall be every mans Law? For then every mans will shall be every mans wants, and no man will content himself with what he hath. While he hath not that which his neighbor hath, the best of Governments cannot secure each individual from op∣pression; but where there is no Government, so many men are so many Tyrants each to others. The worst of Governments is good for some, but no Government can be good for none: Where is no Government there can be no Agreement, and certain destruction attends division. Valiant Sirs, be not deceived by these Arch▪ deluders, neither be divided amongst your selves; Union hath preserved you, Division will destroy you: God hath made you terrible by Union, the Jesuite would make you contemptible by division: your enemies despair to overcome you by Power, revive not their hopes to do it by policy; they could not cudgel you, let them not cajole you: you have wrested their swords, their spears, their trophies, their banners out of their hands, let them not cheat them out of your hands again; they tell you, your Officers would lift up themselves by your blood, but have not you better experiences of your Officers then they? Have not they stuck to you, as well as you to them, in the day of battel? What though men have not regarded you as you deserved, will not God be faithful, though men are not? Will not he be true when they are lyars? Are you afraid to receive your wages, your rewards from the immediate hand of God alone? That your honor shall be too great, your Crown too heavy at the great pay day? He hath made you fa∣mous in England, and famous in Scotland, and is it your fear, that he will honor you in Ireland, (that any of you should be disswaded, from that happy work,) are you unwilling to be possessed of that good Land, that Land that floweth with milk and honey? Hath not God fed you with former Victories, to the amazement of all that he might steel you against all future difficulties that you

t withal. The people of God in England, in Scotland,  visn up and called you blessed for your help to them in the day of trouble, and shall your poor Brethren in Ireland receive  favour from you? We beseech you by the Womb that b a you, and the Paps that gave you suck, by the honor of Englis men, by all the experiences of the presence of God with you while you stuck  the Interest of God, his people and your native Country, that you pl off the Vizors of those Jesuitical Whifflers, that (creeping in a∣mong you like the Serpents spawn under the green grss) spy  your liberty, envy your approaching happiness, and would ow de∣stroy you by your own selves; the just Liberties of the Nation, the Freedom of the Gospel, the Interest of England, the joy of all good men are in the fruitful Womb of your former faithfulness, which is now ready to bring forth, if you help in the how of trl, howsoever, that the happy work of God, begun in these three Islands of England, Scotland and Ireland, shall go on and prosp by the honored Instruments of Gods own choice, is the faith and prayer of
