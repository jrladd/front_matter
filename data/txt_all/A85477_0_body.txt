King Charles,
THe Lord having of∣ten put it into my heart by his revealed will, to write to lost Eng∣land, being truly sensible that she hath an immortal soul, in which I am deeply concerned, and for which I travel till it be born again in the particular and in the general: and therefore to thee as King, and as su∣preme, whom the Lord I be∣lieve
 hath set upon Englands throne to that end, that thou mightst rule in righteous∣ness; therefore let not the King think it below him to read that which many think above me to write, in respect to my sex: but in that will which would li∣mit the holy One in any sex or person, I write not, nei∣ther can the thoughts of that minde judge of the matter, God being not there in them thoughts, neither is his righteousness wrought by that will; and therefore from that in any one do not I expect a good thought or word of that I shall write: but to the faithfull witness
 of the living God, which is sprung up out of the little seed, to bear witness whence it did proceed, to that I appeal, & that I know in all wil not judge amiss of what I write. But this true experience hath taught me, that if any thing do think or speak evil of that it knows not, it will arise and judge it down a∣gain. And O King Charles, thou maist do well to take heed to it as to a light shi∣ning in a dark place, which sometimes is clouded over; and then the prince of dark∣ness would judge of the matter: but let the Lord a∣rise, and let the enemy of thy soul be confounded:
 and if thou canst not think or speak well of what is writ to thee in dear love to thy immortal soul, why for the Lords sake onely let it alone, till the light shall shine forth which makes manifest deeds of darkness, and judges all things as they are: which is able to try all things, and hold fast that which is good, which is given to all to profit withall, and to no other end, it being sufficient to teach all to deny ungodli∣ness and worldly lusts; which if obeyed, will justi∣fie eternally; and on the contrary, if disobeyed, or turned into wantonness, it
 will condemn for ever all those.
But that the seed of the kingdom which was once spoken of to be the least of all seeds, and grew to be the greatest of all trees, may in∣crease, and grow, and flou∣rish, is the desire of my soul. Oh the heighth, the depth! the world is not able to con∣tain what might be writ concerning it; of which kingdome and dominion there is no end: but the be∣ing faithful to a little, brings to be ruler over much. And that thou maist grow in it, I recommend it to thee, as the onely rule of a Christians life. For


King Charls, thou art placed as King over this Land
By an invisible and outstret∣ched hand,
That thou in righteousnesse mightst rule and reign,
To relieve the oppressed, and help ease the pain
Of the sick and poor, and the di∣stressed,
That thy call might be, Come thou blessed,
Take thy reward which shall never cease,
The crown of life, even everla∣sting peace.
This, this is Gods intent of bringing thee in hither,
That thou the evil do prevent, and fear him altogether:

 And seek him where he is to be found, & call on him whilst neer,
In heart that is up right & sound, for none other he will hear.
The guiltless he will hold so still, but those that his Name take
In vain, he will not guiltless hold, even for his own Names sake.
Therefore O Charles, be thou a King
That to Gods Name may honour bring:
Bring all thy deeds unto the light,
Thy words and thoughts try in his sight;
That neither thought, or word, or deed,
May from darkness ever pro∣ceed:
If so it do, let it be brought,
That it may soon be set at nought;

 That so thou singly in his sight
Stand justified by the light.
A tender heart he loveth sure,
For his mercies do for ever en∣dure;
And love his holy law doth ful∣fill,
For love doth love no blood to spill:
Therefore in love do thou abide,
That thou in love maist ever hide;
For this is that will stand by thee,
When time and things away shall flee;
Even love and charity which is true,
Which gives to every one his due;

 And hid is always from the carnal,
Because its being is in the e∣ternal:
For Love is the beginning and the end of all,
Therefore before it do not thou fall,
But in it stand, and ever keep
To God and to his pasture-sheep;
That so good old age may be thy crown,
And length of days thy thy re∣nown;
That so thy memory may be
Preserved in eternity.
For the hoary head and length of days,
Is that which ever gives him praise:

 And this is my desire for thee,
Whose desire can never other∣wise be
But good towards thee and o∣thers all,
Though never so deeply in the fall.
