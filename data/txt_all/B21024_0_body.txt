SIR,
A Person of no small Character, who has left England, to make a Tour in France, was pleas'd to favour me with this Translation. I thought my self oblig'd, both in Justice and Ho∣nour, to that Worthy Gentleman, not to confine it any longer to Manuscript, presuming it may reasonably deserve no worse a Reception, than most of our Modern Travels. Nevertheless, being jealous of my own Opinion in things of this nature, I resolv'd to prefix a Name that might shelter it from the Cavils of Some, who contemn every thing that bears the Title of a Voyage; not consi∣dering the great Advantages extracted therefrom, especially those of the Le∣vant, which are very useful, to unravel
the Difficulties that occurr in Ancient Histories. Whose can be so proper as that of the Judicious Aglionby? A suffi∣cient Pasport for a less correct Piece than what is here offer'd.
Under Your Patronage, Worthy Sir, we may securely despise the Frivolous Censures of the Over-captious, if any there are so maliciously ill-natur'd, as to attack what You are pleas'd to protect.
Your large Experience in these Affairs, and Your profound Judgment in matters of State, which has on many accounts so eminently appear'd, does indeed wholly deterr me from this Presumption: but then the Extraordinary Candour and Goodness of your Temper, of which I have receiv'd such Substantial Proofs, encourages me to indulge the Ambition I always entertain'd of demonstrating how very much I am,
Honour'd Sir,
