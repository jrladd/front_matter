My Lord,
BOoks and Mapps of
Navigation, repre∣sent
a long tract of
Rocks in the Eastern
Seas, called the Pater Nosters,
they putting the Pilot to his
prayers,Sea Mir∣rour, lib. 1. De∣monstrat 4. I here present a gift of
the same name, for the same end,
but differing in the moving cause,
there being here no hazard,
but security in bearing up, and
good Anchorage; yea, the bear∣ing

off from what is here offer∣ed
in our late times, is to be
feared, was one great cause, why
so many made shipwrack, first
of faith, next of a good conscience:
conceiting themselves able to
make way against, and weather∣out
the Rule, So pray ye, And
when ye pray, say, yet harbour
in the Haven of bliss, by other
gales then those from Heaven;
which was foreseen,Wither Cant. 4. . nay, fore∣told
by a Poet, then almost
(because not in this) their
own, who advising for the use
of the Lords Prayer, in his
Vox Pacifica, hinteth at that
Malady thus,
Lest that which might of bliss a means have been,
A means become of letting curses in.

I concluded to have publish∣ed
these sheets without desig∣nation
of a Patron, Dedicati∣ons
being now so customary,
that they are near to be inter∣preted
vanity; yet reflecting
that at least with Divines they
are no younger then St. Luke,
and that Charity and Candor
are as cold as were the nights
in which most of them were
composed; it was deemed rude∣nesse
to suffer this Stripling to
travel without some recom∣mendation
to some excellent
Theophilus, were it but for one
nights lodging (for, I trust he
is better bred then to be trouble∣some)
After which resolve, let

me declare it, your Lordship had
no Rival, your Goodness, Care,
Industry in your House, Of∣fice
and Authority, to, about,
and for the Ministry of this
City in general, and to my self
in particular, encouraging me,
and promising a courteous ac∣ceptation,
and enforcing upon
me this Epistle so much the
more, that by many it is ac∣counted
a vice reverently to
mention the name of a Loyal
Levite, whereas your Lordship
(more God-like) will Advocat
their cause: Upon which it was
judged disobedience against the
Law, and temerity against na∣tural
affection, to address my

Pater Noster to any, save to
your Lordship, as a common
Father of my Brethren, for
whose settlement, as at first you
were a Patron, so still continu∣eth
to be, and that in Solidum.
Your wonted affablility
emboldens to crave prote∣ction
for this little one, un∣der
your Roof and Patro∣nage,
where vertuously dispo∣sed,
if otherwise found faulty,
let it be corrected in judgment,
but not in wrath, so shall its
Parent be more encouraged to
joyn in the hearty Antiphonies
of this ancient and honourable
Cities Ministery, for your
Lordships prosperity and hap∣pinesse

joyntly with your Bre∣thren,
the Baliffs and Coun∣cellours,
adding this as mine
own Hymn, that our Father
which is in Heaven, may assure
you all of his Kingdom, Power,
and Glory, for ever, Amen;
which shall industriously be
pleaded-for at the Throne of
Grace, by
My Lord,
From my Study, Iune 15. 1670.
