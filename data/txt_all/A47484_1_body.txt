Right Worshipful,
TUtelar Angels are a controverted Theme amongst Schoolmen, but the favourable influ∣ence of a just defence from your Worships, hath been an unquestionable matter of my experience: which tran∣scendent favours, if buried

in Oblivion, would be an high impeachment of vera∣city; and not to acknow∣ledge them, having this oc∣casion, could plead for no distance, from down-right sordidness and plain Ingra∣titude.
The Work is too small, and the Author too mean to equalize your worth, or merit your Patronage; only 'tis the height of my Ambi∣tion to let the world know that your favours (which as far excel my deserts as my power to retaliate) have

not been bestowed on an ungrateful Servant. I am not ignorant, that cunning Bezaliahs and Aholiahs may carve and pollish the Tem∣ple, yet I am glad that I can but lay one little stone: though men of brighter Souls bring their Gold and Jewels to it, yet I hope God will accept of my young Pigeons and Turtle Doves. I may say with St. Peter, Silver and Gold have I none, but what I have I give you; in all humility beseeching you to consider my years,

which are but few, and the time I had, which was but short, and my many other sad occasions, wherewith in the mean time I was interrupted; and then ac∣cept of this for tryal, as if it were the extract of some purer and better wit. The Lord prosper your days, direct your hearts, and bless all your undertakings, to the glory of his Name, and your own eternal felicitie: So ever Prayeth
