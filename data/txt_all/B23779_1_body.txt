To GERARDUS VOSSIUS, Professor of History and civill Arts, in the most flourishing City of Amsterdam,

I Were, most excellent Vossius, what I least would bee, that is, ungrate∣full, if when all your papers are full of me, I should keepe the love and honour of you shut up within the closet of my minde, and take no care, that poste∣rity, if yet my labours may so hope, might have some monument extant of our inseparable con∣junction; which you in my adversity, such as is wont either to discover false affections, or to change light, have been so far fron lessening, as that by many offices you have made it greater. If I should say, your learning indeed singular and infinite hath brought me to esteem you as I doe, I say but what is common to mee with the Uni∣versity of them through the whole world that love letters. But the nearer I have been admitted to know your most candid manners, and goodnesse
 shut against no man, I have alwaies thought it a great part of my felicity to bee joyn'd with you in so much a greater tie. The common study of all humane literature is a very strong bond: but I adde also, that in this ages fervent heat of Theo∣logicall disputations, I have found you of that singular prudence and moderation of mind, as that from those things which the Churches plan∣ted by the Apostles, and which they who agreed with them in likenesse of discipline, have held as certaine and resolv'd, you would never depart; but from those, which of old have had a free dis∣putation, you would inhibit your decretory style. To hold which purpose more happily, you had two great helps at hand, a very great, and as much as ever had any man, diligence, and a pure judgement in revolving Ecclesiasticall An∣tiquities; whereof no man can doubt who shall have read your Pelagian History, a worke most famous through France and Brittaine. To your so great virtues and merits towards me some extra∣ordinary present was due: But whereas I could not as yet appoint a certaine seat for my hitherto scattered papers and bookes, and so not put my last and irrevocable hand to any of my greater workes; mindfull in the mean time of humane chances, though unable to pay, yet by giving e∣ven a small pledge I would testifie how much and how gladly I am indebted. And yet if you per∣mit
 me (what Horace allowes himselfe) to set a price upon my gift, it is a Tragedy I bring, a kind of writing (as you very well know, Vossius, of whom after precepts of Grammer and eloquence, we have also the art of Poetry expressed in lively colours) royall, and of so great dignity, as that Sophocles hath not thought it below his high place which he held in Athens; nor Augustus Caesar his owne minde comprehending the whole power of the Roman Empire. I may commend it too for the Argument fetcht not from the miseries of Troy and Thebes, polluted with the lies of the Grecians, but out of the History of Moses un∣toucht by falshood: and indeed, unlesse I mis∣take, the only one in Divine Writ, which hath those two things thought by Aristotle (a man in this part also, as you concurre with me, of grea∣test judgement) even single to adde very much to the grace of a Tragedy; an unlook'd for Agniti∣on, and sudden change of things. For both Io∣seph discovers himselfe to his Brethren, who for a long while knew him not, and his Brethren themselves are suddenly translated out of the grea∣test fear into the highest prosperity. Some perhaps will find fault, that this Tragedy hath not a sad conclusion: who if they have not yet laid aside that error in distinguishing between the buskin and socke; let them read either Aeschy∣lus's Danaides, or our Euripides his Alcestes, Ion,
 Helena, and which I have lately turn'd into Latin, Iphigenia among the Tauri: or (if they will not take that paines) those your precepts I now men∣tioned of the Art of Poetry. Wherunto, whether what I here present bee agreeable, I desire no o∣ther judge then your selfe; not indeed upon confidence of my endeavours, which both by the cruelty hitherto of fortune and my declining age it selfe (whereof you almost alone are not sensi∣ble) begin to flag, but in the equity of your judge∣ment, which yet I hope not for as a friend; for neither would I corrupt you in what I ought to offer unto you as precious, but as one who have propounded to my self ever to deserve the best of letters and lovers of letters. There is also in this argument another thing, which whe∣ther it will please others I know not, for wee live in a malignant age; that certainly it will please you, I doubt not. Philo, little lesse then a Chri∣stian, hath taught me, that Moses, whom both we and the Jewes (by the manifest evidence of what he foretold) believe to have bin divinely inspir'd, and who is celebrated for a most wise Law-maker by wise men, and born in a very wise age, Dio∣dorus the Sicilian, Trogus Pompeius a Roman, and a Cappadocian indeed, but the most judicious, Strabo; when in the preamble of his most holy lawes he had given us three choice patterns for a private life, the first of him who by the aid of
 arts and excellent learning came from false gods to the true; the second, whose birth it selfe and happy education did very much advantage him; and a third, who besides these benefits had this also, which I by experience think the greatest, a triall by afflictions, would adde likewise a man exercised in publike government, notable, not onely for those hereditary and domestique vir∣tues, but what were also profitable to the Com∣mon-wealth; which indeed in Ioseph he hath so perform'd, as that he, a leader of the people, if ever any, provident for the future, unbroken in evils, a maintainer of justice, observing mode∣ration in all things, may seeme to have set him∣selfe no other copy, next to the divine Comman∣dements, by which to order his actions, then the life of this Ioseph; far differing from those worst of men, and consequently of teachers, who when they would give us the Character of a Prince, are wont to make him a man compos'd of deceit and perfidiousnesse, and an obdurate contempt of God and all lawes, as wel common as peculiar, to any people; a constitution of mind, unlesse I mistake, not attainable, but through a long custome of villanies. But these things it is your part to prosecute more at large, of whom after your books the best guides unto, and Judges of the Greeke and Latin Annalists; wee all, who who love truth and right, I say not expect, for
 that is too little, but earnestly beg the sum also of Universall History. Farewell man nearest my heart, and comfort your want of a lost Sonne (since it hath so pleased God) with those many children of your learning, begotten by you, and sent abroad through the whole World.
