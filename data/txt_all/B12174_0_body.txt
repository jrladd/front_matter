WOrthies, your gratious and im∣merited Favours, not onely intended, but also extended to∣wards me (the meanest of a thousand) exact at my hands a more ex∣act Demonstration of gratitude, than at this present to present you with a Sermon;
 but having no better Present to offer, daign it I pray you, your candid aspect, and accept it, as Artaxerxes did the water at Synataes Aelian. hands, and expande yours for patronage; under which, as the Dove in Noahs Arke, shall be its best repose and shelter. The lines I tender you are a Monument of my sincere and loving affection, in themselves mostly lines of Loue, not carnall but spi∣rituall, being richly in-layd with the loue of Christ, that loue out-layd by effusion of his most pretious Blood, together with the true felicity and incomparable dignity of Chrtstians, wherewith your pious soules have beene daily more and more inamou∣red, and your persons more honoured, than Nobilitas sla est atque vinca ver∣tus. with any Indian Treasure, or the Worlds umbratilous Honour; which Worke wheresoever it is wrought, there is e∣minently, Digitus Dei, the finger of God, which finger as did that Starre the Magi, guide you to the Starre of Iacob, whose loue as a Banner ever over-spread you, and the blessings of whose hands com∣passe you on every side, that yee may be able with all Saints to comprehend
 what is the bredth, and length, and depth, Ephes. 3. 17, 18 and height, and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, and that yee may be filled with all fulnesse of God, to the praise of his Glory.
