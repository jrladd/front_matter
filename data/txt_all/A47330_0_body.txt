Right Honourable,
IN obedience to your Order I present you with the following
Sermon. I heartily wish it may gain the End which it aims at; That all Men of
Wealth and Publick Influence would im∣prove the advantages they have to the
Honour of God and the Good of the Community. It is high time to set about it
vigorously, and that they make it their constant care and business.
Very much Good may be done this way by the united endeavours of
those men who have Wealth and Authority: God and all Good men expect it from
them: 'Tis at once their duty and their truest interest. This course will
be much for theHonour of this great City, 'twill be its best
secu∣rity, and the best means to procure the Divine Protection.
May it please Almighty God to inspire you all with a great
zeal for the advancement of true Religion, the promoting all works of mercy and
beneficence, the encouraging industry and dili∣gence, the suppressing
all profaneness, the ob∣viating all unchristian heats and animosities,
and the doing your utmost in your several places to all these great
purposes. This is the hearty Prayer of
