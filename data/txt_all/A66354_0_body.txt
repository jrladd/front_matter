THIS Title wherewith you are adorned, is so Divine Be∣neficent
and truly Catholick, that your Request Obliged
my compliance in Preaching the following Sermon
under all the Disadvantages of a Traveler.
Yet had I Conferred with Flesh and Blood, those many accurate
Discourses you have on this Subject, must have rendred my hurry
of business and want of Books, an insuperable Argument against
the Publication of it.
But being perswaded the Bible is not only the fittest Book to
justifie the Truth of the Duty insisted on, but attended with
greatest Authority to inforce it on the Conscience, the Censures
of the Polite for my want of other Ornaments, cannot deter me
from exposing what you think Serviceable to your good Design,
as that which I am sure is not only according to Gods Word, but
undertaken in Obedience to it.
I am not ashamed the World should know how my Love for
Ireland Exalts my Joy at your Attempts, to Suppress that Wic∣kedness
which alone can Ruin it, and to promote Practical Re∣ligion,
which must cause its Flourishing against all Assaults: They
who less affect you, ought to be thankful for your good Success
herein, and ascribe the sudden prosperity of this Land, to Gods
Approbation of your vigorous Endeavours to Reform it.
The Argument whereby I urge all to Assist in your Blessed
Work, is too evident to be resisted by any, who account Service
to God either a Priviledge or a Duty; and next in force to that
I Published on the same occasion in London; viz. That they
who promote National Reformation are on Christ's side, and

they who neglect it are of the Devil's Party, in the Contest
managed by them as the Heads of their respective opposite
Kingdoms.
The Consequence of your Undertaking may Excuse my Impor∣tunity,
because I am under Conviction, that when you become
remiss, or altogether Unsuccessful, this Nation will be under
more than a Probable Presage of sudden Desolation, and much
severer than any that hath befallen it heretofore.
If any think me too Close and Plain, Faithfulness to my Lord
whom you serve, and a peculiar regard for this Land which you
would Save, must afford the only Apology I dare make. As the
Enterprize you are Inspired to Engage in, is too fully Authori∣zed
by Divine and Human Laws, to be thought Unjust, and too
plainly Commanded, and Important in its Effects, to be esteemed
Indifferent; so its too contrary to Satans Interest, and the de∣generate
Inclinations of Mankind, to be Executed without great
Fortitude, Vigor, Wisdom, Self-denial, and Union; or to keep
your Hearts by these in a fixed Disposition to persue it, with∣out
rich supplies of Grace, and great Care and Labour with your
own Spirits, whence all remains of Sin are not yet expelled.
Many do joyn with you in Prayer, that your fitness may im∣prove
by your work; your Resolution by your Difficulties; your
Union, by ill Designs to break it; your Success by Opposition;
and the Purity and Sedateness of your own Spirits, by all your
Endeavours to Reform others; which (among the rest) is heartily
desired by,
