MOst deere Philip, in that a man is the most worthy of all Creatures, a creature made like to God, by nature milde, of stature vpright, prouident, wise; of memory, witty; by reason, susceptible of Lawes and learning; by his Crea∣tours great gift, farre preferred before all vnreasonable Creatures in al things, but specially in two, to wit, Speech and Reason; it followes that Ignorance in him is so much the fowler fault, by how much hee is more worthy than other Creatures. Now this as it is a fowle shame for all men, so for Schollers it is the fowlest disgrace: the course of whose life is ordayned for this, that by liuing well they may shew others an example of good fashions, learning and honesty, en∣creasing feruent Faith in the people, and (which is their chiefest Office, by praising God in Hymnes and songs, stirring vp deuotion in the hearts of the faithfull.
By obseruation whereof (most kinde friend) I was stirred vp to helpe learners in that kinde also, and after the handling of Concent, which in the former bookes we haue deliuered, to deliuer the Ecclesiasticall Accent. A matter surely hard, be∣cause it requires both a Grammarian and a Musitian, and also because it is to be had rather by vse than by writing: and further because either none or very few men haue handled this point: by this difficulty the worke was a while hindred from seeing the light; now being set out and perfected, I commit it to your tui∣tion, and subiect it to your censure, beseeching you both to mend the errours you find in it, and to defend it from the inuasion of enuious men: because thou art able, learned, godly, and besides other gifts of nature, hast an elegant stile, a sweet vain, and in singing a graceful cunningnesse, wherin thou doest exceed thy fellow-Musitians, in entertaining strangers (as I to your cost found) a liberall humour. Whence it is come to passe, that all the Masters of the Budorine vniuersity, which they call Heydelberg, do singularly loue, honour, and respect you. Farewell, (wor∣thy Sir) and defend thy Andreas from the enuious backebiter.
