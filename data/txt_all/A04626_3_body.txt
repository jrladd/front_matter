REader, beleeue me, 'tis not Gaine, nor Fame
That makes me put in my neglected Name;
Mong'st learned Mourners that in Sable Verse,
Doe their last Honour to this dolefull Herse.


Nor did these Lords, by liuing bountie, tie
To Them, and to their Heires my Poetry:
For, to speake plainly, though I am but poore;
Yet neuer came I knocking to their doore:
Nor euer durst my low obscuritie,
Once creepe into the luster of their die.


Yet since I am a Christian, and suppose
My selfe obliged, both with Verse and Prose;
Both with my Pencills, and my Pens best Art;
With eye, tongue, heart, and hand, and euery part
In each right Noble well-deseruing Spirit,
To honour Vertue, and commend true merit.
Since first I breath'd and liu'd within the Shire,
That giues a Title to this honoured Peere;
Since twelue long Winters I, my little Flock
Fedin that At Thorley, in the Ile of Wight. Isle that (wal'd with many a rock;


And circled with the Maine) against her shore,
Hear's the proud Ocean euery day to rore;
And sitting there in sun-shine of his Glory
Saw his faire Vertues, read his lifes true Story.


Who see's not, I haue reason to make one,
In this Isle's, Churches, Countries common mone?
Or thinks that in his losse I haue no part,
When the whole Kingdome seems to feele the smart?


Let him that list his griefs in silence mutter,
I cannot hold; my plaints I needs must vtter:
I must lament, and sigh, and write, and speake,
Lest while I hold my tongue, my heart should breake.
