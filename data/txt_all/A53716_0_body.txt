SIRS,
ALL that I shall preface to the En∣suing
Discourse, is, that seeing the
Nations welfare and Your Own act∣ings
are therein concerned; the wel∣fare
of the Nation, and Your own
prosperity in your present Actings,
being so neerly related as they are to the things of
the ensuing Discourse, I should be bold to presse
You to a serious consideration of them as now pre∣sented
unto You, were I not assured by your ready
attention unto, and favourable acceptation of their
delivery, that being now published by Your Com∣mand,
such a request would be altogether needlesse.
The subject matter of this Sermon being of so great
weight and importance as it is, it had been very de∣sireable,
that it had fallen on an abler hand, as also
that more space and leasure had been allotted to the
preparing of it, first for so great, judicious, and Ho∣norable
Audience; and secondly, for publick view,
then possibly I could begge from my daily troubles,
pressures and templations, in thee midst of a poore,

numerous provoking people. As the Lord hath
brought it forth, that it may be usefull to Your Ho∣norable
Assembly, and the residue of men that wait
for the appearance of the Lord Jesus, shall be the
sincere indeavour at the throne of Grace, of
Coggeshall: May 1.
1649.
