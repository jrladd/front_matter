SIR,
IT hath pleas'd your Highnesse to com∣mand this Sermon to the Presse, and me to be your ser∣vant: what you have observ'd from either, that might in∣cline you to so much grace & favour, I know not; unlesse it were my plaine dealing with the Times. This (indeed)

your Highnesse mentioned with a deep sence and relish. VVould God the mad world knew it. Certainly it were enough to stop the foul mouthes of some: enough to warme the honest hearts of others. God Almighty so compose the present troubles of this State, that the Government thereof may stand the surer for this shaking; and continue and increase his graces in you for the glorious support there∣of, when it shal please him to lay it up∣on your shoulders.
