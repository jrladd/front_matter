MADAM,
IT is an argument of the Immorta∣lity of the Soul, that it can appre∣hend, and imbrace such a Concepti∣on; and, it may be some kinde of Prophecy, of the continuance, and

lasting of these Letters, that ha∣ving been scattered, more then Sibyls leaves, I cannot say into parts, but corners of the World, they have re∣collected and united themselves, meeting at once, as it were, at the same spring, from whence they flow∣ed, but by Succession.
But, the piety of Aeneas to An∣chises, with the heat, and fervour of his zeale, had been dazelled, and extinguished by the fire of Troy, and his Father become his Tombe, had not a brighter flame appeared in his Protection, and Venus herself de∣scended with her embraces, to pro∣tect her Martiall Champion; so that there is no safer way, to give a perpetuity to this remnant of the

dead Authour; but, by dedicating it to the Altar of Beauty and perfecti∣on; and if you, Madam, be but pleased to shed on it, one beame of your Grace and Favour, that very Adumbration will quicken it with a new Spirit, and defend it from all fire, (the fate of most Letters) but the last; which, turning these into ashes, shall revive the Authour from his Vrne, and put him into a capacity of celebrating you, his Guardian Angell, who has protected that part of his Soul, that he left behinde him, his Fame and Reputation.
The courtesies that you conferre upon the living, may admit of some allay, by a possibility of a Retalia∣tion; but what you bestow upon the

Dead, is a Sacrifice to pure Virtue; an ungifted Deity, tis true, without Oblation, Altar, or Temple, if she were not enshrined in your noble brest, but, I must, forever, become her votary, if it be, but for giving me this Inclination, and desire of be∣ing
Madam
