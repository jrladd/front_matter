My Lord,
HAd I no other consideration
in the publishing of this
Discourse, than to make
an open acknowledgment of my duty

to your Lordship, (and not be silent
at a time when the Applauses of the
most indifferent Persons declare
their satisfaction at your continuance
of that character, which none can
better sustain, nor has any ever born
it with greater Honour and Fidelity,
than all men must confess your Lord∣ship
to have done it) I should think
it sufficient to outweigh all those
Censures, which perhaps may pass,
with security enough, both upon me
and It.
[It was not to be doubted, but
that a Prince so Wise to understand,
so Gracious to reward the services
of the meanest of his Subjects, would
have a particular regard to a Me∣rit
and Loyalty great as your Lord∣ship's;
and not so soon part with a

Minister, whom he knows to have been
such, as others promise they will be. It
is the Vanity of most men to speak
great things, it is your Lordship's
Honour that you do them: And I
may without danger of any censure,
but your own, truly say, That in a Sta∣tion
which affords, if any other, tryals
and opportunities to exercise the
highest abilities, you have exceeded
not only your own Promises, but even
our Hopes, and given us an Assurance
that there is nothing now remaining
that can equal the greatness of
your Mind.
Permit me, my Lord, to render
this short testimony to your Vertues,
so far from flattery, that those who
know your Lordship, will confess it
to be hardly the truth; and if you

please pardon my presumption in this
address, I believe as unexpected to
your Lordship, as I can justly say it
was undesigned by me.]
But, my Lord, it has been thought
fit to give your Lordship this satis∣faction,
that whilst you are rendring
your Obedience to his Majestie's
Commands in England, we have not
been less careful, both to shew our
selves, and to exhort others to be as
firm to their Loyalty here: and since
we could not have the Honour of
your presence to compleat the utmost
Solemnity of this Day amongst us, by
this Address at least to joyn you in
our service, and return our acknow∣ledgments
for that Opportunity we
have had under your protection, to
remember the captivity of Zion in
a strange Land.

The only thing that might justly
have deterr'd me from this attempt,
was the meanness of the performance,
did I not consider that Saints and
Martyrs (like that God before whom
they stand) are not so much taken
with the Elegant composures of their
Votaries, as with their Piety and
Sincerity; and accept him who brings
an honest heart, rather than an ac∣curate
Discourse to their Memories.
And this, my Lord, were the Ser∣mon
it self silent, yet the Honour I
have to belong to your Lordship, would
undoubtedly confirm to as many as
have ever known your character.
May your Lordship long have the
happiness to continue your services
to his Sacred Majesty and the Royal
Family, and encrease every day those

applauses that are so justly paid to
your great Vertues; whilst I still
endeavour by all the duties of my
employ, more and more to deserve
that Title I most desire, of being,
with all humble duty and respect,
My Lord,
