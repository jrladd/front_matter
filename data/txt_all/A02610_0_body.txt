MOST gracious Soueraigne, I haue presumed to offer this Copie of my Sermon to your Maiestie, as an accomptant for that which I did in your seruice. Not for any doubt I haue of the Serenitie of your a∣lowance: but to conuince the ca∣lumniations of a tragicall trifler, so farre transported for the losse of his Helena, that he for∣gets all duties, becomes a reuiler of the Prince of the peo∣ple, a false accuser of the brethren, and an inhumane dis∣quieter of a soule that liues with God. Tantaene ais coe∣lestibus irae? The brethren to whom hee sends his nar∣ration, are Reuerend in deed, but so respectiue of the Churches tranquilitie, that the idle sound of his Trum∣pet will make no Alarum. Their consents did runne in the action: or if a small number were doubtfull for a

while, some persons of Honour, and right good place, are yet aliue to testifie, that most of them came willingly at the end of this Sermon; to acknowledge their satisfaction. Where such independencie is, as hee insinuateth, it may be shewed fairely and regularly, without his Potlids or staues in corners. But if our premises haue incongruous conclusions: what validitie is there in his conclusions, that haue no premises at all? Superbo oculo veritas non vide∣tur, syncero patet. God open his eyes that he may see the Princely care, singlenesse, and zeale of your Royall heart, sparing no charge for setling this gouernment, which hath beene most auncient and profitable in the Church: That hee may praise God for the sweetnesse of your Nature, as his countrymen vse to doe: And pray to God for the length of your dayes, & continuance of your happy Raigne, as all your subiects haue iust cause to doe. So submitting my poore labours to the censure of your clemencie, I will euer rest
