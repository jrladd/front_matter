My LORD,
THe following Treatise receiving the Appro∣bation of a most Inge∣nious Peice, it has encouraged the mak∣ing and publishing this Translation, to supply the scarcity of French Copies, and to satisfy the Curious, who do not understand that Language. And because the Author of the Essayes
 has both the Honour of Your Lordships Acquaintance, and also the Favour of Your good Opinion: Therefore Your Lord∣ships Patronage and Protection, is Hum∣bly desired to this Translation, which will be found a just enough Representation of the Author Thoughts and Sentiments. And the Publisher hath presumed to pre∣fix Your Lordships Name to this, that He may testify his Duty to Your Lordship; and likewise because of Your Lordships readiness to encourage all Ingenious Studies and Enterprises.
