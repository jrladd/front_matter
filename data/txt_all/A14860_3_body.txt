THe Lord (as Iob wit∣nesseth) doth visit man euerie morning, and trie him euery moment.
Iob 7.18. Many and sundrie are the waies of these his trials, Gods children haue ex∣perience of them, you your selfe
haue had your share in them: I therefore send vnto you heere an anchor, wherewith at all times you may take sure hold fast, though the tempest arise, and the winaes blow,
Matth. 7.26. and the waues dash neuer so violently against your ship. I commend this little medi∣tation following vnto your rea∣ding, not for the worthines of it, as it is here contriued, but for the sweete comfort of that matter to which it aimeth. I know you are better stored with richer medita∣tions in your own breast, then my barren garden can present vnto you; yet I presume so much vpon your wōted kindnes, that I doubt not of your acceptance of these my abortiue labours, who haue giuen me so great encouragement from time to time, by your attentiue presence at my implumed Lec∣tures.
The Lord hath opened your heart (as he did the heart of Ly∣dia) to be attētiue to those things which are taught;
Act. 16.14. whē the grea∣test part of your sexe and ranke, like Martha, encumber them∣selues about many needles things,
Luke 10.41.42. like Mary you haue chosen the better part. Goe on in that good course which you haue begun; if this poore mite which I offer here vnto you may in any sort in this good course further you, I haue all that my wishes aime at. And so I commend the following me∣ditation to your vse and Gods blessing.
