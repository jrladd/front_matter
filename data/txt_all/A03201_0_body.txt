SIR,
EXcuse this my boldnesse, (I intreat you) and let it passe under the title of my love and respect, long devoted unto you; of which, if I endeavour to present the world with a due acknow∣ledgement without the sordid expecta∣tion of reward, or servile imputation of flatterie, I hope it will be the rather accepted. I must ingenuously acknowledge, a weigh∣tier argument would have better suited with your grave imployment; but there are retire∣mēts necessarily belonging to all the labours of the body and brain: If in any such cessati∣on, you will daigne to cast an eye upon this weak and unpollish't Poem, I shall re∣ceive it as a courtesie from you, much ex∣ceeding

any merit in mee, (my good mea∣ning onely accepted.) Thus wishing you healthfull ab in body, ubled connt in de: with the happi fruition of both the temporall felicities of the world present, and the eternall blessednesse of the life future; I still remain as ever,
