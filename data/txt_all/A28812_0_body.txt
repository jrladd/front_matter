Gentlemen,
THIS Sermon Preach'd at your Feast, is now at your request made Publick, and presented as an acknowledgment of your undeserved Respects to me, and your kind Apprehensions of the Discourse it self: It was not any opinion of the performance (to the weaknesses of which I am not a little con∣scious) that hath made me comply with your desires to Print what I then Delivered; but an earnest desire and hope of Contributing in some measure to your Love, Veneration, and
Practice of the Duties therein recommended, which so nearly concern the Vitals and Honour of Religion, and all the great Interests of Mankind; which great ends, if these Papers shall any ways promote, either in you or others, as you will have no cause to repent in desiring, so neither shall I, in consenting to the Publica∣tion of them; especially since thereby I have the opportunity of Publishing to the World how much,
I am, Gentlemen,
