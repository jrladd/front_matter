Right Honorable:
THe Glory of the Meridian Sun, is the more resplen∣dently set off; by the foile and darknesse of a Shadow:

which is a perpetuall follower of his Light; as my ambition in all humble service is, to be unto your Lordship: The memory of so many Heroicall Ancestors, as (in all ages) have en∣nobliz'd your potent Family; toge∣ther with their Martiall and Re∣nowned Atchievements: doe for e∣ver stand recorded, in the Booke of Honour and of Fame. And that (were occasion fairly offered) your Honour hath Spirit and Bravery e∣nough, in a Military emulation, to arrive up to the heighth of their Glo∣ry: your constant and Noble De∣portment (as well in your private carriage; as of late dayes in your publike Triumph, when you were in∣stalled into that most Noble Order of the Garter) doe most evidently presage of you. This as it hath attra∣cted

all eyes and expectations: So hath it incouraged my low ambition (a∣mong the rest) to esteeme your Ho∣nour a fit Patrone for a Booke of this Nature, your innate and inbred ver∣tues; together with that Courtesie, Noblenesse, and Affabilitie, (the in∣seperable Companions of anciently de∣scended Honour) speak you so easie, of accesse; that my YONG ARTILLERY-MAN despaireth not of acceptance & admission, to kisse the hands of your great Lordship. The first-fruits, it is, of my weak endevours: and a Collec∣tion, meerly of my private observati∣ons. Such as it is, my humble request unto your good Lordship is, that out of the accustomed freedom and good∣nesse of your nature; you would be pleased to deigne acceptance of it.

And I withall beseech your Honour, to give pardon unto that presumption, which hath proceeded from devotion. I confesse it an ambition in mee, to soare so loftily in my Dedication. But as Alexander (sometimes) refu∣sed not a mean Present of fruit, from the hands of a simple Gardiner: so my hope is, your Honour will hold mee excused for offering so worthlesse and meane a Mite to so great and hono∣rable a Personage. But considering that the subiect of my Discourse is in∣tended for the bettering of the Souldi∣ers knowledge of the trained Bands; and that your Lordship is one of his Majesties Lieutenants: it may prove a good inducement to your Honours liking (who are known to be so great a lover of your Country) to vouchsafe

the protection and patronage of these my first endevours, whereby I shall for ever stand obliged in all humilitie, and remayne,
