REport (Right Honourable) that hath enobled your sin∣gular, and manifold vertues, by nature and fortune, to the Worldes recommendation, hath induced mee, to thrust into the open light this my abortiue issue, to be shrowded vnder the shadowe of your Lordships winges, the fruite of some idle houres, sith after many thoughts I could not excogitate any more pleasing recreation, whereon I might bestow times of leysure. The argument I confesse, is of too base con∣sequence; to procure your liking, or deserue your allowing. Neuerthelesse the force of dutie, and zeale, possessing the chiefest por∣tion

of mine interests, ouerrule my thoughts and resolutions, in hazarding the entertain∣ment thereof, at your fauourable courtesie, and construction. And if I may perceiue that your Lordship affoords the countenance, to grace my papers with the demonstration, of the extreamest degree of good liking, I shall be emboldned to raise my Muses note, that now yeelds harsh musick, to an higher key, a fairer fruite, of my better ordered vacant houres, and manifest my dutie to your Ho∣nour, in some matter of greater import, then a superficiall toy. But fearing to grow offen∣siue through tediousnes, I commit this sim∣ple work to your Lordships patronage, and your Honour to the Almighties protection: for the preseruation of which, I will pray continually. I ende.
