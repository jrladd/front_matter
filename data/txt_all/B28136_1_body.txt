Honoured Sir,
YOƲR great Kindness to me a poor Oppressed Prisoner, now in the Wards, or inward Prison of the Fleet, has been so great, (you being a stranger to me,) by your Charitable Visits, that I want Words to express my Grati∣tude; all that I can do to make you a Re∣taliation, is, by Obeyiny your Command, by giving the World a true and faithful Account of my CASE, which of late has taken up so much time in Their Majesties Courts, both of Law and Equity, wherein I shall Observe your Directions in Publish∣ing of it, without Reflections on Persons concern'd, and that I Relate the whole, as well that which makes against me, as for me, that so the Naked Truth may appear: which said Honest Directions I shall punctu∣ally Observe, being also inform'd by Livey in his Roman History, That he that Publishes a Lie to the World for a
Truth, is the greatest of Perjured Per∣sons, for he puts a Cheat upon the Ge∣nerations to come. Therefore I shall take this Method in what I Relate, as purely of my own knowledg, to doe it with that Sincerity and Truth, as becomes a good Christian, knowing that I must stand or fall by it at the last Day, before the great Judg of Heaven and Earth; and what I Relate as from others, I will Name my Witnes∣ses, and the place of their Abode, as near as I can, that if any has the Curiosity to inform themselves of the Truth of what I Repeat, they may apply themselves to them for their satisfaction. Truth and Inte∣grity are my Jewels, tho' my Enemies have taken from me my Estate and Liber∣ty, yet from these I will not part till I Die.
