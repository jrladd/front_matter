Right Reuerend & Honourable,
ONce more I make bold to present vn∣to your HONOR a testimonie of my most humble obser∣vance. It is an Ex∣position of the second Chapter of the Prophecie of Amos. My labours vpon the first it pleased your Lordship heretofore fauourably to accept and pa∣tronize. If these vpon the second may find the like entertainement, they haue their end. The beames of that splendour of goodnesse in you, which long since
 haue shined vpon many in this Vni∣uersitie, and me among the rest, me∣thinkes J still behold. How can J then but in memorie thereof, offer vp to your Honourable Name some Sacrifice of thankesgiuing? This is the best I haue at this time. Receiue it, my good Lord, such as it is, the sincere token of a thankefull heart. God Almightie, who hath made you an eminent, and an ho∣nourable pillar here in his Church militant, for the comfort of his people, giue you herein many dayes full of ho∣nour and comfort, and reward you with a Crowne of neuer-fading glory in his Church triumphant.
From my stu∣die in Christ Church in Oxford. Fe∣bruarie 14. 1619.
