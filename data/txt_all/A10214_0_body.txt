SIR,
I Thought my endeavours too poorly imploy∣ed, while they were restrain'd to the limits of a particular acknowledgement; wch forced me to comply with my ambitious humour, by mak∣ing this publick profession of my duty & observance. I may seem both Ignorant and Indiscreet to

promise any new thing in this fardell of Epistles to you, vvho are able to give lessons of Court∣ship and Civility to the most re∣fined Spirits of this age, yet I de∣serve pardon, if you consider that nothing is here but vvhat might either have bin written by you, or to you, and consequently de∣serves the approbation of the most malitious. For in the one your own Humanity, and in the other the Judgement of all the world is interessed: as is in all things that concerne your Par∣ticular, the repose,
SIR,
