LAdie most worthy, of most estimation,
In whome all goodnesse is together knit,
Whose vertues purchase fame, fame admiration,
Of holyest will, ioyn'd with a heau'nly wit,
Whose praise, if I would shew by word, or writ,
(A Theame too hye for Ciceroes Oration)
My words, from my thoughts reach as low would flet,
As my thoughts reach, from so high contemplatien:
Receiue in gree, this ill agreeing matter,
An idle worke in idle houres dispatcht:
The Persian King, whose power the world did threat,
Tooke in good worth a poore mans cup of water,
Who needes not scorne a whit to be thus matcht,
If to be good, be more than to be great.
