Most gracious and dread Soveraign,
HAving made a most diligent in∣quiry into the state of the Church of God, militant upon Earth, I do find that it is not limited to any one Country or Nation, as the Dona∣tists held; who fondly imagined the Catho∣lick Church of God to be confined to a Corner of Africa, in which they dwelt; nor yet inclosed within one Bishops Diocess, or Jurisdiction, as the Roman Catholicks pre∣tend, who uncharitably exclude all Christi∣ans Heaven, putting them into the State of Damnation, who are not subject to their
Bishop; vainly pretending to be truly Catho∣lick or Universal; as we do believe in our holy Creed. The Apostles preached not to one Country or Nation only, but to the whole World, according to our Lords Com∣mand; Go teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
I shall speak something of this persecuted Episcopal Church of England, whom the Lord, by his Providence, hath made Your Majesty Overseer: This Church, which was first planted by Joseph of Arimathea, some years before Rome, according to the purest way, as he had it from Christ and his Apo∣stles, the great Bishop of our Souls; and so hath continued a true Church, through much Persecution by the Heathen, and by the common Enemy the Papists, and by the Dissenters. As Gamaliel told the Jews; take heed, if it be of God ye cannot over∣throw it, lest you be fighters against God: No doubt this Church of England is of God, and cannot be overthrown. You have heard of the Persecution in Queen Maries
days, how she burnt twelve Bishops and Doctors, who sealed it with their Blood in the Fire, and Charles the First, who sealed it with his Royal Blood also; the Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed and Seal of a true Church.
We most humbly thank Your Majesty, that Your Majesty hath taken such care for this persecuted Church, which without doubt God prizes as the Apple of his Eye, in pre∣serving it from all these Eminent dangers.
And we most humbly thank Your Ma∣jesty, that Your most Royal Majesty hath been pleased to put those good Laws in Ex∣ecution, against those Enemies of the Church of England, that many of them have received Justice according to the merit of their Cause. The Lord bless Your Majesty, for taking such special care over both Church and State, for the good of us your unworthy Subjects, not doubting but Your Majesty will have the same care, so long as Breath shall remain in Your Royal Majesty, which the Lord of his Mercy grant for many Years to come, that we may receive the Benefit, and give
God the Glory: And all this we beg for the sake of our Blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ.
A word to his Royal Highness the Duke of York, under Grace and Favour. O Royal James! live for ever; Son to one of the best Kings that ever reigned; though David were a Man after Gods own Heart, and Solomon was a wise Man, yet Your Royal Father had less Errors than any of them. O Royal James, Heir to the Crown of England, after Your Royal Brothers Decease; as the case now stands, the Lord bless Your Lives with all blessings Spiritual and Temporal; and if ever Providence ordereth it so that You be Crowned King of England, and of the Domi∣nions thereunto belonging, that you may come to it in peace, and not swim to it in Blood, for then it will prove to you a Curse, and not a Blessing.
The Lord grant that you may maintain the true Government both in Church and State, as it now standeth, as Your Royal Bro∣ther doth at this time, and your Royal Fa∣ther
of ever blessed memory hath done, and as your Royal Grandfather King James hath done; especially this Episcopal Church of England, which Your Royal Grandfather told Your Royal Father, he having studied to find the true Church of God, he was very well satisfi∣ed that the Church of England was the nearest to the Primitive Church planted by the Apostles.
I shall add something more concerning the common Enemy the Papists, and Non∣conformists.
Our Saviour Christ saith, The time shall come, when they that kill you shall think they do God good Service: So did the Dis∣senters when they killed one of the best Kings that ever reigned; and so would the Papists, if they could have killed our King that now is; you see how they tollerated Murder, Treason, Perjury, and Rebellion; and he that could have killed Gods Vice∣gerent, should have done God good Ser∣vice; yea, it was thought he should have been Sainted for his good Service: Yea, this temporal Man of Sin might as well have Sainted the Spiritual Man of Sin, the De∣vil,
as to have Sainted these Priests and Je∣suits, whom Satan had put into their Hearts to do his will; let this temporal Man of sin pretend what he will, yet this wicked Plot, to kill our Soveraign Lord the King, came from the Devil, who is the original of all sin; for they reckoned to have sacrificed His, Royal Body to God, for the Honour of their Church; when God tells them to o∣bey is better than Sacrifice; that is, thou shalt do no Murder, and Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft.
Our Saviour Christ saith, I have chosen twelve, and one of them was a Devil: but what shall we call these Priests and Jesuits sent by the Man of sin, to kill Gods Vice∣gerent, the King? We may call them, as the Devil said their Name is, Legion, for they are many. Judas betrayed his Lord and Master for thirty pieces of Silver, but these Bloody Priests were to murder their Lord and Master for a bigger sum. Judas, when he had betrayed Christ, repented, and said, I have sinned, in that I have betrayed innocent Blood; but these Men were so far from re∣penting,
that they would not confess upon their Tryal, though it were proved by two of the Kings Witnesses.
You see then, Judas, for all he was count∣ed a Devil, yet shewed more of a Christian in repenting, and in laying down his Money again, than those Jesuitical Devils, which would not confess the Fact of their Devilish Designs, though it was proved against them. The Wise Man saith; He that covereth his Sin shall not prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh his Sin shall find Mercy: Yea, when the Man of Sin heard of the good success of this wicked Plot going on so well, the Conclave of Hell sang te Deum, and the Man of Sin gave them his Blessing; you see for all they sung to God for Joy, and the Man of Sin gave them his Blessing; their myrth was turned into sadness, and their blessing into a Curse upon them, as TYBƲRN will witness, and many Spectators that beheld them. O my Beloved, take special notice, that this Plot was not from God, but of themselves, with the help of Satan, and came
to nothing, as Gamaliel saith: I beseech you all good People that fear God, to take spe∣cial notice of the Death of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, which discovers more of inhumanity in their Religion, than any other of their wicked devices; if all the Devils in Hell had been let loose to their assistance, they could not have done more than these wicked Men did; they enticed him with flattering and lying words; as St. Paul saith; they told him if he would go along with them, they would shew him more of that wicked Conclave; and he being a Justice of the Peace, he might apprehend them: this honest Justice being willing to serve the King, according to his Oath, went with them, and they had him in∣to a place, where they secured him from the help of all his Friends; there, as I may say, they opened Hell Gates, and let out the De∣vils, who fell upon him, and wickedly mur∣dered him, he being without any com∣fort, but the mercy of Christ Jesus upon his Soul.

O all you Emperours, Kings, Princes, and Dukes, whom God hath ordained as his Vice∣gerents to execute his will upon Earth, take care you come not near the man of Sin, nor ad∣here to his deceivable bloody Doctrine, who allows his Priests to colour their Coats with the blood of Kings and Princes, and to wash their Altars with the blood of Gods Saints, and garnish their Sepulchres with the blood of Gods Elect; as our Saviour saith; and will not God avenge the blood of his Elect, that cry to him day and night? yea, he will avenge them speedily.
You see this Scripture fulfilled quickly af∣ter the death of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, how God did avenge his Blood upon his Murderers, witness TYBƲRN, and many that beheld them.
All the Massacres, both in France, and o∣ther places, the Chronicles speak of, in mur∣dering many hundred of poor innocent Pro∣testants, was done by that bloody Church of Rome.

All you Emperours, Kings, and Dukes, whom God hath ordered to execute his Will upon Earth, have a care that you do not oblige your selves to the Man of sin, by swearing Allegiance, or Canonical obedi∣ence; for then he makes you under the Man of Sin and Satan, his Vassals and Slaves, that when he calls his Councils, you must agree to his unlawful Decrees, which if you do not, he will put you into the state of Damnation, as he thinketh.
We see how this Church of England hath been approved on, going through the Firy-Tryal, witness the twelve Doctors and Bi∣shops in Queen Maries days, who sealed it by Blood and Fire; and Charles the First, of e∣ver blessed memory, sealed it with his Royal Blood also, who without doubt is now a Saint in Heaven; which except we could ex∣pect a better place of happiness than ever was spoken of in Scripture, we could never desire to go to a better place of Joy, than where this good King is gone, by the mercy of
Jesus Christ, who dyed for the Priviledge of this Church and State, hoping, and not doubting but his Royal Issue will maintain the same, ac∣cording to their Royal Fathers last Will and Testament, that they should take care of the Church, and love one another, then will their poor Subjects love their Royal Ma∣jesty above measure, in taking such care of this true Church of God, wherein contains all our happiness, both of Soul and Body; then will God love us, when we love him and his Vice∣gerent; for God is Love, and in him is no ha∣tred; then will he dwell in us, and we in him, then will God bless us with blessings both tem∣poral and spiritual, wherein our whole happi∣ness, both of Soul and Body, consists.
The honour of a King is to have the love of his Subjects; and what is the comfort of the Subjects, but a Godly and a pious King; which the Lord grant to us such a measure of grace, that we may, every one of us, love one another, but especially our King, and then shall Babylon mourn, but Zion shall rejoyce.

One thing more I shall not forget to put His Majesties Subjects in mind of, That if ever His Majesty should call a Parliament, that they chuse no Dissenters; for if God do not bless them to agree in matters of Religion, he will not bless them when they come to sit upon mat∣ters of State.
In the Fifth of the Galatians, it is said, The Works of the Flesh are these, Adultery, Fornica∣tion, Ʋncleanness, Lasciviousness, Witchcraft, Ha∣tred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Heresie, Sedition, Envying, Murder, Drunkenness, which do appear to be some of the sins of the Church of Rome; and that they that do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven: But the Fruits of the Spirit is, joy, love, peace, long-suf∣fering, gentleness, goodness, Faith, meekness, temperance, against such there is no Law; of which you can find very little in the acti∣ons of the Man of sin, but quite contrary to the said good Fruits.

A word in answer to the Presbyterians, whom a Person of our Neighbourhood told me, that they did attest they had no hand in the Death of King Charles the First: Which I wish from my Heart that it were true, which I fear is not, because the Scots sold him for cer∣tain hundreds of thousand pounds; because that blessed King spake in his little Book, called his Meditation, that he was sorry he was sold for more than his Saviour. Without doubt they sold him to the other Dissenters, which at last Crucified him. If it were a sin in Judas for sel∣ling and betraying of his Lord and Master, I fear it was a sin in them for betraying and sel∣ling of their Lord and Master the King. Ju∣das had some remorse in him, and seemed to re∣pent in, throwing down the Money, and saying, I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent Blood; and so I hope will these repent from the bottom of their Hearts, that their Souls may be saved in the day of the Lord; the which I beseech the Lord Jesus Christ to grant unto them through his Grace and Mercy, and that they may return to us again from whence they went out; and that they may renounce that
wicked Covenant, if they have taken it; that they together with us, and we with them, may serve God together in love, that this Church militant may fit us for the Church triumphant, where we may all meet together to sing Halilu∣jah to the great God that reigns for ever; where there is no division nor dissention, but all love and unity, which the Lord of his Mercy grant.
FINIS.
