SIRS,
THe remembrance of the strange Providences of my God, that were appa∣rent in bringing mee to bee your Teacher, and have bearn mee company ever since in the work of my Ministry amongst you, makes mee think, I was born, and still continue in the Land of the living for your sakes, for the service of your im∣mortal souls, to help forward your salva∣tion from that consuming burning wrath
that hangs over your heads, till Christ bee formed in you, and your naturs changed from what is earthly and sen∣sual, to that which is divine; This Ex∣hortation to an Holy life I send you, as be∣ing very confident, that without it, not one of you shall ever see the face of God but to your shame and confusion; if I press it hard upon your consciences, blame mee not, for it is my full belief, you must bee damned without is, and my love and pitty to you constrains mee to do my best to pre∣vent so sad a judgement. If you wonder how I dare venture to speak so much to you in Print; I tell you I dare do any thing for your sakes, yea hazzard the re∣putation of my discretion, rather than bee thought defective in my care to your ne∣ver dying spirits. It comes not seldome to my thoughts, and lyeth not a little pressing on my spirits, Ah what shall I do more for poor Newington to help them towards Heaven before I dye? somewhat I have done already, as many of you can bear mee witnesse, when with prayers and tears, not onely publickly, but from one house to another, I have beseeched you to bee reconciled unto God, and it is my
greatest grief I have found these six years since my coming amongst you, that I have done no more; but alas, what shall I, or what can I do more? I would you could but tell mee; shall I come and live in all your Families, that I may bee continu∣ally present to instruct, pray with, com∣fort, reprove, and over-see you? this is all impossible, I am but one man, and can no more multiply my presence, than I can my persons; or shall I daily follow you from house to house? How can it bee? my more publick work is great abroad, and not small at home, besides the care of a selected people lyes upon mee, that presseth more than most men imagine, except them that feel it, and I am but a man, and have but the strength of man, subject to bodily infirmities with my brethren. But however, I shall promise to do my best in this kind as I have begun, & to supply the want of my constant presence with you, I have sent you my whole heart in Print, that it may speak to you when I am absent; it is but little, yet I intended it should have been less, but it is well it is no more. Do but you accept it as kindely as it is offered, and improve it as faithfully, as it was
conscientiously penned, and I shall desire no more, being very confident it will then run and prosper; Which is the thing that is most earnestly prayed for,
