A Boate, a Boate, Iohn Taylor, come make haste,
Heere comes a Knight that faine would haue a cast:
He has nor wit nor Coyne, and thoult not care
For taking paines with such a paltry faire:
Yet prethee doo't this one time for my sake:
Tis not the worst paines that thou e'r didst take.
If thou obiect and thinke it is vnfit,
That thus I play the foole through lacke of Wit,
(For such a Booke to craue thy patronage,
Who art for VVit the mirrour of our Age)

In my most iust defence I thus reply,
VVhy mayest not thou lacke VVit as well as I?
I knowing that thou didst beget and name
Sir Gregory Non-sence (to thy long liu'd fame.
Thought it expedient and most requisite
That thou shouldst Patronize my lack of VVit.
Thou canst speake non-sence where the waters roare,
And so can I lacke VVit vpon the shoare:
Betweene vs two all Men may vnderstand
There's as much knauery by sea and land,
As all the world beside (so people say)
For oft the foole's the wisest in the play.
It may be thought that thou art no small foole,
Thou shew'dst great wit in writing great O toole.
VVell, to be briefe, J prethee entertaine
This simple Knight sprung from my simple braine,
And in like simple plaine true loue Ile be,
VVhile I can write, or speake, thy friend
