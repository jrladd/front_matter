MY LORD,
THis little Trea∣tise is due to your Lordship and to none else. For it containeth wonderful Priviledges,
and easie Obligations of Two, not onely the most Noble and Excel∣lent, but likewise the most Profitable Arch-Confraternities that have ever been in Gods Church, viz. The Arch-Confraternity of our Bles∣sed Lady, called the Ro∣sary, and the Arch-Con∣fraternity of our Seraphi∣cal Father Saint Francis. Though the whole Church of Somerset∣house,
and the Riches and Ornaments which raise its Splendor, pub∣lish to the World, the Queen Mothers great Piety: Yet notwithstan∣ding the Chappel of the holy Rosary is in some sort Yours, by a special Grant from Her Maje∣sty. It seemes there was an Holy strife between Her Royal Zeal, and Your excellent Fervor concerning the Decora∣tion
of that most Sacred Place: And after so Vertuous a Contest, the Queens Humility suffer∣ed it self to be overcome by Your Fervour, con∣descending that Your Pious Devotion to our Blessed Lady, should cause You even in your absence, to adorn and enrich that August Chap∣pel at Your proper Cost. Now for us Capucins, since we have the Honor
to wear the holy Weed of St. Francis, to profess his Rule, and to be his Children; and You, my Lord, as Her Majesties Great Almoner, being our Superiour, You are likewise Superiour of the Arch-Confraternity of our Seraphical Father. This little Book therefore be∣ing in so many respects due to You, it would be an act of Injustice to offer it to any other. To avoid
which, I here present it to Your Lordship, and with it, the hearty servi∣ces, respects, and submis∣sions of all the Capucins, and particularly of
My LORD,
