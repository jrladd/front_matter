Sir,
IN a Person of so great Worth as Your self, Ver∣tue
and Goodnesse must needs be not onely diffusive,
but attractive also, and that farre more then in inferi∣our
men. The boldnesse therefore assumed by me at this
time, in tendring to Your View and Judgement this poor
Essay (a weak endeavour of Service to our Countrey
(of which You are so true a Lover) will appear (I hope) the
more excusable: For as those Parts which deserve Admira∣tion
in You, cannot but command Offices of Hommage
and Gratitude from all good men; so those Parts which
render You humble, and gentle, and willing to pardon
other mens Mistakes, will induce you to interpret well that
Hommage and Gratitude. Sir, I have a very
low conceit of this Constitution, as it is now by me fashion∣ed;
but I have a strong Imagination, That it might prove
Publiquely advantagious, if it were by wise and consi∣dering
men better formed and compleated. I have
therefore purposely left a large Margent to my short Dis∣course,
that a better pen, and direction might change and
supply my failing Invention, and take the same liberty
to expunge the vanities of my tedious expressions. If
there be any thing here tha may but administer the least Oc∣casion
or hint to your Worth to be a more beneficiall

Patriot, I shall think it a happy Service; if not, yet let not
my fruitlesse wishes want your excuse; and you shall ob∣lige
me to be
Sir,
