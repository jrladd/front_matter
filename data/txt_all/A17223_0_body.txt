COnsideringe (most mygh∣ty Prynce), what greate benifites I haue receyued of this your
 maiesties realme of Eng∣lande which hath so mani yeares nourished and suc∣coured my poore lyfe hy∣therto. I thought my self no lesse bound of very du∣ty but to shew some office of recompensation there∣fore. Againe consideringe ye feruent proceadynge of your maiestie in settynge forth the worde of god, & also ye towardnes of moste your subiectes which as a rype haruest do lacke but workemen, to set them for¦warde, I thoughte I coulde gratyfy in no other
 thynge more both youre moste graciouse entente & the desyre of this youre realm, which now I take for myne owne natiue coū¦tre, than to serch out some necessary doctryne, whiche coulde do all my countrye men good. Vpon the whi∣che consideracion here I brought out of latine into englysh a worke of Bul∣lenger most fruytfull & expedient for all tymes na¦mely for this tyme moste necessary, concernynge the ordre of a common wealth the institution of magi∣strates,
 the vse of ye sworde the obediēce of subiectes, the ministratiō of warres, the instruction of soul∣diours. Whyche thinges I think to be so necessary for these daies, that nothīg can come in more meite time or place. And as this worke of this excellent au¦ther semyth to me most ex¦cellently handeled full of most notable histores, and excellent doctrine, so I coulde fynde no other so meite to dedicate it vnto, as to your excellēt maiesty to whom not only I dedi¦cate
 this worke and labor of myne, but body life and goodes to your gracious pleasure, wyth my conty¦nuall prayer also to al¦myghty God longe to pro¦spere your florishing state to his glori and fortherāce of his welbeloued church. Amen.
