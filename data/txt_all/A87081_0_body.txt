RIght Honorable, Necessity hath as many tongues and pennes as Briarius hands, Argus eyes, or sin advocates, and those dictators of our miseries, never had a juster cause than now to supplicate for their own silence, and by a divine proportion, Charity hath not only large bowels but many and open eares, so that the speakers and auditors have an equality in number. No Nation hath had larger tastes of the first, than the English in Ireland, nor any Nation ever produced a larger crop of the last (to furnish the first) than England): The traine oyle of our calamities hath made the lamps of their Charities to shine the world o∣ver, whilst the oyle from their cruses and meale from their barrels hath not failed to furnish, us & as they are to be honored for this crop, we are also to honor you for the carefull storing and distributing thereof. Me thinks I find no yeare of Jehoash so famous as that in the 2 of Kings, 4, 5. and 15. v. in which was the care to repair that holy fabrick dedica∣ted to God, and in that work nothing more glorious than the perfor∣mance of that trust by them that were to effect this repaire; for it seems the generall contribution was not so rich or great, as the honesty of those entrusted. The calamitous Protestants are the temples of the holy Ghost, which like that ruined structure, want repair, that a supply of the former cares and zeale were requisite, & as thousands cannot but praise God for the indefatigable pains and labours in your pious distributions, yet divers that have staid longest and ventured, suffered, and effected most, have not had so much as a tast of this hony, with Jonathan on the tip of their rod to cheere their feeble and fainting soules spent in the pursuit, and slaughter of those Irish Philistims, who thirst after some of the hony combe of Charity, pine for It, and most fa∣mish without it. I repine at no mans successe, but it appeares to mee that those wyich brought their cloaths and meanes away before the rebellion, had warm'd a house, should find Cloaths, meanes and warm'th

here, when as such as staied to spend and venture their lives, and blou should find neither, so that I must conclude our desires to do service there, detain'd us so, that now our desires cannot be serv'd. I am not ignorant what just cause of suspence may be given your honours from those that usurped the name of ruined Protestants, and of some which I could produce that have gone by their own virgin Sirnames, their first husbands, and their husbands by two names, which cheating of the publick charity, might justly incense your honours to explode the truly deplorable Petitioners which are as worthy of relief, as the o∣thers of punishment, were it the only laboure of some knowne man, to examine the petitions, and subscriptions, certificates, and persons, this abuse might be reformed, if not cured; but I hope some particulars will nor ecclipse, thoug it a darken a while a publike good, and with Charity, which warmed these impostures will heate, such as truly want her beames: the Sun alters not his course, because the earth is ful of lay-stals. No Act of the Apostles wins more upon me, than their publike charity transferred into Judea to the distressed brethren, by the hands of Saul, and Barnabas in those dayes of emptinesse, Acts 11.29.30. The same your honours are to us the sons of consolation, in which act of theirs, thete was not only a good purpose, but a prosecution. The care of Joseph in proviping is not to be preferred before that of his di∣stributing, by which he not only sustained the subject, but enrich the King, you have the same power for what relief you offered to the mem∣bers, Crowns the head (Christ Jesus) who signes acquaintances to cha∣ritable works with his own hand (insomuch as you have done it unto one of these little ones, you have done it unto me.)
I more like the peace and charity of Constantine the first Christian Emperour procured to the poore Christians, then his erecting or repair∣ing their Churches, and I more applaud that Centurion, for loving the Jewish nation, then for building them a Sinagogue, because the tem∣plls made with hands (which I honur as publick places appointed for Gods worship, may become dennes of thieves, cages of uncleannesse, or as amongst the Irish (Jewes in some traditions) publik market pla∣ces,

or what is more terrible as I have known the two most famous Cathedralls in Dublin made a meeting place for uncleannesse, though all this while that holy pile is innocent, though abused, or which is yet worse, may become Popish Sanctuaries, refuges for the most impious or lastly be made the storehouses, or supporters to such profane, and Idolatrous images, as the purer Temples of the Holy Ghost (which Temples we are) shall not onely abhorre, but demolish, as Moses the Calfe.
The Apostles were not stiled oratores, and vinatores, for their heaven∣ly tilling, or pruning the Church, but for sowing their bread upon the waters, and relieving the living vines, the distressed Saints, O heaven∣ly Charity the last companion of the soul, thou immortall vertue, how many naked hast thou to cloath, hurt to heale, hungry to feed, impriso∣ned to visit, captived to ransome, fatherlesse to protect, harbourlesse to lodge, widowes to defend, many of which thy lengthened arm hath reached, even as farre as Argier, Germany, and that disconsolate neighbour of thine, the most disconsolate of all Ilands gro∣ning grieving, pernning Ireland, who according to her ancient cu∣stome, hath sent thee, knowing yet O Englands charity, thy breasts full of milk, and bones of marrow,) thousands of her children to softer, for there she feares like Tekoahs widow, The bestiall family is risen upto destroy the heire, and quench his sparckle which is left, and shall not leave to her husband either name, or posterity upon the earth, your ho∣nours being the pious agents to the English charity, may comfort this just necessarie, and considerable complaint, saying with that heaven∣ly hymnist, go to thine house, and I will give a charge for thee, amongst the rest of the unrelieved, I come like Esau from the Irish woods to your honours, to whom I speak, as hero Isaac, in the same words and bitternesse, hast thou but one blessing my Father, blesse me, even me also my Father, and the God of compassion blesse your Honours, that you as a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, may help to lead us that lately came from that land, now the house of bondage, in our poore and wearie pilgrimage, to the land of promise, where God shall return your sheaves with a harvest these are the prayers of your devoted ser∣v.
