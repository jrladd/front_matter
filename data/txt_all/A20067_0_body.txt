SIr, the loue I owe your name
(for some fauours by mee re∣ceiued
from that noble-min∣ded
Gentleman (your kinse∣man)
wh is now imploied
vpon an honourable voiage
into Turky) makes my labours presume they
shal not be vnwelcome to you. If you please
to read me ouer, you shall finde much mor∣rall
matter in words merily et down: and a
serious subiect inclosde in applications that
(to some, whose salt of iudgement is
taken off) may appeare but triuiall and
ridiculous. The streame of custome (which
flows through al kingdoms amongst schol∣lers
in this fashion) beares mee forward and

vp in this boldnes: It being as common to
seeke patrons to bookes, as Godfathers to
children. Yet the fashion of some patrons
(especially those that doate more vpon mo∣ny,
who is a common harlot; then on the
Muses who are pure maides, but poore ones)
is to receiue bookes with cold hands & hot
liuers: they giue nothing, and yet haue red
cheekes for anger, when any thing is giuen
to them. I take you (Sir) to bee none of that
race: the world bestowes vpon you a more
worthy Caracter. If the Art of my Pen can
(by any better labour) heighten yor name
and memory, you shall find my loue.
