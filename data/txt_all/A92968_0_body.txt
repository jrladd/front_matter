SIR,
I Remember amongst the le∣genda aurea of the antient Philosophers, it is recorded of Aristippus, Scholar to Socra∣tes, that Cum civibus aliquot suis navigans naufragio es eje∣otus; quum in littore vidisset figur as Mathematicos in littore depictas: salva, inquit, res est

Et ingressus civitatem proxima investigavit, qui nam essent illic disciplinarum studi∣osis, cum his ubi congressus est summa cum humanitate tracta∣runs non ipsum modo, verum & etiam comites illius. &c. When he was at Sea with some of his Country-men, they were by Shipwrack cast upon the shore of a strange country Aristippus perceiv∣ed some Mathematical figures drawn in the sands: Be of good comfort friends (quoth he) for I see the steps of men: assuring himself and his com∣pany, that there he saw the
 Emblems of Vertue, and that the Students therein could not be far distant; from whom they might expect courteous entertainment: and so they found it.
Sir, I am much encouraged to present this little Piece to you, having seen your steps; and in this tempestuous age, wherein there is a Shipwrack of almost all delightful stu∣dies, the steps of men, of lovers of Minerva, appearing about your coasts: I say, this comfort affords me so much confidence, as to presume this Translation will be accep∣table to you: rejoycing that
 some plants of Apollo flourish in your pleasant playns; so that I desire you amongst the rest to receive this little branch within your walls; from whence I doubt not but you will gather profitable fruits: which is the Ambition of

London, ult. Novemb. 1656.
