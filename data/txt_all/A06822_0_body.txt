MY dutie to your Lordship hum∣bly
remembred. Although the
seruice which I confesse I doe
owe vnto your Lordship in a
manner from my childhood
for many fauors, doth so much
oblige me, as I cannot thinke
how euer it may fall in my po∣wer
to expresse it: yet cannot I but acknowledge that
those fauours of yours, whereby any publike trust or ser∣uice
hath been committed to me, doe sit neerest my heart,
and as often as I do thinke of them, doe call me to a stric∣ter
account then any others, which doe onely touch me in
a priuate qualitie: for that in the one, I am onely obliged
to acquite my honesty towards your loue: but in the others
I am bound in a sort to make good your iudgement, and
to iustifie the choise you haue made of me, as a seruant of
the State, for whom your selfe are accountable to her from

whom all power in our State is deriued. The sense which
hereof I haue in the inwardest retraite of my soule, is the
cause I haue thought my dutie both to you, and to the
State not a little interessed, in a report very vulgar in
many mens mouthes in the Citie, and by this time per∣haps
spred ouer the Realme. And confirmed by a Pam∣phlet
printed, contayning a narration of the late seruice
done vpon the Gallies: wherein no mention being made,
neither of my selfe, nor of any of her Maiesties Shippes,
nor of our nation, wee are all secretly touched with some
note, either of negligence of the things committed to vs,
(I specially) or of vnskilfulnes, or of want of courage:
from the staines of all which it importeth me to cleere my
selfe, not onely for mine owne sake, and our nations; but
in some sort for your Lordship, who through my errors
cannot but be wounded, for the ill choise made of me, for
so great a charge: I haue therefore (though against my
nature, which delighteth not to talke of my selfe) been
forced for your Lordship, and all other mens satisfaction,
to expresse in a few lines, a true report of all that was done
in that seruice: which as it is free from affectation of
glorie to my selfe, or of imputation to others; so doe I vp∣on
all the dutie I owe, both to your Lordship, and to my
owne reputation, vndertake to make good in euery point
thereof. Beseeching your Lordship notwithstanding, not
to repose your selfe onely vpon mine owne assertions: but
by diligent inquisition (which is not hard for your Lord∣ship
to make, hauing so much power ouer the whole com∣panie
that serued with me) throughly to enforme your
selfe of as much as may suffice to satisfie your iudgement:
which if thereby you shall finde confirmed so much as not
to repent you of the trust by your fauour committed vnto

me, it is the vtmost of my desire, weighing otherwise little
what the vulgar conceits of such as either cannot, or will
not thinke aright, shall esteeme of me: if by this true re∣port
of my seruice they will not be satisfied. For it is those
that can iudge, whom I desire most to content, and spe∣cially
your Lordship, to whom I doe with as much truth
and synceritie dedicate all other seruices which I
may be able to doe, as I haue vsed in setting
downe this: which I beseech you to
accept as a small testimo∣nie
thereof.
