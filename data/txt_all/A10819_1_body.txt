Right honorable:
THe favourable countenance and fur∣thering Respect which my Prede∣cessors received of that renowned Ge∣nerall, and ever memorable and remarkable Martialist the Right Honourable the Earle of Devonshire, of never dying Memory, your Lordships late deceased Honour'd Father, toge∣ther with the Duty and Oblegiance, all those of my Quality owe unto your Honour; by reason of the Place and Dignity most deservedly You are in, and called to; makes me of So∣crates Opinion, in acknowledging all my ut∣most

not able to reach the halfe height of your Lordships Favour: Wherefore labouring like the Bee, sucking from the choycest Flowers the best Honey I can gather, the night of rest being come, I bring it to the Hive of your kind acceptance, and there leave it, as much labour bestowed about little, till diligent im∣ployment may more amply increase it. Right Honourable, I am loath to be troublesome, especially where affable Gentlenesse out paceth any merit in my Selfe: Therefore presenting your Lordship with this Treatise of Gunners Art, and my attendant Service, when it shall please your Honour to imploy me; and pray∣ing devoutly for the endlesse prosperity of You, and yours, I humbly conclude
