RIght honorable, hauing found this booke of profitable concernings and pleasant de∣lights, collected by the diligence of some one, who it should seeme ouer heard the matters, at such times as they were talked vnder an Oake in the parke at Kenelworth, some few yeares past: I thought it my dutie, meeting with the sub∣stance thereof, to dedicate them vnto such a principall worthy as your honors selfe, who haue alwaies hitherto bin found florishing and budding forth to all vertues, in such forward sort, so as the world hath conceiued an vn∣doubted hope, you will alwaies hold greene and lasting in the increase of them, without suffering any rottennesse or corruption of vices at any time to approach you. Fur∣ther, because the principall subiect of matter herein con∣tained setteth out the notablenesse of such former wor∣thies, as haue through the perfection of vertues absolute in themselues, deliuered successiuely the fulnesse thereof  ouer vnto their posteritie, it could not but meane your worthy selfe, especially when I called to minde the exam∣ple of your honorable father deceased, who in his life time ataining to the tipe of vertues worthily acquired, through the full & entire possession of them, was no doubt in him∣selfe sufficiently able to deliuer thē ouer as peculiar & pro∣per blessings to his worthy ofspring, so that now they are found no lesse excellent & effectuall vertues in your selfe & the rest of his succeding children, thē they were in his antecedent selfe. Withall I most humbly beseech your honour, not to thinke I presume hereby to adde any forces to your strong vertues, which are already suffici∣ently knowne and magnified, euen of them that are best able and most worthy to iudge: but rather being priuie to my owne vnworthinesses, onely desire to shew, that there neither is, nor hereafter shall be, any abilitie to do dutie hidden in me, which for lack of diligence I would leaue vnperformed: Neither go I about to thinke that it is possible for me to expresse that which belongeth to the due desert of your incomparable vertues. A matter also superfluous for me to do, considering that euen as the shadow followeth the body, so glory and renowme asso∣ciateth the excellent parts of noble and well deseruing men. The principall thing right honourable that I had herein to regard, was that the matter might fall out fit and beseeming the dignitie of your worthy selfe, whom I haue bin bold to choose as patron to present the argument of this booke vnto: wherin I confesse I haue not so tho∣roughly obserued my charge neither, but haue wittingly faulted therein also, foreknowing as I do, that your ho∣nor can spare no houres from the vtilitie of common∣wealths matters, to bestow so much as one looke vpon the vnworthinesse hereof. Yet for their sakes, who vn∣doubtedly
 if they will, may reape benefit hereby, I haue made bold to hope your honor will vouchsafe to en∣able it, wherein you may according to the words of the Gospell hauing enough your selfe, receaue at my vn∣worthy hands that also, whereof you haue no neede. If your honor for their sakes vouchsafe to agnise my duti∣full endeuoures, it will prooue such a sufficient reioy∣cing vnto me, as shall binde me for your so great fauour and pardon, dayly to pray for your honours encrease and growth vp to all the happinesses your heart can wish. Be∣seeching almightie God further, that as mightie Gedeon receiued strength and furnishings, of all necessary aids and meanes to preuaile and ouercome his enemies the
Madi∣anites, at the time of his faithfull seruing and calling vpon God vnder an Oake in Ephah. Euen so vnder the seruice and command of our gracious and neuer fading greene Oake, planted and watered by the hand of God, to be the shelter of vs all vnder her fauourable aids, your honor, to∣gether with such other worthies, tried and approoued partakers in all aduentures, may bring vnder the enemies to God and our Christian peace: so that in the end also, God blessing your labours, you may build vp an altar of peace for the behoofe of this land, as Gedeon did vnder his Oake, which he called Iehouah Salom, the God of peace.
