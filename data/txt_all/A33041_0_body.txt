Madam,
PResuming that the fame of the match∣lesse pen of my Re∣nowned Author, wil beget a Cu∣rious desire in your Ladyship, to employ some of your spare houres in the lecture of any

of his works, I am the more confident to offer at the Altar of your high Perfections, (where there is no lesse Judg∣ment to discerne then good∣nesse to excuse and pardon faults) the Translation of this small History the Lo∣ving Enemy, being the fruits of my broken and discontent∣ed houres, during my Im∣prisonment in Newgate for the Royall Cause, and the first endeavours of my unskilfull pen. I hope it will more easily finde a gracious acceptance

with your Ladyship, because it is a Sien taken out of th most flourishing Orchard  the honour of his Nation and glory of our Times, the famous B. of Belley, which I having ventured to tran∣splant and graft upon a Crab∣stock in mine owne ill culti∣vated Nursery, (though it bring forth many leaves and promiseth pleasing fruit) may by malevolent eyes be blasted in the bud, if not protected and cherish't by the favoura∣ble aspect of your Ladyships

Patronization, to whose most eminent vertues and no lesse udicious censure I shall ever make my appeale, and with all humility beg an acknow∣ledgment, as being
Madam,
