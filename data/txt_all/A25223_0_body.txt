SIR,
WHen I considered the Excellency of the Subject of this Book, and deserved Fame of the learned Author, I thought it not necessary to crave a Pro∣tection

for this Treatise by a Dedication of it unto any: be∣ing in it self far above the reach of detracting Calumniators. Yet I have made bold, humbly, to present it to your Honour as a pleasant and delightful Diver∣tisement from your many and great Imployments. In all Ages Musick hath been accep∣table to the wisest, greatest, and most Learned men, of whom many have been famous for their great Ability and Knowledge in this Science and Art. It was no dispraise to Da∣vid that he plaid skilfully on the Harp, and Sang well: the

Compositions of divers Ger∣man Princes are extant: neither is it the least of those Virtues which are eminent in your Lordship, that you are both a Lover of Musick, and a good Musician. The renowned Al∣stedius in this Compendium (not much differing in his Judge∣ment from the Opinion of the Generality of modern musical Classic's) does present the world with a great Light and Disco∣very of this Art, with the Sub∣ject, Principle and Affections thereof, with the curious Sym∣metry of Proportions: the pro∣portional Dimensions of

Sounds: the Variety of Dias∣tems: the admirable Series of musical Voices: the usefulnesse of Tetrachords: the several Genus's of Musick: and har∣monical Moods, which being expressed by Voice or Instru∣ment or both, do operate in∣eredibly upon the Affections. Wherefore I hope that this Book will be accepted both by your Honour, and all ingenuous Lovers and Professors of this Art, and the Errors thereof favourably pardoned by your Lordship and them. The Rea∣son which moved me to under∣take this Translation, was, be∣cause

I desired a Discovery might be made of some Princi∣ples of the Mathematical part of Musick, unto those ingenu∣ous Lovers of this Science, who understand only our own Language, to the End that by this means the transcendent Virtue and Excellency that is comprehended in the due pro∣portions of musical Sounds may be known unto them; which will give Satisfaction unto their Reason aswell as to their Sence. I do not think this unworthy my labour, because that many skilful Musicians have not thought it any Disparagement

to publish their Translations of the Works of famous Men, who did write of the Art which they themselves professed. As Meibomius Translated some Fragments of Baccheus, Alyp∣pius, Nichomachus, and others: the never to be forgotten Fran∣chinus, the Commentaries of Briennius, Aristides, Ptolomy, and others: and our English Douland, the Introduction of Ornithoparcus. In the Author's last Edition of his universal En∣cyclopaedia, I met with an Ap∣pendix to his Musical Synopsis, taken out of the writings of E∣rycius Puteanus; but not find∣ing

any thing new in it, only an ABCdary Repetition of the first Elements of Musick, formerly but more judiciously and large∣ly handled in this Compendium: and also some few Questions started by Cardanus, which are, for the most part more fully and Satisfactorily resolved by the Author; I did forbear the Translation thereof; not being willing to weary the Reader with the unnecessary recital of those things, nor your Lord∣ship with too tedious an E∣pistle, which I here conclude, humbly craving pardon for my boldnesse, and your Honours

favourable Acceptation of this Mite from your Lordships
