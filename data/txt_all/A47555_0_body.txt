May it please Your most Excellent Majesty:
I Cannot, without some despondency of Mind, and awful fear of the Greatness of Your Majesty, make an Offering at Your Sacred Feet of so small an Esteem and inconsiderable Value, as these following Histo∣ries. For having travelled long in remote Countries, and resided no less than eighteen Years in Turky, the World may reasonably expect some rich Returns unto Your Majesty in Persian Silks, and Tyrian Purples, or in the finest Carpets, and other Gayeties, in which the softness and luxury of the Lesser Asia did anciently abound: and may now judg me a Bankrupt, or ill Husband of my Talent, when they see me at Home trembling in Your Royal Presence, with a Gift no more worthy than a few Sheets of Paper; which being a Sacrifice inferior and beneath the acceptance of so Great a Monarch, I might reasonably fear, that they would take fire at the heat of Your just dis∣pleasure, were they not with all humility and reverence consecrated to the Royal Clemency. For in this glorious Title and Attribute, Your Majesty (as is notorious to the World) exceeding all the most Serene and most Clement Emperors that ever were, expects not from me, either Gold or Jewels, but rather a true Account of my Time, how I have spent it in the Service of God, and of your Majesty: and how I have administred that Publick Trust and In∣terest which was committed to my Management. Accept therefore, GREAT SIR, these following Discourses, to discharge part of the Account of my Time, with other Treatises which have been the Employment to fill up my vacant Intervals: the remaining account of my Hours are not to be justified by my own Report, but by the Testimony of others, whose Wisdom and Goodness will be as ready to own my Industry and Faithfulness in their Concernments, as they will be to excuse and pardon my Infirmities.
Ever since the time of Your Majesty's happy Restauration, my Lot hath fal∣len to live and act within the Dominions of the Turk, and there to move in a Publick Capacity; which though it was in an Administration of one of the lowest Note and Degree, yet the great Influence which the flourishing Estate of that Trade hath on the common Good of England, nourished in me a secret Pride and Satisfaction in that Employment, which called and raised up all my Endeavours to acquit my self therein with Prudence, Faithfulness, and In∣dustry; there being the same Regularity required in the Stars of the lower, as in those of higher Magnitude.
This hath been the first, and indeed the only Affair I ever managed for the Publick: for before Your Majesty's blessed Return, the Character noted on my Family of being Loyal, as it made them at first active and zealous in the Service of Your Glorious Father, so afterwards it famed them for their Suffer∣ings, and rendred them and me uncapable of Office. But Your Majesty re∣turning like the Sun, to animate and cherish all living Creatures, with an equa∣lity proportioned to their several Capacities, hath been pleased also to bestow a Ray of Your benign Influence on my self; whereby having received Com∣fort and Refreshment, I do with all sense of my Duty, and with entire Devo∣tion, pray unto the King of Kings for the Happiness, long Life, and immor∣tal Glory of Your Majesty, and with all reverence and humble submission, devote and consecrate my self, for ever to remain,
