My LORD.
TO whom can those two Pillars IACHIN
and BOAS erected before Salomons Tem∣ple,
bee more properly applyed then to your
Grace, who both in Church and common∣wealth
have showne your selfe to bee the li∣vely
Hieroglyphick figured by them, as your Memorable
deeds in both can beare record to Posterity? for with what
vigor did your piety and zeale extend it selfe in suppres∣sing

vice and superstition in the Churches conredited to
your care, and in establishing vertue and learning both
there and elsewhere, may appeare in the peoples harmoni∣ous
Concord in Religion to Gods glory, your eternall praise
and their eternall comfort; And as your Piety, so have
your Iustice, and travells beene extraordinary in settling
of the Church rents universally through the land, re∣possessing
every man of his owne tithes upon most compe∣tent
considerations; all which with your great gravity Mu∣nificence
and other endowments fit for the accomplishment
of so venerable a Prelate, have heaped upon you both Gods
blessings, our Royall Soveraignes favour, and the peoples
love, and reverence; But least others should deeme that
adulation which the mouth of verity would even extort
from your enemies, without further commendations of
your Person, I humbly recommend this booke to your Gra∣ces
Patronage, acknowledging the strong tyes I have to
continue
