MY LORD,
SVccession, Election, and Desert, by their Trinity of Power in a Vnity of Consent, are manuductive in your ascension to that Chair of Equity prepared for those worthy Pa∣triots who are to dispense Iustice impartially for the civil support of this great City; for the which dignity, Extraction, Nature, and Edu∣cation, have so copiously qualified your Lord∣ship, that you will be able in your Governing, to satisfie the highest Expectation. It was (not

long since) the expression of an ingenious Gen∣tleman (who honoureth your Name and Family) that, as the Iews chose their first Monarch for the magnitude of his Corporeal dimensions, You might have been more reasonably Elected Lord Mayor for the grandeur of your Animal and Intellectual Expansions: That you deserve (were not the Governing time of the City limi∣ted) to fill the Iustice-Seat of this Emporeum, so long a time as your Predecessor, Sir Henry Fitz-Alwin, a Member of this Company of Dra∣pers; who was the first Lord Mayor of this Antient Famous City, and continued in that Dignity more than 24. years, sans intermis∣sion: Nor is this opinion confined to the in∣dulgence of one single person, but is the Vni∣versal Iudgment of all rational Citizens; and such are the sober thoughts of
My Lord,
