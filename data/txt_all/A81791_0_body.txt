SIR,
HAving accidentally met with a small French Ma∣nual, newly printed in France; I found it fraught with such excellent Advice and uncommon In∣structions, not only for all Young Men in general, but more especi∣ally for a Young Person upon his going a great Voyage by Sea, that I esteem'd it well worthy (for the Benefit of our young
Noblemen and Gentlemen eve∣ry Day vying who shall go first to Sea,) to be render'd into our Tongue; and that it may have the more Credit and Reputation with those hopeful young Sea∣men (or with any other that shall happen to peruse it,) I have been bold, Sir, to offer it up to you, to be protected by your Name, under whose Patro∣nage and Protection my Father hath now put me, during your present Expedition to visit all the considerable Ports and Ha∣vens in the East Indies; humbly begging you to take in good part this small Token of my great Respect towards you, You who
have deserv'd the Respect of all Loyal English Men, and whom his Majesty hath so far respect∣ed, as lately, Sir, to name you Commander of the best Merchant Ship that ever was built in England; and to con∣fer the Honour of Knighthood upon you at the same time, as part of your Reward for the Signal Service you did his Ma∣jesty and this Nation, not only in the Year 1676 at Virginia, by reducing to their Allegiance that rebellious Colony, who had ravaged all the Country, burnt the City of James-Town, and driven away the Governour, whom you re-settled in his
Government; for which his Majesty (always bountiful to his faithful Servants) gratified you with a considerable Sum of Money; but also in 1678, for your in∣comparable Valour, and admira∣ble Success, against that po∣tent Pirate Canary Admiral of Algier in the New Rose, who attack'd your sole Merchant Ship of but twenty two Guns, and for∣ty Sea-men; with his Man of War of forty eight Guns, and six hundred Men; whom, after se∣ven Hours Fight, you forced to stand away, with the loss of two hundred Men, there being kill'd of yours not above seven or eight; for which Service
his Majesty was pleas'd to give you the best Medal and Chain that he ever yet bestow'd upon any Man: so that his Majesty accounts it a part of his Hap∣piness that he hath such a Wise, Valiant, and Able Sea-man. And you cannot, Sir, but esteem your self exceedingly happy in the Favour and Service of such a Prince, who knows better than any other Prince in Eu∣rope, and consequently in the World, how to value and re∣ward the Merits of all brave Sea Commanders and Officers; who knows better than all his Royal Predecessors, that the chief Interest of England is to main∣tain
the Empire and Soveraignty of the British Seas, and for that Reason, hath made it his con∣stant Business and Delight in Maritime Affairs, in Building, Rigging, Victualling, and Sailing of Ships; in understanding all our Ports, Harbours, Roads, Coasts, Seas, Flats, Sands, and above all, the best way of Naval Battels; in cherishing and en∣couraging all ingenious and expert Men for building of Ships, for casting the best Guns, for making the best Tackle, &c. in favouring and encouraging all Young Noblemen and Gentle∣men, who have any Desire to serve their King and Country at
Sea; in providing for the Edu∣cation of Youth in Navigation, and other Mathematical Scien∣ces; in taking Care for poor maim'd Sea Souldiers and Ma∣riners; and lastly, (to the great advantage of this Nation) in making choice of Captains for His Majesties Ships, who for Wisdom, Conduct, Courage, and other Abilities, excell all others in the World; such as the Right Honourable Lord, the Baron of Dartmouth, the Vice-Admiral Herbert, Sir Richard Haddock, Sir John Norborough, Sir John Berry, Sir John Wet∣wang, Sir John Wybourn, and many more stout, able, experi∣enc'd
Commanders. Sir, it is but just that all the World should be sensible of the Benefits and Advantages which his Majesty hath brought with him into England, and that the Sea as well as the Land should rejoyce thereat. This Kingdom was never so rich, so potent, so glorious, nor every way so flourishing, nor so happy (maugre all the wicked Designs and Hellish Conspiracies of those ambitious, revengeful, muti∣nous Spirits amongst us,) as in this Kings Reign, for above these twenty three Years; nor was there ever owing so much to any of our Princes as to this: the Consideration whereof is, I
believe, the chief Motive which induceth you to quit a Country quiet Life and plentiful Estate, and at his Majesty's Desire, to under∣take this long and long-lasting Voyage, which, Sir, I pray God to prosper, and encline you to continue your Favour to him who is both by Inclination and Obligation,
SIR,
