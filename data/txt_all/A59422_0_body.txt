May it please your Grace,
NOthing could ever contribute more to my having a good opinion of my self, than the being favour'd by your Grace: The thought of which has so exalted me, that I can no longer conceal my Pride from the World; but must publish the Joy I receive in having so noble a Patron, and one so excelling in Wit and Judgment; Qualities which even your Enemies could ne∣ver doubt of, or detract from. And which make all good men and men of sence admire you, and none but Fools and ill men fear you for 'em. I am extreamly sensible what ho∣nour it is t me that my Writings are ap∣proved by your Grace; who in your own

have so clearly shown the excellency of Wit and Judgment in your Self, and so justly the defect of 'em in others, that they at once serve for the greatest example, and the sharp∣st reproof. And no man who has perfectly understood the Rehearsal, and some other of your Writings, if he has any Genius at all, can write ill after it.
I pretend not of an Epistle to make a De∣clamation upon these and your other excel∣lent Qualities. For naming the Duke of Buckingham is enough: who cannot have greater commendations from me than all who have the honour to know him already give him. Amongst which number I think it my greatest happiness to be one, and can never be prouder of any thing can arrive to me, than of the honour of having been admitted sometimes into your Graces Conversation, the most charming in the World. I am now to present your Grace with this History of imon, which you were pleased to tell me you liked, and it is the more wrthy of you, since it has the inimitable hand of Shakespear

in it, which never made more Masterly strokes than in this. Yet I can truly say, I have made it into a Play. Which I humbly lay at your feet, begging the continuance of your Favour, which no man can value more than I shall ever do, who am unfeignedly,
