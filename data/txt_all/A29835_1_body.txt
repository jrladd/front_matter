May it please your Grace,
AS nothing confirms a Noble-Man more Illustrious than Learning, so

this makes his Conjectures little less than Oracles: for that which comes nearest to sense, does strike our Minds fullest, and leaves the most lasting Impressions in our Memories; where∣as bear Speculations, like thin and subtile Air, do most easily slide from our Ʋnderstandings, and leave but imperfect Impressions of their Appearances.
And since Solomon's Conclusion is very Excellent, That it is a Misery to live, if it were to live for no∣thing else, I presume to

think it my Duty as well as my Zeal to satisfie the World with the Phaeno∣mena of Providence, in shewing the Admirable Com∣posure and Contexture both of the Conglomerate and Conglobate Glandules in Humane Body; wherein are illustrated their proper Ʋses and Variety of Secre∣tory and Excretory Of∣fices.
A subject of very great Moment, collected from the Industrious Sweats of the most Learned Men of our Profession in all the

World: The which al∣though it may be pincht by the straitness and mean∣ness of my Capacity, the Author wanting Art to re∣commend it to Your Grace.
Yet herein he presumes the Tryal will with ease secure the Design of its common passage, Your Lord∣ship affording it Your Ho∣nourable Passport; Whose Soul is as Great as Your Name, and Your Illustri∣ous Nature as Generous, as Your Person is Eminent; You evermore being allowed the Father of our Nobility,

the Venerable Example of our Gentry, and the Ʋni∣versal Prayer of our Com∣monalty.
And as Your Graces Name does carry the Gol∣den World in it, so Your Puissant Nature does bear the Rich Pearl of Inestima∣ble Value.
From Your Noble and Princely Loyns have issued such Heroick and High-born Branches, of whom may be said, Virtutem ex te, for∣tunam ex aliis habuerint. Their Early Titles of Fame

came into the World with them, and will continue with∣out scratch or checquer so long as Time shall be allowed being therein.

My Lord,
Although I have presu∣med to Indulge my Pen to a considerable length in this Address, being too free with Your Sacred Minutes; yet give me leave to say, The Ʋniverse hath not the like Subject for Age, Prowess, Loyalty, Learning, Honesty and Goodness.
As Truth therefore does always play above-board, and eschews every Appea∣rance of Equivocation; so that which is really Excel∣lent needs no farther popular Estimation.
Pardon therefore▪ my Im∣perfections in this my Ad∣dress, and be pleased to rec∣kon me in the number of those who pay all Reverence to Your Virtues, and Obey∣sance to Your Illustrious Name, the which will highly Encourage me to as∣sume

the Liberty of subscri∣bing my self,
