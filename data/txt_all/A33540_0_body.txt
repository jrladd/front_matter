MY LORD,
THIS little Off-spring of my early Muse was first Submitted to Your Lordship's Judgment, Whether it shou'd be Stifled in the Birth, or Pre∣serv'd to try its Fortune in the World; And since 'tis from Your Sentence it has ventur'd thus far, it now Claims a sort of Title to Your Lordships Pro∣tection, which it cou'd not have the least pretence to from its own Merit; But 'tis Your Lordships Character to Encourage all great Attempts, though Unsuccessful: This was indeed a Bold one for a Woman at my Years, but I wou'd not offer my little Experience, as a reason to be Pardon'd for not acquitting my self well, (for I think the Incapacity of producing any thing better, a very ill Excuse for exposing a Foolish Thing) if the same inconsi∣dering Youth might not excuse the rashness of the Undertaking; And I shall be much less Pardonable, if the next I bring upon the Stage has not a better Title to the Favour of the Town. This seems to promise another attempt, which shou'd not be ex∣pected from one who Conceals her Name, to shun that of Poctress. I wish I cou'd separate them here, for then I shou'd be proud to own my self to the World, with all Respect,
My Lord, Your Lordship's most Obliged, and most humble Servant.
