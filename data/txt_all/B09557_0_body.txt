Worthy Gentlemen,
IT is not unknown to some of you, if not to all, that by your appointment I have

had the Honour to be a Sea Chirurgeon (for not a few years) in His Majesties Ser∣vice; and now I find my self in years, and cannot ex∣pect to hold it much longer at Sea; which turbulent Ele∣ment requires the best of a Mans Age in whatsoever Capacity he comes there to serve. But before my Exit I resolved to write this Abstract, according to what Skill and Experience I have attained for the use of others of my Calling,

who are the true Sons of Es∣culapius, and either are, or would be Sea-Chirurgeons, yet whose younger years, or non opportunities have not permitted them to aim at that degree of Experience, as is requisite; but are either al∣together unacquainted with the Sea Practice, or at least waies have not been in In∣gagements, and so need In∣struction. I undertake this, not that I think better of my self than of all other Sea-Chirurgeons; for there are

some who were my Con∣temporaries in the Wars, and their Knowledge I e∣steem as good, and some better than my own: But I undertake to write this, be∣cause I see others have not: And indeed being at present out of Imploy, I have more leisure time than others, or then my self desires, if I could remedy it: However at this juncture it falls out opportunely to me to write it, and especially for some reasons urging.
Now as I have had at all times my Imployments from Your Worshipful Compa∣ny, so I humbly Dedicate this Book unto you. I have taken what care I can to write as becomes a Chirur∣geon for the good of those that will practise by it, that they may be provided with Knowledge to help Sick or wounded Sea men, when there is occasion: More espe∣cially considering Your Ma∣ture and Piercing Judgments to whom I present it: I wish

I could have done it better, but it is the best I can, and I hope it will find your Candid Reception. So wishing you all Health and Happiness, I Subscribe my self
