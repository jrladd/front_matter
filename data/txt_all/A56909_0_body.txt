I know Madam, that this Play in it self is not at all calculated to the humour of the present times, the Subject being too grave, and the Lines too modest; nor is it (to speak Modishly) showish enough. Yet what makes it unfit for others, adapts it the more for your view, whose Vertues are so great, and whose Judgment so clear, that as the first sway you against the present humour which delights the World, so the last defends you from being carried away only with vanity and show.
And the assurance I have of this, gives me the confidence to add, That the contrivance (though it be but one single Plot) is so neat and curious, and the contest between Love and Nature main∣tained every where to that height, that I cannot doubt but you will find some Divertisement in it, so far as Monsieur Quinault, whose it was in the Ori∣ginal, had a part in it: and as for the English it speaks, I must wholly leave to your Ladyships Judg∣ment: with the same submission that I subscribe my self
Madam,
