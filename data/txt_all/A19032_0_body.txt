WHEN I call to my re∣membrāce (right vvor∣shipfull Sir) vvhat our merciful and good God hathe doone for vs, by his vnspeakeable omni∣potencie, and also what giftes hee hathe indued man vvithall, vvee can not chuse, but be thank∣ful to him for his vvor∣thie benefites bestovved vpon vs: vvho so noteth substācially from time to time vvhat vvorthie instrumentes God hath raised vp in all artes and sciences, as some passing in singlenesse of gifts as Aristotle, Galen, Ptolome, Plinie, vvith other, vvith those vvorthie Oratours the Grecians, as Demosthe∣nes, Isocrates, and that vvorthie Romaine the Prince of Eloquence Marcus Tullius Cicero, vvhose excel∣lencie hath surpassed all others, and bene leaders and scholemasters to all others. It vvas not vvithout great cause (right vvorshipful) that man is called Mycrocos∣mos, that is to say, a little vvorlde: it vvas not vvithout great consideration, that Aristotle calleth him the ser∣cher

of secretes: for vvhat thing is there in this vvorld but man hath sought it out, be it neuer so harde or ob∣scure? vvhat vertue in stone or plant or any grovving thing: yea the vertue of beasts, fishes, fovvles, and ser∣pentes, and vvhatsoeuer is conteined in the earth, aire, vvater, or fyre, mettals, mynes of golde, siluer, leade, tinne, yron &c. In fine, how excellēt in al philosophie, asvvell naturall as morall, as Arithmetike, Geometrie, Astronomie, Cosmographie, & besides all these, those moste excellent historiographers: and yet in my mynd this surpasseth all others, that is to say, to be an excel∣lent Oratour, singular in orations, pythie and ingeni∣ous in vvriting Epistles, for therby is brought to passe the moste excellent things for publike gouernment, as also for euery mannes priuate cause and vse: for vvho knovveth not vvhere learning and good gouernement consisteth, their orations bee of moste excellent force to set foorth hovve tymes haue bene passed, vvith the tyme present, and also to giue vvarning, and foresee for time to come, hovve the good and vertuous haue merited and receyued perpetuall fame, as to the ouer∣throvve of the vvicked too their reproche and igno∣mie. So (right vvorshipfull) this booke vvhich I pre∣sent vnto you, is stufte vvith pleasant orations, fine e∣pistles, singular complaintes, vvith matter mixt so fit∣ly and aptly to serue the turne of all persons, not cu∣rious nor filled full of obscure and darke sense, but playne and pleasant, depending and ansvvering one an other, vvith most delectable matter for all causes, as vvell incouraging the bashfull person and covvarde to bee valiant, as the vvorthie ladies and damselles in

their amorous Epistles, feruente complaintes of iniu∣ries handled moste excellently: And yet I confesse not so graue and vvorthie matter as your vvoorship deser∣ueth to haue. Therfore I craue pardon at your hands for this my rashe enterprise, trusting in God you vvill receiue it in good part as a token of my good vvill to∣vvards you, and though it yeld not so pleasant a grace in the Englishe toung as it dothe in the Frenche, the vvhiche it vvas vvritten in, I knovve youre vvoonted maner and good nature is to take smal thinges in good part, vvhich hath imboldened me at this present, to de∣dicate this booke of the Treasurie of Amadis of France vnto your vvorship, & vvhen god sendeth to my hand any other, I do intend to make ye partaker therof. And therfore least at this present I shoulde seeme to be ouer tedious vnto you, I cōmit you to God, vvith my good Ladie your vvife, vvith all youre familie, praying to God for your prosperous and good succese in all youre affaires and enterprises.
