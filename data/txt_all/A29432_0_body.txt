YOur Lordship, I trust, will not bee displeased that your name is set before these Truths which your heart does love, and whereunto in the best companies of the whole Isle you have given at many occasions your chearfull countenance and zealous patrociny; in the study whereof I have been oft both encouraged and assisted by your Lordships pious, wise, and learned informations.
It has been of a long time the wish of my heart to have had nothing to do with Po∣lemick writings; the bodies of sojours are no more subject to wounds and manifold hardships, then the minds and names of disputant Divines do lie open to various vexa∣tions. The weary, starved, bleeding soulder longs no more for a safe peace, then a spirit harassed in the toylsome labyrinth of thorny debates, pants for that quietnesse which only the finall overthrow and full subjugation of errour can produce. How plea∣sant will that day be to the sonnes of peace, when the Lord shall make good that word which by the mouth of two of his ancient witnesses he has established, when according to the Testimony of Isaiah,Isa. 2. syllabically repeated by Michah,Mic. 4.3. we shall beat our swords into plow-sheares, and our speares into pruning hooks, that we may walk together in the light of the Lord? But so long as Divine Dispensation besets our habitations both spirituall and temporall, the Church no lesse then the State, with great numbers of daring and dangerous adversaries, we must be content, according to the call of the Prophet Ioel in another case,Ioel 3.▪ to prepare warre, to beat our plow shears into swords, and our pruning hooks into speares; in this juncture of time the faint must take courage, and the weak say I am strong.
It seems that yet for some time the servants of God must earnestly contend for many pretious truths, which erroneous spirits do mightily impugne: for the help and encouragement of others in that warfare, I, though among the weakest of Christs souldiers, doe offer these my endeavours. It was my purpose to have made a farther progresse, and to have handled all I mention in my Preface; but being cald away from my present station by these who set me therein, upon the occasion your Lordship knowes, my studies in this kinde are broken off; so that this essay in Brownisme and Independency must go forth alone, or nothing at all.
My ay in these two is, and was in all the rest; First, in an historick way to set down the originall and progresse of the errour; next its compleat parts together in one ta∣ble, that at one view the whole face of the way may be represented; for I conceived it many wayes advantageous and very satisfactory in debating either a truth or an error,

to be brought to see the fountain and originall whence it hath sprung, the streams and issues whither the Tenet tends of it selfe, or is drawn by its followers; to behold a way not in its pieces, but the whole together from the head to the feet, the begining, midst, and end without any concealment or disguise. Thirdly, my purpose was to have examined the principall parts of every errour in a short, cleare, and popular method, considering the maine Scriptures that use to be alledged in the point either pro or contra.
I beleeve this my method will not be displeasing to any. I know it was acceptable enough to many of the Congregationall way when lately I did use it against the Can∣terburian Faction; but possibly some of the matter of my historick part may fall out to be fashions to the followers of the Tenets which I labour to lay open; for it is in∣avoydable to make a true and a full narration of any erroneous way, but such things must be told which will be displeasing to some; yet I hope I have given as little of∣fence in this kinde, as any other could have done in such a way of reatising; for all the passages that may be pungent of the tenderest skin, are such, as not only I con∣ceive to bee very true, but such also which I ever make presently good by sufficient Testimonies set downe fully at the end of every Chapter in the expresse words of the Authors. Secondly, the opinions or practises I alledge, are such as the parties them∣selves to this day do openly avow, or else have beene objected to them by very honest men long ago in print, and to this day, so farre as I know, are not taken off by any tolerable answer; in all that is over and above, I will undertake to give ample satis∣faction wherein soever I give the least offence to any.
I date appeale to your Lordships knowledge, and to many others who have beene acquainted with all my by-gone walking, how averse I have ever been from causing griefe to any, especially good men: so farre as I am conscious to my most secret in∣tentions, it is my hearts desire that all our present controversies might quickly either be ended or composed by calme, meek, and peaceable meanes, and these alone.
That lately renewed Committee for Accommodation, Oh if it might please the Lord to shine upon it, however I may not stay to see its successe; yet wherever I am, my best wishes shall be poured upon it, especially when I shall heare, as I have great rea∣son to beleeve is only intended, that it abides circumscribed within the bounds of that prudent Order whereby it is renewed.
For first, that Order is so farre from holding out an Accommodation for all the sects of the Land, that it speaks only of the differences that are among the members of the Assembly. Liberty of Conscience, and Toleration of all or any Religion is so prodigious an impiety, that this religious Parliament cannot but abhorre the very nameing of it. Whatever may be the opinion of Io. Goodwin, of Mr Williams and some of their stamp, yet Mr Burrowes in his late Irenicon upon many unanswerable arguments explodes that abomination. Likewise our Brethren who seek to be ac∣commodate, will be willing I hope to professe their going along with us, without any considerable dssent, as in the Directory for all the parts of divine worship, so in the confession of Faith and Catechism.
Secondly, the Order expresses only the differences in Church-government; what other opinions wee have mentioned in the following Treatise, I hope our Brethren will either disavow and passe from them, or else be content to bury them in their owne breasts, till time and better information make them die and vanish without more moyse.
Thirdly, the intent of the Order is to bring up the dissenting Brethren o approve of the Government agreed upon in the Assembly and allowed by both Houses of Par∣liament; or if that cannot be, to see how in some practises they may be forborn. This doth suppose that our Brethren shall not be permitted to print, preach, or publish any thing against the Goverment established by Parliament; also that in the practice of this Government they shall be obliged to joyne so farre with their Brethren as their principles may suffer. This being, I doubt not but in many things they shal be much forborn; for whatever be the unadvised rashnesse of some in their way, yet if they may be pleased, according to their frequent offers (as I remember) to be constant members of our Presbyteries and Synods, and there to give were it but their consul∣tative voyce, I beleeve that few of them shall ever be pressed to much more; for if they agree among themselves, and governe well their owne Congregations, no con∣troversie that concerns them will ever come before any superiour Assembly; and if any complaint of their male administration, or any matter of ordination or excommu∣nication should come from them to be cognosced in a Presbytery or Synod, the result might ever be to them as a matter of advice to be executed in their owne Congrega∣tions by their owne Pastors, if they did finde it right: or if it appeared wrong, the Generall Assembly, or at least the Parliament, would give them so much satisfaction, as on earth can be expected.
Albeit I am in opinion, that no case meerly Ecclesiasticall shall ever need to goe from a Generall Assembly to a Parliament; these two bodies are so friendly and neare of kin, that none who knowes their nature and constitution will ever feare their dis∣cord. I dare say, that all the jealousies which are presented to the Parliament of Eng∣land of a Nationall Assembly, are meere Bugbeares and childish frightments, arising alone out of mis-information and unacquaintance; for both reason and experience will demonstrate that the Parliament of England cannot have on earth so strong pillars and pregnant supporters of all their Priviledges, as free Protestant Assemblies esta∣blished by Law, and kept in their full freedom from the lowest to the highest, from the Congregationall Eldership to the Generall Synod of the Nation. No such Barres as these are imaginable either against Tyranny or Anarchy; they are the mightiest impediments both to the exorbitancy of Monarchs, which has been and is our mi∣sery; and to the extravagancy of the common multitude, attempting to correct and subject all Parliaments to their owne foolish desires, which is like to be the matter of our next exercise and trouble.
Protestant Assemblies examined to the bottom, will be found reall and cordiall friends to all the Iust, Legall and reasonable Prerogatives of a Monarch, to all the equitable and profitable Liberties of the meanest subject; but above all to every due priviledge of a Christian Parliament. Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we grieve to see men afraid out of meere ignorance with that which we know is their great good. I am perswaded that after a little experience, Congregationall Sessions, Clssicall Presbyteries, Provinciall Synods, and Nationall Assemblies will be embraced and sluck to by the Parliament of England as the greatest and most usefull priviledges of their great Charter.
My fourth remarke upon the Order in hand is, that it speakes alone of the questi∣ons of Government, whereby the Assemblie was retarded, but nothing of the consti∣tution of Congregations which never came to any considerable debate, much lesse

did ever retard the Assemblies proceedings: and albeit the words of the Order might be extended beyond the Government to the constitution, yet wee may not thinke that the House doth intend to tolerate the gathering of separate Congregations; in this point we hope that the desired accommodation shall satisfie our Brethren, and all tolerations shall be needlesse. Themselves are witnesses of our most earnest Desires, of our very reall indeavours, (and we wish, they had been much more our helper and reall Assistants) for purging of all Congregations, so far as ever they have been in any time, in any place, for making them so void of ignorance and all scandalls as Scrip∣ture or any reason can require: In these our earnest requests we trust the Parliament at last will shew us favour. But when the Assembly and Parliament have done their uttermost, to have the Churches purified so farre as is possible, if notwithstanding of all that can be done, our Brethren will yet separate, and peremptorily refuse to com∣municate as Members, in the best ruled Congregations, either of England, or of any other reformed Church; wee confesse, that by such a Declaration, our Brethren would put us to a great deale of perplexity; for such a separation as this, were as we conceive, the most palpable and unreasonable Schisme that ever yet was heard of in the Christian World, much contrary to the word of God, and evidently destructive of the necessary peace of all these Churches wherein it should bee tolerated; beside its cleare contradiction in termes, not onely to the Order of the House, but to the solemn League and Covenant of the three Kingdomes. Notwiihstanding wee trust that the grace and mercy of God, shall be so richly powred out upon this revived Committee, as shall enable them to expedit both us and our Brethren from these o∣therwise unextricable Labirynths.
Would to God that our Controversies with them were brought to a happy period, that both they and we, with all our power might concurre to reduce the rest of our poore Brethren, who this day are pitifully intangled in manifold heresies and Er∣rours▪ that so all the childrn of God being delivered from the snares and chaines of darknesse, might make it their great taske and only contention, who should honour most the name of their Father, by the fragrancy of their godly, charitable, humble, chaste, and sober conversation.
Your Lordship is conscious to the first designes of the Noble Patriots of that your Nation, it was never their mind to have trifled so much time in jangling with their Brethren of this Isle, about new and needlesse questions, but expecting a facility of setling truth and Peace within these Sas, their hearts were farther abroad, their thoughts were large for the propagation not of ther owne but of Christs Kingdome, and that not so much in the Light as in the heate and life thereof. They have the more to answer who here and elsewhere have been the unhappy instruments, not only to frustrate these great and gracious enterprises for the Weale-publick of Christen∣dome, but also to bring the undertakers to so low a condition, that they be obliged this day to God alone for any tollerable subsistence and their very being: albeit we are hopefull the Lord is reserving good things for them, who had so much Faith, cha∣rity, and Courage, as to venture all for the cause of God, and their Brethren, the more unkind men have proved unto them; The Lord who hath been witnesse to all their intentions, actions and sufferings, will in his owne time accordingly reward them, and will not let them be ashamed of their first hopes and constant desires, up∣on the which himselfe for a long time did shine so evidently from the Heaven, as ever

upon any enterprise on the Earth. Though now that brightnesse be much ecclipsed, and overclouded, yet we are expecting with passionate desires, and confident hopes, the dissolution of these clouds, and the dispelling of the present darkenesse by the strength of the Beames of his ancient and undeserved kindnesse, towards that now suffering and much distressed Nation.
But insensibly my pen hath runne beyond the bounds of a short Epistle, albeit my experience of your Lordships readinesse to dispence with your friends indiscretion, makes me secure of my pardon. I will detaine your Lordship no longer, I lay downe my Booke at your Lordships feet, to be given to the world by your Lordships hand. If it be received with so much candor and charity by every Reader, as I know it is offered, it may possibly prove serviceable. Thus wishing to your Lord∣ship in these dayes of deepe and dangerous tryalls, and too great defection of many, constancy, and daily increase of affection to all truth, Piety, Iustice, and every Vertue, I remaine,

London, Novemb. 19. 1645.
