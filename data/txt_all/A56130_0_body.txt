IT being the principal Part of my solemn1 Eliz. c. 1. 5 Eliz. c. 1. 3 Ja. c. 4. Oaths to
the KING Your HUSBAND, as his Subject
and Servant, That to my power I shall assist and de∣fend
all Jurisdictions, Priviledges, Preheminences
and Authorities granted or belonging to the IM∣PERIAL
CROWN of this REALM;
I thereupon reputed it no sordid Court-flattery, but a
commendable bounden Duty, to contribute my best assistance, not only to
vindicate and defend the Soveraign Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction of His
MAJESTY and our British, Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman, English
KINGS, against all Usurpations, Encroachments of Popes and Pre∣lates,
in severalThe First, Second, and Third Tomes of an Exact Chronologi∣cal Vindicati∣on, and Histo∣rical Demon∣stration, &c. London 166, 1667, & 1668. Folio Volumes; but likewise to endeavour to restore
to Your ROYAL MAJESTY in this small Tractate, one of the
Antientest, Royalest, Richest Civil Prerogatives, Duties, and casual
Revenues belonging time out of minde in England and Ireland, (by the
Laws, Custom thereof) to the QUEEN-CONSORTS of
ENGLAND, commonly stiled AURUM REGINAE, or
QUEEN-GOLD; which all Your Noble Predecessors have successive∣ly
claimed, if not enjoyed, from the time of our most renownedHere p. 9, 10▪ Queen
HELENA, (Wife to CONSTANTIUS, and Mother to
the famous Christian Emperor CONSTANTINE the Great,

born and proclaimed Emperor in this our Island; the first Christian
QUEEN, EMPRESSE in the World, canonized as a SAINT
for her transcendent Piety, Charity, Munificence to propagate the true
Christian Faith) till this present age.
In which, as some of the richest Veins of this Gold Mine have been
quite cut off from the Crown by12 Car. 2. ch 24 & 27 Car 1. ch. 20. two late Acts of Parliament, abo∣lishing
and taking away the Court of Wards, Wardships, Tenures in
Capite, and Writs to receive the Order of Knighthood, with all Fines
and Oblations arising from them, out of which QUEEN-GOLD
was constantly due, paid in all former ages; so the remaining Branches
thereof are in great danger to be totally, yea finally lost and buried in Obli∣vion,
not only to the grand dishonour, prejudice of Your MAJESTY,
and all succeeding QUEEN-WIVES of this Realm▪ but also to
theSee page 46. Exheredation of the KING and his Successors, (from whom this
Prerogative-Duty originally springs, and to whom all the Arrears of
QUEEN-GOLD accrue afterSee pag 7. 51, to 56. Queens deceases) if not
speedily claimed, revived, recovered by Your MAJESTY for time to
come, though perchance necessary, or convenient to be pretermitted and
remitted for time past.
If these Collections of Records, published in their original Dialects,
to evidence and vindicate Your MAJESTIES undoubted Right to
this just legal Debt, (which I most humbly present to Your Royal Hands,
as a VOLUNTARY OBLATION, and FREEWILL-OFFERING)
shall prove Instrumental to yield any Assistance towards
the recovery of, and re-adorning Your ROYAL CROWN with
this GOLDEN GLOBE, now severed from it; or the enriching
Your Wardrobe with this GOLD FLEECE, or to the advance∣ment
of Your MAJESTIES Honour and Glory, it will be a suffi∣cient
Recompence to,
