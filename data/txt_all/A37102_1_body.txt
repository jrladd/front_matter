Right Honourable,
MAlice and error are the
Epidemical diseases
of our time and land:
so that whoever as a friend to
his Countrey, shall presume
to discover any thing of a

spirit of Love or Truth, is
likely to exasperate not a
few. That, I trust, both the
Author and my self the Sta∣tioner,
have endeavoured to
do, and therefore must ex∣pect
to meet with the hard
censures and Calumnies of
many; yea even of such, of
whom we have no worse
thoughts then that they suf∣fer
themselves to be abused
with popular mistakes, and
unnecessary jealousies con∣cerning
that most Christian
and Illustrious (though now
clouded) Prince, the sub∣ject
of the following Book.
Whose eares (according to
the Ephesians Hieroglyphick

of Calumny) have been ope∣ned
too wide to the malevo∣lent
aspersions of ignorant &
ill-interested persons, and are
therefore prejudiced against
every relation that may re∣present
him to the World as
lovely and desirable. We
know Themistocles had the un∣happy
fate to be rendred o∣dious
to the people by Aristi∣des,
gallant persons both, but
the latter under a mistake.
These we pity rather then be
angry at them; and desire to
cure them of their beloved
distemper by presenting them
with this succinct and faith∣full
History. But yet that I
may not be altogether unpro∣vided

of a shelter, if the storm
of their zealous frenzy should
chance to fall upon me (be∣sides
a recourse to my own
integrity, which Ianus-like
will make me Tanto frontosior,
quanto innocentior) I humbly
crave a room under the sha∣dow
of your wings, where I
question not but to lye safe.
Your honours have taken a
charge upon you, which ob∣liges
you to maintain the pu∣blick
and common good in∣terest
of this Land and City,
where
—Res est publica Caefar,
Et de communi pars quoque nostra bo∣no
est.
Therefore to patronize the

recommendation of his vir∣tues
for imitation, and of his
sufferings for commiseration,
cannot be unworthy your ho∣nours,
which is the humble
desire of
