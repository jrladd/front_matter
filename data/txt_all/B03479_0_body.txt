Madam,
IT may be thought a presumption in me to af∣fix your Name to the ensuing Leaves; I as∣sure you (Madam) it was not their merit but you candour that induced me to make such an at∣tempt, which also created in me a more then or∣dinarie confidence and belief that you would o∣verlook all those defects occasioned by the unskil∣fulness of the Author, with a charitable allow∣ance: you cannot expect from the ensuing dis∣course, that excellency and sublimity the subject requires; it neither suits with my ability nor de∣signe, to send into the world a splendid Peice of Oratory: Truth was what I aimed at, which, though naked, will never shame its Master; and experience hath furnished me with arguments not wholly contemptible in this regard: and these must take place before any acquired accommoda∣tion, where the advancement of truth is the ulti∣mate end: there needs no pompous words to usher in this subject: it carries so much worth and ex∣cellency in the nature of it as is enough to com∣mend it without those triviall accomplishments; if nothing but blandishments should demonstrate the value and esteem we have for truth and ver∣tue,
 they would want their most affectionate ad∣vocates; but Madam, as Clouds and darker colours serve to set off those which are beautiful and glorious, in this sense my poor endeavours may be of some use to your Ladiship, and as a foil set off and commend your more curious no∣tions: many persons of learning and Ingenuity have offered at this subject, but it hath been so generally considered by them, that they have come short of that satisfaction which might justly be expected from so sollid and useful an under∣taking as that of Friendship; neither have I taken upon me the task and exactnesse of a Casuist, in curiously anatomizing even the most hidden and smallest particulars reducible to each head; I have only drawn out the fairest and plainest lines, leaving the more artificial discoveries to them of greater parts and learning, who I hartily in∣treat to lend their assistance to this great affair; if they would from hence conclude a call, to draw this blotted coppy fair, and throughly effect what I would gladly have done, and wish it were not above my reach, I mean (Madam) a solid satis∣faction in so materiall and useful a concern as this is, I should think this adventure no great crime: but I have been too tedious, give me leave to add, that the Author wisheth to your Ladi∣ship in the perfection of it what the work de∣scribes, and am,
Madam,
