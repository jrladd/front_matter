RIGHT WORSHIPFULL,
WHen through sundry and con∣tinued
abuses offered mee by those
whose superstition I have impug∣ned,
I was necessitated to commit
this Treatise to the Presse: After
some deliberation I tooke boldnesse
to Dedicate the same to you, being
encouraged hereunto, partly by reason of your favourable
Affection to my poore Selfe, which I thankfully acknow∣ledge;
partly also and especially because of your knowne
sincere affection to the Truth, and hatred of all superstiti∣ous
Vanities; and also because you are a right Worthy
Member of that Honourable Body of the House of Com∣mons,
whose endeavour is to clense the waters of the San∣ctuary,
from that filth and bitternes, whereby they have

been defiled by too many, that they may run pure and
cleere, to refresh the Soules of Gods People, I meane to
root out those superstitions and innovations, which have
so long pestred the Church, and grieved the well-affected:
amongst which this Ceremony is one, which you have
not long since forbidden by your religious Order, though
contrary to the same, Pride and shame makes the Prea∣chers
of to keepe it up, and such malignant Principles, by
which these men have polluted the Peoples judgements,
makes them still to practise it. This opinion indeed is
very specious, making a shew to the ignorant, of great hu∣militie,
religion, and holines, when indeed it is a Monster
of many heads; there being not many Points of Popery,
that produce more dangerous Conclusions than it doth,
(especially in the sense that some hold it.) The Text which
they pretend for this Ceremony being as contrary to it,
as light is to darknesse.
The Lord blesse you, and the truly vertuous Lady, the
Lady Clerke, your religious Yoke-fellow, and all yours
and hers, with his choicest mercies, and powre out his
especiall blessings upon that Honourable House of Par∣liament,
whereof you are a Member, that you may be
still tendred of him as the Apple of his eye, and continu∣ally
preserved from the Plots and fury of the malignant
partie, to the glory of God, the safetie of Sion, and the
perfect Reformation of this Church and Kingdome,
which all true Israelites desire, and pray for, that future
Generations may praise GOD for you, and call you
blessed.
