THe Egyptians (right hono∣rable) seeing the counterfait of Mercurie figured with his Caduceus in his ryght hande, offered for sacrifice nothing but bay leaues in that they knew such oblations best ted his humor: Such as sought to beautifie the temple of Pallas, set vp for Iewels bookes & shields, for that the goddesse did most patro∣nage learning and souldiers: Hectors delight was martiall discipline, and they presented him with horse & armour, noting by these presidents, how all haue sought in their pre∣sents

to keepe a decorum: hauing by happe chaunced on some parte of Ephues counsell touching the perfection of a souldier, sent from Silexedra his melancholie cell to his friende Philautus new chosen generall of certaine forces, wherein vnder the shadow of a philosophicall combat betweene He∣ctor and Achilles, imitating Tullies orator, Platoes cōmon wealth, and Baldessars cour∣tier, he aymeth at the exquisite portraiture of a perfect martialist, consisting (sayth hee) in three principall pointes; wisedome to gouerne; fortitude to perfourme; liberali∣tie to incourage: I thought good (right honorable) (hauing heard of your noble & vertous resolutions, not onely in lauda∣ble and honorable qualities, generally in∣serted in your Lordships mynde, but espe∣cially in the fauour of warlike indeuours, following the steppes of your honorable father) whose life and actions left an ad∣miration of his Vertues, to present your Lordship wyth this homelie gyfte, vnper∣fect

as the halfe formed counterfaite of A∣pelles: and shadowed with such bad col∣lours, as might I not excuse my boldnesse, in that blinde men are euer most rash, and ho∣norable men euer the most courteous, I should the more grieue at my inconsidered presumption: but two especiall coniectures doe somewhat salue the sorrow of my for∣ward follie: the first, the report of your ap∣prooued courage and valour (in the lowe Countries) shewed in the face of your ene∣mie, maintained with such a magnanimi∣ous resolution, as the foe was faine to con∣fesse Vertue in his aduersarie: the seconde, your Lordships courtesie in acceptaunce of good wil from the meanest: th'one manifes∣ting your desire to be thought an honorable souldier, biddeth mee hope, that as Alexan∣der did vouchsafe of Misons rude & vnpoli∣shed picture of Mars: for that the prince delighted in wars, so your honor will giue a glance at this toy, if not for the workman∣ship, yet for that it treateth of martiall disci∣pline:

the other assures mee, that amongst many other, I shall, though without desert, aste of your Lordships honorable courte∣sie, in vouchsafing such a meane and vnsa∣uorie present, wherewith if I be fauored (as I hope well) my labour hath his reward, and my desire his content: in which assured hope resting, I commit your honor to the almightie.
