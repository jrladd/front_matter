ALexander the Great, passing on a
time by the workeshop of Apelles,
curiouslie surueyed some of his do∣ings:
whose long stay in viewing
them, brought all the people into so
great a good liking of the painters
workemanship, that immediatelie after, they bought vp
all his pictures, what price soeuer he set them at.
And the like good happe, (Right Honorable,) befel
vnto mee latelie, concerning these my Loue Passions,
which then chaunced to Apelles, for his Portraites.
For since the world hath vnderstood, (I know not how)
that your Honor had willinglie voutchsafed the acce∣ptance
of this worke, and at conuenient leisures fauou∣rablie
perused it, being as yet but in written hand, many
haue oftentimes and earnestly called vpon mee, to put it
to the presse, that for their mony they might but see,
what your Lordship with some liking had alreadie peru∣sed.
And therewithall some of them said (either to yeeld

your Honour his due prayse, for soundnes of iudgement;
or to please me, of whome long since they had conceiued
well) that Alexander would like of no lines, but such
as were drawen by the cunning hand, and with the cu∣rious
pensill of Apelles. VVhich I set not downe here to
that end, that I would conferre my Poemes with Apel∣les
Portraites, for worthinesse; albeit I fitlie compare
your Honors person with Alexanders, for excellencie.
But how bold soeuer I haue bene, in turning out this my
pettie poore flocke vpon the open Common of the wide
world, where euerie man may behold their nakednesse, I
humbly make request, that if any storme fall vnlooked
for (by the fault of malicious high foreheads, or the poy∣son
of euill edged tongues) these my little ones maye
shrowde themselues vnder the broad leafed Platane of
your Honours patronage. And thus at this present, I
humbly take my leaue; but first wishing the continuall
encrease of your Lordships honour, with abundance of
true Friends, reconciliation of all Foes, and what good
soeuer tendeth vnto perfect happines.
