HONORABLE,
AND RIGHT
VVORTHY,
The constant
report of your vertuous

life, in the State where∣of
this little Booke entre∣ateth,
hath inuited me to
entitle the same vnto
your Name in particuler,
which was written for
the profit of all in gene∣rall,
who haue a true de∣sire
to imbrace the State
of vowed Chastity, and
yet remaine in the world
among secular persons.
If the subiect seeme
new, or strange to any,
I doubt not, but hauing

attentiuely read, & con∣sidered
the seuerall passa∣ges
therein, they will re∣maine
abundantly satis∣fyed.
For it was no part
of the Authors intention
(who is knowne to be fa∣mous,
both for learning
and piety) thereby to de∣rogate
frō other Stats of
life; but rather, by shew∣ing
the good, & commo∣dity,
which may proceed
by imbracing of this;
those that be more per∣fect

in themselues, might
heerby, be the more ho∣noured,
and reuerenced
of all.
Neither, indeed, is
there any thing at al pro∣posed
in this ensewing
Discourse, which hath
not been practised in the
Primitiue Church, by
persons of both sexes; &
for that cause so much
admired, and extolled by
the auncient Fathers of
those dayes: Howsoeuer

the same may seeme not
to haue beene in some la∣ter
ages, so much in vse,
and therefore thought
now behoofefull to be a∣gain
renewed to our me∣mory,
in these tymes of
so great necessity, for the
spirituall good of soules,
and increase of Chari∣ty,
now halfe extingui∣shed
in the Christian
world.
The profit that may,
& doth redound to such

as desire to practise this
state of vowed Chastity,
remaining in the world,
will neither be small, or
vncertaine, if the same
be imbraced with that
sincerity of hart and ver∣tuous
manner of life as it
ought: wherein I know
your selfe to haue made
good proofe, these many
years, by reaping a plen∣tiful
haruest of the fruits,
and heaping vp a masse
of Treasure, against the

comming of your heauē∣ly
Spouse, to present him
withall, to the vnspea∣keable
comfort and con∣solation
of your soules e∣ternall
Happynes.
To this little Trea∣tise,
I haue adioyned the
WIDDOVVES GLASSE,
the which I humbly in∣treate
you, to present, in
my Name, to your two
most worthy Sisters, who
for the long, constant, &
most exemplar professiō

of that noble, and wor∣thy
state of chast Wid∣dowhood,
may seeme to
clayme a iust Title ther∣unto.
But I deemed not
my labour in translating
it, worthy to be presen∣ted
to so honourable Ma∣trons,
in a Dedicatory a
part: not doubting but
the same wilbe more gra∣teful,
comming through
your handes, who are so
neere a kin vnto them,
both by Nature & Grace;

seeing Virginity, and
Widdowhood, haue euer
been accounted Sisters,
and betroathed to the
same Eternall Spouse
Christ Iesus.
Accept then (Right
worthy Gentlewoman)
these few sheets of paper,
by me translated out of
Latin, as a future earnest
of som better gift, wher∣with
I intend to present
you ere it be long. And
in the meane tyme, a∣mong

the many of your
pious and deuout exerci∣ses,
forget him not, who
will euer remaine
