My LORD,
THough I am unwilling to decline any Service which Your Lordship expects from me, yet when you enjoyn'd me the Prin∣ting of this Sermon, I could not obey Your Command without disputing it. For I con∣sider'd, that in such an Age as this, where an Exemplary Holiness is very rare, I shall be thought guilty of most gross Flattery, in the Character I have given of Your Incomparable Lady, now in Heaven.
But knowing I have so many unexceptiona∣ble Witnesses, to attest every line I have said, especially Your Self, who best understood her

value, and are most sensible of her loss; and being Conscious to my self, that I have spoken no other throughout than the words of Truth, I soon broke through all the discouragements I had, either from the just Censures the World would fix on the meanness of the Discourse, or from the unjust ones it might pass on my Insincerity; and resolv'd, to do all that little Honour I could to her Memory, and to give God the glory of her Example: And I humbly beseech the Divine Goodness, that what I now offer to the Publick may not be wholly unprofi∣table to those who read it; However, I am sure it will not be unacceptable to Your Lordship, or to those who were so happy to know her, which will be satisfaction enough, to
My Good LORD,
Your Lordships most Humble and Faithful Servant
Thomas, Bath and Wells.
