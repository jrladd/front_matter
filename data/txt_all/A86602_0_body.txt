Worthy Sirs,
YOU have here pre∣sented the result of a few melancholy nights spun out in recollecting what the minds Intelli∣gencer had record∣ed from the single eyed Cyclopean cru∣elty and unthought of heat in framing Chariots and hammering out thun∣der-bolts and other engines for Mars. Verily did not Zeal burn within me, as
impatient of concealing such fire-brands, I should not dare thus boldly to scriblle and grate your (now) serene, sedate spirits with such an ignoble pe∣dantick story of Royalty ravished with the disguised wild-fire of Aristocrasie, which heaven only knows how many heads of this Kingdom it might have blown off, had they not (as wanting sufficiencie of the fool to act the knave artificially) being too confi∣dent of effecting their designs, in due time discovered their dark Lan∣thorn.
Honoured Sirs, The noble respect you were wont to manifest towards all industrious atchievements, as also some friends did incite me not to to defer the divulging this (though rude, rustick, incomposed) Table-talk; hath imboldned me to crave for it a shelter under the shadow of your benigne wings from the contagi∣ous breath of heated tongues.
I am far from presuming to deline∣ate
these Monsters, so as to undertake to derive their Pedegree, to fadom their bottomless profundity, or calcu∣late the knaverie, simplicitie, instabi∣lity or independencie either of their lives or actions: but yet I have adven∣tured in Loyalty to my Soveraign, o∣bedience to your selves, respect to my friends, and fidelitie unto all, to present you a true (though not so ar∣tificial) survey of a single plot, which had almost been unwittingly purcha∣sed of the intending usurping Land∣lords, had not their Achitophel-like Counsels been soon defeated, and they soon after confounded in their own de∣vices, for which Divine Providence, and a continuance thereof, is, and I hope ever shall be the daily prayer of him, who devotes himself, to fear God, ho∣nour the King, and unfeignedly to serve you,
