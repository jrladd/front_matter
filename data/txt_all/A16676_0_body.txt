RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
SO rarely is Pallas Shield borne by the Noble, or supported by such whose eminence might reuiue her decaied hopes: as Brittaines Pernassus (on which, neuer were more inhabitants planted, and Homer-like, more vsually expulsed) is growen despicable in her selfe, be∣cause protected by none but her selfe. Hinc ferrea Tempora surgant: wanting their Che∣rishers (those Heroicke Patrons) whose counte∣nance in former times made the Studies of the learned mor pleasant (hauing their Labours by such approbation, seconded.) Yet in these times (my Honourable Lord) wee may finde some Roiall Seedes of pristine Nobility (wherein we

may glory) reserued, as it were, from so great ruines for the preseruation of Learning, and the continuance of all vertuous Studies; amongst which your Noble Selfe, as generally reputed learned, so a profest friend to such as be studious of learning: a charracter which euer held best correspondency with honour, being a fauorite to them who can best define honour: expressing to the life (what proprieties best con∣cord with so exquisite a maister-peece: It is ob∣erued that all the Romane Emperours were sin∣gular in some peculiar Art, Science, or Myste∣ry: And such of the Patricijans as could not de∣riue their natiue descent (with the particular re∣lation of their Ancestours most Noble actions) were thought vnworthy to arrogate any thing to themselues by their vertues. These Romanes were trucly Noble, bearing their owne Annals euer with them, either to caution them of what was to be done, or excite them to prosecte what was by them commendably done: nor knew they honour better limmed, or more ex∣actly proportioned, then when it was beautified by the internall ornaments of the minde. Many I know (my good Lord) whose greatnesse is de▪ riuatiue from their Ancestours vnto them∣selues, but much eclypsed by their owne defects: and Plants which had a Noble Grafter, vse now and then to degenerate. But so apparant is your Lustre, that it borroweth no light but from your selfe; no eminence but from the lampe of your honour, which is euer ready to excite the ver∣tuous

to the vndertaking of labours well meri∣ting of their Countrey, and generally profita∣ble to all estates. In Subiects of this nature (my Honourable Lord) I cannot finde any more ex∣act then these Suruies of istories; many wee haue depraued: and euery Iasciuious Measure now becomes an Historian. No study in his owne nature more deseruing, yet more corrup∣ted none is there: O then if those ancient Ro∣manes (mirrours of true Resolution) kept their Armilustra with such solemnity, feasts celebra∣ted at the surueyes of their weapons: We that enioy thes Halcyons daies of peace and tran∣quillity, haue reason to reserue some time for the solemnizing this peaceble Armour of Hi∣stories; where we may see in what bonds of due∣ty and affection wee are tied to the Almighty, not onely in hauing preserued vs from many ho∣stile incursions, but in his continuing of his loue towards vs, wee cannot well dijudicate of comforts but in relation of discomforts: Nor is peace with so generall acceptance entertained by any, as by them who haue sustained the ex∣tremities of warre. Many precedent experi∣ments haue wee had, and this Ile hath tasted of misery with the greatest, and now reuiued in her selfe, should acknowledge her miraculous pre∣seruation, as not proceeding from her owne po∣wer, but deriued from the supreme influence of heauen, whose power is able to erect, support, demolish, & lay wast as he pleaseth: Hinc Timor, Hinc Amor. Hence wee haue argument of

Feare and Loue. Feare from vs to God, Loue from God to vs: Cause wee haue to feare, that subiect not our vnderstandings to the direct line and square of reason, but in our flourishing estate (imitating that once renowned Sparta) who was—Nunquam minus faelix quam cum felix visa—Abuse those excellent gifts we haue receiued, contemning the meanaces of hea∣uen, and drawing vpon our selues the viols of Gods wrath, heauier diffused, because longer delayed. Wee should recollect our selues, and benefite our vngratefull mindes with these con∣siderations: that our present felicity be not bu∣ried in the ruines of a succeeding calamity. These Histories (my Noble Lord) bee the best representments of these motiues. And in peru∣sing discourses of this nature (next to the Sacred Word of God) we are strangely transported aboue humane apprehension, seeing the admi∣rable foundations of Common-weales plan∣ted (to mans thinking) in the port of security, wonderfully ruinated: Grounding their dissolu∣tion vpon some precedent crying sinne, which laid their honour in the dust, and translated their Empire to some (perchance) more deser∣uing people. Here ciuill warres, the originall causes of the Realmes subuersion: there ambi∣tion bred by too long successe: Here Emulati∣on in vertue, the first erectors of a flourishing Empire: there Parasites, the Scarabe of Ho∣nour, the corrupters of Roiallie disposed affe∣ctions, and the chiefst Enginers of wracke and

confusion, buzzing strange motions in a Prin∣ces eare, occasioning his shame, and their owne ruine. Here States happy, before they raisd themselues to the highest type and distance of happinesse. And generally obserue wee may in our humane Compositions, nothing so firme as to promise to it selfe constancy, so continu∣ate as assure it selfe perpetuity, or vnder the cope of heauen, any thing so solid as not sub∣iect to mutability. This Suruey (my Lord) haue I presumed to Dedicate to your Honour, not for any meriting discourse which it compre∣hends, but for the generality of the Subiect: Your protection will raise it aboue it selfe, and make me proud to haue an Issue so highly Pa∣tronized: it presents it selfe with feare, may it be admitted with Honour: So shall my labours be in all duety to your fauour deuoted, my prayers exhibited, and my selfe confirmed
