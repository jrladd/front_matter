Worthy Sir:
GOodnes knowe's as well how to accept the service of hu∣mility, as to merit it. Your courte∣sies challenge my thanks; and your love my affection. J have here
 taught the World what J should (rather than what J can) per∣forme. Thus J acknowledge the rules of gratitude; and my desire to observe them. Let it be your fa∣vour to entertaine this expression; your glory to countenance it. Ʋp∣on this hope, I have ventured upon a vulgar censure: and what was intended to be stifeled in an how∣er, now prostitutes it selfe to an Age. If the subiect please not the Readers, let them remember, 'tis Scripture: If not the Sermon; J confesse 'tis mine. So all the faults may be favourably corrected, be∣cause freely acknowledged. J that am the Father of this weakenesse, professe my selfe the admirer of better: and shall strive to imitate
 when the severest censurer will set me a copie. To require a Master∣piece of learning and iudgement from the least of the Apostles, is to forget discretion by expecting a mi∣racle. Let the World rest satisfied that (for your sake) this atom is espied in the rayes of our Sunne; and emboldened by your importu∣nities. To you therefore I addresse my selfe, desiring your acceptance both of this, and the Author,
