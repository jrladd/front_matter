Gentlemen,
BEing put upon it to Print this Sermon (as you may see in the Appendix thereof) I began to cast in my mind to find out, according to the custome, some fit Person to whom I might dedicate it: And remembring a curtesie lately done (at my motion) by your Company, I resolved to testifie my respect, and thankfulnesse for that deserving act, by this usuall expression of gratitude. The Society of that fa∣mous and usefull Colledge at Dublin being like to be disolved for want of bread, to the great prejudice of Religion, and griefe of the truly religious; I was entreated by one of the
* The Right Reverend Dr Ʋsher. A. A. prime ornaments of that Society to endeavour to promote some Charitable contribution, for some small support to keepe that Society together till this Nation might be in a circum∣stance to make such provision for it as such a worke did re∣quire; In which good worke while I was acting, I was by a Citizen (a great lover of Learning) directed to make my addresse to the Companies of London, as the likeliest way to get some speedy, and considerable supply: which advice of his I presently began to put in prastice, in procuring the Master of your company (wherein I had most acquaintance and interest)
to move this charitable worke with you, which he did with that successe, that he obtained sudainly a considerable gra∣tuity (the low ebbe of your Company at that time being weigh∣ed) towards it, your Society concluding that it was suteable to them to go before others in the reliefe of a Colledge, ra∣ther than expect others to be precedents to them. To expresse my sence of your worth in this freenesse, and forwardnesse, in so choise an Act of Charity, I have presumed on this Dedica∣tion: And I was yet further incited to this, by the intent of Printing this Sermon, for it is a vindication of my inno∣cency against ungrounded Calumny; and in whose opinion should I rather desire to stand right than in yours? To a con∣siderable part of whom God hath made me Pastor, and Prea∣cher to you all, the peculiar Sermons to your Company being to be Preached by me so long as providence continues my interest in the Church of St. Faiths, where they are to be Preached; And Sermons find acceptance much according to the esteeme of the Preacher, on their acceptance depend their efficacy, and therefore it behoved me, that no sinister conceit of me should by any meanes be bred and rest in your breasts; So hoping that this office of love will neither be strange, nor unwelcome, with my Prayers for you, I take my leave, and remaine
