SIR,
THIS Sermon you were pleas'd to desire a Copy of, and others since commanded me to Print it: I have now gratified both, and run the risque of publick censures, which yet I expect from none but the dissenting and rebelli∣ous Party: and those I as much despise as they do Government. If it be a crime to Preach up Loyalty to God, and the King, in an age wherein there are such numerous and daring Rebels to both; I must confess my self guilty of it: but shall not ask pardon of them, till they beg theirs from God, and repent of this great sin, which (like Witches, to whom they are compared) 'tis doubtful whether they will ever do. However to leave such among us without excuse, this Sermon with some little alterations has already visited other Churches and Counties besides my own, and is now like to visit more; that if possible, the Antidote may be as diffusive as the Poison: yet how to ex∣pel

it quite, whether by making new Laws, or ra∣ther reviving the old, and putting them in a vigorous execution, is humbly submitted to the wisdom of the present Parliament; from whose united Heads, and Hearts, and Hands, we now hope for, and almost promise our selves a perfect Cure. And I am confident you will not be wanting in your Sphere to contribute what you can towards it; you, who stood so firm to the Church, and Crown, amidst those black and dismal storms that formerly clouded, and eclipsed both; and have ever since, even when things ran high again in favour of Rebellion, and once more threatned ruine to our antient English Monar∣chy, and Episcopacy, preserv'd your Integrity, and Loyalty intire: which therefore together with your Charity and Hospitality (Vertues that are natural to your Family) without doubt you will carry with you to your Grave; as those will carry you farther, even to the regions of Bliss and Immortality: where that you may late, and safely arrive, is the hearty Prayer of,
SIR,

From Ʋp-Lime
October 24. 1685.
