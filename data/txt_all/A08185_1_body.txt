THe last, the least, and yet best deed alone
Done to the dead by those that de suruiue,
Is to record their vertues, they being gone:


For only vertue keepes the dead aliue.
My last, my least, and yet my best I can
Of dutie to that honord Ladies name,
Which from her vertues first in me began,


I owe to you, that best can iudge the same.
My subiect (Noble Lords) doth fit your worth,
And since my humble lile is farre too base,
I for the subiects sake doe pick you forth,
That stile and subiect both may purchase grace.


Which if (great Lords) my humble Muse obtaine,
Walthams complaint cannot be told in vaine.
