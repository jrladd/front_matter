Erected at Edinburgh the 26th. of February, 1692.
Gentlemen and Fellow-Sword-Men,
HAving the Honour to be One of Your Society, and being so Fortunate as to be elected at Your first Meeting pre∣cident for that Year, I think I cannot give a greater Testimony of my Gratitude for that Favour, and of the respect I bear to the Society, then by presenting you with this Token, which although I must confess but a very small One; yet if narrowly canvased, will be found to con∣tain in it more of the Judgement of the Sword, than probably (considering its bulk) could have been expected.
It therefore begs your Protection, & with all humility submits to Your impartial Censure: For who can be fitter Judges of the Subject of
this Discourse, than persons who have so gene∣rously engaged themselves to Mantain, Encou∣rage, and Defend the Usefulness of the ART whereof it treateth.
It is true, it treateth chiefly but of the Second Branch; or Part of this Art; for I think the Art of the Small-sword or Rapier may be very justly devided into three Parts, or Kinds of Practice, which are, The Practice of the Les∣sons upon a Master's Breast. The Practice of School-play, or of the same Lessons against a Commerad with Blunts. And the Practice of the Abstract or most secure part of the very same Lessons at Sharps, for a Man's Honour, or Life. Now of the First & Last of these I have writ al∣ready; of the first in my Scots Fencing-Master, & of the Last in the Sword-Mans Vade-mecum: So that to perfite all I can say upon this Art, there only remains that I discourse upon this Second Branch, which is of so much the more use, as it is the only means to make a Man perfect in the Third: For a Scholar may play his Les∣sons very exactly upon a Master, who can nei∣their perform them in Assault nor at Sharps, but it is somewhat rare to find a person dexte∣rous and exact in School play, who cannot per∣form something at Sharps, I do not mean by his natural Courage and Forewardness, but by an artificial Conduct and Practice of his Les∣sons.

And altho there may in Our Honourable Society be some, who know as much, nay, per∣haps more of what belongeth to this, than I can discover to them, and also that it cannot be sup∣posed that any will be admitted into it, who do not in some measure understand how School Play should be performed; yet I may safely say, we are not all of the same Strength and A∣droitness; and however useless this Peice may prove to some, yet there are others who stand mightily in need of it, as well in Our Society, as in other Schools throw the Kingdom: And this in my Opinion can be no more a Reflecti∣on upon us, than it is upon any other Corpo∣ration, that all belonging to it are not alike dexterous and expert in the Trade they profess.
I expect therefore Gentlemen, that You wo'nt be dissatisfied at my recommending this Discourse to Your perusal, seing it was meer∣ly for the Encouragement of the Art, and Im∣provement of the Youth of this Kingdom, whereof You are a part, that I was at first indu∣ced to enter upon this Subject: And seing I may without Vanity say, I have been none of the meanest Instruments in perswading many Gen∣tlemen to apply themselves to it, the good ef∣fects of which I see in the Erection of this Our Society; I rest satisfied as having fully accom∣plished my Design, and contemning the Cen∣sures
of Any, who may Reflect upon me as medling too much with what they judge does so little lye in my way: I think my self aboun∣dantly recompenced (by the Encouragement I see You give the Art) for any small Trouble or Expences I have been at for the benefit of my Countrey-men upon this Subject, of which, if I be not mistaken, I have said all that is neces∣sar, either for the Divertisement, or Defence of a Mans Person.
Continue then, Worthy Gentlemen, Your Noble Design, of Encouraging by this Your Society the Art of the Sword; and as You have cast a generous Coppy to the rest of Brittain, whereby they may know what Method to take for the Improvement of their Youth in so use∣ful an Art; so let Your Practice discover and demonstrate to the World, That as Scotland cometh short of few Kingdoms for producing of Spirits capable of any Art or Science, so she will be behind none in advancing the Noble Art of Defence, and training up of Swordmen both to defend It and their Countrey, when a fit occasion shall offer. In doing which You will not only reap the Advantage and Benefit Your selves, but also be an Honour to Your Nation, which that it may for ever flourish and be Fa∣mous for Sword-men, shall still be the desire and hearty wish of,
GENTLEMEN,
