MOst worthy Sir, Into your hands I give,
The sum of that which makes me be so brief,
I humbly crave acceptance at your hand,
And rests your Servant ever to command.


Since I've begun, I hope to make an end,
And as I can my Shepherd Swains defend,
For Walter Scot of Wall,
These Lines I do design;
For there are many Gallants
That have Shepherds been;
Romes fond Romulus was bred and fed,
'Mongst Shepherds where his youthful days he led.
The Persian Monarch Cyrus he did pass,
His youth with Shepherds, and a Shepherd was,
Wherefore I humbly thee intreat,
If I do call thee Shepherd, not to sret;
For I know ye are all Gentlemen,
To the seventh or eight Generation:
And I will do to you that I'le not do to others,
For I'le describe you both your Fathers and Mothers;
Because erroneous Liars the old Famil; did not ken,
Call'd Harden, this and that said, they're not Gentlemen;

Wherefore I will at William begin,
Brother-german to Walter of Sinton,
Who was a man of great command,
He enjoy'd all Sintons Lordship,
And the Beat-up Land;
He was the son of George
Who did enjoy the same,
So did his Father, his name was Iohn:
George left his second son, it is most clear,
'Twixt four and five thousand merks a year,
Into that Possession at that time,
I know not what Charter and Evidence was then:
Yet to let misbelieving people ken,
These Lands as they ly I will design,
Therefore William was a valiant man,
Who was the first Laird of Hardin:
In his possession he had then no less
Nor Hardin, Totshaw, Mebenlaw, and High-chesters,
With Todrick, which good Sheep afford,
VVester-Essenside, Burn-foot and Sheils-wood,
These were the Lands I do explain,
That George of Sinton gave his son VVilliam,
VVhy should ramping Liars blast his Fame,
And say that he was not a Gentleman;
He wanted nothing of Gentrie,
But only the title of Dignitie:
The first Lady that he did gain,
VVas daughter to the Baron of Chisim,
Then in Hardin place he did sit down,
And on her there begat one onely son;
For within short process of swift time,
She dy'd ere she came to her prime:
The Laird a Widdower did remain,

How long a time, I do not ken;
But his Son he grew up to be a Man,
The first Walter Scot of Hardin:
Then Hardin did to Riddel ride,
The old Laird of Riddel being dead,
In suit of his Relict there came he,
She was a Daughter of Fairnilie;
She was a fair and beauteous Dame;
And at that time she was but young,
Her beauty others did excel,
She had one Daughter to Riddel,
Brave William Scot he did her gain,
They had not long been in that Roum,
While the Ladies, Daughter married the Lairds Son;
Then they left the young Folk in Hardin,
And the oldFolk in Todrick they sat down,
And there they did two Sons beget,
Robert of Burn-foot, and George of Todrick,
And both of them prov'd stout able men,
They were the first Cadents come of Hardin.
Now to the Young Folks I return,
The Laird and Lady of Hardin,
Betwixt them was procreat a Son,
Call'd William Bolt-foot of Hardin;
He did survive to be a Man,
And then to the Fairnilie he came;
And Fairnilies Daughter he did wedd;
For they were related by Kindred:
Betwixt them two was Procreat,
The stout and Valiant Walter Scot.,
Of Hardin, who can never dy,
But live by Fame to the tenth Degree:
He became both able, strong and stout,

Married Philips Daughter, Squire of Dryhope,
Which was an antient Family,
And many broad Lands enjoyed he;
Betwixt these Scots was procreat,
That much renown'd Sir William Scot:
I need not to explain his Name,
Because he ever lives by Fame:
He was a Man of Port and Rank,
He married Sir Gideon Murrays daughter of Elibank;
Betwixt them there was procreat,
This old Sir William that's living yet:
This old Sir William married
A sister of the house of Boyd,
And there's procreat them betwixt,
Sir William Scot, now call'd youngest,
Because his Father does remain,
Therefore he's call'd young Sir William;
And young Sir William married,
The only daughter of Sir Iohn Nisbit;
He late was Advocat to the King,
And now is call'd Lord Dirltoun:
This Genealogie is true,
And the old was as good as the new.
Now worthy Wall, I wish thee Life and Health,
Hoping thou'l ne're marry inferior to thy self,
Yet Ambition, Pomp, and Hell-begotten Pride,
And damn'd adulation thou will still deride;
The Complemental flattery of Kings Courts,
I hope shall ne're be mixt amidst thy sports:
For Homer was the Prime of Poets stil'd,
And worthy Actions still he did compile;
That he did both in Arcadia and Greece;
Extol the Shepherds with Iasons Golden Fleece.
