NOble captain Gene∣rall, will your Ex∣cellency once give leave to, I dare scarce say what; yet, I beg as on my bended knee, for the Spirits sake, leave to shelter these few lines under your greatnesse, hoping you will peruse them in a leasure
houre, not but that your breast hath sweeter things in it, in which ye delight your selfe more, then in all your victories, pomps, glo∣ry, greatnesse, which you are crowned with, and ad∣mired for by all men, good & bad: but the reason why I take this boldnesse, is, to present my thankfulnesse for your unwearied mar∣ches round about this kingdome, in all houres and seasons; I say, for this and your many brave, bold, gallant charges,
where Cannons playd, like thunder; and bullets flew like Haile-stones driven by the winde, such was that at Maid-stone, and divers more besides; but in these Christ did ever keep you with his life-guard of Angels, and now hath brought you home from the fields of deadly slaughter to refresh your greatnesse; now good men will bring presents, or at least, their thankfulnes, as well as bad men, court you for their owne advan∣tage: both the former I
would doe as well as I can, will your Excellency so take it, my thankfulnesse it is, and a present too, like a glasse of Nectar from the Spirits breathings, drinke it up my Lord, for sure it will refresh you; I know you may refuse it, expecting the sonnes of Levi should all bring in their flagons full of rich and choycer liquor; but they are many of them angry, I cannot tell the reason, why good men should be so, unlesse they are weak and froward,
and know not what they would have; but yet I think you value not the ingrati∣tude of men, knowing your reward is with your Lord and Master Christ, the King of kings, who will one day set you in his throne and glory, for you have overcome; you, my Lord Tho. Fairfax have foyld, and spoyld all; yea, all the mighty ones that have risen against us, yea, you, I say, with your gallant Champions, have bravely done the thing once over, and once again to that, and
with such expedition, that the world round doth won∣der, for which wee hope, though many stars or com∣mets like to stars be fallen, yet your honour, glory shall endure like to the sun and moon for ever, & your merits with your Champi∣ons be remembred whilst one good man breaths in the nation; And now, wee who are private christians adde this short title to your Excellency, the Saints Cap∣tain Generall, next under Christ, and when, my Lord,
you need us, wee are all in readines, to pray, to fight, to live & die at your com∣mand, for Christ and this nation, which now sits at rest: but for taxes, some poor, and widdows wants, who are all in hopes, you will speake a word in their behalfe to those, who soon can help them, and surely will ere long, though mur∣muring men say no. Well, my Lord, I say no more, but the great Iehovah, God Almighty blesse you, make his face to shine in, and from you,
& al those who have followd you, high and low, in faithful∣nes and unweariednes: doing Christs, and the nations work; this is my wish to you, and those who are sent over to the other nation, by yours & others commands, to do Christs work, and make him room for his Gospell; and to this I wish O all ye Saints, that love Christ your king, his cause, or these nations, say, Amen, Amen, as with one voice.
