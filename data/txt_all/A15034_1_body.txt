FRiendly Reader, I present thee heere (as I thinke) a profitable, vnpolyshed la∣bour: For, he that is the Troucheman of a Straungers Tongue, may well de∣clare his meaning, but yet shall marre the Grace of his Tale: And, therefore, Themistocles, the noble Captayne and Philosopher of A∣thens, compareth suche forced Speaches, to Tapistrie Hangings rowled vp: which, beyng open, appeare beau∣tifull: and fowlded, reserue their Uertue, but lose their showe: But I expect (somwhat) better euent, then may an Interpreter, that is bownd to a present Reporte: for my Respit, hath ben sufficient to cōsider of Segnior Phy∣loxenus, and his honorable companies vertues: and (least by rash acquitall of their fauours, I should do iniurie, to their reputation) I haue, with well aduised Iudgement, bethought mée, of suche memorable Questions and Deui∣ces, as I heard and sawe presented, in this most noble Italian Gentlemans Pallace, the Christmas tweluemo∣neths past: and aunswerable to my weake capassitie, haue exposed yt same, in such sort, as if thou art not too curious, may delight, and content thée: and if not too carelesse, may directe, and benefit thée: And to satisfie thée, wherin: I giue thée friendly knowledge, that Segnior Philoxenus reuerēt regard of the Quéenes Maiesties high Uertues, is a Pre∣sident for thée: with a dutiful, and vnfained heart, to loue, feare, and obay her Highnesse, from whome, next vnder

God, thou receiuest such swéete blessinges: as through the whole world, her excellencie is renowned, and thy pros∣peritie enuied. By this noble Gentlemans ciuill inter∣tainment of strangers, thou mayste perceyue with what Garland, Courtisie, is principally crowned: By the ciuill behauiours, of Soranso, Dondolo, Bergetto, and other Gentlemen herein named, thou haste a President of gouernment, which will commend thée: and by well re∣garding their spéeches, thou shalt finde a discréete methode of talke, méete for a Gentleman. The lyke benefit, shall Gentlewomen receiue, in Imitating, of Madona Aurelia (Quéene of yt Christmas pleasures) Maria Belochi, Lucia Bella, Franceschina Santa, and the rest of the wel qualited Gentlewomen. Besides, a number of other Morall docu∣mentes, néedefull reprehensions, and witty sayinges, to perfect the commendation, both of a Gentleman, and Gen∣tlewomā. (Courteous Reader) thou haste heare, the hono∣rable institution of Marriage, so perfectly Anatomed, as a verye weake Iudgement, may sée the causes, which make Houshould quarrelles, to resemble Hell. Againe, the mā, which is willing to liue happily, may here learne such directions, and lawes, as will chaunge his priuate house, into a Paradice on earth. If ciuill and Morall pleasures, withall these benefites, may make thée intertaine thys booke and report well of the Aucthor. I assure thée thou shalt be pleased, and I satisfied. But if thou makest thy tongue, enemie to thy owne reputation, thou mayest de∣tract, but not reproche the worke: Iniure, but not hurt the writer, for both will liue, and laugh such Callumnia∣tors to scorne, when either are readie to doe the discrete Reader seruice. Some will (perchaunce more of enuie to heare a stranger commended, then of pittie to bemone my hard fortune, or fowle vsage) say, I haue as iust cause to complaine, of iniuries receiued at Roane, Rome, and Na∣ples, as to commend the vertues and good intertainment, of Signior Philoxenus: But to giue such Suggestioners a

double good example, both of patience and thankefulnesse: I heare protest, that as these iniuries begunne, with my hard fortune, so they ended, no wayes in my discredite: And as I forgeue the causes of my mishaps, so scorne I, to recount them, to receiue amendes, in a little pittie. But, for that they, and all such as vew my Report, may learne of me to bee gratefull for receiued benefites: I make it knowen: That this trauell, is Segnior Philoxe∣nus due: And I still his debter, and so shall remayne du∣ring my life: reseruing a good affection, to bestow on such as receiue his Uertues: and my paynes to profite and cō∣mend them selues. And in my opinion, it is iust they doe so: Wherfore, to giue a disgrace to ceremonies, gentle Reader I ende: as I hope to finde thée mine.
