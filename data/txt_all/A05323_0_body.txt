YOu Noble stockes of Gentry, Plants that higher
Grow, till you unto the Cedars height aspire:
You creame o'th kingdome, either in your wealth,
Wit, learning, valour, or iust lawes lov'd health,
Who, by your worthy breedings, births, and blood,
Are chose for Guarders of your Countries good:
And to that end are here trayn'd up by Fate,
To be the glory of great Brittaines state:
I here present you with the Masquers names
Of your foure Houses, in quick Anagrams,
Led by that then made Knight, who first I place
In these conceits, as Captaine of that grace;
Which each of you deserv'd, and in high merits,
Shew'd Englands Gallantry, and Noble spirits.
Accept my Muse then, which shall make you merry,
Like rich Nepenthe, Nectar, or old Sherry;
And for your grace that way, my best endeavour
By hand, head, heart, shall waite on you for ever:
Let not rash anger then, blame my intent,
To gaine your loves with mirth, I onely meant.
