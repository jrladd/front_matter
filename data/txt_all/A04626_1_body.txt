My very Honourable good Lord:
IT hath pleased God to make your Lordship Heire vnto your most No∣ble Father, and therefore I thinke you haue most right to these Teares, which were shed for him, and your renowned Elder Brother. If I did not know by mine own obseruation, that your Lordship was a diligent Obseruer of all your Fathers Vertues (touching which al∣so, you haue a daily Remembrancer) I would exhort you to behold the shadow of them delienated here, by those which much admired him liuing, and shall neuer cease to honour his Memory, and loue those that doe any Honour vnto him. The Lord increase the Honour of your House, and reioyce ouer you to doe you good, vntill hee haue Crowned you with Immortalitie.
