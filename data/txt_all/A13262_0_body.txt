SIR;
I Was neuer yet so pre∣posterous in my re∣spects, as to value the worth of him I serue, by the title, but the di∣sposition; He is noble to me, that is so in his actions, not his des∣cent; those high-swolne priuiledges of bloud and fortune are (for the most part) tympa∣nies in greatnesse, pricke them, and they proue
 windes of honour, not substances. Had I beene ambitious of a high Patronage, this weake peece I send you might haue worne an honourable inscription, but I haue that with∣in me which chides those insolencies, and tells me that the name of friend sounds better than of Lord, and hee is lesse mine that doth onely countenance me, than he that feeds me; He onely deserues to be a protector of my Labours which hath beene a cherisher of my fortunes; to you then this at once flies for Patronage, and acceptance, desiring you to receiue it as a mo∣nument of his thankfulnesse, who euer deuotes himselfe
