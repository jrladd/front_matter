LEet it not seeme offensiue to your sight,
(Most noble Lord) that here my Muse propines
You, with her youthfull follies, in those lines
Deckt with Inuention of conceits so light?
For the dread sounds (which dastard minds affright)
Of neighing coursers, and of trumphets shrill,
Had bin a Subject fitter for my quill,
T'haue bred vnto thy haught eres delight.
But since my Muse, as yet, did neuer frame,
Her sporting vaine, to sing of Martiall blowes,
(Which Mirror-like, your valorus arme oft showes
Both to your owne, and to your countries fame)
Yet deigne to view, ther loue-sicke verse meane while:
Mars oft-times ioyes to see faire Venus smile.


And if vnto this idle humerous Vaine,
Where Youth and folly shew their skil-lesse Art,
She breed acceptance, she her wits shall straine,
(Ere it be long) a subiect to impart,
That to your noble eares shall seeme more worth:
Till when, accept this her abortiue birth.
