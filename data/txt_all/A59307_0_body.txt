My Lord,
THe Impudence of Scriblers in this Age, has so corrupted the O∣riginal Designe of Dedications, that before I dare tell you, this trifle begs your Lordships Protection, I ought first to Examine on what grounds I make the Attacque; for now every thing that e're saw the Stage, how modest soever it has been there, without daring to shew 'its Face above three Dayes, has yet the Arrogance to thrust it self into the World in Print with a Great Name before it: Where the fawning Scribler shall compendiously say, the factions of Cri∣tiques, the Ill time of the Year, and the worse Acting of the Players, has prejudiced his Play, but he doubts not but his Grace, or his Honour's more impartial Judgment will find that pardonable which the World has so Maliciously Censur'd; that is as much as to say: Sir, You are the only Person at Court whose blind side I dare venture on, not doubting but your good Nature will excuse what all the World (except the Author) has justly condemned. Thus they esteem their Plays, as the Fanaticks do their Religion, the better for suffering Persecution; and to dis∣guise their Shame, and prop their Feeble Writings, they make Dedica∣tions when their Playes are Damn'd, as the Dutch do Bonefires, when their Navies are beaten; be their Success never so bad, they still write themselves Conquerors: And thus a Dedication which was for∣mely a Present to a Person of Quality, is now made a Libel on him, whilst the Poet either supposes his Patron to be so great a Sot, to defend that in Print, which he hist off the Stage: Or else makes himself a grea∣ter,

in aking a Favour from him which he ne're expects to obtain. How∣ever, that which is an abuse to the Patron, is a Complement to the Book∣seller, who whispers the Poet, and tells him, Sir, Your Play had misfor∣tune, and all that— but if you'd but writ a Dedication, or Preface— The Poet takes the hint, picks out a person of Honour, tell him he has a great deal of Wit, gives us an account who writ ense in the last Age, supposing we cannot be Ignorant who writes it in This; Disputes the nature of Verse, Aswers a Cavil or two, Quibles upon the Court, Huffs the Cri∣tiques, and the work's done. 'Tis not to be imagin'd how far a Sheet of this goes to make a Book-seller Rich, and a Poet Famous.
But my Lord, whilst I trouble you with this kind of discourse, I beg you would not think I design to give Rules to the Press, as some of our Tribe have done to the Stage; or that I find fault with their Dedications in Complement to my own: No, that's a trick  do not pretend to. Besides your particular Favours, in the publick Honours you have condescended to grant this Play, and the Author, have heightned my sense of Grati∣tude beyond my Power of expressing it. This Play, which for no other Merit▪  take Sanctuary here, throws it self at your feet, as your own: the Story of which, I owe to your Hands, and your honourable Embassy into Africa: And on that score I present it to your Patronage, as the Jews made their Sacrifices which we read took fire from Heaven: The Incense was lighted by that Divinity to whom it was offer'd; nor is this all I may modestly boast of: For besides it's noble Birth, you gve it a noble Education, when you bred it up amongst Princes, presenting it in a Court-Theatre, and by persons of such Birth and Honour, that they bor∣row'd no Greatness from the Characters they acted. Thus has your Lordship shew'd your self so great a Friend to the Muses; that as in for∣mer ages the Poet made the Patron: When all that's left of a Maecenas, is, that Horace gave him a Name: Your influence on the Contrary makes the Poet, and if this Play Live, or have Success enough to preserve a Name; 'tis by being your Creature, and enjoying your Smiles; which is the highest Ambition of
MY LORD,
