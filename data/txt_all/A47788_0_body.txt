My Lord,
IT is not long since you gave an honourable re∣ception, to the History of St. Pauls Cathedral. Behold here the History (for so it is in truth) of that Cathedrals Liturgy humbly presents it self to you. That addresse, indeed, created This. For Gods House, and his worship being twinns of so indisso∣luble relation, why should their Histories be seperated in their Dedication; and where could they finde a fitter Patron then your self, who inherit, as an Heir-loom of your noble family for many descents, so high a value for any thing whose concernment is Religion. Such is the subject of both these Histories, if I speak not improperly to call them tvvo, which are of so similary argument, that this may rather be said, The Second part of that.
Tis true, this work had not, (as that of my learn∣ed Friend) the honour to result Originally from your Honours immediate command; yet this I can say, that long before I had finisht it I understood you had many

years since recommended the same designe to the en∣deavour of a learned pen; but understanding withal that, for reasons unknown to me, the work was laid a∣side, I proceeded with no small alacrity, being glad I had made choice of an vndertaking which your Lordship honoured with such approbation. More glad shall I be, if in the performance thereof I have administred any thing available to the Publick good, or which may be a valuable consideration for you to own me, as you do, in the quality of
My Lord
