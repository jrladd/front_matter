SIR,
THese Papers lighting in∣to my Hands, and finding something in them, no less remark∣able than different to the general
Practises of the present Age; I could not force my self to ad∣mit of their Concealment, and indeed the greater was my in∣ducement to their Publication. When, Sir, you were brought by the perusal of them fresh to my Memo∣ry, as being owner of all those ex∣cellent Qualifications they so live∣ly represent, and are requisite in Persons to whom things of this nature are Dedicated; These Reasons I soon found too power∣ful to be refused by what I could alledge against giving you this trouble, and skreening this my Friend under your Protection. The greatest fault you'll find in him, was, that he Lov'd; but he Lov'd well, which perswades me, that according to the Character you deservedly bear in the World,
you will find something that so nearly resembles your self, as will make it difficult to distin∣guish the one from the other. He like you has felt that Passion ever produced in a Soul frait with Love and Tenderness, which makes me presume you'll be pleas∣ed to esteem this no improper Address; and really, Sir, not∣withstanding these Perfections, with the addition of sincere Friendship and Generosity, which I never knew him failing in. I should yet despair of his Pardon, for making his Letters publick; had I not presented them to your Pa∣tronage, it having been his great∣est Care and Concernment these many years to keep them from the censorious World, and him∣self in a Retirement, little di∣stant
from being Buried to all his Acquaintance, except when his Quality rendred his publick Ap∣pearance unavoidable; and so fond was he of his own Choice, that he would often protest to me, he found more Content in his little Cell, by Contemplating upon that dear Person to whom these Letters were writ, and her Idea that was always present with him, than Courts or Crowns could give him; In short, nothing was able to draw him from his Fide∣lity, which would bear many things to be said in his Commendation; but I shall forbear all flourishes, either upon his Faith or Constan∣cy in this place; being well assu∣red, you'll find in the following Papers, what will convince you of this, better than any thing I
can possibly say; and withal, how great a Reproach his Constancy is, to the Levity of all Pretenders to Love in our days; which makes me have very little more to add, only that Methridatia, Delia and Asteria, all imply one and the same Person; and accordingly my Friend assum'd the three subse∣quent Names, Callimichus, Po∣lierchus, and Orantes, in order to carry on their Amour with the greater Secresie. If Sir, you take any satisfaction in looking upon the excellent Endowments of his Mind, tho' far short of the great Perfections of your own: I hope you'll be pleased to pardon my Presumption in Dedicating this little Book to you, whose Protection for it is the greatest of my Ambi∣tion, and whose Mercy I will not
despair, of having had a thousand occasions of knowing your Genero∣sity, which extends it self to all People, and more particularly to,
SIR,
