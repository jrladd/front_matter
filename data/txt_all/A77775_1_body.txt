BRethren, Beloved in our Lord Jesus, you have here some part of my labour wherein I have travelled among you, which your frequent de∣sires have now brought forth unto light; but had not your forwardnesse helped it forth, had been as the untimely fruit of a woman which never saw the Sunne. If it finde lesse acceptance in the eyes of others, then you have supposed, I hope that having perswaded to the pub∣lishing of it, you will be content to beare some part of the cen∣sure which shall passe upon it; This censorious age wherein the most compleat worke can scarce passe without the marke of a blacke coale, will hardly suffer such a worke as my weak∣nes can produce, to escape without a sharper censure. I looke not to escape in this kinde. But this advantage I have a∣gainst any that shall oppose, that what hath been herein de∣livered, hath been by you received, with an unanimous ap∣probation and consent, as the truth of God. And knowing some among you to be of a long time trained up in the know∣ledge of the truth, having your mindes exercised, to discerne betwixt good and evill, able to judge of things that differ, if any shall oppose the things herein contained, they shall, in
 so doing, not oppose mee alone, but you all, who by your desire of publishing it, have set to your seale, and given your appro∣bation thereunto. Such as it is I commend it unto you, be∣seeching God, that as you gave testimony unto it when it was delivered to you by lively voyce, so you may now, and for ever, shew forth the fruit of it in your continuall practise, to the furtherance of your eternall peace and consolation in Christ.
