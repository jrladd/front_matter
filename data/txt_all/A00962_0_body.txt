SIr I must aske your patience, and be trew.
This play was neuer liked, vnlesse by few
That brought their iudgements with vm, for of late
First the infection, then the common prate
Of common people, haue such customes got
Either to silence plaies, or like them not.
Vnder the last of which this interlude,
Had falne for euer prest downe by the rude
That like a torrent which the moist south feedes,
Drowne's both before him the ripe corne and weedes:
Had not the sauing sence of better men
Redeem'd it from corruption: (deere Sir then)
Among the better soules, be you the best
In whome, as in a Center I take rest,
And propper being: from whose equall eye
And iudgement, nothing growes but puritie:
(Nor do I flatter) for by all those dead,
Great in the muses, by Apolloes head,
He that ads any thing to you; tis done
Like his that lights a candle to the sunne:
Then be as you were euer, your selfe still
Moued by your iudgement, not by loue, or will
And when I sing againe as who can tell
My next deuotion to that holy well,
Your goodnesse to the muses shall be all,
Able to make a worke Heroyicall.





If from seruile hope or loue,
I may proue
But so happy to be thought for
Such a one whose greatest ease
Is to please
(Worthy sir) I haue all I sought for,
For no ich of greater name,
which some clame
By their verses do I show it
To the world; nor to protest
Tis the best
These are leane faults, in a poet
Nor to make it serue to feed
at my neede
Nor to gaine acquaintance by it
Nor to rauish kinde Atturnies,
in their iournies.
Nor to read it after diet
Fare from me are all these Ames
Fittest frames
To build weakenesse on and pitty
Onely to your selfe, and such
whose true touch
Makes all good; let me seeme witty.





IF the greatest faults may craue
Pardon where contrition is
(Noble Sir) I needes must have
A long one; for a long amisse
If you aske me (how is this)
Vpon my faith Ile tell you frankely,
You loue aboue my meanes to thanke yee.
Yet according to my Talent
As sowre fortune loues to vse me
A poore Shepheard I haue sent,
In home-spun gray for to excuse me.
And may all my hopes refuse me:
But when better comes ashore,
You shall haue better, newer, more.
Til when, like our desperate debters,
Or our three pild sweete protesters
I must please you in bare letters
And so pay my debts; like iesters,
Yet I oft haue seene good feasters,
Onely for to please the pallet,
Leaue great meat and chuse a fallet.
