HOnours Store-house, Vertues Storie,
Fames best Trophie, Natures Glorie.
O may with mosse the Muses floud,
Be ouer growne, damm'd vp with mud:
All their holy Hils polluted,
And their Oracles confuted,
If that they straine not all they may,
Now their best vowes to you to pay;
And hoarse as Rauens may they sing,
Who dare neglect their offering;
Or find a subiect for a Verse,
That any meaner worths rehearse;
You the true Storie are, and all
That's rich, faire, sweet, Maiesticall.
The fullest wonder of our time
For Chronicles, in Prose, or Rime.
And like the Rosie morne doe blesse
Our drooping Land with cheerefulnesse;

Throwing your bountie's euery where
As fresh, and fragrant as the ayre.
The Woodbines, and the Violet
The Season of the Yeare forget:
And to attend your sweetnesse doe
Grow euery where, you tread, or goe.
I, in the Autume of my life,
When guilt, and Iustice were at strife,
Was by your royall breath (strange thing)
Vnwithered, turn'd into my Spring.
Accept this Sacrifice (great Queene)
In which no merit can be seene,
But that your Royall Name doe blesse
My Muse in her vnworthinesse.
And though no lustre crowne my art,
Holy fires inspires my heart.
Obedience, Dutie, Zeale, attend
The faithfull tribute, that I send.


So the Gods accept of still:
Not the off'ring but the will.

Celuy qui plus honor vos vertus & admire vostre Bonte, & Cleâˆ£mence & qui est le plus oblige a vostre Maiestate
