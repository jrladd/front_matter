SIR,
I Acknowledge it a Satisfaction to me, that this
plain SERMON, preached at the late
Assizes, found such a general good Acceptation
both from the Iudges and Gentry, insomuch, that
many of them put you upon obliging me to make it
publick. But it added much to the satisfaction, that
the subject matter of the Discourse was so well ap∣proved
by so great a Body of Honour and Quality,
as then appeared. Nor does it a little tend to the Re∣putation
of that County, that the Magistrates and Gen∣try
thereof allow so well of Discourses of this nature,
shewing hereby their True Affection to the Protestant
Religion, and to Christian Peace and Love, and how
sensible they are of the singular Mercies and Delive∣rances
vouchsafed by God to this Nation, both in
former times, and of late especially.
Sir, You have the honour to be reserved for the
First Sheriff of Hertford-shire, under the Auspicious
Reign of KING WILLIAM and QUEEN
MARY. And it was your Happiness, as well as
your Honour, that you were laid aside from serving
that Office the last Year, after you were pricked and
published in the Gazette, in the List of the High
Sheriffs, as being judged, no doubt, too good an En∣glish
man, and too true a Protestant, to serue the
Turn that was then driving on.
I have, you see, in compliance with your desire,
exposed what I preached to publick view, praying
God it may be of some benefit to you, and all others,
that shall take the pains to read it, for the promoting
of Christian Wisdom and Sobriety; and then I have
my end. I am,
SIR, Your very much obliged
humble Servant,
