MY LORD,
I Most humbly dedicate these plain Discourses to your Lordship; which though unworthy of your notice, I hope, may not be altogether un∣useful to some part of our World, at least not to those of my own Charge, among whom I am chiefly bound (by my best endeavours) to promote Religion and Loyalty.
I know your Lordship favours the Subject; and that you support and adorn it, much more by your great and eminent Example, than ever I can do by Argument or Eloquence: Yet I have reason to conclude, that your singular Goodness and Candor, will easily overlook, or pardon, what your Wisdom cannot patronize.

And because I am well assured, that your Lordship is sufficiently apprehensive of the evil and spreading Effects of some Mens popular Prints, as well as Preachings, I hope you will be pleased to allow of my affectionate opposition, un∣der the conduct of more powerful Reasoners.
It is, I confess, too evident, that the Misactings of the real Papists, and of our counterfeit Protestants, proceed rather from perversness of Will, and frowardness of Tem∣per, than from error of Judgment, or scruple of Consci∣ence: And therefore they seem to need more the Schoolings of the Law, and the Rebukes of Authority, than the Illuminations of the Gospel, and the Warnings of the Scrip∣ture, the Doctrines, Exhortations, Perswasives of our Re∣conciling Ministry: And if they are not already past feeling, and incurably obstinate, are like to profit more under an equal distribution of the Acts of Justice, than a right division of the Word of Truth.
Yet I have still the charity to think, that many of those, who by their fair Colourings, and plausible Pretences, have been drawn into Conventicles, Covenants, and the Society of a very vile Cause, do not err altogether of malicious wickedness, but partly through simplicity of Heart; like some of those who followed Absolom. And therefore though too guilty, yet not incorrigibly so, nor quite past the Cure, at least not the benefit of softer Remedies; and such we are commissioned to administer, meek Restauratives, and rational Confirmations.

But if our Sermons alone will not prevail with such as these, they may happily give edg and success to the Secular Sword, and make even the Law a ministration of Love, as well as of Terror, by teaching them to be subject, not only for Wrath, but for Conscience; and to be Active, as far as honestly they can, before they be Passive in their Obedience; assuring them, that praesumptio est pro Authoritate imponentis, that where they have not a clear and undoubted evidence of the contrary, they may safely con∣clude, that Right and Truth are on the Governor's side.
My Lord,
I publish this Discourse principally for the sake of such Men as these, who have been preached into a dislike of our Civil and Ecclesiastical Polity, and therefore may happily be preached out of it again: Men whose Intentions possibly have not been so bad as their Cause; but their simple Hearts have been beguiled with the good Words and enticing Speeches, of those that promised Liberty and Refor∣mation, while themselves were the Servants of Corrup∣tion, and of a base Interest.
Yet truly, My Lord, I cannot expect any very good Fruit of my own, or of much better Sermons on the same Oc∣casion, even among this sort of Men, if that visible Hand of Providence, which hath of late so signally detected the Hypocrisy of their Party, hath not already opened their Eyes, touched their Hearts, and in a good measure
wrought off their Prejudices, and prepared them for contrary impressions.
But if this Publication, and the Prayers that attend it, obtain not all the good Ends of its Design; yet I shall think it speeds well, if it meets with your Lordships Approbation, or kind Acceptance, as a real, though a very mean Testimony of my grateful sence, of your ample and obliging Bounty, to,
My good Lord,
