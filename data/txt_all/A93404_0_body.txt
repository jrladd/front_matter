SIR,
THE very Heathen could say, That Ingratitude was pla∣gued of their gods. How un∣beseeming it is then for a Christian, that hath tasted of so much kind∣nesse and Christian respect as I have done from you, (unlesse I should prove ingrate∣full) in the time of Jacobs troubles, when it was not my case alone, but the condition
of many hundreds of the Ministry in this Na∣tion to fly to London as that City of Re∣suge, to the which they fled, when it was not safe for them to live at their Pastorall Char∣ges. Whose bounty and kindnesse towards them at that time (as I can speake by experi∣ence) was such, as doth assure me that God hath yet mercy in store for that Citty. Was not your bowels likewise inlarged to me som∣times your unworthy Pastor? Did not you when you heard of my condition in London, send up to have me and my aged Wise come downe to you? Did you not most chearefully supply our wants, and were as Ebed Melech to Jeremy: And as Onesiphorus to Paul, 2 Tim. 1.16. to supply our wants with Foode and Rayment, and Money at our de∣parture. I cannot forget the goodnesse of your nature; but acknowledge especially the power of Gods grace in you, and tell the world of it, whether you will or no: Though I know you looke not after the praise of men. And now since providence hath (since these times of more happy peace) Separated us so far a∣sunder,
let this Fruit of my Ministry in my old age, bee the messenger of my unfained Thankfulnesse unto you, with the rest of my Antient and Christian Friends with you, for their undeserved kindnesse towards us. And if this small peece may but add to the increase of your knowledge, the growth of your Faith, the fitting of your accompt at last; And prove profitable to the Church, I have my desire: And shall remaine
