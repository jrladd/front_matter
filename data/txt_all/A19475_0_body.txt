RIght Honora∣ble: Although mā was made according to the Image of the Trinity, that hee might

attaine vnto the knowledge of the Deity, yet by reason of sinne, which so greatly a∣bounds in this our last, euill, and declining age; it is to be feared, too too many are become so alienated and e∣stranged from God, & haue so accustomed themselues dayly to commit wickednes, that the sinne of the whole world is ready to come to maturity, and to cry vnto the heauens for vengeance against vs. Wherefore that man should search himselfe, that hee might see (as in a looking-glasse) the abhomi∣nable horror, and crying of sin, to the end that it might induce him speedily to re∣turne vnto God by Repen∣tance: I haue therefore im∣boldened

my selfe (although vnknowne) to dedicate these my poore and vnlearned la∣bours vnto your learned View: the which I haue in∣tituled (Andrewes Resoluti∣on) shrowding it vnder your Patronage, from the preiu∣dice of contempt.
Thus, my humble duty remembred, I take my leaue, desiring almighty God that these my labors may breath out such sound and godly doctrine, that they may be∣come a salue to cure & pre∣serue the soules of the Rea∣ders.
