MOst Honorable Lords, and most Worthy
to be honored Knight. Let it not seeme
strang (with all humblenes I beseech it)
that I haue thus presumed to couple you
together in the patronizing of these lines
that are neyther vnbeseeming your great¦nes,
nor vnbefitting your worthines. For to whom doth
more properly belong the patronage of those things, that
(after a certaine manner) doe appertaine to the seruice
of his Maiestie then to those that are well knowne to bee
godly, wise, religious, and that are best affected to the ser∣uice
of his Maiestie?
The matter that I haue taken in hand, (as time and
occasion serueth) requireth to be graced and countenan∣ced,
not onely by those that are great, but likewise by
those that are good, aswell by those that bee godly as by
those that bee in greatest Authority, and howe soeuer it
may bee sayd, it hath past the hands of a silly workman,
yet I am sure the stuffe is good: the which although I haue
not graced and garnished with that gorgious imbrodery,
that is looked after by curious eyes, yet I haue clothed
it with truth and plainenes. I would be glad to arme these
mine indeuours, with better deserts then to present them

vnder the presidents of the widowes mite, or the smal pit∣tance
of water that was offered to Alexander: the exam∣ples
are stale, & too threedbare to bee presented to your
viewe, ouer worne indeede by euery bastard Poet: Let
mee then humbly offer them with a Souldiers faithfull
heart, that is still armed to the proofe to indeuour any
thing that may tend to the glory of God, to the seruice of
my Soueraigne or to the good of this distressed Country
of Irelande, wherein I liue and drawe my breath.
Might it please you nowe but to vouchsafe mee a
fauourable acceptance, I shall number it a∣mongst
your many fauours towardes
mee: And I will still rest my
selfe at your comman∣dementes.
