Madam.
TIs not the Ambition
I have to let the
World know how much
I honour your Virtues,
that emboldens me to
make this present Dedi∣cation;
but to let You see
that I would in some part
correspond with the ma∣ny
obligations, those of
Your Worthy Family,

have thrown upon me,
which lie like so many
burthens upon my Soul,
and make the very Fa∣vours
themselves a Tor∣ment,
whilst I behold my
self to have without me∣rit
received them, and to
bee without Abilities
Rightly to acknowledge
them.
I cannot I must confess
but blush, to bring so poor
and unworthy a Gift to
kisse your Ladiships fair
Hands: But I know your
Generosity will easily
find an excuse for my

boldness, and not coun∣terpoise
my weak Abili∣ties
with your superex∣cellent
Worth and de∣serts.
If not Madam, let me
make this excuse for my
self, That whilest the
poorness of my Fortunes
struggle with the gratifi∣catory
motions of my
Soul; I remain so oppres∣sed
under the weight of
those favours, that seem
to participate Divinity
whilest conferred with∣out
interest, that I should
think my self guilty of

the blackest injustice and
ingratitude, if should not
at least acknowledg those
debts, which I cannot dis∣charge.
This Madam has begot
in me that presumption,
to lay this piece at your
feet, that I might have
opportunity to confess
the infinity of those fa∣vours
I have received, &
to tell both your Lady∣ship
and the whole world
that they are ingraven in
my heart, with an Indeli∣ble
Character.
Let your goodness then

accept of this poor ex∣pression
of my thanks,
which however mean in
it self, please too look up∣on,
as proceeding from a
heart desires to be grate∣full,
and excuse me if I
enter not into a praise of
your Virtues, lest I lessen
them. For certainly no∣thing
can proceed wor∣thy
so noble a Person
from the Pen of
Madam,
