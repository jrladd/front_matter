Right Honorable, &c.
AMongst the many notorious scandalls, which (contrary to the Lawes of God, just Lawes of the Land, solemn oaths and Engagements of this Nation) are commit∣ted in these distracted times, there are al∣most none more common in this Island, then the defacing, disgracing, beating down, and demolishing of sacred pictures, signes, memories, and images of our Saviour, his Saint's, worthy men, and all holy things, the Nurses of Pious Thoughts, the remembrances of vertuous actions, and monuments of heroi∣cal deeds, without any notice thereof taken by the State, to the unspeakable detriment of the Commonwealth; for if you do not permit visible signes, pictures, images, and remem∣brances of piety, vertue, and the Obligati∣ons which men have unto God, and Christ Jesus his only Son, to be exposed to the sen∣ses, the windows of their souls, and yet al∣low of vain, idle and prophane, you shall shut up the door to vertue and gratitude, and let loose the reines to sin and misery,
experience telling us, that what the eye seriously and constantly with affection be∣holdeth, the heart thinketh, and evill thoughts consented unto, corrupt good man∣ners, and corrupt manners have brought forth these present calamities and divisions, which to go about to redresse, will be in vain, unless you permit men to injoy the means: Wherefore not to be wanting in good wishes to my native soyl, I have written this book of sacred pictures, signes and ima∣ges, the Nurses of Pious Thoughts, and out of my affection have dedicated it unto your Honors, unto whom doth belong the cor∣rection of these scandalls, that protected by your Authority, and backed by your power, the sacred objects of piety, vertue, and god∣linesse, may every where appear obvious unto the eyes, not only to the extirpation of vice, reconciliation of dissentions, rooting out of malice, but also to the planting of a true u∣nity, perfect peace, and a sincere charity in the hearts of all the Inhabitants of this Island, to the great glory of God, and pro∣sperity of our Country, which is all the in∣terest, or desires of profit I seek for by these my labours, more then to be esteemed, as by Gods grace I shall ever remain,
