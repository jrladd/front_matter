Reverend Fathers,
THe Publisher of these Col∣lections of this Treatise, knows none so proper to whom he may dedicate it as your selves; for as You are those Vene∣rable Persons that intend the Spi∣ritual Good of this Kingdom, and whose Function doth oblige you to watch for the good of Souls, so he doubts not but any the meanest Pre∣sent will be candidly accepted of, that tends to the promoting of so glorious a design. It hath been the
unhappiness of these Kingdoms ever since the Reformation to meet with brisk oppositions in point of Reli∣gion, not only from professed Ene∣mies, but disguised Friends; and the Churches of England and Ire∣land had no sooner shaken off that Idolatry and Superstition that over∣spread and deformed the face of primitive Apostolical Religion; but like the woman in the Revelati∣ons,Cap. 12. she was persecuted by the Dragon, who raised up all his Arts and Stratagems to devour that child of the Reformation which had cost her so many throws and ago∣nies. The Papists on one hand, and the Puritans on the other, did en∣deavour to sully and bespatter the glory of her Reformation, the one taxing it with Innovation, and the other with Superstition, and too
near an approach to those superstiti∣ous Rites and Ceremonies which she had reformed: what justice there is in either of the accusations, the world is sufficiently sensible of by the many learned Volumes that have defended both her Doctrine and her Discipline, in opposition to them both; and I presume that every unprejudiced Reader will cast the balance on the Churches side, and conclude that there is more of spight and malice than truth in the impu∣tation: For it cannot be imagined that the Churches of England and Ireland should be guilty of Novel∣ties in point of Doctrine, when they did so lowdly tax the Church of Rome with Innovations, and pre∣tended them as one great justifiable ground of their separation from it, and to symbolize with that Church
in superstitious Rites and Ceremo∣nies, is in effect to say, that they were resolved to maintain what they had abjured, and act contrary to all the declarations that they had published to the World in their own defense. But it will appear far∣ther from this discourse, that these objections were suggested to our dis∣senters from the Papists, who have frequently acted and preached in the habits of dissenters, and though they pretend to be more zealous a∣gainst Popery than others, yet they are not ashamed to whet their swords at the forges of the Phili∣stines, and make use of their arts and assistance for the ruine of the Church: I wish they would but seriously reflect upon these things, and consider that by insisting in the paths that the Papists have chalked
them out, they are advancing the interest of Popery, and will in time do their work as succesfully as if they had laid their heads together to subvert the Government both in Church and State: That they may not any more be seduced by such kind of artifices, is not only the design of these Papers, but the hearty Prayers of
