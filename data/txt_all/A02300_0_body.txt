IT IS not
lōg agone
(my verye
synguler
good lord)
that I foūd
you loking
in a lytell
boke called in the Frenche lan∣guage
Mesprise de la court, et
lalouāge de la vie rustique, whi∣che
is to saye in Englishe, the
Dispraise of the Courte, & the

laude of the rustical life. And
when I demaūded of you what
boke it was, after your accu∣stomed
gentlenes, you were cō∣tented
that I should for ye tyme
haue it, and loke on it, and I so
doyng: after that I had in part
ouersene it, I do ensure you I
toke great pleasure therin, and
not without good reason, for∣asmuche
as the matter was not
onely pleasaunt and fruitfull,
but also full in euery where of
olde auncient stories and wyse
saiynges of the noble and no∣table
Philosophers & clerkes.
And at our nexte metyng toge∣ther,
partly at your request I
promised to turne thesame out
of Frenche into our maternall
tong, whiche you right wel ac∣cepted.
And so at conuenient

laysure (as ye may see) I haue
finished thesame, praiyng your
good lordship to take my pore
labor in gre, yt not only in suche
a trifle as this is, but in any
thyng els that I may do you
seruice and pleasure in, ye shal
fynde me as moost bounden, e∣uer
prest and redy aswel for the
great goodnes shewed vnto me
by your moost wise father du∣ryng
his dayes whom I toke
as a special patron: But fur∣ther
hauyng respecte to your
most noble sister, my most good
and gracious lady the Quene,
I thynke me fortunate to em∣ploy
my poore engyn to that yt
to her highnes or to your good
lordship should seme either ac∣ceptable
or agreable. This li∣tle
boke then, lette it come into

light vnder your proteccion.
And in suche wyse that if that
ye thynke I haue erred in the
translacion, not to impute it to
bee so dooen for lacke of good
wyll and louyng heart that I
owe vnto you, but for lacke of
knowlage of the stories, which
I do professe is hard for to vn¦derstand
for one of no greatter
litterature then I professe me
to be. Thus almightie God
sende you well to fare, and to
prospere in honor more & more
to ye cōforte of al your frendes,
and me, that to my power ye
may assuredly nomber me
among that sorte.
