E Except your Highnes well allow
this gift of humble mind,
L Lacke shall my hope the gladsome fruit,
it sought thereby to find.
I If gift with giuers loiall hart
your Maiestie will trie,
Z Zeale more than gift shall triumph then
before your Princelie eie.
A A Persian prince, in gratious part,
tooke water of the well,
B Bicause he sawe the giuers zeale,
the giuers gift excell:
E Euen so my zeale, renowmed Queene,
equiualent is with his,
Th. Though I offense commit, to giue
so slender gift as this.
R Remembring yet your Princelie woont,
of clemencie withall:
E Example such hath boldned me,
vpon my knee to fall.
G Great gifts of gold, and gems of price,
poore Hunnis would present,
I If he them had: in stead whereof
hee praies this may content.
N New yeere, and manie, God you send,
in health with peace to raigne,
A And after when your spirit departs,
with Christ it may remaine.
