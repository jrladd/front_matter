Sir, Madam,
I Take the boldness to present you
with these Narratives, not for
that they are new, or supposing
your selves to be strangers to them:
but as a Testimony of my Gratitude
for those favours I have received from
you: The high Heavens may be seen

in the lowest valleys: So may a large
heart in the least Gift. But truly
though the Gift be worthless, yet so is
not the matter contained in it, which
sets forth such eminent and signal de∣liverances
as no Church or people in
these latter Ages of the world have re∣ceived;
And there must be a recog∣nition
of Gods mercies, or else there
will neither follow estimation, nor re∣tribution:
Hence Micah 6. 5. O my
people (saith God many hundreds of
years after) remember now what
Balack King of Moab consulted, and
what Balaam the Son of Beor an∣swered
him from Shittim unto Gil∣gal,
that ye may know the righte∣ousness
of the Lord. If there be not
such a recognition of former deliver∣ances,
we that should be as Temples
of his praise, shall be as graves of his
benefits. Our souls indeed are too like
filthy Ponds, wherein fish die soon, and
frogs live long: Rotten stuff is re∣membred,
memorable mercies are

forgotten; whereas the soul should be
as an holy Ark; the memory as the pot
of Manna, preserving holy truths and
special mercies; as Aarons Rod, fresh
and flourishing. Oh! let us imitate
that man after Gods own heart! If
the Lord will be Davids Shepherd,
he will dwell in Gods house to all per∣petuity,
Psalm 23. 1, 6. If God deal
bountifully with him, he will sit down
and bethink himself what to render
for all his benefits, Psalm 116. 7, 12.
A Christian counts all that he can do
for God by way of retribution, but a
little of that much he could beteem
him; and thinks nothing more unbe∣seeming
him than to bury the mercies
of God in oblivion. His two mites
of Thankfulness and Obedience he
daily presents, and then cryes out
as that poor Grecian did to the Em∣perour,
If I had a better present
thou shouldest be sure of it.
What then may we judge of those
persons in our daies, who labour to

extenuate, yea annihilate these deli∣verances?
that would have no pub∣lick
commemorations of them, that
study how to invalidate them, and
to blot out the remembrance of them?
To render good for evil is Divine:
Good for good is Humane: Evil for
evil is brutish: But evil for good is
Devillish. Yet alas! how ordinary
an evil is this among us, to abuse
our deliverances to Gods dishonour?
But Do ye thus requite the Lord,
O foolish people, and unwise?
Is not he thy Father? he hath
bought thee, &c. Deut. 32. 6.
Should we not remember that good-turns
aggravate unkindnesses, and
our offences are not a little encrea∣sed
by our obligations? Ingrateful
persons are like the Snake in the
Fable, who said to the Country∣man
when he had shewed it kind∣ness:
Summum praemium pro sum∣mo
beneficio est ingratitudo. In∣gratitude

is the greatest reward of the
greatest benefit.
How many such Snakes have we
amongst us, that return evil for good,
and unkindness for kindness? Is not
this to fight against God, with his
own weapons? as David did against
Goliah: as Jehu did against Jeho∣ram:
and as Benhadad did against
Ahab, with that life that he had
lately given him? For the preventing
whereof (if it may be) are these
things published, being almost worn
out of remembrance more than the
very names of them. Besides, though
they may be found in larger Volumes,
yet are they not so fit for every Fa∣mily:
And as I have presumed
(honourable and beloved) to publish
them under your protection, so I doubt
not but they will find the better en∣tertainment
for the same. My earn∣est
desire and prayer for you is, that
the God of Peace will fill you

with all joy and peace by believe∣ing,
multiplying his Blessings upon
you and yours: And that you would
afford me a room in your Albe among
those that
Sir, Madam,
