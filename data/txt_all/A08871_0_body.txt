RIght vertuous, and fayre Lady, may it please
Your faire, now slubbred eyes, with weeping long,
To take a truce with teares, that whilst you cease
To mourne, with which you do your beauty wrong,
There may be time for me, for to expresse
My losse, which by your losse is comfortlesse,
Some comfort may from hence to you arise,
(If it be comfort not to weepe alone)
Oh giue me leaue to speake, that which mine eyes
Haue writ in teares, with which my heart doth grone
To be deliuered. Loe this child of griefe
Seekes vnto you as Nurse for some reliefe:
Be a dry Nurse to it, let it not draw
From nipples of your eyes one pretious teare,
You need not giue it suck, for it can chaw,
And what it chawes, his stomacke well will beare:
Vphold it not with helping it to mone,
'Tis big enough, and now can goe alone.
This Infant new borne of my moyster braine,
I cloath'd in black, exposing it to view
Of many witnesses, some of their traine
Not well train'd vp, but of the ruder crew
Disroab'd it, robd me, without priuiledge
To touch a holy thing is sacriledge.
No lesse was this, nay more (o foule disgrace)
They did not onely touch, but tooke away
A holy Poeme from a holy place
Vpon a birth, and on a buriall day
A mourning, weeping birth day to my vearse,
A day of buriall to Horatios hearse.
Hence you prophane, what had you there to doo?
Lady my babe was on your alter plac'd,
Sacred, deuote, and consecrate to you
By your eyes gracious aspect to be grac'd,
They were Church robbers who did dare to spoyle
The holy labors of an others toyle:
After long search and much enquiry made,
The lost child by his mother found againe,
Who trauailing a new on childbed laide,
Seekes vnto you as Nurse to ease her paine,
After your cloudes of griefe be ouer blowne,
Desires you to adopt him for your owne:
His father would be yours, (for yours he was)
Whilst he belongd to your deceased mate
No patron of his poems now he has,
And therefore doth them to you dedicate:
Loue them for his sake, from whose sorrowed death
Halfe dead for sorrow, they haue borrowed breath.
