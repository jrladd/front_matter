This considered; hearing (madam) of the passions your Ladiship hath vttered a late for the losse of your husband, a Knight in life worshipfull, vertuous, and full of honourable thoughts; discouering by such passionate sorowes the patterne of a louing and vertuous wife, whose ioyes liued in hir husbands weale, and ended with his life, I thought it my dutie to write this pastorall historie, conteyning the manifolde iniuries of fortune, that both your Ladiship might see her inconstant follies, and beare hir frownes with more patience, and when your dumpes were most deepe, then to looke on this little treatise for recreation: wherein there be as well humors to delight, as discourses to aduise.

In which hope re∣sting, I commit your Ladiship to the Almightie.
