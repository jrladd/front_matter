MOst dread Soueraigne;
So many are the temporall bles∣sings, which Alltie. God hath bestow∣ed vpon your Royall Maiestie, that scarcely can they be paralelled in any other: A Monarke of three Kingdomes, all fortefied with the Ocean sea; a Queene wyse, vertuous, beutifull, and fruitefull; subiects without number, all in peace, and plentie, stry∣uing how to expresse their loues and obedience to so worthie a soueraigne; health of Body, and dispo∣sition of mynd fitt for any heroicall action: so that not knowing what to wish, or how to adde any mo∣re
 vnto your present temporall estate, and happi∣nesse, as much as in me lyeth I desyre with all my heart, that these your temporall blessings, may also be seconded with spirituall, & eternall. And for this cause, and to this end hauing occasion to wryte of a Medecine against mortalitie, of a Receipt against all di∣seases, corruption and death; of a Soueraigne Balme, which whosoeuer will vse worthely, shall liue eter∣nally: I could not but dedicate, these my labours vnto your Maiestie vnto whom aboue all men liuing I wish compleat felicitie; that protected by your royall fauour, this Cordiall may worke the ef∣fect I desire, which is euerlasting happines to your selfe, & subiects. And so imploring your royall cle∣mencie with most humble respects, and profound submission I cast my selfe and labours vnder the shadow of your gratious protection, euer to remaine,
