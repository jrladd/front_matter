THe kindnes whyche, I haue founde at youre frendly handes, ioynte wyth your knowledge and loue of good let∣ters, hath moued me to dedicate these my laboures, vnto youre mastershyp: whiche I haue attempted to put in prynt, rather to shew what I wyshe to bee doen, than what I can doe. The argumente is not onely plesante but also necessarye, and that for all kyndes of men to be skyl∣led in. And that ryghte wel knew the auncyente Phy∣losophers, whiche would receyue no Skolers nor bye any scruaūtes, whose shape answered not their know∣ledge in thys science. But what nede I declare thys vnto you, who know it already muche better than my selfe: wherfore no lenger to trouble you wyth my rude letters, I hartely beseche you to take in good part my good wyll, and wyth your authoritie to protecte my doynges. Thus I pray god to kepe you.
