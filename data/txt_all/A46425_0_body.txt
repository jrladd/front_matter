My Lord,
THE high Station Your Lord∣ships Vertues have placd You in, have signally marked You out for Addresses and Dedications, (a troublesome Persecution that must always attend the Great and Fortu∣nate) and possess me (among the Crowd) with assurance enough to think, that being warranted by ancient Custom, I may e'en venture to play
the bold Britain, and pin a Dedi∣cation upon Your Lordship. Since no teeming Heroick Muse, though (after hard Labour) it produce but a Mouse; Or Puny Scribler, that makes a shift to grunt out a Souterkin of a Farce or Novel, but strait some Noble Person must be pickt out, and an Illustrious Name prefixt: So that the Pillars of the Nation, like those of the Exchange, are daily hung round with Advertisements of [Outward and Homeward bound, &c.] by every Skipper that hoists Sail for Parnassus, though but in a Dogger or Cock-boat. And truly, though so poor a Trifle is altogether unworthy of your Lord∣ships Acceptance, or Patronage, yet that must not bar our Plea to your Protection: For by a certain sort of Right, which we Scriblers, with the rest of the Liberty and Property Men,
call Prescription, Your Lordship is as liable to suffer in this kind, as the Gravest and most Gouty Judge is ob∣liged to hobble the Measures about the Temple fire.
'Tis under this claim I presume to give your Lordship this trouble, espe∣cially in this Censorious and Captious Age, when the undoubted Worth of the Patron is absolutely necessary to give it an Authentick Pass-port in the World, where not only the Book, but the Author's Principles and Pra∣ctice must fall under the Censure of the severest Observators. And there∣fore I could not beg Protection under a more secure and glorious Umbrage than Your Lordship: A Person whose unshaken Loyalty has been so eminent∣ly signal, and whose Courage and Conduct both by Sea and Land, have been so highly Serviceable to His Ma∣jesty,
and the Defence and Honour of our Nation. So that Your Lord∣ships many accumulated Preferments are but the Meede of that rising Ver∣tue, which was ever the Darling of your ROYAL MASTER; who besides being worthily stiled the GREATEST, has gained the high Attribute of being the JUSTEST of Princes. But one yet farther En∣couragement to Dedicate this slight Essay, upon so fam'd an Author as Ju∣venal, more particularly to Your Lord∣ship, is, That I tender it into His hands who is so able to judge of the Ori∣ginal.
But now having laid so inconsidera∣ble an Offering at Your Lordships Feet, though I must own my self that puny Brother of the Quill, as not to be Rich enough to adorn your Tri∣umphs with Flowers, and Garlands,
however my Zeal and Veneration for Your Lordship is no less, though I strow your way but with Rushes and Daisies: which at present is the highest Tribute can be rendred You by,
