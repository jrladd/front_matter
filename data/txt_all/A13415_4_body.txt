MOst mighty, gracious, mercifull, and glorious God, that triest the
heart, and searchest the reines, from whom no secret is hid; in
the assurance of thy neuer-failing clemency, and hope of thy gracious
acceptance, I humbly offer to thy most dread Maiestie, these my poore
labours, which out of thine owne Word, and by and through thy bles∣sed
assistance, I haue (for the glory of thy great Name compiled) I ac∣knowledge
my selfe the meanest of men, and the most vnworthy of thy
vnworthy seruants, to present my polluted & imperfect duty to thee, that art the Foun∣taine
of perfection, purity and holinesse; but thou that knowest mine intentions meeke
and humble, free from the expectation of worldly applause, and onely ayming to repre∣hend
and reforme the too much, too frequent impieties of Cursing and Swearing, so hate∣full
to thee, and so abusiue to thy Law, vpon the knees of my heart I prostrate my selfe
before the feete of thy Mercy seate, beseeching thee for thy Names sake (too much pro∣phaned)
for thy Glories sake, too much abused, for thy Sonnes sake, who with thy selfe
art neglected, contemned and reuiled, that thou wilt be pleased to arise, O Lord, and
scatter thine enemies; that though this worke of mine bee but weake, and I the worke∣man
far weaker, yet through my frailty be thou pleased to shew thy power; let my lines
be like Shamgars Goad, Iudges, 3 31. Like Iaels Nayle, Iudges 4.21. Or che Iawe-bone
which Samson fought withall, Iudges 15. Or Dauids Sling, 1. Sam. 17. That (through
thy might) these accursed Philistines, with vncircumcised hearts, may be either amen∣ded
or confounded; That all the reuiling Rabshakehs may be made to know, that thou art
icalous of thy glory: so blesse, I beseech thee, these my labours, that children reading
them, may be seasoned with a feare and reuerence of thy Maiestic: that those who al∣ready
doe hate Cursing and Swearing, may hereby be the more confirmed in that godly
hatred: That the wretched carelesse blasphemers and accursed takers of thy Name in
vaine, may be ashamed & reformed, that thereby thou maist be glorified, thy Church cō∣forted
and edified, and our sinfull liues amended, and finally our soules euerlastingly sa∣ued,
through thy meere and infinite mercy, and our blessed Sauiours boundlesse merits:
To whom (with thee and the holy Ghost) be all praise, power and glory, now and for euer.
