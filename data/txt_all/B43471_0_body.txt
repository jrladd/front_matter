My LORD,
I Have observed in a crowd, a little bit of a man (following his Honourable Master) to shift better then many robust and bustling per∣sons. Excuse me, my Lord, if (out of an innocent sel∣fishness) upon a like con∣sideration, I make bold with your Lordships Name (placing it before) that this little Dwarf that fol∣lows
after, might not alto∣gether be rendred useless. Talk much, and erre much, saith the Spaniard. That being too often found a Truth, by patronizing this small Essay your Lordship will not have much to an∣swer for; nor I my self, if your Lordship will be pleased to pardon the pre∣sumption of,
My Lord, 

Jan. 31. 166.
