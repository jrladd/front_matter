Most High and mightie Prince,
THis Treatise was published seven yeares agoe, and Prin∣ted in the Low-Countries; not long after the death of that noble Prince Henry my master: And for that, and some other reasons, Dedicated to those high and ho∣nourable personages; as by the Epistle following may appeare. The same reasons have moued me to revise it, and publish it a new, vnder the Protection also of your Maiestie and Royall Issue; that most hopefull yong Prince; cujus ego etiam nomine ipso recreor, in whom the name of Prince Henry is now revived again to Gods Glory; So likewise the name of Queene Elizabeth, by your Majesties most happy inauguration King of Bohemia: which two names are yet pretious, and ever will be in the hearts of the English Nation, and other Nations likewise. The other reason, for that the Iewes also (whom this argument chiefly concerneth) many of them remaine in your Maiesties Dominions: whereof in time your Maie∣stie, or Royall Issue (as may be hoped) raised vp of God for that very purpose, may be a happy instrument; as of the finall desolation of that Mysterie of Iniquitie Babylon: so consequently of the finishing of that Mysterie of Godlinesse; even the conversion of the Iewish Nation, the very period of all Prophecies. And then (as Iohn con∣cludeth his Revelation) come Lord Iesu. He which testifieth these things saith, surely, I come quickly, Amen. Even so come Lord Iesu. Amen, Amen.
