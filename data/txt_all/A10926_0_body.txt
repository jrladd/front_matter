Right Honorable Lord;
MAy it please you
to take in good
worth this my
bold attempt, in
that vpon so little know∣ledge
and far lesse deserts,
I haue aduentured so far,
as to grace these my weake
labours with your Noble
name.
Besides some personall

and particular respects
which I here let passe; I
haue had some generall in∣ducements
hereunto; and
this aboue the rest, Your
Honours loue vnto the
Truth, and great regard of
the Ministerie thereof;
which your more than or∣dinarie
paines taking to
heare holy Instructions,
together with the great re∣spect
your Honour giues
to such as bring glad ti∣dings
of peace (whose feet
(and much more their
face) are esteemed by you
as beautifull) are sufficient
arguments to euince.Rom. 10. 15. By
which and other fruits of
pietie you still merit re∣nowne
to your Noble
Name, and are zealously
honoured of al that know
you and loue goodnesse.
into which number (I
hopefully presuming) haue
thrust my selfe, as being
loth to bee hindmost in
that acknowledgement
which is so nobly deser∣ued,
and ioyfully rendered
of all; desiring (as far as in

me lieth) to make knowne
vnto the world that grace
which lies lodged in your
noble brest, which being
vnited to your great∣nesse,
maketh so happie
a composition, as that
they who had no more
than Natures light, estee∣med
it only for trueNobilitas sola est at{que} unica vir∣tus. Iuven. No∣bilitie.
For whereas great∣nesse
makes some men
scornefull and imperi∣ous:
yet whatNec quic∣quam in te mutavit ser∣tunae ampli∣tudo nisi ut prodesse tan∣tundem pos∣ses & velles Plin. epist. ad Vespas. Plinius re∣ports
of Vespasian, may
be truly said of you; It
hath changed nothing in
you but this, that your
power to doe good should
bee answerable to your
will.
Yea, it may be iustly
thought, that your Ho∣nour
would teach men to
take the measure of your
greatnesse, by your good∣nesse;
of so euen a length
and equall pace are they.
And indeed so it must be,
for should Honour out∣runne
Honestie, it would
hardly bee ouertaken.

But I must remember
to whom I speake, euen to
such a one as careth not
for long salutations in the
Markets: I haue done
when I haue once againe
craued pardon for my
boldnesse, and humbly
requested at your Ho∣nours
hands (whose
goodnesse hath not wont
to magnifie it selfe more
in giuing, than in recei∣uing
such like holy pre∣sents)
acceptation and
countenance to what is
here offered by a thank∣full
heart.
As for the Matter here∣in
handled, I will not
feare to say it deserues
it: And for the Manner
I must say it needs it;
whatsoeuer it bee, bee it
not as it should be, yet my
will wisheth it to be well;
but as it is
I humbly betake it to you Hounours fauourable pro∣tection:
and so your Hounour to the protection
of the Highest.
