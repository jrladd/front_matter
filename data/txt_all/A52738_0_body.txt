Honoured Sir,
TO whom should I dedicate this Relation, but to your self, who ear one of the greatest parts in it; This, besides those many Obligations I have re∣ceived from you, hath emboldned me to lay this Book at your Feet. Many, 'tis like, of the Credulous World will cen∣sure me for relating a meer Fiction; But if they are so hard of belief as to mistrust the truth of your having been in Hell allready, they are not certainly so damnably sottish, but that they think the Devil will have you in a short time, and then this may pass for a Propecy. That our dear Friend HERACLITUS is gone, alas! it is too true; and you and he having liv'd the same lives, and acted alike, by most men you are doom'd to the same destiny. You have writ∣ten many tedious Observaters for the publick good, and I ite this Relation for the same end. Ah! how will it revive the Cockles of the Hearts of our Tory Friends to hear the Devil and you keep such Correspondence; ah! say they, now our cause must needs Flourish when our two▪

great Polliticians agree so well. But I care not what the men of the World say of my Relation, let it pass for a meer Romance if they please, let it be the Continuation of Quevedo's Visions, which (you know) you Tran∣slated out of a Language you understood never a word of, and then why may not I compleat it with a Relation I ne∣ver heard nor saw any thing of. And to conclude, I assure you, if ever you take another Ramble it shall be Faithfully Related by
