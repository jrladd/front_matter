SIR,
YOVR HIGH∣NES is no lesse Happy to bee the SONNE of so great a KING, then to be the Heire apparent of so many Kingdomes. In
 the one, rare endowments of Maiesty and Magna∣nimity, are Yours by ge∣neration: In the other, a Royall Monarchy by inheritance and succes∣sion. The one doth fit You for the other, and Your Royall FATHERS footsteps for them both. In those are Peerelesse prints: You cannot cast Your Eie, but they are present to You, and repre∣sented in You. You see in HIS Religion, Piety:
 in HIS Sacred Person, Tranquility: in HIS Gouernment, Policy. In euery one of these, all these: and all in You. In that last, HIS Maiesty hath carried a quick Eie, ouer the Commerce of this Kingdome: because it hath relation both to the Reuenue of the Crowne, and the Com∣mon-wealth of all HIS Kingdomes. It is said in Ezechiels Vision, that One wheele ran within
 the other, which hath an Emphasis in that tongue,  and surely matters of STATE and of TRADE, are involued and wrapt vp together. Which latter, because it is at this time in agitation, and there are, notwithout cause, ma∣ny Quaere's about the Causes of the generall de∣cay thereof; hath caused me to put my selfe on this Enquiry, to philosophize if I could, in these Causes and Remedies. Not
 that I would seeme with Phormio, to reade a Le∣cture to Hannibal: No, I haue only mustered and marshalled these men in∣to their Rancks and Or∣der; it is Yours to Com∣mand them. Great Phi∣lip of Macedon, suffered a meane musition to say vn∣to him, Absit, vt haec tu me melius scias. But for my part, I dare not in any thing, put such an absit, to a PRINCE so absolute. Euery thing mooues it selfe
 to its Center. These little lucubrations present them∣selues to your HIGHNES, as vnto their proper Orb. For as they looke vp to the KING, or as they looke downe to the Kingdome; In both they looke on YOV, with a double aspect. YOV are the Ioy of the KING, the Hope of all these Kingdomes. The Only Sonne YOV are, of the Only KING: An hap∣pyEx  prospexit, pro∣uidit, quasi portò-vidit. SEER, of a blessed SIRE: A Princely
 CONSVL, of the Priuy Councel: A watchman, A worthy, of DAVID and of IACOB.
These Meditations of mine, are very meane: an vnfit obiect for a Princes sight: vnlesse as YOV are a God on Earth; in this also YOV represent the GOD of Heauen; to ac∣cept in your Princely par∣don and patience, . The Cause is great, your Wisedom's deep, and my Lord the KING
 is as an Angell of GOD. YOV are HIS, HE isNot , but  and  too. CHRIST, and CHRIST is GODS.
Oh GOD, be thou still the KING and CHRIST, of this CHRIST Our KING: Euangelize vnto this Angel: double the Spirit of Our ELIAH, on Our ELISHA: that HE may flourish like our Palme Tree, and grow vp like our Cedar ofLibanon per Litterarum Metathesm, Albion. Albion. Giue thy Iudgements to the KING, and thy Iustice
 to the KINGS SONNE: And let all the People offer these sweete Odours to Thee the God of Hea∣uen, and pray for the life of the KING and HIS SONNE.

From my House at Hackney on Whatson Eue,
the 8 of Iune In the yeare of Grace, M.DC.XXII. And of the KING of Peace, XX.LV.
