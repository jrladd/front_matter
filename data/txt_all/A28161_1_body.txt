GOod Sir,
Your noble favours to me shown
When poor, and wrong'd by the malevolent:
And since that I my Ministry lay down,
Ungrateful were I, should I not resent.
And oh, that I were able to express,
Your living vertues, in a lively dress!



A poor man in the hollow of his hand
Brought water to the Mycenean King;
So I, who have but little at command,
To you this slender Thank-oblation bring,
In hope it may the like acceptance find
From you, sith given with a Noble mind.



Poesie is divine, 'tis not of man,
It's God that taught me Poems to compose;
And he may write in Verse, who seldom can
Have opportunities to preach in Prose.
Sir, take his mite, the height of whose endeavor,
Is to be humbly yours, and that forever.

From my study at Abergaveny Jan. 1. 1666.
