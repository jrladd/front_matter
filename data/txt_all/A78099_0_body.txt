MADAME
I hauing had à good part of my education with your vertuous Grand mother of happie memorie, à myrrour of Charitie and Christian pietie; and with your truely noble Father, one of that blest
 number mentioned by the Royall ProphetPsal. 127. fearing our Lord, and walking in his waies; who though be inherited large and well gotten possessions, might well be saied to haue eaten the labours of his hands, he hauing managed and improued them with singular prudence, & dispenced them to the admiration of all that knew him: to whome our Lord made good his promise, bestowing vpon him à loyall pleasing consort, enriched with all dowries of nature & grace▪ rendring her like to à fruitfull vine by blessing her with à numerous, honourable, and hopefull issue like to soe manie Oliue branches circuiting his table, And being by the speciall mercie of God and their furtherance conducted to à peacefull harbour, where I found commo∣dious leasure to reflect vpon the perillous waies I had formerly fieered, to praise God for his ineffable goodnesse, and consider how I might disengage myselfe in some small measure to them and the residue of my well experinced friends, at least shew my willingnesse not to be vngratefull, And hauing long since learnt, that we are not borne to our selues, but that our Parents friends and countrey▪ lay iust claime vnto vs: yet wanting meanes equall with my dsires to dischardge this threefold obligation
 I at length made choise to compose this worke in honour of the most B. Virgin Mother of God (whose Dowrie this our now distracted coūtrey was sometymes not vndeseruedly stiled, both in respect of the peculiar deuotion our reli∣gious Predecessors aboue other nations of the Christian world bore towards her, and her reciprocall procuring by her powerful inter∣cession innumerable select fauours for them) and with all humble instance to beseech that immatulate benigne Mother of mercie (who aboue all pure creatures hath euer freest accesse to the infinite treasures of our deare Sauiour and her beloued sonne Christ Iesus, and can best dispence them to his liking) to impart to each of these my creditors, in my behalfe their due proportion: they all (or the most sincere part of them) ioyntly meeting in spirit at her throne of glorie by their deuout recitall of her little office.
In this my worke (if I may call it myne) I haue indeauored (to my small Myte) to emu∣late those glorious lights of Gods holy Church S. Gregory Nazianzen and S. Basile in this one poynt that is recorded of them, vdzt, That they interpreted the holy Scriptures not accor∣ding to theit owne talent of witt and learning
 (which yet was highly eminent) but according to the Rule and authoritie of their ancients. So that if each holie writer should demand of mee his owne, I might vaunt as vainely as Aesops Bird; the Sentences being theirs, I hauing onely contributed the collection, fashioning, trās∣lation, & placing as I conceaued might probably delight with profitt. Wherein I bestowed such houres as conuentuall Acts, obedience, and fre∣quenting schooles left to my free disposall.
This small portion then (which I hauing now obtained leaue to publish, may in some sort though not absolutely call myne) was by mee as farre as I well might some twelue yeares past designed to haue been dedicated to that Saintlike Ladie my approued friend and your deare Mother: But she hauing fought à good combate, consummated her happie course, con∣serued her faith, and being about two yeares since called by the celestiall spouse to receiue à Crowne of glorie for her reposed; amongest her Nine exquisite Daughters, who with he∣roicall pietie render themselues genuine brāches of that specious Vine, mutually representing each the other, and labouring to adorne their pure soules with all solide vertues, that they may one day happily be transferred hence to the com∣pleating
 as farre as their number extends those Nine Quires of B. Spiritts, I haue deseruedly elected your La: to Patrorage these my n∣polisht lines: you being by preminence of birth the prime branch and one of that mysterious number who if I may not to preuent  and for ciuilitie sake say doth best▪ yet I may securely say doth exceeding fitly personate to the very life that reall friend of myne.
Be pleased then to accept of this meane ex∣pression of my gratefull affection, it being yours thus already of right and the ambitious de∣sire of▪
MADAME
