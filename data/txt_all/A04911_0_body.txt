IT may of some, and not without iust cause (most gratious and dread Soueraigne) be imputed vnto me for no small presumption, to present vnto your royall Maiestie (a prince of so great learning and iudgement) these homely fruits of mine endeuours and paines taken in the Generall Historie of the Turks, and strange successe of their great and migh∣tie Othoman Empire. Whereunto for all that I was the rather induced, not only by the rare and wonderfull clemencie ioyned vnto many other the great and most resplendent vertues of your heroicall mind; the least whereof, is sufficient to haue cheared vp my weake and feeble spirits; but also by the encouragement of the right Worshipfull my most especiall friend Sir Peter Manwood knight, the first moouer of me to take this great Worke in hand, and my continuall and onely comfort and helper therein. Which to doe, I was also the more desirous, seeing diuers little volumes and small parts of the Historie presented vnto the greatest Princes: as the little Treatise of Pau. Iouius, de Rebus Turcicis, dedi∣cated vnto the great and mightie Emperour Charles the fift: and the small Historie of Coelius Secundus, de Bello Melitensi, vnto her late sacred Maiestie, of most happie and blessed memorie, the rare Phoenix of her sex, who now resteth in glorie: with diuers others of like sort, by the learned authors thereof still commended some to one great prince of their times, some to others: all filling me vvith good hope, that this whole and continuat Historie of that Northerne and warlike Nation (vvhich in short time by God his appointment hath brought such fatall mutations vpon a great part of the world as former times haue sildome or neuer seene) drawne euen from the first beginning thereof, and continued vnto this present yeare (not together to my know∣ledge by any one before written) should with your most noble Maiestie find no lesse grace and fauour, than hath almost euery part thereof with other the aforesaid and such like most mightie and famous Princes: and the rather, for that your Maiestie hath not disdained in your Lepanto, or Heroicall Song, vvith your learned Muse to adorne and set forth the greatest and most glorious victorie that euer was by any the Christian confederat princes obtained against these the Othoman Kings or Emperors. Besides that, the matter and argument of this Historie and such like (so much con∣cerning

the state and good of the Christian commonweale in generall, neuer by any so much impugned or endangered, as by these the naturall & capitall enemies therof) of right vnto none so properly belongeth, as vnto your most excellent Maiestie, with the rest of the Christian princes, sitting at the helme of your Estates; who onely by your vnited forces (the barbarous enemies greatest terrour) are able to giue remedie thereunto: in the chiefest ranke of whom, your sacred Maiestie for glorie, honour, strength and power (God long preserue the same) is now second vnto none. Thus per∣suaded and encouraged, I in all humble and dutifull manner doe present vnto your Maiestie these my weake endeuours: which how vnworthie soeuer they be of so great and princely a fauour, as well for the meanenesse of me the Author, as for the plaine∣nesse of the style; yet if for the worthinesse of the matter, or of your owne great and infinit clemencie you vouchsafe them your Maiesties fauourable regard, they shall no doubt liue no lesse fortunat than if they had beene more happily borne and brought to light: seruing (if to no other vse) yet as faire warnings vnto such great ones as God hath here vpon earth exalted aboue the rest vnto the highest degrees of power and of state, for the good gouernment and defence of his church and people. Accept them I beseech you most mightie Monarch into your gratious protection, so shall I (if God spare life) be comforted & encouraged vnder so mightie a fauor to proceed to amend what shall be found amisse, and adde what future times and better helpe shall descrie and minister vnto me for the perfection of this Historie: and according to my boun∣den dutie incessantly in all humilitie pray vnto the great God of all might and power (by whom all kings and princes raigne) to his glory long to preserue your most royall Maiestie in blessed health and peace to rule and raigne ouer vs and these your great kingdomes, so happily by you vnited: and so like∣wise (his will so being) your most noble posteritie after you euen to the worlds end.
