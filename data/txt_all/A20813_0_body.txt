Great Ladie, essence of my cheefest good,
Of the most pure and finest tempred spirit
Adornd with gifts, enobled by thy blood,
Which by discent true vertue do'st inherit;
That vertue which no fortune can depriue,
Which thou by birth tak'st from thy gracious mother,
Whose royall mindes with equall motion striue
Which most in honor shall excell the other;
Vnto thy fame my Muse her felse shall taske
Which rain'st vpon mee thy sweet golden showers,
And but thy selfe, no subiect will I aske,
Vpon whose praise my soule shall spend her powers.
Sweet Ladie then, grace this poore Muse of mine,
Whose faith, whose zeale, whose life, whose all is thine.
