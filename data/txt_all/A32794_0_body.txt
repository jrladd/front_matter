SIR,
I Have made bold to direct these Papers to you, as a Testimony of my respect, and as being assured, that you are a true Pro∣testant of the Church of England established by Law.
As for such as falsly, and with a contradiction, so term, and call themselves Roman Catholicks, I expect no such Readers.
As for Protestants in Masquerade, whose worldly designs make them sit loose to all Religions, they may see what may reform them, if not convince them.
But as for your self, and such as are Protestants out of consci∣ence, you and they, who are peaceable Sons of the most Apostolical Church of England, may read what may confirm them in their true faith and Worship, and what may comfort and support them under any fears, dangers, hardships, that may attend them in and for their so being and doing: God being still the same yesterday, to day and for ever. He that hath delivered, doth deliver, will deliver.
To his blessing I commend these Papers. To his protection and gui∣dance your self and second-self, with all your Family. And sub∣scribe my self,
Bristol,Novemb. 16. 1681.
