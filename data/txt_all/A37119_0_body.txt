May it please your Grace,
IN imitation of the In∣scription
of the gol∣den
Apple that Paris
had to distribute a∣mong
the Goddesses, which was,
Let it be given to the fairest,
as a gift which only the greatest
beauty was worthy of; I humbly
present to your Grace this small
Mirror of Feminine yet He∣roick
Vertues, as a glasse where∣in
none but the most vertuous

are capable to dresse themselves:
A pattern not to be imitated by
the Vulgar.
Your Grace may herein see
briefly, yet fully displayed, the
frailty and inconstancy of hu∣mane
greatness, and the heighth
of goodness. A Princesse of
the greatest Extract, the greatest
Alliance, the greatest Vertue,
that this Western World hath
for many years boasted of; re∣duced
to the utmost of those
miseries wherewith an adverse
Fortune could afflict her; yet
in all of them bearing her self
up with an unbyassed soul.
'Tis easie, Madam, whilest
our Fortunes are constant to us,
to be constant to our Vertues.
That Pilot must certainly be
very unskilled, who with a fair
and prosperous gale, shall steer
an indirect course. Afflictions
are the greatest tryal of a Noble



Spirit; and patience in them
the chief of Vertues.
Yet was it not the greatest
of this Queens unhappinesses,
that she was unhappy, but that
some men by malicious Scan∣dals
strove to make her guilty
of somewhat they thought de∣serving
so great Afflictions; as
if to be miserable, must like∣wise
include being wicked.
But were happiness, Madam,
alwayes appropriate to good∣ness,
or did Vertue continually
carry it's reward along with it,
we might have just reason to
suspect and believe that some
horrid wickednesses lately per∣petrated
amongst us, were ra∣ther
Pieties in the highest de∣gree.
But her goodness and pa∣tience
have overcome all scan∣dals;
and as she hath lived the
Mirror of the latter to all the



World, so she may be a pattern
of the other to succeeding gene∣rations.
In the mean time, that the
Rising Sun of your GRACES
Vertues and Honours may still
soar higher, but never know
a declension, is the earnest
prayer of
