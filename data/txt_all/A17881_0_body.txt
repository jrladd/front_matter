WHat Patron could I chuse, great Lord, but you?
Graue words your years may challenge as their owne,
And eu'ry note of Musicke is your due,
VVhose House the Muses pallace I haue knowne.


To loue and cherish them, though it descends
VVith many honours more on you, in vaine
Preceding fame herein with you contends,
VVho haue both fed the Muses, and their trayne.


These Leaues I offer you, Deuotion might
Her selfe lay open, reade them, or else heare
How grauely with their tunes they yeeld delight
To any vertuous, and not curious eare.
Such as they are accept them Noble Lord;
If better, better could my zeale afford.
