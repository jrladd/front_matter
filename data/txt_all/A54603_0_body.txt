My Lord,
HAving the Honour of being your Neighbour in Suffolk, it London, and in our Publick Imployments; and your Lordship knowing the occasion of my Wri∣ting, upon this subject, affords me some reasons of Dedicating this to your Lordship, to shew you how I spent my time (when I had any little leisure from business, which I seldom neglected) persuant to An∣toninus advice, that if one should ask me at any time what I was thinking, I might be able to give an account of some worthy matter, and therefore I made Choice of this
Story, which hath furnish'd me with above an 100 several Sub∣jects, which always fed my Thoughts with such safe Varieties, that they fenc'd out the Consideration of other troubles which might have perplex'd them: My Method of Writing, I borrow'd from Mal∣vezzi his Davido persecutato my Extravagant way, from Moun∣taine, who in his Essayes, under∣takes in one Chapter to write of Thumbs, and yet not one word of them in all that Discourse, for have observ'd in the Countrey, that when I forsook the path, which would have guided me to the place I design'd, and cross'd the Pastures somtimes I started Hares, somtimes sprang Partridges, or observ'd some curious Plants; which plea∣sures I had never injoy'd if I had confin'd my self to the path, yet
I kept my Eye on it, (least I should stray too far) and return'd home by it, and inliven'd or inrich't my thoughts with the Contempla∣tions of what happen'd by my di∣gressions.
Possibly, these Excursions might have been more excusable to me in my Youth, than in my Age; but it is a solace to me, that I can be yet youthful in my notions, and if your Lordship please to peruse these as a Recreation, your Lordship will very much Honour,
My Lord,
