My LORD,
THO the Favour my generous and worthy Friends have done me
in vindicating this COMEDY against the ridiculous Malice
of a prejudicd Party be very considerable, and I ought to be ex∣treamly
well satisfied with my present good Fortune, yet is not my
Contentment perfect, till I am so happy to lay it to your Feet; and by your
unquestion'd Merit, Iudgment and noble Patronage, secure the Credit of
these printed Sheets in the reading, as the Applause of the Impartial, and
Iudicious, have already done in the Presentation.
The Character your Lordship leaves amongst all Persons of Honour and
Worth, has encourag'd my Ambition to aspire to this honour; and tho'
the Trifle which I humbly Dedicate to you, has not merit enough to de∣fend
me from being thought too presuming, yet the dutious Desire and Zeal
I have to serve your Lordship, and express my Gratitude for your abundant
Favours all manner of ways, will I'm sure, by your generous Nature, that
never frown'd on an addressing Author, nor discourag'd Wit, tho' in its
meanest quality, be receiv'd as I intend it. I have too long had the Honour
and Happiness to know your Lordship to be Ignorant of your great Modesty,
when you are oblig'd to hear any thing relating to your own Praise; and I
mòst humbly beg you to believe, that I have not so much of the Authors
common Quality, and which we see so generally us'd in all Dedications, that
I do pretend to flatter Merit like Yours, or offend your Eyes with an Enco∣mium
upon your Virtues, which perhaps no Poet has Wit or Skill enough to
do you Iustice in, and which your uncommon Modesty, and admir'd Hu∣mility
I'm sure would discourage in us if we could.
The Panegyrical Part then of a Dedication, which I confess I cannot for
fear to think reasonable here, because I know it would be just in a manner
quite laid aside, for what can I say in your Praise that our little World
here does not already know, your Early Courage and Bravery of Soul, has
made its Course like the Sun, and in relation to Europe, has almost ex∣tended
it self as far, especially where Honour was to be got, or any glorious
Action was going forward; and as I believe 'tis impossible for any Person

to give a better accompt of the Sieges of Vienna or Buda then your self,
you omitting no Enterprise that could either signalize your Courage, or satisfie
your Curiosity so 'tis as obvious to the World, that the Great Leopaldus by
the glorious Spread Eagle, so royally bestowed and nobly added to your
Houshold Coat, sufficiently gave a Testimony that nothing but extraordinary
Worth could be capable of gaining such an Honour.
This my Lord is so poor a Diminution of so extensive a Merit, that
I'm afraid I shall rather be accused of Injustice than Flattery: for saying
any thing in your Praise could not be done without saying much more than
this, especially should I consider like a right Author, that the Muses are as
much oblig'd to you for your generous Incouragement and Protection, as your
Country is for Loyalty, Love and Resolution.
To be Patron both of Arts and Arms is a Title my Lord worthy of
you, and which the Actions of your Life daily demonstrate, that you will
more and more deserve, for whilst the Sons of Mars admire your Expe∣rience
in War, and the Sons of Apollo your acquirements of Wit and
Iudgmnt, no Name can appear fairer in the Book of Fame, nor no Worth
better deserve to have a Subscription there.
And as I cannot, my Noble Lord, but think it very reasonable for ex∣traordinary
Persons to be rewarded with Blessings as extraordinary; so I
cannot enough express my hearts entire Ioy, that the very Best that Hea∣ven
can bestow is lately fallen upon you, in the possession of so much Vertue
and Beauty, which to her lasting Fame is so gloriously exalted, that even
Sacred Majesty, our never enough Renown'd Royall Mistress (than whom
none is more Learn'd in the Eternal Volumes of Goodness,) is full of her
Aplause, and that this extreamest Happiness which now you possess, may
Crown your Days and Nights to all Eternity is the unfeign'd and real
wish of
My LORD,
