IF I hadd vndertaken this enter∣prise, not beyng enduced more of earnest cōsideration of the cause I take in hand, and present neces∣sitie of the tyme, then of any allu∣rement of priuate commoditie, or presumptuous oftentation, or vayneglorious persuation of mynde (most Renowmed and vertuous Prince kyng Sebastian) I should not one∣ly haue bene accoumpted blameworthy in the Iudge∣ment of all the godly, but also haue willfully plunged my selfe into deserued obloquy of all the world: that beyng a poore despised abiect, a seely wretched vnder∣lyng, so meere a straunger, and so farre seuered from you by distaunce of place, without all maner of ac∣quaintaunce either of name, or of Title, neither called nor cōmēded by any desert, nor by any person cōmaū∣ded hereunto, dare so boldly presume to write vnto your highnesse beyng the mirrour of all Princely dig∣nitie. But as the occasion that moued me to attempt your Maiestie, seemed of no small importaunce: so the oportunitie of the matter it selfe yelded vnto me no lesse euident Argument of assured affiaunce and auda∣citie (though in vtter apparaunce vnseemely) yet par∣donable (I trust) vpon due examination of the cause. And yet besides this alleadged necessitie emplyeng reasonable excuse, I wanted not many others as com∣mendable aydes to defend my enterprise, if like exam∣ple

applyed in like cause may be allowable. For if Ie∣rome Osorius beyng as then but a priuate man, no lesse estraunged from the Societie of this common weale of ours, then a professed Enemy to the Religiō, which we embrace in Englād, prouoked either of some vayne glorious oftentatiō, or of greedy desire to maintayne his owne Religion, and to deface ours, vnder zeale of pretensed good will and affection borne, durst be so bold not onely to write so long and tedious an Epistle to our most Royall excellent Queene Elizabeth, but also so vnprouokedly to aduertize her highnes of mat∣ters inconuenient, daungerous to her soules health: why should I be condemned of insolency? if inflamed with sincere inclinatiō of most humble dutie towardes the most valiaunt Prince Sebastian kyng of Portingall, no lesse famous in Princely vertues, then valiaūt in ad∣ministration of power, if allured by the notable Re∣porte of his incomparable bounty, do send most hum∣ble greetyng in the Lord Iesu, in two or three wordes to his Maiestie, in recommendyng his highnesse to the gracious protection of the allmightie, with no lesse in∣crease of perfect peace and tranquillitie to him and his by Letter, then inwardly I wishe to his Maiesty frō the bottome of my hart. Neither do I see any reason to the contrary, why I should be more embraced in cōceipte, and driuē from my endeuour, hauyng so many notable commendations vttered by euery godly personadge in the behalfe of the famous kyng Sebastian, Renowmed in eche Coast for his excellencie in prowesse, and No∣blesse in dignitie: sithence Osorius through the plea∣saunt blast of the Trompe of fame, hath presumed so farre vpon the vnspeakable clemency of our Queenes most excellent Maiestie, whom he neuer sawe: when as also her highnesse of her aboundaunt grace hath with

so great lenitie entertayned the Letters of Osorius, and so gently perused them (though otherwise perhappes vnworthy so noble a personadge) why should not I persuade my selfe to obteine as much, yea more rather of your Princely magnificence, and heroicall clemen∣cy, especially sithence it cann not be credible that kyng Sebastian beyng a man, cann any ioate be inferiour to Elizabeth a womā Queene, in any Princely ornamētes or dutie of Humanitie?
But there will some peraduenture be founde not farre from emongest vs, to whō this comparison which I do make betwixt vs two Osorius and me, will seeme in no respect agreable: for as much as he beyng a con∣staunt frend to the true and Catholicke Churche (as they will alleadge) doth take vpon him a most commē∣dable and necessary cause: But my defence, they will say, of sett purpose proclaimyng opē warre agaynst the most aūcient Catholicke Church, agaynst sincere Re∣ligion, agaynst the approued supremacy of the Byshop of Rome, hath bene allwayes hitherto atteinted by Iudgement of all Monarches, and by consent of all de∣grees condemned and banished and ought not by any meanes be admitted into the Courtes and eares of Princes, as matter exempt from all protection and pri∣uiledge of godly Lawes. This Obiection is no new thyng, & whereof I haue long agoe well & aduisedly debated with my selfe, yea the very selfe same thyng (most Royall kyng) wherein I am become at this presēt your Maiesties most humble Suppliaunt, and whereof I determined to beseech your highnesse in the bowels of our Lord God (whose aucthoritie and person you do represent in your Realme) that ye would vouchsafe due consideration, Ierome Osorius Byshop of Syluain ban∣dyng and enforcing all his knowledge and skill agaynst

the professed doctrine of our Religion publiquely re∣ceaued in England, hath published in Printe three fa∣mous Libelles vnder the Title of an Aunswere to Mai∣ster Haddon: for Reply wherof we haue framed accor∣dyng to our slender capacitie this Apology, how con∣ueniently to the purpose I haue not to say, to what suc∣cesse it will come, is in the handes of the Lord, surely for the garnishment of phrase and Stile thereof I haue no great regard. For this our contention tendeth not to the blazyng of excellency in eloquence, neither treate we here of the delicacy and finesse of speach, neither descant we lyke Minstrelles of warblyng of stringes, ne yet tosse we our questions to and fro in vaunt of brauery of witte, Sophisters vse to argue of moates in the Sunne in their triflyng and Dunsticall Schooles: But we dispute as Deuines in matters of greatest importaunce, of true righteousnes, of the way to eternall saluation, and euerlastyng damnation, and of the true woshippyng of allmighty God. This Apo∣logy or Aunswere to the quarrellsome and slaūderous reproches of Osorius, how simple soeuer it appeare, we haue thought for no man so meete to be presented, as to your Maiestie (most excellēt kyng Sebastian) whom we most humbly craue and desire to be both a wittnes and a Iudge of the controuersie.
As for the questions wherewith Osorius doth in∣ueigh agaynst vs, we suppose are allready well knowen to your grace. Now therefore the petition that we de∣sire to obteyne of your highnesse is this in effect. That for as much as Osorius hath vttered all his cunnyng and eloquence by all meanes he may possibly to de∣praue vs (whō he vnhonestly reprocheth by the name of Lutheranes) not onely vnto your Maiestie, but to all other Princes of Christendome also, thereby to bryng

vs into vnappeasable hatred, it may please the Royall Maiestie of all godly Princes, not to conspire to geaue sentēce agaynst vs, before the matter be heard and de∣bated betwixt vs. And your highnesse especially (most noble kyng of Portingall) hauyng allready seene the clamours and brables of Osorius, beyng the best and chiefest Arguments that he vseth to deface the orders and obseruation of our profession, will vouchsafe also with like equitie and patience of minde, to admitte our confutation thereof into your presence: whereby eche partie beyng discouered according to truth, your high∣nes may more certeinly determine of the cause. There is a notable Law and an othe established in the Iudge∣mentes of the auncient Athenians: To heare with both eares, that indifferent eares should be open to eche partie. But what maner of custome is vsed now a dayes in this per∣plexitie and cōbate of opinions, where Byshops armed with the aucthoritie of Princes doe stand raunged in mayne battell agaynst the manifest veritie, and doe so bende the whole cōsent of their fayth to the one partie that all libertie once to mutter is vtterly cutte of from the other partie?
But here may some contrary doubtfullnes parad∣uēture trouble your Royall thought, not so much pro∣ceedyng from your gracious nature, as whyspered into your godly eares by the subtill and slaunderous practi∣zes of glaueryng glosers: who vnder the counterfaict vysour of this glorious coūterfaict Church, haue won∣derfully bewitched the eyes and eares of many noble personadges, & vnder pretēce of succeeding course of many yeares, do make glorious bragges, that this new-fangled Church, wherein the Romish Byshopp in en∣thronized is the onely Catholicke Church, and the su∣premacy thereof to be onely obeyed, alleadgyng the

same Church to be the Empresse and gouernesse of all other Churches, and which of right ought to be estee∣med aboue all Kinges & Emperours, as ouer the which Christ hath substituted the Byshopp of Rome his sole Vicar and Vicegerent earth: and therfore that all de∣grees ought and may safely submitt themselues to the aucthoritie and determination of that Churche, as which beyng continually vpholden by the power and blessing of the holy Ghost, was neuer seene hitherto to haue erred, ne yet could by any meanes swarue one title from the right lyne and knowen trade of the true fayth taught in holy Scriptures. And that all other per∣sons whatsoeuer sequestering thēselues frō the prescript Rules and Cannons of that Churche, cann not chuse but runne headlong into wandryng errours, amazed blindenes, and extreme maddnes. Wherefore those Lutheranes and Hugonoughtes are worthely to be ex∣pelled from the vnitie of that Church, and deseruedly adiudged to fier and fagottes as most dampnable here∣tiques, not worthy of any fauorable protection, no not their writinges so much as to be touched with any mās handes, bycause they dare presmoūte once to quacke agaynst the supremacy of that Angelicke Ierarchy.
As touchyng which slaunderous surmises, albeit nothyng cann be more falsely and shamefully imagi∣ned, then those Sorcerous enchaūtementes, it is won∣der, how much this poysoned Dolldreanche hath be∣typpledd the sences of many great personadges, and hath so long preuailed in great admiration with sundry estates, through the onely ignoraunce of learnyng and ouermuch credulitie of godly Princes: vntill of late by the incomprehensible prouidence of Almightie God, the worthy Arte of Emprintyng was erected, by meanes whereof good Letters and Bookes came to the

Marte: and Printers shoppes discouered the foggy and darkened cloudes of this olde mothe eaten barbarous∣nes. Hereby it came to passe, that the tedious & deepe doungeons of lothesome ignoraunce beyng surprised with a certein new and cleare dawnyng day of purer doctrine, as also of all other liberall Sciences beganne to shyne abroade, nor will leaue (I trust) to ouer∣spread his brighte glisteryng beames dayly more and more, vntill with the inaccessible brightenes thereof it do either thoroughly vanquishe the whole kyngdome of darkenes, or at the least chaūge the same into some better countenaunce. And to the ende we may con∣ceaue assured hope of good successe herein, two thynges do minister vnto vs especiall comfort. Wher∣of the one consisteth in the mearcy of the Lord, the o∣ther remayneth in your handes that be Kynges and Princes next vnder the God, being the Lordes watchmen. For the first we haue an infallible Argument which cann neuer deceaue, the assured testimony of Iesus Christ, who hath prophecied in his holy Scriptures, that the same shalbe brought to passe: the greater part whereof we haue allready experimented to be accom∣plished in these our dayes. That the Lord with the breath of his mouth shall confounde the pride of the Beast so arrogant∣ly vaunting him selfe in his holy Temple. For the next: That other is of no small force, I meane your vigilant wisedomes and singuler godlynes, which causeth vs to cōceaue well of you that are Princes, whom the Lord of his infinite mearcy hath ordeyned to exercize chief rule and gouernemēt next vnder him vpon the face of the earth, especially whenas him selfe hath pronoun∣ced out of his owne mouth in the Reuelation of Saint Iohn, That he will lende his helpyng handes hereun∣to saying.Apoca. 17.
And the tenne hornes (sayth he) which thou

didst see vpon the Beast, are those enne Kinges, which shall abhorre the Babylonicall Strampett, and shall make her deso∣late and naked, and shall deuoure her fleshe, and burne her Carkasse in flames of fire: for the Lord hath inspired into their hartes to bring this to passe, euen as it hath pleased him. Apocal. 17.
Wherfore awake you noble Princes and Christian Captaines, march on in Gods name: Atchieue an ex∣ployte worthy your noble Race, and be no longer tray∣ned with the trayterous sleightes of subtill sycophātes: but pursue with the power the godly guidyng of the Lord of hostes. Emongest whom I most humbly call vpon your highnes (most singuler Paterne of Princely Roy∣altie) not to the ende to teaze you to exercize cruelty agaynst that viperous generation. Onely my petition is (that for the loue you beare to Iesus Christ, and your owne soules health) ye vouchsafe to deliuer simple innocentes from the bloudy iawes of those rauenyng Wolues, and horrible blouddsuckers. That enter∣chaunge of thynges beyng made, the true and pure word of God may be heard what it teacheth. And that ye lett lowse the reynes of their licentious insolency no longer, so that they do not hereafter abuse you, as the Iewes did handle our Lord Iesu Christ, whose facē when they had blindefolded, they beate his body with whippes. There hath bene to many broyles allreády emongest vs Christians: to much Christian bloud hath bene spilte: to much crueltie and horror hath bene exequuted, whiles you in the meane space (in whose power rested the staye of this outrage) either wincked at their bootchery, or at the least, left poore innocentes succourlesse in their slaughter houses. How long shall this Romishe Nymrod vaunt in his throne? how long shall he make a scorne of your patience (most excel∣lent

Princes) when will your Royall hartes and noble courage daunte his pride? when will you resume into your handes the whole sword of Iustice, the better part whereof the Romishe Russian hath bereft you? when will you surcease to be bondeslaues vnto them, whom the mighty God hath made vassalles to your lawfull Regimēt? how long will ye suffer your mouthes to be mooseled, and your eyes muffeled with such blynde errours contrary to the manifest light of the Gospell? If the questions (whereof ariseth our con∣trouersie) were so harde and intricate, that they excee∣ded your capacities, I would not haue entruded my selfe into your presence with this maner of persuasion, but would haue referred my selfe rather to the censure of the learned. But for as much as this Religion of Gods holy Gospell, which we professe, is so resplēdi∣sant in the eyes and eares of all men, as the bright shy∣ning Sunne in whott Sommers day, the doctrine (I say) wherewith we are enstructed, which preacheth Repē∣taunce to the bruysed cōscience, which agayne impu∣teth vnto the penitent persons free righteousnesse and deliueraunce from Sinne by fayth without workes in Christ Iesu onely, which forbiddeth Idolatry, which restrayneth to adde or diminish any title from the pres∣cript rule of holy Scriptures, which forbiddeth the in∣uocation of the dead and prayeng to straūge Goddes, which acknowledgeth the humanitie of Christ the Sonne of God to be in no place, but at the right hand of the Father, which approueth honest and honorable estate of Wedlocke in all persons indifferently: which hath made all foode and sustenaunce both fishe and flesh without choyse (beyng receaued with thankesge∣uyng) subiect to the necessary vse of man, which taketh away all confidence and affiaunce vsually ascribed vn∣to

merites and workes, which calleth vs away from the opiniō of soules health, to be set in obseruation of pres∣cribed dayes and monethes: which reduceth vs from the naked elementes of the world, from worshippyng of signes and outward ceremonies, which (I say) clea∣reth our hartes and myndes from the bondage of mens traditions and dreames, and doth ensure and establish vs in mearcy and grace: which allureth all persons in∣differently to the readyng of holy Scriptures: which denyeth to no man the participation of the Cuppe of the new Testament in the bloud of Iesu Christ: which abbridgeth all Ministers of the word from desire of all worldly superiority. And to stay here frō the reckoning vpp of all the rest, which are more notable and mani∣sest then the bright shynyng Sunne in mydday, what cann your Maiestie atchieue more worthy, or more beseemyng your highe excellency, then to admitt in∣to the secrett closett of your soule this most euident trueth of heauenly discipline? If your highnesse be not as yet made acquainted therewith: or if ye know the same to be infallible and true, that ye will no longer shrowde vnder your protection such pestilent errours allready disclosed and repugnaunt to the knowen veri∣tie: wherewith your grace may one day hereafter par∣aduenture desire to be shielded before the dreadfull Iudgemēt seate of the Lord of hostes, accordyng to the promise of Iesu Christ. And the trueth (sayth he) shall de∣liuer you. Iohn. 8.
And if your highnes shalbe persuaded, that this re∣formatiō of Religion, whereof I haue treated, doth not apperteigne to your estate, or to the charge of seculer Princes: what doth the wordes of Osori. emporte thē? wheras writyng of our gracious Queene Elizabeth, he doth so carefully admonish her Maiestie to vouchsafe

especiall regard to know, what the glory of Christ mea∣neth, what the law of the Lord teacheth, & how much the rule of sacred religiō doth exact of her highnes. A∣gain whereas in the same Epistle he doth very learned∣ly pronoūce, that the speciall duty of Princely gouer∣nemēt ought to be wholy employed to the preseruatiō of true and pure Religion? Pag. 10. But els otherwise if your grace do thoroughly conceaue that is most true, that the gracious restitutiō of gods holy word doth no lesse cōcerne the furtheraūce of the Gospell, then the preseruatiō of your Royall estate, & Saluation of your subiectes, I most humbly then beseech you (most noble kyng) by that redoubled linke of pietie, wherewith you are first bounde vnto the Lord: That as your Maiestie shall playnly perceaue this cause which we are entred vpon, not to varye or decline any iote awrye from the true touchestone of the liuely word neuer so litle, that your highnesse of your excellent clemency will vouch∣safe to aduertize your Bysh. Osorius: That being mynd∣full of his professiō he do behaue him selfe in debatyng the state of Religion, in the vprightenes of iudgement so as the cause requireth, and frō henceforth he desiste frō backbyting his neighbours with clamorous lyeng, and slaunderous reproches, who haue rather deserued well of him, then in any respect offended him. If he be of opinion that errours ought to be rooted out of the Church, lett him first cōuince those for errours, which he gaynesayth, and shew him selfe abler man to make proofe by Argumēt, thē to resist with onely cauillyng: By such meanes will he be deemed a more profitable member of the Church, and procure him selfe lesse ha∣tred. It is an easie matter for euery common rascall to vomitt out disdaynefull names of infamous persons as Protagoras, Diagoras, Cicloppes, Blindsinckes, Epicu∣res,

gortellguttes, and monsters. But it fitteth comlyer for learned men, and more profitable for the Christian congregation, to lay aside distompered choler, and in∣struct the vnlearned, and reclayme the obstinate with sounde Argumentes and expresse testimonies of the Scriptures. If this order be not obserued, euery carter may soone by aucthoritie clayme to be a cōmon ray∣ler. An other methode of writyng was requisite in O∣sorius more effectuall to edifie, then as he hath vttered in his bookes. For this sufficeth not for him to reuile men with odious names, as callyng them madd, impu∣dent, childish and infaūtes, and to declame whole cō∣mon places vsed agaynst heretiques. I doe know and playnly confesse. That it is most necessary to oppugne erronious sectes & heresies. But it is not errour forth∣with that hath somewhat a bitter smatclie, and is vn∣sauory to euery queysie stomacke, neither is it all∣wayes trueth, that is plausible to eche fonde and do∣tyng phantasie.
But wise men ought chiefly haue considered, how euery mans assertiō is framed to the agreablenes of the word of God. Yet now a dayes I cann not tell how, the carte is sett before the horse, and the preposterous fro∣wardnes of some persons haue brought to passe, that bycause men shall not be guided by the Gospell, they will runne before it, & so mens imaginatiōs shall not o∣bey but beare the principall Banner before. But where as the right squaryer of Christian fayth hath none o∣ther sure foundation but that onely, which is groun∣ded vpon the holy Scriptures, our dutie hadd bene to direct the buildyng of our Religion by this lyne and le∣uell, and to ramme fast the wallworkes hereof with this cemente and morter. But now I cann not tell how it is so come to passe, that many do worke guyte contrary.

For they despise this well fenced order, and hauyng as litle regarde to the meanyng & purporte of the word, they rayse to them selues a Church (which they call Catholicke) and the same they assigne to be the onely guide and gouernesse: yet notwithstandyng they make no demonstration whether it be the Church of Christ yea or nay. But measuryng the same by the onely Title of the Romish See, through swiftenesse of opiniō, doe affirme her to be such a Church, as cann by no meanes goe astray, and whatsoeuer this Church doth denoūce and commaunde, the same they doe most greedely catche after with the whole bente of their fayth, and defende it with tooth and nayle. Out of this sincke were plumped at the first mens traditions, and sundry preiudiciall opinions, as certein vnreproueable deter∣minations, they call them Vnwritten Verities which by leysure they do cōferre with the Scriptures, but in such sorte, that whatsoeuer shall seeme to serue for their purpose, they Canonize the same as inuiolable: but if ought be founde contrary to their expectation, then either they submitt it to the Iudgemēt of the Church, or with violent wrestyng, do racke the same to colour their suggestions.
And hereof sprang all that Darnell and Cockell of errours and dissensions, bycause many men did fashion their fayth after this frameshapen chaungelyng, and not after the simple conduct of the word. In which Church when they perceaued those and such other doctrines to be embraced, as these, to witte, that the Romish See ought to be supreme Empresse ouer all o∣ther Churches: that Purgatory must be beleeued: That Pardons were necessary: that vowes made to re∣mayne vnmaried were meritorious: That Mounckery and cowled profession hadd a certein wonderfull per∣fectiō:

That Images ought to be worshipped: Sainctes prayed vnto: and that the Grace and deseruynges of Iesu Christ could not of it selfe suffice to the attayne∣ment of Saluation: That no man could obteyne righ∣teousnes through fayth without workes. That Christ him selfe flesh, bloud, and bones was conteined and sa∣crificed in the Masse vnder bare accidentes: That lay persons should be denied the vse of readyng the Scrip∣tures, & participatyng the cuppe of the Lord. All these and many other like drugges, though they neuer could finde in the liuely wellsprynges of holy Scriptu∣res, yet bycause they perceaue them to be shryned in the Decrees and Decretalles of Rome, they doe con∣stauntly beleeue that they must be of as autentique au∣cthoritie, as if they were so many Oracles lettē downe from heauen. Hereby cometh to passe, that vnder the vysour of the Churche, sondry deformed byshapes of doctrine are fostered vpp in the Church: and vnder the pretence of Christ, the true Gospell of Christ is in no small daunger to be vtterly defaced. So that the la∣mentable complaynte vttered by Chrisostome, could neuer so aptly be applyed as to this our Age: Many doe walke (sayth he) vnder the name of Christians, but very fewe in the trueth of Christ. But bycause we haue debated these matters with Osorius hereafter at large, I will not deteigne your Royall Maiestie with any further Register thereof.
It remayneth, that we make humble intercession to almightie God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that of his immeasurable mearcy and loue, wherewith he disdayned not to disclose him selfe vnto mankynde by his Sonne, he will vouchsafe to beautifie and esta∣blishe, and with his mighty power and outstretched arme to defende and make permanent from all errours

and bloudy bootchery the true light of his holy Gos∣pell, the bright beames whereof hath allready enligh∣tened the earth. We beseeche him likewise, that by the Trompett and dewe administration of his Gos∣pell, the kyngdome of darkenesse may dayly more and more be subuerted, and the Church and kyngdome of his Sonne Iesu Christ may be dispersed abroad, ouer the face of all the earth, and preached thorough our all Nations and tounges. Lastly we pray, that he will endue all Christian Kynges and Princes beyng sett in aucthority, and especially the puissaunt and victorious Sebastian Kyng of Portingall, with all Princely orna∣mentes, to enriche him with all perfect and absolute clemency, in vertue and true godlynesse, and to en∣lighten him with the knowledge of his glorious coun∣tenaunce, and establishe his throne, to the settyng forth of his glory, and aduauncement of his Church, through the merites of the same our Lord Iesus Christ: who graunt you in this world millions of his grace, and in the world to come lyfe e∣uerlastyng.
Amen.
