IT is the duetie of euery good Magistrate, Right honou∣rable, not onely to establishe good Lawes for the preser∣uation of a common wealth: but also to prouide for the health of the com∣mons. And since during the time, next vn∣der God, and our most vertuous Prince, the gouernment of this Citie of London is committed to your charge: I could not de∣uise a fitter▪ Patrone for this booke intitu∣led, A new counsell against the Pestilence, latelye by me Englished, both for the good wyll I am assured you beare towarde the Citie, and the welfare thereof: As also for that vnder the auctoritye of your Honours name, that it might be the more thankfully receyued, and better lyked of within the same. In whiche Citie this greeuous plague of Pestilence, hath more fiercely raged at other times, then now it doth: God bee thanked therefore, whome I beseeche it

may do lesse: and should do lesse at this pre∣sent, I suppose, if at your Lordships com∣maundement, the officers looked more nighlye vnto the precise execution of such holsome ordinaunces as are made in that behalfe, as also for the cleane & swéete kée∣ping of the streetes and other places: by o∣mitting whereof, the ayre becommeth cor∣rupt & contagious, bringing the Citie into obloquie, the Citizens into contempt, im∣pouerishing the commons, and depriuing many of Gods people of their lyues. Some priuate causes there bee also, not nowe to bée recited, pricking mee thus boldlye for∣warde to trouble your Honour with thys small trauaill, both in respect of your ver∣tues many wayes, and for the worthines of the writer, in whose commendation for want of time and place, I wyll say nothing, the worke sufficientlye praysing it selfe, which notwithstanding, I commit vnto your Honours most fauourable tuition, with my selfe, as a simple, yet hartye wel∣wyller, and your Honours most humble at commaundement:
