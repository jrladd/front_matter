Octob. 9. 1686.
SIRE,
THE final Ruin of Antichrist is at hand, it will not be many Tears before this will he fully com∣pleated; it will begin in a very short time, the Pope is the great Antichrist, the power of the Papacy his Anti∣christian Kingdom: I do not say how this shall be accom∣plished, whether by Noise, Confusion, and Violence, or by the Spirit of the Lord working in the Hearts of Kings and Princes to take away the Power they have so long given to the Beast, or by a general Conversion of the Heathen World, and coming in of the Jews, all con∣spiring towards the overthrow of Superstition, and Idola∣try, and making Way for the true Kingdom of Christ on Earth, in that universal Piety and Holiness, which shall prevail throughout the World; only that this shall be, and that the time is at hand, is what I think I can by God's Assistance demonstrate. I most dutifully premonish, and in the Name of Christ beseech your Majesty not to be found in the RƲINS OF ANTICHRIST, or to share in his Plagues.



Sire, As you value either a Temporal or Eternal, an Earthly, or Heavenly Crown, despise not the Warning: Let not the Drolls of the Ignorant or Prophane rob you of the Price put in your hand to get Wisdom, Prov. 17. 16.
