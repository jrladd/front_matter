Right Honourable,
HAving given to the Publique (accord∣ing
to desire) the first Lecture concer∣ning
an Introduction to Cosmo¦graphy,
read gratis in the Academy
which I have endeavoured to Erect, for the glory
of God, the honour of this State and Nation, the
encouragement and improvement of all Lovers
of Vertue. I have accompanied the same (by way
of respect and humble duty) with a Dedicatory E∣pistle
to the Right Honourable Speaker of the
most Honourable Assembly of Parliament; And
accordingly take leave, humbly to present this Prin∣ted
Lecture to your Lordship, who sits at the Helm

of that great Councell of State, on which the wisest
publique Ministers of the world look with great ob∣servance.
And as I may humbly conceive this Dedica∣tion
to be very fit, This Lecture beginning with
a Summary Description of the Orders of the Hea∣vens,
of their Revolutions, and Distances,
so many times by those Orders which passe at the
Councell of State, this part of the world is to
be Governed, so as that the Question may prove
not inpertinent, whether or no this State shall bee
a second Earthly Paradise, And all the Revo∣lutions
setled answerable to the same, that there be
no Distances between Peace, Righteousnesse,
and Truth, but that all may be so united, as to meet
and kisse each other perpetually, Being the fer∣vent
wishes and prayers of
Right Honourable,

Bednall green, this 5 of Novemb.
1649.
