NOt to be tedious to your good Lordship, and Worships (considering your waigh∣tie affaires at this time) In few wordes (presuming vpon your courtecies) I present you with this poore Pamphlet or Epitaph, which I haue made on the death of the late most reuerend the Lord of Canterburie his Grace: (to whom I was much bounden and beholding, as many of his Gentlemen and others do well know.) And now being driuen with the streame of my loue, duetie, and good-will to his grace, as also to your good L. and Worships: I can not but doe some thing (with others) as the last part of seruice that I can doe for his Grace in this life: I most humbly beseech you all there∣fore, to accept well of the same, and to protect it vnder the winges of your fauours; and then I shall not need to care for Zoylus, Momas, and the rest of that viperous brood. &c.
