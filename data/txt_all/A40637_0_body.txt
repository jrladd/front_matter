Dear Sir,
SOme Men admire what Jacob meant by so small a Present to so great a Person as Jo∣seph was then in Ae∣gypt, a little Balm and a little Honey, Nuts and Almonds, &c. But the Text clears all, Gen. 43.11. They were the Best Fruits of the Land. I shall like∣wise be condemned for making so mean a Re∣turn to so mighty Obligations I lye under; My Excuse is, It is the best my present Con∣dition
is capable of. Here I freely confess, it was not the Importunity of any, wrested this small Treatise from me; Nor was it an Itch to be in Print. I understand well enough the Humors of a Censorious Age, that every Innocent Discourse must run the Gantelope therein, and receive a Lash from all Dissent∣ing Parties: But I hoped it might do good to some, for whom I ought to have a Real kindness: However, hereby I shall take oc∣casion to declare to the World my resentment of your great Civilities. And he that hath an Hand to receive, and not a Tongue to re∣turn Thanks, deserves for the future to be both Lame and Dumb; which Punishment, that it may not light on me, Accept this ac∣knowledgment of your many Favours bestow∣ed on,
