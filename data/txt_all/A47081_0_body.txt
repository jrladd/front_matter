MOst blessed three, one God, Divinity
Protect thy number (sacred Trinity)
To whom I prostrate here thy gift, my will,
Grant them O Lord the peace of Conscience still,
True honours grace (thou knowst) I as a Bird
Escapt the Foulers snare when death was fear'd,
My braines being chrusht, my Temples crackt, I fled
From thence, and by a blessed Angell led;
The Spirit of grace, my faith, my hope reviv'd,
And for these seaventeene yeares hath me repriv'd
From death, to shew the world Gods gift, this Story,
That Sabbath-Breakers might behold my glory;
And Gods elect may see the reason why
I was so plung'd in dreadfull misery:
The truth it doth declare at large, and how
Upon repentance God doth mercy show:
This gift is his, which humbly I present,
In hope you'l please t'accept the good intent
