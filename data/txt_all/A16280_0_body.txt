ALthough I knowe right well (mooste noble Prince) that ther be diuerse whi¦che bothe by their coūsaill and writyng, do to their vttermoste powers swade the v∣nion of Scotlande vnto youre highnes, by the mariage of their Quene, a meane thereunto bothe honourable and Godly: Yet ne∣uertheles, the same study and fur¦der declaraciō of your maiesties

title to the superioritie thereof, semeth vnto me to bee so indiffe∣rently perteinyng to all menne, whiche doo professe obedience to youre highnes, that no mannes studie ought to be taken as vain or vnthankefull, whiche humbly bryngeth furthe to that common vse, whatsoeuer iudgement, pro∣fite, or knowlege, he supposeth to haue founde, either by studie, or inquisiciō: foreseyng that in tem∣pestious vpswellynges of water or shipwracke, fire, or other like calamities of men, right accepta¦ble vnto vs is the labor of those and thankes worthie, which wil∣lyngly do runne to helpe vs, al∣though in the meane tyme there be other sufficient nombre, to de∣liuer vs from the perill obiected. Herefore moste noble prince, per∣ceiuyng

the auncient  this greate Britaigne, and ∣ding suche plentie of writers cō∣fessyng your superioritie of Scot∣land, as could not by any enten∣dement so fully consent vpō any vntruth, I thought it my deutie to offre vp thesame vnto youre highnes▪ whiche histories like as almightie God hath from tyme to time, in fauor of the truth and of your title preserued: So hath his Godhed signified no lesse fa∣uour to your highnes, vouchesa∣uyng to nobilitate thesame, in the persone of your maiestie con∣serued vnto this youre tyme, the noble house of Seymour, whose auncester Eldulph de Samour beeyng then Erle of Gloucester, many hundreth yeres a gone, in the tyme of Kyng Aurelie Am∣brose

lewe Hengest the Saxon, capitall enemy of the Briton na∣cion: y whiche noble seruice like as this Realme was deliuered from the tyrany of Saxons, and restored to the whole Empire & name of greate Briteigne: so we youre obedient and louyng sub∣iectes truste, that the right noble duke of Somerset, and the lorde Seimour of Sudeley, your gra¦ces high Admirall, youre Maie∣sties dere vncles, shall in the ser∣uice of your highnes, for the like restitucion of the name and Em∣pire of greate Briteigne vnto your highnes, shew thēselfes the worthie successors of such an aū∣cester. Neither haue I purposed herin with opprobrious wordes to skolde with the Scottes, and thereby to wipe of one durt with

another. Neither  builde vpon our awne Eng auethors, but all my purpo , by indifferent writers, with plain and euident truth (whiche thyng bothe time and maners do euer∣more require) to publishe youre maiesties right and their defence folowyng therein for the more part Veremūd, Camphil, Corne∣lius de Hibernia, and Boecius their awne auethors: whiche pei∣nes because I haue assumed ra∣ther as a necessarie seruice to my coūtrey, then for mine awne glo∣ry, I truste I shall offende none but suche, whom it should bee a∣shame to please. Myne inclina∣ciō is to haue the good worde of euery mā, but the diseased malice of some cannot saie well of any. Albeit, touchyng the phrase and

stile of this my writyng, if the∣same to any man shall not satis∣fie his expectacion, let hym con∣sider that in parte it behoueth to vse the wordes of the historie, in whiche I am restrained by pro∣mise of an Epitome: and that in the residue it was not my mynde to trisle with the fiue flowers of Rethorike, but to bryng rather faithfull, then painted gliteryng ouerture, vnto thinges afflicted. The veritie of the Histories I trust shall so hereby appere, that both the good men of Scotlāde, by reason, and thenemies (if any suche bee) by their awne shame shalbe driuē, to cōfesse this myne assercion to be true, and thesame suche as thoug the mariage by the iniquitie of some take not ef∣fecte, yet to publishe to the world

sufficient cause, for the  naunce of your majestie  against them, wherein the honor of a kyng may not geue place to their wilfull rebellion. And for recouery whereof, vndoubtedly almightie God for your syncere fauor to the auauncement of his holy woorde, will by his promise as he hath begon, continue your highnes in felicitie and vi∣ctory, ouer all his and your enemies, wher vnto all youre true subiec∣tes doo saie.
AMEN.
