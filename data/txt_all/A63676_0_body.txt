SIR,
IT is the occasion, not the opinion of any worth in this work, which presumeth a necessity to become publick; for seeing the best of men are not exempted from, and the worst do too willingly admit temptations, it is my de∣sire that this example may not only be printed in this paper, but imprinted in our hearts, Actiones Prece∣dentium sunt succedentium libri, The Actions of our Predecessors are our books, much more may this exem∣plary act become a book to us who are present, where∣in we may read Mans frailty, the Tempters malice, Gods great and ever to be remembred restraint. The Press and the Pulpit have of late been too guilty of light Wares, and traded too much (to our shame and sorrow) in triflls and unhappy troubles, Truth hath rather been suppressed then printed, not commended to the print, but condemned to the Press for silence; we have had papers stuffed with words of a new stamp, cruel murders vizarded with the title of signal victories, Faelix & prosperum scaelus virtus vocatur, and those sheets may now serve for the Authors pen∣nance. And it hath been the delight of the troublers
of our Israel, to enlarge their Pamphlets with a list of their murdered Brethren: As I cannot but sorrow for their sin and protest against their practice, so I cannot but conceive the printing of this haynom act may be no lesse then necessary: Here is not one  against another, but which is worse, a more unnatur war, a man fighting against himself; the Tempter here designing the final discomfiture of soul and body. Nobis est in exemplum; these works are warning-pieces, our sins and Satans wiles do assume his name, Legion, for they are many: Many sad blows do we receive from Satan, Peccata sunt totidem vulnera, and every day whilst we are in the field of this world presents a Duel unto us, our members warring against the Spirit we stand in need of Armour, and this pre∣sents unto us Armour like Davids, which we ought to prove; and Christ is here presented as a Champion, through whom we are only conquerours.
This is all I presume to present to you, it is no pride that puts me upon it, but that warrantable ambition to do the weaker people service, which, I hope, may beseech your acceptance and excuse.
SIR,
