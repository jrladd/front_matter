THou true vnderstander, my inuention doth wander with the quill of a
Gander, to shield mee from slander, to thy good protection, I yeeld in subâˆ£iection,
my poore imperfection, with friendly correction, and as thou dost
e, or stroake mee or strike mee, reproue mee or proue mee, or mooue mee,
 loue mee, or quiteme, or spight me, friend me, or mend me, or else not offend
: If in ought that is written, thy humors are bitten, seeme not to espy it, and
one will descry it. But if thou doest kick, the spurre sure will prick; and if thou
ing, the waspe then will sting. My verses are made, to ride euery Iade, but
are forbidden, of Iades to be ridden, they shall not bee snaffled, nor braued
or baffled, wert thou George with thy Naggon, that foughtst with Draggon, or
re you Great Pompey, my verse should bethumpe ye, if you like a Iauel against
 dare cauill. I doe not intend it as now to commend it, or yet to defend it. But
 mee I doe send it, to like it, or mend it, and when thou hast end it, applaud it
 rent it; my wits I could bristle, for a better Epistle, but yet at this time, this
 Rime, I send to thy view, because it is new. So Reader, adue.
