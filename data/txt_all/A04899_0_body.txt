HAuing of late yeeres addicted my selfe, especially amongst other Studies, to a more curious search and inquisition of this glorious and wondrous workeman∣ship of the World, (whereof the one moity is in a maner vnknowne to the other) endeauouring to giue my selfe some satis∣faction, by all such Relations and Discoueries as I could procure, of those Conntreys least knowne vnto vs; whether described by our Countreymen or by other forraine Trauellers▪ I became so af∣fected with the following Relation of Cochin-China by an Italian Iesuite, (who as it seemeth had beene resident there some yeeres) that I con∣ceiued



the description hee maketh of the Countrey, and the Commodities thereof, would not onely giue some contentment to the curiosity of others; but might also happely be vsefull to our Countreymen that trade and traffique in those Easterne parts: If not to open a traffique to China it selfe, on which it confineth; yet at the least to giue occasion of further enquiry and discouery; whether the Commodities of the Countrey be such as are preten∣ded, and the accesse of all Strangers so freely inui∣ted, as is heere insinuated.
I am not ignorant that your trading into these remote parts of the East Indies hath had many op∣posers, especially of the ignorant and weaker sort; who suppose the Treasure of the Realme to be ex∣hausted thereby, in regard that they haue heard of much Money carried thither as well as other Com∣modities, and some late disasterous euents and acci∣dents: as if it were no good husbandry to cast seed into the ground, because we are not alwayes assured to haue a happy Haruest. But this must not make any wise man impatient in his expectation of bet∣ter successe; which commonly commeth by a con∣stant continuance of all so well grounded procee∣dings. For (the case hauing beene well canuased and euery obiection discussed) your experience



hath taught, and your remonstrance to the Parlia∣ment hath manifested; that as the publike profit by forraine Trade, is the only meanes where∣by we gaine Treasure, (for Mines wee haue none which doe afford it) So the remotest traffique is alwayes most beneficiall to the publike Stocke; and the Trade to the East In∣dies doth farre excell all others.
I shall not need to enter into particulars, how many braue Ships are by this Trade yeerely buil∣ded, rigged and furnished; how many good Mar∣riners made and imployed; how many Artificers and handicrafts men set on worke; how many idle persons are taught to be seruiceable Sea-men; how our Enemies are affronted, and our Concur∣rents counter poised, which with many other obser∣uatious haue beene by sundry of your selues very euidently declared.
I will onely conclude, that seeing it is so many wayes apparent, that the Kings Customes are so much by your trading into these remotest regions increased; His Fame thereby spread into Persia, India, Iapan, China, Iaua, and euen to the ends of the world dispersed; His whole Realme and Kingdome thereby so much strengthened, safegar∣ded and enriched; with the Renowme Honour and



reputation thereof so much raised end enlarged. I could wish, that as the remote Nauigation publi∣shed by the Venetian Rhamusius, awakened the Industry of M•. Hakluyt, and happely of Mr. Pur∣chas after him, to their diligent gatherings of the most remarkeable Voyages of our Nation: so some other able person (of which our Countrey hath good store) were encouraged and stirred vp, to continue such Collections: Yet not onely to the re∣cording the exploits of our owne Nation; but also to collect and publish what they find worth the re∣garding amongst Forreiners, that may any way be seruiceable for the instruction of ours.
To such end this Relation is addressed vnto you, that if you find ought that may be vsefull there∣in, you may make your benefit thereof; (as it seem∣eth others of our neighbour Nations haue in some sort sought and attempted) or at least by your owne farther experience, controll and rectifie their mis∣takings: To which purpose I cast this poore Mite into your rich Treasury; and remaine,
