My LORD,
SINCE it hath pleased GOD once more in mercy to remember this poor Nation; for discovering to it thse unheard of Villanies and unparallel∣led Wickedneis that were coutriving against its Peace and Religion; I thought it my Duty to let my Countrey to have a Tast of the Nature of that subtil Enemy she hath to deal withal, who envyeth her Priviledges and Hap∣piness; and your Lordship appearing to stand by the Evidence with all Can∣dor becoming a Person of your Worth and Dignity, in order to a full De∣tection of the Frauds and Designs of these Vermine, I thought it my Duty to pray your Patronage and Protection of this little Treatise which I now publish. I have nothing, my Lord, to plead for me, but onely the innocency of my intention, and question not but your Lordship will appear, as you have ever done, to oppose this growing interest. And truly (my Lord) this Nation hath reason to bless the Most High God for your Care for her Peace and Establishment in the Profession of that Religion; which doth oblige all Subjects to all Loyalty to their Prince, and to live in Peace and Love one with another. This Treatise spake formerly the Italian Tongue, but now it is made to speak English; and in it I find such an Account of the Nations adversaries, which to my own knowledge they deserve, If it be faulty, it is be∣cause it is somewhat too short of them, Now (my Lord) I humbly conceive your Lordship will pardon that, because it was all the Author (who was of the Romish Religion) could say at that time when he first publisht it. This I hope your Honour will accept of thus presented, as I found it, without the least Alteration. I shall submit all to your Lordships Candor; therefore heart∣tily praying for your Lordships Prosperity, I humbly take leave to subscribe my selfe.
