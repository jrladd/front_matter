RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
BEing importuned by many to publish these my elucubrations upon the Epistle to the Hebrewes; J could thinke of none so fit as your Honour, being truely honourable both , for your vertue, and for the dignitie of your place, whereunto God hath advanced you. Jt is said of Chrysippus, that he wrote much; yet , dedicated them to no potent men, but conten∣ted himselfe , onely with an old woman, that saw his writings: In that he was injurious to posterity; For bo∣num est sui diffusivum, for the good of others. And the Wri∣ters of all ages had neede to flie to the Patronage of great men, as to a kinde of Sanctuary. You are Chancellour of the Ʋniver∣sitie of Cambridge: Of the which that may be verified, which is spoken of the Academie of Alexandria, that it was , a shop of all good learning, wherein your Honour, together with your noble brother was trained up: And in that

Colledge, whereof my selfe was once a fellow of the Founda∣tion. But  is best, when wee speake or write to them that are encumbred with many weightie affaires. I trust it shall not repent you to steale as it were, some houres from them to the per∣using of this worthy Epistle; it being as a Christall glasse where∣in we may behold the natures of our Saviour Christ, his Offices, Kingdome, Priesthood, and Prophesie, as likewise the hand that apprehendeth and applieth him to us, which is faith, as also hope and charity, the necessary fruits and effects of faith.
Thus J humbly take my leave, commending your Lord∣ship to the High and Eternall God.
From East Bergholt in Suffolk.
