TAke it as you please you Al∣mighty makers of Beggers, you pro∣uokers of Theeues

and encreasers of Vagabōds; I, I my selfe, old Christ∣mas (without feare or flattery, pro∣claimes your base entertainment, are you all turn'd Fox∣fur'd, Goldfinches Wolues, Cormo∣rants, Caterpil∣lers, & Curmud∣geans? Hath the diuel & the world so besotted and bewitched you, that you will wil∣fully spend your dayes miserably, to end your liues detestedly? will you liue poore to dye rich? will you empty your con∣sciences, to fill your bagges? and will you pinch your bellies to starue yoursoules? Hee that should haue told mee for

fiue hundred yeares ago, that Christmas and Hospitalitie should haue bin thus vnregarded and sleighted, I shold haue held him for a lying Prophet, and a false Prognosti∣cator. Oh mad and brutish age, wherein the a∣uarice of one is the preiudice of thousands; when the Coach eates vp the Cart, the Backe robs the Belly, when the Perfumes, crew∣els, cullisses and the Castingbot∣tle, makes a warme Cham∣ber and a cold Kitchin; Know you thick skin'd Hide-bound

Chuffes, that you are hared of God & men, yea your owne childrē or heires (for whom you rake and ra∣uine) doe in∣wardly curse & hate you, and know, that what most vilely you get ouer the di∣uels backe, your inheritours will as wickedly spend vnder his Dammes belly. What a shame it is (if you had the grace to see it) that you shold giue your mindes to liue vpon the vnna∣turall lecherie and engendring of money, that all the meate you eate in your

owne houses is the accursed spawnes of op∣pression, extor∣tion, bribery, and insatiat couetous∣nes: and yet some of you keepe no houses at all, but pinch your owne and your families guttes at home, when at other mens boords you are tirants, where you turne the old custome backe∣ward, and instead of keeping Christ∣mas, you (like droues) make Christmas keepe you; but take it for a warning, let me not finde it so the next yeere; for if I do, I will send you such guests as shall ne∣uer forsake you;

as the Dropsie, Gout, collick, the Stone, & the like kinde tokens of my iust anger, which you shall receiue as most worthy & deser∣ued New-yeeres-guifts.
