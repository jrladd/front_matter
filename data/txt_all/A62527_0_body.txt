Honoured Sir,
I Can never tell the World how much I owe you, Natures ac∣count is much but that of Grace is more: you have me on both in eternall obligations bound as yours. Rich and free grace all powerfull love, through your selfe as the instrument, Gave me my true, my best, my lasting, I meane my spiri∣tuall being, the forme of Christ in mee.
Not Fami∣listically. Sir I blesse God for Himselfe, his Sonne, his Spi∣rit, his Gospell, your selfe. What cause Sir have I to blesse God for you? you have begotten, nouresht, brought me up as your own Sonne in the Gospell. I will not like Jacob pluck my Brother by the heele. Who ever were the first; I blesse God I was not the last of your first
fruits in Tavestocke Devon. Sir I am a plant of your planting, watering and a mem∣ber, and a Minister in the Church of Christ. unworthy of either, (but blessed be God for both) who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof, I send you here a cluster, I would they were either faire or ripe: they are yet too greene for your tast: however they are the first fruits from a slip of your owne. I beg your Acceptance, I am sure of your protection — what I am and have is yours, blessed be God, that I have the honour to sub∣scribe

Abingdon Octob. 3. 1651.
