Worthy Sir,
TO this Trea∣tise I have chosen you Patron, whom I could never yet come to know in Person, upon my great acquain∣tane, besides neere al∣liance, both with your
Grand-Father, & Fa∣ther.
I hope you will re∣ceive it no otherwise from me, then as a sure, though meane, token of my readiness, in all Christian offices to serve both you, and yours, for their sakes; and continual thanke∣full remembrance of the Family, from whence, under God, my truely learned, and Religious Father de∣rived
his first being. In which respects I humbly present it to you.
The Lord streng∣then the hearts, and hands of all those that favour the good of Jsrael: more especi∣ally settle and inlarge his blessings upon you, and your poste∣rity; that you may all do worthily in Ephra∣tah, and be famous in Bethlehem: that you
may be on earth, in∣struments of his glory, to the good of his Church: so shall you be vessels of glory in the kingdome of hea∣ven. The which is his daily prayer who is,
Worthy Sir,
