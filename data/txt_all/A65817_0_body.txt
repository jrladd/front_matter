THE Shunamite was so great a Favourite to the Prophet Elisha, that he commanded his Servant to ask her if he should speak for her to the Captain of the Host. I not being so much the Favou∣rite of any that hath familiar access to your Lordship, make a

bold address of this little private Piece to your Favour and Incou∣ragement, without any Prolocu∣tor or Master of Ceremonies to introduce it: presuming that your Lordship, the Captain of our Host, (who think it, except I be deceived, not only the Ho∣nour, but incouragement of their Gown to follow you) would not reject the good Intentions, how defective soever, of one that hath had his Education for several Years in the Honourable Society of the Inner-Temple (which may truly with many other Wor∣thies, boast you their Member) when your Lordship did then preside. But, my Lord, there

is not only this in the matter: for if I have done ill, in addressing this to your Lordship against Mr. Hobbes his Leviathan (in all things past over by your Noble Predecessor my Lord of Clarendon, as ridiculous in themselves and not worthy of his Pen, he intending as I sup∣pose only to Answer his Civil Politics) I may plead this a lit∣tle in my excuse: First, That your Lordship accidentally gave me the incouragement of the un∣dertaking, for that (amongst other things I have had the happiness both in private and public to Learn of your Lord∣ship) once you Taught me as

well as the rest of your nume∣rous Auditors (when the pre∣sent Lord Chief Iustice of England was called to be Iudge of the Common Pleas) that it was not only the duty of every good Man but of every wise Man to indeavour the sup∣port of the Government he was protected by. Whereupon, my Lord, I having (after many re∣peated Discourses and particu∣larly of Learned and excellent Divines of the impiety of this Book) got a sight of it, and being as much surprised with the obliquity of it as the Queen of Sheba (may I make Sacred contraries my illustration) was

with the Wisdom of Solomon: I perceived that that which I heard was not half, that was true, either in respect of Mr. Hobbes his indeavours to sup∣plant all true and faithful Sub∣jection and also Property (both which as I apprehend ought to be equally Sacred in their bounds both to King and People for their mutual preservation) or in regard of his damnable Opi∣nions concerning God and Reli∣gion mixt with a Mahome∣tan indeavour, by ill words, to supplant the greatest part of Ci∣vil Learning: I thought I could not better imploy part of a very long Vacation, it now being more

than usually seasonable to ex∣press my Affection to the Go∣vernment I have so long lived peaceably under, then to make it manifest to the World (to pre∣vent future mistakes in that matter) that under the name of Leviathan are couched the most horrid and execrable opini∣ons that were ever suffered to see the light in any Christian Kingdom, and only fit to make one upon the holiday of the Hangman: and importing so many Errors and Blasphemies against God and the King, and so much tending to the extirpa∣tion of all sense of Religion out of the minds of Men (which is

the basis of Government) that I thought the forementioned saying of your Lordship, which sharpned my undertaking, might in the se∣cond place a little intitle me to a submissive claim of your defence not only by your Eloquence but Power: especially you being, Sir, so great and high in the fa∣vour of your Great and Royal Master, and so much intrusted by him with the affairs of Church and State, both which, if I take right measures, have in times of danger approved you their friend: and no wonder, Sir, since your high and gene∣rous Education as well as Con∣verse in great Affairs cannot

but have Instructed you in the on∣ly and infallible Remedy against the inroads of the People their greatest danger (to wit) the keeping up and within the bulwarks of the Law, which I have seldom seen any Man (and hope I never shall) attempt a breach upon, but that he hath proved the rubbish of his inten∣ded ruins; and how it will at last fare with the Leviathan, Mr. Hobbes I know not, for I trust your Lordship when you have perused this little piece will say, There is not his like upon all the Earth. Which I shall without more (knowing how tedious prolixity is to your

Lordship) refer to your great Learning and Wisdom, and on∣ly beg pardon for the adventure of the subscription and intitling my self,
Your Lordships Most constant and obedient servant
