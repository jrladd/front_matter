RIGHT Honourable, and therefore Honourable, be∣cause truly Right, not only a lover, and practiser, but a faithfull defendar of right. But that which makes your fame singugular, is that this vertue in you is so ge∣nerall, that where as all men are by nature, encli∣ned to seeke their owne right, your Honour hath engaged, both your Life and Estate, to mainetaine the right of others, yea the right of our King and Country, nay which is most transcendent, the right & safety of Gods cause; which is now, by unhappie occasion, in danger to suffer violence. And in this your uprightnesse of heart, in defence of the right of your case, you have hitherto done so rightly and Nobly, that it cannot appeare in the least part, that the fairest professers of reward, nor the fow∣lest
threatnings of revenge, could either draw or drive you to so much as slack your Impartiall hand in these your pious proceedings, much lesse to betray your trust: nor hath envie it selfe, the least moate to cast into you dish, which (Noble Earle) is now more rare then over; Europ being now in travill, to cast some poison into every dish, that is presented on the table of our distempered State, and n doubt hath often abusd your Honorable presence in presenting great and grosse Malignants, in disguised habits. And as this to the eie of the world, and to your Eternall praise, doth render you truely Honourable; so it doth happily declare, the happinesse we injoy by injoying so happie, so vi∣gilant, and so successefull a governour, as your Honourable selfe is, under whom, through the blessing of God, we in these associated Counties, may more truly say, then Turtellius did to Felix we enjoy much quietness: And seeing by your Honour, worthy deeds are done for your Country we except it with all thankefulnesse, and alacri∣ty of spirit; being bound to blesse God, for such a blessing upon us, and not to cease praying that you may ride on and prosper. Now right Honourable, amongst other these your deep engaged servants, I the most unworthy of the least of your favours, have notwithstanding, presuming on your Cle∣mency, dared to shelter these my deformed shad∣dows, under the wings of your protecting substance, yet (Noble Earle) no farther then they may be ca∣paple of favour, but if in any thing I have erred,
I am there at your pleasure, to be corrected. Now in this mishapen picture, I have laboured to offer to your view, and so to the eye of the world, the most deformed forme of our nations, now most mi∣serably miserable estate; out of which tis possible, that your piercing cie may pick somewhat, that may be usefull; but if not, I beseech your Honour to resolve, that my intents herein are honest, and the contents (if we make no other use of them) may at the least tend to our humiliation; they being no other then a glasse, wherin we may see our sinns, reflecting upon our selves: and in our present mi∣series, read our foregoing offences: but not any way presuming to instruct, nor too farr to trouble your Honour with trifles, I cease in this kind, to be any farther tedious, humbly begging pardon for this my intrusion, and I shall for ever hold it my happinesse to heare of your prosperity; which in spight of all your enemies, the God of all good successe, crowne your Honour with, as he hath be∣gun. So prayes
