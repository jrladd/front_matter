A King put in a baser weeede,
And brought vnto your Princely view,
Some man that may misdeem the deed,
And doubt some danger to ensue,
Will say that no disguise is good
For Kings, or for the Royall blood.
But, Sir, by blessed proofe we finde
Cloathes change the man, but not the minde.


With Him Heau'ns darling then aduise,
Who, though disguis'd, will not disguise.



Descended first of Kingly blood,
Bequeath'd since to your royall race,
More humbly-bold in hope I stood
Of entertainment with your Grace.
And though disroab'd by this am knowne,
I sing Iehouahs name alone.
