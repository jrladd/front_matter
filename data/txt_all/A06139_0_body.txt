ROscius the Romane Tragedian (most noble Prince) contending with Cicero the Orator, which of them both should perswade most people, either Roscius with his motions, and gestures of his body; or Cicero with varietie, and copy of his tongue. This hath been in ex∣ercise in Greece much vsed; and now in Rome more: but of such motions and gestures of men, that can speake with their hands, with their eies, with their shoulders, and with their feet, Salomon bids vs to take heed, that will speake like Aristippus to Dionisius heeles.
Such were they that held their heads on the left side, like King Philip of Macedon, while Philip liued: such were they after Philip, that like Alexander his Sonne with their bushes and standing haires, would be called Opistho∣comae, because Alexander was so, & now too many such, like the Courtiers of Meroe in Ethiope, where if their King halt, they will also halt, in such sort, that Cirses and Calipso could not make such a Metamorphosis of Vlisses men, as men make of themselues.
There was then in Rome but one bird that was taught to say, Aue Caesar Imperator: one bird in Carthage to say, Deus est hanno: and one bird in all Greece, that was taught to say, : but not onely these flatte∣ring fowles fledde from Rome, from Carthage, and from Greece, to Great Britane; of whom we may now say, as Ci∣cero said then of the like, Quibus credamus, nescimus.
But also of late such Rauens and Vultures, that salute vs with their tongues, and say, Aue; and with their hearts, Caue, which if their bodies were opened, as the Atheni∣ans did Aristomenes, or as the Lacedemonians did Her∣mogenes, their hearts should bee found, as their hearts were, pilosa & hispida, full of haires and thornes.
In the time of Torquine the proud, there was in Rome but one Serpent that could bark like a dogge, and one dogge that could speake like a man, but now so many barking Ser∣pents in Rome, & so many speaking dogs out of Rome, that, Quos fugiamus, ignoramus.
But such are the fruits of some religion, that as then in Egypt, they had their Sphinxes in their temples, to ex∣pound their darke and obscure Diuinitie full of Oracles: so now they haue in Rome, not onely Egyptian Sphinxes in their temples, but also Corinthian Sphinxes in their stu∣dies, such as Cicero charged Hortensius to haue in his house to plead his causes.
But as then many Philosophers went from Greece to India, and to Ethiope, to see Sacerdotes solis, and the most famous table of the Son, in Sabulo, and to heare Hiarchas lectures of the nature and motions of the starres, and of Tantalus well. So also many now goe from Great Bri∣tane to Rome, not as Appollonius the Philosopher went from Greece to India, to heare the Gymnosophists: but as Saul went from Hierusalem to Damasco, for commissi∣on and authoritie to kill and murther Christians, and to persecute Kingdomes, and Countreys.
