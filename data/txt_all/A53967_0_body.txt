Gentlemen,
WHEN you Requested of me to Preach before you at your Solemn Meeting, I thought my self Obliged to Answer your desires, by that Natural Affection I bear to my Native Coun∣trey, and by those Respects I owe to all my Coun∣trey men, and particularly to your selves.
And having received Payment of that Debt which was due on my part, you will acknowledge, I presume, that you have contracted a Debt to me, by prevailing with me to Expose the Sermon to the view of a Censorious World; for a strong

Obligation lyeth upon you to Defend that, which now you have made your Own.
The Design and Scope of this following Dis∣course is, to encourage Men to be Heartily and Firmly Loyal: A Lesson, which though some are pleased to Despise, others to be Incensed at, and many now a days care not to hear of, yet is so ab∣solutely Necessary to be taught, that the King∣dom cannot prosper, nor the Government stand, nor Christianity it self be duly practis'd without it.
If this Discourse serveth to Contribute any thing hereunto, I have obtained my Ends, and am only to desire your kind Acceptance thereof from

Decemb. 2d. 1682.
