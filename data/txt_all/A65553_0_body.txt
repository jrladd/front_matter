May it please Your GRACE,
I Have presumed to In∣title Your Grace to this small Piece, not out of con∣ceit of its Merits, but sense of mine own Obligations. People use to pay their debts as they are able; and when All they can do is in effect Nothing, to have publickly
 acknowledged themselves In∣solvent, is, to have aimed at being Just.
May then Your GRACE please to Accept of my having intended well, both in the Book and Dedication: And to believe amongst the Numerous Votaries to Your Illustrious Self and Family, he who brings only this mite of Gratitude, has as much Zeal to approve his full Duty, and as industri∣ously watches opportuni∣ty to do so, as any man li∣ving.
