SIr: hauing long requested▪
after a Gentlwoman of good
note, one Mistris Cogitations, I
was aduisd by an extrauagant
fellow (that Pretended to know much) to
goe to the signe of the parret in lither lane,
for there he saide she had a Chamber: thi∣ther
I went, and found one of that name in∣deed,
to whome I tendred this little re∣membrance
of my good will and seruice:
She, (whose accouterment, countenance,
and conditions, was fitly resembled by her
Signe,) had scarse read my Title, but she
began to tattle, and after a scornfull and
malcontent manner, threw my booke at
me, and bade me be packing and take the
Knaues with me.
Being thus mistaken, (and studying what
course was best to be taken) I was ouertak∣en
by a good fellow of my acquaintance

(well knowne to your Worship) hard by
the Rose and Crowne to whome I impar∣ted
my minde, and how I sped with mi∣stris
Parrat: he laught and said hast thou
forgot our two ould acquaintance, good∣will,
and Il-vill? why man (quoth he)
thou shouldst haue asked for mistris good
Cogitations: she keeps house in Loue-lane:
also she hath a lodging in such a mans
house, (meaning your worships) by whom
thou maist haue accesse to her: Thus
thanking my remembrance for his kind∣nes,
I am bould (Presuming on your wor∣ships
good acceptance) to render this
small remembrance of my good will,
to your good Cogitations:
And rest.
