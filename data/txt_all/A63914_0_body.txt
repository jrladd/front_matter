My Lord,
THis Sermon, which for the great seasonableness of the Subject of it, I think it my Duty to Pub∣lish at this time, it being Preached, as it fell out, but just the day before His Majesty was pleased to signifie His Gracious Resolution, to allow Liberty of Con∣science to all his loving Subjects of what Denomination soever: I do humbly beseech your Lordship to Accept and Patronize, as you do the Author; and give me leave at once to pay a very small and inconsiderable Acknowledg∣ment for many the most signal and obliging Favors, and to shelter so lovel y,so useful, and so excellent a Vertue un∣der the shady Patronage of so great a Person, whose Name and Authority, will at the same time render it more Charming to its Friends, and make it appear so formida∣ble to its Enemies, that it will constrain and force them into its own resemblance, and cause them to Abase and Humble themselves before it.

But besides the plain suitableness of the Discourse to the Juncture, Humility and Charity, being the only ex∣pedients that can make Liberty safe, or Toleration a to∣lerable thing, by preventing those Quarrels and Animo∣sities that arise from different sentiments in Religious matters. Besides my own particular and personal Obli∣gations, which I cannot think of without shame, when I consider how little I deserve them; there is also a Con∣gruity in the Subject of my Sermon, to your Lordships Person, which seems to me to challenge and single you out for a Patron, without asking any leave but from the Na∣ture of things, I mean those Natural effects of this in∣comparable Vertue which I have recommended, which flow so easily, so unaffectedly from you, with so much Beau∣ty and Brightness, with so much Strength and Vigor, and with so constant and uninterrupted a Stream, in the sweetness and affability of your Conversation, even a∣mong your Inferiors and Dependants, in the easiness of Access in the midst of so much Greatness, the Quick∣ness, the Justice, the Sagacity of dispatch in so impor∣tunate a crowd of Business, all which would be certain and infallible Indications at once of a Generous and Composed Mind, a Great and Lofty, and yet an Humble Spirit, though they were not, as they are, attended with a peculiar proneness to Forgive the most implacable and mortal Enemies, of which your Lordship hath given such convincing Proofts, that this alone might be sufficient, with out that universal Merit, which even Envy and Detracti¦on cannot help allowing you, to recommend you Powerfully to the Favor of a Prince, in whom Mercy is Hereditary, and Majesty is by Nature temper'd with Pity and Com∣passion, to render it more easie and familiar to his Peo∣ple: But there is likewise the Justice and Integrity, the Constancy and Courage, the Diligence and Assiduity, the Wisdom and the Condut of your Actions, that have con∣curr'd
 and club'd with a kind and obliging Temper, to ren∣der you truly Great, and make you an Object worthy the Esteem of two the most Judicious and Discerning Kings that ever sat upon the English Throne.
And, my Lord, it is another genuine Effect of that ad∣mirable Vertue which is the Glorious Theme of the ensuing Papers, that it makes its way to Greatness, as your Lord∣ship hath done, not by Popularity and mischievous In∣trigues, to the Danger, if not Ruin of the publick Peace, but only by just Actions and honorable Designs, and like your Great Master, whom Providence had a mind to shew how much it loved, by the Protection of a weakly Bark, when the Royal Oak was unable to defend Him, you Ventured, Suffered, and Escaped a Shipwreck, and made a costly Sacrifice of your Hopes and Fortunes to the publick Good, before your entrance upon that Scene of Honor in which you now shine, with so much the greater Brightness, for having first suffered so Glorious an E∣clipse; by this means shewing at once, the difference be∣twixt your Enemies and you, and verifying our Saviours never failing Promise to all his Faithful Followers and Disciples, that whosoever Exalteth himself, by Base, Dishonorable, and Ʋnworthy Means, the same shall be Abased, and he that Humbleth himself shall be Exalted.
For Humility, my Lord, is the true way to Greatness; it is not a Poltron and a sneaking Disposition, as its Name may seem unjustly to Insinuate; but it implies Magnanimity and Courage at the same time, by looking backward upon God, and inwards upon it Self, and for∣wards upon the Hope and Expectation of a future Life; it acquires an habitual Sense and Sympathy of Human Frailty, a Pity and Compassion for Human want and ne∣cessity, an universal Candor, Integrity and Ingenuity, in all its Words and Actions, and Designes, a warm in∣clination to promote the good of its Country, and the hap∣piness
 of Mankind, an admiration of God, and a desire to be like him, and a scorn of every thing that is unhand∣some or unjust. It cannot revenge its own wrongs upon the Public, it cannot embarrass or embroil the World upon a principle of Private Interest; it cannot climb to Greatness upon the ruins of Justice, though it would ne∣ver so fain, but it still meets with something that pulls it strongly back, and rewards all Ambition with regret and pain, but what is noble, and useful, and serviceable to the World, and is an Instinct of the Divinity in Human Nature, to prompt it, when fair Opportunities present themselves, to great Atchievements and generous Ʋnder∣takings; it Ascends by the Steps of Chancery into the Temple of Honor, and from the Pinacle of that lofty Structure, it Surveys the whole Extent and Circumfe∣rence of things; and will not fall down to Worship a mean design, to Purchase all the Prospect that it Views.
But, my Lord, I grow troublesome with too much length; and therefore if what I have said, may not be allow'd to be Apology sufficient, for the hardiness of this Address, I shall only beg, that what I cannot Justifie, you would please to Pardon; and with my Prayers to God for your Lordships Health and Happiness, and encrease of Ho∣nor. I am, may it it please your Lordship,
