SIR, the ancient ememy to learning
(ignorance) hath left off his old li∣uerye,
russet Ierkins & leather hose,
& to deceiue the world (like Esops
Asse in a Lions skin) thrusts in him
selfe sometimes like a Gentleman, sometime, like
a souldiour, & sometimes like a Lawyer, and like
Catterpillers at the springe, bites off blossomes of
Trees and corruptes the buddes of flowers; And
although the young fruites of my labours grewe
not by the banks of Hellicon, nor were euer wa∣tred
at Aganippies welles; yet (simple as they are)
loath I was a greate while, to turne them abroad
into the world, without armour against this ene∣my,
and almost in dispaire: I was by a Gentleman
your Woorships wel-willer and my very good
freind, perswaded to shrowde these simple lynes

vnder your shadow, who being your selfe dayly
conuersant in the histories of ancient times, are
alwayes willing & ready to countenance & sup∣port
the poore remnants of depressed learning
that are left for our times, would like the seauen
folde shield of Aiax retort such dartes to them,
that throw them, whereupon I am bolde to pre∣sume
vpon your Wor. fauour for my defence,
which I doubt not but to find, and when more
leasure, giues liberty to my penne, I will inde∣uour
painfully to requite this curtesie which so
impudently I now craue.
