OH! whom may I thee style, most glorious King
Or to thy worth what names can worship bringâ–ª
A Romulus in conduct may'st thou be,
Camillus in vnconquered honestie.
In courage thou art great Achilles peere,
In counsell Nestors, farre from Nestors yeere:
In th'on-set Alexander, one would deeme thee,
In constant valour, Caesar I esteeme thee.
In martiall skill a Scipio thou art,
An Hannibal in stratageme and art.
All Wonders thou exceed'st of elder age,
Which Greece, or Rome, hath left vpon times stage.
Mars with Astraea thou alone dost crowne,
Fury with Faith, Sword with Law, Armes with Gown.
If thus the ravening Tyrants thou represse,
And galled neckes from slavish yoke release:
If (justice strange!) thou part the rescued prey,
To each his owne, purloyning nought away:
Of foes if willing Subjects thou create,
By conquest bettered in their Faith and State;
Let Thracia be thy pay, for Almaine free'd,
For Faith restored Rome, shall be thy meed:
Let Heaven poynt at thy birth, serue in thy warres,
And blaze thy holy Armes with new-borne starres:
Be thou the oppressed's Shield, the poores reliefe,
The Saints good Angel, and Christ's Herauld chiefe,
Tremble yee guiltie Tyrants to come on,
Vpon the Sword of Christ and Gideon.
