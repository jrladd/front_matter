SIR,
PIctures, which re∣late to a Family, are usually exposed

in Galleries, that the Heir by looking on them, may not only see the Features, but read too the Vertues and generous Ex∣ploits of his truly No∣ble Ancestors. This Pi∣cture of my Lord, your Fathers Journey in∣to Turky (whom you have so lively coppi'd in your early Travels abroad) I humbly

present at your Feet, being sure it will have a choice place in the Gallery of your Mind, since the Ori∣ginal it self (which extracts admiration from all) will doubt∣less as highly deserve of Posterity, as any of your greatest Proge∣nitours.
Here without the Wind of Adulation,

I might tow down the Stream of my Lord your Fathers Quali∣ties, and excellent En∣dowments, but re∣membring that you two only differ in time, I shall but say this (least I seem to flatter you) that you are most happy in your Father, and your Father as happy in you.
May your Hap∣piness like the Danube (which in its long passage through Ty∣role, Bavaria, Au∣stria, and Hungary, receives thirty Na∣vigable Rivers, e're it falls into the Sea) increase all along in the course of your Life, till it come to be as great, as to your Noble Self, and your

Family, the devotion is of,
SIR,
