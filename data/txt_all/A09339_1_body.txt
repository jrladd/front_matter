RIght Honourable, if you consider what is one of the chiefest orna∣ments of this Noble state, vnto which God hath aduanced you: it wil appeare, that there is none more excellent then Zach. 12.12. the spirit of grace and prayer. For what doth your heart affect? would you speake the languages? Behold, by prayer you may speak the most heauenly tongue that euer was, Esa. 9.12 Rom. 15.6 e∣uen the language of Canaan. Would you haue the valor of knighthood? By prayer you may stand in place where Gods hande hath  23. psal. 59.16 made a breach, and doe as much as 2. king. 2. all the chariots and horsmen in a kingdom. Would you inioy Gods blessings which you wāt? By praier you may (as it were) put your hand in∣to the cofers of Gods treasures Matth. 7.7. & inrich your selfe. Doe you desire the fauour of Monarks and Princes? By praier you may come in pre∣sence and haue speech with Iehova the king of heauen and earth. Lastly, would you know, whether now liuing you be dead, that beeing

dead you may liue for euer? By prayer a man may knowe, whether hee bee dead to sinne, dead to the world, liue to God, liue to Christ and liue eternally.
Prayer then, beeing so excellent a point of Religion: I am imboldened to commend this small treatise to your Honour: not so much for it selfe, as because it doth set out the matter and true manner of inuocation of Gods holy name. And I hope for your fauour in accep∣ting of it, the rather, because I doubt not but your desire is to be answerable to your most honourable, & for religion most worthy an∣cestors, in the care of maintaining and coun∣tenancing any good thing that may any way serue for the furtherīg of the gospel of Christ.
Nowe Iesus Christ our Lord, and God e∣uen the Father which hath loued vs, & giuen vs euerlasting consolation, and good hope through grace, stablish your Honour in eue∣ry good word and worke to the end.
