RIGHT Honourable:
All that I can say for my
selfe is a desire of dooing
good; which if it were
as feruent in richer hearts, that Church
which now we see comely, would then be
glorious: this honest ambition hath car∣ried
me to neglect the feare of seeming
prodigall of my little: and while I see o∣thers
talents resting in the earth, hath

drawne me to traffick with mine in pub∣lique.
I hope no aduenture that euer I
made of this kind shall bee equally gain∣full
to this my present labour, wherein I
take Gods owne history for the ground,
and worke vpon it by what meditations
my weakenesse can afford. The diuine∣nes
of this subiect shall make more then
amends for the manifold defects of my
discourse; although also the blame of an
imperfection is so much the more when
it lighteth vpon so high a choice. This
part which I offer to your Lordship shall
shew you Pharaoh impotently enuious
and cruell, the Israelites of friends be∣come
slaues, punished onely for prospe∣ring;
Moses in the weeds, in the court,
in the desert, in the hill of visions; a
Courtier in Aegypt, a shepheard in Mi∣dian,
an Ambassador from God, a lea∣der
of Gods people, and when you see the

prodigious variety of the plagues of Ae∣gypt
you shall not know whether more
to wonder at the miracles of Moses, or
Pharaohs obstinacy. Finally, you shall
see the same waues made both a wall &
a gulfe in one boure; the Aegyptians
drowned, where no Israelite was wet∣shod;
and if these passages yeeld not a∣bundance
of profitable thoughts, impute
it (not without pardon) to the pouerty of
my weake conceit; which yet may per∣haps
occasion better vnto others. In all
humble submission I commend them
(what they are) to your Lordships fa∣uourable
acceptation, and your selfe
with them, to the gratious blessing of
our God.
