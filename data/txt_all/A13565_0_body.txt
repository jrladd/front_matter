NExt vnto the infinite mercie of almightie God (most gracious Soue∣raigne) we haue to thanke your Ma∣iestie that we liue, not onelie this short and transitorie life, which is but a passage vnto death: but so to liue, that we may die to liue for euermore. For what other assurance haue we of eternall life, but to die in the true faith of Ie∣sus Christ: of the which, whosoeuer maketh wracke, it cannot bee but hee must perrish euerlastinglie. Howe mi∣serablie we haue beene tossed on the sourges of schismes & deuisions, howe sore we haue beene ouerwhelmed with the waues of heresies, and ouerflowen with the floods of Ido∣latrie and superstition, howe vnnaturallie we haue beene carried away from our dutifull allegeance, and howe mi∣raculously we haue beene brought home againe: your Ma. in viewing this short discourse that followeth, in part may vnderstand. And since it hath pleased God to conuert vs vnto his trueth, and your highnes to pardon our offences and trecheries passed, we can not doubt, but behauing our selues like true and perfect paenitents vnto almighty God, and dutifull Subiects vnto your highnes: You will vouch∣safe
 to protect vs for the time to come, against all our ene∣mies and aduersaries whomsoeuer. Jn hope whereof, wee haue presumed to present your Maiestie (as a Newe yeeres gift) the first fruites of our repentaunce, beseeching God so to endue vs with the gift of perseueraunce, that we may fructifie better for the time to come. And thus bee∣ing loth to offende your Maiestie with manie words, most humbly crauing pardon for this that wee haue doone, wee ende with our humble and hartie prayers, that your Ma∣iestie may long liue and raigne ouer vs, to the setting forth and aduauncing of Gods most holie worde, comfort and consolation of all good Christians, and confusion of Antechrist and all his adhaerents, where∣vnto vnfainedlie we saie Amen.
