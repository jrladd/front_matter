LIfe (saith the Philosopher) is but a borrowed dreame of pleasure, a visi∣on of delight, a pageant of transitory happinesse, and Death is a Harbinger of eternitie, a bringer of felicitie, a Messen∣ger of glory; it is a pyrat of life, and yet a pilot to life, a conductor to the heauenly hauen of blisse, the Angell to keepe Para∣dise, wherein none enters but by the en∣trance of his fatall sword. Sith therefore (ô Death) thou art the Groome-porter to let out life, and let in life, the remoouer (as Aeschilus calleth thee) of worldly sorrows, the deliuerer (as Cicero saith) of troubled mindes, the laylor which art content with the fees of our life, to set our Soules at li∣bertie, I heere inuite and welcome thee to the loathsome banquet of my body, fat thy
pale cheekes with the cates of my life, and glut thy hungry appetite with my vitall spirits, onely doe me this fauour, that I may say my Grace at this last supper, and then sit downe vpon my dying bed, and drinke vp the sweet drop of sower life, and the scraps, and dead bones of my body, and carkasse of my flesh take away, and keepe thē in the doomsday house, vntil my Soule by the liuely wings of faith, descending frō heauen at the generall resurrection, be v∣nited one to another, and there enioy an endlesse age of pleasures, to the which (ô Death) soone bring mee, that I may say to the VVorldes misery, which I say to thee, farewell.
 Tu nil rescribas, attamen ipse veni.
