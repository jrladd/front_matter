MY good Lord, in respect of some fa∣uors from you re∣ceiued, as also in regard of the du∣tious affection I beare you, I am bolde to present you and

your Ladie with this little remembrance, though simple and small in shew, yet of inesti∣mable valew in substance. Ingra∣titude is the most abiect sinne in the worlde, and caniustly chal∣lenge no excuse for it selfe, bee it in how great or meane persons soeuer: And therefore least my selfe should therewith bee tain∣ted, hauing found such extraor∣dinarie gentlenesse both in you and my good Ladie your wife, I haue made a learned and di∣uine French man my interces∣sour, to tell you in rude English, that I forget not such fauours.
And the rather made I choice of his furtherance heerin, be∣cause

on good Fryday last, your Honour with the rest of your Brethrē, heard at Paules Crosse, a verie learned Sermon tending to this purpose, I meane the crosse, death, & passion of Christ Iesus, which iumping so neere with this Argument, and well worthie to be continued in re∣membrance: I could finde no fitter meanes for the same, then this most excellent and learned French Treatise, which handles both the sacred vertue of the crosse, and also what worshippe ought to be giuen thereto.
I beseech you my good Lord and Lady, when leisure from weightie occasions vvill so per∣mit

it, that you would but vouchsafe this Treatise the rea∣ding: happily you shall finde somewhat therein well worthie noting, and I hope vvithall, the true sinceritie of my affection toward you, which being but so found, and by you as kindly ac∣cepted, I shall remaine alvvaies yours for any further imploye∣ment, be it euen to the vttermost of all my endeuours.
