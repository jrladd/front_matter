My LORD,
THE Nobless being as great in Mind as Birth, have in all Ages espoused Virtue and Learning, as the supporters of their Families, and out of generous inclinations to acts of Honour and Justice, have always encouraged the Republick of Learning, in rewarding the Professors of Arts and Sciences with their Favour and Fortune;
This Sheet to be placed before Folio 197. Whereupon I have taken the
boldness to address my Self to your Lordship, as a Person of high Honour and Ingenuity, that you would be pleased to entertain these Anatomical Essays with all Candor, and grant them a favourable Pardon, as well as an honourable Pa∣tronage. I cannot be so much wanting to my self, as to be fondly conceited, that my mean Sentiments can add any thing to your more mature Knowledge.
And now my Lord, although the Products of my Studious Endeavours do freely run toward you, as to a Sanctuary, and make no apology for their application to your Lordship, as having the confidence that your Good and Generous Inclinati∣ons are pleased with any Emanation of great Duty and Af∣fection.
I Present your Lordship with a Bel-visto of the parts of a Humane Body, consisting of many Membranes (being cu∣rious contextures of nervous Filaments) us so many fine Walls encircling the inward and noble parts (being rare Compages of various kinds of vessels) as so many Colatories of the Blood, subservient to the most active flame of Life.
In this fine prospect of the exterior and interior parts of Man's Body, (illustrated with many beautiful Schemes) you may view, after a manner, as in a Glass, the elegant frame of your own Body, consisting of great variety of parts, set together in admirable order, giving a great grace to your Person, adorned with a most pleasant Aspect, good Mind, free
and significant Language, as so many clear expresses of your more noble temper, full of all Civility and Kindness, with which you Treat Strangers, as well as Friends, who have the Honour to converse with your Lordship. Your Lordships sweet Deportment, and graceful Elocution, are accompanied with greater Excellencies of Mind, quickness of Apprehension, and more profound Judgment, making greater inquiry into the first Causes and Nature of things.
And your Lordshiop is not only highly valuable in your self, but as descending too from a most truly Noble Lord your Father, most accomplished with excellent Intellectuals, and Morals, as a Person of eminent Learning, Loyalty, Tem∣perance, Justice, Piety, Charity, and Hospitality, in which his Lordship was a great Rule and Copy for other Personages of Honor to transcribe and imitate.
I cannot but congratulate your great Happiness, in your accomplished Lady, a Noble Personage of high Perfections, (speaking her Descent from most Honourable Parents, no∣bled with most illustrious Virtues) who hath brought you a hopeful Progeny, full of Ingeny, and Ingenuity, who I hope will perpetuate your Name and Memory from age to age, till time be swallowed up in Eternity.
I again take the freedom to present you with my Mite of Experimental Phylosophy, which I promise to my self will have a fair Reception and Interpretation from your Lord∣ship;
and I hope will not prove altogether useless, and imper∣tinent, as giving you some sparks to enkindle your more Learned and Digested Thoughts; Pray give me your Par∣don, and accept of this Dedication as a Token of most Hum∣ble Duty and Gratitude from
My LORD,
