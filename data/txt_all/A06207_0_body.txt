WORTHY SIR,
I Present, or rather returne vnto your view, that which formerly hath beene receiued from you, hereby effecting what you did desire: To commend the worke in my vnlearned method, were rather to detract from it, then to giue it any luster. It sufficeth it hath your Worships ap∣probation and patronage, to the commendation of the Authors, and incouragement of their fur∣ther labours: and thus wholy committing my selfe and it to your Worships dispose I rest, euer readie to doe you seruice, not onely in the like, but in what J may.
