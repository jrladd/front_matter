Gentlemen,
BEing about to Publish this Sermon, I
could not bethink my self how to make
a more seasonable Dedication of it,
than to You All: being you are e∣qually
concerned, both as to Your Sacred, and
Civil Interest, to maintain that greatest of Pri∣viledges
which Herein I have endeavoured to
defend. That the Well-being of this Church
and Kingdom depends upon this, Every one
knows; and I hope, we need not be admonished
to look to the Corner-Stone. What it is that
some Men would have, God Almighty only, and
Themselves (if Themselves) do know: however
it is to be wished, that whilst They are decrying
of Ours (without doubt the Best of Govern∣ments)

for Tyranny, Oppression, and Po∣pery,
They be not buoying of These up in the
World, and bringing of Them in (which God
avert) under the Mask of Faction.
May the Great GOD of Heaven and
Earth say Amen to this Sermon, and Crown
these mean Essays; by making of all Those,
whom Nature hath made, and the Law of
Nations declared, His Majesties Subjects,
truly Loyal. Which, as it is the hearty
Prayer, so shall it be the sincere and perpetual
Endeavour of,
Gentlemen,
