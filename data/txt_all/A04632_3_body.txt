SIr, A thankefull man owes a courtesie euer: the vnthanke∣full, but when he needes it. To make mine owne marke appeare, and shew by which of these seales I am known, I send you this peece of what may liue of mine; for whose innocence, as for the Authors, you were once a noble and timely vndertaker, to the greatest Iustice of this kingdome. Enioy now the delight of your good∣nesse; which is to see that prosper, you preseru'd: and posteritie to owe the reading of that, without offence, to your name; which so much ignorance, and malice of the times, then conspir'd to haue supprest.
