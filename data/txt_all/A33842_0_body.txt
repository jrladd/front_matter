Most Dread Sovereign,
THE deep sense we have had of the great Dangers your Majesties Sacred Person has been in, and the great Effusion of Christian Blood that threatned this your Maje∣sties Kingdoms, and in probability would have been shed, unless God of his infinite Mercy had put it into your Majesties Heart to call a Parlia∣ment, the only means, in our opinion, under the Almighty, left to quiet the Minds of your Peo∣ple;

We do give your Majesty our most humble and hearty Thanks for your gracious Condescen∣sion, beseeching God to give your Majesty all immaginable Happiness and Prosperity, and grant that such Counsels and Resolutions may be pro∣moted, as conduce to your Majesties Honor and Safety, and tend to the Peace and Settlement of this Realm both in Church and State, according to the Establish'd Laws of the Kingdom.

On board the Resolu∣tion, at Spitehead, Decemb. 1. 1688.
FINIS.
