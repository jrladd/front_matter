MY Lord, in the Coledge at Winchester, where I liue, I haue heard learned men say, that some Philoso∣phers haue mistaken the soule of man for an Harmo∣nie: Let the president of their error be a priuiledge for mine. I see not, if soules doe not partly consist of Musicke, how it should come to passe, that so noble a spirit as yours, so perfectly taned to so perpetuall a Tenor of excellencies as it is, should discend to the notice of a qualitie lying single in so low a personage as my selfe. But in Musicke the Base part is no disgrace to the best eares attendauncie. I confesse my consience is vn∣toucht with any other arts, and I hope, my confession is vnsuspected, many of vs Musitians thinke it as much praise to be some what more then Musitians, as it is for golde to bee some what more than golde, and, if lack Cade were aliue, yet some of vs might liue: vnlesse we should think, as the Artisans in the Vniuersities in Poland, and Germany thinke, that the Latin tongue comes by reflection. I hope your Lordshi will pardon this presumption of mine, the rather, because I know before Nobilitie I am to deale sincearely; and this small facultie of mine, because it is alone in mee, and without the asis∣tance of other more confident sciences, is the more to bee fauored, and the ra∣ther to bee receiued into your honors protection, so shall I obserue you with as humble and as true an heart, as hee, whose knowledge is as large as the worlds creation, and as earnestly pray for you, to the worlds Creator.
