Madam,
THO I never had the Honour to receive a Favour from
you, nay, or be known to you, I take the confidence of
an Author to write to you a Billiet doux Dedicatory;
which is no new thing, for by most Dedications it ap∣pears,
that Authors, though they praise their Patrons from top to
toe, and seem to turn 'em inside out, know 'em as little, as some∣times
their Patrons their Books, tho they read 'em out; and if the
Poetical Daubers did not write the name of the Man or Woman on
top of the Picture, 'twere impossible to guess whose it were. But
you, Madam, without the help of a Poet, have made your self
known and famous in the World; and, because you do not want
it, are therefore most worthy of an Epistle Dedicatory. And this
Play claims naturally your Protection, since it has lost its Reputa∣tion
with the Ladies of stricter lives in the Play-house; and (you
know) when mens endeavours are discountenanc'd and refus'd,
by the nice coy Women of Honour, they come to you, To you the
Great and Noble Patroness of rejected and bashful men, of which
number I profess my self to be one, though a Poet, a Dedica∣ting
Poet; To you I say, Madam, who have as discerning a
judgment, in what's obscene or not, as any quick-sighted civil
Person of 'em all, and can make as much of a double meaning
saying as the best of 'em; yet wou'd not, as some do, make
nonsense of a Poet's jest, rather than not make it baudy: by
which they show they as little value Wit in a Play, as in a Lover,
provided they can bring t'other thing about. Their sense indeed
lies all one way, and therefore are only for that in a Poet which
is moving, as they say; but what do they mean by that word
moving? Well, I must not put 'em to the blush, since I find I can

do't. In short, Madam, you wou'd not be one of those who revish
a Poet's innocent words, and make 'em guilty of their own naugh∣tiness
(as 'tis term'd) in spight of his teeth; nay, nothing is
secure from the power of their imaginations; no, not their Hus∣bands,
whom they Cuckold with themselves, by thinking of other
men, and so make the lawful matrimonial embraces Adultery;
wrong Husbands and Poets in thought and word, to keep their
own Reputations; but your Ladyship's justice, I know, wou'd think
a Woman's Arraigning and Damning a Poet for her own obscenity,
like her crying out a Rape, and hanging a man for giving her
pleasure, only that she might be thought not to consent to't; and
so to vindicate her honour forfeits her modesty. But you, Ma∣dam,
have too much modesty to pretend to't; tho you have as
much to say for your modesty as many a nicer she; for you never
were seen at this Play, no, not the first day; and 'tis no matter
what Peoples lives have been, they are unquestionably modest who
frequent not this Play: For, as Mr. Bays says of his, that it is
the only Touchstone of Mens Wit and Understanding; mine is, it
seems, the only Touchstone of Womens Vertue and Modesty. But
hold, that Touchstone is equivocal, and, by the strength of a La∣dy's
Imagination, may become something that is not civil; but
your Ladyship, I know, scorns to misapply a Touchstone. And, Ma∣dam,
tho you have not seen this Play, I hope (like other nice La∣dies)
you will the rather read it; yet, lest the Chambermaid or
Page shou'd not be trusted, and their indulgence cou'd gain no fur∣ther
admittance for it, than to their Ladies Lobbies or outward
Rooms, take it into your care and protection; for, by your recom∣mendation
and procurement, it may have the honour to get into
their Closets: For what they renounce in publick often entertains
'em there, with your help especially. In fine, Madam, for these
and many other reasons, you are the fittest Patroness or Iudge of
this Play; for you shew no partiality to this or that Author;
for from some many Ladies will take a broad jeast as chearfully
as from the Watermen, and sit at some downright filthy Plays
(as they call 'em) as well satisfy'd, and as still, as a Poet cou'd
wish 'em elsewhere; therefore it must be the doubtful obscenity
of my Plays alone they take exceptions at, because it is too bash∣ful

for 'em; and indeed most Women hate men, for attempting
to halves on their Chastity; and Baudy I find, like Satyr, shou'd
be home, not to have it taken notice of. But, now I mention
Satyr, some there are who say, 'Tis the Plain-dealing of the
Play, not the obscenity; 'tis taking off the Ladies Masks, not
offering at their Pettycoats, which offends 'em: and generally
they are not the handsomest, or most innocent, who are the most
angry at being discover'd:
—Nihil est audacius illis
Deprehensis; iram, at{que} animos a crimine sumunt.
Pardon, Madam, the Quotation, for a Dedication can no more
be without ends of Latine, than Flattery; and 'tis no matter whom
it is writ to; for an Author can as easily (I hope) suppose Peo∣ple
to have more understanding and Languages than they have,
as well as more Vertues: But why, the Devil! shou'd any of the
few modest and handsome be alarm'd? (for some there are who
as well as any deserve those Attributes, yet refrain not from see∣ing
this Play, nor think it any addition to their Vertue to set up
for it in a Play-house, lest there it shou'd look too much like acting.)
But why, I say, shou'd any at all of the truly vertuous be con∣cern'd,
if those who are not so are distinguish'd from 'em? For
by that Mask of modesty which Women wear promiscuously in pub∣lick,
they are all alike, and you can no more know a kept Wench
from a Woman of Honour by her looks than by her Dress; for
those who are of Quality without Honour (if any such there
are) they have their Quality to set off their false Modesty, as
well as their false Iewels, and you must no more suspect their
Countenances for counterfeit than their Pendants, tho, as the
Plain-dealer Montaigne says, Els envoy leur conscience au Bor∣del,
& teinnent leur contenance en regle: But those who act as
they look, ought not to be scandaliz'd at the reprehension of
others faults, lest they tax themselves with 'em, and by too
delicate and quick an apprehension not only make that obscene
which I meant innocent, but that Satyr on all, which was intend∣ed
only on those who deserv'd it. But, Madam, I beg your par∣don

for this digression, to Civil Women and Ladies of Honour,
since you and I shall never be the better for 'em; for a Comic
Poet, and a Lady of your Profession, make most of the other
sort, and the Stage and your Houses, like our Plantations, are
propagated by the least nice Women; and as with the Ministers
of Iustice, the Vices of the Age are our best business. But, now
I mention Publick Persons, I can no longer defer doing you the
justice of a Dedication, and telling you your own; who are, of
all publick-spirited people, the most necessary, most communica∣tive,
most generous and hospitable; your house has been the house
of the People, your sleep still disturb'd for the Publick, and when
you arose 'twas that others might lye down, and you waked that
others might rest; The good you have done is unspeakable; How
many young unexperienc'd Heirs have you kept from rash foolish
Marriages? and from being jilted for their lives by the worst
sort of Iilts, Wives? How many unbewitched Widowers Chil∣dren
have you preserv'd from the Tyranny of Stepmothers?
How many old Dotards from Cuckoldage, and keeping other mens
Wenches and Children? How many Adulteries and unnatural
sins have you prevented? In fine, you have been a constant
scourge to the old Lecher, and often a terrour to the young; you
have made concupiscence its own punishment, and extinguish'd
Lust with Lust, like blowing up of Houses to stop the fire.
Nimirum propter continentiam, incontinentia
Necessaria est, incendium ignibus extinguitur.
There's Latin for you again, Madam; I protest to you, as I am
an Author, I cannot help it; nay, I can hardly keep my self from
quoting Aristotle and Horace, and talking to you of the Rules of
Writing, (like the French Authors,) to shew you and my Readers I
understand 'em, in my Epistle, lest neither of you should find it out by
the Play; and, according to the Rules of Dedications, 'tis no mat∣ter
whether you understand or no, what I quote or say to you, of Wri∣ting;
for an Author can as easily make any one a Iudge or Critick,
in an Epistle, as an Hero in his Play: But, Madam, that this may
prove to the end a true Epistle Dedicatory, I'd have you know 'tis

not without a design upon you, which is in the behalf of the Fra∣ternity
of Parnassus, that Songs and Sonnets may go at your Hou∣ses,
and in your Liberties, for Guinneys and half Guinneys; and
that Wit, at least with you, as of old, may be the price of Beauty,
and so you will prove a true encourager of Poetry, for Love is a
better help to it than Wine; and Poets, like Painters, draw better
after the Life, than by Fancy; Nay, in justice, Madam, I think a
Poet ought to be as free of your Houses, as of the Play-houses; since
he contributes to the support of both, and is as necessary to such as
you, as a Ballad-singer to the Pick-purse, in convening the Cullies
at the Theatres, to be pick'd up, and carry'd to Supper and Bed at
your houses. And, Madam, the reason of this motion of mine is,
because poor Poets can get no favour in the Tiring Rooms, for they
are no Keepers, you know; and Folly and Money, the old Enemies
of Wit, are even too hard for it on its own Dunghill: And for
other Ladies, a Poet can least go to the price of them; besides, his
Wit, which ought to recommend him to 'em, is as much an obstructi∣on
to his Love, as to his wealth or preferment; for most Women
now adays, apprehend Wit in a Lover, as much as in a Husband;
they hate a Man that knows 'em, they must have a blind easie Fool,
whom they can lead by the Nose, and as the Scythian Women of
old, must baffle a Man, and put out his Eyes, ere they will lye
with him, and then too, like Thieves, when they have plunder'd
and stript a Man, leave him But if there shou'd be one of an
hundred of those Ladies, generous enough to give her self to a Man
that has more Wit than Money, (all things consider'd) he wou'd
think it cheaper coming to you for a Mistress, though you made him
pay his Guinney; as a Man in a Iourney, (out of good husban∣dry)
had better pay for what he has in an Inn, than lye on free∣cost
at a Gentlemans House.
In fine, Madam, like a faithful Dedicator, I hope I have done
my self right in the first place, then you, and your Profession, which
in the wisest and most religious Government of the World, is ho∣nour'd
with the publick allowance; and in those that are thought
the most unciviliz'd and barbarous, is protected, and supported by
the Ministers of Iustice; and of you, Madam, I ought to say no
more here, for your Vertues deserve a Poem rather than an Epistle,

or a Volume intire to give the World your Memoirs, or Life at
large, and which (upon the word of an Author that has a mind to
make an end of his Dedication) I promise to do, when I write the
Annals of our British Love, which shall be Dedicated to the Ladies
concern'd, if they will not think them something too obscene too;
when your Life, compar'd with many that are thought innocent, I
doubt not may vindicate you, and me, to the World, for the con∣fidence
I have taken in this Address to you; which then may be
thought neither impertinent, nor immodest; and, whatsoever your
Amorous misfortunes have been, none can charge you with that
heinous, and worst of Womens Crimes, Hypocrisie; nay, in spight
of misfortunes or age, you are the same Woman still; though most
of your Sex grow Magdalens at fifty, and as a solid French Author
has it,
Apres le plaisir, vien't la peine,
Apres la peine la vertu;
But sure an old sinner's continency is much like a Gamester's
forswearing Play, when he has lost all his Money; and Modesty
is a kind of a youthful dress, which, as it makes a young Woman
more amiable, makes an old one more nauseous; a bashful old Wo∣man
is like an hopeful old man; and the affected Chastity of an∣tiquated
Beauties, is rather a reproach than an honour to 'em, for
it shews the mens Vertue only, not theirs. But you, in fine, Ma∣dam,
are no more an Hypocrite than I am when I praise you;
therefore I doubt not will be thought (even by your's and the Play's
Enemies, the nicest Ladies) to be the fittest Patroness for,
Madam,
