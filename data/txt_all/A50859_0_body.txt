SIR,
I Wish you much Peace and Happiness both in Soul and Body. Sir, I do very well know, and am sensible, that you are a great deal better know∣ing in this Art of Rigging than my weak Fancy will ever attain unto, which did in∣vite me to present You with my weak Works: And knowing You to be one that was ever very free to accept of the well-meaning of any one; which did the more urge me to the performance of the same, not fearing but it would have a lo∣ving acceptance from Your Worthy self to pub∣lish the same. So desiring not to be tedious, but only to present my humble thankfulness for for∣mer Courtesies received from You, I shall ever remain,
