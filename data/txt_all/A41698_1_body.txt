SIR,
I Need not here the Servile path pursue,
By doing what most Dedicators do;
Lay out their Patron's Vertues on a Stall,
Like Pedlar's Ware, to please the Crowd withal,
And be despis'd by the Iudicious Eye,
Which does but look and loath, and pass regardless by.
Your Merit speaks it self; a Poet's care,
In lofty praise, wou'd be superfluous there.
What need that Man in a Fool's co be shown
That hath one very graceful of his own?
I wave that Subject then, your generous mind;
Wit, Iudgment, Converse, and what else we find
So lov'd, admir'd, and courted by Mankind;
And humbly at your Feet this worthless Tribute lay;
I owe you much, and blush I can so little pay.
I am, Sir,
