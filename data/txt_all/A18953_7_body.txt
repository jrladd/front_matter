YOur hidden purposes (graue Sir) that rest,
Within the secret closet of your brest,
Haue like predomination with my Fate,
I shall be happy or vnfortunate,
As they assigne me; you may iustly take
A faire occasion now; both to forsake
And vtterly renounce me; but behold
My God aboue (whose secrets are vntold,
All things on Earth as he thinkes best decreeing,
What will my future actions be, foreseeing)
Hath lent me life, and mercie, by my King,
Who is his Substitute, in euery thing;
Since then their doome is past, O let not me
Be new arraign'd, by your seueritie;
Forget my foule offences, me, and all,
Vntill some braue, and noble actions shall
Bring you a new acquainted, if againe
I euer take a course, what shall be vaine,
Or if of any ill, I faultie be,
O then for euer disinherit me.
