Present these Funerall odes unto thine eie,
Wherein though young, like to Tully's Son
You may perceive, what great deedes have ben don
By your progenitors! deigne then to read
These living Trophees of true honour dead.
Though wise Cratippus reach you, yet behold
How vertue robes nobility in gold.
We know there is a Sun, because his light
Ap'y distinguishes twixt day, and night.
Your Ancestors like to th glorious Sun
Have led the way, (you Honours race mst rn.
Your infant Honours like to a welcome Spring
Are by the Graces mark'd for vertues King.
Live there, and grow there! never may I see
A fall'oth Leafe, in your progenitrie.
Shine in thy Princes favours, and appeare
Like the bless'd Sunne, when as hetrotes the spheare.
Let no cloud blemish thee! still may your ee
Aime at the graces of high Majesty.
Out-grow thy honord fathers goodnes! then

Your Mother weares the wreath of goodnes! you
From such faire Trees must neede a Trophy grow.
Blessd be you ever, may I still deserve
