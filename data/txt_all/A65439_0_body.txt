Most Royal, Religious, and Sacred Soveraign,
WHen I had first most humbly presented my petition to your Majesty upon the Long Galle∣rie stairs towards St. James his park in Trinitie Term 1660. I did presently implore your Majestie to be pleased but to peruse the same, and then my self your poor subject should reap abundance of satisfaction therein; and your Majesties gracious answer unto me was, with a reitera∣tion of these words, I shall, I shall, and within lesse then an hour after, I did hear, that your Majestie had performed your princely promise, for which I have ever
 since desired to render to your Grace, the most humble and hearty thanks of a loyal and gratefull subject: And now most humbly prostrating my self at the feet of your Majsties clemency again, I do most submissely and ear∣nestly begg at your gracious hands one favour more, beseeching your Majesty to be pleased to accept of and to patronize these my weak endeavours, which most hum∣bly and thankfully I do Dedicate and present to your Grace; beseeching your Majesty to vouchsafe the peru∣sal of this Treatise, at some time when the heavie burden of those so serious, and urgent affairs imposed upon you, will admit of an intermission: and so your Majestie shall be truly informed what my condition is and hath been; which being once known to your Grace, I shall rest in abundance of quiet, and with alacritie submit to such success, as the good Providence and will of God, and your gratious Pleasure shall thereupon suffer to be pro∣duced; Royall Sir, I am one of those, that have been a Cordiall loving and obedient Subject▪ in my Dutie and Allegiance to your Royall and Religious Father and Grandfather of glorious and blessed Memorie, yet my Fate was never hitherto so propitious, as to afford me any further favour then the common protection of a Subject: and if the unhappinesse of the Times, by the occasion of our sins, had not late deprived us of that roy∣al Favour, then in all probability I might have been in
 such a posture before this time, as I should not now have been necessitated, to seek an Office, to maintain me in my old Age: But I have almost been bereaved of all my means and practise from my Age of 40 years to 60. the best time of proficiencie in all a mans life: and yet I praise God for it, I can with a good comfort and cour∣age say to your Majestie that I am no absolute Beggar, but only in Relation to God, and your good Grace, that is his lawfull and undoubted Deputie here upon the Earth; for by means of Gods mercie, and your Ma∣jesties so happy and Fortunate Accesse to your just and Royal rights, I am still in lawfull possession of an Estate in Lands, which although it be but small▪ yet it is of a Noble Tenure, being late holden of your Majestie by a whole Knights Fee, and which hath lineally been enjoy∣ed by my Ancestors, and continued in my name, for the space of near 500. years, ever since the Reign of King Henry the 3d. and that is more then some great Ones are able to assert, and certainly a blessing hath been upon it, in the so long continuance thereof, being at first honestly bought with their Money, and a Bargain I think more justifiable, then some kind of purchasing either of Honour or Offices: And although my name be at present and of late in some obsuritie, yet it hath not been allwayes so in the times of Antiquite for in the Reign of that Valiant and Famous Prince King
 Edward the 1. there lived one of my name which had the Honour to be Lord high Treasurer of England, and in the Reignes of King Henry the 6th and King Edward the 4th there was another of my name, that was a Knight of the Garter, and of the Rhodes, and also a Noble and warrlike Baron of Wenlock in the County of Salop, from which place my Ancestors were first derived, and had their Extraction, as appears by Antient evidence & Records; I shall be heartily glad if I can but make your Matie to smile at these my Relations, but I entreat your Majestie to beleeve that it is not fondly a vain glorious humour, that prompts me to re∣late these things, but my desire is to give a gentle caution to some gilded Mushromes or pursie supercillious Up∣starts of the new edition that esteem themselves to be the only brave men, dspising others, that are brought low by their sufferings, and contemning all learning and loyalty, that is destitute of a golden key, which they corruptly conceive to be the only means to open the door∣lock, that leads to preferrment; but your Majestie well knows, how and when to conferr your Favours, and though some of your Majesties suffering Friends are not looked upon so soon as they expected, yet their hopes are still firm enough, and we know, that, De∣sideta diu dulcius obtinentur, and we can wait with patience, but must not be too negligent, peentis
 negligentia reprehendtur ubi de dantis misere∣cordia non duitatur, and of your Majesties mercie there is sound experience, and it is a prime policie for your Grace in convenient time to reward Loyaltie, for in so doing it will give Occasion to others to have the better esteem thereof, Regis ad exemplar totus componitur orbis, but if vertue be now neglected & let pass without regard, how few hereafter will ever endeavour to be good in so bad times? and one saith, that both pitie and sin it were, that such whose light the late Aegyptian Darkness could never extinguish, should now be suffered to sit in obscuritie. Som per∣haps that shall read this book, will take my expressions to be rash and violent, savouring more of animosity, then prudence, but when Croesus his life was in danger it made his dumb son to speak and cry out: and when the King the Father of our Countrie, the Church our Mother, and the peace of the whole Kingdom, were so treacherouslie exposed to the danger of utter ruine, what true hearted Son or Subject, could be so supinely silent, as not bitterlie to reprove such horrid actions▪ Qui¦tacet consentire videur: but such as have tasted any true rellish of Religion, do well know, they must not be mutes in matters of such moment: Dissimulation may serve the turn for a time, and in the view of a car∣nal eye it may seem to procure some good, but we ought
 not to do evill that good may come thereof; Hypocrisie is a sin so odious in the sight of God, and so contrarie to his divine nature (who is truth it self) as those that prac∣tise the same, can never expect to be matriculated mem∣bers of the celestial Societie; but such as wait for their souls comfort, must be content to forsake all, rather then to part with a good conscience, and so endanger the soul; But I fear that too many of late, have stifled their Consciences, to keep their estates and maintain their reputation amongst the Vulgar, but such policie will not allways go away with the Garland: it was well said of a Noble Spaniard once in England, that he would never forfeit his Soul and his Honour, to save his Life; and indeed some brave Spirits, but meer Moralists, have thought it a more Noble Exploit, to preserve Honour then Life, and could never buckle to any dishonourable thing, but in despite of Ambition, and desire of gain, or the pressures of Necessitie, they have still resolved to tread in the paths of Virtue. And how many Heathens, as Codrus a King of Athens, Curius a Noble Knight of Rome and all∣most infinite others recorded in Historie, have freely exposed themselves to unavoidable danger and death, for the good and safety of their Country, whose memory ever since hath been immortall; and can Christians ad∣venture upon any design too dangerous, when the glo∣rie
 of God, the Honour and Power of his sacred De∣putie, and the eligion and Peace of their native Na∣tion, lay all in the dust involved in blood? Pardon my presumption I beseech your Majestie in what I have here inserted amiss, or unworthy the view of so roial and exquisite an i: and then I cannot but be confident, that your Grace will take some piti upon me, being now grown into years, and disabled by my great sufferings and losses to put on and preferre my self, as some others , for I finde the Poet to be a true Prophet, that long  said, Haud facile emergunt, quorum virtutibus obstat Res angusti domi— but this defect may soon be supplied by the least glimpse of your Majesties favour: and I am sure your Majestie well knowes that it is the Masters honour to take notice of a faithfull srvant; and that such as dare declare and stand to the truth in bad times of danger are none of the worst subjects. And I doubt not but that your Ma∣jesty in due time, will most roially perform whatsoever your loial and loving subjects may in truth of modestie and justice expect from your gracious bands: and that your Grace shall attain unto and accomplish all those happie and blessed intents and ends for the which your
 Omnipotent Creator hath so justly and mercifully resto∣red and advanced your Grace, to the glorious throne of your so eminent Ancestours: Where God▪ grant that your Majestie and your Roial posteritie may safely sit and triumphantly reigne to Gods glorie, the Churches peace, and these Kingdoms happinesse, even so long as the Sun and Moon shall shine upon the face of the earth. So will ever Pray▪
