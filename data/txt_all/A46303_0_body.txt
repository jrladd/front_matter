SIR,
IT was by your assistance (enabling me) that I commenc'd a Voy∣age into those remote parts of the World (known to us by the painful Discovery of that memorable Gentle∣man Sir Fran. Drake.) Your bounty then and formerly hath engaged a re∣tribution of my Gratitude, and not knowing how to testifie the same unto you otherwayes, I have (although with some reluctancy) adventured to obtrude upon you these rude and in∣digested Eight Tears Observations, wherein whether I shall more shame my self or injure your accurate Iudg∣ment and better Employment in the perusal, is a question.


We read of Kings and Gods that kindly took
A Pitcher fill'd with Water from the Brook.

The Contemplation whereof (well∣knowing your noble and generous Dis∣position) hath confirm'd in me the hope that you will pardon my presumption, and accept the tender of the fruits of my Travel after this homely man∣ner, and my self as,
Sir,
