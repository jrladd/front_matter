SIR,
TO omit the many trifling Pretences commonly made use of upon these Occasions, I shall think this Dedication abundantly justified, by only alledging one thing in its Excuse, That every Man is by no means duly pre∣pared to Read, or Relish; much less is every Man of Quality, a proper Patron for Epictetus.
So Exquisite a Piece of Mora∣lity, requires not only a Good Un∣derstanding, but a Virtuous and Well Disposed Mind, a Serious Sense of the Dignity of a Reason∣ing

Soul, and a due Care to keep up its Character; Affections raised above the Sordid Enjoyments of the World, and a fix'd Opinion, that the Trouble we are at about these things, ought not to be e∣steemed the Business, but the Great Misfortune and Incumbrance of Humane Life; a steddy Govern∣ment of the Passions, and a Temper Even and Easie, Affable and Ob∣liging. Without these Qualifica∣tions, or some good Advances to∣ward them, a Man's Palate can never stand to the following Re∣flections; and the most excellent Rules of Living, would be enter∣tain'd with coldness and contempt.
Whether I have done this Au∣thor Reason in the following

Translation, is neither possible nor proper for me to determine: But though that performance were al∣lowed to be never so perfect, it is yet a very necessary Advantage, and indeed a Right due both to him and my self, to take Sanctuary in the Goodness of a Person who knows the better how to Pardon, because he knows how to Judge; and whose Virtues have already not only approved, but transcri∣bed, and by the best, the Chri∣stian Morality have even Correct∣ed and Refined upon all the most valuable Parts of this Book.
How far this is your case, I will not, I need not take upon me to determine; all Sir, that have the Happiness to know you, will do it

for me: Permit me only to close this Address, with my most sin∣cere Wishes, that you may long continue an Ornament to Learn∣ing, Religion, and your own Fa∣mily, a publick Blessing to your Country and your Friends, and that I may have the honour of be∣ing ever acknowledged in that Number. One Testimony where∣of, will be the accepting these Pro∣fessions which I am now desirous to make to the World, of my being with all possible Respect,
Sir,

Levisham, Feb. 1st, 1694.
