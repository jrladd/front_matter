IT was a notable Character, which Cornelius Tacitus, (that famous
Register of Time, who had lived here many years) did give of London
about fifteen hundred years agoe, Londinum copiâ Negotiatorum,
& Comeatu maximè celebre, London a most renowned Mart for multi∣tude
of Marchants, and Commerce. If She deserved such a Character in
those dayes, what would She merit now? who being compared to what she was
then, may be said, in point of magnitude, to be as a large Volume in Folio,
to a Book in Decimo Sexto: And, in point of Trade, as in an East Indy
Carack, to a Quinbourough Oyster ketch.
I have read of some, who have bin enamor'd of Cities, as others use to be
of Mistresses: so Charles the Emperor, was struck with the love of Flo∣rence,
when among other expressions he said, That she was a fair Lady,
fit to be seen only on Holidayes; So a French Baron was so taken with
the City of Paris, (which is known to be none of the neatest) that he said,
Could he live ever in Paris, he would quit his right to Paradise. And
it is storied of Tamberlain, that having got Constantinople, the first Com∣plement
he put upon Her, was, that he had heard so much of Her rare
beauty, that He came from so far off to Court Her; but answer was
made, that it was the Custom of Thrace, to Court fair Ladies, not with Trum∣pets
and Drums, but with Dulcimers, and other melodious Instruments.
I may well affirm, that London is not inferior to any of these, as will
appear in a Parallel hereunto annexed: And having breath'd Air, and
slept in her bosom, now near upon forty years (except the times that I was a∣broad
upon forren Employments,) it is no wonder, if I be habitually in love
with Her; nor have I bin wanting to express it many times by dedicating
unto Her the great French Dictionary refin'd, and enrich'd with divers
Additionals; Then in giving Her some warnings by the sad destiny of Je∣rusalem,
in an Epitome that goes of Josephus; I shewed my self also very
sensible of Her case at that time, when I addressd unto Her Englands
Teares, and Mercurius Acheronticus. nor is it long since, that I made
publick love to Venice, and Courted Naples also, and I came off with no ill
success; I hope to do the like here.

I know others ave treated already of the same Subject, and given a lau∣dible
account of the City of London, but Gold may be often told over with∣out
fouling the fingers. I have read near upon a dozen several Survayes
of Rome and Venice, with other Cities, and I alwayes found new Observa∣tions;
But it is now above thirty foure years agoe, (which are near upon five
Ages in the Law) since any thing was written of London, and West∣minster
her collateral Sister; which tract of time, affords variety of accidents,
which the Reader shall find in this new Account: wherein as I have bin care∣ful
not to preermit any thing thats Material, so my special Caution hath
bin not to thrust in any frivolous pedantick things, or Superfluities, where∣unto
my nature hath bin alwayes averse; Moreover, I promise the Reader,
that he shall meet with many other Observations here, which were never yet
drawn off the Presse, or exposed to publick light until now.
I will conclude my Epistle with this Question, If it was esteemed an honour
among the Greeks, to be born in Athens; If among the Italians, to be a
Roman; If among the Spaniards to be a Toledano: why should it be lesse
honour for an Englishman to be born in London?
My hearty prayers to Heaven are, for the incolumity, and welfare of this
Great City, for the aversion of all Iudgements, and that she may still flourish
with affluence of all Earthly felicity; by which prayer I subscribe my self,
Much Honoured Sirs,
