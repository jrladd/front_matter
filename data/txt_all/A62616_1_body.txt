SIR,
WHen I had perform'd the Service which you were pleased to call me to in the preach∣ing of this Sermon, I had no thoughts of making it more publique; And yet in this also I was the more easi∣ly induced to comply with your de∣sire, because of the suitableness of the Argument to the Age in which we live; wherein as men have run into the wildest extremities in other things, so particularly in the matter of Oaths; some making conscience
of taking any Oaths at all, and too many none at all of breaking them.
To convince the great mistake of the one extreme, and to check the growing evil and mischief of the other, is the chief design of this Discourse. To which I shall be very glad if by God's blessing it may prove any-wise serviceable. I am
Sir,
