SIr, your Wor∣ship may well account mee bold to dedi∣cate this my bare Translation vnto you but indeede I know not well how to auoid the imputation, because that if I should haue presented it to any other, I

must haue done you wrong, as the case standeth; for may it please you to vnderstand, that being in your Sonnes studie at Grayes Inne (vnto whom for a while I read the French tongue,) he chanced amongst other bookes to find out the o∣riginall of the two last Trea∣tises of this booke, which in our perusing, J in my poore iudgement found to be such worthy matters, that I could not content my selfe with the reading of them, but bor∣rowed the booke of him, and

my wast times tooke occasion (as well for my owne further satisfaction, as to impart it vnto others, my particular friends,) to translate it in∣to our English tongue, not meaning to haue had it published in print. Which when your said Son (whom J haue still found to bee a louer of such godly workes) vnderstood, hee was very desirous to haue it printed, alledging that it could not chuse but bee verie pro∣fitable for the Common∣wealth,

whereunto (although somewhat vnwilling in re∣gard of my weaknesse in the performance thereof) yet at last I condescended, and to amplify the volume, annexed another excellent Treatise to comfort the sicke, written by the same Author, which for order sake I haue placed before the other two, and do present them together vnto your Worship, as belonging vnto you of right; beseeching you to take them in as good part as they are willing∣ly

offered, and to haue in mind in your iudiciall cen∣sure, that although I haue not shewed the part of an ex∣cellent Orator in setting of it forth in our newe refined Phrases, yet that J haue done the duty of a faithfull Translator, in following the originall word for word so neere as with sence J could. And if this my first little labour shall proue agreeable and profitable, I shall not on∣ly thinke it well bestowed, but also be much encouraged, to

goe on with the rest of the same Authors works which will bee of a greater conti∣nent, wherein at the request of some, J am already well entred. And thus beseeching the Almighty to grant you plentie of his Graces, I com∣mend you, and all yours to his most blessed protection. From my house in London this 14. of May. 1611.
