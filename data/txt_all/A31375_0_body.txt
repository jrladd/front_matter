THese muzzle puzzle Momists, hooke the Jawes
Of Doegs: who accuse your Righteous Cause;
These spure your speeds, Anchour (sans fluctation)
Your right resolves for Church, State, Reformation,
These whet your Swords, fuellize your zealous Fires
For Grace, Peace, Truth, which wish't, my loves, desires;
All my poore best, my Martiall minde, tongue, pen,
Are with you, for you, brave resolved Men.
Fight you for us, wee will your Trophies raise,
Crowne your devoires, with Prayers, Praises, Bayes.
