I Haue presum'd to Dedicate this Booke
Vnto your selfe (Kinde Sir,) vouchsafe to looke
Into the same: and with indicious eyes
View here the difference twixt the foole and wise.
I count them fooles, which night by night doe sit
In Tauernes for to foolifie their wit;
Suffring strong wine to domineire and braue,
And so make Reason a poore captiue slaue:
Who with Hell-smoaking vapours doe delight
To turne night into day, day into night:
In which they Time, Wealth, Wit, and all doe wast,

Because to beggery they soone would hast.
I deeme them wise which can this sinne eschew,
And blesse themselues from such a damned crew
Of hate full hell-hounds, in all sinnes growne ripe,
Which daily daunce before the Diuels Pipe:
There's not a vice, but they'r expert in all,
And ready into Hels wide mouth to fall.
At Bacchus Altars they their sinnes deplore:
And Venus for their Goddesse doe adore.
All vertuous thoughts they from their hearts expell,
And neuer thinke of Iudgement, Heauen, or Hell.
Then blest are they (I say) which sober liue,
And not an eare to their inticements giue:
Which keepe decorum euer in their wayes,
Both to Gods glory, and their endlesse praise:
By this they shall preserue their wealth and name
From preiudice, from scandall and from shame:
By this they shall be honor'd and renown'd,
Where speciall vertues in them so abound,
'Tis euer best a golden meane to keepe,
And not to clmbe too high, nor wade too deepe,
Lest climbing high, the greater be their fall,
And by deepe wading they be drown'd withall.
To keepe vs then from falling eyther way,
Vpon this staffe let our affections stay

Of blessed Golden Meane, there let vsrest;
So liue, so dye; and dying so, be blest.
Thus hoping you will kindely this receiue,
The rest vnto your generous thoughts I leaue.
