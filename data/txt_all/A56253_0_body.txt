SIR,
I Should scarce have had the
boldness to prefix your great

Name to this Book: had I
not been fully persuaded that
the extraordinary worth of my
Author would strongly plead
for me to your Excellencies
Generosity. For, since my in∣tention
was, that the Sieur
Puffendorf's Introduction to the
History of Europe should appear
in no less Lustre in this King∣dom,
than it has heretofore done
in most parts of Europe; I could
not, without injuring a Person
so famous for his Learning, and
the rank he bears in one of the
Northern Kingdoms, submit his
Treatise to the Protection of
any other Person, than your
Excellency, whose judging Pow∣er
is so universally acknow∣ledged:

If it endures this Test,
it must pass current in this
Nation. The high Station in
which you are now plac'd by
the choice of the wisest and
bravest of Kings, having put
your Merits above the Praises
of a private Person; I shall ra∣ther
admire than pretend to
enumerate them, wishing, that
as your Actions have hitherto
been most effectual in preser∣ving
your Country's Liberty,
so your Counsels may for the
future prove as fatal to the
French, as the Swords of your
glorious Ancestor's in former
Ages. Thus recommending my
self to your Excellencies Pro∣tection,

I beg leave to subscribe
my self,
