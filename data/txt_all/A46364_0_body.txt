My Lord,
'TIS a strange Question ask'd by St. Peter, Who will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? a Question that inti∣mates Innocence, an effectual Protection a∣gainst wrong and violence: But he had been taught the Doctrine of the Cross, he had seen his divine Master, the Arche-type of Im∣maculate
Purity and Innocence, basely betray'd by an Apostle of his own, contumeliously abu∣sed by a Rabble he had infinitely oblig'd, Blas∣phem'd by an Impious Souldiery, scoff'd and laugh'd at by prophane Governors, and under a colour of Justice, by the cursed Arts of his malicious Enemies, formally Arraign'd, Con∣demn'd, and Executed as a Traytor to Caesar: This was an instance so clear, it was impossi∣ble not to be convinc'd by it, that Innocence and Goodness instead of protecting men from injury, expose them to it: And lest those he writ to, might, (by the Question he had ask'd) mistake themselves into a confidence, that Innocence would secure them from Persecu∣tion, the inspir'd Penman obviates the Error, by applying himself immediately to instruct them in their conduct, when opprest with Ca∣lumnies and Wrongs.
That Golden Age is long since past, when an Universal Innocence secur'd every one from injury: The World hath since been in a State of War: Inoffensiveness is no longer a sufficient Guard, and by the Law of Nature the weaker yields to the more powerful. The Innocence of the Lamb cannot secure him from the Violence of Wolves, or Sub∣tilty of Foxes; The greater Fish devour the less. The harmless Dove is the daily food of the Birds of Prey; and Man not content to
have the Fish of the Sea, the Beasts of the Field, and the Fowls of the Air a Sacrifice to his pleasure, is so maliciously bent to worry his own kind, as if he thought himself created for the ruine of his fellow-Creatures, particu∣larly of Man. Craft and Malice raise them∣selves Trophies on the Ruins of Innocence, and the Nimrods of the Earth triumph in the Spoils of their Inferiors, and place their Glo∣ry in Oppression and Violence.
This State of War being very uneasy, rea∣son had recourse to the Expedient of Laws, and Constitution of Governments, to retrieve in some measure, by Religion and Justice, the irreparable loss of Primitive Innocence and Natural Goodness.
But those ill Inclinations that made Laws necessary to restrain their Malignity from breaking into act, no sooner found the Hand ty'd up by Laws from violent Attempts, but the Head was imploy'd to elude those Laws by subtilty and artifice, to render that which was design'd the protection of the Innocent, a Snare to catch them in; to make Law an in∣strument of Oppression, and Justice it self a Minister of injury. A State no less dange∣rous to man in his civil Capacity, than that ill habit of body, that turns the most wholesom food into poyson, is dangerous to his nature, consuming and ruining it by that very aliment
that should have repaired and preserved it.
Such is the State of that Government, where a prevalent Faction doth by colour of Law and pretence of Religion, destroy the Religion and Rights of their Adversaries; who are therefore the more miserable, because they suffer unjustly under a form of Ju∣stice.
Such, My Lord, is the State the Prote∣stants in France complain of at this day: The Enemies of their Religion had vow'd it's Ex∣tirpation: They had try'd the force of Inhu∣mane Cruelties and unheard of Butcheries to destroy the Professors of it: Finding it im∣pregnable by open assault, they apply them∣selves to effect by art and subtilty, what they had in vain attempted by force and violence, and to destroy by Law what they had found proof against Fire and Sword, Torture and Massacre. They procure Edicts for demolish∣ing their Churches, rasing their Oratories, and shutting up their Schools, or converting them to other uses; the very method us'd with so much success by Julian the Apostate, for rooting out Christianity.
The Protestants alarm'd at the Proceed∣ings of their Enemies, arm'd with authority, and vigorously using it to their ruin, apply themselves by Petition to their King, for re∣dress
of their Grievances, and preservation of the Priviledges granted them by the Edicts and Arrests of his Illustrious Ancestors: That great Prince mov'd with the justice of their demands, grants an Edict, That no violence be done his Protestant Subjects on the account of Religion. Their Enemies not discourag'd resolve to pursue their point, and under specious pretences of Piety, obtain au∣thority to labour the Conversion of Prote∣stants, to visit their Sick, to examine their Children, and to receive their Declaration at seven years old, what Religion (the Re∣formed or Roman) they would choose to be instructed in: They improve this Authority so effectually and scandalously to the destru∣ction of the Protestants, that laying aside the antiquated means of instruction and argu∣ment, they took a new method for Conver∣sion, making use only of Threats to frighten, of Promises to seduce, of Money and Immu∣nities to bribe, and (where these means failed) of force to compel Men, Women, and Children into that Catholick Church, which turns all into Fish that come into its Net, and ensures all who go to Mass a safe Arrival in Heaven.
The Protestants sensible of the abuse of the Authority of their King, contrary to his intentions, prepare a second Address for re∣lief;
but coming to present it, found all Avenues blocked up, no access to his Majesty, no redress in his Courts, the Ministers of State prepossess'd to their prejudice, and themselves look'd upon as Enemies to the State.
My Lord, It was the artifice of their Enemies to represent them such to that ambi∣tious Monarch, too generous and compassio∣nate to persecute good Subjects, but extream∣ly jealous of his Authority. So the Jewish Priests finding Pilate convinc'd of our Savi∣our's Innocence, and inclin'd to acquit him, suggest, he had spoken against Caesar, &c. and prevail'd with that Judge to Condemn him for Treason, the greatest of Crimes, who upon a solemn hearing, declar'd he had found no fault in him.
The greatest Affliction to an innocent Suf∣ferer is aspersion of Guilt; Tortures may crack his Sinews, mangle his Limbs, and destroy his Body, but false Aspersions wound the Heart, distract the Spirits, and rend and tear the Soul in pieces. His Innocence may support him against the pains of Racks and Gibbets, but the torture of Calumny is intole∣rable.
This, My Lord, is the Case of the Affli∣cted Protestants: They have for their Reli∣gion patiently submitted to the Persecution
of their Enemies: But they not content to have strip'd them naked, forc'd them to seek a lively-hood in forraign Regions, and live on the Alms of people unknown, endeavour to rob them of their sole support, the repu∣tation of their Innocence; by perswading the World, they are men of Rebellious Prin∣ciples, Enemies to Government, particularly Monarchy: This of all their Sufferings is the only one they are impatient of, and could not submit to without a Defence.
My Lord, The Sufferings of the French Protestants, the injustice of their Persecuti∣on, the ill consequences that may attend it, and the clearing of their Loyalty, are the principal Subjects of the following Discour∣ses: The three first particulars are peculiar to those of the Reformed Religion in France: The last so far concerns the whole Protestant Party of Europe, as the common Enemy charges them all with Principles of Rebel∣lion: The Author, though he apply himself chiefly to vindicate the Reformed of France, hath not forgot to add somewhat in justi∣fication of other Protestants, and, by a just Translation of the Crime, laid the Guilt of Rebellious Principles and Practi∣ses at the doors of their Enemies.

The sight of misery, especially undeserv'd, melts a generous soul into pity and compas∣sion; but of all the Sufferings our nature is subject to, those undergone for Conscience and Religion are the most glorious, and best deserve Commiseration; when out of sence of Duty to the Soveraign of the World, for an inward and innocent satisfaction of mind, and hopes of pleasure purely spiritual, invi∣sible and fature, men slight all the pleasures of sence; and with true Magnanimity, not only contemn worldly advantages, but chear∣fully endure the smartest Afflictions and Tor∣tures: Criminals have that benefit of the Laws they offend, they are allow'd to plead for themselves: An Innocent Sufferer hath right to Compassion and Favour, especially a Sufferer on the account of Religion, and who, on that account, hath been forc'd to seek in strange Countries, the right deny'd him in his own. Such, My Lord, are these Protestant Exiles, who barr'd access to the French King their Lord, fled for refuge to the Throne of our most Gracious Prince, who in Commiseration to the distressed Prote∣stants, hath made his Kingdoms a general Sanctuary, where they who could not have ju∣stice, quiet, or security at home, find safety, protection, and favour, with the benefit of Laws, and kind influences of a Government
infinitely more Gentle than those they were born under.
My Lord, 'Tis the Glory of the Mighty to protect the Innocent: Nothing makes power look so venerable and divine, as imploying it aright. The highest pleasure and best fruit of greatness is the conscience to have used it well: That excellent Prince who esteemed the day lost wherein he had not obliged some of his Inferiors, was the Darling of Mankind: His memory is blest to this day, when others who mov'd in the same Sphear, but made ill use of their greatness, are mentioned with abhor∣rence: Persons of eminent dignity and power draw the eyes of inferiour mankind, as those Luminous bodies that move in the upper Re∣gions, which all look at, but with aspects dif∣ferent as the Apprehensions they have of them: Those they conceive of a malignant nature, they look on with horrour; but those they apprehend benign and good, they behold with pleasure and delight, with hope and con∣fidence, with respect and veneration.
My Lord, Allow me the liberty to tell your Lordship, that among the Stars of the greater magnitude in our Horizon, the Distressed Protestants fix their Eyes on you, as one of no less Propitious than Powerful Influence: Their envious Enemies have endeavoured to blast their Reputation, and by Calumny and
unjust aspersions to rob them of the benefit of that justice they might pretend to at home, and to represent them unworthy any favour abroad: This oblig'd them to a Vindication of themselves in their own Language: But that being not universally understood in this Kingdom (where they are so neerly concern'd to stand right in the opinion of the most loyal and best Reformed Church of the World) I thought it not altogether unuseful to them, to have their Defence publish'd in English for general satisfaction: The same malice that assaulted their Innocence by unjust Aspersi∣ons, will be too apt to cavil at their Vindica∣tion, and cry down their defence: The Ju∣stice of their Cause, without the assistance of a powerful patronage, may be too weak to protect them. And for The last Efforts of Afflicted Innocence, The just Vindication of Per∣secuted Protestants, what Patronage more suitable, what Protection more agreeable than His, whose noble Extraction and generous Temper naturally incline to pity the miserable, to protect the Innocent, and succour the in∣jur'd? Whose integrity and soundness in the Protestant Religion, have render'd him eminent for piety, vertue, and worth; and whose ample fortune, dignity, and honour, no less justly than signally distinguish him from other Men? And for that this Chara∣cter
belongs peculiarly to your Lordship, be pleas'd to excuse the liberty I take to beg, these Discourses may appear in English, under your Lordships Auspicious Name; and that you will believe, nothing but the lustre of your great Qualities, and the glory of your Name, appearing so proper to protect and grace a Tract of this nature, and the opinion of your goodness and condescension to vouchsafe it that honour, could have inspir'd me with this presumption. For which I humbly beg pardon, who am,
My Lord,
