Madam,
THIS Sermon being Preached in your Graces Audience, upon that common occasion of grief that affe∣cted us all, and several Persons of Honour and Quality that then heard it, urging me to make it thus publick; I thought it would be at least a very proper Presumption, humbly to offer, and Dedicate it to your Grace; your Grace being so related both to the great Sub∣ject, and the unworthy Composer of it, who indeed should have been more considerable, and proportionate to such an Argument, as very rarely happens, and is the Work of many Ages to produce. However it has had that civility in its rudeness of addressing to your Grace, that it has intermitted a little, till time had something moderated a very intense Mourning, and rendered your Grace more ca∣pable
of considering in general, and especially of perusing a Discourse of this nature. If this can please your Grace when it appears upon Ink and Paper; as well as it once did when 'twas spoken, I may boldly venture it into the World; and have no Apprehension what the most Critical Observer can say against it. As to that part of it which is proper, it being such manifest truth, as your Grace can best testifie, is not capable of any censure, un∣less it be because it is naked truth without due cloathing, or Ornament: But this I hope will be an advantage to it, and make it more authentickly accepted, that it addresses directly to the Ʋnderstanding, and not by the mediation of Fancy, which so misrepresents things according to the fine Words and Dres∣ses in which they are objected to it. Madam, what I shall add more, is only to recommend you most heartily to the Care and Blessing of God Almighty, which shall ever be the con∣stant expression of that Duty that is owing to your Grace, by your Graces
