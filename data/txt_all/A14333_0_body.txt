RIGHT Noble and most Illustrious Prince: Your gracious acceptance of my Via recta ad vitam lon∣gam, formerly consecrated vnto you, induced me not a little to hastn the perfiting of the same, with the addition of a se∣cond Part, which I now likewise commend to your Highnesse patronage, being a worke in regard of the subject most befitting your Majesty, who is the chie∣fest hope and future health of Great-Britaines Mo∣narchy. If these my Labours, that I may testifie my loyall and gratefull heart to your Maiesty, shall any way further your health and prosperity of body, I have my ayme and contentment. For without health Quid potest in hac vita esse gratum, quid jucun∣dum?
Non honor, non divitiae: imperfect a qui∣dem sunt omnia corporis bona, nisi secunda jun∣gantur valetudine. Health therefore is the Sum∣mum bonum in this life; quia vitam maximè ju∣cundam reddit & foelicem. Wherefore that it may be obtained and enjoyed, Non tantummodo oran∣dum, sed & enixè laborandum est. Thus refer∣ring both this Worke and myselfe to your Highnesse protection, with my daily prayers unto God for your Majesties safety and happy continuance of life, to the exceeding great comfort of all true hearted Britaines, I in all dutifull obedience most humbly rest
