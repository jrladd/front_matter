SIR, I haue much desired to present you with some testimony of my loue. Being therefore mooued to the publication of these Sermons touching the initiating of the Eunuch by Baptisme, into the number of professed Christians, I thought fit to commend them by this more speciall inscription to your reading: I preached vpon the whole History, touching what passed betwixt Philip, and this noble Conuert: but least I should be thought to oppresse the times with so many of my publish∣ings in one kind, therefore I selected that which God gaue me to deliuer out of this passage; and that principally for the furtherance of their vnderstanding into whose hands this shall come, in the point of sauing faith, and in the man∣ner of applying Christ vnto the soule. My hope is (through Gods mercy) it may doe some good that way. Your selfe are one to whose soule I wish the best; as an vndissembled ar∣gument whereof, I beseech you to accept these sheetes. Your respect to me in my Ministery (out of which, what am I?) doth I confesse deserue more: but where power is defe∣ctiue, I must pray you that syncerity of affection, may make the supply: The truth is I am paid before hand, for

this, and for more then I now make offer off; but yet I will craue this recompence of you, that if either by this or any other my endeuour, you receiue comfort, you would desire God to make me faithfull and profitable in my function to the end: In assured hope that you will doe so, my selfe doe heere promise vnder my hand to remaine. Modbury this 27. of Ianuary.
