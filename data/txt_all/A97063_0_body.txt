On the sad Losse of the truly Honourable ROBERT Lord BROOK:
An Elegie, To his Vertuous and Noble Lady.

SWEET LADY,

Can your weeping Eye behold
A paper, sadly offer'd, where 'tis told,
Your Lord is Dead? And so Vntimely too?
Treble to You, to Vs a double Woe.
'Tis Sad to Say; Sadder to you to Heare:
Vnhappy he, must be the Messenger.


Yet since you Know so True, so Sad a Woe,
Give leave to let you know, We know it too.
we first your Losse, and then your Griefe bemone;
(Some Ease, in Sadnesse, not to weep Alone:)
Our Tears (ambitious) make their sad addresse;
(we'd bear a part, that You might weep the lesse.)
Give leave, we pray, to joyne in Tears with You,
(Yet weep we shall, whether with leave, or no:)
And make this paper blest to kisse your hand,
From him who's prest,

MADAME,
