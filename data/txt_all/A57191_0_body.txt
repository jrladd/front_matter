most Loyal Subject, who doth truly reverence and honour your Sacred Person. Part of these

am truly sensible of mine inabilities to answer expectation, and therefore do humbly sue
for your gracious pardon: I be∣seech the ancient of days, to add many years unto your preci∣ous
life. The Lord make your Sacred Majesty a special choice instrument of his glory, that you
may reign gloriously here, and have a Crown of Immortal Glory hereafter; for the obtaining
whereof, your Majesty shall have the most fer∣vent and hearty prayers of
