HAuing (Right Honourable) long time purposed, to put somewhat in practize that I might present to your honourable viewe, the weaknesse of my abilitie hath hitherto holden mee in doubt, whither I were best, by writing to shew my good wil, or by stay∣ing my penne to conceale the same. But being at Sea in March last in the Hercules of London, I resolued to take in hand the translating of this little worke out of Italian into Englishe, aswell in regarde of the new∣nesse therof, being neuer printed before that time: as also for the rarenesse of the subiect and matter it trea∣teth off, and the commoditie thar Merchants and o∣ther my Cuntrimen may reape by it. And hauing fini∣shed the same, presuming more vpon your honoura∣ble curtesie, then vpon the worthinesse of so small a woorke, and hoping of your honourable fauour for

the defence therof, I am bolde in all humble and duti∣full sort to present the same to your honourable viewe and protection, not as a thing worthy the patronage of so honorable a personage as your honour is, but as a token of my dutifull affection and bounden duty to your Lordship: beseechiug you therfore to vouchsafe of the same with so good a will as I present it vnto you. And so most humbly I take my leaue, beseeching the almightie to blesse and prosper you in all your honourable enterprises, to the good liking of her Maiesty, and profite of the Common∣weale.
