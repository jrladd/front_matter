It is not in vain to know God and the Lord Iesus Christ, but life eter∣nall, I have endeavoured in this ensuing booke to set forth some grounds and prin∣ciples of the knowledge of God and
 of Christ by way of Question and an∣swer, the easiest way I conceive) to get know∣ledge, and it may be your Honour may find it more plain and easie to be understood then other Catechismes, I have laboured herein to set forth, how and after what manner a poor sinner comes to be justified, and how he walks being justified, both towards God and man, as also something concerning the destruction of antichrist, and the felicity of the Church for ever, with other things necessary to be known of us in these times.
It may be you may find in the reading of it some things you never heard of before, both profitable and comfortable if your Honour shall be pleased to accept of this my poore labour, J shall take it as a great favour, and shall be obliged to remain
