My Noble Lord,
YOur many favours oblige me, and your high Concerns in the Ad∣miralty, encourage me humbly to offer this Discourse, such as it is, at Your Lordships feet. I can say little of its suitableness to a Person of your great Quality, and less of its Worth: But if your Lordship shall please to accept of these Prolusions, I will hereafter endeavour something more worthly your Lordships no∣tice, that I may at once give testimony of
 my thankfulness for the favours already received, and demonstrate how much I am,
Noble Patron,
Leigh in Essex, Nov, 21. 1682.
