My Lord,
THESE ensuing
Discourses intitle
their Original to
the noble indu∣stry,
and affection to Truth
of an Illustrious Person; and
to the great and worthy

Ingenuity of a Persian
stranger, lately amongst us,
from whose mouth I have
received the two following
first Narrations, and from
whom I have been abun∣dantly
satisfied, that the
Particulars are of un∣doubted
Verity. For the
Third and Last, which con∣cerns
the Story of that Im∣pudent
Iew, it will need
little Analogy; since it pro∣ceeds
not onely from an
Eye-witness, but from the
hand of a Person, who has
already gratified the Pub∣lique
with the Fruit of ma∣ny

rare and excellent Obser∣vations,
and which becomes
due to your Lordship upon a
just claim; so as your Lord∣ship
having been so pleas'd
with the first Relation, can∣not
be less with the following,
though I should never have
presum'd to be their deferent
in this unpolish'd dress, had I
not receiv'd some assurances
of your pardon.
It will doubtless appear
very strange, that Impostures
of this magnitude should so
long abuse the World, were
there no other Interest in it
than the vanity of the Per∣sons,

who assume to them∣selves
the Titles: Whatever
the reason of it be; Here we
have matter of Fact; and it
was more than time the
World should at last be dis∣abus'd,
which has been so
long impos'd on, and even la∣bour'd
under the common
Mistake, That, the cause of
this obstinate War and Quar∣rel
'twixt the Turk and the
Venetian was grounded onely
upon the taking of Sultan
Osmon and his Mother (pre∣tended
Son and Wife of Sultan
Ibrahim) by the Gallies of
Malta. This was, my Lord,

the believed Report at my be∣ing
at Venice the very Year
this Action fortun'd; and it
has since gain'd credit, and
fill'd our Ears, and all the
Histories of this Age, as a
thing unquestionable; but, with
what pretence of truth, these
Papers will both inform
your Lordship, and give day
to some other Passages wor∣thy
the Notice of Inquisitive
men, and of a Conjuncture so
seasonable for it; while the
Eyes and Thoughts of all Eu∣rope
are intent upon the suc∣cess
of Candia. What con∣cerns
the Valachian Vagrant

will be a service both to His
Majesty and other Christian
Princes, whom this bold Im∣postor
has had the front to
abuse; but eripitur Perso∣na
—the Mask is now off,
and I have no more to add,
than that of being
My Lord,
