Right Honourable;
I Did not design that the following Sermon should have been other∣wise publick than from the Pulpit; but since you have been pleased to think it worthy of being so from the Press, I humbly recommend it to your Pa∣tronage;
and have no more to do, but to beseech Almighty God, that it may prosper in the work whereunto it is sent, and that every one that shall read it, may reap some benefit by it. Which is the hearty desire of.
Right Honourable,
