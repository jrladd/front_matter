My LORD,
IT was no Interest or Expectation
of mine, that induced me to De∣dicate
this Discourse to your
Grace. I am not so well conceited of
my own Performances, as to think it
merits to be inscribed to so Great a
Name, much less that I should Oblige
your Lordship, or indeed a far meaner
Person by such Inscription. My prin∣cipal

motive was, that it would give me
opportunity of Congratulating with the
Sober Part of this Nation, your Ad∣vancement
to the Archiepiscopal Di∣gnity;
and of acknowledging His
Majesty's Wisdom in making choice of
so fit a Person to fill that Chair, en∣dued
with all Qualifications requisite
for so high a Calling; so able and
skilful a Pilot to govern the Church,
and so prudent and faithful a Counsellor
to serve Himself. But I will not enlarge
in your just Praises, lest I should incur
the unjust Censure or Suspicion of Flat∣tery:
Give me leave only to add, what
I may without injury of Truth, and I
think without violation of Modesty;
that your Grace's Election hath the
concurrent Approbation and Applause of

all good Men that know you, or have
had a true Character of you; which
may serve to strengthen your Hands
in the Management and Administra∣tion
of so difficult a Province, though
you need no such Support, as being
sufficiently involved and armed by your
Vertues, and protected by the Almighty
Power and Providence▪ Those that
are Good and Wise are pleased and
satisfied, when Great Men are pre∣ferred
to Great Places; and think it
pity that Persons of large and pub∣lick
Spirits should be confined to nar∣row
Spheres of Action, and want
Field to exercise and employ those rich
Talents and Abilities wherewith they
are endowed, in doing all the Good
they are thereby qualified and inclined
to do.
