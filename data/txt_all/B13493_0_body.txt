SIR, the multitude of Writers in our age hath begotten a scarcitie of Pa∣trons. And Poësie is growne so fre∣quent, that it may say with Niobe, inopemse copia fecit: when it owne communitie hath brought it into contempt. Insomuch that being about to publish these slight Com∣posures, which haue so far ore-leaven'd my disposition, addicted to nothing lesse then popularitie; that notwithstanding my desire to suppresse it, yet rupto iecore exire caprificus, I was compelled with Catullus, Quoi do no∣vum
at illepidum libellum, when I could not thinke of any that would be so partiall as to think has nugas esse aliquid: seeing that now∣adaies Thespis cannot act without the repre∣hension of Solon: And most men, like super∣cilious Cato's, ever censure verse to be loose, though it be never so strictly restrain'd with∣in the limits of vntainted numbers: Till at last, through the happy knowledge of your selfe, I resolu'd to make intrusion ambitious to you, from whom I could not choose but conceiue encouragement, when your ela∣borate lines doe promise you to fauour that in others, which others admire in you. I could here enter into a discourse of your de∣serued praises, but that I know it cannot bee acceptable to an ingenuous disposition; and I finde it a burthen intolerable for an vnable quill. Neither can Alexander disgest the soo∣things of Aristobulus, neither will he suffer a∣ny to portray out his stature but Policletus. Sith then I cannot like Protogenes, iudge tru∣ly de lineis Apellaeis, I wil passe ouer that in si∣lence which wold surpasse all my indevours. It is all I seeke, if the aboundance of your
worth may take away any thing from the vn∣worthinesse of my imperfect labors. And if that laurell, doctae frontis praemia, which sha∣dowes your temples, shall proue to me as Naturalists report to all, , I will not feare the tyrannies of our censuring times; but whilest other Nightingales boast the sufficiency of their Musick to coment it selfe; this onely shall excuse her scritching by being the bird of Pallas. To whose prote∣ction in you, I commit both it and my selfe.
