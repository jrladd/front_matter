MADAM,
IF in adventuring to lay this little
Piece at your Highnesses Feet, and
humbly beg your Royal Protection
of it, I have presum'd too far, be pleas'd
to impute it to your own, most graci∣ous
Goodness, the knowledge of which
encourag'd me. Our Sex are by Na∣ture
tender of their own Off-spring,
and may be allow'd to have more
fondness for those of the Brain, then
any other; because they are so few,
and meet with so many Enemies at
their first appearance in the World.
I hope therefore to find pardon, if like
an indulgent Parent, I have endea∣vour'd
to advance my first Born, by
entering it very early into your High∣nesses
Service.

I have not presum'd to approach
your Highness out of any Confidence
in the merits of this Essay, but of the
Cause which it pleads, wherein the
Honour of the whole Sex seem'd to
exact of me no less a Patronage than
that of the Best, as well as Greatest
among 'em, whom they are all am∣bitious
to see at their head. I have
only endeavour'd to reduce the Sexes
to a Level, and by Arguments to
raise Ours to an Equallity at most
with the Men: But your Highness
by Illustrious Example daily convin∣ces
the World of our Superiority,
and we see with wonder, Vertues in
you, Madam, greater than your Birth.
In this I am peculiarly happy, that I
am exempted from the common Task
of other Dedicators, who lie under
an Obligation to publishing to the
World those Excellencies of their
Patrons, which perhaps appear no
where but in their Epistles. In me
it were as great folly, to pretend to

make known the Illustrious Qualli∣ties
of your Highness, as it wou'd be
to go about to demonstrate by Ar∣gument,
that the Sun shin'd, to a
Crowd that are warm'd by the Influ∣ence
of it.
I had attempted the Character of
a consummate Woman, could I, tho'
but faintly have shaddow'd the ini∣mitable
Graces of you Highness; but
the impossibillity of that Task forc'd
me to desist. It were easy here to
lanch into those glorious particulars,
which affirmed of any other than
your Royal Highness, would have
been extravagance of Flattery; but
to you Injustice, and in me the high∣est
presumption, to attempt with my
feeble Hand those Perfections, which
the ablest must fall infinitely short
of. The lustre of your Royal Vertues,
Madam, like the Sun, gives us
warmth and light, and while at a
modest distance we admire it, im∣proves
our sight, which too bold a

view confounds, yet the meanest and
most ignorant see those Glories,
which the most exquisite Artist can
never express. The World therefore
will rather justify than comdemn my
conduct, if I do not wrong so bright
an Original with a dark obscure Copy.
Madam, Tho' the world may con∣demn
my performance, it must ap∣plaud
my choice in this Address, and
own that had I known as well how to
Argue, as to Instance, I must infalli∣bly
have Triumph'd over all Opposi∣tion.
It may be easie to evade, or
bastle the force of my Arguments,
but it is impossible without the ut∣most
Stupidity, and Injustice to deny
the manifest Advantages of those
Illustrious Graces, which raise your
Highness so far above theirs as well
as your own Sex. In this I have im∣itated
the conduct of prudent Gene∣rals,
who, when they doubt the
sufficiency of their strength, retire
to some strong Fort, and rest se∣cure

under the Protection of it.
There is yet another Reason, Madam,
which tho' the least justifiable, was
nevertheless most prevalent with me
to devote this Essay to your Highness.
My Ambition to shew the profound
Respects I have always had for your
Highness, would not suffer me to let
slip any occasion of expressing it, e∣ven
tho I blush for the meanes of it.
Thus I find my self reduc'd by my
Zeal, to the condition of poor Te∣nants,
who must expose their Pover∣ty,
to shew their Affection to their
Lord in a worthless Present. I am
sensible of the rashness of my Ambi∣tion
in aspiring to the Patronage of
Your Highness, and the need I have
of an Apology; but were I able to
make one as I ought, I should have
taken care to have had less occasion
for it. Yet I doubt not from Your
Goodness that Indulgence, which I
cannot expect from Your Justice,
nor but that you will (like Heaven,

whose more immediate Images Prin∣ces
are) accept my unprofitable Ser∣vice,
for the sincerity with which it
is tender'd. If my unfeign'd Sub∣mission
may procure pardon for my
Presumption, that Your Happiness
may equal Your illustrious Vertues,
and Your Royal Person be as far
out of the reach of Fortune, as your
Fame and Honour of Detraction,
shall ever be the prayers of
Madam,
Your Royal Highness's
most Humble, most
Obedient, and most
Devoted Servant
