MOST GRATIOVS SOVERAIGNE
AMongst the many comforts of my Ministery, to the
embracing wher∣of, Almightie God was pleased, to mooue the heart of
your Maiesties blessed Father, of holy memory, to mooue mine,
this is a great one, That your Maiesty is pleasd some 
 times, not only to receiue into your selfe, but to
returne, vnto others, my poore Meditations, and so by your
gracious commandement of publishing them, to make your selfe as a
Glasse, (when the Sun it selfe is the Gospell of
Christ Jesus) to re∣flect, & cast them vpon your
Sub∣iects. It was a Metaphor in which, your Maiesties
Blessed Father seemd to delight; for in the name of a
Mirroir, a Looking Glasse, he sometimes presented
Himselfe, in his publique declarations & spee∣ches to his
People; and a continu∣ed Metaphor is an Allegory,
and holds in more. So your Maiestie doth more of the offices of
such a Glasse; You doe that office which Moses his
Glasses did, at the Bra∣zen Sea in the Temple,
(for you  show others their spots, and in a Pious and
vnspotted life of your owne, you show your Subiects their
deficiences) And you doe the other office of such Glasses, by
this communicating to all, the beames which your Maiestie re∣ceiud
in your selfe. Wee are in Times when the way to Peace is
Warre, but my Profession leades not me to those Warres;
And wee are in Times when the Peace of the Church, may
seeme to implore a kinde of Warre, of Debatements and
Conferences in some points; but my disposition leades mee not to
that Warre neither. For in this Sermon, my onely purpose
was, that no By-stander, should bee hurt, whilest the
Fray lasted, with either Opinion. And that your 
Maiestie accepts it so your selfe, & so reflects it vpon
others, I hum∣bly beseech your Maiestie to ac∣cept also this
Sacrifice of Thanks∣giuing, for that, From
