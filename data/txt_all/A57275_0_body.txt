Gentlemen,
'TIS notoriously storyed of Demosthenes, That being to make an Oration before King Philip, he stumbled in the very threshold▪
Not that I put you in the Scale with the King; or my self with the Orator: but that which so much disheartened him, animates me, (viz.) Your Greatness. As on the one hand I have not run out of the Pulpit into the Sea, pretending Directions, (or any thing like them) towards Navigation; but only that which is always necessary, true stanch Loyalty, and that which holds (at least ana∣logically) among all creatures.

So on the other I heartily desire your fa∣vourable Patronage to this honest design, of spreading Loyalty as far as the Name of Piety may reach.
I must Confess self-interest prompts this desire; for thus I shall be secure from the value of those Censures, which (like a fog) may arise from the lower and ever prejudicial sort of People: but this, I hope, may be as voluntary in You, such eminent instances of Loyalty, as advantageous to me, who pressed the Necessity of a Plus Ultra.
I avoid Tediousness, being in few words▪
Honoured Gentlemen,
