SIR, when you
first wished me
to reade this
Discourse, (cō∣mending
it as a worke, no
lesse scholerlike then reli∣gious)
I was thinking how
I might some way requite
with somewhat more then
verball thankfulnes, your
kind fauors & good wishes

towards me. But hauing
perused the same, I
thought I could not better
employ my time of small
emploiment, then to tran∣slate
the same, as being a
subiect fit for all men seri∣ouslie
to meditate vpon,
supplying with my willing
but poore endeuour, that
which you could haue bet∣ter
polished; and I dare say
willinglie would, by reason
of your familiar acquain∣tance
with the Author, if
your leisure might haue
serued you to haue taken it
in hand your selfe. There∣fore
as you commended it
vnto me, for a peece neatly

and eloquentlie done in
the originall: so surelie it
did rauish me in the rea∣ding,
as being a most wor∣thie
theame; and hath em∣boldned
me to recommend
it backe againe vnto you,
thus homelie apparelled in
our mother tong; in which
it can leese but litle grace,
being in it selfe so graci∣ous
as it is. Suffer it ther∣fore
I pray you (if it be not
too full of defects) to passe
vnder your name, who
best deserue herin, if ought
there be deseruing. For
mine owne part, I wil onlie
say, I haue striued to shew
some part of the paines,

I would gladlie take to do
you anie pleasing seruice
in requitall of your manie
fauours; which I will pray
you still to continue, as I
will alwaies endeuor to be
thankfull, and constant∣lie
rest
