RIGHT HO∣norable
AMong so many braue and excellent qualities which haue enriched that vertuous minde of yours, knowing the same also to be much delighted with that of Musicke, which peraduenture no lesse then any of the rest hath beene to it as a ladder to the intelligence of higher things: Lo here vppon I haue presumed to make offer to the same of these simple Compositions of mine! Imitating (Right Honorable) in this, the custome of that olde world, who wanting incense to offer vp to their Godds, made shift in steade thereof to honour them with Milk. Or as those who beeing not able to present a torch vnto the hollie Alters; in signe of their deuotion, did light a little candle, and gaue vp the same. In which notwithstanding did shine more cleerely the affection of the giuer then the worth or value of the guift it selfe. May it so therefore please your Honor to accept of this smal present with that good intention wher∣with I offer it. Beeseeching therwithall the Almightie to graunt you the accomplishment of all your honorable desires. London, the xij. of October. 1595.
Your Honors deuoted in all dutie.
