Sir:
I Heere present you with a Sermon, whose concepti∣on, birth and being, pro∣ceeded from your renow∣med Father, as from the sweet influence of a bright shining star in the celestiall Orbe, on which the eyes of all vertuously disposed were e∣uer firmely fixed, euen to admiration; wher∣fore it being now brought foorth, sues for safe protection vnder you his Sonne, and hopes to receiue fauourable acceptance from you, being the knowne patron to goodnesse. Tis the paucity of such, which makes glori∣ous
 vice so audaciously impudent as to dare giue affront to bashfull vertue, that it be∣comes inglorious. If any encrease of heauen∣ly knowledge and celestiall comfort may accrew to your soule from it, giue God the prayse, and the Authour is satisfied. So with my prayers to God for continuance, and multiplication of heauenly and earthly bles∣sings vpon you, I rest

From my Chamber in Kings Colledge in Cambridge.
Nou. 18. 1628.
