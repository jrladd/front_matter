Most Honourable, and truly honoured,
BE pleased (I most humbly beseech you) to receive by the hands of another, what my present infirmities of body, and poverty of condition, will not permit me to present unto your Honours by mine own. The following Petition, and certain Quae∣res annexed thereto; both occasioned by the late Ordinance for the ejecting of scandalous, igno∣rant, and insufficient Ministers and School-ma∣sters. An Ordinance deserving your strictest ex∣amination, as being suggested to his Highnesse by some grand, but close underminers of the Protestant Religion, for the utter extirpation of the Ministery thereof out of this Nation, and
therefore already taken (as I am informed) into your most pious consideration, as a work most be∣seeming you and your known zeal and affection to the said Religion. And if the said Petition, and Quaers may contribute ought, though never so lit∣tle to that great and glorious work, I shall give God all the glory of it; as I shall never cease to supplicate him for his assisting you therein, and crowning your endeavours with an happy and honourable successe. I have caused both the Peti∣tion and Quaeres to be Printed, and taken the best order I could, at this distance with the Stationer, to whose care I committed the Printing of them, that your Honours might have each of you a per∣fect Copy, to the intent that you might by your selves in your retirements, as well as joyntly in your Assembly (if you see cause) peruse and scan every part and clause thereof. And if after such a perusal, your Honours shall finde (as I trust you will) nothing therein either repugnant or prejudicial to truth, and the zealous and pru∣dential propugning thereof, or unbeseeming the propugner, or unworthy of your Honours appea∣ring for; I humbly begge your further recom∣mending them (if you shall think fit to a more publique view, either of his Highnesse 
any other, with what advantage your better Judgements, and more inflamed zeal to Gods glory, and the true Reformed Religion shall prompt you to. But if they obtain no other favor but the being read by you, I shall repute it no small recompence, as well as honour to have such witnesses of my being really studious, and co¦dially desirous to defend and maintain, to the utmost of my weak power and ability, the said true Reformed Protestant Religion established in the Church of England, against all the ene∣mies and oppugners thereof; as also against what∣soever scandalls, reproaches, or aspersions they can cast on it. And that as readily and willingly now in these times of frenzy and madnesse on the one hand, as heretofore in those of imprudence and incogitancy on the other. And perhaps the known adversaries of our Religion (whose heads have been and still are very busie in all the designs and contrivances against it, though they have and doe make use of others hands to act by) may lose a great part of their present de∣signe, if they be not wholly frustrated, by this single appearance of one poor stripling of the Church of England; it being known to them and to the world, that (notwithstanding the fall
of so many thousand able and eminent professors and repugners of the same Religion, by their Jesuitical treacheries and conspiracies) there are yet whole Armies left of the same faith and courag, though they have not so publiquely decared themselves, nor indeed might without curring some censure, which they are desirous to avoid. Howsoever, if that stripling be but encouraged with your approbation (as he hath reason from former mercies and deliverances to hope for Gods assistance) he shall willingly ha∣zard himself in the defence of his Religion; and, upon reasonable warning, will be ready with his Shepherds Scrip, and Pastoral Instru∣ments, (though he be sequestred from his flock) to encounter with any Philistine, to whom your Honours shall send or call forth.
