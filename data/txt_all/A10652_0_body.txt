Sir,
SAint Hierom ha∣ving
in the heate
of his Youth writ∣ten
an allegoricall
Exposition upon
the Prophet Oba∣diah,Hieron. in Pro∣oem. ad Obad.
did in his riper Age solemn∣ly
bewaile unto his Friend Pam∣machius
both his rashnesse in that
attempt, aud his infelicity further
heerein, that what hee thought had
beene buried amongst his private
papers, was gotten into the hands of

a certaine Young man, and so saw
the Light. The selfe same com∣plaint
am I forced to make tou∣ching
this little Manuell of Sa∣cramentall
Meditations, which
I humbly put into your hands. It
was written with respect onely to
mine owne private use many yeares
since, when I was a young Student
in the Vniversity, as my first Theo∣logicall
Essay. And now lately, by
meanes of a private Copy long agoe
communicated unto a Friend, it had
without my knowledge received a
Licence for the Presse, my earnest
care was upon the first notice thereof
wholly to have suppressed the Pub∣lication:
but the Copy which had
beene licenced, being, by I know not
what miscarriage lost, I have found

it necessary, for feare of the like in∣convenience
againe to review a bro∣ken
Copy which I had by mee, and
have rather chosen to let it passe
forth with some briefe and sudden
Castigations of mine owne, than
once more runne the hazard of a
surreptitious Edition. Mine Apo∣logy
shall bee no other than that of
the good father, Infanseram, nec
dum scribere noveram. Nunc,
ut nihil aliud profecerim, saltem
Socraticum illud habeo, scio
quod nescio. And now since I
finde that the Oblation of the first
fruits, though haply they were not
alwayes the best and ripest, did yet
finde favourable acceptance with
God himself, I have bin embolden'd
to present this small Enchiridion,

(the very first fruits of my Theo∣logicall
studies) unto the hands and
patronage of so greatly learned, e∣loquent,
and judicious a person, and
that upon this assurance; That as
many times aged men when they
walke abroad leane upon the hand of
a little Childe, so even in this little
and youthfull Treatise, such com∣fortable
Trueths may bee, though
weakly, delivered, as may help n
your journey towards a better Coun∣try
to refresh and sustaine your aged
thoughts. The Blood of Christ, and
the Food of Life,2 Reg. 5. 2, 3. are subjects worthy
of all acceptation, though brought
unto us in an earthen vessell. Eli∣sha
was not a whit the lesse valued
by that noble Naaman,2 Sam. 17. 17. though it
were an handmaid which directed

unto him.1 Sam. 30. 13. Neither was Davids
comfort in rescuing of his Wives,
and recovering of the spoiles from
the Amalakites any jot the smaller
because a yong man of Egypt made
way for the discovery. The Sove∣raignty
of the Gospell is herein most
excellently set forth in that it many
times leadeth the Soule by the hand
of a childe,Isai 1. 6. and is as truly,1 Tim. 4. 12. though
not as abundantly powerfull from
young Timothy as from Paul the
aged. As christ can use weake ele∣ments
to exhibite, so can hee also use
a weake penne to expresse the ver∣tue
and comforts of his Body and
Blood. In this confidence I have
made bold to prefixe your name be∣fore
these Meditations, that there∣in
I might make a publike acknow∣ledgement

of my many and deepe
engagements for your abundant fa∣vours,
and might with most hearty
prayers commend you and yours to
that Blood of sprinckling, which
speaketh better things for us than
that of Abe. In which desires I
daily remaine,
