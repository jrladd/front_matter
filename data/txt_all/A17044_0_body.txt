Right Honourable, and my very good Lord;
I Could never have thought these Sermons, or any thing else com∣ming from me, worthy the view of so learned an Age. Neither have I ever shunned ought more, then to come in publike. Yet I know not how it now happen∣eth, that I am at this present drawen forth into open view: urged, partly by the advice and
 earnest request of some good friends, who judged these Sermons, when preached, necessary for these times; partly by the mistake of some, other∣wise (I doubt not) well affected Christians, who neverthelesse not well understanding my mean∣ing, have misreported both it and me. To sa∣tisfie both, I deemed this the best way: neces∣sary also perhaps, besides other reasons, hereby to prevent the publishing of them by any other hand, since some Copies have gone abroad, not through any desire of mine, but by the request of those friends I could not gainsay. That I pre∣sent them to your Lordship, is not without great good reason: you not onely having beene a chiefe Auditour at the preaching of some of them; but also, which I may never forget, nor can suffici∣ently recount, being my most noble, free, and bountifull Patron. Wherefore I could not, but here follow the example of our Blessed LORD and SAVIOUR, joyning the remembrance of Mary's Spikenard with the Gospell prea∣ched; that is, with these Sermons sent abroad into the World, the thankefull acknowledg∣ment of your Honours bounty. For since in our bookes and writings wee honourably men∣tion
 those Worthyes in Learning, whose more able studies have furthered or advanced ours; wee should, by as good reason, inscribe our books or writings to those Noble Personages, worthy of all Honour, whose rightly imployed wealth or power have (under GOD) supported, up∣held, or encouraged our otherwise disheartned studies. Thence Gratitude hath made it a custome with us, even anciently practised by sundry Heathen, that where Honourable great∣nesse and goodnesse hath by any nourished the life and sappe of Learning for the present, there by a due retaliation Learning and Arts should honor and eternize their memories to all future Ages: that thus they, by whom we live now, may by us or ours in an happy and blessed memoriall, live for ever. I cannot promise your Honour by this poore worke any such lasting monument: nor am I one of those that can any way arrogate that title to my selfe: My desire onely is, hereby to acknowledge to the World, how much I am your Lordships; that seeing I appeare in publike, I may stirre up others, if any shall receive any benefit by my poore labours, to praise and pray GOD for your Noble Lordship: Whilst I
 shall alwayes pray and beseech His Heavenly Majestie, to blesse your Honour, your Noble Lady, Children, and Familie with all increase of Heavenly Ioyes, and earthlie happinesse, Re∣maining whilst I live.
