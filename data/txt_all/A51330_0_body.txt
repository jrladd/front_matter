MADAM:
THe many obligements in which I acknowledge my selfe tyed unto your ho∣nours honourable hus∣band (who hath been Gods gracious in∣strument in preserving me from the unjust oppression of the perverse; though I be not repaired in my suffe∣rings) have made me humbly to presentunto your Honour (as a true token of a gratefull minde) this little Tractate; short, as might be, shunning obscurity; and plaine according to my best possibi∣lity. Though Momus carp, I care not: The Word of God is not bound. Receive, honourable Lady, this mite from him who daily doth plead at the Throne of Grace for your honours ho∣nourable husband, for your honou∣rable Ladiship; And happy hopefull Children: And who is really,
Madam,
