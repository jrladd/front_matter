I Print not this Play before it is Acted, to make it more Publick, but onely more Legible for those who are to judge of it; who, if they like it in this Undress, will much more in its Theatrical Habit: And if every one who writes for the Stage, would do the like, the Actors would not vent so many Plays on credit of their Au∣thors, nor the Authors of themselves. Nor is there any danger (Printing it as I do) that it should loose the grace of Novelty, I intending to communicate it onely to a few; and I have seen many Manuscripts more publick, than this is ever like to be.
The Plot, I have taken the hint of, from La Costanza di Rosamondo, of Aurelio Aureli, the fittest for our English Stage, and fullest

of delightful variety, as I could finde in any Foreign Tongue.
The Writing or Language, I have accom∣modated to the Persons, Verse; for the more Heroick, and Prose, for the rest, with often allay of this with the other, to make it more flexible, which else would be too stiff.
For the Rhyme, which is onely the finishing of our Verse, and which our English Ears by Custom do so expect, as they will scarcely allow Verses to be compleat without it, I will not commend it, because it has so many Potent Enemies; nor condemn it, because it has so many Potent Friends, but leave it to others judgments, as I do all the rest.
