THis that I now humbly offer to your hands, hath been long in my thoughts; but much more since in my atten∣dance on his Majesties Children, I have (under the incouragements and particular favours of the Right Ho∣nourable my Lord the Earl of Nor∣thumberland, to whose care You have intrusted those Royall pledges,) read thorow the whole Bible in an exposito∣ry way. I have high thoughts of the sacred authority of Scripture, I admire the wisedom of the whole, and the ad∣mirable concent of all the parts of it, and doe firmly believe that the majesty of it will triumph over the attempts of
all Anti-Scripturists to the contrary, till the time of our Lords coming again. 'Tis the glory of Christian States to maintain and advance it, which was the meaning of those learned men, who have lately enriched the world with that treasury of the King of France his Bi∣ble in 10. Volumes, where in one Fron∣tispiece they have represented a Table of the Portraicture of Cardinal Maza∣rine, supported and mounted by Angels, as being a great Patron of that renow∣ned labour. May your Names also be great unto posterity, whilst you pro∣mote the glory of God, and the saving knowledge of men, by works of this nature. The learned Licenser inti∣mates the difficulty of this, I also ac∣knowledge it, but withall I nothing doubt, but under such an influence as yours it may grow to a full maturity.
