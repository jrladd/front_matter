May it please Your Highness;
THE Design of these few Sheets being to show the excellency and usefulness of the English Tongue, I humbly conceiv'd they could not be more properly ad∣dress'd to any than to Your Highness, whose Interest and Concern in the Ho∣nour and Dignity of Your Native Lan∣guage, is much greater than of any o∣ther whomsoever.

And I hope I have made it appear, beyond contradiction, in this Essay, that the English Tongue is as capable of all the Art and Elegancies of Grammar and Rhetorick, as Greek or Latin, or any other Language in the World, whether Antient or Modern: and if so, it seems to be contrary to Sense and Reason, as well as to Antiquity, to put English Youth to toil in any Forein Tongue whatever for the attainment of good Learning, while their own Excellent Language lies neglected and uncultivated, as bar∣barous, and unfit for the entertainment of the Liberal Arts and Sciences.
If we polish and adorn our Native Language with good Literature, as the Antients always did theirs, then it will cultivate and accomplish us more than all the Forein Languages in the World can do: Nor will this be any hindrance to the learning of Forein Tongues, but on the contrary be the most effectual means of acquiring them speedily and easily that can be imagined.
All Aristotle's Literature was in his Mother-Tongue, and perhaps he knew no other; yet King Philip did so much
admire him for his great Learning, that he writ to him in these words: I thank the Gods, not so much on the account that a Son is born to me, as that it is his good hap to be born in thy Life-time; for I hope that after he is perfectly instructed by thee, he may be worthy of us, and of so great a Kingdom. And Alexander him∣self was so sensible of the inestimable benefit of Aristotle's Vernacular Educa∣tion, that he lov'd him no less than he did his Father Philip.
It is Your Highness's great happi∣ness, that You have an Alexander and an Aristotle to write after: and may the Great Example of the One excite You to the imitation of those Heroic Atchiev∣ments, that all Languages are little e∣nough to express; and the Learning of the Other fit You, like Caesar, to write Your own Commentaries.
If these small Beginnings of a Learn∣ed English Education, which is so much for the Honour and Advantage of all English-men, be favourably enter∣tained by Your Highness, and the Nation, the Author will be encou∣raged to proceed to some further
Improvements of what he has begun for the Publick Good. And who knows but the reviving of this piece of the best Antiquity has been reserv'd for Your Highness's Times, whose great Ge∣nius, and early Advances in Learning, to∣gether with so Great a Conduct, do all concur to raise the Hopes and Expecta∣tions of the Nation, that Your Highness may (by the Favour of Heaven) prove a most Learned and Virtuous Prince, an Ornament to the Royal Family, and a great Blessing to Your native Coun∣try? And that Your Highness may eve∣ry day more and more increase and confirm these Hopes to the Joy of all Good Men, is the most ardent prayer of,
Most Illustrious Prince,
