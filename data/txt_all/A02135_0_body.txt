CVrteous, and wise, whose iudgements (not
entangled with enuy) enlarge the deserts
of the learned, by your liberall censures:
vouchsafe to welcome your Scholler-like
Shepherd, with such Vniuersitie entertain∣ment,
as either the nature of your bounty,
or the custome of your common ciuility may affoord. To
you he appeales that knew him ab extrema pueritia, whose
placet hee accounts the plaudite▪ of his paines: thinking his
day-labour was not altogether lauisht siue linea, if there be
any thing at al in it, that doth olere Atticum in your estimate.
I am not ignorant how eloquent our gowned age is grown
of late, so that euery Mechanicall mate abhorreth the En∣glish
he was borne to, and plucks with a solemne periphra∣sis,
his vt vales from the inke-horne: which I impute, not so
much to the perfection of Arts, as to the seruile imitation of
vaine-glorious Tragdians, who contend▪ not so seriously to
excell in action, as to embowell the cloudes in a speech of
comparison, thinking themselues more then initiated in
Poets immortality, if they but once get Boreas by the beard,
and the heauenly Bull by the deaw-lap. But herein I can∣not
so fully bequeath them to folly, as their ideot Art-ma∣sters,
that iude themselues to our eares, as the Alcumists
of eloquence, who (mounted on the stage of arrogance)
thinke to out-braue better Pes with the swelling bum∣bast
of bragging blanke verse. Indeede, it may bee, the in∣grafted
ouer ow of some kil  cōceit, that ouer-cloyeth

their imagination with a more then drunken resolution, be∣ing
not extemporall in the inuention of any other meanes
to vent their man-hood, commits the disgestion of their
cholericke incumbrances, to the spacious volubilitie of a
drumming decasillabon. Mongst this kinde of men, that re∣pose
eternitie in the mouth of a Player, I can but ingrosse
some deep-read Schoolemen or Grammarians, who hauing
no more learning in their skull, then will serue to take vp a
commoditie, nor Art in their braiue, then was nourished in
a Seruing-mans idlenesse, will take vpon them to bee the
ironicall Censors of all, when God and Poetrie doth know
they are the simplest of all. To leaue all these to the mercy
of their Mother tongue, that feed on nought but the crums
that fall from the ranslators trencher, I come (sweet friend)
to thy Arcadian Menaphon, whose attyre (though not so
stately, yet comely) doth intitle thee aboue all other, to that
temperatum dicendi genus, which Tully in his Orator termeth
true eloquence. Let other men (as they please) praise the
Mountayne that in seuen yeeres bringeth forth a Mouse, or
the Italianate Pen, that of a packet of pilfris, affoords the
Presse a pamphlet or two in an Age, and then in disguised
array vaunts Ouids and Plutarchs plumes as their owne:
but giue mee the man, whose extemporall veine in any hu∣mour,
will excell our greatest Art-Masters deliberate
thoughts, whose inuentions quicker then his eye, will chal∣lenge
the prowdest Rhetorician, to the contention of like
perfection, with like expedition.
What is he among Students so simple, that cannot bring
foorth (tanquam aliquando) some or other thing singular,
sleeping betwixt euery sentence? What is not Maroes
twelue yeeres toyle, that so famed his twelue Aeneidos? Or
Peter Ramus sixteene yeeres paines, that so praised his petty
Logicke? How is it then, our drowping wits should so
wonder at an exquisite line, that was his Masters day-la∣bour?
Indeede I must needs say, the descending yeeres from
the Philosophers Athens, haue not beene supplied with such
present Orators, as were able in any English veine to be elo∣quent

of their owne, but either they must borrow inuention
of Ariosto, & his countrimen, take vp choice of words by ex∣change
in Tullies Tusculans, & the Latine Historiographers
store-houses, similitudes, nay whole sheets, & tractates ver∣batim,
from the plentie of Plutarch and Plinie: and to con∣clude,
their whole methode of writing, from the libertie of
Comicall fictions, that haue succeeded to our Rhetoricians
by a second imitation; so that wel may the Adage, Nil dictum
quod non dictum prius, bee the most iudiciall estimate of our
latter Writers. But the hunger of our vnsatiate humorists,
being such as it is, ready to swallow all draffe without diffe∣rence,
that insinuates it selfe to their senses vnder the name
of delights, imploies ofttimes many thredbare wits, to emp∣tie
their inuention of their Apish deuices, and talke most su∣perficially
of Policie, as those that neuer ware gowne in the
Vniuersitie; wherein they reuiue the old said Adage, Sus
Mineruam, and cause the wiser to quippe them with Asi∣nui
ad lyram. Would Gentlemen and riper iudgements ad∣mit
my motion of moderation in a matter of folly, I would
perswade them to physicke their faculties of seeing and hea∣ring,
as the Sabaeans doe their dulled senses with smelling:
who (as Strabo reporteth) ouer-cloyd with such odoriferous
sauours as the naturall increase of their Country (Balsamum,
Amomum, with Myrrhe and Frankincense) sends forth, re∣fresh
their nostrills with the vnsauourie sent of the pitchy
flame, that Euphrates cast vp, & the cōiagíous fumes of goats
beards burned: so would I haue them, being surfeited vna∣wares
with the sweet saciety of eloquence, which the lauish
of our copious language may procure, to vse the remedie of
contraries, and recreate their rebated wits; not as they did,
with the senting of slime or Goats beards burned, but with
the ouer-seeing of that sublime dicendi genus, which walkes
abroad for waste paper in each Seruing-mans pocket, and
the otherwhile pervsing of our Gothamists barbarisme; so
should the opposite comparison of Puritie, expell the infe∣ction
of Absurditie, and their ouer-racked Rhetoricke, bee
the Ironicall recreation of the Reader.

But so farre discrepant is the idle vsage of our vnexperi∣enced
and illiterated Pues from this prescription, that a
tale of Ioane of Brainfords will, and the vnlucky Frumenty,
will be as soone entertayned into their Libraries, as the best
Poeme that euer Tasso eterniz'd: which being the effect of
an vndiscerning iudgemēt, makes drosse as valuable as gold,
and losse as wel-come as gaine; the Glow-worme mentio∣ned
in Aesops Fables, namely, the Apes folly, to be mistaken
for fire, when as God wot, poore soules, they haue nought
but their toyle for their heate, their paines for their sweat,
and (to bring it to our English Prouerbe) their labour for
their trauell. Wherein I can but resemble them to the Pan∣ther,
who is so greedy of mens excrements, that if they bee
hanged vp in a vessell higher then his reach, hee soone kills
himselfe with the ouer-stretching of his windlesse body,
then hee will cease from his intended enterprise. Oft haue I
obserued what I now set downe: a secular wit that hath li∣ued
all dayes of his life by, what doe you lack? to be more
iudiciall in matters of conceit, then our quadrant crepun∣dious,
that spit ergo in the mouth of euery one they meete:
yet those and these are affectionate to dogged detracting,
as the most poysonous Pasquils, any durty-mouthed Mar∣tin,
or Momus euer composed, is gathered vp with greedi∣nesse,
before it fall to the ground, and bought at the dearest,
though they smell of the Priplers lauender, halfe a yeee af∣ter
or I know not how the minde of the meanest is ed
with this folly, that they impute singularitie, to him that
slanders priuily, and count it a great piece of Art in an inke∣horne
man, in any Papsterly termes whatsoeuer, to expose
his Supersours to enuy. I will not deny, but in Scholer-like
matters of controuersie, a quicker stile may passe as com∣mendable,
and that a qui to an Asse is as good as a goad
to an Oxe: but when the irregular Ieot, that was vp to the
eares in , before euer hee met with probabile in the
Vnluersitle, shall leaue pro & contra, before hee ca carcely
pronouce it, and come to correct common-weales, that
neuer heard of the name of Magistrate, before hee came to

Cambridge, it is no maruaile if euery Ale-house vaunt the ∣ble
of the world turned vpside downe,  the Child bea∣teth
his Father, and the Asse whippth hi Master, Bul lest
I might seeme with these night-owe, Nimi  in a∣liena
republica, I will turne backe to my first Text of Studies
of delight, and talke a little in friendship with a few of our
triuiall Translators. It is a common practice now a dayes a∣mongst
a sort of shifting Companions, that runne through
euery Art, and thriue by none, to leaue the rade of Noe∣riut,
whereto they were borne, and busie themselues with
the indeuors of Art, that could scarcely Lnize their neck-verse,
if they should haue neede: yet English Seneca read
by Candle-light, yeelds many good sentences, as Bloud is a
begger, and so forth: and if you intreate him faire in a fro∣sty
morning, hee will affoord you whole Hamlets, I should
say, handfuls of Tragicall speeches. But, O griefe! Tempus
edx rerum, whats that will last alwayes? The Sea exhaled
by drops, will in continuance bee drie: and Seneca let
bloud  by line, and page by page, at length must needes
die to our stage; which makes his famished followers to i∣mitate
the Kid in Aesope, who enamoured with the Foxes
new-fangles, forsooke all hopes of life to leape into a new
occupation: and these men renouncing all possibilities of
credite or estimation, to intermeddle with Italian Transla∣tions:
Wherein, how poorely they haue plodded, (as those
that are neither Pouerzal-men, nor are able to distinguish
of Articles) let all indifferent Gentlemen that haue trauel∣led
in that tongue; discerne by their two-penny Pamphlets.
And no maruell though their ome-borne mediocritie bee
such in this matter; for what can bee hoped of those, that
thrust Elisium into hel, and haue not learned so long as they
haue liued in the Spheares, the iust measure of the Horizon
without an hexameter? Sufficeth them to bodge vp a blanke
verse with ifs and ands, and other while for recreation after
their Candle-stuffe, hauing starched their beards most curi∣ously,
to make a Peripateticall path into the inner parts of
the Citie, and spend two or three houres in turning ouer

French Dowdie, where they attract more infection in one
minute, then they can do eloquence all daies of their life, by
 with any Authors of like argument. But lest in
this declamatorie veins, I should condemne all, and com∣mend
none, I will propound to your learned imitation, those
men of import, that haue laboured with credite in this lau∣dable
kinde of Translation. In the forefront of whom, I can∣not
but place that aged Father Erasmus, that inuested most
of our Greeke writers in the robes of the ancient Romanes;
in whose traces Philip Melancthon, Sadolet, Plantine, and
many other reuerend Germanes insisting, haue reedified the
ruines of our decayed Libraries, and maruellously enriched
the Latine tongue with the expence of then toyle. Not long
after, their emulation being transported into England, eue∣ry
priuate Scholer, William Turner, and who not, bganne
to vaunt their mattering of Latine, in English impressions.
But amongst others in that age, Sir Thomas Eliots elegance
did seuer it selfe from al equals, although Sir Thomas Moore
with his comical wit, at that instant was not altogether idle:
yet was not knowledge fully confirmed in her Monarchy a∣mongst
vs, till that most famous and fortunate Nurse of all
learning, Saint Iohns in Cambridge, that at that time was as
an Vniuersity within it selfe, shining so farre aboue all other
Houses, Halls, and Hospitalls whatsoeuer, that no Colledge
in the Towne, was able to cōpare with the Tithe of her Stu∣dents,
hauing (as I haue heard graue men of credit report)
moe Candles light in it, euery Winter morning before foure
of the clock, then the foure of the clock Bell gaue strokes:
till she (I say) as a pittying Mother, put to her helping hand,
and sent from her ruitfull wombe, sufficient Scholers, both
to support her owne Weale, as also to supply all other infe∣riour
foundations defects, and namely, that royall crection
of Trinitie Colledge, which the Vniuersitie Orator in an E∣pistle
to the Duke o, Somerset, aptly termed Colonia deducta,
from the Suburbs of Saint Iohns. In which extraordinary
conception, Vno partis in rempublicam prodiere, the Exche∣quer
of eloquence, Sir Iohn Checke, a man of men, superna∣turally

traded in all tongues, Sir Iohn Mason, Doctor Watson,
Redman, Ascam, Grindal, Leuer,  all which haue
eyther by their priuate readings, or  workes, reur∣ged
the errours of Arte, expelled from their puritie, and set be∣fore
our eyes a more perfect methode of studie.
But how ill their precepts haue prospered with our idle
age, that leaue the fountaines of Sciences, to follow the Ri∣uers
of Knowledge, their ouer-fraught Studies, with trifling
compendiaries, may testifie: for I know not how it commeth
to passe, by the doting practice of our Diuinitie Dues, that
striue to make their Pupils pulpit-men, before they are recon∣ciled
to Priscian: but those yeeres which should be imployed
in Aristotle, are expired in Epitomies, and well too, they may
haue so much Catechisme vacation, to take vp a little refuse
Philosophy.
And heere I could enter into a large fielde of inuectiue a∣gainst
our abiect abbreuiations of Artes, were it not growne
to a new fashion among our Nation, to vaunt the pride of
contraction in euery manuarie action: insomuch, that the
Pater-noster, which was wont to fill a sheet of Paper, is writ∣ten
in the compasse of a penny: whereupon one merrily as∣sumed
that Prouerbe to be deriued, No penny, no pater noster.
Which their nice curtayling putteth mee in minde of the cu∣stome
of the Scythians, who if they had beene at any time di∣stressed
with famine, tooke in their gdles shorter, and swad∣dled
themselues straighter, to the intent, no vacuum beig left
in their intrailes, hunger should not so much tyrannize ouer
their stomackes: euen so these men oppressed with a greater
penurie of Arte, doe pound their capacitie in barren Com∣pendiums,
and bound their base humours in the beggerly
straights of a hungry Analysis, lest longing after that infinitum,
which the pouertie of their conceit cannot compasse, they
sooner yeeld vp their youth to destinie, then their heart to vn∣derstanding.
How is it then such bungling practicioners in principles,
should euer profit the Common-wealth by their negligent
paines, who haue no more cunning in Logicke or Dialogue

Latine, then appertaines to the literall construction of eyther:
neuerthelesse, it is daily apparant to our domesticall eyes, that
there is none so forward to publish their imperfections, either
in their trade of glose or translations, as those that are more
vnlearned then ignorant, and lesse conceiuing than Infants.
Yet dare I not impute absurditie to all of that societie, al∣though
some of them haue set their names to their simplicitie.
Who euer my priuate opinion condemneth as saultie, Master
Gascoigne is not to bee abridged of his deserued esteeme,
who first beate the path to that perfection which our best
Poets haue aspired to since his departure, whereto hee did
ascend, by comparing the Italian with the English, as Tully
did Graeca cum Latinis. Neither was M. Turberuile the worst
of his time, though in translating hee attributed too much to
the necessitie of the time. And in this page of praise, I cannot
omit aged Arthur Golding, for his industrious toyle in Eng∣lishing
Ouids Metamorphosis, besides many other exquisite e∣ditions
of diuinitie, turned by him out of the French tongue
into our owne. M. Phaer likewise is not to be forgot, in regard
of his famous Virgil, whose heauenly verse, had it not beene
blemished by his hautie thoughts, England might haue long
insulted his wit, and corrigat qui potest haue beene subscribed
to his workes. But Fortune, the Mistris of change, with a pit∣tying
compassion, respecting Master Stanihursts prayse,
would that Phaer should fall, that hee might ryse, whose he∣roicall
poetry infired, I should say inspired with an hexameter
furie, recalled to life, what euer histed Barbarisme hath been
buried this hundred yeere: and reuiued by his ragged quill
such carterly varietie, as no Hodge ploughman in a Country
but would haue held as the extremitie of clownerie: a pat∣terne
whereof I will propound to your iudgements, as neere
as I can, being part of one of his descriptions of a tempest,
which is thus.
Then did he make heauens vault to rebound,
with rounce robble bobble,
Of ruffe raffe roaring,
with thwicke thwack▪ thurlerie bouncing.

Which strange language of the firmament, neuer subiect be∣fore
to our common phrase, make vs that are not vsed to ter∣mnate
heauens mouing in the accents of any voice, esteeme
of their triobulare Interpreter, as of some Thrasonicall huffe
snuffe: for so terrible was his stile to all milde eares, as would
haue affrighted our peaceable Poets from intermedling here∣after,
with that quarrelling kinde of verse, had not sweet Ma∣ster
France, by his excellent translation of Master Thomas
Watsons sugred Amintas, animated their dulled spirits, to such
high-witted indeuours. But I know not how, their ouer-ti∣merous
cowardise hath stoode in awe of enuie, that no man
since him durst imitate any of the worst of those Romane
wonders in English: which makes me thinke, that either the
louers of mediocritie are very many, or that the number of
good Poets are very small, and in truth, (Master Watson ex∣cept,
whom I mentioned before) I know not almost any of
late dayes, that hath shewed himselfe singular in any speciall
Latine Poeme: whose Amintas, and translated Antigone, may
march in equipage of honour, with any of your ancient Po∣ets:
I will not say but we had a Haddon, whose pen vvould
haue challenged the Lawrell from Homer, together with Car
that came as neere him as Virgil to Theocritus. But Thomas
Newton with his Leiland, and Gabriel Haruey, with two or
three other, is almost all the store that is left vs at this houre.
Epitaphers, and position Poets, wee haue more then a good
many, that swarme like Crowes to a dead carcasse, but flie
like Swallowes in the Winter, from any continuate subiect
of wit.
The efficient whereof, I imagine to issue from the vpstart
discipline of our reformatoie Churchmen, who account wit
vanitie, and Poetry impietie: whose errour, although the ne∣cessitie
of Philosophie might confute, which lis couched
most closely vnder darke fables profunditie, yet I had rather
referre it as a disputatiue plea by Diuines, then set it downe as
a determinate position in my vnexperienced opinion. But
how euer their dissentious iudgements should decree in their
after-noone sessions of ansit, the priuate truth of my discoue∣red

Creede in this controuersie is this, that as that beast was
thought scarce worthy to be sacrificed to the Aegyptian Epa∣phus▪
who had not some or other blacke spot on his skin: so
I deeme him farre vnworthy the name of a scholler, and so
consequently to sacrifice his endeuours to Art, that is not a
Poet, either in whole or in part.
And heere peraduenture, some desperate quipper vvill
canuaze my purposed comparison Plus vltra, reconciling the
allusion of the blacke spot, to the blacke pot, which maketh
our Poets vndermeale Muses too mutinous, as euery stanzo
they pen after dinner, is full pointed with a stabbe. Which
their dagger drunkennesse, although it might bee excused
with tam Marti, quàm Mercurio, yet will I couer it as well as
I may with that prouerbiall foecundi cales, that might well
haue beene doore-keeper to the kanne of Sileus, when
nodding on his Asse trapped vvith Iuie, hee made his moist
nose-cloth the pausing intermedium twixt euery nappe. Let
frugall schollers, and fine-fingered nouices, take their drinke
by the ounce, and their wine by the halfe-penny worths: but
it is for a Poet to examine the pottle pots, and gage the bot∣tome
of whole gallons, qui bene vult poie in, debet ante pinion.
A pot of blew burning ale, with a fiery flaming toste, is as
good as Pallas with the nine Muses on Pernassus top: with∣out
the which, in vaine they may cry, O thou my Muse, inspire
mee with some pen, when they want certaine liquid sacrifice
to rouze her forth her denne.
Pardon mee (Gentlemen) though somewhat merrily I
glance at their immoderate folly, who affirme, that noman
writes with conceit, except hee take counsell of the cup: nor
would I haue you thinke, that Theonino dente, I arme mystile
against all, since I doe know the moderation of many Gen∣tlemen
of that studie, to bee so farre from infamie, as their
verse from equalitie: whose sufficiencie, were it as well seene
into, by those of higher place, as it wanders abroad vnre∣warded
in the mouthes of vngratefull monsters, no doubt but
the remembrance of Macenas liberalitie extended to Maro,
and men of like qualitie, would haue left no memory to that

prouerbe of pouertie, Si nihil attuleris, ibis Homere foras.
Tush, say our English Italians, the finest wits our climate sends
forth, are but drie-brained dolts in comparison of other coun∣tries:
whom if you interrupt with redde rationem; they will
tell you of Petrarch, Tasso, Celiano, with an infinite number
of others, to whom if I should oppose Chaucer, Lydgate,
Gower, with such like, that liued vnder the tyrannie of igno∣rance,
I doe thinke their best louers would bee much discon∣tented
with the collation of contraries, if I should write o∣uer
all their heads, Haile fellow, well met. One thing I am
sure of, that each of these three haue vented their meeters
with as much admiration in English, as euer the proudest A∣riosto
did his verse in Italian.
What should I come to our Court, where the other-while
vacations of our grauer Nobilitle are prodigall of more pom∣pous
wit, and choice of words, then euer tragicke Tasso
could attaine to? But as for pastorall poems, I will not make
the comparison, lest our countrimens credite should be dis∣countenanced
by the contention: who, although they cannot
fare with such inferiour facilitie, yet I know, would carry the
bucklers full easily from all forraine brauers, if their subie∣ctum
circa quod, should sauour of any thing hautie. And
should the challenge of deepe conceit be intruded by any for∣rainer,
to bring our English wits to the touchstone of Art, I
would preferre diuine Master Spencer, the miracle of wit, to
bandie line by line for my life, in the honour of England, a∣gainst
Spaine, France, Italy, and all the world. Neither is
hee the onely swallow of our Summer, (although Apollo, if
his Tripos were vp againe, would pronounce him his Socra∣tes,)
but hee being forborne, there are extant about Lon∣don,
many most able men, to reuiue Poetry, though it were
executed ten thousand times, as in Platoes, so in Puritans
Common-wealth: as namely for example, Mathew Roy∣don,
Thomas Achlow, and George Peele: the first of whom, as
he hath shewed himselfe singular in the immortall Epitaph of
his beloued Astrophell, besides many other most absolute
Comike inuentious (made more publike by euery mans

praise, then they can bee by my speech,) so the second hath
more then once or twice manifested hi deepe-witted schol∣lership
in places of credite: and for the last, though not the
least of them all, I dare commend him vnto all that know
him, as the chiefe supporter of pleasance now liuing, the
Atlas of Poetrie, and primus verborum Artifex: whose first
increase, the arraignement of Paris might pleade to your o∣pinions,
his pregnant dexteritie of wit, and manifold varie∣tie
of inuention, wherein (me iudice) hee goeth a step be∣yond
all that write. Sundry other sweete Gentlemen I doe
know, that wee haue vaunted their pens in priuate deuices,
and tricked vp a company of taffatie fooles with their fea∣thers,
whose beautie, if our Poets had not pecked with the
supply of their periwigs, they might haue antickt it vntill
this time, vp and downe the Countrey with the King of Fai∣ries,
and diued euery day at the pease-porredge ordinary with
Delfrigus.
But Tolass hath forgotten that it was sometime sacked,
and beggers, that euer they carried their fardels on footback:
and in truth no maruaile, when as the deserued reputation of
one Roscius, is of force to enrich a rabble of counterfeits: Yet
let subiects for all their insolence, dedicate a De propundis e∣uery
morning to the preseruation of their Caesar, left their
increasing indignities returne them ere long their iuggling to
mediocritie, and they bewaile in weeping blankes, the wane
of their Monarchie.
As Poetrie hath beene honoured in those her fore-named
professors, so it hath not beene any whit disparaged by
William Warners absolute Albions. And heere Authoritie
hath made a full point: in whose reuerence insisting, I cease
to expose to your sport the picture of those Pamphleters, and
Poets, that make a patrimonie of In speech, and more then
a younger brothers inheritance of their Abcie. Reade fa∣uourably,
to incourage me in the firstlings of my folly, and
perswade your selues, I will persecute those Idiots and their
heires vnto the third generation, that haue made Art banke∣rout
of her ornaments, and sent Poetry a begging vp and

downe the Countrey. It may be, my Anatomie of Absur∣dities
may acquaint you ere long with my skill in Surgerie,
wherein the diseases of Arte more merrily discouered, may
make our maimed Poets put together their blankes vnto the
building of an Hospitall.
If you chance to meet it in Paules, shaped in a new sute of
similitudes, as if like the eloquent Apprentice of Plutarch, it
were propped at seuen yeeres end in double apparell, thinke
his Master hath fulfilled couenants, and onely cancelled the
Indentures of dutie. If I please, I will thinke my ignorance
indebted vnto you that applaud it: if not, what rests,
but that I be excluded from your courtesie,
like Apocrypha from your
Bibles?
