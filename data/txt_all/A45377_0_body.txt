Reverend Sir,
I Am not so wise, as to account your Book un∣worthy
of Answer, as some too angrily do;
nor can esteem it weakness, but the contrary
rather a too great sturdiness and stoutness,
Christianly to have gone about, to shew you,
that you mistook the Ministers meaning; because I cannot
think so ill of your self, that you would wilfully go so farre
aside from their meaning, as I am confident you have done.
And I am of opinion that he himself, who hath thus forestald
other mens answers, as farre as he could, with such a censure,
should rather have civilly replied himself where he found

his Antagonist mistaken, which was but Christian duty, and
that which himself seems to acknowledge so, and promises in
another case. Yet I shall request of you, or any other of my
courteous Readers, to excuse what weakness they may find,
upon any other account, seeing this Answer was hasted, and
after twice reading of your Book only, presently and ex tem∣pore
poured forth, as you see. Ever since the Bishop of Ar∣maghs
recommending me to your acquaintance with such a
character; as he gave you, I have had a reverent opinion of
you, and found afterwards sufficient cause not to change it.
Wherefore I intreat you, Sir, that you will satisfie the world
candidly, whether you can now think, you mistook the Mini∣spers,
or no; and to do them and the truth so farre right, as
to let it be seen, that you did not, nor will not intend any
thing against the truth, nor ingenuity of mind, but for
both; and you shall anew obliege,
Sir,
From my Chamber in
Blackfriers, Lond.
Sept. 6. 1660.
Your formerly obliged
Servant in the Lord,
