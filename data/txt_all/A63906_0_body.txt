SIR,
THE Obligations for which I stand indebted to Your Goodness, are so many and so great, and the Friendship with which you have been pleased to own an unprofitable Ser∣vant, so constant, so syncere, so zealous, that I am forced to break out into this publick Resentment, rather out of necessity than deliberation or choice, to ease my self of a Load of Gratitude, which is very troublesom to me, while it keeps within and preys upon it self, without any hopes of ever being consumed, like the Torments of that miserable State to which the un∣thankful,
 as well as the unjust, or cruel, or intemperate are condemned, rather than that I have any prospect of doing any thing by it, which You will interpret a Service or a respect, whose Modesty is such in the midst of many excellent Vertues, that it endeavours to conceal them even from Your self, and will scarce endure to hear of them from others.
You must Pardon me therefore, if be∣ing provoked to extremity by an importu∣nate Goodness, that pursues me with so unusual an Affection through every Stage, and every days Journey of my Life, I now endeavour to make You, as You ought to be, an Example to the World, that You may not shine any longer in darkness and obscu∣rity, though that be no more than the best Diamonds are known to do, but that like the Sun, the King and Fountain of the Day, You may communicate the Bright∣ness and Influence of Your Temper to the cold and insensible Corners of the Earth, where the Poles of Humanity move with a listless Pace, and where true Honour and Friendship are not known. Not that I in∣tend to present You with a Character of Your self: For it may be dangerous to tell You all Your own, as humble and as equal
 as You are, as free from any thing of Va∣nity or Affectation: But instead of that as a further Testimony to, and a new Tryal of, the Goodness and Gallantry of Your mind, I lay this worthless Trifle at Your Feet, and bid You good morrow by the Name of Patron, which I hope You will bear with Patience, not only for my sake, but as You do an hard Frost, or the Mid-summer Heats, or the Autumnal Faintings and De∣cays of Nature: For this is no more than one of the common Calamities incident to human Life, and the natural Inconvenience of being an Author's Friend. Yet when I call it worthless and Trifle; two very ill Names to make a Present withal, I mean it only with respect to the transcendent Merit of Him, to whom it is offered, to the smalness of it's Bulk, and the greater meanness and littleness of the Writer, who hath scarce any thing else to value himself upon besides Mr. NIGHTINGALE's kind and charitable Opinion; otherwise for the Subject there can be nothing greater than that which is concerning that auspitious Birth with which impatient Time and Ex∣pectation were so long in labour; in which so many Predictions and Prophesies were fulfilled, so many Mystic Types and Sha∣dows
 answered, so many and so costly Sa∣crifices and Expiations ended; and for my Management of it, I am so far from being one of those that do magnificè sentire of themselves, especially without, and con∣trary to, Reason, as most of those magnifi∣cent Opiniators do, That all I dare pretend to say concerning it, is only this, that I have endeavoured to do something, which may in some measure excuse and justifie Your Friendship to me.
Particularly what I have written in the First Part of this Discourse concerning Mo∣ses and Joshua, and the rest of the Judges and Saviours of Israel, concerning Hobed and Jesse, and Saul, and David, and Solomon, as having all of them in their Names or Offices, or both, a preparatory Allusion to the Coming of the Messias, the quality of his Person, and the nature of his Dispen∣sation, is I think so plain and so convincing to any Man, that shall consider those In∣stances singly, and by themselves, and much more all of them in Confederacy together, That I am confident, there is no Man, who hath seriously consider'd with himself, how full of Types and Symbols the Old Testament is, both as to the Names and Things that are contained in it, but will be forced to
 confess, what I without much Vanity may affirm to be true, That it is no inconside∣rable Service which is done to the Gospel, the Person, the Authority of Christ, and con∣sequently to Religion by it.
There may yet perhaps be some Scruple concerning the Etymology of David, which I have made to be as much as Dod, or The Beloved; but as it cannot be questioned, but Dod is a very proper Contraction of Daoud, and that Doudaim, a Word of the Dual Form in the Story of the Man∣drakes is as much as Daoudaim; so it can as little be doubted, that David and Daoud are exactly the same, only that the former is more usually the Chaldee Form, as the latter is the Hebrew, and yet there are not wanting other Words of exactly the same Form in the Hebrew Bibles them∣selves, as Nagid, a Participial Noun for a Captain or Commander from the Adverb Neged, and so also Phakid or Pha∣koud are indifferently used, for a Visitor, Intendant or Inspector.
In the Second Part, which is a Defence of the Chastity of the Virgin-Mother, against the Jewish Cavils and Misinterpretations, I see not that it is possible that any thing should be plainer than that Sarah and Eli∣zabeth
 were very proper Types of a con∣ceiving Virgin, as she is by the Evangelists represented to have been, and whether the undoubted Agreement as to Signification in the Names of Sarah and Mary with one another, the first of which seems to have received some little alteration on purpose that it might exactly suit and correspond with the latter, do not give invincible strength to the Force of this Conjecture, I leave it to Your self, or to any other candid In∣terpreter of things impartially to consider: So also for the Exposition of Psal. 45. v. 16, 17. all that I shall say for it is, That it must be acknowledged to be a fair Exposition, grounded upon a safe and certain bottom, and that if I could discern upon the ma∣turest Deliberation, which I am capable of entring into, that there was any other way of untying or explaining the difficul∣ty to be found, which could have the shape or colour of a possible Interpretation, I should not so much rely upon it as I do.
For the Application of the Story of Mel∣chisedek in this Second Chapter, I will be so ingenuous to acknowledg to You, that I lay no great matter of stress upon it, but am rather inclinable to believe that that whole Verse is alike applicable to the Di∣vinity
 of Christ, not any of it to his being born of a Virgin, and that the several Clauses to be met with in it, are exegeti∣cal and explanatory one of another; with∣out Father, without Mother, without De∣scent, having neither beginning of Days, nor end of Life; only that which I have made use of upon this occasion, was at the least a possible Exposition, which the Laws of Argumentation do not forbid me to use; so the stress and weight of the whole Argu∣ment be not laid upon it, which I am so far from having done, that in the last Place, besides those Arguments which were before-hand produc'd, I have after this applyed the History of Lot and his two Daughters to the same purpose, and as there is no Exception against this Applicati∣on, but only that, that whole story is made up of Circumstances, of an incestuous and immoral Nature; so whether this be not ve∣ry fairly answer'd by the plain proof which I have given that our Saviour was contain'd in the Loines of Moab, by the Genealogy of Pharez, to which we may likewise add the inexcusable Love and ignominious Marri∣age of David and Bathshebah, whence So∣lomon was descended; and lastly, whether this be not likewise a very fair Interpreta∣tion
 of that Passage in the Prophet Esai. concerning the Messias, That He should be numbred with Transgressors, as all of those his Progenotors were in a very high Degree, I refer my self willingly to any man that is not eaten up with prejudice to determine, and what Service it is, which is done to Christianity, by shewing that the Types and Shadows and Prophesies of the Old Testa∣ment, as they are related by the Evangelists, do so exactly answer to the Events of the new, although those Types or Prophesies have not been taken notice of by the E∣vangelists themselves, I had rather others should frankly confess than that I should seem to boast of my Performance, .
For the Third and last Part of this Dis∣course which concerns the Divinity of the Person of Christ, in opposition to the A∣rians, Photinians, Sabellians and Socinians, though it be a Field that hath been fre∣quently trodden by very Learned Men, and the thing in question unanswerably proved to the advantage of the Catholick side, yet it is to be considered that it is a very large Field, and therefore there may be probably some new Paths to be found
 which have not yet been trodden in be∣fore, and such I take my Argument from the Name Emanuel, from the Words of St. John; in the beginning; and without him was not any thing made that was made; and from the Stories of Jonas and Melchisedek, as I have managed them, to be, and indeed the Divinity of our blessed Saviour is a thing so plainly, so industriously, so frequent∣ly inculcated and asserted in the Evangeli∣cal and Apostolical Writings, that we may as well deny not only his being born of a Virgin, but expound any Proposition, how plain soever in the Sermon on the Mount, to a quite contrary Sense to that in which it is usually received, as scruple or boggle at the Divinity of Christ, when once we have ac∣knowledged, as the Socinians profess them∣selves to do, the Authority of the Scriptures.
The Socinian Heresie, which answers to that of Photinus and his Followers in the Primitive Times, so far as the Doctrine of the Divinity is concerned, was condem∣ned at a Council held at Sirmium, where Photinus was himself Bishop, by the Ari∣ans themselves, and this Doctrine in those Times was so generally disliked, so severe∣ly prosecuted, and so constantly condem∣ned and censur'd, that Epiphanius tells us,
 that in his Time, which was not long af∣ter, it was utterly extinct, and indeed it proceeds out of so perverse and refractory an humour, the very Spirit and Soul of waywardness and disobedience, at the same time acknowledging the Authority of the Scriptures, and yet denying those things which are most plainly Revealed in them, that it ought not to be tolerated in any Common-Wealth, and a frank Deist, who utterly discards the Authority of those Sa∣cred Writings, which give so ample Testi∣mony to themselves, is much to be pre∣ferred before so incoherent, impudent and inconsistent a Fellow, who will swallow Forty Absurdities one after another, rather than let go that Position which he is resol∣ved shall be true, let the Scripture say what it pleases, and though at the same time he shall acknowledg the Scripture to be the Word of God, and the undoubted, un∣questionable Revelation of the Divine Will to Mankind.
Neither do the Socinians deny only the Divinity, but also the Satisfaction and Ex∣piation of Christ, and in this indeed they are consistent to themselves; for the latter hath a manifest Dependance upon the for∣mer, and cannot possibly be understood
 without it, as I have shewn very briefly, but yet very clearly, in these Papers with which I now humbly present You; but yet what is this in effect, but to ridicule all the Types and Sacrifices of the Law of Mo∣ses, and to say that they signifyed just no∣thing at all, That Christ was not our Pass∣over, nor our Sin and Trespass-Offering, and that when the Apostles compare these things together, it signifyed no more than if it had been a Dream, or some distract∣ed and Lunatick Imagination, and that the Old Testament and the Legal Dispensation might well enough have been spared for a∣ny Typical Relation they had in them to the New, or to the Dispensation of Christ, and of the Gospel?

Prodigiosa Fides & Thuscis digna libellis,
Quaeque coronata lustrari debeat agna!

But yet as bold and impudent as the He∣resie of Photinus was, which seems to have been the true Reason, why it was so soon and so universally exploded, as being so open and so bare-fac'd an Affront put upon the Credit and Authority of the Scriptures, yet the Sabellian seems to me to have been much the less excusable of the Two, being
 not only every whit as inconsistent with the express Declarations of the Holy Scrip∣tures, or such legitimate Consequences as may be fairly and unanswerably deduc'd from them, but it is all of it Cant and My∣stery and Phanatic Non-Sense into the bar∣gain; whereas Photinus and his Followers did no question proceed upon the same ground, upon which the modern Revivers of that Heresie have done, that is, they looked upon the Doctrine of the Trinity, as an impossible and contradictious thing, and they would believe nothing of which they could not give some intelligible Ac∣count; a great Fault, I confess, when we speak of a Divine, that is, a confessedly in∣finite and incomprehensible Subject, but not so great as theirs, who make new difficul∣ties to avoid the old, and to escape one Mystery run into another, and that so strangely freakish, and so palpably ridicu∣lous, that it is a great dishonour and dispa∣ragement to the Scriptures to be thought to have imposed such whimsies upon the World for Articles of Faith, and the most Sacred Mysteries of Religion. For the Do∣ctrine of Sabellianism was no other than this, (they are the Words of Your Neighbour Dr. Cudworth in his Intellectual System, p.
 605.) That there was but one Hypostasis or singular, individual Essence of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; and consequently, that they were indeed but three several Names, or Noti∣ons or Modes of one and the self-same thing. From whence such Absurdities as these would follow; That the Fathers begetting the Son, was nothing but one Name or Notion or Mode of the Deity's begetting another; or else the same Deity under one Notion, begetting it self un∣der another Notion. And when again the Son or Word, and not the Father, is said to have been incarnated, and to have suffered Death for us upon the Cross; That it was nothing but a meer Logical Notion or Mode of the Deity, that was incarnate and suffered, or else the whole of the Deity under one particular No∣tion or Mode only.
It would have been very well si sic omnia dixisset, although in this very Citation, there be sufficient matter for a very just Reprehension; For, by the Dr's Favour, the Sabellian Doctrine is by no means a Consequence of this Proposition, That there is but one Hypostasis, or singular, individu∣al Essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, so far as the Divinity of all the Three Persons is concerned; for the divine Nature in them all is, to use his own way
 of Expression, singularly, individually, nu∣merically the same, as I shall now immedi∣ately shew, and yet for all that the Sabelli∣an Doctrine still continues to be as false and as absurd as ever.
But so extremely cautious was the Or∣thodox Doctor of running into the Heresie of Sabellius, That he not only denys the Three Persons of the Trinity to have One singular, existent Essence, but to avoid an Assertion, which to him seems to be so full of absurdity, and the more effectually to baffle Atheism, which says there is no God, he tells us, if we will believe him, That there are Three, They are his own Words let him speak for himself, pag. 604. It is e∣vident from hence, that these reputed Ortho∣dox Fathers, who were not a few, were far from thinking the Three Hypostases of the Tri∣nity to have the same singular, existent Essence; they supposing them to have no otherwise one and the same Essence of the Godhead in them, nor to be one God, than three individual Men, have one common specifical Essence of Man∣hood in them, and are all one Man. But as this Trinity came afterwards to be decryed for Tritheistic; so in the room thereof started there up that other of Persons Numerically the same, or having all one and the same singu∣lar,
 existent Essence; a Doctrine which seem∣eth not to have been owned by any publick Au∣thority in the Christian Church, save that of the Lateran Council only. In which words it is as plain as Words can express it, that he represents the Orthodox Fathers assert∣ing the Belief of Three Gods, as much as Three Men are Three Men, numerically di∣stinct, though having a specifical Identity with one another, and this I think is to as∣sert Three Gods, if the Father, Son and Holy Ghost be as distinct from one ano∣ther as Paul and Apollos and Cephas; for no man doubts but they were three seve∣ral and distinct Men; nay he owns the thing to save us the trouble and the charge of proving it: For in the Running-Title of that very Page, he calls this Trinity of these reputed Orthodox Fathers, a Tritheistic Tri∣nity, and afterwards when he condemns the Doctrine of a singular, existent Essence of Novelty, and by consequence disallows and disapproves it, as he had done de∣servedly the Sabellian Doctrine before, we must either conclude him to be himself a Tritheistic, a Sect for which I believe he may have a kindness, because he loves hard Words, or something else without either stick or trick which I will not name,
 because his Book pretends to be written a∣gainst it.
Neither was he barely content to have insinuated thus much under the Covert of the reputed Orthodox Fathers, but p. 605. He is at it again, being wonderful zealous to expose and baffle this Lateran, Popish Do∣ctrine of a singular, existent Essence; The Word , saith he, as was before insinu∣ated by Petavius, was never used by Greek Writers otherwise, then to signifie the agree∣ment of things numerically different from one another, in some common nature or universal essence, or their having a generical Ʋnity or I∣dentity of which sundry Instances might be gi∣ven; nor indeed is it likely, that the Greek Tongue should have any Name for that, which neither is a thing in Nature nor falls under human Conception, (viz.) several things ha∣ving one and the same singular Essence; So that it is plain according to him, having already refuted and blasted the Sabellian Doctrine, that if there be indeed a Tri∣nity of Divine Persons, it consists of Three several Natures numerically different; al∣though they have a specifical sameness or Identity with one another, that is, in plain English, there are Three Gods, let Nature and the Scripture say what they please;
 for they do both of them assure us, there is but One; but in regard he hath no where declared for any Trinity at all, as it is his Custom to lye close in a difficult Point, on∣ly hath made it his business in a multitude of Words, to expose the Trinity of the reputed Orthodox Fathers; therefore the most that Charity it self can allow him, if it were to step forth, and speak his most fa∣vourable Character to the World, is, That he is an Arian, a Socinian, or a Deist; and there∣fore he will oblige us very much in the close of the next Volume, (which is expe∣cted to come out upon the last day of the last Platonic Term; for the Intellectual Ʋ∣niverse, like the mundus aspectabilis, is to consist of Two Globes, of which the Cele∣stial that is the biggest, is yet to come) a∣mong which of all these reputed Orthodox Divines he hath enroll'd and listed him∣self.
Nay, not yet satisfyed with having, a Man would think, sufficiently betray'd the most sublime and sacred Mystery of the Christian Faith, he confirms and inculcates the same thing by new Arguments and fresh Examples, in what he saith afterwards, p. 611. of the Orthodox Fathers condemn∣ing and disallowing the use of the words
  and  in the declaration of their Doctrine and Sentiments concerning the Blessed Trinity, and yet p. 605. after having represented the Absurdity and Fol∣ly of the Sabellian Doctrine, he tells us, That should it be averred, that this Trinity which we now speak of (the reputed Orthodox Trinity of the reputed Orthodox Fathers) was not a Trinity of meer Names and Noti∣ons, as that of the Sabellians, but of distinct Hypostases or Persons; then must it needs follow, (since every singular Essence is an Hy∣postasis, according to the Sence of the Anti∣ent Fathers) that there was not a Trinity only, but a Quaternity of Hypostases in the Deity: Which is a thing that none of those Fathers ever dreamed of; perhaps not, and how it came into the Doctours Head, or where the necessity of the consequence lies, that if there be three Persons in the Deity, there must be four, I cannot Ima∣gine, and I refer my self as I said before to the second part of his Moreh Nevochim, to resolve this scruple together with the o∣ther; for till that Book comes out, which I am very much afraid it will not do, till a little after the coming of Elias, it is more then probable this difficulty will never be explained, only thus much we learn in the
 mean time, by what he hath already de∣clared, that if he do believe a Trinity at all, it is a Trinity of three several and di∣stinct Hypostases or singular existent Essen∣ces, numerically distinct from one another, and that if there be three such Hypostases, there must be four, which is absurd, there∣fore there is no▪ Trinity at all, quod erat o∣stendendum, the very thing he all along de∣signed to shew.

And yet this is the Man that can neither speak a common Truth nor a notorious Fal∣shood, but out steps our self, and some∣times we our selves a kind of a Platonic Triad of Impertinents, the Doctor, the Professour, and the Master or Keeper, in the Imperial Stile of Patents and Procla∣mations, as if R. C. and C. R. were the same, the best and the wisest of Princes and of Men, and a small Euthusiast, a Rosi∣crucian Brother, with his Girdle stuck with Noes, and Henades and Antoagathotetes, and such like Platonic and Bombastic Bau∣bles, whose Book instead of being, as it calls it self, an Ʋniverse, is a Chaos of crude and indigested Notions; an Abyss of bottom∣less Vanity and Ostentation, as Intellectual, as
 the Scholastic Intelligences themselves, that move those Orbs which are no where to be found, and a true System by the same sort of Figure, by which a True Protestant is no Protestant at all. But my Zeal for the Honour and Credit of our Religion trans∣ports me, I am afraid, to an immoderate Degree, a Degree that would very ill com∣port with the known Mildness and Mercy of Your Nature, but that I hope You will consider with Your self, that there is a Ju∣stice in Censures, as well as there is in Pu∣nishments, and that no Man in the World, let him be who he will, can be too sharply or severely dealt with, who under pretence of defending Christianity hath betrayed it, and who after comparing so many Heathen and Philosophic Trinities together with the Christian, declares that the last of them, if it be any thing at all, is a Trinity, not of Persons but of Gods, and by consequence hath very sliely endeavoured, under pre∣tence of representing the Opinion of the Orthodox Fathers, to expose that Doctrine to the scorn and contempt of all conside∣ring Men; and if he himself, or any body for him, can put any other Interpretation upon it, than I refuse no Punishment nor any Disgrace; besides, that it is to be con∣sidered,
 that he will not allow the Pagans themselves to have been so absurd and foolish as to have paid their Worship to ma∣ny supreme and independent Beings, and by vindicating them, it is manifest that at the same time he is to be understood to declare against it himself, otherwise this would not be to vindicate, but accuse, and therefore when he represents this to have been the Opinion of the Fathers, That the Three Persons of the Trinity differ on∣ly from one another as Three Men do, by a Numerical Distinction, pertaking all of them of the same generical or specific Na∣ture three times repeated to no purpose; for at this rate there is nothing in the one, which is not in the other, what is this but to represent them under the same ill Cha∣racter, as Worshippers of three Supreme and Independent Beings; from which he endea∣vours to vindicate the Pagans; for if there be a distinct and several Divinity in each of the Persons, which is not numerically to be found in any other, then is it mani∣fest that they must all of them be Indepen∣dent, for one Divinity cannot possibly pro∣duce another, which shall be Numerically different from it self, and shall have equal perfection in all other respects, but only
 that it is not the same; for then there is a possibility, that there may be as many or more Gods then there are Men: And so the Pagans need not be excused from Po∣lytheisme, that is, the Worship of more Su∣preme and Independent Beings, or may per∣haps be mistaken, if they were not guilty of it. To be produced, is plainly the Chara∣cter of a Creature, and to be Ʋncreated and Independent, that of God; so that if there be three Divinities Numerically distinct, there must also be three Supreme and Inde∣pendent Beings, which being a position so frequently Condemned in Terminis by the Doctour, as it does very well deserve, it is plain he had no other design in setting down the Sentiments of his reputed Ortho∣dox Fathers, as to the manner in which the three Hypostases of the Trinity may be said to be three and one at the same time, but only to shew the World that they were but reputedly Orthodox; and to explode the Doctrine of the Trinity together, for he declares there can be no other Trinity but this.
These things are so plain against him, that I am of opinion he would not have dared to Print those Pages by themselves, wherein he sets down the opinion of his
 Orthodox Fathers, and explodes the Do∣ctrine of a singular existent Essence; but that he had a reasonable ground of Hope, that in so vast an heap of Trinitarian Im∣pertinence, which he hath amassed together out of Heathens and Philosophers, rather to gratifie an affectation of appearing learn∣ed, then for any Service it is like to do the World, this mock representation of the Blessed Trinity might be the less regarded, by the sound and sober part of the World, and yet might be sure to have its designed Effect upon such as were Heretically or Schismatically given, and that he might not seem so much to have banished this Do∣ctrien out of the World, a thing which he will find too difficult for all his Craft and Sophistry to accomplish, as to have lost it in a Wood by chance, without being able to find it any more, but though he cannot find the Trinity, yet it is not to be questi∣oned but the Trinity will find him, if he do not seriously repent and publickly re∣cant the horrid Indignities which he hath cast upon it.
The notion of three Supreme and Inde∣pendent Beings, is therefore an Absurd and Foolish Notion, not only because it makes three Gods to no purpose, there being no∣thing
 in any one which is not in the other, but also because it is an impossible one in∣to the bargain. For to the notion of this Supreme and Independent Being the attri∣bute of Omnipresence does of necessity be∣long; wherefore in the case of three Gods, that is, three Supreme and Independent Be∣ings, Numerically distinct, although spe∣cially the same, there must also be three Ʋbiquitary or Omnipresent Natures at the same time, so that they must of necessity imbibe and penetrate each other, by such a kind of knack, as the Doctour out of the Greek Fathers is pleased to call  or Circuminsession; and so being sup∣posed before hand to be Specifically the same, it is now the same thing, by reason of this mutual penetration and total Inbibition of each others substance, as if they were the same Numerically too; and in this ap∣pears the Non-sense of Polytheism, that is, the worship of many such Supreme and In∣dependent substances, if indeed there were ever any to be found that have been so stupid to be guilty of it, that it supposes more Omnipresent Immaterial Natures then one, which if it be once granted to be a possible thing, there is no reason why it may not also be possible, that there may
 be as many Independents in Heaven, as there are upon Earth, and all of them ha∣ving the same Understanding, Will, and all other Attributes so many times Nume∣rically repeated, that there may be a Bal∣lance of Power, an Harmony of Senti∣ments, and a Concurrence of Will to hin∣der them from falling out or squabling a∣mong themselves, so as at this rate, not only Varro's Catalogue would be encreas'd and swell'd to a proportion more prodigi∣ous then that ever was esteemed, but even Conception and Arithmetick would fail to find a thought or a number to express them.
The Doctour was not insensible how very invidious it must needs appear, to charge the Orthodox Fathers, and more e∣specially Athanasius himself, with assert∣ing Three Gods Numerically distinct, and therefore, though he was resolved to lay it home upon them, partly to expose that Doctrine as it deserves, and partly to show the absurdity of a singular existent Essence Numerically the same in three several Per∣sons, which he would have us believe to have been so great, that the Fathers ran into Polytheism to avoid it, and by both of these means to open a fair passage for A∣rianism
 to enter in, and take possession of the minds of his Readers; yet he draws off and on by very Artificial Movements; for thus he tells us after a Multitude of Cita∣tions, as his manner is, p. 606. From all which it is unquestionably evident, that Atha∣nasius did not by the word Homoousios un∣derstand, that which hath the same Singular and Numerical Essence with another, but the same common, generical or specifical only; and consequently that he conceived the Son to be co-essential or consubstantial with the Father, after that manner, that is, in plain English he conceived the Father and the Son to be two several and distinct Gods, and again, p. 612. (which is falsly marked 596) he hath these words: And now upon all these considerations, our Platonic Christian would conclude, that the Orthodox Trinity of the Antient Christian Church, did herein agree with the genuinely Platonic Trinity, that it was not Monoousian; one sole singular Essence, under three Notions, Conceptions or Modes on∣ly, but three Hypostases or Persons, as likewise the right Platonic Trinity does agree with the Antient Orthodox Christians in this, that it is not Heteroousian but Homoousian, Co∣essential or Consubstantial; none of their three Hypostases being Creatures or particular Beings
 made in time, but all of them Unconceived Eternal and Infinite. And this I think a∣gain is to represent the Orthodox Trinity, as consisting of three several Deities, or Divine Substances Numerically distinct, but specifically the same, which is the true In∣terpretation of all those cramp words, that they are Homoousian, that is, specifi∣cally Co-essential and Consubstantial, not Monoousian nor Tautoousian, that is Nu∣merically the same, nor Heteroousian, that is, specifically or generically different from each other, and this, I take it, is to ex∣pose the Orthodox Trinity; but he goes on, and I must follow him, Notwithstanding all which, saith he, it must be granted, that though this Homoousiotes, or Co-essentiallity of the three Persons in the Trinity, does imply them to be all God, yet does it not follow from thence of necessity, that they are therefore one God. No, by no means, but it follows unavoidably, that they are three Gods, and that is it which the Doctor would intimate when he tells us that it does not follow from thence of necessity, that they are one God; implying that the contrary does manifestly follow, and so good Night to the Trinity, a Doctrine which ran the reputed Orthodox Fathers, by which it is
 implyed, that they were not really so, in∣to so many absurdities, and so foul mi∣stakes: But this is not all; What then, saith he, shall we conclude that Athanasius himself also entertained that opinion before mentioned and exploded; of the three Persons in the Trinity, being but three Individuals under the same species (as Peter and Paul and Ti∣mothy) and having no other natural Unity, or Identity then Specifical only? Indeed some have confidently fastned this upon Athanasius, because in those Dialogues of the Trinity, published amongst his works, and there Inti∣tuled to him, the same is grosly owned, and in defence thereof, this absurd Paradox main∣tained, that Peter, Paul and Timothy, though they be three Hypostases, yet are not to be accounted three Men, but only then, when they Dissent from one another, or disa∣gree in Will or Opinion. But it is certain, from several passages in those Dialogues them∣selves, that they could not be written by Atha∣nasius, and there hath been also another Fa∣ther found for them, to wit, Maximus the Martyr. And this is wonderful pleasant; Indeed some have confidently fastened this upon Athanasius, as if the bashful Do∣ctour, whose Chin must be acknowledged to be very Modest and Maidenly, whate∣ver
 his Forehead may be, had not done exact∣ly the same; for he makes Athanasius himself expresly to assert a Specifical Ʋnity of the Three Persons, and what closer Ʋnity there is, unless it be the Numerical, I do not understand, and I challenge him to explain, unless it be the Emperichoretic or Circumin∣sessive, a couple of very fine words to signi∣fie just nothing at all, for it is every whit as hard to understand at this rate, how there shall be Three Persons Specifically, as how they shall be Numerically the same; nay, they will be Numerically the same, whi∣ther we will or no; for if they are all Om∣nipresent, if they do mutually and necessa∣rily and eternally penetrate and imbibe one another, if they have the same Will, Ʋn∣derstanding, Affections, Operations and Ef∣fects, I think it is all one, as if they were Numerically the same, and I know not what notion of Numerical or Individual can be more precise and exact then this is, so that this Emperichoresis, that is Gim-crack; for that is the proper English of the word not Circuminsession, as the Learned Doctour hath rendred it, instead of explaining the Trinity, perfectly destroys it. Nay, Not∣withstanding this (for you must know the Doctour did not bring off Athanasius, but
 with a design to bring him on again) thus much must not be denied by us, that Athana∣sius, in those others his reputedly genuine Wri∣tings, doth sometimes approach so near here∣unto (that is, to the making the Unity of the Three Persons to be Specifical only) that he lays no small stress upon this Homoousiotes, this Co-essentiality and common Nature of the Godhead, to all the three Persons, in order to their being one God: And indeed the Citations by him thereafter immedi∣ately produced, do sufficient prove, that he did sometimes lay the whole stress and weight of the matter upon it; but yet not with so much steadiness and resolution, but that p. 614. he begins to repent his Bar∣gain; for there the Doctour tells us, That Athanasius elsewhere plainly implyeth, that this common Essence or Nature of the Godhead, is not sufficient alone, to make all the three Hy∣postases one God, as in his Fourth Oration a∣gainst the Arians, where he tells us, that his Tri∣nity of Divine Hypostases cannot therefore be accounted Three Gods nor Three Principles, because they are not resembled by him to Three Original Suns, but only to the Sun and its Splendor, and the Light from both. Now Three Suns, according to the Language of Athanasius, have , a
 common Nature, Essence and Substance, and therefore are Co-essential or Consub∣stantial; and since they cannot be accounted one Sun, it is manifest, that according to Athanasius, this Specific Identity or Uni∣ty, is not sufficient to make the Three Di∣vine Hypostases One God. And what is this but plainly to contradict and over∣throw all that he had said elsewhere con∣cerning the Specific Ʋnity of the Three Persons; for if they are not One, as Three Original Suns are One, then are they not Specifically the same, which was the very thing Athanasius had in other places affirm∣ed: Again, if they are not One after this manner, how then are they One? Why as the Sun, the Splendor and the Light; an hopeful Trinity indeed! For the Splendor and the Light are but two words, as I take it, for one and the same thing, and so we have lost one Hypostasis already, and what if the Splendor and the Sun should not be really distinguisht neither? What then be∣comes of this excellent comparison? For certain it is, that the Light or Splendor is not in it self a real existent thing, but only the result or effect of the pressure of the subtle matter in the Body of the Sun, upon the Visionary Organs of Animals capable of be∣ing
 affected with it; it is a relative or con∣ditional appearance, resulting from the pressure of that subtle matter, and the dis∣position of a Nerve or Organ rightly pre∣pared to receive that pressure, and this impression, if it be strong and indistinct, it is called Splendor, if it be more gentle and distinct it hath the Name of Light, but now certainly no Man ever affirmed that the pressure, and the Body pressing, are in reality different from one another, any more then a shape or colour, and the Body shaped or coloured can be; and by the same reason the Sun and its Splendor or Light have not any real, but only an ima∣ginary, relative or notional distinction, so that whatever becomes of the Rhetorick of this Comparison, it is certain that it savours neither of a sound Philosopher nor a sound Divine. But it is still more express against this Specific Identity, what the Doctor, im∣mediately after alledges out of his Writ∣ings, , &c. Neither do we acknowledge Three Hypostases, divided or separated by themselves (as is to be seen corporeally in Men) that we may not comply with the Pagan Polytheism. From whence it is evident, as the Doctour infers, that neither three separate Men, though Co∣essential
 to Athanasius, were accounted by him to be one Man, nor yet the Community of the Specific Nature and Essence of the God∣head, can alone by it selfexclude Polytheism from the Trinity, wherefore the true reason, why Athanasius laid so great a stress upon this Homoousiotes, or Co-essentiality of the Trinity, in order to the Unity of the God∣head in them, was not because this alone was sufficient to make them one God, but because they could not be so without it; Which last thing he speaks not only as the opinion of Athanasius, but his own; for what else is the meaning of the running Title of p. 614, 615. Co-essentiality necessary to the Ʋnity of the Godhead? and that by Co-essentiality hemeans a Specifical Identity, not a Consubstantiality of singular existent Essence, we have al∣ready sufficiently seen, that being an opi∣nion, which he hath endeavoured with a∣bundance of pains and industry, to ex∣plode out of the World, but with how little Skill or Judgment we shall discern more clearly by and by.
To the same purpose with the former Citation, is what he tells us farther p. 616. That though Athanasius no where declare, the Three Hypostases of the Trinity to have one and the same singular Essence, but on the con∣trary,
 denies them to be Monoousian; and though he lay a great stress upon their  their Specific or Generic Unity and Co∣essentiality, in order to their being one God; for as much as without this they could not be God at all; yet doth he not rely wholly upon this, as alone sufficient to that purpose, but ad∣deth certain other considerations thereunto to make it out, in manner as followeth: but let what will follow, it seems to me very ma∣nifest without examining the particulars proposed, that the Doctour and Athanasi∣us too, if he have represented him aright, are certainly very much beside the mark; for if the Ʋnity of the Trinity be only Specific, then it is plain that it is not Nu∣merical, and there can be nothing but a Numerical Identity that can excuse the Three Persons from being Three several and distinct Gods, for if they be not Three Per∣sons Numerically the same, as to the com∣mon substance of the Divinity, which be∣longs to them all, then each Person is like∣wise a Divine substance by himself, Nume∣rically distinguish'd and seperate from the other two, so as the first substance is not the second, nor the second the third, nor the third the first, and if this be not plain∣ly to introduce Polytheism, that is, a Be∣lief
 and Worship of three distinct and Inde∣pendent Gods, then I would fain know what is? Notwithstanding that the admis∣sion of three such several Divine Substan∣ces, be loaded with as great difficulties, and be every whit as hard to understand, as the Lateran Trinity which the Doctour would expose, as hath been already shew∣ed, and though that be indeed the only Trinity which the Scripture teacheth, and which the first Christians of Apostolic sim∣plicity and antiquity believed, as shall be hereafter more particularly declared.
But what are the Expedients proposed by the Doctour out of Athanasius, to secure the oneness of the Deity, and to exclude Polytheism; notwithstanding the Trinity consists of Substances, which are no more then specifically the same, but have a Nu∣merical difference from one another? Why first he tells us, That this (the Athanasian Trinity) is not a Trinity of Principles, but that there is only one Principle or Fountain of the Godhead in it, from which the other are derived; thus does he write in his fifth Oration,  There is but one Principle, and accordingly but one God. But what does he mean by one Prin∣ciple, are there Three Divine Substances or
 no? if there are not, then there is but One, Numerically and Individually One, and by consequence, either there is no Trinity of Divine Persons, or they do all of them be∣long to that one Divine Substance, which is not specifically, but Numerically one and the same. If there are three Substances properly Divine, that is, Eternal and infinitely perfect, then either one proceeds or is begotten, by way of emanative causality from the other, and so though there are not three Princi∣ples, yet there are three Gods notwith∣standing, and, à parte post, three Independent Beings, in as much as that Substance which is not only begotten or produced, but may be destroyed, is not a Divine or infinitely perfect Substance, but a meer Creature, ob∣noxious to Ruin, and subject to the Will and Power of its first cause, it is indeed Dependent in one sense, in as much as eve∣ry Emanative effect hath a perpetual de∣pendence upon its Emanative cause, but yet it is such a dependence as the cause it self cannot take away, and therefore if the Cause be Eternal, the Effect must be so too. Besides that, it is perfect Non-sence, as I have already shewn, for one Divine Substance to beget or produce another, ei∣ther by an Emanative Power, or by any
 other Power whatsoever, which it may ex∣ert or suspend pro Arbitrio, and as it plea∣ses: For the Substance begetting and begot∣ten, being both of them ex Hypothesi, o∣therwise they cannot be Divine Substances, infinitely perfect and omnipresent, indued with the same inclinations of Will, and the same degree of Ʋnderstanding and Power, exerting the same Operations and concurring to the same Effects, mutually imbibing and penetrating one another, it is the same thing as if they were Numeri∣cally the same, and it is impossible to con∣ceive them otherwise then so, neither is it to any purpose at all that it should be o∣therwise, and if it be once admitted that otherwise it may be, there may be infinite Divine Substances for ought we know, all of them Omnipresent and Infinitely perfect to no more or no other purpose, then if there had been but one; and where this Divine facundity will cease, we can no more con∣ceive then how it is possible for it to begin.
Again, if they do not proceed from one another by way of Emanation, then they are not only , but  not only three Gods but three Principles likewise, three Absolute and Independent Be∣ings, according to the Doctrine of the
 Marcionists, and so the former inconveni∣ence returns again; for there may be three or thirty, or three hundred Thousand Divine Substances as well as Three, which must be granted to be the extremity of extrava∣gant Nonsence, and if it be once admit∣ted, will excuse and justifie the most ab∣surd Polytheism in the World, the worship of Gods that are infinite in number, and all of them Supreme, Self-existing and In∣dependent, and all of them to no more purpose, then if they were exactly and Nu∣merically the same, imbibing and penetrating each other, and having a Community of Will, Ʋnderstanding, Operations and Ef∣fects, so that they cannot possibly be di∣stinguisht from being the same.
But in the next place he tells us, Atha∣nasius further addeth, That the three Divine Hypostases are not  and  separate and disjoyned beings, but  indivisibly united to one another, p. 616, 617. By which, if he mean the same with the  or Circuminsession, which is the next expedient of working a closer Ʋnion between Substances Numerically different from each other, it hath been already suf∣ficiently considered and deservedly explo∣ded, but otherwise then this, I know not
 what to make of it, and so I let it pass to∣gether with that other, to which it is so like, that they are more then Twins, and have not so much as a Numerical Dictinction, for one great piece of Enthusiasm split into two, only to swell a Book that is too big already, and adorn'd with Quotations, to please a sort of Men that have a Veneration for Greek Authorities, beyond what they have for English Sense.
Lastly, The same Athanasius in sundry pla∣ces,p. 619, still further supposes those three Divine Hypostases, to make up one entire Divinity after the same manner, as the Fountain and the Stream make up one entire River; or the Root and the Stock and the Branches one en∣tire Tree: And in this sence also, is the whole Trinity said by him to be  and  and  one Divinity, and one Nature, and one Essence. And accordingly the word  seems here to be taken by Athanasius in a further sense, besides that before mentioned; not only for things a∣greeing in one common and general Essence, as three Individual Men are Co-essential with one another; but also for such as concurrently together make up one entire thing, and are therefore joyntly Essential thereunto. For when
 he affirmeth , that the Tree is Congene∣rous or Homogenial with the Root, and the Branches Co-essential with the Vine; his meaning is, that the Root, Stock and Bran∣ches are not only of one kind, but also alto∣gether make up the entire Essence of one Plant or Tree. In like manner, those three Hypo∣stases, the Father, Son and Holy-Ghost, are not only Congenerous and Co-essential, as having all the Essence of the Godhead alike in them, but also as concurrently making up one entire Divinity.
In which words it is prodigious to me, and will I perswade my self be so to you also, when I shall have represented my Sentiments concerning them, to consider first the Impertinence of this fourth and last particular it self, to the end, for which it is made use of by the Doctour, and second∣ly the strange inconsistence of Athanasius with himself, if the Doctour have truly re∣presented him, and thirdly, the manifest contradiction of which the Doctour finds himself guilty, without any other evi∣dence then what he produceth himself, as to the signification of the word .
That which he asserted, p. 614. was that Co-essentiality or Specifical Identity was ne∣cessary
 to the Ʋnity or Sameness of the Godhead in the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, but that it was not of its self suf∣ficient, and therefore p. 616. he addeth certain other considerations thereto to make it out, of which considerations this which I have last transcribed is the last, by which the Ʋnity of the Godhead is resol∣ved into an Ʋnity of Integrant or constituent parts, with relation to the whole, in which they are all Ʋnited, and become as it were one with one another, by their Ʋniversal con∣currence to make up that, which consisting of all these in confederacy together, is un∣der one denomination called the whole.
But he did not consider that this Speci∣fic Ʋnity, which is nothing else but the agreement of several such wholes together, or of things that are considered as entire and perfect in themselves, in the same com∣mon nature, and this other Ʋnity resulting from the conspiracy of the parts, to make up the whole, are inconsistent together. For tho' it be trueindeed, that in an whole consisting of simular parts, as in an heap of Sand, a flake of Ice, a massy Stone or Marble, a pain of Wainscot or Glass; there is a Specific Ʋni∣ty of the similar parts of which these things consist, as well as a confederacy of them
 altogether, to constitute that which is considered as the whole resulting from them, yet the Specific Ʋnity and the Ʋni∣ty of Integration, are two several sorts of Ʋnity that have nothing at all to do with one another, and consequently they can∣not advance or improve each other, nei∣ther can the Integral Ʋnity tye the Speci∣fic more closely then it was tyed be∣fore; nay, after all, they are both of them, not real, but imaginary Ʋnities; for that which is Specifically Ʋnited, is really distinct from that to which it is said to be Ʋnited, and is as much another thing and at as great a distance from it, as a Man li∣ving at Bagdat or Grand Cairo, and ano∣ther at the same time inhabiting and resi∣ding at London can be, and so the parts of which the whole consists, may each of them be considered as wholes by them∣selves, and have no other Band of Ʋnion then only in our way of imagining or con∣ceiving things.
But in such integers or wholes as consist of Dissimular and Heterogeneous parts, there cannot be that which Anaxagoras called an  or Specific Ʋnity be∣tween parts of a different contexture and composition, as the parts of blood are
 Specifically Ʋnited, and so of Nerves, Mu∣scels, Cartilages, Veins, Arteries, Bones, and the like, but a Bone and a Nerve are Specifically different; and so is a Car∣tilage, and a Vein and Fibre, because they consist of parts of a different contexture, it being nothing else but likeness of con∣texture, similitude of Uses and Properties and Consistences, which makes the Specifi∣cal Ʋnity in these things, and therefore in this case the Integral Ʋnity can by no means advance or improve the Specifical, they being not only in all cases Ʋnities of a different, as I have shewed already, but in this, of an opposite and contrary nature, so that the one does manifestly destroy the other; and yet such is the instance which the Doctour gives us out of Athanasius, of the Root and Stock and Branches of a Tree, which are specifically different from each other, because of their different use, contexture and consistence, although the Root of one Vine and the Root of another be Specifically Ʋnited, and so as to the Stock and Branches.
Neither is that other comparison of A∣thanasius any better, concerning the Foun∣tain and the Stream making up one entire River; for this is only an whole consisting
 of similar parts, the Particles of all that Water which flows from the same Fountain, being all of them of the same nature and contexture; and though there be a Speci∣fic Ʋnity between the parts and an in∣tegral Ʋnity of them altogether, by which they make up and constitute the whole, yet these are two sorts of Ʋnities, which have nothing to do with one ano∣ther, and both of them only imaginary, as hath been already declared, so that they cannot improve and strengthen one ano∣ther; and if this comparison be stretched as far as it will go, it would follow that the Ʋnity of the three Persons in the Bles∣sed Trinity, was only Imaginary, and Fan∣tastick likewise, which is but to mock and ridicule the most sacred and venerable Arti∣cle of Religion; besides that, there is no∣thing in the Stream, which was not once, I do not say virtually and eminently, but really, formally and substantially in the Fountain, nothing in the fountain which will not be in the stream, and this is ex∣actly the Sabellian Doctrine, which Atha∣nasius himself did other times so much and so deservedly detest and abhor, that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are in re∣ality all of them the same, only that they
 differ modally and respectively from one another.
Wherefore in the next place it will be very well worth our while to consider a little, if you please, how extremely flu∣ctuant and uncertain Athanasius, is, and how extreamly inconsistent with himself; for whereas it hath been above abundantly manifested, that Athanasius and sometimes resolve the Ʋnity of the Godhead into a Specific Ʋnity, as three Men, Peter, Paul and Timothy are one, yet not being able to defend this notion from the Imputation of Polytheism, at other times he recants it, and will by no means stand to his word, as hath been seen already in his own words, as they are cited by the Doctour, p. 614. , &c. Neither do we acknow∣ledge three Hypostases, divided or separate by themselves (as is to be seen corporeal∣ly in Men) that we may not comply with the Pagan Polytheism; he acknowledgeth they are three Hypostases, but not divided or separated, as is to be seen corporeally in Men, that is, they are not Specifically the same; for whatsoever things are Spe∣cifically Ʋnited, are at the same time sup∣posed to be Numerically distinguished from each other, and it is all one whether they
 be corporeal or incorporeal, for three Hu∣man Souls, which are, without question, incorporcal beings, are as truly separate and divided from each other by a Nume∣rical distinction, as three Stones or three Trees, or three Stools, or three Flowers, or any other three Bodies or three things what∣soever: But this it seems was a way which Athanasius had not, when he was at a dead lift, to distinguish between corporeal and incorporeal without, and contrary to, rea∣son, as when he speaks of the Cavil of the Arians against that saying of our Lord, IIntel. Shst. p. 618. am in the Father and the Father in me , &c. The Arians began to quarrel with that of our Lord, I am in the Father and the Father in me; objecting, how is it possible, that both the former should be in the latter, and the latter in the former? Or, How can the Fa∣ther being greater be received in the Son who is lesser? In why of reply whereunto, saith the Doctour, Athanasius first observes, that the ground of this Arian Cavillation, was the grosseness of their apprehensions, and that they did , conceive of incorporeal things after a corporeal man∣ner, and then does headd  &c. For the Father and the Son are not as they

suppose transvasated and poured out, one into another as into an empty Vessel; as if the Son filled up the Concavity of the Father; and again, the Father that of the Son; and neither of them were full and perfect in themselves: For all this is pro∣per to bodies; wherefore though the Fa∣ther be in some sence greater than the Son, yet notwithstanding may he be in him after an manner. But now if we speak of an an extended Substance; it is manifest that the Arians were thus far in the right, that a lesser Extension, such as is the Humane Soul and Humane Nature of Christ, which was all that they meant in this exception, cannot swallow up and re∣ceive into it self a greater, and much less that which is infinite, as the Divine Sub∣stance was on both sides acknowledged to be, and therefore to say that the Father was in the Son, that is to say, a greater ex∣tension in a less, after an incorporeal man∣ner, was an absurd and impossible reply; for Extension is the same in both cases, and it is as impossible that the part should be bigger then the whole in the immaterial, as in the meterial World.
How this Place of Scripture proves a∣gainst the Arians, and by consequence the
 Socinians too shall be declared hereafter in the Process of this Address, which I perceive is like to swell to a much grea∣ter Proportion than I at first intended for it, and would as little suit with Patience on your part, as with good manners on mine, but that You are used to put a fa∣vourable Interpretation upon every thing that I do, and that where no Offence is ta∣ken on the one side, neither can there be any given on the other; but I cannot chuse but take notice before I go any fur∣ther, that this place of Scripture, by the Confession of the Arians themselves was an utter Enemy to the Arian cause, and in truth, I think the Scripture is so very flat and peremptory against it, that for a Man to profess himself at the same time to be an Arian and a Christian, are two professions that are plainly incompetible and inconsistent together; a Man ought to disown the Au∣thority of the Scriptures, before he sets up for an Arian or Socinian, and it would be much less impious, and much more modest to do so, then at the same time, when a Man calls himself a Christian, to oppose with the constancy of a good cause, or the Impudence peculiar to a bad one, that which is so plainly, so expresly, so fre∣quently,
 so industriously Revealed in the Gospel.
Yet after all, Athanasius being as little satisfied at sometimes with this fine expe∣dient, the distinction I mean betwixt Cor∣poreal and Incorporeal, to salve the Unity of the Godhead in the Trinity, as with that o∣ther of the Specifical agreement, trys a third conclusion of the Integral parts, of which the Physical totum or whole is constituted and composed, and he illustrates it as hath been seen by the comparison of a Vine, to whose Integrity the Stock, Root and Branch dop.  concurrently belong; and in like manner, saith the Doctour, as he thinks according to the Sentiments of Athanasius himself, those three Hypostases, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, are not only Congenerous and Co-essential, as ha∣ving all the Essence of the Godhead alike in them, but also as concurrently making up one en∣tire Divinity. But herein was the Doctour ve∣ry plainly, and very grosly mistaken, for these two Ʋnities as I have shown, are ei∣ther opposite and inconsistent the one with the other, or else they are at least Ʋnities of a quite different nature, so that the one cannot improve or strengthen the other, wherefore Athanasius did not pitch upon this expedient, to make the Specifick Ʋni∣ty more close, but only that being dissatis∣fied
 with that way of Solution, and being loath, as he had reason, when it is so plain∣ly Revealed, to part with his main posi∣tion, which was, that there is but one God, notwithstanding, that there are three Di∣vine Persons, he fled, as it were, for re∣fuge, out of that Solution into this; which was as absurd as the other, for as sure as God is, he is a Being simple and un∣compounded, neither is there any possible way to be conceived, wherein this notion may be rendred intelligible, unless it be by conceiving God to be, as he is, an In∣finite and Omnipresent Extension, endued with all possible blessedness and perfecti∣on, one part of which space shall be look∣ed upon as the Father, another as the Son, and another as the Holy Ghost, which bate∣ing the Blasphemy and Impiety of it; how foolish and how childishly absurd it is, I leave to any Man of common Sense and common understanding to consider.
So that this way of removing the diffi∣culty being every whit as ineffectual, and to as little purpose as the other; he was sometimes forced upon the Numerical es∣sence whether he would or no, And accor∣dingly, saith the Doctor, Athanasius fur∣therp. 619. concludes, these three Divine Hypo∣stases
 have not a consent of will only, but essentially one and the self same will, and that they do also joyntly produce ad Ex∣tra,  the self same Energy, operation or action; nothing being pecu∣liar to the Son as such, but only the Oeconomy of the Incarnation, and for this he produces a place of Athanasius; for which I referr you to p. 620. of his Book, for I care not for more Greek then needs must. I Know the connexion of the word accordingly, which is the beginning of this excerption from the Doctor, was designed to confirm what he had said that Athana∣sins did sometimes look upon the Trinity, as upon the constituent and concurrent parts, by which the whole is made up: Accordingly whereunto, saith he, Athana∣sius concludes, that these three Divine Hy∣postases have not a consent of will only, but essentially, one and the self same Will. But by his good favour, this is so far from being a consequence, that it is more natu∣rally inverted quite the contrary way; for if they have one and the self same Will, which Will, it is absurd to say that it can be divided into three parts, then is it plain that that substance in which this Will re∣sides, must likewise of necessity be simple
 and uncompounded, or else each person, if it have not a piece of a Will, which is a piece of Non-sense, whether you respect the faculty in general, or any particular operation proceeding from it, must have a distinct Will by it self; which though it may possibly be consistent with a consent of Will in them all three, yet with the self same Will it is not, and therefore I rather look upon this, as the Doctor ought to have done, for another instance of the uncer∣tain and fluctuating humour of Athanasius then any necessary consequence or result from the Fantastick Trinity of integrati∣on, which it is so far from, that the con∣trary is evidently true, if there be any such thing as truth or demonstration in the world; and in strictness of Speech that o∣ther expression of Athanasius, which he cites in pag. 619. will bear no other sense than this . The Godhead of the Son, is the Godhead of the Father; For this cannot be true of a Specifical Unity, though of a Numeri∣cal it may and must, for granting that all the Three Persons have a Specifical agree∣ment, yet the Godhead of the one, is not the Godhead of the other, any more then the Person of the one, is the Person of the
 other; as Peter and Paul agree specifical∣ly in the Humane Nature, but yet the Hu∣mane Soul of Peter is not the Humane Soul of Paul, any more then the Two Persons of Paul and Peter are the same; and this I think is sufficient to demonstrate that Atha∣nasius did not certainly and constantly de∣termine upon any thing, as to the Modus by which the Three Persons are one God, on∣ly in general he was always stedfast and firm to this position, that there was but one God, notwithstanding that there are Three Divine Persons; and so having fairly dis∣patcht this second point, which was of the inconsistency of Athanasius with himself; it is now time to proceed to the third thing proposed to be considered, which was to show that in this respect the Doctor is an exact parallel to the great Athanasius, altho' in other respects the comparison will not hold, for he is also troubled with that worst sort of self-denyal, which consists in palpably contradicting and varying from himself. For it is no longer ago then p. 605. that he told us, as he had it from Pe∣tavius's own mouth, (a person well ac∣quainted with Ecclesiastick Antiquity, page 604.) that the word Homoousios was ne∣ver used by greek Writers otherwise, then

to signifie the agreement of things Nume∣rically differing from one another, in some common Nature or Ʋniversal Essence; or their having a Generical Ʋnity or Identity, and what he affirms here of all the Greek Writers in general, that he saith more par∣ticularly concerning Athanasius himself, page 606. after many instances there pro∣duced, from all which it is unquestionably evident, that Athanasius did not by the word  understand that which hath the same singular and Numerical Essence with another, but the same common, gene∣rical or specifical only; and consequently, that he conceived the Son to be Co-essential or Con-Substantial with the Father after that manner, and yet here page 619. he hath the confidence to tell us, that Athanasius himself, a Greek Writer to be sure, and the same Athanasius that he was before, that this same Athanasius himself, one of the Greek Writers that never used the word Ho∣moousios otherwise then for a specific Ʋni∣ty, but only now and then when they do use it otherwise, as the Greeks have always been observed to be of a very changeable and inconstant humour, that this very Athanasius Affirmeth,  and ,

that the Tree is congenerous or homogeni∣cal with the Root, and the Branches co-es∣sential with the Vine, and his meaning is, as it should seem, that the Stock and Branches are not only of one kind, but also altoge∣ther make up the entire essence of one Plant or Tree; and this I think hath been suf∣ficiently proved to be another sort of Ʋni∣ty, than that which is call'd Specific, neither was this the only time, that the Greek Wri∣ter Athanasius in spite of Petavius and his Transcriber Dr. C. used the word Homo∣ousios; after the same manner, for so the Doctor himself tells us, pag. 606. out of Athanasius,  that the Branches are Homoousious and congenerous with the Vine or with the Root thereof; and this testimony is the more to be regarded, not only because it is alledged by the Doctor himself, to the utter undoing of his general observation, pag. 605. that the word Homoousios is never us'd otherwise by Greek Writers then to signifie the agree∣ment of things Numerically differing from one another, in some common Nature or Ʋniversal Essence; But still the rather be∣cause this is one of those very Citations from which the Doctor infers that observa∣tion as a legitimate conclusion in the bot∣tom
 of that page. From all which it is unquestionably evident, that Athanasius did not by the word Homoousios understand, that which hath the same singular and Nu∣merical Essence with another, but the same common, generical or specifical only; and a∣gain before this also page 598. speaking of the Platonick Trinity, he hath these words: The entireness of the whole Divinity is made up of all these three together, which have all  one and the same Energy or Action ad extra, and therefore as the Cen∣tre, radious distance, moveable & circum∣ference may be all said to be co-essential to a Sphere; and the Root, Stock and Bows or Branches, co-essential to an entire Tree, so but in a much more perfect sense, are the Platonick Tagathon, Nous and Psyche, co-es∣sential to that  that Divinity in the whole Ʋniverse, neither was Atha∣nasius a stranger to this notion of the word  also he affirming  that the Branches are coessential with, and indivisible from, the Vine, and illustrating the Trinity by that similitude.
But notwithstanding that at some times, the Doctour may look upon this Ʋnity of Integration, not as a different Ʋnity, tho'
 such it be most certainly, but as an im∣provement of the Specifick, which is the thing he drives at. p. 619. yet at others he is pleased to display his ignorance in ano∣ther way, and talks after such a manner, as if the Specific Ʋnity, and the Ʋnity of Integration were the same; for so, p. 606. He not only tells us according to the Do∣ctrine and Language of Athanasius, , That the Branches are Homoousios (Co-Essential or Con-substantial) and Congenerous with the Vine, or with the Root thereof. But he pa∣rallels this place of Athanasius with ano∣ther of Plotinus, where he affirms concern∣ing the Soul, that it is , That it is full of Divine things, by reason of its being Cognate or Congenerous & Homoousios with them: That is, by reason of its Specifical Agreement in the common genus of the Immaterial and Incorruptible Nature; for this was certain∣ly the sense of Plotinus, so that besides the bare sound of the words  and  which in these two Citations have as dif∣ferent Senses, as it is possible for the same words to put on, there is no manner of congruity or agreement betwixt Plotin and Athanasius, and yet the Doctour not only
 manifestly implies there is, but after having alledged the Testimony of Athanasius, he immediately subjoyns; Besides which, the same Father uses  and  and  differently for , in sundry places, none of which words can be thought to signify an Identity of singular Essence, but only of Generical or Specifical: Now the words, be∣sides which are manifestly used, if they have any sense, to strengthen and corroborate, what went immediately before, which was the place of Athanasius concerning the Ʋnity of Integration in the several parts of a Vine, which place being parallell'd with a place of Plotinus, concerning the Specific Ʋni∣ty, and back'd immediately by an obser∣vation which relates to nothing else; we must either say, that the Doctor talks im∣pertinently and confounds the Elements of his Intellectual System, so that we may say of that, what Ovid said, of such another Sy∣stem, before this comely Fabrick of the World, was brought into that beautiful and Majestic order in which we now be∣hold it, that it is,

——rudis, indigesta{que} moles,
Nec quicquam nisi pondus iners, congesta{que} eo∣dem
Non bene Junctarum discordia semina rerum.


And the same Character will be exactly true, of the Intellectual Chaos, which that incomparable Poet and Philosopher gives us of the natural,

Qua{que} erat & tellus, illic & Pontus & Aether,
Sic erat instabilis tellus, innabilis unda,
Lucis egens Aer, nulli sua forma manebat,
Obstabat{que} aliis aliud, quia corpore in uno
Frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis,
Mollia cum duris, sine pondere habentia pondus.

Or else if the Character of an imperti∣nent, be thought a little too severe and sharp for a Man that is so proud and would be thought so learned, then you will do well the next time you see him, to put him in mind of an honest English Proverb, which is not to be found in Suidas, or Zenodotus, or Michael Apostolius, or any of the Greek Paroemiographers, that ever I have met with, that the greatest Clerks are not always the wi∣sest Men; for if it be not Impertinence, it is downright Non-sense, and who would think that so much inconsistent, contradi∣ctious, incoherent Stuff should be the work of twice as many weary days and restless nights, as Penelope spent upon her unravel∣ling Loom, in the long absence of her dear
 Ʋlysses, of twenty painful and laborious years, and of two hundred and sixty va∣riable Moons.
O rem ridiculam, Cato, & Jocosam!
I wonder in my heart how the Learned Doctor, as Learned as he is, came to be so cock sure that the word Homoousios never was used otherwise by Greek Writers, than for things that were Specifically the same, but had a Numerical difference from each other, the chief reason he assigns is because Petavius told him so, and in this he seems to be guilty of the same infirmity which he despiseth so much, p. 604. in the , the many that are led by new Names and Authorities. It is true, he produceth ma∣ny places where the word Homoousios is without question to be understood of a Specifical Unity, but what is that to the purpose? Does it therefore follow that it is never used otherwise? If he had given a par∣ticular and compleat Induction of all the places where this word is used in any Greek Writer, and shown that in every one, it could not be understood otherwise then of a Specific Identity, this had been a legiti∣mate conclusion, but to say of a word that
 may have divers significations, that in some places it is used altogether in one sense, and therefore there is no place where it hath any other, is an inference peculiar to the Doctors Logick, and shows him sufficiently to have been a very unfit Architect to build an Intel∣lectual System, an Intellectual Castle in the Ayr, he should have called it, unless it were built upon more solid Foundations, and had more substantial Pillars to support it.
Well, but Petavius told him so, I mar∣ry did he, and what if he did? what then? must we believe every thing that Petavius tells us? why then we must believe that Transubstan∣tiation is true, and that the Church of En∣gland is Schismatical, in separating from the Church of Rome, for there is no doubt but Pe∣tavius would have determined affirmatively upon these questions, as often as any one had put them to him: Nay, but Petavius was a Man well skilled in Ecclesiastic Antiquity, so he was, and so is not the Doctor who pretends to follow him, but yet nothing hinders but both may be deceived; for Petavius was neither Pope nor general Coun∣cil, and if he had been both of these at once, yet there is a Pestilent Heresie sprung up in these Northern parts, that will have both of these to be liable to Errour, and
 if Petavius be deceived the Doctor must too, for they are Bithus and Bachius, Hand and Glove, an Original and a Transcript, an Author and a Plagiary, so that if Peta∣vius be blind, it follows unavoidably, that the Intellectual Systemer must wink hard for Company, and so they are both in danger of the Ditch; I do not mean Democritus his Ditch, at the bottom of which the Truth was supposed to lie, but of the Ditch of Errour and Hallucination.
But after all, perhaps the Doctors me∣mory may fail him, for is he sure that he had this notion from Petavius; why true∣ly when the matter comes to be sifted to the bottom, Don John of Austria does not prove so tall as our Enformant first took him to be, for by the Oath he hath taken, he can say no more then that Petavius intimated thus much, p. 605. but how did he inti∣mate it? O 'tis no matter for that! Inti∣mations, you know Sir, may be made a thousand ways, which it would be tedious at present to recount, and if this were but one of them it is enough, as a Man of com∣prehension will tell you, there are several Roads to Heaven, a Man might have ta∣ken lately a very convenient opportunity of going thither through Turkey, in the
 company of the Grand Visier, or if he will have patience for a little longer, he may have a convenient and safe passage in the Caravan of Count Tekeley, who goes thi∣ther in the Hungarian Road, there is a ve∣ry pleasant way thither through the Bani∣ans Country, and another that goes all a∣long under the great Wall of China, and people may go thither in what habit they please, and to what Profession or Sect so∣ever they belong, in Fur or in Silk, in a Cowl or a Cassock, with Ribbands up to the Pocket holes, or in a Coller-band, and a yea and nay pinner; but if you do but get to Heaven at last, it is no matter for the Road you take, though you were to pass through Purgatory it self, which is by much the furthest way about.
Petavius was a Jesuite every inch of him, and these Jesuites are mightily given to sham the World with Equivocations and Mental Reservations, and such like Loioli∣teish and Ignatian Tricks, as you will see particularly in this Instance, in the Sequel of my Story; for I did my self the Ho∣nour to'ther day to make him a visit; and to procure a more easie admittance, and a more kind reception, I thought it best to make use of the Doctor's Name, and I told
 him in as civil Language as I could, that I had Service to give him from Christ's Col∣lege, and that it run mightily in the Head of his humble Servant and faithful Transcri∣ber, as if he had intimated something that look'd that way, or let fall some words ac∣cidentally to that purpose, that the word Homoousios was never used otherwise by Greek Writers, then to signifie an agreement of things Numerically different in the same common Nature or Ʋniversal Essence, and I desired him that he would be plain in the business, and let us know whither we might report this in Company, as from himself to be his opinion: Why truly, said the Je∣suite, after a little pause, and he put on, me thought, a very intimating look, that had as much obliging Rhetorick as would have held a Sheet, and that would have sold for a Guiney, had his Worship been to Transcribe it from his Countenance, and Translate it out of red and white, into white and black; truly said he, it is no small com∣fort and satisfaction to me to find my Dog∣mata so pleasing, to one that is given so extremely to dogmatize himself, yet am I not pleased so much for mine own sake, as for that of the Catholick Religion, which I in that Book have maintained and assert∣ed,
 for it is manifest that this Gentleman hath not only read my Book, but that he writ it too; I do not mean so as if it were not mine, but that he writ it after me, so kind is he to any thing that bears my Name, that he indulges and huggs it as if it were his own, and then a smile, unbent the severity of his brow, a false, Jesuitical, in∣timating smile it was, and was as much as if he should have said, These Heretics are all of them Plagiaries and Transcribers; but really Sir, continued he, as for what he charges me with, and I perceive he pre∣tends great intimacy with me, as if I had made, as if the word Homoousios had no o∣ther meaning then what you speak of, in any Greek Writer; believe me Sir, I never said any such thing in all my life, nor any thing that look'd with half an Eye that way, he denied it with all the Asseveration of a Jesuite at the Gallows, so that I knew not what to think; but finding the Man grow warm in his own defence, I was very wea∣ry of his Company, and offered to take my leave, making the best Apology I could for giving him this disturbance, and it so happening just at that nick of time, that there were other scruple-mongers rapping at the Door, and in great haste to be resol∣ved,
 the Father was glad to take me at my word, and referred me for my further sa∣tisfaction to his Book de Trinitate, where he said, I should soon be satisfied how much the Learned Heretic had misreport∣ed him, and accordingly, notwithstan∣ding that he was a rank Jesuite, yet I found his words afterwards to be very true.
For he tells us plainly in his Fourth Book that the Word  was in use not only among the Orthodox, but among the Ma∣nichean Heretics themselves, long before the Nicene Council, to express their Notion of the Trinity, which did not consist of a specific Ʋnity, but was taken up wholely in the Ʋnity of Integration, and every part of that whole, of which the Trinity was composed, they called , or ra∣ther Homoousion according to them signify∣ed the whole Substance taken together, of which every single Person was  a Part, as our incomparable Bishop of Chester hath observed, and withal corrected the Mi∣stake of Petavius in this matter; For whereas the Learned Jesuite speaking of St. Hilary's Translation of the Word Homoousi∣on hath these Words: Quod Hilarius ita La∣tine reddidit, tanquam Homoousion id signifi∣caret,
 quod partem substantiae habet ex toto re∣sectam, The Judicious Prelate observes, that this was done by Petavius without reason, for, saith he, St. Hillary clearly translates Homoousion barely unius Substantiae, and it was in the Original , which he expressed by partem unius Substantiae; from whence it is manifest in the Ʋsage of the Manichees, who were as good Greeks, as the Orthodox themselves, that as  signifyed a Part of that Substance, whose whole was all of it of a similar and homo∣geneous Nature; so Homoousion by it self sig∣nifyed that Substance, which was numerical∣ly one with it self, and not specifically one with another; and yet this it seems was an ordinary and constant Ʋse of the Word a∣mong some Sort of Men, and which A∣thanasius himself favoured in his comparison of the Vine, before the Nicene Creed was known in the World; or if we should al∣low that the whole could not so properly be said to be Homoousion, as the Parts of which it consists, yet this is only an Ʋnity of Integral Parts, not a specific Ʋnity of se∣veral things, that are consider'd as wholes by themselves, and this is enough to de∣stroy the Doctor's Observation; Nay, this Interpretation of the Word Homoousios was
 so proper to the Manichees, that, as the same excellent Bishop observes; Arius, for this very reason pretended to reject the Name, Homoousion, lest hereby he should be thought to admit a real Composition, or Division in the Deity; and Eusebius Bishop of Caesarea refused to subscribe to the Creed of the Council of Nice, till this Word was mollifyed by Interpretation; so that he might be sure to take it in an Orthodox Sense.
But it is still more remarkable what Pe∣tavius observes, concerning the Schisme that happened at Antioch, about the Hy∣postases of the Blessed Trinity, some would have it, that in this Mystery there was but one Hypostasis or Divine Substance; (for that was it which in that Controversy they understood by the word Hypostasis) others that there were three, yet did the one en∣deavour so to explain their notion of Three Hypostases (though that in Truth cannot be done) as to avoid Polytheism, and the other so to interpret the Doctrine of one Sub∣stance, as to avoid the Heresies of Sabellius and Paulus Samosatenus and Photinus; and therefore meeting together to compose the business at a Synod at Alexandria, both Parties were by the authority of Athana∣sius himself perswaded to acquiesce in the
 Nicene Formulary of Faith, to which it was impossible for any one to subscribe with∣out acknowledging the Persons of the Blessed Trinity to be Homoousious one with another; for tho' this word before the Ni∣cene Council were abused to an unsound & erroneous sense by the Manichean Here∣tics, and therefore were at first rejected by the Orthodox themselves; yet at last it began to be looked upon, as a word that did the most significantly declare the meaning of the Orthodox, against Heresies of all sorts, so far as the Mystery of the Trinity was concerned; and for that rea∣son it was inserted in the Symbol of Nice, and it is not only clear by the acknow∣ledgment of Petavius, but it is unavoida∣bly necessary in the nature of the thing, that if both Parties in the Schisma Antio∣chenum did equally subscribe to and acqui∣esce in the Nicene Confession, that they must also subscribe mutually to the word Homo∣ousion, altho' they took it in different senses, the one as expressing only an Ʋnity of Spe∣cific Nature, and the other an Ʋnity of In∣dividual Essence, and is it not then extream∣ly bold in this unskillful pretender to Ec∣clesiastick Antiquity? First to tell us with so dogmatical a confidence, that the word
 Homoousion was never used otherwise by Greek Writers, then to signifie a generical or a Specific Ʋnity, and then to quote Petavi∣us for his Author, who does so plainly and so substantially confute him? and moreo∣ver shows that even as it is set down in the Nicene Creed, it was not a word of a de∣termin'd signification, but signified indiffe∣rently according to the different opinion of those who had themselves subscribed to it; either the Specific Ʋnity or the Numerical, though to speak truth, as they that were for one Hypostasis, yet made more then a Sabellian or Nominal distinction betwixt the Three Persons; so they that were for Three yet were ashamed, when they were urged, to explain their Doctrine after such a manner; as if the Three Persons were as distinct and different from one another as three several men are known to be, (which is the Doctors Athanasian sense of Homoou∣sios) and would have been very loath to be so understood, as if they ran into Genti∣lism to avoid the inconvenience of the Sa∣bellian Doctrine; but yet so, as that this was all the while the different principle up∣on which they proceeded; the assertors of one Hypostasis were afraid of Polytheism, and the maintainers of three of Sabellia∣nism;
 notwithstanding that when they came to discourse together, neither could explain or vindicate their own Doctrine, so as to make it plain and free from all ex∣ception, but both Parties mutually centred in this point, that there was indeed but one only God, notwithstanding that there were Three Divine Persons, but said the one of them how can there be Three Di∣vine Hypostases, without admitting Three Gods? to which the other not able to give any satisfactory answer, contented themselves with being able as they thought to charge their adversaries with an equal difficulty on their part, how can there be said to be Three Divine Persons, unless you admit Three Divine Hypostases or Substan∣ces also? and this last mentioned difficulty whatever answer it is capable of receiving, yet it is certain, that in Antiquity it never met with any, so that the controversy was endless, and both of the contending Par∣ties, being mutually agreed, that there was but one God; notwithstanding that there were Three Divine Persons, though neither could give a satisfactory account of their way of explaining it; it was indeed no bet∣ter then a  or Controversy about words, when in the main business they
 were both of them agreed, and neither knew how to explain their particular senti∣ments, as to the Modus of it to the other, or to themselves, and this is no more then what St. Jerome expresly tells us in E. 57. ad Damascen cited by Petavius L. 4. C. 4. of his book de Trinitate—fufficiat nobis dicere unam substantiam, Tres Personas subsistentes, perfect as, aequales, coaeternas, taceantur tres Hy∣postases, si placet, & una teneatur, non bonae sus∣picionis est, cum in eodem sensu verba dis∣sentiunt.
This was the true reason that made Atha∣nasius and others so extreamly uncertain in their determinations, how there could be Three Divine Persons, and yet but one Di∣vine Substance they could not tell; and there is no question, but they were mise∣rably run a ground as often as they en∣countred with the Arrians about it; and this made them sometimes fly to the Speci∣fic Ʋnity, as Athanasius himself is some∣times found to have done, but this was more professedly and constantly the Do∣ctrine of Gregory Nyssen and Cyrillus Alex∣andrinus and some others of the Fathers; but this lying so fairly open to the charge of Gentilism from their Arrian Opposers; they sometimes fled for refuge into the
 Manichean Ʋnity, which was the Ʋnity of the Vine and Stock and Branches or the Ʋ∣nity of Integration, but then at other times being made sufficiently sensible, not only of the weakness but Impiety of this Doctrine, they compared it to the Sun, and its Splen∣dor and Light, which have no real dif∣ference from one another, and herein, if I am not mistaken, they fell in with the He∣resy of the Valentinians who made the Son to be  a kind of a ray, or shooting out of that Divine Substance which is called the Father, they are the words of Arrius himself concerning Velenti∣nus in his Epistle to Alexander, , which St. Hil∣lary hath rendred prolationem patris; and this if I am not mistaken is the very same Here∣sy which was branded with an Anathema, by several Presbyters and Deacons of the Marcellian Party, under the name of  as if the Son were a kind of an enlarge∣ment or dilatation of the Divine Substance, of which I shall have occasion to say more in a very little while, so that to avoid the poison of the Arian Doctrine they ran al∣most, by turns and without any constancy or fixt assurance, into all other Heresies and absurdities whatsoever, the reason of
 which was that without discarding the Authority of the Scriptures, they thought they could not by any means let go that Fundamental Position, that there was but one God, notwithstanding that there were Three Divine Persons, and therefore some∣times being perplextand entangled in their own Meditations, and at other times for∣ced in a manner upon it by the Arians, ur∣ging them perpetually to explain the Mo∣dus in which it was at least possible for such a thing to be, they resolved the diffi∣culty sometimes one way, and sometimes another; and what I say of the Arians the same is to be understood of the Ebionites, and of the Followers of Artemon and Paulus and of the Disciples of Sabellius and Photinus, for all these Heresies were owing more or less to the inconceivable obscurity, and as they thought implicite Contradiction, of this proposition that the Godhead be∣ing but One, there were notwithstanding Three Personalties to be met with in it.
Again as the difficulty of explaining the Doctrine of the Trinity, as to the manner wherein it was possible for Three Divine Persons to be really existent, notwithstan∣ding that there was but One Divine Sub∣stance, occasioned as well the Heresie of
 the Arians themselves, as all those other Heresies that have been mentioned; so the constant Attestation of the Scripture to this Truth, That there is but One God, or One Divine Substance, and that there were Three Persons, that were truly and properly Divine, did sometimes shake the confidence of the Arian Party, and produced that He∣resie which was called Semiarian, which banished the Word Homoousion out of the Creed, as may be seen in the Confession of the Selcucian Synod under Constantius, and introduced that of  instead of it, which was received by some of the Catho∣licks themselves, though in a different Sense, as Petavius hath observed, and indeed there was no reason why it should not equally have been received by all, if they had look∣ed upon the Ʋnity of the Blessed Trinity, to be no more then Specifical, for this is that which  does most properly signifie, as Lucretius explains the  of Anax∣agoras to be a Specifical Identity of similar parts: Furthermore as they acknowledged the Son to be , Co-essential or Con∣substantial with the Father, tho' in a sense much beneath the Specifical, so did they likewise call him , God of God, but in so cold a sense, that when the mat∣ter
 came to be examined to the bottom, they differed scarce any thing from the A∣rians themselves, as Epiphanius hath taken notice.
But when all is done Athanasius, when he was not disputing with himself, nor with the Arians or other Heretics, and when he attended only to the declarations of the Scripture concerning this great Mystery of the Christian Faith, the Doctrine of the Tri∣nity, he did believe and affirm plainly, that there was but one Hypostasis or Substance in it, and that the three Persons of which it was composed, did all of them belong, to use the Doctors Language, to the same sin∣gular Existent Essence, and yet notwithstand∣ing he must be supposed all this while to sub∣scribe heartily to the word  in the Ni∣cene Creed, and by consequence did under∣stand it after that manner, in which the In∣tellectual Dogmatist asserts, that it was ne∣ver understood by him or by any other Greek Writer; and because he is pleased to hold the World in hand, that he speaks this by intimation from Petavius, therefore I will prove what I have said to be true, by the Authority of the same Writer, who not only intimates, but plainly affirms the con∣trary, L. 4. de Trin. c. 13. where after ha∣ving
 cited a passage out of Athanasius, in his Fifth Oration, to prove that he held but one Hypostasis or Divine Substance in the Trini∣ty, he adds this Comment upon the Citati∣on, Ʋbi quod Divinitate unum ait esse Patrem & Filium, de ea sola, quae speciei convenit, unitate non potest accipi, alioqui non id adjun∣geret; Filium a Patre sectum ac divisum non esse ne{que} ab eo separari: cum individua quaelibet sub eadem comprehensa specie, ab iis unde pro∣pagata sunt, divisa sint ac separata. And at the end of another Citation out of this Ex∣position of Faith, a very good place to Judg of Athanasius's opinion, he hath these words, Prorsus in tribus personis unam & individuam substantiam ac naturam Athanasius agnoscit; non cujusmodi in tribus est hominibus, aut in Diis pluribus, si Dei species esset ulla commu∣nis pluribus, sed quem admodum una Fontis a∣qua est & Fluvii; quae continua cum sit, ne{que} interrupta; non specie tantum, sed numero a∣qua una censetur. And that this was Peta∣vius his setled opinion appears from L. 1. c. 13. S. 5. Where he hath these words, refer∣ring to this Chapter in his Fourth Book, at vero unam tantum Hypostasin Trinitatis A∣thanasius agnoscit, ut Libro quarto demon∣strabimus; the Sum of all which is no more than this, that the Systematical Compiler
 thinks Petavius to have intimated as much; as if neither Athanasius nor any other Greek Writer understood the word  in any other sense, then only to signifie a Specifi∣cal Agreement between things Numerically differing from each other, and Petavius thinks he hath demonstrated the contrary, not only out of Athanasius, but other of the Fathers, who did concur with him in the acknowledgement of a singular Essence, as may be seen in that and other Chapters of that Book, notwithstanding that they did all of them unquestionably subscribe to the word Homoousios in the Nicene Creed; to all which it is still farther to be added, that in the Antiochian Schism, they which were the true occasion of it, were not they who asserted one Hypostasis, but the main∣tainers of three, which gave such offence to the Assertors of one, as tending to Po∣lytheism, that it occasioned a separation be∣tween them, and this happening as it did, though in the same Age, yet somewhat af∣ter the Nicene Council, it is manifest that those Fathers before this Schism happened, did generally maintain the singular Exi∣stent Essence, and by consequence, that they understood the word  in that significa∣tion, and so here is a publick, and the great∣est
 of all publick Authorities in the Church, for the Numerical and Individual Essence, long before the Lateran Council was thought of in the World, if we will take the un∣questionable Sentiments of the Nicene Fa∣thers, for a publick determination upon this question, although they did not de∣finitively declare their meaning, in ex∣press words, for the individual Essence, which if they had done, it would have been impossible for both parties, in the Schism of Antioch, to acquiesce in the Authority of that Council, and mutually subscribe to their confession of Faith; and indeed the signification of that word, not having been definitively and scrupulously determined by the Council of Nice, is a very strong Argument, that all those Fathers were U∣nanimous for the singular Essence, other∣wise there would have been a division up∣on this account, in the Council it self, An∣tecedent to that of Antioch, and this division would either have occasioned a mutual se∣paration, as afterwards it did, or they would have explained their Sentiments concerning the Blessed Trinity, in such terms of Latitude, as both parties might well enough acquiesce in, which would have rendred a Schism upon that score, in a manner afterwards impossi∣ble.

Another thing which I shall instance in to shew what Sentiments the Council of Nice had in this Affair, shall be the Story of Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra, who was one of those 318 Fathers of which that Coun∣cil was composed, a very strong Oppugner of the Arrian Faction, as himself assures us in an Epistle written afterwards in his own Defence to Julius Bishop of Rome, but yet notwithstanding not long after this Council, he was Deposed from his Bishop∣rick for Heresie by Eusebius Caesariensis and his Party; but Epiphanius makes a great doubt, whether he should reckon him a∣mong Hereticks or no, and it is certain, that he not only approved himself to the said Julius the Roman Bishop, and to Athanasi∣us himself for a Man sound in the Faith, but that the Council of Sardis determined in his favour, and judging that he had been abused and misrepresented by the above mentioned Eusebius, restored him to his Bishoprick again. Now if it can be pro∣ved that the Doctrine of Marcellus was no other then that of the singular existent Es∣sence in the Persons of the Trinity; then it follows likewise, that this was the Judg∣ment of Julius and of Athanasius too, to whom he approved himself, and not only
 so, but of the Council of Sardis also, by whom he was restored, and the Doctrine of the Nicene Council, being at that time the Orthodox Measure of Faith, we may from hence infer their Sentiments likewise.
The Confession of Marcellus is set down in his Epistle to Julius in Epiphanius, in these words,  that is, we are assured from the Holy Scriptures, that the Godhead of the Father and the Son, is indivisibly Ʋnited, for if a∣ny one shall separate the Son, that is, the word from God Almighty (or God the Father) it is necessary that he either maintain the ex∣istence of two Gods, which is agreed to be repugnant to the Scriptures, or that he say the word is not God, which is equally incon∣sistent with the Catholick Faith with the o∣ther; for the Evangelist tells us, the word was God, and I have been exactly () or certainly taught, that the Son is the in∣divisible and inseparable Power of the Fa∣ther, for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ saith, I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and whoso hath seen me, hath seen the Fa∣ther also. This Faith I having received from the Scriptures, and from the Succession of Believers that have gone before me in the profession of it () I Preach in the Church and write it to you.
 In which confession Epiphanius himself grants, that there is nothing which is not Or∣thodox and sound, but yet he thinks it rea∣sonable to believe he might be guilty of some Errours, which occasioned this De∣fence of himself, and Petavius saith, That in the Books of Eusebius, which were written against him, there are several excerpta cited out of his own Writings, which cannot bear a Justifiable Interpretation; but yet he acknowledgeth Eusebius to have been too uncharitable and morosely critical and cen∣sorious, in putting the worst construction upon every thing, in Marcellus his Writ∣ings, and representing every thing to an extremity of disadvantage, very disagree∣able to a fair and candid Writer, and the Judgment of Petavius is confirmed by a passage in Epiphanius, concerning Athana∣sius, of whom, when Epiphanius himself de∣manded what his Judgment was of Marcel∣lus, he gave him little or no answer, , only intimated by a smile, that he was not far from Heretical pravity, but that he looked upon him as a convert. He did not say he ever was an Heretick, but only seemed to intimate some such thing by a smile,
 upon which a Man might have put diffe∣rent Interpretations, as his fancy served, as if he had not been far from something that was amiss, but afterwards both saw and amended his Errour, which is a mighty ex∣tenuating way of calling a Man Heretick, as can possibly be imagined: Petavius him∣self supposeth him, out of hatred and de∣testation of the Arian Herisie, to have run sometimes a little too far into the other extreme, and to have enclined to the Sa∣bellian Doctrine; but it is strange to me, that none of the Bishops that sat to Judge and Determine upon his Cause at Sardis, and who were equal Enemies to both Ex∣tremes, could discern any such thing; for it is manifest they approved the Man and his opinions, and whereas Petavius gives it still further, as his Judgment, that in this very Epistle, which was directed to Julius, his Confession is worded after so cold a manner, that it will scarce serve to free him from the imputation of Sabellianism, which his Adversaries would have cast up∣on him: It is sufficient to me, that it satis∣fied Julius at that time, who knew Mar∣cellus better then Petavius could do, and that Athanasius himself was one of his Com∣purgators, who is unanimously acknow∣ledged,
 bating the uncertainty of his re∣solutions as to the Modus of the Trinity, none of which ought therefore to be look∣ed upon as his fixt opinion, to have been far enough from any thing that looked that way, and yet there is one thing in the Con∣fession of Marcellus, which might have been thought to savour of Sabellianism, were it not the express Language of the Scripture it self, where speaking of the Son, he says that he was , the inseparable and indivisible Power of the Father, as if he were not a distinct Person, but only an Attribute or affection of that Divine Substance which is called the Father, but so the Scripture speaks 1 Cor. 1. 24. Christ, the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God, but what then? does it follow from thence that he was not a di∣stinct Person from God the Father? by no means, but only that he was a Person en∣dued and furnisht with divine Power and Wisdom; as when the People said, though falsly and mistakenly of Simon Magus, Act. 8. 10. This Man is the great power of God, they meant no more then this, not that he was an Attribute or Affection of God the Father, or God the Father in a certain re∣spect, not differing from him in Person,
 and in a separate reality of Existence, but only that he was a Person working by Di∣vine Power; although I confess what the Apostle said of Christ is true in an infinite∣ly more noble and exalted Sense, than that which the People said of Simon Magus, tho all had been true of him, which they can be supposed to have understood by it; for they meant no more than that Simon was a Person working by Divine Power and As∣sistance; but St. Paul referred to the Ʋnion of the two Natures in the Person of Christ, by which it came to pass, the same divine Substance being common to both, as shall be hereafter more particularly declared, that the same Power and Wisdom, numeri∣cally the same, as belonging inseparably to the same Divine Substance, did belong to both, the Father and the Son, and what that is which distinguishes the Persons, not∣withstanding the same singular Essence be∣long in common to them both, shall be con∣sidered more largely by and by; so that if we reflect upon this Passage of Marcellus, which is the only thing that can derive an Imputation of Heresie upon him; and con∣sider first, that it is no more than the Lan∣guage of the Scripture it self; and secondly who it was to whom this Epistle was dire∣cted
 in his own just and necessary Vindica∣tion, it will appear in both respects not only charitable, but highly just and reaso∣nable to believe, that Marcellus meant no∣thing but what was truly Orthodox and unquestionably sound; and it is strange to me, that Petavius should discern so much Art in this Confession of Marcellus, as if it were written so that it might possibly bear a Sabellian Interpretation, notwithstanding that he hath taken no notice of this Pas∣sage in it, which is the only thing that looks that way.
And what if Eusebius condemned him in his Writings, and by his interest deposed him from his Bishoprick; certainly the O∣pinion of the Bishops that sat in Council concerning his Affair, and his Restoration to his See, which was consequent upon it, is more considerable in his Justification, then the other can redound to his preju∣dice or disgrace; they did not condemn him after the example of Eusebius, but on the contrary, censured Eusebius, for what he had done; which is a very great testi∣mony of Antiquity in his behalf, besides that notwithstanding some of those excerpta which Eusebius pretends to have taken out of Marcellus, cannot perhaps be reconciled
 to an Orthodox Sence; yet since it was the Opinion of so many Ancient and unque∣stionably Orthodox Bishops, with whom Petavius himself in part agrees: that Euse∣bius was possest with a violent prejudice against his adversary, and that he laid hold of the most trifling occasions, of things that would by no means bear it, to run him down; which the Learned Jesuite confesses him to have done, how can we tell but he might misquote him also, for there is nothing more ordi∣nary even in our dayes, notwithstanding that since Printing came in, and so many Copies are immediately spread abroad, it is more dangerous to do it now, then it was then; and may be more effectually remedied by Printing, and dispersing a true and impartial representation of the case.
Nay, that there was indeed a great deal of foul play in the behaviour of Mar∣cellus his adversaries towards him, of which adversaries Eusebius of Caesarea was the chief, appears from the great praecaution of Marcellus, as to that very Epistle which he sent to Julius, for he took a Copy of it for himself before he sent it away, and he beggs likewise of Julius to send faithful Copies of it to the Bishops within his Ju∣risdiction
 for the prevention of mistakes, and that the world might be satisfyed from himself what manner of man he was, which would have been a needless thing had there not been some ill practi∣ces made use of, to represent him amiss, and to make him say what he never inten∣ded.
That Marcellus was a firm and resolute Assertor of the singular Divine Essence in the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, may be proved undenyably from the words of his Confession. For first he says, , &c. The Godhead of the Father and Son are divisible and inseparable from each other, which is as much as to say in other words; as Athanasius himself did sometimes , The Godhead of the Son, is the Godhead of the Father, which can be understood of nothing but the Nu∣merical Essence, as I have shown already, and so I find since Dionysius Petavius to have applyed it before me; but now upon supposition of a specifical Ʋnity, there will as really be Two Godheads, and by conse∣quence Two Gods, as any two things speci∣fically united are numerically distinct from one another; and yet this was that which
 Marcellus plainly endeavoured to avoid, by saying, , That the Godhead of the Father and the Son was inseparable and indivisible, as it appears by what is immediately subjoyned,  that is, He that se∣parates or divides the Son, that is, the Word from God (the Father) Almighty, it is neces∣sary either that he assert Two Gods, which is repugnant to Scripture, or that he deny the Son to be God, which seems to be every whit as inconsistent with the Catholic Faith as the other. In which Words it is as plain as Words can make it, that he affirms, there is but  one Almighty, and that Christ himself is that one Almighty, or that he does not differ from him, because upon supposition that he did; one of these two things must be granted, either that Christ was not God, which he rejects as repugnant to the Scrip∣ture, or that there must be at once  Two Gods, at least Numerically distinct, which is all the sence in which it is possible to conceive of Two Gods, supposing them both to be Omnipresent, Omnipotent and
 Infinitely Perfect Beings, (and otherwise then this they are not properly Gods) For they will both of them have the same At∣tributes, and the same Perfections, and so can be only Numerically distinct from one another, from whence it follows, that if the Numerical distinction be not of its self sufficient to introduce a Plurality of Gods, then there can be no Polytheisme in the world, that is Polytheism strictly and proper∣ly so called, and understood of several Beings infinitely perfect.
Besides that, the Specifick Ʋnity, as it is in it self perfect Non-sence, as hath been already sufficiently declared, so is it per∣fectly inconsistent with that notion of the Trinity, to which the Assertors of the Spe∣cific Ʋnity did themselves subscribe; For the Son, as such, is begotten by the Father, and the Holy Ghost, as such, proceeds or flows from the Father and the Son; so that here is a manifest and a confest Subordinati∣on of the one Person to the other, and the Son though he be begotten by an eternal Gene∣ration, though it be true as, the Antient Con∣fessions are used to express it, , That there was no time when he was not, yet it is manifest that an eternal Generation argues an eternal Dependance upon an eter∣nal
 Parent, and an eternal Emanation or Pro∣cession, an eternal Dependance upon an eter∣nal Cause; so that here is self-existence on the one hand, and Dependance on the other; and these two are so far from being specifically united, that they do toto genere, and toto coelo distare, and as the Son hath an eternal dependance on the Father, as his eternal Pa∣rent, so is the Holy Ghost proceeding from both, with respect to the Son, posterior na∣tura, though not cognitione, as the Logici∣ans speak, because there is no time when he was not, so that the Son and Holy Ghost, that is, that Characteristic mark or difference, whatsoever it is, by which the Son and Ho∣ly Ghost are distinguished from the Father and from each other, is on both hands a Creature, though it be an eternal one, de∣pending upon, and eternally flowing from an eternal cause; for that which constitutes the Person of the Son, is the human nature uni∣ted to the Divine, and that which fills up the nature and notion of the Holy Ghost is a certain, subtle, subeternal matter, uni∣ted and incorporated with the Divine and Hu∣man Nature, and animated by the common life of both, and yet though these two things, by which the Persons are distinguish∣ed from each other, and from God the Fa∣ther,
 who is the Source and Fountain of the Godhead, are without all question Creatures of his making, yet the whole Person which results on either hand from the Ʋnion of the Created and Ʋncreated Nature together, is truly and properly God; for by God no∣thing else is or can be understood, but a Person acted and animated by a life that is truly and properly Divine, and such with∣out question both of these Persons are, o∣therwise there can be no vital Ʋnion be∣tween the created and uncreated Nature in them, which is that upon which their Di∣vine personality depends, and as they may all three, as well the one as the other, be tru∣ly and properly said to be God, so also, notwithstanding what hath been said yet, is the Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate, that is the Godhead which is in the whole Person, the eternal, simple, abstracted Life in the one, the cause of life and personality, and the principal in∣gredient of life and personality in the two o∣ther, which are Persons of a Dissimilar, He∣terogeneous and Compounded Nature, (and the whole Person is rightly denominated from its principal and chiefest Life) is in all three not only Ʋncreate, but Numerically the same, so that there are not three Ʋncreates, but
 one Ʋncreate, nor three Incomprehensibles, but one Incomprehensible, nor three Gods, but one God, as it is expresly asserted in that Creed, which goes, how truly I do not now di∣spute, under the Name of Athanasius, and was allowed for Orthodox, before the La∣teran Council.
But yet, as the rest of the Trinitarian Fathers, when they were pressed by the Arians or other Heretics, or disputed and argued the case too nicely with them∣selves, were used to recur to the Specific Ʋnity, and the Emperichoresis and the Ʋnity of Integration, and such like very improper and inadequate expedients to help them∣selves, so Marcellus being equally at a loss how to explain the Doctrine of the Trinity, being a firm and resolute Assertor of the Ʋ∣ty of the Godhead, and disdaining to make use of such Ʋnphilosophical ways of solving the difficulty, which was in effect, but to make a new riddle instead of explaining the old, though he could not for his life, being, as he was, a very honest and imparti∣al Person, bring himself to doubt, but that the Language of the Scripture, in its most plain and obvious Interpretation, did as∣sert the Divinity of Christ and of the Holy Ghost, yet at some times being startled with
 the difficulty of the thing, he would say, with something of doubt and hesitation, betwixt the difficulty of the thing, and the plainness of the Scripture, in asserting and maintaining it, that the Scripture did seem to say thus much; for so in the Confession sent to Julius, he says of those that deni∣ed the Divinity of the Son, , which seems to be repugnant to the Orthodox Faith groun∣ded upon the Scriptures, for that is his meaning, as it follows in the next words, , for so the Evangelist St. John tells us, that the word was God, but yet it must be confessed that this Interpretation, which I have put upon the word  is not the only possible Interpretation, neither, as I do verily be∣lieve so agreeable to the Sentiments of Mar∣cellus, as another which I will now menti∣on, and that is that by  may be un∣derstood, not as if he had spoken doubt∣fully, that the Scripture seems to look that way, as if Christ were a Divine Person as well as God the Father, but that he really is so, and that this appears plainly to be the sence of the Scriptures; for so the word seems to have been used in that place of the Author to the Hebrews, where God is
 said to have made the things that are seen out of things which did not appear, , that is, out of things which re∣ally were not, and so  in this place are things, not which barely appear or are sup∣posed to be, but which have a real, undoub∣ted and positive existence, and in this sense the Adjectives  and  are used, not for things which are only in fancy or opi∣nion, but which have a real and a mani∣fest Existence, and are discovered by their own light; and it is plain, that this sense is most agreeable to what follows in Mar∣cellus; , &c. But I, saith he, have learnt or know for certain, that the Son is the indivisible or inseparable Power of the Father; for our Saviour himself, even our Lord Jesus Christ saith, I am in the Father and the Father in me, and I and the Father are one, and he that hath seen me hath seen the Father also, which citations of his, as they cannot so clearly and so naturally be ap∣plied to any thing, as to the Numerical Es∣sence, so when he saith, , I know, or I have learnt for certain, that the Son, &c. The Rules of Connection do re∣quire that this be spoken in opposition to the two Opinions just mentioned before, one of which asserted a Plurality of Gods; and
 the other denyed the Divinity of Christ, and being exprest in such peremptory, dog∣matical and categorical Terms; this is a plain and undenyable Testimony of Marcel∣lus to himself, that he was for the singular existent Essence, which he did not only maintain in this Epistle to Pope Julius, but he tells him it had always been his constant Doctrine; for so he goes on, ; This Faith I having received from the Scriptures and Tradition I preach in the Church, as well as I have owned and asserted it in this Epistle to you.
Nevertheless, for that he would not pre∣sume as others did, when they were prest upon it by their Adversaries, or intangl'd in their own private Meditations, to explain the Modus of the Trinity; for this reason he was charged by his Enemies with deny∣ing the thing it self, as if in effect he had asserted but one divine Person, because he stuck to one Numerical Substance, without so much as pretending to explain, how it was possible for a Trinity of Persons at this rate to exist; this was the reason, why Athanasi∣us himself would sometimes speak with doubt and hesitancy concerning him, or at
 least make broad signs, as Epiphanius would have it, as if he were not far from Heresy, and it was the occasion likewise, why Pho∣tinus, who was Scholar to Marcellus, sticking to his Master's Sentiments concerning the Numerical Ʋnity or singular existent Essence of the divine Nature, and not being able upon this supposition to explain the Modus of a Trinity of Persons, did at last run headlong into that desperate Heresie, which is answer'd by that of the Socinians now a days, and therefore Petavius rightly calls the Men of that perswasion the Novi Photini∣ani, and did not only deny the Divinity of the Person of Christ, as well as that of the Holy Ghost, considered as a distinct Per∣son from God the Father, but which was more then ever was asserted or believed by the Arians themselves, he affirmed of Christ, that he had no manner of Being or Existence Antecedent to his Conception, in the Womb of the Blessed Virgin.
But though the Doctrine of Marcellus, which was very peremptory for the singu∣lar Essence, without explaining the mode of it, gave occasion to the Heresie of Pho∣tinus, yet that in this he plainly degenera∣ted from the Sentiments of his Master, may be seen not only from what hath been said
 already, but also from an Epistle still ex∣tant in Epiphanius, which was written by several Presbiters and Deacons, professing and avowing themselves to be Marcellians, to several Bishops of the Province of Dio∣caesarea, who were then under Banishment for their adherence to the Orthodox Religi∣on, wherein they declare themselves to stand firmly to the declarations and defini∣tions of the Nicene Council; they condemn the Heresies of Arius and Sabellius, and Photinus and P. Samosatenus, as also those of the Manichees and Valentinians, in as plain words as it is possible for the Greek Language to speak, which is, I think, a suf∣ficient Justification of Marcellus himself, who could not have such Disciples, with∣out being a more Orthodox Master, then some of his Enemies would represent him to have been, besides that it is to be con∣sidered, that this Epistle being written to Men under Banishment and in affliction, as it is probable, in the Reign of Constantius, who persecuted the Orthodox with a Vati∣nian hatred, and a cruelty nothing inferi∣or to that of the Blackest Tyrants, it is the greater Argument of the sincerity of the Writers, the greater Justification of Marcel∣lus, whose Disciples they do so openly de∣clare
 themselves to be, and perhaps one of the best proofs that can be alledged of the general Sentiments of the Council of Nice, which they pretend to follow, in favour of the singular Essence.
Lastly, For a still more clear and irrefra∣gable Elucidation of this matter, and to show still further, what were the Appre∣hensions of the Nicene Fathers generally speaking, and at such times when they did not dispute nicely, either with themselves or others, concerning the Mode in which the Godhead may be said to be one, not∣withstanding there be granted to be a Tri∣nity of Divine Persons, I will here produce three Testimonies of Epiphanius, with which I will conclude this business. The first is this Ancorat. p. 120. Ed. Petav. where he con∣demns and censures the Impiety of the A∣rians; in these remarkable words, . That is, the Arians are of all other Heretics, the most wicked and prophane, who have dared to divide and alienate the Son from the substance of the Father, not vouchsa∣fing to make him equal in Glory with the
 Father, nor allowing that he is begotten of the Fathers substance; from which words, which were without question spo∣ken by Epiphanius agreeably, as he thought, to the Catholic Doctrine of Nice, there are two things especially to be observed, First, that he condemns the Arians for dividing the substance of the Son from that of the Father, which yet there is no question but all Men do, who are not friends to the Nu∣merical Essence, at the same time Co-existing in the three Persons, and here it is remark∣able that he makes use of two several words,  and , by the first of which a Numerical and by the second a Specifical or Generical difference is manifest∣ly to be understood, this being the most easie and natural sence of the words, and without this, one of them must be acknow∣ledged to be altogether superfluous and re∣dundant, besides that, though the latter in∣cluded the sense of the first, yet the first will by no means comprehend and take in the sense of the latter, so that the Arians being here condemned for two things, first, for making the Son a substance distinct from the substance of the Father, and secondly, for making him a substance of another Na∣ture, as well Specifically as Numerically Di∣stinct,
 nothing can be plainer, then that Epiphanius in this place was an Assertor of the Numerical Essence.
But secondly, he reproves the Arians for denying the Son to be begotten , of the Substance of the Father, as Epiphanius and all the Nicene Fathers asser∣ted that he was, and they acknowledging him as they did, to be a Divine Substance United to an Humane, and it being impos∣sible for one Divine Substance to beget ano∣ther, which being once admitted, it will make an infinite possibility of numberless and endless Gods, and is in it self as down∣right Nonsence, as it is possible for any no∣tion never so absurd to be, one of these three things must of necessity be allowed, either that that Phrase is impious and pro∣phane, that it tends to Polytheism in the most absurd and foolish sense of that word, and yet the only proper sense in which it is possible for Polytheism properly so called to be understood, or that it is impertinent and insignificant, or that it includes in it an Assertion of the Numerical Nature, or the singular existent Essence.
This is the first of the three places pro∣posed to be produced out of Epiphanius: The second is, where going about to prove
 the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, from 1 Cor. c. 2. v. 10. The Spirit teacheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. He argues thus, . That which is not of the substance of God, it is impossible that it should search out the deep things of God, that is, that which is not of the same Numerical Substance; for the sense of the Argument must be taken from the comparison: which is this, the Spirit of God searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God; for what Man knoweth the things of of a Man, save the Spirit of a Man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God: Now no Man will pretend that the Spirit and Mind of one Man, knoweth the Spirit or Mind of another, or is acquainted with the in∣ward and concealed operation of his Ʋn∣derstanding and Will, so that either there is no comparison, or the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Man, must on both sides be understood, not of the Specifical but Nu∣merical Nature, and to say that Epiphanius, or those from whom he borrowed it, for there is no question but it was the recei∣ved Argument of the Orthodox in those times, neither he or they, though they ur∣ged a good Argument, yet understood
 wherein the strength of it lay, but that on the contrary they did not argue ad idem, and that according to them, it was no Ar∣gument at all, is at once precarious and rude into the bargain, and is almost like the monstrous absurdity of the Epicurean Doctrine, that affirms all things to have come by chance, notwithstanding all the out∣strokes, appearances and signatures of the most exquisite Wisdom, and the most per∣fect Skill.
The third and last place of Epiphanius which I shall mention is, where speaking of the Antient formulary of Faith, which he saith was delivered by Tradition from the Apostles, and agreed upon in a Council of 310 Bishops in the , the Holy City, that is, Jerusalem, he explains that Article, which is at present extant in the Nicene confession, and was taken from thence, , Begotten of his Father before all Worlds, by , of the Substance of the Father; now there is no other way to e∣lude the force of that argument which may be drawn from hence, in favour of the singular Essence, but either to question the Authority of Epiphanius without reason, and to say there was never any such Coun∣cil
 at Jerusalem, nor by consequence any such formulary of Faith agreed upon there∣in, or else to affirm with the impious confi∣dence of a down right Atheist, that the A∣postles did not understand themselves, and that notwithstanding all their pretences to a Divine Spirit, they were yet so foolish and ignorant, to believe that one Divine Substance could beget another.
But yet I am far from pretending that all the Fathers of which the Nicene Assem∣bly was composed, were all of them at all times constant and firm, to the defence and maintenance of the singular Essence, no, their fluctuation and uncertainty hath been already sufficiently discovered, and Epi∣phanius himself giving his judgment of the meaning of the word Homoousios, not∣withstanding his Argument which hath been lately produced, to prove the Divi∣nity of the Holy Ghost, speaks thus, , that is, the word , does not signifie Numerically one, but by the word  two perfect natures are to be under∣stood, not differing Specifically from each o∣ther, nor averse from being United into one,

Neither indeed does there seem to have been any after the Arian Heresie sprung up, from that time till a good while after the Nicene Council, who did stoutly and reso∣lutely adhere to the singular Essence, with∣out any wavering or hesitation, notwith∣standing the difficulties with which it was attended, unless it were this Marcellus and his followers, who from their Masters name, are by Epiphanius called Marcelliani, so that it proves true of him what Horace said of another of the name, after all the reproa∣ches and calumnies, with which his Adver∣saies have in vain endeavoured to blast his reputation,

Crescit occulto velut arbor aevo
Fama Marcelli——

And if we consider that it was to Julius Bishop of Rome, who had exactly as to this matter the same Apprehensions with Marcellus himself, to whom that Epistle was written, in which this Orthodox Confession is contained, we may also then go on as Flaccus does.


————micat inter omnes
Julium sidus, velut inter ignes Luna minores.

Or in the Language of another Poet, we may say of Marcellus, with respect to the Trinitarian Bishops, who were used to take shelter in the Specific Identity or other inad∣aequate expedients that have been mentio∣ned.

Aspice ut insignis spoliis Marcellus opimis
Ingreditur, victor{que} viros supreeminet omnes.

And if there be any that stand up firm and faithful to the singular Essence, without be∣traying and exposing it, as the Learned Do∣ctour hath endeavoured to do, we may say of him as Anchises did when he had finish∣ed the Prophetic Character of his Roman Heroe,
Tu Marcellus eris.
And as Marcellus, by his courage and re∣solution, answers the great Character of his glorious Namesake in Virgil, so we may e∣very whit as justly compare the Hesitating
 Fathers, who sometimes seemed to patro∣nise the Numerical Essence, and sometimes to seek Patronage and shelter from it, in ve∣ry improper and inadaequate expedients, such as rather served to delay the time, and afford new matter of rangling and dispute, then either to consute the Arians, or to assure the Victory of the Orthodox Party, to Fabius the Cunctator, who is immedi∣ately before prophetically described by Anchises, and who by frequent halts and countermarches, and by false alarms, with∣out daring to come to the decision of a Battel, prepared Hannibal for the Conquest, first of Marcellus, and then of the great Scipio, from his African Trophies sirnamed Africanus, who removed the Seat of War into the Enemies Country, and perfected that Victory, which Fabius had scarce the hardiness to begin.
But still it is true, that though the Fa∣thers were generally inconstant and uncer∣tain in their resolutions, concerning the Blessed Trinity; yet when ever they swer∣ved from the Numerical Essence, it was on∣ly because of the puzling absurdities with which it was encompassed, as to the man∣ner of it, otherwise there is no question, not only that St. Athanasius and St. Basil,
 and others of the Fathers, who seemed to have wavered in their determinations, but even St. Cyril, Damascen and Gregory Nyssen themselves, would have declared unanimously for the Numerical Essence, by which alone the Ʋnity of the Trinity is possible to be maintained, and which a∣lone could free them from the imputation and absurdity of Polytheism, with which the Specific Ʋnity was encumbred, such an expedient as this, if it could have been found out in those early ages of the Church, would have nipped the Arian Heresie in the bud; it would have silenced the En∣thusiasm of Sabellius (for it was nothing better) and the intollerable impudence of Photinus, and it would have prevented that uncertainty, and those endless jan∣gles which happened among the Orthodox themselves, who being destitute of a solid resolution, exposed themselves and one a∣nother to contempt by inadaequate fancies, the Creatures not of reason, but ignorance and imagination.
All the several Hereticks would have been ashamed of themselves, and would not have dared to elude the force of so many peremptory Texts, in favour of the Divi∣nity of the Son and the Holy Ghost, by far
 fetcht interpretations and distorted expositi∣ons, when not only the Scriptures were plain in their behalf, but also the nature and reason of the thing; this would have rendred the Roman Emperors more favou∣rable then they were to the Orthodox par∣ty, whereas, for want of this, to put an end to all controversies and animosities that might arise by the disagreeing opini∣ons, concerning the modus of the Trinity, disagreeing from each other, and inconsi∣stent even with themselves and with that Doctrine which they pretended to explain, Constantine himself, at the latter end of his Reign, began to favour the party of the Arians, and Constantius during his whole time, was a most bitter Persecutor of the Orthodox Bishops; nay, and in Julian's time the Arians were comparatively Favourites in respect of the others, and so were the Donatists too, who seem to have sided with them; for Donatus himself wrote a Book, de sp. sancto pursuant to the Senti∣ments of Arius and his Party, and in the joynt Reign of Valentinian and Valens, the Part∣ners in the Throne, perhaps out of pruden∣tial and Political reasons, the one Espoused the ones Interest, and the other the others, the better to keep all quiet underneath,
 by the Union of the two consorts, their respective Patrons, in the Imperial Throne.
And as there could not have been a grea∣ter Service done to Christianity, in the Pri∣mitive times, then by finding out a clear or proper expedient, by which the Ʋnity of the Godhead might have been kept in∣violate and sacred, notwithstanding there were a Trinity of Divine Persons, so in this Age there is nothing can so effectually dis∣arm the Socinians, and render them inex∣cusable if they persist any longer in that impious, and if any errour be so, that dam∣nable errour, as the laying down a possi∣ble Idea of a Numerical Substance, branch∣ing it self out without Polytheism or Sabel∣lianism into three intelligible Divine Per∣sons, which will render all their tricks and fetches useless, and not only useless, but monstrously foolish and wicked into the bargain; for so it must needs be thought to sophisticate the sence of Scriptures, and to elude the force of those Arguments that are taken from it by strain'd Interpretati∣ons, when the most natural, obvious and willing sense, inculcated over and over in an hundred places, and upon an hundred occasions, is also reconcileable to humane reason, as well as revealed by Divine Wis∣dom,
 and supported by no less Authority then that of God himself, and therefore this is that which I am now about to do, for the Glory of God, and for the Vindi∣cation of Religion, from the Corruption of Heretics and the Scorn of Atheists, and the method I intend very briefly to proceed in, shall be this; first I will prove by un∣deniable force of Argument, that there are more Divine Persons then one, and second∣ly, I will shew clearly how, notwithstand∣ing this, that it is very possible there may be but one Divine Substance Numerically the same in all the several Personalities where∣in it is found.
For the proof of the first, it will be suf∣ficient to refer you to the discourse it self, to which what I have now written, though it were intended only as a Preface, yet it now begins to swell into so large a bulk that it may pass instead of a Preface, for a Book by it self, and may deserve the Name much better than the thing it self, to which it was designed only as a Prefatory Introduction; For in that Discourse I have undenyably proved the Divinity of the Son, considered as a Person distinct from God the Father, and this is enough for the demonstrative clearing of the first thing
 proposed, viz. That there are more divine Persons than one; but because nothing can be too sure, especially an Article of this Importance, therefore to what I have said already in the following Papers, I will sub∣joyn two things more.
And the first of those two Things, which I shall insist upon, shall be a further Im∣provement of the Story of Melchisedec, which hath been already urged in the fol∣lowing Papers so far, that it would amount already without any further trouble, if pre∣judice were not oftentimes too hard for Demonstration it self, to an unanswerable Demonstration of the Divinity of the Son; this Melchisedek in that Chapter to the He∣brews, from whence my Argument is taken, is compared to the Son of God: For it is said of him, v. 3. that made like unto the Son of God, he abideth a Priest continually, , which signifies as much as made after a Copy, or made by way of Emanation, as  is a Transcript of an Original M. S. and  and  are streams or rays flowing from an Electrical or a Luminous Body, and so in this place it seems as if there were a Pri∣ority of Existence attributed to the Son, af∣ter whose Pattern and Resemblance Melchi∣sedek
 was made, and yet v. 21. that place of the Psalmist is applyed to our Saviour, Thou art a Priest for ever after the Order of Melchisedek, in which the priority of ex∣istence seems to be inverted and attributed not to the Son of God, but to Melchise∣dek to whom he is compared, now it be∣ing utterly impossible and absurd that the same thing or Person with respect to the same should be both Prior and Posterior in existence, it is impossible to reconcile these places any otherwise than by saying that the same Person is compared with himself; and Melchisedek when he is said to be like to the Son of God, is the Priest of the most High God, who appeared to Abra∣ham, compared with that Eternal High-Priest, though he had not yet entred up∣on the actual Administration of his Priestly Office, who saith of himself, before Abra∣ham was I am, God over all, Blessed for ever, and it is true of both of them, and apply∣ed expresly to both, what we find writ∣ten in the beginning of that Verse, without Father, without Mother, without Descent, ha∣ving neither beginning of days, nor end of Life, which cannot be truly spoken of any but God alone; or, in this place, of the e∣ternal Logos, the Word, the Son of God, be∣gotten
 of his Father before all Worlds by an Eternal Generation; and there being but one God or one Son of God in this Superlative and transcendent Sense; it is manifest that the same Person is compared with himself, and as Melchisedek appearing in human shape is here compared to the Eternal Son, and in the Comparison is considered as po∣sterior to him, notwithstanding he were the very same with him that had existed eternally, and from everlasting without any such humane bodily appearance, and in this respect might well enough be said to be prior or antecedent to him, prior to himself as perfectly incorporeal, with re∣spect to himself, as afterwards united to the reality or appearance of an human Body; so is the same Melchisedek, though subse∣quent to the Son of God in that Sense, which hath been declared, yet prior to the same considered as incarnate and born after∣wards in the Fulness of Time of the Virgin Mary; for this Melchisedek that appeared to Abraham was a Type and Figure of Christ incarnate, and by consequence was really be∣fore him; that is, before Christ being born of the Virgin Mary appeared in the Flesh, and dwelt among us, and so Christ is a Priest for ever after the Order of Melchisedek, as well as
 Melchisedek was made like to the Son of God; that is, he is God and Man united to∣gether into one common Person, as Mel∣chisedek was, and taking not only humane Nature, which he did before, but human Flesh upon him, as Melchisedek appeared to Abraham to have done, though in truth it were neither better nor worse than only the Son of God, or the Eternal Word Ʋni∣ted by divine Power to a Vehicle of fitly mo∣dify'd Air, or other subtle matter, and by that means carrying the external shape and appearance of an human Body.
And that Melchisedek, who is the same with Christ, was God as well as Man, and Man as well as God, that is, that there was a real and vital Ʋnion of two distinct Natures, the Divine and the Humane in his Person, is so unquestionably evident from the same place, that as it is the extremity of impudence and Impiety in conjunction together, to call in question the Authority of this Writer, who hath been allowed for Canonical, and received as such in all Ages of the Church, so it is absurd and foolish to make the least doubt or scruple of his meaning, if his Authority be once recei∣ved.

That he was God is plain, and will for ever continue to be so, to the eternal con∣fusion of all the Arian and Socinian cavils, till they can shew us a Creature, to whom this Character may justly be applied, with∣out Father, without Mother, without Descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life: And as this Character proclaims him God, so his being a Priest, does at the same time confess him to be a Man, other∣wise God will be a Priest to himself, which is absurd, but as, without the Godhead Ʋ∣nited to the Humane Nature, Christ who was a Priest after the order of Melchisedec, could not have made an adaequate expia∣tion to God the Father, for the sins of the whole World, the value of the Priest and Sacrifice by him offered, which was the Sa∣crifice of himself upon the Cross, being en∣hanced to an infinite and estimable price, by the infinite perfection and dignity of the Person, who was God as well as Man; so, that he was Man as well as God, is ex∣presly testifyed by the sacred PenMan him∣self, now consider, saith he, how this great Man, &c. and without his being Man as well as God, it was impossible for him to be ei∣ther Priest or Sacrifice at all, so that these things, I think, are so plain, that it is im∣possible
 for plainness and perspicuity them∣selves to be more, so plain, that I need stay no longer upon this first particular, and therefore I proceed.
The second thing which I had in my mind, was that Miracle of Joshua, which we find recorded, Josh. 10. 12. where Jo∣shua speaks thus to the Sun and Moon, Sun, stand thou still in Gibeon and thou Moon in the Valley of Ajalon, and then it follows, v. 13, 14. And the Sun stood still and the Moon stayed until the People had avenged them∣selves upon their Enemies, is not this written in the Book of Jasher? so the Sun stood still in the midst of Heaven, and hasted not to go down, about a whole day, and there was no day like that before or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a Man, for the Lord fought for Israel. Now Joshua in several respects, in his Name, and in that he was the Introductor of the Israelites into the Land of Canaan, which was Typical of the eternal rest and peace of the future State, after the toyls, hazzards and temptations of this, was figurative and significative of Je∣sus, the Messias that was to come, who had nature at his beck, as being the God of it, and at the instant of whose Pas∣sion, as if Nature her self had been expi∣ring
 with him, the Sun was darkned and the day was turned into night, and nature her self put on Mourning, to attend the Fu∣neral Solemnity of her Lord and Maker, as it is said to have happened at the death of Caesar, which was taken and represented, either by the superstition or flattery of the Romans, for a certain argument of his A∣pothesis.

Ille etiam extincta miseratus Caesare Romam,
Tunc caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit,
Impiaque aeternam timuerunt saecula noctem.


The Sun condoling with afflicted Rome,
When Caesar fell by an untimely doom;
Withdrew his conscious and offended light,
And guilty nations fear'd eternal night.

But not to stretch this Type any further then it will go, I do confess, that if any Man will deny so much to have been pre∣signifyed by this miracle of Joshua as I have represented, I know not how to prove it, only I leave it to be considered fairly be∣tween Man and Man, whether the allusion be not fairly drawn, and whether in con∣currence with other arguments, which prove more directly and with greater force,
 it ought not to corroberate the Doctrin of the Divinity of Christ, though the passages that have been cited concerning Melchise∣dec alone, if there were nothing else to be considered, are enough to demonstrate unanswerably all that is contended for, and stand in no need of any other confir∣mation.
Wherefore it being thus clear, if we will submit our selves to the Authority of Scrip∣ture, and to the Voice of God himself, that there are indeed more Divine Persons then one, it remains now only, that I enquire very briefly, how it is possible for a plurali∣ty of Persons, distinct from one another, to be consistent with a Numerical Identity of Divine Substance, which the voluminous Creatour of the Intellectual System denies, as an impossible and contradictious notion, where speaking of the word Homoousios, and saying that it was never used other∣wise by Greek Writers, then to signifie the agreement of things Numerically differing from one another, in some common Nature or universal Essence; or their having a ge∣nerical Ʋnity or Identity, he adds; nor in∣deed; is it likely that the Greek Tongue should have any name for that, which nei∣ther is a thing in nature nor falls under hu∣man
 Conception; (viz.) several things ha∣ving one and the same singular Essence; and here, though the Doctor did not distinguish so nicely as he ought to have done, betwixt things and persons, yet I will grant him thus much, that several things being supposed to be several, are at the same time what they are Numerically by themselves; and are Nu∣merically dictinct from one another.
But yet it does not follow, but that se∣veral persons may all have the same Nume∣rical Divine Substance, tho' to make a distin∣ction of persons in this case, there be re∣quisite an accession of some individuating Circumstances or Properties, which shall be superadded to the common Nature; and this is a great errour of which the Doctor, is guilty, if it be consistent with the inso∣lence of his humor to endure to be told of his faults, because several things cannot be the same (which is no such very deep and profound speculation, for how can they be several and the same at the same time) there∣fore several Persons indued with several in∣dividuating differences cannot be partakers of the same common nature, which is false, as I will now immediately show you, pro∣ceeding with all imaginable caution, that the intellectual System being a wild coun∣try,
 and very full of woods; I may not unadvisedly fall into an Ambuscade, by the following well weigh'd and well consider∣ed steps.
First, I say, that that which is in it self one, cannot be conceived as three with∣out division.
Secondly, that those things which are in themselves distinctly three, cannot be con∣ceived as one without composition.
Thirdly, that the Divine Nature being in∣finitely and immutably perfect, is like∣wise simple and uncompounded, uncapa∣ble of division on the one hand or compo∣sition on the other.
Fourthly, by God the Father I understand that simple, similar, and Omnipresent Divine Substance or space, endued with all possi∣ble power, goodness and wisdom, whose parts, by reason of the Omnipresence of the whole, are even by cogitation inseparable from each other, or that Omnipresent Divine acti∣vity, and life, which is as much and more simply one, in and with it self, then any o∣ther secondary or derivative life can be, being all over nothing else but one entire Will, Ʋnderstanding, Goodness, Fruitful∣ness, or Power of Action and Production, which being only that which is truly and
 properly God, is therefore called God the Father, as being the most simple in it self, and also the source and fountain of Divinity in the two subordinate Persons, for the Persons are not equally perfect as to their whole nature, although the Divine Sub∣stance which makes them all to be God, be in all three Numerically and individually the same.
Fifthly, by God the Son I understand the second Person of the Blessed Trinity, resul∣ting from the Ʋnion of the humane Nature, with the Divine Substance, which Divine Substance being endued and furnished with a life by it self, is for that reason a Person by it self, simply and abstractly consider∣ed; for this is the most general and com∣prehensive notion of a Person, that it is a being endued with life, or with self-con∣sciousness or self-sensation, to which Di∣vine Life the Human being added, and be∣ing influenced, animated and acted by it, and vitally united to it; there arises from hence a compound life, which is distinct from the simple (which is a life by it self, without the accession of the other,) and if a life and a person be the very same, then another sort of life makes another sort of Person, and another sort of per∣son
 is another person, that is a compound Person, which is no more the same with simple, then unity and composition are them∣selves the same.
But to make the solidity of this notion the more plainly to appear, it is to be con∣sidered, that though these two natures, the Divine and the Human are always vitally united to one another, so as they feel and enjoy the same common life, yet there are some cases to be met with, wherein the Father, that is the Divine and Simple Sub∣stance acts as a Person distinctly by it self, without the concurrence of the Human with it, and there are others wherein they act in concurrence together, as if they had but one Will, one Ʋnderstanding, one sim∣ple and undivided Power of Action and O∣peration.
To the first of these Heads there are the following particulars unquestionably be∣longing.
First, when the Father is said to beget and the Son to be begotten, which he did from all Eternity by way of Emanation, as it is very easie for any Man to conceive he might do, for whatsoever is not in it self impossible and contradictory to be done or performed, is a possible object of the
 Divine Power, and was so without questi∣on from all Eternity, because the Divine Nature was always absolutely and infinite∣ly perfect, and by consequence the sphere of possibility, to which it is coextended, (for there is nothing possible which is not so a Divine Power) was from all Eternity exactly the same, though there had not been that eternal congruity and disposition, which there appears to have been in the Divine Nature, to the production of the Human, by that means, as it were, to ex∣emplifie and enjoy it self in its most per∣fect image and resemblance, and the Fa∣ther when he is said to have begotten the Son, it is not by any means so to be under∣stood, as if one Divine Substance could be∣get another, which is the very height of Non-sense and Blasphemy into the bargain; but these two things are manifestly couch∣ed under it, and to be understood by it; First, that the Father that is the simple and similar, ubiquitary Divine Substance, did from all Eternity, by way of emanation, pro∣duce that Human soul or Personality, which was the pre-existing soul of Christ before his Incarnation and before all Worlds, being the first born of every Creature.

Secondly, he did likewise from all Eter∣nity constitute a vital Ʋnion, betwixt his own simple and ubiquitary Substance, and this eternally begotten or emanatively produ∣ced Human Soul, so as they were made to feel and enjoy one another, and where ever there is an Ʋnity of self-consciousness and re∣ciprocal enjoyment of each others life, so as the human life does at the same time parti∣cipate and share in the Divine, this is e∣nough to constitute one common person, resulting from the vital Ʋnion of the Di∣vine and Human Nature, into this common life and mutual enjoyment; for an Ʋnity of life is the most strict, inseparable, and indivisible sort of Ʋnity that can possibly be conceived, and yet, notwithstanding, the Human Nature, though it were eternally produced, yet it did not nor could not pos∣sibly produce it self, which is to suppose a thing or person to be before it is, neither did it or could it possibly unite it self in that entire and close manner with the Di∣vine, but in both these respects, the Hu∣man Nature is originally passive, though to the latter it may be supposed to concur by a consent of Will though not of Power, and God the Father, that is, the simple and ori∣ginal Divine Substance is considered as a per∣son acting by himself.

In the second place, when the Father is said to send and the Son to be sent, here the Father or the simple and self-existing Divine Substance is to be considered as a Person by it self, and acting apart from the Son who is said to be sent; for in the first place, the Divine Substance which is Ʋbiquitary and Omnipresent, cannot be said with respect unto it self, either to send or to be sent; for whatsoever is Omnipresent, is at the same time considered as immoveable and quies∣cent, there being no place into which it is possible for it to remove, and this per∣haps may not improbably be lookt upon as one eternal cause of the blessedness and Tranquillity of the Divine Nature, that by reason of its Omnipresence it is always per∣fectly at rest within it self, it is impassible from it self and from any thing without it, it being impossible it should yield or give place to any impressions, or that it should be capable of any motion, mutability or change, in which the very nature of true happiness consists, for perfect rest and perfect peace go together,
Secondly, It is absurd to say that one Di∣vine Substance can send another; for this were to suppose a plurality of Gods, which hath been already sufficiently exploded,
 besides that to send implying a superiori∣ty, and to be sent a subjection, both of which are absolutely impossible and ab∣surd, with respect to two Divine or infi∣nitely perfect substances compared together, it is likewise absurd in this respect to affirm of one Divine Substance, that it sends or commands, or that it is obedient to, or is sent by another.
Thirdly, though the Human Nature of Christ be so intimately twisted with, and so vitally Ʋnited to the Divine and Omnipresent Substance of God the Father, as that these two lives, the Divine and the Human, do by this means become one life, and have a mutual self-consciousness and enjoyment of each other, so as to constitute the same Per∣son, the unity of Person consisting in nothing else but an unity of common life, yet when we speak of sending and being sent, this in the utmost propriety of Speech can be understood of nothing else but the Hu∣man Nature of Christ, which being former∣ly Ʋnited (for it is but finite, and by con∣sequence cannot be adequately coextended to the whole divine space, which is infinite and Omnipresent) to that part of the Di∣vine space where the most perfect and the most highly honoured and exalted Spirits
 have their sublime and glorious abode, far above the dreggs and impurities of this Earthy Region, was in the fulness of time, for wise and gracious purposes, predetermin∣ed and preordained of God, from everlast∣ing, commanded to descend into it; and adding human flesh to human nature, to ap∣pear in the likeness of a mortal Man, and to put on the form of a Servant, notwith∣standing that the vital union betwixt the Father and him continued all this while, and being really united in that intire and vital manner, to any one part of the Divine Substance or space; it was as much in some sense, as if he had been really and adaequate∣ly coextended to the whole, because, tho' in this Divine space, it may be said of this, what is in general true of all extension, that it hath partem extra partem, so that this part is not that, or vice versa, yet in the first place the parts of an Omnipresent extention, are therefore utterly inseparable and indivisible, even by cogitation from each other, because the whole is Omnipresent and fills the very utmost possibility of space, and in the second, tho' the parts be never so distinct, yet are they all of them acted by the same Divine Life, which is one self-con∣sciousness or self-sensation running through
 the whole, indivisible, inseparable and tyed to it self, by an Ʋnity of self-enjoyment, which is the highest, the noblest and the strictest unity in the nature of things, by which means it comes to pass, as it is plain it must do, that whatsoever is vitally uni∣ted to any part of this Divine space, which is all of it animated by one indivisible and inseparable life, is at the same time effectu∣ally united to the whole, and hath always the highest and the closest enjoyment and imbibition of that Divine life, which a finite Substance is capable of receiving.
But yet in this action of sending and be∣ing sent, it is not the Human nature but the Divine that sends, and it is not the Divine nature but the Human that is sent, and as the Father is said to beget the Son in these two senses, which have been already ex∣plained; first, that he begat or produced the human nature of Christ, out of the emana∣tive fruitfulness of the Divine substance, by an eternal generation; secondly, that by the same emanative and eternal power and goodness, he did vitally unite this first born of all the Creatures, the only begotten Son of God, in that immediate and emanative sense, into a feeling, and enjoyment of his own Divine substance and life; so that they be∣came
 one Person, which may very truly and properly be said to be God, as being deno-Minated, as there is all the reason in the world it should, from the principal & chiefest life, so the descent of the Human Nature of Christ, from one part of the divine substance to another, notwithstanding, that it were all the while vitally and consciously united to that Divine life, which is indivisibly, in∣separably and self-consciously the same, through all the parts of the Divine substance or space, is as plainly asserted, as it is possi∣ble for words to express it, in that passage of St. John. c. 3. 13. where our Saviour saith concerning himself, No Man hath as∣cended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in Heaven; in which place by Heaven, God or the Divine space was understood in the Language of the Jews, and by his coming down from thence, was meant the remo∣val of his Human substance from one part of this Divine space to another, and by his be∣ing in Heaven, as every Man is in some sense, being included in the large comprehension of the Divine space, is meant in a more es∣pecial manner (for it is manifest that some∣thing peculiar to himself is here exprest) the vital union of the two natures together,
 by which he was really God as well as Man, and by his ascending thither, notwithstan∣ding that his Human substance continued all this while below, is meant, that he that is vitally united to any one part of the Divine space, does at the same time enjoy a most entire and perfect Communion with the whole, by reason of that indivisible and in∣separable Life, which enjoys it self fully, perfectly and entirely in every part of the divine space, which is the strictest Bond of Ʋnity that can be conceived, and by which all the parts, besides that they are actually inseparable by reason of the Omni∣presence of the whole, are still more closely and intimately connected with each other, as if they were all the very same.
Thirdly, in that Prayer of our Saviours uttered in the bitter Agonies of his human nature immediately before his Passion; O my Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me, nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt, which the Evangelist assures us to have been three times repeated; it is manifest that the divine nature or substance is consider'd as a distinct and separate Person by it self, endued and furnished with a distinct Will from that of the human nature, and though it be true that in the human nature it self,
 there was an absolute resignation to the di∣vine Will; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt; yet these Words themselves do sufficiently express it to have been only a passive resignation, and an Instance not so much of Inclination as Obedience, it was an Instance of submission and reluctancy toge∣ther; O my Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me, nevertheless, not as I will, but ast thou wilt, and the reluctancy of the fleshly nature, or of the human Soul uni∣ted to a Body of Flesh and Blood (for in that it consisted) was so much the more painful and exquisitely tormenting, by rea∣son that it was, as it were, a tearing in sun∣der the divine and the human Nature, which were at once united by the strongest Bond of Ʋnion; and for that reason must needs be the most tenderly and painfully sensible of any Divorce or Disagreement between them; for in the first place, it was not on∣ly a very old but an eternal Ʋnion, there being no time when the human nature of Christ was not, or when it was not united to the divine: Secondly, it was an Ʋnion of Emanation proceeding from, or begotten by, the Eternal Fruitfulness of that divine Substance, which is called God the Father, which shews it not to be a positive union,
 but a natural; an Ʋnion whose parts are actually inseparable, and therefore upon supposition, that the Natures thus united are indued with Life, and that both, or either of these Natures are passible and capable of being affected with pain; the least en∣deavour or tendency towards a Separation must cause an exquisite regret, anguish and pain in that part of the Composition, which is passible and subject to it; wherefore the Ʋnion of the divine and human Nature in the Person of Christ, being an Ʋnion of Affection and Will, an Ʋnion of Intellect and Ʋnderstanding, so far as the human Nature is capable of Ʋnderstanding, and imbibing the Wisdom of the Divine, and an Ʋnion of Life, Self-consciousness and mu∣tual Enjoyment; it must needs be, that in the human Nature, which is confessedly passible, upon the least disagreement or re∣pugnancy of it to the Will of the Divine, there must arise a most quick, acute and pungent Sense, created in the humanity in∣carnate, betwixt the reasonable and the fleshly Nature, the first of which resigns it self up perfectly to the most perfect Wis∣dom, to which it hath a vital congruity and with which it studies always to preserve a most perfect agreement, and finds a com∣placency
 in being conformed to it, withal considering the important Reasons, for which it was necessary that he should suf∣fer upon the Cross, and become a Sacrifice for the Sins of the World, in which the Divine Wisdom, Goodness and Justice were all of them in a manner equally concerned, but the latter full of human Passions, Apprehensi∣ons and Fears had a Dread and Abhorrence of such a cruel Death, and by consequence found within it self a strange reluctancy, and an unwillingness almost as painful, as the most tormenting and cruel Death it self, to undergo it; besides that being at the same time vitally and personally united to the divine Substance, this was another, and without question the most bitter part of the Agony, which our Saviour underwent be∣twixt submission to the divine Will and relu∣ctancy against it, both of which it did at the same time, by the Combat of the rea∣sonable and the incarnate life, one of which could not think of death, without a most passionate and painful aversation, and to the other disobedience was worse than death, to an extremity not to be exprest, so that though it was only the human na∣ture of Christ, which properly speaking, suf∣fered upon the Cross, yet by reason of the
 intimate Ʋnion of it with the Divine, he suffered infinitely more than any other Man could do.
Fourthly, in that Action by which the Fa∣ther or the divine Substance perpetually feels and enjoys it self, and adaequately under∣stands and comprehends the whole extent and latitude of its own infinite and abso∣lute Perfection, in that Action the Father is considered as a Person acting by himself, and because there is no assignable moment of Eternity when he does not do this, there∣fore he does always really preserve a distin∣ction of his Person and Substance, from the Person of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, as well as by being from, and to, all Eternity vitally united to the human Nature of Christ, and to a certain subtle and aethe∣rial Matter, he does at the same time con∣cur to the making up of two other Per∣sons, in that manner which hath been, and shall be still hereafter more fully and par∣ticularly declared; for though the human Nature of Christ be not only the most per∣fect in it's kind, but without question the most perfect of any finite, immaterial Sub∣stance whatsoever, though you take in all the Hierarchy of Angels and Immortal Spi∣rits, and though by being personally and
 vitally, and that from all Eternity, united to the divine Substance, it must needs for this reason have the truest Enjoyment, and the fullest comprehension and understanding of it, of any other Creature whatsoever, yet as being but a Creature, though an eternal one, as being but a finite Substance though incomparably and indisputably the most perfect of any other finite Substance whatsoever, it cannot have a just and ad∣equate comprehension of an infinitely per∣fect Nature; For nothing can adequately and fully comprehend that which is really infinite, or which is all one, which is en∣dued with all possible Perfection, which is not so it self, and this the humane nature of Christ is not, neither indeed can it be, un∣less you suppose the divine and humane na∣ture of Christ, to be the same; for all that is meant by the divine nature, is a nature endued with all possible perfection, so that it remains firm what I have asserted in this fourth particular, that in that action in which God the Father, or the Divine Substance feels, enjoys and understands himself in a full, perfect, adaequate and truly comprehensive manner, he is to be considered as a Person acting by himself, distinct from the Persons of the Son and Holy Ghost.

Fifthly, in that Action or Operation of the Divine mind, by which at once he surveys the whole possibility of things, and hath all their Ideas and all their several pro∣perties, differences, relations, connexions and dependencies at the same time present to him, which he always hath, and which it is absolutely impossible for any finite or li∣mited understanding, at any one time to comprehend together, in this action like∣wise, in its full extent; the Father is consi∣dered as a Person by himself, and is really so; for although, as to many particulars there may be, and actually is, a concur∣rence of the Divine understanding, and the Human together, so as to view several of these Ideas at the same time, and with a common prospect, and to have exactly the same notion and apprehension concerning them; it being impossible for the Human understanding to differ from the Divine, so far as it is capable of imbibing it, and of being influenced and acted by it, which it always is to the utmost of its capacity, (which is but finite) and so far they act as a common Person informed and amma∣ted by one common life,, yet where the Hu∣man understanding will not reach, as it will not certainly extend to the utmost possi∣bility
 of Ideas, at one and the same time, which implies infinite knowledge, or know∣ledge in its utmost Latitude and Perfection, an attribute belonging to the Divine Sub∣stance, and incommmunicable with any other, there this Divine Substance is again consi∣dered▪ in this fifth particular, as a Person acting distinctly by it self.
Sixthly and lastly, in the actuation of those Divine Ideas, or in the bringing them out of a state of notion into a state of re∣ality and extra-notional Existence, or in the Creation of the material and intellectual World, together, with the several modifi∣cations and motions of the one, the several orders and degrees of the other; in this al∣so the Father is to be considered as acting by himself, the Power of Creation, or the producing realities out of a state of non-ex∣istence, out of a state of possibility into a state of being, and from a state of notion into a state of impenetrability, tangibility or life, be∣ing only competible to God himself, and be∣longing only to infinite Power, as the Ideas themselves, which were the principles and patterns, according to which the realities were made, could not in their full extent and comprehension, and at one and the same time, be present to any wisdom or under∣standng,
 but that which was infinite, and by consequence Divine, though I deny not but that the Son, that is, the human nature in conjunction with the divine; for of it self it could not do it, may in some sense be said to have made the World, as the Scripture asserts him to have done, and in what sense that is, shall be now very sud∣denly and very clearly declared.
For as there are some operations of the divine nature to be met with, wherein the Father or the simple divine substance acts as a distinct Person by it self, without the con∣currence of the human nature, so there are others wherein the divine and human na∣ture act joyntly, and as it were confede∣rately together, and are considered as one common person endued with one common life, understanding and will, and they are these.
First, in the business of Creation, which though it hath been already appropriated as an incommunicable act to the simple di∣vine substance; yet we find notwithstanding in Scripture, that the Creation of the World is attributed to the Son likewise, that is, to the second person of the blessed Trinity, or to the human nature vitally and perso∣nally united to the divine as well as to God the Father, or to the simple divine substance
 it self, the reasons of which, if I am not mistaken, are principally, if not only, these that follow.
First, that all things being produced out of nothing by the divine power, or by a bare act of the divine will, and the human nature, being vitally and personally united to the divine, so as to be partaker of the life of God, and to be wholly determined and acted by his will, the will of the human nature, being as it were included, absorpt, and swallowed up in the divine, and the one being perfectly determined and acted by the other, whatsoever effect follows any determination or motion of the divine will, may very properly be said to be the effect also of the human, in conjunction with it, and acting as one common person with one indivisible and common determination, it be∣ing no more possible to separate the one will from the other, than it is to dissolve the union of the two natures, or to divide any e∣manative and immediate effect, from its imme∣diate and emanative cause, and it is in a man∣ner the same case as in the Line.



Where if you consider A as the first mo∣ver, and B and C as quiescent, yet B being first moved by the motion of A, the motion of C is rightly affirmed to be owing to them both, acting in common and in conjuncti∣on together; notwithstanding, that the o∣riginal power of moving be wholly to be ascribed to, and to be derived from A, whose Creature B as to its motion is, as C in the same respect may be said to be the com∣mon creature of them both.
Secondly, the human nature of Christ, tho' personally and vitally united to the divine, yet being, as it hath been said already, but a finite nature; and though there were in it a perfect Conjunction and Symphony of will, in all things to the divine will and under∣standing, so far as the sphere of its capacity would reach, yet that capacity being finite and imperfect, it wanted some external helps to give it the more full and comprehensive notion of the divine nature, and by conse∣quence the more large and plentiful enjoy∣ment of it; for which reason it was, that from all Eternity there was Cre∣ated
 a Sub-eternal and Aethereal matter, which being united to and animated by the ubiquitary and original life, which is called God the Father, constituted the third Per∣son of the Blessed Trinity, which is called the Holy Ghost.
Now God being infinitely perfect and happy in himself, it could not be, that this Aethereal matter was produced by him for the more full and perfect enjoyment of him∣self, for there could be nothing in any Crea∣ture, especially an inanimate one, as this sub∣tle matter, without the conjunction and ani∣mation of the divine life, must be, which was not before hand eminently and transcen∣dently to be found in himself, who is con∣sidered as its emanative and its only cause, neither is it reasonable to conceive, though it proceeded from all eternity from the Divine Substance, by way of emanation, that it was created out of no end or de∣sign, or that no use was made of it from all eternity, till in the fulness of time the aspectable Ʋniverse was Created, where∣fore it is but reasonable in this case, to sup∣pose that this subtle matter was employed partly in forming the Vehicles of the Cae∣lestial Hierarchy, the Angels and immortal Spirits, the Morning Stars and Sons of God,
 that sung together and shouted for joy, when the first corner stone of the World was laid, and consequently did exist before it.
And that they were really cloathed with such Aetherial Vehicles or Caelestial Bodies, (as we shall be our selves after the Resurre∣ction, if there be any sense in the 15th. Chap∣ter of the first to the Corinthians, and our Saviour himself assures us, that in the fu∣ture state we shall be  or  as the Angels or equal to the Angels that are in Heaven) seems to me plainly to be asser∣ted by the Psalmist in these words, Psal. 104. 4. Who maketh his Angels Spirits, his Ministers a flaming Fire, not to repeat here what I have Apology for the mid. way & Sermon of the Om∣nipresence. elsewhere said concerning the signification of the word  or An∣gel in the new Testament; and that they had also a pre-existence before the Foundation of the World were laid, seems not obscurely to be imployed by the Psalmist, in that im∣mediately after, as if the next thing to the Creation of Angels, were that of the sensi∣ble and acceptable world, he subjoyns, who laid the Foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
But this is not all, it was further neces∣sary that this subtle matter should be Crea∣ted,
 (for it neither is or can be by it self, any more then a Creature) and that from all Eter∣nity, by an emanative way, that the Son or the second Person of the Blessed Trinity, or the human nature of Christ, vitally and per∣sonally united to the Divine of God the Fa∣ther, might have, from all Eternity, the more large and comprehensive notion of that infinitely perfect nature, to which it was thus vitally and personally united, and by consequence might be the more closely uni∣ted, and enjoy the more perfect Friendship and Communion with it; for it is but rea∣sonable to suppose, that in this subtle mat∣ter, not only the Vehicles of Angelick Forms and Spirits, but also the sensible Ideas and Patterns of this lower World were origi∣nally drawn, and in this sense the Heavens, that is, the emanative subtle matter in which those Archetypal Ideas were framed, may be said to have declared the Glory of God, in another and an antecedent notion, to that in which the Psalmist understood those words, by representing the Original Patterns of the World, that was designed to be Created in the fulness of time, to the Human nature of Christ, and to those An∣gels and separated Spirits which were in time produced before the Foundations of
 the World, which taught them more fully and perfectly to understand and celebrate the Power and Wisdom of God, then with∣out such outward helps any finite or created Being was capable of doing, and this was no more then Seneca hath represented con∣cerning God himself, that he made use from all Eternity of a certain subtle matter, in which the first Patterns and Archetypal ex∣amples of all things whatsoever were drawn: Miremur, saith he in his 58th. E∣pistle,See Apol. for middle way A. p. 283 to 289 in sublimi volitantes rerum omnium formas, Deum{que} inter illa versantem ac pro∣videntem, quemadmodum quae immortalia sa∣cere non potuit, quia materia prohibibat, de∣fendat a morte ac ratione vitium corporis vin∣cat, in which passage, though it be mani∣fest that he supposed God to be one Supreme, Ʋbiquitary and Immaterial Nature, which is his genuine and true notion, and so must not be supposed in this particular, to ad∣here strictly to the Stoical Principles, which did not acknowledge any thing but mat∣ter in the world, and though that supreme ubiquitary and immaterial Nature, to help him to form and model his Ideas, may not perhaps have any need of any such subtle and subeternal matter (although it be some∣what difficult to conceive, how material
 Ideas can be represented or conveyed o∣therwise then by material objects, or by the help of the materia Ideata) yet with respect to the human nature of Christ, it was perhaps a matter of absolute necessity, that such a subtle matter should from all Eternity be created, wherein the first Patterns and Ex∣emplars of things should be drawn, to fill it with the more large and comprehensive notion of the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, which was a natural means of the most close and intimate Communion with him, and this is a second sense in which the Son may be said no have Created the World, because it was Created as it were on purpose for him, that part of it, I mean, which makes up the subtle matter of the Ʋniverse, which is infinitely the most considerable proportion of it.
But thirdly, the Son may be said to have Created the World in this sense also, not that the Power or Wisdom of the Human Nature could extend so far, as to the Creation of the World, but only that God the Father, that is, the original and radical divine substance did, as it were, take the advice and Council of the human nature in it, that is, he created such a World as should have a beauty & congruity in it, to the Human Nature, because that Na∣ture, which in its abstracted & separate Estate,
 is much the same with the Angelic, was to be the Principal Inhabitant of the Ʋniverse, and therefore, beauty or congruity being nothing else, but a certain satisfaction, com∣placency and delight, which a certain object strikes upon a certain nature; such a World was to be Created as was most naturally suited to please its best Inhabitant with its outward appearance, as well as to afford it matter of Contemplation; so, that as all the Creatures were at first brought to Adam to see what he would call them, and what∣soever he called them that was the Name thereof, so was the whole Creation presented to the Human Nature of Christ, as it were for his approbation, and to him perhaps it was especially to be applied, what we find written at the end of every days work in the History of the Creation, that God, that is, the human nature of Christ in conjunction with the divine, saw that it was good, that is, it had a goodness of congruity to the Human part, and I take upon me to affirm that no sense can be put upon this place, which gives so intelligible an account of the goodness mentioned in the Text, as this which I have mentioned seems to do, so also St. John tells us, That by him all things were made, and without him was not any thing
 made that was made; all things were made by him, in the sense already explained, be∣cause of the intimate union of the two Natures, by which it comes to pass that the effects and operations of the one, are alike attributed and ascribed to the other; and without him not any thing was made that was made, that is, without his consent, concur∣rence and approbation, to whom the World that was to be made, was to be so fitted, that it was to have in it a certain congruity and harmony with his Nature, and to strike a certain Sympathy and complacency upon it, and in this sense it is, that he is perhaps called by the Prophet Isaiah, the Coun∣cellor as well as the Mighty God, God ha∣ving in this great work of the Creation, consulted principally the happiness of his Creature Man, and ordered matters after such a manner as should be most suitable, most delightful, most congruous and most useful to the human nature.
But secondly, a second instance, in which the divine and human nature may be consi∣dered as acting as one commen Person, is the great affair of our Redemption; for the divine nature of it self was impassible, and the human of it self could not satisfie for the sins of the World, but the innocence of
 the human nature of Christ, which was, I take it for granted, owing to the intimate presence and union of it with the Divine; the exquisite and inconceiveable painfulness of that death which our blessed Lord suffer∣ed upon the Cross for our sakes, resulting in a great measure from the jarring and dis∣agreement of two natures so closely united, and accompanied all the while with a ve∣hement desire, to submit in the midst of as vehement an aversation to it, as hath been already declared; and lastly, the vital and inseparable Ʋnion of the Human and Divine life with one another; these were the things that did inhance the merit and value of that Sacrifice, and therefore in this case the Divine and Human Nature are considered as joyntly and equally con∣cerned.
Thirdly and lastly, in the business of the Intercession at the Right hand of God; God that is, the divine Nature cannot properly be said to intercede with himself, and yet the Intercession of the human without so close and vital a Connexion with the divine would be every whit as insignificant and unavailable, as without the same Ʋnion the Sacrifice of himself would have been, besides that it would perhaps be inexcusa∣ble,
 were it not for this Ʋnion, For one meer man, a finite and a little Creature, like our selves, to take upon him to sup∣plicate and intercede for all the rest, so that as his human Nature entitules him to the Priesthood; for the God and the Priest are supposed to be two things; so it is the Ʋ∣nion of that Nature with the divine, that makes him an High Priest, that Ʋnion is his entrance into the Holy of Holies, and inhan∣ces the price and value of his Intercession, and therefore in this third and last particu∣lar also, the divine and human Nature are considered as acting joyntly together, and constituting one Person, resulting from the Ʋnion of them both.
And now having laid down so clear a Notion of the blessed Trinity, I cannot see what is wanting to give it all the advantage which it very well deserves, for it is not only very consonant to Scripture, but it hath likewise so clear and so strong a Foun∣dation in the reason of things, that when both these meet, as they do here, together, it must be acknowledged to be more then a possible Idea, and that it is neither more nor less then the very truth it self, and a truth that seems to lie so plain, that it is much more wonderful it should be
 concealed thus long, then that at last it should be discovered.
As for the Scripture, what more plain then that those Texts, I am in the Father and the Fa∣ther in me, and I and the Father are one, may by this notion be very clearly explained, for the human nature of Christ is absorped and swallowed up in the Divine of God the Fa∣ther, and does on the other hand, by vertue of its intimate Ʋnion, imbibe and take in the Divine Nature into it self, as far as its ca∣pacity will reach, which it does much fur∣ther then by reason of its littleness and fi∣nite Circumscription it may seem to do, be∣cause the parts of the Divine Extension be∣ing all of them similar and actually inse∣parable, by reason that the whole is com∣mensurate to an infinite space, whatsoever is united by an unity of life and selfconsci∣ousness to any part, is at the same time ef∣fectually united to that indivisible life, which is but one and the same self-consciousness and self-enjoyment, through the whole extension. And so, I and the Father are one, that is, one in the common species of immaterial nature, one by mutual penetration and imbi∣bition, one by an unity of self-consciousness and reciprocal feeling of each others life, one by an unity of affection and will, and one in
 many cases, by an unity of operation and mutual concurrence to the same effect; neither is there any other possible difficulty to be started in this case, unless it be how two lives can be so twisted, and intimately in∣terwoven together, as to become one life, and to constitute one Person, to which it may be answered.
First, that in fact it is true, that an immate∣rial and material Nature may be so Ʋnited, as is plain in every human composition consist∣ing of Soul and Body, and that there is a great∣er congruity of one immaterial Nature to ano∣ther, then there can be of that which is cal∣led life and activity, to that which is utterly destitute and devoid of both, which is the case of matter, which yet by its union with an immaterial substance, is made to taste and feel it self, to become the subject and seat, either of pleasure or pain, and to concur with the other towards the constituting of a com∣mon Person, resulting from them both.
Secondly, upon supposition that one life is capable of being imprest and influenced by another, as there is more reason that it should, then that that, which is utterly de∣void of life should be capable of the same impressions, this is enough to constitute one common person; for by a person nothing
 else is meant but a self-conscious nature, and therefore, where there is in two personali∣ties a mutual enjoyment or feeling of each others life; there arises a compound persona∣lity from the mutual reciprocation, enjoy∣ment or imbibition of two several lives, act∣ing upon and influencing each other, and being brought to a perfect Harmony, and entire consent of understanding and will, and it is sufficient in this case, that the dif∣ficulties in the union of the two natures, to make up and constitute the second person in the Blessed Trinity, are not greater, no nor so great neither, as those in the union of our own soul and body, of which notwithstand∣ing we are intimately and perfectly consci∣ous to our selves.
Thirdly, there is no way to expound se∣veral places of Scripture, with any plausi∣bility or shew of truth, but by admitting such an union as this, which seems in those places to be so plainly asserted.
Fourthly and lastly, in the Sympathies of friendship, whether in joy or grief, and in the mutual complacency and satisfaction, which entire friends experience in the con∣versation and company of each other, in their common sentiments, common wishes and common designs, there is something very
 like this union which we contend for, though it be far from being so perfect and entire.
It being therefore so rational, to believe that there may be such a personal union of two immaterial natures together, to consti∣tute the Person of the Son, that other of these two natures or persons so united, to a certain, subtle, subeternal and aethereal mat∣ter, to constitute the third Person of the Blessed Trinity, which is called the Holy Ghost, must be admitted as a possible union, because the vital union of an immaterial na∣ture to a material, is no more then we do all of us every day experience in our selves, as hath been already observed.
The Father is the simple divine substance by himself, the Son is the vital Ʋnion of an human soul to the substance and Person of God the Father, and the Holy Ghost is no∣thing else but an Aethereal and Emanative matter, vitally united to both the former. That which makes them all to be God, is the same Numerical Divine substance be∣longing to them all, and that which makes the distinction of the Persons, is the ad∣dition of a Created immaterial nature, in the second Person of the Blessed Trinity, of a Created material one in the third, and the
 substraction or precision of both of these in the first.
The Son is said to be begotten of the Father, being a similar, immaterial, and as it were, univocal effect of his Power and Will, and the Holy Ghost to proceed from them both, because, though the human na∣ture of Christ and the subtle matter, which makes the body of that Person which is called the Holy Ghost, be both of them emanative and by consequence eternal, yet the emanation seems more natural from one immaterial nature to another, then from im∣material to material, and so the Son is at least prior natura then the Holy Ghost, though not cognitione, and the subtle matter which is one part of the third Person of the Blessed Trinity, being Crea∣ted, though from all Eternity, yet, in some sense, for the sake of the Son, as hath been already declared, and being also pro∣duced by the Father by a contemporary consent of will in the Son, or in the human nature, though they be supposed contempora∣ry to one another, yet this is enough to make it no improper way of expression, to say, that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Fa∣ther and the Son, though in this I do not justifie the heats on either side, between
 the Greek and Latin Churches, neither do I think the Schism to be the less inexcusa∣ble, because the Latins, in a matter of this subtlety, were in the right.
I do not deny but that the Father or the simple divine substance, is always vitally uni∣ted to the human nature of Christ, and also to a certain subtle and aethereal matter, in that manner which hath been already de∣clared; but yet notwithstanding the real distinction of the Father from the Son, or of the first Person of the Blessed Trinity from the second, is always as really and as clearly preserved, as if in the first case there were no second Person, or no vital union with the human nature, or as if in the se∣cond there were no third or no vital union of the divine and human nature, with the aethereal matter; for in the first place, as hath been already largely represented, there are some operations of the simple di∣vine substance, to which the human nature, being but finite, cannot adaequately extend, and in this case, that substance is of neces∣sity considered as a Person acting by it self, and in the second, notwithstanding the vi∣tal union of one or more immaterial nature to a material, yet there are some abstracted operations wherein the immaterial substances
 do perfectly withdraw themselves, from any intercourse or communication with matter, as is plain in those operations of the human soul, which are purely speculative and intelle∣ctual, in which the animal, concupiscibl or pla∣stick life have no share, but they are purely the operations of separated and abstracted Spirits, and such as would undoubtedly ac∣company the mind of Man, though it were disentangled from this mortal body, and yet, the vital union is not interrupted all this while, but the digestion and Animal secre∣tion still goes on, the bloud still circulates, and the Plastic faculties perform their office in men not yet arrived to their full growth, as well as in Embrios, not yet attained to their just form and shape in their Mothers Womb; not that I would be thought to compare these things with one another, but only in general to represent, that an im∣material nature, tho vitally united to a ma∣terial, may yet have operations purely spi∣ritual and altogether abstracted, in which that union is not at all concerned, and those operations which are performed on the one hand by the abstracted, and on the other by the Compound and Heterogeneous nature, may well enough be considered as the actions of two Jeveral and distinct persons, as in St.
 Paul's description of the strife and conten∣tion between the Flesh and Spirit, Rom. 7. 15. That which I do I allow not, for what I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I. Where it is manifest that the soul of man, considered by it self in its most inward and abstracted speculation, is considered as one person, and as united and vitally interwoven with a body or vehicle of matter, as another, and this is enough to show that a compound and a simple person are by no means the same, or to defend the personality of the Holy Ghost, as distinct from the simple substance of God the Father.
Further, that by the Holy Ghost, nothing else is meant but the vital union of an ae∣thereal or subtle matter, to the simple and original divine substance of God the Father, is clear not only from the words them∣selves, by which it is expressed in Hebrew Rouach and in Greek Pneuma, which signifie nothing else but a subtle matter, but also from the History of the Creation, where the spirit of God is said to have moved upon the face of the Waters, in the Hebrew it is Merachepheth, which the Rabbins inter∣pret of the incubation of any bird or fowl, up∣on the young or eggs, by which it is manifest that they understood the Spirit of God not simply,
 of any wind or subtle matter whatsoe∣ver, but of such as was animated with a divine life, and fitly disposed by brooding upon the Chaos to make it fruitful and fer∣tile, and when God spake to Moses out of the burning bush, when he gave the Law up∣on Mount Sinai in Fire and Smoak, when he went before the Camp of the Israe∣lites like a Cloud by day, and like a Flame by night, when such flaming and fie∣ry apparitions as these, are so frequently cal∣led in Scripture by the name of the glory of God, all these are meant of that subtle mat∣ter, which being animated and enlivened by a divine life, is called Rouach hachodesh, pneuma hagion, the Holy Spirit, the spirit, or breath, or wind of God; so also when Moses desired to see the face of God, but was denied for this reason, that no Man could see the face of God and live, but yet was permitted to see his back parts which were nothing else but a certain vigorous and piercing flame, the meaning is plainly this, that no Man in this life can converse with the naked essence or immaterial nature of God, but his back parts, or that aethereal and subtle matter, to which from all eternity he hath been vitally united, these may possi∣bly fall under human cognizance as they did
 under that of Moses, even in this life, and this in truth is the main, if not only business of this subtle matter, be∣sides the forming of Ideas in it, as hath been already suggested, that being ani∣mated and informed by the life of God, it is the instrument of the divine power in its external operations; thus as God being cloathed with this subtle matter, did incu∣bate and brood upon the Mass, and or∣der and dispose its several parts, as seem∣ed best to his infinite goodness and wis∣dom, so also those secret operations of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of good Men, are performed by virtue of this subtle matter, animated by a divine life, and directed by a divine council and wisdom, and mixing it self with the Spirits in our brains, giving them such motions and impressions, as are requisite to produce the ends intended; thus we find in the new Testament, that Jesus was driven by the Spirit into the Wilderness: that Philip was caught up by the same spirit and carried to Azotus, that it appeared upon our Saviour at his baptism, in the shape of a Dove, upon the Apostles in the day of Pen∣tecost, in that of cloven Tongues like as of Fire; we read also that those who were act∣ed by it, were transported and carried be∣yond
 themselves, almost to a degree of frenzy, so as they were scarce sensible of what they did or said, all which are clear instances of an extraordinary agitation of a certain subtle matter, and that this matter animated by a divine life, is that which is called the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghost, the third Person of the Blessed Trinity, and I am inclinable to believe, that the same Divine life warming and directing the sub∣tle matter of the Ʋniverse, is likewise the immediate instrument of Vegitation in Plants, and of all plastic operations in the animal world.
Thus have I given, I hope, a plain and clear account of the hitherto accounted un∣intelligible Doctrine of the blessed Trinity, so as to make it consonant to Reason and Scripture together, by which we shall at once gain a manifest advantage over the Arians and Socinians, whose only scruple against it, is its puzling and unintelligible Nature, and over the Papists, who fly for refuge to this Doctrine as their last Defence to vindicate the Doctrine of Transubstanti∣ation, and the truth is, to swallow the bu∣siness whole without chewing, as many too credulous people are used to do, as if three could be one or one three, without compo∣sition
 on the one hand, or without divi∣sion on the other, is a fancy every whit as absurd and indefensible as the Do∣ctrine of Transubstantiation it self, and as contradictory to experience and common sense. I have added as an Appendix at the end of these discourses, a large disquisiti∣on concerning the Divine Extension, which was but necessary to the better understan∣ding that notion of the Trinity, which I have laid down, and I think I have not only solidly confuted the most beloved Prin∣ciple of the Cartesian Philosophy, which would perswade us that nothing can be ex∣tended but matter, but also upon the same ground improved the destraction of the Divine Existence, beyond what any other Writer hath done before me; as for what concerns my usage of Dr. C. (who though he disclaimes it in one place of his System, and though he thanks God very solemnly in another, for taking such care to pre∣serve the notion of a Trinity wakeing in the World, yet after all he is either Arian, Socinian or Deist, if his book may be be∣lieved, and if he have not taken a great deal of pains to no purpose) all I shall say is, that I thought no severity too great to be used towards him, who hath made use
 of a great, however ill deserved reputa∣tion, to undermine the great Pillar and Cor∣ner Stone of the Christian Religion, and hath by consequence set at nought the Person and the Sacrifice of Christ, and done no small prejudice, by so doing to the Autho∣rity of his Gospel. I did design that this essay and what follows it, should be a mo∣nument of our Friendship, and my obligati∣on to succeeding times, and so I hope it will, but if I miss of my intention, it is in this case but Justice to accept the Will for the Deed.
