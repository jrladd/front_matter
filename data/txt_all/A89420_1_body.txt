My Love,
PErhaps the Wits may be as much of∣fended at men for writing to, as Walking with their owne Wives: neither is in fashion I confesse, but

sure they would exceedingly well-become our Age. In∣deed Gifts between Man and Wife, were prohibited by the Roman Legislator, yet hee intended not to destroy Kindness by a Law, but to declare Community in Marri∣age, where both have equall Proprieties, in that which either is possessed of. And even in reason (the ground of Law) he that makes a Present to his Wife, offers an Injury in a Complement: for he in∣titles her to that by his Gift,

which is hers in her owne Right.
I will not therefore so much transgresse, as to say, I give thee my English of Lean∣der's Epistle and Hero's an∣swer: for that were to imply, an expectation of receiving Thankes, for what was thy own as soone as mine. All that (by praefixing of thy Name) I pretend to, is first, to shew the World how sensible I am of thy Love, ex∣pressed to mee in both for∣tunes, the later being lively

represented in these Letters, that past betweene Husband and Wife divided by a Storme. In the next place, I shew thee, how I spent part of that time, when I had no∣thing left but (what Fortune could not take away) some houres for study, wherein I enjoyed my selfe as much, as I could, in thy absence. Last∣ly, I do an honour to my Au∣thour, for I dare boldly say, the strictest and most rigid Modesty will not scruple to read a passion writ by OVID,

where his name is placed so near to thine, which nothing unchast durst ever be so im∣pudent to approach. And if my Augury deceive me not, the Goodness of the Times is such, that the Lady I send to beare thee company, Hero, will be studyed by thy Sex in generall; her vertue drawn into Presi∣dent, and the greatest Mode∣sties discovered in the greatest Beauties; teaching the bold Pretenders to their favour, to court them, not in lewd unman∣ly Verse (the new-sickness of

the mind) but in Leander's primitive way of wooing, ti∣merous blushes, noble under∣takings, and gallant perform∣ances: but all of the vertuous ancient straine, such as this, wherein Ovid himself presu∣med not to use one lascivious syllable: and if the Muse of so incomparable a Wit, presumed not upon a looser Flight, when his subject was the faire dead Sestian: how dare our puny Aretines draw a wanton line, when they write of Hero's yet alive? I hope this Patterne

will ruin their Designe; to which good purpose, if my poore Endeavours may conduce, I must account them seasonably bestowed. Howsoever I shall not repent me, since they are crowned with so desired suc∣cesse, that they publish me, as I am,
