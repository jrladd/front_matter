My Lord,
SO great is the happiness that we already do enjoy under Your Highness Protecti∣on, that we have neither

hearts nor hopes, but what are armed with a Confi∣dence, that from the tem∣pests and the discords of VVar we shall gradually return to the harmony of the Arts, nor act any more VVars in our Fields, but content our¦selves with the reading of them in our Histories at home; being crowned with a Safety, as accom∣plished as Peace and Plenty, and as Piety

her self can make it.
Neither is this (My Lord) the Expectation onely of the three Na∣tions united in this Com∣mon-wealth, but of Fo∣raign States and Princes, who as much dread as gratulate your Greatness, to which the differing Counsels of the State, and the lowd necessities of the moving times, and no desires of your own did call you.

This is that (My Lord) which will yet raise you higher, and which will establish you in that height. He stands fast who is advanced, and up∣held by the hand of Providence, which even by the mightiest of your Enemies will be acknow∣ledged; who surprized as. much with envy as admi∣ration, shall finde the Pre∣sence and the Power of GOD in the wonder

of your Victories; And from the observation and the Course of your Acti∣ons, they may before∣hand pass a judgement on themselves, either of their Happiness or their Dangers.
In this History, your Highness may observe by what Arts Empires and Kingdoms have been Ere∣cted, and how justly they have suffered when the corruptions of Peace did

deliver them to the Exa∣mination of the Sword, to be either reformed or destroyed; You may ob∣serve how the VVorld hath been Inhabited by several Plantations, which though many of them may seem neer unto a Fable, yet doubtless there is something of Truth in them, as may appear by what is rehearsed of the Iews; whose Ancestry, and whose Religion being

precisely concealed from the observation of the Gentiles, it is to be won∣dred how Trogus Pompeius knew so much; and that Tacitus, who lived many years after him, and when the Iews had a Synagogue in Rome, should know so little, and in that little, should fall so short of the Truth.
My Lord, This Histo∣ry in the Original was dedicated to Antoninus Pi∣us,

an Emperor so admi∣rable for his Govern∣ment, that the striving gratulations of those of∣ficious times wherein he lived, when they could finde no parallel for him, they had recourse unto Antiquity, and compared him unto Numa. I have presumed (My Lord) to prefer the Transla∣tion of it to your High∣ness Protection, whose Courage, and whose

candor is beyond Exam∣ple, and whose Piety is greater then both. The Idolatry of the Romans decreed divine Honours to Antoninus, and imployed all their Eloquence to ex∣toll him, being dead. It shall be the Business of our zeal to wait upon your Lawrels, and with the eloquence of a bend∣ed knee to implore the Almighty to continue you long amongst us the Pro∣tector

of true Religion, and the Delight and De∣fender of the Arts; and that when by a late Death you shall be taken from us, our suffrages may be so happy as to find a Suc∣cessor like unto you: So prayeth
My Lord,
