Honoured Sir,
THat which embolden'd me to dedicate these our Labours to your Honour, was my knowledge, that this Subject would have some affinity to your Curious and Philosophical Mind, and al∣though the Work may be too weak to answer your excellent Parts, yet when we consider that our design is only to serve the Publick, we thought none so fit to Patronize and Encourage the same as your
self, seeing your learned Writings do manifest, that your whole de∣sign is for the same end, and in∣deed those many sublime Truths, that have passed from your Pen into the World, shew your great Qualifications, and have raised your Fame far beyond what we are able to set forth: For we can assure you, and that from experience, that 'tis spread like the Romish Eagle; for in our European Travels we have heard the same expressed from the mouth of the most learned Profes∣sors, calling you the Phoenix of the Age, seeing your Labours have been so profitable for Mankind; and for this reason we thought it not impertinent humbly to present this, the rough Draught of our Hard Labours unto your Correction and candid Censure, knowing there is
none a more competent Judge than your self; therefore if favour'd with your acceptance, we shall not value the Censures of those that wholly bend their Wits to search into the depth of other Mens Wri∣tings, with a design more to carp upon them, than any desire to be edified thereby; these are the Mis∣fortunes that we meet with in this pollished Age, we mean by such that are so scholastically adorned with the Theory of Science, yet ne∣ver design to be acquainted with the Practice thereof: but letting such pass, I shall address my self to your Honour; for that we have seen your Writings are Practical, and that you do endeavour to up∣hold the Mother of Science by the firm Pillars of Truth, and always have been found ready to pro∣mote
the Labours of such, who have had any good designs in la∣bouring for the Publick, which can in no measure be more evident than from your infallible Demonstrati∣ons; therefore, to apply it, the tendency of these our Labours is to stir up the noble English Spirits to promote her Manufactory, so that the English Growths may be exalted, and her Stores encrea∣sed, by adding thereunto good Vi∣nor Spirits, Oyls, Tinctures, Essen∣ces, Elixirs, and other excellent Spe∣cificks, as they may be prepared from what Nature so bountifully furnishes this Island withal, which indeed will produce what is reason∣ably sufficient for a true Operator in Physick; especially if he know the Virtues of our Sal Panaristos and Dalilah of Nature in the Fermen∣tative
Operations: to which a∣grees the learned Paracelsus in his Archidoxis, where he says, that 'tis a meer Dotage or Care∣lesness in a Physician, to neg∣lect being a perfect one in his own Nation. And we must make bold to tell your Honor, That there is no part of the habitable World that affords more of the Ʋniversal Matter than England, which, if exalted by a true Spa∣girick, would be very profitable to the sick, and conducive to their former sanity: we therefore heartily wish, that your Honor had not only the Knowledge, but full Possession thereof, that so you might not only live long, to pos∣sess all the Comforts and Bene∣fits of this Life, but also passing from hence, you might have a full
possession of Life Eternal, and to be crowned amongst the Re∣deemed of the Lord. This in all plainness is the sincere and hear∣ty Desires of him who subscribes himself your sincere Friend and Ser∣vant to command,
