May it please Your GRACE,
I Was far from making the same Estimate of this Discourse which
 was put upon it by the Generality of Your Grace's Souldiers, who heard it preach'd. But since Your Grace hath had the Charity to think it worthy Theirs and other Peoples Reading, I am resolved not to dis∣pute Your Grace's Great Judgment: and so, do most readily submit it to the Press; regardless of other mens Censures, whilst Your Grace is plea∣sed to look on it as a Dutiful and well-meant Performance.
Henceforward if any ask, What is in this Discourse that should move Your Grace to Order its being thus publick? I answer, It was design'd to promote Loyalty; the same Loy∣alty which now stands the Top and Comble of Your Grace's most Illu∣strious Titles and Characters, which render'd You all along a Great Fa∣vourite
 of our late deceased Sove∣reign, and makes You most Dear unto his present Majesty; which prevail'd with Your Grace in the very worst of Times to assert his Majestie's Interests in Contempt of all Your Own, in defiance of the Excluding Bill, and all the Trayte∣rous Votes and Designs of the As∣sociated Commoners who promoted it. In short, which brought Your Grace now down to Bristol, by Your Vigilance and Resolution to secure this City for his Majestie's Service, at a Time, when the Mock-King of Lyme had assured his Adherents, That this City was most certainly his own.
But Your Grace hath so effectu∣ally suceeded in Your Ʋndertaking, that the Daring Rebels had only so
 much Courage as to look upon the City at four Miles distance, and wish it theirs. The only Assault which they made upon Your Grace was a Volly of Lyes; (For having scarce laid it, they raised their Siege, with many bitter Cursings and Execrati∣ons of Your Wise Conduct, at Mid∣night cowardly running away.)
No wonder then that All honest and Loyal hearts within this City are now blessing God for Your Grace, and celebrating Your deserved Prai∣ses, as the only visible Means under Him, that hath secur'd to them their Estates, their Liberties, and their very Lives.
As for my self, the remembrance of my own Escape shall always live
 fresh in my mind, and I shall not fail to owne it to Your Grace upon all Occasions, as becometh,
