YOur Highnesse may please to remember how great an inte∣rest your Princely Mother, our late Gracious Queene, vouchsafed to challenge in my deceased Father: ac∣counting Him as one of Hers, as most truly (next the professed band of dutie to his dread Soueraigne, whose first-sworne Chaplaine he was, after his Maiesties happie arriuall in

these parts) by all the tyes a Royall Mistris might engage a Seruant, he was. Since that Starre was taken from our sight, I know not whether else ought Shee could call Hers might so immediately refer as to your selfe.
