May it Please Your Majesty.
I DO humbly present to Your MAJESTY a Summary of the Laws and Customes of Your ancient Kingdom of SCOTLAND, which can be no where so fitly Plac∣ed, as under the Rayes of Your Roy∣al Protection: I am confident it will tend to the Honour and Renoun of Your MAJESTY, and Your Princely Pro∣genitors, that You have Governed this Nation so long and so happily, by such just and convenient Laws, which are here offered to the view of the World, in a Plain, Rational, and Natural Method; In which, Material Justice (the common Law of the World) is in the first place orderly deduced from self evident Principles, thorow all the several private Rights thence arising: And in the next place, the Expedients of the most Polite Nation, for Ascertaining and Expeding the Rights and Inte∣rests of Mankind, are Applyed in their proper places; especially these which have been invented, or followed by this Nation; so that a great part of what is here offered, is common to most Civil Nations, and is not like to be dis∣pleasing to the Judicious and Sober any where, who dote not so much upon their own Customes, as to think that none else are worthy of their notice. There is not much here asserted upon meer Authority, or Imposed for no other Reason, but

quia majoribus placuerunt, but the Rational Motives inductive of the several Laws and Customes, are therewith held forth: And though the Application of those common Rules, to the varietie of Cases determined by our Statutes, our ancient Customes, and the more recent Decisions of our Supream Courts, be peculiar to us; Yet even the Quadrancy of these to the common Dictates of Reason and Justice, may make them the less displeasing; and that no Nation hath so few words of Art, but that almost all our Terms are near the Com∣mon and Vulgar Acceptation; Yea, the Historical Part relating the Helps and Expedients for Clearing and Securing the Rights of Men out of the Word of GOD; the Moral and Judicial Law contained therein; the Civil, Canon and Feudal Laws, and many Customes of the Neighbouring Nations Digested, as they fall in with the Common Rules of Justice, may probably be acceptable to these who may, and will allow time for their perusal, a quaint and gliding Stile, much less the Flourishes of Eloquence, the ordinary Condiment and Vernish, which qualifie the pains of Reading, could not justly be expected in a Treatise of Law, which of all Subjects doth require the most Plain and Accurate Expressions; to ballance which, the Nausiating burden of Citations, are as much as can be left out.
We do not pretend to be amongst the Great and Rich Kingdoms of the Earth, yet we know not who can claim preference in Antiquity and Integrity, being of one Blood and Lineage, without mixture of any other people, and have so continued above two thousand years; during all which, no forreign Power was ever able to setle the Dominion of a Strange Lord over us, or to make us forsake our Al∣legeance to Your MAJESTIEs Royal Ancestors, our Native and Kindlie Kings; Whereas, most of the other Kingdoms are Componds of Diverse Nations, and have been subjugated to Princes of different and opposite Families; and oftimes Forreigners. The great Monarchies which did design Universalitie, are all broken in pieces; and there is no Familie that can claim a just Title to Redinte∣grat any of them. There is no Emperor nor King, except Your Self, but knows to what other Families their Predecessors did Succeed, and when, and by what means It is evident what a mixture hath been in Greece and Italy, in France and Spain, in ENGLAND, and elsewhere. This Nation hath not been obscure and unknown to the World; but the most famous Nations have made use of our Arms, and have still in grateful remembrance, retained Trophies and Monuments of our Courage and

Constancy. There be few Wars in Christendome, wherein we have not had con∣siderable Bodies of Souldiers, Regimented and Commanded by themselves, and of∣times general Officers Commanding them; and whole Armies of Strangers, with great Reputation and Gallantry, which did advance them above the Natives of these Countreys where they served. Neither have we wanted the fame of Learning at home and abroad, in the most eminent Professions, Divine or Humane. And as every where the most Pregnant and Active Spirits, applie themselves to the Study and practice of Law; so these that applyed themselves to that Profession amongst us, have given great Evidence of sharp and piercing Spirits, with much readiness of Conception, and dexterity of Expression; which are necessary Qualifications both of the Bench and Bar, whereby the Law of this Kingdom hath attained to so great Perfection, that it may without Arrogance be compared with the Laws of any of our neighbouring Nations, for we are happy in having so few and so clear Statutes. Our Law is most part Consuetudinary, whereby, what is found inconvenient is Ob∣literat and forgot: Our Forms are plain and Prompt, whereby the generality of the Judicious, have with little pains much insight in our Law, and do with the more Security enjoy their Rights and Possessions, which by our publick Records are bet∣ter known then any where, by which, we may with the greatest assurance Trust our Purchase, seing no Land-Right is effectual against Purchasers by Consent or by Law, but where the ultimate perfection thereof, by Seasing or other Evident, is up∣on Record in Registers, set apart for the several Rights, without mixture of any other, whereof there are Authentick Minute-books keeped, with the Records in each Shire and Jurisdiction, whereby with the least pains or expence, all the Rights affecting any Land within the course of Prescription, can easily be found. We are not In∣volved in the Labyrinth of many and large Statutes, whereof the posterior do ordi∣narly Abrogate, or Derogate from the prior, that it requires a great part of a life to be prompt in all these Windings, without which, no man with sincerity and con∣fidence, can Consult or Plead; much less can the Subjects by their own Industrie, know where to rest, but must give more implicite Faith to their Judges and Lawers, then they need or ought to give to their Divines; and we do always prefer the Sense to the subtility of Law, and do seldom trip by niecities or formalities. The greatest Fixation and Improvement of our Law hath been by the Establishment of the Supream Civil Judicature of the Kingdom, by King JAMES the fifth, in the Institution of the Colledge of Justice, consisting of fifteen ordinarie Senators, in place of the Kings daily Council, which followed His Residence and Court, and of the Lords of Session, who came in their place, and were nominated of the Estates of Parliament Ambulato∣ry;

and the Senators of the Colledge of Justice were Invested with the powers of both, and their persons and the place of Judicature became fixed, and hath so continued near the space of an hundred and fifty Years. This Court was much improven by Your MA∣JESTIEs Royal Grand-Father, who delighted exceedingly in it, and honouredit frequently with His Presence while He was in Scotland: So did Your Royal Father when He came to Scotland to be Crowned: And Your MAJESTY hath owned and encouraged it more then any.
Your MAJESTY doth not demand or expect great Revenues from this Kingdom; that which we can be useful in to Your MAJESTY, is our personal Service, and our firm adherence to Your Crown and Monarchy, and to Your Royal Family, in which we have a peculiar Interest; and which no time can communicate to any of Your other Dominions, which they neither can claim, nor should invy that You are of our Nati∣on, and hath Governed us during twenty Centuries and more, and by us You are the most Ancient King in the World, which is the most Noble and Resplendent Jewel in Your Crown; What Family on Earth can parallel that Motto, which an hundred Years ago, was Written about Your Royal Ensignes, upon Your Palace,
— Nobis haec invicta miserunt
Centum sex proavi.
Therefore Your Royal Family hath been betroathed to a Virgin Crown, which ne∣ver knew another Husband; and though it hath been darkened with Clouds and Recesses, yet never was, and I hope never shall be in Widuity. The mutual Affe∣ction betwixt Your MAJESTIES Royal Family and this Nation, is a prime Inte∣rest to both, which should be much incouraged and improven: Your MAJESTY without just ground of Jealousie to Your other Kingdoms, may own a peculiar Care of us; and weought to  a singular kindness to, and confidence in Your MAJESTY, and Your Royal Successors; This might he so promoved, that Your MAJESTY might by Treaties, have Armies of this Nation abroad, Intertained without Your Charge, and ready at Your Call, as You had Dowglas Regiment in France, which might secure Your Peace at Home, and make You stand in need of less Aids from Your People. You might also have thriving Plantations abroad, if these who every year go from this Nation, to seek their Fortunes abroad, were directed and encouraged; And it is certainly a great Interest to keep the Nation at Home, in constant Affection
