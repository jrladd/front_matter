Dread Soveraigne,
AMongst the many excellent Vertues which have made your Maties Per∣son so deare to God, and so precious in the eyes of all your good People, the most eminent is your Piety; which

gloriously shines in the in∣nocency of your Life, in the constancy of your Devoti∣ons, in the justice and milde∣nesse of Your blessed Go∣vernment, and especially in your tender cares & thoughts for the conservation of true Religion, and of the Peace of the Church, in this crazy & quarelling Age. This Piety in your Maty gives me the bold∣nesse, humbly to lay at your Foote this unworthy Piece; and the boldnesse also to hope, that your Maty will graciously accept it. Both because it was undertaken in

obedience to your Maties particular Commandement: and because in it I plead (as well as my Weakenesses will permit,) for the Faith and Charity of our Church, a∣gainst the Faction of Rome, who very falsely pretending to Truth and Vnitie, are in∣deed the true Authors and Continuers of the miserable Schismes of Christendome. If here in I have done any ac∣ceptable service to God and his Church, and to your Maty, I have my desire. The Father of Mercies crowne Your Maty with all the com∣forts

and Benedictions of Heaven and Earth; and con∣tinue long the happines of these Your Fortunate Is∣lands, in the holinesse and health of their Gratious So∣veraigne.
