SIR,
THese following papers have long been design'd to kiss your hand, where (if they now find accep∣tance) I shal conceive them the better able to weather those stormes which they may expect to meet withall abroad; You are not ignorant, how the injurious malice of some men, (which though divers years are past, hath not sufficiently eva∣porated its malignity) hath subjected the Author to an hard, and yet honorable
suffering; his innocence may perhaps be the more conspicuous to cādid judgments, when these his meditations shal appear under the shelter of your honored Name: and (his opposers) may be lesse forward to blast his memory: It was his intention to have pre∣sented it with his own hand, but death pre∣vented it, and providence hath cast this as a necessary duty upon me; all his ambi∣tion was to acknowledge to the world his many deep obligements, hoping this might remain as an undoubted testimony; that his earnest desires to honor and serve you could not expire but with his breath: and mine shall be no other then to have the honor to be esteemed
Sir

Sep. 27. 1654.
