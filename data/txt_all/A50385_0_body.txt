My Lord,
I Did heretofore acquaint your Lordship, with my intention to write my thoughts and Ex∣perience, both of the Causes and Cure of the Stone in Humane Bo∣dies: And that I did design to De∣dicate that Book to your Lordship, as the most proper Altar at which to offer whatever I should produce on that subject; you having been not only the most Illustrious Patient I have had in that Disease, but

also the most Generous too: For when some years since I was so happy to serve your Lordship not insuccessfully, upon that occasion, in the recovery of your health, your Lordship was pleased to take the opportunity (in a most Glorious Assembly) to give so obliging a Character, both of my Skill, and Care in my Profession, that had I not many former inducements, yet this alone were sufficient to chal∣lenge (as a due debt to your Lord∣ship) not only my Labours upon that subject, but the Services of my whole life.
Some part of that Treatise of the Stone, I writ some years since, and have yet lying by me; having had no conveniency to compleat the same, by reason of the removal of

my Habitation, and the constant Trouble the prosecution of my Right to a considerable Estate, hath ingaged me in: For I find that a work of the nature of that Treatise, will allow of fewer Avocations, and requires a more easie posture of affairs, than I at present enjoy. Therefore be pleased, till I can make you that Present, to accept of this Book of Medicinal Councels; which I shall not need to recommend to your Lordship, since the worth of their Author, Sir Theodor Mayerne, is sufficiently known to you. I put them into English for the publick good: But I present them to your Lordship, not that you need Tran∣slations, (for your great Learn∣ing, and knowledge in most Lan∣guages, as well as your excellent

Wisdom, hath been amply mani∣fested to the world) but that I might take the opportunity of ma∣king a publick acknowledgement of your favours to me, and attest how much I am bound to be, what I subscribe my self,

From my Lodgings next door to the steps going into the Black-friers, by the side of Fleet River, near Fleet-Bridge.
