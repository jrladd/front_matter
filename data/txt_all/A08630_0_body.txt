RJGHT NO∣ble, indebted to your Honor for a number of vndeserued friend¦ships, and vnable altogither to re∣quite the least of a thousande cour∣tesies: sought the meanes howe to acquite mee of some parte thereof. But waying mine owne defaulte, and considering your Honors me∣rits, wox almost in vtter dispaire: vntill at length it repairde to my thought, that it was no greater to∣ken of Honor, liberallye to bestowe vpon other great rewardes, than a proofe of Nobilitie gratefullye to accept at others hāds slender gifts according to their hability that of∣fred the same. Artaxerxes his good acceptaunce of a handefull of run∣ning water, bred me to this bold∣nesse to offer your Honor a handful of written Papers: hoping that as be thought no disdain of the one, so you wil not take scorne of the other. Let me craue this one thing at your Honors handes, that the basenesse of this my translatiō of the learned Poet Ouid, procure not you to re∣fuse the Patronage and defence of my slender Muse. Which as J know vndoubtedly shal neuer coū∣teruaile your courtesies: So doe J assuredlye hope may be a proofe of my good will & not forgottē dutie. The very name, Heroycal (for so are the Epistles termed) deserued an Honorable & Heroycall Per∣sonage to be their garde. Which if your honor refuse not (as I know you wyll not refuse) waying the giuers intent, and seeing that these are the first fruites of his trauaile) you shal not onely purchase immor∣tall praise of others: but I be encou∣raged and animated to greater and grauer attempts: which I shall no sooner atchiue, but you shall be a witnesse of my endeuours, & arā∣pier to my exploytes. Thus hauing boldly importuned your assistance, and tediously molested your eares with circumstances, leauing now at length to abuse your friendly paci∣ence, J ende: wishing to your Ho∣nor increase of Nobilitie, with a moste happie lyfe: and after the
Catastrophe of this worldly Come∣die, (wherein you play a state∣lye parte) the gladsome ioyes of the euerlasting Seignorie.
