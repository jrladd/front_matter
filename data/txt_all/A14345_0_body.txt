Right Worshipfull▪
THAT my Inten∣tion was devoted to your Worships, ap∣peares

by this Presentati∣on, and that my Inten∣tion hath rightly dire∣cted my Presentation, will easily bee seene; for where could these faith∣full Witnesses that are dead, have had fairer hopes of Tuition, than by you who are living Wit∣nesses of the same Truth most of them have con∣stantly suffered for: some of them were Exoticke, some Natives, all of the

same Faith: GODS Word commends the protection of the for∣mer; Grace and Na∣ture both pleade for the other: Some of them that were Stran∣gers, had faire protecti∣on and good provision in this Kingdome, and were publickly grac'd & allowed in the famous Schooles of our Vniver∣sities; and some of ours, upon the change of Re∣ligion,

found presently a Reciprocall requitall in their chiefest Hans towns: Both one and the other were worthy Agents in the Church of GOD; and their Workes (the never dying Monuments of their Fame) will praise them in the Gates; they were so eminent Lights, that my Encomium will rather séeme to lessen than augment their lustre; however, I have striven

(as much as I could) to re∣vive their Memories from the grave of Oblivion.
And (Right Wor∣shipful) if you but receive as much comfort by Rea∣ding of their Workes, as I have done by the Editi∣on, I am fully perswaded, your Worships will rest satisfied, and I shall not be taxt for presumption: Disdaine not therefore, I pray you, to Patronize those, whom I doe be∣leeve

ere this, GOD, the Father of the Faithfull, hath registred for his own Sonnes in the Booke of Life.
I neede not blazon your Worthy and Religi∣ous actions to the World, when as both Church and State adorned, and great∣ly beautisied by them, doth, and will, for ever e∣ternize your Pietie and Vertues to succeeding po∣sterity. I onely wish the

rich men of this age, ei∣ther to imitate your do∣ings, or be ashamed that they follow not such E∣minent examples: Goe on still I exhort you, and in due time you shall reape the recompence of reward.
Your Worships that so much love GODS Temple, I hope, will vouchsafe to receive and entertaine these famous men, who have been the

Lords Embassadors in his Church here, and are in the Celestial Temple with him in Glory: So wishing all your Worships the like happinesse with his Saints, when you shal be dissolved: and praying for your prosperity on earth, with length of dayes; I referre my selfe, and all my endeavours to Him and your worthy selves, being,
Your Worships in all Chri∣stian Offices,
Donald Lupton▪
