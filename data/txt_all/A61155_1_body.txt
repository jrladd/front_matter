NOBLE SIR,
SVpposing you may take the Book called the Vindication by Master Prynne into your hand, I desire that this Discourse may be in your other hand, as occasion serves. If the Lord hath revealed any thing in this Discourse, to enlighten the darknesse of this present Controversie, it is onely from him who is the Father of Lights, who carries on his to a more excellent way, till we may with open face, behold the Glory of Jesus Christ, and be changed from glory to glory.
Sir, The thing I only contend for, is, that which the Gospel and Spirit cals for; Whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are of good report.
Sir, The ingagement of private respects which are upon me towâˆ£ards you; and being likewise a partaker of some labours of yours in the Lord, which are abroad, as that of Promises, &c. The best treasure we have in this life, hath drawne this from me.
The Lord who hath wounded you, binde you up, and lead you on to the glorious Truths; for, if I mistake not, our Controversie is but this in these times; some would walke more close with Christ, some can be content like Peter to walke at more distance, and follow him afar off, and to stand warming themselves with the multitude in the Common-Hall: And let the Word judge betwixt us, which is of best report.
Sir,
