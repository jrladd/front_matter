Sir,
THere are many reasons wherefore I should dedicate this Tragedy to your selfe: and let great Tomaso, fall at no other feet then yours: The one is, I attained to the observation of all the particulars at your charge; and reason it is, that I should tender to none other but your self, the fruites which grew upon the fien that was grafted upon your stocke. So that my writings, and Tomasoes fall, are both tributes which belong to Caesar. The most famous Poets that ever had a being,
 were never so wel pleased with their grea∣test Patrons, as I am with mine: they who had the best, had onely Caesars, to be Judges of their Poems excellence: but I have Caesar not onely to be my Judge, but a witnesse also of the truth of what I write: nor can I fear the censure of any inferiors, after that I have made my appeale to Cae∣sar. Sir, there is another reason which is occasioned by the remembrance of an I∣talian Proverbe.
Respetto son le ballie di charetza, Respect is the nurser of friendship. Sir, wee have been Comrades together through divers Countries, we have been joynt-purchasers of many favours, and honours; and fellow-sufferers of as many miseries: wee have waded hand in hand together, through the greatest dangers, and (guided onely by ne∣cessity) fording through deepe and run∣ning rivers of calamities we were carried down the stream into an ocean of perplex∣ities, out of which we were at last cast up∣on an Island, which upon our arrivall wee soon found to be our own. Such Passages
 as these, as they could not be otherwise then mutual obligations to one another of the highest nature, so they could be no lesse then the highest motives to the grea∣test love. Now to foster up this issue of travaile, to a full proportion of respect, whereby this friendship should be main∣tained, I thought good to preserve it from such an oblivion, as these thin paper walls will give me leave, and to Dedicate both my selfe and it to be always ready at your commands, who am,
