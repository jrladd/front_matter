I Shall not beg your
pardon for publi∣shing
this Book; for
as 'tis none of mine
(being written by a famous
and learned Divine) so I doe
not set it forth relying on my
own judgement, but had the o∣pinions
nd approbation of di∣vers
persons of known abilities,
who knew best what is most
usefull for publique Benefit.
And I may (without breach of
Modesty) affirm, that there is
not in our Language any Booke

of so small a bulke, containes
so much of the Doctrine of the
Meteors. We daily behold and
view divers Meteors, but ve∣ry
few are skill'd in their Cau∣ses;
but those that are not, may
be informed. And I must tell you
also, that this Book on perusall
hath been found so advantagi∣ous,
that a person of quality hath
lately taken paines to make di∣vers
worthy Observations up∣on
it, which here I have sub∣joyned,
because you should not
pay for two Books instead of
one. These Observations were
never published till now, and I
trust thou wilt find the Author
did thee a Courtesie. Farewel.
