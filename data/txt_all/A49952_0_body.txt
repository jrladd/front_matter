My Lord,
POets for the most part in their Dedications miss of their de∣sign, which should be to please that Honourable Person, whose protection they desire. For what pleasure can a Noble Spirit (whose Ingenuity equals its height) receive an exorbitant Praise and ill tim'd Applause? Not that the severest Cynick should snarl at just Commendations and due En∣comiums;

such was the Epistle of Ho∣race to Augustus Plinie's Panegyrick to Trajan, which sort of ponder'd Elo∣quence ought to be as Grateful to a brave and elevated Mind as Adorations to the Deity. My Business waving Insinua∣tion is to pray, not to praise; and I hope I shall appear less troublesome to your Lordship under the form of a Begger, than that of a Flatterer. Your protection & favour is implor'd by this Humble Suppli∣cant in the behalf of a Civil Tyrant, at least one whom I have so represented, and for which I have been sufficiently censur'd perhaps unjustly enough; since 'tis not impossible for a man to love and hate, to be brave and bad. From the Criticks, whose fury I dread those Killmen and more then Jews; I appeal to your Lord∣ship as the Saint did to Caesar. To you whose Iudgment vies remark with your Grandeiur, who are as absolutely Lord

of Wit as those prevaricators are its slaves. To you who by excellent Read∣ing and Conversation with the pleasantly wise, have justly limited the mighty Sal∣lies of an overflowing Fancy. whose say∣ings astonish the Censorious, and whose Writings are so exactly ingenious; Princes treasure them in their Memory, as things Divine. This is so far from flattery or untruth, that it appears rather an imper∣tinent kind of asserting what every Man knows, as if I should gravely tell the World 'tis day at noon; which I had ra∣ther another should be smil'd at for, than he who is in highest Truth and lowest Hu∣mility. My Lord,
