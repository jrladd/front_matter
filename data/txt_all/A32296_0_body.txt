Worthy Sir,
BEing put in mind of that saying of Sene∣ca, Ingratum si∣dixeris Omnia dixeris. And having a desire to avoid that Rock whereupon so many have suffered Shipwrack, have had often conflicts

within my self, wherein I might express my thankful∣ness unto you, of whom I a Stranger have received so many undeserved favours, and at last bethought my self, that (you being one of the Noble Governours of this famous City of London, and being likewise a Presi∣dent over several Companies of Merchants in it) a Trea∣tise concerning the Customs of the City of London, or o∣therwise concerning the Priviledges and Immunities granted unto the Merchants of London, would not altoge∣ther be an unfitting subject to be presented unto your

view; whereupon I have se∣lected som few Cases col∣lected by my self, of the re∣solution of the Iudges, con∣cerning some Customes of your City, and some Char∣ters granted unto the Citi∣zens of it, and offered them unto your consideration, the which I desire you to ac∣cept as a pledge and token of a thankful mind, howsoever they in themselves are un∣worthy your pains to be ta∣ken in the reading of them: and so with my truest wishes of the continuance of all happiness unto your self, your thrice Noble La∣dy, and the branches of

your flourishing Family, I take my leave, ever rest∣ing,
From my Chamber in the middle Tem∣ple, 2 Januarii Anno Dom. 1661.
