My good Lord,
I Can not tell how your Lord∣ship may take it, that in so uncourted a language, as that of PORTUGALL, should be found extant a Poet to ri∣val your beloved TASSO, How himself took it, I can; for he was heard to say (his great JERUSALEM be∣ing then an Embrio) HE FEARED NO MAN BUT CAMOENS: Notwithstanding which, he bestow'd a Sonet in his praise. But, admitting the TUSCAN SU. periour; yet, as He (with ome anger) of GUARINI, when he saw, by the unquestionable Verdict of all ITA∣LY, so famous a LAUREATE as himself by that man's PASTOR FIDO outstript in the Dramatick way of Po∣try; SE NON HAVUTO VISTO IL MIO AMIN∣TA—(because indeed the younger, for a Lift in this kind, was beholding to the Elder): So, and for the same

cause, might my PORTINGALL have retorted upon Him with reference to his own Epick way; IF HE HAD NOT SEEN MY LUSIAD, HE HAD NOT EX∣CELL'D IT.
Since then I find, HORACE, in the days of old, held himself accountable to his potent friend LOLLIO for the profits of those vacant hours, which he past in his pro∣per Villa, whilst LOLLIO lay Ledger in ROME about that which was the great Domestick glory of the ROMAN NOBILITIE of those Times;

Trojani belli Scriptorem, maxime Lolli,Hor. lib. 3. Epist. 2.
Dum Tu declamas Romae, Praeneste relegi:


Whilst thou (Great LOLLIO) in ROME dost plead,
I, in PRAENESTE, have all HOMER Read:

How much more obliged am I to bring unto your Lord∣ship this TREASURE-TROVE, which (as to the se∣cond life, or rather Being, it hath from me in the English-Tongue) is so truly a Native of YORKSHIRE, and hold∣ing of your Lordship, that, from the hour I began it, to the end thereof, I slept not once out of these Walls?
And, if the same HORACE proceed;

Qui, quid sit pulhrum, quid Turpe, quid utile, quid non,
Plenius ac melius Chrysippo & Crantore, dicit:


Who, what is Right, what not, what brave, what base,
Clearer and better then the STOICKS, says:)

Whether this Poet also (however dis-figur'd in the trans∣lating, yet still reteining the old materials, both Politicall and Moral, on a truer and more Modern Frame of Story and Geography then that of HOMER

—Et, quamvis plebeio tectus Amictu,
Indocilis privata loqui)

shall not be valuable upon the like account, I appeal to your Lordship, whose devoted (since he turn'd English∣man) he is, by the title I have already mentioned, and by as many more, as I am
From your Lordships Park of Tankersley May 1. 1655. MY LORD,
