RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL,
IT is not out of any satietie, that I change from the old Testament to the new; These two, as they are the Brests of the Church, so thy yeeld Milke equally wholsome, e∣qually pleasant vnto able Nurselings. Herein J thought good to haue respect vnto my Reader, in whose strength there may be difference. That other Brest per∣haps, doth not let downe this nourishing liquour, so freely, so easily: Euen so small a variety freseth a weake Infant; Neither will there perhaps want some paltes▪ which wil finde a more quick & pleasing relish in this fresher sustenāce▪ these I thought good to please with a taste, ere they come to sate themselues with a full Meale of this diuine nourishment; in emulation of the good Scribe, that
 brings forth both olde and new. If it please God to inable my life and opportunities, I hope at last, to present his Church, with the last seruice of the Historie of either Page: wherein my Joy, and my Crowne shall bee the edification of many. Jn the meane time, I dedicate this part vnto your Name, whom J haue so much cause to obserue, and honour. The blessing of that God (whose Church you haue euer made your chiefe Client) bee still vpon your head, and that honorable Societie which reioyces in so worthy a Leader. To it, and your selfe, J shall be euer (as I haue cause) humbly and vn∣fainedly deuoted
