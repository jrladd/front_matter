GREAT SIR,
IT is noted by the Lord Bacon in the
Life of the Wise and Victorious
Prince, King Henry the Seventh, That
it was his Custom to be First or Second in
all his Warlike Exploits; and that it was
his Saying, when he heard of Rebels, That
he desir'd but to see them. What Your Ma∣jesty
has lately published to the Two Hou∣ses
of Parliament, is of the same Spirit and
Policy. But This is not the only Parallel
between Your Majesty and that Great
King; for He also came from Abroad, yet

with this Distinction, that His Coming was
only to assert his Particular Claim; where∣as
the Coming of Your Majesty was of
Ʋniversal Concern, it being to free us all,
who were at the Brink of Idolatry and
Bondage.
To whom then (GREAT SIR) should
I Dedicate this Second Part of the History
of Ireland, but to Your Majesty, who now
Dedicates Your Self to the Redemption of
Ireland; and being thus far in Possession of
the Subject, I am already preparing to Re∣cord
all Your Majesty's Glorious Atchieve∣ments,
and am in certain expectation of a
greater Theme, than ever that Kingdom
could hitherto boast.
'Tis true, Your Majesty hath herein the
Power of Two Kings to Oppose; but 'tis
no ill Symptom, that by what you have al∣ready
done, the One of them has been con∣strained
to send his Plate, and the Other his
Cannon to the Mint. Nor ought we to think
better of Irish Armies or Irish Courage, than
is thought by those who judge Both well
paid for, when but rewarded with Copper.
'Tis certain, The Bulk of that Nation
are already surfeited with the Stratagem of

that Imaginary Coin; they feel the Fruits
of contending for a French Interest, by the
Slaughter, Sickness, and Defolation of the
Year past; so that 'tis possible Humane
Nature may at length be too hard for the
Priest and the Politician too, and that when
by Your Majesty's Presence they behold
their Ruin at hand, they may give more
Exercise to Your Mercy than to Your
Sword.
It was truly observed by Your Majesty,
in Your late Gracious Speech, That in the
speedy Recovery of Ireland the Place and Honor
of England did consist, and that hereby alone
Taxes could cease; So that as Your Ma∣jesty
is now willing to expose Your Person
for those Great Ends, 'tis not to be feared,
but the Nation will second Your Majesty
with such Royal Supplies, as may make it
a short and not a lingring Work; for not
only in This, but in many other high Re∣gards,
'tis Expedition alone that can answer
the Anxieties which England must be in
for Your Majesty's Absence: And seeing
Your Majesty will leave behind that Great
Pledge, Your Royal Consort and our most
Gracious Queen, Your Majesty will not
want Your own Anxieties also for a speedy
Return.

But that it may be with such Laurels, as
may bring Terror to France, with Triumph
to Your own Kingdoms, and a happy Re∣stitution
of Your poor Protestant Subjects
of Ireland to their Native Homes, is the
most fervent Prayer of,
GREAT SIR,
