Dear Sir,
HEre you have by the Press returned to you those Sermons of yours, which you some Years ago prepared for the Publick. Such were the Hazards and
 Deaths which they were in, that I believe their thus coming forth was lately altogether unexpected by you, and is now a great Surprizal to you. For surely you had no reason but to give them up as for ever lost in this World, (as I have in brief given an account in an Epistle to the Reader prefixed) however you might relieve your self with this Faith, that your good Will and Labour therein was with the Lord.
 Possibly that sentence of Death which they were un∣der might be some discou∣ragement to you, and oc∣casion some sad Thoughts. He who then helped you to receive it with a Gra∣cious Submission to him, without whom not a Spar∣row lights on the ground, and who numbers the very Hairs of our Heads, and hath a Soveraign Right (which may neither be con∣trolled nor questioned) to dispose of us, and all ours,
 as pleaseth Him, now lets you see it was not in vain to commit them unto Him. Whatever the Workings of your Heart were under that disappointment, I am perswaded you will now receive them as a return unto, and a token of the acceptance of those Prayers which you followed them withal when you first took up a purpose to Publish them, and did accordingly commit them unto Him who hath so Faithfully,
 so Marvellously preserved them, and hath now at last, through so many Deaths, brought them forth unto Light. Now God, who is able to make all Grace abound towards you, and doth minister Seed to the Sower, and preserve it when perishing, increase his Gifts and Grace in you, and multiply your Seed sown and the Fruits there∣of, to your Comfort, the Good of many, and the
 Glory of his own Grace. So prayeth,
(Dear Cozen)

London, Dec. 15. 1693.
