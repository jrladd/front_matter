May it please your Ladiship,
MAdam, Imbolden'd by your ac∣customed candor and unmerited favours to things of the like nature, though disproportion'd worth: (Because this Excellency seems to contract those perfecti∣ons her Sex hath been invested with, which are as essential to your Ladiship, as light to the Sun) I presumed to secure this innocent Orphan from the Thunder-shocks of the present blasting age, under the safe protecting wreath of your name; which (I am confident) the vertues of none can more justly challenge, then those of your Ladi∣ship; who alone may seem to quicken the lifeless Scene, and to demonstrate its possibility; reducing Fables into Practicks; by making as great honour

visible in the mirror of your dayly practise. Your pardon, Madam, for daring to offer such adulte∣rate Metals, to so pure a Mine; for making the Shadow a present to the Substance; the thoughts of which was an offence, but the performance, a crime beyond the hopes of pardon. When my Fate   me on the first, I esteemed my self saso (with the Politian) should I not attempt the latter, securing one error by soring at a greater: but my duller eyes endured not the proof of so glorious a Test, and the waxed jun∣ctune of my ill contrived feathers melt me into the fear of a fll: Therefore (with the most despe∣rate offenders) I cast my self on the mercy of the Bench; and since I have so clement a Judge as your self, do not wholly despair of absolution, by reason my Penetential acknowledgment attones part of the offence; and your remission of the whole will eternally oblige,
MADAM, The humblest of your Ladiships Servants,
