Right Honourable,
AS there are no Sea-Officers, to whom Gratitude is more due, than Knowing and Careful Pilots; so is there no Mini∣ster, either in Kingdom or Common∣wealth,
to whom the People owe grea∣ter Obligations. Duty, and Respect, than to a Wise, and Well-deserving Secretary of State; as being one who constantly standeth at the Helm of Pub∣lick Affairs, to Weather the Common Interest, against all the Storms, and Tempests, of Seditious, Vain-glorious, and Aspiring Opposers. For this Cause, I have thrown in the Mite of my Humble Respects, in the Trea∣sury of your publick Deservings, as a Token, and Acknowledgment, of the vast Sum of Service and Respects, the Kingdom is indebted to your Lord∣ship's Prudence, Care, and Candor; that if, like the Ʋnthankful Lepers, most should prove forgetful of your Lordship's Favours, some, at least,
may Acknowledg the Debt, tho' all be not able to pay the Interest. I Hum∣bly present your Lordship with this small Treatise; Written Originally in Latine, and am sorry it is of no grea∣ter Extract than a Translation: How∣ever, Non defero Noctuam Athe∣nas, nor profer it as a Supplement to the full Orb of your Lordship's Qua∣lifications; for the Sun never borrow∣ed a Ray from any Inferiour Planet, tho, on Rational Grounds, this small Treatise, or little wandring Meteor, beggeth a Beam of your Lordship's Fa∣vour, that, with Confidence, it may appear in the open World. Thus, may it be said, in this Case, as Ovid, in such another.
At{que} Ajax Armis, non Ajaci Arma petuntur.
So this small Treatise, and Foreign Politician, humbly beggeth the Honour of your Lordship's Patronage and Pro∣tection: which, if granted, will effe∣ctually Legittimate all the Mistakes, and Oversights, which might have been committed by a German States-Man. Thus, humbly begging your Lordship's Acceptance, I make bold to Subscribe my Self,

August 27. 1690.
