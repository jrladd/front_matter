Right Honourable,
IT was not upon
long Considera∣tions,
but easie re∣solutions,
that I pitch∣ed
upon your Lord∣ship,
and determined to
presume upon your pa∣tronage

of this small re∣view
of the actions of
his SACRED MA∣JESTY,)
whose hard
fortunes may now de∣mand
a Subjects prote∣ction)
since I could no
where else find a person
who bears so great a
ame of true honour &
Generosity, nor one
whose assured loyalty
will make him lesse a∣shamed
or afraid to
own his Prince.
And indeed (my

Lord) when I looked
upon these Nations,
once I may say almost
peopled with Nobles,
and now in a great mea∣sure
deprived both of
her nobility and gentry,
'twas easie for me to find
out the Prime of those
remaining, which a
small search told me
was your Lordship;
who, though you have
been no whit behind
the foremost in Loyal∣ty,
yet God hath been

pleased to make others
drink deeper in the Cup
of affliction then your
self.
But all those miseries
which either your Lord∣ship
or other loyal per∣sons
have suffered, can∣not
come in competi∣tion
with those under∣gone
by his SACRED
MAJESTY, who hath
drunk up the very dregs
of the Cup, and suffered
more then can be well
spoken; yet all with so

incomparable a pati∣ence
as worthily de∣serves
our wonder.
My Lord you are a∣mongst
the Prime of the
Nobility, which God
hath yet been pleased to
spare this miserable Na∣tion;
and as you are so, I
could not think any
person fitter for the pa∣tronage
of this small
piece; since both your
loyalty may make you
willing, and your power
able to protect it.

If I have soar'd too
high either in the sub∣ject
or dedication, I
shall humbly crave your
Lordships pardon, and
answer to the first; That
I was willing to vindi∣cate
my Sovereign as
far as in me lay) from
those many reproaches
and calumnies cast up∣on
him by his back-bi∣ting
enemies; by giving
the best account (that
either my own know∣ledge
or the surest intel∣ligence

I could get
might enable me to) of
all his actions, that he
might appear the con∣trary
of what he is re∣presented,
and dirt be
cast in the faces of his
accusers. To the second,
I wholly cast my self on
your Lordship, either
to pardon or condemn.
But if my love to his
Majesty may in the
judgements of some
have strained my pen
too much in his favour,

I desire it may be impu∣ted
not to my intent,
but passion; for the un∣worthy
sufferings of so
worthy a Prince would
irritate any loyal Sub∣ject.
My Lord whilst your
Lordship shall be gra∣ciously
pleased to Pa∣tronize
this small work,
that GOD would be
pleased to restore his
Majesty to be Patron of
his Kingdomes & peo∣ple,
& blesse your Lord∣ship

with all imaginary
blessings shall be the
daily prayer of
