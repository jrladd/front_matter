IVdicious Doctors and professors of the famous and laudable science of Phisicke (in token of the inesti∣mable loue & good will I beare to this worthy faculty) I haue vnto you (as the chiefe patrons thereof,) committed this little Glasse of sick men: wherein you may beholde the state and condi∣tion of the diseased person (soe truely and infallibly, as the Arte of Astrologie can certifie) being aswel cor∣respondent and agreeable to the sayings of auncient and approoued Authors, as by experience and dayly obseruations verified, whereof I my selfe haue made sufficient triall (as many of my familiar friendes and associates can testifie) insomuch that hee which com∣pareth these documents with the iudicials of vrine, shall thereby not onely decerne and perceiue the true cause of the disease, but also the augmentation, relax∣ation, continuance and alteration thereof to good or euill (both to the praise and estimation of the arte, &

also the credit & profit of the expert Physition) assu∣ring you that heerein is nothing written, but onely that which hath been taken out of the groundes of A∣strologie, and agreeable to the sentences of the moste excellentest Physitions. And although peraduenture this methode and manner of iudgement dooth seeme hard and difficile to some men at the first aparance, yet let no mā be discouraged, for with a little reading and perusing, it wil soone appeare both plaine & ea∣sie, which being once obtained, the commoditie ther∣of will bee verie delectable and profitable. And so to conclude, if this my labour be acceptable to your learned eares, it will encourage me (to endeauour to the vtermost of my power) both to examplefie this in∣troduction, and also to supply you with another trea∣tise which shall fully and largely detect and lay open this manner of Iudicials: so in the meane time I commit you (and your industri∣ous actions) to the protection of the Almightie. At Midhurst this 24. of Aprill. 1606. {inverted ⁂}
