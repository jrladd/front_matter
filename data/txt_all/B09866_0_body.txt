MY LORD,
THere is nothing so much amuseth these out of the Communion of the Catholick Church, as the sup∣posed guilt of Disloyalty, maliciously fixed upon the Roman Catholick Religion: Nor is there any thing more confirms this unhappy prejudice in the Hearts of Honest and Loyal Subjects in these Kingdoms, then the Bulls and
damnatory Sentences issued out by the Popes, PAUL the Third and PIUS the Fifth, against King HENRY the Eigth, and Queen ELIZABETH of England: Now untill this great mistake be removed, the Subjects divide amongst them∣selves, and ill Blood is Nourished, to the intollerable dam∣mage of his MAJESTY, whose Interest is the less secured while so dangerous an Hypothesis is unjustly charged on Ca∣tholick Subjects, and no vindication made to wipe off so foul a Crime: For if a Catholick Prince must not trust his Catholick Subjects, he must give only credit to these who would have the municipal Statutes of this Kingdom, made upon politick considerations, unalterable and irreversible, never to be repealed upon the fairest emergencies, and just∣est reflections, that after Ages may make for the discovery of conceived prejudices, which were to bind up the hands of Princes in the prudent management of their Affairs, and re∣strict their supreme Right of Legislation. My LORD. I have adventured to vindicate the Church Catholick from so destructive a Doctrine in as few Words as the subject mat∣ter could allow off: And since none hath suffered the se∣vere lashes of viperous Tongues more then Your Lordship, for that the Catholick Religion is joined in your Person with that great trust reposed in you, and yet far beyond the least tincture or suspicion of Disloyalty, I thought none fitter to shelter and protect this small Essay then Your Lordship I give it then up, My LORD, to Your Patronage, and Tui∣tion, in the protection whereof you will demean your self as a true SON of the Holy Cacholick Church, and justifie the Honest and Religious service of
MY LORD,
