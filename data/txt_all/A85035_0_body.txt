MADAM,
THis my Book addres∣seth
it self to you, as
once the Dove to
NOAH in the Ark, bringing
an Olive branch with three
sprigs in the mouth thereof.

It is of a Peaceable nature, &
desires to be a Peace-maker
betwixt the opposite parties
in the three Controversies
handled therein. My humble
request to you is, that with
NOAH you would be pleased
to put forth your hand and
receive it into the Ark of
your protection. I know what
success commonly attends all
Umpiers & Arbitrators, that
often they lose one, & some∣times
both of their friends be∣twixt
whom they intercede.
Meek Moses could not escape

in this kind, but when seeking
to atone two striving Israel∣ites,
the partie who did the
wrong, fell with foul language
upon him. I expect the like
fate from that side which
doth the most injurie, and am
prepared to undergo their
Censure, which I shall do
with the greater alacritie, if
these my weak endeavors
may find your favourable
acceptance.
The Lord bless your Ho∣nor
with your Noble Con∣sort,
and sanctifie your former

sufferings, which a National
calamitie hath cast upon you,
that your last days may be
your best days, both in tem∣poral
and spiritual improve∣ment,
is the dayly desire of
