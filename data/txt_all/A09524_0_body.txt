I Haue (VVorshipfull & wise) con∣trary to the expectatiō of many, presumed to publish the formall maner of my priuate sorowes, for the great losse of your late decea∣sed Lady-Mistres, & Englands Soueraigne. And knowing your wor. a sad and pen∣siue mourner for so great a losse, I haue made bold to shrowd my teares vnder your sad garment, which if you deigne to shadowe from the heate of enuie, there is no fire of malice can haue power to partch them. Shrowd them at your pleasure, keepe them no longer then you please to mourne, which I knowe will be of long continuance; not that you haue cause by this late chāge, but that the memorial of so sweet a Princes can not be sodainly buried in obliuion. God graunt that the auncient saying in this barter may be verified, which is, we haue changed for the better. Is it pos∣sible a better then Shee should succeed? but what is impossible with the Almightie? VVhat Eliza was in

her life, you know, nay the world knowes her fame girdles in the earth: what her successor hath been in his Kingdom of Scotland, his subiects they know, and we haue heard, which hath been much to Gods glory, his countries peace and his Maiesties honour; There∣fore since it hath pleased God to continue his won∣ted fauour towards vs in blessing vs his vnworthy seruants, with so gratious a Soueraigne, adding vn∣to his royall Crowne the highest tytle of Maiestie and earthlie dignitie: Graunt thou most of might (Almightie King) that our dread Soueraign Iames the first of that name of these three vnited King∣doms, Englād, France & Ireland, and of Scotland the sixt, maye be so directed and gouerned by thy Almightie hand, that he may rule his seuerall King∣doms in peace to thy glory, raigne in tranquility Nestors yeeres to our comfort, and in the end, dye in thy fauour, to liue againe in glory with his aeterni∣z'd Sister diuine Eliza. Thus not dreading your kinde acceptance of my loue, I humblie take my leaue.
