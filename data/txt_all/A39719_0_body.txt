My Noble Lord,
THe People, who (as one sayes well) are Iudges without Iudgement, and Authors without Authority, had condemn'd this Play on the Stage, for want of being right∣ly represented unto them; at which, many noble Persons were so much of∣fended, as I could not in any one Act do it more right, or give them more satisfaction, then by Printing it, to shew its Innocence. As it is, it has had the honour to have been approv'd by most of the better and wiser Sort;

and if your Excellence but adde unto it your Approbation, I desire no more. It wants much of the Ornament of the Stage, but thât by a lively imaginati∣on may easily be supplyed: For my part, unless it may be presented as I writ it, and as I intended it, I had rather it shu'd be read then acted, and have the World for Theatre, rather then the Stage.
Having said thus much by way of Prologue, I leave you to the Play, re∣maining alwayes,
