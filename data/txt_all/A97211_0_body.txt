HONOURED SIR,
THe design of this Dedication is not so much to shelter the en∣suing Treatise under the pro∣tection of your name (let it stand or fall at the bar of Scripture and right reason) as to shew my real and unfeigned gratitude for the many and much-obliging favours you have been been pleased to heap upon me, both while I lived under your roof, and since my removal to a more publike station: I thought thus with my self, It is the first, and likely to be the last time of my appearing in Print, therefore the best and fittest season to signifie my due resentment of your love
and friendship, which from first to last, since my acquaintance with you, I have experienced so firm and constant; as also to shew the precions esteem I still have of you and your pious Family, which as I found, so I left most religiously devoted to the practise of the truth here pleaded for, the keep∣ing holy of the Lords day, the undoubt∣ed Christian Sabbath; it is verily no small joy to me in these days of liberty and loosness to find any (especially of your rank) walking in this truth of Christ. Go on (dear Sir) in this good old way of truth and holiness, be you still a friend to this good day [the Lords Day] and the Lord will be a friend to you in in an evil day, yea, in that great day of his appearing, Concerning which, as Paul prayed for Onesiphorus and his hous∣hold [the Lord grant that he may find mer∣cy of the Lord in that day] so prays for you and yours
