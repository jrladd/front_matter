May it please Your Highness,
THe Eyes of all knowing Persons, not only in this Nati∣on, but all Europe over, and beyond it also, are fixed on Your Highness: You attract them by Your Candour, and oblige them by the Inimitable Example of Your Courage: And amongst the number of those who dayly do throng in to admire and honour You, it is my Glory to be one, who having received my best Encouragements from the Influence of Your Heroick Greatness, shall make it my dayly business accordingly to declare it, and to endeavour to be worthy of it.
May it please Your Highness,
The late War in many Testimonies of Incomparable Valour shew∣ed how much You honoured the Late King; and in some Testimonies again, it shewed how much we (who were Your Souldiers) honoured You, whose Spirits You so often rouzed up to the out-daring of all Dangers by the admirable Example of Your height of Fortitude: Then I endeavoured to serve You with my Sword, as I have done since with my Pen, and have been in both as elaborate as Resolution, and Art can make me.
May it please Your Highness,
I modestly do presume that this Piece on His Majesties most Happy Marriage with the Princess of Portugal will not be unacceptable to Your Highness; It hath received the happiness to be much applauded by Persons of Eminent Judgment who have perused it: May it me∣rit the Honour to be protected by Your Highness, to whom most pre∣cisely it doth devote it self, his Desires and Ambition are crown'd, who is,
(May it please Your Highness)
