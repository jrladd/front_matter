SIR,
I shall make you but a bad Re∣turn
for Lending me these Me∣moirs,
by sending them back in
my English. However I did not
think I could be too intent upon
them, when the longer I read, and
considered this Book, the Chara∣cters
of two such Brothers as the
Duke of Bouillon, and Mare∣schal
Turenne; raised in me a True
and more Lively Idea of your
Sons, the Colonel, and the Captain.
It is true, that the former being

born Princes, became Great Gene∣rals,
but then they lived long in
the World to obtain it: whereas
the other Two Brothers, though
cut off in their Bloom, had done
more than any of such an Age could
do, towards Equalling their Great
Examples.
The Battle of Sedan, in which
the Duke of Bouillon got his great∣est
Glory, has nothing more Con∣siderable
in it than the Action, by
which he gained the Enemies Can∣non:
and, upon Reading this, who
could not but have an Image of
Colonel Warcupp's Bravery in the
Battle of Steynkirk, where he drove
the French from their Cannon, and
laid his own Half-Pike upon them.
In the same Battle when the Count
de Soissons should have received the
Advantage of the Victory, It is
with Surprize that we find him
dead. This naturally brings Ca∣ptain

Warcupp to our Remembrance,
who, when He should have recei∣ved
the New Commands, which,
for his Valour, the King designed
Him, was (instead of enjoying the
Reward) found mortally wounded
in His Majesty's Service.
This, to a common Reader, may
seem a melancholy and an improper
Address to a Father, but then they
must be Ignorant of the Greatness
of Sir Edmund Warcupp's Mind, and
his true Notions of Honour. La∣cedaemon
heretofore gloried in so
great a Man as Thrasibulus, who,
receiving his Son Pitanas dead up∣on
a Shield in his Countrey's Ser∣vice,
Interred him with these Ex∣pressions:
Let other Fathers shed
Tears; I'll not: This Youth died, like
mine: Like a Spartan.
England has Reason to boast of a
Double Honour in Sir Edmund War∣cupp,
who with such an Evenness

of Temper, and Heroick Patience,
could bear the Loss of Two Sons, so
Young, so Brave, so very much his
own, and so true English Men.
As for my own part, were I to
be a Father, I should wish for such
Sons; and must they die! I would
lose them after the same manner.
And, I am sure, that in bearing of
my Misfortune, I could have no bet∣ter
Pattern than your self. But,
in the Circumstances I am in, at
present, there is nothing I am more
Ambitious of, than to be Admitted
amongst the Number of,
