My Lord,
AS Your Grace is both a Po∣pular and Publick Peer, I have humbly made bold to offer this Publick Treatise at the Altar of Your Illustri∣ous Name: And if, my Lord, the Offer∣ing be too mean for so magnificent an Al∣tar, Let it be Burnt, and the Flame thereof may give me light to see my present Pre∣sumption.
My Lord, Other Apollogy or Plea I have none, besides that never-dying Ob∣ligation I owe your most Renowned Father of Blessed Memory, whose Diffusive Good∣ness
hath not only made Me, but indeed three Kingdoms to be his Debtor.
Since then, My Lord, Bonds which are so justly due, must in all Equity be discharged, and the sublimity of his pre∣sent Station cannot Permit me to Cancel them to Himself; Yet Give me Leave then to Confess them to His Magnanimous Son, your Thrice Noble Self, the Inhe∣ritour of his Heroick Spirit, as you are of his Paternal Possessions.
To the Plenitude and full Fruition of both which, that your Grace may Gradu∣ally Arrive, and with your Years increase your Heirs and Honours, is the most Cor∣dial Prayer of Sir,
