MOst honorable and most worthie to be honored Knight, Cato hath set downe his Opinion, That those that did nothing learned to do ill.
I beleeue him, and I thinke it a∣gaine to be true that he doth much euill that knoweth no good at all.
I may boldly speake thus much (without any great ostentation to my selfe) that I do sometimes thinke of doing good, though I doe but little, now he that some∣times thinketh well, perhaps other whiles may hyt vppon doing well: but when I looke into the Cattalogue where good deedes are commanded, I find it written that we must Feed the hun∣gry, Cloath the naked, Helpe the poore and needy. Com∣fort the comfortlesse, Visite those that be sicke.
When I looke againe vnto my betters, that are well able to performe these prescriptions: I find the most good they doe, is God helpe ye, God helpe ye, indeede I haue not for ye.
Well God be thanked yet, good prayers are good cheape, for we had rather open our mouthes, and say God helpe ye twentie times, then once to open our purses and to bestowe a penny.
Now to speake of any good that I can doe my selfe, I confesse it is very small, yet to auoyde that ill that Cato sayes wee doe

learne by doing nothing, I haue betaken my selfe to my penne, thereby to auoyd idlenesse, I haue wouen out the Webbe of vaine Opinion, briefly expressing howe it hath Dominered from the beginning: I haue made a short Medly of altogether, if it be good for any thing I care not, I hope it will proue eyther hotte or colde, and then it may be imployed to vse, eyther fit for Summer or Winter, be it good or badde or howe so euer, I haue made bolde to present it to your iudicious view, wherein I haue imitated his simplicity, that presumed to present lines to Mi∣nerua, but it is Opinion that hath made me thus bolde, yet not the Opinion of mine owne wit or worthynesse, but the O∣pinion that I haue of your worthy acceptance, for I haue so much the better Opinion of my selfe, knowing my selfe to bee fauoured by you: it is your many fauours towardes mee, that hath alwayes made mee mindfull of your vertue and worthy∣nesse.
I beseech you Syr, to accept it as a seruice of his good in∣tent that would bee glad to present you with more worthyer presents: in the meane time, can but wish long life, still lengthened out with all happynesse, e∣uermore resting.
