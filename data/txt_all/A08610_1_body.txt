HAuing my selfe taken no small comfort (good Chri∣stian Reader) by the reading and pervsing of diuers verie godlie, learned, and duiine treatises, of medi∣tations and praier, made by sundrie right famous Queenes, noble Ladies, vertuous Virgins, and god∣lie Gentlewomen of al ages (who to shew themselues woorthie paternes of all pietie, godlinesse, and religi∣on to their sex, and for the common benefit of their countrie, haue not ceased, and that with all carefull industrie and earnest indeuour, most painfullie and diligentlie in great feruencie of the spirit, and zeale of the truth, euen from their tender & maidenlie yeeres, to spend their time, their wits, their substance, and also their bodies, in the studies of noble and approoued sciences, and in compiling and translating of sundrie most christian and godlie bookes: a tast whereof you haue here in the second Lampe) as namelie among the rest, the godlie and learned treatise called The lamentation of a sinner, written long since by the vertuous Ladie Queene Katherin, which for the ex∣cellencie thereof was first published in print by Sir William Cicill, now the right Honourable Lord Treasurer of England, as by his verie godlie, learned, and eloquent Epistle therevnto prefixed, and here also in this edition now inser∣ted, to Gods glorie, and his high commendation doth and may appeere: but espe∣ciallie and aboue all, the most diuine, learned, and godlie treatise intituled The Queenes meditation, written first in French by the vertuous Ladie Margaret Queene of Nauar, and after verie exactlie and faithfullie translated by our mostgratious souereigne, and learned Ladie Queene ELIZABETH, who among manie Queens, virgins, and women, through the feare of the Lord hath doone verie vertuouslie, and gotten thereby great renowme. And therevpon considering with my selfe what great profit, and singular pleasure might thereby come also to other of like mind to my selfe, if the same their excellent and rare works (dispersed into seuerall pamphlets, and in part some thing obscured and worne cleane out of print, and so out of practise) were by some painefull hand collected togither, and reuiued, or brought againe to their former good and godlie vse in the church: mee thought I could not better spend my time, nor emploie my talent, either for the renowme of such heroicall authors and woorthie women, or for the vniuersall commoditie of all good christians: than in, and by some apt treatise or collection, to reduce these their manifold works into one entire volume, and by that meanes, for to register their so rare and excellent monuments, of good record, as perfect presidents of true pietie and godlinesse in woman kind to all posteritie. Wherevpon, God wor∣king in me both the will and consent, I vndertooke the same in his feare: which when after a sort I had doone, and perceiued that there wanted per manie things to make the same an absolute and perfect booke for the simpler sort of women, ac∣cording to my mind: to satisfie my selfe further in this my purposed collection, I fell to the pervsing of the holie Bible, and manie other good bookes as well of praier, as of other diuine matter, such as from time to tune haue beene penned by diuers godlie learned men: out of the which (that I might now particularlie ap∣plie that vnto them, women I meane, which generalise hereto fore was written of them, or by some other, for them, as also to the inter & that all godlie and deuout women readers might haue in some measure, wherewith to exercise their faith; to stir vp their deuotion, and to satisfie their godlie desires: and also verie readilie find without tediousnesse, or distraction of the mind vertuouslie inclined, whatshe∣uer

they would either by praier aske, by meditation ponder, by precepts learne, or by examples imitate, or auoid to their comfort & edification) I indeuoured for their sakes, by all possible diligence, to cull and bring out of the rich store and treasurie of the approoued works of manie learned men, things both old and new concer∣ning the same, both for priuate and publike vse, adding therevnto such plentie of heauenlie and spirituall helpes, both for profit and pleasure, as the diuersities of so diuine matter, and varietie of so honourable inuentions would affoord. Besides, to auoid confusion and disorder (a thing verie preiudiciall to so holie an exercise) I haue carefullie digested the same into such a plaine, easie, familiar, and certeine method, order, and direction, both for matter and maner, as I could possiblie deuise. or was requisite for such a worke, to make it profitable to the simple and vnlear∣ned reader. Lastlie, bicause the diuersitie of matter forced a distinction of the treati∣ses, I fitly, as I could, haue diuided and contriued the whole booke into seuen seue∣rall parts or Lampes: all which for diuers good and approoued considerations I terme or intitle by this generall name, THE MONVMENT OF MATRONES. And now make bold, yet vnder the deliberate view, and carefull correction of manie vevie graue, wise, learned, and godlie Diuines, therevnto appointed by au∣thoritie: as also with the approbation and allowance of the right reuerend father in God my Lord the bishop of London, to publish the same abroad in print, as a booke, in the iudgement of them that are learned, not vnprofitable to the church: but verie necessarie, and in some respect, more proper and peculiar for the priuate vse of women, than hertofore hath beene set out by anie. Which I haue doone not for that there lacked praier bookes sufficient for women to read, but onelie to in∣crease the plentie of heauenlie comforts, wherewith this our church and realme of England (thanks be to God) floweth: as also to make this treatise heretofore (in part) priuate to my selfe, and a few of my freends, now publike and common al∣so to you good christian readers. For behold (I protest) I haue not laboured for my selfe, but for you, and all them that seeke knowledge, feare God, be deuout, and would (not by fits and starts, as those that can find scarse anie leisure to attend vp∣on the Lord and his seruice as they ought: but) daie and night continuallie and incessantlie, either silentlie in hart with Hanna, or openlie in mouth with Ma∣rie, as they are bound, spend their whole life, and make it their whole worke to praie, meditate, and read Gods word with other such good bookes, or at the least to allow to themselues some little portion or part of the daie and night, to pro∣strate themselues apart from all companie in praier and meditation before the Lord of heauen and earth their creator, redeemer, and sauiour, and that in all chri∣stian perfection, and humble obedience to his word and commandements. So haue you good reader, by the goodnesse of God, who worketh all our works for vs, here now at the length in this Monument or collection conteined (if you list so for di∣stinction or names sake to call or intitle them) not onelie a burning Lampe for vir∣gins, but also a christall Mirrour for Matrones: as also a delectable Diall for to di∣rect you to true deuotion, with a perfect President or register of holie praier for all women generally to haue recourse vnto, as to their homelie or domestical librarie.
First, a Lampe, readie replenished and prepared of the wise virgins, with that fragrant oile, pretious perfume, and odoriferous incense of holie inuocation, pure praier, diuine sacrifice, and heauenlie worship, wherewith God is so highlie plea∣sed and whereby at his holie hand the virgine or single woman, through the inter∣cession of Christ, obteineth the gift of puritie, modestie, shamefastnesse, and chastitie: the deflowred woman findeth grace to repent, and to be restored to fauour both with God and men: the naturall or stepdaughter to reuerence and obeie hir pa∣rents in all childlike duties: the wooed woman not to be by anie meanes cosined or abused in marriage: the yoong married wife to consecrate hir selfe to liue holi∣lie in that honourable estate: the elder married woman, to liue louinglie, faith∣fullie, and quietlie with hir husband: the woman with child, to escape the pit of so great perils, and to be thankfull for hir mightie deliuerance after childbirth: the midwife, and women assistants, dutifullie and diligentlie to aid, comfort, and cherish the trauelling woman: the mother carefullie to bring vp hir chil∣dren: the daughter naturallie to cherish and obeie hir mother: the mother in lawe, to liue charitablie and louinglie with the daughter in lawe: againe, the daughter in lawe to be haue hir selfe christianlie and curteouslie to the mother in

lawe: the dame or mistresse, to intreate hir handmaids well: the handmaids to shew all dutifull and faithfull seruice to their mistresse: the widowe, to comfort hir selfe in all sorrowes: the old woman to number hir daies, that she may applie hir hart vnto wisedome: both yoong and old, one and other to consider their creation, condition, vocation, and saluation, the better to liue to learne, to learne to liue, and to liue to die. To conclude, a Lampe (I saie) for all estates and degrees of women generallie, to carrie euer in their hands and hart by the burning light and flaming fire of the reading whereof, their faith, knowledge, zeale, deuotion, perseuerance in praier, almes deeds, fasting, with the loue of God and their brethren, the desire of vertue, and all maner of godlinesse shall be thoroughlie kindled and increased in them, so oft as they war cold, heauie, drowsie, slouthfull, dull, negligent, and remisse, by too much bodilie ease, worldlie prosperitie, vaine pleasures, pomps, and de∣lights of this wretched life: and they at all times made readie, like wise and pru∣dent virgins, to meet the bridegroome whensoeuer he commeth, to be receiued of him, and to enter with him ioifullie into the celestiall wedding chamber of his eternall happinesse, there to glorifie and praise him for euer and euer.
Secondlie, a Mirrour for all sorts of wicked women, as in a cleere glasse with Athalia, Iezabell, Herodias, and such like, perfectlie to see their shamelesse pride, crueltie, idolatrie, and contempt of religion, with Putiphers wife, to behold their incontinencie and infidelitie towards their husbands: with Appam their shame∣lesse impudencie: with Cozbi, their manifest whoordomè and adulterie: with the witch of Fndor, their abhominable sorceries: with Queene Dasthy their disobe∣ence to their souereigne: with Bethshemah and Iudith their rebellious stubbor∣nesse to their louing parents in lawe: with Hagar their contempt of their mi∣stresse: with Miviant their murmuring against their onelie brother: with Heua their subtiltie and couetousnes to beguile their husbands: with Zipporah, Mi∣chol, Iobs wife, old Anna, Tobit, &c. their vnsemelie vpbraidings and bitter taun∣ting, or chiding of their godlie husbands, &c. least that for their great impietie and vngodlinesse with Queene Maacha, they be deposed from their seate of maiestie: or with Baara, and Q. Dasthy, they be diuorced from their husbands: or with A∣thalia, they be slaine without the temple: or with Cozbi, be thrust through with a sword, or with Iezabel, in all their brauerie they be throwne headlong downe in∣to the street out of their owne windowe, and be eaten and deuoured of dogs, and so want the honour of christian buriall: or with Saphyra be striken with sudden death at the Apostles feete: or with the Leuites wife be shamefullie abused to death, and after chopt in peeces: or with Samsons wife be burnt to ashes in the house where they dwell: to conclude, least with the whoore of Babel they be cast quicke into the bottomlesse pit of perdition: or with the flue foolish virgins they be shut cleane out of heauen, and go aliue downe into hell, there to be damned for euer, if in time they call not for grace to beware and repent them of their former wickednesse. Againe, a Mirrour contrariwise for all godlie and vertuous women plainlie to behold the faith, religion, modestie, sobrietie, sinceritie of life and con∣uersation of Sara, Ruth, Q. Candaces, Bernice, Susanna, Elizabeth, the blessed virgine Marie, &c. The holinesse, deuotion, feare of God, iustice, vprightnesse, &c. of Hanna, Q. Hester, &c. The rare wisedome, excellent knowledge, great learning, po∣litike gouernement, courage, magnanimitie, with the memorable vertues of De∣borah, Abigael, Bethsheba, Huldah, Iacl, the woman of Tekoah, Philips foure daughters, the Ladie commended by saint Iohn, &c. The famous cities, and state∣lie territories and towers built by Sherah that noble Gentlewoman to hir per∣petuall renowme. The bountifull hospitalitie, great liberalitie, and often almes deeds of the Shunamitesse that vertuous Gentlewoman, of Dorcas, Lydia, Io∣anna, Iudith, &c. The constant and faithfull loue towards their husbands, of Sara, Michol, Susanna, &c. The motherlie and carefull affection towards their children, of Sara, Hannah, Bethsheba, the blessed virgine Marie, the widowe of Sarepta, Samsons mother, &c. The dutifull obedience towards their parents, of Q. Hester, Iepthas daughter, Orpha, Ruth, Sara, &c. The good intreatie and christian beha∣uiour towards their handmaids of Sara, Lea, Iudith, &c. The fidelitie and obedi∣ent seruice towards their mistresse, of Hagar, Abia, Rhode, &c. The great kindnesse and curtesie towards their freends, kindred, and aliance of Bethsheba, Elizabeth, Q. Hester, Iehosheba, Rizpah, &c. The womanlie pitie & tender harted compassion

and affection toward the distressed and persecuted members of Christ, of Puah, Shiphrah, Rachel, Pharaos daughter, Rizpah, O Hester, Iehosheba, Pilaces wife, Marie Magdalen, Martha, &c. The sore labour and paines taking to get their owne liuing, of Anna Tobit, Lydia, Naomy, Ruth, Dorcas, &c. Finallie the admirable humilitie, and inuincible patience and constancie in all aduersities and persecution euen to the death and martyrdome, of Iepthas daughter, Susanna, the mother of the seuen brethren, and women of the Machabites, and manie other: that looking in this glasse of the holie liues of their foremothers, they may chri∣stianlie conforme and adorne themselues after their good examples, and become for their rare vertues verie beautifull spouses in the fight of their spirituall bride∣groome Iesus Christ: to whom, as the kings daughters, they may appeere all glorious within, and of whom with the lambes wife they may be marked in the forehead with the testimonie of his name Iesus, to the end that being clothed with the sunne of righteousnesse, and crowned with the twelue stars of God and his word, and treading the moone of this worldlie affections vnder their feet, they may euermore be deliuered by him their valiant Michael, and his angels from the power of the red dragon, which so greedilie gapeth to deuoure them: and pos∣sesse their soules in patience, in the restfull place of the presence of God, long since prepared for the elect where they shall be nourished and preserued for time & times, and together with all holie virgins, matrones, martyrs, and elect people of God, ioifullie triumph and be glad for the gift of their euerlasting happinesse.
Thirdlie, a Diall of deuotion to direct you by the glorious globe and shine of the bright sunne of righteousnesse, which inlighteneth all things in the world, ve∣rie readilie and plainlie at all feasts and seasons of the yeere, and at all houres and times of the daie and night continuallie vnto the holie mount of heauenlie con∣templation and to the christian meditation and consideration of euerlasting felici∣tie in celestiall things, the better to contemne and forget all terrene, base, vile, mo∣mentanie, and earthlie vanities.
Fourthlie and lastlie, a domesticall librarie plentifullie stored and replenished both of the best approoued presidents of christian praiers and diuine meditations, made from time to time by manie right godlie authors, men and women of all ages: and also of the chosen sentences or perfect precepts of holie scripture con∣cerning the christian duties of all degrees and estates of women in their seuerall callings, together with the pleasant histories and memorable acts, liues, and death of all maner of women good and bad, by name or without name, mentioned in the old and new testaments of the bible, where among, for the better vnderstanding of the text, I haue inserted some notes out of the Geneua bible with some difference by parenthesis, verie necessarie for the simple reader. All which treatises, though not so portable, yet so delectable, profitable, and readie prepared to lie in your secret chamber or oratorie to vse: howsoeuer intituled or called, God grant they may as diligentlie be read and fruitfullie practised of you, good readers, as they and euerie of them (I am sure) were painfullie compiled and faithfullie purposed of the au∣thors. And for these, and all other such good helpes and furtherances to faith, de∣uotion, and godlinesse, God make both you and me alwaie thankfull vnto his ma∣iestie, who by all meanes, at all times, and through all ages, most gratiouslie vseth both the ministerie of men and angels, to doo vs good continuallie, that through our vnthankfulnesse and wilfull contempt of his good gifts and graces dailie of∣fered by so manie high, learned, and painfull hands, we may not loose the same and the profit thereof, by loathing that, which we ought most to loue and imbrace, but rather in good time by our grateful acceptation and approbation of that which deserues good liking, gaine to ourselues comfort and consolation, and encourage others (which as yet of anie singular affection for their priuate vse conceale or de∣teine the woorks of anie godlie authors men or women) to take good opportuni∣tie by this occasion offered euen for the common benefit of Christs congregation, to publish the same abroad, for the perfection of this good worke, to the glorie of God, and the authors euerlasting praise and commendation both with God and men: that full deseruedlie it may be said of them, as most woorthilie it is of these my right christian and heroicall authors.
Etsi mors indies accelerat,
Viuit tamen post funera virtus.

Thus being awaked vp last of all as one that gathereth after them in the vintage, I haue laboured as you see (good reader) like a poore gleaner or grape gatherer with restlesse Ruth to go after the maidens in the haruest, and to gleane and ga∣ther for my mother Naomi certeine handfuls of corne, after the reapers and pain∣full labourers among the sheaues, let fall of deuotion in the fruitfull feelds of cha∣ritable Boaz: and haue assailed, as you well perceiue, to replenish my wine presse with the grapes of the Lords plentifull vintage, and to fill my lampes brimfull with the oile of Gods good blessing and rich store, left behind by the wise virgins in the holie vessels of his increase. Here therefore if I might be so bold without offense, as in the name of the foresaid blessed Boaz, I would gladlie exhort and persuade Ruth, and in hir all other godlie women of the simple sort, to followe this his good counsell (who saith: Heare me, my daughter, and go to none other feeld to gather, neither depart from hence to gleane, but abide here by my maidens, let thine eies be on the feeld that they doo reape in, and go thou after the maidens: and when thou art athirst go also to the vessels, and drinke of that which the ser∣uants and handmaids haue drawne, and when thou art hungrie, come hither and eate of the bread, and dip thy morsell in the vineger, and sit by the reapers, and thou shalt be satisfied to the full.) So now least you should gather by anie method, order, diuision, title, direction, or application, that you shall find in this booke, or anie part therof, that I go about nicelie, curiouslie, or strictlie to inioine you to obserue hours, daies, feasts, times, or seasons, or to bind you vnlawfullie to an impossibilitie, as of necessitie to vse all or euerie of these praiers and meditations, in place, maner, and forme as they are set downe (although it is to be wished that for the most part they might, if it were possible, or the necessities of this turbulent life would permit) that you should not mistake me, I saie, and iudge that my purpose is in anie respect to hinder common praier, or interrupt the ministration of the word and sacra∣ments in the church, where & at what time I knowe we ought all to glorifie God together with one hart, spirit, and mouth, and to be no otherwise occupied, either in reading or in praieng, than the publike minister is, vnlesse we would be deemed meere superstitious, and vnder the pretense of seuerall deuotion to commit mani∣fest vngodlinesse: I thinke it verie necessarie for me to let you vnderstand (gentle reader) that my meaning herby was and is, simplie first to plaie the part of a faith∣full collector, by following my copies trulie, and placing their works and praiers together as I found them referred by the authors for priuate or publike vse: se∣condlie, for order and memorie sake, after the good example of the learned fathers of our time, to intitle, reduce, and applie those other godlie meditations and prai∣ers, which for the matter I found woorthie the more often vse in the church, or elsewhere, vnto some more speciall place, apt time, and peculiar purpose, than here∣tofore (to my knowledge) by anie others haue beene intituled, referred, or applied. But thirdlie and principallie by the meanes of some plaine forme and easie me∣thod of praier and meditation, to prepare for the vnlearned at all times, and in all places such and so manie sorts, as to auoid ignorance and tediousnesse might con∣uenientlie serue to further their godlie desires, to the glorie of God, the confusion of sathan, and their owne eternall comfort in Christ Iesus: referring them not∣withstanding, which you shall find proper for the church to be vsed there onelie at conuenient times by the ordinances of the church lawfullie permitted: the rest which are more priuate to be vsed elsewhere at your discretions, when and so often as opportunitie shall serue, and Gods spirit by his heauenlie motion giue you anie occasion. For as I would not haue you thinke hereby, that I my selfe doo in all re∣spects obserue this order here prescribed (although I assure you I striue to doo it either within booke or without: and repent from the bottome of my hart the of∣ten omission of it in times past) so I wish you good readers, which christianlie haue consecrated and vowed to giue your selues to this holie exercise (as the Lord, I saie, in mercie shall giue you grace, leisure, time, and occasion, and not suffer you to be tired with anie worldlie necessitie) in the name and feare of God, to obserue this or that order, method, forme, or direction, which he in his word dooth allow of, or you knowe best will keepe you in the continuall faith, feare, and fauour of God.
For trust me, if you will but a little together with me call these ten memora∣ble things to your christian remembrance in this so holie an exercise. First, the  commandements of almightie God himselfe, whom in consideration of our owne

great miserie and necessitie, and common lacke of the christian congregation, hath willed vs to call vpon him, saieng: Praie alwaies with all maner of praiers and supplicati∣ons in the spirit, and watch therevnto with all perseuerance. Secondlie, his most sweet and  comfortable promises made gratiouslie both to heare and grant our godlie and lawfull requests, saieng: Aske, and ye shall haue; seeke, and ye shall find; knocke, and it shall be opened vnto you: for euerie one that calleth vpon the name of the Lord, and departeth from iniquitie, shall be saued, &c. Thirdlie, our great and manifold sinnes, whereof we are guiltie, which will not suffer vs to sit still without care, but briueth vs of necessitie to beg  his most gratious pardon. Fourthlie, our feeble flesh and weake nature vnable in euerie respect to doo anie good thing, which requireth continuall praier to aid and  strength it. Fiftlie, the wilie subtiltie of our spirituall enimie sathan, who priuilie lurketh in the inward parts, waiting euen in our best actions to trip and ouer∣throwe  vs, against whom we must by feruent praier vehementlie striue. Sixtlie,  our owne greeuous assalts and cruell temptations, which neuer giue vs truce, rest, nor quietnesse, but hasten vs verie much vnto God for helpe. Seuenthlie, the zeale of the glorie of God, and aduancement of his kingdome, which ought wholie to  drawe and moone vs continuallie to exercise our selues in the seruice of GOD. Eightlie, the dailie dangers and continuall calamities that hourelie hang ouer our heads, which giue vs all cause enough, yea euen the most holie, and that with sighs  and grones continuallie to flie vnto God our heauenlie father, and call vpon him by feruent praiers. Ninthlie, the infinite benefits and great blessings of God so bountifullie and plentifullie euerie waie powred continuallie vpon vs, which giue  vs both ample matter, and iust occasion hourelie by thankesgiuing, euen from the bottome of our harts to praise and magnifie him for the same. Tenthlie and lastlie,  the great excellencie, woorthinesse, necessitie, vertue, fruit, and profit of true and christian praier, consisting partlie in the dignitie of God the commander, and part∣lie in the effect of obteining of whatsoeuer we aske according to his will. These things I saie, good reader, well considered, I suppose you will saie here is nothing superfluous: but all little enough to so needfull and profitable an exercise of our faith, praier I meane, as wherein the peace of conscience, yea our whole saluation consisteth, and whereby God himselfe is said to be present with vs, not onelie by his prouidence to watch ouer vs, but also by his power to susteine and succour vs, and by his goodnesse and mercie to receiue vs into his fatherlie grace and fauour.
Yea I doubt not, but you will willinglie confesse with me, I saie, that all sorts of deuout women haue great cause, and that continuallie, to take these lamps into their hands, thereby either with vanished Hagar to acknowledge Gods graces to∣wards them: or with desolate Naomi to praie that God would blesse their chil∣dren to be staies and staues of their age to their comfort: or with heuie Hanna to powre out their harts before the Lord in teares for a sonne, and for his mercie and fauour towards them: or with wise Abigael, by praier to preuent the mischeefes that hang as well ouer their heads, as their families: yea or with hir often on their knees to praie for the good prosperitie and preseruation of their gratious go∣uernour Queene ELIZABETH: or with the church and faithfull soule of all chri∣stians, to long for the kisses of the peace of Christ their spirituall spouse, and neuer to cease daie nor night to seeke him, whom their soule loueth, till by praier and me∣ditation they haue found him: or with the wofull daughter of Sion, to lament and mourne pitiouslie for their sinnes, till their miseries be mitigated, and they com∣forted: or with sorrowfull Sara Tobit in fasting, and teares to be deliuered from dailie reproches and slanderous roongs: or wich vertuous Iudith in sack cloth and ashes to obteine strength and courage mightilie to destroie and ouercome proud Olophernes, with all the huge host of his bloudie ruffians: or with noble Queene Hester to proclaime a fast, and call their virgins, families, and people to∣gether, to praie daie and night to the hazarding of their owne liues also, if need so require for their owne further preseruation, and their peoples and subiects safetie and deliuerance out of the hands of cruell Haman, and all his seditious conspira∣tors: or with chast and innocent Susanna to appeale to God the high iudge of iud∣ges, to be acquitted from a violeut death by false accusation, and more vniust con∣deinuation: or with the afflicted church in exile, to acknowledge their sinnes, and call for mercie to be deliuered from distresse: or with the woman of Canaan to flie vnto Christ in all necessities, to be releeued both bodilie and ghostlie: or with our

most gratious Souereigne Ladie Queene ELIZABETH, to muse diuinelie of the inward loue of the soule towards Christ their spouse, their Lord and father, mo∣ther and brother: or with the vertuous Ladie Queene KATHERINE, to vewaile the ignorance of their blind life led in superstition: and with hir also in all their troubles to stir vp their godlie minds patientlie to suffer all afflictions for the loue of euerlasting felicitie: or with the right godlie Ladie Iane Dudley to endure the crosse to death most patientlie: or with good Ladie Tirwit to exercise them selues morning and euening in fruitfull and godlie praiers, psalmes▪ hymnes, and medi∣tations: or with the honourable Ladie Aburgauennie by the like, to tread the path to paradise for the health of their soule: or with holie Agnus and Eulalia the martyrs, to triumph in the victorie of Christs death: or with Anne Askew the marryr to praie hartilie for their enimies: or with maister Bradfords mother to be petitioners vnto God for the constancie in faith to death of their children: or with mistresse Dorcas Alarten carefullie to instruct their whole familie in the principall points of christian religion: or with other graue and godlie matrones vnknowne, to exhort others to mortification and holinesse of life, and to flie vnto God in all troubles for releefe as he hath commanded.
That so with the fiue foolish virgins it be neuer too late for them to crie, Lord, Lord, open to vs: but that to their comforts and the praise of God, with Miriam they may euermore vpon their timbrels sing the song of Moses, for their mightie and miraculous delinerance from sathan their spirituall Pharao: and with De∣bora giue great thanks for the victorie got by our Iahel against Sicera: and with holie Hannah reioise from the hart, and praise God in the temple for the birth of their children, and safe deliuerance: and with the women of Israel triumph vp∣on timbrels for the famous victories of Dauids daughter our noble Queene ELIZABETH had against all hir enimies: and with the spirituall spouse at the marriage daie sing the sweet song of songs to the glorie of the bridegroome Christ Iesus: and with Sara Tobit blesse the name of God for their deliuerance from slanderous reproches, and the einil spirit Asmodens, that enimie of holie matri∣monie: and with holie Iudith highlie praise God for hir and hir peoples mightie preseruation out of the hands of their cruell enimies: and with the blessed vir∣gine Marie continuallie magnifie the Lord their Sauiour, for their high exalta∣tion and fauour with God, with men, and with angels: and with our most gra∣tious Queene ELIZABETH, incessantlie to yeeld all possible praise and hartie thanks for their so often, mightie, and maruellous preseruation and deliuerance from so manie kinds of dangers, yea deaths and destruction pretended by sathan and his bloudie ministers dailie against them.
Finallie, that all godlie women (taking hereby good occasion with these their holie foremothers continuallie to make their petitions for the preuenting of euils: their supplications, for the obteining of all things needfull for soule and bodie: their intercessions as well for others, as for themselues: and their thanks∣giuings for corporall and spiritual benefits receiued) may shew themselues daugh∣ters woorthie such mothers: virgins woorthie such lamps of perpetuall virgi∣nitie: and women woorthie such ghostlie weapons of their right christian mini∣stration to helpe their weakenesse (praiers, precepts, and meditations I meane) by following their vertues wiselie in the perfect feare of God: by bearing the same in the hand of their harts carefullie in the due obedience of their prince: and by fighting therewith in Golgatha the field of this spirituall warfare, the good fight of faith couragiouslie in the pure loue of their countrie, and christian charirie to∣wards their neighbours: and at the last in the world to come to the glorie of God, & their euerlasting comfort togither with the wise virgins, and all the elect people of God, ioifullie triumph ouer all weaknesse, infirmitie, and corruption: yea ouer sinne, death, hell, and damnation, and saie: Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh hell, where is thy victorie?
But now if in wading so far in this argument of praier, and in making this bolume so big, ante shall thinke or saic, that I, by mine idlenesse and time thus spent, am verie chargeable vnto them: and considering the plentie of prater books more portable alreadie extant, shall iudge me to haue taken a verie needlesse or bootlesse trauell, or to haue laboured in vaine, and spent my strength for nothing, as he that would addestars to the skie, or light a lampe at noone daie, and there∣fore

shall deeme me woorthie in their opinions to loose both Oleum & operam. Oh forgiue me this wrong I praie you: and considering that I could not otherwise either satisfie my selfe to go forward in my determined purpose, according to the prescript order of this collection, or pleasure the simple reader with such plentie and varietie of profitable matter, especiallie in so good paper and faire vsuall let∣ter, a thing to the aged and feeble sighted reader verie gratefull and much desired. Let me intreate you whosoeuer you be, to measure the same rather by the good∣nesse of the contents, of the which the godlie can neuer haue enough: than by the bignesse or deerenesse of the volume, which to the willing and desirous mind are euer best cheape. So no doubt shall the pleasure and profit of the one at the least counteruaile, if not far surmount, the paine and charges of the other.
As for my selfe (good reader) who haue rudelie as you see vndertaken this great labour, I protest, I haue doone it neither of presumption, as he that would vsurpe the office of a Diuine, and intrude himselfe into the studies of other pro∣fessions: nor of arrogancie, as he that would boast and make great brags of other mens labours: nor of enuie, as he that went about to make frustrate and insuffi∣cient the painfull and godlie works of better learned: neither yet of ambition or vaineglorie, as he that gaped after the praise and commendation of anie, or that would faine seeme to be approoued and registred of anie Chronicler for an author, or one that knoweth somewhat, who in deed knowes nothing, much lesse for all this deserues to be thought of aboue that, which anie either of their owne know∣ledge, or by true report doo, or shall see in me, knowe me to be, or heare of me. Therefore I saie (good reader) my iudgement, howsoeuer it please others to iudge of me, and of mine intent herein, is, I knowe with the Lord that formed me from the wombe, to be his seruant: for he is the eie witnesse of mine integritie and sim∣ple meaning herein, I saie, in whom my life is hid, and to whom I am made ma∣nifest, doo line, and must die.
As for my worke (so honourable for the verie authors, so godlie for the mat∣ter, so necessarie for the time, so profitable for the persons, so excellent for the vse, and so conuenient to increase pietie and christianitie in the simpler sort, howsoeuer otherwise with some carping heads, and euill disposed readers, with Aesops dog in the manger neuer giuen either to doo well themselues, or to iudge rightlie and speake truth of others) it is I am right well assured with my God, who first put me in mind to take it in hand, and in, by, and through whom onelie I confesse with humble and hartie thankesgiuing after manie a yeeres fore trauell, in studie much sweet, long watching, and great expences, I haue now at the length finished the same I trust to his glorie, your profit, and mine owne comfort.
Therefore leauing to all and euerie of the woorthie works of other godlie men or women howsoeuer here or elsewhere extant, their particular vse in the church of God, as they were published: and to the honourable authors themselues their due deserued praise and perpetuall commendation to all posteritie, with ex∣hortation to all godlie christians reuerentlie, willinglie, and thankfullie to read, receiue, and imbrace the same, as wherein to the better fulfilling of so heauenlie an exercise of our faith most agreeable to Gods good will and word is perfectlie sup∣plied and accomplished, by the rare gifts, ornaments, and graces of the holie Ghost in the compilers, whatsoeuer otherwise through ignorance, wanteth both in me, and perhaps in you also (good readers) if you be vnlearned. (Giue them therefore, O giue them, I saie, and that woorthilie of the fruit of their owne hands, and let their owne works praise them in all the world.) I to conclude humbly sub∣mit my selfe vnto the graue iudgements of the godlie learned, and mine heroicall authors liuing, of whom I meeklie craue pardon for this my bold enterprise at∣tempted both with bashfulnesse, doubtfulnesse, and feare to become a writer in this so learned an age, or to trouble your studies with my rude labours. And here last∣lie I offer these my labours such as they are vnto the good liking and fauourable correction as well in matter, as in maner of you my right christian learned readers, of whom in full recompense and satisfaction of anie fruit, that either you or the sim∣pler sort shall hereby reape, I onelie now make this request, as dutifullie to reue∣rence the diuine works of so noble and learned authors, by whose holie trauels you perceine your selues to enioie most inestimable benefits: so freendlie to take in good part these first fruits of my poore studies, proceeding from a well meaning

mind, and built vpon so good foundations, as from him that did that hee could though not that he ought to benefit all, and to hurt or offend none. That they be∣ing now as lamps well esteemed of in the opinion of the rich in vertue and know∣ledge, and gratefullie accepted and approoued of the learneder sort, as the monu∣ments of so famous matrones, may yet at the least for their sakes become wel∣come and approoued of all other simple christians, and I by that meanes greatlie incouraged to go forward in vertuous studies for the benefit of my countrie, with hartie thankesgiuing vnto God both for his mercie, and your great curtesie and goodnesse towards me, in whom I bid you farewell, and vnto whose heauenlie de∣fense, almightie protection, diuine fauour, and continuall blessing, I finallie com∣mend and betake both these my labours, my selfe, and you deere and welbeloued readers, beseeching you to loue me, as I loue you vnfainedlie, to speake of me and my worke, no woorse than I doo of you and yours christianlie, and that for his sake alone that loued vs all most deerelie, & in that loue for vs all endured all ma∣ner of reproch and slanders that might be most patientlie, euen to the effusion of his most pretious bloud often and sundrie times trulie, as well in feruent praier as in sweat, and otherwise on the crosse for our eternall glorie: to whom therefore, and for all the inestimable benefits of his bloudie praiers, dririe death, and bitter passion be euermore rendred and giuen as of writers and readers, so of angels, men, and all creatures in heauen, in earth, or in the deepe, all possible praise and perpetuall glo∣rie that hart can thinke, hand can worke, or toong can speake,
Amen.
