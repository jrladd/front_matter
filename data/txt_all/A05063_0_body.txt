A Softe as I remēbre
youre kyndenesse and
beneuolence towarde
me (my singuler good
master) it is harde to
saye, howe greatly I
desyre to recompence the same: lest I
shulde eyther seme vnkynde and vn∣thankefull,
or els not to vnderstande
and perceyue the greatnesse of youre
manifolde benefytes, employed vpōme:
of ye which, as ye one is a signe of
a noughty hert, so the other is a tokē
of a dul wytte: but they be both very
euident argumentes of vnthanke∣fulnesse

and ingratitude. From the
which, as I haue alwayes hytherto
abhorred, so I desyre nowe to be
voyde from all suspicion of the same.
For me thinke, I perceiue euery day
more and more, howe moche shame
and fylthynesse is in that vice, almost
by the testimonie of euery wyse man
in somoche that I thynke hym to tre∣spasse
greatly, agaynst the societie of
this our commune lyfe, which doeth
vnthankefullye receyue benefytes of
any man. For as gratitude or thank∣fulnesse
doeth encrease lyberalitye,
which is the especiall parte of iustice:
so ingratitude dissolueth vtterly, and
abolysheth the same: the which libe∣ralitie,
yf it fall ones in decaye, it ta∣keth
away the cōmutation of offices
and the doing of one for an other, the
which ones taken away, what helpe
I praye you is left to the cōseruation

of ye cōmune wealth, seing yt the hole
course of our lyfe, consysteth in ye so∣cietie
and mutuall doinge one for an
other. Wherfore the wyse kynges of
the Parcians made lawes, for to pu¦nysh
suche as were vnkynde and vn∣thankefull
personnes, bycause they
thought none to be so vnnaturall as
they, nor anye to trespasse more a∣gaynste
the cōmune weale. These &
other suche (myne especial good ma∣ster)
hath caused me to desyre vehe∣mentlye,
to shewe some token of the
pure zeale and loue which I haue e∣uer
borne vnto you, lest I shoulde be
founde vnnaturall, eyther vnto you,
or to this my natiue countrye. Wher¦fore
seinge that fortune hath gyuen
me no rychesse, wherewith I myght
longe yer this haue recōpenced some
parte of your kyndenesse, I thought
mete to offre vnto you, the fyrste fru∣tes

of my studyes and learnynge, ve∣rely
trustynge, that your wysedome
wyll esteme for the best, my loyall
hert, and diligēt endeuour, although
my boke peraduenture shall not sa∣tisfye
your expectation.
