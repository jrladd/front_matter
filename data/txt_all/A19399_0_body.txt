Most Honourable
THe Evangelist S. Luke mentions a qua∣ternion of Souldiers:Act. 12.4. and I a quaterni∣on of Sermons: that is Polemicall, this is Theologicall: And out of this (which the desire of many faithfull ones, & the importunitie of some judicious friends have drawne from me) I have presumed to set forth two, to stand Sentinell before your Honor. The first was naturally yours, for I came from farre to give it: The last is necessarily yours: for you came from farre to take it: Both preached before you, both graced by you, your honourable pre∣sence, your attention: So both are yours, and you are Christs,1. Cor 3.22.23. and Christ is Gods. I confesse they are the two extreamest in this Booke: (for so the order of time required) but he which is Alpha and Omega, the first and the last,Revel. 1.11. no doubt will give a blessing unto them both, in regard that the extreames and the meane, and the maine, and all was intended for his glory. They are my first Infants which the light hath seene: & nature bids me to seeke forth a nourisher: and whom sitter can I finde then him who (under God) was the chiefe cause of their life,Isa. 49.23.
 and is the common nursing Father of this Church. Vouchsafe therefore Right Honourable to reflect upon him vvho desires to expresse his dutie towards you, now by sight as then by speach: especially in a worke that is accompanied with hope of profit and comfort to the Church of God. Even so Right No∣ble Lord: Ride on and prosper with the word of truth and righteousnesse. Keepe open the dores of the Temple and re∣paire it.Nehem. 2.19. Ezra 7.21. Nehem. 2.8. Prevent every Sanballat and Geshem: and let Ezra and Nehemias be gracious in your eyes. Reformation is the worke of the Lord and therefore let not your hands be weake. You have an Hezekiah with you even the strength of God: To him I leave you, and from him I wish you all increase of ho∣nour, with externall, internall, eternall peace.
