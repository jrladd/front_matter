THis Treatise of the Scorby, hath bene a long time prepared for thee, but it wan∣ted a prosperous gale of winde. Perhaps delaye may b some disgrace to it: for earst other Treatises of the same matter haue heere ariued. Surely, others gaine, is not my grief, but I am sory that I cannot also present them to thee. I hope a better furnished leasure and skill wil shortly impart to thee this benefite. In the meane time, haue Wyers paynes, in high price, which are not inferiour to others. Ronsleus and Langius wade in∣to deep difficulties, fitter for a lear∣ned censurer, then a plaine practi∣ser.

Ecthius paynteth out the signes, and poynteth to the cure▪ but affordeth not the pith and ma∣row of speciall medicines: The o∣ther Treatise which is of the can∣ker, was painfully weaued by Tex∣tor: who (in mine opinion) disco∣uereth the deceipt of Penelopes webbe. For the crabbed vlcer cra∣ueth helpe, hut accepteth none, as the matrone euer laboured, neuer ended her worke. Neuerthelesse as her webbe deluded her sutors, and supported the hope of Vlysses re∣turne: So this crooked Caecilius may receiue often ease of payne, though none end of grief. The au∣thours deserue commedacion, the interpreter, desireth friendly accep∣taunce, the Printers discourage, both.
Farewell.
