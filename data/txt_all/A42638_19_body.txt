THis little Treatise mentions the best way for Building of Habita∣tions, the Choice of Surveyours, Clarks of the works, Master-Work-men, and Materials, as likewise the Rates and Prizes of them, and of the Works, even the manner of the East Indians burning of Lime, which could serve your Lord∣ships Builders in St. James-fields (if les Ardennes were near it) to burn more Lime in twenty four hours time, then would be necessary for morter to all that precinct.


As for the rest, your Lordship hath seen abroad, the fairest Palaces, and most compleat habitations, the best contrived Ground-plats, and also most Paradise∣like Gardens, according unto the vari∣ous fancies of their proprietors; the one affecting Houses all of Glasse, to have all men see them; Others their Gardens most like an open field, or like Adam and Eve, when in their State of Inno∣cency; Others with Parters, and Imbro∣deriers for exercise to Gardiners pair of sheers; other covered Walks, Labirinths, open basins for Fountains; others with grots (as at Ruell, and Liancour in France,) with such shades as that Nymphs may not be bereaved of a natural liberty; nor Acteon seen with his curled brow; Infine, that Petrarca his saying, (per tanto variar Natura é bella) might not become out of date, nor may be extinguisht your memory.
