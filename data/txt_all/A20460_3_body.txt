NOble Lord, Themistccles desired the art of obliuion. I the practick of memorie, whose hell and heauen pre∣sentiue facultie cannot produce a fai∣rer forme of eternitie, then in the vnimitable Idea of your Mars borne honourable Father, the best of his fortunes I could wish were traduced to you, and the best of his actions deseruing a fixt constellation, as totally diffused through euery noble veine of your Honour as the best part of your essence is in your bodie the con∣templatiue part of time admits not a fairer prospectiue of Honour. The character of Mars is but his counterseit, and I could wish it yours by adoption, Arts and Armes should be like hypocrates twinnes reciprocall in their first

ingredience, and borne together with a most sweet and lo∣uing sympathie. The merit of a Souldier and a Scholer hates poligamie, and are but one flesh. I know you are no∣bly tutored in the one, and I could wish you Laurcated in the other. The poyson of the times hath no better. Anti∣dote then vertue: the least doze of it makes honor nobly preseruatiue. I haue here prescribed it, and may it worke in you his phisicall operation: my dutie bound to the strick∣test, and most peremptorie remembrance of your Honour: administers this diet: disgest, and be a long liude pa∣tient, it is the Souldiers cordiall, and a Noble restoratiue.
