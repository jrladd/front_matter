ABout Twelve Years since you were pleased freely to make me a Parti∣cipant in both your Societies, to gratifie which Favours I have ever since studied and endeavoured your Services, and at some of our Meetings Considerations being had that it was sit∣ting to make our Societies more publickly known, for the benefit of Lessees and Discoverers of Mines, &c. I resolved to write, and by the En∣couragements of my Honoured Friends Sir Robert Murray and Sir Francis Cobb, and some of the Long Robe, both Common and Civil, and the help of our own Records, I have at last produced this History, wherein I can call nothing my own but the imperfect Method, Style, some few Ob∣servations, and the pleasure I took in find∣ing such a worthy Diversion from Idlenesse.
It is the first Collection extant of this kind, and if I have pleased you herein, and facilitated the way to any future Additions by others, I hope to receive their thanks, and yours, which is all that is expected by

Anno 1670.
