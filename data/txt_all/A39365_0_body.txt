Madam,
THose deep Discourses, which I have so often heard from you, upon the Subject of this Small Book, gave me the Occasion of Composing it: and therefore I thought it my Duty to Dedicate it unto You. In perusing it, you may Conceit, that these few Good Thoughts of mine returne to You, as small brooks and rivulets, to the OCE∣AN, from whence they came: for seriously Ma∣dam, I shall ever Acknowledg that one of the best waies I have found out to improve my Vn∣derstanding in Spirituall Things, has been, the Contemplation of that truly Noble, and Christian

Disposition, which the Giver of every Good, and Perfect Gift has Bestowed on You. Certainly those Vertuous Persons, who have the happynesse to be Acquainted with You, if they peruse this Dis∣course, will imagine it to be no other then Your CHARACTER: Considering what a rare thing that Temper of Mind is, which here I Describe (I Fancy) they would have thought me to have had lōe Acquaintance with You, though I had not Prefixt Your Name. You, Madam, are one of those very few in the world, who, by the strength of true, Sanctified Reason, are able to Apprehend firmely, and constantly these most important Truthes (which scape the Notice of the generality of men) That the things of the World are in themselves altogether Vanity, That GOD is All in All, &c. The Sun of Righteous∣nesse thus Shining into Your Soule, giving you a Cleare, and full demonstration of these Truthes, Scatters those Mists, and Clouds of False Hopes, and Feares, Anxious Desires, and Foolish Imagi∣nations, &c. which continually hang over the Soules of those Persons, (which are by farre the greatest part of the World) that are Earthly, and

Sensuall; Shewing you that the only way to Set your heart at rest, is, to Acquiesce in the Enjoy∣ment of GOD, which you have in part here; and in the Hopes of the fulnesse, and Consum∣mation of it, which you shall have in Heaven hereafter. If I have put you to a Blush (for I know your Nature is such, that you still endea∣vour to Fly the Praises, your Actions (all for) I shall entreat you to consider that by what I have here spoken I did not Principally intend to Praise You, but to Glorifie your MAKER: for, what have you that you have not receiv'd? You know what Vse you are to make of being well spoken of: To Thanke GOD for the Grace he hath given you, and to Pray unto him for more. It may be you will wonder to see me in Print a∣gain, &c. contrary to the Advice of so many of my honor'd Friends: but, seriously, Madam, to speak freely, I have weigh'd all the Reasons, that have been, or (I think) can be produc'd to dis∣svvade me, and I find them too light to Over∣ballance my Resolution in this Designe: vvhere∣in I am sure I can do no man any, harme: but in all probability shall doe some good, in the Ser∣vice

of HIM, whose Favour is the only thing I would Absolutely Desire; whose Displeasure is the onely thing I would Absolutely Avoid: nei∣ther shall I ever charge my selfe, as Guilty of In∣discretion, (which is the great Bugbear, which some men would Fright me withall from such Vndertakings) but when I find that, through the Blindnesse of my Understanding, or the Violence, and Praecipitancy of my Affections, I have Fallen into the one, or have Missed the other. I shall not hold you with any longer discourse Farewell: And may the GOD of all Comfort Love and Embrace you; and wipe off all Teares from your Eyes: may You and I, and all those, whom we are Bound to Pray for, Rest from our Labours, from all doubts, and feares, all trouble, and an∣guish, and disturbance of Spirit, in the Bosome of the Father, through our LORD JESUS CHRIST.
