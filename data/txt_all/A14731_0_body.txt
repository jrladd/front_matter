EVery good name
is as precious oint∣ment;
but vnto
the (oh CHRIST) hath
God giuen a name aboue
all names in heauen and

earth, annoynted thee
with oyle aboue all thy fel∣lowes.
All thy garments
smell of Mirrhe, Aloes,
and Cassia; because of
the sent of thy perfumes,
thy name is a bundle of
Mirrhe, cluster of Cam∣phire,
and as the smell
of Libanus: But wee the
sonnes of men, haue dull
senses stuffed with earth∣ly
sauours. Oh there∣fore
that thou, whom my
soule loueth, wouldest shew

thy seruant, where that
fragrant Spikenard is to
bee found, which will cast
a sauour all ouer thine
house; and helpe him so
to powre some smell por∣tion
thereof vpon thine
head, as might draw vs
in the sauour of thine
oyntment to runne after
thee, Had he all the trea∣sures
and Iewels of the
world, would hee not be∣stowe
them vpon Altars
and Crucifixes to thy ho∣nour,

if thou likedst of
and such seruices? But
these vanities, hee know∣eth
full well, thy Ielousie
abhorreth. This thou hast
shewed him, that hee that
prayseth thee, honoureth
thee. Accept therefore,
and prosper the Office
of him that desireth not
heereby to gaine a name
on earth, who wisheth all
his thoughts and workes
may either honour thee,
or dishonour himselfe;

feed thy flocke, or mothes;
who reckoneth himselfe
vnworthy to bee as one of
thy whelpes, is willing to
bee of no name or num∣ber,
so thou mayest bee
ALL IN ALL.
Guide thou my Pen, and
it shall shew forth thy
praise.
