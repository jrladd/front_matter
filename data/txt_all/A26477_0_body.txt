IT is the manner of men, O heavenly King, to dedicate their Books to some great men, there∣by to have their Works protected and counte∣nanced among men; but thou only art able by thy holy Spirit of Truth to defend thy Truth, and to make it take impression in the heart and un∣derstanding of men: Unto thee alone do I dedicate this Work, intreating thy most High Majesty to grant, That whoever shall open this Book, thy holy Spirit may so pos∣sess their understanding, as that the spirit of errour may de∣part from them, and that they may read, and try thy Truth by the touchstone of thy Truth, the holy Scriptures, and finding that Truth may embrace it, and forsake these dark∣some inventions of Antichrist, that have deluded and defi∣led the Nations now, and in former Ages.
Enlighten the World, thou that art the Light of the World, and let Darkness be no more in the World now, or in any future Age; but make all people to walk as Children of the Light for ever; and destroy Antichrist that hath decei∣ved the Nations, and save us the residue, by thy self alone, and let not Satan any more delude us; for the Truth is thine for ever.
