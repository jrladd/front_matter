MAdame, seeing your sinceritie in religion is such that it makes euery one to admire you, and your loue to such as are truely religious is so great, that it makes them to honour and respect you, and seeing my brother M. Patrik Simson of good memorie, was that happie instrument of God, as a spirituall father to beget your Lady∣ship in Christ Iesus, and hath dedicated all his labours to your Ladyship as the chiefest seale of his ministrie, I could find none so fit as your Ladiship to whom I might dedicate this ensue∣ing
treatease, on the fiue and twentith Psalme, and therefore as a testimonie of my seruice, and duty which I owe vnto your Ladyship, I am bold to present the same to your Ladyships view, beseeching God, that it may redowne to the aduancement of his glorie, and the good of the Church in generall, and of your Ladyship in particular. Thus praying for the increase of your faith, and continuance of your daies, to∣gether with outward and inward blessings to your Ladiship, your noble husband and hopefull posteritie, I rest.
