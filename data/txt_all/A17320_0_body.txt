RIght VVorshipfull
Maecenas, in regard
of the manifolde
fauours, and encou∣ragements,
which I haue recei∣ued
from you, euer since I first
entred into the sacred worke of
the Ministrie, first in Norfolke at

your house by Norwich, where
then you remayned, and many
times since, I doe heere (as dutie
bindeth mee) offer vnto your
VVorshipfull Patronage, this
short Treatise, of the Christians
heauenly Treasure, which shew∣eth
in some sort, the difference
betweene false goods and true
goods, betweene Heauen and
Earth, the riches of the one and
the riches (or penurie rather) of
the other, and the way how to
enioy the one without losse of
the other. Which is not to teach
you any thing that yet you know
not, for God bee praysed you
knew these things long agoe, but

(as S. Peter wrighteth) to con∣firme
& strengthen your godly
minde, and to vphold your holy
Faith, which long since through
the mercy of God shined in you,
accompanied with true loue, the
handmaid of Faith, to the great
glory of God, the ioye of the
godly, and the comfort of the
Saints hearts. This Argument
doth of right belong vnto your
Worship, because the Lord hath
plentifully replenished your hart
with the loue of heauenly things
and true zeale vnto his glory, for
heauenly matters, onely in hea∣uenly
minds and sanctified harts
receiue kind entertainment, like

the Angels in Lots house, reioy∣sing
each in others company &
conference, like Mary and Eliza∣beth,
but they shun the compa∣nie
of the wicked, like the Wise
men, which balked Herods house
& returned another way, when
they vnderstood what a Fox he
was.
The God of all Mercie and
Consolation, who hath made
your old age glorious by crow∣ning
the same with a most con∣stant
loue and sincere profession
of his blessed Truth, so prosper
your holy proceedings and reli∣gious
endeuours; that at the end
of this your earthly pilgrimage,

you may with holy Simeon de∣part
in peace, and receiue with
all Saints, that crowne of im∣mortall
glory, and endlesse rest,
which God hath prepared for
you, and for all those that loue
and desire the glorious appea∣ring
of the Lord Iesus Christ.
From my friends house in Lon∣don,
this 21. of Ianuarie 1607.
