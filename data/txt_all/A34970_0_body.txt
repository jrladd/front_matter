SIR,
It had been to be vvished that
vve might have concealed from
Strangers the Stains of our Na∣tion,
and that they might remain
ignorant that neither Fidelity to
our Prince, nor Charity to our
fellovv-Subjects can secure Ca∣tholicks

from the vvorst effects of
vvar in the midst of Peace:
such is the Virulence of one ma∣lignant
Party: vvho though
they enioy their lives by an un∣merited
Pardon of their Rebel∣lion,
vvill never pardon us for
our Loyalty.
In most Countreyes of Europe
there are agitated dayly Dispu∣tes
and Controversies about Re∣ligion,
and in Books on each side
ordinarily some sharpness is
mingled. But in England our
Lott must be , vve are
forced to contend vvith Adver∣saries
vvhose minds by our late
Tumults are rendred savage
and implacable. They to spite
us, resume a Nevv vvar

against Heaven it self, deriding
and blaspheming the Saints in
Glory. And against Gods
Church on earth they frame Ac∣cusations
never heard of before,
making her greatest Vertues passe
for the directly opposite greatest
Crimes. The most Saintly Exer∣cises
of Persons among us con∣secrated
to God and entirely
subiect to Authority are disgra∣cefully
stiled Fanaticism: Be∣cause
vve vvill not be chusers
each one of his ovvn Faith, vve
are accused to have an Enthusi∣astick
vvay of Religion: vvee
exercise Charity to our Freinds
Deceased, and that is called an
Impediment of Deuotion: vve
teach (as our Saviour did) that

the vvay to Heaven is strait,
and consequently that to enter
into it vve must practise Con∣fession
of Sins, Pennances, Mor∣tifications,
Praying, Fasting,
Alms-giving &c. and for this
vve are charged to be Hinderers
of Piety and a Good Life: Our
acknovvledging an Authority
in Gods Church to end Contro∣versies
is called an effectuall
Mean to multiply them: If out of
Compassion to persons guilty of
Schism, and out of a tender love
to Vnity any one among us
strains his vvitts to persvvade
our Adversaries that the dis∣tance
betvveen us is not so vast
as some of them seem vvilling to
conceive, his recompense must

be contemptuous revilings: No
Pagans or Cannibals must be
esteemed so blindly, so horribly
I dolatrous, No Quakers so ri∣diculously
Frantick, No Fifth-Monarchists
so dangerous both
to Church and State.
These enormous Excesses
vvich have been lately exposed
to the vvorld in a Stile partly
Burlesque and partly Tragicall
vvere never heard of in any o∣ther
Nation but England, and
only of late in England, and
I hope, for the credit of our Na∣tion,
are not taken notice of by
many Strangers living here, and
thereby less in danger to be pub∣lished abroad.
But from you,
SIR, they could not be concea∣led,

since your zeal to Catholick
Religion makes you inquisitive
into all things that concern it,
and your perfect knovvledge in
our Language renders all our
BOOKS as intelligible to you, as
if vvritten in your ovvn. My
hope novv is that you being vvell
acquainted vvith the present
Temper of our Nation, vvill
judge aright, that a Book vvrit∣ten
in such a Stile, and vvholly
composed of malignant Passions
and nevv-invented Calumnies
against Gods Church vvas only
the private Design of a mali∣cious
Brain on purpose to feed
the exulcerated minds of a, ma∣levolent
Party among us, and
consequently not to be imputed

to any other besides. The affe∣ction
you bear to our Nation,
from vvhich you are not quite,
even in blood, a Stranger,
encourages mee to expect thus
much iustice from you.
As for my self, I being,
I hope, not the only person, en∣gaged
in the defence of Truth
and Innocence against Malice
and Calumny, am desirous
to address to you this my Ans∣vver,
as a Testimony of my
gratefull resentment of the fa∣vour
and honour you have been
pleased to conferr generously on
mee, in allovving mee a share
in your freindship: the com∣fortable
effects vvhereof have

likevvise been extended to an
afflicted Community abroad,
recommended by mee to your
Protection.
But besides this, a far
greater obligation both my self
and all loyall English Sub∣jects
have to honour you for
your constant respect, duty,
and assistance vvhich you have
allvvayes vvith great zeale
shevved to his Sacred Ma∣jesty
and his cause, vvhen he
vvas inhumanly treated by the
same Party, vvhich novv so
inhumanly treats his Faithfull
Catholick Subjects. In vvhich
fatall Conjuncture also, his
banished freinds and servants

found in your house Hospita∣lity
and kindness vvhich vvith
them had been banished out of
England. I beseech you, SIR,
accept this Address as a gage
of gratitude, honour and res∣pect
from,
SIR,
