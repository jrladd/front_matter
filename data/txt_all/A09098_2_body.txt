IT may be objected unto me, that the collation of these things, is not all made up and digest∣ed into this fabrique of mine owne materials and structure, and I do ingeniously confesse it: Seeing the foure Treasuries were collected by M. Agard, his private notes, a man very industrious and painefull in that kinde; and one, who had con∣tinuall recourse unto the most, and custody of many of the rest of the same: And the latter Callender of the Records of the Tower, came to my hands from an Author unknown, even as the printer was draw∣ing the last sheete of the precedent worke from the presse, I was content to give it wharsage, and to let it be laid on shore with the rest, but very unwilling∣ly; because, I had no convenieut roome left where to dispose it, without blaming of my Methode, in that it was not said in his proper place, with the rest that is under the Title of the Tower, in the first Station: whereof I hope an equall censure, ever resting.
Sub rostro Cyconiè.
