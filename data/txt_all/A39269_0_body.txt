My most Noble Lord and Patron.
May it please your EXCELLENCY,
THe Duty which I owe, first unto GOD, as his Mi∣nister, then to my SOVERAIGN, as his Subject, and in the next place to Your EXCEL∣LENCY,

as Your Domestick Chap∣lain, made the threefold cord where∣by I found my self indispensibly obliged, to contribute that little I was able, towards the Solemnity of that memorable and happyest Day, which this poor Kingdome hath in many yeares beheld. And having, after my weak manner, preach'd this plain and short Sermon, which had then Your Excellency's approbation, and (I hope) since GOD's pardon for my failings there∣in; I had very well satisfied my self; as I shall alwayes have great reason to doe, when by serving GOD, I can please Your EXCEL∣LENCY. I confesse, I then understood no obligation that lay

upon me to doe, what now I am commanded to doe, to preach it o∣ver again this Second time to the VVorld; beeing (I blesse GOD for it) yet uninfected with that ambitious itch of making my self known abroad, and loving to be gazed upon, as some-body by the Multitude. 'Tis very fitt that they, and onely they, should wear great names, who have great meritts to support them; and that they alone should be permitted to praesent their labours to the publike eye, whose great abilities, by being so made manifest, may become more instrumentall to the publike Good: But (My LORD) Your HO∣NOUR seem'd very well to un∣derstand

the' extent of that Talent wherewith GOD hath intrusted mee, when You presented mee to the charge of my little Flock in the Country; but too much to value it, when You committed to mee that other of Your Family: being thus en∣tertain'd and employ'd, I need not seek abroad for more worke or more honour: and therefore (My LORD) that I now expose this rude piece, & my selfe with it, to the forward cen∣sures of all that see it, it is a piece of meer Obedience to Your EXCEL∣LENCYS expresse, and indeed, importunate Commands: I alwayes resolving, soe farre as they are Iust (and I know they will ever be most exactly so) rather to suffer by them, then to disobey them.

I have often heard Your EX∣CELLENCY, and My Lord, (would it signifie any thing to say what pleased mee) I would say, with much pleasure I have hearken'd to You, discoursing of that satisfa∣ction You reap'd, from that sweet privacy and retirement his MA∣IESTY is pleased to grant Your LORD-SHIP here in the Coun∣try, where You live free from the Noise and Cumbrance of Court and Citty. Indeed, the greatest reward his MAIESTY can possibly re∣compense Your matchlesse services withall, is thus to bestow YOUR-SELF upon YOUR-SELF; and I know You think it greater hap∣pinesse to enjoy My LORD

MARQVIS of NEW CASTLE at WELBECK, then all the Offi∣ces and Honours which your exem∣plary Loyalty has meritted: And there's all the reason in the VVorld for it, that Hee who hath so Nobly sacrificed the Fairest of his Yeares, and the Amplest of his Revenues, to the service of his King and Country, should now have leave to Conse∣crate the remainder to his Health and Quiet. My LORD, could I ever hope to merit of Your EX∣CELLENCY, I would not yet leave begging a Favour of the same kind; that, as I have an Ho∣nourable place in Your Family, so I might live retiredly from all the world besides. But seeing. (My

LORD) Your commands lye so heavy upon me, I will endeavour to bear them with the best strength I have, and still incourage my selfe with this confidence, that it is all one with Your EXCELLENCY to Command and Patronize: And therefore after others have served in their solemne joyes, with all be∣coming State and Magnificence, I hope I may (atleast) obtaine a par∣don, If I make bold to drop in, in the Rear, and offer too my poor dish of cold water in the name of a Disciple. Many, 'tis true, goe before mee, and it is very fit they should; Others come with richer cloathing, and finer language, and why not? They that weare soft rayment, and they that speak

soft words too, are in Kings houses. It is the great freedome Your EXCEL∣LENCY is pleas'd to indulge me, to speak mine owne sense in mine own words, fully and freely; and I am so much the servant of my greatest Master, that I greedily embrace all the Liberty can be granted mee in this kind. If there be any thing in this short Discourse, disrelishing to the palates of those that read it; it will be enough for mee to tel them, it is a Sermon, and therefore not pur∣posely suited to any man's humour: and yet, I will adde; it hath passed Your EXCELLENCY'S ap∣probation, and that will be enough to answer whatever may be obje∣cted against it. Let men say what

they will, I have abundantly satis∣fied my selfe, by praying that all, even they that dispise it (if it be pos∣sible) may be better'd by it; and in taking this opportunity of expres∣sing my selfe, by this, as by all ho∣nest meanes, I shall alwayes labour to doe, My LORD,
