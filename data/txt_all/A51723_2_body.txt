Most Reverend Father,
I Dedicated my Alcibiades to King Philip the fourth: I now dedicate Coriolanus to your most reverend Fatherhood. What a happinesse do I enjoy, to have the greatest Monarch of the world to be my Master: And the greatest wit, and most sublime understanding to my Nephew. If these two lines, which adorn my Wri∣tings, were but graven upon my Tomb∣stone, they would fully satisfie my ambi∣tion, namely, HERE LIETH THE SERVANT TO KING PHI∣LIP, AND UNCLE TO FA∣THER

PALAVICINE. The goer by would therein read the hap∣pinesse of my birth, and the worthi∣nesse of my choyce. And how can these my Writings be but secure, protected by the greatest worldly power, and defen∣ded by the greatest learning? I beleeve my affinity will not derogate from mine attestation, in witnessing that which your workes have manifested to the world. I would (I had almost said) renounce my kindred, rather than betray my judge∣ment; and leave being an Uncle, rather than to not be a Trumpet of the eminen∣cy of your understanding, and most rare∣ly singular qualities. I would beseech your most reverend Paternity, to esteeme of that in mee, which is none of mine; namely, your being my Nephew, and I in the mean time, will glory to have ad∣ded the Title of Servant to the Chara∣cter of Ʋncle. So, affectionately kissing your hands, I rest,

 Bononia April 2. 1648.
