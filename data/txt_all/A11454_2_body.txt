GOod Madame; It is not so much the kinde respect, which you haue for many yeares past continually manifested towards me, (although that might iustly challenge from mee a farre more ample acknowledgement;) that hath in∣duced mee to present you with these three Ser∣mons: as your vnfained loue to Gods truth and Gospell, together with your religious care, by a holy and vertuous conuersation, both to strengthen your owne assurances for the hopes of the life to come; and to prouoke those that are sprung from you, or liue vnder you, by the strength of your example, to presse so

much the harder towards the same glorious marke, by the same gracious courses. To the encreasing of which Loue and Care, either in you, or yours, or in any other into whose hands they may chance to come, if these poore Meditations shall adde any furtherance: I shall haue the lesse cause, either to blame the importunitie of those that haue long vrged, or to regard the censures of those that shall now mislike, the publishing of them. The God of power, and of peace, make them profitable to his Church; and preserue your spirit, and soule, and body, blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ.

Boothby Paynell Linc. 9. Aprill 1627.
