Gentlemen,
AS I doubt not, on one side, but this Title comprehends, in reality, a most numerous and powerful Party, and am proud and full of con∣fidence having put my self under your Protection, —Cornua sumo; so on the other side I lose much of my assurance, when I consider that it is to destroy the very being of your happy condition, to imagine that any of you will think your selves concern'd in this Dedication, since that very thought would make you really cease to be so, and rank you in another herd amongst the Jealous and Suspici∣ous, to whom I do not apply my self. It is to you (Gentlemen) I speak, who are sure you are not spoken to; It is to you only our resolute Don Ga∣briel submits himself, though at the same time like a blunt Souldier, as he is, he tells you, that even to you he yields in nothing but his Fortune, which it seems, was as obstinately bent to force upon him the knowledge of that fatal secret, as he was to a∣void it; and though he confesses he was guilty of much weakness in permitting himself to be carried away by the importunity of Don Fernand, even so far as to watch the actions of his Wife (a horrid sin in it self) yet he desires you to believe that even in that action he never consented to any thought that suggested to him the least doubt of her Virtue, but Arm'd his Soul with a strong contempt of Don Fernand's Jealous Humour; In fine, he had still been as Happy as any of you, had not his unkind Destiny peevishly forced upon him that secret which

your kinder Fates so carefully keep from you, dou∣bly kind indeed, since they both take from you the knowledge of a reality which would destroy your Happiness, and with the Idea of an imaginary thing (your Wives Virtue) no where existent but in your own Brains, make you really Happy? Here he submits and acknowledges the advantages your favourable stars have given you over him; he adores that Heaven of Happiness from which he is fallen, and instead of giving thanks to his officious Friend Don Fernand, or others, who had contributed to Awake him out of his Golden Dream of Security, he cries out with the Grecian in Horace,
—pol me occidistis amici
Non servastis—
Don Fernand on the other side, though he stands in need of Friends, deserves no Favour from you: A Jealous Mad Man; he swears you are all Cuc∣kolds, but believe him not; believe him, said I? You know he lies: Poor envious Cuckold, he would disturb the quiet security of your thoughts, and use you as he has done Don Gabriel; but hearken not to him, and if ever you fall into Don Gabriel's Misfortune of knowing what you would not know, let it never be justly objected to you that you did in the least contribute to your own unhapppiness, but confirm your Hearts in your just contempt of those miserable Wretches, of whom it is so fitly said, that I need not name my Author,
Rather then not be knowing, they will know,
What being known creates their certain Woe.
This is the Advice of the brave Souldier Don Gabriel, who has been try'd in both Fortunes; And this is highly recommended to you by him, who as much as any one, desires the continuance of your happy ignorance.
