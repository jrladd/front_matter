Right Honourable, Reverend, and Worthy;
IT is not from any Opinion that the Author has of him∣self, or what he can do, that he presumes upon such a Dedication; but only as a true Son of the Church of Scotland, he finds himself oblig'd to espouse her Cause, and obviate the false Calumnies which those of our own Na∣tion do so industriously spread Abroad; not only to the Dis∣paragement of your Government and Discipline, but even of your Doctrine and Morals: And therefore he begs, that what is well design'd, may not be ill taken, but that you would be pleased to accept of these weak Indeavours, as a Testimony of his Zeal and Affection for his Mother-Church, with that same Benignity that that Great Prince accepted of the poor Man's handful of Water which was offered him, amongst a Crowd of more valuable Presents. He is sensible, that neither the Matter nor the Manner deserve the Patronage of such a grave Assembly, but he hopes that you may thence be convinc'd, of the Necessity there is, that you should take such Measures as your Wisdom shall sug∣gest, to provide Antidotes for those poysonous Libels

which fly abroad here against you, in such Numbers, by the United Endeavours of your Enemies. You cannot readily imagine how much you lose by a Neglect herein, and it's not easy to express the Grief of your Well-wishers, to hear the Church of Scotland made the Song of the Drunkard; and the Ridiculous blasphemous Stories printed here against Her, to be the common Entertainment of Debauchees, who triumph in all publick Places over your silence. May the great Shepherd of his Church, whose Servants you are, inspire you with such Counsels, that as the Church of Scotland had formerly Nomen inter caeteras Celebre, upon the Ac∣count of her singular Unity; She may also be famous in Time to come, clear as the Sun, fair as the Moon, and terrible like an Army with Banners, to the Con∣viction of all those who oppose her, upon the Account of the Purity of her Doctrine, and Strictness of her Discipline. And blessed be God, who has not left her without this Testi∣mony, that her greatest and most avow'd Enemies are ge∣nerally the most Vicious and debauch'd, and visibly embark'd with an Interest altogether destructive to the Protestant Religion, and the common Liberties of Europe.
