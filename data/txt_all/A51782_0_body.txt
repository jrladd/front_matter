AMong the several varie∣ties produced by this Age, wherein almost every man endeavoureth in his own way the ma∣nagement of his particu∣lar Affair, I come, Athenian-like, with an Aliquid Novi (as I suppose) in my hand. I cannot be so vain to imagine that there is any Circle, Star, or Meteor in the Sphere of the Law, but what you are exquisitely able to make the world know, you can
take the heighth of, and to discover its proper or Excentrical Motion. To the candor therefore of so great and learned a Judgment, I could not but offer this small Essay: which though in it self not able to draw aside your eye to glance on ir, yet happily to the generality it may prove in some measure helpful and advantagious. And though the meanness of the gift may not merit your acceptance, yet your good∣ness I hope will over-balance the same; and thereby give encouragement to him who desires to approve himself,
SIR, 
Mid. Temp. Nov. 20. 1662.
