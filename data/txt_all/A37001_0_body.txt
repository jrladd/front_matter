MY LORD,
I Should be very ungrateful
for the many extraordinary
Favors, which Your Lord∣ship
has often shower'd upon me,
if I omitted studying all man∣ner
of ways to lay my Faithful
Acknowledgments at Your Feet,
who have so often been pleas∣ed
to honor me with Your Con∣versation,
and several of the
following Poems with Your Al∣lowance,

and Applause: And
since a POET can no better
way express his Gratitude, than
by an humble Address and De∣dication
of his Endeavors, be
pleased, My Lord, to accept this
Book, as a Tribute due to un∣common
Merit; and as an Of∣fering
of Thanks, for the Value
Your Lordship is pleased to set
on POETRY in General.
My Lord, You not only Grace
and Dignifie my unworthy Poems
by Your Noble Patronage, but
are an Honor to the Age You
live in, by shewing such an Ex∣ample;
the Love and Inclina∣tion
You have to Wit and In∣genuity,
sufficiently demonstra∣ting

your Own Worth, for since
nothing can more Illustrate a
Young Nobleman, than Arts
and Sciences; You have taken
the securest way by Encourag∣ing
them to declare your Heart
is not set upon the Vanities of
the World, so much, as to slight
or neglect the more solid Trea∣sures
of the Soul, Knowledge
and Learning.
Your Observations also in
your Travels, have given you
a greater Estimate than others
have acquired of the same Rank,
you have brought home more
than your Self again, Embellish∣ments
of Languages, together
with a Survey of the Manners

and Customs of the People, and
not like that raw empty-headed
Tribe, of whom a famous Antique
Author Writes thus,
—A Sordid Crew,
Who when they Travail to become rare Men,
Return Improv'd with a new foppish Suit,
Their Brains lie with their Taylor's, and get fancies
To play the Fool next day in; he's sole Heir,
To all the moral Vertues, that first greets
The light with a new Fashion, which becomes 'em
Like Monkies, cover'd with the Garbs of Men.
Your Lordship has likewise
been at Rome, without daubing
your Self with her Rag of Super∣stition,
or letting your Judgment
be impos'd upon by the Adul∣terated
Sophistry of Priests and
Jesuits: In a Word, My Lord,

you have begun your Race so
well, that it would appear di∣rect
Malice or Stupidity in any
one to doubt proceedings an∣swerable
through your Course of
Life to come.
I must beseech your Lordship
not to let a decent Encomium sound
harshly in your Ear, nor think
these Assertions flattery, and on∣ly
natural to Dedications, which
are really the just effect of your
own Merit, and of my Obser∣vation
of you, your obliging and
easie Temper, affable and unaffe∣cted
Behavior, endearing all that
have the honor to know ye as
well as my self, the Continu∣ance
of which Happiness, and

the speedy crowning of your
Years to come with blessings, in
the possession of a Noble and
Beautiful Partner, shall be the
greatest Joy and Satisfaction ima∣ginable
to,
My Lord,
