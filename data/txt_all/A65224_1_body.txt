LEt Poets pray the Gods their wit t' inspire,
My holy Flames are kindled by thy fire,
My Muse drinks at thy Fountain, thou alone
To me Parnassus art and Helicon;
And though that some would dam up all thy streams,
And with their new lights put out thy old beams,
Yet I shall pray, and hope Heaven will me hear,
That thy light still may shine, thy Spring run clearâ–ª
I tender thee this slender offering,
Wishing that I a better had to bring;
But what it wants either of wit or Art,
To make it up, I here present my Heart.
