Madame,
PSaphon having assem∣bled several Birds, taught them to pronounce these words; Psaphon is a God! and afterwards setting them at liberty, (by the rehearsal of their lesson) they did spread their masters glory through∣out all the Vniverse.

These ever to be admired Women (being revived) have learned your Honours name; and as all the world did en∣vy the glory of their fame, so will they now invite all men to admire your perfecti∣ons, they will say that few Nations or Ages have yeelded your equal, that to your know∣ing Judgement all learned men have recourse, and that your matchlesse wisdome will be an example of admiration to all posterity.
May all men blazon your eminent deserts! may your most vertuous minde enjoy what it most desires or de∣serves! and may Heaven powr down upon your Honour the dews of thousand Celestial
blessings together with all true happinesse, are the zealous wishes of him who is
Madam,
