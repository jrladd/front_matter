RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
WHiles I desired to congratu∣late your happy Returne with some worthy present; I fel vpon this: which I dare not only offer, but commend; the royal∣lest Philosopher and wisest king, giuing you those precepts, which the Spirit of God gaue him. The matter is all his;

nothing is mine, but the methode; which I doe willingly submit to censure. In that he could not erre: In this, I cannot but haue erred; either in art, or applica∣tion, or sense, or disorder, or defect: yet not wilfully. I haue meant it well, and faithfully to the Church of God, & to your Honor, as one of her great hopes. If any man shall cauill that I haue gone about to correct Salomons order, or to controule Ezekias seruants: I com∣plaine both of his charity, and wisdom; and appeale more lawefull iudgement: Let him aswell say, that euery Concor∣dance peruerts the Text. I haue only en∣deuoured to be the common-place-booke of that great king, and to referre his diuine rules to their heads, for more ease of finding, for better memory, for readi∣er vse. See, how that God, whose wisdom thought good to bereaue mankinde of Salomons profounde commentaries of Nature, hath reserued these his diuine Morals, to out-liue the world; as know∣ing,

that those would but feed mans cu∣riositie, these would both direct his life, and iudge it. Hee hath not done this without expectation of our good, and glory to himselfe: which if wee answere, the gaine is ours. I know how little need there is, either to intreat your Lo: ac∣ceptation, or to aduise your vse. It is enough to haue humbly presented them to your hands; and through them to the Church: the desire of whose good, is my good; yea, my recompence and glory. The same God, whose hand hath led and returned you in safetie, from all for∣raine euils: guide your wayes at home, & gratiously increase you in the ground of all true honor; Goodnesse. My praiers shall euer follow you:
