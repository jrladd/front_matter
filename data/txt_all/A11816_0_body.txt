Honourable Sir:
I Doe present to your view a small frame of the world, and of the Crea∣tures therein contained, drawne with the Pen∣silles of iudicious Scribon, and of D. W. A worke in nature not unlike to our Survayes in Ireland, that represent most lively, vaste Countries within a small Map. I offer this to you, ha∣ving heretofore given to you an account of
 those services that I have lately done in the survey of Ireland, you being Survayor Gene∣rall of that kingdome, wherein I have spent the most part of thirty yeares, in the service of my Prince and Country, Tam Marte, quam Mercurio, both by Pike and Pen, with great toyle, much hazard, and many hurts; but lit∣tle profit. Notwithstanding, your demerits and worth be such, as Gratitude hath chosen your Patronage: and Devotion wisheth all honour, health, and happinesse to you, to my good Lady, and to yours,
