SIR,
HAving beene much troubled (even to restlesness) in my thoughts, about the tender and dangerous distractions of these times, I have oft and ear∣nestly besought Almighty God in my prayers, that he would so assist mee with his spirit, that I might honestly set my selfe to seeke the truth, so seeking might find it, and finding it might cheerfully embrace it, and constantly cleave unto it, in what case or danger soever I should finde it. To this end I tasked my selfe to the saddest and severest Meditations my weake body and Intellectuals could undergo: which being (I trust by the guidance of GOD) resolved into these ensuing Hypotheses, I commit to your judicious and most impartiall cen∣sure; being not so fond of my own fancies, but that I can endure to see them stript naked, and if they prove not the issues of Truth, to disinherit them from ever having further possession of my thoughts. I see not many things, and heare not all; living so re∣mote from any Town where the Tyde of Books and reports flows in. Some Pamphlets there are walking about with as much confidence (and finding as good entertainment) as Truth it self needeth, and with a great deale lesse modesty then that useth to doe: Pleas, Appeals, Reasons, &c. which beg the questions I looked they should prove, and left mee more unsa∣tisfied (rather) then they found mee. I have hitherto (perhaps through fondnesse) more contentment from these conceptions of my owne, which I entreat you to examine with all faithfulness and severity: as knowing that you cannot doe your self or me any greater injury, then to flatter me in falshood; who am come (praised be God) so far towards wisdome, as heartily to thank him who rebukes me in love, and lovingly to honour him who refutes me with reason.
