The
blessed cō∣pany
of
holy ones,
that hou∣should
of faith, that

Spouse of Christ, and
Church of the liuing God
(which is the pillar and
ground of all truth) is so
grieuously gastered, and
so continually infested
with hellish Athisme, mis∣led
Papisme, and misper∣swaded
Separaisme, espe∣cially
in these last & worst
ages of the world, that had
not God of his exuberant
mercies, set vp your High∣nesse
among vs, for a bles∣sing,
as another Ioshua to
succeede Moses, and as an∣other
Solomon, to sit vpon
the throne of Dauid, to the
supportatiō of the Church
of England. It is verily be∣leeued
of many wise, and
iuditious, that the doctri∣nall
principles of Christi∣an
Religion, had not onely

beene sore-shaken with∣in
your Maiesties Realmes
(as they are to the hearts-griefe
of many thousands
among your bordering
neighbours) but also a
most wofull and lamenta∣ble
distraction,Witnesse the Remon¦strants mon¦strous opi∣nions in West-Freezeland▪ and open
diuision, would before this
time haue broken forth to
to the vtter ruine, and ra∣zing
of the verie foundati∣ons
of the blessed peace,
and established discipline
of the church, within these
your Maiesties Territo∣ries.
But magnified for e∣uer
be our God, who hath
remembred vs in mercy,
and hath directed your
Maiesties royall and en∣larged
heart, not onely to
take care of things, Quae

sunt ante pedes: but also,
amidst other your Highnes
many and manifold cares
of your most Christian go∣uernment,
longe prospicere,
as to haue an eye what
manner of growth your
Seminaries of Marchants
haue beyond the Seas, at
Hamborough, Middlebo∣rough,
and other places; for
asmuch as they are the men
in all likelyhoode, who are
to bee of your Maiesties
great Chamber, the Citie
of London, and to sit neere
about the Sterne in future
ages.
Therefore (most dread
Souraigne) It beeing al∣most
a whole year sithence
I was by the worthy and
auncient Companie of
Merchant-Aduenturers e∣lected

and by the most re∣uerend
Archbishoppe of
Canterbury allowed to be
Pastor of the English
Church at Hamborough. I
thought it my bounden
duty before I departed, and
in some part of recom∣pence
for my long stay to
leaue behinde mee a to∣ken
of that seruice, oser∣uance,
duty, loue, and al∣leagiace,
which I owe vn∣to
your Maiestie, and vnto
the Church of England,
wheresoeuer the Lord di∣poseh
of me.
The doctrine and dis∣cipline
of which Church, I
shall endeauour to main∣taine
(pro modulo meo) euen
to my last breath, & think
my selfe an happy mn, to
bee the sonne of so famous

and Christian a Catholike
Church. Some of the com∣pilers
of whose deuout Le∣tugie
haue shed their
bloud for the testimony of
the Lord Iesus, which
bloud I haue alwayes
thought to bee the best
bloud in the world.Bonus san∣guis non mentitur. A
measure of which modell
of mine, I here humbly
prostrate at your Highnes
feet, heartily beseeching
Almighiy God to preserue
your Highnesse, and your
most royal seede, to be glo∣rious
instruments of his
Church, & to crown your
Maiesty, and your Princely
Progenie with his sauing
mercies in Christ Iesus.
