THE blesed aposttle saynte Paule, in y• xx. chapiter of the actys, callynge to∣gether all the seny∣ours or prestes, at a place and towne called Myletum, dyd spe¦ake vnto thē after this maner Take ye hede to your selfs, & to a the flock, ouer the which, the holly gost hath

put you ouer seers to feade the congregation of god, which he purchasyd with his owne blood for I know this wel, that after my departynge, shall enter in greuous wolfes a monge you, which shall not spare the flock. And euen of your selfes, shall a ryse mē speakyng peruerse thin ges, to drawe dyscyples after them etc. Here, most myghtye prynce, dyd that chosē & elected vessell of god, describe most liue¦ly, the wicked and peruerse na∣ture, of false & seditious hery∣tyckes, that studye for nowght elles, but to deuid and seperate the churche, to gette vnto them disciples, to scater & dissipate the flocke of y• most bountuous sheaperde Iesu christe, to sowe discorde, & teach peruerse thin¦ges, etc. Which thynge truely,

dyd chaunce in the primatyue churche, euen in the tymes of y• a postelles, to the great hynde∣rance, and let of the gosspell of Christe, for where so euer, the apostells and dysciples of oure sauyour, had preachyd y• kyng∣dome of god, and with greate peane and labour, had brough: the people, from theyr supersty¦tious, and vngodly wayes, in to the waye of the truthe: there dyd breake in certayne false prophetes, and false a postelles also, with there peruerse and hypocriticall doctryne, subuer∣tynge the myndes of them, that wt ioyfull hartes, had receyued the glade tidynges of saluatin̄ & delyueraunce. These ar they y• for their bealies sake, dyd, as a stormy & wyndy tēpest, trouble y• peace & vnite of y• church sekīg

their owne glori and promotiō, imagynyng alwaies myscheffe, in their hartes, how thei coulde gette vnto them selfs, by theyr pestiferous blandiloquēce, and venymed flatterynge tonges, moste shamefully and vntruly, preferryng them selfs, vnto the true a postlles and discyples of our lorde) a perpetuall name & memorye, Agaynst them dyd y• apostelles, and speacially saynt Paule (whome we maye right well call the standard bearer, of our Chrysten religion) wrytte very ernestly, callyng them an∣tichristes, false prophetes and pseudoapostills, callyng them euell workmen, enemyes of the crosse and passion of christ, as it appereth more euydently in the actys and in the epystylls, that they haue wrytten and sent to

sondrye and many churches, to arme and fense y• flock of christ, agaynst such rauenyng wolfs. Yet not wtstondynge after the departyng of the a postells, that is to saye, after y• god had done hys blessed wyll wt them accor∣dynge to the commen course of nature: these false prophetes, dyd so preualle agaynst the true doctryne of christ, y• in a maner these xii. hunderd yeares, fewe or none durst speake the truthe. For as soone as any man, by y• inspiration and gyft of the holy gost, dyd begyne in those dayes, to preache the gosspell, purely & sincerely, to the great glorye of god and edyfyeng of the church, defending with the swerd of the spiritee, that libertee and frye∣dome, that christ with hys pre∣cyous bloode hath purchassyd

vnto vs (dyd not these hypo∣crites, bryng all the world in to thraldome, puttyng vpō christē menes neckes heauear urdēs of humayne traditious and ceremoniall dreames, thā euer dyd the Iues beare? whiche as saynt Augustyne sayth, though they knew not the tyme of liber tye, yet not wtstandyng war lo∣did and burdoned not with mēs presumptions, but with ye bur∣dens of the law onely?) by and by was he, as a false heriticke, or as he that hath kyllyd bothe father, and mother, most cruely put to death. In so muche that the yearthly prynces, whome, with theyr abhomynabyll dyss∣cimulation, they had gotten on theyr sede, blyndynge and poy∣seynynge them most subtillye & craftely, with the golden cuppe

of ye purplyd hore of Babylone, thought, that they dyd a greate sacryfyce vnto god, whan, with all the tirannye that coulde be, for these belys sake, murthered, and persequuted them, whome god had chosē and sent, to shewe vnto them, the waye of truthe & saluation. But blessed be that bontuous lorde, which hath not suffered the prynces, whome by hys diuine prouidence, he hath made & ordoned, to be supreme gouernors of hys church, imme¦dyatly vnder hym (though by y• tyrannicall power of those false prophetes, & antichristes, they ware put, by that superyorytye a greate whyle) to erre and bee deceued any lōger, but dyd most mercyfull opē their eyes to loke vpon that comfortable sonne of ryghtuosnes, and lyght of the

truthe, y• they myghte, in these thyk darkenessys of thys wret∣ched worlde, be gydes vnto hys people, to bryng them out of the egypte of ignorannycye, and so leade them through y• parylous desertes, into y• land of promis∣cion. For the which thynges, we are all greatly bounde, to gyue dayly, and hourley, immortall thāckes vnto god, and specially that, of hys bountuous, & mere goodnes he hath gyuen vnto vs such of noble & coragious prince which now in his tender years, is so delegentli brought vp, ī all godlynes & vertuous learning, that he hereafter, as a nobyll Salomon, shall wt all prudence and godly wysdome, not onely shed the blode of them that dyd shede the innocent bloode, but also, buylde vp, myghtely, the

temple of the liuing god. Which thyng, as dauyd in y• olde lawe, so nowe oure moste vyctoryus prynce. Henrye the eyghte, the father of this, oure sofuerayne lorde kyng Edwarde the syxte, wolde had done, if god had not dysposed otherwyse, with hym. But thanckes be to god, that he hath so well, prepared all thyn∣ges, before hys death, and that he hath wt y• tow edgged sworde of the spiritee, cutted a waye alredy, the bushes, thornes and brembles, that shuld had letted the buyldyng of the temple, ma∣kyng the ground euen, by abba∣tynge the pryde of these false a posteles, and puttyng awaye, by litell and litell the rubbyshe, of vngodly traditions and vayne ceremonis. Which thyng wyl be no, smal spurre, vnto our most

sofuerayne lord, kyng Edward the syxt, to performe and bryng to prosperous, and ioyfull ende, that, which hys louyng father, hath begonne, so godly. And I doubte not, but now (god wyll∣ynge, who neuer for saketh hys true, and faythfull seruantes, though, to trye theyr fayth, for a tyme and season, suffereth thē to be persequuted) all thynges shall be done to y•, glory of god, and greate conforte of ye louing subiectes, of thys noble and flo∣ryshyng realme. Among whom (as we may, easely prceyue, by theyr dylygent and greadye comyng to the churches, whan they heare of any sermon, and preachyng) is fallē now a great hunger and thrist, not of thys materyall breaed, and drincke, but of the lyuely worde of god.

But alas in stede, of y• heauēly breade, y• feadeth to euerlasting lyfe, they be deluded wt blind & dome ceremones. Which thing, I trust, not lōg shal cōtynew in christes churche, where ye word of god, onely should reygne, and wtout y• which, purely & sincerly preached, is no church but a dē of theues. Excepte I saye these, vanytes, and pestyferous inue∣tions of men: be vtterly bānysh∣ed a waye it is more lyke the carnall temple of the Iues (in whose Synagoges Moyses, & the prophetes war reade euery Sabothe daye, without fayle) than the church of christe. But now, sith that it hath pleased god (whoe lokynge mercyfully vpon the affliction of his people hath sent the  myghtye deli∣uerer) to enhaunce, and make

your grace, not onely hygh pro∣tector & defendour of this noble contrey of England, but also a faithfull ouerseer, of y• buylding of this spirituall temple, which is the church of the lyuyng god, that, with hys precious bloode, he dyd washe, from all spote, blote, and macule, to tryūphe with hym euerlastyng lyfe, in hys heauenly kyngdome, and y• towarde the same buyldyng, as in the olde lawe, towarde the settyng vp of y• tabernacle some men dyd offer gold, some syluer, some precyous stones, some a gayne dyd offer purple, scarlet, and sylkes: I thoughte accor∣dyng, to my pouer abylytye, be cause I coulde, offer none, of y• aboue reherced thyngs to offer at lest, either some vyle gotes: skynes, or some ledde, to couer

thys spirituall temple, and to keape, the rayne, and foule wea∣ther, frome that gorgyous and goodly ornamentes, that other men, accordyng to their ryche, & pregnant wytts haue abun∣dantly offered. It is so, that otherwhyles, for lacke of good couerture, many fayre, & goodli places, well & gorgyously trym med wtin, and decked plesantly, with gold, asure, and precious stones, doo fall in shorte space, in to great dekaye, by reason of the rayne y• falleth in. Lykwyse yf a remydye, be not prouyded, that the churche of god, and ce∣lestyall Ierusalem (whiche is now almost buyldyd vp agayn, and through reparated, by our godly Nehemias) may be fēsed, against y• tempestuous heresis of the Anabaptistes (whyche,

where soeuer the truthe dothe spryng, and begynneth to come a brode, do breake in, infectyng the myndes, of ye rude and sym∣ple people, with pernitious & detestable opiniōs) surely ther¦of, as afore of the doctryne of ye papistes great cōueniētes must neades folow. Many townes & cytyes, in Germany and in the Sussynres lande, where, the word of god dyd florish goodly affore, ware cleane subuertyd by thys abhomynable secte. of ye Catababtistys (for they ware called anabaptistys, because yt they ware autors of rebaptiza∣tion, or babtizyng agayne, and Catabaptistys, because, yt they dyd speake and hold oppynyon, agaynst the baptime of childrē) in so muche, yt they had almoste extynguysshed the gosspell ther

as it is more euydently shewed, in ye workes of certain famous clerkes of Germanie & Heluetia Whiche incomoditie and hurte, that it maye not chan̄ce hereaf∣ter, in this illustre & victorius realme of England: I haue ac∣cordyng to my small learnyng, enterprised, to translate out of latin, in to englyshe a litell trea∣tie, that ye famous clerke Henry Bullinger, hathe afore wrytten in the Germanysh tongue, and after, was translatid into latin by Leo Inde, byshope of Tigure agaynste the pestiferous venime of the Anababtistes. Wherein the false and pernicious oppini∣ons of these antichristes, are so clerkely both by scriptures, and also good learnynge, confuted▪ that it is impossible, where such

bokes, shallbe dilygently per∣syd, and reade, that this cursyd heresie shulde take any place. This shallbe therfore an holsōe Antidotus or conterpoyson a∣gaynst suche pestilent doctrines Which I dooe, most humbly of∣fer & dedicate vnto your grace, as vnto hym, that wyll, with all his myght, and godly power, see that the worde of god, shallbe e∣uerie where, pureiy and sincer∣ly preachyd, & that, as a tender father, wolde be full lothe also, yt any suche erronious doctryne, shoulde creepe in, to infecte the louinge, and faithfull subiectes of thys realme, desyrynge, and moste mekely besichynge youre grace, to accepte this my rude labour, which I haue bestowed in translating this fyrste boke, beinge alwayes readie, at your

graces commandement, to tran¦slate the other .iii. as sone, as god will gyue me grace, who of his infinite bountuousenesse, preserue your grace, and al the noble counseil of Eng¦land, long to continue, in loue, welth, & pros∣peritee, in our lorde and sauiour Iesu Christe, to whō be praise, ho∣nour and glory, world without ende.
