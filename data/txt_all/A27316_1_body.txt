My LORD,
THis Epistle Dedicatory which humbly lays this Little Volume at your Lordships feet, and begs a Protection there, is rather an Address

than a Dedication; to which a great many hands have subscrib'd, it Present∣ing your Lordship a Garland whose Flowers are cull'd by several Judgments in which I claim the least part; whose sole Ambition is this way to congra∣tulate your Lordships new A ddition of Honour, that of the Most Noble Order of the Thistle, an Honour which preced's that of the Garter, having been supported by a long Race of of Kings, and only fell with the most Illustrious of Queens, whose memory (which ought to be Establish'd, in all hearts can not be better preserv'd,) than by reviving this so Ancient Or∣der; well has His Majesty chosen its Noble Champions, among whom none merits more the Glory of that Royal Favor than your Lordship: whose

Loyalty to His Sacred Person and interest through all the adversities of Fate, has begot you so perfect a ve∣neration in all hearts, and is so pecu∣liarly the Innate vertue of your Great mind; a virtue not shewn by unrea∣sonable fits when it shall serve an end, (a false Bravery for a while when least needful, and thrown off when put to useful Tryal; like those who weigh∣ing Advantages by Probabilities only, and fancying the future to out-poyse the present, cast there their Anchor of Hope,) but a virtue built on so sure and steady Basis's of Honour, as nothing can move or shake; the Royal Interest being so greatly indeed the Property of Nobility, and so much even above life and Fortune: Especially when to support a Monarch so truly just, so

wise and great; a Monarch whom God Almighty Grant long to Reign over Us, and still to be serv'd by men of Principles so truly Brave, as those that shine in your Lordship.
Pardon, my Lord, this Digression and the meanness of this Present, which to a Person of your Lordships great and weighty Employments in the world may seem Improper, if I did not know that the most Glorious of Statesmen must somtimes unbend from Great Af∣faires, and seek a diversion in trivial En∣tertainments: Though Poetry will Justle for the Preheminency of all others, and I know is not the least in the Esteem of your Lordship, who is so admira∣ble a Judg of it, if any thing here may

be found worthy the Patronage it Im∣plores, 'twill be a sufficient Honour to,
My Lord,
Your Lordships most humble, most oblig'd, and obedient Servant,
A. BEHN.
