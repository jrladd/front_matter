IF the testimonie of a duetiful mind, might prooue a sufficient counterpeise to a be∣nefite, I might now (right Hono∣rable) discharge the bande, where with I am so deepelie indebted to your honor: But because I am not able with wordes, to match so high and honorable deedes, I am contēted to remaine a debter still. For as the magnificence of Car∣thage

was so great, that such as haue gone about to lift it vp with commendation, were suddainly stopt and enforst to confesse, they had rather say nothing, then say too little. So when I consider the excellencie of your calling, the nobility of your bloode, and the vertues wherin you shine, though I be desirous to giue a tast of your prayses vnto the world, yet find∣ing my sight too weake to stare vpon such a sun, I am cōpelde to turne away my face and giue it ouer. Neuerthelesse, knowing it to be the parte of a Princely coū∣sellour, to haue an eye in the head of euery common weale, I haue presumed to publish these newes of forraine partes in your honors name, and so much the rather, because I finde in your honor the

disposition of Panthoidas, who being sent Ambassadour into A∣sia, regarded not their goodly and sumptuous buildings, the rich or¦naments of their houses, & such other pleasaunt showes, but ra∣ther endeuoured himself to learn their policies, their gouernment, their customes, their Lawes and proceedings, the manner of pla∣cing of theyr battayle, the order of theyr fight, with such like en∣quiries woorthy a Noble man, whose notable steps your Lord∣ship in your honourable last Am¦bassage did honourably followe: to the perpetuall eternising of your honours auncient and no∣ble name, and the perfect conten∣tation of both their Maiesties.
Thus being lothe to be too te∣dious, I leaue these nouels to

your honours consideration, vn∣till time shall yeelde better, and better woorthy your honoura∣ble viewe. Till when and euer wholy dedicating my selfe to your honour, I wyshe your honour all felicity, and grace. The 29. of Iune 1585.
