Most Illustrious Princess,
SINCE God, the Fountain of all Goodness, hath given us Your Maje∣sties most Sacred Persons to Rule and Reign over us, to the great Joy of all those that wish well to our Zion, and a Terror to the Disaffected; I do humbly be∣seech Your Majesty out of the Abundance of Your wonted Clemency, That when Your Majesties most weighty Matters shall give leisure, that then Your Majesty would be pleased to lend Your Gracious Ear to the Travels and Sorrows of Your Majesties poor Subjects in France. So the great God above, by whose Power alone Monarchs Reign, Bless Your Majesties with a Long and a Happy Reign over us, and Crown You with Glory Everlasting.
