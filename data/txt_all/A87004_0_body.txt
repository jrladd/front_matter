SIR,
I Having received your apologetical discourse (in a Letter sent to a friend of mine) in re∣ference to what dis∣course you and I formerly had, in the which Letter you disco∣vered your self to be a great An∣tagonist unto the truth & the Mi∣nistry thereof: Moreover it doth appear by your Letter, that it is
your Pulpit discourse frequently to calumniate the people of God; upon the consideration whereof, I thought my self bound in duty to spend some time in shewing the difference betwixt true and false Ministers by several characters, to the end you may see your selves to be such (as you accuse the Mini∣sters of Christ to be) viz. the false corrupt Ministers, and so consequently the Ministers of Sa∣than, to the end you may cease to pervert the right way of the Lord, and repent of your abusing Gods People and Ordinances; for assuredly, Sirs, your turning of things upside down, will cause the Lord to turn you out of his presence, unlesse you repent, for God in all ages hath been very zea∣lous of his order, hence it came to passe, that the Lord threatned the Priests of old to shew them his back and not his face in the day
of their calamity; the reason was, because they had caused the People to stumble from the an∣tient path, to walk in a way not cast up, and doubtlesse it you look into the antient path of Christ, which he and his Apo∣stles and Disciples walked in, you will find that you are got far out of that path, for they did not teach for hire, to make themselves the Rabbies of the times, but were willing to de∣mean themselves, and be the ser∣vants of all men for Christs sake: neither did they cast up such a Path as Infants baptisme, to make whole Nations to be a Church, but did command per∣sons to come out from the mul∣titude, and thereby compacted Christs Churches together of sanctified Stones, that is to say men separated from the Natio∣nal multitude by repentance,
faith and baptism, which be∣came the spiritual house: More∣over Sir, whereas you abuse the People of God, by casting reproachfull ignominious slan∣ders on them, know, the Lord takes it as done unto himself, they being as dear to him as the apple of his eye, and if Samson would be revenged of the Philistins for his eyes, surely the Lord will be revenged of such as labour (as much as in them lieth) to pluck out his eyes; Sirs are you not like unto those Pharisaical Priests, that Christ reproves, which did build the toombs of the prophets, and gar∣nish the Sepulcher of the righte∣ous, pretending great love to them, and yet notwithstanding persecute the friends of Christ, which walk in that way which Christ hath left them to walk in, by your sect and example, I
say, if the blood of the righte∣ous should be required of such a generation, repent you and break off your sins by righteous∣nesse, before the wrath of the Lord break out, and there be no remedy: But to passe that, and come to the matter in hand, I have perused your Letter, and given you a full answer to it in the following treatise; one thing I strange at, that you should so much forget your self, as to charge me, that I fell upon you with abusive words for a Ser∣mon you delivered, in the which you said, you proved me, and such as I were to be the Mini∣sters of Sathan, when in very deed and truth, I knew not that you had delivered such a Ser∣mon, neither did I begin with you, but after you had answe∣red to some questions that were propounded to you (by another)
and that in your speech you had cast reproachfull speech up∣on the people of God, I could do no lesse but answer to your speech, but not with abusive words, as you may see more at large in the answer to your Let∣ter, and several other things you did mistake your self in, but I have shewed you them in their time and places, as before mentioned; Moreover, Sir, take this word of advise, that if your memory be so shallow, that you cannot retain any thing without Book, when you have the like occasion again, take down what is spoken in writting, so that you may affirm the truth, for I doe assure you to speak untruth is a shame and reproach to any peo∣ple, but more especially to such as professe themselves to be the Ministers of Christ; and as to o∣riginal Sin which was a thing we
contested about, I have also shewed you in the following trea∣tise what punishment it brought upon the Sons of men, and what death it was that was threatned as to be the punishment of it, the which death reigned over all from Adam to Moyses, and yet righte∣ous Noah and several others were not damned; so desiring your con∣version, much more than your confusion, I rest, but not to be your servant and all mens for Christs sake,
