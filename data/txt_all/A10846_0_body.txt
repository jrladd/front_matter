I haue thought it good as tyme novv serueth, to present you vvith suche simple trauell, as my barren industrie could yelde in lieu of learned and large lucubrations, an vnlearned and little peece of labour▪ for the accomplisshyng of parte of my duetie, beyng a small pāphlet, vvhiche J haue entituled Certaine select Hi∣stories, for Christian Recreation, no onely seruyng for the vsuall feaste o Christmas, beeit at this tyme celebra¦ted, but also necessarie to be vsed fo decent Recreation at all other tyme conuenient. Euery historie beyng com¦posed into seuerall verse, vvith th

glose or Moralization thereof aptly applied, and their apte tunes for their vse to be songe, vvith the argumente of euery Historie prefixed, vvhiche as I confesse, is but of small value, to responde vvith your expectations, yet herein as I am to craue pardon for my boldnesse, in dedicating the same vn∣to you, I haue good hope that you vvil not all together reiecte my good vvill, vvith the simplenesse of the vvoorke: But deme the beste of me, As one that vvould bee glad, in any greater mat∣ter to satisfie your vvorthie good vvilles at all tymes. And thus bese∣thyng youre vvorshippes, to beare vvith this my poore beginnyng, J surcease to trouble you any further. Restyng you in the tuitiō and gouer∣naunce

of the almightie. From my Chamber on the Southvvest side of the Cathedrall Churche of S. Paule in London, This xxi. daie of De∣cember. M.D.lxxvi.
