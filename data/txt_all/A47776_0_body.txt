MADAM,
TIs the nature of Goodness to be dif∣fusive; and the Sun from his high∣est exaltation doth as freely com∣municate his heat and influence to the meanest Shrub, as to the tall∣est Cedar. This I experimented to be a real Truth by the favourable aspect, which your Noble Father, your Vertuous and never too much to be lamented Mother, and your incompa∣rable Self were pleased to cast upon me, when I had the honour to be serviceable to a Branch of your Illustrious Family. Providence hath put an oppor∣tunity into my hands to return a small acknow∣ledgement of your Goodnesse and my gratitude, or

rather to give you a fresh occasion to exercise your indulgence in bestowing a double pardon, first up∣on my boldnesse, and then upon my faults. A Captive Princess begs your protection; and since her hard fortune hath deprived her of liberty, she cannot think her servitude more glorious, than in being a Hand-maid to your divertisement. I am very sensi∣ble, Madam, how unfitly a Translation is addressed to you, who are so well acquainted with the Origi∣nall Languages: But my design is not to inform your judgement, but to beg your Patronage, that the luster of your Name may give some value and esteem to this worthless piece. If you shall please in the least to own it, you will render it the more secure from others censure, and lay an eternal obligation upon him, who will ambitiously court all opportu∣nities to approve himself,
Madam,
