MADAM!
THough the Obligations which you have laid upon me, Require greater Acknowledgments than I am capable of making at this time; yet I shall Ingenuously Confess, that they have had the least share in Engaging me to those Respects which I am now about to pay you. No, Madam, Nothing but your abundant Charity, of which I have been often both a Witness and a Steward upon several Occasions, and more parti∣cularly upon this, hath Entituled you
to this Dedication: For besides the Yearly Allowance of Five Pounds to∣wards the Maintenance of this School, and the Addition of Ten Pounds more the last Year, towards the Binding of the poor Children of it unto Ho∣nest Trades, the giving of Two Hun∣dred Pounds more to be Improv'd to the same purpose for ever, makes it so much your Due, that it would be an inexcusable Omission, to publish these weak Endeavours of mine to∣wards the Service of this Excellent and Needful Piece of Charity, and not to do it under your Name, whose Heart GOD hath inclin'd by all these Ways that I have mention'd, to give such great Encouragement thereto. Nor will any of the rest of the Benefactors I am Confident take it ill, that I have thus singled you out from amongst them upon this Occasion; since, as I must always bear them Witness, that they have contri∣buted towards this Charitable Design, with all the Cheerfulness imaginable, so I am well assured, that they will rather Rejoice to see it so effectually promoted
by so liberal an Augmention of its Stock, than in any wise suspect that there is the least Injury done to their Memories there∣by. If therefore, I can but as well de∣fend my self against your Resentments, for making your Name so Publick, as I promise my self I shall, against any com∣plaint of theirs, I shall be the less concer∣ned at any thing that may happen to me from a Censorious World, since the Ho∣nesty of the Intention, and the Justice of the Occasion, will in a great Measure ex∣cuse all the Defects that may be discove∣red in this Performance: Nor will I al∣together Dispair of your Pardon, for do∣ing a thing so much against your Inclina∣tion and Design; sincee he who hath di∣rected us in the Distribution of our Chari∣ty, Not to let our Left Hand know what our Right Hand doth, hath also Commanded us, to let the light of our Good Works so to Shine before Men, that they may see it, and Glorifie our Father which is in Heaven. You, I am sure, hate blowing of a Trumpet before your Alms; and can more readily Embrace the most expensive Opportunity of doing Good, than endure to hear of it again af∣terwards;
and indeed it well becomes you, (for nothing is a greater Argument of a Vain Mind, than an Affectation of affixing our Name to any Publick Cha∣rity) but it would be a Fault in me, whose Duty and Business it is to do it for others, not to make the Trum∣pet Sound loud upon so just an Occa∣sion, especially too, since your many o∣ther Goods Works, like those of Solo∣mon's Virtuous Woman, do so much Praise you in the Gates; in which, and in every thing else that becomes our most Holy Profession, that you, and all those Worthy Persons, that have so readily lent their Charitable Assistance to so Good a Work as this is, may Abound and Pro∣sper, till you all come to receive those E∣verlasting Rewards that are promised to all those that are thus ready to do Good, and willing to Communicate, is, and shall be, the Daily Prayer of,
MADAM,
