WHereas about tvvo yeares past, I chaunced to haue offered me this present Treatise, vvhiche though I then accepted and gaue money for: yet, dreadyng least I might be ouer rashe in committyng it to the Print, especially before I had fully seene into the end and purpose of the vvriter, vvhom I vnderstood to bee a Gentleman of the North Countrey: yet novv after long de∣liberation, I finding this same both pleasaunt and profitable, haue aduentured the charge of Printyng it. Pleasaunt I say it is in regard of the inuention, and the more to be esteemed of, considering that it foretold (as it were) the comming of the Spanyards and their ouerthrow to our great vnspeaka∣ble good. Profitable it is in respect of example: for here a∣mong the due prayses of many, those tvvo most noble and loyall men your good honorable Father I meane, and the like right honorable the Earle of Darby, are set as specta∣cles or looking glasses, wherein all men may see a liuely pourtrayture of right Noble myndes in deede, for the right

of their Countreys vveale beyng most vigilant and studi∣ous. Hereto bee adioyned of the foresayd Authours doyng also, certaine Verses penned vpon the name of my Lord Straunge, and sundry others, vpon the names of diuers wor∣shipfull, whiche, for that they are tending vnto vertue and prettie inuentions full of wittie sentences, I haue thought good to adde vnto the former Treatise.
If any will contend, that such graue matters as in the for∣mer part be intreated of, ought not be expressed vnder a co∣lour of Dreames, let him but read Cicero his worke De som∣nio Scipionis, & he shall find there most graue & pithie mat∣ters, touching the vvell vsage of a Common weale, concer∣ning the vnstablenesse and inualiditie of riches in compari∣son to vertue, with the blessed ende of good men, and the wofull miserie of the vvicked, all effectually discoursed vn∣der the name of a Dreame. Now my humble suite is that your honour will vouchsafe to take on you the patrosinie of this Treatise, to whom I haue thought best for to dedi∣cate the same, and that you will herein respect not so much the slendernesse of the gift, or the vnworthines of the giuer, but will accordyng to your noble curtesie, take in good part the simple good will of me your poore suppliant, vvho, though I be able to deserue nothing of your honour, yet will I euer pray for your good prosperitie.
