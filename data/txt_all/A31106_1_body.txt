HONOURED SIR,
IF the Roman Fortitude of Laberius who
in a Syrian disguise, did in the than De∣bauched
Senate complain of Tyranny
(Porto quirites libertatem perdidimus) hath
merited such applauds of a worthy Patriot;
what English-man can without unpardona∣ble
Ingratitude forget to Honour Mr. PRINNE
as Pater Patriae for his Couragious, Publick,
and Constant asserting of our Religion, Laws,
and Liberties; and giving us in the blackest
night of Tyranny a Dedalian Clue whereby to
extricate our selves when to most Mens
thoughts we were irrevocably lost? No,
SIR, Your Numerous and Nervous, Large,
and Learned Volumes (which who can rec∣kon)
have been so succesful in their Refu∣tation
of Errours, Reformation of Vice, Regula∣tion
of Disorders, Restauration of Parliaments,
and Laws, that I must in Justice joyn you

with Renowned General MONK, as the two
VVorthiest Subjects of all Honour: For if his
Generosity speaks him Herculem Anglorum, your
Erudition proclaims you Alcidem Literarum:
If he be our Daring Marcellus, you are our
Grave Fabius; if he, our Active Caesar, you
are our Eloquent Cicero; and what his Va∣liant
Sword hath effected, your Learned Pen
had frequently advised. So that to con∣clude
with the Exordium which one
bestowed uponVarro sui seculi, & Cicero Germa∣niae; quod ad arcana cujusque doctrinae infinita le∣ctione, & inusitata{que} memoria penetravit. Gifianus. Erasmus; VVhere
could I have chosen a safer Asylum, or pro∣perer
Patrociny for my Learned Man, than
with a Gentleman of so vast Learning?
Therefore He is come in an English Dresse,
to entreat your hospitable Reception of him
as a Stranger, desiring you would not charge
on Him the Lapses of his Interpreter, and
Worthy Sir,
