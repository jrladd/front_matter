(Soveraigne Lord,)
THey that are to treat with great
Potentates and Personages are
inioyned, to be short and sweet.
If I faile in the last, I shall not
misse of the first,—Ne longo
sermone morer tua Tem∣pora
(Caesar.)
The last great Mortalitie, I published certaine
Rules, and Directions, for the prevention of the
spreading of that contagious, and all devouring
Sicknesse. Those briefe advertisements I have sear∣ched
out, reviewed, somewhat inlarged, and brought
forth againe, to the view and use, and I hope good of

my Citizens and Countrimen. My presumption is,
that though I shall purchase neither profit nor
praise, yet I shall obtaine pardon of your Maiestie,
if tendring the common good of my Country, I bring
one pale-full, or rather dishfull of water, toward the
quenching of the common flame. Morbi (ut rectè
Celsus Med. Latinorum Princeps) non curan∣tur
eloquentia, multò minus loquentia. Espe∣cially
this fierce Fury, which is non Morbus, sed
Monstrum, superans saepissime tum Artem,
tum Naturam, not a disease, but a Monster, over∣matching,
and quelling, oft-times both Art and Na∣ture.
The Lord of glory and mercy keep your High∣nesse,
with your most Honourable Councell from the
rage of this man-slaying Hydra, and all other both
open and secret evils and enemies, and make you a
wise and skilfull Physitian to prevent the dangers,
and cure the maladies of Common-wealth and State.
