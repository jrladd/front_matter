HOw ioyfully the Authors Poem goes,
To thee, whose wit, whose vertues he admires,
With what a willing soule hee daily shows,
That loue, the which thy loue of him requires,
Whose name he honors, and whose machlesse worth,
He can imagine better than set forth.


His minde farre more is, than his feeble might,
Yet hath he wouen of this home-spunne thred,
So fine a webbe, so richly scourde and dight,
(Minerua like) beyond the wisest head:
The which to praise, were onely to this end,
To marre the loome, and not the cloth to mend.
