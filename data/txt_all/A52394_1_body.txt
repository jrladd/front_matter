Beloved Brethren,
IT was Josephs Lot to be sepa∣rated from his Brethren, but God meant it for good; tho' it was not for the present seen, yet in due time it appeared Josephs Dreams were fulfilled; and tho' the Archers shot sorely at him, and grieved him, yet his Bow abode in strength: Oh how good it is to be upright with the Lord! It is one of the sad evils of the Times, Brethren shoot at Brethren: But this will be a Mercy

indeed, if all our Aim might  to enjoy, and be conformable to Christ one part of Conformity to our Lor Jesus, is Obedience to the Preciou Ordinance of Baptism, judging yo are such as press after Christ you Head, together with a Testimonial of my unfeigned Love to you, I have presented these few Thoughts to your serious Consideration. I have read of Two Loving Friends, who having spent a great part of the day in a matter of Difference between them, could not be reconciled, and so parted; One of them bethinking himself of that Text, Eph. 4.26. ran to the other, saying, The Sun is going down, by which they were both im∣mediately reconciled. My Brethren, our Sun is going down, Eternity is

upon us, and shall we not consider the Work we have to do for the Lord? I beseech you be like the No∣ble Bereans, search whether these things be so; and if you find these things not mine, but the Lords, then give him the glory due to his Name. Beloved, as I have, so I shall yet appeal in the Ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, like Elijah; Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be seen this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy Word, 1 Kings 18.36. Now Lord let Fire come down from Heaven on this Sacrifice, that may drink up all the waters of strife: And that you may all cry, The Lord

he is God, the Lord he is God ver. 39. Which is the unfeigned desire of him that is unworthy  serve you; yet your loving Brothe in Jesus Christ,
