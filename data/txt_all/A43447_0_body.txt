My Lord,
AS a Valiant Soldier is al∣ways
forward to shew
his courage in the most dan∣gerous
and difficult stratagems
of War, being incited by the
Example of his great Com∣mander
and General, who,

both in Sieges and Field-bat∣tels,
hath given such glorious
proofs of his Courage and
Conduct, that the Valiant can∣not
behold him without En∣vy,
and Cowards with∣out
Terrour. So those whom
APOLLO hath inspired to aim
at GLORY and not RICHES,
always endeavour eminently to
excel in things most difficult
or occult. The brightness of a
Genius, like the flame of a
Torch, shines most splendid in
the greatest obscurity; it ap∣pears
but mean and indiffe∣rent
in matters that are clear
and evident. I have here un∣dertook
a subject, in which

the most perspicatious have
been but Moles; and have en∣tred
the List, against almost
all Naturalists and Physicians,
that I might imitate the cou∣rage
of the Valiant Soldier,
whom the event shows, not to
be out-matcht by the greatest
danger. Right Noble Sir, I
will here prove to you and
the whole Republick of Phy∣sick,
that it is not rashly and
Emperically that I have reco∣vered
many persons by this
Sympathetick way of curing,
but by a method truly Noble
and Heroick. If I shall obtain
any Honour by this Doctrine
of Sympathy, I most humbly

dedicate it to your Honour;
if otherwise, I can offer this,
that they were always esteem∣ed
praise-worthy, who brave∣ly
fell in the engagement, tho
they could not obtain the
Victory.
