GReat and manifold were the Blessings (most Noble and Magnificent Assembly) which Almighty God, the Father of all Mercies, be∣stowed upon the People of England, when your most Wise and Ho∣norable Ancestors, by a most impartial
and happy Reformation, expelled from the Church those Thick and Palpable Clouds of darkness, that for many years had overshadowed this Land, And as it yet giveth unto all that are well affected an exceeding great cause of comfort, so the fruit thereof doth extend it self, not only to the time spent in this Transito∣ry World, but to our safe conduct to that Eternal Happiness which is above in Heaven. The occasions (most Au∣gust Assembly) of my relinquishing the Romish way of Worship, were the many exceeding gross Errors, and most wicked Practices, which I found I must necessa∣rily be daily guilty of, continuing there∣in. And the Motives that enduced me to imbrace the Reformed Religion, and be Reconciled to Protestancy, were the most Sacred Scriptures, and Antient Fa∣thers, unto whom I found the same a∣greeable, both which, having here ex∣hibited,
I humbly Present to your High Court; Humbly craving (since things of this Nature, have ever been Subject to the censures of ill meaning, and dis∣contented persons) the same may re∣ceive Approbation and Patronage from so Learned and Judicious an Assembly, as your High Court is; That so (al∣though I am exposed hereby, on the one side, to the undeserved Calumniations of the Popish party, who strive to keep the World in ignorance and darkness; and, on the other side, to the Foolish Malignity of self-conceited Brethren, who like of nothing but what is done by themselves, or at leastwise framed af∣ter their own fancy) I may rest secure; supported within, by the Truth and In∣nocency of a good Conscience (having walked in the ways of Simplicity and Integrity, as before the Lord) and su∣stained without, by the Powerful Pro∣tection
of your most August Assemblies, Grace and Favour (which no doubt will ever give Countenance to honest and Christian endeavours) against bit∣ter Censures, and Uncharitable Impu∣tations.
The Lord of Heaven and Earth grant to this our Nation, that by your wise endeavours, Popery may be utterly Ex∣tirpated, and Protestancy firmly establish∣ed to all generations: So that Peace and Happiness, Truth and Justice, Religion and Piety, may ever flourish.
