SIR,
AS in those more painfull imployments
you formerly underwent in Trans∣marine
parts you did with great fide∣litie,
courage, and industry for sundry
yeers, mannage the affaires of our En∣glish
Merchants intrusted to your care
and discretion: So now in this your present retire∣ment,
your continuall Study makes it manifest, you
act not the part of a young man (though your yeeres
speake you not aged) but like a wise man (that ever
husbands Time with advantage) You enrich your
minde with Knowledge, Converse amongst Studies,
and with Authors of wisedome, that hereafter you
may be more serviceable to your Country as oppor∣tunitie
shall present you with a fit occasion: I shall
not neede acquaint the World, that you have (as we
say changed heaven) and lived not further then five

degrees from the Aequinoctiall; yet have you still re∣mained
your selfe, and twice returned Statu quo, bet∣tered
by your travells.
This little Treatise (of lesse worth then I wish it) I
present unto you, and desire your perusall by way of
Recreation, (I am not singular in Dedicating a small
thing to a worthy Friend: Iohn Dee a most Learned
man Dedicated his Aphorismes to Gerard Mercator a
man famous, and they consisted of lesse then sixe
sheets.)
Wearied I say with more weighty Studies, run over
this, and the rather, because its the first in this kinde
ever wrote by any: and you can judge whether 'tis
well or ill done, and few else: Your selfe have seene it
in loose papers, from the beginning, middle, and to
the end of it, are able to testifie its my owne, I bor∣rowed
it from no man, (that impertinent Traveller
spoake by Authority, who hoodwinked in judge∣ment,
bleated openly that others performed my
Worke, yet he never saw me.)
Sir, Favour me with as much love in Receiving it
humanely, as I in Affection tender it unto You,
and You engage me to rest,
