IT hath alwayes bene
an ancient, necessary,
common, and com∣mendable
custome a∣mongst
the most sorts
of writers (right Re∣uerend
father, and my
honourable good lord) in all their works
to seeke the patronage of some woorthie
person to whom the defence of the mat∣ter
handled did most especially either in
duetie or deuotion appertaine: And be∣cause
I am to publish in print, to my
countries good (as I am perswaded by di∣uers
my worshipfull friends) my recanta∣tion
made at Paules Crosse, considering
with my selfe that in causes Ecclesiastical,
the gouernment is giuen by God, (next
vnder her Maiestie) principally to your
grace, and because the matter here trea∣ted
of is such, I thought it most conueni∣ent

to offer the same to your grace, vnto
whom both I and my labours do of dutie
on our partes (next vnto her highnesse, by
whose gracious clemencie and mercy we
haue that we liue) chiefly belong, & vn∣der
whose protectiō we may safely walke
without feare of controll, and both our
wants be more then sufficiently furnished
by your graces countenance and fauour,
which haue hitherto bene alwayes ready
to helpe those that haue relied thereupon,
the which vndeserued grace (whereof I
nothing doubt) if your honourable good
lordship doe affoord me, I shall be further
emboldned without dismay, to put foorth
to vse my masters talent, which hitherto
hath lien hidden in a napkin without any
maner of gaine: and if the commoditie a∣mount
to any thing, your graces portion
no doubt, will be therein double; in this
world increase of vertue & honour, things
according with your high calling & zea∣lous
profession, and after this life eternall
happinesse wherewith God will crowne
in you all his works, your graces labours,
which God graunt for his mercies sake,
through his onely sonne Iesus Christ.
