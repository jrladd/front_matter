RIGHT HONORABLE:
AStrea finding so good entertaine∣ment in her owne Countrey, as ha∣uing passed the Presse in the 3. prin∣cipall Cities of FRANCE, namely, PARIS, ROAN and LYONS, is now encouraged to crosse the seas, and to try what welcome she shall meete with here in ENGLAND. And though it cannot be, but her ri∣ding-suite will take much away from her originall beauty (it being the fortune of few Bookes to be bet∣tered by the translation) yet she is so confident of her owne Worth, that she expects acceptance onely for

herselfe, and not for her ornaments. And as at home she went abroad vnder the protection of a mighty King; so being abroad, and a stranger, she is desirous to shel∣ter her selfe vnder the Honourable Patronage of your Lordship, and your right noble Lady, against the a∣spertions of the ouer-curious. In which choice ioy∣ning with her, and presenting her to your fauourable acceptance, I am in all humility to craue your hono∣rable pardons for my presumption, and do rest
