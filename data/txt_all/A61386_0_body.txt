THese first fruits I humbly lay at thy blessed footstool, being ambitious of no other Patron but Thy self; for, Thou alone canst attest the sincerity of my aim herein, which will plead with Thee for the imbecillities thereof: Thou alone art the right Author of every valuable line and word in this ensuing

Tract. The Errata's only are mine, but the Honour's Thine. Thou hast the strongest hand, and truest heart to protect, both the Writing and the Writer from all the malicious or unkind usage, that we may meet with. Thy approbation chiefly I humbly crave, and then I am sure to have all good men on my side. Against Thee, Thee only have I offended by my Distractions, and done these evils in Thy sight; and therefore am bound to seek the destruction of them, in all the world for Thy sake. Thou hast so infinitely obliged the unworthy Writer of these lines, that he rejoyces in this op∣portunity

to tell the world, That there is none in Heaven or Earth to be compared to Thee. Thou only canst make my Indeavours herein succes∣ful, and bring that to the heart, which I could only present to the ear or eye. Vnto Thee therefore do I dedicate both this and my self, with this earnest Prayer, That this Essay may both please Thee, and profit thy Church! That Thou wouldest take this Rod into Thy hands, and there∣with whip these buyers and sel∣lers out of Thy Temple! That Thy great Name may hereby be magnified, though the Writers were never known! To Thy

heavenly blessing, do I most humbly recommend this mean work, and worthless workman, with a Resolution to remain, while I have any Being,
