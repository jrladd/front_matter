Right Honourable,
HOw euer I could neuer arriue at the happinesse to be made knowne to your Lordship, yet a desire borne with me, to make tender of all du∣ties, and seruice, to the Noble Family of the Her∣berts, descended to me as an inheritance from my dead Father, Arthur Massinger. Many yeares hee happily spent in the seruice of your Honourable House, and dyed a seruant to it; leauing his, to be euer most glad, and ready, to be at the command of al such, as deriue themselues from his most ho∣nour'd Master, your Lordships most noble Father. The consideration of this, encouraged me (hauing no other meanes to present my humblest seruice to your Honour) to shrowde this trifle, vnder the


wings of your Noble protection; and I hope out of the clemency of your Heroique disposition, it will finde, though perhaps not a welcome enter∣tainment, yet at the worst a gratious pardon. When it was first Acted, your Lordships liberall suffrage taught others to allow it for currant, it hauing receaued the vndoubted stampe of your Lordships allowance: and if in the perusall of any vacant houre, when your Honours more serious occasions shall giue you leaue to reade it, it an∣swer in your Lordships iudgement, the report and opinion it had vpon the Stage, I shall esteeme my labours not ill imployde, and while I liue continue,
