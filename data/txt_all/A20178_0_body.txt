WOrthy Syr, this Poeme being sent vnto me to be printed after the death of the Author, who intended to haue done it in his life, but was preuented by death: I could not among my good friends, be∣thinke me of any one to whom I might more fitly dedicate it (as well for the nature of the subiect in which you delight as to expresse my loue) than to your selfe. I finde it not onely sauouring of Art and Honesty, two things now strangers vnto many Authors, but also both pleasant and profitable; and being loath to see a thing of such value lye hid∣den in obscuritie, whilest matters of no moment pester the stales of euery STATIONER; I therefore make bolde to publish it, for the benefit and delight of all, trusting that I shall neither thereby dispa∣rage
the Author, nor dislike them. I neede not, I think, Appollogize either the vse of the subiect, or for that it is reduced into the nature of a Poeme; for as touching the last (in that it is in verse) some count it by so much the more delightfull; and I holde it euery way as fit a subiect for Poetry as Husbandry: and touching the first, if Hunting & Hawking haue beene thought worthy delights and Artes to be instructed in, I make no doubt but this Art of Angling is much more worthy pra∣ctise and approbation; for it is a sport euery way as pleasant, lesse chargeable, more profitable, and nothing so much subiect to choller or impatience as those are: you shall finde it more briefly, plea∣santly, & more exactly performed, then any of this kinde heretofore. Therefore I referre you to the perusing thereof, and my selfe to your good opinion, which I tender as that I holde most deere; euer re∣maining at
