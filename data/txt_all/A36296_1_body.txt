Lords Commissioners of the Great Seale.
THe reward that many yeares since was pro∣posed
for the publishing these Sermons, ha∣ving
been lately conferred upon me under
the authority of the Great Seale, I thought
my selfe in gratitude bound to deliver
them to the world under your Lordships
protection; both to show, how carefull
you are in dispensing that part of the Churches treasure, that
is committed to your disposing, and to encourage all men to
proceed in their industry, when they are sure to find so just and
equall Patrons, whose fame and memory must certainely last
longer then Bookes can find so noble Readers, and whose present
favors doe not onely keep the Living alive, but the Dead
from dying.
