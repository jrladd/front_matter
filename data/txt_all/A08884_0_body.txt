THis long labour (right Worshipfull, and my most affected) hauing cost me so many late and earlie houres, among other mishaps of much bodilie sicknesse: beeing nowe fully perfected, and past through all contrary oppositions, comes to kisse the hand of my most gentle Patrone, and to honour him with his very vttermost seruice. If you finde the translation to come short of such absolute perfection, as a worke of so much merit in right might challenge: burie that blemish in your euer-knowne affable nature, & prize my good will beyond all other ability, which gladly would attaine to higher sufficiencie. Againe, where a man is abridged of so necessary a helpe, as not to haue the reperusall of his owne rash-written papers, which an after iudgement may easilie checke and controule: many errours may escape, & grosse slyps be committed, all which I must now beare the burden of, and endure the sentence (as I may) of euery strict censure. But if your Worâˆ£ship countenaunce my endeuours with your wonted kindnesse, and hold them any way worthy your very meanest acceptation: I haue all I desire, and which I will further studie to deserue, remaining to you and yours for euer obliged, and (in what I may) continuallie to be commaunded.
