THat we have been harras'd and al∣most
begger'd by a tedious and
Expensive War, needs no Proof;
but how this War came to be
drawn out to this Length, and to drein the
inexhaustible Well dry (as the Popes use to
stile this Island) is not possible for me to
discover. However I have here laid down
some Remarkable Instances how Evil mind∣ed
Men have Clandestinely Crept into Places
of the greatest Trust; whether meerly to en∣rich
themselves, or more barbarously only to

wreck their Causeless Malice upon their Na∣tive
Countrey; have extreamly contributed to
the Discouraging, enslaving and even totally
ruining her. It hath been no small or use∣less
stratagem in this Age, to discountenance
all manner of Information, and that all sorts
of Villany might Reign Rampant, the Name
of an informer hath been reputed Mon∣strous.
By which means some Honest Per∣sons,
who have by accident come to the
Knowledge of Transactions, both unwar∣rantable
and of dangerous Consequence to
the Nation, have conniv'd at all, and stifl'd
that affection they had, and so fair an op∣portunity
to demonstrate to their Countrey,
upon the Fear and Terror of being repu∣ted
Madmen or Informers, and whereas
some have broke this Bar, and have dis∣charg'd
their Consciences, yet the little
good they thereby did, or therefore re∣ceiv'd,
hath been a great Discouragement;
Yet notwithstanding the Author of these
following sheets, knowing how much his
King and Countrey have suffer'd, by such
Base and Treacherous Practices as are here Re∣cited;

Values not what some may censure,
so that he may acquaint those who have
Power to inspect and reward according to
what hath been done.
To give your Honours no farther trou∣ble,
tho the wicked Practices of Men have
furnished me with plenty of matter; I shall
only add that Articles setting forth these
matters, have been by me preferr'd against the
Lords of the Admiralty, the Commissioners of
the Navy, and the Commissioners for the sick
and wounded Seamen. Yet so great have
been their interest, and so difficult to find a
Zealous Patron of Truth, that all Labour
and Travel in this matter hath been unsuck∣cessful.
It's probable the time of War was not so
opportune, and seeing I was not permitted to
prove those Articles, it's now nevertheless
hop'd by all Good Men, this Blessed Peace, as
it affords Liberty, so it will give occasion to
this great and most August Assembly to look
into these Affairs: In regard His Majesty (of
his innate Goodness) in His Late most Graci∣ous
Speech to both House of Parliament, Has

been pleas'd to express his willingness, and deire
to rectify all such Corruptions and Abuses as may
have crept into any part of the Administration dur∣ing
the War.
Which upon Examination will be found to
be such as are destructive to all Human Society,
and tend to the Final over-throw of the Go∣vernment.
I am, my Lords and Gentlemen,
with all profound Respect.
