THou which delight'st to view this goodly plot,
Here take such flowres as best shal serue thy vse,
VVhere thou maist find in euery curious knot,
Of speciall vertue, and most preus iuyce,
Set by Apollo in their seuerall places,
And nourished with his celestiall Beames,
And watered by the Muses and the Graces,
With the fresh dew of those Castalian streames.
What sente or colour canst thou but deuise
That is not here, that may delight the sense?
Or what can Art or Industry comprize,
That in aboundance is not gather'd hence?
No Garden yet was euer halfe so sweet,
As where Apollo and the Muses meet.
