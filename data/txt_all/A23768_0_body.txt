My Lord,
TO vouch your Lord∣ships
commands for
the publishing this
Discourse, I might
reasonably think, would be to
libel your judgement; and the pre∣fixing
your Name to it, and this
mean address, would look ra∣ther
like revenge then homage or

obedience: if I did not know that
low performances are due to
the transcendency of such a
subject as I then discours'd upon,
and such a Patron as I now de∣dicate
to: So I lie prostrate un∣der
my great Arguments, here in∣sufficiency
is Art and Rhetorick.
And the truth is, my Lord, it
was not this which made me so
sollicitous to avoid your injun∣ctions,
but apprehensions of
the unusefulness of the Dis∣course
it self.
When God's most signal me∣thods
of all sorts do not seem
to have wrought much convi∣ction;
when neither our own
dismal guilts, nor miseries, nor

most express miracles of deli∣verance
have made us sensible,
but after the equally stupen∣dous
30th of Ianuary and 29th of
May, and the black time that
interven'd, we are still the same
perverse untractable people; when
luxury is the retribution made
for plenty, licence for liberty, and A∣theism
for Religion, whil'st miracles
of mercy are acknowledg'd only
by prodigies of ingrateful disobedi∣ence:
and on the other side,
when factious humors swell a∣gainst
all Laws, as they would
either over-flow those mounds,
or make them yield and give way
to them; when Declarations and
Decrees, which were infallible when

they came only from a party of
a part of a Parliament, are neither
of force nor esteem when they
have all solemnity and obli∣gation
that just and full authority
can give; alas, what hopes of
doing any thing can a weak
Harangue entertain? But, my
Lord, since you are pleas'd to
command, I give up both it
and my understanding to your
Lordship, and the weaker the
Discourse is, so much the more
pregnant testimony is it of
the obsequiousness of
My Lord,
