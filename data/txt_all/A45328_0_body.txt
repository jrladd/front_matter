Madame:
BEnefits (we say) are binders, and
every Favour received makes the Re∣ceiver
a Debtor: If this be so, I
must needs acknowledge my self deeply
indebted to You for those many reall
Favours which from time to time You
have shewed to me, and to my Sonns that have been
Your Chaplains. And, that I may not wholly dye
ungratefully, I have sent you a Schoars Gift, a Paper∣present,
as a Testimony of my best Respects unto Your
Ladyship, who have been so eminent a Friend and
Patroness to us of the Ministry; and that in a time when
so many hate us, rob us, revile us, without a cause. You
have been more like a Nursing mother than a Friend to many of your neighbouing Ministers, especially
where their means is low: Your Ladyships readiness
to contribute to the augmenting of the Maintenance of
Ministers, and setting up of Preaching, where there
is none; Your respectfull Entertainment of the Minsters of Christ weekly at Your house; Your bounty in parting with considerable Summes towards

the breeding of ingenuous and hopefull Children for
the work of the Ministry; Your tender respect especi∣ally
to the Orphans of Ministers; Your late disbursing
of a considerable Summ at a bare motion of mine
towards the breeding of a very hopefull childe, the son
of a pious and painfull Minister, whose father is now
with God; your great care for their family in Spirituals
as well as Temporals; your constant Morning and
Evening Sacrifice there; and your care to see that your
Family lve Prayers, and live their Sermons, and live
up to their Dties: and if any be found to be Drunkards,
Fornicatours, Lascivious, Sabbath-prophaners, &c.
You quickly make them know, that those who will not
be servants to God, shall be no servants to you; your
Religious care in a timely providing of a pous and
ingenuous Instructor for the fatherless and motherless
Little On,Samuel Marrow Esquire. which now lies solely upon your hands; as
he is a Samuel by name, so you endeavour to make
him a Samuel indeed, by instructing him betimes in
the wayes of God, that so he may have a heart to
improve that great Estate which providence hath cast
upon him, to the glory of that God that gave it; your
carefull Observation of the Lords-day, not onely in
the publick, but in the Intervalls of Divine Worship,
to keep your Family from straying; you have not
onely Repetitions, but also Reading of some practical
Divinity constantly on the Lords day to your Family.
These things justly praise you in the gates, and though
no tongue should praise you, yet your works them∣selves
will do it: Vertuous actions are the best Oratours,
and they speak best, who do best; And though your
Ladyship had rather do good, than hear of it; yet
that others (in these last and worst times, when the
love of so many waxeth cold) may be incited to follow

your Ladyships Pious and Charitable Example, I could
not but publish those things to Gods glory, and your
further encouragement in the work of the Lord.
'Twas the Commendation of Dorcas, that she made
cates for the poor whilest she lived (Acts 9. 39.) she
did not as most do, put it off till death, and then
make good wills, after all their evill deeds: but your
Ladyship in your life-time hath expressed your bounty
long since to the Town of Nottingham, in giving them
Two Hundred Pounds, as a Stock to be carefully
improved for the best advantage of their poor: besides
the dayly occasional gifts to such as are reall Ob∣jects
of pitty and compassion. You have been Eyes
to the Blinde, Feet to the Lame; a Father to the
Fatherlesse; a Mother to the Motherlesse; These
you take into your Family, and when you have
hatched them up, you part with considerable Summs
to set them forth Apprentises; And, which is wor∣thy
observing, your Ladyship hath been a great
gainer by all this, God hath blessed your Sub∣stance,
and your Store, he hath made your latter
end better then your beginning, and hath cast
riches on you in abundance, which you never look∣ed
for; and, above all, he hath given you a heart
to improve what he hath given you to his praise;
and to order your affairs with that discretion, and
good Huswifery, that those who have farr greater
means, yet do not the Tythe of that good which
you do; and all because they spend that in rio∣tous
feasting, superfluous building, keeping a kennel
of Hounds, or some other sinfull and exorbitant
course, which disables them, and dispirits them from
Works of Piety and Mercy, Now the good Lord
remember you in mercy for all that you have

done for his House, for his Ministers, and for
his people▪ He recompence all your labour of
Love seven-fold into your bosome; and when
You have served your Generation here, he receive
you unto himself in glory. This is, and shall be
the Prayer, of
Kings-Norton:
Novemb. 3. 1659.
