SIR,
NO importunity of Friends could perswade me, no calumny of my worst Enemies could pro∣voke me, niether could the juncture of time when this Sermon was preach'd, induce me (onely the assurance of your Lordships Patronage hath prevailed with me) to expose to publick view these weak Medi∣tations; without which, this Scroll, as worthless, must have undergone the Authors doom, and must have been condemned to perpetual forgetfulness.
And certainly (my good Lord) there is great necessity of your defence, who have been so valiant for the Truth, and feared no opposition. For that Spirit of Loyalty and Obedience that runs through this whole Discourse, which sure was the sole reason that moved you to like it when preach'd before you, will for this reason alone make it dis-relishing amidst an unreason∣able Generation; which setting up a pretended Con∣science above, yea against a certain Law, is yet despe∣rately hurried headlong into a lawless liberty and licen∣tiousness, and into all manner of disobedience.

If therefore there be any thing in this Treatise that may conduce to correct these miscarriages, I think I need not protest my Integrity in delivering them: Malice it self will acquit me, and my worst Enemies cannot entertain a suspition of my Hypocrisie in this; when no former Preferments have pre-ingaged me, no future Hopes can have byassed me, no other Worldly Respects can have inclined me: but that is done in all proba∣bility, is done in simplicity, out of an unfeigned love to Order and Peace.
To which if I may contribute any thing, I have my designe; and the Reader that hath any benefit will with me thank God for your Lordship, and pray heartily for the continuance of your Welfare; who hath been always ready to act and suffer for the pre∣servation of the Religion, the Laws and Obedience of the Nation. This your care hath brought these things that follow to the light: And the assurance of your Lordships perseverance, constrains the Author, that he can no longer forbear to vow himself
