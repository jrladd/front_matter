My LORD,
AS soon as I yielded to the publica∣tion of this Sermon, I
resolved to commit it to your Lordships Pa∣tronage. The high Esteem,
(together with an earnest desire publickly to shew my gratitude) I have
of your Loyalty to the King, your hearty Zeal and Fervor for the
Protestant Interest, your dexte∣rity in the management of publick
Bu∣siness, your Sage and Eloquent way ofSpeech, and those many other high Ac∣complishments
and extraordinary En∣dowments you are abundantly rich in, will, I hope,
excuse the boldness of this Dedication, and obtain pardon for
pre∣fixing your Great Name to so slender a Discourse.
My LORD,
Your Lordship has improved the Ho∣nour you were born to, and
advanced your Noble and Ancient Family, by standing fast to your Religion,
and sup∣porting our Laws and Liberties, when Popery and an Arbitrary Power
were coming in to be triumphant among us. May your Lordship live long, to be
an Ornament to your Country, and a Bles∣sing to the Publick, is, and
shall be the daily prayer of
My Lord,
