Madam,
I Have often observed the In∣convenience of too obstinately maintaining an Opinion con∣trary to that which has generally obtained, and in serious or weigh∣ty Matters have carefully avoid∣ed that Rock upon which I have known some to have been lost;
 but in our last Converse, the Sub∣ject whereof was the Finess with which the Ladies and Gallants of this present Age manage their A∣mours, which the Company then present unanimously agreed was advanced to a perfection, no former Age could parallel; hav∣ing uncontrouledly asserted the contrary; and perhaps too posi∣tively, and having given an In∣stance in some Passages of above five hundred years ago, which you all would positively conclude to be a Fiction, till I satisfi'd you, that I met with the Histo∣ry in an antient Greek Manu∣script, which by the Injury of time, and the Ignorance of the
 Persons, through whose hands it had passed, was very imperfect, as having neither beginning nor ending; and in some places not legible, and with many interrup∣tions of some excellent Passages, yet contain'd enough to justifie my Assertion, and to convince the Hearers, that in that Age and Countrey, there were Per∣sons who lived much after our Mode, and that there is nothing new under the Sun. I thought I should have had the general applause of that illustrious Com∣pany, for having so well justified my self; but instead thereof, am punisht with their and your indis∣pensible Commands, to put what
 remains of that Piece; the short account whereof was agreeably received by you, into a Language intelligible to persons more con∣cerned in affairs of that nature, than acquainted with the Tongue in which before now it was only extant. My Style, I know, is very unfit for the Subject, and my time designed for a far different Em∣ployment; but rather than disob∣lige so many, and so fair Friends, I have put a Force upon my self, and sequestered some few hours for this her View, but freely profess to you, it is a Piece very im∣perfect in the Matter, by the Misfortune and Injury of many Ages, but more by the rudeness
 of the Translators Style, who in the Judgment of the Learned, will be censur'd for having done the elegant Author much wrong; but in regard his Name is not known, and so none can be con∣cern'd for him, I cannot be con∣demn'd to reparation, and there∣fore with more confidence pre∣sent it to you, as it is with all its Defects.
