GOOD MADAM,
I Do vnfai∣nedly ac∣knowledg and con∣fesse that in my priuate iudgment

I haue alwaies distasted the too much forwardnes of this age in publishing vnnecessary bookes, and pamphlets. So farre haue I bene from once inten∣ding my selfe to offend in that kind. First, in consi∣deration of mine owne weaknesse and insuffici∣encie best knowne vnto my selfe; Next, in regard of that great light of lear∣ning & knowledge which shineth most brightly e∣uery where at this day: And lastly, in respect of the great peruersnesse & curiositie that reigneth in the minds of sundrie

men, whom nothing plea∣seth and contenteth, but that which they them selues do, or (at the least wise) affect. Howbeit notwithstanding, after that I had (for mine owne priuate vse) collected and gathered these spirituall directions and consolati∣ons; and also perceiued how that the same might be of some good vse to others, not onely in time of sicknesse, but also in all other afflictions and di∣stresses, whether of mind or bodie: I esteemed it a part of that great dutie which I owe vnto the

Church of God, to com∣municate & impart these my poore endeuours vn∣to such, and for the bene∣fite & comfort of all such, as shall stand in neede thereof, in times of sick∣nesse and mortalitie, in the conflict of death, and other sharpe and bitter daies of triall and temp∣tation; whensoeuer their sins shall stand vp against them, to vrge and accuse them, or the vgly appea∣rance of death shall af∣fright them, or the feare and horror of hell and damnation shall seeme to dismay them. Against

all which fearefull & dan∣gerous assaults of death, of sinne, & of Satan, here in this small Treatise are prouided & selected (out of the rich Armorie of the sacred Scriptures) se∣uerall and peculiar wea∣pons, and armour of proofe, both defensiue, & offensiue, both for the withstanding and resi∣sting, and also for the re∣pelling and quenching of all the fierie darts of the wicked. Now I haue bene bold to dedicate and of∣fer the same vnto your Ladiship, being moued thereunto, partly by the

sundry fauours receiued from your Ladiship by my selfe in particular, and partly by those gracious works of pietie and cha∣ritie wrought, and the great and manifold be∣nefits from time to time conferred by your Ladi∣ship, in and vpon the whole Towne or Parish in generall, ouer which God hath placed me, (though his most vnwor∣thy seruant & minister:) accept (I beseech you) this small present (being as the poore widdowes mite) which here I pre∣sume to offer vnto your

Ladiship, as a pledge and testimonie of my vnfei∣ned thankfulnesse. Al∣mightie God, (who is rich in mercie) grant that as you haue exten∣ded the bowels of com∣passion and mercie al∣waies for the relieuing and comforting of many his poore children: so also you may find abun∣dant mercie in the last day, & may be filled with ioy and comfort at the glorious appearing of his Son Christ Iesus. Amen.
