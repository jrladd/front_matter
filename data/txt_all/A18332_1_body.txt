MOST Illustrious, and Excellent Prince.
B. Aloysius Gonzaga your elder Brother, euen from his very first Child∣hood, gaue himselfe with so great ardour to Chri∣stian Religion and Piety, that about the eigh∣teenth yeare of his age, out of a desire to enter into the Society of IESVS, he yielded vp vnto Mar∣ques

Rodulph, who was in like manner his bro∣ther, all his ancient Dominion, and Fortunes. Where in a short time he attained to so singular a glory of excellent Vertue, and so great a name of Sanctity, as afterward Almighty God declared, by those miracles that were performed by his in∣tercession after his death. Therfore by the consent of all, he is to be accounted amongst those, whose liues as a common, and holsome document for Chri∣stian men, are committed to writing: vpon which consideration, this taske was imposed vpon me by my Superiours, to compose this booke of his life & conuersation. The which hauing now by Gods help finished, do sna the same vnto you (most Excellent Prince) and my request is, that you would giue me to vnderstand whether you would haue it published or no.
For although I make no doubt, but that it will much auaile to the increasing of zeale in men, and loe towards God, notwithstanding I thought it not fit for me to do so much, without knowled∣ge how your will stood affected therunto. Wherfore I offer and present it vnto you, vnto whome of right I ought, not only in respect of your propin∣quitie with him in bloud, wherin you are nearest allied, and the loue wherwith he did alwayes most singularly affect you; but also (which truly I make most account of) for that as in this degree of life in which you remaine, you may seeme to imitate the innocency and vertue of his mind: so far, as the Bishop of Brescia doubted not vpon a time to af∣firme that there was no cause why he should be so∣icitos of that part of his Diocesse (Most Excel∣lent

Prince) which was placed in your Domi∣nion; for so much as you, and your most prudent, and choyce Espouse Bibiana Pernestainia, did with most excellent examples of a commenabe life, and also with a gouerment full of Religion, and Piety, season the minds of those people that were subiect vnto you, with so much obseruance and de∣uotion towards God, that euen he made a great question, whether he was able to straine them vp to an higher pitch.
Therfore (Most Excellent Prince) accept this small gift, but such as according to my singular affection towards you, is giuen with a very wiling mind, and in this respect comfort, and recreate your selfe; to the end you may know, that men of your kindred do flourish, not only vpon earth in Military Ʋalour, and Amplitude of Dominion subiect to their power; but euen in Heauen also, with the glory of perfect Ʋertue, and Sanctimony.
