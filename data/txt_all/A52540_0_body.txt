May it please Your Majesty,
THis unhappy Posthumus was intended to kisse Your Majesties hand before the Authors death, but by some ill fate hath trewanted by the way, till now of late it came to me, who (having had a former acquaintance with it) in loyalty to Your Sacred Majesty, duty to my Countrey, and obedience to the Authors meaning, whom I had the honour to call Tutor) dare do no lesse than publish and present it; nor could I have abused this opportunity without a tacite condem∣nation of my self as accessory to this horrid Principle. The Dregs whereof hang too much in the heads of many mistaken moderate persons, and still continues lurking in corners, and building strong holds in secret and seditious Conventicles. And to give it an hono∣rable Pedigree, they make it of kin to that ancient frontispiece of the Common Laws of
England, Salus populi suprema Lex: Where, without doubt, the King in good manners must needs be understood in the first place as Head of the people, and in case our Division∣mongers shall take the King and people as distinct Estates, it can bear no other meaning than that the health and welfare of the peo∣ple is the strength of the King, who is the life of the Law: But their crooked constructions are like bad constitutions, that turn the best of meats into the worst of humors. And to give this popular principle the more formality and priviledge, it must be denizon'd by the Taile of that Serpent-Parliament (the memory whereof is only hap∣py in the Act of Oblivion) and laid up in their Journal as a per∣petual magazen for the fifth of November or a recruit in taile to the black and dismal day of our late Kings murder, Your Majesties Royal Father: Though our late combustions by Your Majesties Pro∣vidence and prudence are alayed for present, yet 'tis justly to be feared they will never be extinguished so long as this Principle hath
one spark of life or being in the hearts and heads of your Majesties subjects: To which the Author most humbly offers this expedient.
And if Your Majesty shall please to give a second life to him by a countenance of these lines with Your gracious acceptance, without doubt You will find them bear a very considerable part in Your Majesties Life-guard.
But my duty to him forbids me all Encomiums, knowing how little he loved them, and how much lesse he needs them. Now may it please Your Majesty, since Your Pardon hath prevented the utmost darings of all mens askings, I shall not be desperate of mine for assuming this boldnesse, being the real effect of a heart brim full of affection and loyalty to Your most Sacred Majesty, and upon that confidence shall presume to beg leave to write my self
