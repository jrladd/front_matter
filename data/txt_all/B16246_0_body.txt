TRuly Honourable, and Right Worshipfull, to you in duty this Dedication doth belong, who stand like Lyons about the Throne of our Salomon, to maintaine the Subiect in peace, and defend the Innocent from cruelty and oppression. Some of your cares and wisedomes haue detected a most cruell murther and conspi∣racie, and vindicated besides the honour of the Clergie from those scandals, which were shot from the sling of those Assassines, intentiuely a∣gainst Mr. Tratte, but consequently against all that sacred and super-eminent profession. Conti∣nue these good endeuours, & let the Sun-setting of your fauours, be like vnto their Sunne rising
 and Meridian, that vnder your protection and defence, the word of God, and the sword of Iu∣stice may worke together within the circuite of that flourishing County with perpetuall harmo∣nie, vnity, and agreement. Neuer was there more cause for the distressed Leuite to implore the help of the Princes of the people then now: The Aaro∣nicall & once budding rod of his Authority, be∣ing almost broken in peeces. His linnen Ephod being rent in sunder, and his sanctified brestplate of Vrim and Thummim, being pierced thorow with the malicious eiaculations of knowne ad∣uersaries, or the secret wounds of luke-warme professours and temporarie back-sliders. You are his Maiesties Deputies and Vicegerents; let his Character be your patterne, & let the irradiation of his example enlighten & leade you to the pro∣tection of the Clergy; and esteeme those wrongs done vnto them to be by so much the more of an offensiue nature and condition, by how much that most high and celestiall calling is lifted vp aboue the ordinary masse & multitude of man∣kinde. Thus desiring your Lordship & their Wor∣ships best cōstructions, & crauing pardon for my boldnes in this my Dedication, I leaue and rest
