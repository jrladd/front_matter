THere is nothing more obvious to Your Excellency; then that flattery and deceit are bred in the wombe of a de∣ceiving and a deceived heart. Which detains me from saying much, lest the world and You should look on me as such. Yet this I dare assert unto you, for encouragement, that You are the Angel mentioned Rev. 14.16. and none else is meant thereby but You. And that I deceive you not, I give the world and you this signe: That the Angel mentioned ver. 17. shall in a few years [it may be in a year or two] arise in one of our next neighbour Dominions, who like a Son of Thunder shall so terrifie the Popish world, and bring such a desolation on those deceived Nations, as hath not been since Man and Earth began to be.
Our misery, I hope, begins to draw to an end; one Woe more, and no more. The beginning of Gods return in mercy to us, will be a restoring the true Church-Estate amongst us, which shall be for the healing of the bruised Nations. Which, as a Balm most preci∣ous for this purpose, I make bold to present You with this small ensuing Form of Church-Government; praying God to give you understanding and a right judgment, to discern the truth hereof; And that He preserve you to, and blesse you for ever in himself, and his magnificent mercies.
