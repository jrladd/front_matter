My Lord,
AS it hath been matter of great Joy to all Devout Christians that God hath put it into the Heart of our most Reverend Primate of All England, to attempt the Revival of Primitive Piety, and the long Eclipsed Honour of our Saviour, by restoring a weekly Celebra∣tion of the Holy Sacrament in his Metropolitical Church: so I am confident it must needs be an extraordinary satis∣faction to the Regular Clergy of your own Diocess, where Conformity hath fluorished in a high measure (blessed be God) ever since the Restauration.
As I acknowledge it my Duty, my Lord, to render my self by all means, whether in season or out of

season, serviceable to God's Church, especially to the Jurisdiction under you, wherein his Providence hath placed me: so the due Obedience and Reverence I justly bear you, oblige me to dedicate to your Lordship the pains I have taken to promote a frequent Parochial Celebration of the Holy Communion; humbly beseeching your Lord∣ship to Countenance this seasonable performance of my Duty, and honest Design to quicken my Brethren in the faithful discharge of their Office.
And I do assure your Lordship, that I shall never En∣deavour to promote my own private Phantasies, either by adding to, or diminishing from the Established Laws of our Church; but as firmly as my weakness will per∣mit, shall strive to maintain that excellent Order and Discipline which the Publick Authority of the Church hath obliged us all unto; and as both your Self and Prede∣cessor have enjoyned me, I shall as strenuously and pru∣dently, as I am capable, administer the same, for the promotion of the true end thereof, the Glory of God and Salvation of those committed to my Care. Since, I know, I can neither do God, nor your Lordship, more real, and, I hope, more acceptable service, than in so doing.
That my Sermon (which was preached in my ordinary Course at the Cathedral) was never intended for the Press, will easily appear from the Examination of the Discourse it self; and that it was not Vanity, nor an Itch to be in Print, which was the motive to this Publica∣tion, will (I am persuaded) be readily granted by all

those, who consider that it carries with it, no Temptation to expose it to publick View, but some well meant Zeal, which in a Censorious Age is more apt to procure Contempt than Commendation.
Had I not in the Applicatory part (for the sake whereof I now set it forth) pressed with some earnestness the To∣pick of Conformity, and the chief part thereof, frequent Communion, (which to promote is the main design of this Application to my Brethren) it had never seen the Light at present. But having in the Conclusion of the Sermon set a Scheme of Conformity before the eyes of the Laity, as I have in my Letter to the Clergy, presented them with another belonging to Ecclesiasticks, I judged the Dis∣courses, not unfit to accompany, since they may strengthen, one the other.
As an honest desire to contribute to the Publick Good was my chief reason for publishing my Sentiments in these matters; so is it a considerable motive for my presuming in this manner to present them to your Lordship, that I may discharge my own Conscience, and demonstrate how much I am,
My Lord,
