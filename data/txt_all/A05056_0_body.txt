MADAME,
COnsidering with my selfe, that our nature is such, as we can∣not endure that these praises should be ascri∣bed vnto others (though they duly deserue them) which we thinke our selues worthy
 of (though indeed most vn∣worthy) I resolued with my selfe to commit this Sermon to the patronage of some one, who might bee able to defend the truth of it against the malicious traducing, and repining of the enuious, and amongst many, I could find none more fit then your selfe; partly because with MARY, you haue chosen the better part, and that (according to your name) your heart is the seat and temple of vertue: partly by reason of that long continued loue & familiarity which hath beene betweene you; as also because of that full experience, and true triall
 you had of her spotlesse con∣uersation: therefore pardon my boldnesse, and as you loue vertue, and haue the praises of this rare Iewell in∣closed in your breast: so let them haue your louing pro∣tection, and holy imitation, to your vnspeakeable com∣fort in this life, and the eter∣nall saluation of your owne soule in the life to come.
