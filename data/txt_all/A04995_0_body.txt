ALbeit, right Ho∣norable Sir; that my bounden Du∣tie towards you, aswell for the singular fa∣vour of my most Honorable Lord your Father, continu∣ally
 extended upon me, as al∣so for that cheerefull Re∣gard which it hath pleased your Selfe to vouchsafe un∣to me, might have moved me with the first, to gratulate unto You, that Honourable place wherunto you are right worthily advanced: Yet that J may not onely bewray my ioy thereof in vanishing words, but testifie it also with some more stāding Me∣moriall that might remain: J have purposely spared to see your Honour, untill that
 I might come accompanied with this Copie of mine Ar∣cheion, or Commentaries of the Courts of England; Whereof, some J penned sundrie yeeres sithence, o∣thers not long agoe, and the rest so lately, that your Ho∣nour may, if it please you, take the first view and rea∣ding of them; wherein if you shall finde either pleasure or profit, then shall I also both enioy the desire of my heart, and the expected fruit of my Travaile, And thus heartily
 praying GOD to increase your Honor with your yeers, that as you bee already by Nature the Sonne; so you may at the length by imita∣tion become the very Heire of that renowned Nestor, and onely Atlas of the Eng∣lish Countrie and Common∣wealth. I humbly pray you to pardon the escapes both of me and this Writer. From Lincolnes Inne this 22. of October, 1591.
