STarrs of this earthlie heaun, you whose essence
Composd was of mans purest quyntessence,
To you (to virtuous you) I dedicate
This snaggy sprigg, hew'd from a crabby pat
Wherein (Celestiali bewties) you shall see,
Howe old Diogynes extolleth yee.
We men, doe loue to see our selues vp-raisd
And Iocond are, o heare our own selues praisd
But (oh you springes of Wisdome) I doe find
That is a thing most hatefull to your kind.
Yet old Dogynes did see your worth,
Such worth hee sawe, as needes heed paint it forth.
Accept his loue; for all the Cynnicks deedes
Out of true zeale vnto your sex proceedes
With rev'rent zeale, as high as th'azurd skyes
Your virtuous deedes, the old man magnifies.
Contrary wise, he with a bitter penn
Invectivelie, doth write against bad men
Comaunding them, that what soe e're they doe,
They alwaies should example take by you.
Badd are these men, such is their perverse kind
They burne all bookes, wherein theire faults they find
And therefore (earthlie aungells) my desire
Is you'l protect this, from consuming fire.
