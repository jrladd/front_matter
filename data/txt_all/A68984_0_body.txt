RIght Hono∣rable,
It can∣not
bee vn∣knowne
to
your wisedomes, how pe∣rilous
a thing, both to the
Crowne, the Peeres, and
the Nobles; yea and to all
the parts of the common∣weath,
is the vngratious,
vngodly, yea, prophane,
& hellish humor of mur∣muring:
especially against
God, the king, or any their

ordeyned magistrates, in a
Kingdome: for the cure
wherof, what care is to be
taken, your discreet consi∣derations
can determine:
and knowing in your ho∣norable
dispositions, an as∣sured
hate vnto all such
vnpleasing and vnprofita∣ble
spirits, as no doubt, but
you wil weed, out frō the
good hearbs in the groūd
of your charge; and again,
how blessed a thing, the v∣niō
of harts wil be to your
honorable Spirits, whose
continual care of the pre∣seruatiō,

both of our king,
and his vvhole kingdom,
deserueth no little honor:
I haue presumed rather
vpō your honorable par∣dons,
of what may offend
your patience, then your
fauorable acceptāce of my
vnvvorthy seruice, to pre∣sent
your Honors vvith a
little tract against Mur∣murers
& murmuring, in
vvhich if I haue passed a∣nie
thing displeasing to
your good patience, hūb∣lie
crauing pardon, I attēd
the sorrovv of my Im∣perfection,

but if I haue in
any thing contented the
least of your good likings,
I will leaue murmurers to
the fruite of their malice,
and pray to God, so to
blesse your good minds,
that you may find out
such offendors, and giue
them the due of their de∣sert;
and in your selues, a∣mong
your selues, may be
so lincked in your loues,
that to God and his Ma∣iestie,
you may euer liue
togither in your seruice,

that when wickednes is
weeded out, and Grace is
planted in the place, God
may be pleased, the King
best preserued, and the
Common wealth best go∣uerned:
So fearing with
tediousnes, to be a trouble
to your good patience,
beseeching God to blesse
you al, with as much hap∣pines,
as murmurers are
worthy to want, I hum∣bly
rest.
