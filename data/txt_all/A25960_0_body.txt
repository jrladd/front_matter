Reverend, and my much Honoured good Friends,
COncerning the business, whereof I lately promised to give You some account by Writing, being a little strait∣ned in point of Time, I must crave Your pardon, if you find not that good method and order observ'd in the following Lines, which might have been wished, and that I presume to deliver my Thoughts to You in such an indigested manner, as I fear I shall be forc'd to do for want of time, that is to say, not in the form of a continued, and coherent Discourse, but of di∣stinct, separate Propositions, set down hastily, as Things come to mind. However, I think this Benefit may come of the course I intend, that delivering my self in this manner, you will, perhaps somewhat more distinctly, and particularly per∣ceive what my mind is, and what sense and apprenension of things I have: which I confess is the principal thing I aim at; as well to ease my own mind, as to understand what yours will be of the whole matter. I can hardly doubt, but in some things you will think me a little too apprehensive, and that I do overshoot my self in suspicion. But for that (Gentlemen) appealing to God for the sincerity of my profession herein, I think it sufficient to say, it is a case, wherein I had much ra∣ther be blam'd for want of Discretion, than for want of Affe∣ction: and so
I may be, though in never so low a degree, an occasion, or means, of preventing the sad mischief and trou∣ble, which I verily believe threatens this Church and King∣dom, from the practices of certain Men, who pretend Religi∣on much, but mind it least of all, I shall not be unwilling to be accounted a Fool, or
Mad-man, if need be.
As I have already told you, I can frame no particular ac∣cusation against any Person; but must confess, my Fears and apprehensions are only of dangers and ill practices in
general, and for the most part upon general presumptions and grounds: so that I cannot but doubt likewise, that this will be objected against me, and made a great argument by some to discredit what I say, Viz. that I do only suspect, and not prove. But let them make their advantage of it. I am content to lye under this censure too for a while, rather than that my Country should want the benefit of some timely admonition, and warn∣ing given them, to beware, how they suffer themselves to be practis'd upon, to their own and the publick ruine. Dangers of this nature must be fear'd, and apprehended, a little before they evidence themselves, or else God help us. For the satis∣faction (I hope) of all that will judge indifferently, it may suf∣fice, that with a clear conscience I can, and do appeal to God, the searcher of hearts, that I suggest nothing either by way of charge; suspicion, accusation, or otherwise, which I do not ve∣rily conceive my self to have
just and sufficient ground to sug∣gest, and to think, and speak of Things so as I do, either from their own printed Books, or from their private Writings (which I have at times seen, and transcribed for them) or from what I have
heard from their own mouths, or the mouths of their friends and confidents: except only some few things, which here and there
I collect, à paritate rationis, or by way of argument, from what I have undoubtedly heard, or observ'd from themselves, and from their Books, Writings, Mouths, respectively.
All that know, and duly consider how industrious this Party is, to pursue and promote their proper Interest, will (I doubt not) acknowledge this for a truth, That what they hold lawful to be done, they may be justly presum'd to do, whensoever opportunity serves, and that they see it conducible to their Interest to do it. Therefore to shew how they are principled in point of opinion, touching the lawfulness of the things here in ge∣neral charg'd upon them, or suspected of them, I shall not forget, in convenient place, to insert some few of their Ma∣ximes, serving to that purpose.
One thing I have yet farther to add, not in the quality of a
reason, to move others to regard what I say, (though it be, I confess, some little occasion of satisfaction to my self) but only because I judge it not improper to be imparted to you (my Ho∣noured Friends) and that I am particularly desirous to hear your opinion of it. It is this: That being my self a Roman Catholick, and frequenting the Sacrament of Confession, as Catholicks use to do,
I have had frequent occasion to mention these following matters, at least the general Heads of them, to my (then) Ghostly Fathers, as things that carried a semblance with them of very rash judgments against so great Superiours, and against Religious men, and upon that account as being mat∣ter of sin, or just scruple, to me. But neither could I ever hear any thing from them, that gave me the least satisfactory assu∣rance of the contrary, VIZ. That it was not in any sort so as I fear'd and suspected of them, (though they were Jesuits, for the most part, to whom I made my confession, and such Men as could easily have given me assurance, had they known it to be otherwise than I suspected:) neither could I ever find any Be∣nefit by confessing them. But though I have ever made it my earnest Prayer to God, and still do every day, that he would give me the grace to judge rightly and justly of all Men, and not to be transported with any
judgments, or suspicions con∣cerning others, contrary to Truth and Charity: Yet these still continue, and rather grow, and encrease upon me, than other∣wise, disquieting my mind, more or less, almost every day; being commonly the last things that leave me at Night, and returning with the first in the Morning. And this hath been my condition these many Years: Which seeing that my con∣science, on the other side, clears me from bearing any grudge, or offence of mind (upon my own, or any other Man's account) to wards any Person, or Persons living; and that even in re∣lation to those, whom in the general I cannot but think and suspect to be very faulty, I find not my self otherwise affected, than most truly to love, honour, and respect them for their
Calling and Characters sake. I cannot but for this reason also a little the more yield to my own fears, and think, that in
fearing and judging so as I do, my fear is not altogether with∣out cause, nor my judgment much contrary to Truth and Cha∣rity. However, such as they are, in order to receive your further Counsel and Direction concerning them,
I take the Boldness to present them to You, in the plain Form that followeth.
