YOur Maiesties most blessed deli∣uery by the power of God from that bloodie Diluge of PERTH, and this Fierie Doomesday of BRITAINE, being to all your people a cause of Gods euerla∣sting praise, & their present ioy, as the multitude made shewe by their Bonefires, whose earthly smokes in great measure ascended the heauenly regions. It hath kindled such a Bone∣fire in the furnace of my breast, as must needes bee knowne to your Maiestie; whose Builder is an in∣ward worker, whose Fewell is Affection, whose flames may well warme, but neuer harme you: and the more you anneere them, the more tem∣perate shall you finde them, comforting such as loue you, and consuming such as hate you: whose gleames I haue made first to glance on your Maie∣sties selfe, secretly and vnsigned; as being vnwor∣thy
(though they should euen please you) to pre∣sent them; much lesse to come in your presence, if they should offend: leauing to your Maiesties most royall and vpright iudgement, as you finde my Fire well built, to set it where you will haue it seene: or being fallen from his grounds, more for∣mally to reedifie it: or if of too grosse materialls, to purge the drossie errors of it: or if nothing of it like you, by a breath of your Maiesties mouth vtterly to extinguish it. Doe as you please (Sir) for so long as I liue shall I euer loue you. Your Deliuerer be alwaies with you. From towards the con∣fines of your Maiesties Canaan, Tuesday, Doomesday 5. Nouember. 1605.
