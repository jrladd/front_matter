HAd I not fully known (most incomparable Princesses) by a long experience in your most Royal Family, that Clemency; Mercy and Par∣don, were your apparent Birth-rights, by Lineal Traduction from your great Pro∣genitors, especially from that glorious
Martyr for his people, your most Royal Father of eternal memory, and that in∣comparable Confessor your blessed Mo∣ther, (whose sufferings for her King and Conscience deserve to be written with a Pen of Adamant, in the Temple of Eter∣nity) I had not dared to address these poor home-spun Papers, wrought by true spinsters hands, to your most Prince∣ly view, much less present them as a New-years-gift, or make them to ap∣pear in the world, under so great a Pa∣tronage. Now the greatest aggravations (most Seraphical Sisters) that can be al∣ledged against me, are: First, that I should presume to present any thing, that carries with it the scratching of womens controversies, (for so most of their di∣sputes do usually determine) or that does so much as sound like a jar, to such se∣rene Pacifick spirits, as your highborne souls are known to be, whose very looks are capable to quiet the most tempestu∣ous and troubled seas, and words to calm the rage of Tygers, and the fury of the most tumultuous and stormy breasted Monsters of Mankind, in whose bosome the very Unicorn would be am∣bitious
to fall asleep, and Lions them∣selves rejoyce to lick your Princely feet. Nay, that I should dare to offer so much as the sound of a Duel to two such sub∣lime Personages, and that are so much one in affection, though different it may be in some perswasion; and are by that great example of your most serene Mother the Grand Mistreses of Peace, Piety, Mo∣desty and Humility to all Womankind. But indeed my fault is not so grievous in this neither, as at first blush it may appear to be, for this Paper Duel is with∣out a disturbance. This Scripture Com∣bate without a quarrell, and this fair di∣spute is almost without a difference, I am sure without an uncivil word, and though it was managed (as can be proved) only by women, yet it may serve to direct in∣to the true mode, and method of arguing, the most dextrous Doctors, and Dispu∣tants in the world, and teach them to improve their arguing unto edification. But the greatest aggravation (most excel∣lent Ladies) that ca rise in judgement against me, is yet behind, (as Timourus Penitents use to have their most crying sins to bring up the Rear) which is that
I should presume to present any actions of inferiour Persons, as Looking-glasses to their Princes, especially to such as you (most incomparable Pair) are known to be; your selves being the matchless Mirrours of all perfection. Mirrours said I? nay, most pure and Christialine Foun∣tains that shew not only to all the La∣dies in the world, their deformed spots, stains and blemishes, but likewise how to wash them off, and wherewithall to clear themselves from them: which truth has been most plainly proved and confirmed to us, by that strange and almost mira∣culous reformation of our Womens man∣ners, since the splendor of your most Princely vertues, has appeared amongst them, for which I am sure both Sexes do owe most immortal obligations, to your Royal Highneses, as for a new Conver∣sion of the Nation. Nay, give me leave to affirm, that the blessings we have re∣ceived in order to that, ought to be put into the Balance with any of those other great ones, that is Sacred Majesty has been so graciously pleased, to power down upon us in his comming to us, and re∣demption
of us from a life of sin and sla∣very. For truely the Mankind here were not depraved into Sedition, Treason, Rebellion and Irreligion, turning all faith into faction, making truth it self to lye, all Loyally to be Treason, Religion to be Rebellion, and pulling down of Church∣es, the edification of Gods house, by any instigation so great, as that they received from their wicked women. The Seas were less furious, a Thunder-clap less dread full, the gall of Dragons and poyson that swelleth up the necks of Asps, was much more tolerable, than their malice. Nor were they only so guilty in making of their Husbands become Traytors to their God, King and Coun∣trey, but they did study likewise to ap∣pear as unnatural Traytors to the honour of their whole Sex in England (which was as famous as St. Paul magnifies the faith of the Romanes to be spoken of over all the world) flying out into such prodi∣gious pieces of impiety and debaucht lewdness, that Heathens themselves have abhorred, and very Turks trembled at. From all these horrid infamies, and na∣tional
scandalls, your very presence here has ransomed our Countrey; and by your all healing examples set a new fair, and reformed face upon all our Woman∣kind. The one being the highest Patro∣ness of all conjugal and vidual Honor, and the other the most pure pattern of all Virginal sweetnesse and chastity, and both appear to be no lesse, than two Intelligences that have left the Heavenly Orbes, and vouchsafed your selves to be inchased in those beautifull bodies for the benefit, and glory of your Sex. To whom therefore could this Ladies Looking-glass be more properly presented, than to your Royal High∣nesses, to whom all that is good in the whole Sex amongst us, must be ever attributed, as Rayes only re∣flected from your perfections. This is my humble Plea, most incompa∣rable Princesses, according to which joyned with my clear acknowledge∣ment, and most dutiful Confession I doubt not, but your Princely good∣ness
will proceed to absolution, and dispense a pardon to
