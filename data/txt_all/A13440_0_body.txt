RIGHT Gracious Prince, (I your humble Vassall) beeing im∣boldened by your innated gene∣rous acceptation of all good in∣deauours, to present your High∣nes with this poore piece of a shadow of the sub∣stantiall perills that I haue escaped, which for my part had neuer beene published, but that it was falsly printed without my knowledge; which for the regard I haue to the truth and mine owne Credit, I could doe no lesse then contradict with a Refutation of falshood. I humbly implore
your Highnes to bestow your gracious reading of the infallible verity of the truth, which if you vouchsafe, you shall therein see Gods power manifested when man is at the weakest. So wishing your High∣nes all earthly and hea∣uenly felicity, I remaine.
