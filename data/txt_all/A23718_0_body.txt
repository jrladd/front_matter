Mr. Garthwait,
I Need not tell you with what success you published the Ex∣cellent Treatise, The whole Duty of Man: It is your Feli∣city to be again instrumental to the profit of this Church and Nation, by your Edition of these Religious and Prudent Instructions. And although the Address be not so Universal in this, as in the for∣mer; yet this will have a large influence upon other Conditions besides Gentle∣men: Their Converse, if reformed, will be exemplary, and operative upon others. A Gentry that would afford an obedient Ear to these Admonitions, and a Clergy that would to Piety and Learning, joyn Humility, Modesty, and Sobriety, will be the best Humane means to recover this sinful Nation, and oppressed Church, from the miseries, Spiritual and Civil, under which we now groan. So that the Argument is well chosen, and it is so managed, that I know not what a Reader that is somewhat morose can desire,

which is not here. The Author keeps close to his intended province and design, his Reasons are sinewy and convincing, his Reproofs are severe and grave, yet pleasing; and they whom he chides, must needs love him. There is nothing in his Periods redundant or defective; he hath a Native Elegancy that invites his Reader; variety of Learning couch∣ed, not vaunted; and a Perspicuity such, as will make his Reasonings appear to a weak Eye: A Manual which is enriched with all these Graces, shall (I trust) not onely be frequently and attentively per∣used, but that it will lively affect, and sit close to the Reins, and penetrate the Heart of the Reader, especially that Reader for whom it is designed; and for this Blessing on the Gentry, it is our Duty to sollicite the Divine Goodness.
SAR. 27 Octob. 1659.
