Right Honorable Lord,
SO sensible am I of the Exceptions and Clamours of divers people, who some of weaknesse, others of wickednesse, cry out against our present Powers in generall, as Usurpers, or however, as unlawful or un∣just, wanting (as they say) warrantable grounds, and foundations, viz. the Peoples free choice, which should they passe without answering, would confirm and im∣bolden them in their Clamours as just, and render your Honor, with the rest of our worthy Governours, and Souldiery, of all sorts, as unjust Usurpers, and wrong do∣ers, and so may in time hearten to Factioning and Re∣bellion, even to hostility, to the disturbance and endan∣gering of our Nation; all which to remedy, I the mean∣est of all, am inforc't through the silence of all, to un∣dertake, which I will assure your Honor, I do with re∣missenesse and feare, by reason of divers Tenets held and handled therein, contrary to what's held at this time, and that by those accounted both good and wise. But I forbeare to be further offensive to your Honor by enlargement, I therefore only make bold humbly to in∣treat your Honors fairest construction of my well-meant endeavours, and so I rest

Aug. 1653.
