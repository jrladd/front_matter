SIR, the care of my affection, in regard of your kindnesse, hath made me (of late, walking thorow the Gar∣den of many good Wri∣ters) togather a few FLOWERS, which I here present to the good fauour of your discretion: they are but few, the sooner loo∣ked ouer, but perhaps of such Vertue as may (wel considered) be nothing to your dislike.

Such as they bee, I leaue them to the per∣using of your good leisure, and their vse to your best liking: which, with my selfe, I wish to bee happie in your good fauour. And so leauing ceremonious Eloquence, I rest in more affection than protestation,
