Honoured SIR,
I Never pretended to be good at any thing; of this I am sure, I am now bad at Limning; my old Pencil, and decay'd Colours will not do; and besides, I have no daring hand, so that should I offer at a Picture I should wrong the Person. Really Sir, It is the sense of my own Weakness that frights me from attempting to celebrate your Worth: and the Truth is, it is in vain to light a Candle before the Sun; it is lost Labour to praise him whom all admire; it is ill spent pains to gild a Diamond, or paint a Ruby red.
This I can truly say, That since I had the Happiness to know you, I have had an Ambition to serve you, and 'twas that which
made me not dispute, but readily obey your Commands, when I understood you designed me for the Pulpit the last Assize. What I then preached, I am (by unanswerable Im∣portunity) even forced (much against my own Genius) to print.
Censures I expect to meet with, (why should I think to fare better than my Bet∣ters?) but I shall not much regard them; for my Comfort is, that no one can have meaner Thoughts of me than I have of my self, and being already on the Ground I can fall no lower than the Grave; which, by reason of my many Indispositions, I daily ex∣pect. That your worthy self, your truly ver∣tuous Lady, and the two young Gentlemen, your hopeful Sons, may have all the Happi∣ness that Heaven can give both here and hereafter, is the hearty Prayer of
Buckland, March 29. 1682.
