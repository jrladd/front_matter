My Lord,
THough I be not ignorant of your Lordships aversness from all addresses of this kinde, (whether it be that your Lordship has taken notice of that usual vanity of those that dedicate Books, in endeavouring to oblige their Patrons by over-lavish praises, such as much exceed the worth of the party they thus unmeasurably com∣mend; or whether it be from a natu∣ral modesty that cannot bear, no not so much as a just representation of your own vertues and abilities; or lastly, from a most true observation, that there are very few Treatises writ which are any thing more then meer Transcriptions or Collections out of

other Authors, whose Writings have already been consecrated to the Name and Memory of some other worthy Persons long since deceased; so that they doe but after a manner rob the dead, to furnish themselves with Pre∣sents to offer to the living) Yet not∣withstanding this averseness of your Lordship, or whatever grounds there may be surmised thereof, I could not abstain from making this present De∣dication. Not so much I confess to gratify your Lordship (though it be none of the best Complements) as for mine own satisfaction and content. For I doe not take so great pleasure in any thing as in the sense and conscience of the fitness & sutableness of mine own actions; amongst which I can finde none more exactly just & befitting then this; there being many considerations that give you a peculiar right and title to the Patronage of this present Dis∣course. For besides your Lordships

skill in Philosophy & real sense of Pie∣ty, two such endowments as are rarely to be found together (especially in Per∣sons of high quality) and yet without which matters of this nature can nei∣ther be read with any relish nor easily understood; there are also other things still more peculiar, & which naturally doe direct and determine me to the choice I have made. For whether I consider the many civilities from your self & nearest Relations, especially from your noble & vertuous Lady, whom I can never think on but with admira∣tion, nor mention without the highest respect: or whether I recollect with my self the first occasion of busying my thoughts upon this Subject, which was then when I had the honour and pleasure of reading Des-Cartes his Pas∣sions with your Lordship in the Gar∣den of Luxenburg to pass away the time, (In which Treatise though there be no∣thing but what is handsome and wit∣ty,

yet all did not seem so perfectly solid and satisfactory to me but that I was forced in some principal things to seek satisfaction from my self:) or lastly, call to minde that pleasant re∣tirement I enjoyed at Ragley during my abode with your Lordship; my civil treatment there, from that perfect and unexceptionable pattern of a truly No∣ble & Christian Matron, the Right Ho∣nourable your Mother; the solemness of the Place, those shady Walks, those Hills & Woods, wherein often having lost the sight of the rest of the World, and the World of me, I found out in that hidden solitude the choicest The∣ories in the following Discourse: I say, whether I considered all these cir∣cumstances, or any of them, I could not but judge them more then enough to determine my choice to so worthy a Patron.
Nor could the above-mentioned surmises beat me from my design, as

not at all reaching the present case. For as for my part, I am so great a Lover of the Truth, and so small an Admirer of vulgar Eloquence, that neither the presage of any gross Advantage could ever make me stoop so low as to ex∣pose my self to the vile infamy or suspicion of turning Flatterer, nor yet the tickling sense of applause & vain∣glory, to affect the puffy name & title of an Orator. So that your Lordp might be secure as touching the first surmise.
And verily for the second, though I confess I might not be at all averse frō making a just & true representation of your Lordships Vertues and Accom∣plishments, yet considering the great∣ness of them, & the meanness of mine own Rhetorick, I found it not so much as within my power, if I would, to en∣trench upon your Lordships modesty; and therefore I must leave it to some more able Pen to do you & the World that right whether you will or no.

And lastly, for that scruple concer∣ning the theft or petty sacriledge of se∣veral Plagiaries, who, as it were, rob the Monuments of the dead to adorn the living; it is the onely thing that I can without vanity profess, that what I of∣fer to your Lp is properly my own, that is to say, that the invention, application and management of the Reasons and Arguments comprised in this Book, whether for confutation or confirma∣tion, is the genuine result of my own anxióus and thoughtful mind, no old stuff purloined or borrowed from other Writers. What truth & solidity there is in my Principles and Reasonings were too great a piece of arrogance for me to predetermine. This must be left to the judgements of such free & discerning spirits as your Lordship: With whom if what I have writ may find acceptance or a favourable censure, it will be the greater obligation & encouragement to,
My Lord,
