ELect Ladie, it was the saying of Dauid, The righteous shall bee had in euerlasting remembrance, Psal. 112. 6. and of Salomon, That the memoriall of the iust shall bee blessed, Prou. 10. 7. These two Scriptures haue much encouraged me, to penne and print this Sermon following; and your entire loue to your louing husband departed, hath emboldened me (with hope of accepta∣tion) to present it to your Ladie-ship, as a picture at all times to put you in mind of his godly life and conuersation, that in these perilous and luke-warm times, when zeale growes cold, and fewe or none labour to draw on others, and en∣courage others to runne the wayes of Gods commandements, when you shall
 at any time behold this picture, you may be prouoked and stirred vp (as you haue begunne well) so to perseuere and pro∣ceede on, and grow more and more in grace. The eternall God of heauen com∣fort you, euen as he hath afflicted you, and that God crowne both you and yours with his best blessings. So prayes still,

Canham, Octob. 24. 1618.
