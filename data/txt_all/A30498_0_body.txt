Christian Reader,
ANother Letter coming to our hands subcribed J. T.
the tendency thereof being to beget a dislike in R. L.
(to whom it was writ) to the Principles of Truth,
as prosessed by us the truly reformed Christians, called Qua∣kers,
and to prevent the writing of more such, occasion'd
our making thus publick the following Answer to Priest
Potts's Letter; and the rather, understanding the said J.
T. saw it, and takes no notice thereof in his, although it
answers the substance thereof, excepting in these following
particulars.
1. His accounting it an Errour in us not to swear.
Ans. We in short say, we have Christs Command for not
Swearing, Matt. 5. 3, 4. Swear not at all: and second∣ed
by the Apostle, James 5. 12. which we believe ought
to be observed by all Christians.
2. He charges us with denying the Trinity, as he terms it.
Ans. We do really own the Three that bear record in Hea∣ven,
the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost, and these
Three are One, Joh. 5. 7. and we also own the Three
that bear witness in Earth, the Spirit, the Water and the
Blood, and these Three agree in One, as ver. 8. and so we
do and always did believe, according to the holy Scriptures.
3. He charges us with denying the Scriptures to be the
Word of God.
Ans. We believe the Scriptures to be what they call
themselves, a Testimony or Declaration, as in Luke 1. 1.
Joh. 5. 39. but Christ we own and believe to be the Word of
God, according to Joh. 1. and Rev. 19. 13. so we own the
Word of the Lord that came unto the Prophets, saying, as
in Ezek. 7. 1. and in divers othes places; and we own
and believe the Sayings of the Word, as recorded in the ho∣ly
Scriptures: so the Word that came unto the Prophets
was the Sayer, or that which spoke unto them, and the Scri∣ptures
are the words or sayings which the Word (or Spi∣rit
of Christ) spoke unto (and through) the Prophets; as
is evident from the Testimony of the Apostle, 1 Pet. 1.
10, 11.
