Most Gratious and dread Soveraign:
WHen I behold the prodigious preposture and confusion which reigneth in your Ma∣jesties Dominions (where servants ride on horse-back, and Princes walk on foot; where subjects are clavered up into the Kings Throne, and the King debased below the condi∣tion of a free-born subject) me thinks the wisdome and goodnesse of God (whose castigations of his children are his ordinary Heraulds to proclaime his Commands of Reformation) doth by these sacrilegious usurpations upon your Majestyes Sacred Prerogatives, (which have produced these National calamities wherein your Ma∣jesty is the principal sufferer) Intimate a National guilt of the like usurpation upon the more Sacred Preroga∣tives of God (wherein your Majesty, to whom God hath delegated the Supream Authority, hath been (in a Legal construction) the principal actor) and that God hath permitted your Majestyes subjects to possesse themselves of your Throne, and act as Kings in those things, where∣unto

no King did ever by any Commission Authorize a subject, because Your Majesty hath formerly possessed your self of Gods Throne, and acted as a God in those things, whereunto God did never by any Commission Authorize a King. Pardon (I beseech Your Majesty) my audacious and rude expressions (extorted from my pen by the Nature of the matter charging the guilt up∣on Your most Sacred Majesty of a Crime, whereof, I dare be deposed Your Majesty was never any way con∣scious. For the most Sacrilegious Champions of these times, have experimented Your conscientious resolu∣tions to be so compleatly postur'd in the Militia of San∣ctity and Religion, that neither their fiercest assaults, nor subtillest temptations could ever make them accessory to the least thought of alienating those things, which Your Majesty did believe to be made Sacred only by the Tem∣porary dedication of men: which is an obvious and evident Demonstration to the world, how horrid and abominable the very thought of a Sacrilegious Intrusion would be to Your Majesty, (if rightly understood) upon those Divine prerogatives which were made Sacred by Gods own institution, from the foundation of the world. And that therefore Your Majestyes Aberrations in this kind, have been Circumstantiated with no lesse innocen∣cy of soul, no lesse zeal to the glory of God, the pro∣sperity of his Church, and the Spiritual welfare of his and Your people, then the Resolutions of David were for building the Temple, or of Uzzah for saving the Ark of God. So that I cannot but expect these unex∣pected expressions to breed an amazement in Your Ma∣jesty; for prevention whereof, I shal in plain termes de∣clare what I understand this Sacriledge to be: And that is,
All usurpation of Power over conscience in the enact∣ment of Lawes and Statutes for the Regulation thereof in matters which are not of Political cognisance; And under the sanction of Personal or Pecuniary mulcts to enjoyn a Nati∣onal conformity in confession of Evangelical and Christian Faith, and in Evangelical and Christian forms of worship, Government, and Discipline.
Which were neither dutyes, nor indeed things in rerum Natura, when Politique Government did first receive it's Institution from God; and therefore cannot be di∣rectly of Politique cognizance, nor any fundamentall or Essential part of the object of Politique Government; as the tenth Chapter of the second Book doth more clearly manifest.
The design of which Chapter (being the due limi∣tation of the Kings Power in ordine ad extra Regalia & Metapolitica;) And of the subsequent Chapter (being the due extension of the subjects obedience in ordine ad Regalia & Politica) were the principal Inducements that gave life unto this present discourse, and is indeed a ser∣vice whereunto I do acknowledge my self able to bring more zeal and good affection then any other abilities: yet I could not chuse but (like Balaams Asse) Imploy the utmost of my pore endeavours to secure both my Ma∣ster and his subjects from the fierce wrath of that angry Angel, which me thought I saw standing in the way with a drawne sword in his hand, ready to take venge∣ance for both their sacrilegious exorbitances: And there∣upon resolved rather to hazard the crushing of my Masters foot against the wall of worldly reputation by an humble and dutiful representation of his errour (which I knew to be committed in the Innocency of his soul) then by an undutiful silence or palliation thereof, to

prompt or permit him (quantum in me) to gallop on into mischiefes (in my apprehension) destructive both to his temporal and Spiritual welfare.
Sr, God is my record, I do not plead this exemp∣tion of Conscience from the Iurisdiction of Regal Po∣wer, for mine own sake; out of any designe that I have thereout to suck the least advantage unto my self, either by gaining a toleration to professe or act contrary to any Law, Statute, or Ecclesiastical Canon; enjoyning a con∣formity in these Evangelical duties. (For I do acknow∣ledge mine own conscience so fully satisfyed, concer∣ning the Orthodoxnesse of the Faith professed, the Re∣ligion of the formes of worship practised, the warranta∣blenesse of the Ecclesiastical Government established, and the Comodiousnesse of the Ecclesiastical Discipline exercised in the Church of England, (as to my self, and all others of my perswasion) in the Reign of queen Elizabeth; Your Royal Father, and Your Sacred self (til these late years of frenzie) that mine own Conscience would witnesse all such designes in me, to be designes for gaining a toleration (not to be Conscientiously de∣vout and pious, but) onely to be unconcionably pro∣fane, licentious, and Atheistical;) Or yet by engratia∣ting my self with any of the Spurious Grandees of these times, (who now soare aloft in the highest Region of Pomp and Magnificence, through a supportment from those feathers which they have with Sacrilegious hands pluck't from your Majesties wings: And (like ambiti∣ous Icarus) have Artificially cemented and fastened the same unto their own armes with the wax of Serpentine Policy; which (me thinks) I see ni danger every mi∣nute to be dissolved and melted by the heat of Gods Wrath and Fury against their Sacrilegious exorbitances,

and themselves (in danger to be precipitated (like that ambitious Aspirer) into a sea of perdition and mi∣sery.)
For (Notwithstading I do professe the concurrence of my own judgement with theirs (concerning the ju∣stice and Religion of the desires of such, who out of an innocent zeal do seek the liberty of Conscience in the exercise of those dutyes which are not directly and perse of Politicall cognizance; That so (after Pauls example, Acts 24.) they may preserve their Consciences void of offence towards God, though the way and forme whereby they worship that God, may be censured for He∣resie; (and that happily also, not unjustly) in the judge∣ment of other men ▪ yet) I hope both my precedent pra∣ctises and my pen at present, will sufficiently attest my detestation of their Illegall and Impious practises, to compasse these Legal, honest, & warrantable desires; and thereby Vindicate the innocency of my thoughts from all such unworthy Sycophancy and Temporizement. For The searcher of all hearts knowes, that when I first put pen to paper for the composure of this dis∣course, I did expect to make mine account for the same in another world; (where there is no hope to find any place for such Pusillanimous Arts and Insi∣nuations) before it should be exposed to the censure of this.
So that my onely designe in arguing for this pre∣heminence of Conscience above all Regal Power and Authority in order to these Evangelicall and superna∣turall dutyes, was the discharge of mine own Con∣science, in my last (as I then supposed) office of duty and service to Your Majesty and my fellow subjects, by an humble representation of the dangerous (though

I wel hope, Innocent) Aberrations of both; For in dis∣eases springing from a cause of that nature; tam ultimus quam primus ad sanitatem gradus est novisse morbum. And therefore my purpose was (out of a sense of my duty towards Your Majesty and my countrey, who have so just a Title to any service of mine, which may be any way conducent to Your happinesse and welfare) to be∣queath (as a Legacy) unto each of You, a Soveraign Recipe, proper for the cure of each of Your present distempers. And to that purpose,
1. To Indigitate the  unto Your Majesty, that so Your Majesty might act in the dutyes of Your Sacred calling within Your proper sphere, without any sacrilegious Intrusion upon the Sacred Rights and pre∣rogatives of God.
2. To Indigitate the  unto my fellow subjects, that so they might act in the dutyes of their calling within their proper sphere, without any sacrile∣gious Intrusion upon the Sacred Rights and preroga∣tives of Your Majesty.
And that so both Your Majesty might permit Your subjects to enjoy those Immunities, And Your sub∣jects permit Your Majesty to enjoy those preroga∣tives, which neither can deny unto other without guilt of sacriledge.
And this indeed was the very scope and designe of the whole Treatise, which though it be ultimum execu∣tione, and obtained the last place in my Book (the common fate of all ends) yet was Primum Intentione, and had the first place in my thoughts; So that whatso∣ever is spoken in the former book of this Treatise (concerning the Divine Right of Natural Government and the severall species thereof) or in the latter book

(concerning the Divine Right of Monarchie (the onely Legitimate and Natural spece of Politique Govern∣ment,) and the several acceptions thereof) was but in∣tended for an Introduction to facilitate the true under∣standing of those precautionary Muniments against these two sacrilegious Intrusions, which are the sub∣ject of the four last Chapters of the second book, treating of Monarchie in its last and Theologicall ac∣ception.
I hope my discourse will not be offensive to Your Majestyes great Councell of State, or the learned Law∣yers of either Tribe, because it endeavoureth to make Divinity speak the Prerogative of the King, and liberty of the subject. For though some Ignaros pretend these things to be the peculiar businesse of Statsts & Innes of courtmen, & not of schollers & churchmen: yet the more learned sort are not Ignorant, that all municipal Lawes are or ought to be grounded upon the Externall part of the Morall Law (which is the direct & proper object of Politique Government, and which is the just bounds and limits of all humane Power and Authority, whe∣ther Ecclesiastical or civil;) And therefore will not cen∣sure the pen of a Divine treating of Monarchical duties, to rove Extra crepidam. For there is no case in the Ci∣vil or Common Law which is not reducible unto some precept of the Morall Law, and therefore must needs be capable of a Theological, as well as of a Political cognizance; and to be made a case of Conscience, as well as a Case in Law. At officiis quis Idoneus istis? It is onely the narrownesse of our sufficiency, and not of our profession, which secludes the Interest of Divines from any humane concernments, whether of Religion or justice. I confesse the Externall sanction (which is

the coercive part of a Law or Statute) to be peculiar unto their Politicall cognizance. But the fundamental and directive part of that Law or Statute is no lesse of our Theologicall cognizance then of their Poli∣ticall.
For it is manifest by Chronologie of Scripture that there was a King and a Priest, (the one to Rule, the o∣ther to direct;) many hundreds of years before there was a Lawyer in the world, and that both the Regall & Sacerdotal office and dignity were conjoyned in one person, viz: MelchiZedeck, who was of greater Anti∣quity, then Noah's flood; after whose death (within lesse then one hundred yeares) this Legislative honour (I do not mean that which relates to Power and Au∣thority, and is peculiar unto Kings: But that which re∣lates to advice and Councell, and is an honour whereof subjects are capable) is by Jacobs prophesie entayled upon the Tribe of Levi, (as well as the Sacerdotall ho∣nour) untill Shiloh come. And therefore I hope they have no cause to be angry that I plead this near affinity of their profession with Theologie. And surely if those smatterers in State-Policy (whose Ignorance makes them apt to carp) were as much masters in the myste∣ries of their own Art, as Bodin, Berclay, and other lear∣ned Lawyers have been who have writ of this subject, they would acknowledge Divinity (and more peculiarly the Holy Scriptures themselves) to afford a more exact and compleat model of Monarchie, and more perfect Rules of Government and obedience, then can be cul'd out of the writings either of Aristotle, Plato, Xenophon, Cicero, Livie, Tacitus, Bracton, Moor, Smith, or any o∣ther Grecian, Romane, or English Polititian; who by act or story have been most renowned in this way.
To exhibit a glimps of which truth, I have purposely endeavoured to confine my pen within that Sacred Cir∣umferancce (in a manner) through my whole discourse of Monarchie: The defects whereof do not proceed from any barrennesse or unaptnesse in the soyl, to bear a crop of this kind of grain, answerable to the expecta∣tion of the most Criticall Statist, but meerly from the insufficiencies of the Husbandman, whose Indexterity hath reaped this sorrie Crop, out of that fruitfull and Luxuriant soyl.
And to the intent Your Majesty may take a super∣ficiall survey of the whole Treatise; I have thereunto prefixed a briefe Analysis, representing both the summe and Method of the same, purposely thereby to direct Your Princely eye unto that part which Your Majesty shall judge worthy Your perusal, though indeed the part, which above others I designed for that honour, was the tenth Chapter of the second book; in the penning whereof, I had a more particular eye upon Your Maje∣styes Immediate service, then in any other: Because I conceived the subject thereof (being the due limitation of Regal Power in ordine ad extra regalia) to be of the most Immediate concernment to Your Majesty.
And thereupon also presumed that it would not dis∣gust Your Majesty, although it was served up from the hands of an unskilful Cook, no way gifted for seasoning a discourse to relish a Palate, so exquisitely judicious as I know Your Majesties to be. Onely my former ex∣perience of Your Majesties gracious indulgence (in vouchsafing me the honour to tast of such homely fare as my rude pen and fancy (which Nature did never ap∣tate for courtly flourishes of wit or eloquence, the proper food for Princely eyes) have made an Extemporary pro∣vision

of) hath grounded a confidence in me to present unto Your Majesty this unpolish'd publication of mine own judgment, in a busines so far transcending my mean abilities, that I prognosticate a necessity of my betraying much weaknesse & insufficiency therein; which I resolve rather to expose to the worlds censure, then to betray the least want of duty or affection to the service of a Ma∣ster who hath honoured me with so high a trust as sometimes Your Majesty was pleased to repose in me: whereof (I conceive) I could not shew my selfe any way more unworthy, then by my silence in a businesse (seem∣ing to my apprehension) of so great importance to Your Majesties present and future happinesse.
And therefore to insinuate the promptitude and de∣votion of my soul, to make true payment unto Your Majesty of my due debt of duty and service, surmount∣ing the proportion of ten thousand Talents (though the summa totalis of my abilities did never equiva∣liZe) account to one hundred pence) I have compiled this trifling Treatise, for the Patrocination whereof I have presumed to make my addresses to Your most Sa∣cred Majesty. For though I know nothing wherefore it should find acceptance or entertainment in the world either for its own sake, or its Fathers; yet I doubt not but the Relation of so Illustrious and eminent a God-Father may put an estimate upon it in those eyes, from which it could never otherwise expect an auspi∣cious glance.
But lest I should adde the irksomnesse of Im∣pertinent prolixity unto my other innumerous exor∣bitances; I will conclude these Dedicatory addresses with that short Petition which Your Majestyes cu∣stomary Indulgence hath taught me to ask, viz:

That what Your Majesty shall herein find to be ill spo∣ken, you would be gratiously pleased to interpret to be well meant, By
From my Close Pri∣son in the Tower,
9. Sept. 1647.
