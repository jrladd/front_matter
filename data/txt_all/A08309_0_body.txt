ALthough (Right Honour∣able) I haue beene forced, to struggle with want, the vn∣pleasant companion of In∣dustrious desires, and haue long sustained foyle, infor∣ced neglect of my purposed busines, and sorrow of my working spirit. It may yet now at the length please the high guide of Noble affections to moue your Honour to effect what you haue begun: And as your hand hath happily led the way, your good worde may as

easilye accomplish the worke of my newe reioy∣cing. And the rather for that mine Inde∣uours in this generall businesse sprang from your Honourable good liking. In regard wher∣of I am not in dispaire, but that my wythering hope shall be refreshed againe, with the dew of your powerfull helping hand, I haue vnder your patience and protection, vpon some reason∣able ground, exhibited this simple preparatiue vnto the worlds view. And as I shall finde the same to answere your good opinion especi∣ally: So perforce will my heart and hand fal∣ter and fayle me, or fulfill what is hid in vn∣seene desires.

Miseria mentem macerat.
