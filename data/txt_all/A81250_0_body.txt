Noble Sir,
TO whom more properly (under that Grand Councell of the King∣dome, whereof you are a Mem∣ber) doth the Dedication of these sudden thoughts belong, then to your Worthy self, who wrought with God on that day, the Salvation whereof, these poor la∣bours, together with a more skilfull hand, were called in to celebrate in the great Con∣gregation?
Sir, I may truly say, you made a great part of my Sermon, and the better part too; for
while thousands there are of all sizes, whose treacherous dealing in the Covenant of God, comes in to bear sad witnesse to the former part of my Text and Sermon; Free-grace hath so lookt upon you, that you stand in the first division of those Worthies, to whose fi∣delity GOD hath given ample testimony, what exploits a people can do, that know their God: for certainly, either you know God, or else we know not you.
Darius once opening a pomgranate, and being askt by a standerby, of what he would desire to have so many, as there were kernels in the pomgranate, answered, So many Zopyrusses. Zopyrus was that valiant Knight and Com∣mander, who to get the City of Babylon, possest by the Assyrians, and besieged by his Mr. Darius, caused his own nose, ears, and lips, to bee cut off, and his whole face and body so wounded, and mangled all over, that running to the enemies, and making them beleeve hee was so used by Darius, for perswading him to raise his Siege, and re∣move his Army. They easily giving credit to a relation, that seemed to speak truth with so many mouthes, as they saw wounds,
admitted him into the City, and made him their Governour, by means whereof, hee got opportunity to deliver it and them, up to his Master.
Sir, If in the behalf of this poor bleed∣ing Kingdom, I might have my wish, I would turn Darius his choice, into so many Wallers: You having run many, as despe∣rate, though more innocent hazzards, for the rescue of the Safety and Liberties there∣of, now captived by vile persons: And this hath been your Honor, God hath been with you, and with those gallant
Noble Sir William Bal∣fore, worthy Collonell Brown, &c. Commanders, and Souldiers that have accompanied you in this Service; to whose Fidelity and Reso∣lutions, Parliament and Kingdome stand much indebted. The Lord be with you still, & make you prosperous whithersoever you turn; and cause his dread to fall upon his and your enemies, that they may not be able to stand before you: And when you have done your share in this great Service of God, and the Kingdom, He bring you back into the embraces of your Friends, crown'd with Ho∣nour and Victory. Interim, if your grand employments allow you not time, to read a
period or two of this poor Sermon, some∣time, do but cast your eyes, I beseech you, upon the Text, and when you go forth, to encounter the enemy, lay it next your heart, I dare say, (through the power of that Lord of Hoasts, in whose Army you serve) it will, beyond all the witchcrafts, and enchantments which some of your enemies, are said to use, render you invulnerable, invincible, in the day of battell; which therefore, as the richest present I can send you, I humbly desire you would please to accept, from him, Sir, whom your merits, and love, have made Yours,
