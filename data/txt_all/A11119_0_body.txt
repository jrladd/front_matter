ESteemed friend, I pray thee take it kinde,
That outward action beares an inward minde,
What obiects heere these papers do deliuer,
Bestow the viewing of them for the giuer.
I make thee a partaker of strange sights,
Drawne antique works of humours vaine delights.
A mirrour of the mad conceited shapes,
Of this our ages giddy-headed apes,
These fash'on mongers, selfe besotted men
Of kindred to the fowle that wore my pen,
Are at an howers warning to appeare,
And muster in sixe sheetes of Paper heere.
And this is all at this time I bestow,
To euidence a greater loue I owe.
