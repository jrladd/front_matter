THe Time, my duty, and your deere desert,
(Deseruedly Right Noble) do conspire,
To make me consecrate [besides my Heart]
This IMAGE to you, forg'd with heauenly Fire!
The Exod, 33, 23 Backe-parts of his FORME, who form'd this ALL,
(Characterd by the Hand of louing Feare)
Are shaddovv'd here: but (ah) they are too small
To shevv their greatnesse, vvhich ne're Iob, 36 29 compast vvere!
But, though that Greatnesse be past Psal, 86, 8 quantity,
And Goodnes doth all quality exceed,
Yet I, this Forme of Formelesse DEITY,
Drewe by the Squire, and Compasse of our CREED:
Then (vvith your greater GVIFTS) accept this small;
Yet (being right) it's more then ALL in All!

Your Honors in all duety, most bounden;
Iohn Dauies of Here ford.
