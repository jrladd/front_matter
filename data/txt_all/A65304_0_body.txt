Right Honourable,
IT was not in
my thoughts to
have publish∣ed
this Ser∣mon
(I looked upon it as too
home-spun) but in regard it
was your Lordships re∣quest
to me at the first, and

I have since received an in∣vitation
from your Honoura∣ble
Court to that purpose, I
knew not how to deny, lest
while I did shun your loving
commands, I should fall un∣der
your just censure. My
Lord, it was my designe in
this Sermon to call you off
from the empty high-flown
notions, and litigious, disputes
of these times, to look after
that which is more solid, and
wherein, I am sure every man
is very neerly concerned, Viz.
the working out his salva∣tion,

Opus non pulvina∣ris,
sed pulveris; a work it is
that may call forth the most
spiritful vigorous actings of
the soul in the prosecution of
it; pingimus aeternitati.—
That work had need be well
done which is for eternity.
My Lord, this is the true
wisdom, to be wise to salva∣tion1 Tim. 5. 13.;
By this godly policy
we shall go beyond all the
Politicians of the times; we
shall escape hell, we shall be
raised to the true  of ho∣nour;
God will be our Father,

Christ our Brother, the Spirit
our Comforter, the Angels our
Companions; when we die
we shall carry a good consci∣ence
with us, and leave
a good Name behinde us.
I shall not further expati∣ate;
I desire this Sermon
may come under your Ho∣nours
Patrociny; some little
addition you will finde in
the end of it, which I had
before prepared for you, but
wanted time to serve it in;
The Lord enoble you with
his Spirit, and crown

you with soul-prosperity,
which shall be the prayer of
him, who is
