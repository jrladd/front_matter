My Lord,
MY Obligations to Your Lord∣ship are many, and great, and this Poor Return is all I have to offer: Gratitude obliges me to acknowledge my Debts, that it may appear I have (at least) the Will, if it should ever be in my Power to make any Restitution. In the mean time this is the way those who appear in Print take of Paying their Debts, and I my Lord, being as great a Bankrupt as others, follow their Method. The following Papers which I Dedicate to Your Lordships Protection would be
 rather an Affront, than an Acknow∣ledgement, were not Your Lordship's real Value for Religion sufficiently known to all: Your Family has been Famous, tho' Unfortunate in the Bra∣vest of Quarrels, where your Religion, your Laws and Country stood in need of Your Assistance. Go on (Great Sir) and may Your Glories and Honours en∣crease till I should wish the Growing Flood to ebb, which shall not be till the sum of Your Bliss and Glory be compleat in an Eternal and Happy World. The consummation of which, shall ever be the Prayer of
My Lord,
