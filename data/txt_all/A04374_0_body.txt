were when they sinned) we, the children of Adam, are stripped and made na∣ked of the Righteousnesse and Innocency of our cre∣ation, and cloathed onely with the shame of our owne nakednesse and sin, Actuall and Personall, as well as Originall; and in regard thereof lyable and subiect to be clothed eter∣nally with shame and confusion of face: Our chiefe or only Care should therefore be, to get this re∣proach and shame done away, this nakednesse co∣uered,

and our selues clo∣thed and fenced against the wrath and vengeance of the Almightie Lord God, vnder whose dis∣pleasure wee all remaine, whilest wee continue in this estate of Nature.
And as this should bee our chiefe Care, so our onely Comfort; and heau vpon earth will bee,  know & finde our selues, by a wise iudging and try∣ing of our selues, to bee in this happie, honourable, and ioyfull estate.
Now, blessed be God,

who hath not debarred vs of this hope (otherwise in and of our selues both helpelesse and hopelesse) but hath giuen vs both his Sonne with his Righ∣teousnesse, to be a couering to our nakednesse, and a couert and shelter against his wrath; and also his Word and Gospell, where∣by wee might not onely bee made effectually par∣takers of these his bene∣fits, but also bee certified and assured of so much.
Yet such is the Sloth and Negligence, Ignorance

and Inabilitie, Selfe-loue and Selfe-pride, which raigneth in most men, that being dis-affected to this most necessarie la∣bour of gaining Christ, they either through Sloth will not, or through Igno∣rance and Inabilitie cannot vndertake it; Besides, such is their Selfe-loue & Pride, and ouer-weening con∣ceits of themselues, that they readily and vsually mistake their owne estate, and conceiue better of it then they haue cause; re∣sting onely eyther in a bare

profession of Christiani∣tie, and in the name of Christians, (as doe the profane sort:) or in a meere formall and liue∣lesse practise of Christian duties, without any pow∣er of godlinesse imprinted in their hearts, or expres∣sed in their liues, (as doe the ordinary sort of Chri∣stians:) who, if to their outward conformities & seeming holinesse they can, by plausible and faire carriage winne the appro∣bation and applause of the most, then are they

the onely Christians; and all others (that labour in∣deed to bee what they would seeme to be) hypo∣crites and dissemblers.
Now, Right Worship∣full, for my part, as I, from my very soule, hate in my selfe, all hypocrisie, espe∣cially that which is a∣gainst Conscience, and in my Iudgement, and some∣what also in my affecti∣ons and indeauours, pre∣ferre with Saint Paul, the gayning of Christ, and my being found in his righteousnesse, (as in a gar∣ment)

before all worldly pompe, pride, pelfe, plea∣sure and preferment: So is it, and so hath it been my chiefe care, in my Mi∣nisterie, to preach Christ soundly to my hearers, and to plant in their hearts the true and sa∣uing knowledge of him, and that in all Since∣ritie.
To which end, I haue now lately (besides other Arguments in hand) dis∣patched this insuing Dis∣course concerning The Christians Apparelling by

Christ: wherein I haue indeauoured, first, by Mo∣tiues, (after the Explica∣tion and true meaning of the words) to excite and stirre vp the Slothfull to put on Christ. Secondly, by laying downe Meanes, to direct, and (with Gods grace) the better to informe and inable the ignorant and weake Christian so to doe. Thirdly, and chiefely, by Markes, (because all is no∣thing without sinceritie) to assure and certifie the godly Christian of his happy estate in Christ, by

which trialls he may bet∣ter bee assured that his paines and labour in so weightie a businesse, is not bestowed in vaine; as also the hypocrisie of the vnsound may bee disco∣uered.
These my paines, I doubt not, but with Gods blessing, they by the eye may adde to the profit of those who ori∣ginally were partakers of them by the eare; so they may bee vsefull also to o∣thers; which is the end why I make them so pub∣like.
Now Sir, that I pre∣fixe your Name heerevn∣to; you must giue mee leaue heereby to testifie, and publish to the whole world, first, what respect and thankefulnesse I owe you principally, on the behalfe of the Church of of God, and Gospell of Christ, for that good will and fauour you beare and shew therevnto; as also, and especially, to God for his good Prouidence in calling you, in these need∣full times, to sit at the sterne of this our Ship,

and litle Commonweale. The poore shal also blesse God for you, who stir∣red vp your heart to care for them, and so wisely and bountifully, with the Assistance and Allowance of your Right Worthie, and VVorshipfull Bre∣thren, to dispose of great part of that Treasure, wherewith (for many o∣ther godly and necessarie vses) God hath blessed your Treasury.
What interest you haue in mee particularly, and what, and how many are

the Ingagements wherein I stand bound vnto you, in respect of priuate fa∣uours and courtesies, I chuse rather thus general∣ly, onely to intimate and acknowledge, then par∣ticularly to relate to the world. Herein, (as also in your worthy deseruings, in regard of the publike, both Church and Com∣monwealth) I know you wil be better pleased with my silence, then with any larger mention of them, as desiring rather to be, then to be knowne to be worthy.
The Lord blesse this insuing Treatise to your vse, and to the vse of his Church. Amen.
From my house in Newcastle vpon Tine, May 5. 1624.
