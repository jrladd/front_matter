THe oc∣casion of this solemn engaging our selvs in Covenant with our God, you well remember, & the framing of this
Model (as you know) was at first for your stay in an holy stedfastnes in the way and life of Christ (to which you had in some measure already attained) and for my own recovery after a long and bitter declining, (God in mercy gave an answera∣ble
success.) Those expressions of the way of life I have oft received from you, as the fruits of your own blessed Experience gave me the more confi∣dence often to powr out my soul to you (a singular mercy to be interested in a faithful friend) in this I gained
both ease and re∣feshing to a trou∣bled spirit (and some consolation in so sad a condition I am cast into) in sympathizing with me in these saving experimental pas∣sages which I once enjoyed, though now (in bitter∣nesse) have no∣thing to stay my
Spirit, but (it was once otherwise) I have now only one suit, to beseech you to accept this your own, as it was first composed for our particulars, and to improve these sweet and spiritual experiences of the love of Christ shed into your heart, & God shall commu∣nicate
unto you by his spirit daily, in your close walking with him, to esta∣blish your spirit in assurance and im∣mutable cleaving to him in all faithful stedfast∣nesse, according to this our Cove∣nant.
This is the daily prayers of
him who will be ever found
