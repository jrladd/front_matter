Gentlemen,
WHEN, upon the Solicitations of some of my Friends, I resolv'd to Publish this Sermon I was soon determin'd to Dedicate it to You who were my Principal Auditory; and did me at first the Civility of an Invitation down amongst You; which I think my self bound to acknowledge to the World upon all fair Occasions: Just, and elaborate Discourses are not to be expected from Æ²s who bear the un-interrupted heat and burthen of the Day; but such as it is I present you with it. And that GOD would prosper You, and your Opulent Town, and my poor Labours amongst You, is the hearty Prayers of
Gentlemen,
