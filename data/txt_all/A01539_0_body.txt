giue me leaue the meanest of many that

wish well to your Lordship, and re∣ioyce
in your well-fare, with this so∣rie
Present (though comming some∣what
late) to welcome your returne
home from your late imployment a∣broad:
And therein to ioyne Her
with you, whom1 Pet. 3. 7. . Greg. Naz. in Gorgon. . Idem in Patr. . Idem in convent. Episc. Itaque quod Hieron. olim prae∣at. in Prv. pucis immutatis; iungat Epistl, qus  Conjugium. Iò ta non dividat, qus Christi nect  ad Chrom. & Eusb. Non de∣bet charta dividere, quos amor mutuu copulvit, &c. a spirituall knot, as
well as a ciuill band, hath made one
with you in Christ. This the rather,
because I assure my selfe, that you are
both of you, of the Persons therein de∣cyphered,
and haue ioynt share there∣fore
in the Benefit therein propounded
and promised. For the Worke it selfe; I
doubt not, but many things will bee
found in it, that to a meere Naturall Man
will seeme to bee. Clethes a∣pud Arrian▪ dissert, l. 4. c. 1. strange Paradoxes;
which yet euery good Christian, hauing
duly weighed, will easily acknowledge
with me, to be agreeable to Truth. So it
is indeed, thatOpera Dei sunt in mediis contrariis. Luther. apud Pau∣lum ab Eilzen in Genes. . Greg. Naz. in Cypr. Gods works (as that bles∣sed
Verè . Quod de apt. Dominus Ioan. 5. 35. Light of God, Martin Luther, was
wont to say) are effected vsually by Con∣traries.
And a Christian Mans Life here (as

 Senec. epist. 107. . Plut. de . .  Steb. c. 95. the Heathen Man said of euery Mans)
is a meere Mixture of. Ca∣sarius apud Gree, Naz. ep. 59. Contrarieties.Psa. 34. 19. & 73. 14. Luk. 9. 23. & 21. 12, 16, 17. Act. 14. 2. 1 Cor. 15. 19. None
encombred with more Crosses; but
Luk. 9. 24. & 21. 18. 2 Cor. 1. 3, 4, 5. & 2. 14 & 6. 10. & 10. 4. none accompanied with more Com∣forts,
and those such as may well not
counteruaile only, but euen throughly
weigh downe the other. In so much,
that I see not why a Christian Man,
though exposed to such a multitude of
Crosses, (were it not for his owne, either
want of wisdome, or weaknesse) might not
well liue the comfortablest life of any Man
in the world, whatsoeuer estate or con∣dition
of life God hath pleased to assigne
and confine him vnto. Nor haue any
therefore cause to waiue the profession of
Christianitie in regard of such Crosses, as a
disconsolate and vncomfortable estate.
Of Children we vse to say, that they are
. Plut. de prolis . . Incertus Author. . Demberit. apud Stob. c. 74. . Euntus apud Plut. de am prol. Certaine Cares, vnrtaine Comforts; and
yet wee seeGen. 15. 2. & 30. 1. Iohn 16. 21. ; Menand. apud Stob. c. 73. how desirous naturally
Men and Women are to haue Issue: and

that,1 Sam. 1. 6, 7, 8,  11. . Idem ibid. euen those also that for outward
things might well liue comfortably
without. How much more haue all
cause to desire Christian Grace, when the
Comforts that attend it, are so sure and
certaine, if men be not their owne Ene∣mies;
yea when no sound Comfort (as is
here shewed) can be attained without
it? Vnworthy is he of Issue, that. Menand. . Eurip. Oenomao. estee∣meth
not the Care hee taketh for his
Children, especially.-Eurip. Meleagr. .-Menand. being toward, du∣tifull,
and inclinable to good things.
. Eurip. Dane.-. Idem Androm, inde restituendus apud Stob. cap. 74. abundantly ouer-counteruailed in
the Comfort hee hath or may haue of
them. Nor is he worthy of Christ, that
accounteth not the Crosses that Christia∣nitie
and the Profession of it may procure,
(for of other Crosses that worldly men
are alike subiect to with such, what

need I say ought? and yet let these
goe also in the same reckoning with
those;) all abundantlyRom. 5. 2, 3. & 8. 18. ouer-coun∣teruailed
with those spirituall Comforts,
that the assurance of Gods fauour towards
him in Christ Iesus may afford him, if
the Eye of his Soule bee throughly o∣pened
duely to apprehend it. This
mine endeuour is to shew in this weake
Discourse; (the weaker,. Languente mens & languet unâ corpore. because amids
much weaknesse during my late re∣straint
by sicknesse, out of broken notes,
either reserued by my selfe, or taken
by others from my mouth, as they
are wont to bee, at the time of the
deliuerie of it, with addition of such
things as came then further to minde,
and seemed not altogether imperti∣nent,
it was by peece-meale put to∣gether:)
and to encite all good Chri∣stians
(notwithstanding such occur∣rents)
to striue and straine themselues
Psal. 13. 4, 5. & 42. 5, 11. by their cheerefull cariage in such cases,
to seale, vp the truth of it (which
they cannot but acknowledge;) to

those that may question it, or make
doubt of it. This was I the rather
enduced to take some paines in, sup∣posing
that other weake ones like
my selfe, (for of such am I bold
to iudge, as. Greg. Naz. in Iulian. 1. . Idem post redit, suū. Hoc enim proclivi homo suspicatur in alio quod sentit in seipso. Aug. in Psal. 118. conc. 12. the manner is, by my
selfe;) being ordinarily too too back∣ward
herein, might haue neede of
some quickning and stirring vp there∣unto.
To which purpose if it shall
be auaileable vnto any the meanest,
I shall haue cause to blesse God for his
blessing thereupon. If to your selues
among others, Persons for Place and
Pietie so eminent, (for euen. Greg. Naz. in Basil. the wor∣thiest

ought or might in this their blessed estate;

testifie my deserued respect to you
both, and my thankfull acknowledgement
of your Lordships kindnesse shewed mee,
in my friend and my selfe, at home and
abroad. So with vnfained thankes to

Gods goodnesse for your Lordships Safe
returne to vs, reserued, I hope, in mercie
for further Seruice to God and his Church;

of health and well-fare, such especially as
