Worthy Mistriss,

TO You I do present
This little Book, hoping 'twill you content:
Accept, I pray you, of these feeble Rimes;
They are th' Fruits (Sooth) of my leasure times.
But if they should in the least you offend,
I shall repent that ever they were Pen'd:
Because you are my Mistriss; and I see,
You have been more, a Mother unto me.
And, like a Son, you alwayes do me foster:
Though I your Prentice, yet live like a Master.
If Joseph's Mistris she had been so true:
Nay, had she been but half so good as You,

Then Joseph he had never suffer'd wrong,
Nor never had been cast in Prison strong:
But he a wanton Mistriss had we see,
Though he deserv'd a better far than me.
Now, though I am unfit to sing your Praise,
I'le Honour and Respect you all my dayes,
Though not in outward shew, as other do:
I am your faithful Servant just and true;
And for your Health, Prosperity, and Peace,
My Prayers t'God for You shall never cease:
That you may never want; yet allwayes giving,
Till you shall cease to be among the Living:
And when the Lord shall call you hence away,
You may depart into Eternal Joy;
Among whole Quires of Angels, for to sing
sweet Hallelujahs to your Heavenly King.
Now God preserve you whilst you live on Earth:
I am your humble Servant untill Death,

January 20. 1675.
