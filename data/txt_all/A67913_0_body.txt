May it Please your Lordship.
ESteeming it the greatest Honor I ever yet had,
that I have served under your Lord-ship, not
only in the General cause that those true Eng∣lish
Spirits in Colchester were embarqued in, but
also under your Lord-ships particular command in the
store, subjected to your Lord-ship as Commissary Ge∣neral:
I have presumed, (emholdened by that Noble∣ness,
wherewith your Lord-ship then obliged not only
me, but all that knew you) to present your Lord-ship
with this smal discourse. Being a sum of what, your
Lord-ship, and those Heroick spirits, then (joyned in
command with you) labor'd for. The observation of
Laws and Iustice is a cause no man need ever be asha∣med
of; but what those Heroick endeavors then mis∣sed
of, God hath now given us hopes, may be obtai∣ned
in a more peaceable manner; having opened a
way to us for reason to be heard; and reduced us from
the use of barbarous violence, to the force of argu∣ments;
fitter Weapons for human societies. Tis with
such my Lord, that, I have endeavor'd here to be still
an assertor of that general cause of Englands liberty,

to the utmost of my Capacity. And tis my hopes, your
Lord-ship, that were then a strenuous defender of
this cause by your valor in that Bellum Martiale, wil
now grant your Protection to him that by this submits
himself your Servant, whilest your Lord-ship in
Parliament are now managing this Bellum Mercu∣riale:
Bellum I cannot but term it because stil there
appears many opposers of Iustice it self, which is our
cause, having no argument (but their fucated pre∣tences
to Saints-ship) to cover the great injustices
they have done; but my Lord when like paint on faces
these are melted off by the impartial scrutiny of Iustice,
there appeares nought but Rapines, and meer Wolves
under the Sheeps Clothing: which disguise; since it hath
occasioned the devouring of so many Lambs, I hope for
the future our Shephards will so defend us by the pale
of Iustice that we may hereafter be secure, and every
man admitted to that which Law calls his own. Of the
want of which pale your Lord-ship hath been as sensi∣ble
as any by the injuries you have suffered, both in
Estate and Liberty. If the meanness of my perfor∣mances
cause your Lord-ship to censure me Presum∣tuous
in perfixing your Name to so smal a discourse,
my Petition is, that my zeal both to Iustice and
your Lord-ships Service may beg pardon for: my
Lord
