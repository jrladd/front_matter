Reverend Sir,
MY Zeal for this present Government, (the happiest Change that ever Nation was blest with,) and my Trouble to see some remaining Scruples, which (in despight of all God's manifestations to us) seem yet to disturb our Isra∣el, have so far transported me beyond the bounds of Modesty, and made me forget my own Weakness, as to thrust upon you this unworthy Pamphlet.
My Forwardness for the Cause had wellnigh put me upon the printing of it without farther con∣sultation; but upon second thoughts I judg'd it sa∣fer in a matter, of this weight, to consult some of greater Learning: And whilst my thoughts were roving to find out some proper persons, (of which, upon several accounts, there are but few in this quarter of our World,) attracted with the fame of Your Worth, and Learning, and the sense of Your

great Actings in our happy Change it self, they seemed to bend to You-wards. And though a per∣son of less Business, and less Note, might very well have served to examine so pitifull a Piece, yet promising my self better usage from You, whose Candour must be answerable to Your Greatness, than perhaps I might meet with from some of lesser note, I resolved, however bold it might appear in me, to take this way. Accept therefore, Reverend Sir, this poor Piece, which however rude it be, if it be but sound I care not: And though it was very fond of the journey, to come and present it self to You, yet it will, upon the approach of so grave a Censure, (methinks) begin to tremble. And if I be prevented by any other who (questionless) may doe it better, I am very well pleased with the Ser∣vice which may be done o my Sovereigns by it, and think my self sufficiently rewarded for my poor Endeavours, that I had the Honour of expressing to You my readiness in them. God preserve You, Reverend Sir, and enrich his Church more and more with such noble Patriots.
