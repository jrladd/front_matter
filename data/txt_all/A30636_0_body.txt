SIR,
OF all the Attributes are
owned by the Deity, This
whereon I have engag'd my Pen,
is the most remarkable and Glo∣rious.
Which I undertook the ra∣ther,
and with the more assu∣rance,
because I knew that if I did
come short in my Discourses on
it (as who ever enterpriz'd it
must) I had my consolation in
my Subject.

It is Divine Goodness to ac∣cept
of what a Person hath, and
not of what he hath not. I know
that God is great, as well as good,
that he is in Heaven, and we on
Earth; and that therefore as in
our addresses to him, so in our Dis∣courses
of him, our words should
be few. But I also know, what Ci∣cero
observ'd before me, that he
is Opt. Max. that he is first Good,
and then Great, and that he glories
in his Goodness, as his greatest Ex∣cellency,
[His making of his Sun
to rise on the Evil, and on the Good,
and his sending Rain on the Just,
and on the unjust, is called his
Perfection, and indeed is so, 'tis,
be you perfect, as your Hea∣venly
Father is perfect.
Once, it is the Interest and Cause

of God I plead in this Essay, and
so much, that all Religion is
concerned in it. For 'tis an
apprehension of the Goodnesse,
and Bounty, and Beneficence of
God, that established in Mens
hearts doth powerfully tie them
to Adore, Obey, and Serve him.
There is Mercy (sayes the
Royal Psalmist) with thee,
that thou mayest be feared.
It was for this Reason that he
prefaced the Law he gave the
Jewes, with a Repitition of
the benefits, which had ac∣crued
to them by him, I am the
Lord thy God, which have
brought thee out of the Land
of Egypt, out of the House of
Bondage, Thou shalt, &c.
Namely to imprint upon them a

due sence of all his Obligations
and Engagements, that having first
possess'd them of a rational and
well establish'd Love, he might
afterwards the better influence
them by it, to a due respect to all
his commands. ['Tis, if you love
me keep my commands.] And
the Holy Evangel, wherein Al∣mighty
God is admirably repre∣sented
as most infinitely Loving,
Gratious, and Benigne, what o∣ther
end, intention or design has it,
but by so ample proof and Decla∣ration
of the Divine Love to pre∣vail
with man for his, that believ∣ing
he may love, and loving he
may serve and obey? This is the
Evangellical Obedience; that
of Faith, which workes by
Love.

Thus our Love to God it is the
life of all our Devotion and Obe∣dience
to him, and his Benignity
and kindnesse unto us, it is the
ground of all our love. And Sa∣than
knows it well enough, and
therefore he is so industrious (for
we are not ignorant of his de∣vices)
to instil into the minds of
men, hard and frightful apprehen∣sions
of the great God; as that he
rules by will; that he hath no
consideration in the world of his
Creatures comfort, but onely of
his own Glory, that he made the
greatest part of Men to damne
them, and triumphs in their Ruin;
and that he cruelly exacts impos∣sibilities,
and obliges Men to come,
when yet he knowes they cannot.
And that Evil One is intimate e∣nough

with all our minds, to know
that if he can but once perswade
them, that the Master, whom we
are to serve is most Tyrannicall
and hard, and that he reapeth,
where he hath not sown, and
gathereth, where he hath not
strewed; no question, but we
will away, and dig and hide our
Lords money, as that unfaith∣ful
servant did.
So much it is the interest of
God and True Religion, that Di∣vine
Benignity be vindicated; a
work as necessary now as ever,
when Lucretius is as much con∣sulted
as Moses, and when there
are almost as many, who blasphe∣mously
dispute Divine Goodnesse,
as there are that seriously believe
it. And it is with those I princi∣pally deal.

In doing which I have endea∣vour'd
to acquit my self, not onely
Philosophically by alledging
Reasons which Philosophy, Com∣mon
sense, and the Natures of the
things I treat of, do suggest to me,
but also as a Christian, by blend∣ing
with those other, such conside∣rations
also as the sacred Oracles
(whereon I most relie) do prompt
me with; not insisting on the for∣mer,
(which yet too many do) but
as they have the countenance and
favour of the latter.
This, Sir, is what I offer you.
Be pleased to accept an Essay
[but a Part of that whole you
have a Title to] which with those
designs, and this Furniture (such
as it is) doth lay it self before you,
at your seet? 'Tis its Ambition,

to have a Person for its Parton,
whom its Subject hath for its Ad∣mirer.
And it cannot easily de∣spair
of being owned by you, and
so of being made another In∣stance
of your great Goodness, of
which its Author is already One,
seeing to be so, it is enough to need
it.
And, Sir, with this high Encou∣ragement
it is, that I presume to
own my self in these circumstan∣ces,
in that capacity you long ago
vouchsafed me the honour to be,
even that of
SIR,

Bowden near Totnes, Oct. 9. 1671.
