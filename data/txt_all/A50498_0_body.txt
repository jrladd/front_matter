MY LORD,
I Esteem it as a singular fa∣vour and honour that your Lordship thinks me capable of giving you any information concerning the Northern Affairs; the Scene of your Lordships many eminent Employments and Actions having been laid nearer the warm Sun. The Draught I have here sent was made several years since, and only communicated in private with

some friends: In the composing whereof I was not a little advantaged by being a spectator of the Actions, and privy to some of the Counsels of both Kings. But how far I have answered those advantages in the en∣suing Narrative I submit to your Lordship's Censure, and remain
MY LORD, 
Parham in Suff. Sep. 24. 1675.
