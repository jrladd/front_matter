THe deepe-grounded
root (most dread So∣ueraigne)
of my du∣teous
loue to your fa∣mous
and memorable
Sister my gracious
Queene and Mistresse, being newly wa∣tered
with the drops of your Princely fa∣uour,
spreadeth it selfe into many bran∣ches
of much loialtie, and full desire to

bring forth the fruit of my most humble
zeale and faithfull seruice to your Ma∣iestie.
And albeit my best labours, being
brought into a choise and Princely taste,
can neither desire nor deserue greater
grace than to be held as perfunctorie and
triuiall: yet vouchsafe (most mightie
King) to giue so fauourable a passage in
your gracious consideration, that were the
stocke answerable to the bud of my deuo∣ted
minde, or the fruit agreeable to my
faith and loialtie; it should at least haue
carried the relish in your iudiciall allow∣ance,
of good fruit. Kirnels being set at
first, in time beare fruit; but being vn∣graft,
neuer come to perfection: So, may
it please your Highnesse, from this ten∣der
plant of mine, there can appeare no∣thing
woorthie either keeping or gathe∣ring;
but being grasted in the least fa∣uour

of your Maiesties protection, it may
hereafter bring forth matter of more ap∣probation,
content and consequence. I
must confesse, that this so woorthy a sub∣iect
might haue beene written with grea∣ter
maturitie and deliberation; but the
golde of my inuention hath prooued too
base, therein to set the rare-orientall
pearles of these roiall vertues: onely my
much respectiue dutie hath thus dared to
vent her greatnesse, which though it
make no large current from the first
head; yet is it as pure and vndistained,
as where it floweth most. The God of
Heauen indue your Highnesse with all
Princely blessings, and dayly more and
more propagate and spread abroad the
glorious lustre of your Maiestie: to
the which, as England, Scotland,
France and Ireland, so likewise the

whole world may haue regard vnto, as
their true marke and perfect Cynosure;
since the vniuersall schoole of the world
is, the Person, the House and Court of
a vertuous Prince.
