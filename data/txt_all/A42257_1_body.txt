Right-noble and Right-worshipfull SIRS,
WHEREAS it often happens that men are so blinded with affection and love to
their own Affairs, that they oversee all others, and cannot make free use of their
reason to render thanks to those who have highly merited their gratefull acknowledgments;
I have resolved to write these lines to you, whereby to justifie my self; beseeching you to con∣serve
them as a memorial in my behalf; and to let them remain with you as a testimony of
that esteem which I have already gained with you, and which I promise to improve by the
services I design for every one of you, so long as I shall live in Peru, or in any other parts
whatsoever. But not to insist on any private or particular service which I have rendred to
any single person amongst you; I shall onely say in general, that I have not omitted any
thing wherein I might have been instrumental to promote that service. For I dare boldly
say, that in all the Wars made in Peru, or out of it, 'twas never heard or seen that ever
such vast charges were made in so short a time, and expended on so few people: and what
Lands were vacant or without Proprietors, I have divided amongst you with as much ju∣stice
and equality as I have been able; with consideration both day and night of every man's
merit, which hath been the measure and standard upon which I have proceeded; and which
shall ever be my rule so long as I stay in Peru; and I shall be carefull to divide and dis∣pense
amongst you onely his Majesty's loyal Subjects, according to your services and loyalty to
the Crown, whatsoever remains undisposed with exclusion of all others, untill you are fully
satisfied. And that you may enjoy the sole benefit of this rich Countrey to your selves, I will
not onely endeavour to banish those out of it who have been actually in rebellion, but such
also who have stood Neuters, and have not acted as you have done: and that untill you are
fully repaired and made easie in your fortunes, I will not suffer any new Guests either out
of Spain, or the Continent, or from Nicaragua, Guatimala or New-spain, to enter in∣to
this Countrey, or to possess any part or share thereof to your prejudice or disadvantage.
And since I protest that all which I say is true, and that I have not been able to doe more

for your service and advantage, than what I have already done, I earnestly entreat you to
follow the example of God himself herein, that is, to accept of the real endeavours and
good-will of the person: and on this consideration let every one satisfie himself with his lot,
which though not so large perhaps as he expected, yet it is as great as the division and thing
would bear, and less than the Distributor desired, and which he will increase when enabled
by any fortunate opportunity. And now after all my travels and labours both by Sea and
Land which I have sustained in this last period of my life, I pretend to no other reward than
the satisfaction of having acted according to that Talent which God hath given me, by which
I have discharged my conscience towards God as a Christian, towards the King as a faithfull
Subject, and towards your selves as became a good neighbour and a true servant. And in∣deed,
if you take not things, and understand them in the same manner, you ill requite
the love and affection I bear you, and the care and labours I have sustained for your interest,
considering that on my part there hath been no failure or omission to advance the same. And
since, for the better settlement of the Courts of Judicature and the Affairs of Lima, it is ne∣cessary
for me to be there present, I have desired the most Reverend Father in God, the Arch-bishop
to supply my presence with you in the City, and in my name to offer to you what I can
doe at present, and what I shall be able to doe for the future. And having not farther
to add; I beseech God, that I may live to see you all in great prosperity and plenty, and em∣ployed
in his holy service as fully and as happily as you your selves desire,
Given at Guaynarima, on the 18th day of August, 1548. Subscribed,


Besides this Letter and Instructions given to the Archbishop, he gave it in
charge to the Father Provincial, Frier Thomas de San Martin, that he should make
a Sermon on the day of the Publication, and therein exhort the Pretenders to be
contented every man with his portion allotted; and to deal with them in private,
and persuade them thereunto. All which Hernandez Palentino writes more at large,
which we have abbreviated, to avoid prolixity and tediousness to the Reader;
and is as followeth:
When it was known in Cozco that the President was retired privately to avoid
the troublesome importunities of the People; one Captain Pardaue, being in dis∣course
with other Captains; on my Conscience said he, this Madalena de la Cruz
is retired some where privately to put an Harana upon us, for in Peru they call that
Harana, when a man who hath lost his money at gaming plays some Trick or
Sham to avoid payment. And amongst other Nick-names given the President,
they called him Madalena de la Cruz, which was as much as Cheater or Sorcerer,
and was the name of that Woman who was punished by the Officers of the In∣quisition
in Cordoua: And the truth is, the President, not to hear such insolent
Speeches as these, retired from Cozco that he might have liberty to make the
Distributions, and removed farther from it when they were published, as Palen∣tino
saith in the second Part, and Chapter the first of his History, in these words:
It was well known that the President absented himself from Cozco, that he
might not be present at the time when the Distribution of Lands was published;
for he was prudent and subtile, and understood by good experience the nature of
the Countrey; and feared much the Insolences of the Souldiers, and to hear their
Complaints, Oaths and Curses: And indeed herein he was not deceived; for
when the Arch-bishop was arrived at Cozco, where almost all the Inhabitants and
Souldiers were assembled, expecting to receive great proportions of Lands and
Government: they appeared quiet and orderly: but so soon as the publication
was made, on the 24th of August, being the Festival of Saint Bartholomew, where∣by
finding themselves much disappointed of their hopes, they began to curse and
swear, and to utter many seditious expressions against the President and his Go∣vernment,
to that high degree, that all things seemed to tend to mutiny and a
new rebellion. Hereupon they began to enter into Cabals and secret Consultati∣ons,
how in the first place they might kill the Judge Andres de Cianca, and the
Arch-bishop, whom they esteemed the Authours of the Distributions. The
cause and ground of their fury and rage they alledged to be the allotment made
of principal Places and Lands to those who had been the Followers and Abettors

of Gonçalo Piçarro, and who had favoured that party which had been in Arms
against the King: but the relation of these matters is more fully made by Francisco
Lopez de Gomara, Chap. 188. in these words:
The President, said he, went to Apurima twelve leagues distant from Cozco,
where he consulted with the Archbishop of Los Reyes, and his Secretary Pero Lopez
about the division of Lands, which were to be made and distributed amongst se∣veral
persons, to the value of a million and a half of yearly rent, with a hundred
and fifty thousand Ducats in Gold, which he had raised from divers who were in
present possession he married many rich Widows to such as had well served the
King; he increased the Revenue and Estate of others who were already possessed
of Lands, so than some had a yearly Revenue made up to them of a hundred thou∣sand
Ducats; which was an Estate for a Prince, if the Inheritance had been theirs;
but the Emperour would allow no other Estate but for life: but he who had the
greatest Estate assigned to him was Hinojosa.
Gasca himself went to Los Reyes to avoid the complaints, curses and damning of
the Souldiers, and perhaps for fear of worse: And to make publication of the
Lands allotted and divided, the Archbishop was sent to Cozco; and to take those
off to whom nothing was given, a smooth Letter was wrote to nourish them
with future hopes and expectations; but the furious Souldiers were neither appea∣sed
with the air of smooth words, nor the gentle exhortation of the Archbishop.
Some complained of Gasca for giving them nothing; some because they had less
alotted than what was expected; and others, because those who had dis-served the
King had the greatest proportion; swearing that they would accuse him before the
Council of the Indies: of which number were the Mareschal Alonso de Alvarado and
Melchior de Verdugo, who afterwards drew up a formal accusation against him, and
presented it to the chief Baron of the Exchequer. In short, their whole discourse
tended to Mutiny and Sedition: the Archbishop and Judge Cianca, Hinojosa, Cen∣teno
and Alvarado were to be apprehended and imprisoned: and a Petition was to
be made to the President Gasca, that he would be pleased once again to revise the
allotments that were made, and to divide them into lesser parcels, or to grant
Pensions to such as wanted them; and in case their expectations were not answe∣red,
they then resolved to take them by force. But the Plot being discovered be∣fore
it came to maturity, Cianca the Judge apprehended the chief Leaders, and
punished them; wherewith the troubles were appeased. Thus far Gomara.
