My Lord,
THis Discourse, as it doth justifie its becoming now more Publick, by so good an Authority, as that which it hath Prefixed: so is too to con∣fess, that it owes that Honour to the Subject, of which it treats. Those Graces of the Blessed spirit were likely to procure favour, from your Lordship, to One that did but mention their Names: and might be
understood well enough, tho in an Imperfect Description, by Such as were no Strangers to them. That the Holy Ghost may proceed to exhibit them to your Lordship, and your Brethren, in their own Life, and full Po∣wer; that by the Influence of your Govern∣ment, Love, and Joy, and Peace may be once again Restor'd amongst us; that by such Fruit your City may flourish Now, and your selves be everlastingly happy here∣after; is the Prayer of,
My Lord,
