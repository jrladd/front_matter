Right Worshipful,
I Here present to your Eyes what formerly was deli∣vered to your Ears, God grant it may make a deep impression upon your Hearts. It is a Ser∣mon preached by Command, and was at the preaching, favourably enter∣tained by the persons principally
concerned in it. To prevent the trouble of giving several Copies desired by some good Friends, (which I thought might be attended with sundry Inconveniencies) I have chosen this way of publishing it in Print, that it may be ready at hand to do God, his Church, and your selves a further service. I must ever thankfully remember the kindness received by an unanimous vote in your Hall, at my first settle∣ment among you; and the continu∣ance of a fair Respect, which as I still experience, so I desire to declare it to the World. My capacity will not reach to a better acknowledge∣ment than the offering this Token of Gratitude into your hands. God
Almighty bless it to the good end for which it was designed; that by fol∣lowing Davids example in serving your Generations, His Holy Name may receive due Honour, you may be Instrumental to do much good, and your Corporation (being Go∣verned with Care and Conscience) may flourish in Peace, and Plenty, while the Sun and Moon endure. This is and shall be the fer∣vent Prayer of
 Leicester Novem. 9. 1669.
