TO Mr. Godbold, Preacher at Æ²xbridge in Middlesex, I Dedicate this my Discourse, Because he was my friend to help conquer my old man, by informing my friends of Chesham, That I was a Witch, and was run away, and would never come againe. You being a publick Preacher, may doe me greater service in helping me to dishonour him; for I have been almost 3. years conquering my old man by dishonour. Therefore if you can stirre up any more to forward this work, pray do, if it be not hurtfull to your self, and they that do so. I rest,
