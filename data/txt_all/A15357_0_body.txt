HAuing drawn certaine Col∣lections
together of some,
the best and maine occur∣rents
which haue now late∣ly
(and not many yeares
past) hapned in Barbary; &
they being digested into a
Volume (although little for quantity, yet delight∣full
to be perused for the raritye,) I thought they
could not better be bestowed, than vpon such as
holde commerce with that Countrey, and know
the state and condition of the people. Amongest
which number I make bolde to present these my
labors to you onely, because you are all Brothers,
and men that most worthily can iudge of the Re∣lation,
and the truth thereof. The chiefe and far∣thest
point that my intention seeks to arriue at in

this, is to describe the horrour and vn-heard-of
misery that hath falne vpon that Kingdome by a
Plague: to the intent that by comparing our sins
with theirs (being altogether as greet if not grea∣ter)
and the hand of mercy which Heauen hath
stretcht forth ouer our Nation, aboue theirs, we
may be allured to looke into our soules betimes,
least the like Viols of Wrath bee powred downe
vppon vs. It is my loue that bestowes this vppon
you, which I pray receiue with such good accep∣tation,
as with my best affection it comes vnto
you. And thus referring my selfe to your censure
I take my leaue.
