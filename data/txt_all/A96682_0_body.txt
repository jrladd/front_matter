My Lord,
IF the Analogy be true betwixt natural and morall streams, that as in waters, so in affections, the flowings will equalize the elevation and site of the spring-head, from whence they are derived, & joy in fruition of desired good will be proportionate to that desire which did pre∣ceed fruition: I am well assured the subject of these leaves will find a full agreement in your Noble breast, that I shall need make no Apology for venturing to adorn them with your Honourable Name. For as I had the honour to be a witnesse of your most ardent longings to see these productions of deep and astonishing Providence, which we then wanted faith to believe; and which have since filled all honest Loyal bosomes with such Extasies of delight and thankfulnesse, so am
 I more then confident, no heart resounds and ecchoes to this Joyful, Pious, Loyal shout, God save the King, more cheerfully, more loudly, more faithfully then yours; these papers therefore must be your Lord-ships, by a double due, both as I am yours, and inclusively all that's mine, as all the issue of the servant was his Lords, Exod. 21.4. and as they are the transcript and coppy of your very heart. Let me only beg the favor to give ac∣count in an inverted order of the preaching, and publishing of them. What is storyed of the dumb son of Craesus, that seeing a hand stretcht out to slay his father, he brakt the very bars of nature, where∣with his lips till then were closed up, and all a∣mazed, cryed out, Kill not the King, is in a mea∣sure exemplified in this publication; the like paths hath over-ruled me, and what fear did in him fr the death of a living King, that joy in me for the life of a dead King, dead in his enemies strong desires, proud hopes, and cruel resolutions, dead in his peoples fears, dispondencies, and disappoint∣ments of all means of restauration, till Gods time came, and the mighty were taken away without hands, Job 34.20. whom we have received as A∣braham did Isaac, from the dead in a figure, who hath been with S Paul, in deaths often, and esca∣ped
 the snares of treachery and violence more nar∣rowly then he did at Damascus. My admirati∣ons and rejoycings I say at these great salvations of God, have broke my hitherto obstinate silence, as to this manner of publique speaking, for the preaching of it, I must confesse I scarce ever prea∣ched any Sermon with less preparation then I first preached this, and after once preaching it, had shap't and moulden my thoughts into this method, I found it hard to alter it, So that tis, as to the main, the same I suddenly delivered at Burnt∣wood Lecture, May the 10th, upon the joyful Newes of his Majestyes Proclaiming, that I have preacht it severall times since, both in City and Country in eminent auditoryes, is so well known I cannot hide it, especially at Alderman∣bury, when the City did yet ring and eccho with those repeated acclamations, and I hope it needs no farther excuse then the obvious intimation, that it teaches a duty almost obsolete and out of fashi∣on, very seasonable and necessary to be learnt, and that, though plainly, yet I hope pertinently, seri∣ously, and piously. But this I must submit to the censure of others, which I shall scantly, and with less solicitousness doe, if it may obtain your Honours favourable acceptance, and be owned as
 a Religious testification of consciencious Loyalty to my Soveraign, and a pledge of his selfe Dedi∣cation to your Lordships soul-interests and ser∣vice, who is
My most Noble and very good Lord
