MY Singular good Lorde: I am of opini∣on that long before this time your honour hath throughly perused the booke, which I prepared to bee sent vnto you somewhat before my comming hyther, and there∣withall I doe lykewise coniectour that you haue founde therein iust cause to laugh at my follies forepassed. So that I am partly in doubte whether I were more ouerseene in my first deuising, or in my last dyrecting of the same? But as fan∣tasticall humours are common imperfections in greene vnmellowed braines: So hope I yet that your good Lordshippe wyll rather winke at my weakenesse in generallitie, then reproue my rashnesse in per∣ticularitie. And because I would bee glad, to drawe your Lord∣shippe into forgetfulnesse thereof, by freshe recorde of some more martiall matter, as also for that I would haue your Honour perceaue that in these lyngering broyles, I doe not altogeather passe ouer my time in ydlenesse: I haue therefore thought meete nowe to present you with this Pamphlete written by stelth at such times as we Loyte∣red from seruice. And the sobiect thereof being warre, I could not more conuenientlye addresse the same vnto any Marshiall man, then vnto your good Lordshippe: VVhome I haue heard to be an vniuer∣sall patrone of all Souldiours, and haue found to bee an exceeding fa∣uourour of mee your vnworthy follower. The verse is roughe. And good reason, sithence it treateth of roughe matters, but if the sence be good then haue I hyt the marke which I shote at: Knowing that your Lordshippe can winne Honny out of the Thistle. And such as it is, I dyrect it vnto your Honour. Beseeching the same, to take it in  gree, and to perceaue that I am and euer wyll continew.
