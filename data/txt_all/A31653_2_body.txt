My Dearest BROTHERS,
IT is by your commands, that I have finished this Treatise of the Antient
Architecture compared with the Modern, which I had altogether layd
aside, and even effac'd out of my mind since the decease of Monseigneur
De Noyers to whom I had devoted it, as to the Mecaenas of the Age,
and more particularly, for being indeed the true Authour of this Book;
since I had never taken it in hand but by his special Order, and to afford
him some little entertainment during his Solitude of Dangu, where he was pleased, and in∣deed
desired, I should follow him after his retreat from the Court, there to enjoy with him
that sweetness and tranquillity of life, which we were never before acquainted with during
the time of his being Minister of State. But this blessed leisure, and which you so often con∣gratulated,
was quickly interrupted by I know not what unlucky Genius, and by an intem∣pestive
and precipitous death, which soon extinguisht this glorious light of Vertue. In this
great loss (which was, my dear Brothers, common to us all, since we all had the honour to be

related to him both by our services and birth) I onely had the affliction to be present at the
lugubrous Object, and to behold it with mine eyes. This has often caus'd me seriously to re∣flect
upon the vanity and volubility of the fortunes of the Court, of which I am now suffici∣ently
disabus'd: For considering that so rare a Personage, the greatest Minister, the most
disinteress'd, most laborious, most successful, of so extraordinary and approv'd a Probity,
so universal in all sorts of excellent qualities, and, in a word, so extraordinary, after a
twenty years service and employment in the greatest Offices of State, that a Subject (I say)
of so great merit should come to conclude his dayes in the Country like an Exile: I confess,
my dearest Brothers, whil'st I think of this, all things appear so transitory and uncertain in
Greatness, that I find the Retreat of the disgrac'd (provided they are honest men) infinitely
preferrible to their Favour. Could Merit and considerable Services have for ever fixt
and establish'd a man at Court, or been a rampart against that envy and jealousie, which
are the immortal enemies and pests of Vertue, unhappily reigning in that Climat: The
late Monseigneur de Noyers was the most worthy to have finish'd his dayes gloriously in his
high Employments; since he alone performed more, in less then ten years space, than all his
Predecessors together had done in an hundred; whether we have regard to Works which
are necessary for the Conservation and good of the State, or consider Those onely which gave
splendour and magnificence to the Kingdom. It is not my design to repeat them here for
your instruction, because you know them much better then my self; Onely that I may leave
some Memorials to the Publique, I shall mention a few of them. It may be affirm'd in ge∣neral,
that he had in his time exalted the noblest Arts to the supreamest degree of Perfection
that was ever seen in France: as Architecture both Civil, and Military; Painting,
Sculpture, and Printing which he then made truely Royal when be lodg'd it at the
Louure; the very first Productions whereof, were not onely unparallel'd Master-pieces,
but, as one may say, Libraries compleat; for in two years there were publish'd threescore
and ten great Volumes, in Greek, Latine, French, and Italian; from one part of which,
one may judge of the rest, viz. that general Collection of all the Councils, set forth in seven
and thirty Volumes, which is certainly the most noble, most useful, and royal Work that
ever saw the light to this hour: This incomparable Stamp was accompany'd with ano∣ther
very rich one, I mean the new Money, which Monseigneur de Noyers plac'd also in
the same apprtment of the Louure, that he might allye together two of the most universal
and most permanent Monuments of Kings, spreading themselves over all Nations, and re∣maining
for so many successions of Ages. The excessive abuses which were found in the years
1638, and 1639, both in the title and weight of the greatest part of the Moneys as well of
this Kingdom as of others, which had almost all of them been chang'd or disfigur'd, stood
in need of this excellent man to reform them, whose affection and zeal to the Publique might
produce so extraordinary effects: But as it was impossible to remedy it on the sudden without
putting Commerce into very great disorder, he, from the ill course of these Moneys which
for some time they were forced to connive at, well knew how to derive the greatest advantages
of State, and most signal honour to the King. And in effect, 'twas none of the least pieces of
Politiques, to permit and even authorise this abuse by an Edict, which could not else have
been so easily oppos'd; whil'st in the mean time, it invited the People of the neighbouring

States in hopes of gain, to transport into France all the light Gold and Silver which they
had, and which remain'd there by reason of its being decry'd few months after, bearing now
the Armes of France, with the Name and Effigies of Lovis le Juste, by that noble con∣version
which he order'd to be made of it. Whil'st this strange Matter was uniting to ours,
he sought out and discove'd prompt and easie expedients of giving it that excellent Form
which it now bears, curing at the same instant, and by the same remedy, both the present in∣convenience,
and that to come: Thus we see, that its just and equal roundness, the Grenetis
or graining which is about it, and the Politure which is on the flat of every piece, not onely
defends it from the Clipping, the File, and operation of Strong-waters, but even renders its
imitation in a manner impossible to our false Coyners; so as one may affirm of this Money, that
it is the most artistly contriv'd, and the most commodious, that ever was used in Commerce.
He caused to be coyned in less then four years above an hundred and twenty Millions, and
that after fifteen or sixteen years that the Warr had lasted, and the State seem'd to have been
utterly exhausted by the great and continual expences which were incessantly made, laid out
in fortifying of places, paying of Armies, and the assistance of the Allies of the Crown. At
the same time was the Louure seen to augment, and the Royal House of Fontainebleau,
which owe not onely a part of their Ornaments to the care of this great Minister, but their con∣servation
also and absolute restauration; since but for him, they had been at present but
one vast ruine, a very Carkass of building, desolate and uninhabitable: The Castles of S.
Germains and Versailles, which were then the ordinary residence and delices of the King,
carry on them some marks of the same hand; The first by the Construction of the noblest Sta∣bles
and Manege which is in France, with divers other accommodations necessary for the
lodging of a Royal Court; and the other, by a Terrasse de Gresserie, which is of the kind
an incomparable work, with a Circle of an hundred and twenty yards diameter: But
whil'st he thus worthily acquitted himself in the charge of Superintendent of the Royal
Houses and Buildings of France (with which the King was pleas'd to gratifie him for four
or five years) he employ'd in the mean time his chiefest cares for the safety and enlargement of
the Kingdom, dispencing all necessary Orders for the Armies both of Sea and Land; pro∣viding
and furnishing the Magazines and Garrisons of Places, and a good part of the
Provinces: But as things useful and necessary are to be preferr'd before splendour and mag∣nificense,
he first began with Military Architecture which he caused to march before the
Civil: All our Frontiers are full of his Works; In Picardy the Port-royal of Calais,
compos'd of two of the greatest Bastions of Massonry, the most regular and noble that are
in Europe: all the Fortifications of Ardres; most of the Bastions of Peronne, of S.
Quentin, of Han, of La Fere, Dourlans, Amiens, and of Montreuil, especially an Horn∣work
also of Massonry of extraordinary beauty, and magnitude; not to omit that half Moon
of Abbeville, where the Inhabitants not prevailing with him to have his Armes set on it,
in acknowledgment of the favour which they had by this means received (permitting it in no
place built by him, from a particular sentiment of honour to the King, and out of a most sin∣gular
modesty) planted two rows of Walnut-trees, that under that Pretext they might call it
by his Name: In Champagne, the Fortress of Mount Olympus, which serves Charleville
for a Citadel; several other Works at Stenay, at Mezieres, Mouzon, and Rocroy.

Then, in Lorrain, the Citadel of Nancy; the Places de Vic, Moyenvic, and of Marsal.
In Normandy, Havre de Grace; where (besides the Fortifications of the Place) he excavated
a large Basin of Masons work in the Port, of near two hundred yards long, and above six∣score
wide, to contain Vessels always afloat: Also at Brouage in the Isles of Xainctonge, which
are two maritime Keyes of the Kingdom. In Italy, Pignerole, and all the new Forti∣cations
of Cazal. Now for works and curiosities of Painting and Sculpture (which are as
'twere the two Sisters of the Art I am now going to treat of) it would require a large dis∣course
to particularize them one after another; besides that, one could not well do it, without
a little reproach to our Nation, which (by reflecting on sudden cessation of so many excellent
things) one would almost believe had but one onely person capable of those rare Productions.
It shall suffice then to say in general, that he made the Louure the Center of the Arts whose
concourse thither in a few years began to render it the most noble and magnificent Structure of
the World. It was for this glorious Design, and for the decoration of other Royal Houses,
that the famous Monsieur le Poussin had the honour to be sent for by the King at the begin∣ning
of the year 1640. It was then that the late M. de Noyers dispatch'd us, You and my
Self (dear Brother) towards his Holiness about an important affair, with order at our re∣turn
to make way for France to all the greatest Vertuosi of Italy; and as he was their
Load-stone, we easily drew a considerable number after him, whereof the Chief was that re∣nowned
and singular Painter M. le Poussin, the glory of the French in his Profession, and,
as it were, the Raphael of our Age: To this effect we likewise used great diligence to get
made, and collect together all that the leisure and the opportunity of our Voyage could furnish
us of the most excellent Antiquities, as well in Architecture as Sculpture; the chief pieces
whereof were two huge Capitals, the one of a Column, and the other of an angular Pilaster
from within the Rotunda, which we chose as the most noble Corinthian Models remain∣ing
of Antiquity: Two Medails of eleven Palms diameter, taken from the Triumphal Arch
of Constantine; threescore and ten Bas-reliefs moulded from Trajans Column, and several
other of particular Histories, some of which were the next year cast in Brass; others were
employed in manner of incrustation about the Compartiment of the arched Cieling of the
Louure great Gallery, in which M. le Poussin most ingeniously introduc'd them, and that
with an extraordinary address and consideration, to answer a certain design which was then
requir'd of him, not as the most magnificent, and superb he could have compos'd; but for an
Ornament which should be speedily executed, and of moderate cost, with regard to the time
and the impatient humour of our Nation. A little while after that, you returned (my dear
Brother) to obtain the Popes blessing of the two Crowns of Diamonds, and the Golden Babe
carried by an Angel, which their Majesties sent you to present our Lady of Loretto in acknow∣ledgment
and as a token of gratitude which they rendred to the Virgin for the most happy and
almost miraculous Birth of our Daulphin, the King which now reigns; You continued to have
divers figures and Bass-relievo's wrought off, particularly the Flora and the Hercules in
Farnese's Palace, of which there is now one cast at Paris: Two other Medails from the
same Arch of Constantine, and both the Colosses of Montecavallo with their Horses, the
greatest, and the most celebrated works of Antiquity, which M. de Noyers designed to have
also cast in Copper, to place them at the principal Entry of the Louure. You behold the splendor

which all this great Provision made in Rome, and how every body wonder'd that the French,
who were till now renown'd onely for their valour and invincible courage in Warr, and seem'd
to be affected onely to the Arts Military, should shew so much passion for These which as∣sum'd
the reputation of being the most glorious, by a Prerogative above others; as if the He∣misphere
of France had been lately chang'd, and Mercury in conjunction with Mars began
now to pour down new Influences upon her. For my own part, I can testifie how the report of
it spread as far as Constantinople, whither Fame had born the name of Monseigneur de
Noyers with so much glory, that the Patriarch of that renowned City writ him Letters full
of profound admiration, which he address'd to Monfieur de Villeray, a Noble Athenian
Resident in France for the Duke of Parma, delivering them to my Lord at Dangu after
his Retreat from the Court, and where I have had and kept them a great while, and read
them to several of my Friends. They take notice chiefly, how new and unheard of a thing it
was that there should be found a Grand Vizier of our Nation so transcendent in all excellen∣cies;
of which some markes he had seen, easily perswaded him to believe all the other marvels
which were reported of him: (these Exemplars were the Books of the Royal Press, and some
Pieces of Coyn) His Letter was somewhat prolix, and written in a more polite Style then the
vulgar Greek now spoken in that Country: It were great pity that a thing so memorable and
signal should be buried in oblivion, and therefore I take notice of it with more circumstances
then many others. But during all these mighty Projects, there happen'd a strange revolution
which in less then six Moneths changed the whole face of the State, by the death of that superla∣tive
Minister the great Cardinal de Richelieu, the very Column and Ornament of Monar∣chy;
and a short space after that, by the Recess of Monseigneur de Noyers; and imme∣diately
upon this, by that loss to all France, the King himself; so as all these noble beginnings
had none that follow'd them, there remaining not one of those which enter'd afterwards into the
management of the publique Affairs, who had, with their affections, the Knowledge and the
Talents which were requisite for the continuation of these great Designs. We then presently
beheld the work of the Louure abandoned, the finishing of the great Gallery to cease; and
generally all the Fortifications in France, without hopes of seeing the Work reassumed and ta∣ken
in hand again of a long time, it being necessary, for such an enterprise, to find assembled in
the same person (as it was seen in that of M. de Noyers) virtues and qualities both rare and
extraordinary. Besides, to produce such a one as he was, of an universal Genius and Capa∣city,
that loved the Arts with judgment, and cultivated them; that would neglect his pro∣per
Interest, to preserve that of the State and of the Publique, who, amids an Authority and ex∣treme
Favour, retaining still the modesty of a private man, thinks not of establishing his house,
and, against the ordinary course so natural to all men, should refuse to augment and heap up
riches, or seek Titles and Dignities for it, and that never took thought, or laboured, as did he
during an employment of twenty years (for the latter six of which he had almost the uni∣versal
management of State affairs) but for the safety, enlargement, and splendour of the
Kingdom; For such a Master-piece of nature, I say, there needs the efforts of many Ages:
The recompence of so many Virtues was very small on man's part, but great and inestimable
on God's who crown'd this illustrious life with a most happy death. I reserve as a treasure
inestimable a certain small Collection of the sayings of this holy Courtier, our most dear

Master, during the continuance of his Sickness, which was assisted by his Director the R. P.
de Sainct Jure who was with him to the last; and as I have had the sad consolation of being
present at this last act of his life, during which I remember to have heard from his own mouth
all that is contain'd in this recital, I am not able to read them without a great deal of tender∣ness,
and indeed without tears. He dyed in his Castle of Dangu on Friday the twentyeth of
October, at one a clock after noon, in the Year 1645. and in the six and fiftyeth of his Age,
two years and an half after his Recess from Court, his body being transported to the Church
of the Noviciat belonging to the Jesuits, which he had built in honour of St. Xauierius, and
destin'd for his Sepulchre. This Church is look'd upon as the most regular piece of Ar∣chitecture
in Paris; and though it be not so exceedingly charg'd with Ornaments, as some
others are, yet it appears very noble in the eyes of Intelligent persons; all that is there being
done with an attention and care so extraordinary. But that which in it excells all therest
is a Picture of one of the Miracles wrought by St. Xauier, which was Painted here at the
same time, with that admirable Supper of the Apostles (which he caused to be plac'd at the
Altar of the Chappel-royal of the Castle of St. Germains, where all the figures exceed
the natural:) both of them the Works of our famous Master le Paussine, and indeed worthy his
Pencil, though the first of them was Painted with extraordinary hast, and during the Winter.
You see (dear Brothers) a small draught of a part of the life of our most precious and most
honour'd defunct M. de Noyers, that incomparable Genius of France never to be sufficiently
praysed, never enough regreted, because comparable to the greatest examples of Antiquity.
I would by all means place him in the front of this Book of mine, to let the world see that I had
no other object in the finishing of this Work (of which he honour'd me with the charge) then
to render the same service and veneration to his Memory being dead, I could perform to his
Person were he yet alive. However, in reassuming it at your request; My first ardour be∣ing
much aloy'd, what was heretofore a liberal and divertissant Study during the presence of
my late Lord and Master, is now become a difficulty and a kind of constraint; since I have
been forc'd to alter, and even retrench divers particularities which were then very essential to
my designe, but would now have been altogether useless and unseasonable. Receive then (my
dear Brothers) this Fragment of a Book, so much at least as remains of it, and if there oc∣curr
any thing which may prove yet considerable in such clear and discerning eyes as yours are,
and that my designs seem worthy of any place amongst your other curiosities, you owe the
entire obligation of it to our common Friend Monsieur Errard, who was pleased to
take a great deal of pains to see it perfected; and has not only perswaded me (as well as you)
to publish it to the world, but has more then this contributed likewise to it, of his own labour
and particular elucubrations.
From Paris the
22. of May 1650.
