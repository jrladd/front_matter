BEhold (Right Honourable) in this Theater of mortalitie a Tra∣gedie, with a solemne funerall, at which the Goddesses are chiefe mourners, and the Muses attendants, wherein death plaies the Tyrannicall King or the kinglie Tyrant, your de are Ladie and wife the sub∣iect of his furie, which in a dumbe showe is heere presented by me: whereof I desire your

Lordshippe to be a spectator and a Iudge: If I haue wittilie plaide the fooles part in contriuing the matter (I thinke I haue plaid the wisest part:) And then I hope I shall haue your Lordships applause. And that is all I expect.
