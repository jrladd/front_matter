SIR,
BEeing inioyned by the Ghost or Genius of old Iohn Garret, (a man well known and beloued) to collect, gleane, or gather, a bundle or trusse of Mirth, and for his sake to bestrow the stage of the melancholly world with it; and withall to present it to some one generous spirit, who was old Iohns friend; I thought vpon ma∣ny to whom I might haue made my Dedication, who were both Royall, Honorable, Worshipfull, and all wel∣affected towards him: As to mention

one for all, that  of the world, & richest Iem of her sex, that Maga∣zine of the two inestimable Iewels, Patience and Fortitude; to that illustri∣ous peerelesse Princesse I might haue recommended it, to whose seruice, and for whose happinesse, his life and best endeauours, with his prayers and implorations at his death, were vn∣fainedly consecrated. But my man∣ners conceiuing the subiect of this Booke, of altogether to triuiall a na∣ture to be sheltred vnder the shadow of the wings of transcendent and ad∣mired Maiestie; I stept so many steps down the staires with my inuention, where by good fortune I met with you, whom I knew did loue that old honest mirrour of mirth, deceased; and whom the world better knows, are a true deuoted friend to honest harmelesse mirth; and laudable recre∣ation.
I therefore entreat you, that (when

your more serious affaires will per∣mit) you would bestow the looking vpon these my poore and beggarly wardrobe of witty lefts, whom I dare not call Apothegmes.
And because I had many of them by relation and heare-say, I am in doubt that some of them may bee in print in some other Authors, which I doe assure you is more then I doe know; which if it bee so, I pray you but to conniue or tollerate, and let the Authors make twice as bold with me at any time.
Thus wishing euery one to mende one, whereby the rent and torne gar∣ments of Threed-bare Time may be well and merrily patched and repai∣red, crauing your pardon, with my best wishes, I remaine
Yours euer in the best of my best .
