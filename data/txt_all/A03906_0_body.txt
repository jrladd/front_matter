CONSIDERING with my selfe (Right Worshipfull) on the one side, the painfull and profitable paines of the lear∣ned and godly set forth from time to time: but neuer more fully and clearely then in this our accepted day: (to God be the glory) so that in that res∣pect nothing can bee written, that hath not bin written: and on the other side, mine own exility or rather nothing to all; in selfe know∣ledge (as one speakes) more needing to reade than to write. I was persuaded & set, to com∣mit no more then I haue doone, to the presse. Notwithstanding, I may not bee mine owne nor follow my selfe: but as I haue heretofore beene ouer-ruled: so haue I been now againe, at the earnest and importunate sute of my dear frinds in Christ, to yeelde this sermon to the print. Whereupon as in generall I desire the fauourable iudgement of the reader: so of speciall duetie (in token of my thanke∣full minde) I am boulde to dedicate it to your Woorshippe, humblie crauing your fa∣uourable

acceptaunce of the same, and of that trueth and true comfort, which I haue therein, though according to my manner and small talent, yet faithfully deliuered. And so in wish of all prosperitie in Christ vnto you, I committe your Woorship and all yours, to the Almightie, who blesse you in all your waies and send you many good daies, to his good will and pleasure, Amen.
