Right Honourable,
THis Discourse humbly dedicates it self to you, having received Being from the Contempla∣tion of those late Monuments of Divine Displeasure, raised upon this Nation in General, and more directly over you. If you vouch∣safe it Acceptance and Patro∣nage, you give it the advantage of that Hill, upon which so Fa∣mous
 a City is set, that it may not be hid in its own obscurity. But as the great Tapers of Judgment, upon which it gazes, were thought fit to be exalted into so lofty a Candlestick; which in lower places had been as under a Bed or Bushel: So these Observations that would shine by their Beams, will be most happily fixed there, if it may be with your Favour and Al∣lowance.
There is nothing herein to plead so great a dignation from you, but,
First, an humble zeal to Divine Glory, the Counsel of which A∣theism darkens by words without knowledge; while it would set up petty Mechanicks of Evil at work in their dark shops, instead
 of that Almighty Hand, reaching down out of its own Heaven into this lower World, its own also: and in the room of that Jehovah, who knows no other besides him∣self in Heaven or Earth; or any that as he, creates good and evil; without whom no weapon formed to destroy, no Smith that blows in the coals for it, no waster that uses it, is erected.
Secondly, an affection of Ho∣nour to you, expressing it self in an endeavour to vindicate your Calamities out of all such rude, black, dark Lanthorn-hands, and to surrender them into his; by whom to be chastised without ha∣tred, how severely soever, is ho∣nourable; but by any other, ser∣vile and abject.

 From this Hand, even when it smites, if it be humbly and repen∣tantly turned to, drops a Balm that heals, and an Oyl of excellent kindness distils, that doth not break our heads, but soften our hearts: An Unguent that doth not only embalm us for suffering, but anoint us for Holiness and Happiness. This Rod, after it hath stricken, if it be accepted, blos∣soms in a night, and suddenly flou∣rishes with the peaceable fruits of Righteousness.
He that touches an affliction im∣mediately after God, by saith and obedience to the ends of it, shall find his fingers dropping with the sweet-smelling Mirrhe: but taken out of any other Forge, there is nothing to be felt, but the cold
 Iron prepared to mischief, and the impurity of it self, and the offices through which it hath passed.
He that ascribes our Ruines to any but God, sows them with salt and barrenness; he that assures them from him; gives us the upper and neither Springs of gracious motion to God, and Blessing from him.
All Paraphrases upon our Suf∣ferings out of the Atcheists Chair, are as the Corn that withereth be∣fore it groweth up, wherewith the Mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his Bosom; nor do any say, We bless you in the Name of the Lord: The true Interpretations of them lead us out to sow indeed in tears, but that we may reap in joy; that go∣ing
 forth, and bearing precious seed, we may come again rejoyce∣ing, and bring our sheaves with us. Who would not then chuse to find himself fallen into the hands of God, with whom tender mercies dwell, and gracious purposes mollifie the greatest rigours; as the harshness of medicaments is overcome with the sweetness of the health they design?
Who? except the stupid Ig∣norant, the Atheistick contemner of God and his Hand, the pro∣phane Sensualist, the hardned Im∣penitent, who hates to be reform∣ed; and therefore all evils upon them are the Brands of an Eternal Judgment, and print Hell upon their flesh; the private marks of which are first upon their Souls.

 But you, who have a wise and grave apprehension of all things, much more of those wherein you are concerned with God; espe∣cially in his solemn interviews with you, though of Judgment, will give Glory to him, by ac∣knowledgments, It is the Lord; and therefore will not walk con∣trary to him, but searching where∣in he hath been dishonoured, whe∣ther in denying that Amplitude, and Example to Religion, or al∣lowing freedoms to evil, will turn to him, by reducing things to an order, beseeming Humiliation un∣der his Hand; both within your private Walls, and in your more publick Administrations.
And this not only from Princi∣ples of self-preservation, but out of
 Gratitude, and love to those com∣passions, which interposed, that you should not be utterly consu∣med, as Sodom and Gomorrah, by a Judgment that so nearly resembled theirs.
From which compassions those vigorous designations and daily ri∣sing hopes of a new City, are now receiving life, which make this a fit season to present you these con∣siderations, seeing a holy Improve∣ment of passed Judgments is the best kind of Telesma against future Evils.
Now that Ruler of all the World, whose goings out are from everlasting, who of old laid the Foundations of this City, who prospered it into its late Gran∣deur, who derived upon it the
 confluence of that wealth, adorn∣ed with the Ingeny, Arts, and Learning of the whole World; decorated it with a Civick Autho∣rity; even to Majesty, ennobled it with the Thrones of England: who lately in righteous Judgment for sin, humbled, laid it low, even with the ground, that it yet sits (but brooding) upon its own ashes; raise it again out of them, increase the Glory of it seven-fold along succeeding Ages, draw it out of the fire a vessel of Honour refined, make his Church in it a brightest Candlestick of the Gospel of Peace, after it hath been a moun∣tain burning with fire, that could not be touched; create a new Hea∣ven and Earth in it, wherein Righ∣teousness may dwell, after this
 dissolution of Elements; make it exemplary for Reformation to this Nation, as it hath been for suffer∣ing, make the name of it for ever, Jehovah Shammah, The Lord is there.
