My Lords,
WEre it not that these un∣happy times have brought forth a sort of reasonless men, whose humors and Phancies led by an igno∣rance or Interest makes

them unwilling to submit to Laws, and the necessary and just means and Rules of Government, unless their under∣standing which in those quarrelling and contentious Sceptickes is little enough, may be convinced and satisfied with the Reason thereof; these my Labours might have seemed to be as needless as Physick for those which are in Health, and to be little more than a quarrel with my own Shadow: But they that hear the dayly complaints now more than e∣ver made against the Legal and just Priviledges of the Kings Servants, the affronts offered to the Majesty and Supreme Authority of the King by Arresting and Imprisoning them without leave first obteyned of the Lord Chamberlain of his most Ho∣nourable Houshold, or those other great Officers therein to whom it apper∣tayneth, and by bringing of Writs of Habeas Corpus by those which have been taken and Arrested by the Kings Mes∣sengers for their contempts therein, to be delivered by the subordinate Courts

of Justice against the mind and Authori∣ty of the King that Commissionated them and those many disparaging con∣tests which do arise thereupon, with the unwarrantable Opinions now put to Nurse, that the King cannot in such a case protect his Servants, without a great delay or hindrance of the Execution of Justice, that they being Outlawed may be Arrested, whether he will or no; And that he hath so conveyed his Justice to his Courts of Justice, as he is not in the case of his Servants to intermeddle therein: may I hope Apologize for my undertaking and endeavors to perswade them out of those and some other their great mistakings and Errors, which may produce a neglect and slighting of Authority, and many an unforeseen evil consequence.
In the management whereof, I can call my most reserved and private thoughts to witness, and they will therein (I am confident) acquit me that I have not built an Altar to flattery, or made any design or hopes of prefer∣ment

to be my guide or incitement thereunto, but have done what I now present unto you, only to maintain the Honour and respect which is due to our Soveraign Lord the King and his Ser∣vants, casta mente & manu accompanied with a principle and opinion that he de∣serves to be accompted the greatest of vil∣laines, that would make it his design to lessen or detract from any of the Kings Rights, Prerogative and just means of Go∣vernment, and to be ever infamous, that for any ends whatsoever, would endeavor to diminish or take away any of the peoples Legal Rights, Liberties and Priviledges; And in that middle way and path of Truth and doing Right to all Parties, have no intention to give any assistance for the defrauding, or too much delay∣ing of Creditors just debts, or stop∣ping the course of Justice in any the peoples Actions or Prosecutions of their rights, or for remedies against Wrongs or Injuries done unto them by any indirect course or shelter for such as shall only pretend themselves to be the

Kings Servants, when they are not truly or really thereunto entituled.
In which my Labours, if any shall undervalue the Authorities which I have brought from the Laws of Nations, Customs or usage of all or the most of our Kings and Princes, and the Civil Law that great repository of Reason and Pru∣dence to fortifie my assertion of the Pri∣viledges of the Kings Servants; they may please to understand that they are principally derived from the Laws of Nations, Civil Law and universal right Reason, consonant and agreeable to our common Laws, which have instru∣cted and guided themselves by many a maxime and piece of right Reason which they have received from them.
Or shall say that the Records of this Kingdom which have been cited in Con∣formity thereunto, are only fit to make a history, but do serve for no proof, as some of those of the long robe have with much Injury unto them and themselves, and the Truth not long ago been pleased to say, or that the old things are passed away:

those Antiquities are obsolete and little to be regarded; Wee are now upon a new way, the Law hath been much al∣tered and changed, and those evidences and venerable Monuments of Time, being the vestigia and footsteps of anti∣ent Laws and Customs are not to be much respected.
And will adventure to vent such Do∣ctrines or Opinions, and make themselves, as Gutherius a learned French Ad∣vocate complaineth, Gutherius de Offic. do∣mus August. lib. 1. ca. 1, guilty of the neglects of those very necessary and use∣full parts of Learning and Knowledge, which are to be found in the Treasuries of Time and Antiquities, may upon better consideration, find cause to be∣lieve that the Reason of Laws doth ne∣ver Expire, that the unerring Wisdom of the Almighty that Writ some Laws with his own Finger, and commanded his beloved people of Israel to repeat them Deut 4.32. to their Children and after Ge∣nerations, to ask of the days that were past, and which were before them since the day that God Created man upon the

Earth, and that Bildd the Suhite one of Jobs Friends, Job 8. v. 8, & 9. gave him no ill Counsel, when he advised him to en∣quire of the former Age, and prepare him∣self to the search of his fathers, and en∣forceth it by a Reason, that we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a Shadow; Jer. 6. v. 16. and the giver of all Wisdom did long after by his holy Spirit (in the Prophet Jeremy) enjoyn them to stand in the ways, and see and ask for the old Paths, that in the making of new Laws, and the amending or correcting of the old: The knowledge of those which have been altered, repealed or laid aside, is not a little necessary, to the end, that by the old, we may see the necessity and per∣fection of the new, and by the old, how to avoid the failings which might hap∣pen in the Interpretation or Execution of the new, that the Graecians had their Nomophilaces ad quos rerum gestarum con∣signatio pertinebat, Craigius de repub. Lace∣daemon. lib. 2. ca. 2. utextarent Monu∣menta Publica, ad quae recurrere liceret quum aliqua in re majorum exemplum

requireretur, and that the Romans so greatly valued▪ their old Records, as they gave great Preferments and Honours to Flavius a Scribe or Notary: Livius lib. 9.349, & 350. And the Priviledge of a Curule Chaire, for publish∣ing and bringing some of them to light, that all other Civilized Nations, and even those of China and Japan have highly esteemed their Records and Memorials, that in our Parliaments, Courts of Justice and Chancery, Records and precedents in any Matters or Cases of Difficulty, are not seldome enquired after, and directed to be searched, that the Dates, Clauses or Words of some Acts of Parliament, and the Reports of Cases adjudged have been found to have been mistaken, and rectified after by the Records; That it is Felony to imbezill or corrupt a Re∣cord, that Courts of Records are more Honoured and esteemed than those which are not, and that the Law will not permit a Record to be averred against, or much gainsaid.
And that such a care was taken of our Records by our Ancestors, as the

Commons of England did  Cause in their Petition of Parliament, in the 46th year of the Reign of King Edward the 3d Petit. Parl. 46 E. 3. stile them the peoples Evidence, and pray to have upon their occasions a free and uninterrupted ac∣cess unto them. Our Kings have in se∣veral of their Reigns, made allowances of Money, and Expences for the Calen∣dring and well ordering of them, and caused them to be kept and preserved in places of strength and safety, whereby to secure them from the fury of Wars or Fire, or other destroying Casual∣ties.
That if the Reports of cases adjudg∣ed upon Demurrers or special Verdicts, and the responsa prudentum, and carefull and well Studied Arguments of the Judges, such as the Learned, Mr. Plowdens Commentaries, and the Re∣ports of Dier, Anderson, Coke, Crooke, Hobart, and other the Labours and Me∣morials of the venerable and learned sages of our Laws (the Errors too often attending the Works and Labours of

all Mankind only excepted) do de∣serve their ust esteem and value, and are a light and guide to the Reason and Judgement of Posterity and after Ages▪ and the more when they have the assi∣stance of the Records to back and War∣rant them, and that even Histories are the better when they keep in the sight and Company of Records, and enjoy their Assistance.
And if in their Truth and Evidence they conduce much to that verity and certainty which ought to be in Histories, our Records certainly cannot by any Reason or Rules of Prudence be belie∣ved or understood to be useless or unne∣cessary for the Study or asserting of the Truth▪ and Rationality of our Laws, and the Rules and Method thereof.
Nor are those Jewels of Time to be ranked with Romances, or such Triviall things as may claim no more than a Cur∣sory and careless reading, when if carefully, as they ought to be entred, and kept they do give us the Certainty and Truth of matters of

fact, and do not seldome intimate or Illustrate the Causes and Reason there∣of.
And may well deserve a better Credit than any Reports of cases adjudged or re∣sponsa prudentum, some of which are but Opinions and Answers not seldom sud∣dainly and unpremeditately given to the many times ill or untruly put State of the case or question by the Advocates and Lawyers at the Barr, or than any of the most severe and impartial Histories, which although they have been by the Wisest & Major part of all Nations for many Ages past, believed to be great and excellent Luminaries in their several Spheres, and should be Testes veritatis, yet if the Re∣cords of every Nation, who have the happiness to have them, being Tabulae & Monumenta Publica the faithfull Re∣gisters of past Actions are allowed to be good to make Histories, which are grea∣ter Strangers unto them than they should be, and are too often written without any acquaintance with them) that surely which crediteth and maketh them the

better to believed, is not less but more to be valued, for a sad experience hath told us, that the destroying of the Books of the old Philosophers by Aristotle, and the for∣mer Books of the Civil Law, by Justinian when he compiled his Code and Insti∣tutes, and of our English Books and Ma∣nuscripts, when Polidore Virgil and his Hi∣story would not willingly suffer any o∣ther to be his Competitors, did much ob∣scure and hinder the Knowledge and light, which is now more dark and hidden than otherwise it would have been; And we may believe, that if Records, and faith∣full, and Antient Memorials had ever de∣served, as they never did, to be slighted, they might now be spared and admitted into their former reputation, and not be made to truckle under Reports of Cases adjudged, when our last twenty years Confusion, have by the Knavery and Imposture of too many of the Stationers, furnished out abundance of certain frag∣ments of Laws, and untrue and mista∣ken Reports, and too many Histories of the World have suffered in the want of

the most necessary Aid of Re∣cords, when so great a part of the Knowledge of the first Ages of the World was washed away by the Deluge, and the learning and Experience of ma∣ny Ages after, lost by the want of Let∣ters, which the Wars, and the rude and unruly Behaviour of those early Generations would not admit, and that to despise Records and Anti∣quities, is to proclaim us, as Tully the most excellent Roman Orator long ago said, to be willing to be Children as of yesterday, and to have no re∣trospect into the Wisdom of the Anti∣ents, and experiences of past Ages, teaching us wherein some have succeeded and others miscarryed, is to put our selves into as short a Memory as that of the Thracians, some of whom were Reported not to be able to number or reckon any further than four years, or to make light incertain or loose traditions, the most we can reach or attain unto, and refuse the ante Acta vitae, which were wont to be the faithfull guides and Conductors of

our Actions to come, and may render those who despise the old, and only de∣light in new things, to be in no better a Condition than some of the worthy and learned Assembly of the Royal Society of Gresham Colledge, who by not heed∣fully considering old things have unhap∣pily been drawn into the field, and en∣forced to encounter with Mr. Henry Stubs his Animadversions, wherein he undertakes to prove that some things which they thought to be new, have been of a much more Early date.
So as whether Reports of Cases ad∣judged in Law, be old or new, well or ill taken, both they and Histories are to acknowledge the Records to be their Superiours, and that they are in all things the better for their acquaintance.
And those great Obligations must neither be denied or forgotten, which our Laws do owe unto the Records of of this Kingdom, and our great Seldens Intimacy and familiarity with them, by whose learned Labours and Observati∣ons, we have had the benefit of the dis∣discovery

and dispelling of many an Er∣ror, and of the Illustration of many diffi∣cult and dark Notions and places in our Laws, by which his great insights and inquiries into the English Records and Antiquities, and the Seuerest part of the Learning of our Common Laws and the Civil Law, and Laws of many Nations, he became enabled, and was as a learned Forreigner, hath justly stiled him a Dictator or migh∣ty man of Learning, to giving aid and assistance tanquam de Throno sapientiae to the republick and Posterity of good Letters and Learning, his Knowledge therein being so singularly exquisite, Sur∣mounting and Supereminent, as he was not unfitly said to be decus & gloria gentis Anglorum, and if Nature could have so long have kept him from the fate of Mortality, ought to have survi∣ved many Centuries more, and have con∣tinued his admired Course in Learning, untill the period and end of the World, for that as Sir John Vaughan Knight, now Lord Chief Justice of the Court of

Common Pleas, his contemporary and most intimate associate in those more severe Recherces and choice pieces of Learning and Antiquities hath since his death, bemoaning the loss and want of such a Treasury of Learning, not long since well expressed it. Debuit cum mundo mori it was too great a loss to the World and after Generations, that he should dye before it, for although the neglect of Records and Antiquities which might have a greater veneration than this Age is willing to bestow upon it, have of late been so much undervalued as to be termed rusty and motheaten, and those which do give them their true esteem and value, superstitious Porers and Doters upon them; So as the la∣borious Learned and well deserving An∣tiquarie Mr. William Dugdale was not without Premisses to Warrant his Con∣clusion, when with some regret mixt with facetiousness he said that for any man in these Times, to busie himself in the old Records, or to spend his Time & Candle in the search & sifting of Antiquity, it would

by the little incouragements which have been given unto it, amount unto as small a Profit or Purpose, as to set up and keep a shop to sell old fashon'd Hose, Trunk-Breeches, and long wasted Dublets, and expect to gain by it. To so great a mispris and scorn are those usefull inqui∣ries and Lamps of Learning fallen into, when as they do draw out of the pit and devouring Jawes of Time, many a pretious and hidden Truth, and are not seldome the only rescuers of it, and was better respected when old Marculfus Wrote his Formulae's Pancirollus his deper∣dita, and when Brissonius and Pasquier, Camden, Selden, Linden brogius, our Learn∣ed Sir Henry Spelman, and Mr. Dugdale, and many other Worthies not here en∣numerated, made it their Business to discover them, and the very Learned Sir Robert Cotton was at so great an Expence of Money and Time to Redeem so many as he did from the Captivity of an everlasting Oblivion, which hath taken away and concealed many a Truth from the former Genera∣tions,

this present Age which are to come, and to dig in those hidden Mines of incomparable Treasure; But when the scorners of this Age shall have surfeited with the villifying of the Wis∣dom of the former, and the Experiences of men and times past, which Solomon, in the high and not to be valued Price, which he did put upon Wisdom, and the Incouragement which he gave to the Study and search after the Riches and Treasures thereof, would never have ad∣vised them unto: They or some other after them may learn to forsake that grand piece of resolved folly, by what this Nation and the Kingdoms of Ireland and Scotland have so greatly suffered in the late time of Rebellion and Confusion, by some of our Lawyers and too many of our Nation, not understanding the Rights and Prerogative of the King, which the old Records of the Kingdom did, and will always abundantly witness, and by too many of the Inferior Clergies Igno∣rance of the Ecclesiastical Histories and Primitive times which did not a little con∣tribute

unto it, and believe that the great∣est disservice which can be done to Prin∣ces to endeavour to advance their Prero∣gative beyond the Laws of the Land, right Reason, and the necessary and just means of Government, and that on the other side they are small Friends or rather great E∣nemies to the Publick, that will go about to perswade the People or entitle them to more Liberties than the Laws well in∣terpreted will allow them, that there is a Justice to be done to the King in giving unto him that which belongeth unto him, and in not denying his just and Legal Rights, as well as a Justice to be done by him, in what shall concern his people and their Liberties; That there is a Maje∣sty due to Kings, and that the Rights of their Courts, Palaces and Servants, are neither to be neglected or continu∣ed.
And therefore if the Romans those great Champions and Patrons of Li∣bertie, were so Jealous and Watchfull in the Preservation of the Honours and respects due unto Magistracy and Su∣periority,

as their Consul Fabius would rather for the time forget the Honour due and payable from a Son to his Fa∣ther (of which that Nation were great observers) than relinquish any thing of it, and commanded by a Lictor or Officer his Aged Father Fabius (the Renowned preserver of Rome) in a Publick assembly, to alight from his Horse and do him the Honour due unto his present Magistracy, which the good old man, although many of the People did at the present dislike, did so much approve as he alighted from his Horse, and embracing his Son, said, Euge fili sapis qui in∣telligis, quibus imperes, & quam mag∣nam Magistratum imperes, I may give my self an Assurance that your Lord∣ships will with greater reason make it your endeavours, not only to preserve the Rights of Majesty, but the Rights and Pri∣viledges of those great and Honourable Offices and places, which you hold un∣der the King our Soveraign, and be as willing as your great and Honourable

Predecessors in those Offices, were to transmit them to their Successors, in no worse condition than they found them.
Which that it may equally be done in that particular of the Kings Ser∣vants just Rights and Priviledges is the only design of the ensuing vindi∣cation of them, and the Honour and respect due unto our Soveraign, and submitted to you Lordships Judg∣ment and Consideration, humbly in∣treating your Lordships to pardon any the Errors or failings therein, which in the haste of the Press my de∣sire to keep pace with it, when I was crebris intermissionibus & aliorum negotiorum incursionibus frequenter inter∣pellatus might easily happen, and more especially in an undertaking of that Na∣ture nullius ante trita pede, being a Path never before (as I could perceive) trodden by any but
