My Lord,
WHen I writ my Peaceable and Friendly Address to the Nonconformists, it was my design to ∣press my self so clearly as to give no just occasion for mistake or cavill; and so calmly as to give no Offence to any Man, except he would be angry with me, either for being of a disserent o∣pinion from him, or else for fairly offering my Reasons why I am so.
I was therefore in hopes, that if any of our Nonconforming Brethren should think fit to answer what I had written, he would lay aside all heat and animosity, and all such Exceptions as are manifestly trifling and impertinent; and only urge what might be of some real strength and moment in the Controversy; and that with the same Mildness and Charity as I had endeavoured to do before him.
But instead hereof an Adversary has lately appeared against me, who, as he seems to have but very little regard either to Charity, or even to Truth; so has he taken very much pains to perplex and tangle, instead of clearing and plaining the dispute that is between us. And as he has raked together what∣ever dirt he could to throw at the Church, the Law, and Your
 Grace, as well as at me (but still without any just ground for all his Calumnies) so has he, by the ambiguity of his Expres∣sion, the inticcy of his way of Reasoning, and his Mise∣gati is of the Holy Scripture, Raised such a mist of Sophistry in thi Controversy, as may prhaps dazle the eyes of an unry Reaer, or impose upon some of his own Party, whose prjudic will nt permit thm impartially to consider things, but cnnot, as I cceive, have any manner of Influence upon any sober and understanding Man; Except it may be to move him to have the worse opinion of that Cause, which is maintained and uphld after this manner, and of that Person, whoever he be, that thus violates the plain Laws of God, while he pretends his Conscience to be so tender as that he cannot Conform to the Constitutions of the Established Church.
To this disingenious Man I have here returned an Answer; And have done it with as much mildness as I thought the Case would hear: Yet not forbearing sometimes to express a just In∣dignation against such palpable prevarications as I have Con∣victed him of. And whatever my performance is I humbly sub∣mit it to your Graces censure: And with my most hearty Pray∣ers for your Graces both Temporal and Eternal Happyness, I remain,
Cork, October 1. 1698.
