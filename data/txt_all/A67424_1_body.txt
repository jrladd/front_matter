Right Honourable, and Right Worshipful,
MIsconception and Erroneous Tradition, which have so much perverted and corrupted the radical path and order of Primitive Invention, and almost obliterated the true In∣tentions of Antiquity both in Philosophy and History; have also in this general In∣fection traduced even Heraldry; witness, the manifold Errors and egregious Mistakes, which by industrious Enquiry and sedulous Search, I have discovered in divers of the Companies Es∣cutcheons, and Corporations Coats of Arms in this Honourable City of London, since they were first conferred upon them in the gracious Grants of their respective Patents under the Great Seals of several Kings of England, committed through the stupidity and careless performances of divers Artificers, (viz.) Painters, Plaisterers, Gravers, and Carvers; whose absurdities are of late advanced in the most eminent and conspicuous Places of very beautiful and stately Struct∣ures: who were first of all unadvisedly misled by putting faith in false Copies; such as have been lately, and now are, exposed to publick Sale in Graving and Printing. Which when I had suffi∣ciently considered, I was much concerned what dishonourable reflections it might cast upon so many Worshipful Companies and Worthy Corporations; and was troubled to think that those Loyal Societies, who have so much Truth in their Hearts, should have so much Error in their Arms, and began to think of a Reformation, which with much care and cost I obtained by the conveniency of surveying distinctly their ancient Patents, wherein I found in what manner the several Kings of Arms had from time to time given them their Shields, Charge, Crests, Supporters, and Motto's; which I forthwith Copied for some, with the exami∣nation of Ancient Records for others: and reduced them to truth and order; in the exact∣ness of Draught and curiosity of Sculpture; So large, that a judicious Eye with pleasure may be∣hold them; So true to the Rules of Dimension, Proportion, Correlation, Position, Posture, and Symmetry, that now they will endure the most curious examinations of the Nicest Criticks, and consequently prove and continue authentick Copies for Futurity; and also be a likely means to suppress and annihilate all those erroneous Draughts that have misguided the over-credulous Imi∣tators. And having with great Charge and Labour thus finisht this my Undertaking, and knowing how much your Lordship and Ye his Brethren concern your selves in Advancing and Rewarding all Endeavours for the preservation of the Honour of this Famous City, and the several Societies and Corporations thereof; I cannot but promise my self that this my Work will be graciously received and entertained by such Indulgent Patrous, and accordingly be esteemed and valued by the several Societies and Corporations; to whom, as I have hereby endeavoured to express my Zeal for their Service, so I shall make it the business of my Life to approve my self
