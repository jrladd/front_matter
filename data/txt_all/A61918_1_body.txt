GENTLEMEN.
FOr a more noble Epithite I know not how to give you (the greatest & best of men on earth being in truth no more.) These ensuing Reports were at first briefly taken by me in the Law-french, without any thought of making other use of them, then for my one privat satisfaction, And they did for some time after lye so confusedly scattered in my Note-books, that as they then lay, they were altogether uselesse to any but my self, and that not without much expence of time and great trouble, so that what of them my unhappy memory could not retain, (which was not much) was in a manner lost as wel to my self, as unto others; to remedy this inconvenience, (if I may so call it,) of the losse of my constant attendance, & pains for so many years to∣gether taken at the now upper Bench Bar, with very litle profit either to others or my self, than some small improvement of my knowledge in the practical part of the law, and in pursuance of that antient Moral Axiome, Omne agens agit propter aliquem sinem, I was encou∣raged to continue my travail, and expence of time in the gathering together, transcribing, and putting of them into that order, and method you now behold them, yet as then not having any intent or desire to make them publique, but only more readily usefull to my self, and such of my Friends and Acquaintance as should at any time desire to be satisfied in any thing I was able to impart unto them. But this not answering the expectation, and importunities of some of my neer relations, and many of my intimate Friends and Acquaintance, nor knowing into whose hands my papers might fall, nor how my self and others be injured in the publishing of them after my decease, which I was uncertain when it might happen, and did believe it could not be many years off, by reason of my declining years; but more especially in respect of the weak and crasy constitution of my Body much macerated by sharp, and tedious sicknesses, and being willing to leave some testimony behind me, that I have not slighted, or wholy neglected my calling, but have ever had an honourable esteem of it, though I have hitherto reaped but little of that benefit, which too too many do so eagerly hunt after, but have been doing something therein, and have not lived altogether a drone for so many years together in so famous a Society amidst so many learned men, to the dishonour thereof, and to my one reproach; I did at last resolve (notwithstanding the unavoi∣dable censures, which I was confident I should meet withal, what e∣ver I have, or could say to avoid them,) to give way to this publicati∣on
of them, even in this age, wherein most of the Cases, and matters herein reported are yet fresh (I suppose) in the memories of ma∣ny, who may easily trace me where ever I step awry; But I hope to find them not only just in vindicating of me, in that which I have truely and faithfully reported, but also favourable in censuring, and passing by those slips and misprisions they may herein meet withall, caused either by the Printers negligence, or my own mis∣apprehension of the sense of the matters, and things delivered and spoken unto, and the rather, in regard that I have endeavoured as neer as I could to render things in the same expressions they were first uttered, that so I might as much as might be, avoid the danger of injuring of any herein concerned, by putting another sense upon them, than what they intended; and this as it was the old way, so I conceive what ever may be objected to the contrary, that it is the best, and cleerest way of reporting. For those, that make it their businesse to censure, and not to read or understand books, I shall say nothing to them, but leave them to abound in their one sense if they have any, and to please themselves with their own phansies. I have made these Reports speak English, not that I believe they will be thereby generally more usefull, for I have been always, and yet am of opinion, that that part of the Common Law which is in English hath only occasioned the making of unquiet spirits conten∣tiously knowing, and more apt to offend others, than to defend themselves; but I have done it in obedinece to authority, and to stop the mouths of such of this English age, who though they be as confusedly different in their Minds and Iudgements, as the builders of Babel were in their languages, yet do think it vain, if not impious to speak or understand more than their own mother-tongue. Some may peradventure, Notwithstanding the reasons I have formerly offered for this my publication, be ready to object that it was vain, glory, and a too confident boldnesse, and high conceipt of mine own abilities that makes me thus appear in publique; but those that know me I believe are of another opinion, and dare clear me of this aspersion, and well they may, for the truth is I have alwayes been, and yet am so naturally distrustful of my own parts, that I fall far short of that necessary boldnesse which is requisite for every man to be armed withall in the excercising of publique employments, and what losse I have suffered by the want of this, I my self do best know, and is not unknown to many, some of whom have out of their well-wishes to me, and others to my disparagement (as they thought) been pleased to take notice of it. If any of the Cases and matters herein conteined seem common unto any, and are to insi∣pid to please their curious Palates, let them passe them over: It may be they may prove usefull to others, and I doubt not but the most curious may find many things that may give them delight and satisfaction. And in the farther vindication of these Reports, I shall de∣sire all to take notice, that first, these were most of them) taken in un∣setled times, wherein the Law was almost at a stand, and therefore
it cannot be reasonably expected they should be so quick and full of matter, as those that have been gathered when the Laws flowed in a more open, and uninterrupted Chanell, when the Courts of Iu∣stice were full fraught with businesse, and were in a more splendent and flourishing condition than in these latter times; and next, that this work is not a collection only of some choice Cases taken by se∣veral hands in all the Courts of Westminster; but is only a continued narrative of the Cases, and proceedings of the new upper Bench Court for 10 years together, and taken by one only hand, without the help or assistance of any other, during which time I have o∣mitted but little, saving when by reason of sicknesse, I was for a Term or two constrained to be absent. And the more to encourage all to the perusall of them, I dare affirm that there is much various matter contained in them, & different from what is to be found in o∣ther Reports taken in former years, occasioned by the many altera∣tion of the face of things, and the changes of government happing at this time, and also by reason of my constant observing, inserting, and interweaving of all the remarkable passages transacted on the Criminal side, with those hapning on the Pleas side, which in other Reports hath very sparingly at any time, if at all been perfor∣med. I have also for the Readers greater ease and benefit, added hereunto three Alphabetical Tables, the first containing the names of the several Cases; a second containing the several general Heads, or Titles under which the several matters dispersed through the whole book, are properly digested; and the third, and last, being a large Table particularly directing to the Page and Case, wherein you may find the subject matter methodically ranged under those Heads or Titles. And for your further and fuller satisfaction, and making the Cases the cleerer proof, and more authentical authority to be cited and given credit unto, you have the number Rolles pre∣fixed to most of those that are remarkable amongst them. I might, and would if I had thought it necessary have much enlarged these Reports, and made the volume swell to a far greater bulk: But my aim and endeavours have generally been to take the chief points only, and substance of the matters arising and spoken unto, and the rational parts of the arguments and autho∣rities used and urged, to inforce and prove what was surmised to be Law on either side, and the grounds and authorities upon which the opinions and resolutions of the Court are framed and given, and to passe by all the luxuriant flourishes of wit, and the multiply∣ing of Similary Cases to the Cases in question, as serving more for the most part to prove the curious phansy, & much reading of the Ar∣guer, than the proof of the points of the cases in question, or the satis∣faction, or information of the Auditors or Readers Iudgment; and I have ever (yet with submission to better Iudgements,) conceived this concise way of taking Reports to be farr more beneficial and de∣lightful, not only to the Reporter, but also to those that shall read
them, then that long and tedious way, wherein the truth is so over∣shadowed with multiplicity of words, that it is very difficult through those Clowds to discover, and behold her perfect beauty so well, as when she appears bare-faced in her true and natural complexion. I need not say any thing in commendation of the Common Laws, they do so sufficiently, and clearly speak their own worth, not only in our own land, but even through the Christian, if I may not say the whole known world. The fruit that every one from him that sits on the Throne, to her that grindeth at the Mill, throughout this nation in the tender preservation of our Religion, Lives, Liberties, and Pro∣perties do lowdly proclaim their excellency, and do justly claim our reverent esteem of them, and their sweet influence which our Neighbour Nations do partake of from their light and heat, hath purchased an honourable name, and repute amongst them. Though no doubt but other Kingdomes, and Republiques have many excel∣lent written and established Laws sutable to the particular consti∣tutions of the people, and to their several frames of government, and amongst the rest the Civil or imperial Laws, yet they all want many remarkable excellencies that are in the Common Laws of England, and the proceedings therein, and amongst the rest to in∣stance in no more, they are very deficient in this way used in our Law for many ages past, of reporting, and leaving to posterity the learned arguments of councel at the Bar, and of the grave and pro∣found resolutions of the reverend Iudges in the decision of Cases a∣rising, and controverted amongst us; and this way how sightly soever it be now esteemed of by many amongst us, yet is by Strangers much valued, and was heretofore so much set by amongst us, and thought so highly advantageous to the publique, that the wisdome of this State did then think fit to appoint grave and judicious men, encouraged by an annual stipend, to attend and perform this task, and therefore I hope that he who hath undertaken this hard labour freely and vo∣luntarily in relation to the publique good, without hope of reward, is so far from deserving blame and reproof, that he is rather to be cherished and countenanced in these his endeavours by those in au∣thority, and not to be rashly and uncharitably calumnicated, or censured by any, but to be favourably interpreted, and received as one that makes it his aim to be accompted a true lover of the Common Laws, and really honoureth the profession, and Profes∣sors thereof.
Inner Temple, May the 19th. 1658.
