THe great and par∣ticular
friendship,
which Antonio Gra∣tian,
my brother,
that is in Heaven,
Counsellour of his Majesty, and
Secretary to his royall person,
did finde with your Honour,
obliges mee, to acknowledge

it, and to accompt of it, as all
the good wits of this age doe:
behoulding in your Honour,
those testimonies, which you
have afforded us in Armes, Go∣vernment,
and writings, of his
much vertue, great courage and
cleare understanding. For ha∣ving
at thirteene yeares old,
begun to serve his Majesty in
the Warrs, and not forgetting
the exercise of learning, as we
may perceive by the pledges,
which Spaine enjoyes, and ex∣pects
from your Honours wis∣dome,
in the governing of the
holy brother-hood, of Andalu∣zia:
which your Honour takes
charge of: he hath shewed his
worth, so that in one yeere
wherein he served, by condem∣ning
a great number to death
and the Gallies, he hath secured
this Province, which was so
wasted with robbers; And I am
confident the Divine, and hu∣mane

Majesty, will grant your
Honour, the reward which
such workes deserve, which my
Galateo did rightly consider, in
beseeching of your Honour, to
accept of it, with the same af∣fection,
it is offered. Our Lord
preserve the right renouned
person, of your Honour, many
dayes, with as much increase
of wealth as is possible. From
Madrid the 10. of Ianuary, 1582.
Much renowned Sir,
