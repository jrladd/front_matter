GENTLEMEN,
HIs Sacred MAJESTY's long Absence, being the fruit of our sins, was also, and that de∣servedly, the subject of our Sorrow: His MAJESTY's late return, be∣ing, as we hope, the Answer of our Prayers, is now, and that deservedly too, the Mat∣ter of our Joy. The Argument of this

Sermon, is, the return of David, King of Israel, to Ierusalem; and to whom can I then present it, but to You, who have been Instruments, of our Choyce, but in Gods hand, to bring back our David, King of England, to his Ierusalem too.
I dare not expect your Patronage for this poor Discourse; I humbly beg your Acceptance: in my own and our Cor∣poration's name, I offer you this Mite of Thanks, instead of a Talent of Debt. I do, and ever shall want, Ability to make a Pay∣ment; but, I hope, I shall never want Inge∣nuity to make an Acknowledgment. I can do no more, but beg a blessing upon your Persons, Families, and consultati∣ons for the establishment of this Church and Nation upon the sure foundation of Truth and Peace.
