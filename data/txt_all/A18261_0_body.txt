NOtwithstanding your rare perfections in so many knowledges, which haue adorned you and you them, let not, worthie Lady, one sole qualitie of mine seeme the rather insufficiency to your iudgement, or breed lesse acceptance for being offered alone. It commeth out of a profession worthie some grace, and hath in it humors variable for delights sake. I offer them as that wher∣by I can best expresse my seruice to you, and you may (if it please you) make vse of them at your idlest houres. Manie causes I haue to imbolden mine attempts of dutie to you, and your fauours stande in the top of them: others there are more secrete, and lie in the nature of your owne ap∣prehension. And howsoeuer the policie of times may hold it vnfit to raise men hum∣bled with aduersities to titles of dearnesse, whether to shunne charge, or expresse pride, I rather know not, yet you I hope out of the honour of your nature, will vouch∣safe your fauours to a forward seruant, so neerely tied to a dutifull deuotion. In what ranke you please to place me, I will not change mine order. It shal be promotion to me that you account of me in any place, and all the commendations I seeke to my labors in this woorke, if you will be pleased to heare it at some times, and protect it at all times. Thus your ladiship hauing heard what I cā say in this first leafe, you may (if it please you to vouchsafe acceptance) heare what I haue song in the rest that follow. And so I rest:

From Cauendish this 24 of Iuly.
