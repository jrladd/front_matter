My very much honoured in the Lord,
THE reason of this in∣scription is not be∣cause you are prefer∣red by God, by your birth, family, estate, and other outward priviledges, to

be the chief of the Inhabitants of my Parish: for although I ac∣knowledge the Wisdom and Will of God, as the cause of this or∣der and distinction among men; and therefore do heartily give you the honour which belongs to you upon this account; yet I must confess, that this is not the cause of this publick acknowledg∣ment: But the reason is, that whereas many great persons are a great curse to their Countrey, which they fill with their own sins, and Gods Judgments; God hath made you the blessing of your Age, in endeavouring to fill your place with the Name, and King∣dom, and Will of Jesus Christ; and that in the great changes of our daies, you have not, as many, served the times, and your sins, but served the Lord, and your Ge∣neration: And also because of your great honour, and love to the godly, able, and Orthodox Mini∣sters

of Christ, and to his holy, humble, sober, and peaceable peo∣ple, which have been loathsome to others, as the sink of the world; but savoury to you, as the salt of the earth: for which although you have joyfully suffered reproach from some; yet you have had the honour, like that gracious couple, Andronicus and Junia, to be of note among the Apostles: And par∣ticularly, that you were of the first that called me to exercise my Ministry in this place, wherein I have by your constant favour and countenance received much com∣fort and encouragemet: The sense of all which, together with my great joy in you, by my hopes of your being of the blessed number of those who are really joyned to Jesus Christ, and cloa∣thed with his righteousness, and who bring forth fruit in him, (which alone can make of you a sweet savour to God, and for that

reason precious, and acceptable to his Saints) hath caused me to signifie my sincere honour, and love, and thankfulness to you, by this Dedication. Now although I hope I write this in the singleness of my heart, as believing that God will cut off all flattering lips, and that a lying tongue is but for a moment; yet I confess it fills me with serious thoughts, to con∣sider that this when I am dead, will be yet speaking: And that hereby I speak to you, as it were, in the hearing of the world; and that some whom we are bound in Christian wisdom and charity to judge as upright Saints, yet the heart-searching God may justly judge as Hypocrites; and that many who have made a greater profession of godliness then any of us, have proved fearful Apo∣states, when they have been tryed by Errors, Persecutions, or Pre∣ferments: I shall therefore, look∣ing

upon my self and you as just in our very fall into Eternity, and as presently going to Judgment, and with the greatest belief and thoughts that I can get of Hea∣ven and Hell upon my heart, se∣riously beseech you (according to the intent of this ensuing Trea∣tise) to examine your selves whe∣ther (if you were to die in the reading of this) you have a true Scripture-right to go to heaven; that so you may find the Witness of God by the word in your own consciences, agreeing with this publick testimony of your poor Minister: for it is but a poor thing for a man of so little credit, and less worth, to confess you before men; but this will be an honour indeed, to have Jesus Christ to confess you before his Father in Heaven, on the great day of the manifestation of the Sons of God. And continue to live as discerning the great difference betwixt a

godly and ungodly man, that you may still be known by this chara∣cter, to be persons in whose eyes a vile person (though never so great in the world) is contemned; but to honour them (though never so poor) that fear the Lord. This difference must needs be great, when I dare be bold to say, that it is beyond the tongues of men and Angels fully to express the excellency and glory of the one, and the vileness and misery of the other: And certainly the further insight you have in the Scriptures, in God and Christ, Men and De∣vils, Sin and Grace, Heaven and Hell, the more clearly you will know this difference. Do but look on the Godly, and Wicked, as they appear in sickness and death, and in the Day of Judg∣ment; these put an eternal period to all other distinctions: there will be then no such difference as Prince and Subject, Landlord and

Tenant, Rich and Poor, but one∣ly Godly and Ungodly; see the difference now, as it will appear, when, Come ye blessed, and Go ye cursed: and the right hand and left hand of Christ hath distin∣guished and parted the world.
Be resolved to cleave to Christ, his truth and people, through all the sufferings and stumbling-blocks which you meet with in your way to heaven: sufferings will be harder to you, then to many others: the greater your names and estates are, the greater must your graces be to enable you to part with them; you have a greater self to deny, and a greater cross to take up: great riches, and great preferments, make many great Persecutors, and great A∣postates, but few great Martyrs: you must buy the truth, whatever it cost you: and the more you give for it, the more you will gain by it: if you sell all for Christ,

you shall never complain of a dear purchase. Look with the dearest affections upon your Po∣sterity, and believe that you will never have such an opportunity to make them happy, and to en∣tail the blessings of God upon them, as when you are called to suffer for the sake of Christ: you may be called to make a great ex∣change; either to part with your lives and estates, and to keep Christ, and heaven; or to part with Christ, heaven, and your souls, to keep the world: if ever such a day come, look to the poor soul; above all keeping, keep your poor souls: remembring that of our Saviour, What shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Be pleased to accept this poor thing, which I humbly offer to you: give it a little room in your Study and Closet, and let the truths therein have a great place in your hearts. Now blessed of the Lord be you,

and your hopeful posterity, for the precious things of the earth, and the fulness thereof, and especially for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush.
NOw for the rest of you, my dearly beloved, my joy, and my longed for.
It is now thirteen years since upon your free choice and con∣sent, I was setled to be your Mi∣nister; I mourn that I have done you no better service; yet I bless God, that I have done you no worse: Some of you are the peo∣ple of my joy, others are the peo∣ple of my hopes, but (God knows) you are all the people of my love: possibly you may not enjoy my Ministry long; though if any thing but death part us, it is like for your sakes to be one of the saddest days of my age. Some know I might have had better places both

before, and since I knew you; but I never thought my self too good for you: the Lord make me better whilst I stay, and give you a better when I am gone. You will wonder to see me ap∣pear to you thus publick; my late visitation, whereby I was brought down to the gates of the grave, and brought up again, was the occasion of my preaching these Sermons; and the unanimous ad∣vice of four godly, reverend, and learned Ministers, all known to you, caused their printing, with∣out which my own private thoughts of them had never con∣sented to have them licensed for the Press. I have devoted this little plain Treatise to the Will of God, knowing that if he put power and savour in it, it will prosper: I expect to be scorned by some; but if God say, Well done, I care not who findes fault; I had rather bear the reproaches

of thousands, then that one poor oul should lose the least spiritu∣al and saving good, which I may be a means to help him unto. I leave it with you as a testimony of my sincere love to you, not so much that you may remember me, but that you may remember your selves, your sins, and your souls; and that you may remember God, Christ, Heaven, Hell, Death and Judgement, which are always present before you. Brethren, I must needs witness that most of you have been constant hearers of the Word, and that you have many hundred Sermons to answer for; but you must be doers, as well as hearers of the word: the sins of men, and the terrors of the Lord, make me afraid that there is a storm rising, and I doubt there will be a great fall of ma∣ny professors; and if you will be∣lieve our Saviour, you shall finde that those onely are built on a

rock, and shall certainly stand, who are both the hearers and doers of the word; I refer you to his own words, Matth. 7.24, 25, 26, 27.
I beseech you let not the world and sin come between your hearts and Christ; let nothing keep you from heaven, which cannot keep you from hell. Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the bloud of the everlasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
