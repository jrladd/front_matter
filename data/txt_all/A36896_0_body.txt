MADAM,
TO I know you take no great Pleasure in Addresses of this Nature, yet, by an happy Experience I can say it, Pardoning of Faults is not uneasie to you; especially those that can't be avoided: This is of that Nature: for what Man could forbear writing a Thousand Letters, after you had engag'd your self to answer 'em? And where could I think to find so Illustrious a Patron, to give 'em Credit and Esteem, in such an Age as this, so over-charg'd with Wit and Sense? What if the World's a Stranger to your Rank and Person? It knows in your Thoughts what sufficiently declares your strict Alliance to Vertue; and nothing can take your Title to support it, but must have some Pretensions to instru∣cting in the Laws of Vertue.
I confess you are a Lady of a particular Genius: for those that see you, know little of your Mind; and the World you communicate your Thoughts to, neither see nor know your Person: Nay, some believe you have no real Being but in my Brain. I am oblig'd to 'em for think∣ing me such a Man of Art, that can divide my Principles; for 'tis apparent those I act by, are very different from those I make use of to cor∣rect and reprove my Actions; Yet all this while (say these Men) the Title of Honourable Lady is but a Fiction I amuse the World with. I know your Ladyship is unconcern'd what is thought of it; I am not: but would be thought a Man of Truth; and, if I knew how, would fain convince 'em of their Mistake; but if only Seeing is Believing with 'em, I can never do it; that sort of Conviction I shall never have in my power; and if they will not believe upon the Credit of an Honest Man, I can go no farther.
Thus you see, Madam, how much I value Truth; what else cou'd make me decline the Glory of owning your Thoughts, which I have ever had in Admiration, since I had the Honour to know 'em. 'Twas in your Thoughts I discern'd the Charms of Solitude, which soon inspir'd me with the Resolution of Living Incognito, pro∣posing

to my self the most intimate pleasure this World can give; but now, by an unhappy Fate, must make it my Retreat, and both live and die so.
'Tis to you, Madam, I must be indebted for all the Pleasures I shall find in Retirement, and shall never be weary of presenting you with Uariety of Thoughts: Your Reflections will give 'em such Beau'ty and Lustre, none will be able to resist the Wie Instru∣ctions they carry in 'em, how mean so ever the thoughts are that gave 'em their first Rise
I shall only add, This Whole Correspondence will be contain∣ed in about 200 Parts (at 12 d. each) In which I solemnly declare, I'll have no Assistance (by Writing, whatever I have from Books) from any one of my former Authors; For seeing I have a Thousand Ma∣gots swarming in my Brain (for this Art of Incognito will consist just of that Number of Subjects) I'm willing now that the World may see the Magots of my own begetting: for, as Randolph says,—If I a Poem leave, that Poem is my Son—which I don't speak out of Ostentation, but that the World may see, after Print∣ing so many Magots of others writing, I'm now (by Imitation) become one my self. And as these Thousand Magots (or the Art of Living Incognito, for they are Synonimous Terms) will be publisht in 200 Parts, (and at so easy a Price, that the Poorest may purchase 'em): So Ten of 'em will be finisht by Lady-day, and the rest with what speed I can; which I hint as a Piece of ews to my Honest Printers, and my other Friends that I use to employ. But, Madam, tho in this Under∣taking I fall upon Subjects, that (by reason of their Uncommonness) may be thought Magotty, yet if I insert any thing not agreeable to Sound Doctrine, 'tis your Province to find it out; and tho your Good Nature is as ready to forgive Faults, as your Wit is able to find 'em, yet pray (Madam) tell me my Errors, Mistakes and Omissions, not with the Tongue of a Courtier, but with the Severity of a True Friend: And since the Art of Living Incognito is your own, by so many Titles to it, refuse it not the Honour of your Protection, but suf∣fer this Oblation from,
MADAM,
