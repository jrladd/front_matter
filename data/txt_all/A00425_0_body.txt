My honorable Lo.
AMongst the rare and curious Propositi∣ons which I have learned out of the studies of the Ma∣thematicks in the famous Vniver∣sitie of Pont a Mousson, I have ta∣ken

singular pleasure in certaine Problemes no lesse ingenious than recreative, which drew me unto the search of demonstrations more difficult and serious; some of which I have amassed and caused to passe the Presse, and here dedicate them now unto your Honour; not that I account them worthy of your view, but in part to testifie my af∣fectionate desire to serve you, and to satisfie the curious, who de∣light themselves in these pleasant studies, knowing well that the Nobillitie, and Gentrie rather stu∣die the Mathematicall Arts, to con∣tent and satisfie their affections, in the speculation of such ad∣mirable experiments as are ex∣tracted from them, than in hope of gaine to fill their Purses. All which studies, and others, with my

whole indevours, I shall alwayes dedicate unto your Honour, with an ardent desire to be accounted ever,
