SIR,
THe favourable aspect you were
pleas'd to cast, upon this Poem (the
first fruits of an Infant Muse) to∣gether
with the knowledge I have
of your excellent temper, and un∣alter'd
clemency, have sufficiently warranted my
presumption of throwing it at your feet, and by mak∣ing
it an humble present to a Person so far above
the common Sphere, secure it from the peircing
Tallons of Eagle Eyed Criticks: I know it is a
triffle that by the meaness of the stile, the want of
good design, and the ill representation at the The∣atre,
being Play'd to the worst advantage, has got
little credit with the World and consequently is

far unworthy your patronage, but if you consider
the credit of a young Author lyes at stake, one
whose design was onely to please not offend, you
doubtless will be induc'd to a more favourable opi∣nion
of my presumption. The censures of others
will the less trouble me when you protect it, know∣ing
how common 'tis now to discant on Authors
truely famous and worthy all applause, as well as
others of a far meaner knowledge and reputation
'Tis my desire, I confess, to be free from malicious
censures, and that my partial Reader would be so
favourable as not to be my Interpreter, but content
himself with the Perusal, according to Martial
(Absit a jocorum nostrorum simplicitate malig∣nus
interpres,) But since the humour of this Age
tends another way, I must study self satisfaction,
and relie on the Patronage of a Person whose
worth I am so well acquainted with, that the cri∣ticisms
of pretenders will appear as ridiculous as
they can endeavour to make this Poem, if they
durst write themselves.
SIR,
