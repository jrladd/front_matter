Most Noble Ladies.
THe incomprehensibly Great and Glo∣rious JEHOVAH, the Almighty Cre∣ator of Heaven and Earth, Who is, and was, and is to come, the First, and the Last, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the beginning of all without beginning, and the end to which all re∣er without end, who hath eternally his beeing
 only, and altogether, in and from himself, wih∣out Participation with, or Derivation from any, other, and from whom, as the first Fountain, and Original Beeing, the Sole-self-being, and Beeing of Beeings, all the Creatures Inanimat, Vegetative, Sensitive, and Rational, whether An∣gels or Men, are but derivated, and borrowed Bits of Beeing, in comparison with whom, they are but up-starts of yester-day, and (as it were) Time-nothings, hath (as it is highly rational, just, equal, and congruous he should) made all things for himself; and hath in a more special manner, formed, and new-made his own chosen and peculiar People for himself that they might shew forth his praise; and hath bought them with a price, and redeemed them, not with corruptible things, as silver and gold from their vain conversa∣tion, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a a Lamb without blemish, and without spot, slain from the foundation of the world; who are thre∣fore not their own, but infinitly oblidged to glo∣rify God both in their spirits and bodies which are Gods; none of whom beyond all living, ought to live to himself, nor die to himself, but living and dying ought to be the Lords; since the Lord Christ both died and rost, and revived, that he might in a peculiar manner, be Lord of them both living and dead; It becometh them from the constraining power of the love of Christ to judge thus, that they should not live to themselves, but unto him, who out of love died for them, and to endeavour through Grace to be in a capacity, each of them, for him, and her self, to say, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh,
 is by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved m, and gave himself for me; and, to me to live is Christ, The very End and Scope that I propose to my self, in desiring life with any of the con∣veniencies, accommodations and comforts there∣of, is the Honour and Glory of Jesus Christ: as of all persons in the world, it is most unworthy of them, and worst becoming them, to be inor∣dinat Self-lovers, Self-pleasures, or Self-seekers, so it i highly suitable for them (being singularly and signally oblidged thereto) to deny themselves and to take up their cross and follow him: and yet, notwithstanding all these mighty, matchless, and marvelous obligations, they, even they, alas! are frequently, and not altogether without suc∣cess, insinuated upon, by deceitful corrupt Self, that immixeth with their best, and most Spiritu∣all Duties, and in part spoileth them; they are the more called and concerned, watchfully to guard against it, that it doh, as a thin, subtile, spiritual humour very secretly, and insensibly diffuse it self thorow the whole Mass and Body of the Duties of Religion, and by it's venemous quality, in less, or more, tinctures, and vitiats them all; The most soveraign antidot against which poison, and the most powerfull extracter, and suckr out of it, is sincere Love to Jesus Christ, flowing from the Lively Faith of his Love.
Your Noble Ladyships, as his genuine and kindly Disciples, have been a considerable time trained up in his School, and been by him, the great Teacher, taken much pains upon (I hope with good success) that ye might be made to learn well, to take out, and be Spiritually Per∣queer in that first great high and difficult Lesson
 of Christian Religion, Self-denyal (which, as i is an absolutely necessary, and indispensably re∣quisite to the whole of it, so it is universally in∣fluential on the same, and more particularly, on patient, pleasant and cheerful taking up, and bearing Christs Cross after him;) as otherwise, so by the late great breaches that the Holy Lord hath thought good to make, and that within a very short space of time, upon several of your Noble near and dear Relations; thereby at once, laying very heavy loads of Crosses and Afflictions upon you, and graciously instructing you, with a strong hand to deny your selves, that ye may christianly bear them, and be made observable proficients by them; taking his own infinit and all-sufficient self, to fill the empty rooms of these deceast dear Relations, which all the world can∣not do (which is your great and highly valuable mercy, whatever strangers to him may think to the contrary) yet he that hath filled Heaven and Earth can easily do it, O! blessed design; let him, with your most cordial allowance, and at your most earnest desires drive it vigorously, and suc∣cessfully about you; that when others of his People shall hear and see your ways and doings, they may be comforted, and made to say, verily God hath not done in vain, nor without precious and bles∣sed Fruit, all that he hath done, to yonder Noble Ladies: which very excellent and singularly use∣full Grace of Self denyall is notably cleared and commended in these few following Sermons; as the contrary corruption of slie and subtile Self is by diligent search found out, and chased from it's many lurking-places, and starting holes, and the uc and cry raised after it, as a common and no∣torious
 Thief, that is alwayes secretly and sacri∣igiously filshing, pilfering, purloining and steal∣ing somewhat from us, that is Gods due in all hat we do; which therefore on the cry we would earnestly and closly pursue, as one of his greatest Enemies, which saucily and malapertly presums to rival it with him, and lifteth it self up to sit on his Throne, and to bring him down to stand at it's Foot-stool, the very Image (as it were) of jealousy provocking to jealousy, making us so far as it prevails, to be gross Idolaters, and also one of our own greatest Enemies, whatever be it's plausible pretence of friendship to us, and in whatever handsome-like dress and shape (for it can, in a manner, nimbly turn it self into all shapes) it officiously offereth to commend it self to us; it (as it were) eats much of the fat, and drinks much of the sweet of our Sacrifices of praises, prayers, and of all our other Duties; it pitifully impoverisheth us, when we might be rich, and seem to be so, and maketh us, when we appear to be very fruitful, to be almost ut∣terly empty vines, because, by it's means, a great part of our fruit is brought forth to our selves. Now heartily desiring that these few very searching, but very sweetly savouring Sermons of the singu∣larly Self-denyed long since deceased Author, may come along to all the Readers of them, and to your Ladyships in particular, with a full blessing; and hopeing that you will not offend at my ad∣venturing to shreud them under the umbrage of your noble Names, I am.
