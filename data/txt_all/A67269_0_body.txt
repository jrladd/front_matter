My LORD,
WHen I lately had the Ho∣nour and Happiness of wait∣ing upon Your Lordship, You were pleas'd to Encourage the Publica∣tion
of this Discourse, in such Obli∣ging Terms, as I cannot here, in Mo∣desty, relate. Your Lordship's Repeated Requests, which to me are Equivalent to Commands, and Your Generous Prof∣fer of giving these Papers Protection, being such Powerfull Arguments to me, as I could not in Duty withstand, have usher'd them into the Publick Light. This is a sufficient Apology to excuse me from Arrogance and Presumption, if there had been no other Reason for my appearing in Print: But whilst I was in the Country, I was not only surpriz'd with a Letter sent me by an Ʋnknown Hand, misrepresenting my Sermon; but soon after I came to the College, I was Allarm'd with the Noise which some Men had made about it, and not a little Concern'd at the Invidious misconstructions which they had put upon it. And therefore
as well in my own Vindication, as in Obe∣dience to Your Lordship's Command, I sub∣mit it to a more Publick Censure than it has already undergone. All Men, who are Just and Impartial, have so High a Value for Your Lordship's Judgement, and so Great an Opinion of Your Candour and Integrity, that seeing Your Lordship has been pleas'd to cast a Favourable Aspect upon this Discourse, it raises some hopes in me, that how contemptible soever it may seem in the Eyes of some Persons; yet it may meet with a Candid Reception a∣mongst others, of Your Lordship's Chara∣cter, who are Hearty Lovers of the Church of England, of their Majesties, and this Nation. As for those who are not, as I neither expect their Favour, so neither do I much regard their Displea∣sure. If any are offended with my Sermon, it is their own fault and not mine. I am
perswaded no Honest Man will Vindicate the Characters of those whom I undertake to expose. As I have said nothing but what I really believe to be true, so I hope my Sincerity may Atone for the meanness of my Performance; and Your Lordship's Kind Acceptance of it, will, in my Esteem, overballance the Sleights and Reproaches of those who vilifie and condemn it. May your Lordship live many Happy Years, to Adorn the Station You deservedly Possess, to do Justice, and Promote the Publick Good; and, after You have long been a Blessing to this Kingdom, may You be re∣ceiv'd into that of Eternal Glory, which is the Ʋnfeigned Prayer of
My LORD,
