THE inequalitie of retribution turnes to a pitty, when there is not ability sufficient for acknowledge∣ment. Your equall respects may yet admit the readinesse of Ende∣vour, though the very hazard in it, betray my Defect. I have enjoyed freely ac∣quaintance, with the sweetnesse of your dis∣positions; and can justly account, from the Noblenesse of them, an evident distinction be∣twixt Friendship and Friends. The latter (ac∣cording to the practice of complement) are usu∣ally met with; and often without Search: The other, many have searcht for, I have found. For which, though I partake a benefite of the for∣tune;

yet to you (most equall Paire) must remain the Honour of that Bounty. In presenting this Issue of some lesse serious houres to your tuition, I appeale from the severitic of censure, to the mercy of your Iudgements: and shall rate It at a higher value, than when It was mine own, if you onely allow It the favour of Adoption. Thus, as your happines in the fruition of each others love, proceeds to a constancie: so the truth of mine, shal appeare lesse un-shaken, as you shall please to con∣tinue in your good opinions.
