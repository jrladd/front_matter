COnsidering your Lordships
zeale to the truth, due respect
of the Gospell, and vnfained
loue to the professors; I pre∣sumed
to publish this small
worke vnder your Lordships
protection: partly bicause it was begotten in that
country; partly bicause the country beareth but
little fruit of the scripture: but principally and
especially, to gratifie your Lordship for many
fauours. The subiect is easie, yet not learned;
often red, seldom marked; obserued of many,
yet vnderstood of few. But seeing the leuell of
all controuersie is to hit the truth, whose cham∣pions
ye all are; and by you all arguments must
die or liue: I appeale vnto your L. for my iust de∣fence,
or your Lordships better aduise. The spirit
of grace illuminate your L. vnderstanding. Lon∣don.
March, Anno 1597.
