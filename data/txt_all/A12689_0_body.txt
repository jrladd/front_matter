THis Spanish Originall com∣ming to my hands most op∣portunely, tooke the aduan∣tage of my liking it, and sud∣den apprehension, that it would please the Reader, whosoeuer: not so much because thereby is proposed a kinde of variety of Newes, as in that the glory of God is made apparant in his workes, and wonder∣full prouidence, that can preserue men out of raging seas, and afford his mercy when wee thinke that it is quite denied vs: And although I may incurre an imputation by leaning more to the true sense, then to the words, as they lye in order: yet I will be bold to say, that the sentences here extended, shall neither receiue exoticke interpretation, nor bee carryed with any wanton hand from the true meaning:

Be therefore thus fauourable I pray, to reade it without a strict comparison of the origi∣nall. and accept of an honest intent, that ay∣meth as much at the satisfaction of worthy deseruers, as any profit can arise out of so meane a worke.
