Right Honorable:
PResuming on your fauours, I am emboldned to present you with the firstlings of my en∣deuours, who may best cha∣lenge them, beeing the first who gaue life and breath in your incouragements to these my intendements. For neuer had I en∣gaged my selfe so farre in these more pub∣lique imployments, but had contented my selfe in an obscure retire on my rurall Charge; but that the experiments of your fauour did for a while dictate another course vnto me: which since good consi∣derations
haue altered; it being aswell your religious desire, as my care, to feede mine owne flocke at home, though but a very little one, beeing in a place altogether dis∣peopled, rather then to intend anothers Charge abroad: I had sometime thought the desolatenes of the place had been suffi∣cient priuiledge for absence: but I finde it otherwise: many being ready to find fault, as Eliab did with Dauid for leauing,1. Sam. 17.28. though but a few Sheepe in the Wildernesse. And therefore, to giue offence to none, I will seeke no farther excuses for my absence, but returne vnto mine owne: and sith my absence can no longer suffer mee to per∣forme that seruice to your Honors which I could wish: I shall leaue this small Present with you, as a pledge of that duty & seruice which I owe: making vp in my dayly prayers to God for your Honors, what shal bee wanting in the performances of my seruice to you: desiring the God of Heauen to blesse your Honors with the blessings of this life, and blessednes of a better.
