MADAM,
IF I thought this but an ordinarie Romance, I would not presume to bring it under your Honour's Protection. 'Twas Dedicated by the Author to the Dutchess of Longueville and to others of the greatest Nobility of France: I have chosen to inscribe it only to your Lady∣ship, because You comprehend all those excellencies which are shed and scatter'd in other single Persons. But I humbly beg pardon for presenting a Translation to You who so perfectly command the Original. Were it a Discourse of the most profound Learning that Humane Nature is capable of, and written in Greek or He∣brew, I would make its Dedication to your Noble Lord, who is ac∣knowledg'd (by those that have the honour to know him) so to have Master'd all the Learned Sciences and Languages, that it is no easie task to find His Equal, not only among those of His own noble Order, but among them whose Profession hath oblig'd them to be Scholars: Though all His Learning (accompanied with the highest Fortitude of Body and Mind) dwels in such eminent Candor and Meekness, as is only pa∣rallel'd by the like in your Ladiship. For if those rare Vertues which adorn your excellent Soul can admit of Degrees, 'tis because your Modesty is Transcendent over the rest. I confess (Madam) since I had Relation to this Book, I desir'd to be as kind to it as I could, and I knew no better way to promote its good, than by entit'ling your Ladiship to it. What more particularly concerns this Edition, I shall tell to the Reader. Here I shall only say, that those who have read it conceive it written with so much Wit and noble Passion, that the Wisest Ʋnderstanding, that is your Ladiships, may be seen to per∣use it, which was a great Motive why now it is presented, by
MADAM,
