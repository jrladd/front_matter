SIR,
YOƲ may well be surpri∣zed at this unexpected Dedication from one that may seem an utter Stranger to your Person; but the fame of your singular knowledge in the choicest parts of Philosophy, and all other worthy accomplishments, will make this presumption of me, the Publisher of these two Treatises, as pardonable by your self, so, I hope, justifiable to all the World. Not to say that it is a peice of in∣dispensable

justice that one of them be Dedicated to you; the Author thereof being that Excellent Per∣son the Reverend Dr. Rust, late Bishop of Dromore in Ireland, once fellow of Christs Colledge in Cambridge, to which you lately have been so Noble a Benefactor. Wherefore in hopes that you will be pleased to take the Dedication of this whole Book, the two Trea∣tises, and the Annotations there∣on in good part, craving pardon for this boldness I humbly take leave, and am,
Honoured Sir,
