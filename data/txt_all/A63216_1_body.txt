My Lord,
THere are a sort of Persons that make Flattery their Trade, and the Subjects they work upon, are such as are self-Affected, whose Ears are still open to hear their own Praise: It is confest, where Disert In∣habits, Commendation is re∣quisite; so it put on a modest Attire, and not shape it self with the vanity of Hyperbolizing:

And as your Lordship is a known Enemy to such Aereall Nothings; So have I strove ra∣ther to follow the narrow Tract of Truth, than the common Road of Adulation. All I have aymed at in this Epitome, is to set forth the ample Love and Affection your Company bears you; And if in the Progress thereof, I have hinted any way upon your Honours Goodness, as it hath been, and is a general received Truth; So I shall not blush or be a shamed to own it, and my self in all humbleness, my Lord,
