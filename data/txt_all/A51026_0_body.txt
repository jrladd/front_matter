IT was an ingenious Conceit of the Painter, how likely soever he was by some Master-piece of his Art to render himself Famous to Posse∣rity, yet to indent his own Image in Minerva's picture;
knowing the Veneration universally payed the God∣dess, might conduce to the preservation of his Me∣mory. I have in some degree transcribed this Pra∣ctice, when I prefix the Names of so many Worthy Men to this Treatise, and though I could not consult better for my own Reputation, or the General Ac∣ceptance of the Discourse, then by Dedicating it to so Illustrious a Society; Yet I dare truely Aver the true Esteem I have of the Royal Burroughs, and A∣ectionat Concern for their Interest, has induced me to lay hold on this Opportunity, to testifie the same to the World.
And what Honest Country Man that wishes well to the Honour and Felicity of the Nation, can be o∣therwise inclined towards so deserving and considerable a part of it: With whose Fortune the Rest of the Kingdom most either stand or fall; For what ever of Riches or Reputation the Nation can have, must be Attributed to the Care and Diligence of the Royal Bur∣roughs.
The Towns you Represent, are not only the Seats of Trade and Commerce, but likewise, some of them are the Fountains of Breeding, the Seminaries of Learning to the Young Nobilitie and Gentrie,
the Springs of good Manners and Laudable Customs to the adjacent Parts: Nay the meanest of them are Repaired to, less or more by the Neighbouring places, for Training up their Children: So that it is to the good Order and Discipline which a Vigilant Magistracie causes be observed in them; We owe that our Youth are polished in any part of Civil Education, Refined from the Dreggs of a Rural life, and preserved from Wickedness and Immortality.
The Royal Burroughs are these Planets which by their Light and Influence dispose the other parts of the Nation to a happy eultivation. They are those Fountains which convey Water to Fertilize all about them, And I am sure the Husbandmans la∣bour would fail, and the Landlords Revenue too, if the purses of Citizens were not a spurr to the One, and a Seasonable Supply many a time to the Other. I may safely allude to that Apologue of Menenlus A∣grippa, and say that the Royal Burroughs are the stomach of the Nation, which digest & distribute what∣ever of Wealth or necessary commodity is by the care
and Industry of Traffiquers imported to it, for the common benefit of the Kingdom, without whose Care and Prudent Mannagry, the other parts of the Body politick, the Head and Arms, the Ribbs, and Legs, that is the Soveraigne and Nobles, the Gen∣trie and Commons, would Famish, and become unfit for Action or Motion.
Is it not to the Royal Burroughs we owe the im∣provement of Arts, the Advancement of Trade, the Encrease of Wealth, the Education of Youth, the Encouragement of Industry? And whatsoever else can conduce to the Prosperity and Plenty of the Nation. Hence it comes These deserve the Name of Patriots best, who Be-friend the Interest of the Royal Burroughs most. Nor can there be any Ene∣mies to them, but such as are unnatural sworn Ad∣versaries to their Country, and envy its Flourishing in Happiness and Renown.
I doubt not but you consider and lay to heart, that not only the Civil and Politick, but likewise the Moral and Spiritual concerns of the Kingdom, are a great part of your Province. The Providence of
GOD which has raised you to move in a higher Orb in the Burroughs you reside in, and you now repre∣sent in this Honourable Convention, Oblieges you by your Creditable Stations to be Patrons of Piety and Virtue, as well as of Industry and Trade: Your Ex∣ample in the Honourable Sphere you now move in, is no less instrumental to promote the One than the O∣ther. Certainly the circumspect Religious Deportment of Magistrats in their several precincts, would conduce ex∣treamly to beget a love to Piety in those under their Charge, and would contribute to work a great Reforma∣tion in the adjacent parts of the Country, from which there is such frequent Repair to Towns, and often converse with Citizens: By which those who resort to them would be insensibly wrought on to imitate their Practise, and Transcribe their Virtues: There is a greater force in Religious Society & good Example to beget a Conformity in us than is well adverted to, the sweet friendly converse of a City acquaintance may charm an honest Country man into a liking of that godliness, he sees him imbrace, & Thrive so well with in following his Worldly Calling, And with his Civility and Dis∣cretion, with his kind Expressions, and Oblieging Discourse, he may instile into his Soul a love to these Virtues, of Goodness and Ingenuity, of Candor and Honestie, of Fidelitie and Justice he sees him make
Conscience of in his Commerce: And how happy were it if the Towns in this manner would become instructers of the Neighbouring parts in matters of Religion, as well as in those of Breeding, Givility & Trade.
Would GOD, Magistrates were more Intent and Serious in the Work of Religion, then their own Pri∣vate and the Publick Affairs of the Communities they are severally concerned in, would prosper the better under their Conduct;
1 Tim. 4.8. For, Godliness has the promise of this life, and of that which is to come; Let me beseech you labour to feel the power of Religion in your hearts, to maintain it by a close walking with GOD in your Families, by Integrity in your several Trusts, and an Examplary, Behaviour towards, the. Encouraging of others to espouse it; And so ye will engage Heaven to bless you in your Private and Publick Capacities, and crown your honest endeavours with Success and Prosperity, for GODS Glory, the Honour of the Na∣tion, the Advantage of the Royal Burroughs, and your own Comfort; For which, none Prayes more Cordlally than
