NOt vtterly ignorant,
(most gratious Lady)
of your many and sun∣drie
vertues, whiche
sufficientlye are made
open and manifest to the louers of
Gods sincere & Catholique Gospel,
as otherwise ardent and zealous
desier, that your noble hearte doth
possesse: in wishyng the conuersion
of those that are enemies not onely
to Gods veritie, but also to the fa∣uourers
of the same, which who so
euer he e that shall enter (in these
poyntes) into deepe & earnest con∣syderation
of minde with him selfe,

shal not only be moued to be thank¦full
therefore to God the giuer of al
good thinges, but also be prouoked
and stirred day by day to pray, that
God, as he by his vnspekeable pro∣uidence,
hath framed so good a gift
in your (most gratious breast) and
to illumine your eyes with his de∣uine
knowledge, wherby your per∣son
is, and can be able thereby to
discerne falshood from truth, light
from darkensse, pure religion from
vnwritten verities, and Gods E∣uangely
from mens tradicions: so
he may increase and multiplie the
same in so noble a heart, that you
may perseuer and go forward ther∣in
to ye glory of God, the aduaunce∣ment
of his worde, and the comfort
and consolation both of your gra∣tious
body and minde: that when
Christ shall come to iudge, you may
participate as felow Heire with
him, that eternall and Heauenly

kyngedome, purchased with his
deare heart bloud: where he hath
layde vp in store, for all that faith∣fully,
and earnestly beleeue on his
most holy name, immortall and i∣corruptible Crownes of euerlasting
life, the whiche are allotted to his
beloued and adopted sonnes, in his
bloud. Knowyng therefore (O ver∣tuous
Lady) your Estate, to be
suche, as scarsly I might for want
of knowledge, once be worthie to
name, so greate is the weakenesse
and imbicillitie of my witte: muche
lesse then, to wright vnto so noble
a Lady as your grace is. Yet inco∣raged
by hope, I am imboldened
to pitche mine Anker, amidst the
Flouds of your vertues, & to builde
my trauell on ye foundation of your
knowledge, beyng perswaded, that
hauinge so worthie a Matrone as
you are, to be a sheilde to this my
weake and vnskilfull labour: it shal

not onely be a sheild sufficient ther∣to,
but cause it also to be the better
regarded and esteemed. In con∣syderation
wherof, I most humbly
beseche your Grace to accept & take
the same in good parte, and hereaf∣ter
as God shal increase in me grea∣ter
knowledge, I shall with mat∣ters
of greater waight and impor∣taunce,
trouble your most gratious
person, as knoweth God, who
graunte you longe lyfe, prosperitie
and peace, with the comforte and
great ioy of your worthy children,
to his good pleasure now & euer.
