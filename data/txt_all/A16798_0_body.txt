TO whom shall I dedicate the
praise of Vertue, but to him whō
Vertue praiseth, which in your
Maiestie being made good, to the eies
of those vnderstanding spirits, that can
iudge of the heauenly notes of heroi∣call
natures (I hope) hauing Truth for
my warrant, to escape the scandall of
fawning Eloquence: vouchsafe there∣fore
my gratious Soueraigne, in this
plaine Poem, to peruse the labour of
my hearts loue, which with the seruice
of true loyaltie, I humbly lay at the feet
of your Royall Maiestie, beseeching
the vertue of all grace, & grace of all
vertue, so to blesse you with his infi∣nite

blessings, that as vertue vnder hea∣uē
putteth her praise vnder your Patro∣nage,
so the Patrone of all vertue will
so Royallize your praise in the Hea∣uens,
that to your gratious Crowne on
earth, you may receiue a Crowne of
Eternall glory.
