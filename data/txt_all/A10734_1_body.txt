Worthy Ladies:
AS God hath v∣nited you all in the bondes of nature and al∣liance; so I am bolde to ioyne you all toge∣ther in the de∣dication of this Sermon. I confesse, in it selfe, it is not worthy the acceptance of any one of you. But seeing it hath pleased God, to make you all instruments of much good and comfort vnto mee, and I know not whe∣ther

I shall euer haue opportunity, to pub∣lish seuerall things in euery one of your names in particular: I haue thought good, to take this occasion, to manifest my thankefull acknowledgement of the kindenesse of you all in generall: which hath beene extended, not to me onely, but to many others of my calling. For I may truly giue this testimony of you, that you haue all shewed great loue to the faith∣full Ministers of God, and when any of them haue resorted vnto you, you haue according to the Apostles precept,Phil 2.29. recei∣ued them with all gladnesse, and made much of them. The matter of this Ser∣mon is concerning affliction, whereof you haue all had your portion more or lesse: and therefore, the Doctrine con∣tained in it, doth fitly appertaine to you all. But especially to you my good Ladie Scot, whom the Lord hath caused to drinke deeper of this cuppe then many o∣thers. But as it hath pleased God, hither∣to to support you with grace and patience: so I doubt not, but hee will, in his good time, make a blessed end with you, as hee did with Iob,Iames 5.11. Psal. 90.15. making you glad againe

according to the yeares wherein you haue seene euill. If these meditatations of mine may minister any comfort vnto you, or to any other in the like case, I shal thinke my labour well bestowed. And thus presuming that you will kindely ac∣cept of this my poore seruice, which in my sincerest affection I tender vnto you, I commend all your Ladiships to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you further, and to giue you an inheritance among them that are sanctified.
