My LORD,
THis little Book is brought forth in due Season, to Congratulate your In∣auguration into an Office of that Trust and Honour, that admits no Citizen in Europe to be your Equal: The Subject of it is such, as not only becomes the greatest Prince, as well as meanest Peasant to Study, but it is absolutely Necessary they should; for none of their Affairs are of so great a Concern, as the Pardon of their Sin, and the Salvati∣on of their Souls. Yet I am so distrustful of my Manage∣ment
 of so great a Subject, that neither this, nor the Honour of your Acquaintance, nor the Knowledge of your Impartial Judgment, or Condescending Temper, had prevailed with me to prefix your Name to it, tho' I often did deliberate upon it; but its Edition so imme∣diately following your Election, and its Publication being within the Verge, and under the first Dawnings of your Authority, it could not be Civil without Saluting you, and Craving your Patronage; and it gives me the Opportunity to tell You, that I, and I believe thousands more, who have no Vote of Election, do enjoy our Wish∣es, and are put in great hopes of a Reformed City.
I bope you will be as far from Patronizing Error as Protecting Vice, but there is nothing in this little Piece (to my Knowledge) contrary to the Confessions of our common Protestant Faith. Indeed there is a Notion about Faith, that I may call New, in it, viz. That as the Author of our Faith, is the Author of our Justi∣fication, Christ Jesus, and the Object of our Faith the Merit of our Justification, Christs Righteousness; and the Exercise of our Faith upon this Merit, as the great Mean through which Divine Love, Grace and Mercy is conveyed to us, is the Condition of our Justification; so the Gift of Faith is the Sentence of our Justification, or Sign of it; for if the Spirit be an Earnest of Hea∣ven, much more is it of Pardon: It's true, by this
 the Gift is before the Condition, which all grant; but the Sign or Signification of the Gift, which is the Sen∣tence, is at least in order of Nature after the Condi∣tion; for we not only do not perceive, but we cannot perceive this Gift; and consequently it cannot signifie divine Favour to us, untill mixt with our spirit; for our Observation is from our Experience. This being new, I have proposed it to be tried before trusted; a Conditionality of the Covenant is a principal Pillar of Popery, Socinianism, and Arminianism, according to their several modes of Explication; and therefore the very sound of the Word fills the Heart of sincere Protestants with Jealousie: But if we allow Faith and Repentance, those absolute Gifts, and Effects of special Grace, to be Signs of special Grace and Favour, or Par∣don, (for a Man cannot be in a state of Grace without Pardon) there is room for Duty, and Conditional Duty, without any Jealousie of these Errors.
I pray the Lord may Confirm your Election with such an Unction that may signifie his own Approbation of you, Mercy to us by You, and that may fit you fully for the place. It is a Place that never wanted Diffi∣culties, nor are they like to decrease in your Day; the greater they grow, the more Need you have of the Fa∣vour and Fruition of Him, who is of God made unto us Wisdom as well as Righteousness, and a Coun∣cellour as well as a Saviour; his providential Conduct
 in immediate directing of the Judgment, and Inclining of the Will of his Favourites, when plunged in difficult Affairs, or surrounded with dangerous Circumstances, fully supplies the want of Urim and Thummim.
No doubt the Hopes of so many People being termi∣nated on You, and so great things being expected from You, renders you concerned; but both of them may as truly encourage you: For what do we expect, but that you be of a Publick Spirit, that your Aims and Ends be as publick as your Place and Office, for the Com∣mon Wealth, or the common Good of the City? It's but of late that People have enjoyed this Security, that their most Supream Magistrates are in no private Plott against their common Good; but tho we are now secure as to the Throne, we are not as to all Places of Trust under it.
What do we expect, but the Impartial Administra∣tion of Justice, to great or small, high or low, rich or poor, friend or foe? However unjust Mens Actions are, their Consciences will cry, It is just, it is just, when they suffer most severe Punishment for their Crimes: Honesty is the best Policy, and needs least the Volumes of Politick Axioms; an up∣right, single-hearted Man, with a general Notion of the Laws and Customs of the Land, will do more Service with a few obvious Rules, that almost every man knows, than a Cunning Man can with all his
 Skill, when he makes use of it for upholding him out of the Road of Equity and Righteousness.
What do we expect, but that the Prophanity of this City should now meet with an Hearty Enemy in the Chair? and you have a Notable Opportunity for shew∣ing your self so, Wickedness being grown to that height, that it is an Injury, yea, a Ruine to many Families, who could wink at it while it remained only under the Form of a Sin or an Offence. He that will become a Check and a Terror to it now, will receive the Praise, and enjoy the Hearts of all Parties, who would not have their Posterity rot in Bawdy-houses, or made pub∣lick Examples of Justice at Tyburn, or their Estates purchased by labour and industry, or preserved by pains, parcimony and prudence, drank away in Taverns, or thrown away at a Game. You will become the City's great Benefactor, in delivering it from such a Ruine, You will receive an Honour far above the Honour of your Office, if it may be recorded, that Profanity, which has so long increas'd, did decay, and receive its Deaths-wound under the Maioralty of Sir William Ashurst. A zealous acting against Vice and Profani∣ty, will not only be for your Honour, and the City's good, but it will be an acting for God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; the nigher you are brought to him, the more you ought to be like him; the more he Honours you, the more you ought to Honour him:
 He has generally given to you the Hearts of the City, will you suffer that Kindness to be in vain? He hath promi∣sed both Strength and Reward for his Work; trust him, he is surely faithfull; but never trust his Enemies; you may gain your own personal Foes by Favours, but never think to make God's Foes your Friends, if you intend to act for God; you may sooner lose ten Friends than gain one of them; all your Favours will only make them Ridicule you, if not put them in a Capacity to Injure you.
Not only may the things expected, but the Expecta∣tion it self, encourage you in the Administration of your Office; for they who truly hope for such things at your hand, will be constant Supplicants at the Throne of Grace, for Piety, Prudence, Patience, Candor and Cou∣rage, for you. That you may not only have a Power Faithfully to discharge your Trust, but with Ease, Pleasure and Success, you may perform every Duty of the Station, and at last descend from the Chair with an Honour greater than the Hope and Joy of your Friends at your Ascension to it, in this Catalogue he counts it his Honour to be, who is
