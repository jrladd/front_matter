ALthough the monstrous shapes
of Bookes (Right Honoura∣ble
and best ennobled Lord)
haue with their disguised and
vnprofitable vizard-like fa∣ces
halfe scared, euen vertue
her selfe from that ancient defence and patro∣nage,
which (in former ages) most Nobly she im∣ployed;
to preserue them from Enuy, yet so much
I know the largenesse of your worthy breast is en∣dewed
with wisedome, courage and bountie, that
notwithstanding the vanities of our ignorant
Writers, you will be pleased out of your Noble

Spirit, fauourably to behold whatsoeuer shall bring
a publique good to your Country; at which end
I haue onely aymed in this small Booke. In which,
hauing runne farre from the way or tract of
other Writers in this nature, yet I doubt not but
your Honour shall finde my path both more easie,
more certaine, and more safe then any; nay by
much farre lesse difficult or dangerous to walke
in. I must confesse, something in this nature I haue
formerly published, as namely of the Horse onely;
with whose nature and vse I haue beene exercised
and acquainted from my Childe-hood and I hope
without boast neede not yeelde to many in this
Kingdome. Yet in this worke, I hope, your Lord∣ship,
and all other Princely maintainers of that
worthy and seruiceable beast, shall finde I haue
found out and herein explained a nearer and more
easie course for his preseruation and health, then
hath hitherto beene found, or practised by any, but
my selfe onely. Whatsoeuer it is, in all humblenesse,
I offer it as a sacrifice of my loue and seruice to your
Honour, and will euer whilst I haue breath to be,
