Sirs,
MY hope that some Impressi∣on may possibly remain upon your hearts and spi∣rits, of, and from the things delivered unto you in the ensuing Sermon, make me willing unto the obedience of presenting it unto you, upon your command in this manner. Were I not perswa∣ded, that your peace, interest and concernment is expressed therein, and knew not with what simplicity of heart you were minded thereof, I should have chosen on many accounts to have waved this duty. But having now perform∣ed what is incumbent on me, to render this service useful, recommending it yet further to

the Grace of God, I humbly beg that it may not in this return unto you, be looked on as a thing of course and so laid aside, but be re∣viewed with that intension of spirit which is necessary in duties of this importance; where∣by you may manifest that your command unto this service, was grounded on a sense of some advantage to be made by that performance of it. Sundry things I confess that were spoken unto you, are gone beyond my recovery, having had their rise from the present assistance which God was pleased to afford in the management of the worke it self. The sum of what was provided before hand and no otherwise, without the least addition, is here presented unto you, with hearty desires, that the vision of the truth herein considered may be to them that love you, and the accomplishment thereof be found in the middest of you. So prayes

Novemb 17.
