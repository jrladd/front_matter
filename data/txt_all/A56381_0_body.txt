SIR,
I Have now satisfied and perhaps
surpriz'd you too; for I que∣stion
not but these Papers
will more prevent then answer
your expectations: For when
you remitted me to my own lea∣sure
to satisfie your demands
(the true import of a Friends desires) I am confident you
believed I would as well use as acknowledge your Fa∣vour;
and I really thought my next to you should have
been a Letter of thanks for your forbearance, and not a
final discharge of my Obligations. But being shortly to
bid adieu to my Retirements here, and fearing I shall no
where else enjoy so much Privacie and Leasure; I could
not satisfie my self till I had gratified your expectations,
and put my selfe past all hazard of disobeying your
Commands. For methinks (Sir) nothing concerns me

so much as those designes that aspire to serve my
dearest—But my Business is not to complement, and
I foresee how exceedingly I shall be straightned in time,
and therefore I must without the Ceremony of any farther
Preface immediately apply my self to the serious dis∣charge
of my Taske, which I shall (following the me∣thod
your injunctions have prescribed me) perform in
three parts (1.) By giving you an account of the true
Nature and Extent of Gods Dominion. (2.) By laying
down a right Notion of his Goodness. (3.) By proving
the Groundlesness and Vanity of the Origenian Hy∣pothesis
concerning the Preexistence of Souls. Of each
in their order.
