ONce more hath good will emboldened me
to present unto your Worships my
worthless labour, to manifest the good
affection I bear to this Fraternity:, and
finding you lent a gentle look on the first
part of this History, I have been the more bold to prof∣fer
you the second; For having bound my self by pro∣mise
to perform it; and you perhaps claiming promise
as a debt, expecting payment, I bent all my study to keep
touch; whereupon I tender this small trifle unto you,
only craving at your Worships hands, a good opinion of
my poore endeavours. And albeit this Phamphlet
doth not minister matter worthy your grave view: yet
in regard of the subject, I trust you will deigne to esteem
it sith so well as I could, though not so well as I would,
I have sought herein to procure you delight: and al∣though
you find not all the men spoken of, which is pro∣mised
in the first part, yet think it no faintnesse in me,
but fault in good instruction: and againe, for as much
as these men here mentioned, were all of this City,
(whose story grew longer then I supposed) and the o∣ther
of the Country: I thought good so to break off, and
to defer their story to another time, when I may more
perfectly speak thereof. In the mean space I commend
your Worships to the protection of the most Highest.
