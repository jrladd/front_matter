May it please Your Honours,
I Humbly make Bold to lay before Your Ho∣nours the Occasion of Presenting these Pa∣pers: It is not unknown how Sollicitous the Quakers have been from time to time under every Revolution and Change of Govern∣ment, from 1652. to this present Day; but of late they have advanced to a degree higher, not only to Present their Books and Papers in Session-time, but in the Intervals of Par∣liament they have been so Bold, as to send them to the very Houses of Members of Par∣liament; upon which I thought it highly ne∣cessary
to make some Observations on their Way and Method of writing, as in my Mo∣dest Defence, &c. Presented this Session to Your Honours, and with all dutiful Submissi∣on, leaving the Matter to Your Mature De∣liberation and Consideration.
But having understood since that, that the Quakers have privately Presented divers Books under the Sham Titles of Answers, not only to that, but to other Books, I still thought it my Duty to write some farther Observations thereupon, which being read and compared with theirs, together with my Book, The Pilgrim's Progress, &c. Second Edition, now Published, and to which the se∣veral and often repeated Pages herein men∣tioned do relate, (these Papers being part of the Preface thereto belonging) it will make some farther Discovery of their Mock An∣swers, both to the said Pilgrim's Progress, &c. and Modest Defence, &c. and being loth to have the Porch exceed the House, I Humbly beg leave to submit what I have said herein, to the Consideration of Your Great Wisdom, and conclude with all dutiful Submission,
