Madam,
YOƲR natural Inclinations, your Ingenuity, and your Virtuous Education, have such an affinity with that which render'd this Heroine so ac∣complish'd, as she is here represented, that I thought I should wrong her Memory, and your Merits, in not de∣dicating to You this Story of her A∣mours, as to the fittest Person, to vindicate and defend from the envi∣ous

Censure of Malice, that Manage∣ment which she us'd in so nice a Cause, in which meer Chance and her own Misfortune had involv'd her. She, like You, had an entire dependency on her Mother's grave Counsels and Ad∣vices, such a Mother, as like yours, was endowed with all the Prudence and Discretion, that was requisite to go∣vern so accomplish'd a Daughter; She, like You, had an exquisite Judg∣ment, to discern Persons, before en∣tring into any Engagement, further than what the modest Converse of a decent Visit would afford. She, like You, had such reservedness in all her Actions, and so strict a Watch over her Desires, that nothing but the fa∣tal mistake through which she gave

to a worthy Person that Heart, which was design'd for another by a discreet Mother's Choice, could have produc'd that mischief, which prov'd the unhappiness of her whole Life. May the Comparison terminate here, Madam, and you never have occa∣sion to act any further her Part, by keeping such a constant Guard on your Heart, as may  it from all Surprises; such a  can ne∣ver be too carefully preserv'd, while there are so many men that would leave no ways unattempted to the possession of it, even by the advan∣tage of such an unfortunate mistake, by which Madmoiselle of Roye lost hers; and when the Time which the Heavens; have appointed for the

change of your Condition is come, in lieu of such a Disaster, may you be blest with a Person worthy your Af∣fections; that is, with one accom∣plish'd with all the Gifts of Nature, and the Superstructure of Arts, with such a Person as would be the Object of the Vows of every one that knows your Merits. Amongst the Crowd of those your Admirers, I beg for ad∣mittance, in Quality of,
MADAM,
