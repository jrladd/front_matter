SIn is the Cause of all Judgement, and the Be∣wailing of our own and o∣ther mens sins, is the only way to have judgement removed in Mer∣cy; Misery is the Touchstone

whereby true friendship is tried; God hath tried you, and I have found you such as I may trust. Therefore all the blessings that I can conceive in my heart, both of this world and that which is to com be upon you, for comforting my drooping spirit, and strengthning me now in my weaknesse.
And now let me entreat your Patronage of this Complaint, to defend me from the Calumnies of my Children, who have deserted me in the time of my Calamity, though they that are fled have not left me out of obstinacy, but fearfulnesse and want of knowledge: This your Patronage I intreat for Edificati∣on, desiring with the Apostle all

things may be done with meeknesse. And the Blessing of God the Fa∣ther, the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with you all.
 LONDON-CITY.
