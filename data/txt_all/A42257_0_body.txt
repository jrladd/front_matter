May it please your Most Excellent Majesty,
THIS Translation out of Spanish, having
the Name of Royal Commentaries, seems
justly to claim a Title to Your MAJE∣STY'S
gratious Favour and Protection: And like∣wise
Your MAJESTY'S Dominions being adja∣cent
and almost contiguous to the Countries which are
the subject of this History, make Your MAJESTY
a Party concerned in the Affairs of the New World, and
so supreme an Arbitrator in the Government thereof, that
to suppress the Robberies and Insolence of certain Pi∣rates
who infest those Coasts, Your MAJESTY'S
Royal Arms are called for, as the most proper Means
and Power to reduce them. Great also is Your MA∣JESTY'S
Fame in the East as well as in the
West-Indies: And may all the World court Your
Friendship and Alliance, and doe honour to Your Roy∣al
Standard.
May Your MAJESTY be still happy with
Increase of Glory and Honour both at home and abroad,
untill such time as that you exchange this mortal Crown
for one everlasting in the World to come. Which is
the fervent Prayer of,
Dread Sovereign,
Your MAJESTY'S
most obedient,
most dutifull,
and most loyal
Subject and Servant,
