ASton a Stone cut from the marble Quar,
Fram'd to out-live the flames of civil war;
With all the bounties of the heavens befriended
Nineteen brave Knights, two princely Lords descended.
From this great Stem laden with Honours spoil,
That now o'respreads Great Brittains fruitful Isle.
Tixal the Fountain, whence these Heroes flow,
Where Hospitality and Bounty grow.
Here Corydon doth act a pleasant Scean,
While his swift grinders sweep the Table clean.
Here I my noble Ancestors of old,
Tracing the steps of Charity behold,
By Loves fair hand to mine own Cradle led,
Aston and Lucy joyned in one Bed.
