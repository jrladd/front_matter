THe great care and paines (Right Honourable, and Right Wor∣shipfull) which upon Reference from the Right Honourable the Lords and Others of His Majesties Most Honourable Privie Counsell, Your Lordship, with Others Your Brethren, Committees worthily selected, namely, Sir Ed∣ward Bromfield, Sir Morris Abbot Knights, Master Alderman Abdi and Master Alderman Garwaie, maturely tooke about the examining,
 altering and perfecting of this my new Booke of Assise, for both sorts of weights (howbeit, under favour, I may averre, the same was by me exact∣ly computed) together with your high Commen∣dation thereof by Certificate to their Honours, as also the continuall industry and travell of the Lord Major and Sheriffes of this famous Citie, annuis vicibus, or from yeare to yeare, in assising and looking to the Assise and Weight of Bread, have moved me (as one compelled, and as it were challenged by due Gratitude, humbly to present and tender the same Worke to your most deser∣ving Patronage, with firme confidence, that as a Childe of towardly disposition, when hee is growne up, and by honest meanes hath attained a faire estate or certaine livelyhood, cannot be un∣welcome to his Foster-father, by whom hee was carefully cherished, educated and preferred; This Issue of my laborious Art and Study, begot∣ten and brought forth for the general good of this Kingdome, shall now (having received so emi∣nent preferment, compleat condition, and condu∣cible supply) enjoy the benigne Entertainment of Your Lordship and Worships, much transcen∣ding your former approvement; And so much
 the more in respect of my annexed Relation or Collection of Dearths and Famines, with the severall occasions therof, concluding with a dis∣covery of the Bakers delusions and abuses, where every prudent Magistrate may learne, or, at the least, be put in minde of the best meanes (under God) from hence forth to prevent such mortall misery; Not doubting, but Your good Lordship & Worships will be no lesse diligent & forward therein, as also to see the just Assise of Bread observed, with due execution of their Honors Orders, and Articles touching the same, then your Lordship and the rest of the said Com∣mittees were, to have this Book of Assise (being first by me computed for Troy weights onely) altered examined & perfected: In my unwave∣ring confidence whereof, and fearing, I might seeme to hold a lighted Taper before the Sun, or (like a simple smatterer in Grammar, that will presume to instruct his learned Master) minister my shallow advise to your deepe Wisedomes, I here conclude, most fervently beseeching the Lord of Lords, that gives us all our daily Bread, to blesse, direct and keepe your Lordship and Worships both in your slves and your most wor∣thy
 Successours to the comfortable assistance and protection of Widowes and Orphanes, with all indigent, impotent, and iniured persons within your Iurisdictions and Immunities, the happie health and conservation of this unparalleld Body Politicke, and the earth-measuring celebration of your owne particular Honours, never to die, while men (as men) doe live, or Englands rich Republick shall indure. And finally, that when all mortality in you shall vanish, your good deeds may be rewarded (though not with ruling power and command) with farre exceeding Robes of Righteousnesse, and glorious Crownes of Im∣mortality in the City of God for ever and ever.
