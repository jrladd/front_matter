NOne should, but Thou, This Ladies death be grieâˆ£ving;
None knew so well the Vertues of her life:
Death's robd of Her death, by Thy labours rife;
By Thee, is Shee in Heav'n & Earth still liuing:
Heav'n, by hearing & (through Thee) belieuing
Th' eternall Word; which taught Her Holy strife
Gainst Hell, & Sin; and (as becomes a Wife)
Peace with her Spouse, him due Obedience giuing:
Earth, for acting (in so gracious measure)
The twice-preacht Lectures of thy Life & Tongue;
Alms, Meeknes, Mildnes (towards Old & Young)
 giuing wrongs, forgetting all Displeasure.
O happy Seed that fell in such a Ground!
And happy Soile that such a Seed-man found.
