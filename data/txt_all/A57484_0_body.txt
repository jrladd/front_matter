Most honoured Sir,
YOu have sufficiently satisfied the World of the Curiosity you have for whatever, in any measure, de∣serves it: You were pleas'd to give me a hint of the Piece I here present you withal; and your recommendation of the Original might well raise in me a hope of your readier accep∣tance of the Translation. It is the noblest of humane Actions to vouchsafe a kind Enter∣tainment to the Distress'd, whether Nature or Fortune hath made them Calamitous. The equality of Misery makes the Endurers of it most commonly the more compassionate; so far as that those who have been first reliev'd charitably direct others to the same Almoners.
Thus do I bring to your doors a company of poor Caribbians, to offer you their Respects and Submissions, in the name of all those Islands, whereof their Ancestors have been heretofore possess'd in the Ocean of America: They are in hopes, that neither the obscurity of their Origine, nor the harshness of their Lan∣guage, nor the barbarisme of their Manners, nor their strange course of Life, nor the cruelty of their Wars, nor their ancient Poverty, nor

lastly the unconstancy of their Fortune, will hinder your favourable Reception of them. And what heightens this hope of theirs, is, an imagination, that you, who find leisure to be∣stow your Eye and Thoughts on so infinite a Multitude of Volumes as press from all parts of the World into your Library, may be pleas'd with something that is done among them; and that the History of the Caribbies may entertain you, not only with a delightful Variety, as to the divertisement of the Sight, but also with many occurrences capable of exciting your Admiration.
What may be further said on their behalf, I leave to be express'd in their own natural Rhetorick, and bethink me of making some Apology for my self; which is only this, That the presumption of the present Address is in some measure the effect of your Goodness and Candor, and that it had been but a necessary expression of my Gratitude, had I many years since profess'd how much I am,
Most honoured Sir,
