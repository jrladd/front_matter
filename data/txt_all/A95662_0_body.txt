Worthy Fathers of your Country,
IT is said of the Ambassadours of the King of Persia, that comming to Athens, the Metropolis of Learn∣ing, in the time of the seven Wise men, they de∣sired that each of them would deliver in his sentence, that they might report unto their Master the wisedome of Greece; which accordingly they did, only one of them was silent: which the Ambassadors observing, intreated him also to cast in his sym∣bole with the rest: Tell your Prince (quoth hee) there are of the Grecians, that can hold their peace. Verily, it had been my wisdome altogether to have held my Peace in such an Audience, or having spoken once, to have proceeded no further, but as this Sermon, such as it is, came to the birth by your Authority, so your Command now is the Midwifery to bring it forth. The ice thus broken, I shall make a double vertue of this necessity. First, by supplying and making out the failings of mine own unfaith∣full
 Memory; and this done, though there were , in mee, yet I hope to finde an , an act of oblivion from you. Secondly, I shall bee your remembrancer by restoring the losse of the care to the eye: Words, wee say, are wind, and un∣lesse they bee taken upon the wing, even while they are fly∣ing, and brought to the Presse, they are gone and lost. You know whose wish it was, Oh that my words were now writ∣ten, Oh that they were Printed in a Book! as if that were the onely way to preserve the memory of things, and to imprint them so deeply in the mnde, as never to bee forgotten. And though I may seeme hereby to serve in your cloyed appetites with a Crambe his cocta, and obtrude upon you, that which is no way worthy to bee laid up in those full fraught promptuaries of better notions, it may bee yet of some use to meaner understand∣ings, and by this meanes too, that whch was delivered in the ears of one Congregaton, shall be offered to the publck view of all, who so will, may take and read: and if by any thing herein, I may, for the promoting the great cause in hand, in the least measure, put more life into our Devotions, more speed and quick∣nesse into our motions, I have my end. And now, Ever honour∣ed Patriots, that I have been Gods remembrancer to you, I will bee bold to bee your remembrancer to God, that the Lord of Peace himselfe would give you peace alwayes, and by all meanes, that hee would let you see Hierusalem in prospeity, and peace upon Israel, and in recompence of all your work of Faith, and la∣bour of Love, and Patience of Hope, hee would fill you with length of honourable time here, and with a glorious eternity here∣after.
