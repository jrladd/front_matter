SIR,
I Present these Curiosities to your Lord∣ship, as to the most Knowing Man in this Choice Kind of Learning, in the World. If any conceive the Subject to be of too Daring a Nature, and Vnfit to present a Pre∣late with; whose Profession is onely, To Know his Masters Crosse; let them remem∣ber, that the most Pious among the Ancient Fa∣thers have not disdained the Curiosities of the Gentiles: besides that, Preaching, wherein Your Lordspips Excellency is such, as that it ren∣ders You Admired by All, as an Oracle; ought to be accompanied with Whatsoever may conduce to the Knowledge of God: out of which number, These Choise Pieces of Antiquity may not be ex∣cluded. All France acknowledgeth Your Lord∣ship to be as a second Saint Paul of Our Age: seeing that, since the time of this Great Apostle,
the Gospel hath not been preached more Learned∣ly, nor with greater Eloquence, and Zeale, by Any, then by Your Selfe, and Your Disciples. So that the Height of my Desures can be but this; that These my Conceptions, which I here present You with, may be but received by Your Lordship as well, as Those that issue from Your Lord∣ships Pious Breast are, by all the World.
If I arrive but to This, I shall esteeme my Selfe doubly Happy; having beene already long since so, in having the liberty to call my selfe,
My Lord,
