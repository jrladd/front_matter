May it please Your Grace,
THo it be Prover∣bial, That Arts
 are happy, when exami∣ned by True Artists; yet, we must confess, 'tis sometimes no small dis∣advantage to undergo the Censure of clear∣sighted Judges; because nothing can escape their all-seeing Eyes, and the Artificer him∣self, with his Work, stands or falls by their Verdict. Nevertheless, I am not in the least ap∣prehensive of Your Gra∣ces Censure, tho fully
 perswaded You are a Great Master in the Art of Divine Converse; be∣cause Your piercing Eye shall discover nothing in this small Treatise, that already You are not acquainted with, and undoubtedly practise daily, in the midst of Your most serious Af∣fairs: So I may say, You shall meet here with no∣thing else but a Copy of Your Great Self, tho im∣perfect, and far short of

This Trea∣tise then is indeed as a New-Years-Gift, but not New to Your Grace: It points out an easie Me∣thod of Conversing up∣on all Occasions with God; but the same is made much easier to Imitation, by the live∣ly Examples of Your eminent Piety and Learning. I must in this Conjuncture, discover ingenuously to Your Grace the most sincere
 Sentiments of my Heart, that I rejoyce more than I can express, to become a Member of the Church of England, wherein I observe so great Examples of solid Doctrine and Christian Piety; which I see go∣verned by so Loyal, so Learned, so Charitable, so Zealous Prelates and Pastors. I hate flattery, My Lord, Cane pejus & angue, above all things. I shall say then, without
 the least exaggeration of the Truth, That we have no reason to ad∣mire the present Glory of this Church, since we know the true Cau∣ses thereof; I mean our Gracious Soveraign's most Wise and Peacable Government, and Your Graces eminent Learn∣ing, and Apostolick Zeal: By the former You are a declared Ene∣my against all Errours; by the latter, you op∣pose
 with the vigour of a Primitive Prelate what∣ever appears disorderly and sinful. That you may continue this and the ensuing Years in a full Health, necessary to such glorious Enterpri∣ses, it shall be the hearty wish of him him who is,
