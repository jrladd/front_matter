Honoured Cozen,
IT is so long since I writ to you, that I am now ashamed to appear before you any other way then this, where this little mark of my respect, may something pre∣tend to your pardon for what is past, by shewing you, That how∣ever

I may have neglected, I can never forget you; and although I am sensible, that I repair an unkindness by an injury, whil'st I impose this Trifle upon your Patronage; yet I cannot much consider that, when I call to mind how kindly you have ever entertained my friendship, and how unapt you are to inter∣pret your friends to their disad∣vantage. This little thing that I present to you, and to the world in your name, I translated seven years ago, by my Fathers com∣mand, who was a great admirer of the Author: so that what you see, was an effect of my obedi∣ence, and no part of my choice; my little studies (especially at that time) lying another way:

neither had I now puhlished it, but that I was unwilling to have a thing (how mean soever) turned to waste Paper, that cost me some hours pains, and which (however I may have disguised it) is no ill thing in it self.
For what concerns the Dedi∣cation of it to you, I must con∣fess, that besides my gratitude, to which I am ever bound, I had a collaterall design upon your protection, supposing that the censuring world would use me with more respect upon your account; and although you stand in need of no Morall precept to make you a perfect good man: yet perhaps it may not be altoge∣ther unpleasant to you, to look back into your own practice,

and to read over your own Ver∣tues, which are such, as amongst many others, and many wor∣thier have particularly obliged me to profess my self
Honoured Cozen,

February 27. 1663.
