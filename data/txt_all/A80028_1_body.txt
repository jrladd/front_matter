Worthy Sir,
ALL happiness and peace I wish you: And ha∣ving been very desi∣rous (since the first time I ever met with ought of yours) to gratifie you according to your worth and desert; and finding no means and wayes thereunto, I have deigned to present these few Pages unto you, thereby to testifie (in part) the high esteem and honorable respect that I adjudge you worthy of.

Sir, accept of this in love, pass your candid censure of it, and though the Phrases and Style be mean, let the Matter and Drift excuse it. Again, considering by me 'twas penn'd (in a few dayes) with much haste, and past from me immediately, no person fitter then your self to patronize these Art∣less Lines, could I find, because your Youthful years were in the same man∣ner spent.
