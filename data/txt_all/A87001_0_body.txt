Courteous Reader
I Know not into whose hands this my smal Booke may light into, but I have so much a cofindence in Truth, that heel never shame his Master, nor for my part I will never be ashamed to own him, if there be any thing disliking to the pa∣let of any Man in my Booke, let him not unload his stomack openly to the Author, for that will but shew he hath a foule inside, though he carries a fair outside, this is but a Cordiall gathered from Truths Garden, the Scripture of such hearbs that is relishing to all that loveth the Garden or the Gardener, the Physitian of Souls will tell you so, nor doe I give it you out of malice to doe you harm, but hoping it may work with you for the good of you and yours in this life, and that to come: if you take it any otherwise; the Garters Motto Jle present you with, evil to them that evil thinks: I wish
you better then you wish your selves, that is that you would know your selves what you have been, what you may be, and what you must be, The first you know, the second God knows, the last all Men knows you must be brought to Judgment, when we all shall heare but two Sentences: come or de∣part. And whatsoever you owe me (being the Author of this little Booke) if it be ill will, I will returne you by bill of Exchange, this wish from the botom of my heart, that you may both deserve and have the first sentence of come you Blessed, de∣serve it through Christs merits, and receive it from his mouth, which shall be the Prayer of him which desires Mercy and Truth to meet together, and Righteousness and Peace to kiss each other.
