WHether you may like this Sermon in reading it, as well as you did in hearing it, I (who am conscious of the meanness of it) should greatly doubt, if I were not well satisfied concerning your Love and Candour. My design and desire was therein (as it is in all my weak Labours) to profit, more than to please; and the profit of many was, I believe, your aim and hope in pressing me to the Publication thereof; I have therefore yielded, that your Request should over-rule my own Aversness to the Press.
The Text discours'd on led me to speak of so many seve∣ral Particulars, that they could not be fully discussed by me in one Discourse, (tho' long enough for the Occasion.) What I have briefly hinted to explain, how Elders are over the Church, I have read more largely declared, in the Writings of Dr. Owen, Dr. Goodwin, and others, (as I suppose you also have) where such as desire more full satisfaction, con∣cerning that, or other Points, may find it; I follow them so far, as I understand they follow the Word of God, the only in∣fallible Rule. Now that the Father of Lights, and the God of all Grace, would teach Us, and the several Churches of Christ, over which he hath set us, so to walk, as is here plainly declared; and much more abundantly, according to his Holy Word; and that he would strengthen our Hands in his great Work, against all Discouragements, and that the Word of the Gospel may greatly prevail, and that this mean Dis∣course may be somewhat subservient thereunto, is the earnest Prayer of,
Dear and Reverend Brethren,

Norwich, Dec. 17. 1697.
