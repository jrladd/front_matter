MADAM,
BEing to Sacrifice Strato∣nica, I humbly beg your Pardon if I do it on the Altar of your Ladiships Perfections and Patron∣age, where I hope I may take Sanctua∣ry, and holding on my course (since
your Honor's at the Helm) have a favorable Passage through the World of Mens Opinions. To you therefore Madam (whose delicate Composition can be equalled onely by the Beauty of your Minde) I offer up and consecrate these my First-Fruits in this kinde. And though the little Brook (which re∣turning to the Sea, and there gratefully emptying it self) may as well make the Ocean overflow, as this Tribute of Gratitude express my Devotions to your Ladiship, yet be pleased (Madam) to accept of this little Oblation from the Hands and Heart of
MADAM
