your Royal Father of blessed memory, confirmed unto me during my life, by the Great Seale of England,) is to intro∣duce Forreign Prin∣ces or their publick Representatives to your Sacred Pre∣sence. And in re∣gard the Place of Surveyor Generall



was also intended to me (after late Inigo Jones) I doe make bold to introduce the three Capitall Principles of good Building to your Sa∣cred Majesty, who hath seen more state∣ly Palaces and Build∣ings, than all your Ancestors, and may be a Pattern to all



future Posterity, by Building of your own Palace worthy your Self, and place∣ing it as the Italians for their health, de∣light, and convien∣cy (as well as Solidi∣ty and Ornament,) La Matina alli Monti, la Sera alli Fonti, ac∣cording to which the main body of



your Royal Palace may be set on the side of Saint James's Park, and the Gar∣dens along the Ri∣ver.
If the Book af∣foards any thing worthy your Sacred Majesties further sa∣tisfaction, I have obtained my end, and done the Du∣ty



intended by
