May it please your MAJESTY.
THE God of all Mercy's, who giveth salvation unto Kings; having answered our Prayers, and Crown'd our joy's, in graciously resto∣ring your Soveraign Power, and safely returning your Sacred Person; This, England's Gratulation, made first an offering of Thankfulness unto God, is now made a Tribute of Allegiance unto your Majesty; humbly presented from that Heart and Hand, which in all the variety of State-commotions, hath still

own'd, and publickly own'd, the duty and devotion of Loyalty and Love.
Indeed, under our heavyest weight of oppressions, beholding your Sacred Ma∣jesty bearing the Cross, when your Royal Head should have worne the Crown; Your Christian Patience, became our Princely Patterne for Constancy; Your Majesty constant in your faith to God, we constant in our faithfulness to your Ma∣jesty; so that, the Tribute we pay (dread Soveraign) is that of your own coyne, and stampt with your own Image.
Now, I pray God grant your Maje∣sty, such an holy and happy improvement of that Disciplinary Providence, where∣with your Majesty hath been so long exercised; as to the Devotions of piety, the compassions of Charity, the zeal of Justice, the love of Learning, the exer∣cise of Arms, the transaction of Affairs,

and in all the Accomplishments of Prince∣ly Wisedome, made solid and firm by long Experience. That, all the Loyal Sub∣jects of your Majesties three Kingdoms, joyfully beholding these, the Jewels of your Crown, the perfections of your Roy∣alty, may clearly see, that, had not your Majesty the indubitable Right of Heir Apparent to your Father'sFor which, together with the Churches Rights, and his Subjects Liberties, He dy'd a Royal Martyr, of Blessed Me∣mory; now Crown'd with an everlasting glory. Crowns; yet, there is not, amongst the best of Princes or Men, so fit a subject of their Choyce, to make the Soveraign of their Hearts, as King Charles the Second.
Indeed, My Leige, This is your So∣veraignty (and may it be as happily con∣tinued, as it is miraculously recovered,) Over the Hearts of your People: who are now so devoted in their Loyalty, that your Majesty reigns in their Love. And thus reigning, Your Majesty will be the Ornament of your Throne, in your Royal

Vertues: more then, the Throne your Majesties ornament, in all it's Glory's. Which yet, that the King of Kings would make transplendently glorious; And so, the progress of your Majesties Life, like the encrease of our holy Faith, may be from glory to glory, Is the hearty pray∣er, of him, who knows nothing in his heart, next the Love to his Saviour, more dear then this duty, of being
(Dread Soveraigne)
