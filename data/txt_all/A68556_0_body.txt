AFTER THAT I HAD
(worshipfull Sir) taken
some payne, in collec∣tynge
certayne hydden
Secretes together, & reduced them
into one libel, or Pamphlet (for my
own behoofe, & my familiar frēds:)
yet at the instance of a certayne
Gentlewoman (being my dere and
speciall frende) I was constrained
to publish the same, and considered
wich my selfe the saying of ye wise:
which is. That good is best, which to
all indifferētly, is of like goodnes, or effect:
or which without respect of person, is good
to all indifferently. The consideration

of which, and her importunacie to∣gethers
instiged me to cōmunicate
vnto the view & publique benefite
of all men, this lytell Booke: The
coments wherof, doth instruct and
teach all maner of persones & De∣grees
to know perfectly, the maner
to make diuers & sundrie sortes of
fine Conceits aswell of meates, as
of Cōserues & Marmalades, as al∣so,
of sweete and pleasant Waters,
of wonderfull Odours, Operation
and Vertues: With diuers other
things that haue not hitherto ben
publiquely knowen: which fact of
myne (I know) wyll be, not onelye
dessyked of some, but altogether cō∣dempned:
Not for that it is euyll,
but that their fine heades can not
disgest, that any other beside them
selues shuld enioy the benefit ther∣of,
hauing for their MAXIME, that
such thynges, are of small price, as
are common to al men: much after

our Englysh Prouerbs, Quainty and
daintie: Farre fette and deare bought, is
good for great Estates. But I account
that Persone foolysh, and vnwor∣thy
helpe of any Phisition or Sur∣gion:
that wyll refuse to receyue,
or gayne health by the Medicine of
any suche Physition or Surgion:
Who by learnynge the same out of
A VICENE, GALENE, or HIPOCRA∣TES,
or any others suche lyke, hath
often tymes cured the Deseuses in
sundrie and many Persones, for
that the same hath ben commonly
vsed: but rather moste wyllynglye
and courteouslye to imbrace the
same (for present remedye) as a
thyng excellently well experymen∣ted
and prooued: I neede not (right
Worshypfull) to vse these wordes,
for the Defence of this litle Boke,
cōsideryng ye your Worship doth ve∣ry
wel accept such things, as vny∣uersally
bryng wt them a publique

profit and vtylitie: (whence consi∣steth
your delight,) rewardyng ly∣berally,
the trauayle of suche, who
haue, & do trauayle therin. Wher∣fore,
for that I among al other per∣sones,
do thinke my selfe moste be∣holden
vnto your worship: To gra∣tifie
your goodnesse, and to satisfie
the request of my frend, I haue com∣piled
this litle Boke. which I haue
put forth vnder your W. name and
protection: protestyng, yt if I shall
see this worke, which wt some cost
and charge, I haue brought to per∣fectiō,
be wel accepted at your hāds
I shall shortly exhibite vnto your
Worshyp, a thyng of greater valew
and estymation. And thus, cōmyt∣tyng
your good worshyp to God. I
ende: who sende you your desire of
vnderstandyng and knowledge.
