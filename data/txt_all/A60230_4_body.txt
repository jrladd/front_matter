My LORD,
MY Obligations to your LORD∣SHIP have long since called for such Acknowledgement, as ought to appear under the Title of the Noblest Subject. Had any, within the Prospect of my Fancy, been more Eminent, then this of HANNIBAL, I had made choice of it, as Ad∣equate to your Merits: but, none appearing, I have selected what SILIUS left untouched, to

raise out of it this little Monument of my Gratitude; having no other Means to ex∣press it. I confess, I, at first, intended to adven∣ture on the THIRD PUNICK VVAR; which, though of less Continuance, then this SECOND, had in it as gallant Actions (especially in that famous SIEGE of CARTHAGE) as any HIS∣TORY doth mention: but, Conscious of the VVeakness of what I have already built, I fear∣ed, that, by raising, too many Stories, It might fall under its own Bulk, and my self under the Censure of Ambition, in aspiring to so great a VVork. I have therefore rather chosen to de∣sist, and fix this little Piece under your LORD∣SHIP'S Name, as a VOTIVE Table to testifie to the VVorld, how much I am,
