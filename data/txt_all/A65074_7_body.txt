THe Compasse of the subject entrea∣ted upon in this Sermon was too large to be surveied in a short time. The nature of Haeresy lies under much obscurity and inevidence. The Infidel who comes not in at all, And the Apostate who goes out at all are visible enough to the eye, but the Haere∣ticke who like a cunning Bankerupt breakes with some stock in his hand, and holds' some planks of truth when the ship is broken, is more hardly to bee knowne. I have not spoken much about the punish∣ment of an Haereticke, but rather chose to shew you who hee is then what to doe with him. There are good rules for the Church her proceeding against such men, which may also serve very fitly to the meridian of your jurisdiction, as namely, in peccatis eviden∣tiam, in paenis aedificationem; & againe, nec cito in apertis, nec unquam in ambiguis, with many other, which lay on the other side of the hedge from my way
 which was toward the investigation of the nature of Haeresie, wherein I hope that what I have offered shall be interpreted with candour, for it was not my mea∣ning to speake thunder & lightning, but to speake to the enlightning of the minds of the auditory, and not to the burning of Haereticks bodies; if any man please to compare my language with that stile wherein the holy scripture speakes of false teachers and their corrupting mens minds, I doubt not but that I shall be found not guilty of rayling, whereof I have already beene indited in print, but I must make amends for a long Sermon with a short Epistle; and therefore in a word, Be quick (Noble Gentlemen) in setling the interest of Christ in this Kingdome. God hath paid you well aforehand, if that doe not set an edge upon you, yet be confident that he hath somewhat behinde remaining yet in his hand, which he will not part with untill he see your worke for him in some forwardnesse, and the longer the yarne hangs in the loome, the more it is ravelled, you have beene told that you have no∣thing to doe in the reformation of the Church, give not the world occasion to suspect that you thinke so too, but goe on with God, and prosper, and the Lord make your way plaine before your face,
