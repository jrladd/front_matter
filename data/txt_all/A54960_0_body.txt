SIR,
YOU may please to remember, when I had the Honour to be in your Company last, at Soun∣dess; part of our Discourse was upon Dedications. I believe you did not then apprehend the Danger so near. But, this Play being kindly receiv'd by the Audi∣ence; I hope it will not meet with a worse Fate, when it claims your Protection. You have known me from my Childhood, and my Inclination to Poetry; and 'tis from

the Happiness of that Acquaintance, I pre∣sume to make so Worthless an Offering. This also, joyn'd with your Good Hu∣mour, secures me from the Severity of your Iudgment, which gives you Power to be the greatest of Criticks. I need not tell England, how much you have always Serv'd your Country; since that would be e Proclaiming it to be Light at Noon∣day. I know, all Witty Men, especially your self, hate any thing, that tends to∣wards Flattery; therefore I shall only in Sincerity tell you: I am,
SIR,
