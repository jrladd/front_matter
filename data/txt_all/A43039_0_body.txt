Madam,
THe world (for the most part) is like the Cy∣press-Tree, long and fruitless; and like Tul∣lies strange Soyl, for all the sweet showres that fall upon, it it's still
dry as dust. The cause of it is either ignorance or negligence, want of Knowledge in the will of God, or Non-Improvement. I have endeavoured to remove these Obstructions, and to take the rubs out of the way. There are but two extreams, Presumpti∣on and Desperation, which like Scylla and Charybdis, make ship∣wrack of all the vesseds they met with. Where these waters break out, they beat down all before them. They are alike dangerous (faith Chrysost.) For Presum∣ption falls him that standeth, and Desperation after a fall admits no rising. This small Tract (Ma∣dam)
by Gods assistance will in∣form the one, and reform the other. It will be an eye to the ignorant, and a spur to the negligent; for it treats only of Christ, and as the Star the Wise men, will con∣duct them to him. But I am loth to take too large a survey in so small a piece of ground. They that write must not forget that Rule of the Orator, ut titulum legant, to read the Title of their Books, least like the gates of Min∣dus, it proves bigger then the City it self. I was ambitions to dedi∣cate it to your Honour, that it might kiss your hand, which hath been so often open to men of my
calling and condition, and in particular to my self, the meanest of them who serve at the Altar. Now the God of Heaven be your continual guard and guide; his Blessings in a plurality light upon your Honour, and your whole Fa∣mily, as the dew on Gideons Fleece. This shall alwayes be the unfeigned Prayers of.
