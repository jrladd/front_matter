WOrthy Sir, hauing written the true manner of your late Famous,
perilous, and fortunate Fight with the Portugals in the Pos
Gulph, and knowing that Bookes without Patrons are like father∣lesse
Children, I imagined that it was better to send it to you for
succour and protection, than to any other whomsoeuer; for the
most part which is herein by Relation, I am assured that you doe know to bee
ture by Action, and my Pen hath but only superficially pratled of those things
wch you saw, did, & suffered. I therfore humbly intreat you to accept this poore
Fish out of your owne Ocean, this sheepe of your owne fold, this cloah of your
owne weauing, and this deserued memorie of part of your worthy won Repu∣tation.
Thus not doubting but your affabilitie is correspondent to your appro∣ued
knowledge and knowne sufficiencie, I commit both my selfe and this Re∣lation
to your acceptance and good censure, my best wishes still attending on
you, that your fortunes be euer equall to the goodnesse of your minde.
