Honourable LORD,
LOe here A Monument of mans Mortalitie, erected in haste, to represent the Death and Funerals, of my good Lord, your Noble Brother; whose heroicke LIFE requires more lea∣sure
 to build A MAVSOLE to his Im∣mortall Memorie. Meane time J offer vnto your Grace, these mournefull Spoiles, and fu∣nerall Trophees, as most proper and due vnto you; his Successour and Jnheritour; in assu∣rance you will accept them fauourably, and with your gracious aspect, giue them, a speak∣ing-power, as the Sunnes reflection did on the Image of Memnon. The Ghostly vi∣sage of his Effigie I know, cannot affright your Grace, who is ready and prepared at all howers for Death; nor (I hope) will the re∣presentation of it, renew your griefe, as Io∣sephs particoloured Coate, caused sorow to his father Iacob, and Caesars shirt to Cal∣purnia: But that you will looke and behold in it as a Mirror to see your Fate, as your Fortune; and so esteeme me for euer one of
Aprill 20. 1624.
