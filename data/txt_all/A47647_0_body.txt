May it please your Lordship,
ALthough the following Discourse be, for the most part, built upon that Authority that needs no Patronage to defend it; yet I no sooner agreed to the making of it Publick, but I saw a necessity of affixing your Lordship's great Name before it: Not to remind you, My Lord, of your Duty, of which you need no Monitor, but your own Active Piety; but to let the World know, That whatever of Worth it carries in it, has had its Origen from your Lordship's Encouragement and Support, and there∣fore must justly become your Votary. I
confess, My Lord, 'tis too slender a sig∣nification of that unfeign'd and undelible Gratitude I owe to you; but if your Honour please to make an Addition to your former Favours by the acceptance of this first Testimony of my Regards, I hope, My Lord, if Success crown my under∣takings, to acknowledge them very short∣ly in some greater Instance. In the interim, the great Importance of your Publick Charge making me sensible that your mi∣nutes are sacred, and that therefore 'twould be a Piacle to invade them with a tedious Address, I shall only add, That the height of the Honour I most passionately aspire to, is, that my deserts may give me the Title of,
My Lord,

Octob. 30. 1688.
