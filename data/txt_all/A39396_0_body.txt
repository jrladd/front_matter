Most DREAD SOVERAIGN,
HE who is so brain-sick as to question or dispute the Antiquity of KINGS and MONARCHICAL Government, will put the choicest Wits to their Trumps, to find out a Nomenclation to expresse his Folly, the Word Fanatick being too weak and slender. KINGS write in the plural Number, Mandamus, volu∣mus, facimus, &c. which is GOD's own Stile: And in Scripture we oft find them called GODS and Man; as a civil Creature, was directed to that kind of subjection, as if the sole Observation of Nature had necessarily led this Affections of Men to this kind of STATE. Whence it is also that whilst Others of the most curious in Philosophy, tell us of Angels and the Supreme Heavens being immediately Governed by the Maker of all things, they add together that upon the Earth, KINGS are in like sort of Government; as if natural Reason had at first Ordained them on Earth by an una∣voidable imitation of their Creators Providence; and que∣stionlesse, MONARCHY as far exceeds Oligarchy, Demo∣cratie, Aristocratie, or that so much lately gaped after Anar∣chy, as the Sun in its purest and most perfect lustre the smallest Star.

This ensuing Treatise will lay open and unfold the manner of Great Brittains Government, which was ever Princely, (con∣trary to this Chymerical Anarchy) the which your Majesties most faithful and humble Subject with much of fear and reve∣rence (as being too rustick and homely to appear before so great a Majesty) offers up, begging of Almighty God to grant You a long and happy Reign, Fruitful and Princely Off-spring, adorned with all Vertues and heroick Endowments to Succeed You; that You may say with the Prophetical King and Kingly Prophet, Blessed be the Lord my God, who hath caused my Eyes to see this day, that one of my own Loyns shall sit upon my Throne. And for this all Loyal Subjects ought pray; and so shall he incessantly, who is,
