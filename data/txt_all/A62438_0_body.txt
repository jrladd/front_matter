May it please your Highness,
IT was once my Hap∣pyness in the late Wars to be under the MARTIAL CON∣DUCT of your Re∣nowned BROTHER, PRINCE MAVRICE, Beloved by all Loyal Generous Spirits for his Valour and Pru∣dence. Now I bless the Heavens that promise me the Benevolent Aspect of your





Candid Mercurial Genius upon these Chymi∣cal Labours, which I humbly present to the View of your Piercing Eye, most able to make an In pection into the Verity of Things arising from Pyrotechnie and Manufacture.
My Thoughts did heretofore seem to be settled never to Dedicate, for the future, a Writing of mine to any whomsoever: yea, I had continued in that mind, to expose Truth abroad solitary to shift for it self (con∣ceiving it best able to maintain her own Propriety) but that hearing it frequently discoursed in most Company I met with; how ardently your Highness was devoted to serve the Nation for Publick Good: What a Philomathes and Philalethes, Sin∣cere Lover and Defender you were of Es∣sential Truths and Ingenious Arts in Gene∣ral, especially Mechanical Pyrotechnical Operations, an Assertor of Experimental Optical and Sensible Effects, Fruits and Pro∣ducts of things, and that for this Reason you had an extraordinary Kindness for our most Excellent Philosopher Van Helmont, your Country-man; I fortwith, affected with these Rare Endowments, altered my former Intentions, resolving now to make my Address to such a Mecaenas (for the discussion of these our Chymical Problemes by Fact) whose Head is known to be en∣dowed





with Subtil Inventions, Indefatiga∣ble Inquiry after Rarities and Arcana's, whose Heart is full of Integrity, Heroick Designs, Magnanimity, and Hands most active in contriving Exquisite Works, and Daedalean Mechanicks. Wherefore, Truly Noble SIR, be pleased to accept of this Oblation, which hath its chief Original from Pyrotechnie; And according as you find it bear the Test Entertain or Reject it. The Sum of this Physical Tract is a Practical Discovery of the Notable Errours of the Ga∣lenists, Avouching that their Principles in Physiologie are False; that they are Ignorant of the Quiddity, Essence, or the True Ra∣dical Essential Cause of all Diseases: That they are grosly to seek in the Direct Method or shortest Way of Curing them: That the Indications or Measures they take from Heat and Cold, applicating upon that ground (ac∣cording to the Rule of Contraries) their In∣dicata or Remedies are both Fraudulent, and Pestilent to Mortals. That their Unacquain∣tance with the Synthsis or Constitution of the Vital Spirit, the Cause of its Rage and Perturbation from somthing very offensive to it (wherepon the Image of a Disease is delineated) is the Reason why they thus neglect to support Nature as they ought, to allay its Tempests, to deface Morbisick Idea's





by Specificks. Lastly, being altogether Oc∣cupied about the Cutting off the Accidents Qualities, Epigenomena, Symptoms and Products of Evils, by Bleeding and Purg∣ing, they are insufficient to Cure Directly, Immediately and Radically any great Malig∣nant Feaver, Pleurisie, &c.
The Boon I beg of your Highness is, not to suffer the Truth to be abused through the Collusions, Sophistical Evasions, Equi∣vocations, Supplantations, Scurrilous Lan∣guage and Affronts of our Antagonists: but that there may be a plain Judicious Deter∣mination of these Controversies according to the clear Evidence of Fact, and the Re∣ality of Experiments: For which the Genu∣ine Professors of this Philosophical Chymical Art will be bound to Celebrate your Praises to all Posterity.
