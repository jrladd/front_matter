SIR,
WEre mine abilities as large as my Will, or could I perform what might chal∣lenge the Applause of all good men; All this from me is a debt to your Merit. What obligati∣ons of duty and thankfulnesse you have laid upon me, I eve∣ry where find: what Acknow∣ledgemenrs
 I shall mak, I am still to seek: but in the want of better, I humbly offer this Treatise of Meeknesse: unworthy (I confesse) your judgment or acceptance: yet doubt not you will give it entertainment for the subjects sake: for in my hear∣ing (from his mouth by whom the Commons of England speak unto the King) Meeknes hath re∣ceiv'd the commendation of an excellent subject, Meekness is a∣nother thing than it is common∣ly taken to be, well known to you, which makes you so emi∣nent in the practice of it.
And your discreet zeal doth speak your courage, no lesse, than your Christian 
 your Wisdome (special qualifi∣cations in a Magistrate): which seconded with your great ex∣perience, and Piety; who more likely (considering the place you sustain) to do God, the King, the Church, and his Countrey bet∣ter service.
Sir, I send forth this Book to you, with the same blessing that Israel sent forth his sons unto Joseph (God Almighty give thee mercy in the sight of the man) the Author and the Work do need the Patronage of a person of note and eminencie, both for Goodness & Power; such an one as your self is: from whom they may receive countenance & pro∣tection.
 In this what I have per∣form'd, I humbly submit to your Grave Censure, being con∣fident you will not deny it a fa∣vourable perusal; in it I com∣plain not of Wrongs, for com∣plaints are not pleasing where they are necessary, my project only is to commend Meekness.
This Treatise of Meekness I have entituled (THE ROYAL ROBE) not only because the Apostle proposes it as a Garment to be put on; and Synesius tells she; Clemency or Meekness is () a vertue meet for a Prince: but also because his sa∣cred Majesty our Soveraigne Lord the King (amongst other
 Princely and Heroick vertues that beautifie his Royal person) hath fulfill'd the Apostles rule, in Putting on Meekness, which as a ROYAL ROBE he wears, and appears conspicuous, illustri∣ous and exemplary in it in the eys of al his people Clemency or Meekness hath in it a majesty as∣wel as sweetness: a Clement Prince is an object for love and won∣der to stand amazed at; unto whom all men (tanquam ad cla∣rum ac beneficum sidus certatim advolant.) The Orator praising Caesar above all commends him for his Clemencie, that his fortune had nothing greater than that he had power, his nature nothing
 better than that he had will to save many; and what greater honor can there be, than to be, what Titus Vespasian is said to be (Deliciae humani Generis) the Darling of the World. And now if the World be compos'd to follow their Rulers (Regis ad exemplum totus componitur or∣bis) and the disposition of our Nation do incline them to Imi∣tation (apt to follow the fashi∣on) there is great hopes that Meekness will come into fashion (being thus commended, by the Apostles Rule; the Kings Ex∣ample; the practice of such Wor∣thies as your self; with the whol∣some lessons of pious Pastors)
 and that such (who were as ra∣vening Wolves scattering the flock, and devouring one ano∣ther: frighting the Shepherds (the Magistrates aswel as Mi∣nisters) from their Charge, wrought upon, and won by these means,) will be convert∣ed, and become new men: will follow after Meekness, and ap∣prove themselves the Lambs of Christs flock, harmlesse, gen∣tle, meek, quiet and peaceable, then shall we live to see good dayes; Jerusalem in prosperity all our life long, and peace up∣on Israel.
And the God of heaven who hath made you honourable, and
 placed you in the eye of the Land, a Patron of learning, a sin. cere friend of Religion, an en∣courager of vertue, encrease in you his graces, direct you in your courses, prosper you in your honorable undertakings, fill you full of dayes and bles∣sings, and at last bring you to his everlasting Kingdom, which is, and shall be the prayer of

August 7. 1660.
