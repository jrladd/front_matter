MY LORD,
YOVR Kind and Generous Ac∣ceptance
of my former Vnder∣takings
(which justly merits my most
Thankful Acknowledgments, which I
here render to Your Lordship) hath encou∣raged
me to make this Offering of ano∣ther
little Treatise, and to request You
to take both it and its worthless Author
into Your Protection. Your Name alone
is a sufficient Amulet against the Cen∣sures
which these Papers may be expo∣sed
to by being made thus Publick.
None will venture to damn that Book

which Your Lordship shall be pleased to
Patronize. I am confident of the Good∣ness
of the Cause which I have Espou∣sed,
but I am as sensible on the other
hand of my great and manifold Defects
in the managing it. However, I en∣tertain
good hopes of finding my Rea∣ders
in some measure favourable to this
Enterprize, when they shall behold Your
Lordship's Name, which is the known
Name of Learning and Piety, prefixed
to it by,
My Lord,
