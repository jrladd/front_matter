YOUR Excellencies having been the Protectors of the Author of these Memoirs during the many Years of his Exile, are justly entituled to whatever Acknowledgment can be made for those Noble Favours, which you extended so seasonably and so constantly to him and his Fellow-Sufferers.

'Tis well known to your Lord∣ships, that the Lieutenant Gene∣ral would have accounted himself happy to lay down that Life for your Service, which you had pre∣served by your Generosity. But since he lived not to have so Glo∣rious an Occasion of expressing his Gratitude, (no Prince, how powerful soever, being hardly e∣nough to attack that Liberty which is so well secured by the Bravery and good Discipline of your own People) nothing now remains to be a Monument of his Duty, and your Bounty, but these Papers; and therefore as a just Debt, they are most humbly presented to your Excellencies.
