FInding of late (in a little Treatise) a great treasure, I thought most fit to present it, to him that would best esteeme of it. If then thou be a good Lapidist, and canst iudge or discerne of a perfect stone; heerin thou hast that Pearle of price, for which the Ieweller ad∣uentureth,
by sea, by land, by fire, by water to attaine.
A wise builder will be sure to lay a good foundation: a va∣liant Souldiour will not be vn∣armed in the daie of battell: neither will a discreet Mari∣ner carelessely respect, how to auoide the perils of a dange∣rous gulfe.
How much more (good Rea∣der) behooueth it thee, wisely to forecast how to turne ouer the leaues of thy life, that thy passage be not stopt, in the way of thy pilgrimage, and thou disappointed of the land of pro∣mise, which pertaineth to such onely as gratiouslie and in due
time doe begin, and constantlie continue vnto the end?
Be not then like to the buil∣ders of Babel, that bring mor∣ter for stones, and stones for clay: but as the wise virgins, did prouidently prouide that their Lampes might bee readie against the comming of the Bridegroome: so thou likewise, see that thy foundation be sure, and thy building raised vp, not with stubble and straw, which will rot and perish, but with lime and stone that is firme and strong, which (though the raine doe beate, and the winds blow,) yet beeing strongly built vpon the Rocke, it shall
stand fast for euer.
If thus thou intend wisely to erect a Tower, turne ouer the leafe, consider this plot, wherein is the frame of a glori∣ous building, not made with mens hands, or such a one as perisheth, but framed by God in a wonderful manner. Here∣in thou shalt see how the foun∣dation is laid, and the Roofe couered: what manner of men they be for whom the holie Ci∣tie is prepared, & vnto whom the glorie thereof is denied: how the way is made plaine vnto it: and by what meanes wee must enter thereinto. Let it not bee lightly regarded of
thee, seeing it is now high time thy worke were begun: Win∣ter is at hand; the windes doe begin to blow: If thou want harbour, the stormy tem∣pests will perish thee. Thus leauing thee to thy la∣bour, and praying for thy good speed, I rest,
