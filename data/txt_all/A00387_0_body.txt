I Sawe and perceued full wel moste honorable Erle / that of some perso∣nes I shold be accused of lewde boldnesse and pre∣sumptyon: yf I wold ta∣ke vpon me / to make any cōmentary or worke vpon the Crede named the Sym¦bole of the Apostels / after so many / and so famouse doctoures of the churche a∣monge whome Cipriane takynge this mater in hande fyrst of any Latyn man hath in suche wyse handeled it: that no man / that euer hathe folowed hym yet vntyll this day / hath ben able to ouerg¦te hym / or to come any thynge nere vn∣to hym. Agayn on the other parte / me thoughte I shold be accused of improby¦e and lewdenesse / yf I wold not fulfylle



and accomplyshe your requeste / namely desyrynge so holy & so vertuose a thyng with a goode and godly affectyon / specy¦ally / seyn that you haue so well accep¦ted & taken in goode worth that my for∣mer seruyce rather than benefyghte do∣ne to you / in expoūdyng and declaryng the .xxii. psalme. And I do knowe also wel enough / that you do not requyre of me / to take this lytle laboure / for your owne cause: whiche do not nede any in∣structyon or informacyō of me. But you do desyre it for other more ignoraunte & vnlerned persones. And therfore I ha∣ue so handeled the thynge / that I haue shaped and ordred al myne oratyon and speche / after suche forme and maner as myght be moste mete and agreynge to the capacyte of those that are symple. Nether do I see or perceyue oy whitte at all / what laude or prayse I shall gete by this my laboure: except it be peraduē¦ture because that I haue spoken certay¦ne thynges somwhat after a playn / and homely perceyueable facyon / how be it as for prayse / I passe not vpon it. But wolde god / that the yonge Soldyers of the Chrystyan cheualry / may take as much frute & profyghte hereof: as bothe



your oste honourable lordeshyppe / of your excellente Charyte and goodnes / doth desyre: and as I also / accordynge to suche lytle power as god hath lente me / haue endeuored my selfe / and geuen dylygence / that they sholde do. In the meane season / our lorde is to be prayed vnto / that he of his bounte & goodnesse yll supply that / where my power doth wante and fayle / & that he / whiche hath inspyred into you this deuoute and god¦ly affectyon towarde his relygyon and ayth / wyll vouchesaffe to sende prospe∣rous lucke & good ende / not in this thyn¦ge onely / but also in all other thynges / whiche of loue and ele toward{is} the ho∣noure of god / and furtheraunce of vert and good Christen lyuynge: you shall enterpryse or begynne: well moughte your honora∣ble lordeshyppe fare yeuen at Friburge / the yere of our lorde 1533
