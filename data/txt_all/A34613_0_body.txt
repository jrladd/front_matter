My Lord,
THe Excellency of this Book answers the greatness of its Au∣thor, and perhaps the badness of the Version is also proportioned to the mean∣ness of the Translator. But the English being for those that could not understand the Original that they also might be instructed by so instructive a Discourse, I hope with them my good intent will excuse my fault; only my fear is,
I shall want a good Plea where∣with to sue out my pardon for ha∣ving intituled a person of the highest honour to so poor a labour as is this of mine. My Lord, these were the inducements which set me upon this attempt, it being the subject of the Book, to clear and assert an important truth, which is as a Criterion whereby to know the Sons of the Church of England from her Adversaries on both hands, those that adore, and those that profane the blessed Sacrament; these that destroy the visible Sign, and those that deny the invisible Grace: I thought I might justly offer it to so pious and so great a Son of this Church, who own'd

I was also perswaded that the Tran∣slation, bearing your illustrious name, would be thereby much re∣commended to many, and so be∣come the more generally useful. And I confided much in your goodness and affability, who being by birth and merits raised to a high eminency, yet doth willingly con∣descend to things and persons of low estate.
My Lord, I have only this one thing more to alledge for my self: That besides the attestation of pub∣lick fame which I hear of a long time speaking loud for you, I
have these many years lived in a Family where your Vertues being particularly known are par∣ticularly admired and honou∣red; so that I could not but have an extraordinary respect and vene∣ration for your Lordship, and be glad to have any occasion to express it. If these cannot clear me I must remain guilty of having taken this opportunity of declaring my self
