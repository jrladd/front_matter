Gentlemen,
I Here present you with some Sermons of my dear Brother deceased, your late (if I may be allowed to say it) wor∣thy and faithfull Pastour; in transcribing them for the Press I have not presumed to make any alteration, or to correct so much as the plain errata's of the original Copy, except onely some few, and those
such as any Reader almost would have observed, and may well be supposed to have been occasioned onely through his haste in writing; and if after all there happen to be any such still remaining in the print, I hope you will blame neither him nor me, since I pretend not to pub∣lish any discourses designed or fitted by him for the Press, but onely those very Sermons which you your selves heard, just as I found them in his notes.
If it be asked why these rather than o∣thers? I answer, these were the Sermons which I found had been preached by him in the most publick places; to which however because they would not alone have made a just volume, I thought it necessary to add two or three more; and I doubt not but you will find them all plain and usefull, and every way fitted to doe good: And if it be asked why no more? I think it will be time enough to
answer that question, when I shall have seen what acceptance these now published meet with in the world.
It was some time before I could per∣suade my self to comply with your de∣sire in publishing these Sermons, because I have sometimes heard my Brother ex∣press an unwillingness that any thing of his should be printed after his death; but when I had once resolved to print them, it took me no time to consider, it was not left to my choice to whom I should present them, seeing you had an un∣doubted title to them; and all the world would have blamed me, if I had not ta∣ken this occasion of acknowledging with all thankfulness your extraordinary re∣spect to his person whilst alive, and to his memory after his decease; one par∣ticular instance of which I must by no means omit, I mean your generous Pre∣sent to his Widow; a kindness which as I
am confident he never expected, even from you, from whom he might have expected any thing that was kind; so I dare say if he could have foreseen it, would have pleased him more than any, nay, than all the other kindnesses he ever received from you.
In the words therefore of Naomi con∣cerning Boaz, Blessed be ye of the Lord, who have not left off your kindness to the living and to the dead.
