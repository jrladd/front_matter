My Lord,
THough the Truth asserted by this little Treatise have but few Friends (amongst whom you deserve to be numbered in the first rank) yet is it able to plead its own cause; for where-ever its absence is, there wants no Arguments to prove the worth of its pre∣sence;

for as the Puritie of the Gospel may be esteemed in the mystical Body of Christ as its life blood; so its Unity may be next esteemed as its health; and strength; and life without health, is but a lingring death; but I am perswaded I need not spend time to beget in you a love to this Truth; you have evidenced the sincerity of your love thereto, and therein I hope have tasted of that fruit of righteousness which is sown in peace of them that make peace, Jam. 3.18.
The reason why Contention and divi∣sion have been more natural to Gods people then union in all ages, is, because it is more naturally suitable to their unregenerate part; therefore those duties and graces that most crosse the lusts of the flesh, must necessarily be attended with most difficulty and opposition; but to bal∣lance that, they are also attended with pro∣portionable inward comfort and peace; and therefore (my Lord) though imposing, op∣pressing principles and spirits do cry out a∣gainst you, as the injurious Israelites did against Moses, Exod. 2.14. yet cease not to plead with them, Ye are Brethren, why do

ye wrong one another; though it may cost you dear at the present, yet consider the Lord that made it up to him, is able to do so to you.
Among the rest of those excellent prin∣ciples the Lord hath born an approving testimony unto in the day of his glorious power, none have been attended with more signal evidences of his presence with, and delight in then this pleaded for. Most disowned instruments that have tendred their service to the Lord in the Work of this Generation, have profest and declared a love to Gods ways and people; but therein have confined their care & affection to a part if not the least spiritual part of them, which the Lord took so unkindly at their hands, that he visibly removed the Tabernacle of his presence from among them, and chose the same people despised and slighted by them, to be the instruments of his praise and glory, in the great work he hath done for his people in these Nations; And easie it is to demonstrate (if it were not too large a discourse for an Epistle) that as those per∣sons so singularly owned by the Lord, have

declined & abated in this principle, so hath the Lord withdrawn from them, and left them to that destraction and miserable confusion they are at this day involved in; as if the Lord should say, if you with∣draw your equal respect and affection from any of my people, I will withdraw mine from you.
And do but well weigh and consider the visible principles, and frame of spirit of such persons, who are vehemently driving on the interest of some part of Gods people (under some peculiar notion they have re∣ceived of the truth or work of the Genera∣tion) in opposition to the rest; (that are not like-minded. And ye may observe a visible inconsistency in their principles and practi∣ces, to the obtaining or securing the very things they pretend for.
That my Lord, it is not onely your praise, but your mercy, that your heart is kept in an even frame towards all the Lords people in this day in which so many emi∣nent Professors are through temptation and stumbling blocks laid in their way by the weakness and frailties of some of the Lords

people, growing weary and faint in their minds, as to the stedfast practice of, and impartial respect to Saints as such; and to be good in bad times, is the best testimony of goodness from a good principle. There∣fore as your discouragements and oppositi∣on encrease, labor to encrease in your con∣fidence and diligence; though you may have War without, you may have Peace within.
And of all dangers be most watchful a∣gainst heart-risings, and alienation of af∣fection towards such who are contrary-minded to you herein; that is the stone many at this day are stumbling on. They measure out their respect and affection to Saints proportionably to that respect and affection they or their principles receive from them, whereas the cheif excellency of this principle above others lieth in this dif∣ference, that it can extend respect to others upon the account of duty to Christ, though disrespect on the account of different opini∣on be returned to them again; for uniting principles must be attended with the ex∣ercise of uniting Graces, if they intend to be successful in uniting work.
That the Lord may guide you in all your streights, support you under all your burthens, and render into your bosom plentiful returns of all that kindness you have shewn unto, and weaknesses you have over-looked in his people, for his Image sake upon them, is the earnest prayer of the most unworthy of
