May it please your Highness,
I Presume to offer your victorious hands this Fragment and minute Portion of Time, from the encou∣ragement of that Axiome, That by Moments Approaches are made to Eternity, to which the Duration of your Glory is most adaequate and Commensurate.
I am most humbly conscious that this Historiola, this piece of a Chronicle, is a most incompetent and incon∣gruous Present to Your Highness; and of all the meanest and vilest that ever obtruded or excused themselves to Princes, the most unpardonable. But such is the Fate of this way of writing, and upon this Subject, that whoso∣ever shall dare to increase our Annals, must either injure your Greatness by intitling you to his Endeavour, or else disoblige his Nation, who owe and own their Laws, which is more than their History, to your Prudence and Puissance.
Besides (Great Sir) the Genius that walkt and wan∣dred in the contexture and account of this War, like the Ghost of murdered persons, never left importuning and urging me to address its groans to you, the Vindex and A∣venger of that blood, which hath been so barbarously and

unnaturally spilt. Your Highnesses blessed Conduct traced and overtook the guilt of the late Sanguinary times, and Expiated those dire Effusions. You have reconciled our Review to those abhorrences, and with innocence given us the Representation of the Impiety of the late Age: You have given Form and Beauty to the Chaos of our Confu∣sions, made the lineaments thereof in its derivation to Posterity lovely and amiable: from a ghastly and mangled Spectacle, not to be owned or known by our selves, you have perfected and concinnated it to its proportions; and from a Medly of our Distractions, brought forth a Beauti∣ful Rationale We doubt not to evince to your Ma∣jesty, that his Excellency and the Ar∣my under his Command, &c. have complied with the O∣bligations for which they were raised; The Preservation of the Pro∣testant Reli∣gion, the ho∣nour and happiness of the King, the Priviledges of Parlia∣ment, the Li∣berty and Propriety of the Subject, and the Fun∣damental Laws of the Land. Vide Declaration of the Ar∣my, May 1660.. And now under that your Highnesses Signature, this little Chronicle is ambitious to pass, and to commend it self to the world.
I would not be guilty of so much vanity, as to pretend in this Address any respect or regard to your Renown and Fame, raised beyond the reach of our most exalted praises, as being the same with the Miracles your High∣ness hath instrumented: the highest Transcendencies of Language do with advantage disappear into silent Exta∣sies, and our Raptures convert into the Forms of Blessing, and lose themselves in Adoration. Besides, the Oracle, the Wisdome of the Kingdome in Parliament, hath engros∣sed all the utterance of Gratitude, in their publick Ac∣knowledgments, transcribed into the sacred Records and Rolls of that supream Court.
So Heaven was pleased not onely to sum up the ver∣tues and felicities of all the Generals in our Civil Wars, integrating and accomplishing the Loyalty, Conduct, Cou∣rage, Success, Renown and Triumphs, contra-opposed and divided among them, in your Heroical person, making you the Compleat Compendium, as well as the absolute Con∣clusion of the menage thereof (which to your Honour and Memory shall be eternally celebrated,) but also to center the general hope and confidence in your single Vertue, to unite, or at least cement and amuse different Parties and Perswasions to an acquiescence in your Resolutions and Designe, and then at last to Crown them with universal Satisfaction, Content, and Delight; the three Nations be∣ing inspired with One voice, and gratulatory Shout, at your Redemption of us from Slavery.
But while I please my self and the Reader with the memory of that ravishing Kindness, I forget I do displease your Highness with this rude and tedious Boldness, which I would religiously avoid. May you graciously be pleased to vouchsafe a Reception of this Essay to the honour of the Times you have made, wherein Truth hath recover∣ed her Reputation, and dare maintain it, (and it is the onely justifiable part of the ensuing Work, as far as Hu∣mane Frailty may be indulged;) while I doubt not but mine (and the General) Prayers to Heaven shall be ac∣cepted for Your and your Posterities long Temporal, and endless Eternal Felicities.
