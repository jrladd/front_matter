MY LORD,
THE Encouragement
the City-Trade and
Forein Discoveries is
like to find under
Your Lordship's Ma∣gistracy,
ought to be
the chief Encourage∣ment
of any Publick-spirited
Person to
render unto You all due Acknowledgments
and Testimonies of Honour in this kind.
The City of LONDON is doubtless the
Head and Promotress of all English Trade,

and Your Lordship is the designed Head
and Representative of the City: That Obli∣gation
Forein Traffique hath to London, Lon∣don
oweth partly to the wise Councils and
Government of its Chief Magistrate, and
it scarce ever had any, of whose Prudence
Courage, and Moderation, it ought to con∣ceive
greater hopes than of Your Lord∣ship's.
Hard Weather needs Resolute Pi∣lots,
and Good Magistrates are ordinarily
sent by God against bad Times: And far be
it from us that we should make Times
worse than they are. But as it hath been
my bad more than my good Fortune to be
some years ago the first Avant Courier,
who from the Enemies Camp brought the
Tidings of these Hellish Attempts, that now
cause our Domestic Troubles; so I in this
Book present to Your Lordship, and all Eng∣land,
an unavoidable and impartial Argu∣ment,
to shew that our Fears from Jesuitical
Practices are much less magnified, than
they are by them beyond measure extenua∣ted,
by a new Popish Device of Creating
Security: For herein Your Lordship may
see what the Jesuits are, where ever they get
Footing and Credit, in the furthest part of
Japon, as well as in Venice, Paris, Ireland, and
England.
Coelum non Animum mutant, cùm trans mare currunt.
You shall observe (I say) how these Igna∣tians
Covetousness and State-undermining,

brought the greatest Rebellion, Bloudshed,
and Massacre upon about 60000 Christians
at one blow, that ever was seen in those Ea∣stern
Parts of the World; and how thereby
some Hundred Thousands in after Persecu∣tions
were destroyed; may, and the whole
Christian Name quite extirpated (in hatred
of their Practices) by Heathen Monarchs,
who could not think their Heads, Crowns,
nor Estates, to be otherwise safe from the Fa∣ctious
Disciples of this Loyola. Yet all theirs,
and their secret Factors Devices, will (I
hope) come to nought, if we follow those
moderate, peaceable, and judicious Coun∣sels,
Your Lordship's Eloquent Speech hath
set out unto us; begetting a sober and
hearty Harmony 'twixt Prince and People.
If the Ship be kept in good order within,
there's little to be fear'd from Storms with∣out.
I remark, That it depended much
on the Tribunus Plebis, or Lord Mayor of the
old Rome, (most like to our London in Policy
and Magistracy) to keep it and the whole
Government in an even temper, and to
maintain a Lovely Correspondency be∣twixt
the Senat and the People; and it was
by him that the Enemies or Friends of the
Commonwealth ordinarily wrought their
ends of Peace or Disturbance. Therefore
as Your Lordship hath always appeared, as
well in your Actions as in your Words, a
Sincere and Brave-spirited Patriot, a Mode∣rate
and Reconciling Subject, it is not to be

doubted but that Your Lordship will give
that Satisfaction to the Court, City, and
Country, and even to all Forein Traffiquers
themselves, that is justly expected and con∣ceived
of you. So that Quiet, Peace, Trade,
and Forein Discoveries, being encouraged
and promoted in your Times, your Name
shall be not onely respected and honoured
among your Countreymen, but also in
those remotest parts of the World, where
this small Work (most necessary for all
East India Merchants and Travellers) will
sound it out, and testifie with all the due
Respects and Obligations on the Public
Accompt of,
