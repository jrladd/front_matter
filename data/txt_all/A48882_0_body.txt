MY LORD,
THE Papers I here present your Lordship, are in Substance the same with one which I delivered to you, in Obedi∣ence to the Commands I received by your Lordship, from their Excellen∣cies, the Lords Justices; and with

another, which I writ in Answer to some Questions your Lordship was pleased to propose to me concerning our Coin. The Approbation your Lordship was pleased to give them then, has been an Encouragement to me, to revise them now, and put them in an Order; fitter to comply with their Desires, who will needs have me print something at this time, on this Subject: And could any thing of this Nature be received with Indif∣ferency in this Age; the Allowance they have had from your Lordship, whose great and clear Judgment is, with general Consent and Applause, acknowledged to be the just Measure of Right and Wrong amongst us, might make me hope that they might pass in the World without any great Dislike.
However, since your Lordship thought they might be of use to clear some Difficulties, and rectifie some wrong Notions that are taken up about Money, I have ventured them into the World, desiring no Mercy to

any erroneous Positions or wrong Reasonings, which shall be found in them. I shall never knowingly be of any, but Truths and my Countrey's side; the former I shall always gladly imbrace and own, whoever shews it me: And in these Papers, I am sure, I have no other Aim, but to do what little I can, for the Service of my Country. Your Lordship's so evident∣ly preferring that to all other Conside∣rations, does, in the Eyes of all Men, sit so well upon you, that my Ambi∣tion will not be blamed; if I in this, propose to my self so great an Exam∣ple; and in my little sphere am mo∣ved by the same Principle.
I have a long time foreseen the Mis∣chief and Ruine coming upon us by clipp'd Money, if it were not timely stopp'd: And had Concern enough for the Publick, to make me print some Thoughts touching our Coin some Years since. The Principles I there went on, I see no reason to al∣ter: They have, if I mistake not, their Foundation in Nature, and will

stand: They have their Foundation in Nature, and are clear; and will be so, in all the Train of their Conse∣quences throughout this whole (as it is thought) mysterious Business of Money, to all those, who will but be at the easie Trouble of stripping this Subject of hard, obscure and doubtful Words, wherewith Men are often mislead and mislead others. And now the Disorder is come to Extremi∣ty, and can no longer be plaid with, I wish it may find a suddain and effectu∣al Cure; not a Remedy in Sound and Appearance, which may flatter us on to Ruine in the Continuation of a growing Mischief, that calls for pre∣sent Help.
I wish too, that the Remedy may be as easie as possible; and that the Cure of this Evil be not ordered so as to lay a great Part of the Burden une∣qually on those, who have had no particular Hand in it. Westminster-Hall is so great a Witness of your Lordship's unbiassed Justice, and stea∣dy Care to preserve to every one their

Right; that the World will not wonder you should not be for such a lessening our Coin, as will, without any Reason, deprive great Numbers of blameless Men of a Fifth Part of their Estates, beyond the Relief of Chancery. I hope this Age will scape so great a Blemish. I doubt not but there are many, who, for the Service of their Countrey, and for the Sup∣port of the Government, would glad∣ly part with, not only one Fifth, but a much larger Portion of their Estates. But when it shall be taken from them, only to be bestowed on Men in their, and the common Opinion, no better deserving of their Countrey than themselves, unless growing exceed∣ingly rich by the publick Necessities, whilst every body else finds his For∣tune streightned by them, be a pub∣lick Merit, that deserves a publick and signal Reward, this Loss, of one Fifth of their Debts and Income, will sit heavy on them, who shall feel it without the Alleviation of any Profit or Credit, that will thereby accrue to

the Nation, by such a lessening of our Coin.
If any one ask, how I, a retired private Man, come at this time to meddle with Money and Trade: For they are inseparable; I reply, that your Lorship, and the other great Men that put me upon it, are an∣swerable for it: Whether what I say be to the purpose or no, that I my self am answerable for. This I can answer to all the World, that I have not said any thing here, without a full Perswasion of its Truth; nor with any other Motive or Purpose than the clearing of this artificially perplexed, rather in it self mysterious Subject, as far as my poor Talent reaches. That which perhaps I shall not be so well able to answer, to your Lordship and my self, is the Liberty I have taken, in such an Address as this, to profess that I am,
MY LORD,
