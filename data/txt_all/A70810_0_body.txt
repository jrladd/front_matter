Madam,
DID not some of the brightest and best our Sex can boast
of Incourage Attempts of this kind, the snarling Cynicks might prevail and
cry down a diversi∣on, which they themselves participate, though their ill
Nature makes them grumble at their Entertainment, but when they shall see
this Glorious name in the Front, when they shall know a Lady belov'd by
Heaven and Earth, Mistress of all Per∣fections, the bounteous Powers give,
or human nature is Capa∣ble to receive: when, I say they understand you
protect, and like Innocent Plays, they must Acquiesce and be forc't to own
so much goodness, cannot choose amiss. Queen Catharine, who
tasted the Vicissitudes of Fate, will now forget her sufferings, and
under such a Noble Patroness remain fixt in lasting Glory; and if my weak
Pen has fail'd in the Character of that Great Princess: now I've made her an
ample recompense, for where cou'd I have found a Lady of a more illustrious
descent, or more Celebrated for her Ver∣tues? The name of Cary
Graces all our English Chronicles and is adorn'd with the greatest
Honours; yet that Noble stock did ne'er produce a lovelier branch than your
fair self, and as if Hea∣ven Correspondent to our wishes, design'd you
its peculiar bles∣sings, you are given to a Gentleman, of whom we may
venture to say, he merits even you? Oh! may you appear many, many
suc∣ceeding years, the bright Examples of Conjugal Affection, and shame
that bare-fac'd Vice out of Countenance, which breaks the Marriage Vows without
a blush: May you still remain blest in each other, pleas'd to see your
Beauties and your Vertues renew∣ed in your Charming Race, whilst the admiring
World shall wonder at your happiness, and reform in hopes to obtain some
of those blessings. May every thing contribute to your continual
satisfaction, and amongst your more solid Joys, give me leave, 
 Madam, to hope this trifle may find a vacant hour, when you will
deign to peruse it, and be so good to forgive the Authors pre∣sumption in
laying it at your feet.
I cou'd not, without a plain Contradiction to the History,
punish the Instruments that mademy Lovers unhappy; but I know your
Ladyship will trace Richard the Third into Bosworth
Field, and find him there, as wretched as he made Queen Catharine.
I dare not add more, knowing how unworthy all I have said, or
can say, is of you; therefore shall only reiterate my Prayers for your
lasting Happiness, and beg to subscribe my self,
Madam,
