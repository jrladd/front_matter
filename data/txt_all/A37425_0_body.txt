Madam,
THE Character you bear every where of an extraordinary Lady, has

brought this unhappy Mendi∣cant a great many doleful Miles to throw himself at your Feet; `Tis true, be∣tween New-Castle and London, I presume, he might have some few Friends that would have taken him in and refresht him, but then Madam, he had still wanted some body to have sign`d his Pass, in or∣der to make his Progress, thro` a stubborn Inhospitable World, a little more safe and easy.
This indeed it is, that has brought him into the North,

to your Ladyship, and tho he comes a stranger, unre∣commended, and with all the disadvantages that may be; yet still the sence he has of your Ladyships Univer∣sal Charity, encourages him to believe you will at least examine his Credentials, be∣fore you order him to be turn`d out of your Gate.
`Tis true Madam, he has no great matters to pretend, to bespeak your Compassi∣on, only a little Artless Mo∣desty and Innocence; and both those Two are so un∣happily

sullied, by this last Insolence, that if your La∣dyships Goodness does not exert it self beyond the com∣mon Degree, he can expect little less than to be treated like a Sturdy Vagrant, and so whipt and sent back into his own Countrey.
But let the Success be what it will, the poor Wanderer is under a Necessity once more to take a melancholy Turn into the World: How far your Ladyship may be obli∣ged to protect him, the Sequel of his Narrative must declare.

As for my part, what I have done, is by his Direction, and truly I have the same Notion of it that he had, that your Vertue, Piety and Charity, that have render'd you for ma∣ny Years the Ornament of your Sex, will all plead strongly for your acceptance of these few unworthy sheets, and engage you too to par∣don him that has ventur`d to commend `em to your Pro∣tection, who is with the most profound respect,
Good Madam,
