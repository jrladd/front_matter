May it please Your Lordship,
IN this following Text (of all other Verses in the Bible) is found the fairest Character of a Valiant Captain with a divine Mind, a brave Courage in a Heavenly Soul, a great and a good Heart, (a most auspicious Conjunction of Vertue and Valour.)
If Vertue and Valour be not one and the same thing, yet they are so near of Kin, that the Latins have but one word to express both; at least, they are reciprocal: No man is truly virtuous that is not truly valorous; no man is truly valo∣rous that is not truly virtuous: For which cause Fortitude or Valour is accounted one of the four Cardinal Virtues.

 To promote Virtue, and consequently Valour, in our Armies and Navies, (whereof these Three Kingdoms never had more need) I have, with an humble Heart, lent my helping Hand from the Press, to whom it could not be very audible from my low Pulpit.
And the Guard of His Majesty's Sacred Per∣son (the Darling of Heaven as well as of Man∣kind) being more peculiarly your Honourable Pro∣vince, (in this his so famous and necessary Expe∣dition) invites as well as encourages me to the de∣dication of this Sermon to Your Lordship, which (I may without Ostentation say) is so useful to all Men (against the Fears of Death (the King of Terrours) but especially, in this juncture, seaso∣nable and suitable for the Souldiery, (if they will find time to read it) and upon such a Text, as per∣haps was never handled before in this method by any man, except by
(My Lord)
