MADAME,
IT was the saying of a KING,PROV. 18 16. a mans gift maketh roome for him before the great; If there were no other way but by gifts, I should come behind and not before, how ever it be, as S. Peter said to the creeple at the Temple gate called Beatifull, Such as I have I give, yea;Act. 3.6 and that with a willing minde.

In dayes of mourning, we must t forget our spirituall mirth; Chri precept is that we rejoice ever more Women more then men are incline to singing,1 THES. 5.16. as daylie practise dot shew; when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, it is said, that the women came out o all the cities of Israel singing,1 SAM. 18.7. Sa hath slaine his thousands, and Da¦vid his ten thousands; no mention is made of men singers.
If your Highnesse desire spirituall recreations in hly songs, I have heere tuned the Song of Songs in the first place, and not without reason,  being so called by excellencie: Ʋn it are subjoined the other cheefe songs contained in the Old and New Testa∣ment, as they ly in order: The Apostle S. James hath given this precept,JAM. 5.13. COL. 3.16. I any merry? Let him sing; S. Pau ordaines that we sing with grace i our hearts to the Lord; In anothe place, he willeth that we be filled wit
 the spirit, and that wee speake to our selves in Psalmes, and Hymnes,EPHES. 5.19. and Spirituall Songs, makeing me∣lodie in our heart to the Lord.
The Lord grant your Highnesse such happinesse, that yee may have many joyfull dayes to awake your glory, that yee may chearfully sing the praises of the LORD.

From Glasgow the 20 of March, 1645.
