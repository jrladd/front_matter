My Beloved;
MY Spirit rejoyceth in the Lord, who hath put such an opportunitie as this into my hand, of Publishing to you, and to others, (and hereby of Advancing,) The Exceeding Riches of the Grace of God, in such a Pattern thereof, as here followeth: The Daughter of a gracious Matrone, of mine acquaintance in the Parish where I weekly Preach in London: who was in as hopeles and de∣sperate a condition in her selfe, as ever was any. Now often admiring, and uttering to others, espe∣cially to afflicted, despairing, mournfull soules, (that resort now to her,) the unsearchable Trea∣sures of Grace, to the ungodly, and chiefest of lost, un∣done sinners. The main Causes urging me to Pub∣lish it to you, and the Contents thereof, are in the Books beginning: The severall Vses are in the End. You know that the works of Iehovah are great, ho∣norable, wonderfull, and glorious; and are greatly to be magnified; sought out of all them that have plea∣sure therein: He makes them to be remembered. (Ps. 111.

2, 3, 4.) Especially his works ofPsal. 145. 9.  tender-Mercies, which are over (andPsal. 145. 9.  upon) all his works. How desireable is it to one, and to the friends of one, that is in great extremity of misery, bodily, or spirituall; to hear of another, that was just in the same condition, that now is cured? How much longed for, is a safe Harbour, to a weather-beaten Ship, tossed with Tempests? (Isa. 54. 11.) How refreshful is rest and ease, to a tempted, hur∣ried, wearied soule? (Iob 7.2-4.) How joyfull and beautifull is theRom. 10. 15. glad tydings of the Gospel of Peace, of riches of Grace, of the perfect2 Cor. 5. 21. righteousnesse of Christ, for the1 Tim. 1.13-15. chiefe of sinners,Eph. 2.15.16.3. enemies, mur∣murers, ungodly ones? to souls wearied out in looking on themselves, and their sins, and desperate wickednesse of their own hearts; and that gladly would mend all, and patch up a righteous∣nesse in themselves, or partly there: (Rom. 10.3.) that would first finde a thorough change in them, such a dying of sin, and holy walking; before they think they may beleeve that Christ dyed for such as theyRom. 5. 7, 8. 10.; or justifies such ungodlyRom. 4.5. ones; How mighty (through2 Cor. 10. 4 God) may it be, to support poor soules, that are perswa∣ded they are reprobatesLam. 3.8-17-22.40., that are assured of it upon certain grounds, (as they judge;) and that they are damn'dIo. 3.17.22., and in Hell already; that never any in their case was, or can be saved1 Cor. 6.9-11.;

that the sins of Manasses, of David, of Peter, of Paul, of Mary Magdalen, yea, and of Cain, Iu∣das, and Pilate, are all lesse then their sins, & blas∣phemies; and if all they might be saved, yet them∣selves should surely be damn'd: for such to hear of one, that but lately was in the very same conditi∣on; now sounding forth, and wondring at, the Ex∣ceeding Riches of Grace to her, the chiefest of sinners, (Psal. 35.10.) to hear her selfe telling such despai∣ring soules; You cannot be more desperate, or more cer∣tain of hell and wrath, then I lately was: and comfor∣ting them, by the same consolations, wherewith her own soul is now comforted in the Lord. (2 Cor. 1.4.) This, all this, you have here held forth, in this Pattern of Gods patience, and abundant goodness towards this his unworthy Handmaid, whose low & base estate he hath regarded: He causing LIGHT to shine out of DARKNES, (2 Cor. 4.6.) The wri∣ting, transcribing, and often perusing hereof, hath been, and is sweet and precious to me, I must con∣fesse: I with your reading it may be so, and much more, to your soules.
As you reade, Consider; Admire the LORD in his surpassing Grace to ungodly ones. (Mic. 7.18.) Do not so commend the party, that is but an Earthen vessel, born in sin,Psal. 51.5. as youEph. 2.1-3: are: but still, all along exalt and commend the LORD, who alone is to be exalted, (Isa. 2.11. 1 Cor. 1.29, 30, 31.) Who puts his treasure into an Earthen vessel of purpose, that the excellency of the power may be of God,

and not of flesh. (2 Cor. 4. 7.) Be the more vile in your own eyes, when you see, God is pacified towards you, for all that you have done, (Ezek. 16. 63.) And from beleeving his love to your soules; in love stu∣dy what you should render to him, in Christs Name, (Psal. 116.12. Col. 3.17.) Praise the Lord for lea∣ving such Patterns of his Riches of Grace, [as that of Mris Drake Revived, and that of Gods gracious thoughts, towards great sinners, (by Dr Homes;) in a late Book, so called; so] especially this: And Pray for her, [if the Lord shall restore her body, which as yet is weak, to eat at all, or to drink but very little, (of faire water, or small Beere, and that onely at once in two, or three, or foure dayes:) and by her daily spending that small strength shee hath, by often uttering forth the treasures of Grace, and by oft speaking to comfort despairing soules: seven or moe whereof have re∣sorted to her:] that shee may walke humbly, rendring againe in her measure, according to the benefit done unto her. [Since the former was fitted for the Presse, shee then not being likely to live, unlesse the Lord should work a Miracle: He rai∣sed her wonderfully, by faith in his Sonne, with∣out any meanes, (when shee could use none;) and that by two degrees: First, to EATE, and to ARISE, (Iun. 11. 1647.) Then (on Midsum∣mer day,) to WALK; as both follow, neer the end of the Book, Pag. 133. to 143.] And Pray for despairing soules, (here now being many of them)

and for the more exalting of Jesus Christ, in the powring out of his Spirit upon his sonnes and daughters that beleeve, by stretching out his hand to heale, (soules and bodies:) and that Signes and wonders may be done in his Name; As the Disciples prayed, Act. 4. 29. as he hath promi∣sed, Iob. 7. 38, 39.
