SIR,
WHen my reason is made known, I hope my presumption in dedicating these poore lines to your worthy selfe will appeare more pardonable: I wrote, not out of an ambitious thought of in∣structing the profoundest iudgements, but only to satisfie them, that for want of knowledge, lay scandalous imputations, not only upon that honourable House of Parliament in generall whereof you are a member, but especially and in particular upon your upright selfe; for my owne part, I am the least mem∣ber of this distracted Kingdome, but have as good a right to the benefit of those lawes this happie Parliament hath enacted as the greatest, and therefore am bound by way of thankefulnesse to vindicate their iust intents and actions, against the opprobrious language of malignant Spirits: to the doing of which, this is my weake but harty endeavour if you please to give it patronage it may deserve the presse, therefore let your acceptance adde courage to the future imployments of him, who is both to your selfe and to his country.
