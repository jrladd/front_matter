RIght Honourable: it
is a labor that hath
neyther recom∣pence
nor thanks,
to tell them their
madnesse, that faine would thinke
themselues sober. Hauing there∣fore
presumed (not to trouble
the peace, but) to disquiet the se∣curity
of our Israel: I durst not but
aspire to some noble Patronage,
that might shield both my selfe

and labours, from the blowes of
all maleuolent Censurers. In
which thoughts, I was bolde to
center my selfe in your Honour;
as the indiuiduall point of my
refuge, wherein I haue beene
taught the way by more worthy
precedents: your Honourable
Name hauing long stoode, as a
communis terminus, or Sanctuary of
protection, to the labours and
persons of many Students. The
vn-erring hand of God hath
placed your Lordship in the Seate
of Iustice, and Chaire of Honour,
(especially if it be true, what S.
Hieron: sayes, that Sūma apud Deū
nobilitas, clarū essevirtutibus: wher∣by
you haue power & oportu∣nity,
to whet the edge of vertue
with encouragements, & to giue

vice the iust retribution of deser∣ued
punishments. Happy influ∣ences
haue beene deriued from
you, sitting as a Star in the Star-Chamber:
conscionable mitigati∣ons
of the Lawes rigour in the
Court of Chancery. To punish whē
you see cause, is not more Iustice
then Mercy: Iustice against the
offender, Mercy to the Common∣wealth.
Those punishments are
no other then actual Physick mi∣nistred
to the Inheritance, Liberty,
Body, to the bettring of the Con∣science,1. Cor. 5. 5.
and sauing of the soule in the
day of the Lord Iesus. Behold, my
pen hath but writtē after the ori∣ginall
Copy of your Honors acti∣ons:
desiring rather to learne by
your doings, how to say; then to
teach you by my sayings, how to

do. I haue spoken (God knowes
with what successe) to these mad
times: and he that would bind the
franticke, though hee loues him,
angers him. The detector of mens
much-loued sins, needs a Protec∣tor,
that is both good & great. I am
sure my eleciō is happy; if it shal
please your Honor to cast the eye
of acceptance on my weake la∣bors.
A yong plant may thriue,
if the Sunne shall warme it with
his beames. That Sunne of righte∣ousnes,
that hath sauing health vn∣der
his wings, shine for euer on
your Lordship,Mal. 4. 2. who hath been so
liberal a fauorer to his Church, &
among the rest to his vnworthi∣est
seruant, and
