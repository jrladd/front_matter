KNowing (right re∣ligious gentlemā) that Idlenes is as like the mother of goodnes, as igno∣raunce is to the mother of deuo∣tion, and hauing no meeter matter whereon to meditate then howe I should bestow my study, nor fitter op¦portunitie wherein to exercise my ta∣lent, I durst not laie it vp in a napkin, for I know that my Lord will haue his owne with aduantage: I haue so neere as I could among many fieldes made

choise of good grounde, for there is hope of fruite, that he which soweth and hee that reapeth may reioice to∣gether: may it stand with your good liking to accept of my poore paines, indited to suppresse Idlenesse, and presented to your selfe in signe of good will, &c.
