YOur Countryman Mouffet, a notable ornament to the company of Physicians, a man of the more polite and solid learning, and well experienced in most Sciences, had formerly entituled this work of Insects to the ever famous Elizabeth, (who was wise above her Sex, valiant, born to reign well, and ruled so many years by the Votes of her Subjects, and by her own un∣dertakings and actions, that were so successeful that they were envied at) it was be∣gun by others, but augmented by him, polished, and as it now comes forth exactly per∣fected, and he thought it no indignity to Dedicate to the greatest Princess the mi∣racles of Nature, which are most conspicuous in the smallest things; which testifie the infinite power of the supreme Creator of all things, and raise the mindes of Prin∣ces who are the children of the most Highest, to the cause of all causes, that they may in all places acknowledge the presence of the Deity, and his bountiful hand in his sin∣gular direction in respect of them, and his influence that acts by election, and may adore him with an humble, as with a grateful minde; so weighing by reason the de∣grees of proportion, that he is most obliged who hath received most. The Author before he could accomplish this purpose, died; he was worthy to have lived longer for the advantage of Art and Learning. Thus the Book was left after his death to his Heir, who had a smaller estate than suited with the name of his Father, or his merit re∣quired, and his many watchings and labours sustained for the publick good, in curing of the sick, justly deserved. Fortune is blinde and will hardly favour those that are the best but against her will, as if it were disagreeing and dissonant that there should be any commerce between Pluto with Apollo, Minerva and Mercury. Elizabeth being departed this life, and James then holding the reins of the British Empire piously and justly, and ruling peaceably amongst the storms that at that time shook all Europe, ha∣ving weeded out by his Majestick Scepter, and by the providence of his soul which was prudent even to miracle, all Monsters, which endevoured to shake the foundati∣ons of the Kingdome by Treason, Deceit, Wickedness, Lust, and Wrath. The Over∣ers of this Orphan left in a very poor condition, were resolved to Dedicate this lear∣ned Work to this Noble Heros, who was no less famous for his Learning than for a concourse of all Virtues that met in him: but great poverty at home, delayed the business, and hindred this windy intention from taking effect, and the off-spring from coming to the light. So the Book lay for a long time in obscurity under the custody of the friends of the Author departed, until such time as it was offered to me by Dar∣nellus, who was formerly his Apothecary, and a very honest man, who wished well to his Master being dead, and was very desirous of his glory; so it lay for some years in my Study cast aside in the dust among Worms and Moths; truly it was no fault of mine, but of the Printers who were so greedy of Money, that though in many Coun∣treys I invited them by my Letters, and did solicit them to receive the Orphan, yet they refused (as they said) to take upon them an unthankful business; they were not pleased with the benefit of a noble Art, unless it would pay more than the fraight. O the times wherein the pains of learned men are valued at the price the work will be sold for, and the money that must be laid out for ink and paper, or by the depraved opinion of the vulgar (who commonly applaud what is worst) and not by the essence of the thing it self, or dignity of the subject, or the solid explanation of the same! Then tere was an Epistle prefixed to the beginning which men call Dedicatory, which being it was to carry the name before it of one of the foresaid Princes, the Edition seemed to come forth unseasonably after they were both dead. Perchance some other man would have cacht at this occasion, to have brought it to King Charles, the great Son of a great Fa∣ther,under whose fortunate reign in his Kingly person, all Kingly virtues run toge∣ther in troops, each striving to have the upper hand) and kneeling down before his Majesty, would have offered unto him, in hopes of a reward, another mans Works vail'd with a false cover of commendations, or obscured with the great smoke of courtly eloquence. But I have no such genius, for though I have not lived hitherto unwelcome to Princes, yet I have learned by long practise, that we must use their fa∣vour soberly, and never to abuse their ears or eyes, and though you do know easie en∣trance and fit times to come into their presence, yet importunity is alwaies unseasonable, and especially that which hires mercenary Muses for money to set them forth, which are branded with marks of infamy. Do not think that I detract so much from this Work that I think it not worthy to carry the name of a King in the Frontispice, and might live in publick under the protection of so ambitious an Inscription; but I held it no less than sacriledge to name the childe in stead of another of my own accord, or to bring a deaf person upon the stage, as to what concerns the exposition of the Argument, and with other birds feathers in the very entrance of the work foolishly and vainly to pride my self: yet that the Book might come forth every way compleat, and that the Reader who is a lover of the custome may not desire an Epistle, or complain that there is one wanting, ac∣cording to my manner (wherewith I honour great men with the honour that belongs un∣to them, but my friend I respect above all, and that continually) I would prefix to this Natural and Physical History the famous name of some man, who by the common con∣sent of the Learned, is well acquainted with both, and who is joyned unto me by no ordi∣nary alliance, who is dear to all good men, and eminent for his own endowments; which office of Reverence and good will may testifie to posterity, in what esteem such men are with me, who are intrinsecally furnished with the real tincture of manifold learning, but chiefly with that of the most noble Art of all, which I practise: so I have made choice of thee alone amongst many, that thou mayst be to me in stead of them all, Noble Man, my dearest friend Paddy, who art Knighted by the wisest Monarch James, who never did any thing vainly, who adornest thy Virtues by thy Titles, and thy Titles by thy Vir∣tues, as our Thorius hath written of thee. Thou art he who after the wicked Patricide of Great Henry, formerly my most milde Master (which shall for ever convey the said memory of his age to posterity) when I was called by the most Serene James from the French Court by his own Letters, and by a guide appointed to conduct me into Britain, and was immediately honoured with the title of Companion of the chief Physicians, didst not look upon me with bleer and swoln eyes, with the viperous venome of envy; but thou didst entertain me, being a stranger, candidly, and with a cheerful countenance, (as it becomes one of noble Birth)▪ contrary to that of Horace, who accuseth the Britains divided almost from all the world, of fierceness toward strangers. After that, in the ma∣ny meetings we had amongst sick people, and in my practise in Physick, when I plea∣singly hearkned to the opinions of those that consulted, weighed them, and as it be∣longed to my place, concluded what was to be done, thou didst hear me without braw∣ling or contradiction, which is the imbred evil custome of some unworthy Physicians; and thou didst very often approve of my opinion, as consonant to reason. In the fa∣mous Colledge of London, (where as thou wert alwaies most worthy, so thou wert of∣ten President) when I was by the votes of the chiefest, and first of all by thy suffrage made a Colleague, according to the Kings Character for my place at Court, thou didst willingly suffer me to have the next place to our President: I farther add, that thou didst never oppose thy self to the many petitions or commendations that were offered by me to our most excellent Colleagues; but thou didst alwaies afford me thy ear to hear me, and thy hands to help me. Lastly thou didst alwaies praise me being absent, and as far as it was in thy power, of thy own accord, from the imbred motion of thy noble minde, thou didst defend my good name privately wounded by the calumnies of envious men, and torn by malice, (which is the condition of good, and of the greatest Princes) by that authority which thou hast amongst thy own Countreymen of what condition soe∣ver, and thou wouldst not suffer this scab of backbiting to proceed any farther. O most excellent Man! what shall I repay unto thee, who as a true Philosopher, hast no desire of vain glory, and such things as make a great shew and are vulgarly praised, sought for, and desired by other men, are now esteemed base with thee? My grateful minde, and most full of love towards thee, commands me to offer this small token to thee in testi∣monythereof, which accept freely and willingly, and suffer that by this sincere gift, that wicked saying may be disanulled, that men of one profession cannot endure one the other. God the best and the greatest hath granted unto thee long life, by a prosperous aspect of the Stars, for the good of thy Citizens, whose health thou hast preserved and restored by thy care for very many years effectually hitherto, that posterity must justly acknowledge that thou hast lived long, worthy not only of a Garland of oak, but a Statue of gold also, (if our times would afford such honour). Now thou well deserving Captain, dischar∣ged by age, thou Champion freed by reason of years with a token of honour, thou con∣queror of monsters, that daily spring up with too fruitful an increase for the destruction of mankinde, dwellest with thy self, thy soul yet sustaining thy dry body yeelding to wasting time by degrees very easily, which being defiled with no conditions of her prison, sees the Hav, and is almost come into it; thy minde being abstracted from the sad vexations of humane life: and what time thou hast to spare from divine Medi∣tations, penetrating into all Nature, and the secrets of things, thou dost expatiate into the pleasant green Gardens of various natural Philosophy. Behold here is a most exquisite Garland for thee gathered out of the most secret Orchard of our great Parent, which will not only feed the eyes, but will lead the singular acuteness of thy wit, which thou aboun∣dest with into her most hidden places. Thou being an excellent Anatomist, I beseech thee try if thou canst dissect Insects; the great Stagyrite being thy guide, who did not disdain to search into the parts of Animals. Thou shalt finde in the little body of Bees a bottle which is the receptacle of Honey sucked from flowers, and their legs loaded with Bitumen which sticks fast to make wax. Also in the tail there is a horny sting full of revenging poyson, that is ready to draw forth as soon as the Bee please; but the King of the swarm is said to want one, for there naturally belongs to the supreme power, who can overthrow all when he will at his pleasure, and there ought to be an im∣bred gentleness, whence it is that Kings by their proper attribute are called Fathers and Pastors of the people. In Gnats you shall observe their sounding trumpet that will suck bloud out of Animals, and will draw out moisture through the joynts of the most solid wood, and wine-vessels. How wilt thou be pleased to see the small proboscis of Butter-flies wreathed alwaies into a spiral line, after they have drawn forth nutriment from flowers, their extended large wings painted by natures artificial pencil, with paints can∣not be imitated; to which the very Rain-bow is scarse comparable;
Which right against the Sun a thousand colours shewes.
What a pleasant spectacle will this be when the artificial hands carefully and curiously guide the most sharp pen-knife, and very fine instrument by direction of the sight! To behold the pipe of the Grashoppers that live upon dew, and the organs of the shril sound they make, that in the heat of the Dog-daes importunately beats upon the ears of travellers, which are so framed, that their concave belly is made vaulted under the Diaphragm, over which is extended a cover of a thin and dry membrane, like to a Drum, which lets in the air by an oblique turning, which being beaten by the regular and suc∣cessive motion of their wings, and stomach, coming in at a strat passage, and presently dilated, beating against the rough-cast wals of the hollow place, and refracted, makes a sound. To see the horns of the great Beetles, that are like to Stags horns, and with sharpest points are able to make wounds, and the muscles that move them, and tye them on exceeding fast. The Rhinoceros is of the kinde of great Beetles. The swelling purse which is the matter of the silk, and is wound back again into many turnings, by Silk-worms which are chief of all Caterpillers, of divers forms and colours; in which after the time destinated for the concoction of their food, which is gathered chiefly from Mulberry-leaves, a tenacious glew or jelly is reserved, untill such time as their ventri∣cle swelling, and nature affecting to attain her end, the Worm by degrees belcheth forth her spittle, the thred whereof growing firm by the air (which is provided to make gar∣ments for great men) this little creature dispenseth through her very narrow claws, and spinning with the motion of her head and of half her body, with the kembing of it by the help of her forefeet; she first disposeth it for the strengthning of her clew of yarn, and after that upon her own sepulchre where she must receive her transmutation. How the Spider thrusts out her excrements by her lower parts of her body, which is drawnforth into a web, of which she poor creature frames-nets with great labour, which are necessary to sustain her life; and with her long legs that end in sharp clawes, she knits them into knots, being continually obnoxious to repair her work. In the uppermost cases of the green Locusts which feed upon hedges, there are two scales that are hard as horn, the mutual rubbing together whereof by the ministration of the air beaten with their softer wings, make a very sharp sound. The head of all of this kinde is armed, their hinder legs are hard, dry, long, by the vehement thrusting whereof against some firm object, with the help of their most strong tendons, they will cast their body a great way, being equally ballanced, and is heavy enough for the proportion of it, like an arrow coming forth of a bow; as it happens to Fleas that leap with a huge force. But which is yet more, besides their pincers which are as sharp as keen rasors, where is a direct pas∣sage from their mouth to their tail; the pylorus is compassed out with toothed bars, that answer one the other with a thorny gomphosis, wherewith they destroy whole fields with devouring fore-teeth, like chizels, and grinde them as it were in a mill, and very suddenly they void it forth again; their hunger never ceases until the vile creatures have consumed whole Countreys which God is angry with, divine revenge commanding them; and brings to nought that people, who ridiculously threaten heaven with destru∣ction. You shall see the sharp spears that arm the mouth of the Spiders Phalangia, and by the small wounds they make, a strange venome enters, and penctrates into the center of the body, and sticks fast to the deepest marrow, lasting so long in the subject that re∣ceives it as the cruel beast lives; and is exasperated periodically at certain hours, trou∣bling the phantasie of the persons wounded, which is abated with colours objected like to this Spider; yet it ceaseth not to rage, until musick causeth them to dance, and pro∣vokes them to sweat abundantly, whereby the paroxysm is dissolved, which the day fol∣lowing returns at the same hour. You shall behold the internal fire of Glow-worms fastned to their tails, and the torches of the Indian Cocuia that shines in the night, and overcomes Cimmerian darkness. And moreover, if you take lenticular optick Glasses of crystal, (for though you have Lynx his eyes, these are necessary in searching after Atoms) you will admire to see the dark red colour of the Fleas that are curasheers, and their back stiffe with bristles, their legs rough with hair, and between two foreyards there stands a hollow trunk to torture men, which is a bitter plague to maids, and is the grea∣test enemy to humane rest, especially when that men would sleep. You shall see the eyes of the Lice sticking forth, and their horns, their body crannied all over, their whole substance diaphanous, and through that, the motion of their heart and bloud, as if it floted in Euripus. There will appear to thee the flat bodies of the petulant Crab-lice, with their grapples, wherewith they perpetually lance mans skin between the hair with their mouth, and stick on faster than Cockles do to the rocks. Also little Hand-worms which are indivisible they are so small, being with a needle pickt forth of their trenches neer the pools of water which they have made in the skin, and being laid upon ones nail, will discover by the Sun-light their red heads, and feet they creep with∣all. And if from the inspection of parts you will recal your minde to consider the ge∣neration and beginning of Insects, and will weigh the various transmutations which they undergoe, as of Worms into Flies; of Catterpillers (the several species whereof have their original from the corruption of several vegetables) into Chrysallides, (that shine as if leaves of gold were laid upon them) and Butterflies, whose egges again produce an off-spring like Worms, Nature acting successively in a circle, and constantly by a perpe∣tual motion running back into her self: you will doubtless enter upon a large field of Philosophy concerning three Kingdoms of the universal spirit, (the Vegetable, Ani∣mal, and Mineral) equally penetrating, replenishing, and governing, and upon the power and activity of it, introducing divers forms into beings that pertain to each of them, ac∣cording to the disposition of the matter: also the commerce of all sublunary bodies amongst themselves will exercise your contemplation, which though oft times they seem to fight one against the other face to face; yet they agree in one, and from one the other, all and each of them borrow something. And if Animals and Plants be trans∣muted, why should that be denied to Metals? which thing, many genuine Mini∣sters and legitimate helpers of Nature boast, and not without reason, that they can do it by Art: and that only by removing of impediments, and by a convenient application together of actives and passives; which being done, the Philosopher leaves the wholework to Nature only, which by a gentle outward heat, being helped without too much haste, doth raise up an internal fire; which is the Workmaster of the Elixir that must procure health and riches: that I may hisse out Asses, who triumphing in the Lions skin, erect a tumultuous and confused furniture in their Laboratories, and dig forth all things under ground from the very bottoms of Mines, and melt them in the fire, being desirous to make trial of their own dreams.
Their Patrimonies they together pack,
Plying their hidden work with Coles full black,
When they have spent, and labour'd all in vain,
Nothing they finde, nothing they seek again.
But passing over these blowers of the Ashes, if you be pleased to reason deeper concer∣ning Insects; you shall finde what will exercise you in the Monarchical government of Bees, the Democratical of Ants, and the oeconomical providence of them both: of that in gathering and laying up Wax and Hony: of this in replenishing her granaries, and biting asunder the grains of corn at that end where they spring forth, lest the provision which is gathered with hard labour, and laid up for winter, by the force of an imbred heat in their work-house under ground (which is hot whilest the Winter lasts) should cor∣rupt, being spoyled by a sudden production, and a plague arising, together with a fa∣mine overspreading, should destroy the whole nest. Nor can you lightly pass over the Architecture in framing the cells in the combs of wax, mathematically to an exact Hexagon; in the hollow places of a Wasps nest; in the various chambers of the Ant-hill, and winding Meanders: in the joyning together whereof he saw granaries, chambers, hospitals, places of burial, besides the innumerable endowments of these indefatigable creatures, their functions and labours, and he could not admire or praise them sufficient∣ly, who had spent a long time in the contemplation of them, thinking it a work worth his pains, his whole life past being employed in this negligent and very idle business. Silk-worms, all Caterpillars, and Spiders, shew their art in spinning, making snares for Flies, and pitching their nets to provide themselves victuals. The Wood-worms pra∣ctise graving, with the rasp of their mouthes piercing into the timber: Ants and Bees, amongst other Insects, will teach men piety toward old men, tired, sick men, and their own children: Oyl Beetles sacred to Apollo, will teach them to love their off-spring, who never cease for 28 daies to rowl up and down a dung-pil, (which is the receptacle of their seed) from East to West, following the Suns motion, until it be fit to hide in the ground for the production of their young, after the space of a Lunar moneth, which nature hath assigned for the forming, and excluding of this Worm, which shall at length be∣come a Fly. Here take notice that the male hath a prolifick seed without help of the fe∣male, and can generate by it self putrefaction of fit matter interceding in a convenient matrix, though it be not animal. But (that which crowns all the meitations of a Chri∣stian man, and carrieth him aloft) consider how the Silk-worm makes her self a tombe, that is unpassable, by reason of her woven work that is most compacted within, in which the Worm contracted into it self seems to die, and by a prodigious metamorphosis it is born anew a Butterfly, a more noble creature, which by the weaving of its wings flies up into the air toward heaven, whereas before its burial it lived a base creeping creature fastned to the earth, and glued to the food of the ground. See whether a little beast that is obscure, of the kinde of Locusts, living amongst the stubble of the fields, when she is consumed with extreme leanness (which from the posture of one that is praying, the French men of Narbon call Pregadion) do not teach men to hold up their hands in prayer unto heaven, and admonish them to observe a convenient gesture in offering up their supplications unto God. What think you of the greater Beetle, the Indian Rhi∣noceros, which being bred without a female (as the rest of the like kindes are) dies, and riseth again out of her own corruption, like a Phoenix, after her change, when she was sup∣posed to be wholly dead. Lastly, what think you of Flies, which when they are drown'd many hours in water, if you bury them in hot embers, you shall revive them again. Tru∣ly I doubt not but that amongst those serious cogitations, (the object whereof will seem not so serious in respect of other false appearances of men, that are illiterate and unrea∣sonable) thy minde may rise to its original, and fastning thy eyes on heaven inspired byGod, wilt cry out, O the depth! and with the divine Psalmist wilt return a Psalm of thanks to the Maker of Nature: How wonderful are thy works O Lord! In wisdom hast thou made them all, the earth s full with thy possession. So shall I have whereby I may rejoyce, that however the whole course of thy age hitherto hath been but one continual act of Philosophy, yet that by the rare advantage of this Present which is curious with variety, I have given thee a new occasion of no less solid and profitable, than of plea∣sant and ingenious meditation. Suffer therefore that a friendly hand may convey into your Library the Off spring of the most learned Mouffet, which is now at last published and brought to light, and amongst so many volumes wherewith thy Study shelfs are most excellently furnished, assign a place for it, worthy of the Father and the Son. Be∣sides the good things mentioned that shall from thence accrew unto thee, and the very great increase thou shalt reap from the hours thou shalt spend in reading the Book, (if I may jest with thee) thy own profit shall not want its advantage, lest thy proper benefit should here seem to be neglected. In these leaves thou shalt finde what will drive away the plague of thy delights, those beasts that are the greatest enemies to the Muses & their darlings, I mean the Moths that devour Books, which with a greedy belly and iron teeth (though their bodies be very smal) prodigally waste and rend the lucubrations of whole ages. Let those evil beasts that are the most deadly mischiefs of angry nature be destroyed after an ill manner: to prevent the propagation whereof, and to kill their infamous progeny (whilest in the mean time learned writers of Books endevour to abolish their kinde utterly, or their sedulous Collectors do what they can) this Book (which I send to thee as a remembrance of my love, will teach thee in the Chapter that treats of it. But let it suffice, I began with a small pitcher, why should the wheel run till it fill an Amphora? The heat of good will and fruitfulness of the subject carry me away; I must now take off my hand, lest my Epistle should proceed absurdly beyond the bounds, which already unawares hath increased into a volume. Believe that I am affectionated to thee, and how well I wish and desire to thee, these lines I have written may speak. What remains of thy daies which God hath appointed thee to run the race of thy life, before thou receive thy heavenly reward, I wish thou maist finish without any pain of minde or body; and that I may speak with Aristotle writing his last Testa∣ment, I pray from my heart, that thou maist live longer here, for it is well, but if any thing happen, that thou maist safely arrive and enter gloriously into the harbour of the blessed at the moment decreed.
Farewel.
