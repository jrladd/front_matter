WHat tim (most godli and vertuous lady) I take in hand to trāslat this good¦ly peece of worke of master Ihon Epinus made vpō ye. rv. Psalme of Dauid beginninge wyth these wordes (What man shall dwel in thy tabernacle O Lord. &c) furth of ye latine in to oure natural and vulgar mother tongemine  & purpose was not for to trāsate furth of on tonge into an other: that it shoulde go a brode and be commn in eueri mans hand: but for a certain peculiar deare frind of mine: whom I perceiued very desierous of the knoledge thereof
which is vnlerned and lamēteth him selfe muche yt he hath acked the good ye vertuous bringing vp in lerning yt many men haue had to there great confort. Partly by∣cause I do knowledge mine owne reudnes to be such, yt scant I can satisfie & please mine owne minde in the doinge thereof being often tyme displeased and offēded with my selfe that I can do no better: at the leastwyse not so well: as I would that thing should be done which beinge once a brode, muste nedes come vnder many mens iudgments, must susteine and a∣bide ye opinions of mai, of whom some wyl saie this might be more cleane trāstatid: this word or that is not in his owne kind: this sens or that is not giuen according to the minde of ye authour as it hath ben alwaye sen, the nisnes of some
to be such, that they wyll be more redy to finde a faute in an other mans doinge: than them selfe to endeuoure yt in doinge and imi∣tatinge of such like of theirs, ye re∣ders should haue no cause to find any thing worthy-of reprehensiō.
Partly bycause I knewe my frende so gentyll: that he woulde vowchsafe howe so euer it were done to take it in good worth, es∣temming my zeale and good wyl in as muche as thowght it wer so fienly done: that no man myght amend it. But after that I had made an end of the translacion: and had red it ouer once or twyse againe, mi thowght that the plea¦sure done therby to my peculiar frende, should not haue bine able to haue weighede doune ye wrong and iniurie which I should haue wrowght to innumerable: in sub∣tracting
& keepinge a waie or ra∣ther in hidinge of so great a iuell and treasure frō so manie which might haue therby great confort in receyuing knowledge & lighte in the thinge wherein they were norante & blinde and also that they thē selfes might take occasiō o vanish such vices & detestable abominaciō from there hertes as they shoulde se in this boke open¦ly reprehended.
Esteming therefore the sober godly & modest discreciō of many: before the momishe reprehension of a fewe vndiscrete and vngodly momes. I turned my purpose frō apeculier and a priuate commo∣dite of one or twane to the cōmō vtilitie of all men whiche are desi¦rous to knowe the trueth.
Thys done for as muche as in tyme past men haue vsed to dedi∣cate
their workes: some to one mā some to an other, some to obteine fauoure: some to haue there wor∣kes & writings by their authori∣tie defended & mainteined (if any peraduenture shoulde or woulde kicke against the) & finally some yt their workes might be the better regarded for those mens sakes vn¦der whose name they were putte furth. None of al these causes be∣ing in my minde other wise thā only for to profit (the veritie of it selfe being alway a sufficient suc∣cour & bulwarke against all false∣heade & lies) yet I thought with my selfe not vnmete and vnconue¦nient but rather expedient and necessarie folowinge the example of many lerned men whiche haue written, to dedicate thys small worcke bringinge wyth it to the reader greate and vnspeakeable
proffit to some noble person at whose hand: they whiche are desi¦rous of knowledge might receiue i the more willingly, ye more glad¦ly, and wyth the more fruit: con∣sidering that it is the natur of al men commonly to haue in more highe estimacion a small gift at a great mans hand: and it wer but a beke of hys head thā a thing of much more valeur to be giuē and receiued of a person of lower estat and degre yea & would also make much more of it.
Thincking therefore with miself howe I might bestow thys littell gyft worthely and to whome: a∣monge all other your grace came first vnto my minde, whose excellē¦cie being a goodly & a bright spe∣tacle to womanhod: and no small reproch to a great meany of men, which ar slogardes in ded and ve¦ri
idel bodies: and great shame (if any shame were in them) to those whiche shoulde be the brekars of this heauēly foode & breade vnto the people, to their trust and smal fidelite commited, not being satis¦fied and contented them selfes to be idel: but do wishe al other men to be ye same, hatinge and eating them vp in there hertes which be otherwyse affectioned and amōg al other not abideing to here that a woman should once haue the e∣uangelie in her hande or in here mought. Whose excelentie I saie what for ye ardēt loue & desire that your grace doeth beare to the ho∣ly worde of God: but in specially for the diligent promotinge & set∣tyng furth therof to your greate charges: as it deserueth no small cōmendacion and prayse: euen so to take vpon me to extol and com∣mēd
those heauēly giftes which the Lorde hath bestowed in your noble person (your grace abhor∣ringe nothynge more than your owne laude & cōmēdacion, which referreth all to the glory of the lorde) it should seme rather to be an obscuringe of the brightnes of them then a makinge of them to apere more cōmendable being no thinge at al praised when they be but halfe praised: nor yet hauing their dew cōmēdacion: the chiefe and principal parte of them lefte vnspoken and vnmencioned at the leaste wyse not accordinge to there dignite declared nether wt fit wordes nor sentencis adorned.
For as much therefore as your grace before alother most luckely did come to my memoriat whose handes beinge certaine that the cōmō people hath receiued alredy
many confortable & spirituall cō∣solatiōs, instructiōs, & techinges thinkinge also that they woulde fech this swete morsel of meat the more gladde & redier at the hādes which haue ben wont to fede and norishe them: rather than at the hādes of a strainger. I coulde not deuise in my mynde to whome I might be so bolde to dedicate this matter as to your noble grace: where so great gentilnes & lowli∣nes of spirite is: I doubt not but you will so accept & take in good part: this my rugged and vnfiled reudnes that both I shall haue no cause to be sory hereafter for my intempeste and bolde auda∣citie: and also the readars here∣of shal haue cause to yelde thākes to the Lorde for the great know∣ledge that they shall here fech at your hande: to the greate profite
and cōforte of theresoulls: praing the Lorde of al confort, both they and I togither to preserue your grace in this godli minde to your own hertes desire accor∣ding to ye wil and plea∣sure of the Lorde ⁂
