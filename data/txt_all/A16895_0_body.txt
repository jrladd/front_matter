Right Worshipfull,
I Here send you the first fruits of
your owne; your owne by coun∣tenance,
your owne by mainte∣nance.
What you heard with
attention, I questin not but
you will willingly reuiew, and
in what concernes you, readily practise. The Charge
which is here opened is directly ours, but by conse∣quence
yours, and whose not. The Preaching of the
Gospell being a publike worke, though it requires
not euery mans mouth, to preach it; yet his eare,
and his hand it doth, to receiue it, to vphold it. This
Arke of the new Couenant (more is the pity it should
be so frequently laid vpon the Cart) is properly for
our shoulders to beare, but yet none are debarred

from touching of it. It is not onely the liberty, but
the duty of euery priuate Christian to further the
cause of the Gospell in what hee may, much more of
them whom the Common-wealth calleth forth for
publike imployments; I blesse God that I haue no
need to presse this charge vpon your particular, or
if I doe, my arguments must bee commendations.
The bellies of the poore of these parts blesse you al∣ready
in these times of scarcity, I hope some of their
soules shall blesse you for the Bread that perisheth
not. This religious exercise which God hath made
you the instrument to erect, and I hope to contiue,
shall honour you in the eyes of God and his Saints.
The Lord make it as prosperous as it is needfull, and
giue you the true comfort of it here, and hereafter;
So prayeth
