MY LORD,
IN this humble Address to your Lordship, perhaps as unseasonable now as the Declaration of my never-fai∣ling Zeal to his Sacred Majesty, my Lord and Master. I am very sensible how great a Risque I run, first, of offending your Lordship, and next the present State; but I assure your Lordship, I am infinitely more Aw'd by my first Fear than my Last, for that I hope will allow Liberty of Con∣science, even to the Poets themselves, (provided they be no Papists) though there ought to be no Toleration for Indis∣cretion and Ill Manners; which, at this time, take too Saucy a Liberty, and treat even Crown'd Heads with that Disre∣spect and Contempt, as if the British World had agreed they would be Govern'd by no more Kings: And it is no doubt that sort of Establishment is Aim'd at by that great Part of the Nation, the Dissenters. But all true English Men, Men of Honor, and of the Orthodox Church, 'tis to be hoped yet, have other Sentiments, of which number your Lordship is one; whose Glorious Principles of Loyalty and Honor, even now shine forth to the World, and with a Noble Lustre gilding all your other Vertues, have render'd your Lordship one of the most Considerable of any Great Men of your Nation to all succeeding times; and 'tis from Men of such Principles we must hope for the Accomplishment of that Good which has so lately been assur'd us, That of making both King and

People happy; which cannot be by forcing his Majesty to an Exile, and, to palliate that Cruelty, (to give it no worse Name) brand him with all the Infamy that Malice can invent. We would willingly possess our selves with the belief, that such Impudent and right-down Treasonable Libels, as daily come out upon their Majesties, are rather the uncontroulable and implacable Fire-Balls of a few convicted (though now too bare-faced) Criminals, than the Connivance, much less the Toleration of those that now Rule; whose Commands ought to suppress Mischiefs of so dangerous a Consequence, lest up∣on every little Pique they shall please to take against those they now pretend to serve, they should run into the same Ex∣tremity, and treat them at last as Ill as they have done their Lawfull King, or God himself; since to speak Evilly of the one, is to Prophane the other: They need not give us that Infallible Proof, that Religion (so much their Pretence) is the least of their Design and Aim, since no Man on Earth can profess himself a Christian, or even a Moralist, with Notions so absolutely Heathenish and Diabolical; Actions so directly contrary to Scripture, and all the Rules that God himself has set us. And however necessary some may imagin these Asper∣sions may be to the present Interest, to possess the wretched Rabble, and common Rascality, yet they are so far from be∣ing approved or believed, by those of common Sense or to∣lerable Education, that they are abhor'd; and are as abso∣lutely a disgrace to this great design of Setling Religion, as the protection and toleration given to the Assassin of the most Reverend Bishop of St. Andrews, and the Rye-House Con∣spirator. And because Three or Four condemned Criminals have by their Villanies made themselves uncapable of Living under a King, they must now be allow'd Authentick Eviden∣ces against his present Majesty, and blacken him with such Actions of Horror, that the most barbarous of Villains, Thieves, and Murtherers, nay the Fiends themselves, were never guilty of: And though these ridiculous and inhumane Libels are only Calculated for the nasty Rabble, and the foolish positive Multitude, and are below the Sense even of those that write them; yet they serve to blow a Fire that will be one Day too Hot for this Nation. I know they are Countenanced, and seemingly Credited, by a great many

disaffected and ill-minded Men, whose business is no other ways to be done than by setting the World at Odds. And no doubt but it was found absolutely Necessary, after the treating his Majesty at his Return with such unaccountable Contempt, that his Fame and Glory should be ruin'd as well as Himself; having no other Excuse for their own Crimes but loading his Majesty with Calumnies: A poor and bar∣barous Shift to justify a too precipitate Proceeding; a Pro∣ceeding which their Lordships, both Spiritual and Temporal (too zealous for Religion, and too remiss for the King and Nations safety) had not, I am afraid, well enough Consi∣dered, or the ensuing Consequences; nor ought it to have been expected, that when they turned out Popery they should have suffered their King, by the Indignities put upon him, to seek his Safety in a Foreign Nation. I am certain, that none has a more intire Respect for the Prince of Orange than my self, nor a higher Veneration for the Established Religion: As for that Word Protestant Religion, it bears too great a Latitude for me to understand; but, I hope, it is not by dri∣ving out the Jesuits, to down with the Bishops too; which is but too much the Fear of those that are hearty well-wishers to the Established Church, Laws, and Liberties. 'Tis therefore wished that such Publick and Noble Spirits, as that of your Lordship, would represent these Fears to the great Councils of both Nations; and since Affairs go so contrary to the true Intent of this great Design, they would be pleased to take the Care of these Nations into their Consideration: And as they are all Men of Honor, and his Sacred Majesty the Head and Fountain of Honor, they would not suffer that to be polluted by prophane Hands; nor permit a Cause of so High and Glorious Pretences, as this of the Prince of Orange, to be violated, and not serve the end for which it was ad∣vanced. And let those foul Aspersers make good those Scan∣dals they have spread, by any honest or tolerable Witnesses, (and not such as perhaps, who having been guilty of a Thou∣sand Crimes, and to get a General Pardon for real Villanies will confess themselves Guilty of feigned ones) and then they may be allowed to Rail; but if not, let them be deli∣vered to that just Law to which they are Condemned al∣ready: For the Land has too lately been made Calamitous

enough by false Witnesses, on whose Account too much Blood has been shed.
Some such Witnesses (if any) Danvers will pick up for Proofs that the E. of Ess. was Murthered, on which bloody Subject he has troubled the World with too Notable Pieces; which he is pleased to call, A full Discovery, by positive Proofs; in which there is neither Discovery, nor Proof, but a deal of Stuff and Noise, trifling Surmises, bug bear Words, of hor∣rid Murther, bloody Villany, and a thousand terms of the like frightful Sense, dividing his Text as if he were in his Tub a bellowing forth as many Lies, Aspersing and Accusing Men of undoubted Honor, and honest Principles; laying the Scandal on, let them take it off as well as they can; and let the World judge, if that Noble and most Pious Lady, the Countess of Ess. Exemplary for every Vertue, and holiness of Life, would let pass the Murther of her Lord in Silence, and Unsearched into, when she had so good an Occasion offered as this, by the unchrist'ned Colonel, if she were not assured of the way and manner of his Lordship's deplorable Death al∣ready. 'Tis therefore the humble Request of all honest Men, that this Licentiousness of the Press may be supprest; other∣wise, instead of Establishing of Laws and Religion, we are hurrying both to Ruin, and Confusion.
My Lord, all the World knows your Lordship to be a true Lover of your Country, and a noble Asserter of all its Liberties, and equal to those, the Rights and Prerogatives of your King, whose Interest has hitherto been Inseparable with your own, even in the worst of Times; but, oh! never so bad as these; for then our King was but oppress'd, but now he is forc'd to fly, contrary to the Intent (I hope) of all who have embark'd in this great Design. But though we have not yet found the Effects of it, wholly to doubt it, were to call in question the Integrity of a great Prince, and the Loyalty of the noblest Part of the Nation, and suspect the most astonish∣ing and unpresidented Atchievment that ever was surprizing in History, and the most considerable Turn of State that the Universe ever saw. We will therefore look up, and hope that the Prince of Orange, accomplish'd with so many Vertues, and who has the true Notion of Religion and Honour in his great Soul, will, by the sacred Keeping of his Word, in making our

King happy, give us an Assurance of all he has promis'd us be∣sides: For after the most Refin'd Statesmen, and Men of the most Wisdom and Conduct in the Establishment of Nations, have debated as long as they please, they will find at last there is no way to give us our Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Re∣pose, but by recalling and fixing our King in his Lawful Throne. The Constitution of England being founded on Mo∣narchy, it were to embroil the Nation in Eternal War, either Civil or Foreign, not to submit half way, and recall our King to his proper Glories; otherwise, no humane Wisdom can prevent our being perpetually fatigued with our Neighbours, who are like to give us sufficient Diversion, if we are in Love with War, and be at a continual Expence of English Blood (and Mony more dear to us;) and let us please our selves, if we can, with the Contempt we put on France, and set as lightly of the Force and Power of that Monareh, as we do of his Per∣son, we may to our cost find, that Lewis XIV. of France is not so easily subdued as (it hapned) James II. of England was; nor that his Forces, of what Religion soever, will abandon and betray their King, as ours did; who, to the Eternal Shame of that Religion (we only talk of and do not practise) find those Principles (which are thought too bloody in the Papist) infinitely more Just and Honorable than those of ours; since they thought they ought in Conscience to fight Faithfully for that Prince who fed and clothed them, let his Religion be ne∣ver so contrary to their own; and most certainly there might have been a Medium found between their quitting of their Re∣ligion or their Loyalty, which have hitherto been thought inconsistent: But on the contrary, Vertues that used to go hand in hand among good Christians, and Men of Honor. And the Primitive Christians gloried in their Loyalty, though even to Heathen and Tyrant Emperors.
And as it was not lawful to push things to that Extremity to which they are arriv'd, so neither was it needful; we having a King that blest be God, who wou'd not have carried his Dis∣pensing Power to that height, as to become a Burthen, or Grievance to his People; and his Majesty, and his Council, must have been a Synod of Gods, to have committed no Er∣rors in the management of so Critical a Government.
There is no doubt but his Majesty, out of a tender Com∣passion to the Papists, was pleased to give them a little incou∣ragement

and respite from Affliction; and we may see by his Majesties willingness to restore all things to their first Order, at the very first Address of the Bishops, that he did not think his Counsels Infallible.
Perhaps 'twill be Objected, That he made not this Gracious Condescention till after he heard of the Designs of the Prince of Orange: If this be granted, they must also grant me this other truth, That it could not be fear of being Conquered by the Foreign Army (as Malice would insinuate) that could oblige him to it; for then his Majesty knew not but that he was sure not only of his Great Men, but also of his Army, that was able to have vanquish'd a far greater Army than what came with the Prince; and no body doubted his Success (if they had fought, and that his Men had stood by him) ex∣cept those who before knew how he was to be abandon'd. And 'tis most certain, and well known to some of Quality, that his Majesty would have condescended to any reasonable terms that Honor could have propos'd; nor did he come back again from Feversham but with a full Intent to have adjusted the great Affair: But while they complained on Evil Counsels, on the King's side, 'tis thought, they had not those, on the other side, that were Friends to Peace, or an Accommodation; for if they had meant any such thing, his Majesty had not been sent away again no better than a Prisoner.
I will not say, that those Misfortunes that hinder'd us of this happy Peace, and promis'd Union, were the Faults of his Highness, whose Designs were undoubtedly Noble, but the Effects of a too violent Council, too much biassed against the Royal Interest.
Your Lordship, and all other Great Men of both Nations, are most humbly besought, by all Loyal and Honest Church of England Men, to use your Interests both for the Preserva∣tion of these poor distracted Kingdoms, and especially for the Restauration of his most Sacred Majesty; for which yours, and their Lordships, will Eternally receive the Prayers and Blessings of all good Men: And my humble Muse, who pre∣sumes to prostrate her Complaint here at your Feet, shall rouse her Melancholy Head again, and Sing yet once more to Ce∣lebrate the Loyalty of the Great Name of ARRAN, and the Illustrious HAMILTON.
VIVAT REX.
