SIr, I pray you consider with me an especiall point of Gods word, carefully to be waied: it is this,Mat. 25. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.
Luk. 13. 24.
Many pro∣fessors of Christ, in the day of grace, perswade themselues that they are in the estate of grace; and so the true Church esteemeth of them too: yet when the day of grace is past, they contrariwise shall finde themselues to be in the estate of dā∣nation remedilesse.A caueat to all protestants, of what estate or condition soe∣uer. A dolefull case, yet a most resolute trueth, and the reason is plaine. Men that liue in the Church are greatly annoyed with a fearefull securite and deadnes of heart; by which it comes to passe that they thinke it enough to make a common protestation of the faith, not once in all their life times, exa∣mining themselues whether they be in the estate of grace before the eternall God or not.2. Cor. 13. 5. Psal. 119.59 And indeede it is a grace peculiar to the man Elect to trie him∣selfe whether he be in the estate of grace or not.
The further opening of the trueth of this point, as also the daunger of it, I haue enterprised in this treatise; which I am willing to bestow on you, both for the profession of the faith, which you make, as also for that Christian friendship, you haue shewed to me. Accept of it I pray you and vse it for your edification.Act. 20. 32. Thus I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, that is able to builde you vp further and giue you an inheritance among them which are sanctified.
From Cambridge this 24. of Nouember. 1589.
