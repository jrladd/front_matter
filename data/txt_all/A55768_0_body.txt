THE following Poem being transmitted to me from an unknown Hand, with Liberty to Suppress, or Publish it, my own Thoughts were determin'd upon the first Perusal; however, in just Regard to the conceal'd Authors Modesty, I consulted the Opinion of some Judi∣cious Friends, whose Opinion readily Concurr'd with mine concerning it. The Beauties, which were every where so Conspicuous and Transcendent, commanded a joint consent to the Publication. There are so many Topicks insisted upon and connected, by such a Natural and easie Tran∣sition, through the whole Work, that it seem'd to carry with it the Charms and Entertainment of Mathematical Conse∣quences. The variety of common Places of Poetry had confounded a common Genius, and render'd it according to the Description of Horace, Aegri somnia Vana—ut nec pes nec caput uni Reddatur Formae: Whereas on the contrary, the judicious Management, and Artificial Con∣nection, has reduced Variety into Coherence and Consistence,
 according to that excellent and difficult Precept, Simplex duntaxàt & unum, Qualis ab incaepto processerit & sibi constet.—Tantum series juncturaque pollet. It is Vi∣sible, that the Author, like a Master Builder, had first erected the Frame, and every where secured the support∣ing Parts of the Fabrick, before he proceeded to invest it with the Additional and Ornamental Matter. Decora∣tion, though it be the best, is not the least Task of Poetry. In this Essay it is Delightful and Surprizing, to see with what Dexterity the Muse has chang'd Her Pencils, from Panegyrick to Satyr, from Satyr to Pastoral, and the Tenderest Complaints of a Lover, and so Happy in the several Attempts, as if each were Her particular Talent. Though the Stanza be difficult, the Expression is easie, the Sense Comprehensive, Just and Strong, and a Climax of Thought reserv'd for every Period. Thus much I thought necessary on my Part to Premise, and leave the rest to the more Judicious Readers Observation.
