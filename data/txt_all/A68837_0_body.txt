SO it is moste honorable, that fame flying ouer the seas, out of your British Ile; hath left vnto our spa∣tious continent the reporte of your honors woor∣thynesse: and therefore in my self a desyre to do your honors such seruice as might bee vvorthie your esteem. But seeing no occasion hath concurred vvhereby I might haue bin so fortu∣nate as by you to bee comaunded, I haue presumed to make de∣monstration of my redynesse therevnto, by dedicating vnto your honors (for your recreation) these my inuented emblemes of that subiect, that subiecteth princes no lesse then subiects. Vouchsafe my Lordes to bee honored from these forreyn partes by a stran∣ger, vvho to serue your honors in the best partes he hath, vvill make himself no stranger.
Thus in all dutifull respect I kisse your honors handes from Antvverp this .20. of August. 1608.
