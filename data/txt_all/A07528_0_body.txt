Worthy Sir,
TIs but a Play, and a Play is but a Butt, against which ma∣ny shoote many Arrowes of Enuy, 'tis the weaker Part, and how much more noble shall it be in you to defend it, yet if it be (as some Philosophers haue left behind'um) that this Megacsme, this great world, is no more then a Stage, where euery one must act his part, you shall of necessity haue many part∣takers, some long, some short, some indifferent, all some, whilst indeed the Players themselues haue



the least part of it, for I know few that haue lands, (which are a part of the World) and therefore no grounded men, but how soeuer they serue for mutes, happily they must weare good cloathes for atten∣dance, yet all haue exits and must all be stript in the Tyring-house (viz, the graue) for none must carry anything out of the stocke, you see Sir, I write as I speak, & I speak as I am, & thats excuse enough for me. I did not meane to write an Epistle of praise to you, it lookes so like a thing, (I know) you loue not Flattery, which you exceedingly hate actiuely, and vnpleasingly accept passiuely: indeed I meant to tell you your owne, that is, that this child of the Mu∣ses is yours, who euer begat it, tis laid to your charge and (for ought I know) you must father and keep it too, if it please you, I hope you shall not bee asham'd of it neither for it has beene seene (though I say it) in good companies, and many haue said it is a hand∣some pretty spoken infant, now be your owne iudge, at your leasure looke on it, at your pleasure laugh at it, and if you be sorry it is no better you may be glad it is no bigger.
