SIR,
I Might Preface to
you, with Reasons
of this Dedication,
or with Apologies:
You are a stranger
to me, nec benefi∣cio,
nec injuria cognitus,Tacitus de Galba, O∣thone, vitel. Hist. Lib. 1. Onely I
affect to be knowne unto you; this is mo∣tive
enough, nor pleade I other excuse:
What your eares grac't with a liking in
the passage, these sheetes speake to your

eyes, but more standingly, my hopes
are blest, if I please both sences: Your
applause (as 'tis tradition'd me) was
full and liberall, much above the worth
of these thoughts; I silence the causes
made them Publique, that makes them
Yours; and candor 'tis, I honour more,
than greatnesse in a Patron: I owe
your love an acknowledgement, deeds
were little enough to expresse it, but my
aimes are crown'd, if by your Pardon
or Acceptance, this so small Booke,
professione pietatis,Tacitus in vita Iulij Agricolae. aut laudatus
erit, aut excusatus: Farre-well Wor∣thy
Sir:
Shaston:
