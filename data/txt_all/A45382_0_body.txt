Dread Soveraign,
TRue Loyalty hath imboldned me to present this Subject to your Majesty, not out of any Sinester Ends of mine own, but in the behalf of the truly Loyal Commissi∣on'd Officers; them that can declare and prove themselves so: and the Causes of all their Wants, Sufferings, and Indigencies, since your happy Re∣stauration: We must confess your Majesty and Parliament hath been bountiful unto us: But the Sinester self-ends and Covetousness, of some that hath had the Managing of your Gracious Favours, hath left us still Indigent Officers; and hath enricht themselves by our Ruines. All that we humbly beg of your Majesty, is for the King of Kings sake, and for your Blessed Fathers sake, one of the best of Kings; that you would be so gra∣giously pleased, as to afford that small time as to peruse this Book, or Refer it to some that may give your Majesty an Account of it. Here is nothing but Truth in it, though it be deckt in a mean Habit of poor Language, being more Souldier then Scholar.
Thirty five Years we have served and suffered for your Royal Father, of ever Blessed Memory, and your Sa∣cred Majesty, above half the Age of most of us. Twenty Years before your happy Restauration, we spent our Youths, our Bloods, and what Estates we had, in Imprisonment, and Bon∣dage, in the time of Rebellion, and af∣ter the Murther and Marthirdom  your Blessed Father; and now almost fifteen Years since your happy Restau∣ration (in Indigency and much want many of us) we hope your Majesty af∣ter so long a time, will somthing pro∣vide for us, that we may not want Food and Raiment in our Old Age We have been forc'd to make Fast∣ing days, whilst those hath made Feasting days; which hath Conver∣ted your Majesties Bounties and Fa∣vours to their one use, that was or∣dered to be justly and honestly deal withal by them, for the Relief of some of us. Some of these having recei∣ved double favours from your Ma∣jesty, and not satisfied, are always con∣triving for more: We hope your Ma∣jesty hath some left for us at last who can prove our Loyalty, Service and Deserts, equal with some of theirs if not out Ballance them, and out Sufferings much more. We have no dy under God to make our necessi∣ties and grievances known to, but our Gracious Majesty. It was for∣merly a Proverb, That a Friend in court, was better then a Penny in Purse; But now no Penny in Purse, w Friends in Court: We may wan∣er with our good Service and desert here we will, we shall scarce find mployment or Preferment, for an In∣igent Officer; unless he can bring Angels with him to open their mouths, nd make them speak Cheerfully: Pray pardon me gracious Soveraign, out of the abundance of the Heart he Mouth speaketh) If I have been oo bold in my Expressions, I hope your Majesty will think it more my Igno∣ance, then Presumption.
May it please your Majesty, I have ere in this small Treatise, drawn out he truly Loyal Commission'd Officers; what they have been, what they now are, and how to be known; which tru∣ly qualified, are not many now to be pro∣vided for. I have cleered the Asper∣sions laid upon them to your Majesty. Likewise the causes of their Indigency formerly, and lately, by the pretended Loyal Officers: Which I hope your Majesty will take it into your Prince∣ly Consideration, to provide some sub∣sistance, that we may live and end our days with some Comfort and Content after our Troubles, and so long Suffer∣ings, that we may pray for your Ma∣jesties long Life, Happy Reign, and prosperity in this Life, and a Crown of Glory in the World to come: which shall be the Prayers of your ever Loy∣al Subject and Souldier; to the ut∣most of my Strength and Power; as I am in Duty bound,
