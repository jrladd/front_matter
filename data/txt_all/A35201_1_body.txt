MADAM,
THough by the power of Law and Religion,
my Lord of Shrewsbury was sole pro∣prietor
of your Daughter and her Inhe∣ritance,
(both which he purchas'd by
the instrate of his merits) yet by the
Law of Nature your Honour had the
first and most intimate propriety; She
being your real flesh, and his Metaphori∣cal,
yet that more real then usually Metaphors intend, the for∣mer
tye ingageth conscience, but the latter more nearly obli∣geth
affection. Madam, I thought it my duty to divide this ser∣vice
between my Lord and You; being both joynt Purchasers in
her life, and Sympathizers in her death, if there be any thing in
this Elegie which may pretend to Life and Spirit, doubtless it
was inspir'd by the Genius of your deceased Daughter; if any
thing of sadness and mourning your Ladyship may suppose it
dropt from my Sisters eyes: 'Tis smooth and easie, like her tem∣per
and disposition it commemorates; and your Ladyship (as
your goodness must prompt you) will, I hope, be the same to it.
And upon that account onely, I expect your Ladyship will par∣don
this service, and the weakness of it, to
MADAM,
