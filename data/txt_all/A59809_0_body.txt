May it please your Grace,
IT is not unknown to your Grace, that in a late Discourse, accor∣ding to my mean Abilities, I en∣deavoured to vindicate Christian Religion from those uncouth and absurd Representations, which some modern Di∣vines, who are the great Fomenters of our present Factions, have made of it: And herein I thought, I should do good service,

not only to the common Cause of Christia∣nity (which is exposed to the scorn of Athei∣stical Wits, for the sake of such Doctrins, as are so far from belonging to Christianity, that they seem to be invented on purpose to affront the general sense and understanding of Mankind,) but also to the best constitu∣ted Church in the World, which is rent and torn into a thousand Factions for the sake of these new Discoveries, which are admi∣red for no other reason, but because they are not understood.
And I have met with such a Reward, as those men use to do, who oppose any popular and inveterate mistakes, hard Words and hard Censures; though as soft and gentle Arguments, as I could wish: But my Ad∣versaries have used one extraordinary piece of Art, which alone, I hope, will be suf∣ficient to make my Apology for this Address.
It is well known, my Lord, what Friends they are to the Church of England, and yet now they take Sanctuary in our Church, and pretend a mighty Zeal for the antient Catholick Doctrin of it: Their great

quarrel with me is, that I have contradict∣ed the Doctrin of our Church, and they are very jealous lest the Church should by this means be disadvantageously represented to the world; and think it the concernment of the Reverend Bishops either to confute or censure such Doctrins: And indeed would those grave and wise Persons hearken either to Papists or Fanaticks, they should never want work; for whenever they find them∣selves gravelled, they call upon the Church of England, to defend them against her most zealous Advocates and hearty Friends.
My Lord, were I in the least conscious to my self of having deserted the Doctrin of our Church, there is no Person, whom I should so justly dread as your Grace, whose quick and piercing Iudgment would easily detect such a Prevarication, and whose great Authority could as easily crush so weak an Adversary, and whose syncere and hearty Zeal and Fatherly Care and Affe∣ction for this Church would not suffer such Tares to grow up in the midst of the Wheat. But these excellent Accomplish∣ments,

wherewith God has in great good∣ness endowed your Grace for the Preserva∣tion and wise Government of this Church in such dangerous and critical times, render you as sure a Refuge and Sanctuary to the Friends of our Church, as they make you formidable to her Enemies.
In this Assurance it is, that I humbly lay this my Defence at your Graces Feet, and entirely submit it and its Author to your Iudgment and Censure. If I have said any thing blame-worthy, it has been hitherto out of invincible Ignorance and Mistake, which I hope will plead my excuse: And if I have (as I am verily persuaded I have) made a true and faithful Representation of the Doctrin of our Church, and vindicated it from such Fanatical Innovations, as give the greatest and the justest cause of Scan∣dal to all wise and considering men, I hum∣bly beg your Graces Patronage, which is the only Security and Protection I desire from the rude Clamors and vehement Re∣proaches of my Adversaries.

I beseech Almighty God to preserve your Grace long among us in Health and Vigor, to protect his Church by your wise Counsels and Conduct, and to adorn your See with your exemplary Virtues, which is the hear∣ty Prayer of
