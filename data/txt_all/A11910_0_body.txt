WHen as I had (right ho∣norable Syr) at the re∣quest of my frendes, both performed and minded to publysh thys my symple translation of so notable a Tragedie, written by the prudent, and sage Sneca: I thought it good for diuers consideracions to bestowe this the fyrst frutes of my good will, & trauaile, rather vpō your honour, thē vpon any other per¦son: first in y• I cōsidered your honours aucthorie, wisedome, & learning, (takyng the tuicion of it vpon you) might be a terrour, and abashment, to such slaunderous

tonges, who by my symple & slender skill, eyther in this or any other lyke facultie, myght take courage rather of malicious∣nes (then of ryght) to reprehend my do∣ings, furthermore hauing vnderstanding partlye by the report of men, and partlie perceauyng when I was somtyme schol∣ler in th Queenes maiestties Grammer schole at Westminser, the hartye good∣will, and frendlie affction that your ho∣nour bare towardes all studentes, I con∣ceiued this hope, that you would accept my good wyll and doynges the better, in that I professe my selfe to be a student, & that in the vnyuersytye of Cambrydge, wherin somtyme your honour were trai∣ned vp in learnyng, and now being most worthelie Chaunceler ther of, do greatly tender the commoyye of the studentes in the same, wyth te aduauncement & encrease of learnyge, furtheraunce of vrtue, and abolyshment of vice. Thus thrfore trustyg yu honours courtsie will haue me xcsd for my rude bolde∣nes.

and except my good wyll herein sygny∣fyed, I leaue you to the turssyon of all∣myghtye god, who encrease you wyth honour, graunt you longe lyfe with eter∣nall felycytye.
