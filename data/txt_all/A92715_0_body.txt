Reader,
YOU have here the Life, Pranks, and Death
of one of the most unparallel'd Thieves in
these our dayes, as it was partly delivered
by himself, and partly by others that were
conversant with him in his Life. I have
forborn to tell you his petty Thieveries: but because there
is one, which being his first, and as it were a Prologue to
his former Actions, I shall insert it here; and thus it
was: Being in the Market-place, where there sate a
Woman selling Puddings, he spies her, steps unto her,
and feigning himself desiring for to buy, asks her the
price, she told him; but speaking to another Customer,
he in the interim slips as many as handsomely he could
into his codpiece, which having done, told the Woman, He
would not give so much; and thereupon left her. Upon
this good success, taking himself to be one of Fortunes
Favourites, he frequently comes to Market: insomuch,
that by degrees, from robbing of a Stall, he comes to rob
a Shop; from a Shop, to rob a House; and from a House,
even to dare to rob the Court: until his doings did at last

undoe him. Whether it was more for need, or more to co∣vet
other Mens applause, that thus he lived, I question
which. But such is the Policy of the Devil, that plot∣ting
to undermine the frailty of a Wretch, he shews him
what it is to be admir'd; this spurs him on with a con∣ceit
of acting something that may make him famous: of
which he runs the hazard, and at last is taken: for so the
custome of the Devil is, When he hath brought one in a
dangerous way, to leave him in the wolvish jaws of death.
Thus hath the wings of Fame flown away with many,
that not onely might have liv'd in the Callings wherein
they were educated, and contentedly; but died peaceably,
and so have liv'd, as not to fear to die, and took the
easier way to Heaven, viz. in a Feather-Bed, and not a
Sring.
I shall not stay you any longer at the door, which being
open, you may enter, and view the grandest Thief in Eu∣rope:
but give me leave, before you wander further, to
give you a true account of what he left behinde him on the
Ladder.
