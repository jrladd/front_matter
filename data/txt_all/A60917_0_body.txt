I Am resolved to make no A∣pology for This short Account of the Magnificent, and Noble City of London, where you will meet with nothing offensive, and I think I have observed every thing that is Remarkable in it; It would have been unpardon∣able in me, to have omitted a∣ny matters which the Curious might be desirous to know, having an Inimitable Pattern from one of that Country lately, who for the clearness of his Ex∣pression, the Elegancy of his

Descriptions, as well Ingenuous Choice of his Subjects, deserves a Particular Salutation from all the Admirers of the Belles Let∣tres in the Universe.
I might here take an Oppor∣tunity to beg Pardon of the Eng∣lish, for my misrepresentations Thirty Years ago, but 'tis to be hoped this Book will make my Peace with that Nation. The following pages will show you the Considerable heads I de∣sign'd to Treat off, and now I have paid my Devoirs at the En∣trance, I will not Importune you a∣ny longer.
