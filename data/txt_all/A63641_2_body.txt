I AM now to present to your Honour part of that Production of which your great love to Sanctity was Parent, and which was partly designed to satisfie those great appetites to Ver∣tue which have made you hugely apprehensive and forward to entertain any Instrument whereby you may grow and encrease in the Ser∣vice of God, and the Communion and Charities of holy people. Your Honour best knows in what Soil the first De∣sign of these Papers grew; and but that the Excellent Personage who was their first Root is transplanted for a time, that he may not have his righteous Soul vexed with the impurer Conversation of ill∣minded men, I am confident you would have received the fruits of his abode to more excellent purposes. But because he was pleased to leave the managing of this to me, I hope your Honour will for his sake entertain what that rare Person conceived, though I was left to the pains and danger of bringing forth; and that it may dwell with you for its first relation, rather than be rejected for its appendent imperfections, which it contracted not in the fountain, but in the chanels of its progress and emanation. Madam, I shall beg of God that your Honour may receive as great increment of Piety and ghost∣ly strength in the reading this Book, as I receive honour if you shall be pleased to accept and own this as a confession of your great Wor∣thiness, and a testimony of the Service which ought to be payed to your Honour by,
Madam,
