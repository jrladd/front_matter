My Noble Lord,
THe naturall affection, which by the successive vertue of your Family you have alwayes borne to Poetry, ingages me in the absence of the worthy Author, to present your Lordship this piece, that you, the best Maecenas of the age, might Patronize this best of Playes. Had Mr. Davenaut himselfe beene present, hee would have elected no other Patron but your Lordship, and in his absence I beseech you accept this Worke of his; whose excellence, I hope, will excuse his boldnesse, who had no other ambition in the dedication, but that he might by publike profession be knowne to be that which has long time been in his private affection,
