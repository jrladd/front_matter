SOveraigne, Sacred and divine is Royall MAIESTIE, and it is the glorie thereof to protect sa∣cred things. This my Meditation vpon Heavens Loadstone, the glorious vision & fruition of God, though in respect of the authour and the stile, it may seeme unworthy of your Ma∣iesties iudicious eye; yet in regard it is in it selfe asubiect most sacred, and sacredly handled (agree∣ing to the rule of holy faith) I humbly presume to crave from your Maiesty both prection, and gra∣cious acceptance of it; which my minde presumes, I shall most assuredly haue: Protection, because I humbly craue it, from the Defender of that faith, the happy end and fruite whereof, is the glorious vision and fruition of God: Gracious acceptance, because it cannot but be a subiect most acceptable to your religious and pious mind, which (like that of Moses) is daily looking on this most glorious
 reward. For this (to the ioy of your people, and for the example of all greatnesse) Comes testified & confirmed, both by your Maiesties reverent at∣tention to the word Read or Preached; fervent and intentiue devotion to Gods prayses (in pray∣ers) celebrated; but especially by your Maiesties daily often times of prayers. O that the whole Britaine-Orbe, at least the whole Tribe of Levy therein, were composed and ordered, according to this your Maiesties example. Goe on glorious Prince, & let not your Hand cease to protect & enlarge the virgine-faith which yee professe, to raise up despised Discipline, (for the glory of our Church), to mainteyne iustice and iudgement, and with Clemency to establish your Throne. And that glorious God whom yee serue with feare & trembling, shall, and will in the end, bid you en∣ter into that his owne ioye, the glorious vision and fruition of himselfe.
Amen.
