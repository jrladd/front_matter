My Lord,
GRatitude, as well as Justice, requires,
that a Poet should address his La∣bours
to him, who procures the ad∣vancement
of his Art; And 'tis sufficiently
known, that 'tis in a great measure to the
wisdom of your Lordship's Counsels, that we
owe the near prospect of a glorious Peace,
which alone can make Poetry flourish: A pros∣pect
without which we Writers, should be as
men in the world without hope; hope which
is the present happiness of the wretched, and
their earnest of future felicity.
My Lord, the indefatigable pains, and the

unwearied diligence which your Lordship has
us'd in the advancing that Peace, and your
entring at this happy Conjuncture, upon that
high office, which brings those who write
for the Stage, immediately under your ju∣risdiction,
give us assurances of what we
may expect from your Lordships future pro∣tection.
'Twas immediately after that Mecenas had
securd repose to the world, and its disputed
Empire to Augustus, that he begun to ani∣mate
those mighty geniuses, which were
equal to the Majesty of the Roman people.
My Lord, when we, who write for the
Stage, cast our Eyes around us, we conclude
unanimously, that if we our selves were to
chuse our protector, we should be proud to
make the same choice which the King has al∣ready
made for us. Tho at the same time I
humbly beg leave to acquaint your Lordship,
that neither your Birth, nor Rank, nor your
Capacity for affairs▪ tho this is great, as those
are illustrious, cou'd determin us to that choice.
No, my Lord, you have qualities which weigh
more with us, than all those glorious advan∣tages;
and those are, the fineness of your dis∣ernment,
in matters of Wit and Eloquence,

and the delicacy of your taste; qualities by
which we hope to get the better of the Enemies
of the Commonwealth of Learning, which are
cold verifiers and false Criticks, as by the
wisdom of your Lordships Counsels, we have
humbled the Enemies of the State.
The foremention'd qualities, which are so
conspicuous in your Lordship, are such alone
as can capacitate a great man to protect
good Writers, and which alone can gain him
their homage. For that which animates them
in their undertakings is, chiefly the thirst of
Glory, and they desire to be distinguished as
well as supported; and therefore are proud
when they can at any time address themselves
to a Judge, who never yet conferr'd his fa∣vours
upon one who was undeserving of
them, and the reputation of whose Authen∣tick
applause, may serve at once to confirm
their Friends, and to convert their Enemies.
That I have at least the Ambition of such
Writers, no man can doubt, who sees me Sub∣scribe
my self,
My Lord,
