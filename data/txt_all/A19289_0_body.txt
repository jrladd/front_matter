RIght Worshipfull and
beloued in the Lord Ie∣sus,
my harts desires so
long as I abide in this house
of clay, that I may be made
manifest, especially vnto the
consciences of those, who

haue bene the meanes of
my more comfortable pil∣grimage
through this vale
of teares. And therefore as
the Lord hath vsed your
bountie as a gratious mor∣ning
raine to cherish the
seed-time of my yonger stu∣dies,
so haue I esteemed it
very equall, that you should
reape some part of the har∣uest
of my riper fruits: Ac∣knowledging
my self much
bound to my gracious God,
that hath renued my daies
to leaue some memoriall of
your loue, and my respect
thereof. And purposing as
the Lord shall lend further
health, not to cease to stirre
vp your pure minds to make
sure your Election, by en∣creasing
and abounding in

loue vnto his Saints. Blessed
be God euen the father of
our Lord Iesus Christ, who
hath taught you this holy
wisedome, to make you
friends of your vnrighteous
Mammon, and to laye a
good foundation against
the day of Christ Iesus; And
faithfull is he that hath pro∣mised
and will accomplish
his worke in you, that you
may be constant and a∣bound
in the worke of the
Lord, that your labour may
not be in vaine in the Lord:
Hold on thē in the name of
God Beloued, while ye yet
haue time, and the Lord
prosper you in this blessed
worke of weldoing to the
houshold of faith. Oh how
shall you maintaine the true

honour of this famous Citie
to be still the treasurie of
the poore, and nurserie of
learning, and true religion?
how shall you sanctifie the
portion which the Lord
hath lent you, to make it
constant to your posteritie,
when you shall thus offer
the first fruits of your en∣crease
vnto the Lord? Shall
not the loynes of the poore
blesse you, doe not their
prayers keepe away the ven∣geance
from your Citie? Are
you not the meanes to con∣tinue
& deriue the Gospel to
posteritie, do you not there∣by
prepare the Church of
God to eternitie? And shall
not the generatiōs to come
esteeme you blessed? shall
not your posteritie be nur∣sed

vp in the Church? shall
not the memoriall of the
iust liue for euer? Surely if
my poore life and meanes
may any whit further here∣unto:
as I do offer vnto you
vnfainedly this pledge ther∣of:
So let me intreate you in
the merites of Iesus Christ,
to take it as a glasse to trie
your estates by, and so hold
what is good and warranta∣ble
for your soules happi∣nes.
I doubt not but you are
wise to discerne of the euils
of the time: And howsoeuer
the prouerbe now if euer,
may be verified, that hee
which knowes not to dis∣semble,
knowes not how to
liue: yet I trust you haue
learned by gratious experi∣ence,
that as the Lord li∣ueth,

truth in the inward
parts, and hath no need of
our lie and hypocrisie to
maintaine his truth, so he
hath and wil daily confound
the equiuocating Iesuite
and lukewarme professor,
the dissembling Papist, and
shifting Ambodexter, that so
we neither need feare their
malice, nor eate of such
things as please them: One∣ly
the Lord make you so
wise in the dispensation of
your Stewardships; that as
you distribute to others, so
you may reserue for your
selues, being humbled in
your weldoing here, that
you may not loose the com∣fort
of it in an other life. And
giuing God the whole glorie
of all his meanes towards

you, that hath giuen you an
enlarged hart for the aduāce¦ment
of his Gospell: that so
you may more and more be
emptied of all preposterous
loue of earthly things. And
considering, that hee that
scattereth shall haue plentie:
you would therefore learne
to liue by faith in the feare of
God, casting your bread vpon
the waters. And the more you
discerne the world to be gi∣uen
ouer to abominable Sa∣criledge,
Euen to robbe the
Lord in his Tythes and offe∣rings,
the more you would
hereby approue your selues
to be chosen out of the world,
that you seeke not your owne,
but that which is Iesus Christs
still ministring vnto the ne∣cessities
of the Saints. And

ouercomming, & confoun∣ding
the euill of the time,
by iudging wisely of the cause
of the afflicted, and husban∣ding
well, yea encreasing
daily the Treasury, which
your Perdecessors left vnto
you, that your posteritie
may be encouraged and blessed
by your holy example. And
the poore Church of Christ
may now ye better be main∣tained,
by how much the
worlde esteemes it Gods
best seruice, to emptie and
spoyle the same.
For mine owne part; As
it hath pleased my good God
to exercise me with continu∣all
afflictions, and lingering
sicknesses; disinabling mee
from my calling, and so ca∣sting
mee into many extre∣mities:

so it is my great cō∣fort,
that I haue foūd a strong
& faithfull GOD, in my grea∣test
infirmities: who as hee
hath restored life, though in
some weake measure, so will
hee not also fupplie meanes
gratiously? Yea surely: Bles∣sed
be his name, that though
the Lions want, & suffer hun∣ger,
yet they that feare the
Lord shall want nothing that
is good: And I blesse God,
that I haue foūd more good
in my greatest Afflictions,
then euer I could haue ho∣ped
for in my greatest pros∣peritie.
Surely, if it were no
more, but to knowe our selues
truely, to discerne the insuffici∣encie,
and deceitfulnes of world∣ly
things, and so to bee wayned
from the loue of them, the most

sharpest Afflictions were not
bought too deare: But that
our light Afflictions, whicb are
but for a moment, should not
onely proue meanes to trie
and increase Gods graces in
vs, but to procure vnto vs iy
euen vnspeakeable and glorious:
and so to seale vs vnto salua∣tion,
.2 Pet. 1. 9. 10. and so
giue vs possession of happi∣nes,
euen in this life: yea,
to cause vnto vs a farre more ex∣cellent,
and eternall waight of
glorie in Heauen: must we not
truely account that the Affli∣ctions
of this present Time, are
not worthy of the glory that shall
be shewed vnto vs? And is not
the Lord mercifull vnto vs,
(my Beloued) that hath not
onely stored vp vnto vs so
many blessings (in our afflic∣tions,)

but hath also heerein
dealt so mildely, and kindely
with vs, as not to sweepe vs
away, with the Beesom of de∣structiō,
as the Powder Trea∣son
intended, and our sinnes
had deserued: but to weaken
vs by degrees, and to con∣found
vs in our carnall con∣fidence,
that so we might be
invited to Repentance, and
have gratious laisure therto?
The Lorde make vs wise to
see the plague, and hide our
selues. Is it not high time to
turne vnto the Lorde? when
the First Borne being smitten,
the next that succeeded, was
palpable Darknes: And then
the next, the red Sea, to swal∣low
vp quicke? Who so is
wise, shall vnderstand these
things, & to whom the arme

of the Lorde shall reueale
them.
For this shall I not cease
to pray vnto God, for you,
that the Keeper of Israel, may
keepe you from security, and
recouer the things that are rea∣die
to die. To whose blessed
protection, I doe most harti∣ly
commend you, in Iesus
Christ.
