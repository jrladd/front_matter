MY LORD,
THE Commands I received from Your Lord∣ship,
and the Royal Society, To prosecute
the Subject treated of in the Two former Books;
have produced This which follows. And I
humbly submit the same to Your Lordships Judg∣ment:

which must needs be Candid and Benign,
because it is Great. I have only this to say,
—;
Your Lordship will not disapprove the Enterprise,
although it falls short of perfection. It being the
result of Your Lordships manifold Virtues and Abi∣lities,
That You know how far to Encourage the
meanest Attempts; as well as rightly to Value
and Assist the greatest Performances.
London,
August 20. 1675. 
Iam,
My Lord,
