My Lord,
THat Great, Religious and Learned Prelate, the Glory of the West, Dr. Joseph Hall, then Bishop of Exeter, thus Remarks on the Man men∣tioned
 in the Gospel, called Le∣gion, The Possessed is bound with the invisible Fetters of Satan, and with the mate∣rial Chains of the Inhabi∣tants; what can bodily force prevail against a Spirit? yet they endeavoured this re∣straint in Charity, that he might not hurt himself; and in Justice, that he might not mischief others. Neither may the Spiritually Possessed be otherwise handled, two sorts of Chains are fit for outragious Sin∣ners, Good Laws, and Impar∣tial Executions; that they may not harm, nor be hurt to Eternal Death. Those Iron Chains were no sooner fastned on the Demo∣niac,
 then broken; but the Eter∣nal Decree Satan can never break; the Almighty Ruler of Heaven, Earth and Hell, has chained him up in the bottomless Pit. Thus it is with the Spi∣ritually Possessed, all Bonds of Restraint are commonly burst by the fury of Wickedness; Any regard to the Fear of God, to Civility, to a Dread of Men, to wholsome Laws, and careful Executions, are no more to the desperately Licentious, than Cob∣webs to an Hornet: Yet let these wildest Wretches know, God has provided Bonds for them, even Everlasting Chains of Dark∣ness: These will hold the De∣vils themselves (their Masters)
 unto the Judgment of the Great Day, how much more those im∣potent Vassals. Oh that Men would suffer themselves to be bound to their Behaviour, by the sweet and easie Recognizance of their Duty to God, and the Care of their own Souls; so that they might rather be bound up in the Bundle of Life Bishop Hall's Contempl. Tom. 2. l. 3. c. 5. p. 76.
