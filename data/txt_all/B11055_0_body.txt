HAuing bin at sundrie times moued right worshipfull, by some of my hearers to perticipate these my pub∣licke labours to and for their priuate vse, and that by coppies in writing, I haue thought it good vppon their importunitie, not in priuate sorte to
 satisfie them, but in publike maner to put foorth the same, partly be∣cause my leisure for so many copies will not serue, and partly because they which cannot read after the pen may take profite by the print. But whereas your worships haue been as it were founders of these my simple trauailes by your calling mee vnto you, being willing in such sorte, that I should be imployed for the benefit of the youth, besides that my other vsuall exercises towardes the elder sort. I haue also thought it my part to make you patrons of the thing, praying you that yee will vouchsafe the passing foorth of the same vnder your names with all humbly in the name of Christ, beseeching ye that as both of you haue the name of chri∣stian profession, so yee will together indeuour that more and more the same be made knowne by answerable conuersation hauing your faith, and a good conscience, manifested by
 good workes against the day of ap∣pearing of our Lord Iesus Christ, who will reward you accordingly, vn∣to whose protection of grace, and direction by his holy spirite, vnto sanctification of bodie and soule, I betake yee with all yours, for euer∣more.
