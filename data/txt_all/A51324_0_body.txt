SIR,
IT is not unknowne to the World, the great eare, ear∣nest, sedulitie & laudable custome that hath al∣waies been observed in all ages for the preservation of anti∣quities; by meanes wherof, the acts and occurrences of former times are so clearely demon∣strated, as if they were mani∣fested

to the world by a perfect and lively representation, which affordeth in it selfe a double profit, doth thereby al∣lure all well-disposed persons to the imitation of those things which are honest and vertuous, and to the evitation of such things as are evill and obnoxious, letting them ther∣by understand the happie issue and successe of the one, and the miserable and wretched end and event of the other: for histories are as so many Re∣cords and Registers of mat∣ters that hath beene already past, which being a thing that our humane natures are much inclined unto, gives a great pleasure and delight in the reading: Especially to

those that are well affected to the same. The consideration hereof hath moved me to re∣vive that which hath for a long time been raked up in the embers of oblivion. For there comming by chance into my hand a booke long since prin∣ted, the authour whereof was that famous and learned Knight Sir Thomas Moore, sometimes Lord Chancellour of England; wherein is set forth the short Raigne, and un∣fortunate death of the two young Princes, Edward the fith, & the thē Duke of York his brother, with the trouble∣some and tyrannicall govern∣ment of usurping Richard the third, and his miserable end, both which for the mat∣ter

of the subject, & the worth of the Authour (who lived in those times) deserves to bee memorized to succeeding ages; which having for many yeares escaped the presse, and by that meanes likely to bee utterly lost, I have thought it not amisse to put to my hel∣ping hand, for the restoring of it to the world; and because I know you to bee a gentleman that delights your selfe in matters of this nature, I am bould to crave your patronage herein, and that you would be pleased to shelter it under the wings of your protect on, not doubting but by that meanes, it will bee as welcome to the world, and as wel entertained, as it hath formerly beene,

which being the thing I wish, together with your pardon for this my presumption, I hum∣bly rest
