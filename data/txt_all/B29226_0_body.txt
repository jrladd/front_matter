WHen publick report, the great Intelligen∣cer of the world, had filled almost all mens minds with an earnest expecta∣tion, that by the advise and order of this Honourable House a Na∣tionall Synod would be shortly assembled, or at least a choise
number of the best Divines se∣lected to assist the high Court of Parliament, in ordering the af∣fairs of Religion in this Land; some (who had seen these little Treatises, and thought there might some good use be made of them, as ayming, in a moderate way, at the discovery of that com∣mon Truth, which all men ought to seek, and that in some particu∣lars of importance, which have of late been much disputed) did not onely, as formerly they had done, move me to permit the publica∣tion of them, but likewise to pre∣mise, by way of Preface, some∣thing with relation to the expect∣ed Synod or Assembly Which un∣lesse that course were setled al∣ready,
I know not how to do bet∣ter, then by craving leave of this Honourable House (as the great hinge upon which that heavenly motion hangs) to cast these little Treatises, as the poore widow did her two mites, into the treasurie of the Temple: and humbly to professe, that my intent is not, in any thing wherein I vary from others, to engage either them or my self in the maintenance of our own opinions, but with willing submission unto better judge∣ments, onely to offer occasion of consideration unto all, in some particulars, which otherwise per∣haps might lye belowe their thoughts. Truth drops not alwaies from the clouds, but sometimes
springs out of the earth, and at a little spark of fire on the hearth (if it be not with too strong a breath blown out at the first) a candle may be lighted for the use and benefit of all that are in the house. That I conceal my name is rather out of conscience of mine own unworthinesse, and a desire I have to avoid the very shew of affectation, then fear to fall un∣der the censures of any. For pri∣vate imputations, I shall let them passe, as going but on equall ground: but if publick Authoritie, either in the voice of this Ho∣norable House, or otherwise, shal stoop so lowe, as to interpret it a fault, I shall willingly submit my self to censure, thankfully receive,
and patiently undergo deserved punishment, and still continue to pray, as I do, that the Spirit of wisedome and understanding, the Spirit of counsell and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord may rest, and be so multiplied upon you all, that the issue of all your consultations may be such, as may give all men iust occasion to ioyn in consort with the Angel and the heavenly host in praising God and saying, Glo∣ry unto God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men: that our eyes may see the King in his beau∣ty, and Ierusalem a quiet ha∣bitation, a Tabernacle that shall not be taken down, nor
any of the stakes thereof re∣moved, neither any of the cords thereof broken. Which he that hath so long ago promised wil certainly at length in his good time perform, if men have but faith enough to wait with pati∣ence, that after they have done the will of God, they may receive the promises, which in Jesus Christ are, yea, and Amen, unto the glory of God, who is the bles∣sed, and onely Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, to whom he honour and power ever∣lasting. Amen.
