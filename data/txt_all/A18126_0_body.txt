My Reuerend Lord:
BEing heretofore moued for some considerations to pub∣lish this Sermon: I remai∣ned somewhat doubtfull in the Dedication there∣of, vntill the newes of your Lordships aduancement quickly setled my resolution. For where better could I haue im∣plor'd Patronage, then where both eminent au∣thoritie of Place, as also your Lordships par∣ticular fauour towards me, seemed no lesse enfor∣cedly to inuite by loue, then compell by dutie? For which respect I haue now presumed vpon your Lordships acceptance, trusting the rather to
obtaine pardon for this my bold intrusion, and also indulgent censure of these my vnworthy la∣bours, presented to your learned view as cha∣lenging the goodnesse of your Lordships dispo∣sition, and freely offered courtesie, guiltie of this my attempt, and a chiefe cause hereof.
The Lord God guide and assist your Lordship with the blessed directions of his most holy spirit, in the discharge of your high calling in this life, and in the life to come giue you the reward of immortalitie and euerlasting glory.
