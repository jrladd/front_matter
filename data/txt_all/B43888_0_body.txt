I Might at well endeavour to perswade, that the Sun is a glorious, and beneficial Planet; as take pains to Illustrate Musick with my imperfect praises; for every reasonable Mans own mind will be its Advocate. Musick, belov'd of Heaven, for it is the business of Angels; Desired on Earth as the most charming pleasure of Men. The world contains nothing that is good, but what is full of Harmonious Concord, nor nothing that is evil, but it is opposite, as being the ill favour'd production of Discord and Disorder. I dare affirm, those that love not Musick (if there be any such) are Dissenters from Ingenuity, and Rebels to the Monarchy of Reason.

Of the kinds of Musick, Vocal has always had the Preference in esteem: and by consequence the Recorder (as approaching nearest to the sweet delightfulness of the Voice) ought to have the first place in Opinion as we see by the Ʋniversal use of it confirm'd.
For the assistance and improvement of all the Lovers of it, I have with great care made this Col∣lection of the Best and Newest Tunes extant; and for the advantage of Beginners, that have not the help of a Master to Instruct them, I have placed in the beginning some easy Tunes with Dots un∣der the Violin Notes, by which means they may confirm themselves in the manner of Playing every Note.
