Right Worshipful,
COnsciousness of my own weakness sufficiently deters me from publick censure: therefore I should not have entertain'd one thought of appearing abroad, had not this discourse been made both a Chimney, and (as I may speak) a Pulpit-talk, amongst the froward Ene∣mies of our Church: yet, had they any thing of truth, and modesty, in their reflections, I should have layn un∣concern'd beneath them: but as it is their practice to load whatever makes against them (to speak modestly) with all the aggravations it is capable of receiving; so it is the peoples pleasure to imbrace whatever they say as Folia Sibyllae, articles of faith, or undoubted maxims of truth: be pleas'd to take one instance, I have heard several particular persons affirm (I am loth to say one of their Preachers too, who pretended he had read, and understood the book) that the Author of the Eccles.
