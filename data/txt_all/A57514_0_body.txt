My Lord,
IT is not with any Design to In∣form Your Lordships Judgment, by any thing that can be met with in so mean a Discourse, that I am in∣duced
to lay it at Your Lordships Feet: But being Composed under Your Lordships Roof, it Claims a Natural kind of Right, of coming under Your Lordships Protection.
Things of little worth receive a Va∣lue when they are made the Offerings of Respect and Gratitude; and this I am ohlig'd to Acknowledge upon the account of those Remarkable Instances of Generosity which I have received, (not only from Your Lordship) but from Your truly Honourable and good Lady, both before, and since I had the Honour of being Entertain'd as Your Lordships Chaplain; which I needs must own with all that deference which is justly ow∣ing to Your Lordships Eminent Qua∣lity, and Personal Accomplishments.

It is Your Lordships Happiness to receive the Extraordinary Blessings of Providence, without any Alteration of Temper, which can only be Attributed to a peculiar Greatness of Spirit, which the World is fully convincd of, and of which Your Lordships Family in all degrees are particularly sensible.
It will be a difficult thing for Poste∣rity, rightly to distinguish between those who have deserv'd Well, or Ill; since some have been so averse to Truth, that they have supplyd what has been really wanting in due Merit, by their many Flattering and Excessive Commenda∣tions.
But I need not take such Measures with Your Lordship, whose Accom∣plishments
ate so Signal, that they render Your Lordship, (in the Opinion of all that know you) one of the greatest Orna∣ments of the Age we live in.
That Your Lordship may be truly thankful to Almighty God, for so Great Endowments, that Your Lord∣shiy may live Many and Many Years to make a Right and Good Ʋse of them in this World, and be Rewarded for Well∣doing in the Next; is and always shall be the hearty Prayers of,
My Lord,
