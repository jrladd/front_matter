Worthy Patients and Patrons,
A Book sent abroad into the World, is like a Ship lanched forth into the Sea; It must expect not always to sail with the fair gale of judicious Censures, but sometimes to meet with blustering storms, raised either by the puffing blasts of Criticks breath, or the envious murmurings of the ignorant: From these two, viz. the seeming-wise Critick, and the grosly Ignorant, I can expect little favour: the one will cavil at the Rational part, because perhaps it doth not square with his Imaginary Fancies;
the other will deny the Rational and Experimental parts; and both will endeavour to withdraw the breath of people from it, that wanting the air of Reputation, it may be either becalmed by that little notice people take of it, or else be stranded on the dangerous sands of prejudice. I have there∣fore chosen you my Patrons, whose known Reputation is suffi∣cient to check the insolence of a∣ny that shall contradict or deny what your selves can testifie of your own knowledge and expe∣rience. And I desire that your mouthes may only speak my Acti∣ons, and let the world from them read my Merits; From whom I re∣quest nothing more than a kind ac∣ceptance of that which is intended for a general good,
