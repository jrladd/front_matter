RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL:
THe Proverbe is not more antient then true:
Tunc tua res agitur, paries quum proximus ardet.
When our Neighbours house is on fire, it is high time to prouide for the safetie of our owne: This present Age wherein wee liue, and the distressed estate of our Neighbours and Brethren in Religion fallen vpon them within these few yeares past, by the Machia∣villian plots of that pernicious brood of Incendiaries stiled Iesuites, gaue mee occasion to make vse of this Proverbe, and called to my consideration the present danger of our owne State except some course were spee∣dly taken to bring to light these concealed proiects of that Societie, which now wee may be assured they haue
in agitation against vs of this Nation in generall, and of this City more in particuler. Which thing I haue not found any so ready a way to performe (to the best of mine vnderstanding) as by propounding vnto our Nation a president of their practises of late yeeres, Vt exemplo alieno discamus, that we may see by their dealings with others, what measures our selues may in all probability expect from them. This president you shall find in this following discourse, wherein you may see as in a perfect Mirror, their Consultations for the disturbing of the States of Germany, taken aboue XX. yeeres agoe, their plottes vpon the particular E∣lectors, and seuerall Princes, discouered to that Nati∣on before their Councels were brought into Action, had that Nation beene either so wise or so happy, as to haue taken notice thereof in time, and to haue ex∣tirpated that brood of Vipers before they were grown vp to Maturity: All which, I haue thought it my bounden duty to divulge for the good of our Nation, that being forewarned, they may arme themselues in time against the growing Mischiefes, and to Dedicate more particularly this part thereof to your Worships in token of my due respect and ready willingnesse to doe any seruice to your Worships in particular, and to this Worshipfull Societie in generall, which may fall with∣in the compasse of the abilitie of him, who resteth till death, for the good and happy estate of your Worships, and this Worshipfull Company, a daily Petitioner at the throne of Grace, in the best prayers and indeauours of.
