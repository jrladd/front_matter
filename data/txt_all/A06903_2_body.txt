WHen with seuerer iudgement Ibeholde,
The customary habits of our Nation:
Nothing I finde so strong or vncontrolde,
As is of great mens Actes the immitation.
Whence comes it, that to immitate your praise,
Our lesser greate ones, (which would else neglect
The noblest acte of vertue) now doe raise,
Their spirits vp, to loue what you respect:
O may you euer liue to teach them thus.
Those noble Actes which gets the noble name,
And may the grace you doe the Arte and vs,
Liue to out-liue, Time, Memorie, and Fame,
That many ages hence the world may say,
You gaue this Arte the life shall neare decay.
