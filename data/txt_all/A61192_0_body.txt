Madam,
WHen I deter∣mined to pub∣lish this Dis∣course, Your Honour came first to my thoughts
 as in dedicating it to whom I could only ac∣quiesce.
Not that Your Ho∣nour had any speciall title to it, by hearing it or desiring it; but my hope is there may be more providence in it then my own, who am ambitious to seal up some testimony of the high esteem I have of Your Honour, to whom I am oblieged, as by so much Worthiness of Your
 own, so by many favours received.
Madam, I question not but you have your part in Afflictions as a Daughter of Adam, and not the fewer as a Daughter of Abra∣ham. You may have need of a Cordiall, and then Providence will be remarkable in sending This to you; and I de∣sire you may see your in∣terest in this Consolati∣on: if you be strong
 and feel no sinking of Spirits, it is through the Experience of this Truth which is here de∣scribed.
Madam, I have ho∣norable thoughts of you, and great desires on your behalf, and therefore shall no longer by this intertainment keep you from swifter injoyments then while I commence this suite for you, That, as not a few have born away the fruitfulness
 of your Disposition in the sweetness of their own spirits, so your Ho∣nour may be abundant∣ly satisfied and refresh∣ed from the gracious presence and appea∣rance of the Lord in all his dispensations. In this most humble ten∣der of himself accept, Madam,
