RIGHT HO:
You shall not need to im∣pute
it to any other reason
besides your vertues, that
I haue presumed to shroud this peece of
my labours vnder your Noble Patronage.
The world hath taken iust notice how
much the Gospell is graced by your reall
profession; whom neither honor hath

made ouerlie, nor wealth lauish, nor charge

thoughts shall be approued beneficiall to a∣ny
soule, I am rich. I shall vow my prai∣ers
to their successe; and to the happinesse
of your Honourable Familie, both in the
root, and branches; Whereto I am in all
