THe French Author in his Epistle Dedicatory, to the most Christian Queene of France, setteth downe an instruction for the more profitable vse of these holy Pictures, which I thought good to impart vnto thee (gentle Reader) the in∣struction is this. Before thou present thy selfe to the Royall Table of the Sonne of God, cast the eyes of thy vn∣derstanding vpon one of these Pictures, as first vpon the Tree of life, meditating vpon the nature, qualities, and vertue thereof, according as they are set downe in that Picture: another time vpon the Sacrifice of Abel, vpon the Paschall Lambe, vpon Manna, or some one of the rest: the which Pictures, with their Expositions, will furnish thee, with ample matter of spirituall meditation, by which thou shalt goe the better prepared to that great Feast, and after that thou hast attentinely runne ouer the draughts of the ancient Figure, thou mayest turne thy selfe to the consideration of the truth of them, liuely expressed in our Sacrament, and shall enioy thereby the spirituall delights ther∣of, so much more profitably, by how much this contemplation shall haue made the eye of thy soule more quicke-sighted and piercing, and thy heart more desirous of that heauenly food. After this manner these Pictures shall serue, as it were a peece of Tapestry, in beholding wherof, thy vnderstanding may take a heauenly repast; they shall serue also as an ornament, and holy preparation of the soule, for the more worthy receiuing of that heanenly food, and together therewith a refection of all the most goodly, and worthy vertues, which adorne a Christian soule. For this Sacrament containeth not onely the grace of God, as
other Sacraments doe, but euen the Author of Grace himselfe our Sauiour Iesus Christ, attended vpon with the magnificence of all his rich treasury. In this Sacrament euery deuout soule shall receiue light for her faith, force and strength for her hope and a continuall fier, wherewith to enflame her charity, seeing that it is a glittering mystery of the wonders of God, a liuely Image of our future happinesse, and felicity, and a nuptial feast of heauenly loue; shee shall there learne humility, the foundation of Christian vertue, beholding with the eyes of faith, the King of Kings there present, and yet neuerthelesse, clothed exteriorly with a base garment of the vulgar accidents of two sensible creatures, Bread and Wine, condescending ther∣us mercifully, with some abasement of his Maiesty, the more familiarly to communicate himselfe to his creatures infirmitie, and necessity. The Christian soule may there practise religious piety towards God, adoring Soueraigne Maiesty, in the pre∣sence of his holy humanity, vaned thereunto. To conclude, shee may there take a necessary viaticum, during her pil∣grimage in this mortality of all spirituall and eter∣nall riches, the encrease of which, she is with all diligence to seeke, that shee may be∣come the more great in the eyes of God, and men.
