IN reading of Epistles, written in diuers languages, I finde
them de∣dicated to such Patrones, as could iudge of their worth, and would
accordingly accept them: Some to men of great account; other to men of lower
Titles of honour, but in higher esteeme of their loue: Now finding great men
so busie in great Matters, that I should haue great adoe with their
patience, in troubling their leisures from imployment in more serious
affaires, and yet knowing my labours, in my Letters, worth the looking on, I
haue bethought me of such a Patron, as in his kindnesse will vnderstand
mywork, and regard my loue; which hauing found in your many
fauours, giue me leaue, with my seruice, to present my Book to your
Patronage: Each Letter hath his Answer; the Subiects are diuers, so is the
manner of their enditing: Hate∣full I know they will not be to any; good they
may do to many, that can aptly make vse of them: and for your selfe, and
perhaps yours af∣ter you, it may be no hurt to peruse them; how∣soeuer, at
your idle leisure they will saue time, and perhaps yeelde you pleasure in
reading them: but loth to bee tedious in needlesse Elo∣quence, I will leaue
them to your kind accep∣tance, and my loue to your like command: and so
rest.
