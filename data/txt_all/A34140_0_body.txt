My Lord,
'TIS Natural for Persons in
distress to flye somewhere
for assistance; That's a
Principle Ingrafted into the very
Being and Constitution of Men,
and in many particulars may be well
enough justify'd and allow'd; but
then my Lord, there is a very great

difficulty in choosing out the Per∣sons,
and Representing the Griev∣ances;
and truly, I'm afraid our mi∣stakes
in those Points have been the
cause why so many good Endea∣vours
have prov'd Insuccessful. That
I have made a right Election of the
Person I am well assur'd, both from
your Lordships Character of a good
as well as of a great Man, and Lord
Mayor of London: So that if the
things are well Represented, which
I humbly submit to your Honours
Judgment, and withal are Reason∣able
in themselves, and necessary to
be redress'd, why then I presume
there is but small grounds to suspect
the success. As for the Papers them∣selves,
they are indeed what they
pretend to be, the Letters of a Gen∣tleman
in Prison to a Member of
Parliament; who, if he had not
been call'd off from us, by a hasty

fate, had long since attempted the
Regulation of Bayliffs and Goals, but
Sir, this great work (tho there have
been some advances made towards
it) is yet unfinish'd, and the Poor
Debtors and Prisoners do now more
then ever, labour and struggle un∣der
the Wracks and Tortures of
these unmerciful Wretches. My
Lord, I need not aggravate the Cir∣cumstances
to you, they're bad e∣nough
indeed, and but too bad with∣out
it; So that as things are now,
the Regulations of Prisons, and the
suppressing the Insolence and Extra∣vigance
of Bayliffs, would be a work
almost as Meritorious as that of your
great Predecessor, Sir William
Waller and deservedly Entitle for your
sake, the Lord Mayor of the City
of London, to another Character and
Sword of Honour for ever. I would
not spend your Lordships time in

useless flattery, or Complement your
Honour Infinitely above 'em both;
only this I must say, that since your
Lordships Election, the drooping
Genius of the City is strangely
Reviv'd, and Men and things have
put on a new Face. But Sir, short
Books should have but short Dedica∣tions,
or rather none at all, neither
had I given your Honour the trouble
of this but upon some particular Mo∣tives:
Well my Lord, considering the
whole Circumstance, and especially,
the Errand these Papers come
upon, I cannot much dread your ac∣ceptance
of 'em, and withal, that
you will Pardon their Author, who
is, and shall ever esteem it a happy∣ness
to be thought worthy to sub∣scribe
himself,
