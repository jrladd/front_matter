My much Honoured Friends,
ONE reason of Publishing this Plain Discourse is, because I cannot now Preach to you, as formerly I have done, and have no o∣ther way left of discharging my Duty to You, but by making the Press supply the place of the Pulpit. Part of this You have already heard, and should have heard the rest, had I enjoyed the same Liberty still; which God restore to me again, when He sees fit, if not, His will be done.
And the only reason of this Dedica∣tion

is, to make this publick and thank∣ful Acknowledgment (before I am for∣ced from You, if I must be so Unhap∣py) of Your Great Respects, and ma∣ny singular Favours to me; which have been always so free and generous, that they never gave time, nor left any room for me to ask; especially that obliging Welcome You gave me at my first com∣ing, I mean Your Present of a House, which besides the Conveniencies and Pleasure of a Delightful Habitation, has afforded me that, which I value much more, the frequent opportunities of Your Conversation.
Though I am able to make You no better Return than Thanks, I hope, that Great MASTER, whom I serve, will; and that GOD would multiply all Temporal and Spiritual Blessings on You, is, and always shall be, the sincere and hearty Prayer of,
GENTLEMEN,
