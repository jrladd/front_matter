TO
THE RIGHT
HONORABLE,
IN NAME AND NOBLENESSE
Brothers, WILLIAM Earle of Pembrooke, Lord
High Chamberlaine of his Maiesties Houshold,
And PHILIP, Earle of Montgomerie,
Baron of Shurland, Knights of the
most Honorable Order of
the Garter:
His GERARDO and Himselfe, with his
truest wishes for all increase of felicitie to
both their Lordships,

Right-Noble, My Lords:
TRanslations (as sayes a
witty Spaniard) are, in
respect of their Origi∣nals,
like the knottie
wrong-side of Arras-Hangings: But

by his wits leaue, as the faire out-side
could ill be seene, without helpe of the
knots within; no more can the fame of
a wel-deseruing Author be far spred,
without the labor of a Translator. This
made me, for the present Spanish Au∣thor
his sake, venter to make him speak
English, and to do a publike good, by
publishing the morall Examples con∣tained
in the present Tragicall Dis∣courses.
Now, that I presume to offer
my weake endeuours to the view and
protection of both your Lordships,
I shall no way despaire of a pardon;
since the world, that takes notice of
your Noble Goodnesse, (the first, best
of your honour'd Titles) giues me as∣surance,
that (though a stranger, ra∣ther
then an intruder) I shall be estee∣med
