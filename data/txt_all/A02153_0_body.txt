NO sooner, Right worshipfull, was A∣lexander come to ripe yeares, but his father Philip presented him a booke and a horse; the one, to signifie his de∣light in letters; the other, his desire to martiall indeuours: Pallas had hir speare, and hir pen; counted as well the patronesse of schollers, as of souldiers: And Alexander forenamed, no soo∣ner laide off his helmet, but hee tooke in hand Ho∣mers Iliades; scarse come from handling his weapon with his maister Parmenio, but he fell to parlee of studie with his Tutor Aristotle; counting the profit that hee reaped by philosophie, litle lesse then the gaines he got by his great conquest. These premises considered, hearing how your worship in the prime of your youth, not onely delighted in martiall actiuity, but fauored the study of good letters, as a Moecenas and patron of such vertuous labours, I resolued, if I could not hang at the shryne of Apollo beautifull instruments, yet to deck his aulters with ay gar∣lands: and if my want hindred me from offering to Minerua great volumes, yet I aduentured to strew

her temple with loose papers, though my abilitie was not sufficient to present your worship with any worke worth the viewing, yet I presumed as spurred forward by the report of your courtesie, and fame of yout ver∣tues, to dedicate this little pamphlet to your worship, conteyning the tattle betweene a Smith and his wife, full of diuerse precepts interlaced with delightfull hi∣stories, which if they profit some, and please others, let them returne the end of both to your worship, for whome this worke was first taken in hand: but how∣soeuer it delights or discontents, so it fit your humour, and passe with your gratious acceptance, I shall hit th marke I aimed at, and so least I should shape Hercules shoo for a childs foote, I com∣mit your worship to the Almightie.
