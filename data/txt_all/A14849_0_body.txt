MOst deare and gratious Soueraigne, (be∣fore whom I bow in all subiectiue manner) I doubt not, but that worthy saying of Da∣uid a worthy king, is worthily written in the heart of your maiestie our king, Rabboth Ranghoth Tsaddic, Vmirrullam Iattsilennu Iehouah. 1. Many are the troubles of the righ∣teous, but the Lord deliuereth him out of them all. Of all the states in the world, your highnes, the onely great state of the world, hath had best experience of the truth of this point, your troubles, we know to the griefe of our hearts, haue bene many; and your deliuerances also, we know to the comfort of our soules, haue bene as many. This sentence of the pro∣phet, most worthy to be written, not only in sheetes of gold, but also in the hearts of all men by the point of a Diamond, was my text vpon the fift of August last past: which day was kept solemnely by vs in our solemne city of Glocester, to the Honour of your Highnes, and for the triumph of your bles∣sed victory out of Gowries wicked conspiracy. Since that day, I haue bene sollicited and importuned by friends, that my Sermon might be printed in papers, which then I desired onely to be imprinted in the hearts of my hearers; which be∣ing
done, I make bold, (if not too bold) to dedicate to your maiestie, as being your owne, for that it was preached on your day, for your sake; to your Honour, and by your subiect, who is your deuoted seruant to death it selfe. My hope and hearts desire is, that as Christ rewarded the poore widowes Mite, which was cast into the treasury of the Tem∣ple, though it were nothing in quantity comparable to the great summes of mony, which the rich cast into the same: so your highnes will respect this litle booke of mine, your poore seruant, though it be nothing to those great volumes, which are consecrated to your maiestie by the learned Rabbins of the land. The almighty blesse your highnes, and grant in fauour vnto vs all, that your maiestie may be euermore in wisedome most admirable like Daniel: in courage most valiant, like Da∣uid: in zeale most feruent, like Phinehas: in godlines most singular, like Iosiah: in care most prouident, like Ioseph: in riches most abundant, like Saloman: in counsell most sound, like Achitophell: in loue most kind, like Ionathan: in body most healthfull, like Moses: in minde most ioyfull, like Simeon: in raigne amongst vs in our English coasts, most long, like Ma∣nasses: And lastly, that your highnes at the last may be carri∣ed by the Angels into the bosome of Abraham, like Lazarus. And hereunto let all your subiects and friends, both domesti∣call and forraigne, say, Amen. And so vpon the bended knees of my heart, I aske pardon for this my boldnes, and rest
