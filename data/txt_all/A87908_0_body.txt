My Lord and Gentlemen,
IT is written, The prudent shall keep silence in an evil time; and 'tis like, we also might hold our peace, but that we fear a knife is at the very throat, not only of our and your Liberties▪ but of our persons too. In this condition, we hope it will be no offence, if we cry out to you for help; you that (thr ugh Gods goodness) have helped us so often, and stre∣nuously maintained the same Cause with us, against the return of that Family which pretends to the Government of these Nations. It is the publick interest and yours, that we hitherto fought for, and for which we now plead; therefore we insist upon it with the greater confidence before you, because we are all equally concerned in the good or ill of your transactions: We cannot yet be perswaded, though our fears and jealousies are strong, and the grounds of them many, that you can so lull asleep your Consciences, or forget the publick Interest, and your own, as to be returning back with the multitude to Egypt, or that you should with them be hankering after the Leeks and Onions of our old bondage. Though it were possible you should forget, yet certainly God will not, all the injuries and oppressions done by that Family to his Church and people in these and other Nations: Though the Inscription [Exit Tyrannus] which was fixed over the place where the Statue of the late King formerly stood at the Exchange, hath been blotted out by the Rabble, yet it is written with the Pen of a Diamond in the hearts of many thousands, and will he so hereafter in the adamantine Rolls of Fame and History. No matter then, though the prophane Vul∣gar take a liberty to proclaim him both Saint and Martyr in the midst of there Bon-fires, and their Tipple. All the good fellows were ever at his Devotion, because he was for theirs, and com∣manded it to be observed upon the Sundays. But to the▪end it

may be better known how goood a King, and how great a Saint he was, we have taken the boldness at this instant to offer you an ac∣compt of some part of the transactions during his Reign: & because there are too many in the City who wait the good time to re erect his Statue, we desire in the fist place to present you his Picture, as it was drawn by a good hand, the Parliament, in the year 1647. at which time it was resolved upon the Qustion joyntly by the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assmbled, That they would make no further Addresses or Applications to the King, or receive any Message from him.
