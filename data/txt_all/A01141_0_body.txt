AMong the Preace that to Your Presence flowes,
With Ioy-full Honours, as this time requires;
Instead of costly Suites, of curious showes,
Of precious Gifts, of solemne Panegyres:


Accept a Heart which to Your Highnesse owes
Whole Hecatombes of Happy-most Desires;
Praying, All prosperous to your blowing Rose,
In All, to equall, or excell Your Sire's:






That in All Vertues of a Prince complete,
All Princely Glories may attend you still:
All ehat may make a KING as Good as Great.


All IOSEPHS Blessings (from th' Eternall Hill)
Whose Happy Legend comes to gratulate
Your High Creation, and Your Birth-dayes Date.


The better Day,
The better Deed.


Look the next leaf,
And so proceed.
