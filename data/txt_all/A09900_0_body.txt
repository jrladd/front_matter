Which, if hee do deny, my comfort is,
my Shipwracke shall haue noble Witnesses,
I sinke not in a Ditch, nor by the Shore,
But dye and lye at Neptunes Palace doore.
'Tis thou alone that bear'st the Triple Mace,
canst, in the very speede of all their chase,
Restraine their pursuite; doe but keepe in awe
their nimble, neate Nereides of the Lawe;
Charge Aeolus (as hee does honour thee)
hee doe not dis-imbulke his cheekes at mee.
I haue done nothing to offend thy Traine,
rauish't Amemone (as the Poets faine)
Nor sought to rob the Sea-gods bed of Corall,
I meane Lawes mysteries: (For that's the Moral.)
If this be so, vouchsafe mee thy Protection,
that I may bring this Worke vnto perfection.
Then will I sing thy Fortune and thy Fame,
and proue, that Williams from the Troians cameâ–ª
Shew, where his Auncestors long since did build
a Seate, which hitherto their Name haue filld.
Now may that Name and Honour ne're expire,
but in a melting Firmament of Fire.
