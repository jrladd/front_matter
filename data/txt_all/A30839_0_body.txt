MADAM,
SUch always has been the Iurisdiction, and so Su∣preme and Excellent the Authority of the Fair, Noble, and Virtuous, that Poets seem to be cre∣ated for no other Purpose, but as anointed, to be the Voice of their Oracles, and to attend, and repeat 'em with as much Reverence as Priests do at the Altars of the Divinities they worship; to teach Mankind how to honour them when Living; and when Dead, to inlarge, and transmit their Noble

Actions to Posterity: And whilst the World lasts, this will be the most spatious and delightful. Theme, and will give the loftiest, and divinest Grace to Poetry; this made Homer sing, he that was blind, had ev'n that Inspiration; and BEAUTY from the Beginning has never faild to have more Adorers than the Gods: Nay it has still had such Power, that it has bin the Author of as strange Miracles; It has oft times made the Miser a Prodigal; the Old, Young; and the Coward, Valiant: what has it not done when joyn'd with VIRTUE? And what are You not able to inspire, in whom both excel; that Your Poet cou'd never be said to run on too lavish in Your Encomium? For Your Fame wou'd put a Blush upon all (as too mean) that can be said of You; and not accuse me of Flattery, if I cou'd describe You with as much Art as that rare Painter, who pictur'd his Venus with all the Smiles, and Graces of Woman-kind put to∣gether. How justly then have I heard the World ad∣mire at the infinite Happiness of Your LORD—But (pardon me, Madam) this is a Stream wou'd glide me insensibly away, and if I do not check my self, I shall like inspir'd Prophets, say Wonders not to be be∣liev'd, in such a Style as our best Poets have fail'd in. Therefore as one that is more a Plain Dealer than a Courtier, I will leave my self severely to be censur'd by all that know You, for not revealing Your Ladiships Character as I ought, rather then put angry Blushes on your Cheeks by an unexpected Assault of so many rude Phrases: for Virtue so delicate, and tender as Yours, is sooner touch'd, and offended at the hearing of its just Praises, than at the Calumny of the Envious, and De∣tacters; and I protest to Your Ladiship, I had rather

owe my Bread to Charity, then be thought to earn it at so vile a Rate; only grant me leave to Sail a little into the Relation of the Iustness, and Gratitude of Your Ladiships Fortune. 'Tis known that You are descen∣ded from the most Noble House of the NOELS, and joyn'd to that Incomparable, and Princely Family of the MANNORS; but let me say, by such a Miracle, that ne∣ver Day appear'd more beneficial to the benighted Tra∣vellour, then you o're its clouded Mansion, nor did the Rain-Bow (the Token of the Almighty in the Heavens, after the general Deluge by the Flood) to Noah's poor remaining Progeny shew it self more welcome, and propitious, than Your Ladiship to the despairing and almost distracted Family of the RUTLANDS, which after an unfortunate Marriage, when it had long wander'd upon the Face of barren Waters, You were at last dis∣cov'rd as a blest, and fruitful Land to rest its weary Ark upon, and it may for ever hereafter call. You its Good Angel that in its Flight from Heav'n first pitch'd up∣on the lofty, and most graceful Seat of Belvoire, whose Antiquity (which I hope may ever last) will pay you more Respect, and Adoration as to its Preserver, than it has done to its Founder: For by Your means, and your Illustrious Offspring, England shall never want a Branch that shall spread it self from so Noble an Original as Your kind LORD, nor be the least of its Glories that it can boast thereof. How much is to be admir'd the Wisdom of the Divine Power which made so Excellent a Choice as Your Ladiship, of whom it shall be said, that Atlas has not supported the Heav'ns with more Fame then Your Ladiship the tottering Greatness of Bel∣voire: And the History of Heroick Women shall hence∣forth

own you to be the Greatest, and Noblest Pattern of 'em all—Pardon me, Madam, I begin to fall into a Relaps. I wou'd not give the VVorld an Occasion to suspect that what I have said is but the Prelude of a Request I intend to beg of your Ladiship, which is, that you wou'd vouchsafe to accept of this poor Poem, and be pleas'd to let me set your Name in the Front of it, as Princes put their Arms over the Dores of Places they wou'd have Reverenc'd, and Esteem'd. I will not then fear the Wise Criticks, nor the conceited Fops that are as curious in passing their Censures on a young Poet, as your stanch'd Beauties are to one that is newly cry'd up in the Town; yet I doubt not but what You please to condescend to own, they will allow of. I am the ra∣ther embolden'd to petition this of Your Ladiship, be∣cause You are an Incourager of POETRY, and I have been inform'd that not long since in the Person of the famous Earl of Rutland it has met with the most conside∣rable Patron that ever was; and all know that your gal∣lant Father, the present Vicount Cambden, is the best, and greatest Protector of VVit, and Learning in this Age. How can I fail then, in my Address to Your Ladiship, of either an Acknowledgment beyond my Desert, or at least a Pardon for my Faults, which I humbly implore you wou'd not deny, and is the greatest Favour that can be hop'd by, MADAM,
