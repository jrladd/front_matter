Sir,
IN antient times those who escaped ship Vestimenta ma∣ris Deo, Hor. Ode 5. wrack, hung up their cloaths in the Temples of their Gods in signs of gratitude.
Philosophers call Virtues and Vices, the Platonici virtu¦tes, & vitia, ve∣stes animae nominabant. cloathing of the mind: Achilles has it to Agamemnon; Oh thou, that art cloathed with Impudence! The Scripture has it; Josuah stood before the Lord in filthy rags, those rags Hom. ver. 150. were the vices and sins of the people, as Interpreters say: The cloathing and robes of righteousness are often read in *Isa. 61. 10. Scripture. And the divine Graces are not made onely a Cloathing, but an Armor: Put yee on the Helmet of salvation, the Breast-plate of righteousness, and the shield Eph. 6. 14, 16, 17. 2 Tim. 4. 8. of faith: there is also, a Crown of righteousness. SIR, whatsoever Graces, Virtues, or Ornaments are in this Translation, I sacrifice them all to you, who has saved me in a double shipwrack. St. Paul suffered thrice shipwrack, and I twice: First, a Sequestration from my Parsonage: Then there was an Ordinance, that no Seque∣stred Minister should teach School under pain of impri∣sonment, there was both my hands tied behind me, and

I was in a kind of Hell, I could not get a drop of water: Sir, in this extremity I received many noble courtesies from your Brother, and you, and other friends of yours; for the which the Lord grant yee mer∣cy.
