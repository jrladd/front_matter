Right Honourable and Right Worshipful,
WHEN first His Majesty King CHARLES the Second, was pleased to make Choice of me for Sur∣veying the Sea-Coast, I then, as in Duty bound (be∣ing a younger Brother) did acquaint you with it, and most humbly laid the Proposals before you; whereupon you were pleased not only to approve of them, but did most bountifully Advance towards the Charge of the WORK, which be∣ing now finished, with all Submission and Gratitude, I assume the boldness to present these Effects of my Seven Years Industry to your Protection and Patronage.
If at any Time there should be made new Discoveries of any Rocks or Shelves, that are not yet known; or that Sands shall change their Situation (as often they do) I shall be ready by your Advice and Commands (by God's Blessing) to make a further Progress in this Survey.
I could heartily wish that it might be so ordered by your Corporation, that all Masters of Ships, both using forreign and home Voyages, might be in∣couraged to bring you in their Journals, and a Person appointed to Inspect them, which would be a great Improvement of Navigation, by imparting their Observations and Discoveries of the true Form and Prospect of the Sea-Caost,
 with all Harbours, Rivers, Bays, Islands, Creeks, Sands, and Rocks, and other dangerous Places, with the Settings and Flowings of Tydes, and Currants, with the Variation of the Compass; by which means, in a few years, we might have much more exact Sea-Charts and Maps; and for want of such a Method, we have lost many Excellent Discoveries, to the unaccountable loss of Navigation.
And that those Persons that make and sell Sea-Charts and Maps, were not allowed to alter them upon the single Report of Mariners, but with your Approbation, by which means our Sea-Charts would be more Correct, and the common Scandal of their badness removed, that God may prosper all your Generous and Charitable Ʋndertakings; which that they may always succeed the greatest Advantage possible of all their Majesties Subjects, is the constant hearty Wish and Prayer of

Deptford,
Febr. 24. 1693.
