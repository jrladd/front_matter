SIR, the Philosopher in libro Moral. 9. cap. 11. moves this question, , utrùm magis opus est amicis in prosperitati∣bus, quam in infortuniis? whether a man stands more need of friends in prospe∣rity, or in calamity? He wisely an∣swers, in utrisquè, in them both; in prosperity, for a mans society, friend∣ly councell, delight, and the exer∣cising his favours towards them; in calamity, or adversity, that from such he may be succoured, helped, or upholden, and defended. The for∣mer is more common, for who knows not, si fueris foelix? &c. yet the latter
 is more commendable, indicates more charity towards man, and shall have more reward from God. But tempora si fuerint nubila, are so cloudy and mistie times, that its heard to see a friend in them. I have read of many that are content to worship the Sunne-rising, but few or none the Sunne-setting; yet in this latter posture, you have bin pleased to remember me; therefore for such your friendship, I am the more obliged. A noble Per∣sonage (as you cannot but know) was once pleased to confesse, that he should accept it as an honour, if I would dedicate this worke upon so abstruse a subject unto him; but that spectatissimus heros excessit è vivis, and is now at rest. The next to whom for this worke, your selfe may deservedly challenge the Patronage, having la∣boured much to have it brought in
 apricum. But as the Poet writes of Poesie, Carmina secessum scribentis, et otia quaerunt, so may I say of Theologie. The taske was the harder, being un∣dergone, inter armorum strepitus, fulgen∣tes aere catervas, et crebris ictibus enses, fumantes pulvere campos, et rorantes san∣guine cristas. Yet, through the good hand of God upon me, even in these times, operi coronidem imposui: and because I know, quòd verbum sapienti sat est, I presume I shall not need to say any more, but that I shall remain.
