May it please your Majesty.
THE Portraicture which I am
taking the Liberty to present
at this time to Your Majesty, is cer∣tainly
the One of the rarest and most
curious that has been brought from
the East. All the Memoirs both of
time past, and even of this Country,
can furnish us, but with very few Sub∣jects,
which, If I dare presume to
say so, are more worth Your Attention
and Cnriosity; I need not say any thing
more than, that it is the Portraicture
of a Monarch, who, having the good
Fortune to Resemble Your Majesty in
most Respects, enjoys the same Ad∣vantages
in reference to his great Sta∣tion.
among the Pagan Princes, which
Your Majesty is possess'd of in the
Christian World.

The Jesuits, which by Your Maje∣sty
have been Employed, as Missiona∣ries
into China some years ago,
were not a little surprised to meet at
the utmost corner of the Earth with
what they had never seen before but
in France, that is to say, a Prince,
who, like Your self, has improved his
sublime Genius by that Greatness of
Soul, which alone renders hint worthy
of the greatest Empire of the Ʋni∣verse;
who bas the same uncontroul∣ed
Power over his Passions, at over his
Subjects, equally Adored by his Peo∣ple
and Esteemed by his Neihgbours;
who, as his Glorious Enterprizes have
been Crowned with Success, so stands
more indebted for it to his own Valour
and Conduct, than Fortune; In short, a
Prince in whom are center'd most of
these great Qualifications requisite to
makes an accomplish'd Hero, and who
would without question be accounted
the most Glorious Monarch upon Earth,
if his Reign had not been coincident
with that of Your Majesty.

It must be confess'd that hitherto
be is so unhappy as to be a Pagan,
which makes him uncapable of these
most Eminent Prerogatives, without
which, all the other Royal Qualities
want the most solid Foundation; yet
it may be truly said of him, that he
has made a considerable step towards
it by the High Esteem he has of our
Religion, by the Satisfaction he takes
in the Conversion of his Subjects to
the Christian Faith, which gives its
no small hopes, that in time by the
Grace fo God, be entirely united to
the Church.
For, considering what favourable
Inclinations God has been pleased to
inspire into his Heart for the Chri∣stian
Religion, by the means of our
Arts and Sciences we are not beyond
hopes, that one day he may prove the
Destruction of the Pagan Idolatry in
China; endeavouring in this, as in
many other things, to tread in the
footsteps of Your Majesty who have
made it Your Chiefest Glory, to root
out Heresie in your Dominions, and

to propagate the true Religion thro∣out
all Parts of the World.
Will it not be the greatest Happi∣ness
and Glory of Your Majesty's
Reign, that the same Arts and Sci∣ences,
which have been brought to
the highest pitch of Protection; by your
Encouragement and protection, should
be the happy Instruments of these fa∣vourable
Inclinations, the present Em∣perour
of China shews for our Reli∣gion;
and if the Chineses should be
convinced in time of the Great ad∣vantage
the Truth of the Gospel has
over their vain Philosophy, to
serve as a Means both for the Sove∣raign
and his Subjects, to submit
themselves, notwithstanding all their
Self-conceit, (in which they surpass
most Nations) to the forcible truth
of the Christian Religion.
These are the hopes which may
be conceiv'd from true Historical
Portraicture of this Prince; the on∣ly
thing I fear, is, that the Pencil of
the Painter has done considerable
wrong to the Original. But if all the

Lineaments are not so Nice and Ex∣act
as they should be I am sure they
are true; and all the Favours this Mo∣narch
has been pleased to heap upon
us, have not been Powerful enough to
induce me, to deviate in the least from
the Respect due to Your Majesty:
and Truth it self in so Nice a Point,
in which the Interest of the Gospel
which was never separated from Yours,
is so narrowly concerned.
