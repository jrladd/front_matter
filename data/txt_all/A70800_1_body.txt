SIR;
I Doubt not but that Your Ma∣jesty
has, from Time to Time,
been faithfully inform'd of what
relates to the State, Forces, Cu∣stoms,
and Religion of the Moors;
and indeed, what I have seen in

Print on that Subject, generally
agrees with what I have observ'd
while I was in the Emperor of
Morocco's Dominions: Yet, Sir,
Your Majesty's Orders, and what I
was enjoyn'd in my Instructions,
having oblig'd me to make there
some newer and less common Ob∣servations,
I hope Your Majesty
will not dislike, that, without af∣fecting
to swell the Memoirs,
which I now have the Honour to
lay before you, with superfluous
Repetitions of what some Authors
have said, I only should give, as
a kind of Supplement, such Ob∣servations
as seem to have been
omitted by them, either in what
concerns the Nature and Particulars
of the Trade of that Empire, the
Character, Manners and Genius of

those who have the greatest share
in the Government of it, or, as
to what the Conquests of the Prince,
who Rules there at this time, may
have contributed to the Enlarging
of his Dominions, the encreasing
of his Forces, and the heightning
of that Vanity that does not reign
less in him than the other Qualifi∣cations
by which he is so parti∣cular.
When Your Majesty did me the
Honour to make choice of me to
go in Your Name to conclude with
that Emperor the Treaty of Peace,
of which for some Years he had
shew'd himself so desirous that he
even seem'd to have remov'd be∣fore
hand all the Difficulties that
might obstruct it, in the Letter

which he had written about it, and
sent to Your Majesty by the Consul
of Sally, You were already con∣vinc'd
by frequent Trials, how little
his Proposals and Promises are to
be rely'd upon.
Accordingly one of the most es∣sential
and most inforc'd Articles
in my Instructions was, That I
should take care not to be deceiv'd
by them; and therefore 'tis what
I chiefly apply'd my self to prevent,
by all the Means and Expedients
that seem'd to me most proper, to
conciliate the Artifice of his Coun∣cil
and Ministers, with the fer∣vency
and fidelity of my Zeal for
Your Majesty's Service and Glory.

Even what I said to that
Prince at my first Audience, which
I insert at the end of this short
Treatise, may also convince Your
Majesty that I have not been spa∣ring
of such Encomiums and In∣sinuations
as I judg'd most capable
of flattering his Ambition, and of
inclining him to concurr with Your
Majesty's Pious and Solid Designs
for the Freedom of Your Captive
Subjects, and for the security of
Your Merchants.
If the Memoirs or Journal which
I sent to You of my Negotiation
in that Prince's Country, and at
his Court, have been read to Your
Majesty, You have not only seen,
that You had entertain'd very just

Thoughts on that Subject, but that,
far from my being able to remove
that Punic Faith so general here
at this time, or root out its Sci∣ons,
grown stronger than their
ancient Stock, it has not been in
my Power with all my Care and
Endeavours to shake them in the
least.
Here, Sir, I might have an
opportunity to repeat the substance
of many Things which I have men∣tion'd
at length in that Journal, did
not I fear this wou'd be too foreign
to the Design of the following
sheets, which, according to Your
Majesty's Orders, are only to re∣late
to the Extent, Government,
Strength, and Trade of the Em∣pire
of Morocco.

However, I think my self ob∣lig'd
before I begin, to acquaint
Your Majesty, that by what the
subtle Ways and Discourses of the
King of Morocco's Ministers
have betray'd to me of his Designs
and Resolutions, as to the offers
he makes from Time to Time to
Treat with Your Majesty, it plainly
appears, whatever his Demonstra∣tions
of Sincerity may seem, that
all his Aim and utmost Intent have
always been, and will ever be only to
procure himself some Presents,
Honours, and Supplies for the re∣gaining
of the Towns which the
Spaniards still hold in his Country.
Besides, as this Prince and his
Ministers know very well, that Your

Goodness and Compassion for Your
poor Captive Subjects, are the
only Motives that incline You to
hearken to his Proposals, there is
no doubt but that he is not likely to
part with those Slaves as long as
he hopes they may be a means to
procure him the Advantages I have
mention'd; so that 'tis not to be
expected he will ever treat but
upon Terms of this nature, and
his Ministers will always endeavour
by all imaginable means, that
the effect, which they think
they ought to expect in that
case, may precede the Perfor∣mance
of what they shall Promise
on their side.
There remains now nothing for
me to represent to Your Majesty,

but that I have taken such care
in examining what ever is the sub∣ject
of these Memoirs, that I may
well assure You they contain no∣thing
but what is most conform∣able
to the Truth.
I also make bold to promise my
self, from Your Majesties Good∣ness,
that You will the rather ex∣cuse
Omissions and Defects, seeing
that, by the Journal which I had
the Honour to give You of my
stay and Negotiation in that King∣dom,
where I was almost always
detain'd and narrowly observ'd and
where 'tis not allow'd to take Infor∣mations
of the State of the Country,
You may perceive how little I could
converse with those who might have
enabled me to have given a more

perfect Account of it, and such a
one as might better evince the Fi∣delity
of the Respectful and In∣violable
Zeal with which I am,
SIR,
Your Majesty's
Most Humble, most
Obedient, and most
Faithful Subject
and Servant,
