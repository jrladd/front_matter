SIR,
MY pen having soared in the sublime Sphere of your glories, stoopes now and pearches upon these branches withered thorow antiquity: not to abide here, but to rest, and raise my flight againe towards the Sun; on which fixing mine eyes con∣tinually I shew my selfe to be the true issue of mine ancestors: The sight is Aquiline, because it lookes upon the Sun; the quill is like it because it flies with the Eagle. Of it selfe it would stay among hedge, and briers; under your great wings it raiseth it selfe up towards heaven. I dedicate these rests and reposes to whom I de∣dicated my travailes. I owe all to your Majesty acknowledging all to proceed, both from the greatnesse of your Magnanimious breast, and the liberality of your Royall hand, my

rest, my motion, my vocations, mine imployments. The booke is little; the gift nothing, but the little makes the great to shine, and the nothing is the onely basis of one of the Creators greatest workes. I beseech your Ma∣jesty to accept of it, and in true imi∣tation of Omnipotencie, whilst with a strong hand you abate the bold at∣tempts of great ones, disdaine not with a favorable looke to raise the humility of little ones: God preserve your Majesty for the good of Chri∣stendome.
