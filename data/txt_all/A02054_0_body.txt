RIGHT HONORABLE,
I Know not vnder whose winges I might better shelter an Apologie for the Mi∣nistrie, then vnder your Honours, who haue euer liued a ready Patron to defend vs from the oppositions and wronges of our Aduersaries; making them no friendes to your selfe, that are enimies to the Gospell: wherein you haue procured some (blessed) trouble to your selfe, by frequent complaintes; deser∣ued great loue of your Countrey, and secured your Soule of an eternall recompence: Let it be your prayse, happinesse, comfort, that you haue (not onely not liued in opposition to the Trueth, as our refractary Papistes: nor in the luke-warme Neutrallitie of this age, that conceiues a mixt Religion, compounded of Syon's and Babilon's; nor thought it enough to countenaunce Prea∣chers, as some that would make God beholding to them for their lookes; but you haue) stoode to, seconded, succoured, and (which is

yet a higher testimony) relieued, many a distressed Seruant of the Lord, not with Micha's wages, or pittances of Charitie, but with ample Rewardes, worthy your Honour's bountie to giue, and their necessitie to receiue. Let all these true and happy reasons plead for, and (somewhat) iustifie my ambition, that haue dared to looke so high for Patronage, at your Honour: Worthier Pennes haue contented themselues with meaner Protections: It is not the ex∣cellencie of the worke, but the Noblenesse of your disposition, that incourageth me, who am thence prompted, not to feare your ac∣ceptation. You that haue been s generll Shadow of Refre∣shing to Ministers, take from me all cause to distrust your fa∣uour: specially in the countenauncing of that written, which you haue euer actually and really furthered. Proceede (most honou∣red Lord) to affect the Trueth, (yet) more zelously, by your helpe to support it, by your fauour to protect it: so shall you make blessed vse of that Honour, God hath heere inuested you withall, and interest your selfe to the honour of Heauen: and whiles No∣bilitie without Religion dyes in infancie, and is buried in the graue of Obliuion, your Noble zeale, or zealous Noblenesse, shall liue heere to your Makers glory, and the Churches comfort: and hereafter leaue behind it a neuer-decaying monument of Honour; which if the ingratitude of men should forget, shall neuer passe the hand of God, vnrewarded with glory. This Booke salutes your Honour with the New yeare: may they both giue you hap∣pie content. The God of mercies multiply his fauours and gra∣ces on you, and make your Cuppe to runne ouer with his blessinges.
