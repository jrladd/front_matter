Right honorable and right Worshipfull:
TO shew reasons for my Dedication of this Sermon, and my service therein to your Honour, and to this City, may bee expected by some that have not knowne me and my course; but they are well known almost to all that know me, to be such, and of that Nature, that if I should neglect this duty, the World might well crie shame upon me. I have beene above thirty foure yeares imploied here wholy, and within the Verge of this City: I haue received the greatest good that I enjoy in my present course from the reverend Ministry of this City. I have had my first incou∣ragement
in this way, from a worshipfull Society of this City. What I hope to enjoy during life, hath beene the free gift of this honourable Court of Aldermen, and of this Citty. All which are iust incentives to a respective thankefulnesse from me.
But I must adde one reason more, in respect of you my much honoured Lord, your Honours free goodnesse to mee at my first comming to Saint Georges in Southwarke, now five yeares since compleate. The free continuation of your love in some distres∣ses falne upon me in the interim. And lately your Honors unde∣served favour in appointing me to this Service. All these have enioyned me to this Dedication; which I humbly beseech your Honor to accept of, as proceeding from him, whose daily praiers, and constant indeauours, in the way of all thankefulnesse and dutifull obseruance are, and shall be during life, ever yours, as obliged,
