Right worthie Sir.
IT is so familiar a custome to dedicate books to some person or other of note, As he keepes not decorum with these times, that accompanies not the same course. The fashion at first (questionlesse) was propagated by those two pa∣rents, Affection, and Care: Affection, rising from the merrited good conceit of the Patrone; Care to preuent the malice of detractors, vnder the Shield of some more potent Arme. By the first, I deuotedly beare this worke to your worthie iudge∣ent,

as one whose imminent knowledge in matter of State, well fits a worke of such ualitie: and the thing it selfe, though I imagine it aboue the reach of short-armd detrac∣ion, yet your iudiciall allowance may giue it a more quiet passage. If I seeme ouer-bold in his sort to dispose it, Let my good intent (I pray you) excuse me, which like true truth ap∣eares nakedly in plaine termes. The Originall was in Latin, dedicated to the Kings most xcellent Maiestie; The matter such, as I thought pittie should be lockt from those which want the perfection of that Language, and yet would be glad from such a methodicall Picture of words, both to forme their dutie to the State, as also to manage their priuate in∣terests. Thus hauing according to my poore measure, yeelded the reasons for this my De∣dication, as also the cause which moued me to publish the same in English, desiring your pardon (if you should distaste my boldnesse) I humbly cease further to trouble you.
