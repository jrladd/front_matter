Right Honorable,
I Could not presume to present this unpo∣lished Discourse (in it self unworthy of Your Acceptation) under the high Patronage of Your Honour, if I did not know (by undeserved Experience) that as the holy Angels of God, which though they be called Principalities and Powers, and behold continually the face of the Lord of lords and King of Kings, our Heavenly Father; yet are of so generous, so noble, and so loving Condescention, that they joyfully undertake, to be Ministring Spi∣rits to the meanest Servants of their Lord and Master, and to be Instru∣ments in his Divine Hands, for their
Comfort and Deliverances: So Your Ho∣nour doth dayly imitate those glorious Spi∣rits, in doing good, with an unparallel'd Nobleness, to all such whose Allegiance and Loyalty to our Soveraign is known to You; proving Your self a true Imitatour of him, who though he be of all that is good the best, and of all that's great the greatest, yet delights to prefer his Goodness before his Greatness.
All our English Israel knows, as well as my self, the Eminency of the Place Your Honour enjoyeth in this Kingdom, under our Gracious Soveraign; but the Expe∣rience of Your Noble Favours to me, upon several occasions, forceth me to conclude, this height of Trust and Dignity becomes yet more Honourable, and deserves to be more admired, in that You are pleased (and that frequently) to divert Your Eyes from the sight and glory of the tallest Ge∣dars, and to impart a glance to the lowest Shrubs; like Solomon, who spake not only of those goodly Trees in Lebanon, but of
the very Hyssop, that springeth out of the Wall.
Sir, This poor Sermon, which I preached in the Audience of many Grave and Learned Divines, and which some Well-wishers to the Church of England and the Mi∣nistry, have thought not to be unworthy of appearing in Publick, in order to Disa∣buse many poor Souls, who by Recusants perswasions, do not only lightly esteem our Calling, but as if they were the only People of God, (and such they boast themselves to be) look upon it as being no better than that of the Priests of Baal, (for so many of them are pleased to call us;) and on our most Reverend Prelates, and the whole Clergy of this Land, as being no better (if not worse) than the Priests of Antichrist.
This poor Sermon, I say, I make bold to present to Your Honour, with all possible Respect, the best of all I can do being justly due, and devoted to Your Honour, as a small discharge of my Duty, and an hearty acknowledgement of my Obligation. Be∣seeching
Almighty God, long to preserve Your Honour, (after the joy of our heart, and the breath of our nostrils, His Most Excellent Majesty,) a Friend and Support to all such as fear God, and the King.
That as he hath called You by name, to be one of the Valiant men of Israel, which compass the Bed of our Solomon, he may be pleased to make You more and more In∣strumental, for the good of this Land, and the Service of our Soveraign; and fill You, like Bezaleel, with the Spirit of God, in Wisdom, and Ʋnderstanding, and Know∣ledge, for the Service both of the Throne and Tabernacle, the State and the Church.
For these, and all other Blessings, Tem∣poral and Spiritual, upon Your Noble person, shall ever pray, the meanest among the many thousands that are called to the Sacred Priesthood, and
