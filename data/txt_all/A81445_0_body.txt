MADAM,
YOUR Grace's Goodness to Distress is so well known, that it encourageth the Au∣thor to beg Your Protection to a Book which needs so considerable a one, being writ by one, who besides all other Faults, is Poor; which I am afraid will prove as infallible an Ar∣gument with a great many to Rail, as it will with Your Grace to Defend, if there were any thing tolerable in it. I could enter here upon a Subject that would afford a large Field, the Praise which Your Grace so well de∣serves:
But so many good Hands have undertaken it already, that it would be a boldness in a Pen that does not know whether it shall not be con∣demned, to meddle with a Work that is so well done already, and which I am so sensible ought to be so. It would be happy, if the Faults of my Book should not make it as fit, as my Circumstances do, never to acknowledge who writ it; and therefore that I may have something to own, that will be for my Honour, I beg leav to subscribe my self,
MADAM,
