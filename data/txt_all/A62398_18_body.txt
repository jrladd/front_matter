COuld my unpractis'd Pen advance thy Name,
Thou should be mounted on the Wings of Fame,
Thy Ancestors they were of good renown,
They being all the Lairds of Lariston,
Into thy hands I do commit the sum
Of Walter Elliot of Erckleton,
By Maxwels rage out of their hands it got,
And was possess'd by Cunninghame and Scot,
Now Providence has brought it back again,
To the Lineal heir of Elliots kind,
For Walter Elliot he was Adams son,
And Adams Goodsir was Laird of Erckleton,
Though they were suspended for an Age or twain,
The Lands return'd to Elliot of Muckildine,
He is the Laird of Erckletons Brother,
And Ianet Scot she is Muckildines Mother,
A worthy Wife she of long time hath been,
And hath fill'd many poor and hungry Womb,
She is my Friend, therefore I do her ken,
She's daughter to Iohn Scot call'd of Rennalburn,
An honest Gentleman, he was known well enough,

In Esdail-muir he was Baillie to Buckcleugh,
Who was son to Iohn Scot an able Lad,
Who then was called Iocky ill to had,
His Father also he was called Iohn,
He was Natural-son to Scot of Thirlston,
He was Natural-brother in the while
To Thirlston, Newburgh and Bowhill,
Gilmanscleugh, Hundelshope, and Kirkhope,
Were all Brethren to the said Iohn Scot;
These seven Brethren were stout valiant men,
They would not been afraid for other ten,
No more of Muckildine since Adam is deceast,
Who left them store like Iasons Golden Fleece.
