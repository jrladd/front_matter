MADAM,
I Cannot but apprehend
howgreat my Honour
and Happiness would be,
if by my Service I could
incline your Ladiship to
believe the real sence I
have of the many favours
you have so often, and so
undeservedly placed up∣on
me, nor have I other
returns to make but my
obedience. Truth is Ma∣dam,
my obligations are
such as cannot be conceal∣ed,
which makes mechose
rather to subject my self,

to censure for impertinen∣ces
than ingratitude, which
I hope will induce your
Ladiship to mittigate the
rigour of what censure I
may have justly deserved;
and by your example stop
the current of such tongues
as might otherwise criti∣cally
carpat every thing,
they see though never
so well intended. This
is the sum of my Request,
only that your Ladiship
will assure your self in the
knowledge that I desire to
be esteemed, Madam,
