MADAM,
THE Fair and the Young, the Poet and the Painter, are equally proud to draw; the Pencil, or the Pen, may be happy in those Draughts; but the Beauties of the Mind, not the Sun himself, whose light Paints the whole Scene of the Creation, ev'n with a Pencil made of Beams, can represent in their Meridian Lustre. The more they shine, the more

they are perceiv'd, the less can they be shadow'd; hence 'tis the Poet finds his the harder task to describe your Ladyship's Vertues, than the Painter's to do you Ju∣stice in your Person; yet, Madam, that Painter (if any can) who does you Justice in your Picture, plays there the Poet too; for the Sweetness of your Temper, the Sweetness of your Face displays. Instead of the rude sketches of my Pen, your Lady∣ship's Picture, prefix'd to this Poem I pre∣sent you, had been the most agreeable De∣dication, for that would give the World the truest Image of your Character: But doing your Ladyship that imagry of Ju∣stice, the Patroness would be read more than the Poet; the Reader would hold his Eyes  there, and look no further for Amasia. There would he find both Love and Poetry, both Charming, both Divine, and never regard the Works of the Muses, but gaze with silent Admiration on the Fairest Muse. Your Ladyship, the bright Original, Nature in all her Bloom∣ing

Colours has already  she has not only giv'n your Ladyship Beauty, her com∣mon Gift to the Fair Sex, and that in an uncommon measure, but she has given you a Mind so Charming, that your Face is a true Emblem of your Soul, and thence it arises your Ladyship appears so every way agreeable. As Beauty is best exprest in being seen, Vertue is so too; for tho' the Original can't be equal'd, your Ladyship may by your Conversation draw fair Copies in the Minds of others; thus may your Affability, Generosity, and several other Graces, which your Ladyship is adorn'd with, and adorn, appear Conspicuous to the World, as the Splendor of the Sun (tho' all Mankind is Conscious that it shines) cannot in it self be view'd, but may how∣ever be Admir'd in those pieces of the skies it guilds.
I am, MADAM,
