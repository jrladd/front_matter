LUcy bright morning-star, pure light divine,
Drawn from the Roman and the Norman line,
In every Revolution still the same,
Their Countreys Honour ad transcendent flame.
From this clear Spring I am a little Stream,
From this Apollo a derived beam.
Ingratitude unto that Root and Ground,
That noble Being, I my Being found;
Lamp of their Countrey, to their endless praise,
I dedicate these soft and humble Layes.
