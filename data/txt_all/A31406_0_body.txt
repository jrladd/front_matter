SIR,
THIS Sermon which was Preached at your request, is by the kind acceptance of my Lords the Judges, and of your self encouraged to become more publick. God knows my chief end both in Preaching and Printing it, is to engage all men, but more especially men of Place and Office, not only in a diligent and exemplary pra∣ctice, but also in a zealous and resolute defence of Religion, of the Establisht Protestant Reli∣gion, a Religion which above all other teacheth us not only to be Godly, but to be Honest; a Religion not only pure but peaceable, full of the good fruits of Loyalty, Justice, Charity, without Partiality and without Hypocrisie: And sure all sober and good men cannot but look upon it as their greatest
interest, as well in respect of this life, as of that which is to come, to uphold the power and honor of this Religion, which is so true a friend of Order and Government, so sure a defence of our Civil Rights, and which, if we submit to its Laws, and cherish its Influences, will make us truly happy, both here and hereafter.
Sir, if you had not been otherwise entitled to this Sermon, your Practice and Patronage of its Do∣ctrine would have made it yours, for indeed your affection to so good a Cause, in very difficult and discouraging Circumstances hath been generally taken notice of, for your Honour; and your Zeal hath been so well tempered and governed by your prudence, that our most notorious defamers have not yet had the confidence to touch your reputation.
That you may continue to walk in that name which will advance and secure yours, and give you a Renown more solid and durable than any convey∣ance from Ancestors, or any dignity which is deri∣ved from an Office of Trust or Power, is the Prayer of
SIR,
