IT was your MA∣IESTIES
expresse
Commaundement,
(most dread So∣veraigne)
that
this SERMON
should be printed:
your HIGHNES intention therein ve∣ry
honorable, that neither by misre∣port
it might bee traduced, nor through
obliuion perish in the ayre wher it was
vttered: but that they which heard it,
might record it; they which heard it not,
might read it; & that almight be satis∣fied.

This royal purpose of your Maie∣stie,
either preiudice to the question, or
malignitie to the person, will, I feare
pervert: for more largely and soundly
hath this Theme bin hādled, & yet the
labor lost in fore-stalled cōceits: & by
mē more popularly applauded, & more
profoundly learned, then my selfe; and
therfore smal hope that I shal persuade.
But be the euent as it haps, I haue, in
the meane time, discharged both my
conscience in discussing the point sin∣cerely,
&, I trust, vnoffensiuely; &,
withall, my dutie to your Maiestie,
whose vnworthy seruant I am, and for
your Highnes many gracious fauours
most deeply obliged: in which acknow∣ledgement
I will liue & die; and, which
is the whole requital I can make, hear∣tely
pray for your Maiesties long life,

and prosperous reigne, that you may be
(which, I am sure, your Maiesty desires)
a King of Peace, as in Iuda & Isra∣el,
your temporall state; so in Mount
Siō also, in the state & among the Per∣sons
Ecclesiastique; effecting in vs all,
both of Kyke and Church, vnitie
in doctrine, vnanimitie in affection, v∣niformitie
in obedience to your Maie∣sties
Supremacie, whether in matters,
either absolutely necessary as inioy∣ned
by God, or in themselues indiffe∣rent,
but authoritatiuely necessarie,
as Commanded by your selfe; in which
desire, rather then hope, I end and rest
