My LORD,
BE pleas'd, from your humble and most oblig'd
Servant, to accept this Off-spring of my Muse,
which I am the more incourag'd to lay at your Feet,
because it formerly had the Honour to be look'd upon
with a gracious Regard by the best of Queens, of late
happy and glorious Memory, before whom it had been
presented in her Court, if the ensuing National Fata∣lity,
had not, in the interim, unfortunately happen∣ed;
however, not to let it be intirely a Prey to ill De∣stiny,
I have, with great Care and Pains, at last, made
shift to strip it from its Mourning, into a Dress
proper to be seen by the Town, tho' it may want
that Illustration which the Court-Ornament had a∣dorn'd
it with: And therefore most humbly beg your
Lordship to make one Addition more to the many repeat∣ed
Condescentions and Favours you have conferr'd on
me, which is, to let it be honour'd with a Place in
your Esteem; and then I shall never have occasion to
value what Malice, Ill-nature, or any unjust Criticism,
shall inveterately expose to its Prejudice.

You are one, my Lord, that all Eyes are so much
upon, all Hearts so much inclin'd to honour, serve,
and love, and all Pens so oblig'd and ready to praise,
that, tho' my Heart be as full of desire to do it as is
possible, yet I find there is no place left void for me
to express my Duty; there is nothing to be said, which
has not been already, and perhaps too with more Ad∣vantage
on the Writer's side, than I have Partiality
enough for my self to pretend to.
There is another significant Reason too, my Lord,
which wholly deters me from the common Custom of
Poets and Dedicators, which is, your Scorn and Dete∣station
of Flattery, wherein you nobly imitate the
Royal Inclination and Humour of our Glorious Ma∣ster,
King WILLIAM, who never fail'd to shew
his frowning Dislike of that Frenchified Vice, nor ever
gave Incouragement for its Seeds to be planted and
grow in his Dominions: To whom I wish Eternal
Honour, Successful Victory, and Long Life: And that
you, my Lord, in reward of your Indefatigable Duty,
Care and Zeal for his Service, may always be happy
in the Station you now are in. The Blessing of his
Smiles and Favour, is the Perpetual Wish of,
My LORD,
