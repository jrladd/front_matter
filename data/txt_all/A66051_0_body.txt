My LORD:
I Doe here once more present
your Lordship, with the fruit
of my leasure studies, as a te∣stimony
of my readinesse to serve you,
in those sacred matters, to which I de∣vote
my more serious houres. I should
not have presumed to this Dedication,

had I not beene encouraged by that ge∣nerousnesse
and sweetnesse of disposi∣tion,
which does so eminently adorne
your Lordships place and abilities.
If your Lordship please to excuse this
boldnesse, and to vouchsafe this Pam∣phlet
a shelter under your favourable
patronage, you shall thereby incourage
me in those higher studies, which may
be more agreeable to that relation,
wherein I stand, as being
Your Lordships servant
and Chaplaine,
