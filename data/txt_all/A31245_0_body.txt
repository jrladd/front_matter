SIR,
HAVING been for some time no uncompassionate observer of the strangely unnatural heas, and an∣gry Ʋnchristian jars of Protestants one with another; I was willing to divert my thoughts from so melancholly a Scene, and direct my Zeal against those more dangerous Enemies of our Peace, Popery and Irreligion. I was willing to call off my

Native Country-men from biting and devouring one another, to unite a∣gainst those potent Adversaries, which are coming in upon us, through those wide Breaches our Divisions have made. And methinks, if men would but give themselves leave to consider how their hot Disputes about Trifles, expose their Religion to the seorn of the Hectoring Atheists, and Derision of the bold Incendiaries of Rome; they would be less eager about Cir∣cumstances and Modes of Worship, and more industrious in an unanimous Defence of the common Principles of Christianity.
I know many excellent Worthies have labour'd before me in this Argu∣ment, and adorn'd their Discourses with all the Beauites of Wit, Learning, and Eloquence; but yet, be∣cause Irreligion gains new Proselytes, and Rome swells big with greater hopes of once more introducing its blind Su∣perstitions

into our Land, I have adventur'd at the same time, to vin∣dicate the excellency of Christianity against the Infidel, and arm my Coun∣trey-men against the bold Corruptions of Rome; and tho I am not able to bear the Helmet of Saul, and his weighty Coat of Mail be too heavy for my Shoulders; tho I pretend not to such strong Lines, and nervous Arguments, as have been produc'd by the great Defenders of the Christian and Pro∣testant Faith in our Age; Yet I know not, but a Sling and a Stone, even in the hand of a Stripling, may, by Divine Assistance in some measure prevent the increase of our Enemies, and confirm the staggering among us, in the profession, and practice of our Re∣form'd Religion.
And when once I had resolv'd to ex∣pose these Papers to the Censure of the World; I at the same time resolv'd to make this publick acknowledgment

of the endearing Obligations you, Sir, have laid upon me. I must acknow∣ledg the Present is too mean for so great a Person; and 'tis a Disparage∣ment to so worthy a Name to prefix it before so inconsiderable a Piece; but your good Nature is such, that I hope your Affection will bribe your Judgment; and what your Reason disallows, your undeserv'd respect to the Author will not condemn.
I know, Sir, the usual Flattery of Dedicatory Epistles; but know as well, that you hate the fawning of mean Parasites; and had rather be good, than▪ be magnifi'd as such in the World; and tho I might expatiate in your due Praises, yet I will not so far trespass upon your Humility (that great Ornament of your Nature, as well as Religion) but rather turn my Panegyricks into Pray∣ers, That greatness and real goodness may be in you conjoin'd, and the Nobi∣lity of your Birth may be equall'd by

the noble Endowments of your mind. Go on, Sir, in your hearty Zeal for God and Religion; and let your great Example prevent the boasts of the bold Hectors of this Age, That they have Proselyed all the Gentry of the Land. Let your Dependents and Neighbours be aw'd into Seriousness by your strict∣ly holy life; and allure men into the practice of Religion, by your sincere compliance with the amiable Virtues it recommends. Let not the Infidel be able to say, That Religion is only fit for the Cells of melancholly Souls, and the retirements of the poor de∣spised Men in Black, who make it their Trade and Profession; but con∣tinue, Sir, a glorious instance, How well Religion becomes the most noble Souls; and that Virtue is the best ac∣complishment, and the highest badg of Honour. Continue, Sir, in your becom∣ing-Zeal against Papal Corruptions, which so naturally tend to Debauchery

and Irreligion. And if this Discourse may be any way useful for so excellent a purpose, I shall have great reason to bless God, for directing me to such a Subject, Who am
Honourable Sir,
