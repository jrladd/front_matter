ALthough I can challenge no interest in your Lordships fauour: yet your Lordsh, may chal∣lenge your interest in those fruits of my stu∣dies, which grew vnder the shade of your Honours protection in the famous Nursery of Religion and Learning, the Uniuersity of Oxford: which the more it flourisheth by the sweet influence of your

Lordships wise and mild gouernment, the fai∣rer and fresher Garlands of fame it still pre∣sents to your Honour. Since the Muses of Si∣on and Helicon chose you their Patron, their Reuenewes haue been so enlarged, the Libra∣ries furnisht, the number of Professors increa∣sed, the Buildings raised and beautified, that you may rightly vse the Apothegme of Au∣gustus: Vrbem lateritiam inveni, relin∣quam marmoream; or rather in the sacred phrase of the Scripture we may say of you, You found the Uniuersity built with Sycamores, you willieaue it built with Cedars: you found the foundations laid with Bricks, you will leaue them laid with Saphyrs. Yet the rea∣ring of these high and stately buildings doth not erect so lasting a monument of your praise, as the repairing the collapsed discipline, and reuiuing of our ancient Statutes, the Chara∣cters whereof were more worne out in some mens manners, then in our bookes. But aboue all, the safe custodie of that pretious deposi∣tum of sauing Truth, no way clipt by schisme, nor adulterated by Popish heresie, nor emba∣sed by any semipelagian alloy, is to be accoun∣ted

the Crowne of your glory, and our ioyes. This is that Palladium, which if wee lose, we are all lost: but if we keepe it (notwith∣standing the treacheries of Iesuiticall Si∣nons, and Wodden engines of Antichristian Rome) Troia stabit Priamique arx alta manebit. Of this our most holy and ortho∣dox aith, because your selfe, and your Noble House haue been alwaies, and are at this day vnder his Maiesty, a principall defender and protector, I make bold to dedicate to your Honour this polemicall Tractate, wherein I charge the Church of Rome deepely with no lesse a crime then Grand Sacrilege, and to demonstrate , I call in for witnesses against her of the best rank and note from the Apostles times down∣wara through all centuries, euen to this six∣tenth now currant. That which the Iesuites haue so long clamored for; and many, in re∣gard of the razing out, and defacing, and bur∣ning ancient records of truth, vnder the ty∣ranny of Antichrist, haue thought infecible, I haue produc'd a catalogue of visible professors and eminent propugners of a maine Article of

our reformed Religion in all Ages. And if my trauell herein, through many difficult, and vnbeaten pathes, may be thought profitable to the Church of God; I will proceed by the same line in other controuersies, as God shall inable, and your Lordship incourage.
