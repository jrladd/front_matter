MY LORD,
YOVR Lordship having signified your pleasure
that the Sermon which you heard, when you
did us the honour to be present at the Open∣ing
of our Parish Church, should be made
publick; notwithstanding my averseness to
print any thing in English, yet out of a just sense both of
that Obedience which I owe to You as my Bishop, and of that
Kindness which I have received from You as my Patron,
I have now done it, and herewith make bold to present it to
You. What Effect a Discourse of this Nature will have
upon the Minds of those who shall have so much patience as
to read it, I know not. But must leave that to him who
hath the hearts of all men in his hand. My Subject I am
sure is good and necessary: And as for my plain and pra∣ctical
way of handling it, it is that which my Text re∣quireth,
in that it commandeth that in our Christian Con∣gregations,
All things be done to edifying. So that un∣less
I had endeavoured to suit it to the Capacities of all
there present, and to make it as edifying as I could unto
them, my Sermon had been a Contradiction to my Text:
And besides that, I had lost my Design in Preaching it:
Which was, to convince those especially, whose Souls, un∣der
your Lordship, are committed to my care and conduct,

of the Excellency and Usefulness of the Common Prayer,
and so to perswade them to the constant and consciencious∣use
of it; not only because it is conformable to the Doctrine,
Discipline, and Practice of the Vniversal Church, nor
only because it is established by the Laws both of our
Church and State (though they also be very great Reasons)
but likewise because of that extraordinary benefit and ad∣vantage
which they would receive from it, for the edify∣ing
of their Souls in whatsoever is necessary to their E∣ternal
Salvation.
I am very sensible, that much more might have been
said upon this Excellent Subject. But intending no more
than a plain Sermon upon the occasion, I was forced to o∣mit
many things, and to confine my self to such only, which
were most obvious, and seemed the most necessary for peo∣ple
to know and practice, in order to their being reconci∣led
unto, and edified by our Publick Prayers. And if up∣on
your perusal of that little which I have said, you shall
find any thing not agreeable to the Doctrine of our Church,
I humbly submit it to Your Lordships Judgment and Cen∣sure;
only desiring that You would be as ready to pardon,
as I am to retract it.
My Lord,
I have one request more to make unto You, which is, that
as You was the occasion of my printing this Sermon, so You
would be pleased to accept of it, now it is printed: And if,
by the Blessing of Almighty God, it may contribute any
thing to those great Ends, which You continually prosecute
with so great Wisdom and Prudence, with such exempla∣ry
Care and Diligence in the Management of that high Of∣fice
which he hath called you to, even to the Glory of his
great Name, the Good of his Church, and the Salvation of
the Souls of Men; it is all that is desired by
My Lord,
