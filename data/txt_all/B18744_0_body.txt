SIR,
The little hopes I have, that this short Remonstrance, or any Petition of mine, sent or to be sent, shall arrive to the Honour of your view, makes me carefull onely to set downe Truth, and little looke at a Style befitting the Adresse. Your Majestie by the following discourse may perceive (if any Copy of these shall be so happy as to fall into your hands) the sufferings of many your faithfull subjects of Ireland, though of all none goes so neere me, and I beleeve the rest, as that by the Iustices and some of the State here, our actions are daily misrepresented to your Majestie, and through theirs and the Art of their friends in
England all meanes are deprived us, either by Petitiâˆ£on, or Verball Relation, to vindicate our selves and charge them. Royall Sir, were I conscious to my selfe, that I did merit the Title too frequently, I feare, given mee, I would not presume thus boldly to subscribe my selfe, what I am and ever will be,
SIR,
