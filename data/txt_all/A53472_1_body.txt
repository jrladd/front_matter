MADAM,
THe first time Parthenissa saw the Light, 'twas to
enjoy a higher contentment, than of entertaining
you with her Adventures; In which, Madam,
she told me, you receivd some such seeming, or
real satisfaction, that to continue the latter, or
to be reveng'd on you for the former, she has per∣swaded
me to present you with a Part of them.
This, Madam, had not given me the presumption of obeying her,
had not Altezeera also joyn'd her Prayers to Parthenissa's, and both
assur'd me, it would not be amiss that you should see, the Beauty of
one of your Sex has acted more, than one of mine could fancy; the
first of which, you might as perfectly know in your self, as the last
in this Book. That to write of you, is worse than to write to you,
this being but an injury to your Person, that to your Memory. (Though
indeed the former has nothing of misfortune, but that 'tis not as du∣rable
as the latter, which yet we cannot reproach you with, it being
our infelicity as much, if not more than yours) That I had injur'd
Altezeera as much in her Actings, as in their Relations; and having
done so much against her, I could only but this way, do something in
proportion for her; they further added, if my Writings needed no
Protection, they were fittest for your sight, and if they needed any, you
were ablest to give it. And though to all this, I represented, That if
their ambition of being known, Madam, unto you, had not entirely si∣lenc'd
their Iustice, they could not have believ'd a Crime against you,
could have prov'd an obligation to them; and that in my thus obey∣ing
them, I should necessitate many to conclude, I had an endless quar∣rel
to those which were the most perfect of your Sex, by injuring such
of them as are dead, in my Book; as such of them as are alive in the
Dedications of it. Against this, they enjoyn'd me to remember the
example of that excellent Genius, who presented you his Oblations
under the fair Name of Sacharissa, who was guilty of both those
crimes (writing of you, and to you) only to please himself, of which
they sollicited me, to be guilty but only of one, (and that also the least)
to please and repair them, and yet was not only pardon'd, but admit∣ted
the high Honor of your Conversation, But Madam, though I were

concern'd to say little against my obedience to them, the more to invite
you to pardon it, as being an offence of Ignorance, rather than Know∣ledge;
yet I could not but let them know, I consider'd that usage,
Madam, of yours, was only more and more to convince him of the
greatness of his Crime, and of the greatness of that Mercy which had
pardon'd it. That Cloud of Sacharissa, which some ascribe to his mo∣desty,
I do to his Iudgement, for thereby he was believ'd a perfect de∣scriber
of Fancy, whereas otherwise he would have been known a de∣fective
describer of Truth. Yet I must say, the greatest fault he com∣mitted
in attempting your Character, was his attempting it; for in
the necessity of his crime, he had this satisfaction, That whoever had
assum'd his Design, must have commited his Offence, and come as
short of him, as (almost) he has of you. For, Madam, you are
above being describ'd, which condition, though it be the most unhap∣py
as to us, yet is the Noblest as to you; and consequently we cannot
deplore an Ignorance, which is occasion'd by a Perfection, that even in
degrees transcends it. I hope a part of it will be manifested in forgi∣ving
a Confidenc, which is impos'd, and not sought; and has indeed
no title to your Mercy, but that is great enough for it; which though
infinite, cannot exceed the Ioy with which it will be receiv'd, nor the
Truth which presumes, Madam to tell you, that I am
