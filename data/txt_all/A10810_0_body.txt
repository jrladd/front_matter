IT hath beene [right] woorthy Captaine, their custome in elder times amongst some forraine na∣tions which held honor in regarde by all signes and showes of toy to welcome home such Aduenturers that for their Countreys honor and Princes bene∣fit had any way aduentured, not only dooing them all the publicke honor they could, but inuested them with titles of all honor, (such Customes) albeit among the vulgar sorte, it be deuy∣ed, yet doubtlesse those good mindes which honor armes, and their Countrey aduentures, attribute vnto them honorable prayse as they deserue.
Amongst many other (valorious Captaine) that honor your woorthy deeds desirous to register your noble actions amongst the best deseruing, as they woorthily merit, though my slender skill be not such as may deserue to register so notable and woorthy exploite by you perfourmed: yet haue I boldly attempted to set downe the same, that our Countreymen specially such as stand vpon tearmes of being what they are not, enuying the vertues and well deseruing. Aduen∣turer might blush to beholde what you haue perfourmed, through Gods sufferance and your politik and most valiaunt resolution: whilst they lye sweating one their easie beddes, of which I humblye craue pardon who intends well vnto all men but especiall bend my deuoti∣on, vnto such skilfull aduentures at sea, for that my profes∣sion is such, who am, and euer wilbe readie in all true zealous affection and doe you all the best seruice I can or may, when and where it shall stand with your good pleasure for to commaund mee.
