My Lord,
IT was my happinesse be∣ing
a stranger in this
kingdome, to kisse your
Lordships hands, to
which your noblenesse,
and my owne ambition
encourag'd me, nor was
it without justice to your name, to tender the
first fruits of my observance to your Lord∣ship,
whom this Islnd acknowledgeth her
first native Ornament and top branch of Ho∣nour.
Be pleased now my most honorable
Lord, since my Affaires in England hasten my
departure, and prevent my personall atten∣dance,



that something of me may be honourd
to waite upon you in my absence, this Poeme;
tis new, and never yet personated, but ex∣pected
with the first, when the English
Stage shall bee recovered from her long si∣lence,
and her now languishing scene chan∣ged
into a welcome returne of wits and men;
And when by the favour of the winds and
Sea, I salute my Country againe, I shall report
a story of the Jrish honour, and hold my selfe
not meanely fortunate to have beene writ∣ten
and receiv'd
