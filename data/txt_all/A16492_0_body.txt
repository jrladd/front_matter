HAuing heretofore (Right Reuerend) preaehed this Sermon at your Lord∣ships appointment, and since enlarged it (by your aduice) with some necessa∣rie additions; I haue now also accor∣ding to your directions, and by publike authoritie committed it to the presse, but not without your Lordships name; entreating you to vndertake the patro∣nage of it, which had not beene, much lesse beene prea∣ched, if it had not receiued encouragement, and life from you. And I the more willingly publish it vnder your name, because it is a doctrine of the ancient, primitiue, and Apostolicke Church, whereof you haue beene a con∣stant defender for many yeares; I doubt not therefore, but you will be now as readie and willing to auouch, and main∣taine this holy and authenticke doctrine, as you were at first to enioyne the Text. If there be any worth in me, or in this Sermon, to you (next vnder God) I owe it; hee
 then that owes himselfe, and his little learng to your Lordship, dedicates both himselfe, and his ple labours to whom he owes them; beseeching God to blesse your Lord∣ship with a long and healthfull life for the good of his Church; and so to blesse me with his gifts and graces, that I may euer delight in those good and ancient steppes, which you long haue trod. In these desires I rest
