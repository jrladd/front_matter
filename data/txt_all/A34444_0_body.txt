SIR,
THE Queen is Yours, so is Your Royall
Mother, an' though in some respects You
may again be called Theirs: yet are You
absolutely Your Own. I also by the Protection of
Your Royall Government, am Yours; Your yet
Living and loving Subject: and Your good Lady,
is to this small and else perishable Piece, by Gods
great mercy a living Theme. So all is Yours great
SIR. Accept I pray Your own. Which in my
Duty I here first present to Your Majesty; so as
that afterward those Your dear Relatives, by my
Dedications, may see their several Interests in the
occasion not neglected. It had come earlier had it
not met with some Obstacles, where may be, it needed
not; and been troubled with a modest expectation of
its Betters coming out before it: which being they
have not done, my singularity I hope will satisfie
for the lost opportunity: And like him that out of
Ten, return'd to thank our Saviour, be accepted for
being but one, and he not very well acquainted.

Calend. Jan. 1664.
