TO you, Sir, who have so well merited of the present Age, by the faithful and accurate ac∣count, which you have given the World, of the Primitive Times, is this Address presented, as a just Tribute from one, who professes himself a
passionate admirer of the antient Ʋsages, and for that reason a most obedient Son of our holy Mother, the most Oxthodox, and pure, the best govern'd, and regular part of the Catholick Church; who having no∣thing else to ingratiate him to the Wise and Learned, would make his Veneration for the oldest, i. the best Religion, a pretence for his intrusion; and I should be unjust to that duty, in which all the lovers of sa∣cred History stand bound to your charity to the despised (because seemingly antiquated) Rites of Christianity, which you have with a manly courage, and much gallantry asser∣ted, had I omitted this opportunity of let∣ting you know, how gratefully an unknown Disciple of yours relishes such instances of your generosity and care in collecting and preserving the scattered Reliques of the most reverend, and brave Assertors of the Christian Doctrine. And when I once began to indulge to such Sentiments, I was of a sudden conquer'd by an insatiable desire of
serving you; And though it may seem a debasing of your worth, which I intend to ce∣lebrate, to intitle you to the Patronage of this Trifle, yet I was not willing to baffle my resolutions, because I knew, that the meanest Sacrisice assumes a lustre from the piety of the Devoto; although here I should have sate down contented to have offer'd a poor and despicable Present on my private Altar, and never coveted the calling of the World to see so impertinent, and unbecoming an Oblation, had not the interests of Reli∣gion compell'd me to appear, when the more concern'd thought it not worth the while to stifle, and oppose an imperious Aggressor, who to promote the novelties of late days, takes Sanctuary in the remotest Antiquity, and would fain engage the best of Christians, the Fathers, to protect and countenance him, who by his close insinuations, and clandestine practices, is so ready to put a Masque on the Face of the most beauti∣ful Truths, and in that odd dress render
them ridiculous: while the Mushroom-Opinions, that were the Birth of yester∣day, or in former Ages branded as notori∣ous Heresies, must be recorded as the only Rule of Orthodoxy.
Sir, my thoughts were some years since fixt on the Primitive Christianity, and in the midst of my Design I was happily super∣seded by your more successful and compre∣hensive industry; and I was not a little proud, that Mankind were rescued from the impertinencies of my Scrible, and treated in a more satisfactory way in your exqui∣site and complete Collections, where the Heterodox and Obstinate, the Factious and Schismatical may contemplate the Beauty, Order, and Decorum of the Temple-Ser∣vice; where the fierce and brutish, the uncharitable and censorious, may be Con∣verts to the generous examples of that Re∣ligion which is pure and peaceable; where the ill-natur'd and debauch'd, the lustful and intemperate, may be invited to be∣come
Scholars to that Easter, who teaches Men to deny ungodliness and carnal lusts, and to live soberly, and righteously, and godly in the World. And had the Author of the View of Antiquity been so just to his own repu∣tation, and the interests of the Church, as he ought, he also might have found reason to stifle his design, and confine his Papers to his private Study, when your Apostolici bespoke the Press; for his intentions were thereby forestall'd, and his Reader engaged to be severe, since after the delicacies of such a Treat, as your Book affords, it were insuffera∣ble Penance to be condemned to Bread and Water; although were there nothing but the coarseness of the Fare to be apo∣logiz'd for, it were easily pardonable, but when it is both mouldy and unseasonably serv'd in, it cannot but nauseate.
To rescue therefore the ignorant and unwary, first engaged me to this making
my self publick, that such little arts might not impose on the credulous, and whatever was so stiled, might not pre∣sently commence Antiquity; which Essay could poorly have pretended to the sha∣dow of hopes of success, had not your light directed me, and the account you give of the Apostles Disciples in the three first Centuries unriddled many ob∣scure passages to me, so that this gives you a new title to my Productions, which if they may merit your pardon, and any way promote the veneration of those best days, and practices, will over and above satisfie the expectations, and comport with the ambition of,
Sir,

Sept. 10. 1678.
