THere needs no cunning Settor to betray
To his companions, when, nor yet which way
You are to ride, nor need the theeues be told
What store of coyne you carrie; they all hold
You to be rich, and certaine prize; beside
They know when from, when to, the terme you ride;
Great is your danger then; which to preuent
Peruse I pray what with a faire intent
Is offered to your view; if by whats here
(When you shall be beset) you get off cleere,
My ioy shall be, iust like the ioy you take,
When for your pleading, and good counsaile sake,
A poore man still in peace retaines his owne,
Who otherwise had beene, quite ouer throwne.
