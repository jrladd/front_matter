Right Honourable,
I Shall not need (as I humbly conceive) to seek farre for a just argument that the Dedication of this Lecture (being an Introduction to Cosmography, read in the Academy, which I doe zea∣lously labour to settle, for the glory of God, the honor of this Nation, the encouragement and improve∣ment of all Lovers of Vertue:) belongs to your eminent place of Trust, And from whose determina∣tions, as from the highest Influences of so many Stars, guide, direct, move, and preserve the whole Body of this Common wealth.
My Academy-Reader in part to make good my more large intentions, having begun with Cosmo∣graphy (as the most noble subject to read on) presents therefore these his first productions to your honourable hands, as an unquestionable duty, and with all Submis∣sivenesse, and possible reverence, wishing that the

State may please not only to protect these hopefull be∣ginnings, but likewise to cherish and promote them.
That all Lovers of Vertue may receive content and profit thereby, and the Nation glory, that such capable spirits need not to runne unto Salamanca in Spaine, to Padua in Italy, no to Paris in France, there to seek (with hazard of their godlinesse, goodnesse and Loyalty to their Native Country) that which they may have at home, with more ease and safety, and with lesse charge to themselves.
And if in this case the lawfull interest of a particu∣lar zealous well-wisher to the State may be compre∣hended, I shall with a joyfull confidence conclude, that I have not been ill-perswaded thereunto, nor can I have a greater hope, or reap a greater contentment, than by putting my hand to so good a work, which giving me an assured confidence that my indeavours may meet with a favourable acceptance from Your Honour, unto whom I shall remaine as I was long since,

From the Academy this 28 of Novemb. 1649.
