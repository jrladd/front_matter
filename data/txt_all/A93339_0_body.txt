Madam.
WHat I should have deem'd presumption, flattery, or self-conceit to have offered on my own accord, I reckon my duty to tender upon your request, being fully assured, that where the quick eye of your Judgment shall find a fault, the tender hand of your goodnesse will blot it out; and if you find many, you have Charity enough to cover them all. I never yet thought any thing I could do, either worthy the acceptance of such a person, or able to abide the test of such a judicious hearer or reader, if you should mind to be critical, and therefore should rather have run the hazard of being reputed rude and unmannerly in denying to transcribe the notes you lately heard, than to be convict of ignorance and weaknesse under my owne hand. But being fully assured, that out of a dear love to the memory of that precious Gentlewoman, your late dear sister, who being dead, yet speakes to you in what was spoken at her Funeral; and it may be also out of a desire to incourag me in the work of my Ministry, you have condescen∣ded to signify your good liking of what was then deliverd, I have taken upon me the confidence to give you the Sermon, as it is my Notes, & not as it was then curtail'd by the shortness of the time, & sharpness of the weather, which I here humbly present to you, and which I beseech you to look upon as a testi∣many of my thankful resentment of those many obliging favours I have recei∣ved from you. For to a service of this nature, no consideration but that of Duty and Gratitude could ever have moved me. What I spake concerning the sweet and precious Mrs Litster, you have to a word almost as it was then delivered, where yet I find my self in a straight, those who knew her not, will condemne me of flattery and lavishnesse in my expressions, those who knew her, will blame me as to low and scant, wronging both her and the auditory, to which I can only say, God and my own conscience acquit me from the first, my weakness and unfitnesse for a work so much above me, will begg, if not from others, yet from you my pardon for the last; Madam, How much of the comfort of my life, and of cheerfulnesse in the work of my Ministry I owe to Mr. Hartop and yourselfe; I have a deeper sense, than I have either power or opportunity at this time to expresse, only to what I have said, I add this, God forbid I should sin against him in ceasing to pray and praise God for you and yours, I humbly take leave and remaine.
Madam.
