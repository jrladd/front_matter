MY especiall good Lord, I presume to preset to your Ho∣nor this title trea∣tise concerning learned Know∣ledge, and the Teacher thereof: Seeing that as God hath blessed you now in your Childhood with a ver∣tuous and most Noble disposition, a louing and kinde nature, quicke ap∣prehension, pregnant wit, ready vtt∣rance, and firme memory: so if it
pleaseth his Diuine Maiestie (which I heartily desire) to grant you prospe∣rous health, I hope by the carefull e∣ducation of your right Honourable Parents, you will in processe of time attayne to excellent knowledge. Your vertuous, and right Honourable sister the Lady Katherine, may obtayne the perfect vnderstanding of the Latine tongue in very short time, such is the excellency of her wit and memory, if she continue as she began in the studie thereof. Good endeauouers, euen the best enterprises, by sinister suggesti∣ons whispered, or scandalous aspersi∣ons scattered, are sometimes hinde∣red. I trust your Honour will accept of this slender token, offered with as good a will to your Lordship, as the widdow did her small mite to the Treasury; or the poore man his hand∣full of cleere and cleane water to the Persian King Artaxerses. For albeiit
my body, against my will, is absent from you, notwithstanding my minde is with you, my memory of you, my loue towards you, and my prayers to Almightie God are for your health, long life, and perpetuall happinesse. So I rest
