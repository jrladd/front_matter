I Forbear to dedicate my Book to great Persons, who ordinarily take as little notice of such works as are addressed to them, as they do of the Authors thereof; and who make but small reckoning of such like Presents; not for that they are not worthy of them; but because they are now adays too much perse∣cuted by them, and in regard also that they are often either above their understanding, or disagreeing from

their Genius. For my part, I prefer Wit before Birth, and Knowledge before Dignity: and consequently, I had rather direct my works to intel∣ligent and ordinary persons, who will take pleasure to read them, and of whom I can revenge my self, if they requite my labour with contempt or detraction.
The conversation of these Walks, (which was not composed for every body, & which I offer you) is publisht for no other end then to make your protection (which you must not re∣fuse it) triumph with the greater pomp and splendor, and to exalt the force of your reason, and the vigor of your wit above the lownesse of its value, by the favour of your patro∣nage. I produce it not because the contagious fancy of writing where∣with mens spirits are now a days

infected, hath siezed upon me, and made me fond of being reputed and cried up for an Author; for I am not tickled with that ambition, nor have I any other motive to make me fall into this disease, but to be favoured with your remedy. If my Work were without blemish, and more happy then the rest of these times are, which dayly pass the censure of the Criticks, I would present it you only for the goodness thereof, to profit you, and divert you from more serious cogi∣tations in your vacant moments. But in regard that in all Ages there was never any great man who escapt the rigor of censure, and who hath not been in some kinde obscured in History: I have reason to procure it as many Patrons and Readers as I can, and such also as may be as zealous for my reputation, as they

are necessary for my weakness: Besides that indeed, the bonour I bear you, obliges me to do it, as much as the advantage I expect from your prote∣ction: For were you to combate none but mean persons, both in judgement and condition, your victory would be more prejudicial then glorious: But now all the Grandees of the Kingdom are as much in love with Minerva, as they were wont to be with Mars; and are as good at the Pen, as they are at the Sword: So that by sustain∣ing my cause, you will be constrained (if I be reproved) to oppose the di∣versity of their opinions who produce most admirable and sublime conceits; and I shall be the object of the quaint∣ness of your wits; the vigor and sub∣tility whereof will (I hope)  as victoriously forth against a multitude of illustrious and competent Judges,

as against the Cabal of pertinatious and fastidious Criticks. I have recourse therefore to you, both for your interest and mine, in confidence of your civility and sufficiency, if you read (as I hope you will) this Letter I send you: For ingenious and prudent men read a book from the beginning; but fools and dunses conceive that the Liminary Epistles of all Books are alike, and have not the curiosity to look upon the soul of an Author; however it be that indeed, by which he discovers what he is, rather then by all the elegancy and substance of his writings: And though the number of them who make books be infinite, and their wits but very indifferent, yet do they write very differently, and by different motions: For, some do it for their own satis∣faction; others, for that of the pub∣lique;

some again, for profit and subsistance; and most of them all, by a motion of vanity, and desire of re∣putation. These last hold themselves to be accomplisht wits, and think it to be the property of sublime intelli∣gences, to communicate and divulge themselves, thereby to receive the re∣flexion, and procure a testimony that they live with some credit in mens minds; as if forsooth, the reputation of a true man of honour were to be∣come a Book, and be exposed to the humor of every Cock-brain'd Sot, who will despise and deride it, when he ought to cherish and esteem it. As for me, Readers, none of these motives, but a better design obliged me to Pen this Conversation; as the love and delight of my Neighbour in the first place, and in regard that a well regulated affection begins alwaies at

home, I did it both to benefit and divert my self with these reflexions. Now the better to illuminate, and in∣form you of my subject, know, that I give you in these Entertainments, a Man of Honour, or a Compleat Man, Incognito, and so much dis∣guised, that my self who masked him, have much a do to know him. It is but a Fragment and relick of the in∣structions which I gave my Son; and if you will vouch safe to make some deliberation upon these little dis∣courses which I have drawn from thence, (and which make no unplea∣sant medly) you will find it to be a perfect model to form a True man of Honour, and that the use and application thereof will not be wholly unfruitful. But, fearing least I should fall short of such Authors as have gone before me, both in the production

and dispensation of so necessary a doctrine, as that which treats of a Man of Honour; I decline the waies wherein they walkt, by huddling up things and matters in an agreeable confusion; and the better to delight you with a handsome variety, I for∣bear to present you with raw, rough, and indigested Precepts, as I did my Son; however it be also true that I followed some kinde of order in the documents I gave him, and that to instruct him with the better judge∣ment, and facilitate his advantage, I coucht them with regularity, and drest them with good language, and not with such gibbridge as I now offer them to you. I can easily shew you how to observe both this order, and the instructions I gave my Son; the Principal whereof was to call upon God in all his actions; to wor∣ship

his Oracles in the mouths of his Anointed, (who are the gifts of Heaven;) to reverence and submit to the Mysteries of Faith; and not to scoff at Divine things, as Atheists and Libertines do. I can (I say) make you touch with your finger all such other documents of gallantry, both in Court and Camp, as are any way important and necessary to form a Man of Honour, by directing you in the Margent to the most essential Precepts thereof: But you will not have so little curiosity and prudence as to pass through this Walk without observing the rarities; nor will you be so much obstructed with Rheum, but that you will be able to smell the Roses which are in it, yea and pluck some of them too. You will perad∣venture finde it strange, that I cele∣brate not mine own praises, nor those

of my book, according to the custome of some Wits of the Times: but, besides that you know that it is un∣handsome for any man so to do: Of two important and remarkable Pre∣cepts of antiquity, (the one to know ones self, and the other to make ones self known by speaking,) I prefer the bumility of the former; (where as others serve themselves of the va∣nity of the latter, to publish their pride;) and to make a right use of the latter, I always consider well both what I say, and what I do: For as on the one side I should be loth to have men say that my writings are full of vanity; that I am a fool; or that all my Rules are false; so am I no less glad on the other, to have ull the falsity fall to the Criticks share, (if they make anill judgement of me) rather then one verity against

this opinion should be found, either in my tongue or Pen; and especially in the latter, if I should chance to be so weak, as to be taken tripping in the former: For I am not of the humor of the greatest part of writers, who not hoping to attain an advan∣tagious judgement of their works, presume to forge Apologiesfor them∣selves, and put them into their Pre∣faces, and (like silly and ill-favor'd women, who kiss the Pensil which flatters them) either beg or hire some good pen to write in their behalf, without considering that the honour redounds to the Author, and not to them; according to those great Artists of antiquity, who wishing that all the reputation of their work might be ascribed to their ability, employed the best of their capacity, and the ex∣cellency of their Art upon the weakest

and meanest subjects, to make it the more estimable and famous to Poste∣rity. Nor am I of the humor of them who finding none to praise them so much as they desire, endeavour to blind the world, by audaciously bor∣rowing the names of their friends, to set forth the imaginary elegancies of their writings, and the qualities which they fancy themselves to pos∣sess: And I vow to you Readers, that I cannot but blush for shame when I read such Epistles of this kind, as are directed to you; nor do I feed my fancy as they do, who often lye beyond pro∣bability, and are as well satisfied therewith, as Lovers are when they have dreamt that they have lain with their Mistresseses, though there be no such matter: For as these men enjoy their Loves but in conceit; so those take Bristol-stones for fine

Diamonds; and the first and rough draught, for the perfection of a Picture; insomuch as that they forfeit the ornaments of Eloquence, by seeking them with so much vio∣lence; for since Nature is against them, it is in vain for them to labour to purchase the unperceivable address of Art. Some who conceive themselves to be the greatest Masters of this Pro∣fession, and who think they have found the secret of well writing, and of pleasing the whole world, are prone to gull and flatter themselves with the opinion that they are the sove∣reign Judges of Parnassus, (though without right or reason;) & so become the Adorers and Panegyrists of their own productions; but they tire out Rhetorick to no purpose, and unsuc∣cesfully extend themselves, together with the secrets of the Art, upon the

praises they pretend to have acquir'd, though the noise of their writings (which is heard by none but them∣selves) be no greater then that which they would make by scrunching of a piece of Pye-crust; and they ground their reputation upon the fine Apo∣logies they make for themselves, as being sure enough that no body else would undertake to praise them: And indeed they have reason to do so, since it is necessary for dubious and impro∣bable things to be thus supported; whereas on the other side, such as are certain, need no other prop then that which they have from themselves, and from the truth of their own essence. Therefore the certainty of this so just and well-grounded discourse, keeps me far enough from ascribing any esteem to what I do; because fame is better confin'd to

fower words of value, from an im∣partial and judicious person, then to the amplest and most elaborate Pane∣gyricks, the most confirmative Elo∣gies, and the most authentical atte∣stations, which have but the least supposition or savour of complacency and self-love: For these things are always unfaithful to them who trust in them, unless they be sustained by the testimony of others, and by the support of truth; without which two props all reputations must needs be dissipated and adulterated; they be∣ing to them as the Oak to the Ivy, to hold them up. One only suspetion (though ill grounded) abates the value of the noblest things; and that is pride, the least itch whereof is always fatal, if too much stirred. But men will tell me that all gallant persons are infected with ambition; that reputation is a ticklish thing;

and that the love of Eloquence, which gives this passion of honour to Ora∣tors, is very charming and desirable; I grant it: But who is he, that effe∣ctively enjoys that Goddess, as he conceives he does? And who is he that as truly, and perfectly possesses, as he easily fancies he doth, that tou∣ching beauty, whose sweet and potent Empire reigns with sovereignty, over Rational Souls; and whose charms are so attractive, that the most bar∣barous spirit cannot resist them? He who were able to govern her peace∣fully alone, might call himselfe happy, and worthy of great honour, for his ambition would be fully satis∣fied, and his reputation advantagi∣ously establisht. But we must have Diogenes's Lanthorn to find him, and cry aloud with the Oblivious, Where is he? For I know but few Writers in France who can pretend

to this advantage, and it may be there are not many more; I mean Monsieur de Scudery, and Monsieur de Balzac, (both famous for their merits and their Divine Writings) and some others of their Class; who have indeed all right to this pretention, and deservedly wear the Lawrel for their praeheminencie therein: But it would be to no purpose to nominate them all particulary; for their works have illu∣strated their names, with such resplen∣dent attributes, and titles (which are called in Rhetorick Anchonomasies) that they are easie enough to be known. Greece hath ever abounded with fair Women; witness Queen Helen, whose beauty, so much cele∣brated by antiquity, and so much admir'd by all the world in History, set all the Orient on fire, by the de∣struction of one City: But let Homer

sing as much as he pleases of the ex∣cellency of this beauty, by the revo∣lutions of her effects, and do what he can, to make us admire and adore her; for my part, I say still, that there came a much rarer miracle of perfection out of his Country, then she; I mean Eloquence, which hath kindled love and fire in all the Nati∣ons upon earth, and which merited at least, as well as his Helen, a History for her heauty; where as yet, we have but some pictures, of the tender and lively passions, of the great Ma∣sters thereof. This Grecian Girle, or this Heavenly Girle, (incom∣parably more charming then King Priams Daughter-in-Law) which captivates the most determinate, and most resolute spirits, and inspires them with a certain kind of love, which understands reason, and guides it self by it: This fair Girle, I say,

came to dwell, and set up an Academy at Parnassus, where she had a world of Courtiers, and Suitors: But not being satisfied with these alone, she went to travel up and down the world, and endeavour'd to spread her Original, upon all the tongues which had her Copie: For the ancient Latins, who passionately loved for∣reign beauties (as their successors still do) stay'd her, as she past through Rome, and became her Amorous Ido∣laters; and indeed, by their cares and services, they received great favors, and most secret carresses from her: But she being of an in∣constant and light humor, and fond of variety, after she had once cloy'd her self with them, bid them farewell, and went on to see, and be seen, in the rest of the world. Wherefore it is not for any of our Frenchmen to think that they have gotten the vir∣ginity

of this fair Lady of pleasure, howbeit some flatterers have endea∣voured to chowce, and fool them with that opinion, and have served them, as those women use to do, who sell their Wenches Maidenheads a hun∣dred times over: For, if they have any smack of good learning (as I think they have) and any skill in Languages, they know well enough, (against the sentence of a famous Author, who says, That it is im∣possible for an old Woman to be handsome) that Eloquence is a handsome, and old Curtizan, which hath as much of the Sensitive Soul, as of the Rational; that all the world hath had to do with her, and that never any body enjoy'd her alone; that Caefar carried her into the Camp; that Cicero ushered her throughout the whole Roman Empire; and that before these, Isocrates, with

his swavity; Demosthenes, with his vehemency, and many other Au∣thors carried her all over Greece. So that these Gallants ought not to conceive themselves, to have found the Bean in the Cake, and swagger, and crack, of an imaginary good fortune. For my part, I go a quite contrary way to work, being far from this presumprion, and instead of praising my self, I intreat you my Readers, to excuse the faults, which you shall find in my Books; I mean, as well those, which may be directly imputed to me, as those of the Corre∣ctors of the Press; in regard I have freely and absolutely committed the Copy to their disposal, in case my friends at Court (who are some of those famous, and quaint Wits, which composed the Academy, and were the delights of the greatest man that ever was) should approve, and

like of it. But fearing least all the faults you may find in them, should leave some ill impression upon you, (as poyson doth when we have toucht it) and to banish the bad opinion you may retain of them otherwise (without taking notice of these petty foppe∣ries) I conjure you, to break the bone, when you have pickt it, take out the Marrow, and make your profit of such matters as will divert you. I caused this first Edition to be Printed in a small volume, for your conveni∣ency; to the end that making it your Pocket-Companion, you might re∣create your selves with it, either in Coach or Chair, and chiefly in Walks, because it hath Entertainments for its Design; and the Cours, for its Scaene: And I also will'd it to be done, without the embellishment of great Letters, and Flourishes; to the end that the vogue, and value of

the Work, might be due to nothing but its own goodness, and merit (if it have any) without the help of su∣perficial dress, and ornament. I presume not to make you any great present, in the Form; nor expect any thanks from you, for the Matter, because I appear Anonymous, and disguised to the world, as being clad in paper: But to let you see, that I thank you for your Complement, and for your praise, (without receiving either the one, or the other) I have oppugn'd the desire of some Courtiers of new Books, and laught at them, for that they would not only have me qualifie this Work with my Name, but make my self yet more ridiculous, by putting my picture also in it; in order to which, you shall see how prettily they went to work with me; for, some of them told me, that I must get my self drawn in Iron, because I

had born Arms, and shewed my self in the Field; others, that since I was now grown a Gown-man, and a Counsellor, I should do well to be drawn in a long Gown, with a Book in my hand, and a Bonnet upon the table, and consequently insert my Letters of Doctorate, and my recep∣tion into Parlament. But one of my friends (who is a notable Crack indeed) went farther, and shew'd me, that the quality of an Author (which I had) was to be preferred before all that, and that I ought to cause my self to be engraven in brass, in the Frontispiece of my Booke, mantled with certain unknown Cha∣racters, (which might be taken for Prophesies) crown'd with Lawrel, like a Roman Emperor, or with Vervain, like Lucians Demy-gods, and barb'd, and caparrison'd stark naked, like an Hero; (That is, to

put a Half-Corslet, and a Coat of Armor upon my bare body) and that if my Book were carried to the Nor∣thern Countreys, my Picture would take cold in its arms, as having them naked a hands-breadth above the elbow, and that the winds (which are so violent in those parts) would blow off my Crown from my head. Thus (said this wag) must an Author be set out in his Works: But I think, he either jeer'd the Pro∣fession, or me, in regard he well knew, that I was not of the Class, of those illustrious Authors, who are worthy to be shewn in their Books; and it is enough for men to laugh at my Writings, without laughing at my face. In effect, what benefit is it to the Publick, to know the Authors of Books? For they ought but to draw either profit or pleasure from such Books as are good, and give

them the value and price they de∣serve, provided they be able to com∣prehend them. Suppose this Book merited any esteem, and could pur∣chase me any honour for having com∣posed it, to what purpose would it be, to declare my name, to such as know me not, and are never likely to see me? Certainly this knowledge would be useless to them, and but a kind of visionary vanity to me; in regard that names do only note, and signifie things plainly, and give no knowledge of them (because they do not represent them effectively) even though we see them, unless we knew them before. As for such as know me, I cannot teach them my Name, because they know it already; and it would be to no purpose likewise, to tell them, that this Book is mine, because that, by knowing me, they also know the strength, and drift of

my wit, and capacity: And if my Work fall into the misfortune of many other, to be disparaged, and taken for a foppery, should not I be a very dolt, to publish my self for the Author? And had I not better hide my self, (like Apelles) behind the Curtain, and rejoyce alone, if they who know not the Author, give it their favourable vote, and appro∣bation? Or to disown it to my ac∣quaintance, as a bastard put upon me to Father, if they find it to be simple, disgustful, or deformed? For what is it to any body, if Marmet Valcro∣issant the Elder, or any other who∣soever, fumbled up these Entertain∣ments together? And what need any one care to know, either by my name, or by my Book, whether I be a Citizen of Paris, or of Apt in Provence? Whether I be a Courtier of ten years standing, or live three hundred miles

from Court? Whether I have true politeness, and elegancy of speech; and that character, which the An∣cients called Urbanity? or whe∣ther I affect new Terms, Phrases, and the Style A la mode? Whether I have acquir'd the propriety of lan∣guage of my self, or whether I learnt it of my Nurse? And in fine, whether I be fain to study long, to utter my thoughts, or whether the air of my Birth, or Nature, have inspir'd me with a good faculty, and form of writing? All this, my Readers, is an indifferent to you, as it is useless to the whole world; and let the Work and the Workman be what they will, it is sufficient to esteem them, as they deserve. That false opinion, that it is necessary to be at the Court, to write, or speak well, (which you will find refuted in some part of this Treatise) and which had

not the good luck to be started our Age, (because Antiquity thought, that the purity, and politeness of speech could be no more but at Rome:) This opi∣nion, I say, would be disadvanta∣gious to me, if I discovered my name, and men would impose some original sin of Provence upon my Style, by praeoccupation of Spirit; as they heretofore found fault, with the ex∣cellent Works of those famous Ora∣tors of Lyons, and as they reproacht even Titus-Livins himself, that his Style retain'd the tincture of the Paduan Tongue; and this for no other reason, but because they knew well enough, that those illustrious persons wrote not at Rome. Thus you see, that the Name of an Author is sometimes prejudicial to him, in his Book; and it is better for him, to have men judge of him by his Work, then of his Work by opinion:

For so many Verses, and so many Prefaces in his behalf, so many Ad∣vertisements to the Reader, so many Dedicatory Epistles to great Persons, and so many Apologies in form of Prologue, are of small account to such as read a Book for the Subjects sake; and they are also very hurtful to the Author, because the greatest part of these persons, read not these things at all, and are content to speak ill of a Book howsoever; and so the Author makes himself a laughing∣stock, by arrogating to himself a false glory. My self past once through the trial of these dangers; and I confess, my modesty was never so neer shipwrack, as at that time; for though I were far from comply∣ing toward its loss, and from so much as consenting to its deviation; yet could I heartily wish, that I were able to repeal my Name, and the

flatterous praises, which men were pleased to bestow upon me. But Printed Books are like thrown stones, and irrevocable acts; and nothing but time can suppress them, how bad soever they be: Nor have I the va∣nity to think, that this which I now put forth, will last long, or that it is either one of the best, or even of the ordinary sort of Works: And if it were capable of sense, how much would it grieve, to see it self negle∣cted, forsaken, and despised, by the Booksellers, and in good Libraries, amongst so many other, which are as so many noble Pictures, and magni∣ficent Temples of Eloquence, and which the quaint, and learned Wits cherish, and carry always about them, as their constant and grateful Com∣panions! Certainly, it would not forbear to weep for sorrow and shame, as the figure of Solomon

heretofore did, (which Constantine the Great caused to be set up in St. Sophies Church) for rage and spight, and shed tears with admira∣ble artifice, to see that holy Temple, so rich in Ornaments, so stately in matter, and so marvailous in stru∣cture, out-strip his. In like manner do I believe, with shame enough, that I have not been able to arive to that Character of Eloquence, which our famous French Orators have attaind; and this Present which I make you, is neither to take pride in my cheer∣fulness, nor discover my dulness: For I do out of humility, (submitting my self to your correction) that which so many others have done for want of knowledge and judgement; and that homage which I render in publick, proceeds from the esteem I have of all the world; and not from the mis∣cognizance of my self. But I take

all the care I can, to avoid the en∣gaging my self insensibly, in the slippery way of the Court, where Idiots and Novices suffer themselves to fall, and who are infected with cajolery; and I might be justly chidden for vain-glory, if I did as some Courtiers do, who stand making of Congees, and Cringes, to be sa∣luted, and who spinning out their Complements, beyond measure, or exception, cast themselves into con∣tempt and scorn, by speaking of themselves, thereby to be answered, and praised: and therefore to escape the suspition of being vain, I forbear this humiliation, and baseness; though yet I should seem to hunt after repu∣tation, by vilipending my self, I will not speak of my self at all, either good or evill, as not meriting (per∣adventure) either blame, or praise: And as the former shall not move me

to indignation, if men say, I am not a good Author; so shall not the latter to pride; for neither of these passions shall disturb the peace of my Soul: So that, resolving neither to trouble my self, nor thank any body, what∣soever men say to my advantage, shall be very welcome to me; but knowing my self so well as I do, it shall not perswade me. I understand the difference which the Schools put, between Philosophers, and Sophists, and it is no easie matter, to make me take a Paradox, for an Article of Faith: I am able to distinguish glittering Armour, from Armour of Proof, and I know, that the former is better for shew, then for service. Since the famous Relicts of Anti∣quity present us with Panegyricks for Nero, and with Apologies for Buzirus, and that in times of old, People adored Beasts; I cannot en∣dure

to be deified by Elogies; and consequently, though the Eloquence of a friend should have all the art, and address of those ancient Decla∣mators, (who would needs make a Quartan Ague pass for a Goddess, and Poverty for a Good) yet would it no more move me, then the blame men may cast upon my Writings, which hurts me not at all, however it looks, at the beginning of this Discourse, as if I would formalize a little, and as if I vow'd revenge: For, I am in my Carreere, and I find my self obliged to go on, even though I perish: And as people said, that the design of my Convesation of importance, which treats of dying well, after having lived ill, was too serious, and austere, for a man of my profession; that I ought to have kept it within the rules of Morality, without touching upon devotion;

and that to invite the world to read it, I had done well to handle those so dilucid truths, and so necessary meditations in a Romantick way; and embellish so grave, and solid a Matter, with rich, and gay Orna∣ments of Language: As they did (I say) glose, and comment thus upon that; so let them also say as they please, that my Entertainments are not brisk, and gallant enough, to be held upon the Cours by Courti∣ers, and that some of the Subjects thereof are too serious, and Schola∣stick: Let them say, that I had done well, to have used a better, and more exact dispensation, both in the Method, and in the Discourse, and that I should have omitted some matters therein: Let them reproach me, that my Style is neither good, nor well digested, and that it is languid, and Carozelous, as well as

strong, and elevated: Let them accuse me, that my Language is not pure, nor my terms expressive; that my judgement is not well fortified, nor my spirit much inlightned to write well: Let them twit me, with the imitation of good Authors, and with the borrowing of conceits from the Ancients: And in fine, let such as are of a Critical Palate say as much as hath been written, by so many good and famous pens in this last Age; all this (my Readers) shall be indifferent to me; howbeit, according to custom, and Ceremony, I have desired your protection, against the Criticks: Yea, though not only the Country Gentlemen, (who are but subalternative Judges) but even the very whole Court it self (which Judges soverainly, and soverainly well of these things) should condemn my Writings, it should not at all

trouble me, yea, and it should touch me as little, as if the world had not talkt of it at all: For in a word, I care not; and I am as well content, that you should despise, as value my Works, and that you should not read them, as read them; for it is not my design to gather pride, but vertue, from my Books, and to live like a Man of Honour. Farewell.
