May it please your Honours,
THe Sermon we now present your Honours with, as it was preached with the highest evidence and Power upon the Hearts and spirits of those that heard it: so accordingly we beleeve, it may continue the

same effect now published in those, whose fraile me∣mories may have lost a great part of the sense of it; and by an humble reading and meditation of it, may do much more good, to those that have altogether been unacquainted with it. Of what value the Authour was both for his Con∣versation and Doctrine; that honour and respect that all had to his words, both in Publick and Private, as to Jobs, Job 29.21, 22, 23. together with that generall expression of sor∣row from all persons high and low, good and bad, upon his death, and at his Funerals, is the most effectual Testimony. We shall not there∣fore spend your Honours time in giving our com∣mendations of him; He being above them; we also knowing that his Name and memory is still fresh, and will continue precious upon your hearts.
For the Discourse; the sutablenesse of the Ar∣gument to the Distempers of the Age, and that heighth of spiritual zeale and prudence in mana∣ging of it, speak it worth the publishing: We therefore hearing that it was the earnest desire of many to have the sight of it; it being by the con∣sciencious care and labour of his Widow, with several others of his Labours prepared for view;

we thought it our duties to commend it to your Ho∣nours, as your due; and to the Saints and all that make profession of the Name of our Lord Jesus, as a most necessary piece of Christian knowledge, in this day of pride and formality; whereby all may examine themselves, that call themselves Believers, whether they be in the faith, yea or no.
We leave your Honours and this Sermon to the blessing of God; and with our daily prayers, that your Honours may be faithful and prosperous in the great work of your Generation, the settlement of this poor Nation upon the sure Bases of Truth and Justice.
