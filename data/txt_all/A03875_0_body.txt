My Lord,
I MIGHT be
fearefull, that
so great a Ma∣ster
of the lear∣ned
Languages (as your

Lordship is knowne to be)
hauing before read this
acute discourse in the Ori∣ginall,
and enioyed the Au∣thour
in his owne strength
and elegance, might not
onely seuerely censure my
weake translation; but iust∣ly
neglect the Presentation
of it, as a thing needelesse
and improper to your lear∣ned
selfe. But may it please
your Lordship to ad i my
reasons? First, the greater
your abilities are, the more
authority will your Name

giue the worke to those that
are meere English Rea∣ders,
and to whom my
paines most properly doe
belong.
Barclay, the learned
Author, hauing with a
sharp and penetrating
fight surueyed the diffe∣rence
of humane dispositi∣ons,
and loth to bound his
fame within the narrow
limits of his owne Lan∣guage,
cloathed his worke
(and that most elegantly)
in the Roman tongue.

I, lest our English Gentle∣men
(as many of them as cā∣not
master the Originall)
should lose the sense of such
a worke, haue made aduen∣ture
to ene't them, and
with the oss (perchance)
of mine owne fame, to ex∣tend
the fame of Barclay.
The second reason, and the
chiefe, why I present it to
your Lordship, is drawne
from that analogy which I
conceiu betweene the mat∣ter
of is booke and your
minde, eing such, as it may

be thought, if the Author
himselfe had liued in this
state, he would haue chosen
the same Patron; your
minde (my Lord) being not
onely moulded for the Mu∣ses
to loue, but made for
publike and high imploy∣ments,
has not onely occasi∣on
to meete the differences
of humane dispositions, but
ability of iudgement to dis∣cerne
them; and with a
conscious delight may run
ouer the mention of those
things heere, which your

selfe haue by experience al∣ready
found, and meete in
some parts of third discourse
your owne perfctions tru∣ly
charactered.
To you, my Lord, to
whose Noble bosome the
Muses heretofore haue re∣sorted
for delight, they
now flye for Patronage
and shelter. To your hands
I humbly presons this
weake endeauour, besee∣ching
Almighty GOD
to blesse you with con∣tinuance
and encrease of

temporall Honours, and
after, with eternall Happi∣nesse,
so prayeth
