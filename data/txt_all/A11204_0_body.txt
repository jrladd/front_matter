SIr, if I were to yeeld a reason of my present presumption for thus boldly offering vnto your worshipful view this little hystoricall Abridgemēt of Martiall exploits, by sundrye most famous warriours and renowmed Capitaines long since at∣chieued: I thinke besides many other allegations, I might aunswere, & that iustly, (wherein also I am perswaded, that the general consent of your Coū∣trey, wil ioine in opiniō with me) that the title of the book, bearing the name of Valyaunce, & the matter or argu∣ment therein comprised, entreating of warlike affaires, & knightly prowesse, doth (as it were) by peculiar choice chal¦lenge your fauourable patronage. For, omitting the large Seas of your sundry other deserued commēdations & prai∣ses, which I know (such is your Chri∣stian

modestie) you loue not to heare to your own face emblazed, & which I am far vnmeete & vnable fully to de∣cipher: what inuincible courage in the cause and quarrell of your Prince and Country harboureth within your vn∣daunted breast: what dexteritie, with shocke and launce followeth your vi∣gorous arme: what prompt readinesse and alacritie to march against the eni∣mie hath appered in you abroad: what courtesie, affabilitie, bountie, & heroi∣call generositie at home: both Courte resoundeth, & Country plausibly at∣testifieth. According where-vnto, I know, I need not to dwel vpō any cu∣rious, sute vnto your Worship for the cheereful acceptaunce heere-off: but rest very assured of your accustomed goodnesse: wherein I beseech the Al∣mightie long to continue you, with dayly increase of the same.
At Butley in Chesshyre, the.
