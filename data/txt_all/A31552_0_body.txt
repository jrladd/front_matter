LOng had the bright Thealma lain obscure,
Her beauteous Charms that might the world
allure,
Lay, like rough Diamonds in the Mine, unknown;
By all the Sons of Folly trampled on,
Till your kind hand unveil'd her lovely Face,
And gave her vigor to exert her Rays.
Happy Old Man, whose worth all mankind knows,
Except himself, who charitably shows
The ready road to Virtue, and to Praise,
The Road to many long, and happy days;
The noble Arts of generous Piety,
And how to compass true felicity,
Hence did he learn the Art of living well,
The bright Thealma was his Oracle:
Inspir'd by her, he knows no anxious cares,
Th near a Century of pleasant years:
Easie he lives, and chearful shall he die,
Well spoken of by late Posterity.
As long as Spencer's noble slames shall burn,
And deep Devotions throng about his Urn;
As long as Chalkhill's venerable Name,
With humble emulation shall inflame
Ages to come, and swell the Rolls of Fame:
Your memory shall ever be secure,
And long beyond our short liv'd Praise endure;
As Phidias in Minerva's Shield did live,
And shar'd that immortality he alone could give.
Iune 5. 1683.
