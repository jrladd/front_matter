WHat you thankfully and louing∣ly accepted when it was prea∣ched, commeth, you see, in another forme; crauing a se∣cond veiw. Though what I intended could not all be spo∣ken in the allotted time, yet may it all be seene. If you thinke it may be vsefull in this secure age for any of the Cleargy vnder you, your countenancing of it may incourage others to reade it. I doubt nothing of your loue either to mee, or mine, much lesse to the common good. This poore Sermon will (I hope) be found to ayme at good, because at God, and against Antichrist. It is
 true, it might haue beene the worke of farre more able, but not more willing. Therefore as such a worke it is tendred vnto you, from him who desires to continue to God a faithfull souldier against the Pope of Rome, and to your worship
