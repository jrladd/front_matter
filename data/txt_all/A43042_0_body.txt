RIGHT Honourable Lords, and
worthy Gentlemen, We are all
imbarqued in the ship, the
Common-wealth; and as in a
ship there are divers Agents,
whereof some of the chiefest,
at the sterne to governe; others
of an inferiour rank clime the
Mast, hoysesailes, and doe in∣feriour
workes in it, all of them according to their severall
ranke, as they doe the duties of their severall places; so
have interest in the Common good, and either doe, or ought
to mind the publike welfare of it: And as in building of
the Tabernacle, some of the chiefe sort brought gold, silver

and precious stones, others of inferiour sort, goats haire and
Badgers skins, every man according to his ability, did con∣tribute
unto the same. I, though but of the inferiour rank in
this ship, even the meanest of all others, yet imbarqued there∣in,
see not but I ought to endeavour, though but in inferiour
workes the good of it, who though I have not gold, silver, or
precios stones, nor any thing besides my poore prayers to
advance the glorious Tabernacle, yet would with Ahi∣maaz,
run also, as one willing and desirous to doe good, if I
had any ability in my selfe, or opportunity: But having
nothing of my owne, finding this little Manuscript among
the papers of my deare deceased brother, and considering
the troublesomenesse of the times the feares of the better
sort, and hopes of the worse: I have adventured to make
it publike, which though written some time since, and upon
another occasion, yet there may something be gathered out of
it (if I mistake not my selfe) which may bee of good use
for these present times of our feares, and sad apprehensions,
wherin if there be any thing which in your grave wisdoms,
you may thinke fit to put in execution, it shall much 
me, that I brought it to the light, or at least, if it may but
occasion your wisedomes to take into your serious considera∣tion,
the subject matter of it, which is the securing of the
Kingdome against all dangers, that may come to it, and in
your wisedomes to thinke upon better directions, that may
remove the fears and apprehensions of most men in these ∣multuous
times, by reason of the Insurrection of our neigh∣bouring
Kingdome, and the just feares we have of these
pestilent enemies of our Church and Common-wealth, The
Papists in this Kingdome, and their Adherents, the Pre∣lates:
Now as concerning my brothers manuscript, as it
was penned in time of a great Sea preparation made by the

French King some ten yeares past, so (as I had it from his
owne mouth) it gained the approbation and good liking of his
Majesty, who commanded him to write his judgement and
opinion of these preparations, and by what meanes (if they
were intended against us) wee might secure our selves, both
for the pesent, and in future; which though for some reasons
was not thought sit to be put in execution, yet I have beene
encouraged by some of good judgement, now to publish it in
these times, wherein wee have some more apprehension of
danger then formerly (partly by the actuall rising of these
many ill affected to Religion in Ireland, and also those
proud-threatning speeches lately given forth by the Papists
here at home, which if not by some such course, as is here
propounded, bee prevented, may breed more danger then
most are sensible of.
Eliahs cloud rose but like a hand, which after orespread
the whole heaven, what this may doe, if suffered to enlarge
itselfe; how farrereach, we cannot directly say; but even
to our owne Horison wee may well presume, if not repelled,
or dispersed by a strong and swift gale The mischiefe
they carry with them cannot bee contayned in the neighbour
Kingdome, if they thus grow in their progresse. What
combination there may be with forrainstates I leave to deeper
judgements, but for my owne part, I shall ever subscribe un∣to
the opinion of that noble Lord, concerning an old Enemy
the Spaniard▪ that if he ever find an opportunity, and ad∣vantage
against us, hee will not baulke it: I cannot easily
be drawne to a beleefe, that that great Fleet they sent two
yeares since upon our Coast, when wee and our true hearted
brethren, the Scots, were ready to enter into a bloody
battle, was to guard only his Souldiers, or treasure; but
that there was a designe in it upon this Kingdome, though by

Gods mercy prevented. Never came such a Fleet upon our
Coast, save in 88. when they intended a reall invasion.
But if it be objected; was he not in league with us? But
alas, what security can we have thereby, in being in league
with him, or any of that Religion: when first they hold
that it is no fault to breake faith with Hereticks. Second∣ly,
If it be? The Popes dispensation will take it away. Third∣ly,
if the Pope find it for his advantage hee will so charge
them to breake with us, that so conscience and obedience
shall cure their malice and perfideousnesse: I am bold to
adde to what my brother wrote, what once, long since I
read in a little Treatise, which may something conduce to
this, of that brave Lord, the late Earle of Essex; ex∣prest
in an Apology in the late Queens time of happy memo∣ry,
which may something strengthen my brothers opinion
for making Sea preparations; which with my Brothers, I
humbly offer to your considerations, there being none under
Heaven to whom we can addresse our selves▪ for power and
fitnesse to correct the malignant aspect of these influences,
besides your honours: And now most noble, and grave Se∣nators,
the true and ever renouned Patriots of your Country,
if my Zeale for my countries freedome and prosperity, have
borne me beyond my bounds, impute it to my errour of judge∣ment,
and let your candor close with the good intentions of
him, who is more in wishes, and hearty desires, then in
parts and abilities, for the felicity of his Countrey. And
he shall ever remaine,
