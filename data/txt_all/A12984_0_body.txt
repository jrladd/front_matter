CHildren (right worship∣full) as we al wel know, when their parentes or any of those, with whō they haue any familia∣rity, goe vnto any faire, vse commonly at their taking their iourney to say vnto them: I pray you bring me home a Fayring. And not only children are for the most part thus affected, but we see it also to be the fashion of others of greater grouth, & further yeares, when as at faires they meete with their friendes and acquaintance, to bee begging and asking of them: What will you giue me for a fairing? And the curtesie that is this way bestowed, be it in a maner neuer so small and simple, is notwithstanding wel ac∣cepted and kindly taken from the hand of the giuer, as being a signe and token of his good will and louing affection towardes the party, on whom he doth bestowe the same. This
custome simply in it selfe not to be condem∣ned (although through abuse the best thinges may be peruerted) I haue at this present fra∣med my self vnto, & as I could for the shortnes of the time, prepared this treatise, discoursing vpon the office of parentes in prouiding their children of honest mariages in due season, & shewing at large the dutie and obedience of their sonnes and daughters in this behalfe.
How necessarie for al sortes of people this my trauaile (such as it is) may be, it is not my meaning here in many wordes to dilate. The generall want of performance of dutie in this respect, on the one side by the parentes, and on the other by their children, hath bin the fo∣ster-nurse, & brood-mother of many great in∣conueniences, wherwith both the Church & common wealth, yea and many priuate fami∣lies, are not a litle pestered, against the which if by this my labour, God of his mercie gran∣ting vnto it this blessing, I may be thought to haue set downe some remedie, it shal no∣thing greeue me to haue taken the same, be∣ing glad if any way by my simple seruice, I can bring any profite vno the Church of God, the which howe much or how litle soeuer it bee, who so shall thereby receiue any benefit next vnto God he shall be beholding vnto your worship for the same, who haue bene the chiefe occasion of the publishing hereof.
For owing a dutie vnto you for your cur∣tesie shewed, at the request of the right ho∣norable,
the Earle of Huntington, my verie singular good Lord and maister, I haue euer since bene deuising, how I might giue out some testimonie of my gratefull remembrance of this worshipful kindnes, and hauing none other meanes of greater valour, I haue presu∣med to giue trial therof by these paper thanks whereby al posteritie may witnesse, that I ac∣knowledge my selfe to remaine a debtor vnto you for vndeserued curtesie extended to∣wards me, the which, in asmuch as I am able no other waies to requite, I do in al humilitie request your worship to account and reckon me in the number of those, who being manie pleasured by you, though hindmost peraduē∣ture in worldlie abilitie, will be found not∣withstanding as forward as the formost in all dutifull and thankfull good will, as one that hateth in the worlde nothing more than the most vglie and loathsome monster of ingrati∣tude and vnthankfulnes. The time falling out so fitlie with the finishing of this worke, and publishing the same, I haue geuen vnto it the name of a Bartholmew Fayring,The reason o the Title. the ra∣ther by the noueltie of the title to drawe on the multitude of people that nowe out of all places of our country repaire vnto the citie, to the better beholding and consideration of the matter cōtained in the treatise: the which, as it is general, and concerneth all that either are, or may be parents, or children: so the do∣ctrine marked heedfullie, and practised ac∣cordingly,
cānot choose but fal out auaillable vnto manie, who learning here, that which for the most part they were ignorant of, and thought strange before, will henceforth prooue to be more carefull fathers in proui∣ding christian mariages for their sonnes and daughters, and their children more dutifull & obedient in being ruled by them, & follow∣ing of their choice, and in diligent wareful∣nes, that they intangle and bewrap not them∣selues in wedlocke-bands without the con∣sent and liking of their parents. Accept ther∣fore I beseech you (right worshipfull) this simple present as an vnfeined token of my good will, with that fauourable curtesie, wherewith you are woont to imbrace others much bounden welwillers, the which, if you shall vouchsafe me, I haue obtained my desire praying the almighty for euer to protect you. Tunbridge, this 20 August. 1589.
