My LORD:
THAT I presume to Prefix your Graces Name, to so Rude, and Hasty a Production; it is not because I think the following Treatise de∣serves your Acceptance, but be∣cause I fear, it may need your Pa∣tronage. To appear against an



Author, who pretends to be the Champion of the Church of England, and to stand up in Defence of the long Neglected Rights, and Pri∣viledges of its Clergy; has some∣thing in it so Improper in Any, but especially so Unbecoming a Minister, of that Church; that I thought it would be Requisite for me, to take all the Care I could, to Remove those Prejudices, which this might be apt to raise, in some, against the very Design of my Discourse. And I knew no Way more effectually to do this, than by begging leave to In∣scribe what I had done to your Grace; who, as by Providence, you are placed in the First, and Highest Station, in Our Church; so have you, upon all Occasions, no less eminently signalized your self, in the Defence of it.


It would, my Lord, look too much like Vanity in me, to say, that I here publish nothing, but what has, in some Measure, been before Approved of by your Grace. It shall suffice me, if I may be allow'd to declare thus much; That the Principles, upon which I go, are such, as in your Graces Judgment, have nothing in them that is either Contrary to the Do∣ctrine of the Church of England; or otherwise injurious to the Rights, and Liberties of it.
Who the Person, against whom I Write, is; I neither do Know, nor am at all Sollicitous to Dis∣cover. But as his Principles seem but too much to look towards a Party, against which the Church of England ever has; and, I am perswaded will always be ready Vigorously to oppose her self:



so the Disaffection which appears, in the whole Process of his Dis∣course, to the present Establish∣ment, sufficiently shews; that He had some farther Design in the publishing of it, than barely to assert the Rights of the Clergy, and Convocation.
But of this let every One judge, as he sees Cause: My Business is with his Book, not with his Per∣son, or Design. In my Reply to which, as I have endeavour'd, according to my Ability, to de∣fend the Cause both of the King, and Church; so, for the Argu∣ments sake, if for nothing else, I thought I might presume to commend the Protection of it to your Grace, Who have so Great a Zeal for Both; and will therefore, I hope, be the rather disposed, to favour this Honest,



though but Imperfect, Per∣formance, of Him, who with all possible Duty, and Respect shall ever remain,
My LORD,
