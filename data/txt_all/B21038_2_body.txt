I Here present you an History which though now you may, confident I am you very lately could not in reason expect; such was the perversnesse and crookedness of these times, that no loyal sub∣ject might without danger attempt to write, nay hardly to speak the truth of his Soveraign: for a sort of men there were, who having by vio∣lence usurped his Dominions, though that they had no surer ground to maintain their unjust possession, then by scandalizing his most SA∣CRED MAIESTY and deceiving of his Subjects, many of whom had not but by such deceites converted their loyalty into Treason.
Yet GOD I hope will now be pleased to re∣turn them to their Allegiance, and give encour∣ragement to those who have constantly continued loyal, that they may at length once more enjoy hapinesse, and every man sit under his own Vine and under his own fig-tree; which, the GOD of HEAVEN be praised, we have now greater hopes of then ever.

If I have in this History offended any loyal person, I am hartily grieved, I have imparti∣ally endeavoured the truth, and if I be found in the contrary, reason will easily convince me; and I shall be sory that neither my knowledge or in∣telligence extended to a more narrow search.
I think I have represented his Majesty no o∣therwise then any loyal person (for this age re∣quires that distinction) that hath either heard of or know him will confesse him to be; but if they will not, let them be convinced by that saying of a worthy Gentleman long time an attendant upon his Majesty, who having given me a large account of his virtues, at length concluded, That Tully himselfe (if now alive) could not sufficiently expresse his praise.
Gentlemen, it is to you in Generall that I pre∣sent this History, that you may see, and be sen∣sible, to whom you have been loyal, and then I believe that you will judge that your loyalty hath found it's just reward in being loyal to so just a Prince: and if any of you have suffered for him, read but his sufferings, and you cannot value your own. Yet I intend not this at all to his pre∣tended Tavern friends; which I believe (whilst
they are so) are so onely there, and indeed I cannot looke upon these as faithful Subjects; for how can that man be loyal to his Prince, who hath not the power to be true unto himselfe. Drunken Subjects, though never so loyal, will prove the ruine both of themselves and their Soveraign.
Gentlemen, let those that are truly loyal joyn their Prayers with mine for the happiness of his most SACRED MAIESTY, since in his we must necessarily conclud our own, and more then ours, our COVNTRIES.
