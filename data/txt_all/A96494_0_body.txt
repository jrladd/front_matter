ferat:) Offering up a Stone, how Rough and vn∣pollish'd
soever, to the Building of this Temple: Which
Stone, if any man shall goe about to asperse with his untem∣per'd
Morter, not suffering it to be laid (as the stones in So∣lomon's
Temple were) without Noyse; Let him know, that
He, who has already sacrificed his whole Fortunes, (such as
they were,) and is ready with all Cheerfulnesse to lay down his
Life, will not be unwilling to Expose his Name; if hereby,
he may be made able, in the least measure to promote the Glo∣ry
of his God, and the Wellfare of his Brethren.
Sir, This is That which I plead for in the Pulpit, though, I
confesse, with more Zeale, then Learning; and this is That
which you Fight for in the Field, with no lesse Courage then
Loyalty. I have the honour and happinesse to be a witnesse of
your Compassion towards your Brethren, and of your Zeale to∣wards
God: And therefore, while I see You beare in one hand
a Sword,1. Sam. 13. 20. sharpned in Israel, not among the Philistims, a∣gainst
the Rebellious Sheba; and in t'other a Stone, hewen out
of the Spirituall Rock, for Sacrilegious Achan▪ I hope, this
Your known detestation of Rebellion and Sacriledge; Your
cleare and unbiac'd pursuit of Religion and Liberty; will en∣courage
that in Another, which You Practice Your selfe.
The confidence whereof invites Me to begge Your Protecti∣on
to this Sermon, and the Author of it,
SIR,
