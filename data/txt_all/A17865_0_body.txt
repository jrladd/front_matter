I AM not vnmind∣full
of the favours
and courtisies (Right
Worll.) receiued from
your much honoured
Grand-father Sr Tho∣mas
Leigh, (of blessed
memory) at my first
comming into England,
how in my distresse his liberall maintenance re∣freshed
mee: And in all those yeares that I had
the honour to belong vnto you, how gratious and
bountifull I found you both: should I silence these
your benefits bestowed on mee, and not acknow∣ledge
them to the world, my conscience surely



would accuse mee of ingratitude, a vice abomi∣nable
and hatefull both to God and good menPeremptoria siquidem res est ingratitudo, ho∣stis gratiae ini∣mica salutis▪ Bernard sermo∣ne 2. de septem misericordijs..
To avoide which, I haue presumed to publish, and
offer to the world vnder both your names this my
little translation, of the great and learned Ca∣meron;
not for any hope I haue by this, or any
greater seruice to requite your favours to mee,
but only to testifie that I confesse and acknow∣ledge
Gods goodnesse towards mee in finding
such a shelter that hath receiued & kept mee safe
in a land where I was a stranger. For which your
fauours towards mee, the Lord of heauen and
earth restore you an hundred fold into your bo∣somes,
and giue your VVorships grace to see (as
your Honourable Grand fathers haue done) your
childrens children like Oliue plants round a∣bout
your table.
Receiue then this small mite as a token of the
bounden seruice of him, who vncessantly prayeth
God to blesse you and your Noble Familie with
all spirituall blessings in Christ Iesus.
