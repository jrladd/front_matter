August Madam,
IT being now about IX Years since I was first Conversant with Military Persons, and heard the Sound of Drums and Trumpets, as well in the Ʋnited Netherlands, as Here, and in Ireland. And ha∣ving
the Honour to Bear in my Body the Marks of Fervent Zeal, and Unsha∣ken Loyalty to Your Sa∣cred Majesty's; Which is, I confess, the Principal Thing in this World I rejoyce in, and value my self upon. It hath so far encourag'd me, as to cast these Unpolisht Papers at Your Majesty's Feet; Containing, an Ac∣count of the Miraculous Providences, and Providen∣tial Successes, That have all along attended the Glori∣ous Enterprises of His Ma∣jesty
King William, for the Publick Good of Christen∣dom; But especially of the British Empire, together with the Ʋnited Netherlands, and of the Protestant Re∣ligion, as in the Rest of Europe, so particularly in Great Britain and Ireland, it's most Secure and Trium∣phant Seat: And hum∣bly to beg Your Majesty's Most Gracious Accep∣tance thereof. I cannot say of this Enchiridium, as the Jews sometime said to Christ, of the Centurion, (al∣though
it Treats of so glo∣rious a Subject,) Dignum est, It is worthy that Your Majesty should accept it: But, I may truly speak in the Centurion's own Words, Non Sum dignus, I am not worthy to be Grac'd with Your Majesty's Favoura∣ble Acceptance; As be∣ing Conscious of my small Abilities. Neither are these Fragments deserving, for Excellency of Style, or Elegancy of Phrase, which is not my Ambition there∣in: Since the true Ada∣mant
is best polisht with its own Dust, and Hero∣ick Deeds are their own proper Encomium.
I have not for my own part, whereof I can boast, but the Honour of being sometime, the only Eng∣lish Caplain to His Maje∣sty's Army, in the late blessed and memorable Ex∣pedition; and of reading and dispersing then some hundreds of His Gracious DECLARATIONS, between Tor-Bay and Lon∣don;
to the Joy of all true Protestants, and Dejecti∣on of their Adversaries.
To make no mention of my Service and Wounds received in Ireland, &c. There is no Man that hath endeavour'd to ad∣vance Your Majesty's most just Designs, more than my self, according to the small Sphere of my Pow∣er, as is not unknown to several Noble Lords, &c.

May then the covering of the Almighty Wings, be ever spread over your Excellent Majesties, and underneath the everlast∣ing Arms; may your Royal Persons be still most precious in the Eyes of all your Subjects, and your Forces prosper by Sea and Land. May you be blessed with an Obe∣dient, Religious and Loy∣al People throughout all your DOMINIONS, and with a long and hap∣py Reign over them, in
Health, Wealth, Peace and Godliness; and after this Life, may Your Majesties be Crown'd with Glory and Immortality, is the Prayer of
