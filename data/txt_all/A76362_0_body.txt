SIR,
I Well-remember, that in the beginning of these Times, it was the won∣der of these parts to see so self-denying both a Mother and a Son! other parents, that had moe Children, and lesse for them were more sparing of them, then either yours was of you, or you of your self, though an onely Son, and of so-great expectation! Since there has been no Cause, blessed be God, to repent that free-will-offering, amid bullets flying there has been
a distinguishing and securing Pro∣vidence, so as now after warre you live in perce, Enjoying those large possessions, which Birth and Mar∣riage have devovl'd upon you.
I am not unknowing, that Great Houses are not without their spa∣cious and pleasant Walks, but yet Enoch's excells those as-farre and more then they doe others. And therefore I take the boldnesse to minde you of it, and in this Trea∣tise, which, such as it is, is a signall of my many Obligations to you, and may by God's blessing serve as some hint and help of your walk∣ing, whiles in your Gardens with your God, which is the desire and prayer of
Sir,
