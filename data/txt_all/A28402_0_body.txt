Most Honoured,
THE Favours receiv'd from Men have this Allyance, with those descend from Above; That, how secretly soe∣ver they may have been conferred, we may, without the least hazard of Modesty, make the most Publick Acknow∣ledgments we can of them. Nor is it unlike∣ly, that Addresses of this Kinde were the Issue of some such Reflection; They, who make them, be∣ing desirous they should rather be thought the Ef∣fects of a Duty, then the Satisfaction Men are apt to conceive, from their acquainting the World, how highly they are obliged to Great Persons. Hence those excessive Celebrations, frequent in Dedicato∣ries; a Custome I am the more unwilling to com∣ply with, out of a Caution, lest what I should say,

might be thought Advanced to Commend my own Choice. And yet, what could I not say of two Per∣sons, the Glory of a most Noble, and Antient House; One, heightned with all the Advantages of a Princely Education, and Travel; The Other, so Transcendent in the Constancy of a Noble Passion, as, known, would reconcile our Faith to Romances, and make us confess it possible, that Representation may be indebted to Reality.
As to the Present Treatise; What Importance it may be of, I rather leave to be seen in the Perusal of it, then insist on here. 'Tis a Discovery of the Pious Frauds, and Impostures, which, having crept into Chri∣stian Religion, even in its Infancy, have ever since poisoned it, more or less, by their Continuance therein: a Design may justly be termed Great, if out of no other Consideration, yet this at least, that it imposed a Necessity on the Authour, to unravel all Antiquity to find them out, and bring them to the Tribunal of a Rational Disquisition. For my own Endeavours herein, they are left to the success Time, and Mens Censures shall afford them, with all my Wishes summ'd up in this, That my addres∣sing of them to so Noble a Name may be look'd on, as an Eternal Testimony of my humblest Re∣spects thereto, and the greatest Expression I can, at present, make of my being,
Most Honoured,
