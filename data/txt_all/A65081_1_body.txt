May it please your Lordships,
I Humbly presume for to Acquaint your Lordships, that I understand some Merchants of London, are en∣deavouring to obtain an Act of Parliament, to make Gold and Silver a Merchandize, to trans∣port freely at their will and pleasure, as it is at this day at Amsterdam, and several other Common∣wealths in Christendome.
If this do not satisfie your Lordships, I have it at large to shew this mischief, but I hope I shall not need to say more to this businesse to stopit.My Lords, I am none of the Councel or Committee for Trade, and so it may be presumption in me to intermeddle, to say any thing in this businesse; but my Lords, a Stander by may see more in the Game then the Gamesters: I am no Lawyer, yet I humblie say, I know this point concerning the giving libertie to Merchants to transport money, and what the damage may be to his Majestie, to his Lords of the Councel, and to the Kingdom in general, as well as many others that are in Commission for the Regulating of Trade.
My Lords, I have bin writing on this Argument above this moneth, and shall be ready to present to his Majestie, and his Privie Councel (within this week) a Paper that shall unfold the many mischiefs and dangers the Merchants would expose the King and the Kingdom into, had they this Power in their hands: the Merchants should they obtain this their desire, and remove this Trust out of his Majestie and his Privy Councels Hands, to be the only Iudges, to give leave to Merchants to transport Gold and Silver, would rob the King of one of his greatest Prerogatives, and Flowers of the Crown, which by twenty Acts of Parliament and Proclamations, is only invested in the Kings Majestie, and his Privy Conncel; the granting the Merchants this Power, will
 bring an hundred inconveniences and mischiefs to the King, Nobility, and Gentry, as I have at large to shew your Lordships and the Privy Councel, and if I do not satisfie his Majestie, your Lordships, and all his Privie Councel, of this that I say to be true, never let me have your Lordships good opinion, that I am either an honest man, or one that loves the Kings Safetie, Honour, and Greatnesse, and the Honour of his Privy Councel.
And therefore my most Humble Suit is to your Lordship, (my Lord Chancellour) that if this businesse be called on at the Councel of Trade, and your Lordship be present there this day, as I hear you in∣tend to be purposely about this businesse, that your Lordship would be pleased, either to put off this businesse for to have it argued before the Kings Majestie, or his Privie Councel at Whitehall sometime next week, in the mean time I shall be ready to shew to your Lordship and the Pri∣vy Councel, that it concerns his Majestie next to the Militia, to conti∣nue and keep this great Trust in his Majesties Sacred hands, and in the Power of his Privie Councel, and no other person by the Law, can or ought to have the Priviledge, to give leave to transport Gold and Silver at their pleasure, this being the soul of the Militia, they that have the money and the Peoples purses, have virtually the Command in all Common-wealths of the Government; let who will have the Title, the Bankers have the power; and this priviledge is no where granted, but in Commonwealths, God defend England from the very name of a Commonwealth, for the Tragedies which were lately acted by some Merchants in England.
When we had no King in this our Israel, they have robbed the King∣dome of all the Gold, and so now would work iniquity by a Law; but by Gods Assistance, I will diffect them, and lay the danger open to his Majestie, your Lordship, and the Kings most Honourable Privie Coun∣cel, and stand or fall by your righteous Judgement, humbly praying for his Majesties Safety, Honour and Service, that no further proceed∣ing in this great businesse be argued, but before his Majestie, and his most prudent Privie Councel, within lesse then a week I shall be ready with my Reasons for what I say, to shew your Lordship, that so all the Lovers of the King might be satisfied of the Damage and Danger of removing this great Trust, out of his Majesties and his Privy Councels Hands. So I humbly rest
Novemb. 27. 1660.
