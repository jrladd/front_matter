SIR,
AMong many your ne∣cessary, and wholsome rules, laid downe, by way of Fatherly aduertisement, vn∣to me, this hath beene one, as not the least repeated, not the least worthy: Efficaci∣us est vitae quam linguae testimonium. It is better (specially for a Diuine) to
make his life, then his tongue, his witnesse vnto the people: that in being an example vnto his flocke bee may saue himselfe, and them that heare him: wherein howsoeuer I haue failed, or may hereafter; yet I inten∣ded hereby to expresse my desire (euen by this my reso∣lution) vnto a constant set∣lednesse, and composition of life. Who shall thankefully entertaine the friendly re∣prehension of any, noting my going astray from that which I haue chosen. Sir, that I haue not made the dedication of these my labours vnto you, the world
knoweth, that vnder the name of Father, you com∣prehend (by vndeniable right) both this, and all o∣ther interest in mee: and therefore I trust you will not deny them as an aliene, when they are offered; but accept them as the first birth of my hard trauelling youth; afoord them such fauourable entertainement, and suc∣cour, as without too much partialitie you may. Nei∣ther will you, in your affe∣ction vnto vertue (I pre∣sume) but take it well, that I haue thus disposed part of your right. In which affiance (with the tender
of my most humble duety) I commit you to the pro∣tection of the Al∣mighty.
