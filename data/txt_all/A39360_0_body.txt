I Thought to have given thee a full ac∣count
why I publish these Letters:
But upon second Thoughts, I con∣sidered,
that if thou art not capable
upon a view of them to discover the
Reasonablenesse, of their Publication, thou wouldst
not apprehend it, though I should expresse it unto
unto thee. Therefore I shall onely say, that I hear∣tily
desire that all those, who professe themselves
True Ministers of THE TRVTH, would re∣solve,
as I have done, not to Write, or Talke any
thing in Matters of Religion to particular Persons,
or Congregations, which they are asham'd to lay
open (in plain, and clear Expressions) to the view
of all Men.
