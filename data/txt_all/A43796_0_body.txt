SIR,
THis Sormon which I preached for your daughter's sake' out of my respects to her, and supposal of this office for her had she died with you, I now send you enlarged and printed. Not for any sollicitations, which is the usual modest excuse, although I wanted not these from som Gentlewomen in her late condition: but because I have not seen this subject, notwithstanding the many occasions thereof, handled by any, thô it may be by some, and I not know it. And es∣pecially, because God's providence which is as the soul in the worlds body, ruling and acting all things in it, is frequently misunderstood by many. Some not only complaining when their exspectations are crost, as Cato did, of its darknes and obscurity, and saying with Brutus, that vertue is but nomen inane, an empty name, when they see such things befal the vertuous: but are even ready with Epi∣curus to deny it altogether, because of its seeming irregularity. Others reading the many temporal promises in the Old Testament, mostly re∣lating to the Jews, and some to particular persons, as David, or such places of Scripture, as Psalm 91, are apt to judge providence to be so far from fulfilling the word, that it is contrary to it; and being not able to reconcile them, are greatly staggerd and perplext. I have therfore cast in my mite of endeavors to reconcile God's word with his works, in this one branch of sudden death, for satisfaction there∣in: and from that ordinary in the Text and example taken occasion since, to treat of most of those extraordinary in Scripture, for the
better illustrating thereof, and this kind of providence both in gene∣ral and particular, in infants as wel as aged, by reason of the litle one we have also lost. The blessing of heaven accompany it for good to those that peruse it, that God may have the glory of his truth and faithfulnes in his word, and of equity and righteousnes in his works. For your selfe, Sir, I am sensible what a ful and home blow God hath reacht you, in cutting down tree and fruit together: the loss of such a daughter with a grandson is great, but it is the will of your heavenly Father, to which I hope you have learnt to submit. You might perhaps have been better satisfyed, if she had died by you, rather than at this distance; but thô Rebekah like she left her native country, and Father's house, yet not God's, nor without his especial providence, who sets the solitary in families, and fixes the bounds of our habitations. And here she liv'd beloved, and died lamented, and thô she is buried in the dust, yet not in oblivion: all which to her is indeed fruitles, yet may somwhat alleviate your sorrow, that she was amongst those that valewd her worth. That this sharp af∣fliction may be sanctified so that you may make the best improvement thereof, and that the blessed Spirit, which is stiled the Comforter, may comfort you and all concernd therein, is the prayer of
SIR,
