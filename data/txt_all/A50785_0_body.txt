Right Honourable,
AS it hath been the constant Practice of your noble An∣cestors to do Good, a Virtue whose radiant Lustre shines no less refulgently in your Honour; for which Reason, Sir, first asking your Honour's Pardon, I make bold to shelter this my Labour under the shadow of your Honourable Name, not in the least doubting but that you will, not only patronize, but encourage any Ʋndertaking that may be for the publick Good, and Welfare of all Ranks and Degrees of Men, in this ancient and Loyal City, of which your Honour fills the Pre∣torian Chair.
Nor can I do less than perswade my self, but that your Honour and all who bear Office in this ancient Body, being Gentlemen of such noble Worth and unblemished Characters, placed as Rulers over this honourable Town, by the unerring Hand of Divine Providence, to defend the Rights of its People by your just Ad∣ministration of Law and Justice; all Men having just Rea∣son to believe, you have its Welfare near at Heart; will give all suitable Encouragement to promote any Ʋndertaking that will be for the Good of all Ranks and Degrees of Men.
And that every particular Member may not be wanting to carry on so good a Work, I do assure them, if any of them please to embark in this Ʋndertaking, that a true Method is found out, shewing how to purchase an Estate out of idle Ex∣pences, and to make Provision for Posterity, for less than One Peny per Day for 20 Pounds, and less than five Pence per Day for 100 Pounds,
