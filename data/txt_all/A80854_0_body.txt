Right Worshipful and wel-beloved,
TO you of all men this Treatise oweth its De∣dication, and from you must needs demand its Patronage: for that in order to your good in the Instruction
 and establishment of you in the order of the Gospel, and Ordi∣nances of Jesus Christ: it hath been preached once and again, and is now Printed: you can∣not be insensible how you bap∣tized Members of the Catholick Church were dispersed, as Sheep without any Shepherd; nay by the Congregational Anabap∣tistical principles and practises, and in order to their Schisma∣tical Church-gathering design, you were by Rude, Rust, Foolish-Wise, and Baptism-blaspheming Simpson, paganized and pro∣claimed Dogs, aliens and stran∣gers to the Common-wealth of Israel: when the zealous im∣portunity of some among you, meeting in me with a real pity of your Pagan posture, did en∣gage me to take of you, as a Church of Jesus Christ, the care and charge. I was constrained
 to lay again the Foundations these wicked men had razed, and to inform you in the first rudiments of Religion, and first ordinances of worship, that you might understand the dignity and duty of your Baptism, in which I finde such dulness in common capacity, that the things you heard you must hear again, and indeed Read before many will receive them. I be∣ing come among you, and (by Gods blessing on my Ministry) having reduced you into some order, convinced some persons of their Rebaptized vanity, and Parents of the sinfull neglect of their Infants interest in the Covenant: have met with vio∣lent opposition, and malitious interruptions in the work of God: constraining me to preach unto you the Gospel of Truth through much contentation; where∣in
 yet through grace I have waxed bold. You are manifest Witnesses that the Anabap∣tists will Baptize with fire and fury, such as they cannot Bap∣tize with water in the way of their folly: By what clamours have they clouded my name (representing me uncivil, whilst for fear of the Law they durst not render me prophane) how they have by false surmizes prejudiced present powers, by false accusations, palpable per∣jury, extrajudicial Process, par∣tial and prejudiced Judges (of their own picking) and impla∣cable fury darkned my credit, weakned my Ministery, distur∣bed my peace, and endeavour∣ed  stop my mouth, you and all the Churches of God can∣not but know. The guilt and odium whereof you have ta∣ken from your selves by your
 seasonable Attestation to my Innocencie, and serious protest against their groundless cruel∣ty, wherein I bless God I can rejoyce, It is the cause that makes the Martyr, and what is the cause of all that calamity they have to me created; Let the fretting of their spirits, when your Pulpit sounded the Sacrament of Bastism is to be administred; your Reverend at∣tendance on that Ordinance is de∣sired: their railing speeches on all occasions uttered against In∣fant Baptism, their invective Letters to me written, (which I keep as Monuments of their folly and malice) their often strugling to set up Oats, Knowls, Lamb, Simpson, to blaspheme Gods Ordinances; and at last violent and unjust intrusion of John Simpson into the Baptis∣mal Season of the Sabbath, to
 the excluding of that Ordi∣nance, and vilifying the same in the sight of the People, and that not only in its subjects, but in it self, openly teaching bap∣tism is no ground of Communion with the Church visible; wit∣ness to all the world, if I suf∣fer as an evil doer; Whose Ox or Ass have I taken? what Law have I violated? whom did I injure in word or deed? How often have I sought for compe∣tent impartial Judges, that might convict me? and propo∣sed ways of Accommodation: admitted them, when sought by my enemies, whose Return hath been we will have no peace, no agreement, no arbitration: nay, my enemies being Judges, the ground of their quarrel and enmity, is my endeavours to return you into order; and their cry is, He will not let
 Simpson preach. So that be∣cause I will not suffer that wo∣man Jezabel to teach and seduce the Lords people, I must be load∣ed with calumny, and followed with vexation: Well be it so, I will bless God for supporting, and wait on him for saving mercy; and pray that you may be more confident in the truths confirmed by my Sufferings, wherein you also have bon your share. I cannot but ob∣serve how Heretical Malice hath trampled on your digni∣ties and gravities by Military insolency, and vulgar rudeness, yet hath God hitherto given you hearts, to adhere to me and the truths by me witnessed. Whilst you have owned my Mi∣nistry; under so great a Fight of affliction, I cannot but hope you will do it still, and be more confirmed in the vertue and
 value of your received Baptism, both which are here plainly and practically propounded to your view. Many eminent men have most fully debated the Controversie, and defended your Infants Right to Baptism, but of their Labours, I observe the vulgar make little use; for Practical conviction of sin, I find to be the best confutation of er∣ror, and have therefore attem∣pted it in the ensuing Treatise for its stile and method, suited to vulgar capacity; receive it as a token of my true affection to your Souls, and Gods holy Or∣dinances, read it as the directi∣on of your duty, learn by it to prize Baptism, as the high Pri∣viledge of you and yours, and in doing and suffering, shew forth the vertue and value of the Covenant of God on your flesh, living as Baptized into
 the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to which end you may be assured as of the endea∣vours, so the earnest prayers of,
