My Lord,
HAD I given those Opportunities for men of
ill Converse, and worse Insinuations to
have drawn me aside, as others have done,
to accuse the Innocent, perhaps I had had
no Occasion to give your Lorship this Trouble: But be∣cause
the Enemies of the King, the Kingdom and the
Protestant Religion, observe my Resolutions fixt and
constant to serve all three, to the utmost of my Power
and Capacity; therefore, rather than they will leave
Plotting, they have placed their little Sham Plots up∣on
me too. However they go on in the old Popish Track
of endeavouring to render Scurrilous and Scandalous,
the Person against whom they raise their Batteries; A∣mong
the rest I find my slef most terribly assail'd by
two of these Enginees of Defamation; by the one in a
publick Pamphet; by the other in a written, but very
malicious Letter, cunningly distributed about the Town
to several of the most Eminent Persons of this City.

Which being done, without the least Proof of the Charges
therein contained, I cannot but look upon it, as an in∣tended
Assassination of his Majesties most Royal Grace
and Mercy towards me. This, my Lord, is that which
enforces me thus to appear in my own Vindication, lest
the World should think those Reproaches confirm'd by
my Silence, and consequently those Royal Favours ill
bestow'd, as being unworthily forfeited. This it is that
emboldens me to make this Address to your Lordship,
to shew that I am not affraid of Contradiction before
so worthy and so great a Magistrate: Whose Zeal for
the Protestant Religion is so well known, that you dis∣dain
the Plotters of its Destruction: Whose Charity,
Generosity, and Candor are such, that you will not lend
a forward Ear to Scandal and Reproach: and whose
Justice is such, that should I be found imposing Falshood
upon your High Dignity, as you would be the first to
Condemn me to deserved Punishment, so you will be as
ready to uphold and vindicate the Innocent. And it
is under the Protection of being so, that I here presume
to subscribe my self
My Lord,
Your Lordships most Humble
and most Faithful Servant
