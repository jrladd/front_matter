YOU are now, by your Representatives, consulting and endeavouring to raise Armies and Navies against the Enemies of our Government and Religion, and all that is dear to us. I need not tell you how great a Burthen those Taxes are, which are necessary to defend the Government: And I cannot but think, every honest Man doth earnestly wish the present Wars may speedily issue in a happy Peace for Eng∣land, and for Christendom. But give me leave to tell you, when you have done all you can of this nature, you have done but one half of your Work, and not the best half neither; there must be other Armies and Militia rais'd, beside those of Flesh, and which must animate and succeed all the rest, or else I doubt we shall scarce reach our Expectations The great design of this Paper is to raise immediately the Militia, or Posse of Heaven,

an Army of Prayers and Tears, which seldom, if ever fail'd of success. Whereas, all other sorts of Warlike Preparations, without these, have often done so. Give me leave to tell you, it is the Work of us all, and a great Work too, earnestly to besiege, why may I not (with reverence) say, to storm Hea∣ven itself with our penitent Supplications, before we can com∣fortably hope to prevail against the great Senacherib of Eu∣rope, the Staff in whose hand has so long been God's Indig∣nation. If ever we would hope successfully to contend with Men, we must first wrestle with God himself by Prayer, as Jacob did, and in the Courage of a holy Faith, say with him, We will not let thee go, except thou bless us: And then we need not fear all those Esau's at home or abroad, who either wish or contrive our Ruine; tho' they come never so well armed against us, God can either change their Minds, or break their Arms. I would fain raise up a Spirit of Prayer and Supplica∣tion, which seems in the generality to be laid asleep for many Months past; and I doubt not, but the serious Reader will here find sufficient Motives thereunto, and all sorts of Sinners, especially the Enemies to the present Government, will find Arguments enough to convince them of their folly. God Al∣mighty give his Blessing, and grant, that Thousands; yea, the whole Nation may have cause shortly to bless God for these Re∣membrances.
