WOrshipfull Sir, I am bold (by way of dedication) to giue yee this excellent Dialogue of Plato the Phylosopher, for two reasons. The first, that so singuler a worke, doone by a Heathen man, might as wel flo∣rish in our vulgare speech, as of long time it hath doone both in Greeke and Latine.
The seconde, that your counte∣naunce might shaddowe it from re∣prochefull slaunders, which com∣mon censures too lightly bolt out a∣gainst the best endeuours. But con∣cerning
 the speciall matter, to wit, my presumption, without first acquain∣ting yee heere-with: thus I protect my selfe. My familiarity with yee in your younger yeeres, when some∣times wee were Schollers together, and my present ioy, to see ye so hap∣pie a succeeder both in your Fathers vertues, place, and Office: imbolde∣ned mee to shew a remembrance of the one, yet reuerently, and gladnes of the other as well becommeth me.
If in thys small gift, ye make ac∣ceptance both of the one and other, yee shall declare no lesse then each one well discernes in ye, and ioy him that euery way is at your cōmaund.
