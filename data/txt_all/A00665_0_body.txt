Noble SIR,
THE Merchant that hath once put to SEA, and made a prosperous Voy∣age, is hardly with-held from a second Adven∣ture. It hath beene my forwardnesse, not vvithout the Instinct of our Heavenly Pilot, the most Blessed Spirit of God, to make one Adventure before: For he that publi∣sheth
 his Meditations, may be well called an Ad∣venturer. God knowes what returne hath beene made to his owne glorie: If but little, (and I can hope no lesse, though I have ever prayed for more) yet that hath beene to mee no little com∣fort. I am now put forth againe, upon the same Voyage, in hope of better successe. For my Com∣mission I sue to You: who have no small power, both in the deciding of Civill differences, and in the disposing of Navall affaires, and matters of such commerce: being knowne well worthy of that Authority in both these Ecclesiasticall and Civill Courts of Iudicature: That You would bee pleased to blesse my Spirituall Trafficke with Your auspicious Approbation. I dare not commend my owne Merchandize: yet, if I had not conceived somewhat better of it, than of my former, I durst not have been so ambitious, as to present it unto You; of whose cleare understanding, deepe judge∣ment, and sincere integrity, all good men among us have so full and confess'd an experience. Yet besides Your owne candid disposition, and many reall encouragements to me Your poore servant; this may a little qualifie my boldnesse, and vindi∣cate me from an over-daring presumption: That
 my aime is Your Patronage, not Your Instruction; Not to informe Your wisedome, which were to hold a taper to the Sunne: but to gaine Your acceptati∣on and faire allowance: That under Your Ho∣nour'd Name, it may finde the more free enter∣tainment, wheresoever it arrives: which (I am humbly perswaded) Your Goodnesse will not de∣ny. That Noble Favour of Yours, shining upon these my weake endevours, will encourage me to publish some maturer thoughts, which otherwise have resolved never to see the light. The sole Glory of our most Gratious God, the Edification and comfort of his Church, with the true felicity of of Your selfe and Yours, shall bee alwayes prayed for, by
