Brethren and Fathers,
I Have long since serious∣ly considered (since the Church hath
been so much divided among us) with whom to close, and where to fix; and I have endea∣voured to observe both the publique and pri∣vate actions, the Te∣nents and conversati∣ons of those Ministers that were of divers judgements, and I doe publikely profess, that
those Ministers which have and still doe own Provincial Assemblies, are for their Piety, Orthodoxness, Christi∣an Simplicity, for their powerfull, spiritual, frequent, practicall Preaching eminent: These are the things which long agoe have made me cordially to
honor you, though since my intimate acquain∣tance with many of you hath much encrea∣sed and confirmed my high thoughts of you, and I think I may confidently say, that under the whole Hea∣ven there is not any City or Nation to be found, that may be
compared to London and England, for powerfull, spirituall, practical Preaching; And I may say, that the Ministry of England is the Glory of the world, and that Lon∣don is the Paradise of England; yet though I have long honoured you, I have not had any
opportunity to te∣stifie it, therefore I thought good, having this small Treatise to publish, with it to pub∣lish how much I honor you; Though I am ve∣ry sensible how little my judgement can adde to the just esteem that the people of God have of you: My de∣sires
and prayers to God are and shall be, that as to your enemies you may be as John Baptists, that though they love you not they may fear and reve∣rence you, being aw'd by the Image of God that appears in the Majesty and power of your Preaching,
and in the holinesse of your lives and conver∣sations, and that all the people of God may more and more highly esteem you in love for your works sake, and that the Doctrine which you preach from the word of God, may be delivered with such evidence and de∣monstration
of the Spirit, that the mouths of gain-saiers may be stopped, and that your lives and Conversations may more and more a∣bound with such Sin∣cerity, Simplicity, Meeknesse, Gravity, Humility, and Chri∣stian Prudence, that
the faces of those may be covered with shame that speak evil of you; These are the desires of him who is,
