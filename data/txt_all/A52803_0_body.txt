My Lord,
YOUR Lord-ship is the only One of all my narrow Acquain∣tance (amongst persons of your Rank & Quality) who hath so much Divine Teachings about the hearts Treachery, as (I can presume) your Ho∣nour is endowed with. You have been an Honorable Owner & Honou∣rer

of the good ways of God (to my knowledge) for this many years; and wherein you have not been an eminent Doer only, but as eminent a Sufferer: In all which, your Ho∣nour cannot but have large Experi∣ence of the Wily Workings of your own Deceitful Heart. Assuredly, Experimental (not Notional) know∣ledge is the most expeditious and dexterous Doctress to Disciple aright in this Deep My∣stery. As that great Mystery of Godliness (the new

name in the white Stone, Rev. 2. 17.) no man can read, but he that re∣ceives it: So this grand Mystery of (Iniquity, or) Ʋn∣godliness (which is call'd the depths of Satan, Rev. 2. 24. and which lies lur∣king in a deep heart, Psal. 64. 6.) is better experi∣enced inwardly, than exerted by a∣ny outward means whatsoever. [Docet Experientia vera,] and [Experto crede Roberto;] I loo∣king upon your Lordship as an old Disciple, Acts 21. 16. A Gray-hea∣ded Christian and

a Father in Israel, 1 Joh. 2. 13. could not but be confi∣dent, that this mystical Mirrour would finde Ac∣ceptance; and the rather, seeing 'tis as useful for Lords as it is for Ladies. Hereupon I pre∣sume to tender it (quale, quale est) unto your Lord-ship's hands for a Blessing to your Heart.
