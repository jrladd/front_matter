SIR,
I Cannot but
very much
honor you, as
being a flourishing
branch of that tree, of

which I am but a
withered bough; and yet
more, for the many ex∣cellent
parts of piety
and morality that are
in you; which as they
are an ornament to your
own person, so they
make your person an or∣nament
to all your Fa∣mily;
whereof as a mem∣ber
I have resentment

in a very great degree;
and therefore have de∣dicated
this small tract
to the Memory of your
Name; not so much to
be a monument of your
Vertues, which will al∣wayes
be a monument to
themselves, as of the
great Respect and Love
I beare you, no lesse then
owe you. I may justly cal

it a tract, seeing I have
beene drawn to write it,
as it were by violence;
least I should yeeld my
selfe guilty of prophane
presumption, for wri∣ting
in arguments of
Divinity, being but a
Lay man; For there
are some have censured
it no lesse, and me no
better; but the best is, I

need not their voyces; It
is sufficient for me, that
there is warrant enough
in the Scriptures, for it;
allowance enough in the
best writers, for it; and
testimony enough in the
practise of all ages for
it; but most honoured
Cosen, if notwithstand∣ing
all this, the cause
shall happen to bee a

looser by my defending
it; I shall then intreate
you, to accept it, withre∣flecting
upon your own
worth; and if you finde
in it, nothing that is
worth your reading; at
least you shall finde by
it, his love and affecti∣on,
who will ever bee
