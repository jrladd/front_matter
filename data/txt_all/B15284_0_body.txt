THis little Volume falling into my hands, and finding therein so much ancient cou∣rage, liberalitie, and mag∣nificence; and Phalaris re∣presented in another shape,
than that, which is given by such Historians as have writ∣ten of him; who (either swayed with the universall hatred, wherwith all men (almost) in those times were possessed a∣gainst such as subdued a po∣pular Government under the command of one man) painted him for one of the most cruell and bloudie Tyrants of the world; Or the age wherein he lived, being of such antiqui∣tie, that few write with truth or certainty his actions, which
were many and variable, yet obscured by the iniquitie of time, hath appeared unto my fancie, as an ancient Statue found by chance in some rui∣ned place of old Rome; which although it bee defective by losse, or breach of some part or member, yet there appeareth in it such a lively expression of shape, strength, or counte∣nance; that it is esteemed in a farre higher degree, than the most curious peece of the most excellent worke-man of this
time. And although these are in a plaine stile, savouring of antiquitie; yet doe they so far set forth the condition of the man; that I think no Histori∣an, unlesse inwardly conver∣sant, could so lively character him, as the many expressions herein, of his high magnifi∣cence, fidelity, and other roy∣all vertues: Amongst which, if any curstnesse or rather cru∣elty of nature appear; it serves to confirme as a truth: That attempts against the per∣son

to render them in our English tongue, as neere as I can in their ancient and na∣turall plainenesse, without the polishing of these times; and to expose it to a publike view, under your Lordships patro∣nage; to whom for your noble favours, freely, aptly, and lo∣vingly done, I doe acknow∣ledge my selfe uncapable of o∣ther repayment: And doe therefore intreat you, my Lord, to accept thereof, as a pledge, that nothing but a
hard winter, hath diverted into unknowne paths my feet (though never the eye of my affection) from waiting upon your service. And the better to assure your Honour therof; If J may perceive, that this manuel findeth grace in your eyes; I shall be bold, with all convenient speed, to offer to your hands a peece of an∣other nature, not yet finished, through the constraint of ma∣lignant interruption; But if otherwayes, I will give stop
both to the birth and life thereof; The giving you con∣tentment in any thing I un∣dertake in this kinde, being the principall end of
