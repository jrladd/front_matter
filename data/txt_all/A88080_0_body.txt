SIR,
THat undeserved respect those worthless Papers of mine which came to your hand received, hath emboldned me to come now a begging to the Universi∣ty: Although it's sad to have the Fa∣ther to seek when the Child is come in∣to the World; especially to a poor mo∣ther. Yet this is the condition of this poor Infant; which however by Di∣vine

Providence having received a Being, yet is both naked and bare; and unless countenanc'd, cover'd, and nourish'd by your care and charity, it must needs remain despicable, and cast out to common odium. Shall I therefore commend and commit the care thereof, or rather freely bestow it on you? This I am sure of, it will be well provided for, if once under your Roof; and if you as willingly enter∣tain it as I beg: However, let it re∣ceive such accomodation as seems best in the eys of so skilful a Nurse. I know the Herods of our times will be hunting after it; but my care is over, when once under yours.
Sir, To deal plainly, this poor Pa∣per I know will meet with much oppo∣sition, therefore I as boldly as humbly

tender it to your protection; and as I do it out of that due Respect I owe to your self▪ so I also aim by this broken and patch'd piece, to prompt and pro∣voke some of the able Champions of the Truths of Christ, to set upon a more learned and perfect Vindication of that precious Truth of Redempti∣on, so much prevaricated and adulte∣rated in our days. And give me leave to give you a little encourage∣ment to own it; although a Mephi∣bosheth, yet it's of the Royal Race, nobly descended, as legitimate as any, begotten by the immortal seed of holy Scripture, able to derive its Pedigree from and before Adam was; There∣fore setting aside all excuses, I once more entreat its entertainment, or else I must shamelesly leave it at your

Dore, to the mercy of the wide world; yet comforted, that there cannot be less pity harboured in your heart, then was found in Pharaoh's Daughter. I crave leave to pay that old debt, due ever since I knew you, viz.
