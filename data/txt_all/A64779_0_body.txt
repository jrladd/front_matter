Madam,
THe Interest I have in the Book offered
to your Honour, by transcribing it into
English Language, has made me not less
careful of its prosperous coming into the World,
then the Author that gave it being. In order
whereunto, I think I have address'd it to a
Lady, so perfect a Parallel to his Princess, that
if your Honour favour it, I shall not much appre∣hend
the disadvantage it has received in the aver∣sion,
and consequently the more need it stands in of
a great protection; I am not ignorant how severe a
censure this sort of Writings undergoes from the
rigid judgements of some seeming Sages, who look
upon them no otherwise then as the Productions

and Entertainments of Idleness. But, I confess
with submission, I cannot understand with what
equity Recreations are allow'd to the Body, if those
accommodated to the mind be condemned; nor why
Musick, Peniture, Statuary, Ornament, and
Magnificence in Architecture, Gardening, and
the like, which certainly in a great measure conduce
onely to Delight and gratifie our Senses, should be
plausibly judged of, if the innocent representations
of noble Actions, and handsome Conversations,
which afford infinite pleasure to the fancy, and ex∣treamly
recreate the minde, be decry'd as noxious,
or, at best, superfluous. Such Cynicks may be
pleased to remember that Socrates and Cato have
been seen upon the Theater. But it would be no dif∣ficult
matter to evince against those morose persons,
that Delight is the least advantage redounding from
such compositions. For, not to say any thing concern∣ing
the Ground-work, which is generally some excel∣lent
piece of Ancient History, accurately collected out
of the Records of the most eminent Writers of old, the
knowledg of which is not to be mispris'd; the additi∣on
of fictitious adventures is so ingenious, the incident
discourses so handsome, free, and fitted for the im∣provement
of conversation (which is not undeser∣vedly
accounted of greatest importance to the con∣tentment
of humane life) the descriptions of the
passions so lively & naturally set forth; yea, the Idea
of virtue, generosity, and all the qualifications re∣quisite
to accomplish great persons, so exquiitely de∣lineated,
that I cannot content my self with giving

the French that ordinary commendation of having
freed this kind of Writings from the incongruous
Chimaerical mixture of extravagancies and impo∣sibilities;
but I must also speak it, (though I believe
with the envy or regret of many) that they have
approv'd themselves the best Teachers of a noble
and generous Morality that are to be met with;
not presenting us with a Carcase or Skelton, but
with a living, active, and (as I may so speak) imbo∣died
virtue, as far transcending that which is held
forth in the gravity and formality of Precepts and
Definitions, as a living person does his own Picture,
which is destitute of Motion, of which (as a
great person observes) the better halfe of beauty
consists, not to be expressed by the Art of the Pen∣sil.
Now whether the Piece I present to your Ho∣nour,
deserves to be ranked in the number of
those I have Characteris'd, whether the Author
has done justice to SCIPIO, and whether I
have been very much injurious to both, is humbly
left to your Ladiships Judgement, which is so au∣thentick,
that as all Books which come into your
fair hands, find you an exact esteemer of their va∣lue;
So this must receive its fate from your sentence,
and accordingly be to other Readers acceptable, or
otherwise. If the Dedication of it seem too pre∣sumptuous,
I must acknowledge I was induc'd to it
by a natural, and so not easily resistable, inclination;
being as well led by an ardour to testifie in some
manner the generation and esteem I have for

things that are excellent by testifying it for a per∣son
that is so, as by an Ambition to do the Booke the
greatest Honour I could by placing your Ladiships
Name before it, and my self by putting before my
own, the Title of,
Madam,
Your Honour's most humble and
most obedient Servant.
