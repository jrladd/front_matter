Right Honourable, and Right Worshipful,
IT'S agreed by all Divines, Philosophers, and
Lawyers, that every Man hath a Right to hold
and injoy those things, which he hath Righte∣ously
obtained; even as the first Occupants of
Lands, retain a Reall Interest, and Property
by a Natural and civil Possession. But the
Hollanders, and Zealanders, of late, would per∣swade
Soveraign Princes, and their Ministers,
to make no difference between Reason of State, and common Right;
In whose Provinces, the Soveraign Power resting in the Com∣mon
People; their Deputies were so bold, in the infancy of their
State, soon after King Iames had delivered their cautionary Towns,
and quitted a great Sum of Money due to the Crown of England,
and perswaded the French King to discharge a greater; That they
at all times afterwards, refused to settle any Regulation of Com∣merce
and Navigation in the East-Indies, and the Whale-Fishing,
(the proper Discovery of the Russia Merchants;) but gave Laws
concerning the old English Draperies, Banishing all Died and Dres∣sed
Cloaths, disputing the Tare of the rest, after they had invited
the Merchant Adventurers, successively to Middleburgh, Delfe, and Rot∣terdam,
with priviledges, (since taken away) yet some of the said
Company, are now Resident in Dort.
The People of Holland, Zealand and Friezland, having also incroa∣ched
upon the Rights of Fisheries, on the Coasts of England, Scotland,
and Ireland; Denying any Tribute, although Spain and France at the
same time purchased Licence, by Treaty, or Special Commission,
Sir DUDLEY CARLETON Demanded satisfaction, and a regulati∣on
in those points in the year 1618. And also for reducing their
Coyns to such a Standard, that might hinder the Transporting of

English Gold and Silver out of His Majesties Dominions. The
Prince of Orange, (their General,) after many Debates, then told the
Embassador Carleton, that the Deputies of the several Cities in Holland,
Zealand, and Freizland, durst not touch upon those things, especially
that concerning Fisheries; there being in those three Maritine Pro∣vinces,
one Hundred and fifty thousand People, and upwards; that
had their Livelihoods, and Dependencies upon the Fisheries on the
British-Coasts; but desired him to Write to Secretary NAUNTON, to
move the King, that those Rights of Fisheries might be redeemed and
Purchased, for a Sum of Money; King Iames being unwilling to
treat upon those terms, all the Debates rested re in facta; What in∣estimable
loss and Damages the Crown of England, and the Subjects
thereof; (and more particularly the City of London,) have suffered in
the premises, is fit for a Parliament to inquire after; whereby
they may find what is become of all the old broad Gold, abased
in Holland, and afterwards bought up again for the English East-India
Company.
The main Scope of this following Remonstrance, is to give
Your Honours an Exact account of the matters of Fact, where∣in
those two Worthy Persons Sir William Courten, and Sir Paul Pyndar
were so grieved and oppressed; (that had been so necessary and
serviceable to the Crown and Kingdom of England,) and after them,
their Heirs, Executors, Administrators, and Creditors; there wants
no Vouchers within the Walls of this City, to make Evident to
the World, the truth of every Paragraph herein, that calls Aloud
for Relief from the Justice of a Parliament.
The several Abstracts of the following Cases, being of High
Import, to the Honour and Interest of the King and Kingdom,
may easily invite every Person that is a Lover of his Country, to
a thorow perusal thereof; and even to Gratifie himself, with some
Remarks not Vulgarly known; Obliging thereby,
Right Honourable,
And
Right Worshipfnl,
