THe great Abuse of many who
pretend the Publick Good,
when as indeed their chief
aim is only their private In∣terest,
(Multi res suas agunt communium praetextu)
made me for a great while unwilling to
appear upon the Stage, lest I should incur
the censure of some Zoilus or other, but
that the daily numerous Addresses unto
me (for relief not only for the present dire∣ful
Sickness, but also in divers other great

Distempers) by those who have been too
often frustrated in their expectations from
others; and the love I bear to this famous
City, of which I am a member; as also
the late encrease in the weekly Bill of Mor∣tality,
notwithstanding the Directions pub∣lished
by the Colledge, constrained me at
length to cast in this Mite, whereby I have
been, through the Mercy of the Almigh∣ty,
instrumental to many for their recove∣ry.
For though those Directions, and ma∣ny
other Medicines, are reported to have
been useful in former days; yet now fail∣ing,
there is a general longing and earnest
desire for some more powerful and more
effectual means; and if such be not spee∣dily
brought forth, a general Calamity is
seared likely to befall this City. And
therefore, spurr'd on by our Royal Sove∣raign's
most gracious care; as over all his
Subjects in general, so especially over this
famous City; as also his Majesties Prince∣ly
Countenance to all Ingenious persons,
that are able to lend a helping hand; and
your own ready compliance with his Ma∣jesties

Royal Care and Orders for his Ma∣jesties
Subjects health and preservation,
I thought good to present this Paper to
your Lordship and Worships, out of my
tender Love and Care of the Publick Wel∣fare,
which I did upon mature deliberati∣on
and consultation with other very able
and understanding Physicians,
(Plus eni vident oculi, quà oculus);
For I would not appear before you but
with such Remedies as are built upon so∣lid
grounds of sound Reason and mani∣fold
Experience. I do not intend to enlarge
my self in words at this time, the present
necessity (and daily encrease of the Sick∣ness,
even in the City it self aswell as in
the Suburbs) calling rather for deeds and
effectual help. It is true, that it is the
great Judgment of God which afflicts us,
our Prophaneness and manifold sins, pro∣voking
the just Indignation of Divine
Justice: However, the Lord even in the
midst of his Anger being not forgetful of
his Mercy, it behoveth both Divines and

those of our Profession, in the common
Calamity to stand in the Breach, and be∣come
Instruments to allay his Wrath, and
procure his Mercy, all according to our
several stations and sphears of activity;
and that all, of whatever degree, authori∣ty
or capacity, take heed, that we may not
oppress the Innocent, lest thereby we ex∣asperate
the Wrath kindled against us, but
rather asswage the same by mercy and
mildness. When it shall please God that
these Afflictions be over, I shall then
publish another Tract, concerning four
Diseases predominant in this City, which
I indeed intended to be first of all, but that
by this present very urgent necessity I am
prevented. In the mean time praying for
your temporal and eternal bliss, I rest,
Right Honourable and Right Worshipful,
