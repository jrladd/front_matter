WHEREAS a custome hath long preuailed a∣mong mortall mē (most singular Queene of hea∣uen) to dedicate their labours and workes to great men on earth, ei∣ther to aduance the glorie of their familie, by recording the worthie memorie of their vertues, for the perpetuall view of people &
nations, or els to gaine their singular loue and fauour by so speciall a grace, towards them and their posterity. Which albeit it be the full intent (if my mind deceiue me not) of them that labour to fill the world with knowledge: yet this kinde of gratitude (not to be misliked nor censured according to euery mans conceite) doth little auaile to further and helpe the imbecillity of humane vnderstanding, and to infuse the true spirit of the worke into the Readers minde, wher∣by he may attaine (specially in the Trea∣tises of spirituall discourses) to the know∣ledge of true Christianity, which onely by the direction and grace of the heauenly spi∣rit, leadeth a deuout soule out of the banish∣ment and peregrination of mortality, to the sacred fountaine of euerlasting felicity. Which happines being the whole intent, and the onely desire of the Author and Transla∣tour of this worke, and the true cause where∣fore thou (most mercifull Mother of Lore∣to) by so great a miracle, hast made thy most deare & most beloued house to follow the re∣ligion & honour of the Christian name from
Country to country, & frō place, to place, to incline the hartes of sinners to repētance, that the Father of heauē might be truly scrued & honoured vpon earth, and the worke of our Redemption take such effect in the fraile harts of thy deuout suppliants, that with great zeale they might wish thēselues wholy deuoted to the seruice of Allmighty God, & most desirously tast of that happines, which doth not onely giue life, but life without end, purchased and bought with the dearest bloud of the immaculate Lambe of God, for the inhabitants of the whole worlde. Among which that thy Owne Dowry may haue the grace once againe to reape the sin∣gular benefit of so heauenly a fauour, vouch∣safe, most glorious and before all creatures the most happy Mother of God, to receiue from the handes of an vnworthy seruitour of most B. Mary of Loreto (vnfaynedly desiring that true honour should be donne vnto thee) this labour, as a small token of his seruice, and euer bounden duty to the most B. Queene of Heauen: being most willing heerby (if so be it may stand with thy good
liking) to aduance & propagate the worthy and most comfortable name of most B. Mary of Loreto in euery angle, yea and in euery Christian hart of this distressed Iland: which indeed vnles it be performed by thee the generall Patronesse of our miseries, my slender endeuour (not worthy to obtaine for poore Lazarus the least crūbe that doth fall from the rich table of those heauenly ban∣kets) will little auaile. For these outward wordes may sound to small increase of sin∣cere deuotion, if the hart be shut from the true feeling of diuine mysteries: which by none more willingly, more admirably, and with lesse intreaty than by thee, eyther can, or are reuealed to those soules, which now sit in darknes, and in the shadow of death; drawne thither by the deceipt and fraude of thy enemies, with such lamentable woe, as most of thy Clients (heretofore much de∣uoted to thy holy Name) now by euill infor∣mation and damnable doctrine, seeme to make it an honour to their God, and a point of their religon, to renounce thy seruice, to contemne thy prayer, and from their hartes
to reiect thy thrice fortunate protection & helpe. But (O vouchsafe to heare) will the Mother of mercy, the gate of heauen, the glory of Hierusalem, the ioy of Israëll, turne her desired countenance, her merci∣full eyes, her melting bowells, her inflamed zeale of soules from her Owne Dowry, be∣sieged and fiercely assaulted with the deadly enemies of Mary, euen of Mary the Mo∣ther of God? Do not respect, looke not at abuses and great wrongs, thinke not of in∣iuries donne vnto thee; for now mercy is expected, now fauour is sought, now par∣don is obtayned for the greatest offenders, and by whome but by B. Mary of Loreto? The more peruerse, the more obstinate, and greater that the offenders conuerted be; the more glory doth come to Loreto the be∣loued Cell of thy habitation, and to Mary the giuer of all gifts and graces next after God: Which at thy beloued Loreto, are most aboundantly bestowed on them, that by thy holy intercession and meane, craue humble pardon of their sinnes from God. Therfore for the beloued name of Mary,
for the Mother of God, for Loreto it self, mollify and mercifully incline the hartes of them, that shall reade these thy wonders & miracles, inspire into them the light of grace, giue them (by thy holy intercession) true vnderstanding, prompt will, and willing perfourmance to imbrace all which belon∣geth to know the seruice of the true omni∣potent God, and of Iesus Christ, his and thy only Sonne. Which once performed, is not the straied sheepe found out, and carried on the Pastours shoulders to his fellowes, and placed in the cherishing bosome of his dea∣rest Mother the holy Catholike Church? Is not the prodigall Child receiued with all exultatiō & ioy againe into his Fathers fa∣uour? Is not dead Lazarus reuiued? doth not all heauen reioyce at the conuersion of a sinner? and doth it not sound with the praises of B. Mary of Loreto, whome All∣mighty God hath so glorified, that he hath made her the instrument and the meane to haue all the chosen sheepe of Christs flocke to returne to Paradise, and to tast of the immortall fountaine of saluation by her,
that as the most wretchedest of all women was the occasion of bringing all misery on our heads so the most glorious: not only of women, but of all creatures whatsoeuer, should direct and guide vs vnto our former state of blisse againe. Wherfore blessed Mo∣ther of mercy, and the most comfortable re∣fuge of all offenders, giue eare and harken, I beseeche thee, to these plaints of thy vn∣worthy suppliant. Neyther the voice of a wretched sinner, nor his poore wishes and praiers alone durst presume to present thē∣selues before so singular a Patronesse, to in∣treate so great a benefit, as pardon, peace, and grace for thy distressed England; if the merits of all holy Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, Confessours, Virgins, deuout Matrons (yea and that nothing at all may be wanting) euen thy owne aboundant & well-deseruing merits themselues did not come to intreate, to request, and to call vn∣to thee in behalf of this out-cast and aban∣doned Iland. If it be exceeding ioy and contentment to thee to haue Loreto glori∣fied and most reuerenced of all places in the
worlde, worke meanes with thy beloued Sonne, that this vnfruitfull vineyard may haue the earth and soile of her harte sowne with that heauenly seede which at Loreto is most aboūdantly powred from heauen in∣to the soules of thy deuout Clients: that all the people of our Countrey may reioyce, not only to haue vnderstanding, but also to see planted in their soules the beautifull flowres of the mysticall Paradise, where the spirituall Adā CHRIST IESVS our Lord and Sauiour was framed and made mā of the virginall earth of thy body, where he found all delicacies and dainty fruites of vertues, the sweetest flowers which hea∣uenly grace could produce, and the comfor∣tablest nourishment and food which An∣gells taste. Amidst which was made and framed the Lord of Angells in thee, the earthly Paradise of this world, and the ioy of our God: which doth well shew, that thou indeed (O glorious) art the Paradise which was neuer defiled, neuer was stained with any imperfection, nor neuer sawest the least ble∣mish of earthly corruptiō. Witnes herof not
only the glorious Resurrection of Christ our Lord thy Sonne, thy most happy Assum∣ption into heauen both in body and soule: but the very precinct, the circuite, and the place where this Paradise was planted; those very walls (I say) and the rest of the sacred House of Loreto it self, which by a great miracle haue stood from the very time that you liued till this day, without any altera∣tion or change at all, either by default of an∣tiquity or iniury of the weather: declaring vnto vs the rare wonders and mercies of All∣mighty God, who by his only will doth make mortall things immortall in a sort for euer. VVherfore that the gate of this Paradise may allwayes be open, and that all may haue free passage to gather the sweete flowers & seedes of vertue, which vndoubtedly do cure both spirituall & corporall infirmities; request, in∣treate, importune thy Lord, thy Creator, thy Sauiour, & thy Sonne, that the Angell may terrify & prohibite no longer, that the fiery sword of wrath & reuenge may be remoued, that in Loreto all may come to tast of the tree of life, whose fruit doth not only heale
and take away sinne, but also doth so com∣fort all them that be in distresse and mi∣sery, that neyther death nor the fruites therof can haue power to raigne in them any longer, but that the sacred fountaine of life it self, which there was made man to saue man, by thy B. merits, and most holy prayer, may most happily be planted, giuen, and bestowed on man to the well-fare of his euerlasting fe∣licity, and desired sal∣uation.
