AMONG
all the Learned
& worthy wri∣ters
of our age,
(worshipful Sir)
there is none to
my iudgement
more worthy of
perpetual prayse
than those which
haue most lear∣nedly
philosophied on the miserie of man (those I
say which contemplating & beholding the cala∣mities
of these dayes with the corruption of man

kind, haue not feared to set forth the liues & li∣uings
of al estates (to this end) that in reading &
hearing their miserable life and wicked conuer∣sation,
they be the soner moued to detest and ab∣horre
the same, and crie out with the Prophete
Dauid saying, I haue sinned Lord, and therevp∣pon
amende their wicked wayes. Among the
which the Author hereof named Peter Bo∣aystuau,
hath most worthilye set foorth this
present worke, not only in the French tongue to
the profit of his Countrie, but first of all in the
Latin tongue to his perpetuall and due prayse,
and to the profite of all Christian Countries and
Nations. Wherein he hath moste learnedly set
forth the corruption of all estates, so that those
that reade this present booke, can no otherwise do
but be ashamed of their vniust dealings. More∣ouer
least that man should dispaire of his salua∣tiō
in reading this pitiful Metamorphose or Tra∣gedie
(knowing themselues culpable) he hath
most worthily set forth the dignitie and excel∣lencie
of man, shewing him how much more in
excellencie he doth excell all other creatures whō
GOD hath created and made. So that this is in
sūme (Right Worshipfull Sir) the effect of this
rude translation, the which I thought good to

direct vnto your worship, and so much the rather
bicause of youre ripe iudgement and perfect
knowledge in the French tongue, the which as it
is well knowen to be vncomparable, so are the rest
of your most godly vertues, wherewith nature
hath endued you as a worthie and graue coun∣seller
to this honorable Citie of London. Receyue
therefore I besech you this my rude translation,
and it accepting in good part excuse my rash en∣terpise,
esteeming it as a zeale of my good
will, the which moste worthilye
vnto your worship I
haue directed.
