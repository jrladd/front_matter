Gentlemen,
THE ensuing Discourse was not com∣posed with any Design to be made Publick, and therefore wanteth that Cor∣rectness of Stile, and, perhaps too, that strict Coherence of Reasoning it ought other∣wise to have had. For which Reasons I ought in Prudence to have contented my self with that great Candor, wherewith you were pleased to receive it, and not to have run this needless Risque of exposing it to a more strict Examination. But I was rather wil∣ling
 to Oblige you, by complying with your Requests in this particular, than be studi∣ously careful for lesser matters. And besides the Design of it being truly Good, namely, to Vindicate the Providence of God, and to Assert its Influence in our late Happy Revo∣lution, I would hope it may not be altogether useless. That it may obtain this End, is, and (by the Grace of God) always shall be the Hearty Prayer of,
Gentlemen,
