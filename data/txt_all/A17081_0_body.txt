THis booke treating of the
Morall vertues, being now
to come vnder the censure
of the world, doth summon
me of it self to craue prote∣ction
from your Lordships
honorable fauour, as the
personage, who knowing best their worth, may
best protect him from the iniury of any that
should attempt to carpe the same. And my pri∣uate
obligations for your manifold fauours (a∣mong
which, the great benefite of my libertie,
and redeeming from a miserable captiuitie e∣uer
fresh in my remembrance) doth make me
hope, not onely of your Honors willingnesse to

patronize both my selfe and my labour; but also
that you wil be pleased therein to accept of the
humble and deuoted affection, wherwith most
reuerently I present it vnto your Lordshippe.
Vouchsafe therefore (my most honored good
Lord) to yeeld me the comfort of so gracious
an addition to your former fauors and benefits:
and to giue to all the yong Gentlemen of En∣gland
encouragement to embrace willingly
that good which they may receiue by reading
a booke of so good a subiect, the title whereof
bearing in front your noble name, shall giue
them cause to think it worthy to be passed with
the approbation of your graue iudgement.
VVhich being the most desired frute of my en∣deuour,
I will acknowledge as none of
the least of your great graces,
and euer rest
