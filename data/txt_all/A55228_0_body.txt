MY LORD,
THE concurrence of severall reasons, (each of
which were sufficient) have moved me to offer
to your gracious acceptance this Essay. First,
my duty to your Lordship as my Diocesan, who
may justly challenge from me some account of my employ∣ments.
Secondly, that gratitude which obligeth me to ac∣knowledge
your Lordships many favors extended to me and
mine. And thirdly the need of patronage and protection that
this Work hath, in regard that there is in it much stress
laid on such part of Learning, (the Orientall I mean,)
which of late, if not all along, hath had that unhappiness, as
to be scarce able to keep it self, not only from neglect,
but contempt, as needless; at least of not great use or neces∣sity.
In some places abroad where it formerly found great
encouragement, (if we may beleive generall complaints,)
it hath now little regard, although I doubt not but that it
will in good time recover its honor. That it may not be so

among us at home, it must ow to the favour and countenance
of men excelling as in authority and dignity, so in learning
and judgement; in which rank none being more eminent, so
none will be more ready to afford it then your Lordship,
who have your self alwaies been a lover of those Studies,
and by long experience know and have made known the use∣fulness
of them. I shall not here trouble your Lordship with
giving an account of what is in these Annotations done, that
being the proper work of the Preface. I shall only adde that
besides the former motives, I have a strong encouragement
to make this address to your Lordship from an assured con∣fidence,
that whatsoever it be that I bring, being the
best that I have at present, and proceeding from those in∣tentions
with which it is offered, it shall by your Lordship
be favouredly accepted from the hands of him who is
MY LORD
