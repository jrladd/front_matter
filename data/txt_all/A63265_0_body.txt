SIR,
I Am no stranger to your worth, though I am to your Person; The fame of the one makes me Ambiti∣ous to be known to the other. It hath been the goodnesse of all Noble Souls, to Communicate their Virtues to the feeble, by taking them into their Protection; The light of which leads me to the boldnesse of shel∣tring these Poems under your Patronage. And though (Sir) this Presumption may justly Merit your Check, yet when your Judgement shall dis∣cover their Nakednesse, and find how much they

need your fence against the storms their own weaknesse may draw upon them, your Native Sweetnesse (doubtlesse) will intercede for, and open the Sanctuary to
Sir,
