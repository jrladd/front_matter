¶ Most generous and redoubted Prince, The Honour and Ornament of your age; The Hope of your people; The Subiect and Obiect where∣on their most happy wishes dependeth; The STARRE of their fairest Fortune; The COM∣MET of dreadfull terrour to their enemies; The Index, Abstract, or Compendium of the very grea∣test Princes whatsoeuer.
HEere, vpon the rich Piller of your glorious name, do I hang vp The Trophees & the Honour of MY KING your Father, sowne through France, and dispersed ouer the whole world. Such holie spoiles are worthie your auouching, because they are due vnto none other, but onelie vnto your HIGHNESSE, in regarde
that a person who is so neere vnto you, hath conquered & won them: And his Triumphant Triumphes, are the auguries, harbingers, & vant∣currers of your infallible fortunes to come, euen as your owne Vertues do serue for a pattern and example, to them of MY LORD the Duke your Brother.
Accept them then My Lord, & by your fauorable looks, giue them all a speaking-power, as the Sunnes reflectiō did on the Image of Mem∣non. And beleeue, that as one of yours, you shall finde me readier to lay hand on my sword for you, then on my pen, and would rather spend my blood then mine Inke, for your honour and seruice, in al, and by all,
My young CAESAR, and great ALEXANDER.
