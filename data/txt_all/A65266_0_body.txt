MY LORD:
Had not my known obli∣gations
cōmanded my
praesent addresse unto
your Lordp. (to whose
bountie for diverse ye∣ares
past, & still, I owe as well my
being, as some benefit by those in∣tervalls
of studie wich our perse∣cuted
condition will admit) the sub∣ject

of this Discourse, which I pu∣blish,
would have pointed out your
patronage to my thoughts, who
have hitherto been such an eminent
Assertour of Christianitie by your life, &
of Monarchie by your Sword. What
defects are in it, too late seeke your
name for their cover, having allrea∣die
run their hazard of censure from
them, whose judgement I chieflie re∣verence,
& whose sole displeasure I
feare. If it may be own'd by your
Lordp. as the least title of my dutie
discharged, & by your honour cō∣mended
to any future opinion of
my disavowing to the vvorld all old
or new rebellion & Judaisme, I have
the end of my vvishes, & farther in∣couragement
to expresse my selfe:
MY LORD
