Right Honourable,
THat which sets the chiefest Diadem upon great persons, is not so much in their birth, and blood Royall, as in their Piety and Charity, such persons whose hearts God hath seasoned with the graces of his holy Spirit, they are of a hyer bloud, then those that are born from Emperors and great per∣sons, such as they are but born of the flesh, they are not born of the the Spirit: And Christ tells us, If we are not born of the Spirit, that eternall Royall seed, we shall never enter into the Kingdom of God. By this we find (My Lord) that there is a necessity to seek after this second birth, being of the Spirit, & from the Spirit of God, as our first birth is of the flesh, and from the flesh of men; the first birth is a fading birth that shall perish; the last birth is a lasting birth that shal never perish, it shal never dye, as Christ saith, viz. They shall never dye in the spirit, though they suffer death in the flesh, and our Saviour Christ bids his peopl, Not to fear them that can but kill the body, but are not able to destroy the soul.
My Lord, I hear many boast of their first birth, which is but from sinfull man at the best; but I hear but few in compari∣son of the other to boast or glory any thing in their second, which is from the highest birth Royall of all, inasmuch as the is none greater then he, who is not only called King of Kings, but King of the Saints, that is King of Kings to overpower them, for they are in hands like Rivers of water, that have their tydes, who have their flowings and swellings, eb∣bings

and fallings, as pleaseth the Lord; and he is also cal∣led the King of Saints, because he is their Governor and Protector; therefore he is not ashamed to say, I will be your Father, and you shall be my children; and Christ his dear Son, is not ashamed to call them Brethren. By this we find that the Saints, whether rich or poor, noble or ignoble, are in great favour with God and Christ.
And the Apostle St. James saith, God loves the poor that are rich in faith; and the poor so qualified, through the grace of Je∣sus Christ, are in a capacity to hav a right to the hy birth-right of the Royall bloud of Heaven, which is the hyest birth and bloud of all: And truly, My Lord, whereas God and Christ loves the poor, I re∣joyce when I see rich men, and great men love the poor that excell in vertue; And this I must speak to the Honor of your Excellency, that both your self, and the Officers of your Army, have been cordiall in propagating the cause of the poor, and their miseries, in that your Lord∣ship upon request of some wel-affected, to send two or three Letters, some of them to the Parliament, and one to the Lord Mayor of the City of London, late deceast, that they would improve their power and in∣terest for the carying on of this good work, That poor children that beg, may hav maintenance, imployment, and godly education; and all sorts of wandring poor kept under a daily government, whereby God may be glorified, and good peopl hav joy and comfort in it; 'tis a mercy to a Nation when great men are good men, seeking to advance Piety and Charity more then their own honors, and we hav cause to bles God, that hath made you instrumentall for the honor of God, and the good of the poor, and for the continuance of these mercies to the Nation: It shall be my daily prayer, with the peopl of God, that Piety and Charity may never fail you to your dying day, and that you may then everlastingly enjoy that heavenly birth-right, and by bloud Royall spoken of before.
