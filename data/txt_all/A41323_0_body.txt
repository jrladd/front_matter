May it please your Lordships,
YOur Commands first gave the ensuing Discourse Life, and now Publication; as to the latter, there is so little of my own in it, that I can thereby de∣sign not so much the publication of it, as of my obedience; But that there is so little, may I hope be believed, was more out of choice then necessity; for tho the notions of a Braine, rufsted and disordered by a violent and tedious Distemper, might fall short of any reasonable performance; yet there is no invention so weak or barren, but might upon such extraordinary occasion, abound with more then ordina∣ry productions. But indeed (considering our present circum∣stances) I thought nothing more proper for that occasion, then to lay open the Principle of that Church to which we are beholding for the design'd Treason of that Day.
And let their pretences to Loyalty, be what they will, yet they must give me leave to assert, that where the Popes Supremacy is maintain'd, there the King looses always so much in a Subject, as his Holiness gains in him.
I am very far, from the least design of exasperating your Lordships against any of that Profession now amongst us; Your prudent Conduct, (of which they themselves are wit∣nesses)

may I hope prove a more successfull instrument of their Reformation, then Ruine and Power. Your Lord∣ships Zeal for the Truth (without making use of either) is already conspicuous enough, and will yet more eminently ap∣pear, in Commanding these Sheets (that with so much plain∣ness assert it) to the Press.
Their dress I must submit to your Lordships favour, but their truth, to the greatest severity; if in the former, I have been so unhappy as to have done ill, yet (considering my present state) I have the happiness, that Charity may con∣strue I might have done better; Them together with my self, I lay at your Lordships feet, and beg leave to subscribe my self,
My Lords
