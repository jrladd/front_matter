Madam,
IF I were ignorant of your great Piety and Charity, many hundred Families would make me know it; you and your most worthy Family is always at work for the poor members of our blessed Saviour; you are another Dorcas, full of good works, your thoughts are al∣ways in heaven though you live upon the earth, your words tend continually to union and peace, and your great care is to work out your salvation with fear and trem∣bling; which is seen not onely in your pri∣vate
devotions, but in the publick ones, where I may say that you are a pious and godly ex∣ample to all others of your Sex; indeed the Church of England, among all the daugh∣ters she did procreate, there are few to be compared with you; but if your humility will not accept of that expression, permit me to make all the English world know that the Church never possessed a better one; for e∣very one knows that your house is a Temple, and a little Church where Vows and Prayers are continually sent up to heaven for the pre∣servation of the Church of England our mo∣ther, and for our gracious Prince, nay, for the conversion of those that are distant from the true knowledge of our Saviour, who came into the world to redeem us from our iniquities, the redemption of men being our Saviours meat, which I present you with as it was delivered by me in a Sermon, which I hope you will accept, being the meat which daily you and your worthy Family feed upon;
for I am not ignorant, that it is your singu∣lar pleasure and delectation; nay, I am sure that it is so agreeable unto you, that you will kindely receive it from him, who is,
Madam,
