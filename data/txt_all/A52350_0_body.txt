SIR,
AS You are justly Entitled to the greatest share of the Muses favours, so Poems that are done by those who give themselves the Honour of being their Representatives, could not fix on on a more deserving Patron.
The Sex, which the Authors are of, is an excuse for their performance, and as commendation to Your Acceptance, and though to fall under Your Censure, is to be examin'd by the nicest of
Judges, yet to have Recourse to a Gentleman, who is continually employ'd in Pardoning the Defects of Authors, and giving 'em
Encouragement to Write something Worthy of His Acceptance, takes off from the Apprehension of Your Displeasure, which I might otherwise Labour under.
The Ladies, indeed themselves, might have had a better Plea for Your Reception; but since the modesty which is Natural to the Sex they are of, will not suffer em to do that Violence to their Tempers, I think my self Oblig'd to make a Present of what is Written in Honour of the most Consummate POET amongst our English Dead to the most Distinguishing amongst the Living. You have been pleased already to shew Your Respect to his Memory, in contributing so largely to∣wards His Burial notwithstanding He had that un∣happiness of Conduct, when alive, to give you Cause to Disclaim the Protection of Him.
And though it may look something like innovation, upon the Practice of Men of my Profession, to take what is the business of Authors upon 'em, yet since I am not the first Bookseller that has Broken out off the Road, which is mark'd out for those of my Trade, I humbly beg leave to advance the Credit of the Papers which are my Property, by prefixing a Name which must needs stamp Authority upon em, and the Honour of Subscribing,
SIR,
