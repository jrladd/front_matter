MOst honor'd & belou'd! Enquire you why
A Lawyer meddles with Diuinitie?
I diue no seas profound of disputation,
But wade in shallow Fords of meditation:
I write no Systema, no Institution
No Babels Fall, nor Sions Restitution:
Nor whither Tithes by Law diuine are due,
Or doe to you by Positiue accrew:
These mysteries I leaue to sound Diuines,
That searched haue profundest Scripture-mines.
Seditious superstitious Nouelties
I hate; my mind I onely exercise
In your pure, easie, sweet, diuinest notions,
And them, at leasure, suit to my deuotions.
