My Dear Friends,
WHile I am preparing to remove my Con∣cerns, and settle among You, according to my duty in that Station which it has pleased God in his Pro∣vidence to place Me in; I have had many serious Thoughts how I may make my self most serviceable to your Souls. And finding among other things that there has been for several years past a sad neglect among you of the publick Instru∣ction of Children, and of their solemn taking upon them∣selves the Covenant that was made with God in their Names when they were Baptized; I have thought fit to begin with some Endeavours to remove this Fault; and in order thereunto do present you with some Considerations re∣lating to the Religious Education and Instruction of Chil∣dren in general, which I have chosen out of some Obser∣vations and Discourses that I formerly made for the use of those who were then under my Charge.

And I heartily pray that Almighty God will make this small Essay a means of promoting his Glory by prevailing on Parents to dis∣charge these main parts of their Duty towards their Children; To which if by his Blessing these Papers shall in any measure contribute, it will be an unspeakable comfort to
