May it please your Honour,
I Have here adventured by the truest Copies I could meet withall, to doe my best in these times of wished refor∣mation, to represent and set foorth the portraiture of the Ex∣chequer, as it was in its first institution and best perfection, so neere to the life as I could, sitting so farre off; To the end it
might, by a right understanding thereof, be restored to its ancient forme and proper working. In the description whereof (as it was in its said first institution and perfe∣ction,) the great wisedome and providence of our Ancestors will appeare principally in these three points: First, that no one Offi∣cer was to bee trusted alone in the receiving, charging, discharging, or issuing forth of the Kings Revenues: In that the Annuall or Great Roll of the Exchequer (being the Lord Treasurers Roll) and of so great esteeme in all ages, as that it hath been the Center and Repository wherein to all the Re∣venues of the Crowne, as well in the Ex∣chequer, as from all other Courts, were and still are to be reduced, was not intru∣sted with the Lord Treasurer alone, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer, by his Substitute or Deputy, is designed and ap∣pointed to write and keepe a double or counterpart thereof for controlment sake.
The second point wherein their great wisedome and care appeared, was, In that, as no Rent or Debt was to be charged in the said Annuall or Great Roll, upon any the Kings Subjects, but by good and just mat∣ter of Record, so the same (being once char∣ged) was not to be discharged againe, or to
bee set and posted of de anno in annum, or otherwise prolonged, but by like mat∣ter of Record, lest the same might thereby grow desperate, or become a grievance to his Majesties subjects.
And the third and last point was, In that for avoyding of all superfluous and un-necessary charge to the Crowne and subject, by having over-many hands in the Kings Purse, they did provide and fore-see that the Exchequer should not be char∣ged with moe persons then was necessary: And to that end that the Sheriffe of every Shire and County should bee the constant Minister for leavying and bringing in the Rents and Debts belonging to the Crowne.
Which Rules, if they had been observed, and continued in the Exchequer, according to their said first institution, many great losses and inconveniences which have beene occasioned both to the King and Subject, by the breach and discontinuance thereof, might have been prevented, as in the insu∣ing Treatise will appeare.
The causes which moved me, at this time, (contrary to my my owne will and approba∣tion, as knowing my owne insufficiencie) to publish this Treatise so unworthy of such
and so great a subject as this is, were prin∣cipally these which follow, namely:
First, that such unperfect Copies upon this subject, as had at any time come to se∣verall hands under my name, might bee re∣ctified and put into some method of cohe∣rence conducing to the worke intended.
A second cause was, to give satisfaction to some of my neere friends, who by their importunities (over-hastily before I could well deliberate thereof) thrust mee forward to doe it, as conceiving I might give some light and furtherance thereby to the great worke intended for the establishing and or∣dering of his Majesties Revenue, and the cutting off and taking away the superfluity of expences and abuses of Officers concer∣ning the same.
And in the last place, I was the rather induced to give way thereunto, in regard I speake nothing of my selfe, but what I have authority for, either by good matter of Re∣cord, or from the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome.
That which now remaines on my part to be desired, is, That your Honour being at this present (in the vacancie of a Lord Treasurer) the chiefest Officer of the Ex∣chequer; and one in whom his Majesty
(upon contemplation of your owne worth, hath reposed so great a trust and superinten∣dencie over his Revenues) will be pleased so farre to patronize these poore Indeavours of mine, (howsoever performed with great weaknesse and want of judgement) as (upon reading over the whole, and weighing the severall Authorities, Proofes, and Reasons, which are therein cited and set downe for warrant and confirmation thereof,) they may (for the matter) bee found worthy of your acceptation. And as there is a fitnesse of Dedication from me in this kinde, due to your Honour, in respect of your high place and authority in the Exchequer, so more particularly for your Noble favours alrea∣dy shewed to mee and mine, whereby I am obliged, and must ever acknowledge my selfe to be
