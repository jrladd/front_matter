May it please your Royal Highness,
THE Dedication of Books hath been so old, and still is so uni∣versal a custome, that to dis∣allow it, would be perhaps look'd upon as affecting Sin∣gularity a little too much; yet I could never learn any convincing reason for that Practice. The greatest Monarch
 that ever liv'd could not protect Books from Censure: and, I think, it were against reason they should▪ for except in matters of Faith and State▪ (and not in them neither, where the Almighty and his Vicegerents have set no limits,) no re∣straint should be laid on Men, to hinder their embracing and enjoying their own Opinions, and arguing against those of others. Wherefore I shall not be guilty of so high a presumption, as to beg from your Royal Highness the Patrociny of this Work of mine; in which, I have not the Vanity to doubt but that there may be many more Errors than I can well help. Nor shall I carry my Presumption to so extravagant a pitch, as to desire your Royal Highness to cast your Princely Eye on any thing contain'd in this Trea∣tise; You have given the World too publick demonstrations, how great a Master you are in the Art of War, to go to those Schools again, especially to learn from such as I am: And now in this happy calm under his Majesties most merciful Government, You are giving signal proofs of your great desire of Peace, notwithstanding your abilities and skill in War. I could enlarge my self much on this Head, without coming within the suspicion of Flattery, a sordid Vice in all Men, more especially in those who profess Arms. But my only design in
 this Humble Address is, with most sub∣missive thankfulness, to acknowledge the Princely favours, you have so Nobly, but I am afraid undeservedly, bestowed upon me; and to declare how ready I am to venture what remains of a Life, now almost worn out, in making all those dutiful returns that become,
May it please your Royal Highness,
