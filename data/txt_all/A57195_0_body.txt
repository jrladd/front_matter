Most Honoured,
I Esteem it a favourable Providence, that my first appearing thus publick∣ly should be in defence of so Noble a Cause, as that of Reforming the Man∣ners of Wicked Men, which has over∣come
the reluctance I had to the pub∣lishing of this Discourse. And the Post you bear in the Government of this Renowned City, besides the honour of being admitted to your Acquaintance, hath emboldned me to offer it to your Patronage.
The suppressing of Vice and Immorali∣ty, which have too long been the Reproach of our Nation, is such a work, as requires the Assistance of all that have any regard to Religion or Virtue: and it is not the least of our Publick Blessings, that so many of your Rank and Quality are ready to lend their helping hand to it.
This is a Design that greatly becomes Persons in your Station, and is truly worthy of Those that bear the highest Character. Your Zeal therefore in pro∣moting it will be your Glory while liv∣ing, and a considerable comfort to you in the hour of Death.

They who act in a lower Sphere direct their eyes to you for encouragement; and they are such as You that must ani∣mate 'em, and make 'em chearful in their work, who otherwise will be apt to faint and be discourag'd.
You are better known than to need the display of Your worthy Characters. And I much rather chuse to be silent than incur the least imputation of Flat∣tery. Yet I hope you'l pardon me that I have declared You the Friends of Virtue, and the Promoters of what is aimed at in the following Sermon, by Dedicating it to You.
I beseech you to accept it as a Testi∣mony of my unfeigned Gratitude for the Favours I have received from you: And espouse what I have end eavour'd to recommend to Persons of all Stati∣ous, that You may be reckon'd among our valuable Blessings; and as you
outshine others in the Honours of this World, you may partake of a larger share in the Glories of the other: which is the Humble and Hearty Prayer of,
GENTLEMEN,
