MY good Couzen, I know you expect from me somewhat touching the occurrents of this place, the haste of this bearer makes me brie∣fer then I would be, yet as time would giue me leaue, I haue written you the truth of a peece of seruice lately done by our Cauelires and Soul∣diers, vppon two Castles of the Turkes, by the helpe of a Greeke: the maner whereof, and the meane whereby, I haue truly, though briefely set you down: in which I know you wil reioyce with vs in Christ, vnder whose banner we fight, and to whome wee giue the glory of our victo∣ries.
Malta the 9. of October. 1603.
