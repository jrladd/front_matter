THe King was left an infant, most vnfit
To Raigne, by age: but not to rule, till when
He should attaine in time to riper wit,
Thereby to iudge the differences of men:
Yet, Crownd in Paris King of mighty France,
In tender yeeres almost an infant still,
His vncles and his Nobles did aduance

His Regal power, as did his father will
They should. But yet this King, a tender childe,
Was rul'd and ouer-rul'd by Tutors head.
For de-la-Poole his nonage then beguil'd
And brought King Rayners daughter to his bed:
Yet during nonage, or his kingly youth,
The valiant Dukes of Bedford, Glocester thoe
Salisbury, Shrewsbury Earles, these bent their truth
T'vphold him King of France in spite of foe.
In whose time, Talbot was a terror great
To all the French. For, as his dubbing drums
With armed souldiers did their walles downe beat:
So women fear'd their children, TALBOT comes.
Thus whil'st these Nobles liv'd, this Worthy thriues:
They being dead, then all was lost againe.
Salisbury, Talbot both did lose their liues,
Bedford likewise. Now both these valiants slaine,
This King at home drencht in domesticke strife,
Fierce factions set his Nobles at debate:
Some followed him, and some his head-strong wife,
Till Richard Duke of Yorke disturbd their State,
Who claimd the Crowne; yet neuer could attaine
The same: but Edward fourth his valiant sonne
Rose into Armes, though first his father slaine
At Wakefield, where the Queene a battell wonne.
With these and thousands moe, this worthy King
Tost and turmoyled, spent his Mortall time
Till Tyrant Gloster in the Tower did bring
To death this worthy Prince deuoide of crime:
In all his life who euer shunned euill,
Conquering Sinne, the World, the Flesh, the Deuill.
