SIthe my late trobles (right honorable, and singular good lord) my du∣tye hath made me careful to procure, that some frute of my studies might declare me thankefully mynded, towarde youre lordshippe, emōge other honorable, to whome I owe my self, with all my endeuore, and fruytes of studye. For the performance wherof, not onely your lord∣shippes late talke of a Prognostication, semed to make that argument fittest: but also the manifest imperfectiōs, and manifold errors yearly cō∣mitted, did craue the ayde of some that were both willinge, and able to performe the truth in lyke maters. I thought it therfore worthy the la∣bor, truly and brefely to collect many thinges, bothe necessarie, and plea∣sant, as well for Nobilitie as others: and to adioyne them to my general Prognostication, imprinted the yeare 1553. augmentinge diuerse wayes the same: and more orderly placing such as were before set forth. Your honor shal here receaue, in this litle boke, by infallible rules taught for euer, a truthe of all such thynges as heretofore haue ben put forth of o∣ther for one yeares profit onely, compelled thereby of necessitie to make a yearly renewinge of them: wherupon errors many encreased. You shal haue diuerse other conclusions generall, of none before attempted. These (right honorable lord) according vnto my dutie, I do present, and besech you in good worth to receaue: and haue willed them to passe vnder pro∣tection of your Lordshippes name: that yf to any, any commoditie ensue thereby, suche as receaue it, may haue cause to further me, in yeldinge thankes to youre honor.
