May it please your Grace,
ALthough for se∣veral
reasons I
ought in duty to
lay all my en∣deavours
at your Graces

feet, and beg your accep∣tance
of them; yet I was
the more encourag'd to
make this address, because
the subiect seemes natu∣rally
to have recourse to
your Graces Protection.
For the same Divine Pro∣vidence
that has made your
Grace Father of the Church,
has made you also Guardi∣an
of Humane Nature.
Which (as your Grace
well knows) has been so
vilely aspersed and perse∣cuted
by our Adversarie's
malicious suggestions, that

he is willing indeed to suf∣fer
such a word as man still
to remain amongst us, but
what was alwayes meant,
and design'd thereby, he
has endeavoured to chase
quite out of the world.
The vindication therefore
of Humane Nature could
not but seek for protecti∣on
from that great example
of humanity; whose con∣stant
practice doth alone a∣bundantly
confute all the
slanderers of mankind.
If Mr. Hobbs had been
pleased to have given on∣ly

a History or Roll of
the unjust or unfaithfull;
there would not then have
been such occasion to im∣portune
your Graces fa∣vouring
such attempts as
this. But when he teaches
that cheating is not only ac∣cording
to reason, but that
it is the first principle and
dictate thereof; for the ve∣ry
credit of being on rea∣son's
side, people shall count
themselves engaged to be
Knaves. And therefore I
have persumed to offer to
your Graces Patronage this

small discourse: wherein I
have endeavoured to shew
that those that are wick∣ed
and unrighteous are
not such by Reason, or
any advice of Humane
Nature, but onely be∣cause
they have a mind
to be so. And I am not al∣together
discourag'd from
thinking, that by this con∣sideration
of Mr. Hobbs's
State of Nature, and my
Introduction thereunto it
may appear to your Grace,
that it would not have been
an impossible thing to have

said somewhat to the rest
of his writings, wherein he
differs from what is gene∣rally
believed. But for me
to go about to inform your
Grace of the folly or incon∣veniences
of Mr Hobbs's
principles; would be next
unto his undertaking to
read lectures to all man∣kind.
Your Grace cannot but
understand, that the mat∣ters
insisted on in this Dia∣logue,
have been often re∣commended
to the protecti∣on
of great Persons, and

by those of eminent worth
and Learning: and if there
be any reason demanded
why this comes so late
from me; I have nothing
to offer in excuse, either
to your Grace, or those
that writ before me. But
yet however from some
experience of your Graces
favours towards me, what
I have performed, I hope
may not be altogether re∣jected:
notwithstanding
the manner of it, being
to appearance not so grave
and solid, does a little dis∣hearten

me. But, since
Mr. Hobbs by affected
garbs of speech, by a
starch'd Mathematical me∣thod,
by counterfeit ap∣pearances
of novelty and
singularity, by magisteri∣al
haughtinesse, confidence
and the like had cheated
some people into a vast
opinion of himself, and
into a beliefe of things ve∣ry
dangerous and false; I
did presume, with your
Graces pardon, to think
his writings so fond and
extravagant, as not to me∣rit

being opposed in good
earnest: and thereupon I
was very loth to give them
too much respect, and add
undue weight to them by a
solemn and serious confu∣tation.
And I hope my
Dialogue will not find the
less acceptance with your
Grace for those Letters
which follow after: for al∣though
some are loth to
believe the first Letters to
be innocent and useful (be∣ing
a little troublesome
and uneasie to their own
humour) yet your Grace,

I hope, is satisfied that the
Author of them, did hearti∣ly
therein study the credit
and advantage of the
Church, and that our Cler∣gy
would certainly be bet∣ter
reputed and more ser∣viceable,
were it possible
they all could be, as learn∣ed
and as bountiful as your
Grace. What I have now
perform'd, I humbly sub∣mit
to your Graces fa∣vourable
judgement; de∣siring
that it may be ac∣cepted
of, as an expres∣sion
of most dutyfull

and gratefull observance
