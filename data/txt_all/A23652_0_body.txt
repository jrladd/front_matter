ROYAL SIR,
THough I am of my self a Subject inconsiderable, yet that which I here adven∣ture to treat of, is of more worth. And, in good earnest, I should not have been reconciled to my self with the Dedication, had I not laid
a strict injunction upon it, in the first place, to visit the best of Families, that of Yours; to whom I owe not only my self, but all I have in the world. The Excellency in this Treatise is the Subject, otherwise (I must confess) twere much beneath your Highness countenance, cui majora debeantur: Yet, 'tis Golden chaffer, Sir, and if but stamp'd with your High∣nesses Acceptance, 'twill pass Currant, and I shall expose it to the surging bil∣lows of a Tempestuous World. 'Tis plain English, without any intermixture but what is meerly necessary; 'tis clad (for the most part) in its Mother Tongue, yet a little French puts it into the mode, and gives it a kind of Reputation. I thought it my Duty to invoke your High∣nesses Patronage; pardon my Ambition in it, and receive it as a pledge, and the
effect of abundance of regards towards You; and if your Highness judge aright, they may be weigh'd in the ballance with your greatest Admirers. These Conceptions are the true Issue of my Heart, as well as my Invention: Be pleased to cast but as kind an Eye upon them, as you have in your Infancy almost (as I may say) done upon the Author; but Time which hath worn out all things, hath him too out of your Remembrance. That which may be the greatest inducement to your Highness to read this small Product, is the Centre to which it truly points, and may be (God knows how soon) your own concern. 'Tis an old Art, but new reviv'd; 'tis the Refining and Sublimating of LOYALTY to such a pitch as may render it Gustfull, and all (if possible) after long Seducti∣ons, to their due Obedience to their law∣ful
PRINCE. And being banded by so good Authority, as indeed it is, it needs no Licence for its Publication, and your Highness cannot but give it a Caress.
