My most honoured LORD,
IT is well knowne that your Lord ship can as readily interpret my Author in his
 owne language & iaiome, as being thus changed into our native and most fami∣liar tongue. Neverthe∣lesse I have adventured (asking pardon if my boldnesse give distaste) to style your Lordship the Maecenas of this my han∣diworke. My weakenesse and want of skill in every respect, together with my forwardnesse and pre∣sumption to intermeddle out of my element, have
 prompted me, to flye to the sanctuary of your Lord∣ships protection. Such as expect that I should ra∣ther dedicate some Tac∣ticks or booke of Cheval∣ry to your Lordship may take this for satisfaction, that I have well observed your true devotion to Re∣ligion, which is the best or∣nament and addition to your Honour; and great is the happinesse when Reli∣gion and Military pro∣fession
 are met in so He∣roique a Center. The va∣riety arising from this co∣pious subject of Traditi∣ons, will invite your Lord∣ship to read DU MOU∣LIN with delight; but their modern incrochment (I meane the Romish) upon the Church & their presumptuous comparison with the sacred Scripture, will force your Lordship to reject them with scorne and greatest loathing.
 Cast your eye upon this lit∣tle volume, and vouchla e it your favourable opini∣on, such countenance will giv it life; receive it into your Lordships pat oage, for to that end I have pre∣sented it, and in that secu∣rity I humbly leave it; re∣commending your Lord∣ship to Gods holy safe∣guard.
