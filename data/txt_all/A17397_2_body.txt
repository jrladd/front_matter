HOw great the be∣nefit of assu∣rance of Gods fauour, and of our owne salua∣tion is, those onely know that are either scourged with the conflicts and terrors of their owne doubtings, or that are solaced and established with the sweet dewes of refreshing that arise from a rooted nd well grounded Faith. If men studie assurances so much for

their outward possessions in this world, how much more earnest and diligent should men be to assure Gods loue and the inheritance of the glory to come? There is not a clearer signe of a prophane heart, then to account these cares need∣lesse: nor doe I know a iuster exception against any religion, then that it should teach, that when a man hath done what he can to obserue the directions of that Religion, yet he cannot be sure he shall goe to Heauen.
But since I know that all that are possessed of the grace of Iesus Christ, doe account as∣surance great riches, I there∣fore conceiue hope that my paines about this subiect will not be altogether vnacceptable: and the rather because in this present Treatise I haue endea∣uoured

to expresse the signes of triall in a much more easie way then before; and besides haue added directions, that shew how a weake Christian may establish himselfe in his assu∣rance.
I make bold to dedicate my new assay herein vnto your Ladiship, You haue heard the substance hereof preached, and receiued it with much gladnesse; and in the priuate vse of these signes, you haue beene pleased to professe (to the glory of God) that you haue found much contentment and establishment of your owne assurance. Your eminencie in the sincere profession and pra∣ctise of true Religion, and the shining of the graces here trea∣ted of, long acknowledged by many witnesses, haue made

you worthy to bee publikely obserued and praysed in the Churches of Christ: and your great respect and fauour shew∣ed to mee, hath made this way of testifying my thankefulnes, but as a small pledge and assu∣rance of my desire to doe your Ladiship any seruice in the things of Iesus Christ. Thus beseeching God to enlarge the comforts of his Spirit in your heart, and to prosper you in all things that concerne the bles∣sed hope of the appearing of Iesus Christ our mighty God and Sauiour, end and rest,
