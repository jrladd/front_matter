Right Honourable:
EXcuse (I intreate) this my boldnesse, which proceedeth rather from Custome in others, then Curiosity in my Selfe, in presuming to prompt your Me∣mory in some things tending to the greatnes of your high place and Calling; You are now entred into one of the most famous Mairolties of the Christian World. You are also cald Fathers, Patrons of the Afflicted, and Procurators of the Publicke good. And whatsoever hath reference to the true consideration of Iustice and Mercy, may be Ana∣logically conferd upon pyous and iust Magistrates.
And for the Antiquity of your yearely Go∣vernment, I read that the Athenians elected

theirs Annually, and for no longer continuance: And so of the Carthagians, the Thebans, &c. And the Roman Senate held, that continued Magi∣stracy was in some respects unprofitable to the Weale-publicke, against which there was an Act in the Lawes of the twelve Tables. And it is thus concluded by the Learned, that the Domi∣nion of the greatest Magistrates which are Kings and Princes, ought to be perpetuall; but of the lesse which be Prators, Censors, and the like, only Ambulatory and Annuall. I conclude with that saying of a wise man, Prime Officers ought to Rule by Good Lawes, and commendable Ex∣ample, Iudge by Providence, Wisdome and Iu∣stice, and Defend by Prowes, Care, and Vigi∣lancy: These things I can but Dictate, of which your Lordship knoweth best how to Dispose: ever (as now) remayning your Honors
