My Lord,
THAT I Presume to Usher this Small Piece into the World under so Great a NAME, proceeds not from any Opini∣on, that the
Author, his La∣bours,
have Right to your Pa∣tronage; But, having Receiv'd an Honour from your Lord∣ship without Desert, I was un∣willing it should be also with∣out Gratitude.
The Subject of the follow∣ing Discourse (Jesus Christ) is so Noble, so Useful, and Com∣fortable, that it were Unpar∣donable in me to doubt a Free and Candid Reception, seeing that he is
Worthy of All Accep∣tation; and, that God doth with this his SON,
freely give the Worthy Receiver All things.
A more Precious Pearl is not to be found: And, if
God shall vouchsafe so great a Blessing, that within your Noble Heart these Lines may kindle an Ambition for the PURCHASE, the way will be to Imitate the Merchant in the GOSPEL, to Sell all things to Make it.
The Wealth, the Pleasures, and the Honours of this World must be Sold, Dismissed, and Parted with, if ever they shall dare to stand in Com∣petition with the Riches of his GRACE, or in the least attempt to draw away the Heart from his Love and Ser∣vice.

He that would be Purcha∣ser of this INESTIM BLE MERCHANDICE, must sell All, must tread under-foot all Opinion of Self-Righte∣ousness, or Merit, and with a Lively Faith lay hold on the Sufficiency of his Righ∣teousness onely: He must Sell All; he must Devote his Time, Health, Estate, Parts, Life, and all that he is, or hath, to Advance the Ho∣nour, Glory, and Praise of the Son of God Jesus Christ, and of the Father through him.
Hoping to be somewhat Serviceable to so Pious, yet
Difficult Undertakings, these Following Lines are Most Humbly Presented; thereby intending, not onely your PERSONAL, but the Ge∣neral Advantage.
While others, from your Unshaken Faith in, and Con∣stant Obedience to, the ever Blessed JESƲS, may ob∣serve, that though it be Hard, yet it is not Impos∣sible for the Rich to enter into the KINGDOM of GOD.
Where, in God's Time, may your Temporary Co∣ronet
be Exchanged into an Incorruptible CROWN of GLORY, is the Humble Prayer of,
