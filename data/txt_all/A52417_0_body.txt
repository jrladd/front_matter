SIR,
THE greatness of your Qua∣lity and Personal worth, consider'd with that Hap∣py Relation which has further en∣dear'd you to us, gives you so just a Title to these Performances, that I could not without an hei∣nous Alienation devote them to any other Patron. And therefore, however my boldness may be tax'd for making you so dispropor∣tionable

a Present, yet certainly I should have incurr'd more disho∣nour by witholding a Debt, and Presumption is a less Crime than Injustice.
Sir, 'tis by your kind Patron∣age and Protection (next to the favourable influences of a good Prince) that our Studies prosper, and our Laurels thrive and flou∣rish, and that any of us are in a capacity to throw in the least Sym∣bol into the Muses Exchequer. To whom then should the Fruits of this Sacred ground be offer'd, but to that Sun by whose genial influence they grow and ripen?
To you therefore I humbly present this Collection of Miscel∣lanies for the entertainment of

your leisure hours, which were composed at some of mine. I shall not beg your Protection any far∣ther than you shall find it worthy of it. I am only concern'd that you should hence conclude how well your (now more than ever fortunate) Society stands affect∣ed towards you, particularly how much you are honour'd and e∣steem'd by
Sir, 
All-Souls Coll. June 1. 1687.
