YOur Henfield well seated Palace with a Wood at its back, like a Mantle about a coat of Armes, which doth defend it from the North west windes; argueth, that it is good to be there, as it proves a daily ease to Travellers, who by four miles at once, shorten the tediousness of a too long jour∣ney; for I doe perswade my self, to heare many of them say, good cheer, its but four miles to Henfield Seat, and thence but so much more to a good Town, to re∣fresh and rest.
The present satisfaction of that seat, no doubt (My Lord) diminisheth the grief of the losse of Basing, and that Dolbier is no more (not a Prince of the Air, save the carcass of his head on a Pole) drawing lines of circumvallation above your Seats, but that there is now



(in stead of destroying powers) a blessed Prince, to whom may be justly applied, Post Nubila Phaebus, whose quick∣ning rayes do now promise Peace and Plenty.
May there never more such dark clouds appear as might be able to cause stormes to fall, and lay to the ground such an ornament to a Land, as Basing was. Yet if in any of your Lordships Seats works may be necessary, this little forerunner of a more great one, may be as acceptable as it is most respectfully tendred by me,
