MADAM,
THE Affliction your Ladyship is under for the loss of your Sight is so great, and your Complaints upon that occasion so just, that I can neither blame you for the one, nor excuse my self from pittying you for the other. And indeed since you have been so unhappy as to be de∣prived of the use of your Eyes, I think I owe your Ladyship so much Compassion, that I cannot better employ mine, than in writing you such a

Consolation, as the opportu∣nity of my New Retirement, with the serious Reflections I have lately made in it, will suggest.
And that I believe will be such, as is more peculiarly adapted to the Circumstance of your trouble, which tho oc∣casion'd by a Common Acci∣dent, yet, I find, proceeds up∣on an Uncommon Principle. For tho 'tis to be presumed that, notwithstanding your great Contempt of the World, it must be a considerable part of your Affliction to lose the Sight of some delectable Ob∣jects in it, since the Wisest of Men (from whom your Ladyship cannot much dissent)

after a censure of vanity past upon all things under Hea∣ven, is yet forc'd to confess that truly the Light is sweet,Eccles. 11.7. and a pleasant thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun; yet I perceive the chief reason why your Lady∣ship is so concern'd for the loss of your Sight, is because you are thereby deprived of Con∣versation with your Books, and consequently retarded in your earnest pursuit after Learning and Knowledge.
'Tis upon this hinge I know that the main weight of your Sorrow turns, and therefore you will not want a Specific proper for your Malady, if you should chance

to be convinced that our Learn∣ing is generally misplaced, and that such an importunate pursuit after Learning and Knowledge is no way agreeable to the present Station and condition of Man. For cer∣tainly you will no longer lament the loss of your Eyes, for disabling you from doing that, which perhaps would not be adviseable for you to do, if you had them again. If therefore you once come to be convinc'd of this, one main ground of your discontent is removed; and that you may, is the design of the following Reflections.
