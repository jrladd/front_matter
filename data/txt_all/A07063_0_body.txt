SINCE it hath flow'd with the current of my
humorous bloode, to affect (a little too much)
to be seriously fantasticall: here take (most re∣spected
Patron) the worthlesse present of my
slighter idlenes. If you vouchsaf not his protectiō
then, O thou sweetest perfectiō (Female beautie) shield mee
from the stopping of vineger bottles. Which most wished fa∣uour
if it faile me; then, Sinequeo flectere superos, A∣cheronta
mouebo. But yet, Honours redeemer, vertues
aduancer, religions shelter, and pieties fosterer, Yet, yet
I faint not in despaire of thy gratious affection & protection:
to which I onely shall euer rest most seruingmanlike, obsequi∣ously
making legs, and standing (after our free-borne English
garbe) bare headed.
