May it please your Honours,
THe humble Proposers observing some unnecessary charges and delay, introduced by the cor∣ruption and multitude of Of∣fices and Officers, which still increased, besides some incon∣veniences that the corrup∣tion of time had produced, the same being more obvious to them than others, by reason of their experience in the practice of the Law: for remedy thereof consulted how to apply themselves to the Parlia∣ment; and to that purpose had severall meetings together, wherein the Proposals now presented to your view were agreed on, as things that would conduce much to the ease, benefit, and safety of
the Suitor, make good provision against the most generall inconveniences, prevent many frivolous and unnecessary Suits, shorten the process in many, and ease the charge in all; and (which is not the least of their ambition) take away those Aspersions that seem to blemish that Law, the Law of Eng∣land, which they humbly conceive to be the most perfect Law of any humane Law in the World; a Law that admits Nullum absurdum, nothing against the Laws of God or Nature, against Rea∣son, or repugnant to any other Learning; wherein all matters of Fact are adjudged and tried by Twelve able discreet and indifferent Neighbors to the place where the Matter of Fact arises; and the Matters of Law are debated, adjudged, and determined by as many of the most ancient, grave, and learned Lawyers of the Nation, who for their great experience, integrity and wisdom, are first deservedly called to the state and degree of Ser∣jeants at Law, and after to be Judges; and the process of this Law is so quick, that it seldom happens any Cause at Law depends above three or four Terms: But Covetousness, the root of all evil, having built some floud-gates upon the Channel thereof, whereby the Course hath been obstructed, stopp'd, or diverted out of its due course, and thereby more care taken to catch the Fish for the benefit of the Officers, than for the dispatch and advance of the Clients business; and the Proposers being unwilling to trespass upon the Freehold of others by pulling down the Wares themselves, have by the drawing the Channel a nearer way in some
Cases, and in other upon a lower flat, have never∣theless so ordered the business, as they humbly conceive that most of the Grist will be ground without paying Toll at those unnecessary Mills. And because Reformation wrestles with many dif∣ficulties, it being hard to find an Ephesus without some Demetrius, or some Critick that will con∣clude the Shrubs seek the fall of the Cedars, ho∣ping thereby to advance their own tops. The Pro∣posers have been very tender not to propose any thing that may in the least degree seem to advance their own Interests, but many things that will turn to their particular loss, they alwayes prefer∣ring the publick good before their own particular interests. Neither have they rashly herein pro∣ceeded, having spent many months in the Concep∣tion, digesting, considering, and composing of what they now present to your more grave consi∣derations; and as they are not the issues of rash brains, so they have not passed without perusall and correction of many others of good judgement and experience, and are now to live and die un∣der your Honourable censures: whereby if you shall receive any light to the furthering the good work in hand, or the Republick any benefit, the Proposers have their wished ends, and humbly therein submit themselves and these their poor la∣bours to your better judgements, by the hands of the most humble of
