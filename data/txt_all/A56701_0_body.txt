My Lord,
I Had not the least thought, either when I penned or preach'd this Sermon, to publish it to the World; but have been overcome to yield to it, after a long resi∣stance (which is the reason it comes forth so late) by the importunity of a great num∣ber of my Parishioners: who perswade me, they shall reap some profit by the Reading, as, they tell me, they did by the Hearing of it.
If they so do, they are bound very much to your Lordship for it: by whose Eavour I was promoted to this Place: where your Kindness hath not grown less to Me, but so much increased; That I cannot but take this Opportunity to assure your Lord∣ship, it shall never be forgotten by,
My Lord,

Feb. 7th 1688/9
