YOu were pleased to appoint a Solemn and Extraordinary Fast, for your united Armies: and since that you have twice desired the Assembly of Di∣vines to Importune God for them: How acceptable all this hath been unto Him, you have experimentally found by the news of our Brethren surprizing of Newcastle (the last week) and the Castle it self (since that) and also by the news of hap∣py successe upon your Armies (neer to New∣bery) this week: It is not in vain, Nay it is very good to draw neer to God: No one prayer that gets to heaven is lost: Sometimes divine Wisdome doth take respite, but at this time di∣vine goodnesse made hast: you had scarce begun

This shall be the constant prayer of him, who de∣sires to live no longer then he is a servant to Truth, and both these,
