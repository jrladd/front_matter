Right Honorable,
I Would it were not my un∣happines to see the day, where∣in I should trouble You with such a sad story, as here I am bold humbly to present You. In it you will see, the faithfulnesse of a Servant, the Rewards of his Service, the Extremities he is in, and his encouraged hopes of finding relief from you.

His Petitions, I hope, will shortly find your eyes, or eares, or both: Oh let them not want your hearts, of which I cannot doubt, if your leisure will suffer you to peruse this naked Relation. I trouble you no more, but with this onely addition, that I shall be ever a most thankfull Hi∣storian of the reparation you shall afford me. And be,
