Right Worshipful,
IF I should not remember you, I should forget my selfe: you were my first patrons, under the wing of whose favour I lived about fifteen years, till the people came to be oppressed one by another, and the children behaved themselves proudly against the ancient,Isa. 3.5. and the base against the honorable. I suffred in the croud among others, by some trivial, and other false accusations, which if they had been of any weight, and proved true, the supreme authority at that time sitting, would not by Order have given me three parts of my Living, whereas other men had but a fist. I know my troubles came not upon me by your means, nor the de∣taining of that allowance from any disaffection to me: but being loath to stickle with some that overawed you at that time, by whose means I and mine have suffered much hard∣ship. However hoping that this lame child of mine, shall find admittance into your Hospitall, love, and favour, I commend it and my selfe to your service.
