AChilles, the great Commander of the Mirmidones, had no sooner (Right Worshipfull) encountred the hardie Troian with his Courtelax, and regi∣stred his valour on the helme of his e∣nemie, but returning to his tents, hee pourtraied with his pen the praise of Polixena, ioyning Amors with Armors, and the honor of his Learning with the resolution of his Launce. In the Olympiades the Laurell striued as well for the Pen, as the Speare: and Pallas had double Sacrifice, as well perfumes of torne papers, as Incense of broken truncheons. Entring (right worshipfull) with deep insight into these premis∣ses, I found blazoning your resolute indeuors in deeds of Armes, and report figuring out your euer-intended fauours to good letters: presuming vpon the courteous disposition of your Worship, I aduentured to present you, as Lucius did Caesar, who offered him an Helmet topt with Plumes in warres, and a booke stuffed with precepts in peace, knowing that Caesar held it as hono∣rable to be counted an Orator in the Court, as a Soul∣dier in the field. So (right worshipfull) after your re∣turne from the Low Countries, (passing ouer those praise-worthy resolutions executed vpon the enemie)

seeing absence from armes had transformed Campus Martius to mount Helicon, I ouerboldned my selfe to trouble your Worship, with the sight of my Metamor∣phosis: A pamphlet too simple to patronage vnder so worthy a Maecenas, and vnworthy to be viewed of you, whose thoughts are intended to more serious studies. Yet Augustus would read Poems, and write Rounde∣layes, her to purge melancholly with toyes, then for any delight in such trifles. So I hope your Worship wil, after long perusing of great volumes, cast a glance at my poore pamphlet: wherein is discouered the A∣natomy of womens affections: setting out as in a mir∣ror, how dangerous his hazard is, that sets his rest vp∣on loue: whose essence (if it haue any) is momentany, and effects variable. If either the method, or matter mislike, as wanting scholarisme in the one, or grauity in the other: yet if it shall serue your Worship as a tri∣fle to passe away the time, and so slip with patience, as a boord Iest, I shall be lesse grieued: if any way it please, as to procure you delight, I shall be glad  satisfied, as hauing gained the end of my labours: but howsoe∣uer, hoping your Worship will pardon my presumpti∣on in presenting; and weigh more of the well affected will, then of the bad labored worke, I wish your Wor∣ship such fortunate fauours, as you can desire, or I i∣magine.
