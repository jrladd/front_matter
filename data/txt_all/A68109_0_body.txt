THis sparke comes from the quenchlesse fire of my euer-burning loue, which (to your Highnesse) J sacrifice vpon the Altar of my spotlesse hart. Jn the seruent flames of this ardor, my Muse with restles flightring wings combur's, stil hoping to be Nourished with the radiant beames and propi∣tious splendors of those gratious Eyes. Then, O then let not the

Mistie Ʋapors of darke Obliuion o∣uercloud the bright quickenesse of such shining Suns. But rather let the Jnfluence of their admired ver∣tue exhaust these my rude lines vp into the rare and rich treasure of your Maisties superaboundant fa∣uor. So ending (to begin againe) J wish your Grace a most happie and long Reigne.
