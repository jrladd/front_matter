Most SERENE PRINCE,
THE Publishing of these First Essays of Natural Experiments, which for many Years have been made in our Academy, under the Protection, and with the Indefatigable Assistance of the most Serene Prince Leopold your Highness's Brother, will prove the happy occasion of giving fresh Testimonies (of your Highness's great Liberality) to all those parts of the World where Vertue is adorn'd with its deserved Lustre; and will create a new sense of Gratitude and Respect in all true Lovers of the more curious Arts, and Nobler Sciences. Especially we ought to frame our thoughts to a more humble Acknowledgment, as we are more nearly concerned and warmed by the cherish∣ing

Rays, and invigorating Influence of your Highness's bounty. Which with the favour of your Patronage, the incouraging invitation of your Mind, and proper Genius that way; but above all, with the Honour of your Presence, sometimes stooping to our Academy, sometimes commanding us to your Royal Apartments, has bestowed upon it an Immortal Name; Kindled Active Desires in our Breasts, and given an hap∣py encrease to our Studies. These considerati∣ons easily demonstrate, with what duty we are engaged to Consecrate the first Fruits of our Labours to your Highness's most Illustrious Name; since nothing can proceed from us, wherein you can have a greater share, and by consequence more due to you; nor any thing that may make fairer approaches to merit the happy Fate of your generous Acceptance. 'Tis certain, that through the Excess of so large and signal Favours, we can be sensible of no greater Resentments than to find our selves so much obliged to your Highness: not that we refuse to bear the Weight of so endearing and inestimable an Obligation; but onely because we would wish to be able to offer something not

purely your own; whence we might at least flatter our selves, That we had made some small return which your Highness might impute in some degree to our choice, and not wholy re∣dewable to your Highness Self, or Necessity· But we must rest satisfied with the bare desire of so just and deserved a Passion; since these new Philosophical Speculations are so deeply Ra∣dicated in your Highness's Protection, that not onely what is now produced by our Academy, but what ever shall be brought to Maturity in the most Famous Schools of Europe, or After Ages raise up, shall be likewise due to your Highness, as the gift of your Beneficence: since as long as the Sun, Planets, and Stars retain their glory, and Heaven endures, there will remain a glo∣rious Memory of one that contributes so much with his auspicious Influence to such new and strange Discoveries; opening an unbeaten Path for the least fallacious Method of search after Truth. Yet in so great a scarcity of Tributes, some little thing presents it self to manifest our grateful observance; which is the onely joy wherewith we support our Deficiency, while all redounds in more resplendant Glory to your

Highness, who having already acted your full Proportion of what ever new, good, and great, is at any time to be found in the Repository of Sciences, has enervated and discouraged all thoughts of emulation in others. This, and this alone are we able to lay at your Highness Feet, whose continual Protection we crave with Respect and Reverence, begging from Heaven the height of Prosperity and Grandure to your Highness.
