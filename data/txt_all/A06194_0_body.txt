Grace be giuen in Christ
BLessed, & beloued in the lord. The Christian sobriety▪ & cōfortable charitie vvhich I obserued in my table brothers occa∣sioned the cōposing of these hymnes. It vvas their goodnes to make them publique for the benefitt of others also. They are all deuine songs, yea from meditations of the scripture are they dravvne. If you shall vse them in your priuate families to gods glorie,

ur ovvne solace, & to the instructiō, edification of your children I haue e end of my desire. Receaue them as e symptomes of my soules affection the generall aduancment of gods uice, to the priuate consolation of you your children, & to the praise, and nour of our ovvne mother tongue. us in the midest of manie harshe mes of grudge, and despite I haue arned to tune the songs of Sion. For vvhich I praise god, and shall neuer ase to pray for your blessednes in the uing mercies of Iesus Christ his uours. resting
