MADAM,
'TIS the Fate of Books that treat of Subjects too subtil and deli∣cate for Vulgar Eyes (and such are all Treatises of the Mysterious Science of PHYSICK) though never so useful and necessary, to meet with a general Neglect and Discountenance in the World, unless recommended under the Patronage of some Illustrious Name.

There is a peculiar Charm in the Ver∣tues of Great Personages, to Authorize whatever they Protect, and to command a Respect for all that is honoured with their Umbrage, from the most sullen and obstinate. That they are pleased to ho∣nour any thing with their Regard, con∣vinceth common Judgments more of its worth, and endears it more to them than a thousand Arguments: for there indeed they find the Force of Reason embodied, which otherwise is as invisible to them as Angels. Such, Madam, was my Case, and such a generous Protection I stood in need of, when it pleas'd Providence to relieve me in this Perplexity, by bringing into my thoughts the Consideration of all your shining Virtues and Excellencies, whose Lustre was so bright, that it could not but reach me, though wrapt up in never so much privacy and obscurity. I considered that your profound and un∣fathom'd Knowledge could defend this poor Piece from the Ignorant; that your admirable Sweetness, Generosity and Majestick Heroickness could patronage it from the Envious and Impertinent;

and to Crown all, that you had Good∣ness enough to receive it into your Patro∣nage: I was also encouraged to this Pre∣sumption, from the Splendor you de∣rive from the Noble Ancient Family you sprung off: And hence I take the Bold∣ness to acquaint your Ladiship, that these have some Relation to your Lady∣ship, they being the Collections for the most part (which I had hitherto reserved) of your incomparable Kinsman, and my truly Honourable Master, Sir Kenlm Digby; whom I had the Honour to serve for many years beyond the Seas, as well as in England; and so continued with him till his dying Day, and of whose Generosity and Bounty I have sufficient∣ly tasted, and no less of your Illustrious Father's, both before and after my Glorious Master's Decease; so that this Trouble I give your Ladiship (who is the true and undoubted Inheritrix of all your Noble Fathers Virtues results from the Innate Candor and Goodness of your Illustrious Stem.
What I have here Collected, having implor'd your Ladiships Pardon for my Boldness, I most humbly Lay at your Ladiships Feet; and remain,
MADAM,
