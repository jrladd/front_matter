SIR,
IT has been an Inveterate Objection against the Society of Poets, that
their most Natural and Regular Performances have been at best but
the forc'd and spurious Off-springs of Bribery or Ambition; The Fal∣sity
of which will be very obvious from the Characters of the Objectors,
who have been ever look'd upon by the more impartial Criticks, as a Pack
of envious Pedants; as much beneath a Capacity of Conceiving, as a
Power, or Desire of Emulating their most Excellent Patterns; whereas the
true and genuine Springs that actuate a Poet's Invention, are the Actions,
and Passions of Hero's; The mighty Purposes, and Designs of Worthies;

And, in short, all the Eminent Productions of Great Souls: And the very
Original Title of his Profession will allow him only to Copy out and Imitate
the more remarkable strokes of the Great Ones: In which Province he is
so much unworthy of Censure, that he seems to serve an apparent Turn of
Providence, by supplying the defects of Age, and Memory, with Immortal Ta∣bles
and Monuments, which Rescue the History of Honourable Acts from the
devouring Efforts of Fate and Oblivion.
But I do not offer this to Reconcile Your Grace to a favourable Opinion
of that Order, as hoping my self to be included in the Gracious Indemnity,
(For I have no Pretensions to the Adoption of Phoebus, tho' have always
admir'd that noble Oeconomy,) But because I know how much the Favour
and Patronage of so great a Mecoenas would acuate and encourage the In∣genuity
and Industry of the more refin'd, Wits vigorously to pursue the
Roman Paiterns, and recover the clapsed Majesty of that Incomparable
Style.
But when I saw that Matchless Scene, which, by this time, All Europe
knows the late Funeral was: When I consider'd the singular Occasion, the
Death of that Illustrious Princess, of whose Worth the most speculative
Head can scarce form an adaequate Idea; The Order and Harmony of the
whole Proceeding, And have since observ'd the great Omission of those
Encomiums that were due, even from those that have boasted of a Ta∣lent,
I could not but presume to offer this little Specimen of my private
Sense; And have at last ventur'd to Intitle it to Your Grace, as the
Great Master of the Publick Solemnities; Being till now deterr'd from the
Attempt, by the sense of those many Imperfections which are chargeable upon
it. VVhen I remember'd the Maxim, viz. Of two Evils, choose the least, I
thought it more eligible to be too obsequious, than neglectful.
Therefore I humbly desire to shelter these Lines under Your Grace's Pro∣tection,
hoping the Defects and Irregularities that their Author has In∣truded
on You, will be Remitted upon his Promise; that when Maturity and
Experience shall have prun'd the lavish Crescences of his Pen, and regu∣lated
both his Thoughts and VVords by the best Models, something shall
then be offer'd more worthy of their Patron by,
May it please Your GRACE,
