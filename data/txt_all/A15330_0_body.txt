Right Honourable:
SVch is the Leprosie of Ingratitude, that scarce Luke 17. one in ten comes backe to be thankfull: and God seemes to give a checke to mans nature, in placing Memory be∣hind in the head, as being an Embleme of our dulnesse, in rendring the Offices
 of Gratitude. I must, and ever will ac∣knowledge to Gods glory, and your Honour, that as I had my being from above, so have I my bene esse from your bounty, in so much that (as Saint Paul to Philemon) I owe unto you even mine Philem. 19. owne selfe.
With that Samaritan in the Gospell, Luc. 17. 15. 16. I am at length come backe againe to wor∣ship, and to present you with these false fires, to make my Duty and Affection le∣gible; ut Dei, ita est eorum qui Dei in ter∣ris Rex Platon. vices obeunt, pro sua immensitate be∣neficia largiri, sed hominum gratitudi∣nem, ex eorum modulo aestimare.
Long hath mine heart burnt within me, Psal. 39. 3. with an earnest, Quid retribuam? In re∣gard Psal. 116. 12. of those gratious encouragements, by your Honour conferd upon me. Nor have I slept in the Land of forgetfulnesse, but waited opportunity to vent my selfe;
 and now I have borrowed so much strength of boldnesse, as to lift up the eyes of Hope, presuming to prefer these flashes to your view; in the which as the bad-borrowers of these dayes, I doe pay my great debts by small Pensions.
If this mine Adventure shall finde such admittance, as to give the least life to my riper studies, I shall not suffer my Temples to rest, till I be delivered of a Psal. 132. 4. stronger birth.
Coelum quietem sortitur in motu, I shal ever account it my heaven upon earth, to labour to shew forth my thankfulnes, and to pray with a flaming heart, that Gen. 49. 22. 26. the blessing of Ioseph light upon you.
Decem. 15. 1632.
