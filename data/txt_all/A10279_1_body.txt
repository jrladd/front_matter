GEentlemen,
Matter is bet∣ter
than words.
If you bee no∣ble,
worthy, and ingenuous,
these many precipitations
I here discover, need no
other effect than honest pi∣ty:
but if these endow∣ments

of the minde bee ex∣cluded,
either by the rash∣nesse
of Youth (an ill Tu∣tour);
or by violent prodi∣gality
and licentiousnesse,
(a worse Disciple); My
desire is, that my serious
lightnesse, may arrow-like
pierce your Consciences, to
an unfained repentance.
The more you are contri∣state,
the lesse will be your
sorrow; for to lament, is
here to rejoyce: and such
joy I wish may be accumu∣lated
on you, and on all

those, that either love
goodnesse, or are estranged
from it. The reason why I
present this Booke in chiefe
to you (after the interessed
Dedication) is, because
being my selfe, of one of
your Societies, my obser∣vation
and experiment hath
made mee conjecture, that
these two should never bee
unwelcome, Advice and
Delight. The first where∣of,
if my Booke doe not
instruct, yet mine owne
deviation (still knowne to

many) may, seeing there is
no stability in bubbling
pleasure, nor no true con∣tent
without a religious re∣turne;
so you have both
precept and example. And
as for the latter, it is bet∣ter
wisht than described.
Reade and judge.
