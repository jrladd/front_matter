SJR, J here tender to your view my Sermon prea∣ched at your instance, heard with your best at∣tention, pressed to the Presse by im∣portunitie of friends: occasioned by those many abbreuiations, whereto the iniunction of breuitie from superiours forced me. The summe of the whole is this: Therein see you your station in the Common-wealth warranted by Gods ordinance: the rich Grace of
 God in your aduancement to so emi∣nent dignitie: withall, the dutie the Lord expects from you in respect of your aduancement. To preuent pride, you are remembred of humane frail∣tie: to procure vprightnesse in procee∣dings iudiciall, the terrours of the Lords iudgement are offered to your meditation. Vse it as your direction to these ends: and thus thinke of the Author, he had rather be deemed any thing then vnthankfull. So with my prayers to God for continu∣ance and multiplication of all hea∣uenly and earthly blessings vpon you, J rest

From Pitmister,
Iuly 25. 1616.
