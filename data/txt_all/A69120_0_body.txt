HAuing already presented your Ho∣nour, with the Third and Fourth Bookes of this famous History of Amadis de Gaule, and standing enga∣ged by my promise, to translate so many more of them, as time and your noble acceptance shall thereto enable me; finding also those two imprinted parts, to appeare as a bo∣dy without an head, because these former Bookes are the guide and dirction to them all: I haue now finished them, and therefore make a fresh representation of them all foure to your Honour. The fift, sixt, seuenth and eight Bookes (being already in good forwardnesse of translation) with as much expedition as possible may bee, and your wor∣thy encouragement for their proceeding; shall very shortly present themselues before you, in the best habit that mine a∣bility can put vpon them.
It is not vnknwne to your honour, that the manifolde im∣pressions of this history, the Bookes thereof being now come to be fiue and twentie in number, and printed in places farre distant a sunder: through neglect in the publishers, or defect of the Bookes which are perfect indeede, many false volumes haue flowne abroade, and the world thereby very much abu∣sed.

But by the helpe of that worthy Lady, I haue had such Bookes as were of the best editions, and them (as I haue alrea∣dy begun) I intend to follow.
In the meane time (Noble Lord) accept of these foure Bookes I beseech you, and defend them from the venomous tongue of foule mouthde detraction, burying all my imper∣fections heerein committed, in the vrgent importunitie of that worthy Lady, by whom I haue thus boldly presumed, & the rest will beare me blamelesse against your least mislike.
