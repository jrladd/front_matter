I recom∣mend them to your Lordships safe protection: protesting that with them, I will be alwayes prest to performe all such duties to your Honour as God shall inable mee vnto, both in praying for your health, and increase of zeale, to the comfort and maintenaunce of his poore flocke, which I resolue
 is the end and onely ayme of all your honourable purposes. Thus beeing ouer-bolde, but in an ho∣nest cause, I take my leaue, commending you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you vp further, and to giue you an inhe∣ritance Acts. 20, 32, among them that are sanctified.
