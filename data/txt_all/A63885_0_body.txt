My most Honoured Friends,
THough I could heartily wish you had been pleased to reserve for some better occasion the just power you have with me, and that you had demanded some other proofs of the due regard I must have to all your motions, instead of obliging me to publish this very plain discourse, yet I should not make you a suitable return for all the Honour you have done me, should I obstinately refuse whatever you earnestly request; but whatever credit I may lose (if I have any to lose) I shall not think I have lost my labour, if I can perswade my Brethren of the House of Levi, to take special care that this Charity begin at home, this great Charity of Re∣ligious
 Education. The best portion that any Parents can leave their Children, the only considerable Portion that many of the best Clergy-men can leave theirs; and one of the best Legacies they can leave this Corporation will be such well bred Children, as will deserve that Character St. Paul bestows on Timothy, Who will naturally care for your state. For to make our Children as perfectly good Christians as they ought to be, will be the most effectual means to tye them fast to the Interests of this Body; the stiff abet∣ters of the good Old Cause in Scotland, have ignorance and impudence enough to Christen their Children into the solemn League and Covenant (as if that were the Covenant of Grace, and so do some of them call it.) Let us show as much zeal and more according to knowlege, by bringing our Youth to keep their Baptismal Vow, and then they will never fail to Honour and Love the Church in which they were Born and Baptiz'd. But e∣specially, Let all the Sons of Church-men be so well Tutor'd and Taught, that they may be secur'd and settled in this resolution, to live and dy true Sons of the Church of England.
