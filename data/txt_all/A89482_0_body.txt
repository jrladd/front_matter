Deare Mistris,
OUt of that spare time, stollen from the houres of my more serious studies, I have here from variety of objects, extracted and rough-drawne a few light Meditations, the extravagan∣cies of a lighter braine, which I have esumed to dedicate to your Name, hoping that om it, they will gaine both weight and credit: A pre∣nt, I confesse, too meane for so great vertue, yet  assured confidence of your goodnesse, that you ill not so much looke at the meannesse of the gift,  the good will of the giver, and accept it, because  comes from a friend, was the maine cause of my oldnesse, which if you please to pardon, adding ithall a grant of my desire, acceptance, I shall not nly acknowledge my selfe to be bound to you by the trictest tye of friendship, but shall be bound to ac∣nowledge my selfe
Mrs.
