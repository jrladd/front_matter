RAre Chrisolite of vertues treasurie,
Within whose lookes rarieties doe daunce,
In liuing Corrall and pure Yourie,
Enamelling your modest countenance,
Whose holy life like Angels attomies,
Make strangers giue you tributarie praise,
Adamaske blush which by no dieing dies
But springs when death Lifes prentiship decayes.


In steed of siluer Vallance let me draw
Your fauours heauenly in Diapor
On these complaintes of Astrabonica,
Ambrosian Ladie if you grant it her
My Muse shall make your worship loÌ„ger knowne,
Then Nymphs or Charactries on marble stone
