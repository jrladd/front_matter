My Lord,
I Must confess the Presumption of this Ad∣dress, to seek so great a Patronage for so small a Performance: But when nothing would satisfie some, without my consenting now to
appear thus openly; never durst I think of exposing so invidious Reflections, a Name remarkable for nothing but your Honor's Favours, under any weak∣er shelter than that which I now make bold to beg. But if what is here submitted to common Inspection, may find no further Approbation, but the bare for∣givness of so piercing a Judge of Style and Sense; I may harden my self against the Shock of all other Censures. And the same Charity which was the Tem∣ptation to this Impression, will, I hope, answer for all Imputations on your Honor's Judgment, for par∣doning a Piece so Mean and Dilute: Which if it must carry the sound of my despicable Name, any further than the little Circumference wherein it is already known; I shall think it to good purpose on∣ly so far, as it serves to exemplifie the thank∣fulness which I Preach; in Publishing the con∣tinued Munificence of such a truly Noble Pa∣tron, as, for above Twenty Years, I have found. To tell of which, I am Conscious, I do my self too great an Honor: But I had rather be charg'd with Ostentation of such Favours, than really in∣cur the worse Guilt of Ingratitude for them.

My Lord, I have not recover'd the Tran∣sport, which the late surprising Redemption gave me; and while I am entertaining my self with such daling Splendors, (as kind Heaven darted in upon us at the Critical Juncture, when a com∣plication of ill Omens were presaging the most Dis∣mal Night ready to Involve us:) I humbly beg some Indulgence, if (like the reputed Head of Infallibility himself, in the Transfiguration,) I speak some things more Warm and Affectionate, than Exact and Apposite. But whatever Ecstacy the Wonder and Joy of this Reviving Scene have occasion'd, yet of this I cannot chuse but be ex∣tremely sensible, that (besides my own biggest Ob∣ligations,) there's a just Debt of the highest Ho∣nor and Gratitude, for which the Publick is Re∣sponsible to Your Lordship, for your Conduct, so Wise, and Worthy your Noble Self, in that Happy Settlement, whereof we are glad. And however my forwardness to express the Pleasure I have taken in it, may already have render'd me as cheap as I can be, in the Opinion of such as look with an Evil Eye upon that very thing, which others
most cheerfully embrace with all thankfulness; yet cannot I omit any fit Occasions of Declaring, That with all my Soul, I do Bless the God of Heaven for it. And as your Honour has still been most deservedly great in my Thoughts, on many other Considerations; so in particular, for your Honor's Favour to that Revolution, which eases the Minds, and exhilarates the Spirits of all Well-Willers to the Reformed Religion, I am more than ever,
My Lord,
