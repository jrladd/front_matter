SIR,
WHen I had finisht this small Poem, I threw my lavish eyes with heedful care a∣bout the World in quest of a Gen∣tleman, equally accomplisht with Knowledg and Candour, that he might be as able to judg, as willing to excuse, the trips and failings of my Virgin Muse. I had not bin long in this search, when your tall
Worth, like the Hebrew King, out∣stript the dwarfish Crowd, and pre∣sented it self so obviously to my View, that I must have bin as blind in not discerning it, as unjust in not preferring it before others. So that Sir, like the Roman Gallant, it was your own perfumes, I mean the na∣tural endowments, and envy'd ac∣quirements of your wealthy mind, which alone have betray'd you: Had a lazy merrit still suffer'd you with the drowsie Herd, to wallow in the common Puddle, like them, you might yet have slumber'd away your life in a bruitish obscurity; and when age and succession had pusht you into immortality, you need not have undergone the wrack of ha∣ving
your name sever'd from your Body, but both might have layn quietly together, huddl'd up, and forgotten in the common dust.
But you Sir, by accumulating new virtues to those of your re∣nowned Ancestors, have run though a more noble, yet a more dangerous fate: For as by this means you have purchased an immortal reputation, so you have laid your self open and obnoxious to the ap∣plauses, or rather persecutions, not only of the ingenious, but of meer pretenders to ingenuity also; who so fit to Patronize the more accurate works of the best Authors, or to incourage the more incorrect indea∣vours of the meaner, as your self?
who by a double tenure of Birth, and acquirements, may justly lay claim to those scatterd Dividuums, which go to the composition of a compleat Gentleman: For as indul∣gent Nature seem'd to take a parti∣cular care to ennoble your Blood, in deriving you from an Ancient Family, so you have shown as great a Circumspection, in deporting your self as a worthy stem of so ho∣nourable a Stock: For besides those Hereditary Virtues of Generosi∣ty, Clemency, Affability and Cha∣rity, which have bin the constant Concomitants of your renowned Progenitors, and so descend to you, like your Estate, by Succes∣sion; your Nature love to inge∣nuity,
as it adapted you in your youth to a Literate Education, so it hath prompted you since to a large proficiency in all the Sciences, which being season'd with the ne∣cessary experience of a Genteel and Generous Conversation, has render'd you no less admirable, then acceptable to all the Lovers of Wit or Learning.
It was these Glittering Accom∣plishments which lighted the Hea∣then Gods to take Sanctuary under the secure umbrage of your happy protection, where they hope for a more certain immortality then they could expect from the minute Reputation of the inconsiderable Author. I cannot commend to
you their Garb, whether you con∣sider them either in Verse or Sculp∣ture; the Epistle to the Reader will more fully inform you of the misfortune that happened to them in their Rigging. Only thus much I shall say for my self, that were I assur'd they were Deckt in all the Gayest habiliments of Poesie, I could not be prouder of so cor∣rect a Composition, then I am of any opportunity wherein I may subscribe my self
