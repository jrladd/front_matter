SIR,
SOme years are elapsed, since I tooke notice, and became
sensible of that sin which this Tract here declaimes a∣gainst.
Being driven by men, but led by the marvel∣lous
providence of God to this City, I observed my
feares did not deceive me; but as then I did divine, so it is come to
passe, that this sin hath filled this City with rents and errours; where∣by
the spirit of supplication and walking humbly with our God, the
spirit of love, minding the publike, and seeking one anothers good
hath left us, and instead hereof an evill spirit of censuring, scoffing,
insulting on weaknesses, wrangling, maintaining particular parties,
projecting how to promote selfe ends with neglect of the publike,
evill jealousies and reports of one another, and which is to be feared,
inward rejoycing at one anothers harmes, hath overtaken even a
great number of those, who a few yeares agoe seemed to be of another
temper. I have now out of a deepe sense of the evils this sin hath
brought upon us, resolved to publish this Treatise, as a monitory to
men, to avoid this idolizing of men, as an evill savour that may
infect them, and to purge it out of their spirits as an evill humour
that may engender dangerous fevers in their soules, and is likely
to make this generation worse and worse; And as a forerunner to
such Works as God shall enable me to publish, for clearing of the
truth to those that in this time are deceived, by their dependence on
their admired Teachers: The memorable kindnesses which you
have been pleased to exhibit to me in my low estate, and the cordiall
affection I perceive you beare to the prosperity of Christs King∣dome,
engage me to present this Sermon to you, as for your use, so for
some testimony of his gratitude, who desires to approve himselfe
