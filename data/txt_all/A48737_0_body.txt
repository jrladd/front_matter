MADAME,
THe Design of
This plain
Treatise being to

Infuse Notions of
Peace & Obedience
into the Minds of
the Multitude, by
a familiar Declara∣tion
of the Grounds
of Christianity, I
could not think
how to recom∣mend
it to publick
Use with fairer

Advantage, then
from Your High∣ness
Hands; who, as
You are in Your
Person, both for
Natural Endow∣ments
and Moral
Excellencies, the
Miroir of Your
Sex: so in Your Re∣lations,
are the

Wife of a Prince,
whose Heroical
Vertues render'd
Him the Delight
& Terrour of For∣reign
Nations; and
the Daughter of a
Statesman, whose
Wisdom is the Pil∣lar
of publick In∣terest,
and His

Counsels the But∣tress
of our Peace.
Indeed the Sub∣ject
doth of it self
challenge a Reve∣rence
from the
Reader, & Useful∣ness
is a just Apo∣logy
for Plainness,
besides that Sa∣cred
Truths shew

best when they are
seen in their own
Light, and have
that Native Beau∣ty
about them,
that they stand
not in need of
Additional Helps
of Art: Yet to se∣cure
the Authour
from that Censure,

& the Work from
that Contempt,
which the Vulgar
Dress and mean
Language, they ap∣pear
in, is too apt
to Betray them to;
the Lustre of so
Great a Patronage
was even to Ne∣cessity
Convenient,

and will beyond
all Doubt be Suf∣ficient.
Your High∣ness
Name will be
Amulet against
the Censorious, &
Charm to the
Rude. Wherefore
that I have thus
for the Publick
sake presum'd to

Address a parti∣cular
Respect, will
(I hope) be Inter∣preted
a pardona∣ble
Ambition in
Him, who is
MADAME,
