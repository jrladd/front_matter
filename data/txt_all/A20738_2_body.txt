THe first translatour of this Author into Latin, did make his dedicatiō to two sūdry Princes: but we haue thoughte good to make your Ho∣nor the vvhole patron of our eng∣lish Appian, as vvholy as vve could set him forth.
In the former parte hee she∣wed to youre Honoure, the con∣questes that the Romaynes made, one of another. In this parte hee sheweth the conquestes that they made of other nations: vvherein they vvente so farre, that at laste they fell dovvne, beeyng ouerpreste vvith their ovvne vvayght. To these tvvo kindes of conquests, a thirde is to be added, vvhen a man conquereth himselfe, as Alexander did in conteyning from Darius most faire vvife and daugh∣ters, and Caesar, in sparing to punish his greatest enimies. To vvhom Cicero say de, that in other victories, fortune, policie, and souldiours, might claime a parte, but in this, he alone should haue al the glorie. And vvhen Darius died, and vvas holpen therto, by Polycrates, he sayd, for thy paines Alexander shal giue thee thanks, but the Gods immortal, shal giue A∣lexander

thankes, for his magnanimitie shevved to my mo∣ther, vvife and childrē. By such maner of conquest, your honour shall attaine to moste sure triumphe, the guide of vvhose Chariot, shal be Grace giuen from aboue, that shal neuer fayle you. Hovv vvorthy this author is to be read inStephanus in his Greeke ad∣dition to the Greeke Pre∣face. these matters, his testimonie may be ynough to proue, that vvisheth him to be read in the same, afore all other. Then may it please your Honour to accept him at the hands of your most humble seruaunt, that cōtinually prayeth for your increase of fame and honour, to the seruice of your Prince, and the glorie of God.
