RIGHT Honorable, the dutifull affection I beare to your manie vertues, is cause, that to manifest my loue to your Lordship, I am constrained to shew my simplenes to the world. Many are they that admire your worth, of the which number, I (though the meanest in abi∣litie▪ yet with the formost in affection) am one that most desire to serue, and onely to serue your Honour.
Small is the gift, but great is my good-will; the which, by how much the lesse I am able to expresse it, by so much the more it is infinite. Liue long▪ and inherit your Predecessors ver∣tues,

as you doe their dignitie and estate. This is my wish: the which your honorable excel∣lent giftes doe promise me to obtaine: and whereof these few rude and vnpollished lines, are a true (though an vndeseruing) testimony. If my ability were better, the signes should be greater; but being as it is, your honour must take me as I am, not as I should be. My yeares being so young, my perfection cannot be great: But howsoeuer it is, yours it is; and I my selfe am yours; in all humble seruice, most ready to be commaunded.
