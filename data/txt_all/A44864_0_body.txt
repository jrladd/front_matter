Dear Sister,
WHEN it pleased our Infinitely Wise and Holy God, to translate my most Reverend and Worthy Bro∣ther into those blessed Mansions of Glory, where he now dwells for ever; I was my self prevented by so sharp a Sickness, as that I could neither accompa∣ny that very numerous and extraordinary Train of Mourners, that follow'd him to his Grave; nor could I then be an Auditor of this excellent Discourse preach'd at his Funeral: my Sorrows were much augmented upon both these Considerations: For in that dark hour of Providence, when the Crown was taken from thy Head, and a deep wound was made in

my own Heart, it would have been some relief to me, to have seen multitudes both of Ministers and People, of different Perswasions about lit∣tle things, so unanimously united as they were in their Sorrows, for the loss of such an Emi∣nent Instrument of Gods Glory, and of so great an Example of practical Piety, conjoin'd with such prudent managent of his Labour, as that he had effectually obtain'd much of his great End, viz. Of establishing a profound Love to God, and to one another, in the Hearts of ve∣ry many of his Auditors; and had also diffused the same Spirit into all his Brethren, in that Corner where God had plac'd him; it would have been a further Comfort me, to have heard the Duty of Imitation so Pathetically urged, as it then was, in that Sermon which is now made publick.
The report of which was then sent me, but the Copy thereof came but lately into my Hands, with liberty of Printing it, and the restraint which the Reverend Author had first laid upon you, being in greatest part remo∣ved.

My Dear Sister,
Although I could have wished, that the

Impression had been more early, yet it now comes time enough (I hope) not only to be communicated to his whole Flock, but to add some new Fuel to their former great Zeal, whilst every one of them seemed very ardent∣ly bent to pay, a most just Veneration to his Memory; which in Truth will be now best done, if that they hold this Glass frequently before them, and while they are beholding so beautifull a Picture (drawn but in brief, yet truly representing him, and without all flatte∣ry) they shall every one endeavour to dress and adorn themselves according to so rare a pattern. Dear Sister, I am informed that the time is almost come, when you will discharge part of that Legacy of 100 l. which my Ex∣cellent Brother bequeathed to some Trustees named in his Will, for the purchasing of Lands, for the benefit of the Poor of that Bur∣rough of Stow-Market, and that for ever: Now Dear Sister, let me earnestly beseech you, that whenever you pay any part thereof, you would deposite it in such hands, as that a most sacred Promise may be given you and us, who are Overseers of his Will, that such Lands may be purchas'd and also settled, so as that

the annual Rent may be employed, as the yearly reward of a School-master, for his Teaching of the Children of the poorest sort, to read the English Bible, in such number as the Trustees shall think fit: This will be the erecting of a perpetual Monument to his me∣mory, more lasting than any of Marble, which his Parishioners have Thought and Discoursed of to set over his Grave. May the good Will of him that dwelt in the Bush, still for ever dwell in that Town; and may the Holy Spi∣rit of God, so influence all their Minds; that, that most precious Seed, which hath been sown in their Hearts, by our (now glorifi'd) Relation, may take deep root, and bring forth abundant Fruit, which will be, I am sure, the inexpressible Joy of thy Soul, and is the most earnest Prayer of

Dear SISTER,
