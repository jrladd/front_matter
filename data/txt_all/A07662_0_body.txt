BOund by desert, not meriting the same,
Words (still) to giue for deeds, doth make me shame.
Yet (Beautious) pardon, since the pouer Man
Giues, (thogh not what he should) yet what he can.
Thanks yeeld I you, (the pay of younger Brother)
Let Heyres be franke, and not their Riches smother.
What you request, I wish you would commaund,
For so my dutie to your Vertue's paund.
Vouchsafe this modest Booke, fraught full of wit,
A subiect chaste, a Ladie chaste doth fit.
Then, honored ANNE, grace HONORS ACADEMIE,
Since HONOR honoreth you, as much as anie.
Your Eglets high Conceit, too well doth know,
My Swallow MVSE, flies (for your pitch) too low.
This stuffe is SHEPHARDS GRAY, spunne course and plaine,
Vnlesse that you this worke, (to grace) shall daigne.
But as your outward shape is louely faire,
So inwardly, you'ar Curteous, Debonaire.
Your disposition milde, all faults will couer,
And (as vnseene) you gentlie them do smother.

My hope is then, that you will sweetly looke,
With your all-pleasing Eye, vpon this Booke.
Resolu'de whereon, your Votarie I rest,
Liue happie, since manie through you are blest.
The Phoenix faire, sprung from your Ashes sweete,
As you, so her, in dutious sort I greete.
