IS it true that the Spanyardes will com this spring? And is it not as true that we are ready to receiue them? Hath this land at any time had, either better prouision, or more Souldiers: brauer Captaines to leade them, or sounder Diuines to encourage them?

Yea, but what for Armour on our backes if feare bee in our hearts? can feare there remaine where our late victories are remēbered? Is not our enemie the same, our case, nay our God the same?
But Pharao, and Sisera, their o∣uerthrow is now forgotten. Mi∣riam may sing alone, and Barac and
Debora can get no hearers. O, ra∣ther let this booke call to mind our dutie, for why should we depriue, either our GOD of his glorie, or our selues of such a comfort? Is it not an houres Sermon of that inuincible Nauie, and a briefe Apologie of the Portugale voiage? and doth it not set before our eyes how great thinges the Lord hath done for vs? To this ende I haue published it, & to your Lordship, and worships, I doe Dedicate it. Beseeching God, so to blesse you in gouerning vs, that still the Gospell may haue free passage among vs. So shal we stil eate the fruite of our vines, in despite of Senacherib: and good
Ezechias shal not want Esaies to comfort her, whē
Rabsache shall be sent to rayle vpon her.
