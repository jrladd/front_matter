My Lord,
I Know your noble speculative soul doth use to converse with Au∣thors of all kinds in omni scibi∣li; And having found that som Things of mine have pass'd your approbation, (which is one of the greatest advantages they ever had, considering your sound and penetrating Judgment) I was induc'd to the boldnes of presen∣ting
 your Lordship with this New Peece, wherin ther are som things serious, and sutable to your con∣templation, though in short touches, and wown'd up on small bottomes, for the cogitation in a Letter is like a bird in a cage which hath not far to fly.
It comes seasonably to wish that the Yeer sixteen hundred fifty five (which begins but now, about the Vernall Equinoctiall, according to our Law) may be happy, and Healthfull to your Lordship, and to your Excellent Lady, as prayeth
My most highly Honor'd Lord,

Holborn, March the 12th.
