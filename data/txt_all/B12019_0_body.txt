MIne Honourable Lord; hauing Translated some fiue or sixe yeares agoe, the Historie of Don Quixote, out of the Spanish tongue into the English, in the space of forty daies: being ther∣vnto more then halfe enforced, through the importunitie of a very deere friend, that was desirous to vnderstand the subiect: After I had giuen him once a view there∣of, I cast it aside, where it lay long time neglected in a corner, and so little regarded by me as I neuer once set hand to reuiew or correct the same. Since when, at the intreatie of others my friends, I was content to let it come to light, conditionally, that some one or other, would peruse and amend the errours escaped;
 my many affaires hindering mee from vndergoing that labour. Now I vnderstand by the Printer, that the Copie was presented to your Honour: which did at the first somewhat disgust mee, because as it must passe, I feare much, it will proue farre vnworthy, ei∣ther of your Noble view or protection. Yet since it is mine, though abortiue, I doe humbly intreate, that your Honour will lend it a fauourable countenance, there by to animate the parent thereof to produce in time some worthier subiect, in your Honourable name, whose many rare vertues haue already rendred me so highly deuoted to your seruice, as I will some day giue very euident tokens of the same, and till then I rest,
