THe stately Eagle in his princely grace,
Permits the Flye to buzze before his face,
Yet will not mooue one feather of his wing,
His weake disturber vnder foote to bring,
Euen so I hope, this worke of willing mind
Such Gracious suffrance in your sight shall find.


The lowly shrub doth seldome blast, or sade,
Vnder the Caedars loftie verdant shade:
The Sunne giues life as well to simple weedes,
As vnto flowres, or profitable seedes:
So may these lines begot by true affection,
Spring to more height, grac't with your safe protection.
