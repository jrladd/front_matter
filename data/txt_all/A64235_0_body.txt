MY LORD,
HAD I been at liberty to have followed my own Inclinations, the ensuing Discourse had been thrown by, and lain neglected in my own Study on∣ly. But having received your Com∣mands for the Publishing as well as the Preaching of it, I here present it to your Lordship; being re∣solved there shall be no defects in my Obedience, how many soever there may be in my Sermon. But it's not the design of this Dedication to make Apologies, or which is another common place usually insisted on, write a Panegyric. They are generally Hypocrites that blow Trumpets before other Men, as well as
they that of old did it before themselves. If you take care that your Works shall praise you, and your own Conscience approve and commend you; this will afford you a solid Satisfaction, when the good Words of Men only will no more comfort, than the Breath wherewith they utter them, will nourish you. And that your Lordship and your Honourable Brethren, may manage your Selves and all your Af∣fairs in that Station wherein Providence hath set you, so as to secure this to your selves; prevent the Re∣proaches of Conscience, and live down those of mali∣cious Men; that this great City and Religion may flourish under your prudent and just Administrati∣on, is and shall be the Daily Prayer of
MY LORD,
