My Dear Brothers,
AMongst the very
many diversions
which I have ex∣perimented
to mitigate
and attemper the sor∣rowes
which do still
oppresse me, for the loss

of my Children, and
especially of that One,
so precious to me. I
have found nothing
that has afforded me a
greater consolation then
this: That it pleased
God to give me oppor∣tunities
and such a sub∣ject
to work upon, as I
cannot but hope he has
in mercy accepted. And
truly when I seriously
contemplate the felicity
of all those which are
Well out of this misera∣ble
world, I find the
griefe which wee con∣ceive
for their absence

to be a meer , and
does nothing at all con∣cerne
them whom we
mourne for, that have
served God, their Ge∣neration
with honour,
and left a memorial
without reproach. You
have, Brothers, both of
you lost Children, but
none of them for
whom you had reason
to be so sensible as my
selfe; because they di∣ed
Infants, and could
not so intirely engage
your affections, as if
they had arrived to yeers
of more maturity, and

the Spring had flattered
you with the expecta∣tion
of a fruitful harvest
as me it did.
But because we are
all obnoxious, and that
Cuivis potest accidere, quod
cuiquam potest, be assured,
That of al the afflictions
wch can touch the heart
in this life, one of the
most superlative is the
loss of a hopeful child;
and till I had the expe∣rience
of this my self, I
have often wondered
That David should suf∣fer
himselfe to be so far
transported for the death

of a Rebel, that had vi∣olated
all the Relations
which ought to be be∣twixt
a Son and a most
indulgent Father. I
know well that another
cause might contribute
to the effect, but all who
shall read that sad story,
cannot but impute as
much to his paternal af∣fections
as by man could
be expressed. These
are, Brothers, the con∣tingencies
(which since
we can never be exemp∣ted
perfectly of) have
caused me to seek the re∣medies
which I presume

here to have at last en∣countred,
and which I
here likewise affection∣ately
present unto you.
Let us make our Chil∣dren
fit for God, and
then let us not be dis∣pleased
whensoever he
takes them from us.
Deus nobis illos educandos
non mancipio dederat. There
are a multitude of other
precepts, that I might
recollect out of the con∣solatory
Writings which
are at hand, Plutarch and
Cicero, Seneca and others.
But all their Topicks (S.
Hierom and some few

Christians only except∣ed)
are most of them de∣rived
from Philosophy, the
pride and courage of
another Institution, and
afford us but uncertain
consolations in the wi∣ser
estimate of things.
So that hereby we may
be less troubled in wan∣ting
the writings of Dio∣genes,
Clitomachus, Carnea∣des,
Possidonius upon the
same Subject; there be∣ing
nothing capable
truly to compose the
mind of a good man for
the absence of his friend
or of his Child, like the

contemplation of his
undoubted felicity.
It is that which I there∣fore
endeavor here to se∣cure,
in offering to you
this Golden Book of S.
Chrysostom, which ha∣ving
afforded me soe
great a consolation, I
cannot but hope may
be likewise acceptable
to you, and useful to as
many as have either bin
touched with the like
resentiments, or that
do establish for an in∣fallible
Maxime that say∣ing
of Plato,De Legib. 

That those who are
well and rightly instru∣cted,
do easily become
good men. And the
thing is verily of so
great importance, That
some have taken Educa∣tion
for Religion it selfe;
All for another Nature;
which he that shal read
of the Laconick Disci∣pline,
will not easily
dispute. This is cer∣tain,
That were this one
thing well secured, Prin∣ces
would have good
Subjects, Fathers good
Children, Wives good
Husbands, Masters good

Servants, God would be
sincerely served, and all
things would be well
with us. And here I
would now end, did
not my Affections a lit∣tle
transport me, and the
hopes that you will yet
indulge it, if whilst I
erect to my dear Child no
other Monument, I shew
to the world how neer∣ly
I concurr'd with the
Instructions of this Gol∣den
Book (before I had
seene it) and what may
be expected from a
timely Education, if
(now that we may both

read and have it) we
with diligence pursue
it.
I cannot with S. Au∣gustine,Conf. lib. 9. cap. .
say of my son,
as he of his, Annorum e∣rat
ferè quindecim, & in∣genio
praeveniebat multos
graves, & doctos viros.
But this I can truly af∣firm,
He was little a∣bove
five years old, and
he did excel many that I
have known of fifteene.
Tam brevi spatio tempor a
multa compleverat. He was
taught to pray as soon as
he could speak, and he
was taught to read as

soon as he could pray.
At three years old he
read any Character or let∣ter
whatsoever used in
our printed Books, and
within a little time af∣ter
any tolerable Wri∣ting
hand, and had got∣ten
(by heart) before he
was five years of age se∣ven
or eight hundred
Latine and Greek words,
as I have since calculated
out of his , to∣gether
with their Gen∣ders
and Declensions. I
entred him then upon
the Verbs, which in four
months time he did

fectly conjugate, together
with most of the irregu∣lars
excepted in our
Grammar; These he con∣quered
with incredible
delight, and intelligence
of their use: But it is
more strange to consi∣der,
that when from
them I thought to set
him to the Nouns, he had
in that interim (by him∣self)
learned both the
Declensions and their Ex∣amples,
their exceptions,
Adjectives, Comparisons,
Pronouns, without any
knowledg or precept of
mine, insomuch as I

stood amazed at his se∣dulity
and memory.
This engaged me to
bring him a Sententiae Pu∣eriles
and a Cato, and of
late Comeniu▪ the short
Sentences of which two
first, and the more so∣lid
ones of the last, he
learned to Construe and
Perse, as fast as one could
well teach and attend
him: for he became
not onely dextrous in
the ordinary rules by
frequent recourse to
them (for indeed I ne∣ver
obliged him to get
any of them by heart as

a task, by that same car∣nificina
puerorum) upon
occasions, but did at
this age also easily com∣prehend
both the mean∣ing
and the use of the
Relative the Ellipsis and
Defects of Verbs and
Nouns unexpressedQuid in illo virtu∣tum, quid ingenii, quid pietatis invenerim▪ vereor di∣cere ne fi∣dem credu∣litatis x∣cedam. Hi∣er. ad Mar∣cell. Epi∣taph. But
to repeat here all that I
could justly affirm con∣cerning
his prompti∣tude
in this nature, were
altogether prodigious,
so that truly I have been
sometimes even con∣strained
to cry out with
the Father, as of another
Adeodatus, Horrori mihi est

hoc ingenium. For so in∣satiable
were his desires
of knowledg, that I well
remember upon a time
hearing one discourse of
Terence and Plautus, and
being told (upon his
enquiring concerning
those Authors) that the
Books were too difficult
for him, he wept for
very grief, and would
hardly be pacified: But
thus it is reported of
Thucydides, when those
noble Muses were recited
in his hearing, at one of
the most illustrious As∣semblies
of Greece, from

whence was predicted
the greatness of his Ge∣nius.
To tell you how
exactly he read French,
how much of it he
spake and understood,
were to let you onely
know, that his Mother
did instruct him with∣out
any confusion to
the rest. Thus he learn∣ed
a Catechism and ma∣ny
prayers, and read di∣vers
things in that Lan∣guage.
More to bee
admired was the liveli∣ness
of his judgement,
that being much affect∣ed
with the Diagramms

in Euclid, he did with
so great facility interpret
to me many of the com∣mon
Postulata, and De∣finitions,
which he would
readily repeat in Latine
and apply it. And he
was in one hour onely
taught to play, the first
half of a Thorough Basse,
to one of our Church
Psalmes upon the Organ
Let no man think that
we did hereby crowd
his spirit too full of no∣tions.
Those things
which we force upon o∣ther
children, were
strangely natural to him

for as he very seldome
affected their toyes; to
such things were his u∣sual
Recreations, as the
gravest man might not
be ashamed to divert
himself withal. These
were especially the Apo∣logus
of Aesop; most of
which he could so rea∣dily
recount, with di∣vers
other Stories, as you
would admire from
whence he produced
them: But he was ne∣ver
without some Book
or other in his hand.
Pictures did afford him
infinite pleasure, above

all a Pen and Ink with
which he now began to
forme his Letters▪ Thus
he often delighted him∣self
in reciting of Poems
and Sentences, some
whereof he had in
Greek, Fragments of
Comedies, diuers Verses
out of Herbert, and a∣mongst
the Psalmes, his
Beloved, and often re∣peated,
Ecce quam Bonum:
and indeed he had an
ear so curiously framed
to sounds, that he would
never misse infallibly
to have told you what
Language it was you did

read by the Accent only,
were it Latine, Greek,
French, Italian or Dutch.
To all I might add, the
incomparable sweetness
of his countenance and
eyes, the clean fabrick
of his body and pretty
Adresses: how easily he
forgot injuries, when
at any time I would
break and crosse his pas∣sions,
by sometimes in∣terrupting
his enjoy∣ments,
in the midst
of some sweet or other
delicious things which
allured him; that I
might there render

him the more indiffer∣ent
to all things▪
though these he seldom
quitted without re∣wards
and advantage.
But above all, extreme∣ly
conspicuous was his
affection to his younger
Brother, with whose im∣pertinencies
he would
continually bear, saying
he was but a child, and
understood no better.
For he was ever so smi∣ling,
cheerful and in∣perfect
good humour,
that it might be truly
verified of him, as it
was once of Heliodorus,Hirom

Gravitatem morum, hilari∣tate,
frontis temperabat.
But these things were
obvious, and I dwel no
longer on them: There
are yet better behind;
and those are his early
Piety, and how ripe he
was for God. Never
did this Child lye in bed
(by his good will) lon∣ger
then six or seven
Winter or Summer;
and the first thing he
did (being up) was to
say his French Prayers,
and our Church-Catechism;
after Breakfast that short
Latine Prayer, which

having encountred at
the beginning of our
Lillies Grammar, he had
learned by heart, with∣out
any knowledge or
injunction of mine, and
whatsoever he so com∣mitted
to memory, he
would never desist till
heperfectly understood;
yet withall this, did he
no day employ above
two houres at his Book
by my order; what he
else learned was most
by himselfe, without
constraint or the least
severity, unseene, and
totally imported by his

own inclination. But
to return, Wonderful
was it to observe the
Chapters which him∣selfe
would choose, and
the Psalmes and Verses
that he would apply up∣on
occasions, and as in
particular he did to some
that were sick in my
family a little before
him; bidding them to
consider the Sufferings
of Christ, how bitter
they were, and how
willingly he endured
them. How frequent∣ly
would he pray by
himself in the day time,

and procure others to
joyn with him in some
private corner of the
house apart? The last
time he was at Church
(which was, as I re∣member
at Greenwich)
at his return I asked him
what he brought away
from the Sermon; He
replyed, That he had
remembred two good
things, Bonum Gratiae,
and Bonum Gloriae, which
expressions were indeed
used, though I did not
believe he had minded
them.
I should even tire

you with repeating all
that I might call to
mind of his pertinent
answers upon several
occasions: One of the
last whereof I will only
instance, when about
Christmas a Kinsman of
his related to us by the
fire side some passages
of the presumptuous fa∣sting
of certain Enthusi∣asts
about Colchester,
whilst we were expres∣sing
some admiration at
the passage, That, sayes
the Child (being upon
the Gentlemans knee,
and as we thought not

minding the discourse)
is no such wonder, for
it is written, Man shall
not live by bread alone,
&c. But more to be
admired was his perfect
comprehension of the
sacred Histories in the
Method of our Golden
Authr so as it may be
truly affirmed of this
Child, as it was once
said of Timothy,2 Tim. 3. 15. Quod à
puero Sacras liter as noverat
Nor was all this by rote
onely (as they term it)
for that he was capable
of the greater mystery of
our salvation by Christ,

I have had many infalli∣ble
indications. And
when the Lords day
fortnight before he died
he repeated to me our
Church-Catechism, he told
me that he now per∣ceived
his God-fathers
were dis engaged; for
that since he himself did
now understand what
his Duty was, it would
be required of him, and
not of them for the fu∣ture.
And let no man
think, that when I use
the term Dis-ingaged, it
is to expresse the Child
meaning with a fine

word; for he did not
only make use of such
phrases himself; but
would frequently in his
ordinary discourse come
out with such expresions
as one would have ad∣mired
how he came by
them; but upon en∣quiry,
he would cer∣tainly
have produced
his authority, and ei∣ther
in the Bible, or
some other Booke
shewed you the words
so used. How divine∣ly
did this pious Infant
speake of his being
weary of this trouble∣some

world (into
which he was scarcely
entred) and whilest he
lay sick, of his desires to
goe to Heaven; that the
Angels might convey
him into Abrahams bo∣some,
passionately per∣swading
those that
tended him to dye with
him; for he told them
that he knew he should
not live: And, really,
though it were an Ague
which carried him from
us (a disease which I
least apprehended find∣ing
him so lively in his
Intervals;) yet the day

before he tooke his
leave of us, he call'd to
me, and pronounced
it very soberly; Father
(sayes he) you have
often told me that you
would give me your
house, and your Land,
your Bookes and all
your fine things; but I
tell you, I shall have
none of them, you wil
leave them all to my
Brother. This he spake
without any provoca∣tion
or passion, and it
did somewhat trouble
me, that I could not
make him alter this

conceit which in Ano∣ther
would be esteemed
prophetick. But that I
may conclude and shew
how truely jealous this
child was. Least he
should offend God in
the least scruple, that
very morning, not
many howers before he
fell into that sleepe
which was his last, be∣ing
in the midst of his
Paroxcisme, he called
to me, and asked of
me whether he should
not offend, if in the
extremity of his pain,
he mentioned so often

the name of God, cal∣ing
for ease; and whe∣ther
God would accept
his prayers if he did not
hold his hands out of
bed in the posture of
praying? Which when
I had pacified him a∣bout,
he prayed, till
his prayers were turned
into eternal praises.
Thus ended your Ne∣phew,
being but five
years, five monethes
and three dayes old, and
more I could stil say. Nam
quem Corpore non valemus
recordatione teneamus, et
cum quo loqui non 

de eo loqui nunquam desi∣namus.
But my tears
mingle so fast with my
Inke that I am forced to
breake off here, and
be silent—I end there∣fore
with that blessed
Saint, Munera tua tibi
confiteor Domine Deus
meus, Creator omnium,
multum potens reformare
nostra deformia: Nam ego
in illo puero, praeter de∣lictum

Munera tua tibi con∣fiteor

Brothers, indulge me
these excesses: It is not
a new thing which I
doe, St. Hierom wrote
divers Epistles which he
inscribed his Epitaphs;
and never was a Paula
or Estochium dearer to
him, then this your Ne∣phew
was to
