Most Hypocritical Beldam!
SƲRE nothing but the Vilest Complication of all man∣ner of Devilism, could have Acted a Judas's part with so much subtilty, for the Lucre of a few base Pence, as your abominable self, thou Hodg Podge of all Wickedness; in deluding a poor Innocent Creature, by the bewitching Sorcery of your Insinuating Tongue, to satisfie the Lust of an Ingrateful Sinner, to her whole Life's Misery.
I am Pleas'd with nothing in this World, but to hear the Venereal Remains of your Juvenal Debauches, have sent you Packing to the Bath, to there Parboile your filthy Carcase, with a Vain hope of Repairing your Rotten Limbs, which I believe the best Preserver of Humane Bodies, is unable to keep Alive from Stinking. Some Cripples I have heard, have been so perfectly restor'd to their Healthful Abilites by the Bath, as to leave their Crutches behind'em: But I question not, if there be any Justice in Hot Water towards thee, the most In∣famous of Sinners: If you leave any thing behind you, 'twill be your Nose, or your Shinbones, in order to Punish you, for those Ills which you have not been Contented to Practice your self, but to draw Innocence into.
The Sufferings and Sorrows I now Labour under, are all

owing to your Confounded Ladyship, and your Extasies of Joy with a Pox to 'em, (for so I've found 'em) have struck up such an unextinguishable Fire in my most Pleasurable Apartment, that I fear its past the Power of Tunbridge Waters, Aqua-Tetrachimagogon, or the Pick-a-dilly Engineer, to stop the Flames from consuming the whole miserable Tenement.
My Sinful Life, which was at first owing to your self, has brought me Early under Affliction; and that Affliction, I thank Providence, to an Early Repentance: But if I cannot become a sincere Penitent, without forgiving you, my Ʋnpardonable Enemy, who first seduc'd me into a State of Corruption, I shall certainly hazard my Salvation, upon a breach of that part of Christianity; and Dye with as much Malice towards thee, the betrayer of my Innocence, as ever did poor Jacobite Plotter bear to a Confederate, who first drew him into the De∣sign, and afterwards, to save his own Life, hang'd him upon his Evidence.
Ʋnder a Serious Reflection, on my miserable Condition at Tunbridge: I writ the following Poem, which I have De∣dicated to your Sinful self, to Remind you of your past Wick∣edness; and to Caution Young Ignorant Creatures, how they are Deluded by such Insinuating Beldams, such Kidnappers of Virginity, into the like Ʋnhappiness: So Wishing you may Dye in a Ditch, and Rot like a Dead Horse, that the Boys may make Catsticks of your Legg Bones, and Raisers of your Ribs, to Play at Trap Ball with, in the Bartholomew Holy∣days, I Remain a Miserable Wretch, and your Bitter Enemy till Death.
