Huyng wythout anye my de∣sert enioyed the cōmoditie of your beneuolence and good wyll, I haue often deuised, & ben desirous accomplyshe some thyng whych I myght exhibit vnto you, as a testimonie and pledge of my pore ear∣nest zeale & entier affection. And know¦yng by late profe, that if my power wer to declare ye same by some gyft of price, ye wold not wel take it: beyng so syn∣cere and vpryght, rather to esteme the good wyll, then the value. The con∣sideracion of the whyche thyng hathe moued me at thys my presente beynge here, to take in hande thys small and simple treatyse, presenting it vnto you for a newe yeres gyfte, that it myghte openly appeare how inwardly I beare you (accordyng to my bounden duety) my pore hert and seruyse. And albeit that lacke of tyme, and lette of busines

as it is well knowen, hath withdraw∣en from me leasure requisite to the ab∣solute finyshynge here of. Yet I truste wel in your wonted gentlenes that you wyll both in good part take my simple labour here imployed (vntyll some wor thyer thyng may happen,) and also for lacke of power accepte my poore good wyll, hertely wyshyng that suche pro∣fite may procede vnto you by thys processe, as you maye euermore enioye a healthful mynde in a whole and sounde body, beyng worthy for your excellene desertes longe continu∣aunce of the same.
At London the fyrste of January. An 1551.
