SIR,
I Send you here, an Answer to that Paper I re∣ceived from you; containing a col∣lection of cer∣taine Reasons, conveyed into the hands of some devout Gentlewo∣men your friends, with purpose to divert them from society with Pro∣testants,

and specially in Gods ser∣vice established among us. Vp∣on the first view of them, I mar∣velled at the Authors strange drawing and misapplying Scri∣ptures to his purpose, & at the opi∣nions which he imputed to ancient Hereticks, whereof, to my re∣membrance, I had never read nor heard before. But when I came to examine the places more particu∣larly in his owne Authors, I found cause even to be astonished at the boldnesse of the man, that taking advantage of the credulity of such good people, durst put such a pac∣ket of lies into their hands: And I could not but pitty their case, who being fallen into the net of errour,

are by such a cunning, but ungod∣ly practise, in danger to be inwrap∣ed and snarled by this perswasion of separation, so as, if Gods mercy be not the more, there is no meanes for them to come ever even to un∣derstand this falshood, wherby their simplicity is abused. There is not a more approoved remedie against the stinging of a Scorpion, then the Scorpion it selfe bruised in oyle, and applyed. I have here endea∣voured to bray this Scorpion; it shall be your part to apply it. And if this Collector can and will justifie under his name his Do∣ctrine of Separation, and his Catalogue of Heresies, and his Charge of Protestants to

renew them, he shall proove himselfe an honest man: if he cannot, and will yeeld to the truth, at least a good Christian. If he doe not one of the two, request your friends (as our old Proverbe hath it) to let him con∣tinue in their Pater noster, but cast him, & his additions to the Catholick faith, for ever out of their Creed. Concluding, I de∣sire God to give you and them a right understanding in all things, and to follow the truth in Charity; and rest
