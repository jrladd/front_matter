RIght reuerend, and right ho∣nourable, it is now a twelue-month past sithence I presen∣ted to your Grace a compa∣ratiue discourse of the lawes: A subiect deseruing the in∣dustrious search of some di∣uing braine, by mee superficially handled, and as it were left to others to be complementally perfected: but sithence by good successe and the fauour of the Almightie it hath gained the approbation of men skilfull and learned, who haue perswaded and en∣couraged mee to make further progresse in this bu∣sinesse, least I might seeme coy in weighing lightly
 their frendly speeches, & careles in refusing so im∣portant a taske, though to me importable, as being the club of Hercules laid vpon the sholders of Hy∣las, I haue again aduentured vpon this cumbersome prouince, and drawne other furrowes in this stony soile: and as I haue continued the worke, so haue I continued the dedication thereof in all constant ob∣seruance to your Lordship, whose regardfull coun∣tenance toward me hath merited more at my hands then such worthlesse paines, rather by the trauaile of my pen, and the practicke of my contemplation, to publish and notifie to the worlde my dutifull thankfull and zealefull affection toward your gra∣ces person, then by the vnfeatured lumpe and dis∣proportioned bearewhelpe of my misconceyuing, & miscarying endeuour, to platforme a consummate and exemplarie Parallele or Trinomion, which is an obiect to be aymed at, and a pray to be pursued; not of the Stonegall, the Muskette, and the Merlin, but of the Eagle, the Goshauke, and other birdes of an higher wing, and more surmounting flight: and for the accomplishment thereof it were to be wished, that God would vouchsafe our Innes of Court with some second Budaeus, that is a third Varro, whose skill in the lawes might bee exquisite, whose paines extreme, whose reward excellent: for mine owne parte though I bee rather a rash then a voluntarie soldier in this campe, yet I am bound by conscience not to eate the bread of idlenes, to do for my country what I can, and to labour in my calling as I may.
 And whatsoeuer this Booke is, or whatsoeuer my selfe am, or whatsoeuer my prayer may preuaile with Almightie God, all these, if these be anie thing, doe with the knee of submissiue reuerence professe vassallage to your Lordship. And if the Heauens would sympathize with my hart, and my hart should not by pleasing my selfe, and others, displease your Grace, the verie Heauens should be long without you, that this land may be long the better for your Lordship. The God of heauen graunt this, if it be his will, for Learninges sake, Quae duplices tendens ad sydera palmas, prayeth for the same: Vertue prayeth for the same: Straun∣gers pray for the same: Beneficence to the riche: Munificence to the poore, craue the same: The Church with sacred vowes: The Common weale with more then common wishes implore the same. What period can be better then prayer? Therefore here I cast anchor, and bind vp these spreading lines.
