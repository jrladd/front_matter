MAY IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE,
BEing perswaded to print the following Papers, in hopes to convince or silence opposers, and to confirm friends, in a mat∣ter of the highest importance to the whole Nation: I have presumed to Dedicate them to Your Grace, not only because his Ma∣jestie hath deservedly placed You in this Kingdom at the head of affairs of State; but also because Your Grace's inclinati∣ons
 for your Countries service are so vi∣sible; and because you so readily vouch∣safed me a favourable Audience in this Business, when humbly desired, all which, as a good Omen, gives me a modest con∣fidence of a patient Hearing, and a happy Issue in Parliament. And I am almost certain, no good Reasons can oppose its Success, tho' some malevolent Affections, or privat Interest not rightly informed may make a noise, till the wise determi∣nation of Parliament shall quiet them. I hope, it will be no diminution to Your Grace's Grandure to be principally in∣strumental in the Settlement, of what only can with speed make this Nation Flourish, and for that alone it is, humb∣ly beg Your Grace's favourable Protecti∣on, as well as Pardon for this my Presump∣tion, who am with all duty and deference,
