Curteous Reader,
THE Ensuing Testimonies are ten∣derly recommended to thy seri∣ous Perusual, with an earnest desire thou may'st Read them in Meekness, and the Fear of God; and if a Parent, wait upon the Lord in his Ho∣ly and Heavenly Gift, to receive that Wisdom which is truly profitable to di∣rect thee, and to endue with a right Understanding, and a godly Care and Zeal to Train up thy Child in the Fear of God, and Admonition of the Lord; and not only to Admonish thy Child to that which is Good, and not to follow or delight in the foolish Fashions and vain Dresses of the evil World, but also while under thy care to Feed, Cloth and Provide for, to restrain from those things which are unbecoming the Truth and our holy Profession thereof, and not to lay out and exspend thy Substance which God hath made thee a Steward of, to gratifie that mind in thy Child, which thou hast known and felt the Judgment of
 the Lord to be executed upon in thy self, because it was not subject unto the Law of God, neither indeed can be; and therefore ought not to be given way unto in thy Child, nor comply'd with by thee, least thou become guilty of thy Childs hurt, to the dishonour of Truth, and thy own Grief; but rather then thus humour thy Child, let the like care be on thee, as was upon our Deceased Friend, who on his dying-Bed, Desired that his Child should be brought up in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord, and Educa∣ted in the Plain and Decent parts or things that belong to a Woman, But upon a need∣less Seam, nor any thing Superfluous, not to lift her Hand to do, for that, said he, will bring Dishonour to the blessed Truth, and be a Burden to the Simple-hearted: Observe the Godly Care of this good Man: Oh, that many Parents may be fil∣led with the like Godly Care and zeal for the Education of their tender Off-spring.
And now, oh, Curteous Reader, if thou art young, and not yet become the Parent of Children, Read in Serious∣ness, and the Fear of God, the following Testimony concerning these young Mai∣dens,
 who may be truly esteemed as wise Virgins, and such that had more regard to the inward then the outward Adorn∣ing, whereby they became so Comly, and their Conversation so Commendable and Examplary, that Sarah Featherstone, its said, was not one that had only a Love to faithful Friends, and their Reli∣gious Meetings, but also when there, was preserved out of Drowsiness, Sleepiness and Heaviness, (which over took the fool∣ish Virgins, so that their Lamps went out, and they were unfit to enter with the Bride-Groom) but she sat in Meetings in a sweet frame of Spirit, and was often tendred in the Meetings, a thing very commend∣able in Young and Old: She also when she was sent abroad to be Educated, was careful to improve her Time, a thing worthy of Praise and of thy Observa∣tion; for with Grief may it be said, there are too many Children, that when their Parents send them abroad to be Educa∣ted, and are at great Charge and Ex∣pence by reason thereof, they too to much neglect that which their Parents send them forth to Learn, and in Play, Wildness and Idleness squander away
 their pretious Time, often talking what Portions they have, or their Parents can give them, and observing what this and the other wears, and how this and the other Dresses themselves, and then endea∣vour to do the like, and thus stir up one another to that which is Evil; and some∣times by giving way to this Evil mind, come to have a proud Look, which is an Abomination to the Lord, and a Lying Tongue, which he hates. Oh, therefore who-ever thou art, which Reads these and the following Lines, consider seriously these things, and remember thou must Dye and come to Judgment; and though thou art Young, yet knowest not how soon thy change may come, and thy Body must return to the Dust, and become Meat for the Worms: Therefore while time lasts improve it, and mind the Grace and good Spirit of God in thy own Heart, hearken and return at the Reproofs of it, that thou may'st know and be led in the way of Life, and become a Comfort to thy Parents, and a Companion of them that fear the Lord, and rejoycing to thy Friends, who have no greater Joy then to behold their Children walking in the
 Truth, the which Truth and Spirit of it, if thou wilt love and obey, it will lead thee to make a right improvement of thy time, to be Obedient to thy Parents, and Subject to thy Tutors, to be meek and lowly in thy mind, and to be affraid to commit that which is Evil, though in a secret Corner, or to wear that which is needless or superfluous; for this Truth is that which will teach thee all things, if thou wilt learn of it, thou wilt become more Excellent then thy Neighbours, and wilt not be seduced by the way of the Wicked, nor let thy mind out after their vain and foolish Fashions, nor delight in their evil Practices and proud Dresses, and false Speech, and corrupt Communication, but in the single Language, the plain and decent Dresses and Apparel that the godly of Old were, and now are Adorned in.
