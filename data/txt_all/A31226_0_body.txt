SIR,
I Lay at your Majesties
feet these my Memoir's:
and if your time may permit
that you will read them, they
are contracted in so little a
Volume the more to invite you
to it.
I am persuaded that your
Majesty will find amongst
them, some thing new, though

many years past. The Stile
is plain and simple; otherâˆ£wise
it could not be mine. But
the Truth may make amends.
For I pass them on my Word
not to contain a Lie, or
mistake, to my Knowledge.
