WE the most Dutiful and Loyal Subscribers of this Address, (out of a deep sense of our late miserable Estate and Condi∣tion) do hereby return our due Acknowledgments to Almighty God, and to Your Sacred Majesty, and, under you, to the indefatigable Care of Major-General Kirk, for our unexpected Relief by Sea, in spight of all the opposition of our industrious, but bloody and implacable Ene∣mies; which Relief was no less wonderfully, than seasonably, convey∣ed to us, and that, at the very nick of time, when we (who survived many thousands that died here of Famine during the Siege) were just ready to be cut off, and perish, by the hands of barbarous, cruel, and inhuman Wretches; who no sooner saw us delivered, and that they could not compass their Wicked Designs against this Your Majesties City, and our Lives, (for which they thirsted) immediately set all the Country round us on fire, after having plundered, robbed, and strip∣ped all the Protestants therein, as well those Persons they themselves granted Protections to, as others: We do therefore most sincerely re∣joice with all our Souls, and bless God for all his Singular and Repeat∣ed Mercies and Deliverances; and do for ever Adore the Divine Providence for Your Majesties rightful and peaceable accession to the Imperial Crown of these Kingdoms (the proclaiming of which was justly celebrated in these Parts with Vniversal Joy;) and we do with all humble Submission present to Your Sacred Majesty our unfeigned Loyalty, the most valuable Tribute we can give, or Your Majesty re∣ceive from us. And since the same Providence has (through much dif∣ficulty)

made us so happy as to be Your Subjects, we come in the like humility to lay our selves intirely at Your Royal Feet, and do most heartily and resolvedly offer and engage our Lives and Fortunes to Your Service. And further, we do most unanimously join in a firm and unchangeable Vow and Resolution of improving all occasions of becoming Serviceable to Your Majesty, in what Station soever it shall please God and your Majesty to place us; and will expose our selves to all Hazards and Extremities to serve Your Majesty against the Common Enemy. From all which Promises, Vows and Services, we and every of us promise (without any Exception or Reserve) not to recede unto our Lives end. In testimony of all which, we have here∣unto subscribed our Names at Londonderry this 29th day of July, Anno Dom. 1689.
