WHen on that plot of ground I you beheld,
(Braue brood of Mars) where Mars of yore did lead
The a Romane troopes, me thought,For this see the 10. & 13. pag. ye stood in field
As souldiers from their ashes newly bred,


That thought to sing your prayse inspir'd my Muse
And first gaue life to this heroique song,
Which ye that vnderstand can not abuse;
Braue minded Mars the Muses will not wrong:


PhillipsAlexander the great. great sonne, great souldier of his time,
Who wepte, because poore Homer did not liue
To sing his life, toCherillus. one, that could but rime
Yet good regard for each good verse did giue:


Thinke what he did and what that Monarch was,
So shall my verse not vnregarded passe.
