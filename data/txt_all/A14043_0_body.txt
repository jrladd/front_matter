GENTLEMEN, here is that presented to your eyes, which not long since sounded in your eares; that common Apologie for being men in print, (the importunity of friends) cannot be altogether mine, for some whom this may most concerne, will least desire it; but when I remember that ancient saying of Lucian,Encomien pe∣triae. , that the smoake of a mans owne country is better than the fire of another; I doubt not but that these my tender labours (which are but smoaky vapours of ignorance, compared to the enlightning fire of others knowledge, such as daily you heare) shall finde an easier passage into your acceptance, because here I had my first being where you all have your happy dwelling.
