I Read in the Holy Writ, that when St. Paul had refreshed himself at the House of Onesiphorus, he expressed his Thankfulness to him in this Prayer, The Lord have Mercy on the House of

Onesiphorus: and not being content with that single Prayer, he publishes another in his Behalf, God grant that he may find Mercy at the last Day. He re∣membred him in his Prayers, and pub∣lickly acknowledged his Hospitality in most of his Epistles. In the like manner, I that have often refreshed my self at your Table, and have there been an Eye∣witness of your Hospitality to others, what can I do less for your free and ge∣nerous Entertainments, than become your Orator to God by my Prayers; your He∣rald to the World, by dedicating this Sermon of Hospitality to you, to shew to the World I am none of those ungrateful Wretches that can receive a Kindness, and immediately forget it.
