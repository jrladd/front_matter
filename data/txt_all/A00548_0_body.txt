Sir,
ALL Seamen in their cour∣ses must ne∣ssarily saile by

their Cards; But in this Art and Sea of the Court, and Honest Man, there prescribed; I neuer so much as dreamt to present them as binding rules, to your truly liberall and knowing Ʋirtues; Your owne honor'd bosome being died in graine of that gene∣rous honesty that

goodnesse; whose contraries made a shame with your eet disposition; may be hoped in time to  dishabited and andoned. And ten will the Court uance virtue by ample; and her uthority inflict pu∣shment only vpon ce; no good seeing done by power; but

what by hearty and knowing will, is first naturally suggested and taught. A Cour so humane, would make a whole king∣dome such a Court▪ agreeing like a Cen∣ter, and his Cir∣cle. Ambitious lines drawn there by grea men, would bee as righteous as round and all earthly hap∣pinesse

accounted to consist in quiet; euen the quiet of free and equally plente∣s peace. Till which come, like the Rain∣ow, bee all your Court-actions still ee as the Sun, and em quiet with their rcularly swift free∣es. Cōmanding euer
