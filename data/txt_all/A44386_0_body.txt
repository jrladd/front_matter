Gentlemen!
I Have lately published som Helps towards Grounding little ones in the Latine-tongue: and finding them (by my own and other's Practice) to becom succesful; I more willingly go on to prose∣cute my begun design; viz. to contrive (at vacant times) such necessarie Subsidiaries for everie Classis in a Grammar-School, as may much facilitate The good (though with som tedious) old waie of Teaching by Grammar, Autors, and Exercises.

And becaus our greatest cumber hither∣to hath been Grammar, I have first begun with it, and endevored to bring the Rules of that Art to the reach of Children's ap∣prehensions; that in daily reading, writing, and speaking Latine, they may clearly see, and at once understand the Reason of what they do.
What I have don herein I most humbly submit to your candid judgments, and if, in your Opinions, I but seem to effect anie thing, which may make our School-labor less troublesom, I have what I desire; and therefore rest,

From my School in Gold-smith's Alley, March, 26. 1651.
