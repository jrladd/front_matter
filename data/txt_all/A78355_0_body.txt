My Lord,
THE great Blessing of Peace being the Improve∣ment of Arts, and that of War, so long as this Mass of Earth continues in its Fabrick of Creation, beyond all Dispute most useful; To cultivate this Art in time of Peace, is no less the Interest of Mankind, than it is in Summer to pro∣vide Food and Raiment for the Winter; Peace and War suc∣ceeding
 each other by short Intervalls, so naturally, and al∣most with the Motion of the Sun in the Zodiack.
The Practice then of this Art, since first Man begun to loose the Reins of his Choller, (continued through a long Tract of Ages to this hour) having rendered it no less honourable than its first Institution was necessar, it cannot but be agree∣able to the Genius of Mankind, to prosecute an Art Neces∣sary, Ʋseful, and Honourable.
Nor is the use of Arms (even the length of an Imagi∣nary War) to be intermitted in the highest Crisis of the most serene Peace, unless the one half of the World resolve to become slaves to the other; Liberty being scituate like the Brain, which though it rest secure in the immediate embra∣ces of a Pa Mater, yet if not guarded by the triple Contra∣vallation of a dura Mater, Scull and Pericranium, the first being a very tender Membrane, were not able of it self to protect it from Injury: So Peace, if not fortified by a continual Guard and a constant Exercise of Arms, is not able of it self to preserve it self, nor maintain the Liberty of the great Monarchies or smallest Estates and Republicks; as the jealous Practice of Luca, Geneve, Ragouse, and ma∣ny other States do fully evidence; nor do I think that Nation worthy of Peace, who neglects the use of Arms, when they have attain'd it.
Besides, my Lord, if I were Ʋmpyre in the Quarrel be∣twixt those two famous Rivals of the World, Peace and War; I could almost declare the First more injurious to the Latter, than the Latter to it; War both procuring and preserving Peace: But Peace (somewhat ungrate) in a few years oft∣times destroying its Rival, rendering the Spirits of Men by soft ease, and its consequences, so unapt for War, as by this subtile insinuation of Peace, like that of the Serpent in Para∣dise, Nations have on a sudden forfeit their Liberty, Ho∣nour and Peace it self. This Consideration made the Poet justly exclaim of the state of the Roman Empire in his time,

Nunc patimur longae Pacis mala, saevior armis
Luxuria incubuit, victumque ulciscitur Orbem.
The repose of a few moneths in Capua made soon an Ar∣my that had jumpt over the Pyrences and Alps, as though they had been Mole hills, sweep'd with their very breath their way to Cannae, and from thence cut out a passage to Rome; and became so terrible, as Fame it self could hardly represent the Valour of it in her magnifying Glass: This same formidable and well disciplin'd Army, a few moneths ease made no less contemptible and ridiculous than a Company of drunken Boors at a Low-Dutch Fair. Whereas the Practice and Ʋse of warlike Exercises in time of Peace, pre∣serves and maintains it firmly; no Nation being more se∣cure, than that which is perfect in the Art of War.
The Conquest of the soft and peaceable Eastern Nations, was but the business of an ordinary Compagne or two, to the meanest of the Roman Generals; those effeminate Gallants hugging so their Delilah of Peace, as they permitted her to cutt their Hair, and deprive them of both Strength and Cou∣rage: But, to disturb the peace of the Western or Northern Nations accustomed to War, was a Province only for a Cae∣sar, a Germanicus, an Agricola, or the like, Nec facile vincuntur vincere, (non vinci) assueti.
Pray, what did all the Romans huffings upon the Rhine for some hundred years produce? when they thought forsooth they had secured that vast Continent betwixt the Alps and the German-Ocean, what says their Noble and Ingenuous Historian? why after he has reckoned up a great many Con∣suls, Generals, Emperors, affronted, disgraced, and defeat in subduing those stubborn Warriours, many Legions cut off, much Time and Treasure spent, Germani (sayes he) magis triumphati quam victi sunt; they were forc'd for honours cause, to rest contented with an imaginary Conquest of that warlike Nation; a virtue so transmitted to their posterity, that how dear the Germans yet esteem their Liberty, may appear by our weekly Gazetts. Nay this very day we know,
 that the Turk having found the Business with the Sterne and Martial Pole too hot, has now tack'd about, and is forced to turn his conquering Arms against the more peaceable and soft Russian, whom if not assisted by the other Europaeans, he may bring in some Distress.
To relate how much our Nation, (however traduced by our un∣kind scribling Neighbours) has maintain'd its Liberty against a Assailants, and though sometimes over-run by powerful Armies, yet never losing Courage, or embracing the title of Conquered (as those who brag more of their valour have done) but still rallying and recovering their ground, not to be conquered by Arms, but a glorious Succession only; were, my Lord, to make an Historie of an intended Epistle Dedi∣catory, and therefore rather to be pointed at, than tyranni∣callie to impose the Patience upon your Lordship of an ample Rehearsal: which should I in this place attempt, the same might be said of this Piece, as the Stoick said of the city Mindas, the Ports were so big, and the Town so little, he was afraid it might escape out at the Ports.
Ʋpon these grounds then, my Lord, having endeavoured to prove that the exercise of War is the only Bullwark of Peace; I do now subsume, at least presume, that amongst all the methods of War known in Historie, that of Archery, being since the memory of Man universally practised (though now by the use of fire-arms almost only reserv'd for sport) is the most noble and useful, and by consequence the most necessarie to be cultivate, whilst now we are blessed with Peace, that we may be in readiness for War; the Bow having been, before the invention of Guns, the only recei∣ved weapon, and if well used, I am confident of equal force in Battel, though not of so much noise, as the Musquet, now only in use amongst those, whose Predecessors excelled in Archery, and the use of Bow.
Since then, my Lord, your Lordship has thought it worth your paines to revive in this Nation, the almost extinguished Art of Archery, and by your own Example (worthie of one de∣scended of so Noble and Ancient a Line of Ancestors, Fa∣mous
 both in Peace and War) to encourage all the Nobility, Gen∣try, and Commons of this Kingdom, to resume the Exercise of an Art so much hitherto neglected. As the whole Nation with one voice do owne the Obligation to your Lordships ge∣nerous Endeavours, hoping that from your Lordships Original, many thousand Copies may be quickly dispersed, and trans∣mitted to Posterity. So I having the honour to be of that worthy Society, of which your Lordship is pleased to recieve the Title of Captain; and not in good capacity to attend your Lordship in the Complement of Parade (being yet but a bad Proficient in the Art) am ambitious by another Art (in which I pretend to some smattering Knowledge) to demonstrate in the ensuing Poëtical Essay, how much in the general Concurrence of the Nation, a particular Person may express himself,
My Lord,
