TO you those No∣blest of Gentlemen of these Renow∣ned Kingdomes of Great Britaine: who in these declining times, haue yet in your braue bosomes the sparkes of that sprightly fire, of your couragious Ancestors; and to this houre retaine the seedes of their magnanimitie and Great∣nesse, who out of the vertue of your mindes, loue and cherish neglected Poesie, the delight of

Blessed soules, And the language of Angels. To you are these my Poems dedicated.
