HOnourable Ladie, hauing nothing of vvorth to present your Ladishippe, I haue presumde to offer to the Schryne of your gratious clemencie the humble sacrifice of my deuote sinceritie: vvhereby I haue bevvrayed rather a vvill to obey, then any skill to deserue your Ladiships protection. For (vvell I vvotte) these fevv disordered lynes are too vveake a prop to beare the burthene of your al-fleing fame. Yet calling to mynde your Ladiships vvorthie dis∣position, I am persvvaded my attempts vvill rather be buryed in si∣lence, nor smyled at vvith disdaine, and the rather be bucaus I am obligate your Ladieships in all devvties euer and euer.
From Cam∣busnethane the xxv of December.
