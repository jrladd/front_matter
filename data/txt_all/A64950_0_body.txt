Right Grave and Gracious Senators,
I Am become so farre presumptuous (let any man say sawcy, if I may not say submissive) as first to pre∣sent before you all these two ensu∣ing Sermons: because (the case and cause considered) I am not in the present passages particular, personall, private; but the Church of Christ amongst us; hath herein also concernments, for the setting and setling whereof I see you both studdy and struggle. For (marking both the man and the matter, I meane both my self and my Sermon, my trade and that which I taught) an information herein lies before you, what lyes are brought oftentimes to you, when you are infor∣med that (now) such persons preach, and such are the
 points they preach on. For you Two, Right Worthy and Worshipfull friends and favourers; I am thus bold to know you by name, now mine owne case is come unto the Stake, as well as Christs cause is come upon the Stage; because the one of you, as you have above twenty yeares since heard mee preach divers Sermons, so I doubt not but divers times since that time you have heard, that I have constantly continued in the very same course of publike preaching. The other of you can be best of all instructed, that I did not preach these Sermons untill I was importuned. Yea, I doubt not, but it hath beene told you, that it was told me by an house like the house of Cloe, how wicked and willfull were the most of those people, to whom I delivered this Text which hath such terrour and thunder in it (ha∣ving no thought concerning my Soveraigne, but of loyall and thankfull subjection) and that on the same day in the morning, in which I preached the first of these Sermons, I preached to another kind of people, other kinde of matter, that is more pleasing, and so more proper. Now the God of Heaven (yee God on the Earth) guide you and guard you, give you counsell and give you comfort; do great things and good things for you, doe great things and good things by you, for his owne praise, which he gives to no man; and his peoples peace which he hath left as a legacie to them: So prayes he who prayes your pardon, if not your Pa∣tronage.
