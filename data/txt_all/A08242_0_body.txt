My good Lord
JT is not vaine osten∣tation which hath moued mee to pub∣lish these Scrmons; they that know mee, know, that I was ne∣uer any of those whom S. Basil cals , which I haue heard your
Grace well interprete, Selfe-putting-forth fellowes. But being to leaue your Graces seruice, I thought meete to depose these as a small testimony of my thankfulnesse. Secondly, inten∣ding to commend another Treatise to your Graces Patronage, I resolued to premise these: it being some difficulty to finde roome for things of smaller valew in this voluminous age, which is so piled vp with bookes: for who sees not, that now the fate of Wit∣ters is the same with Preachers, whereof Saint Ierome complaines in his time:
Com. in Eccles. 9.11. Nam videas in Ecclesia imperitissimos quos{que} florere, & quia nutrierunt frontis audaciam, & volubilitatem linguae conse∣quuti sunt, prudentes se & crudi∣tos arbitrantur, maxime si fauo∣rem vulgi habuerint: You may see how in the Church the most ignorant are most esteemed, and because they haue profited in boldnesse of front,
and volubility of tongue, they thinke themselues wise and learned men; es∣pecially if the vulgar fauour them. But I know your Grace euer hated long Salutations, therefore I hast to take my leaue: resting,
