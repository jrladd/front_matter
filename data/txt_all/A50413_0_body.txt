by the Tryal which I did then un∣dergo, and what the Almighty hath since enabled me to doe; a sufficient testimony whereof are, my Noli me-tangere tactum, or a Treatise concerning Can∣cers; and the Skeleton which I made [and previously thereto pub∣lickly did] and gifted to the Bi∣liotheck of the Marischal. Col∣ledge, in the Year 1676. I must also render most hearty thanks for Your Ho checking a most invi∣dious and ignorant Mountebank H.
