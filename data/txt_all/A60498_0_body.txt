May it please your Grace,
I Beg your Pardon for my Presumption in Dedicating this Performance to your Name; but my Experience of your Goodness and Obliging Tem∣per has encouraged me to this freedom of Recommending it to your Patronage.
My Lord, 'twas not an Am∣bition of appearing in Print,
 which induced me to this Pub∣lication; but an hearty Desire (since I am not in a Publick Station) to do all the Good I can in my Private Capacity; and if this Endeavour may but prove Instrumental to the en∣crease of Piety and Devotion in any, I shall not Repent my Pains, but acknowledge the Success with all Thankfulness to God's Glory.
May the Almighty long pre∣serve your Grace, and make you a great Blessing to this Church; which is the earnest Prayer, of My Lord,
