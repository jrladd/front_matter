Madame:
BEsides that deseved in∣terest your Ladyship held in the
fections and esteeme of this worthy man more then any friend alive, which might intitle you to all that may call him Authour. This small piece of his acknowledgeth a more speciall propri∣ety unto your Lady∣ship. For though his tongue was as the Pen of a ready Wri∣ter in the hand of Christ who guided
him, yet your Lady∣ships hand and Pen was in this his scribe and Amanuensis whi∣lest hee dictated a first draught of it in pri∣vate, with intention for the publique. Jn which labour both of humility and love, your Ladyship did that honour unto him which Baruch (thogh great and Noble) did but receive in the
like, transcribing the words of Ieremiah, from his mouth: wher∣in yet your Ladyship did indeed, but write the story of your owne life, which hath beene long exactly framed to the rules herein prescribed. We there∣fore that are intru∣sted in the publishing of it, deeme it but an act of Justice in us to return it thus to your
Ladyship, unto whom it owes, even its first Birth: that so where ever this little Trea∣tise shall come, there also this that you have done, may bee told and recorded for a memorial of you. And wee could not but esteeme it al∣so an addition of ho∣nour to the worke, that no lesse then a Ladies hand (so pi∣ous
& so much honou∣red) brought it forth into the world, al∣though in it selfe it de∣serveth as much as any other this blessed wombe did beare. The Lord in way of recom∣pence, write all the ho∣ly Contents of it, yet more fully and abun∣dantly in your Lady∣ships heart, and all the lineaments of the I∣mage of Iesus Christ,
and seale up all unto you by his blessed spi∣rit, with joy and peace to the day of Re∣demption.
Madame,
