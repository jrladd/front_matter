Honour'd Madam,
I Have now unto your Ladiships acceptance, and the worlds censure, adventured these unripe fruits of a forced Muse;
 which if you shall accept (as they are truly meant) in witnesse how ready an observer I am of your commands, I shall (arming my self with patience and humility the hand-maids of obe∣dience) humbly submit and patiently resolve to bear all just blame the world may lay upon my rudenes (however your Ladiship will be able to excuse) the betraying so worthy a subject to so weake a verse. It shall suffice mee that the world take notice, that my en∣devours are only ambitious, to satisfie the ingagements, whereby your La∣diships love hath obliged me unto you: by none so paraleld as by that of Iacob to his Grand-children: who made E∣phraim and Manasses, (as Iudah, and Simeon) his owne. The like from my youth hath beene your care and tendernesse over me, which I have no
 way to requite but by my thankful∣nesse, respect and obedience to your commands. In observance whereof I commend this Poem to your patro∣nage, and my self to do you service.
