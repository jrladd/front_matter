May it please your Highness,
HAving made my former Ad∣dresses in this kind to your Highness concerning the Navigable Passage upon the Rivers Avon and Thames, between Bristol and London, and finding that to have been a Service so acceptable to your
Highness as that your deep judgment approved thereof, as a thing very advantagious to the West and South of England, I thought good in this Paper to offer unto your Highness a Work no less beneficial to the North and East, that by this means all parts of this flourishing Common-wealth under your gracious Protection, might have cause to bless your Highness, and to be sutors to your powerful hand for the allowance and per∣formance of a Work so highly conducing to the Publick good,
