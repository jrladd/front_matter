RIGHT WOR: SIR,
BOokes without Patrons, are like Babes without Parents, (for ex∣cept
the one be pleasing and plausible to humour, the various
dispositions of men, and the other left with warme portions
or legacies in the tuition of faithfull Executors or Guardians)
both Bookes and Babes are happie if they die in their birth, that
the first minute of their miserie may bee the first moment of their felicities:
these Considerations haue humbly emboldened me to lay this poore Infant of
my laborious Braine, at the doore or gate of your patronage and protection,
not doubting but your innated charity, good disposition, and vnfaigned af∣fectation
of all laudable endeauours, will giue it both free and hospitable en∣tertainment.
The function I treate of being venerable and honourable, as of
Shepheards, the profit commendable, lawfull, necessarie, ample, and vniversall,
as of Sheepe. The writing or methood of it historicall, mysticall, tropicall; ty∣picall,
literall, and Satyricall; which hath encouraged mee to dedicate my
poore Shepheardly inuention, and their harmelesse flockes to your Worships
good acceptance, whose reuerend function is truely Pastorall; acknowledging
that my many imperfections in writing, and vnworthines in handling so wor∣thy
a subiect, hath made me doubtfull to vse the protection of your Name? yet
on the other side, considering your good inclination, and mine owne humble
innocencie, both my selfe and my best indeauours I here consecrate to be em∣ployed
euer in your Worships seruice.
