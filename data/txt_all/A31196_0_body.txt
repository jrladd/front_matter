SIR,
IT may seem strange to you and all those who have had any acquain∣tance with my humour, that I should pretend to give Rules, to the practice of which there is so little disposition in my nature, insomuch that I have not escaped the Imputation of pride and singularity; the truth is, I have always had an aversion to gratifie the pride, vanity, or ambition of others, and ever disdained to make one in the affected train of every fantastick ideot, how for∣tunate

soever, I never could hear a profane or hollow jest, but my face grew stiff, and all my actions by their constraint, betrayed the little pleasure I took in such ap∣plauded trifles, nor ever did I (let me be thought to speak with∣out vanity) do an action whereof Interest was the only object, but when I found my self alone, I was grieved and ashamed at the poorness and baseness of my own spirit.
I have been guilty of many more irregularities, of which, like a man who intends to be a Convert, I make this confession to you: You remember, Sir, that the first time I was so happy to be admit∣ted into the number of your ac∣quaintance, was when I had newly left the University: Oh! how I am covered with shame, when I reflect, how infected I came from thence, with pedantry,

and a humour of contention; in all companies I discovered a spi∣rit petulant, eager, and impatient of contradiction, and the affect∣edness of my behaviour, and the constraint which constantly ap∣pear'd in my visage, failed not to displease as many as I conversed with. All this time, Sir, you were pleased to pardon my faults, and to love me for the sincerity of my soul.
But as soon as you began to reprehend me, which you always did with your usual sweetness, I began to reflect, not without some torment, on the contrary methods I took, to those by which you for∣ced all men, when you pleased, to resign, with their opinions, their hearts and affections to you: It was then that I resolved to make you the Model of my Refor∣mation, and from that time I en∣deavoured to cashier my presump∣tion

and sought to temper the violence, and impetuosity of my humour, with mildness and mo∣desty; to this end, I frankly confess, I have reduced into this method what I could either observe, or collect from others, that might any way contribute to my better conduct, though possibly I could not have taken better measures, then from your example. Suspect me not, Sir, of flattery, for all men know this for a truth, and this declaration is but a due ac∣knowledgement, of the advantage I have had from your friendship and conversation: Your perfect knowledge of me, and of my heart, makes it needless to tell you, who it is who professes himself to be,
