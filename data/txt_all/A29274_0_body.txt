MY LORD,
I Have adventured upon the Publication of this Discourse to the World, as a poor Testimony of my Obedience to Your Lordships Pleasure. Up∣rightness is my Subject; and the Great Example of it is a PRINCE, to whose Memory you pay homage. Religion shines in such Instances, and borrows new Majesty from the Pattern; nay Martyrdom it self looks Royal, and the Blood (thus shed) paints its Glory.
It is one Mistake in the World, to cry down Titles as meer Names; when as they produce Noble Effects, and are such a shadow to Virtue, that they protect it by following. If Goodness gives Honour a real grace, Honour pays it back in opinion; therefore the usefulness that is in it, renders it a fit Object of our regard: However alone it cannot profit the Persons, without Goodness be joyned.
You (MY LORD) have a great share in Temporal Dignity: Your try'd worth has recommended You to Your Prince, and the stedfast Integrity of Your Actings: The first provokes Envy, and the second Love to ac∣knowledge it. Your Fastness to the CHURCH is as well known, and the employment of Your Power to oblige. May God continue You an Instrument in His Service, establish You with His Grace, and preserve in You a Goodness as well as Greatness of Name; which is the earnest Prayer of,
MY LORD,
