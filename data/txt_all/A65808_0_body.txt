Gentlemen,
IT's usual for the Printing of a Ser∣mon, to plead the Importunity of some or other, as if that must atone for all its Weaknesses and Defects.
I wave this as an old fashion'd Apo∣logy and out of Date.
Besides, I would not be so Vnkind to my Country-Men, if I were guilty of a Fault, to make them Accessaries, and draw them into a Participation of my Guilt.
I am very well satisfied no Man can think Meaner of this Vndertaking than he who undertook it; and if I have done neither Honour nor Service to your Native Country, yet I meant so well, and intended it, I would certainly have done it if I could. I am,
GENTLEMEN,
