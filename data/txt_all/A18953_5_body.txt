THose pardon'd men who taste their Princes loues,
(As married to new life) do giue you Gloues;
But I haue chosen rather to present
You, with the off'ring of a faire intent.
And though your iustest sentence lost it's scope,
Yet I presume, your goodnesse will find hope
In my vnquestion'd alteration: so
You kil'd my sin, though my life'scapt the blow.
And that is justice obiect's faire extent,
To iudge the Past, the new ills to preuent.
For were the Bench of mens repentance sure:
None should the strictnesse of the Law endure.


So thriue this worke, as in effect it may
My vice, and true repentance, both display.
