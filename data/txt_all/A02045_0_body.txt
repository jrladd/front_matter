SIth noble Maxi∣milian, king of Boemia: Defended hath this worthy worke in Latin toung (I saic).

Sith that also the godly prince
Edward, our late good king:
In French the same accepted hath
as a right nedefull thing.


I thought therfore my duty was,
(most honorable Lorde):
Soure worthy captain now to chuse
who with benigne accorde.



In English wold vouchsafe to saue,
this Castle from decay:
Protecting it from enuious toungs
that runne at large alway.


But whom might I rather elect,
my Patrone now to bee:
Then one who doth most mē excell,
in perfect clemencie?


In feruent zeale to godlynes,
In fauour of the iust:
In forwardnes to all good works,
the truth this tell needs must.


A note of highe Nobility,
a vertuous one in deed:
Whose good report hath caused me,
thus boldly to proceed.


Right happy sure may be yt realme,
and praise to god extend:
Wherin such prudēt peeres do rule, Exod. 18. Deut. 1.
as Moses doth commend.



Yea blest it is of God the lorde,
that hath such worthy states:
Who righteousnes rightly exaltes,
and wickednes abates.


These golden giftes of godly grace,
thus planted in your brest:
Haue forced me to flie for ayde,
where plenty is exprest.


Receue therfore (o worthy Lorde),
an humble harte and true:
Protect also the Patronage,
which I submitte to you.


And graūt yt these my labors small,
may passe vnder your name:
Sith that this worke descēded hath,
from Princes of great fame.


For though that all Forgetfulnes,
be banisht from you quyte:
Yet hope I that this Treatise shall,
you honor much delyte.



Considering well the worthines,
of perfect Memory:
And what effect it furnisheth,
in all affayres. for why?


Lyke as Obliuion is the losse,
of high renoumed actes:
And causeth many worthy wightes,
forgo both fame and factes.


Lyke as it is an eatyng moth
and sore corrupting rust:
Abasyng things of noble state,
no better then to dust.


Lyke as it is a Chaos great,
confusedly compact:
Wherin al things both good & had,
haue true proporcion lackt.


So Memorie doth still preserue,
eche thing in his degree:
And rendreth vnto euery one,
his doughty dignitie.



So doth it pourge ech mans estate,
and skoureth it full bright:
Wherby appeares as in a glasse
his liuely shining light.


So doth it geue and attribute,
to good thinges good report:
To bad lykewise as they deserue,
in iust and equall sort.


How can yt Iudge iuste iudgement geue,
except he call to mynde: Iudge.
The matters hanging diuersly,
the truth thereby to fynde.


Howe shall the Preacher wel recite
his matters orderlie: Preacher.
If that he be forgetfull of,
his places what they bee?


How can yt Captayn well conduct,
his soldiers in array: Captayn.
Or els preuent his ennemyes,
yf Memory be away?



How shal the Marchant safely kepe, Marchant.
his recknings from decay:
If his Remēbrance shuld him fayle,
though writīg beare great sway?


How can yt Lawyer plead his cause,
before the iustyce seat: Lawyer.
If he his clyents matters shall,
at any tyme forgeat?


How shall the Husbandanā prouide,
all seasons to obserue: Husband∣man.
If he do not remember well,
or any wise doe swerue?


How needfull then is Memorye,
to rule a publike weale:
In things deuyne & eke prophane?
God graunt it neuer fayle.


Or how can it at any tyme,
be spared in the fielde?
That is so requysite at home,
and strong defending shielde.



A good wit sone may learne things,
and vnderstand the same:
But them still to retayne and keep
in such order and frame,


That nothing be wanting therof,
when iust occasion shall
Procure rehearsall of such thinges,
as did to vs befall


Is thoffice of the Memorie,
the greatest gifte that can
Here in this world by any meanes,
come vnto mortall man.


For what helps it good bokes to read
or noble storyes large:
Except a perfect Memorye,
doe take therof the charge?


What profits is most worthy thīges
to see, or els to heare:
If that the same come in at thone,
and out at thother eare?



Why? then the matter is so playn,
that need (a perfect ground):
Doth vs compell to say no lesse,
when truth is truly found.


Therfore I breifly thus conclude,
take Memorye away.
What is a man? what can be doe?
or els what can he say?


Restore the same to him againe
in full integrytie:
It will him sone reduce in dede,
to all felicytie.


Wherin god graūt your honor may
longe here with vs endure:
And afterwards in heauens hie,
emong the Angels pure.

Amen.
