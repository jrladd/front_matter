YF S. Paul (Most Grati∣ous Soueraigne) being accused of the whole Synagog of the Iewes, by their Orator Tertul∣lus of diuers heynous crimes, both a∣gainst Gods and the Princes lawes, found notwithstanding such equitie in the heathen President Festus, as that he answered his aduersaries, that it was not the Romans custome to cō∣demne Act. 2 any man before he haue his ac∣cusers present, and place to make his answer: and also such fauour at the The like re∣porteth Plutarch of K. Alexan. the great. Act. 26. Iewish King Agrippa his hands, as he both licenced him to speake for him selfe, & afforded him fauorable audi∣ence. Much more cause haue your
 Maiesties Catholique Subiects, being accused of the ministers by a hyred spokesman Bel, to expect the like, yea greater fauor & equitie at your Graces handes. For if the Romans though Heathens, thought it iniustice to con∣demne any particular man at the cla∣mors of a whole nation, before his ac∣cusers were present and his defence were heard? And if King Agrippa, al∣beit He killed S. Iames and emprisoned S. Peter. Act. 12. a Iew & persecutor of Christians, deemed it notwithstanding a Princes part to geuē audience to one accused of that Religion which he both hated and persecuted: How much more wil a Christian Prince forbeare to con∣demne the vniuersal cause of his Ca∣tholique subiects at the slaunders and outcries of ministers & one hyred Pro∣ctor, before their accusers be brought face to face, and they haue time and place graunted to answer for them selues? wherein we shal account our selues more happy then S. Paul, be∣cause we shal plead our cause, not be∣fore a Iewish, but a Christian King, &
 such a one as better knowerh the que∣stions and customes of the Christians, then King Agrippa did of the Iewes.
VVherfore seeing that of late Tho∣mas Bel (a fugitiue once from Prote∣stants religion, as he is now from Ca∣tholiques) hath not only accused, but also malitiously slādered the vniuersal Catholique cause, in a booke which he hath dedicated to your Maiestie, & termed it the Dovvnefall of Poperie, and withal challengeth, dareth, yea adiu∣reth (in which case our B. Sauiour Matth. 26. though with danger of his life made answer) al English Iesuits, Seminary Priests, and (as he speaketh) Iesuited Papists to answer him. I haue presu∣med vpon your Gratious fauour to ac∣cept his chaleng, and am ready to per∣forme it hand to hand, if your Maie∣stie graunt licence, and in the meane time, to dedicate to your Name this my confutation of his arguments and slaunders. VVherin I speake not for my selfe as S. Paul did before King Agrippa, but for the religion of your
 owne Progenitors and Predecessors, for the faith of our Forefathers, for the cause of al Catholiques, and for the good (I dare say) of your Maiesties owne person & kingdoms. For though Bel calumniate Christian Kinges and pag. 17. Emperors with opening the window to al Antichristian tyranny, and Ca∣tholiques generally, with thinking p. 1. 22. Christ to be killed a thousand times a day and the like: yet especially he slan∣dereth the Popes with vsurping pow∣er proper to God, and to depose Prin∣ces, and dispose of their kingdomes at his pleasure, therby to alienate your mind from the Sea Apostolike. wher∣in he not onely abuseth your patiēce with telling you vntruths, but greatly harmeth and endamageth your selfe and Realme, by endeuoring through Vir Aposta∣ta prauo co∣rde machi∣natur malū, omni tem∣pore iurgia Seminat. ouer. c. 6. his false slanders to auert your minde from the Popes, who haue bene the most ancient, most assured, and most beneficial frends, which the Kinges & Realme of England euer had. VVhich thing that I may make manifest vnto
 your Grace, I humbly beseech you geue me leaue to set downe some pra∣ticular examples of the mutual amitie, kind offices, & benifites, which haue euer bene betwixt the Popes and the Princes of this land. VVherein if I be somewhat longer then men in Epistles The loue & benefits of Popes to England and Kings therof. S. Peter P. vse to be, I hope that the varietie and profit of the matter wil make requital.
Not long after the Apostolike Seat was settled in Rome, S. Peter the first Pope, about the 63. yeare of Christ came hither (as not only Gretians, but Metaphrast. tract. de Pet. & Paul. a∣pud Lippo∣man. Cambden in descrip. Bri∣tan p. 52. And Nice∣phor. as he saieth. Protestants also confesse) stayed here a long time, conuerted many Nations to Christs faith, erected Churches, or∣dered Bishops, and Priests, and being admonished of an Angel, returned from hence to Rome to suffer Martyr∣dome. Neither was this loue to our Countrie extinguished by death, but as he promised to some, so he had it 2. Pet. 1. also in mind after his death, and mira∣culously assisted it in the greatest di∣stresses. So that truly wrote S. Ser∣gius Malmesbur. lib. 1. Pont. Angl. p. 209. 1. Pope vnto our Kings of Eng∣land
 almost a thousand yeares agoe, that S. Peter was mindful of them: & Pope Alexander 3. to King. Henry 2. ugubin. de donat. Cōst. that England was vnder S. Peters pro∣tection euer since Christs name was glorified there. For when our country about the yeare 611. began to Aposta∣tate from the faith of Christ, and the Bishops were determined to forsake the land. S. Perer appearing to Sainct Laurence Arch-bishop of Canturbury did seuerly rebuke and scourge him because he would abandon the flocke which I (said S. Peter) cōmitted vnto thee. This miracle is so certaine as some Protestāts confesse it, & though Gadvvin in the life of S. Laurence. some others wil not beleue it, because they haue neither seene nor put their singers into S. Laurence his wounds; yet it may suffice any indifferent man, that it was auouched by S. Laurence, beleeued by King Edbald & his peo∣ple, lib. 2. hist. c. 6. Malmesb. lib. 1. Reg. & lib. 2. Pont. Huntingt. l. 3. Marian. A. 693. al. 617. VVestman. 616. who thereupon returned to the Chaistian faith, recorded by S. Beda aboue eight hūdred yeares agoe (who wrote nothing but what he knew him
 selfe or receaued from credible men, whose history was approued by the King of his dayes & by the Protestants Godvvin in life of Tat∣vvin. Cambd. in Britania. p. 12. now) and finallie it is contested & de∣liuered by our best Chroniclers.
Not long before, when the King had built a Monasterie and Church in honor of S. Peter, where now west∣minster standeth, S. Peter came from heauen and consecrated (as by mira∣cle he confirmed) the same church, promising that there he would heare the prayers of the faithful. VVherupō King Edward Conss: reedified that church of new & chose it for the place of his sepulture, whom the most of his successors haue imitated, and bene there also crowned. Authors of this are Abbat Ealred, Malmesburiensis In vit. S. E∣duardi. Malmesbur. l. 1. de Pont. See Sauil ep. ad Reg. Eli∣zab. ante Malmesbur. Epist. ad E∣duard. R. a∣pud Sur. Baron. An. 610. (a man highlie esteemed of Prote∣stants) P. Nicolas 2. and others. In like maner when England was sore oppressed by the Danes, S. Peter was seene of Brithwald a holie B: of win∣chester, in a vision to anoint S. Edward Conss: King of England, and to fore∣tel
 the yeares of his raigne, and the end of the Danish fury, adding withal these most comfortable words. The kingdome of England is the kingdome of Loc. cit. Mal∣mesb. lib. 2. reg. cap. 13. p. 91. lib. 8. histor. Angl. God. This testifie the foresaid Ealred, Malmesbury, Polidor, and others. If Protestāts obiect against my Authors, that they were Papists, I must confesse (but to their shame) that I finde no protestāt writer before K. Henry 8. his time: yet such papists they are as pro∣testants account some of them the sin∣gular Cambden in Britan. p. 12. & in Dur∣ham. Stovv A-726. Bel in dovv∣nefal p. 54. of S Beda. Sauil of Masmes∣bur. Hun∣ting. and Hoveden. epist. ante Malmesbur. ornamēts of England, especial friends of truth, and renowmed through Christen∣dom for vertue and learning, and others they cal faithful recorders of things done, good and diligent Authors, and most true guides of the times past. Such also they are, as wrote long before protestants were, & therefore not vpon any splene against them: and finallie such they are, as vpon their authority principal∣lie dependeth al the credit of our En∣glish Chronicles. Others perhaps wil say, that the foresaid histories are not in scripture. True: nor almost any
 thing els in al our Chronicles. Shal we therefote beleue nothing but what God reporteth? I request no more, but that the foresaid matters be as wel cre∣dited, as other things are, which the same Authors report.
This affection and loue towards England was not proper to S. Peter alone, but descended vnto his succes∣sors. For when the sweet sound of the Ghospel first preached here by him, had so increased, as it came to the eares of Lucius then King of this land, he sending to Rome for preachers, P. Eleutherius about the yeare 156. sent P. Eleuthe∣rius A. 156. S. Beda lib. 1. c. 4. Martyr. Rom. 26. Ado & Ma∣rian. in chronic. VVestmon. A. 188. Stovv 179. hither S. Fugatius and S. Damian, who baptized the King, Queene, and almost al his people. VVhereby our Country became the first, that pub∣likely professed the faith of Christ, and there vpon is called Primogenita Ecclesiae. The like charitable office per∣formed also P. Victor vnto Scotland P. Victor. 203. Boet. lib. 6. histor. Scot. Genebr. chron. in Victore. about the yeare 203. sending thither his legates at the request of King Do∣naldus, who conuerted the King to∣gether
 with the Q. and nobility And about the yeare 324. Pope Siluester P. Siluester. 324. Constant. in edicto Me∣nolag. Grae∣cor. cal. Ion. Huntingt. l. 1. hist. p. 306. Acta liberij. vita Silue∣stri. hauing perfectlie instructed our great Emperor Constantin, baptized him, and miraculouslie cured him of his leprosie, as the said Emp. and many others testifie. Afterward when the Christian faith in Britany began to be infected with heresie, P. Celestin a∣bout P. Celestin. A. 432. Prosper in chron. An. 432. Baron. 429. Prosper An. 434. Beda l. 1. c. 13. Plat. in Celesti∣no. Baron. Ann. 429. Cambden in Hibernia. Marian. in chron. Cambd. in Hibern. the yeare 432. sent hither S. S. German and Lupus for to expel and confute the heresies, which they accō∣plished. And the same P. in the yeare 434. consecrated Palladius a Bishop, and sent him to Scotland, where as yet was no B: & not forgetful of Ireland, sent thither S. Patrick, who with mi∣racles cōuerted the Iland, & deserued (saith Cambdin) the title of Apostle thereof. Thus cōtinued the loue of the Sea Apostolicke towards our Coūtrey al the time that the Britōs possessed it.
But towards our English nation, after they had conquered this Iland, Beda lib. 1. . 22. it was far greater. For whereas not only the Britons refused, but the
 French also and other Christian na∣tions Gregor. lib. 5. epist. 58. 59. Gadvvin us life of S. Austin. neglected, to preach vnto our English aunciters, who euer vntil that time had bene Pagans, & bondslaues (saith S. Beda) of Idols: only Rome lib. 2. c. 1. put forth hir helping hand to draw thē out of that darcknes & miserie of Infidelity. For no sooner that blessed & holie father S. Gregory (as Gadwin P. Gregory. An. 596. loc. cit. calleth him) vnderstood that the An∣gles or English (whom for their bewtie and his tender affection he called An∣gels) were Pagans, but forthwith he Beda lib. 2. c. 1. Malmesb. l. 1. Reg. went to the P: (being him selfe yet a monke) and desired him to send Preachers into England, and offering him selfe to be one: And obtaining Ioan. Di. in vit. Gre∣gor. licence came on his voyadge towards England three daies Iourney, but was recalled at the importunity of the Ro∣manes, who were vnwilling to forgoe soe worthie a man, neuertheles he for∣got not his holie enterprise. For as soone (saith S. Beda l. 1. cap. 1.) as he was high Bishop ouer the vvhole vvorlde, he made our nation the Church of Christ,
 vvhich had bene euer vntil that time the bondslaue of Idols. And in the yeare 596. Beda sup. Stovv. An. 596. God∣vvin. sup. sent hither S. Augustin with almost forty Moncks more to preach, who be∣ing receaued of K: Ethelbert in short time conuerted both him & his Coū∣try. And that they preached the true faith and religion of Christ, appeared by the miracles they wrought in testi∣mony thereof, which were so great, and many, as it seemed (saith S. Gre∣gory) lib. 7. epist. 30. that they imitated the vertues of the Apostles by the miracles they wrought, and are withal so certaine, as they are not only testified by the said S. Gre∣gory lib. 9. ep. 56. 8. Beda lib. 1. c. 31. l. 2. c. 2. Apud God∣vvin. in vit. August. Godvvin. sup. Stovv An. 603. Cambd. in Britan. p. 104. in diuers places, S. Beda & other ancient writers, and by the Epitaph of S. Augustins tombe, but cōfessed also by diuers Protestants. Againe in the yeare 601. he sent more Preachers and with them al things necessary for the furniture and seruice of the Church, as holie vessels (saith S. Beda) Aultar Beda lib. 1. c. 29. clothes, apparel for priests and Clarcks, re∣liques of holie Apostles and Martirs, and many bookes, and a Palle to S. Augustin
 to vse only (writeth S. Gregory) at Masse, Apud Bed. sup. appointed also him to be ouer al the Bishops and Priests of Britany, and gaue him licence to institute 24. Bi∣shopricks, whereof 12. should be vnder his prouince, and 12. vnder yorke. Besides he sent rich presents of Bed. lib. 1. c. 32. Gregor. lib. 9. epist. 59. 60. diuers sorts, and letters vnto the King and Queene, for to confirme them in their faith: and sent order also into Gregor. lib. 5. epist. 10. France to buy such English youths as were there slaues, and to send them vp to Rome there to be brought vp in vertue & learning. VVherein he gaue the example of the English Seminary which not long after, our English Kings founded in Rome. This was the exceeding loue of this B. Pope to∣wards our Nation, vvhom vve may vvel, and must (saith S. Beda lib. 2. c. 1.) cal our Apostle, and may lavvfullie pro∣nounce of him that saying of the Apostle. 1. Cor. . Although he vvere not an Apostle to others, yet he vvas vnto vs: For the signe of his Apostleship vve are in our Lord.
Neither was this great good so hap∣pilie
 begun and planted in our nation by S. Gregorie and his Legates, negle∣cted by the Popes his successors, but rather diligentlie watered and furde∣red by them, as appeareth by the let∣ters Bed. lib. 2. c. 10. 11. Hun∣tingt. l. 3. Bed. lib. 2. c. 17. Hunting. sup. Bed. lib. 4. c. 18. Hunt. l. 4. p. 335. Malmesbur. l. 1. Pontif. p. 197. VVestm o∣nast. A. 789. Malmesb. l. 2. Reg. p. 47. A. 804. P. Honorlus An. 635.

Honorius his sending hither in the yeare 635. that Apostolical man S. Birin, who conuerted the west Sa∣xons: and by P. Vitalian, who in 668. sent hither those holie and great lear∣ned men S. Theodor and Adrian, by whose teaching Englishmen in short time became the rarest men, and best learned of their age, and the first foun∣ders of the vniuersities in Paris, and Pauia, and consequentlie the chiefest fountaines of the learning which hath bene since in the west. After this time Eardulf King of Northumberland,
 being driuen out of his kingdome & countrey, P. Leo 3. in the yeare 808. P. Leo 3. An. 808. Amoinus l. 4. c. 94. Re∣gino in chron. Ba∣ron. 808. sent Card: Adalph his legate into En∣gland, who with the helpe of Charles the greats Embassadors, restored the King peaceablie vnto his kingdome. Not long after P. Leo 4. dispensed P. Leo 4. 855. Gathezelin in vit. S. Sui∣thuni apud Sut. Baron. 855. with King Ethelwal for to marry, which he being a Subdeacon could not do lawfullie: & at the same kings request crowned his sonne Alfred VVestmo∣nast. 855. Ba∣ron. sup. King, and adopted him for his sonne. who afterward, for his worthie deeds both in warre & peace was surnamed the great, and for al things became the rarest Prince that England (and per∣haps Christendom) euer had. Soone after in the yeare 883. at the suite of the King Alfred, the great P. Martin P. Martin. 1. 883. VVestmo∣nast. & Ba∣ron. A. 883. Gadvvin in vit. Pleg. 1. released the tribute which the En∣glish schoole or Seminary then in Rome paide, & sent to the King many guifts, among which was a good piece of the holie Crosse.
In the yeare 990, when Richard: Marques of Normandie had purposed
 to inuade England, and make warre vpon king Ethelred, P. Iohn 15. sent P. Ihon. 15. An. 990. Epist. apud Malmesb. l. 2. Reg. c. 10. Baron. An. 990. his Nuntio and letters to take vp the matter, who happilie brought them to agreement: and about the yeare 1059. P. Nicolas the second granted to king P. Nicolas 2. 1059. Epist. ad E∣duard. R. a∣pud Sur. in cit. Eduardi. Edward Conss. and his successors, ad∣uocationem & tuitionem omniū totius An∣gliae Ecclesiarum, the aduouzon & pro∣tection of al the Churches in Englād. And in the yeare 1094. P. Vrban 2. in P. Vrban. 2. 1094. Malmesbur. l. 1. Pontif. p. 223. Gadvvin in vit. An∣selmi. a councel at Bari, appointed that S. Anselme Archbishop of Canterburie and his successors should sit in Coun∣cels besides the Archdeacon of Rome, who sitteth before the P. adding these honourable words Includamus hunc in orbe nostro tanquam alterius orbis Papam, wheras before it was vnknowne (saith Malmesbury) what place belonged to our Archibishop; & the same place did P. Paschal 2. confirme in a coun∣cel at Rome about the yeare 1102. But besids this, diuers other dignities haue bene graunted to the Sea of Canturb: Malmesbur. sup. p. 208. 209. by the Popes, as that it should be Pri∣mate
 ouer al Britany, and the B: legati¦nati, Polid. lib. 13. Gadvvin in vit. Theo∣baldi. and other like dignities.
Moreouer in the yeare. 1098. the Scottish men (saith Genebrard out of Genebrard. chron. in Vrban. 2. Pa∣scali 2. Leo∣ne 9. Maior & Boethius two Scottish Chro∣niclers) obtained of P. Vrban 2. for their Prince, that he might haue the name, title, and anointment of a king (which the Hungarians and Poloni∣ans Baron. An. 1000. had obtained for their Princes, about the yeare 1000.) whereupon Edgar was then first anointed King of Scotland. And about 1107. P. Pascal P. Pascal. 2. 1107. Malmesbur. lib. 5. Reg. p. 163. 2. writing to king Henry 1. among o∣ther things promiseth so to fauor him and his sonne, as vvho (saith he) hur∣teth you or him may seeme to haue hurt the Church of Rome. And in the yeare 1152. when K. Steephen (hauing vsurped the Crowne of England) would haue caused the Bishops to Crowne his sōne Eustace, thereby to exclude for euer the right heyre Henry 2. Pope Euge∣nius P. Eugenius 3. An. 1152. Stovv A. 1152. Gad∣vvin in vit. Theobaldi. 3. sent commaundement to the Cleargie not to medle in that matter, whereby it was hindered. In the yeare
 1160. P. Adrian 4. gaue vnto King P. Adrian. 4. 1160. Stovv. An. 1160. Henrie 2. the dominion and regiment of Ireland, and sent vnto him the Bul of his graunt with a ring of golde in VVestmon. token of the inuestiture: which graūt at the request of the said K. P.

Lucius 3. successor to the said Alexander, his good wil appea∣reth by the great praise which he gi∣ueth to our English kings, whom he writeth to haue far exceeded the rest of Christiā Princes in warlike prowes and noblenes of minde. VVhich affe∣ction continued also in his successor P. Vrban 3. of whom (as Houeden P. Vrban. 3. An. 1185. part. 2. p. 631. writeth) K: Henry 2. obtained many things, whereof one was that he might crowne which of his sonnes he would of the kingdome of Ireland, which he Stovv. Ann. 1185. confirmed by a bul, and in token of his good wil & confirmation, sent to him a crowne. And lastlie P. Clement the P. Clement. 3. An. 1189. Hovved. p. 2. pag. 652. VVestmo∣nast. A. 1189. third in the yeare 1189. when, not only the French king, but also his sonnes and Nobles had conspired against the
 said K: & inuaded his dominions with a far greater power then he was able to resist, sent a Cardinal to exhort them to peace, who excommunicated the hinderers of the peace, and threatned to interdict the French kings coun∣trey vnles he made peace with En∣gland.
Likewise in the yeare 1193. when K: Richard Ceur de lyon was taken pri∣soner, as he came from the holie land by the Duke of Austria, P. Celestin 3. P. Celestin. 3. A. 1193. VVestmon. Ann. 1193. Stovv 1195. Polid. l. 14. at the K: request excommunicated the D: and enioyned him to release the couenants which he had constrayned the K: to make, and to send home the pledges: who not obeying the Pope he soone after died miserablie, and was left vnburied vntil his sonne had sent home the pledges, and sworne to stand to the iudgemēt of the Church. And in the yeare 1207. P. Innocent 3. P. Innocent. 3. An. 1207. Stovv Ann. 1207. sent to K: Iohn an eloquent Epistle and diuers pretious Iewels. And in the yeare. 1215. when the Barons had ex∣torted from the said king certaine
 charters and liberties, the P. at the Kings request disanulled them, and Stovv 1195. 1296. 1297. Gadvvin in vit. Steph. Langton. Polid. lib. 15. 16. excōmunicated the Barons which had rebelled against him, & when the said Barons had called in Lewis the Prince of France, chosen him their King, and yeelded the chiefest Citties & holdes into his hands, soe that England was in euident danger to be lost, the P. sent his Legate to assist kinge Iohn, and to forbid the French vpon paine of excōmunication to enter into En∣gland, which he stoutlie performed. Also in the yeare 1253. P. Innocent 4. P. Innocent. 4. An. 1253. Comin ven∣tura nella relat. de Na∣poli. Polid. lib. 16. Stovv A. 1254. bestowed the Royal title and right of the kingdomes of Naples and Sicily vpon Edmond sonne to K: Henry 3; and sent by a Cardinal the inuestiture thereof. And 1257. P. Alexander 4. P. Alexan∣der 4. Ann. 1257. VVestmon. An. 1259. sent Messengers vnto Richard bro∣ther to the said king, for to assure him of the Imperial dignity and to exhorte him to goe into Germany to receaue it, which he did, and was crowned king of Romans at Aquisgran. And in the yeare 1292. when the Barons
 had wrested out of the said K. hands certaine liberties, P. Vrban 4. at the P. Vrban. A. 1262. Stovv Ann. 1262. 1264. kings suite, sent a Legate to accurse the Barons that had rebelled in de∣fence of the said liberties.
Againe in the yeare 1272. at the re∣quest of king Edward 1. P. Gregory P. Gregory 10. An. 1272. VVestmon. An. 1272. Po∣lid. lib. 17. 10. excommunicated Guy of Monfort for killing the kings Coosin German in a church at Viterbo, and condem∣ned him of wilful and priuy murder, of Sacriledge and treason, declared him to be infamous, and incapable of any office in the commonwealth, and disherited his posterity vnto the fourth generation, and excommunicated al those that intertained him and inter∣dicted their dominions. And in the same kings time was Cambridge of a Cambden in descript. Cantabrig. p. 435. ex Re∣mington. p. Clement. 5. 1311. Clement. it. de Magst. c. 1. schoole made an vniuersity by the P. & soone after in the yeare 1311. vnder king Edward the second P. Clement 5. appointed that in Oxford should be read two lectures of the Hebrew, Ara∣bick, and Caldaick tongue, and au∣thorized it for one of the famousest
 vniuersities in Christendome. Also in P. Ihon. 22. An. 1316. Polid. lib. 17. Stovv. An. 2316. the yeare 1316. P. Iohn 22. at K: Ed∣ward 2. his request, sent two Legates to make peace betwixt England and Scotland, and to reconcile Thomas Earle of Lancaster to the King, who excommunicated the Scots, because they would not agree to peace. And in the same yeare at the kings petitiō, the P. confirmed al the ancient priui∣ledges of the vniuersity of Cambridge, which of long time they had enioyed by the benefit (writeth Stow) of the Stovv. 1317. Popes predecessors.
Moreouer in the yeare 1489. Pope P. Innocent. 8. A. 1489. Stovv. Ann. 1486. Innocent the eight sent a Nuntio to take vp the variance betwixt the King of Scotland and his people, but be∣fore his arriual the King was slaine. And about the yeare 1504. When there arose a contention betwene K: Henry 7. & Ferdinand King of Spaine about the precedence, P. Iulius 2. hauing P. Iulio 2. A. 1504. Valaterran. Comin ven∣tura. Stovv ib. heard both their Embassadors gaue sentence for the King of England. And in the yeare 1505. sent to the said
 King a sword & Cap of maintenance, as to a defendor of the Church. But as no King of Englād deserued better of the Sea Apostolick then K: Henry 8. did for a long time, so none recea∣ued more honor from thence then he did. For he receaued not only from P.

And though Q. Elizabeth had vt∣terly cast of the Popes friendship, yet he forsooke not hir. For Pius 4. sup∣posing P. Pius 4. A. 1560. that she had reuolted from that
 Sea, rather for feare lest her title to the crowne might be called in question, because one P. had before declared her birth, to be vnlawful, then for dis∣like of the religion which in her father  and sisters daies she had professed, sent a Nuntio to promise her al fauor  touching her title to the crowne: And soone after an other, to request her to send her diuines to the Councel of Trent with promise of al security and liberty. Neither may I leaue your Ma∣iestie out of the number of the Princes of this land, who haue tasted the loue & frindship of the Sea Apostolike: Be∣cause P. Clement. 8. 1603. out of your owne grateful mind, you haue publiquely professed, your Proclamat.  1. egni. selfe behoulding vnto P. Clement 8. for his temporal carriadge, and diuers kinde offices towards your Maiestie. Besides he hath (as it is reported) cen∣sured al such as shal molest your grace, and hath often times professed that he would willinglie giue his life for the eternal good of our countrey. VVhich is the greatest loue that one can beare
 (as our Sauiour testifieth) vnto his friend. Oh how great enimies are they vnto England, who seeke by false slaunders to make such friends odious vnto vs.
By this which hath bene said (omit∣ting much more for breuity) your Maiestie clearlie seeth, how greatlie and how continally the Sea Aposto∣lique hath euer fauored the Christian Princes of this land: how many and how great benefits both spiritual and temporal, Popes haue bestowed vpon them, and in their dangers and distres∣ses according to their power assisted them. VVeigh (I beseech your grace) in the ballance of your Princely wis∣dome, the forsaid benefits, with such as your selfe or Auncitors haue recea∣ued from the rest of Christendom, and Popes haue benefited Engl. more then al Christendo∣me besyds. you shal finde that the Sea Aposto∣licke alone, hath more benifyted En∣gland, then al Christendom besides, and consequentlie that the forsaking of the Popes friendship hath more en∣dammaged your Realme, then if it
 had forsaken the rest of Christendom. But especiallie (I humblie beseech your Maiestie) weigh them with such as Bel, or any minister can shew you to haue receaued, from their two seats of pestilence in witenberge and Geneua. VVhat kingdomes haue they bes∣towed vpon you? vnto what imperial or Royal dignity haue they exalted you? from what Paganisme haue they conuerted your land? what enimies haue they appeased? what assistance haue they afforded you in any need? what good, litle or great haue they brought to this land? Now what mis∣cheefe haue they not brought? That Bel in his ovvne iud∣gemēt vvas both an A∣postata and Traiter vvhiles he vvas Preist. one Apostata, and fierbrand of sedi∣tiō Knox, sent from Geneua, brought more mischiefe to your Grandmo∣ther, your B. mother, to your father, and Kingdom of Scotland, then I can rehearse, or your Maiestie without great griefe can remember. Ministers pretend the loue of the Ghospel, as the cause of persuading you from friendship with the Pope: But yet
 disswade not from friendship with the Turke. They pretend also your graces See Conser. at Hamp∣ton Court. p. 80. 81. security: But the true cause indeed your Maiestie descried & discouered in Knox, to wit their owne security & aduaūcement, which they fear would be endangered, if you kept your an∣cient, and surest friend, and therefore with your losse (as your maiestie per∣ceaued in your Grandmothers case) they worke their owne wealth and se∣curity. And thus much of the Popes. The laue & benefits of the British Kings to the Sea A∣postolik. Note this.
As for the Christian Princes of this land, though they haue bene of foure different, and most opposite nations, to wit Britons, English, Danes, and Normans, yet haue they al agreed in keeping the league of friendship with the Pope, being officious vnto him, & accoūting him their especial friend. Of the British kings of this land first K. Lucius A. 156. Beda lib. 1. c. 4. is King Lucius, whose particular affe∣ction towards the Sea Apostolick, is euident, by that he neglecting other Christian Churches neare vnto him, he sent so far as to Rome for Prea∣chers.
 As for Constantin the great Constantin Mag. 324. (the immortal glory of the British kings) his extraordinary loue and affection vnto the Sea of Rome is more notorious then I need rechear∣se. For he not only gaue vnto the Pope the gouernment of Rome, and of a good parte of the west (as be∣sides him selfe, and Latin historio∣graphers, Constant. in edicto. Isi∣dor. Eugu∣bin de do∣nat. Constāt. Grat. d. 69. Iuo. Genebr. in chron. Photius seu Balsam. in nomoran. R. Abraham in Zikron Dibre Ro∣mi. Abben Estra 11. Da∣niel. Cadualader. Polid. lib. 3. both Greecks and Iewes professed enimies to the Pope do te∣stifie) but also serued him as a lac∣key houlding his stirrop and leading his horse by the bridle. Cadwalla∣der also the last British king in En∣gland, hauing lefte his countrey went no whither but to Rome, and there ended his daies. And if the histories of those anciēt times were more perfect, or the Britons had raigned longer in this Iland, no doubt but we should haue more examples of their deuotion to the Sea of Rome, as appeareth by Salomon A. 869. Argenteus. histor. Brit. lib. 2. c. 27. Baron. An. 9. Salomon their King in litle Britany, after they had bene driuen hence by the Saxons; who writing to Pope A∣drian
 the second beginneth his letter thus. Domino ac beatissimo Apost: sedis Rom: Hadriano, Salomon Britanorum Rex flexis genibus inclinatoque capite. And sendeth him his statua in gold, with diuers rich guifts and money, promi∣seth a yearlie pension, and acknowled∣geth his Royal title to haue bene gi∣uen to him by Popes. This was the loue of the British kings vnto the Sea Apostolike.
To the British kings succeeded the The loue & benefits of the English Kings. K. Ethelbert An. 596. Beda lib. . c. 25. Saxons or English, as wel in their loue and reuerence to the Sea of Rome, as in their kingdome. For king Ethel∣bert at the very first receaued S. Gre∣gory his Legats very courteouslie, prouided them of al things necessary, and freelie licensed them to preach, vsing these gratious words worthie to be imitated of your Maiestie in the like case. For so much as you are come so far to impart vnto vs such knovv∣ledge as you take to be true, vve vvil not trouble you, but rather vvithal courtesie re∣ceaue you. After him king Ofwin ha∣uing K. Osvvin. A. 665.
 perfectly learned that the Church of Rome (saith S. Beda) was the Ca∣tholique Lib. 3. c. 29. and Apostolicke Church, sent thither in the yeare 665. a Priest to be consecrated Archbishop of Can∣terbury. And in a conference about the obseruation of Easter, hearing that the keies of heauen were giuen to S. Peter, concluded thus. I vvil not gaine Bed. lib. 3. c. 25. Bar. An. 664. say such a Porter as this is, but as far as I knovv and am able, I vvil couet in al points to obey his ordinance. And in the yeare 670 he bare (saith S. Bede) such loue and af∣fection lib. 4. cap. 5. to the Apostolike Sea of Rome, as if he might haue eskaped his sicknes, he pur∣posed to goe to Rome, and to end his life in those holie places there.
But what he could not through death performe, the valiant Prince King Cedwalla did in the very flour K. Cedualla. An. 689. of his age and prosperity. For in the yeare 689. forsaking his kingdome (saith S. Beda) he vvent to Rome, thinking it to Beda lib. 5. c. 7. be a singular glory, and renovvme for him to be regenerated vvith the Sacrament of Baptisme at the Sea Apostolicke. And
 vvithal conceaued hope, that as soone as by baptisme he vvas cleansed from sinne, he should depart from this vvorld to immortal ioy. VVhich by Gods prouidence was perfourmed, and he honourablie bu∣ried by the Pope in S. Peters Church. Not long after him, to wit in the year 709. two English Kings Coenred and K. Coenred and Offa. 709. Offa forsooke their kingdomes, went to Rome, and there became Moncks, Lib. 5. cap. 10. Baron. 709. Huntingt. l. 4. p. 337. Mal∣mesb. 1. reg. c. 6. Marian. chro.

Hun succes∣sor to K. Cedwal in his kingdome, suc∣ceeded him also in his deuotion to the Sea Apostolike, for after he had raigned (saith S. Beda) 37. years he gaue ouer his kingdome, & vvent him selfe to the tombs and monuments of the Apostles in Rome, as in those daies many English both of the Nobility and Commons, spiritual and tem∣poral men and vvoemen vvere vvont to doe vvith great emulation. Neither went he only to Rome, but became there a Monke, and was the first that paied the Peter pence, appointing that euery
 householder of his kingdome, who English Se∣minary in Rome al∣most 900. years agoe. had thirty peny worth of Cattel of one sort, should pay yearlie one penny to Rome: which money was partlie for the P. partlie for the maintenance of an English schoole or Seminary which VVestmon. A. 727. 794. he then built in Rome for bringing vp of English youths there in vertue and learning.
Not long after about the 750. yeare S. Richard K. forsooke his kingdome, S. Richard K. A. 750. Sur. 7. Fe∣bruar. Ba∣ron. 750. & leauing his two sonnes in Germany with S.

 succeeded, so they followed them in their piety and religion. For beside that they paid the Peeter pence, in par∣ticular K. william Conqueror hauing K. VV. Con∣queror. An. 1066.

Henry 1. professed by his Embassadour to P. Paschal 2. that England was a peculiar prouince of the Church of Rome, and paid vnto her yearlie tribute. King Henry 2. about the yeare K. Henry 2. An. 1180. Genebr. in chron. 1180. 1180. together with Lewis King of France ledde P. Alexanders horse, and with great pompe conducted him K. Richard 1. Polid. lib. 14. Genebr. 118. Stovv. through the Citty Tociacum. K. Ri∣chard Ceur de Lion at the exhorta∣tion of the P. went in person to the holy land, with an army of 30. thow∣sand foote, and fiue thowsand horse: in which voiage he conquered the kingdome of Ciprus, & citty of Pto∣lemais, and ouerthrew the Souldan in a great battel; and the like enterprise afterward vndertooke K. Edward the K. Henry 2. An. 1241. Stovv An. 1241. first in the yeare 1241. King Henry 3.
 placed the Popes Legate in the most honourable roome of the table at a publique banquet in Christ-masse be∣twixt him selfe and the Archebishop of yorke: And afterward vvith great pompe (saith Stowe) and innumerable company of Nobles, and trumpets sounding before, brought him to the Sea. How de∣uout K. Richard 2. and Englishmen K. Richard 2. Stovv An. 1407. in his time were to the Sea of Rome, appeareth by their building an hospi∣tal there, for receit of English Pilgrims (insteed of the foresaid Seminary which as it seemeth was destroyed in that great burning of Rome in the yeare 1084) in the place where S. Tho∣mas of Canturbury had before built a chappel in honor of the B. Trinity. This hospital was afterward in the raigne of K. Henry 6. and Henry 7. reedified, and much encreased, and lastlie in the yeare 1570, was much bewtifyed and augmented both in buildings and reuenews by P. Gregory 13. and by him conuerted to the aun∣cient vse of a Seminary, retayning stil
 the obligation of an hospital.
The affection of K. Henry 4. ap∣peareth K. Henry 4. A. 1409. Stovv Ann. 1409. by his letter to the Pope A. 1409. which he beginneth thus. Most holy father our humble recommendations in filial vvise premised. And afterward, ha∣uing taken vvith our said sonne, and also vvith our Prelats and Nobles mature deli∣beration, vve beseech vvith al humility & require your clemency (vvhose state and honor vpon diuers causes as a deuout sonne of the Church so far as vve might vvith God, vve haue euer embraced and do em∣brace) by the expresse and vvhole assent of the estates aforesaid &c. And as for King Henry 5. he in the yeare 1416. sent his K. Henry 5. An. 1416. Stovv Ann. 1416. Embassadors to the general Councel at Constance, at whose procurement it vvas there ordained that England (saith Note this. Stowe) should obtaine the name of a nation & be said one of the fiue Nations that ovve their deuotiō to the Church of Rome, vvhich thing vntil that time men of other Nations for enuie had letted. Behould what an honor K. Henry 5. the Alexander of England, and Conqueror of France,
 and England in his most florishing & triumphant time, accounted it to owe deuotion to the Church of Rome. VVhich now Ministers would accoūt so dishonourable. And as for K. Henry K. Henry 7. An. 1505. 7. your Maiesties great grandfather, his affection is euident by the sword and cup of maintenance sent to him from the Pope, & spoken of before.
But none of the kings of the Nor∣man bloud euer shewed so great signes of loue & affection to the Sea Aposto∣like as K. Henry 8. did for a long time K. Heury 8. A. 1511. 1521. Stovv 1511. 1512. 1513. O∣nuphr. in Iul. 2. for first in the yeare 1511. he wrate to the French K. to desist from molesting Pope Iulius 2. and in the next yeare sent an army of ten thousand men into France for the Popes defence. And in the yeare 1513. wēt him selfe in person with a royal army & conquered Tur∣win and Turnay. And not content to defend the Pope with his sword, in the yeare 1521. wrate an excellēt booke Stovv An. 1521. in his defence against Luther. And againe in the yeare. 1527. when Pope Clement 7. was taken prisoner by the
 Emperors souldiers, he gaue moneth∣lie Stovv An. 1532. 60. thowsand Angels to the main∣tenance of an armie, for the Popes de∣liuery. And in this singular affection towards the Sea Apostolik contine∣wed he vntil the 22. yeare of his raigne Stovv 1530. & deinceps. An. 1530. when not vpon any iniury offered by the P. or dislike of his reli∣gion, which (except the matter of su∣premacy) he defended to his death, and persecuted the Protestants, but only vpon occasion of delaie (saith Stowe) made by the Pope in his controuersie of de∣uorcement, and through displeasure of such reports, as he he ard had bene made of him to the court of Rome, and thirdlie pricked forvvards by such counsellers to follovv the example of the Germanes, he first forbad the procurement of any thing from Rome, and soone after prohibited al payments and appeales to Rome, and lastlie tooke vpon him that supremacy which al his Christian predecessors had acknowledged to be in the Pope.
Thus your Maiestie seeth how long,
 how honourablie, and how profitablie also vnto both parties, hath the mu∣tual amity and league of friendship, betwixt the Sea Apost. and the Prin∣ces of al the foure Nations, that haue swaied the Scepter of England conti∣newed and flourished: & how of late it was broken by one Prince vpon meere passion, contrary to the example of al his Predecessors and Successors also, except one childe and a woeman. VVhat dangers and troubles he and his kingdome incurred thereby, and how his progeny (according as Frier Poeto did then foretel him) is now consumed, and his Crowne transla∣ted to an other Royal lyne, against which in his time he made sharpe war, I need not here declare. Only I wil say, that him selfe being after more free from passion, laboured to be re∣conciled to the Sea Apostolike and employed therein B. Gardener (as he professed in a sermon at Paules Crosse) and had easelie obtained it, if he would haue acknowledged his
 fault and done penance. VVhat re∣maineth for me to conclude this long epistle, but prostrate at your Ma∣iesties feet humblie to beseech you for your owne good, and in the name of the foresaid Christian Princes, that as you are the head of the fieft Na∣tion, which (according to Gods pro∣uidence foretolde by a holy man Hunting. l. 6. p. 359. many hundred years agoe) hath attai∣ned to the rule of this land, so you would continew that most auncient, honourable, and proffitable league of friendship, which was betwixt them al and the Sea Apostolicke; who (I beseech your grace) wil giue you more faithful councel, then your owne Progenitors and forefathers? who can giue you more safe and se∣cure directiō in gouernement of your kingdome, then your owne Prede∣cessors, who soe happily, and so long time gouerned it? who are so worthie to giue you example, or whom can you with so much honor imitate, as so many, so valiant, so prudent Prin∣ces?
 and yet they al with one voice, counsel and request you, to follow in this so importāt a matter, not so much them selues, as the councel of the wisest King that euer was, yea of God himselfe in these words. Thine ovvne Prouerb. 27. friend and thy fathers friend see thou for∣sake not, especiallie such a one, as hath euer bene not only your owne friend, and particularly your B. mothers friend, but of al your Christian fore∣fathers. VVho as they haue lefte vnto your grace their Crowne and king∣dome; so haue they also bequeathed their faith religion & friendship with the Sea Apostolick, as no smal portion and stay of their inheritance. VVe e∣stieme your publique acknowledging of Rome to be the Mother Church, and your selfe to be behoulding to P. Clement 8. for his temporal cariadge and kinde offices, as sparks of a greater fyer of loue inkindled in your Princely hart towards that Sea, which we be∣seech almighty God so to increase, as it may one day burst forth to your
 owne good, and the vniuersal ioy of Christendome. Our Lord Iesus long preserue your Maiestie with al grace, health, and prosperity
