HEavens potent Champion; our times Hanibal!
Cesar, his Trophies, must to Yours, let fall.
Such Praise, and Triumphs do adorn your Fame,
That forraign Countries tremble at your Name.
Great Atlas of our Orbe! whose armed Might,
And power o're Minds, can both the Poles affright;
The World, and Kingdoms fear! What more? brave Souls
Their Prayses with contracted brows controuls.
If my poor Muse, born in a Northern Clime,
Disturbe your Lawrell, pardon (Sir) the crime;
You, who alone (like Phaebus) vigour give,
Inspire me with your beams, and I shall live.
Shall I (Great CHARLES) be banisht from Your sight,
Whose Clemency all things to You invite?
Draw in Your Glories, whilst I sing Your Praise,
Least my Muse perish by Your God-like Rayes.
