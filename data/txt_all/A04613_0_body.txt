YOUR great loue and fauour Honorable Syr, euer manifested to all worthy Scien∣ces, hath imboldened me to offer vppe at your Lordships Shryne, these the vn∣worthie labours of my musicall trauels. And though in respect of their weake∣nes, they may perhaps seeme vntimely brought forth, and therefore the vnlikeli∣er to prosper; yet doubt I not but if tenderd by you, they shall happelie find gentle cherishing, which may be a meane to make them more stronger, or else miscarrying, to encourage my en∣deuours to beget a better: for as no arts wincks at fewer errors than musicke: so none greater enimies to their owne profession then musicians; who whilst in their own singularitie, they con∣demne euery mans workes, as some waie faulty, they are the cause, the art is the lesse esteemed, and they themselues reputed as selfe-commenders, and men most fantasticall. Wherefore if this one censuring infirmitie were remoued, these my ayres (free I dare say from grosse errours) would finde euery where more gratious entertainement. But since euen those, who are best seene in this art, cannot vaunt themselues free from such detractours, I the lesse regard it being so well accompanied. Howsoeuer if herein I may gaine your Honors good allowance, I shall thinke I have attained to the better ende of my labours (which with my self, and the best of my seruice) restes euer more at your Lordships imploiment.
