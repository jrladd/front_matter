SIrs in aduising Tutors of their Dutie, least I should be thought vnaduised in my owne—ipse semipaganus
Ad sacra vatū carmē affero nostrū. I offer this book in particular, (accord∣ing to the ancient custome of Aegypt) as vnto the two most skilful and iudicious Censors of this Art. I pre∣sent it, as Apelles and Policletus did their pictures & images, holding the pincel and pincers as yet in my hād. to add, change, or clip away what you Iudg expedient, Your  or  shalbe an advertisment to me not to faile hereafter in the like case▪ as your approbation may bee an incouragment to attempt some higher disseing, wherby I maie better testifie my zeale towards those, of whom you merit to be esteemed as Homer was of King Ptolomie and Frontinus the Philosopher of M. Antonius the Emperour.
