WHen the Grecians in a great solemnity presented to Phillip of Macedon many goodly giftes, a poore Painter stept in a∣mong the rest, and offered vp the counterfeit of him∣self in a table, beside which were portrayed out many iewells & pearles, and rings; ouer each whereof was inscribed; Vellem & hoc; J protest it sir vnfainedly your late kindenes, your courteous offer hath so ouer∣come me, as I must needs present somewhat, and be∣cause that in so great variety as the world affordeth my slender ability cā shape out nothing worth the gi∣uing, I haue assaid to gratulate you with a shadow, assuring you that if there be any thing more worthy your VVorships acceptation Vellem & hoc; neuer∣thelesse because I hope that at a Painters hand a pic∣ture wil be accepted, & that there is a Decorum in it that euery man should present a taste of his owne trade, I thought good to offer vp to your VVorship this short treatise, the fruites of a schollers study, which if it shall please you to reade ouer, J haue ob∣tained a peece of mine end: Loath J was to display my selfe to the world, but for that J hope to daunce vnder a maske, and bluster out like the winde, which

though euery man heareth, yet none can in sight des∣crie, J was content for once to become odious, that is, to speake in print, that such as vse to carpe at they know not what, may for once likewise condemne they know not whome, and yet I doo not so accuse the rea∣ders, as if all writers were faultles, for why? VVe liue in a printing age, wherein there is no man either so vainely, or factiously, or filthily disposed, but there are crept out of all sorts vnauthorized au∣thors, to fill and fit his humor, and if a mans deuoti∣on serue him not to goe to the Church of GOD, he neede but repayre to a Stationers shop and reade a sermon of the diuels: I loath to speake it, euery red∣nosed rimester is an author, euery drunken mans dreame is a booke, and he whose talent of little wit is hardly worth a farthing, yet layeth about him so outragiously, as if all Helicon had run through his pen, in a word, scarce a cat can looke out of a gutter, but out starts a half peny Chronicler, and presently A propper new ballet of a strange sight is endi∣ted: VVhat publishing of friuolous and scurrilous Prognostications? as if VVill Sommers were againe reuiued: what counterfeiting and cogging of prodigi∣ous and fabulous monsters? as if they labored to ex∣ceede the Poet in his Metamorphosis; what lasci∣uious, vnhonest, and amorous discourses, such as Au∣gustus in a heathen common wealth could neuer to∣lerate?

& yet they shame not to subscribe, By a gra∣duate in Cambridge; In Artibus Magister; as if men should iudge of the fruites of Art by the ragges and parings of wit, and endite the Vniuersi∣ties, as not onely accessary to their vanitie, but nur∣ses of bawdry; we would the world should know, that howsoeuer those places haue power to create a Ma∣ster of Artes, yet the art of loue is none of the seauen; and be it true that Honos alit artes, yet small ho∣nor is it to be honored for such artes, nor shal he car∣ry the price that seasoneth his profit with such a sweete; It is the complaint of our age, that men are wanton and sick of wit, with which (as with a loath∣some potion in the stomack) they are neuer well till all be out. They are the Pharisees of our time, they write al, & speak al, and do al, vt audiantur ab ho∣minibus; or to tel a plaine truth plainely, it is with our hackney authors, as with Oyster-wiues, they care not how sweetely, but how loudely they cry, and cō∣ming abroad, they are receaued as vnsauory wares, men are faine to stop their noses, and crie; Fie vpon this wit; thus affecting to bee famous, they become notorious, that it may be saide of them as of the So∣phisters at Athens: dum volunt haberi celebri∣ter docti innotescunt insigniter asinini, & when with shame they see their folly, they are faine to put on a mourning garment, and crie, Farwell. Jf any

man bee of a dainty and curious eare, J shall desire him to repayre to those authors; euery man hath not a Perle-mint, a Fish-mint, nor a Bird-mint in his braine, all are not licensed to create new stones, new Fowles, new Serpents, to coyne new creatures; for my selfe, J know J shall be eloquent enough, I shal be an Orator good enough if J can perswade, which to be the end and purpose of my heart, he knoweth who knoweth my heart: if your VVorship shall demaund why J published this pamphlet vnder the name of Martine, I must tell you, because I purposed for once to play the Martine: if you aske what Martine is, I must desire you to Etymologize, and you shall pick his nature out of his name, the first sillable whereof implying of it selfe to Mar, and being he added with a Tine, the murdering end of a forke, it must needes be that Mar-tine being truely spelled and put toge∣ther, signifieth such a one as galleth and pricketh men to death, but this difference is betweene the great Martine & my self, that wheras he most vnnatural∣ly laid siege against his natiue soyle, & spent his pow∣der vpon his owne countrey walles, J haue pickt me out a forreine aduersary, a common enemy to play vpon, whome the great sheapheard of the sheepe, as a capital consumer and wolfe in his flock, shall in his good time confounde and destroy. Amen.
