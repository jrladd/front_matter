May it please Your Grace,
I Have here attempted an Expli∣cation of that part of our Church-Catechism which respects the Decalogue or Ten Command∣ments: Not out of any great opinion of mine own Abilities for such an undertaking, of which they, who know me, know me to be sufficiently dif∣fident; but out of a due sense of the want of a just Discourse upon this Argument, which by no Man that I know of hath been handled according to its worth.
It was once in my thoughts to have suppressed it, till I could have finished an Explication of the
whole Catechism, as conceiving that that would have been more compleat, and more acceptable to the World. But considering with my self that it would require some time to revise what I have alrea∣dy done, and much more to add to and perfect it; and since what is now offered to Your Grace, and, with Your Graces Leave, to the Publick view also, is entire enough, if I have acquitted my self in it as I ought: I thought I should no way disoblige my Readers, if I sent this part of it before the rest to try the Judgment of the World. Especially since it is not impossible, but that I may entertain a better opi∣nion of my own Labours, than they shall be found by more competent Judges to deserve.
If any thing may seem with Reason to make such a procedure improper, it is, that I have referr'd my self to those Parts that are not yet published, for the proof of some things asserted here. But as it is on∣ly for such things as have been abundantly proved by others, and which therefore, especially in loco non suo, I might the better wave the confirmation of; so they are for the most part, if not only, such, as by the Laws of Discourse are to be supposed by all that will entreat of this Argument. However, if what is now tendred find acceptance, that blot shall not long lye upon it; and if not, the imperfectness there∣of will be the most pardonable quality of my Dis∣course, or at least will be more excusable than my troubling the World with more.
In this Treatise I have endeavoured, out of that heap which so copious a subject presents, to select such matter as is most considerable and pertinent; to de∣liver my sense concerning it in proper and intelligible expressions; and lastly, to confirm that by solid
Reasons. For other things I have not been much sollicitous, and much less, as Solomon speaks, to find out acceptable words, as conceiving such more pro∣per to perswade than inform, which is or ought to be the Design of an Explication.
If any taking occasion from this rude Discourse of mine shall oblige the World with a more perfect one, he shall find me among the foremost to return him thanks for it: Both because of the benefit I shall reap in common with others from it, and also because I shall have the satisfaction of considering, that, if I have not been my self so fortunate in Explaining the Ten Commandments, yet I have stirred up those that are, and thereby have fulfilled a Commandment, the observation whereof is of more advantage than the most accurate Explication of them all.
In the mean time as I hope these my Labours will not be altogether unuseful, so I lay them at Your Grace's feet, as a Recognition of those many favours You have been pleased to confer upon me, and of that Duty I owe to the Church of England; for the safe-guard whereof, as Your Grace hath with great prudence and conduct happily presided, in an Age wherein You have met with more than ordinary Discouragements; so that God will still preserve Your Grace for the farther benefit thereof, is the hearty Prayer of
