My Lords,
IT is the Design of Hea∣ven to pull down the pride of all flesh, and to have the Lord alone Exalted, that no flesh might glory before him, but all
 that glory, may do it in the Lord God, they being the Lords; For the day of the Lord is come upon all flesh to destroy it like grasse, but the Word of the Lord abides for ever, and he that is built up∣on that Rock the gates of hell can never prevail against him; though the Lord cometh to shake terribly the Earth and the Heavens also, yea though the mountains and hils re∣move out of their places; though the stars fall from heaven, and the Sun be turned into darkness, and the Moon into blood, by this ter∣rible Earthquake, yet, the founda∣tion of God stands sure, their Sun never sets, nor their Moon changes; For the Lord himself is their ever∣lasting Light, and thy God their
 glory: And though the fashion of this world perisheth, waxing old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt thou change them, yet thy Kingdome is an everlasting King∣dome, O God, and thy Dominion throughout all ages; thou changest not, but art the same to day, yester∣day, and forever: thou shalt raign till thou hast made this world be∣come the Kingdomes of our Lord Jesus Christ and of his Saints, and great shall be the day of the Lord.
My Lords, I could doe no less then recommend this new born babe unto You, which hath been brought forth in sorrow, and much weakness of flesh, though in the wil∣lingness of spirit, the Lord gives it his grace and blessing, that it may be
 growing up in you in strength and power, which shall be the joy and desire of

From my Quarters in Black-Fryers, Mr Delaines, February 8. 1648.
