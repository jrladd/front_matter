SIR,
IT is the vsuall manner of Men, whom GOD hath blest with the goods of Fortune, when Death summons them to leaue the world, with all their wealth, they are then ous and carefull how to dispose of that

which they cannot carrie with them. Then they call for Cou to aduise them in the drawing of their last Wills and Testaments, bequeathing large  or to their Children, Kinsfolke and best respected Friends, to re∣mayne as a future testimonie of their boun∣ties: But if fareth not so with mee; I must say with poore Bias, Onid  mcum prto I am now creeping into my Graue, and am freed from that care, how to dispose of my worldly estate. But I feare that my disabilitie will leaue some staine of Ingratitude vpon mee, when I dead; that I haue left no testimonie of my thankfulnesse to so worthy a friend as your selfe, from whom I haue receiued so many fa∣uours. To make any reall satisfaction, I can∣not, neither doe you need it. Yet to free my selfe (in some sort) of this imputation of in∣gratitude, I haue be  you  Legacie, the last of y aid s. I hope you will giue it acceptance and counte∣nance it for your owne, whoe you may at your best leisure (without any labour, trauell, or expences) enter into the great Turk's S∣raglio or Court, and there ta suruay of the life, lusts, reuenewes, power, gou, and tyranny of that great Ottoman. I bequeath it

you as a testimonie of my thankfulnes when I am gone. If you make it your recreation af∣ter more serious affaires, I hope you will re∣ceiue some content, to reade the State of the proudest and most powerfull Monarch of the World. If it please you, I shall thinke my selfe very happy, hauing performed this last dutie. And will euer rest,
