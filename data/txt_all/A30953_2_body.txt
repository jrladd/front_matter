THe care thy Father once bestow'd on Me,
I very gladly would return to Thee.
What I to Thee (thus love in a blood runs)
Doe thou communicate unto my Sons.
I have no land to give, such is my Chance:
Take this Poeticall inheritance.
A little here is best: because much more
Of Poetry, perhaps would make you poore.
