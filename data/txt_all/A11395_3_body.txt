ARms yield to Arts: the Trumpet to the Tongue:
Stout Aiax Prize the wise Vlysses wann▪
It will not seem then▪ that we haue mis-sung,
To sing of CAPTAINS to a Counsail -man:
Sith, without Counsail, Courage is but rage;
Rude in Resolving, rash in Acting it:
In which respect, those of the Antique Age
Fain PALLAS Goddess both of Warr and Wit:
Therfore, to Thee, whose Wit so much hath sted
(In Warr and Peace) our Princes and our STATE:
To Thee (whose Vertue hath now Triumphed
Of cause-les Enuy, and misgrounded Hate:
To Thee (Witt's- WORTHIE) had it not bin wrong,
Not to haue sounded my War- WORTHIE's Song?
