HOly and beloved, Although I have de∣signed this little Treatise for publick and common benefit, yet considering that I am to you a debtor not only in common Cha∣rity, but by reason of special Bonds which the Lord hath laid upon me to you-ward, I could do no less, (being driven from you in presence, not affection) but first present you with this little Book; not for that you are wanting in the things contained herein, but to put you again in remembrance of first things, and to give you occasion to present something to your carnal relations that may
 be (if God will) for their awakening and conversion; accept it therefore as a token of my Christian Remembrance of you.
Next, I present it to all those unconvert∣ed, old and young, who have been at any time under my Preaching, and yet remain in their sins: And I entreat them also that they receive it as a token of my love to their immortal Souls; yea, I charge them as they will answer it in the day of the terrible judg∣ment, that they read, ponder, and receive this wholsom Medicine prepared for them. Now the God of Blessing bless it to the awa∣kening of many sinners, and the salvation of their souls by faith in Jesus Christ. Amen.
