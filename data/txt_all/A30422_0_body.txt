Most Honoured,
AS I was invited by you to Preach
this Sermon, so I am now deter∣mined
by your Desires to Print
it: and do esteem it a great ho∣nour,
that I was made choice of
by you, to do at once both a great
Iustice to the Dead, and I hope some good to the
Living, at least, by that part of it which relates to
your Worthy Father.

Excellent Patterns afford great Instruction: and
it is the more necessary to propose them to the Imita∣tion
of others, in an Age in which, while we are
disputing so hotly about Opinions and Forms, the
Power and Life of Religion is like to wear out of
the World: and so few instances of it appear, that
no wonder Atheists take great advantages from thence,
to perswade their weak and lewd followers, that none
believe inwardly what they outwardly profess: and
upon this account, we have great reason to make
the most we can of all those living arguments that
have been among us of the efficacy and amiableness of
true Religion.
When I received from you some informations con∣cerning
your dead Father, I perceived your chief de∣sign
was, to have only so much told of him, as
might preserve a just character of him to posterity;
and particularly, for those descended from him: so
as it might either engage them to follow his steps and
imitate his Vertues; or remain as a witness against
them, if they should decline from that good way which
he both living and dying, has so earnestly recom∣mended
to you and them. But I found you had no
mind to have his praises raised to any indecent
pitch, or to have any thing said, that savoured of
vanity; but that his Funeral Sermon should be as
free from these, as his Life was; and that it

should so far resemble him, as that it should be all to
edification, and therefore that nothing should be put
in it for pomp or shew. In this, your inclinations
agreeing so much with my own, it was easie for
me, to observe this part of your desires very exactly:
and I was very glad to find most of the Hearers
agreed with me in that which in the beginning of his
Character I say I expected from them; that they
would think I had rather said too little, than too
much.
I hope he shall still live in you all, and that you
shall happily reverse the Fable of the multiplication
of the Hydra's head, seven shooting out, for one
that was cut off; so I am confident that we shall have
now in you, seven Heirs to your Fathers Vertues and
true Piety, and that every one of you will with a ge∣nerous,
yet kind emulation, study who shall come
nearest that shining example which he set you: for
which you shall never want the Prayers of,
