My Lord,
THis Translation of the Se∣cond Volume of Father Malebranch's Recherche de la Ve∣rite, Humbly begs the same Fa∣vourable Acceptance and Prote∣ction, as Your Lordship was pleased to grant the First: Nor could I have any Temptation to seek another Patron for it, either in respect of the Author or my Self. Every one that has had the
Honour to know Your Lordship, is very Sensible that You have Successfully Studied Mankind in General, and are therefore a very good Judge of this Subject. As for my Self, Your Lordships preventing Goodness, and ex∣tream readiness to serve me, has already outdone the utmost Am∣bition of,
My Lord,
