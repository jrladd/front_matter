MY Lord, knowing my selfe much bounden vnto your Lordship, for vndeserued fauour some yeares past by your Lordship extended in my behalfe: in consideration whereof, hitherto J haue not had any possibilitie to manifest my desire to doe your Lordship some agreeable seruice: but almost euer since vnable for the Warres, or other forraine employment, haue remained in this Citie: where encountring many bookes treating of sundrie subiects, one compiled by an Jtalian Gentleman, translated into the French tongue, and dedicated to the Duke de Ioyense, came to my hands, containing sundrie discour∣ses of Princes, Common-wealths, Chieftians in
Warres and others, collected out of seuerall Au∣thors, but chiefely out of Guicciardin. Which seeing it hath with good acceptance passed among those two Nations, J presumed could not be but well intertained among our Countrey men, for whose benefite, J attempted to set it out of French into our vulgar tongue. And as it was my fortune many yeares since, first to beare Armes vnder your Lordships leading and commaund in the Warres: so this being the first fruite of my la∣bour with my pen, J humbly present vnto your Lordship; beseeching the same to accept thereof, as a pledge of the honour, loue, and dutie which J owe, vntill it shall please God to inable me to make better shew thereof. J meane not herein to be vnderstoode to presume to prescribe any rules or precepts for your Lordshippe to fol∣low, whose wisdome, learning and experience is well knowne sufficient to compile any volume of farre greater experience: But if that by your Lordships censure, this may passe for currant, J rest assured that it will be generallie well accepted, and nothing doubt, but that many thereby may reape profit, and therein finde fit aduertisements to learne them by other mens harmes to beware, and examples to imitate, which if it so happen, J shall
holde my time and labour well employed. If the stile please not as J desire, J intreate to be held the more excused, seeing it is my first fault herein, and also seeing that in former time it hath bin the least part of my profession: but if I euer hereafter vndertake the like taske, J will, God willing, indeuour to make amends. And so humbly beseeching your Lord∣ship to pardon this my presumption, praying to God for the long continuance of your health, increase of all worldly honour, and perpetuall felicitie in the world to come: J rest euer
