Gentlemen,
TO you, whose Zeale is great and wise, for the perfection of Christs Church, I present my Meditations. To you, whose
 Pietie is reall and constant, I Dedicate my Ejaculations. If you esteem them as they are, good (though perhaps weake) helps, for mans spirituall growth, you shall receive them courteously, reade them judici∣ously, and earnestly commend them to your Wives, Children, Friends and Servants; prai∣sing, praying the Lord, for his past and future mercies to me

London, No∣vemb. 5. 1647.
