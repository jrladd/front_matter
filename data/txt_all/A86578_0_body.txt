Right Honourable:
THe Devil hath had a double Design about this business of the Gunpowder-Treason; the First was to blow up the Parliament, the Second is to blow up the Deliverance, and to make it appear less to the World than indeed it is. It is true, I will not deny, but that as Cor∣ruption will be sure to be at the end of every Action, so there might be possibly some Politique advantages made of the Discovery of this Plot, by some which had then the ma∣naging of present Affairs; but that is no Disparagement at all to the Mercy it self, nor excuse to those which were Instruments in the Conspiracy. The Danger was unque∣stionable, and the Preservation very remarkable, and such as we have All cause very deeply to lay to heart, with the fullest resentment that may be. The scope of this plain Sermon is a little to help us herein, which I have now at the last by your Order (not of mine own inclination, nay indeed with some reluctancies in my self) brought to the publique Light, but in a desire of the publique Good. I
have purposedly deferred it to this Time for the publishing of it, that so, as the thing it self was as the beginning of a New Life, so the Discourse about it might fall in with the New Year, wherein our Lives are in a manner restored and renewed unto us. Besides that, the time of Printing it might somewhat answer the time of Preaching it, which was New-Year in the Calendar of the City, as it is now in the Calendar of the World. And lastly, That as the Deliverance is a Monument of Gods goodness to the Na∣tion, so the Sermon might be a Testimony of mine own respects and thankfulness to your selves in the injoyment, and likewise continuance of so much favour and incourage∣ment from you, as I am still partaker of. I have this only to adde, That the Lord who keepeth Israel, and who alone is the safety of his people, would delight still to watch over this City for good, to make the Walls of it Salvation, and the Gates of it Praise, and the Officers of it Peace; to establish Holiness and Righteousness within the borders, and in the midst of it, that it may prove an eternal excel∣lency, and the joy of many Generations, which is and shall be the prayer of
Gresham-Colledge January 1. 1655/4.
