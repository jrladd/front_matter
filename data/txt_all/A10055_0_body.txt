MOST Gratious PRINCE, my vowed Annuall service to the memory of your blessed Brother craveth your shel∣ter; for, vnder the shadow of your Princely Cedar, I hū∣bly desire to spende my daies. Not only the praise of the dead, but also the profit of the living be my inducements to this worke; both which I hope, wilbe acceptable arguments to your Highnesse. I am encouraged the rather herevnto, because I see your Princely spirit dare looke death in the face, and can be content to hear, that as your renowmed bro∣ther's fortunes, so his fate also shall one day be yours. Many, and happy be your Highnesse daies, that you may so long continue in the world, as the world shall continue; that goodnesse may guide, and Religion may guard you, both which will assure more safety to your precious
soule, then the Prevention of the world, and pre∣sumption of the Court can afford you: for these will sanctifie the Circumspection of the wise in helping you, and terrifie the Circumvention of the wicked from hurting you. So shall your Highnes remember your Creator in the daies of your youth, and walke in the pathes of A∣braham before God, till you come to the pas∣sage of Henoch to walk with God. In the mean time the great Palmoni the numbrer of times make your daies as happy as the daies of He¦noch, whose yeares were as many as the yearly daies of the sunne: that in your felicity, you may ride on prosperously because of truth, of meeke∣nesse and righteousnes; and having ended your course in Grace you may begin never to end in glory. Which is the dayly praier of your Highnesse most observant servant
 Ex. Coll.Novemb. 6. the fatall day of Prince HENRIES decease.
