IT pleased your Ho∣nour to fauour me both at, and since my wayting on my Lord and mai∣ster, the Earle of Leycester in the Courte, I doe not forget your goodnes to me, and I thanke God very heartily, for your Honourable both care of, and affe∣ction to Gods Churche and religi∣on. It is very cleere, that many are as friendlye to Gods trueth and Church, as the East winde is to the fruites of the earth: I neede not re∣member
 particulers, for there are so greate store, and (as it were) swarmes of such, that if almighty GOD did not bridle them, as hee did Sanballat, the Arrabians, and the Ammonites in Nehemias time, and rayse vp excellent personages for the rearing vp of his Churche nowe, as hee did Ezra, Nehemi∣as, Zorobabel, and Iehoshua, af∣ter the captiuitie of Babylon, Gods Church shoulde goe to wracke, and Religion shoulde bee handeled like a ward. But Gods Church is aliue, (thankes bee to GOD) howsoe∣uer wicked men doe make it eyther a faire marke to shoote at, or a dead carcase to feede vppon, and will outliue and outcountenance all eni∣mies whatsoeuer. Almightie God to that ende hath blessed this noble Land in our time with an excellente Prince of our owne nation, (as he
 did the Iewes with Zorobabel af∣ter the captiuitie) and with ma∣nye notable personages vnder her Highnesse (as hee did the Israelites with Eliachim vnder Ezechias the king of Iuda.) Amongest whiche excellent personages, because your Honours place is greate in respect of the trust whiche is committed to you, and that GOD hath moued you to fauour mee, I doe present vnto you these my Treatises of the Churche, and against Oppression, as a sure argument of my duetifull mynde. My meaning is not to set downe the seuerall poyntes of this Booke, it were a needelesse labour, and you haue it in your handes to reade at your good pleasure and lea∣sure.
Thus with my heartie pray∣er to Almightye GOD for the in∣crease of his good giftes in your
 Honour, I take my leaue in most humble manner.
