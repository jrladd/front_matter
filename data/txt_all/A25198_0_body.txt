My Lord,
I Have adventured on your Lordships accep∣tance by guess; if pre∣sumption has led me into an Error that deserves cor∣rection, I heartily beg In∣dempnity, and resolve to repent soundly for it, and do so no more. VVhat I present I know to be true, Experientia docet; It being

an infallible Maxim, That there is no Globe like the occu∣lar and experimental view of a Countrey. And had not Fate by a necessary imploy∣ment, confin'd me within the narrow walks of a four years Servitude, and by de∣grees led me through the most intricate and dubious paths of this Countrey, by a commanding and unde∣niable Enjoynment, I could not, nor should I ever have undertaken to have written a line of this nature.
If I have wrote or com∣posed any thing that's wilde and confused, it is because I am so my self, and the world, as far as I can per∣ceive, is not much out of the same trim; therefore I resolve, if I am brought to the Bar of Common Law for any thing I have done here, to plead Non compos men∣tis, to save my Bacon.
There is an old Saying in English, He must rise betimes that would please every one. And I am afraid I have lain

so long a bed, that I think I shall please no body; if it must be so, I cannot help it. But as Felton in his Resolves says, In things that must be, 'tis good to be resolute; And therefore what Destiny has ordained, I am resolved to wink, and stand to it. So leaving your Honour to more serious meditations, I subscribe my self,
My Lord,
