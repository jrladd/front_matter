MY LORD,
I Pretend not to do Honour to Your Sacred Character by the little Ad∣dress of an obscure Writer, but by representing Your Lordship to the World as treading in the glorious steps of antient Saints, Martyrs and Bishops, Your great Predecessors in the Govern∣ment of the Church of God.
When busie Ignorants are doing their Fathers Work, and scattering their Tares among the good Seed of Evange∣lical
 Truth, it's time for those in Your Lordship's station not only to Counte∣nance those who oppose encroaching Error, but to scatter these Midnight Workers with a just severity, and to frown effectually on such as the most condescending Laws have thought fit to exclude from any interest in them.
That Your Lordship's Sentiments are agreeable to Mine, I conclude from Your declar'd Willingness to accept so small a Present; yet small as it is, it's offer'd with the greatest Affection to our Holy Mother the establish'd Church of England, which that it may recover it's pristine Lustre in spite of all the ma∣lignant influences of Heresie or Schism, and Your Lordship live long as its Zea∣lous Supporter, is the hearty Prayer of,
MY LORD,
