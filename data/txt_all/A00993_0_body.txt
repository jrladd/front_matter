Right Honourable,
I Am bolde to present to your Honour a
short contemplation of those Herbes, (cut
in rough pieces) which grow really and
plentifully in your owne Garden: and
giue so good nourishment to your vertues,
delightfull taste to the Church, and odo∣riferous
sauour to all; that, like the Vine
in Iothams Parable, they cheare the heart of both God & man.
Your Honour, I now, cannot dislike that in sight, which you
so preserue in sense, and (for a happy reward) doth and shall
preserue you. You are zealously honour'd of all those that know
goodnesse; and haue dayly as many prayers, as the earth
Saints. Into this number I haue (hopfully presuming) thrust
myselfe; as loth to bee hindmost in that acknowledgement,
which is so nobly deserued, and so ioyfully rendred of al tongues:
dedicating to your Honour some publicke deuotions, that can

neuer forget you in my priuate. I will not thinke of adding
one Herbe to your store: I onely desire to remember your Ho∣nour
what hand planted them, what dew waters them, what
influence conserues, and enspheares a sweet prouident ayre a∣bout
them: and when gay weedes, that shoote vp like Ionas
gourd in a night, shall wither in an houre, (for moriuntur,
quomodo oriuntur) Your Herbe of Grace shall flourish &
be prays'd, both ob eminentiam, and permanentiam; and
at last bee transported into that heauenly Paradise, whence it
receiues the originary roote and being. Your Honour will ex∣cuse
mee for coupling to a Diuine Herball, a Forrest of
Thornes; by a true obseruation in both materiall and mystical
Gardens, though a Poet records it.
Terra salutiferas herbas, eadernque nocentes
Nutrit, et vrticae proxima soepe rosa est.
Your Honour will loue the light better, because the darke
night followes so neare it, That your Sunne may neuer set,
your noble Garden neuer wither; that your honours may bee
still multiplied with our most Royall and Religious King on
earth, and with the King of Kings in heauen; is faithfully
prayed for by
