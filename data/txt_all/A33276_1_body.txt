HOnored Friends, for so without scruple or dissimulation can I call you; some of you I honor for your parts, others for your places sake, and both for many good things I see in you, and for evils reformed by you; I call you friends, for my love to you (in truth) is unfained, neither are there (I bless the Lord not∣withstanding the discourteous usage which I and my friends re∣ceived from you) any evill thoughts in my heart towards you, because I judge you were put upon what you did by a zeal (I would not think, unto private or caanall interests but) towards God, thinking thereby to do him service; although I confidently believe, and therefore boldly do affirm that his soul abhors it; And that I may deal plainly with you as a friend, I will tell you what in my heart I think and judge, that such a zeal of God is not according to true knowledge, or knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ, which would soon take you off, and free you from that soul murdering, and blood thirsty lie. I hope you will not be offended to see this Narrative brought forth into the publick view, it being upon the point forst from me by your friends & agent here, seeing also the matter, which is contained therein is of no less than of pub∣lick concernment, was not done in a corner, is the fruit of your zeal, and that wherin I suppose you glory and count your selves herein a worthy pattern for all that sear the Lord, to follow you, and withall their might to be conformed to; which if a truth, I then save you a labour, and further your design, yea I publish your praise, and glory, but my own disgrace and shame; but if a mistake, and falsehood, I shall then hereby give occasion unto your faithful friends (whose words may be of more prevailing power, and force than mine, through prejudice for present, are like to be) to tell you friendly, and yet plainly, that you do but glory in your shame, so that the time may come, if so be the will of God, that you may smite upon your thigh, and say within your selves, what fruit had we then of those things, whereof we are now ashamed; neither let it be offensive to your spirits to see my testimony for which thing sake among you we were shame∣fully entreated, being also strangers to you and belonging to another jurisdicti∣on where and by whose means divers of you, and yours, and such as have been of chiefest note, and most highly esteemed by you, have enjoyed curtesies with far greater liberties in point of conscience no man gainsaying: let it not offend I say to see this testimony when none of you (upon the oft repeated motion) would come forth to oppose it, then to be made yet more publick, & by the word of God, and testimony of Christ Jesus the Lord to be brought forth into the open view of all, confirmed and justifyed▪ neither take it ill that fith I could not with freedom, and upon equal terms speak with you, and discuss these points for which we have been sentenced, that then I have made bold to write unto you some few lines, that thereby I might remind you (least you let it slip) that we were brought be∣fore you as by a hand from beneath, so not without a speciall, and good hand from above, and that to be a testimony against you in these two weighty parti∣culars; first to bear testimony against your standing with respect to the worship of God appointed by Christ, which in plain terms (for it is not now a time to

dissemble seeing the Lord is at hand) is false, and evil, not the order of the Gospel of Christ as you pretend, and therefore disorder, confusion, and that, which in Scripture language is called Babel; And secondly to bear testimony, or witness against that way by which you maintain it, which being chiefly as it appears by carnal weapons, which cannot reach to the heart or spirit of a man, which is the principal part, and upon the point the whole in the worship of God, without which there is no acceptance with him, this I say must needs also be fals, but yet far worse, it being no way appointed, or approved of Christ, nor yet groundedly expected or practised by Christians who first trusted in Christ, and therefore upon due examination will prove most unchristian, yea Antichristian; I shall use but these two arguments in this place to convince you, The first wher∣of standeth thus.
That order, and way to maintain it which neither hath precept from Christ, and his Apostles in his last will and testament, nor yet president, or example a∣mong those that first trusted in Christ, that order cannot be the order of the Gospel of Christ, nor that way his way to maintain it.
But the order which you call the order of the Gospel of Christ, and the way which you say is his way to maintain it, hath neither precept, nor president in his last will and testament.
The first proposition I suppose none of you can deny, unless you can find a later than that which is called his last will and testament, and as for the second the truth thereof, will as easily appear if you bring your order, and way to maintain it to the precept of Christ, and practise of those that first trusted in him; and first for your order, what precept from Christ, or practise among those that first trusted in him have you for baptizing of infants (who are declared to be but flesh and by nature the Children of wrath one as well as another:) for rantising and sprink∣ling them, and not baptizing or dipping them; for accepting such as were sprinkled with superstitious hallowed water, and by the hand of as superstitious consecrated a ministery of Antichrist, and for receiving of such as are sprinkled by your selves to the ordinance of baptism as you call it, but yet to deny them communion in the Apostles doctrine, and in breaking of bread: And if you cannot find either precept from Christ or his Apostles, or example among those that first trusted in Christ for none of these, then will you be a loss for the rest, and neither, find precept or president for your joining together, or for your imitation of those that fist trusted in him in their ministery of continuance toge∣gether in the Apostles doctrine and fellow ship and breaking of bread, and pray∣er. And touching your way to maintain it, what have you a precept and presi∣dent in the last will and testiment of Christ for such a gathering together with respect to the order of the Gospell of Christ in the name, and by the leave of the Magistrate, so as to make it a thing unlawful for the servants of Christ to do it, without him, by the civil sword to correct errour, heresies, and all false worships, to constrain all Church-members, and such also as are without (and so cannot but by you be looked upon to be without faith, without which it is impossible to please God) outwardly and hypocritically to conform to your worship, or to re∣strain them in like manner outwardly and hypocritically from enjoying their own, when according to that rule (to which is annexed the promise of peace to such as walk thereby) the greatest Apostacies and Blasphemies (that unpardonable fin it self not excepted) were but punished with a delivery of the person that was guilty thereof unto Satan the God of this world, that he might learn not to blaspheme the God of heaven, and so to leave him to the coming of the Lord who shall come in flaming fire to render vengeance upon such; and so much is

signified by the word anathema Maranatha. And I pray consider whether this be not to place the Magistrate too high, or too low; too high in case you make him the chief, and upon the point the only Judge in spiritual things (uch as appertain to the mystery of godliness that is so great, and such as belong to the mystery of the Kingdome of Christ, that is so wonderful) so as to judge, and determine what is truth, and what is error and heresie, what is the right way of the worship of God who being a spirit hath declared that he will be worshipped in spirit, and in truth, and what is not; who are the worshippers he seeks for, and who are such as his soul abhors? and again too low in case you make him but the executioner only of other mens judgements; which indeed is the ordinary practise. And so I have done with the first argument; the second stands thus.
2. Arg. That order, and way to maintain it which is not only different from, but contrary unto the precept of Christ in his last will and testament, and the prac∣tise of Christians that first trusted in him, that order cannot be the order of the Gospel of Christ, nor that way his way to maintain it. But the order which you call the order of the Gospel of Christ, and the way which you say is his way to maintain it, is not only different from but contrary unto the precept of Christ, and the practise of Christians that first trusted in him.
The first proposition it undeniable, and the second will easily appear to be true if your order▪ and that way by which you seek to maintain it be brought to and com∣pared with the precept of Christ, and his Apostles, and the example of those churches that first trusted in him; and first compare but your order with either precept, or president; and it will evidently appear not only to be differing from, but contrary unto the order of the Gospel of Christ: for according to the precept of Christ every creature to whom the Gospel was to be preached was by the preaching thereof to be made a disciple before he was to be baptised, and then being so made, and bap∣tized he was to be taught to observe all things which Christ had commanded, which was in reference to a sober, righteous, and godly conversation in the order of his house, according to which precept was the practise of those that first trusted in him, for they, and they only that gladly received the word of salvation by Jesus Christ were baptized, Acts 2 and they, and all they that were baptized were joined with∣out the leave of the Magistrate, and continued together steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine; and in fellowship, and breaking of bread and prayer: but your joining toge∣ther not at the command of the Lord, but by the leave of the Magistrate, and your continuing together in imitation of the first Churches, and appointing a ministery before your selves be baptized, and so visibly planted into the death of Christ as they were; and your administring baptism (as you call it) to such as are not the true sub∣jects thereof before they are taught, or made disciples; and after a false manner, viz. by sprinkling, which no way resembles the death, burial, or resurrection of Jesus Christ, being that which his baptisme is appointed to do; and your admitting some unto baptism (as you own it) which you refuse to admit unto breaking of bread, and your receiving such to breaking of bread, which yet were never baptized with the baptism appointed by Jesus Christ the Lord; and your shutting out the exercise of the gift of prophecying, which in the Church of Christ doth admirably tend to e∣dification; and your introducing a mixt confused way of singing which fills the ear rather with a loud sound of words, than the heart with any thing that is truly edi∣fying, all which is not only differing from, but contrary unto both precept, and president, and so cannot be the order of the Gospel of Christ, and therefore is no better than disorder, confusion, and a part of that which in Scripture language is called Babell. And compare that way by which you maintain it, either with the precept of Christ or with the president of primitive Christians and it will as evidently

appear not only to be different from, but contrary unto them both; for first the precept of Christ was to learn of him who was meek and lowly, and to expect trou∣ble, and persecution from others, and not to persecute, neither to force the Jews that would not follow him, nor yet to fire the Samaritans that would not receive him, yea he expressely commands his Servants to let the rares alone with the wheat, and suffers no small inconvenience thereby to avoid a greater, and further declares that the servant of the lord must nor strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach (not to strike) patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will; according to which precepts of Christ we find the primitive Christians were meek, and gentle, and yet able by sound doctrine both to exhort, & convince the gainsayers, who called not for carnall weapons to mannage their war∣fare, but declared their weapons were mighty through God, and either by the word and a good conversation wonne men to the acknowledgement of the truth as it is in Jesus, or else left them wihout excuse together with the world, unto the judgement of the great day of the Lord; but now all men may see that your way is not only dif∣ferent from, but contrary unto this precept of Christ and president of Christians, and therefore cannot be esteemed any better than unchristian, yet Antichri∣stian.
Let not your adversary and mine (Dear Countreymen) fill your hearts with indig∣nation, and thoughts of revenge against him, who in a faithful discharge of his con∣science both towards God, and you, have made bold to deal plainly with you, least my God to whom vengeance belongs, repay it upon you, and smite you with blindness of mind, and hardness of heart that cannot repent, but rather set before your eyes that memorable practice, and worthy pattern of those noble Bereans, and (laying profits, honor and prejudice aside if it be possible) peruse my testimony, and search the scriptures diligently to see whether the things contained therein be so or no; if you find them so, viz. confirmed, and justifyed by the word of God, and by the testimony of Christ Jesus the Lord, then consider, not I but the Lord from heaven calls upon you to break off your sins by repentance, and let me hereby give you warning to take heed that you dispise not him that speaketh from heaven. As touching the wrong and injury done to us, you having thereby much more wrong∣ed your own souls in transgressing the very law, and light of Nations, doing as you would not be done unto, it is in my heart to pitty you rather, and to petition my Lord in heaven not to lay this sin to your charge, than to complain against you, or to petition your lords and ours here on earth for justice herein; no, no, we have better learned Christ than so, having also given up our hearts to be led by his spirit; and to walk in his steps, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered, he threatned not, but committed his case to him that judgeth righteously, and who knowes but that the spirit of judgement, and the spirit of burning, hath been, or may be ere long in your hearts, whereby you may be made af∣fectedly sensible, that the cause is the same, or very little differing from this.
A poor innocent traveller passeth along the Countrey upon his occasions: a man having strength in his arm findeth him, frames himself offended with him for no cause he hath given him, and because he cannot draw him unto his party, either to rob, or to kill, or to say amen to his practises, he therefore binds him, and casts him in∣to a pit, and declares himself resolute there to keep him, till he hath his blood, un∣less he will deliver him his purse; the man either hath not a purse about him, or a heart to deliver it; and being unwilling either to part with his blood, or that the o∣ther should be so deeply guilty in taking it from him, he meekly, and earnestly

thrice moveth the strong man for a discourse, and humbly entreats him that he would not seek by the strength of his arme, but by the force of some arguments to convince his understanding, and conscience, and so to draw him (as a man) to his party, but the strong man delaies him, and so puts him off; whereupon a good tender hearted Samaritan passing by, and perceiving how the case stood, and that the strong man would have his purse; or his blood without any dispute, being mo∣ved with compassion to redeem this innocent blood from the handof the strong man he delivers him his own purse, and so the man is released. Take it not ill that I have used so much plainess of speech, for my studie is now to speak plainly, and neither flatteringly nor invectively: and to use plain dealing with all men, although I verifie the Proverb, and die a begger; for as I told some of your selve (and that in publick) I abhor dissimulation, neither can I account him a wise man who doth not hate dissembling, or that doth love to dissemble; and therefore saith Solomon rebuke a wise man and he will love thee, &c. and David the King saith on this wife, let the righteous smite me and it shall be a precious balm; I know instruction is grievous to him that is out of the way, but what saith the wise man, he that hateth instructi∣on shall die. Consider I pray what hath been spoken, and turn not away your eye, nor your ear, nor your heart from instruction, least that which was said by the pro∣phet of old Isa. 9. 14, 15. 16. be in you verified, which to prevent is the humble and earnest request unto the fathers of mercies of
