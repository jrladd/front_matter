THe honour of youre person (Right honou∣rable) doth not so muche daunt mee vvith asto∣nishment, as the meruelous mildnesse of your courteous nature doeth mini∣ster incouragement to presume and perfourme the dedication of this my

little labour to youre honours happie handes. VVherein are to be seene the sundry deuises of diuers the best vvri∣ters, as vvell antique as neoterique, of Epigrammes: a proper kinde of stu∣die doubtlesse, & as vvith pleasure, so vvith profite in plentifull manner ac∣companied. VVho knovveth not that youre honour is a speciall Patrone of learning and learned men? accepting moste courteously their simple Poesies, vvhose Garden plots are not so gaily garnished either vvith such plenty or such varietie as others be, that haue more skill both to make choice of those flovvers that haue the svveeter and more fragrāt smell, as also to pick out such as for their fairenes and comely chaūge of colour breede speciall loue &

liking in the eyes of the beholder. This beeing vnto me an assured and also a sufficient incouragement, I felt in my selfe the souden motions of mistrust∣fulnesse somevvhat appauled, and the fier of confidence and hope kindlyng in mee, in so muche that shaking off all manner cogitations of fond feare and bashfulnesse, I yealded my vvill and my vvorke vvholy to bryng that to accomplishmēt vvhich I had pur∣posed vppon a speciall opinion of your honours vvorthinesse conceiued: tru∣styng that this my Manuell shall ob∣teyne as good place in the dedica∣tion, and as muche grace in the accep∣tation (accordyng to the measure of the matter) as the volumes of suche as haue discouered their skill in thin∣ges

of greater importaunce. VVhich in hope it shall be as I vvish, I ceasse a∣ny longer to molest youre Lordshippe vvith my vnpolished Epistle: besee∣ching the almighty and the most high∣est to blesse you vvith health, long life, increase of honour, and all flourishyng felicitie.
