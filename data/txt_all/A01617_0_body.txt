RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
SEeing that by Na∣ture our Country chal∣lengeth a greater in∣terest in vs, then our Parents, Friends, or Children can, and that we ought for preseruation thereof, oppose our liues vnto the greatest dangers: It is

the part of euery Natiue to endeauor something to the aduancement and pro∣fite thereof, and not to affect t, for that wee possesse in it, but to loue it for it selfe, as being the common Mother and Nourisher of vs all. For mine owne part, albeit my short fadome can com∣passe no such great designe as I desire, yet from a willing minde (as hee that offerd his hands full of water to great Artaxerxes) I am bold to present this project of my honest and ; beseeching your L. whose  truely enobled you, to take the  your protection: And prefer it to the  of our most Royall Soueraigne, recom∣mending the good effecting thereof to his gracious fauor and rtherance. Doubt∣lesse: your tions and endeauours hauing

all bene full of virtue and goodnesse, are not the least preuailing motiues whereby his Maiesty hath so endeered you vn∣to him. In this then you shall not thinke your selfe disparaged, the matter being both honest and commendable, and in true valew of as great substance, as the offer of Sebastian Cabota, to King Henry the seuenth, for the discouery of the West Indies.
