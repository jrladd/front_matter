TO thee, long tost in a fell Storm of State;
Cast out, and swallowed in a Gulf of Death,
On false-suspect of thine vn-spotted Faith,
And flying frō thy (Heav'n-giuen) Charge of late:
For much resemblance of thy troublous Fate
(Much like in Case to that he suffereth,
Though (in effect) thy Cause far differeth)
I send my IONAS; to congratulate
Thy (happy) Rescue, and thy holy Triall:
Wher▪by (as Fire doth purifie the Gold)
Thy Loyalty is more notorious Loyal,
And worthy th' Honours which thou now doo'st hold.
Thus, Vertue's Palms, oppressed, mount the more:
And Spices, bruz'd, smell sweeter than before.
