HAving (most Honoured Lady) perused the Lamentations of Jeremiah, I found them suta∣ble to the Complaints of England; and when I called to minde, that these two Ladies, Israel and England, were the Darlings of God, the Daughters of
Heaven, the Wonder of the Earth, and yet the Envie of the World; and then beheld them in the bitternesse of Sorrow, and in their silent sadnesse, despised, dis∣graced, rejected, depopulated, distracted, and abused; I could not chuse but some∣times bathe my Subject with my Teares, and following the president of the sad Prophet, wish, that mine eyes were Rivers of Waters, that I might weepe day and night for the slaine of the Daughter of my people: In∣deed, Israel was elder in Joy, and Eng∣land younger in Sorrow; the Warres of Israel was farther from our apprehensi∣on, the Woes of England neerer us in relation: And who that sees her seque∣stred Husband, her disobedient Chil∣dren, her frowning Brethren, her bow∣ing
Battlements, her weakened Bul∣warkes, her numerous Enemies, and di∣vided Armies, but will say, The glory of England is departed? But it is not so: for through the Gate of Mercie wee may espie a Doore of Hope; I rather take these Divisions for a Purge, that will purifie; or a Qualme, that will qualifie; or an Antidote, to expell Poyson; and the darke Cloud of Englands Warre, to be a short Thunder-clap, to cleare the cor∣rupted Ayre,
Madame, these Contemplations are sad, yet Divine; as Divine, fit for all times; and as sad, onely fit for these.
When I first composed them in Mea∣sure, I intended them for my private
Solace; but through the importunitie of some (whom Nature hath bound me to obey) I have committed them now to publike Censure, which I must expect to be hard enough; yet farre more charitable, if they flye through the world under the shadow of your Honours wings.
These (Honourable Lady) are the First-Fruits of my Poetrie (either Morall or Divine) which I humbly offer to your Honour: To commend them, I cannot; and discommend them, I will not: Few will denie the good∣nesse of the Subject, though many may carpe at the Object; and these will onely be the Scholars of Zoylus, who finde fault with all things, yet can mend no∣thing.

Thinke it not presumption (my Ho∣noured Ladie) that I have intruded so farre upon your Goodnesse, in pre∣senting so unworthie an Offering; and let the Error consume in his Zeale, who is no lesse, nor can begge to be any more, then your Honours ser∣vant,
