WHan I had red ouer this lytell boke / whiche was founde cast in a corner amonge other pam∣flets not regarded: which boke is named a Pronosticacion / & that (as is no doubte) moost true / and very necessary to be knowen: my conscyence moued me (though I can but lytel skyl to entreprise suche a thynge) for to translate it out of la¦tin ī to englysshe / for a more cōmen welth Pytie I had to se so good a worke / so {pro}fy¦tabte
 a lyght (as they say Mat. 5. lu. 8. 11.) to be hydden vnder a busshell. Wherfore vnder your iudgemēt & correction I wyl be glad to put it vpon a candelstycke / that it may be seen to many / & gyue light ferre abrode. whiche I can not do better, than to dedycate it vnto your goodnes / whose godly wysdom & lernynge, is knowen to be so good & circūspecte, that it wolde not suffre suche a thynge to go abrode, but yf it were for a cōmen welthe. The cōmen pronosticacions, that yerely gothe aboute are but tryfles in regarde of this & vayne (ye after my mynde) deceyuable & harme¦full, to not a fewe persones, that hath cre¦dence in them. How can they tel of thing{is} to cōme / or what shall chaūce to men here after. Iob. 38. Act. 1. It onely depēdeth in the disposicion & power of god / whiche or¦dreth all thing{is} in tyme & place as it plea∣seth hym. God saith by his {pro}phete Esaie xlj. Shewe you what thynges are for to cōme: & we shal knowe you to be goddes. And in an other place, spekyng to the Ba∣bylones.
 Esa. 47. Let your Augurers of ye firmament, stande & saue you, whiche be holde the sterres & nombre the monethes for to shewe by them, what thynges are for to cōme. &c. Deut{er}. 28. God promyseth all thynges to succede and to cōme well to passe, vnto all them that byleue purely in hym & wyl obserue his lawes. And threa¦teth the contrary to miscreauntes & euyll doers. Wherfore yf they hap somtyme to touche the truthe: it is bycause they se by coniecture the cōdicions & maners of peo¦ple, by the sentēce of god in holy scripture to deserue and be worthy, eyther peace or warre, helthe or sycknes, derth or plenty, with suche other thynges as they wryte of in their {pro}nosticacions / whiche yf they dyd not in auaūsyng them selues, sekyng prayse & vayne glory of the worlde: but re¦ferrynge all to the worde of god / groūded thervpon / and not vpon their vayne au∣crours and planets: they myght well be herde, & credence be gyuen vnto them, yf they spake not so darkly. Therfore yt men
 sholde not spende their tyme in vayne / it is better that they shold leue suche trifles and vncerteyn sayenges / & leane sadly to this sure & true pronosticacion, grounded onely vpon the worde of god, moost sure foūdacion, and of most hye auctorite. In this a man may somwhat lerne to knowe and feare god / & to haue in reuerence the holy scripture / wherin onely is cōteyned all thynges that belongeth to the helth of soules / and to the godly administracion & gouernaunce of the cōmen welthe / wher vnto god hath called you. And for a sōme as cōcernynge suche thinges in scripture there are set forth here in this kalender folowynge, in stede of sayntes dayes, cer∣tayne holy hystoryes, wherby they may {per}ceyue the benignite & seuerite / the mer∣cy, & rygorousnes of god towardes man∣kynde. And agayne, the fayth, and incre∣dulite / the kyndnes, & vnkyndnes of men towardes god: what are moost specyally to be taken hede of in the scripture of god. So that we may lerne also, to ascrybe no
 thyng to our selues, but to refer all thing{is} to almighty god ye father, thorow Chryst. Yf there be foūde any thynge that is som¦what obscure: let them aske counsell of those yt be good & well lerned. And moost specially praye to god entyerly, yt he wyll open the sence to vs, that we may vnder∣stande the scriptures. Luc. 24. Thus I beseche your benignityes, to accepte my lytell labour, not consyderynge the rude doynge: but ye zele that I haue to forther the ryght wayes of Chrystyan lyuynge, whiche shall be with the helpe of goddes grace, if ye thynke it worthy to go abrode to his honour & glory, whose grace & con∣solacion be euer with you. Amen.
