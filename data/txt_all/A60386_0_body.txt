MY LORD,
IT was Your GRACE's Goodness that first recommended me to Preach this Sermon be∣fore the King, and therefore I presume, un∣der your Protection, to recommend it to the World: It is, I confess, a Hardship Your Lord∣ship in this Case lies under, that Your well-mean∣ing and good Intention must be thus requited, and
 that it was not enough that Your Grace did me the Honour that I should appear before so Great a Prince; but that I must likewise lay my Infirmi∣ties and Imperfections at Your Door now in Pub∣lick: It is indeed an Inconvenience that Great and Good Men sometimes bring upon themselves, even by the exercise of their Vertues; when they cannot shew a Favour, or do an Act of Generosity, but oftentimes it is returned with troublesome and imper∣tinent Acknowledgments; or else Their Patronage must be made use of to screen the Weaknesses and Defects of their Clients. However, my Lord, tho the Workmanship of this Discourse may be but slight and ordinary; yet the Foundation and Ground of it, is firm and strong; and this Advantage my Pen has, that it is engaged in the same Cause with Your Grace's Sword.
My Lord, It has been my Good Fortune from Your very Childhood, to have had Opportunities of observing all the Steps and Progresses of Your Greatness; The very Dawnings of Vertue and Cou∣rage were discernable in Your Grace's tender Years, which now shine forth Bright, and cast a Lustre over the World; even then those seeds of Valour and Magnanimity were easily to be seen which are
 now grown up to full Maturity and Perfection; and Your whole Life, my Lord, has rose by such regular Increases and Ascents, that it appears now like a compleat Piece of Building, the Basts Strong, the Superstructure Beautiful and Uni∣form, the whole Fabrick Perfect, and without a Flaw.
But, my Lord, within the narrow limits of a Dedication I must not think of comprehending Your Grace's Life; only one peculiar Vertue, I, in common with the rest of Mankind that ever knew You, cannot but mention, and that is, Your con∣stant readiness of doing Good.
That extraordinary Quality, that singular Good∣ness of Your own, was, my Lord, the Occasion of this Discourse; and the Reason why it has not ap∣pear'd all this while in Print, when it was His Majesty's Pleasure, and the favourable Request of that Honourable Auditory that heard it, that it should; was, because we continued a long time af∣ter in the Camp, and since then, I, attending my Duty abroad till now, had not Opportunity of be∣ing obedient to their Wills; being re-minded by some Friends now at home, under the safe-Guard
 of Your great Name, my Lord, I venture it out in Publick, nor do I fear any Censures under the Umbrage of so great a Patron as Your Grace condescends to be to,
My LORD,
