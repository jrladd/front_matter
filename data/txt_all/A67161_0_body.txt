Sir,
IT hath been the ap∣proved Custome of most Authors, that when their private Notions are to ap∣pear, and be pressed for publick service, to chuse out of the list of their friends, some noble and worthy Personage under the con∣duct of whose name, they may march into the world. Where∣fore I have in this Dedication, not improperly, made choice of you, who are your self a chief Favorite of the Muses. One who under∣stands the Original as well as the Copy; and could perceive and censure a fault (if possible) in Martial, or Grotius himself, with as much facility as in this Transla∣tion. Which Translation, if it shall gain your fair opinion, I know none of like worth and In∣genuity with your self, will differ from your censure: As for those of a contrary character, I shall va∣lue neither their applause, nor dis∣commendation. Briefly, Sir, your candid acceptation of this piece, will add to your former favours; and by a new Obligation engage me ever to remain, what I have ever been,
SIR,
