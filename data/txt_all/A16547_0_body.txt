AS Christ,Tertullian, vti Mldonat. in 6. Ioan. 44. so the Church, and
as the Church, so the Li∣turgie
of the Church is
crucified betweene two
malefactors: on the left

swept from Babel, and Hierusalem situated in our
owne country: yet both as at a common Turke
shoote bitter arrowes against it. And the
reason hereof is very plaine, because euery

Pope is an open Schismatik, and euery Schis∣matick
a secret Pope. These Foxes (asPraet. Com∣ment. in Galt. Lu∣ther
speakes) are tied together by the tailes, al∣though
by their heads they seeme to bee contrary;
combined in faction, howsoeuer different
in faith. Against the Romanist I vse a sword,
against the Nouelist a buckler, against both
armour of proofe: for these Scholiall anno∣tations
in part descrie, but my larger exposi∣tions
of the Gospels and Epistles hereafter
shall more fully describe, their malicious or
ignorant misconstruing of our Church.
In the meane while and for euer I
wish all happinesse to your
Grace: and rest your
