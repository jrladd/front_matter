Most Gracious Soveraign,
IT having been the Car∣do quaestionis, or too much a question, be∣twixt your Royal Father, and

His Parliament, to whom the sin of our late Civil Wars and miseries, with the bloody and horrid consequences thereof, did belong; though without question He was no way guilty of it, but was a Martyr and sufferer in it, and the guilt and profit of that great and cry∣ing sin being so inlaid and ri∣veted in the promoters thereof, as it was not only by time and successes, which are not sel∣dom the encouragers and sup∣porters of it, become to be the interest of a great part of that Faction or people, but to be

miscalled Piety, Religion, good affection and Godliness it self, and yet sticks as a Leprosie to those and their seed that were more wicked then the covetous but unbloody Gehazi; and if God of his mercy do not cleanse them from it, will transmit it with an impenitency to boote (which we do not finde entailed upon Gehazi's) to their posterities.
The ensuing vindication of your Royal Father, that he was not the Contriver, Author, and Beginner of that War, which hath so undone and Harassed

these three Nations, was for the most part written by me a little before His Mar∣tyrdom, and finished and published about the moneth of April 1649. in the midst of a fiery persecution, and ruining of all that did but act, or write, or do any thing on His be∣half, and now re-printed and come abroad again, may, if publiquely owned under your Majesties gracious Patronage, after Your happy restauration, and the peoples sense and sight of their sin and follies, be more instrumental in the conviction

& converting of many of those misguided zelots or thriving sinners, then it was or could be before they had tasted and been so long acquainted with miseries, and release them out of the prisons of that self-con∣ceitedness and opiniastretè wherein Satan hath cunning∣ly lodged and imprisoned their deluded Souls, making them believe that they are in the Church way to Heaven, when as without a timely repentance they are but going down to the place of everlasting burnings: and is now the more necessary

for that no longer ago then in April last a printed and pu∣blique Address was as impu∣dently, as wickedly, made by a Seditious party, calling themselves, the most faithful friends and servants in the Common-cause, to the Lord General Monck, and the Officers of the Army under his Command, to perswade them, upon false and mistaken grounds, out of their Loyalty, by telling them, That though it were possible that they should forget the publique Interest, and their own, yet

certainly God would not all the injuries and oppressions done by that Family, which pretends to the Government of these Nations, to His Church and people in these and other Nations: And though the Inscription of Exit Tyrannus, which was fixed over the place where the Statue of the late King formerly stood at the Ex∣change, hath been blotted out by the Rabble, yet it was written with the Pen of a Diamond in the hearts of many thousands, and will

be so hereafter in the Ada∣mantine Roles of Fame and History.
And that one of the great Incendiaries and Capital Of∣fenders could very lately and since the Parliaments voting of him to be excepted, desire and make means for a Pardon, but being put to shew his re∣pentance by a publique retra∣ctation, in order to the obtain∣ing of your Majesties favor, would rather be without it then forsake his former opinions; and that there are too many amongst those many that made

acclamations and seemed to re∣joyce in Your Majesties return to Your Throne, and most an∣cient and undoubted Rights, who have not changed their Spots, but counterfeiting Loyalty to get blessings they never deserved, can outdo a Proteus, or the greatest of Dissemblers, and onely keep their vomit to make a Cordial of when they shall but espy an opportunity to lick it up again, and think themselves as infal∣lible as they fancied the Spirit to be which deluded them.
To convert whom, if pos∣sible,

and those too too many who have exceeded the gain∣sayings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, & been greater gain∣ers by it, and to lead them into the right way, and guard as well as I could Piissimi Regis Cineres, the ashes and me∣mory of my late Soveraign from the violation, scandals, and injuries, which those who are rightly called Phana∣ticks, are never a weary to put and cast upon them, hath been and is the design aswell as the duty of him, who having not come in only at the eleventh

hour, but laboured all that he could in the other part of the morning, or day in the vine∣yard of Loyalty, shall ne∣ver cease to be a lover and servant of that Truth and Reason which enjoyns it; And
