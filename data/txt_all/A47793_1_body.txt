MADAME,
THink it not strange, to find so great a Prin∣cesse
so unfortunate, nor much, to entertain
her suitably to her condition, though not to her
quality, and afford her what her misfortunes
have forced from all she hath addressed her
self to, Compassion. We are much moved at the distresses
of Strangers, meerly out of a consideration of their being
such; but when we find the greatest Merit and Excellencies
struggling with Calamities, Vertue it self surrounded with
the inconveniencies of life, and such, whose veines swell
with the noblest blood, expos'd to all the miseries of a ma∣licious
destiny, it defies Humanity to be unconcern'd, and is
able to force the most barbarous inclinations into Sympathy.
All these recommendations have we, Madam, in the per∣son
of the incomparable CLEOPATRA, one whom
her misfortunes have wafted for refuge all over the World,
yet afford not a greater hope of their drawing towards a
Period, then that they have brought her to the extremities
of it, as it were, to try the entertainment of Wales, after that
of so many other Countries.

And where should I addresse her there, with greater hopes
of reception and assistances then to a Family, which glories
only in the secret satisfaction that attends the doing of what
is highly generous and obliging, and sheds its kindnesses
as much beyond the expectations as deserts of those that
receive them. This is an acknowledgment, Madam, which
those, I have in particular received from your noble Father,
force from me, and which I hope your Modesty will pardon,
since that, though it were much greater, it would be below
the resentments may justly be expected in,
Madam,
