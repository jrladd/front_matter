HAving formerly presented Your Hono∣rable Assembly with a large Histori∣call Collection of the severall Execrable Treasons, Conspiracies, Rebellions, Sediti∣ons, Oppressions, Antimonarchicall practi∣ses of our Lordly Prelates, in all former and late ages, in my Antipathy of the English Lordly Prelacy, both to Regall Monarchy, and Civill Vnitie (which gave a fatall blow to the Prelaticall partie;) I thereupon conjectured my Domesticall Collections of that nature, had arrived at a Non ultra: But the Death of some eminent Mem∣bers of the Commons House (principally interessed in the Arch∣bishops prosecution) inevitably engaging me at a dead lift (through the Committees request) to make good the grand Charge against this Arch-Prelate, and bring him to his long expected Tryall, (a trouble which I gladly would have declined:) thereupon the Impor∣tunity of diverse Honourable Friends in both Houses, whom I could not deny, hath (beyond expectation) in the midst of many other distracting occasions, imposed on me this further Trouble, of col∣lecting the ensuing Breviate of his Life, abstracted (for the most part word for word) out of his owne Diary and Papers: which be∣ing a necessary Prologue to the much desired History of his Tryall (wherein his Crimes here pretermitted, will appeare in their proper Colours) was conceived to bee a fitter Fore-runner, then Concomitant of it.
There was one speciall consideration which for a time did some∣what disswade me from this service, to wit a misconstruction which some no doubt will make of my publications in this kinde, as if they proceeded meerly, or principally from malice, or revenge of for∣mer Injuries and Cruelties inflicted on me by this Archbishops means. But my own Conscience and forbearance to meddle with his Prose∣cution, till publikely called and necessitated thereunto, acquitting me from any such imputation; and the never sufficiently admired Providence of my ever-Gracious God in preserving me safe in the midst of all former troubles, imprisonments, sufferings, reducing me in safetie by an Omnipotent hand (beyond all expectation of Friends, and Enemies) even with honour and triumph, from my long close imprisonment and exile in forraigne parts (to which this Arch-Prelate had eternally designed me, without hopes of Redemption,) and since, that in selecting me above all others, by publike authoritie, (contrary to my inclination and desire) to bee both the seizer and peruser of his papers, & prosecuter of his long delayed Tryall; (the protraction whereof by many adorable providences, was one principall meanes of making good his charge, though at first it seemed to disable its proofe;) I could not (in pursuance of this most remarkable worke of Providence) but most cheerfully pro∣ceed in this imposed Imployment, notwithstanding all other Discou∣ragements, Impediments: which being brought to this perfection, I humbly commend to the publike view of the world under your Honours most Noble Patronage, to whom I most humbly pre∣sent it, only with this one most Iust and Equitable Request, which I beseech You seriously to lay to heart.
It was once a Proverb, but now a sad Complaint, that great bodies, have very slow motions, & (alas) many experimentally feele its verity. There are to my knowledg some hundreds of pious Christians quite ruined, or much impaired in their fortunes, by the Tyrannie and Injustice of this oppressing Arch-Prelate and his Confederates; who at the beginning of this Parliament became humble Suitors to it, for Reliefe and Reparation of their Dammages. Their causes therupon were then, to their great expence, fully heard, and voted at severall Com∣mittees; many of them reported in the Houses, their unjust senten∣ces there ordered to be vacated; yea speedy Recompences of their losses, Dammages, then promised, expected. But yet now at last (after two or three years tedious expectation, and sollicitation) their suffe∣rings,Psal. 31.12, Psal. 88.5, 6. causes, losses, are almost quite forgotten, themselves (like dead

men out of mind whom we remember no more) farther from any hopes of reliefe then ever, being so remote from receiving satisfaction for their wrongs, that they still lye under the pow∣er of their former illegall Sentences, Bressures: And if times should alter, their Witnesses or Oppressours dye or miscarry (as many of them have done) or themselves depart this life before their Causes fully determined, they and theirs should be left altoge∣ther remedilesse, and utterly ruined, without redresse. Now I humbly beseech Your Honours, sadly to consider on the one side, what an heart-breaking, and grand Discouragement it wil be, not only to these present Sufferers, but to all others in fu∣ture times to become publike Martyrs for their Country or Religion: and on the other side, what a great Encouragement it will prove to Tyrants, Oppressors in present and future times to exercise all manner of Cruelties, and Iniustice, if the remedy shall prove almost as bad as the disease, and poore oppressed Suppliants in the highest degree, find either no reliefe at all, or such slow redresse of their grievances, as shall quite weare out their patience, and remainder of their decaied estates, and that even in Parliaments (where remedies in former times were most speedy, certaine) and their Oppressors, such Dilatory proceedings against them, as shal be equivalent to Impunity, and exempt both them, their heirs, and Executors from rendring Competent dammages, to those they have oppressed.
I confesse the great publicke pressing Occasions, Warres and Distractions in all our Realms have bin the chiese Remora to Your desired speedy reliefe of oppressed Suitors, Your punish∣ment of Delinquents, and may pleade your just excuse; But yet I humbly supplicate You (most Noble Senators) so farre to commiserate the long unredressed Grievances of these afflicted ones, as now at last to allot some vacant dayes each weeke, for the finall determination of their discontinued & almost for∣gotten Complaints; that they and theirs, may not have cause here∣after to lament, A failer of Iustice even in the supremest Court of Iustice: the undelaied execution whereof both in point of Reliefe and Punishment, hath beene the chiefe support of Our Parliaments Honour, and of the peoples love and assistance to Parliaments.
It is one of the principall clauses in Chap. 29. Magna Charta, wch Our Ancestors, and your Honours have so much contended for,

and we all have lately Covenanted to maintaine,Eccl. 4.1.2. viz. We shall deny, NOR DEFERRE TO NO MAN IVSTICE OR RIGHT. Let it therfore be put in present reall execution, that so none may have cause to take up this mournfull complaint of Solomon; I returned and considered all the Oppressions that are done under the Sun: and beheld the teares of such as were Oppressed, and they had no Comforter: Where∣fore I praised he dead, that are already dead, more than the living that are yet alive, &c. And this through Gods blessing will bee the speediest way to put a period to our Wars, Distractions, Grievances, and gaine Your Honours highest Reputation, Grace Favour with God, and all good men.
Now the good God strengthen both Your hearts and hands to execute speedy Psa. 103.6. Psal. 10.18. Iustice, and Iudgement for all that are oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppresse; and Crowne all your pub∣like Councells, Enterprises with such happie successe, as may occasi∣on all succeeding Generations, to blesse God for You, as the best-deserving Parliament ever yet Assembled: which is the Cor∣diall Prayer of
