GENT.
FInding that the Honourable house of Commons, Assembled in Parliament, hath referred to your consideration and examination some matters touching the reformation of unjust acts committed against Ministers; out of my zeale to that worke I have presumed to hold the Candle to you a little, to further the discovery of a notable Plunderer of the good names, and rigid ransacker of the lives and con∣versations of his other fellow Ministers, having all the same Ordination (from the cursed prelaticall Hierarchy of Bishops, as himselfe called it, p. 16.) and no whit inferiour (let any thing but a Commit∣tee be judge) in the inward Ornaments and graces of the mind, as well as the outward evidence of a vertuous and honest life to the godly and learned di∣vine (that's the word) Richard Culmer, Minister of Gods Word, dwelling in Canterbury, heretofore of Magdalen Colledge in Cambridge, Master of Arts, and what not?

The personall Errors of men I take not upon mee to defend, nor would I have this Honourable Com∣mittee perswaded to cleanse the Augaean stable, that is (as he would have it) thrust out the Tribe of Levi, to make roome for a Tribe of Many-Asses. Nor let the Oyle of the fat Revenues of the Cathe∣drall be drayned into the Lampe of such a burning and shining light as is Richard Culmer, who fol∣lowes you, but as the people did our Saviour Christ, for the bread you give him: for if Kent know Can∣terbury, and Canterbury knoweth but its owne gates and ports, certainely nothing can be better knowne by all men from him that sitteth on the Throne at the Committee, and hee that at home grin∣deth at the mill of his upper and lower teeth, small and sparing morsells to pay the Taxes of his Estate, then Richard Culmer, whose ayme is the downe∣fall of Babylon, and the uprising of Babell and Confusion. And therefore leaving him, if I could so depict him, full 60 steps high on a well-affected Ladder, taking his ayme, I betake me to a miserable and unexcusable losse of time, in perusing of his ray∣ling and impudent slanders and lyes, which will ne∣ver be sanctified by the double spirit of the two godly Licensers, John White and Joseph Caryll.
