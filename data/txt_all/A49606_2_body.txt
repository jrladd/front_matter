PRincess, this perverse Ages glorious gemme,
Whose least of Vertues seems a prodigie;
Illustrious Sien, of the fairest Stemme,
That Heaven e're shew'd this Ʋniverse's eye;

Though Fate with thousand hind'rances averse,
Barres me the place, to which my duty's bent:
I cannot cheer my Soul from self-tor∣ment,
But by design to pourtray you in Verse.
But since that Serres shew's in this true Mirrour
The Vertues of your Mind's eternal splen∣dour,
As lively as your Body's beautious mea∣sure,
My heed to view you here, lets others pass;
So well I here agnize all your rare trea∣sure,
That I ne're saw a better Crystal-Glass.
