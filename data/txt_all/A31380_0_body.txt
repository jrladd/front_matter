Madame,
AMongst all the publick joyes for your Majesties happy return, I know not better how to expresse my own particular, then by most humbly presenting to your Maje∣sty my Translation of this excellent French Book, in the solitude of a Prison, which was made more easie by some relation it had to your Majesties service.
And I presume the rather upon this Dedi∣cation, because all that good which is derived to us from France, (wherof I conceive this may be a part) should receive honour and in∣rease of value from your Majesty, that it may so diffuse it self with moe authority and profit amongst those who may be capable to receive t. Your Majestie, (having read the Orginall) oth well know, that the principall scope of it is o teach the love of God, and contempt of this world, with many other principall virtues.
And for the practice of them all, this age ould not have hoped for so rare an example to nstruct all the great Ladies of Christendome) s it hath found in your Majesty, as well by our admirable fortitude, and perfect resigna∣tion
to Gods holy will in all your Majesties ex∣treme afflictions, dangers and pressures at Sea and Land, as also by your Majesties many sacred retirements (in the most holy time of the year) to sprinkle your pleasures (voluntari∣ly) with some of that Gall which was upon our Saviours lips, when he suffered his bitter pas∣sion and death for our sins. Our great Di∣vines affirm, that the present sufferings of Mount Calvary, lead directly to the future glories of Mount Thabor.
And therefore since your Majesty hath pa∣tiently endured so many unjust and rigorous Crosses in the Mount Calvary of this World, we have great reason to hope, that our blessed Sa∣viour hath prepared for your Majesty, a most glorious Crown in the next, which will ne∣ver have end. And this shall ever be the in∣cessant. and fervent prayer of
Madame,
