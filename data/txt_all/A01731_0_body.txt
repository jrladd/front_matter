IT is more then halfe a yere (right worshipfull) since I handled this pa∣rable of the Sower, in a Sermon at London, Be∣ing instantly vrged by a friend which heard mee, to put it in writing, althogh I was very vnwng, for sundrie considerations, yet I made some promise if lesure shuld serue. Af∣terward when I wold very gladly haue ben released at her hands whom I pro∣mised, I could by no meanes obteine it. I haue therfore at the last so nigh as I could, set down in writing, that which I then vttered in speking, I know that I haue omitted some things in the par∣ticular applications, and exhortations which I made: & also I haue added sōe∣what which either then came not to mind, or els time did not serue to han∣dle. I am bolde to present & dedicate this my poore trauell vnto your wor∣ship, moued therto with diuers respects as thinking my selfe in duetie bound,

not onely with this common & gene∣rall bond that ye are one which long time haue professed the glorious gospel of Iesus Christ: but with diuers more speciall, which are so wel knowne vnto you, that it wer needlesse for me to re∣cite them: only thus much, seeing I was born & brought vp vnder you, my pa∣rents receiuing benefits daily frō you, I think I ought, when as I am not able to make any recompence, at least to shew some token of a grateful mind. But es∣pecially I am moued heerevnto, with consideration of the greatest blessing which all my kindred haue enioyed by you now so long, in prouiding & pro∣curing their spiritual instruction. I pray you accept of my good will, & account of mee as one which praieth to the Lord for you, that he will multiplie & increase his good giftes still in you, to the glorie of his holy name, the bene∣fit of his Church, & your endlesse com∣fort in Iesus Christ. Amen.
