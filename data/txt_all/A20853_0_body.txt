MOst noble Ladie, I leaue my Po∣ems as a monument of the Zeale I beare to your vertues, though the greatest part of my labour, be but the least part of my loue: And if any thought of worth liue in mee, that onely hath been nourished by your mild fauours and former graces to my vnworthy selfe, and the admiration of your more then excellent parts shyning to the world. What nature & industry began, your honour and bountie hath thus farre con∣tinued. The light I haue, is borrowed frō your beams, which Enuie shall not eclipse, so long as you shall fa∣nourablie shine. Vnder the stampe of your glorious Name my Poems shall passe for currant, beeing not altogether vnworthy of so great a superscription: I liue onely dedicated to your seruice, and rest your Honors humblie deuoted.
Michaell Drayton.
