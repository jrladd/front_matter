SIR,
BEing you were pleased some
years past, to grant me
your free leave to do what
I have here attempted; and
observing, you never retract any promise
when made in favour even of your mea∣nest

friends; I accordingly expect to see
these following particular Directions for
the taking of a Trout, to wait upon your
better and more general Rules for all
sorts of Angling: And, though mine be
neither so perfect, so well digested, nor
indeed so handsomely coucht as they
might have been, in so long a time as
since your leave was granted; yet, I
dare affirm them to be generally true:
And they had appeared too in some∣thing
a neater dress, but that I was sur∣priz'd
with the suddain news of a sud∣dain
new Edition of your Compleat
Angler; so that, having but a little
more than ten days time to turn me in,
and rub up my memory (for in truth I
have not in all this long time, though

I have often thought on't, and almost
as often resolv'd to go presently about it)
I was forc't upon the instant to scribble
what I here present you: which I have
also endeavour'd to accommodate to
your own Method. And, if mine be clear
enough for the honest Brothers of the
Angle readily to understand; (which
is the only thing I aim at) then I have
my end; and shall need to make no
further Apology; a writing of this kind,
not requiring (if I were Master of any
such thing) any Eloquence to set it off,
or recommend it; so that if you, in your
better Judgment, or kindness rather, can
allow it passable for a thing of this na∣ture:
You will then do me honour if
the Cypher fixt and carv'd in the front

of my little fishing-house may be here
explained: And, to permit me to at∣tend
you in publick, who in private, have
ever been, am, and ever resolve to be
Sir,

Berisford 10th.
of March 1675-76.
