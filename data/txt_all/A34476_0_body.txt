MAdam, it is but just, since you receive
All the Delights our Soveraign can give,
That we; in gratitude unto our King,
Shou'd to your Highness bring an Offering.
For we by Duty are oblig'd to Prize
Those that are Gracious in our Princes Eyes,
As well as hate his greatest Enemies.
Accept this also, Madam, sent to you,
Both as Your Merit, and Your Beauties due;

Which to You not the least of Glory brings,
Having by it subdu'd the best of Kings.
And now Your Country may Precedence claim,
Since You have gave it such a lasting Fame;
Greece, Helen; England, Rosamond did boast,
But France You henceforth will Glory most;
For by Your conqu'ring Eyes You have made known
The Monarchy of Beauty is Your own.
You are the Darling of my King, His Pleasure,
His Indies of incomparable Treasure;
That precious Gem, who from your Country came,
Too narrow for the Limits of Your Fame,
Into the Bosom of a King who knows
What 'tis for to deserve, and to dispose.
But stay, my Muse, no Sacrilegious Eye
Shou'd dare be so Prophane, as once to pry
In Princes Actions; they like Gods appear,
And never move in any common Sphere:
We shou'd from their Concerns our selves retire,
And what we understand not well, admire.
Your Pardon, Madam, if my zealous Passion
Has err'd beyond the Rules of Dedication;
And if so high and rare a Contemplation
Shou'd fly beyond all bounds of Limitation,
And on Dedalian Wings shou'd dare to pry
Too near the Beams of Sacred Majesty;
Since my Ambition for your Service may
Make me speak more than others dare to say.
Then prostrate at your Feet I now lay down
This Infant Book, which may deserve your Frown;

But hopes a better Fate, since the intent
Was good, and only for your Service meant.
Which if you view but with a pleasing Eye,
It will presage such a Felicity,
That all the Frowns of Fortune, and the rage
Of time shall want a Power to engage.

Your Highnesses Most humble and devoted Servant,
