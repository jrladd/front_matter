VVorthy Knight:
THe worthinesse of this sub∣iect, in which is set downe, the difference of light and darkenesse, in the nature of Honour and disgrace, to the deseruers of either, hath made me (vpon the note of the Noblenesse of your spirit) like the Eagle, still looking towards the Sunne; to present to your

patience, the Patronage of this little Treatise, of the VVorthies and Vn∣worthies of this Age: Wherein, I hope, you will finde some things to your content, nothing to the contrary: which leauing to the acceptance of your good fauour, with my further seruice to your command: I humbly rest,
