My Lord,
THE Widows Mite cast to the store,
Was more than all, for she cou'd give no more;
The Rich, indeed, might daily Presents bring,
As flowing from an inexhausted Spring:
I say not this that you shou'd partial be,
Or think this more, because it came from me,
But only, that I am as poor as she:
As poor, I mean, in Sense, as she in Coin;
Nor is that Mite originally mine:
'Tis true, a Mite is, in it self, but small,
But vast the store that gives a Mite to all:
You are that Store, my Lord, whose boundless mind,
In Iudgment firm, in Fancy unconfin'd,
Distributes Rayes of Sense to all Mankind.
It is but just then (as the Gods inspire
Earths sordid Clay with their Celestial Fire,
Which, whensoe're the dull Mass finds a Grave,
Returns again to the same God that gave)
I shou'd that little, All I have, restore;
But blush to think that 'tis improv'd no more.
I am, My Lord,
