HAtcht in the nest of Honor, you are blest,
In hauing vertues to support your nestâ–ª
For though you'r grac'd by birth, and great by Bloud,
I more admire this Title, you are good.
For this (as it true greatnesse doth expresse)
Shall Crowne your Honor with all Happinesse.)
But natiue vertue needs no Artfull Bayes;
" Vertue her selfe's her prize, her selfe her prayse.
