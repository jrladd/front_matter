AFter that
this hystorye
of the tuyne &
destruction of
Troye writ∣ten
by the aun¦cient
histori
graph Dares
Phrigius,
was euen of late deliuered me, tran∣slated
into Frenche, and that I had
perused, & well perceaued the truth,
the prety and fyne conueyaunce ther
of, the politike and ingenius feates

of martial actes, and the prudent per¦suasions and counsels, both of the
Grecians, and of the Troians ther∣in
contayned: I was so in loue ther∣with,
that incontinently I prepared
both penne, ynke, and paper, to tran∣slate
the same into oure Englysshe
tonge: ponderynge there with, howe
pleasaunt & how profitable a thinge
it shulde be vnto the nobilitie of this
our realme, most feruentlye in these
our dayes geuē to the knowledge of
forren historyes, and subtell poyntes
and stratagenies of warre, to haue it,
and to reade it in Englyshe. For al∣beit
that histories do indifferentlye
auayle al men, yet most specially no∣ble
and learned men, because that the
knowledge of them is most profita∣ble
and necessary to all those, whiche
haue the gouernaunce of commonne
weales, By these the mindes of such

noble and learned men may be stur∣red
to the study of true nobilitie, and
vertue. By these the begynnynge of
empyres is knowen, and why there
hath chaunsed in them so greate and
so straunge alterations and greuous
commotions. In these are conteyned
the preceptes of offices and vertues,
whereby the common weale maye
most prosperously be preserued, con∣tinued,
and auaunced. Histories do
teache men what best besemeth them
to do, what may auaunce them, what
maye hurte and hynder them, what
maketh thē welthy and ryche, what
maketh them poore and nedye, what
maketh them to floryshe, what ma∣keth
them to be in mysery, and howe
to knowe vyle flatterers from sure
and trusty frendes: good and fayth∣full
ministers, from false feignynge
dissemblers. Suche histories then,



are a treasure whiche neuer ought to
be refused nor reiected oute of noble
and learned mens handes, for by the
diligent turnynge and readynge of
them, they may be as profitable vnto
the commō weale, as to them selues,
theyr frendes, and priuate families,
and therwith haue an exacte know∣ledge
of all that is necessarye to be
knowen, concernynge thynges done
in tymes paste. Wherefore it shall
please your gentlenes, not to consy∣der
the rude handlynge of thys my
small and symple gyfte, or that I
indge it worthy so learned a man in
all poyntes as ye are, but to ponder
the auncientnes, and ye truth of this
historye, the knowledge that maye
ryse thereof, and my louynge herte
towarde you.
Farewell.
