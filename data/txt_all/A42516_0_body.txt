My Lord,
IT would be a great Presum∣ption
in me (who am a Stran∣ger
in this Country) to appear in

Publick manner without the Pro∣tection
of some Great Name.
That of Your Lordships is deser∣vedly
such, seeing to the Great∣ness
of Your Birth, You have
added the highest Qualities of
Wisdom and Vertue, and dis∣charged
the Public Trusts of
Your eminent Station, so much to
the satisfaction of all good Men.
I find (wheresoever I go)
great Numbers of those who
highly Honour the Memory of
Your Lordships Father, and speak
of him as of a Friend and an
Ornament of the Church, a Pillar
of the State, an Oracle of the

Law, a Judge and Patron of
Learning and Learned Men, an
Encourager of Persons of Sound
Principles and good Lives; a
Bountiful Support of those of
our Country, who have fled hither
for meer Conscience sake; and a
Worthy Example of Sobriety,
Justice, and Charity.
Your Lordship following so
Excellent a Father with equal
Steps, I presume to make this my
Humble Application to You, in
behalf both of my Self and of
this Book, which with an honest
Design I have Written and
Published, resting secure under

Your Lordships Patronage, and
resolving (by the Blessing of God)
always to make good the Chara∣cter
of,
My Lord,
Your Lordship's
Most Humble and
most Obedient Servant,
