DRead Lord, even the apple of Gods eye,
Jesses great sonne did tast adversity,
Though that his Subjects rose not, yet his Sonne
Stir'd up his people to rebellion:
And this most damn'd insurretion 'gainst thee
Is but a second Absalonisme:
But here's the difference, their base desire
Was to inthrone the Sonne, divest the Sire.
But these hell-hounds, their utmost doe assay,
To make both Father, and the Sonne away,
Hiding the face of their most black designe
Under a vizard Lustrious, and Divine;
So like the fiend, when he appeares to sight
Refulgent, like an Angell of the light,
Do they disguise themselves, unto the rude,
And many headed Beast, the Multitude,
Who now have found their errour, and repent
That ere they trusted to a Parliament.
But now their hands are ti'd, their strengh is gone,
And they are vassalized every one:
The knot of the State Mountebankes they curse,
And of their basenesse make their whole dscourse.
The names do stinke of Hollis, Pym, and Strowd,
And now Give us our King, they call aloud:
But there's a Remora, the pack of traytors,
A bed of snakes congeal'd, the Adjutators
Reply, you must not yet enjoy that good
The earth a second time must drinke their bloud:
We will be Kings, which we shall never be
Lest CHARLES be sent unto Eternitie:

Therefore upon the eleventh of November
He breathes his last, an Independent member
Shall cut his thread of life in twaine, (tis well)
This good we owe to Peters and to Dell.
But thou, our dearest Lord hast scap'd the net,
The which those bloudy huntsmen for thee set:
And forc'd for safety to withdraw a while,
Into a nooke of thy divided Isle:
Live there, and see thine enemies to fall
By their owne Engine; and mean time we all
Will pray to thy preserver, to possesse
Thy Royall soule with peace, and happinesse.

So prayes,
