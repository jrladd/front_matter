SIR,
IT hath been a Complement with
some, when they have treated
Friends, to profess a barrenness
in that which they had prepared not without
studied charge, and Curio sitie. As I was ne∣ver
so insolent to magnifie my own, being
best acquainted with my weak abilities: so
I should deserve a just affront to my self, and
undervalue your person, to present you with
any thing were first cheap in my own opini∣on.
Sir, this Poem, I may with modesty affirm,
had a fair reception, when t was personated

on the stage, and may march in the first rank
of my own compositions, which directed now
by my humble devotion, comes from the press
to kiss your hand, and bear your noble Name
in the dedication. I cannot have so much pre∣judice
upon your nature, to think you will de∣cline
it, and should I abate those other cha∣racters
of honour that shine upon you, your in∣dulgence
to Musick and singular love to the
worthy professors eminently, shew the harmo∣ny
of your soul, and while Poetry is received
a Musicall part of humane knowledge, I can∣not
despair of your candid entertainment. Sr.
I beseech you take it, as an earnest of my
thoughts to serve you, I am assured it brings
with it, beside the acknowlegment of your late
obligation upon me, ambitious desires to pre∣serve
my interest in your favour, while I sub∣seribe
my self,
Sir,
