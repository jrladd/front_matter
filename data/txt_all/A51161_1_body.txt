Right Honourable,
THO, to the best of my thoughts, nothing be Treat∣ted of in the following pages, but what is Exactly Agree∣able to the SACRED O∣RACLES, and which any Unbyassed Reason cannot but approve of, nothing but what visibly tends to the Reformation of our Hearts and Lives, and to the Im∣provement and perfection of our Na∣tures; and, in a word, nothing but what
 is of the greatest Moment and Conse∣quence; Yet it is not Improbable, but the unjudicious Weakness of some, the prejudices of others, and the Corrupt Lusts and Passions of a Third Sort may dispose them not to do Justice to some∣things that are here insisted on and Recom∣mended. Weak and Unthinking heads are commonly Rash and Precipitant, and Censure Promiscuously and without Dis∣cretion. And truth is never more Un∣acceptable nor more Provocking than when it comes with such Light and Evi∣dence as Sensibly Crosse the Prejudices, and Choke the Lusts of Men. As I en∣deavour to enquire into the Truths of our Holy Religion, with as Impartial and Disengaged a Spirit as is Possible for me, so having, as I conceive, discovered them, I propose them Simply, without Labour∣ing to accommodat them to the Opinions that commonly obtain any further than they have Truth in them, or giving them such a Turn, as may Flat∣ter our vitious Inclination; Perhaps this
 Fair and Impartial Procedure may not be very Pleasing to Some Narrow Spirits, and more especialy may Disoblige these Soft Devotionists, who would have Re∣ligion so Fraim'd, as to give them hopes of Heaven without needing to Disclaim their Lusts; For the Vaine and Hypocri∣tical Pretences, of such are here Continu∣ally Baffled and discredited.
From what I have thus briefly Repre∣sented, it easily appears, that, the Rea∣son why I prefix your Names to the Fol∣lowing Performance was, not only that I might give a publick Testimony of the great and very Sincere Respects, which I Secretly intertain as well for your per∣sons as for your Honourable Character and Faculty; But also that I might be∣speak your Protection against the Assaults of the Injurious, not doubting but your Generous Inclinations, to Favour and As∣sert the interests of Truth & Righteous∣ness will prompt you to cast a Friendly look on this Little Tract, in which, after you have Vouchaf'd it a serious Perusal.
 I am Hopeful, you will find Nothing but what Realy Contributs to the Promoveal of a Truely Christian Piety. It is true indeed, though the matters whereof I Treat in this Essay be great and Noble, and worthy of all Acceptation, yet I must confess that the Defectivness and Unaccuracies of the Managment may render it a present, very Unsuitable to Persons of so Polite a Judgement, as all the world know those of your Faculty to be, whose Appearances, even when Ex∣temporary, are as severely elaborat as these Composures which have been the res¦sult of Thought and Meditation. But I was soon reliev'd against the Uneasienes of this Reflextion by Considering; That great Minds have a Proportionable Can∣dor, and that therefore as you can quick∣ly discover a defect, so you can as speedi∣ly Pardon and cover it, especialy when it is not such as toutches the Essence of the Subject treated of. Besides, I Concluded that the Sincere Love which you have for the Great things of the Christian Reli∣gion
 would incline you to put a just Value on them, even when they are not set off with all the Advantages that the Nice and Delicat would require. It will not in the Judgement of the Sagacious and Discerning, Lessen the value of a pre∣cious Jewell, that it is presented to them in a Rag, nor do we vilify a Sover∣aine Restorative, because it is conveyed to us in a coarser Vehicle. They are cer∣tainly things of Inestimable Value, Truths more Precious than Rubies, and of great∣er efficacie than the most Fam'd Antidots, that I here set before you, and which under your Countenance and Patrocinie. I adventure to Publish to the World, and therefore the ruder dress, in which they appeare ought not to Disparage them in the Opinion of the Judicious.
It cannot but Extreamly afflict all that yet Retain any Measures of seriousness, to see the Reputation of the Christian Religion so dreadfully Sunk, as it is in this very Corrupt Age; to see those who have been solemnly Initiated into it, and
 brought up under it, Prophanely Deride∣ing its Venerable Mysteries, and even making Total Apostacy from it, and Blaspheming that Worthy Name, by the which they are called. A Villany so prodigiously Aggravated, that it Out-does the Wickedness of Devils. Two things, I conceive, have especially Contri∣buted to this Mischief; One is, the False Notions which People have Form∣ed to themselves of this Holy and Ex∣cellent Religion; The other is, the Shameful Disagreebleness of the Lives of those who profess it to its Sacred Rules, their Discovering a Spirit and Temper, and Practices, quite contrary to those which it Enjoyns and Requires, and in the mean time perswading themselves that they are Christians good enough, Not∣withstanding, And both those are mutual Causes to one another; For as on the one Hand. False or Defective Apprehen∣sions of the Nature and Designs of Reli∣gion, do open a Door to Vitious Incli∣nations and Practices; So on the other,
 the Love which Men have to their Lusts, disposes them so to Mould Religion, and to Gloss its Precepts after such a manner, as that all the Appetits of their Flesh and Blood, and Corruption may be Grati∣fied and indulged without needing to fear, that for all this, they Violate the Max∣imes of Christianity, or cross its De∣signs, or that there is any danger of their coming short of the Glories of the other World. And as those Inauspicious Twins do thus Reciprocally influence and Cause each other, so they jointly Con∣curr to dishonour and expose the Chri∣stian Religion; For it is very plain, I think, That when False Notions are in∣tertain'd concerning it, when it's great Designs are mistaken, its most Essential Truths and Duties are overlook't and Disreguarded, and the Stress of it laid on things of very small Moment, when some little Opinions, some Forms and Circumstances, are not only set on the same Levell with its most indispensable Maximes, but also more zealously Assert∣ed




 and urged, and when, in fine, under pretence of explaining it, Doctrines are mingled with it, which, though they pass with many for Evangelical truths, yet be∣ing in Effect nothing else but the deceitfull Comments of Selfe Love, they Visibly E∣vacuat and Subvert its great ends when, I say, our Holy Religion is thus Hide∣ously misrepresented, when it is so Clouded and darkned as that none of its Lovely and Venerable Traces do appear, or at least are but very imperfectly de∣lincated, we need not wonder though they, who have never inquir'd into it themselves with Candid and Sincere hearts, but taken their Accounts of it from others, whose Conceptions of it are very far from being True and Genuine, should not pay it those Deferences, which it justly deserves. They will in this Case deal by it as we wold do by a Face, which though it were the most agreeable in the World, and wanted nothing to constitute it a most perfect Beau∣ty, yet if it should be Exhibited to us un∣der a Frightfull Vizard, or so Blurred
 and Disguised as that we could discern none of its amiable Lineaments, in stead of engageing our Affections and Reguard, it would beget in us dislike and horrour, so that what we would highly Admire and Commend, if we saw it in its own Na∣tive and Lovely Features, we now Dis∣parage and Undervalue. But moreover, when the Practices of the Votaries of the Christian Religion, are perpetual Contradictions to its Excellent Laws, when nothing of that Spirit, and of these Dispositions, which make its peculiar Character, is discoverable in them, when they live by the Maxims of Flesh and Blood, and according to the course of this World; And more especially, when this Disconformity visibly bewrays it self in the Guids of Souls, when they pay none or very little Reguard in their own Con∣versations to the Precepts of that Reli∣gion which they Preach and Recommend to others, when they Scruple not to Sacri∣fice its most necessary and most Essential Maxims, to their Interests their
 Ambition, their Partiality, their Pre∣judices, and their Passions, when a Spi∣rit of Worldliness, of Sensuality, and Self-Love Predomin's among them as much as among the Men of the World, it is evident, that the influence which these things are naturally calculated to have on the minds of the Prophane, and of such as are yet Strangers to the Life of GOD, is to Encourage and confirm them in their Wickedness, to suggest to them Dishonourable Thoughts of Reli∣gion; To make them think that Men do not really believe what they appear to Profess, and what they talk of with seeming Seriousness and Concern; that the whole is but Cheat and Imposture, or an Engine which People serve them∣selves of to Advance a Turn or an Interest.
Whereas, if the Nature and Designs of this Holy Religion were well Under∣stood and Considered, if Men had a just Idea of it, if its Beauties were set in a True Light, according as they are pro∣posed to us in the Sacred Books, and without Reguard to the Disfigureing
 Schemes which Prejudice and self-love have made of them, I perswade my self, that, to all who had any Tollerable measures of Ingenuity and good sense, The Contrievance would appear to be so well laid, to be so evidently the re∣sult of the highest wisdom and good∣ness, and so very propper to raise up Hu∣man Nature to the greatest pitches of perfection and Happiness which it is capable of, that they could not but Ac∣knowledge the whole to be Oweing to a Divine Original. And then if the Practices of Christians did Answer their Profession and Belief, if their con∣versations were Unblameable transcripts of the precepts of the Gospel, if the A∣miable Graces which are there recom∣mended did Conspicuously Adorn their lives: and in a word, if they traced the Footsteps of their Redeemer by a care∣full Imitation of his self-denial and contempt of the World, his Meekness and Humility, his Purity and Charity, and Devotion, How quickly would
 Christian Religion become the Glory of the World, How soon would it spread and Propogat and Triumph over and Ecclipse these ways of Religion, which either Ignorance or Superstition, or Imposture have set up; For nothing can more effectualy Convince the World of the excellencie of Christianity than a liveing and Practical Representation of its beauties in the Hearts and in the Conversations of its Proselytes. This was one great Reason, why, when it was first Promulgat, it made so speedy a Progress through the Nations; For as its Primitive Converts had true and genuine Nations of its Nature and De∣signs, So also they formed their Lives according to its Maximes, and became the Lovely Images of the Holy JESUS by a reall Participation of his Spirit, and Conformity to his Life: whence it was Natural to Conclud that it could not choose, but be a very excellent Religion, which begat so many great and noble Qualities in its Votaries.

Happie had it been for the Christian World, if in stead of Eternal Wrang∣lings, and Dispute about Lesser Matters about Circumstances and Forms, about Dubious or Unprofitable Speculations, all did Contribute their Hearty Endea∣vours to Rescue the Gospel from these False and Underminding Views, which too Commonly are had of it, to State and Urge its True Notion, and to Retrive the Christian Life and Practice. To do this, is wha according to my Poor Abilities, I have Aimed at in the follow∣ing Pages; For in Treating of the Incar∣nation I have infisted on the Great-things of our Religion, and Explained them in such a manner, as that, I perwade my self, every serious Peruser will soon discern what That is which our Blessed Saviour hath laid the stress of Our Salvation upon, and Consequently what That is, in which all who pretend to be his Dis∣ciples, ought more especially and Indis∣pensibly to be Exercised. And then in Exhorting and Directing Parents, and
 the Overseers of Youth to be Influenced by these things themselves in the first place, and next to Instill, the Know∣ledge of them unto their Children, and to Labour by all means Possible to Gain them to the Love and Practice of them, I hope, I have Pointed at one of the most Effectual Methods to Revive Primitive Christianity, for as a wretched Negli∣gence to Educat the Youth according to the Maximes of the Gospel, is one very Considerable Source of the Degenera∣cie of the Christian World; So it is very certain, that a Pious and Diligent Care to acquaint them betimes, with the Doctrines and Holy Life of their Re∣deemer, and to Train them up in these Practices, whith the Excellent Precepts and Lovely Patterns he hath given them, do Inviolably oblige unto, have Visibly a Singular Tendency to restore decayed Piety.
And now, Right Honourable, I hope, you are Sensible how Momentous and Important the Designs are which
 this little present I presume to offer you Aimes at; and therefore I Adventure Humbly to Intreat, not only that you would accept of it as a Mark of that Undissembled Affection I have for you, but also that, since the Advantages of it, if any such shall attend the Peruseing it, were not intended to be limited to you a∣lone, but that by your Means it might be∣come the more universally useful, you would Vouchsafe to take it into your protection; For, as I know that the more extensive and unconfined the hap∣pie consequences of any project may be, the more highly you will Value and prize it; So, I assure my self, that next to the Divine Blessing, without which all our Endeavours will prove unsuccessful, no∣thing can more effectually entaile the Character of being Universally benefici∣al on this Performance, or make it ap∣pear with greater acceptableness in the World, than your Countenance and Favour. Let me be allowed to tell the Truth without needing to fear that I shal
 incur the censure of being a Flatterer for so doing, unless from the Sons of Envy and Malice. For when Persons of solid Judgment and deep Penetration, of excellent Learning, and Unbyassed Spirits, all which none without doing you Palpable Unjustice can deny to be your Just character; Shall own and approve the Advices and Directions which are here tendered, and the excellent Truths insisted on in Prosecution of them, as this will exceedingly recommend them to the Candid and Ingenuous, so it will either entirely prevent the unkind Criti∣cisms of the less Judicious, who should be ashamed to disparage these things, which have got the Approbation of such as are more Competent to Determine of their value; or else make their Ver∣dict, if they shall think fit to pass any to be but very little reguarded.
And here before I close, I must beg leave to tell you that one of the best uses you can make of these great Accomplish∣ments which GOD hath bestowed on you,
 is to imploy them in asserting the Chri∣stian Religion, and these incomparable Doctrines which it proposes. As your doing this becomes very Seasonable now, when the little witts of the Age imploy all the Art and Skill they are Masters of to disparage and reproach that ex∣cellent Religion, which hath such evi∣dences of Truth on its side as ought to give entire Satisfaction unto all who do not wilfully shut their eyes; So it will be very much your Honour, for this is the Noblest Cause you can Possibly un∣dertake the Patrocinie of. The Cause I intend is the Christian Religion to∣gether with its great and essential Truths and Duties, and not the petty interests and opinions of this and that and the other partie, which are but Contemp∣tible Triffles in Comparison, Tho some∣times Obtruded on the World under very sacred and Venerable Names. In the mean time, we must Seriously re∣member, that it is not enough to appear in behalf of Christianity by our reason∣ings,
 by speaking Honourably of it, and by Baffling the Cavils of the Atheisti∣cal and the Prophane, To do so is cer∣tainly very Laudable and Argues that one hath a great regard to Truth. But to our Arguments we ought to add true∣ly Christian and Holy Lives, and so de∣monstrate the Excellencie of our Reli∣gion by the Lovely change which it makes in the Hearts and Conversations of such as are sincerely Proselyted to it, 'Tis this that will give Force and weight to our Defences in its Favours, and con∣vince the World that we are in earnest, and that we take its part, not from a Fluctuating and Soon shaken Opinion, hich Education or Interest or some o∣ther byass may have begot in us concern∣ing it, but from a deep Sense, and Solid conviction of its Truth and real worth. But I need not deduce to you the Advantages of seconding your Ap∣pearances for the Christian Cause, with Lives adorned with the Christian Graces and Vertues; This is what, I assure my
 self, you are abundantly sensible of, and you know how to manage this as well as all other Causes better then I can direct you. I pretend only here to imitat your ruder and less experienced Clients who not being capable to furnish you with a full and minute Information of the State of their Affairs, give only some few in∣genuous hints, which however are suf∣ficient to affoord you such a Prospect of their Matters as will enable you solidly to assert their interests, and to rescue them from the Encroachments of oppres∣sion and injustice.
I cannot forbear to add moreover on this head, that as your Justifying the Christian Religion by forming your lives according to the Excellent and lovely Models which it sets before you, will mightily enforce and recommend what you offer in its Vindication, so, you may be firmly perswaded, that it will beget such ineffablc joys, such a lasting Peace and Serenity in your Souls as shal infinitly out do these empty and short
 lived pleasures with which the Vitious and prophane are bewitch'd and infa∣tuated, and that furthermore, upon your faithfull perseverance in well doing, it will Entitle you to the Bliss and Fe∣licities of the other World, the very hopes whereof, which, when Solid and well grounded are ever accompanied with some sweet first Fruits of the full Harvest of Glorious and eternal Enjoy∣ments, will make all that is most taking & delightful on Earth to disappear and evanish, and to become gustless and insipid.
The Holy Jesus, the ever Blessed and Infallible Author of this excellent Reli∣gion, hath assured us, That, when he comes in the Glory of his Father with the Holy Angels, he will confer very peculiar and eminent marks of his Love and Favour on such as shall not be a∣shamed either of Him or His words in an Adulterous and sinfull Generati∣on. Alas, it is but too plain that those Epithets are proper enough to Charact∣erize
 the Age in which we live, wherein there is so visible and so woful a De∣generacie from the Christian Life and Spirit, and the Maxims of Flesh and Blood have so got the Ascendant and are in such Vogue and Reputation, that to lead a Life according no the Rules of the Gospel, and the Maxims of the Cross is to expose One's Self to contempt and derision. Now in such a juncture as this, to appear in behalf of Christianity not only by asserting its Truths, but also by strictly obeying its precepts, is cer∣tainly Great and Noble, and as it abun∣dantly evidences, that one is not ashamed of the words of the Son of GOD, so it is the most effectual Method to reclaim the Enemies of Piety, and is such a generous instance of Love and Devoti∣on to our Redeemer as he will he mighti∣ly pleased with, & which he will not fail singularly to reward, when he comes to ren∣der to every man according to his works.
The Christian Religion hath indeed a great many Adversaries, who appear against it under different Forms, Some
 deny its Truth, and are so Blasphemous∣ly insolent as to put it in the same rank with the Impostures of Mahomet. O∣thers insult over & redicule its Sacred Mysteries. A third sort gloss away its precepts in favours of their old man and corruptions. But perhaps the No∣minal Christians are its most dangerous and fatal Enemies; Those, I mean, whose hearts and Lives are Diametri∣cally opposit to its Spirit and designs, even while they acknowledge it to be true and profess to believe, that it is from GOD. It is certain that Vice and irre∣ligion, particularly Pride and Self-love, are the Source of Errours, unholy hearts make unsound and giddie heads. It is the blind Love which Men have to their Lusts that gives them a disgust of Christianity, because it obliges them to deal a little severely by their dear flesh and Blood, and to do violence to their Vitious but beloved inclinations, and this dislike gradually advances till at last, it Issues either into
 a total Apostacie from it, or else into formeing such Schemes of it as will Fla∣ter all the appetites of Corrupt Nature, So that, doubtless, tho surest Fence a∣gainst all Pernicious Errours is a pure Heart and Holy life; And therefore one of the greatest kindnesses we can shew to Religion, and the most Signal instance of Charity we can do to the Souls of Men, is to Labour by all means Possible to Reclaim the Vitious and the Prophane, and the Nominal profes∣sors to a truely Christian Life and Practice.
And here again, Right Honourable, I open a new Field for Your Pious En∣deavours and Contrivances. We are informed by the Publick Accounts that in several places a great many Good Souls, among whom some of Your Own Profession make no inconsiderable Fi∣gure are Setting up Societies, and Enter∣ing into Religious Confederacies, not to Advance the Interests and Opinions of a Sect or partie, but to reform the
 manners of Men, to encourage true Good∣ness and to retrieve Primitive Christia∣nity, and that not only by endeavour∣ing to become Conspicuous instances of it Themselves. But also by engaging as many as possibly they can to joyn with them in so Noble and so Charitable a Project, and by doing all that lyes in their Power to bring Prophanity and Irreligion into Contempt and Disgrace. It is, I assure you, a part of the Seri∣ous Wishes of not a few, that some such as you, whose influence, and Wisdom and Prudent Conduct, whose exemplary vertues and Great Charity and other Ac∣complishments and Advantages qualify them for the Management of an enter∣prize of this nature, would take it into their Consideration, and not only Re∣commend is to all Candid and Vertu∣ous Souls of their Acquaintance as a most Christian and truely Heroick De∣sign, but even set it on foot, in an hum∣ble Dependance on GOD for his Divine Assistances and Direction, who, we may
 he sure, will not fail to second Sopious and so Charitable a project with his effec∣tual Blessing. And who knows but that so Worthy and so great a Work, being once Happilie begun, may be Intertain'd and Countenanced by more than we are a wae of? Who knows but that these la∣tent Sparks of Zeal which may be in the Breasts of a great many, might on such an occasion be Excited and Inflam'd, and become very Instrumental to promove the Unquestionable Interests of Piety and the good of Souls? And that the long Since awakened Zeal of others, but which hath ever been misplaced, and very often a little too Stormie and Tu∣multuous, may put on a more Evange∣lical Form, and run in a Diviner Chan∣nel, forget these small and Inconsiderable things which it was once so fond of, and spent it self so unprofitable upon, and consecrat for the future its Warmth and Fervour to advance Designs more Great and Noble, more Worthy of Christianity as well as more beneficial to Mankind.
 O! how would it rejoice the Hearts of these Serious and Disinterested Souls, which perhaps are not few, who have been mournful Spectators of the Tragi∣cal Scenes of Controversie, and Disputs about Externals and Formalities? And, it may be, contributed their best Advic∣es and Endeavours for calming and mi∣tigating the exasperated Spirits of their Brethren, to see these Lamentable as well as Unsuccessfull Contentious ter∣minat and issue in this one, who shall be the most genuine and most serious Chris∣tians by a sincere Obedience to the Laws of the Gospell. And whose shall gain most Proselytes, not to the Opinions, and Modes, and In∣terests of a Faction, but to the Spirit, and Life and Practice of the Christian Religion. Thrice happy shall they be, who shall Encourage and Countenance. Begin and Carrie on a project which hath so Excellent and so Noble a Ten∣dencie as this is! How Savory and fragrant shall their Memories be to
 Succeeding Generations! and with what Joy and Holy Confidence shall they meet their Adorable Redeemer, when he comes to Judge the World in Righ∣teousness, and to Glorify and Reward His Faithful Followers?
I shall think my Time and Pains well bestowed, if any thing I have Written shall Contribute in the least to beget true Piety and Devotion, in the Hearts of either Old or Young, and to Dissi∣pat these mistakes, which hinder Peo∣ple from having just thoughts of the De∣signes of Christianity, and Dishearten or Excuse them from that Obedience to which it Indispensably oblieges. This and the forgoing Essay is but the begin∣ing of that I intend for the benefit of the Youth, to Advance whose Spiritu∣al Concerns I must own that I have a very Particular and Rooted Inclinati∣on, being convinced that the early Sea∣soning of their minds with the Maxims of Piety, is one of the best Services that can be done to the Christian World.
 If what is already done shall meet with Acceptance; I may be encouraged to pro∣secut the design at full length. Mean while I must intreat, that, when your Leasure can best allow of it, you would look into these pages, and that parti∣cularly you would consider with some at∣tention, what is said Concerning the de∣signs of the Incarnation of the Son of GOD, and Concerning His Merits and Grace, His Doctrine and Example. I am hopfull that under each Head you will meet with some things not unwor∣thy of your Notice.
But now Right Honourable, it is time that I give a check to these too Eager Inclinations which I have to Leng∣then the Satisfaction I find in Convers∣ing with you by this Address, and has∣ten to a close, least I should too Rudely Eucroach upon your Patience; Tho, I as∣sure my self that you have the Goodness to construct Candidly of the Expres∣sions of Sincere and Affectionat Respects, however Indiscreetly they may seem to
 be Managed. It is my Hearty Prayer, that as your Honourable Faculty hath always made no Small Part of the Hon∣our and Glory of the Nation, so its Lustre may Continually Increase, and its Usefulness still more and more Conspi∣cuously appear, while it Subsists in Your Persons, by Your being Vigorously Instrumental to promove Impartially all the interests of Truth and Righteous∣ness, of Peace and Piety, and the Pro∣sperity and Welfare of Your Countrey.
Farewell.
