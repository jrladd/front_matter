MOurning as well as many (right Worshipfull La∣die) for the late losse of the right Honorable your deceased Vnckle, whose death being the common preiudice of a present age, was lamented of most (if not all) and I among the rest sorrowing that my Countrie was depriued of him that liued not for himselfe, but for his Countrie, I began to call to mind what a sub∣iect was ministred to the excellent wits of both Vniuersities to work vpon, when so worthie a knight, and so vertuous a Iusticiarie, had by his death left many memorable actions performed in his life, de∣seruing highly by some rare men to be registred. Passing ouer many daies in this muse, at last I perceiued mens humors slept, that loue of many friends followed no farther then their graues, that Art was growen idle, and either choice schollers feared to write of so high a subiect as his vertues, or else they dated their deuotions no further then his life. While thus I debated with my selfe, I might see (to the great disgrace of the Poets of our time) some Mycanicall wits blow vp mountaines, and bring forth mise, who with their follies did ra∣ther disparage his Honors, than decypher his vertues: beside, as Virtutis comes est inuidia, so base report who hath her tong bli∣stered by slanderous enuie, began as farre as she durst, now after his death, to murmure, who in his life time durst not once mutter: whervpon touched with a Zealous iealousie ouer his wonderfull ver∣tues, I could not, whatsoeuer discredit I reapt by my presumption, al∣though I did Tenui Auena meditari, but discouer the honorable

qualities of so worthie a Counsellor, not for anie priuat benefit I euer had of him, which should induce me fauorably to flatter his worthie partes, but onely that I shame to let slip with silence, the vertues and honors of so worthie a knight, whose deserts had bin so many and so great towards al. Therfore (right worshipful Ladie) I drewe a fictiō called A Maidens Dreame, which as it is Enigmaticall, so it is not without some speciall and considerate reasons. Whose slender Muse I present vnto your Ladiship, induced therunto, first, that I know you are partaker of your husbands sorrowes, for the death of his honourable Vncle, and desire to heare his honors put in memo∣rie after his death, as you wished his aduancement in vertues to be great in his life: as also that I am your Ladiships poore Countrimā, and haue long time desired to gratifie your right worshipfull father with some thing worthie himselfe. Which because I could not to my content performe, I haue now taken oportunitie to shew my duetie to him in his daughter, although the gift be farre too meane for so worshipfull and vertuous a Lady. Yet hoping your Ladishippe will with courtesie fauour my presuming follies, and in gratious acceptance vouch of my well meant labours, I humbly take my leaue.
