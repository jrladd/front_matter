COnsidering with my selfe, Right Honorable, and right Worshipfull, that nothing is more necessary, nor more desired in the time of dan∣gerous sicknesse and perill of death, then to present vnto the person so standing, the meanes to preserue him from the violence of the same, and to restore the sick from imminent perill of death, vnto his former estate of health; and perceiuing, right Honorable, that no man had as yet written any treatise, wherein was contained such speciall and

excellent medicines, that might be able to resist, and also cure this dangerous and contagious sick∣nesse; and likewise to giue sufficient instruction & direction vnto the inhabitants of this Citie, for their preseruation in this infectious time: I was mooued in conscience (my Lord) for the dutie I owe, and for the loue I beare vnto this honorable city, to cōmunicate vnto them such preseruatiues, as are, through Gods grace, giuen vnto them able to resist and defend from infection of this sicknesse all such as vse thē. And also I haue set down most excellent & approued medicines, such as I haue practised and approued vnto the great vtilitie of manie, beeing able, through Gods mercy, speedi∣ly to cure the most and greatest part of al such as shall be infected with this sicknesse, beeing vsed in time, before the sicknesse hath vtterly ouercome nature. And although my insufficic̄cy to write any publique matter, perswaded me to relinquish my intēded purpose in publishing this treatise, I being the meanest of so many in this land, and vnable to write any plausible stile: yet the truth & plainnes of the matter, the excellency of the medicines, & the vtility that many should find thereby, being v∣sed, ouercame that doubt of mind, and anima∣ted me to proceede in my intended purpose; not doubting, but assuredly trusting in the Lord, frō whom commeth all health, that this beeing vsed, many shall bee preserued, and cured thereby, to Gods glory and our comfort: he it is on whom we must depend. The Lord hath created medicine ne ope diuina il valemus. of the earth, and giuen great vertue vnto trees,

hearbes, gums, stones, and minerals, and all for the helpe of his people in the time of their sicknes. God make vs thankfull vnto him for them, & giue vs grace to be warned by others punishment, and to vse thankfully and diligentlie, the good means for our health: and then I trust assuredly that the Lord will blesse our indeuours, vnto his glory, and our health' and comfort. And for as much as I haue written this treatise chiefelie in respect of the citie, I haue presumed to dedicate the same vnto your Honor, & vnto the right Worshipfull the Sheriffes and Aldermen your brethren, as a pledge of my loue and humble duty towards you: which if it shall please you to accept in good part, and vouchsafe to patronize mine indeuours, I doubt not but that manie shall finde the benefit therof to Gods glory & their great comfort: and I shall be incouraged some other time, as occasion shall be offred, to performe a work no lesse need∣full: Thus beseeching the Almightie to blesse your Honor, & the right Worshipfull your bre∣thren, with all happinesse your hearts can desire, I humblie take my leaue.
