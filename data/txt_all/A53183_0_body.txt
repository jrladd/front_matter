My Lords! And Venerable Sirs!
AS these Animadversions are made Pub∣lick without the least malice to the Person of the Observator, or design to grati∣fie any Faction, or undervalue any Services his Papers may have hereto∣fore done the Church or State; But to Rectifie certain things which he has lately advanced, that may (if they pass uncontrouled) prove injurious to the Honour and Interest of both; so they address not to you for Protection, any further than your Justice and Piety is always wont to favour Truth. And therefore (hum∣bly cast at your feet) are submitted to your grave and im∣partial Considerations and Censure; as being under God and His Majesty, the Watchful Overseers, whose especial Concern it is (in your several Stations) to take Care Ne quid detrimenti Capiat Ecclesia.
