May it please your Grace,
IT is at once both the Duty and Interest of
these Papers to beseech your Favour and
Patronage, and to beg leave to carry in their
Front a Name so sacred; as being not only
a Sanctuary from danger, and a Preservative a∣gainst
the infection and poyson of Malicious Cen∣sures;
but also so rich an Ornament, as in it self suf∣ficient
to give them that Reputation and Lustre
which of themselves they wanted, and to supply all
the Defects and Errors of the unskilful Author.
An Ambition I should confess unpardonable, were
the Temptation less, or the Subject meaner; which

in truth doth so much pertain to your Graces In∣spection,
that to have addressed themselves to any
other, had been an alienation of your Graces Pro∣perty,
and no less than Sacrilege. Which being
considered, I trust the apprehended Guilt will va∣nish;
And by that Acceptance, which your Graces
wonted Humanity promises, the Crime will borrow
another Name, and be transmuted into a Vertue.
I do not crave your Graces acceptance of these
Papers upon any score of their Merit, unto which
they dare not pretend; But do only beseech that
charitable Kindness to be extended to them,
which is due to Strangers: Especially coming so
far, and upon such an Errand, as to implore Re∣lief
for those Myriads of hungry and distressed
Souls abroad; most of them within the English
Dominion, tho without their Care; and even vast
Numbers being no other than our Peoples Slaves
and Vassals; but from whom also the Bread of
Life is most sacrilegiously detained. And by this
your Condescention and Kindness to these stran∣ger-Suppliants,
it is not impossible, but that Bles∣sing
may be repeated to you, Of entertaining An∣gels.
The dignity of their Message being suffici∣ent
to qualifie them for those Titles and Names,
which otherwise they durst not assume, and could
no way challenge.
It would be but gross Impertinence for me to
undertake to acquaint your Grace how zealous our

Ancestors were in promoting Works of this nature,
the advancement of Religion in foraign Regions,
even beyond their own Power, and Jurisdiction.
Nor need I to mention how some others do make
this very thing an Essential Mark of the Catholic
Church, and from thence would prove their Reli∣gion
true, and ours, at the same time, false: And
do therefore conclude that they have sufficient
grounds to unchurch us, and to determine us no
Christian Nation. Nor shall I go about to paral∣lel
our Crime with that of the Ancient Britains, it
being indeed much blacker; of whom yet Gildas
complains (as a most grievous Impiety), that they
never took care to preach the Gospel to the English
and Saxons, their (not Domestics and Vassals, which
these, we speak of, are, but) most cruel Invaders
and Oppressors; and even to this he ascribes his
Peoples and Countries overthrow. But instead
thereof shall offer up my Prayers at the Throne of
Mercy, that the like fatal, (but infinitely less excu∣sable,)
Neglect of our People abroad, not to say
at Home also, may not prove alike Ominous, nor
hasten the accomplishment of those Evils, which
have so lately threatned, and do still hang over
us; and of which, 'tis possible, that very mischie∣vous
and scandalous Neglect has been the
prime occasion. And at the same time bemoan
our hard Lot to be born and live in an Age
so utterly barren of those Rich Fruits, with
which the former did so abound: And that when

the most opposite Parties do compass Sea and Land
to make Proselytes, We only are charged with the
Neglect, I shall not add the opposing of it; that
being the Crime of such degenerated English, who
with that air, have imbibed the Barbarity and Hea∣thenism
of the Countries they live in: And with
whom, through the want of Discipline, Christi∣anity
doth seem to be wholly lost, and nothing but
Infidelity to have come in its place.
And thus, I have given your Grace the Mo∣tives
inviting me to this bold attempt, together
with tbose other for this Publication; which as∣suredly
will not prove ineffectual whilst your Grace
shall continue what you have always been: It being
impossible that that flame of Religious Zeal, which
hath hitherto so vigorously acted in your Grace,
should be Extinguished whilst you are alive; But
must needs excite you to further endeavours for
the good of Souls, tho at a remoter distance than
both the India's; or that you should suffer a thing
of that Consequence for to sleep. Which doubt∣less
will give you a Name in the blessed Records of
Eternity, equal to those Primitive Pious Bishops
and holy Patriarchs, who have been most Industrious
and Vigilant in publishing the Doctrine, and
promoting the Service of their Lord and Savi∣our.
But I begin to be tedious, nor will your
Graces occasions of greatest Moment, admit of

unnecessary Avocations: Wherefore (to avoid
being further troublesome) I shall humbly sub∣mit
this whole Affair to your Graces Wisdom
and Conduct, and no less my self to your dispo∣sal:
As being
My Lord,
