AT your Command this Ser∣mon
was Preached, by
your Order it hath been
Printed, and now its
humbly offered to your
hands, and under your
Honourable Patronage made Publque to
the view of the world. I know well that
the same Sermon, as to the life of it, is
scarcely the same in the hearing, and in the
reading: But that acceptation which it
found when it came frō the Pulpit, gives

me hope that it will not be cast aside, as
disrelishing or unprofitable; now its
come from the Presse. The Lord com∣mand
a blessing along with it unto you,
and make you and your unwearied la∣bours,
a blessing to the Church and King∣dome.
So prays
Your most unworthy servant
in the work of the Ministerie.
