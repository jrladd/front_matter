SIR,
THat I have prefix'd your Honour'd Name to this Discourse, will not (I am confident) be displeasing to you, for as much as in it I plead that Cause, for which you have ex∣press'd so great a Concern: When the E∣nemies of the Royal Family were at the highest, puff't up with the vain hopes of gaining their so much desired Point, the Exclusion of his Royal Highness, When they reviled and treated the Opposers of that wicked Project at their pleasure: even then, as became a Person of Eminent Courage and Loyalty, you declared your just Indignation against, and condemn'd it as a most impious Device.
And seeing one great design of this Discourse, is to prove the Bill of Exclu∣sion to be as unjust as you have always thought it, to whom with greater Reason can this that I have writ address it self for protection, than to a Person of such known and unquestion'd Loyalty, you be∣ing One of those Brave and Loyal Persons, that truly honour and heartily desire the Felicity of the King and his most Glori∣ous
 Family, and this in so high a degree that you have suffer'd for it, been most un∣justly deprived of a considerable part of your Birth-right for no other cause at all, but your Devotion to your Prince, and Zeal for his Service? But hereby you will be no looser in the end, because God Al∣mighty, I am sure, will bless and prosper you, and all good men do, and will love and honour you.
Besides, your good opinion of this Discourse that it will be serviceable to the Great Ends I writ it for, encouraged me to make it publick, and to put it into the World under your Patronage, not doubt∣ing but you will accept that, which you were pleased to entertain such favourable thoughts of.
Hereby also I have an opportunity o∣penly to acknowledg my great obligations to you, and beseech you to receive this as a Testimony of my Gratitude for the many and undeserved civilities with which you have treated me, which if you please to do, I shall ever own it an high favour to him, that hath the greatest rea∣son to Subscribe himself,
Sir,
