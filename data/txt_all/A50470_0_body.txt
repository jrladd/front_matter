Worthy Patroness!
IT was an inviolable De∣cree among the Aegyp∣tians, that every Physitian should have but one Disease for his Province; whereby is meant, that he was to employ his utmost Industry,
in order to improve his Fa∣culty for the good of Man∣kind: And now adays too, it is so far from being thought an Absurdity so to do, that the best of Professors are not ashamed (but esteem it re¦quisite and highly conduci∣ble) to make a particular Scrutiny into the knowledge of some one Distemper, e∣minently above others, ac∣cording to the Inclination of their natural Genius.
Our learned Author is not herein to be excepted; for albeit he was a person of ex∣tensive parts, and was blest
with a more than ordinary Capacity; yet did he signa∣lize his Practice by a more particular Enquiry into the true Cause and Cure of the RICKETS, an af∣ter long Observation and Experience (that others might reap advantage from his Labours and Study,) published a Tract of this Disease: I having perused the same and well weighed what was written, I was heartily solicitous to com∣municate it in our Mother-Tongue, to Posterity, that it might become more ge∣nerally
useful, and diffusive to the Intelligence of such as have the Care of Children, and particularly to Mid∣wives who ought to be of good Understanding, and to abound with great Noti∣on relating to Medicines ex∣hibited to Children, touch∣ing whose Infirmities it is a most usual thing to have recourse to them.
Now having (by the Di∣vine Assistance) compleat∣ed this Undertaking, I did after mature Deliberation, think fit to make a Dedica∣tion of this small Treatise to
you, having so great esteem for you, that I blush not to acquaint the World in short, that in what you Profess, appertaining either to Wo∣men or Children, (before, or in, or after the Birth,) you are so well Experienc'd, Dextrous and truly Judici∣ous, that you may be justly styled, the Oxonian LƲ∣CINA, or Compleat Mid∣wife, What I have done as to the Appendix of Weights and Measures, I nowise doubt but the same will prove more delightful and satisfactory, than what in the
Writings of any other Eng∣lish Author is yet extant. So commiting the same to your Patronage, I subscribe my self
