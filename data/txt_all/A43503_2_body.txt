YOur late respects to me have com∣manded my Soul to serve you: and knowing you are aswell a Philoso∣pher and Learned, as a Souldier that can command Armies of orse and Foot into good order for War; I there∣fore humbly present this little Piece of Philoso∣phy to your pleasure: As the Book is Art and ature united to serve you, so the Epistle may ake you merry, by the great power of Natural ings, for you know they not onely work upon all things that are neer them by their Vertue, but so besides this, they infuse into them a like ower, through which by the same Vertue they so work upon other things, as in the Load∣one, which stone doth not onely draw Iron ings, but also infuseth a Vertue into the Rings themselves, whereby they can do the same: Af∣r this manner it is, that the common Harlots nd Villains, grounded daily in boldness and im∣dence in Stage-Plays, infect all that are neer
them by this property; whereby the spectors are made like them, therefore they say that if any one shall put on the inward Garments of a Stage-Player, or shall have about him that Looking-glass which they daily look into, he shall become bold, Confident, Ignorant, Impudent and Wan∣ton; so a Cloth that was about a dead Corps, makes him that carries it sad and melancholy: And if you put a Green Lizard made blind, to∣gether with Iron or Gold Rings into a Glass Ves∣sel, putting under them some earth, shutting then the Vessel; and when it appears that the Lizard hath received his sight, shall put them out of the Glass, that those Rings shall help sore eyes; the same may be done with Gold Rings: and a Weesel, whose eyes with any kind of prick are put out, it is certain are restored to sight again; upon the same account Rings are put for a cer∣tain time in the Nest of Sparrows or Swallows which afterwards are used to procure Love and Favor: These observations and ten thousand more I made to serve you, and they shall testifie, you shall know you have power to command,
