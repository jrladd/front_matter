IT is not from any Tincture of Am∣bition, that I presume upon this Dedication to You (Great Sirs) but from the Congruity of an Appeal I ought to make to some of great Judg∣ment in all the Matters here menti∣oned. Now as to the Report I make of new Discoveries among the Hea∣venly Bodies, which may perhaps seem strange to many, I appeal to You as to most authentick Witnesses: And touching the Consequences which on those Grounds I infer, which are many of them of no small Importance, You are most competent Judges. Con∣cerning the Gout-Raptures; they re∣fer to the same Subject, though they are Notions mainly founded on Fan∣cy, and have been some years abroad in the World. Having met with
Acceptation among such as are Learn∣ed, I have been encouraged to send them out again Augmented and Im∣proved, and do think them not im∣proper to be tack'd together in one Piece. I submit all to your grave Judgment, as to a High Court of E∣quity, which will neither heed nor need the verdict of the Vulgar. If my weak Endeavours herein find Ac∣ceptance with You, and shall have the Honour of Your Approbation, it will facilitate its Passage to the Pub∣lick, to which I hope in some respect it may be useful; and then I have the Reward of my Labours, and shall be encouraged to continue, as in truth I am,
Sirs,
