MY LORD,
MEN send out Books as Children of their Laborious brains, to present to the world the Images of their Parents, and thence to derive to themselves Commendations, and Prayse, where they are unknowne: but this I aim not at (if Children alwaies resemble their Parents) be∣ing very conscious of my own defor∣mities. Others by them as their pa∣per
Bellowes endevour to blow up the dying sparks of Dissentions in Churches and Common-wealths: and as to this my Book submits to your Lordships judgement: and in∣deed such persons with their papers deserve the corruption of wormes, whose cold humours should rather feed on them, than their fire eat out the life & strength of others. How∣ever, that Books might passe more safely, they walk under the pro∣tection of severall Personages of Ho∣nour and worth; yet protection this desires not (though never more needed than in this crititall and di∣chotomizing age) hoping its subject will be its guard, if the Reader carry the same eye and spirit as the Au∣thor. Others devove their Labours by way of gratitude to such Patrons
as have obliged by some speciall fa∣vours, deserving persons to them∣selves. My Lord, this is the intent of the unworthy Author, who de∣sires to lay his works at those feet where he owes himselfe: and in this I must make use of the pologeticall wish of a Learned man, whereof he had not so little need, but I have as much:In prooem: E∣pisc: Cicisten sis prae Euseb Ʋtinam facultas (sayth he) in agendo voluntati in cupiendo respon∣disset; sed fortasse (ut Cleon apud Thucydidem) majora sprabam quàm vires facilè tulerint, sed minora quàm voluntas. And I hope your Lord∣ship will the more favourably ac∣cept it, in that it is the language of such a spirit as really carries on the person to tread his written lins: and as the same Author speaks of Euse∣bius recording the sufferings of the
Saints, so hee wishes in this of the peace of the Saints amongst us, res ita in (hoc) verbis exprimuntur, ut non demonstrari sed geri (& à me & omni∣bus) & ante oculos statui videantur.
My Lord, its sayd of the Hethen Roman, that hee had one Temple dedicated to Vertue, and another to Honour; before men ascended the latter, he must passe thorow the for∣mer: this speaks as much to the Ci∣vill Magistrate as the Souldier. I shall not cause it to look back upon your Honour, whose sober and mo∣dest thoughts (if I be able rightly to judge) are such, that you had rather keep before your eyes your memento mori, then your memoriae sacrum: yet I may not conceal that care you have to preserve the standing, and tender∣nesse over the lapsing Christian, who
bears upon him a reall image of god∣linesse. I have also read of a Chri∣stian Roman, Constantine the pattern of Princes,Scrat. schl l 1, c 12, p 338 and all Supream Magi∣strates, that built in Constantinople two other Temples or Churches, the one called by the name of the Apostles, the other of Peace: These speak to us subjects; hee that hath been well taught and abides in the doctrin of the Apostles, shall ascend the staires and obtain the chaire of peace: The first is soon entred by many, but take only a turn or two in it, and so out again: who never truly attain unto or delight in the latter: Yet let the Magistrate build the first, and the subject will erect the second; and let him defend the Temple of the Apostles in peace, and the Apostles will keep the Temple of Peace: that
so both of them might be united: for as we read, Psal. 77. ult. Thou didst lead thy people like a flock by the hands of Moses and Aaron, Bajad: as if the Magistrate and Minister were so co-assistant and co-existent in & for the peaceable & secure guidance, and rule of the rest of the subjects, and people of God, as if they had but one hand, one way, one power: to which that your Honour and the rest of the Honourable Councellors consultati∣ons, and undertakings might be di∣rected, shall be the prayer of
