Most Reverend Father and Reverend Brethren;
WHen we received your Papers, and were told that they conteined not onely an Answer to our Excepions a∣gainst the present Liturgie; But also several Con∣cessions, wherein you seem willing to joyn with us in the Alteration & Reformation of it; Our expectations were so far raised, as that we promised our selves, to find your Concessions so considerable, as would have greatly conduced to the healing of our much to be lamented Divisions, the setling of the Nation in Peace, and the satisfaction of tender Consciences, according to his Majesties most gracious Declaration, and his Royal Commis∣sion in pursuance thereof: But having taken a survey of them, we find our selves exceedingly disappointed, and that they will fall far short of attaining those happy Ends, for which this Meeting was first de∣signed; as may appear both by the paucity of the Concessions, and the inconsiderablenesse of them, they being for the most part, Verbal, and Literal, rather then Real, and Substantial; for in them you allow not the laying aside of the reading of the Apochrypha for Lessons,
 though it shut out some hundreds of Chapters of Holy Scripture, and sometimes the Scripture it self is made to give way to the Apocryphal Chapters; you plead against the addition of the Doxologie unto the Lord's Prayer, you give no Liberty to omit the too frequent repetition of Gloria Patri, nor of the Lord's Prayer in the same publick Service, nor do you yield the Psalmes be read in the new Translation, nor the word Piest to be changed for Minister or Presbyter, though both have been yielded unto in the Scottish Liturgie; you grant not the omis∣sion of the Responsals, no not in the Letanie it self, though the Peti∣tions be so framed, as the People make the Prayer, and not the Mi∣nister; nor to read the Communion Service in the Desk, when there is no Communion, But in the late Form instead thereof, it is enjoyned to be done at the Table, though there be no Rubrick in the Common Payer Book requiring it; you plead for the Holiness of Lent, con∣trary to the Statute; you indulge not the omission of any one Ceremo∣nie; you will force men to kneel at the Sacrament, and yet not put in that excellent Rubr. in the v. and vj. of Edw. 6. which would much conduce to the satisfaction of many that scruple it. And whereas di∣vers Reverend Bishops and Doctours, in a Paper in Print before these unhappy Warres began, yielded to the laying aside of the Crosse, and the making many material alteration you after xx. years sad Calamities & Divisions, seem unwilling to grant what they of their own accord then offered; you seem not to grant that the Clause of the fourth Command∣ment in the Common Prayer Book (the Lord blessed the seventh day) should be altered according to the Hebr. Exod. 20. the Lord blessed the Sabbath day; you will not change the word Sunday into the Lord's day, nor adde any thing to make a difference between Holidayes that are of Humane Institution; and the Lord's day, that is questionlesse of Apostolical practice; you will not alter Deadly Sin in the Letanie into Heynous Sin, though it hints to us that some Sinnes are in their own nature Venial; nor that Answer in the Catech. of two Sacra∣ments onely generally necessary to salvation, although it intimates that there are other New Testament Sacraments, though Two onely necessary to Salvation; you speak of singing David's Psalmes, allowed by Authorite, by way of Contempt calling them Hopkins Psalmes; And though singing of Psalmes be an Ordinance of God, yet you call it one of our principal parts of Worship, as if it were disclaimed by you. And are so far from countenancing the use of conceived Prayer in the publick Worship of God (though we never intended thereby the exclu∣ding of set Formes) as that you seem to dislike the use of it even in the
 Pulpit, and heartily desire a total restraint of it in the Church; you will not allow the omission of the Benedicite, nor a Psalm to be read instead of it; nor so much as abate the reading of the Chapters out of the Old Testament, and the Acts for the Epistles; But rather then you will gratifie us therein, you have found out a new Device, that the Minister shall say (for the Epistle) you will not so much as leave out in the Collect; for Christmass day these words (this day) though at least, it must be a great uncertaintie, and cannot be true stylo ve∣teri, & novo. In publick Baptism you are so far from giving a Li∣bertie to the Parent to Answer for his own Child (which seems most reasonable) as that you force him to the use of Sureties, and cause them to answer in the name of the Infant, that he doth believe, and repent, and forsake the Devil and all his worke, which doth much favour the Anabaptistical Opinion for the necessitie of an Actual profession of Faith and Repentance in order to Baptism; you will not leave the Minister in the Visitation of the Sick to use his judgement of discre∣tion in Absolving the Sick person, or in giving the Sacrament to him, but enjoyn both of them, though the Person to his own judgement seem never so unfit; neither do you allow the Minister to pronounce the Absolution in a Declarative and Conditional way; but absolute∣ly, and inconditionately. And even in one of your Concessions in which we suppose you intend to accommodate with us, you rather widen then heal the Breach, for in your last Rubr. before the Catech. you would have the words thus altered, That Children being baptized, have all things necessary for salvation, and dying before they commit any actual sin, be undoubtedly saved, though they be not Confirmed, which Assertion, if understood of all Infants, even of heathen, is certainly false; and if onely of the Infants of Christians, is doubtfull and con∣trary to the judgement of many learned Protestants, and will give lit∣tle satisfaction to us or others; some more we might name, which for brevities sake we omit: All which considered we altogether de∣spair of that happy success which Thousands hope and wait for from this his Majesties Commission; unless God shall incline your hearts for the Peace and Union of the Nation to a more considerable and satis∣factory alteration of the Liturgie. In which that we may the better prevail, we here tender an Answer to your Reply, both against our general and particular Exceptions, of which we desire a serious peru∣sal, and candid interpretation. We have divided both your Preface and Reply into several Sections, that so you might more easily understand to which of the particulars both in the one and in the other our An∣swer doth refer.
