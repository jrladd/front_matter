LVcius a famous Roman meeting on a time with the Emperor Marcus, asked him whither he went: who answered, I am going to Sextus, vt discam quod nondum scio, that I may learne that which I doe not yet know. Diogenes the philosopher went to Athens to Antisthenes to learne of him somewhat that he was ignorant of; but Antisthenes not willing to im∣part at that time any of his doctrine, repulsed him: the other left not off his purpose, but more and more importuned him in such sort, that Antisthenes taking vp a staffe to driue him away, Diogenes stretched out his necke, willing him to strike on hardly, for he should not finde a staffe so hard, that could driue him from him so long as he might learne any matter by him woorthie the hearing. I speake this Gentlemen, meaning none of you to be bound by their example, seeing one was an Emperor and might doe what he list, and the other a Cinick philosopher that would doe that he ought: therefore if a man haue any learning or qualitie, let him bring it to you, and if it be too tedious vnto you, or hinder your sport, rather then be troubled with him, bob him or flout and scoffe him away. Be not imitators of Demosthenes which spent more oyle in the lampe in studying to enrich his minde, then wine to comfort his bodie; but rather waste your wine and spare your candles: neither be so foolish as Cleanthes the philosopher, that drew water in the night that he might follow his studie in the day; rather take your ease in the night and your pleasure in the day, because Mutantur tempora & nos mutamur in illis. Yet Gentlemen, if you doe but set before your eies these famous men, which haue beene and are of the house you now remaine in, (the names of some few I can now recite) as Sir Nicholas Ba∣con Lord Keeper, Lord Burleigh Lord Treasurer, Sir Walter Mildmay and Sir Francis Walsingham, learned Fitzherbert Lord chiefe Iustice of the common
 pleas which abridged the law, and Sir William Stanford, which wrote the pleas of the crowne, Sergeant Yeluerton, Sergeant Daniell, Sergeant Spurling, Master Brograue, Master Stanhop, Master Hesquit, Master Anthonie and Master Francis Bacon, with diuers others might well mooue you to consider that, Qui veult plus qu'vn autre valoir, doibt plus qu'vn autre scavoir: He that will be esteemed aboue another man, must haue more knowledge then another man: And Meglio esser mendicante che ignorante, Better to bee a begger then barren of good letters. But these letters are painefully purchased, why Petit ardua virtus; Difficilis virtutis via; Difficilia quae pulchra: Therefore Pythagoras coun∣selled his familiar friendes that they should choose out the best kinde of life, al∣though the most difficult: and Salust saith, deckings pertaine to women, and trauels belong to men: and Seneca affirmeth, that base is that honor which is gotten with idlenes, which the Roman pollicie when it flourished confirmed by an auncient lawe duly kept, that euery father that had children of the age of tenne yeeres should become suretie for them, that they shoulde not liue idle, or commit any excesse, which was so neerely looked vnto, that they publikely chastised Cato the Censors sonne for a saucines committed, and banished a brother of good old Ciña for liuing idlie among them. None durst presume to go into the streetes but hee carried some token in his hande what kinde of life or studie hee follo∣wed, which if in these times it were in force, how many streete walkers woulde re∣tire themselues to some vertuous studies. But me thinke I heare some saie, Ars lon∣ga & vita brevis, I answere them with the Thebane Philosopher, which in the 75. Olympiade, came to the solemne sports kept about the citie Olympia in honor of Iu∣piter, who had made all the apparell he ware with his owne hands: his shooes he had sowed his shirt he had wouen, &c. being demanded where he had learned so manie mens arts, answered, In the beginning there was but one arte at all, & that the sloth of men had caused that one to be diuided into many, and how euerie particular man with diligence and labour might obtaine to the knowledge of that that all men in ge∣nerall had knowledge of.Pythagoras. To this purpose Pythagoras said, He that knoweth not what he ought to know, is a brute beast among men: He that knoweth no more then he hath need of, is a man among brute beasts: He that knoweth al that may be knowen, is a God among men. So many examples present themselues that ra∣ther time would faile then matter herein, & for that my case standeth now rather to demand remedie and not giue counsell, or to giue thankes for good turnes receiued, and not prescribe precepts, I thinke good briefely and plainely to shew vnto you how hauing founde my selfe beholding to some of you, whom I had read vnto in the toongs, I thought nothing could better agree with my profession as to shewe my gratefull minde towards you, then by labouring for your ease, in these instructions of the Spanish toong: which if they be thankefully receiued, I shall thinke my labour well imploied. Yet before I coulde make an ende of this and the Dictiona∣rie, I did as Robertus Stephanus saith of himselfe in gathering togither his Dictionaries called Thesaurus linguae Graecae & Latinae; I haue made Thesau∣rum, that is, a Treasure for others, but thereby haue made my selfe a bagger, where∣of some of the right vertuous and woorthie gentlemen of that your house, (to whom I am most beholding, and therefore stande most in affection bounde) vn∣derstanding,
 wished me to goe forewarde in so good a woorke, and not to giue ouer for some wants: which then of themselues they supplied, whose good kindnes if I forget, I wish the law of Draco, (which was to punish with death, if there were any found so vnthankfull as not to requite a good turne, or at least to forbeare to acknowledge his benefactors for the same) might be inflicted on me: for there can be no greater iniurie offered to a free minde, then to bee reputed ingratefull: al∣though in these daies fower as great euils left vnpunished as those that are puni∣shed, Vntemperatenes, Vnshamefastnes, Vnfaithfulnes, and Vnthankefulnes. But to begin with my benefactors in this worke in order as they began with mee in Graies Inne, first Master William Willoughby, a gentleman as vertuouslie minded and of as good carriage as the rest: next Master Henrie Bing, whose ex∣cellent learning, placed togither with such gentlemanlike conditions, makes him be∣loued among the Elders, and honored among the yoonger sort: after him Master Frances Barneham, and Master Iames Hewes, endued with exceeding good wits, and no lesse good natures: I may not forget the good woorths of Master Ro∣bert Hill, and Master Cheeke, gentlemen well studied in the most commendable kindes of learning: Master Dauison of excellent learning, wit and vertues: Ma∣ster Helmes and Master Gill both for their good parts better knowne then I can heere set downe: Master Thomas Mason, and Master Iohn Roberts, adorned with ornaments of languages, to their other learning and vertues: Master Archer as he is well read in language, so is he a good fauourer of learning. The rest of the well accomplisht yoong gentlemen whom I know not, I saie of them as my minde is towards them best: Gentlemen, if for these praises you shall one plaie on ano∣ther, I pray you cast all on mee, for I protest none of them euer knewe that I ment to write vnto them, much lesse put any of their names in print. Thus wishing to you as much as Cicero writing to his friend Atticus, would limite to be wished to his deerest friends, viz. To enioy health, to possesse honor, and neuer to suffer want, I rest:
