RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL;
I Should much forget my selfe, if (whilst I presse others to Good∣nesse & Mercy) I should forget yours to my natiue Country; Campden in Glouc. shyre. there you haue done good, (to the house of God) not onely in out∣ward buildings and ornaments, M. Lilly. but in set∣ling a Preacher, where before was none, and such a one as cannot easily be equalled in eminency of gifts: There also, you haue
exercised (Mercy) in building such an Almes-house, as that, I know not what may be added thereto, vnlesse hereafter, you shall see cause to set over the blind and lame, and deafe (who are lesse able to repaire to, and profit by the publique Ministery) a more private Teacher and Catechist. Sir, I thanke God, I could never yet the Art of flattery, neither will your Wisedome (if I know you) brooke the trade. It sufficeth, that I haue in a line or two recommended to o∣thers practise your example; and conveyed to Posteritie, my thankfulnesse, with your bountie. If God make me able, I shall (haply) doe it hereafter in a better manner, In the meane, I beseech you to accept my present thankes wrapt vp in a dead Let∣ter, and sicke Epistle, and still continue to loue his Country, who still rests
