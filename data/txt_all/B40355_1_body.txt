DOctor Henry Bul∣linger (right worthy Lord) the minister of our Churche heer at Zurick, whose doctrin and godlynes is right wel knowen vnto you: hath set foorth in these dayes An ex¦hortatiō to all the ministers of Christes Church, that setting a parte all contro∣sies they might now and last preach true faith in Christe and amendment of life. Which when I had diligētly perused, ta∣ken councel & conferēce with the author him selfe, I determined to translate the same out of Dutch into Latin, and so in the name of vs both to dedicate it to your worthynesse. For sith your honor hath hother vnto by sundry meanes testified your good wil and looue towards vs, and that which is moste déer vnto vs, doo day∣ly set foorth your great and earnest zeale in defending and spreading abrode of
 true and holsom doctrin, we supposed that this simple, yet sincere testimonie of our dutie would not be vnpleasant vnto your Lordship and that cheefly because of the matter héerin contained. For how much more excellent your zeale is touching the preseruation of true doctrin: so much the more without all dout doo these so many and so gréeuo{us} cōtentions & discords trou∣ble you, wherby the professors of the same pure doctrin are at war the one with the other, to the great offence of a number of simple men & such as are not yet through¦ly established in true faith. Furthermore sith about two yéeres past, the ministers of your Churches consented and agreed in one, and the same confession of faith which differeth not from the confession of Heluetia, Rhetia, Sabaudia, France, Eng¦land and Scotland, and so by that menes many controuersies beeing quite taken a¦way and ended which doo yet trouble and vex this our countrey of Germany, esta∣blished and confirmed mutuall peace and concord amongst thē selues, we (tru∣ly) thought by speaking thus vnto you to showe how glad wee were of the good
 successe of all your Churches and to giue an euident and manifest token of our ioy which we haue cōceiued by this your mutuall concord so firmely established, supposing that the endenors of such whi∣che are the Authors and exhorters of o∣ther Churches to the same concord and v∣nitie would be likewise acceptable vnto them, and that the trauail of this woork wherin the fountains of discorde are dis∣couered, & waies how to establish peace wisely disclosed, should neither be vain, nor vnprofitable, to take away if any dis∣corde yet remain, and so vtterly extin∣guish the blasphemous heresies of Samo∣satenus, and Photinus with the which many Churches are troubled euen at this time.
I am not ignorant how scoffingly Osius and others of that here triumph, against our Churches by reason of these discords, how wunderfully they brag of the vnitie of their Church by meanes wherof they perswade that they onely are the Catho∣lick Church whiche all men ought to fol∣low with their eies fast closed to doo what she commaundeth.

 But these their trifles and swelling b¦bles of vanitie are long since confute and the foundations found ouer weak whereon they séeke to establish the rui¦nous buildings of the rotten Romain s¦nagog. There is none which hath neue so little a taste in the doctrin of the prim¦tiue Churche, and that whiche afte the writings of the Apostles and Pro¦phets hath laboured, the writings of th fathers (whose authoritie hath eue¦more béen regarded) which may not eas¦ly sée in how many things the papistical Religion in these dayes disagréeth fro the doctrin and maner of gouernment o the primatiue Churches, to wit, the an¦cient Apostolick Church euen from th time of the Apostles by the space of 157 yéeres, he may knowe that; that mona¦chie of the Romain Bishop whiche he challengeth as his proper ouer all com¦mon weales and Churches agréeth no with the primatiue Churche: sith th Churches of Affrica so constantly resis¦ted in times past Bonifacius ye pope wh in the time of Saint Augustine affected the like tiranny, yea and the Grecian
 neur receiued it. Let those things I pray you which are taught in the popish scho∣les and Churches touching Iustification and merit{is} of woorks and frée wil be com¦pared with the writings of Saint Au∣gustine whome all men confesse to be a Catholick doctor and then shall it right e∣uidently appéer how far vncatholick those doctors are.
The abstinence from meats whiche the Churche of Roome hath established by lawes, I wil then confesse tobe Catho∣lick, when they shall euidently prooue vn¦to me that Montanus was a Catholick Doctor, for euen from his oppinion and iudgement dooth Tertullian fetch argu∣ments (euen such as the Papists doo) a∣gainst the Psichians by whiche name in times past the Catholick and faithfull were called by the Montanistes as by Clemens Alexandrinus it dooth mani∣festly appéer. If they wil haue the vse of Images catholick in Churches, then let them first confesse that Epiphanius was not a Catholick, who euidently affirm∣eth it to be a detestable abhomination to haue the Image of Christe or any other
 Saint painted in the Churches of th Christians. Yea, let them deny Elibert¦num tobe called a Catholick whiche for¦biddeth to paint on the walles the thing that is worshipped. If their Masse b Catholick, then is not the Pope Gelasiu a Catholick, who affirmeth that the sub¦stance of bread and wine so remainet in the Sacrament of the Lords Supp euen as in Christe dooth safely & soundly remain his two natures. Yea, neither Gelasius nor Cipriane shalbe catholick which vtterly condemne the deuiding the Sacraments, so as moste sharply th one of them punisheth with excommuni¦cation all such as béeing contented with the one parte or kinde of the Sacrament abstained from the other.
But to wade through all their trumpe¦ries were infinit. For in déed in times past so far did the Scholes of the deuines departe from the Scriptures and fathers that now they are ashamed of a number of things whiche before they publikely taught, so as a certain famouse Doctor calleth these the contentious Doctors out of whose writīg{is} we may not iudge what
 is the doctrin of the church. And although they séem after a certain sort to agree a∣mongst them selues, yet may not this consent whiche dissenteth from the vni∣tie of the Scripture, purchace vnto them the authoritie of the Catholick Churche sith they so many wayes disagrée with the Scriptures whiche is the onely rule of the Church of Christe which onely is the true Catholick Church.
Christe saith, his shéep heare his voice and God the Father from Heauen com∣maundeth vs to hear Christe. But these men commaund vs to folow and acknow¦ledge the voice of the Churche, whiche Church if it gaue eare to ye voise of Christ it were tollerable, but now in stéed of Christes Churche, they thrust vpon vs that Church which acknoledgeth the Roo¦mish Pope tobe her hed and is gouerned by him, the chéef members whereof are the sworen Souldiers of the Pope, the Cardinalls and Bishops, in this Church they promise vs peace and tranquilitie, if wee depend wholly on the onely faith therof and holde fast the Colliers faith so highly commended by Osius, who béeing
 asked what he beleued, answered: that h beleeued the very self same thing, whic the Catholick Church beleueth, and bée¦ing asked again what that Church belée¦ueth, he answered, she beléeueth the ver self same thing that he beléeueth, and o¦ther answere then this could they ge none of him. This answere and faith (God wot) dooth Osius commend abooue the moon, and so in sted of the liuely faith he thrusteth vpon vs his childish trifles: but if any man that were accused of true Religion, should be brought to examina¦tion before the inquisits, and Osius should hear him answere thus: that hee throughly beleeued all those thing{is} which are contained in the holy writings of the Prophets and Apostles, the sum wherof is cōtained in ye Apostles créed, he would not be contented with this confession, nor attribute suche honor to the holy Scrip¦ture giuen to vs from God that he would absolue and acquite him from heresy that would make this confession: he would paraduenture say, that this man did not rightly vnderstand the Scriptures, that he wrested the testimonies of them to
 confirme his euill conceiued oppinions (and so paraduenture this may be aptly spoken of some who abuse the holy Scrip¦tures) and may not I pray you by the like reason the colliers faith be a cloke for errors? for paraduenture vnto the Colli∣ar the Churche may séeme to beléeue one thing, and vnto Osius she may séem to be¦leeue an other.
And truely if there cannot any sure or certain thing be determined by ye woords of the holy Scripture how plain so euer they be: how can there then be any thing determined by the woords of the Church? For it must néeds bee that this sure and catholick faith of their Churche must be showed vnto vs, to be layed vp either in the writings of the fathers, or decrées of Councels, or of the popish law or finally in some vn written verities, traditions, and the bosom and chest of the popes hart or of his members. But that there is more light, authoritie and trueth in these writings, then in those that are written by the holy Ghoste, they shall neuer be a∣ble to say. If they call back to traditions, who séeth not what an vncertain and slippery
 foundation they lay, sith in all Churches there was neuer at one time the like tr¦ditions, except by the name of traditio they vnderstand, as the ancient Father did the Apostles créed. But if they brin vs back to the Chest of the Popes bres that now the same must néeds be ver christian whiche the Pope at any tim with his hath decréed, who I pray yo (if he be in his right minde) can suffe them? Wherfore sith the foundations of Papistrie be such, it is not to be looked for that from them we should receiue the pe¦fet quieting of controuersies of Religion, yea, & what wee may look for from them they haue sufficiently in these few yéeres declared, whilest Osius (who otherwise wanteth no woords) hath not set foorth (I wil not say) an Epistle, but not so muche as one line in defence of the doctrine of God against the hereticks whiche deny the Trinitie, and suche as affirme there are thrée Gods, or against the Samosate¦nists. Wherfore bidding them adue, let vs constantly embrace the simplicitie of the holy Scriptures, let vs set the same before vs as a moste plain rule of all con∣trouersies,
 for if (setting affections aside and such other lets as are resited in this booke and ioyning earnest praier héervn∣to) we so doo, it is to be hoped we shall ob∣taine some tollerable quiet peace and concord of the Church, whiche hope: the lawdable example of your Churches hath confirmed in vs.
But for asmuch as we are yet very far wide from the mark, we thought good to dedicate this book vnto your worthynesse, as well to confirme that concorde so well and so godlily begun amongst you, as also to stir you to finish and make perfet that which wanteth, that by your singuler di∣ligence and labour: those also which bée∣ing sedused by the woulues and wander from the true church, may be ioyned and knit vnto the same.
Moreouer I suppose that if togither with this book of exhortation I should set foorth an euident example of the reconciliating of Churches deuided, it would haue the more authoritie and waight, not onely a∣mongst forrain nations, but also cheefely amongst the Germains of whōe if I might obtain this thing, that by your example
 setting now at last all affections aparte, they would conclude a godly concord and peace in that gréeuous controuersie of the Sacrament, I dout not but many other controuersies would be buryed togither with it. And because we knowe (moste ex¦cellent and honourable Lord) that it is a thing which your honor greatly desireth, I thought good to dedicate this little book (bothe in mine owne and the Authors name) vnto you, to the end bothe you and all your Churches, by example, coun∣cel, and all industrie, yea (and that chée∣fest is) with earnest prayers, might pro∣cure and preserue the peace of the church, not onely amongst your selues, but also a∣mongst others.
I beséech God to increase in your honor the gifts of his holy spirit, and graunt you a most long life and health, to the glory of his name which thing also togither with me, euen with all the hart the Au∣thor of this Book wisheth vnto you.
