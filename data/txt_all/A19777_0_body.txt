RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
IF that ground bee truly iudged barren, which, receiuing seede, and partaking of the hea∣uens dew and the Suns reflexion, affords no fruit: then much more that man into the surrowes of whose distressed estate a reli∣gious hand casts the seede of compassion, and vpon whose disconsolate heart a cha∣ritable minde sparkleth the rayes of conso∣lation may iustly be deemed ingratefull, if he bury in obliuion such (especially if vnde∣serned) fauors. Euer since one beame of your Honors bounty ministred cōfort to my lan∣guishing spirits, I haue desired, & desiring
endeuoured, and endeuouring attempted to expresse my duty by presuming to present vnto your Honour this little Plant, and to transplant it into your Honours Vineyard: little it is, yet beares it fruit already, and such fruit, as (I hope) will yeeld conten∣ting comfort and comfortable Content to each spiritual taste for the present, & leaue the rellish of assured expectation for the time to come. It striues to ouer-top the weeds of wants, wrongs, and woes which would weaken a Christians patience, to pre∣uent the blasts of discontents and distrusts which would supplant a belieuers hope and confidence, and to frustrate the stormes of doubting, and coniecture which would hin∣der the growth of faith & affurance. Plea∣seth your Honour to vouchsafe one hand, and to water it with a few drops of your fauourable approbation, it will thriue the better; and that, here, you may so flourish in Gods Courts, that branches be neuer wanting to your stocke, nor fruit to your branches, and that hereafter, root, stocke, branches, and fruit may flourish in the Ce∣lestiall and eternal Paradise, he shall pray, who resteth euer,
