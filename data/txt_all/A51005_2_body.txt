Sir,
OUT of that intire Obedience which I shall ever pay to your Commands, I writ the ensuing Paraphrase; and unless the common Fate of all Poets (which is, to be fondest of their last Pro∣ductions) very much blinds my Judg∣ment, I think the honour you have lay'd upon me in this Request, has informed the piece with a greater Genius and Spirit, than usually attends my Writings. I am not insensible that 'tis as natural for a Poet to flatter himself as his Patrons;
but here my wishes conspire with my weakness, to put the best varnish over the humble present, and make it seem in some measure worthy your acceptance. Buchan∣nan, Oldham, and Woodford have been happiest in their versians of this Psalm; till I finish'd my own, I avoided seeing their Composures: choosing rather to correct my thoughts by others Works than design by them. The only one I may have seem'd to follow is Mr. Oldham, the great re∣spect I have for this Anthor cannot biass my judgment so far as to overlook his faults; his Digressions are too long even for Pindarick Poetry; his Verse wants Number and Cadence: but the most un∣pardonable fault, is that the Pathetick Air of this Psalm is not observed with Po∣etical Justice. I would not in this im∣mitate our modern Writers, first to steal immediatly from an Author, then Cen∣sure and Rail at him, that the World may not suspect them. I hope your lei∣sure will permit you to Read him, at once to justifie the Character I have given, and to see how industriously I have avoided even the Resemblance of Thoughts and Expressions, tho' the sub∣ject be the same. But lest I make my
Preface Resemble the head of a Rickety Child, that is vastly disproportioned to the smallness of the body, I shall only beg your favourable Acceptance of this, and to think I always retain a grateful ac∣knowledgment of those many favours you have confer'd on,
Magdalen Colledge in Oxford, June, 1697.
