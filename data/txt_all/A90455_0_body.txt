MADAM,
SInce if the beauty of Mandana, the Charming Modesty of Sta∣tyra, the Ma∣jesty of Mariamne; (and, which is more than all these, since she
hath had the honour to be pre∣sented by a person, as consider∣able in his title, as the exaltedness of his Minde and Spirit, to a Lady of resembling quality) the high attractions of Parthenissa: if all that hath been mention'd Great and Vertuous in all the Stories that have yet been writ∣ten, were contracted into One, to make a resemblance of your divine Perfections, they would yet fall short to express them: I am induc'd to believe, That to present your Honour with this piece of imperfection, can be but the same presumption as to have interrupted your more impor∣tant diversions with any thing
of the most refin'd and accom∣plish'd that ever Courted Fame: it being the Prerogative of Greatness, to confer that value upon meaner things out of Fa∣vour, which even the greatest could not be capable to obtain by desert: Nor could this De∣sign have confess'd its deficiency by a nobler way, than by im∣ploring so bright an influence: and those things which pretend to highest consummation, should they ground their Dignitie upon their own Compleatnesse, they would become as much unworthy your Condescention, as to obtain what they pretend to; they would stand in need of it, and
thereby divest themselves of their most glorious Title, which is to admire, and wait upon ex∣cellencies greater than any themselves could shew: for it were a grosse stupidity, Admi∣ration being the inseparable Concomitant of those infinite Glories and Beauties which shine in your Soul, and throw a Radiant Lustre round about you, if our Resentments should not be as High as the Cause is Noble that produceth them: Had you only deriv'd those vast Applauds which are render'd you by all those with whom Vertue hath any Concern∣ment, from your happie Rela∣tions,
as being Wife to that Noble Lord, whose Gran∣dezza's of Spirit are so many, and whose Learning shines in so immense a degree, that (not only among those of a resem∣bling Extraction, but even a∣mong the Meaner sort of Men, who not being Considerable in themselves, may haply be in∣cited to seek for Eminence by the Studie and Profession of Arts) few have attain'd to that sublime Perfection; and next, as Daughter to that in∣comparable Lady, whose re∣cent Actions (great as the Fame which eternally attends upon her Memorie) not only
transcend whatever hath been done of most Heroick, by the most famous of her Sex in all Ages, but even Romances themselves, whose Custom it is to describe Actions as boundless as Fancy can suggest, have not produc'd Examples more Illustrious a∣mong their most exalted Hero's; this were a Condition glorious enough to Cover you with more Palms than the world affords: And although there is no Con∣sideration equally powerful with the heighth of those Actions, to transmit the Glory of them to Posterity; yet to decline the payment of the highest Attri∣butes I could be capable of
rendring unto the Monument of so much Worth and Glory, would be a Neglect as Crimi∣nal, as the Celebration of them a Duty. I shall not at present longer insist upon the Elogium's of those Illustrious Personages, although they are so just, that all tongues might ambition to dwell upon them; lest I might seem to make you redevable for those Honors, which are the rightful Effects of your own inherent Worth, unto those Excellencies which are own'd by others. But Ma∣dam, There are in your self advantages of so high a Na∣ture, Vertues so bright and
unaccessional, which make you owe your Concernment in those glorious Relations, more to Me∣rit than to Fortune; that the Passion I have to Adore them, is yet more powerful than what might render the confidence of this Address pardonable: Yet since I represented to my self how much your Actions are a∣bove Vulgar Applauds, the Apprehension of how unwor∣thy a Title I had to the Ho∣nour of Rendring them, had almost subdued my Inclination to an absolute Declining of so great an Ʋndertaking, had not a firme resolve rather to hazzard the Committing of so
considerable a Crime, than not to express the Adoration I have for Vertue, especially shining in so Illustrious a Man∣sion, made me reassume my first Intention: And I confess, the Authors Fame had not a small Ascendent upon me in this Election; Who, I believe, out of a fatal instinct that his Design would come to ap∣pear before a Judgement so Comprehensive, and so Pene∣trating a Wit, hath made his Hero to perform somwhat of so gallant, that in the nar∣row Limits to which he is con∣fin'd, and his due regard to Likelihood and Possibility, a
particular, of which there are few Romances which make any great Conscience; I see not how he could have per∣form'd more. And whether we look on Silvia, dress'd in the innocencies and uncon∣strained handsomness of a Pastoral Conversation, or con∣sidered in the more resplendent gentillesses of her true Conditi∣on; I am confident she will think her self more Fortunate in be∣ing held worthy of your Ac∣ceptance, than in the bare Sa∣tisfaction she could derive from either of these Condi∣tions: Since in the former, there are no becomingnesses
which are not in you so con∣spicuous, as if those happy a∣ges were return'd, wherein, to be a Princess and to be a Shep∣herdess, were the self-same thing: and in the later, she is so darkned and exceeded by a more surpassing splendor, that the greatest Priviledge she can aspire to, is to court the protection of a Greatness that so much out-shines her. Nor can I think my self indiffe∣rently concern'd in Silvia's Contentment, seeing the glo∣ry of presenting her is not to be equall'd by any thing, but by the Humility and De∣votion wherewith she is pre∣sented
to so unspeakable a Felicity, By
MADAM,
