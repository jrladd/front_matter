MADAME,
THough the conscience of my owne vn∣worthinesse might haue sufficiently deterred me from this boldnesse, of offering these first & friuolous fruits of my muses labours at the shrine of your Ladiships diuine perfections, yet the hope of your gracious ac∣ceptance banishing my feares, did incourage me with this assurāce, that as no darknes can remaine at the approch of the Sunne, so no erronious faults can be found or seene in those lines your Ladiships honourable eyes haue once ouershined: whereby I shall sleight the censures of carping Critickes, and laugh at the malice of malignant Momus, shadow∣ed vnder the wings of your fauourable protection. In which securitie, my greatest happinesse I shall hold to be in your Ladiships honourable employ∣ment, which I shall study to deserue by some greater worke, till when I remaine,
