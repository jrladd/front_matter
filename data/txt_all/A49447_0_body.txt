THE nearer you are to Crown and Scepter, the more regard you ought to have to Him, whose Vicegerents, Kings and Princes are. By your indifferency about Worldly Affairs, Providence hath disposed you, to despise the World, and to give your Heart to God, who hath unimaginable hap∣piness and contentment ready for those, that with an intire Resignation comply with his Will. If the following Medi∣tations have such an effect upon your Mind, as to strengthen your Love to the Ruler of all Hearts, He will never let you want those Affections of the People, which mark and support a Princes greatness, and I shall certainly see my Wishes and Hopes of the growth and continuance of your Prosperity fulfilled. When you see these present Broils of Europe make way for great changes in Church and State, remember this De∣dication, and believe that God will rescue those that fear, love and trust him, and that you are One of the few great Ones, not to be touched by the general Calamity, which the unusual Earth-Quakes and other Signs of Gods Anger do forebode. Then I shall not scruple to make my self known to you.
