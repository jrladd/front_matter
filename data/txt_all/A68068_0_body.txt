NOtwithstādyng (right honorable) my pre∣sent insufficiencie to write things woorthy any gene∣rall view, and much lesse to stand afore your peculiar & graue iudge∣ment, yet, in respect of your naturall affa∣bilitie inclinable to honest indeuours, I am bolde (vnder this argument) to exhibite a simple effect of my seruiceable mynde so long tyme vowed to you & yours, as part∣ly encouraged by the honourable regard of your vertuous Lady and wyfe to my first dedication, and partly induced by your name of singuler merite to all sortes, but most of all by an auncient & setled desire

leading me (as it were) in an aspiring ima∣ginacion, to bring forth somewhat worthy your honorable view & protectiō: wherin hauing as yet nothing of mine own to pre∣sent your honor withal, it may like you (in the meane while) to receiue this short re∣port of the third and late French troubles, the same as they were lately writtē by a di∣ligent eye witnes, assisting all their actuall procedings vntill Ianuary last: so, not vn∣meet to be reuealed to our countrey, no lesse for the qualitie or freshenesse of the matter, which is very graue in it selfe, than for the truth and indifferencie of the au∣thor, who certeinly in either part, procedes with great modesty, obseruing with al such singuler integritie as both the good sorte may settle and confirme, & the rest suffice & satisfie without cause of offence, vnlesse temperance and truth be offences to such whose tastes can abide no better dispositi∣ons thā their own: And this as it is a most commendable order in writing, so hath it no smal grace in an history, and as careful∣ly to be imitated of all sortes, as the contra∣ry is contemnable in any: besides, if there be any dignitie (next after the sacred word

of God) to wise writings on earth, a true history may iustly chalenge a first place, being (in dede) no small parcel of the same sacred word it selfe. If we also discend in∣to Philosophy, History is her chiefest part in what degree so euer wise men wil place her, which Plato forgets not to affirme in reckening such cities and people very hap∣py, whose princes and soueraigne gouer∣nours be Philosophers, as though no parte of Philosophy did more liuely and gene∣rally instruct a vertuous lyfe, thā histories, who as with a certaine harmonie & swete∣nesse to draw men to good by aliing ex∣amples of good mē, so, of the contrary ex∣pressing terrible successes of the wycked with their tragicall endes, do euen hale vs from the cuill to the better: the same hap∣pening most whē writers be vpright spea∣kers of the truth, & sincere hable iudges of the same, likewise moderate praisers, but free reprehenders, without affectation ac∣cordyng to the indifferent desertes of the parties: which so much the more becomes the histories of our tyme to be thus seaso∣ned, when we our selues be professours of that heauenly and deuine Philosophye,

which, in teaching vs the chiefe and hygh truthe, willes vs also to bee lesse negligent of our own estimation, than (in swaruing from that which is honest and true) eyther to bleamish the one or slaunder the other in our christian pietie, and that with such a notable blot for euer, as liuing men, obiec∣ting our faultes, as witnesses eyther of ma∣lice or falshode, may also cōmende them to a perpetuall posteritie. Such therefore is the excellent Maiestie of a true historie, as nothing in humayne things is to bee pre∣ferred before it, and such the necessitie of it both in priuate and publicke, as well in all states and pollicies, as also conducible to Religion, directing withall euerie degree in his duetie and true vse of the same. And lastly, it is the liuely Image of time and sea∣sons, whiche vnder God, most absolutely, doth gouerne and: esolue oure transitorie endeuours and actions: A most true loo∣king glasse for the soueraigne to beholde continually, and a sound studie for the sub∣iect to bee had still in vse. Wherein (right honorable) if I haue indutifully abused your wisdom and graue experiēce, and by

to much speach and circūstance slipt into Phormyos faulte, when he red to Hannibal, de re militari, It may like you to measure with my vehemencie to the cause, my re∣spectiue desire to your honour, who albeit is not (I know) without your deepe sight and excellent iudgement in the tunges, yet it may please you to suffer this small trea∣tise (by your mediation) to becommunica∣ted to others, to a publik benefit of many, and speciall deface of slaunderers, who in this cōspiring tyme do labour to confound both deuine and humayne things, leauing nothing vnstayned which they may bring within the compasse of their carping na∣tures.
And lykewyse for my parte, albeit I am bolde to vse this breefe discourse, to sollicite rather in my vnfayned faith and disposition to your honour, than in any worthynesse in the trauayle, yet if youre honoure vouchsafe too receyue me and my meaning vvith that vertue vvhiche surely is peculiar in you: I shall not one∣ly bee encouraged too greater things hereafter, but also others of woorthie

skill in dede, wil labour to honour you for this example, wherin I most humbly and faithfully commend vnto you my hart & deuotion, as also if I had any other thyng more deare or precious, I present it with an vnfained will to be commaunded as it best pleaseth your honour, whom God long preserue to your prince, country, and frendes. At London the xxiiij. of May. 1570.
