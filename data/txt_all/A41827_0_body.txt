My Lord,
AS the favours I have received from your Lordship oblige me to present you with some token of my gratitude: so the especial Honour I have for your Lordship hath made me sollicitous in the choice of the Present. For, if I could have given your Lordship any choice Excerptions out of the Greek, or Latine Learning, I should (according to our English Proverb) thereby but carry Coals to Newcastle, and but give your Lorship Puddle-water, who, by your own eminent Knowledge in those learned Languages, can drink out of the very Fountains your self.
Moreover, to present your Lordship with tedious Narrations, were but to speak my own Ignorance of the Value, which his Majesty, and the Publick have of your Lordship's Time. And in brief, to offer any thing like what is already in other Books, were but to derogate from your Lordship's learning, which the World knows to be universal, and unacquainted with few usefull things contained in any of them.
Now having (I know not by what accident) engaged my thoughts upon the Bills of Mortality, and so far suc∣ceeded therein, as to have reduced several great confu∣sed Volumes into a few perspicuous Tables, and abridged

such Observations as naturally flowed from them, into a few succinct Paragraphs, without any long Series of mul∣tiloquious Deductions, I have presumed to sacrifice these my small, but first publish'd, Labours unto your Lordship, as unto whose benigne acceptance of some other of my Papers, even the Birth of these is due; hoping (if I may without vanity say it) they may be of as much use to Persons in your Lordship's place, as they are of little or none to me, which is no more then the fairest Dia∣monds are to the Journey-man Jeweller that works them, or the poor Labourer that first dig'd them from the Earth. For with all humble submission to your Lordship, I conceive, That it doth not ill-become a Peer of the Par∣liament, or Member of his Majestie's Council, to consider how few starve of the many that beg: That the irreligi∣ous Proposals of some, to multiply People by Polygamy, is withall irrational, and fruitless: That the troublesome seclusions in the Plague-time is not a remedy to be pur∣chased at vast inconveniencies: That the greatest Plagues of the City are equally, and quickly repaired from the Country: That the wasting of Males by Wars, and Colonies do not prejudice the due proportion be∣tween them and Females: That the Opinions of Plagues accompanying the Entrance of Kings is false, and se∣ditious: That London, the Metropolis of England, is per∣haps a Head too big for the Body, and possibly too strong: That this Head grows three times as fast as the Body unto which it belongs, that is, It doubles its People in a third part of the time: That our Parishes are now grown madly disproportionable: That our Temples are not sutable to our Religion: That the Trade, and very City of London removes Westward: That the walled City is but a one fifth of the whole Pyle:

That the old Streets are unfit for the present fre∣quencie of Coaches: That the passage of Ludgate is a throat too straight for the Body: That the fighting men about London, are able to make three as great Armies as can be of use in this Island: That the num∣ber of Heads is such, as hath certainly much deceived some of our Senatours in their appointments of Pole∣money, &c. Now, although your Lordship's most ex∣cellent Discourses have well informed me, That your Lordship is no stranger to all these Positions; yet be∣cause I knew not that your Lordship had ever dedu∣ced them from the Bills of Mortality; I hoped it might not be ungratefull to your Lordship, to see unto how much profit that one Talent might be im∣proved, besides the many curiosities concerning the waxing, and waning of Diseases, the relation between Healthfull, and fruitfull Seasons, the diffe∣rence between the City and Country Air, &c. All which, being new, to the best of my knowledge, and the whole Pamphlet, not two hours reading, I did make bold to trouble your Lordship with a perusal of it, and by this humble Dedication of it, let your Lordship and the world see the Wisdom of our City, in appointing, and keeping these Accompts, and with how much affection and success I am
My Lord,

Birchen-Lane, 25 January 1661/2.
