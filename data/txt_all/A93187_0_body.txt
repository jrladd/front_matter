Reverend and worthy Sir,
WEE have received much content and satisfaction in our spirits from your late seasonable Ser∣mon Preach'd to us upon occasion of our Solemnity in Proclaiming His most Excellent Majesty, our dread Sovereign CHARLES the second; wherein you did so
clearly represent him unto our apprehensions to be in all respects a very hopefull Prince, and his accession to the Government of these Kingdoms to be every way so advantagious, as did exceed∣ingly increase our joyes, for His Majesty's wonderfull Preserva∣tion and Restitution, and adde very much to the Solemnities of the day: And therefore we can∣not but return you our hearty thanks for the same. And ha∣ving good grounds to hope, that it may have the same effect upon the hearts of others, into whose hands it may come, who had not the opportunity to hear it; we do hereby make it our joynt request unto you to publish your Sermon
to the View of the World, that those clouds of fears and doubt∣ings, which perhaps do sadden the spirits of many good people, may thereby be dispersed, and all may be induced as cheerfully to embrace, and affectionately to close with this hopefull way of Settlement on the good old foun∣dation (and as thankefully to ac∣knowledge the great goodness of our God in bringing us thereun∣to after all our sad Combustions and Confusions) as we our selves upon these grounds un∣feignedly do. Sir, we have had such large experience of your good affection to His Ma∣jesty's Person, and just Autho∣rity, and your desires for the
healing of all our sad Breaches, that we cannot doubt of your ready complyance with us in this thing.

Dated May 21. 1660.
