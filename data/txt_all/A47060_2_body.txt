SIR,
HAving dedicated my former Trea∣tise, intituled, Judges Judged out of their own mouthes, to all the people of England universally; now in respect of the integritie I have foundin your self, in behalf of them all, to cause that to pass the
Press, for the view and good of all; I thought my self bound in dutie to devote this Tractate of Peace to your self that are one of the Ju∣stices of Peace, named in the
Commission which I have here chosen to English, and to Comment upon, to my best abilitie, in so short a time as I had since it came to my hands, to dispatch it before your departure to your Ren∣dezvouse.
Sir, I beseech you be plea∣sed to give me leave to pass it under your name, & vouch∣safe to accept so simple a gift, of an heartie giver: Thesubject concerneth both Peace and
War, and cannot be safely protected from the Enemies of either, (whereof Peace hath too many) but by a man eminent for his power, and interest in both, with this difference observed by Craesus king of Lidea, That in times of Peace, Sons bu∣ried their Fathers, but in times of War, Fathers buri∣ed their Sons. And so much precedence to be given to Peace before War, as to
Mercie before Justice, nei∣ther of which can subsist, one without the other, but well consist both together, as the God of
Peace, and Lord of Hosts, are but the self same
Deitie, united in the Spirit of God, which wheresoever it is, there is Libertie, 2. Cor. 3.17. Which Libertie God grant
England.
