My very good Lord,
I Doe understand and perceive that there is a Pamphlet ex∣hibited unto your Lordship, intituled, An Indictment against paying of Tithes unto the Mi∣nisters of the Gospell: and therein are alledged Reasons, seeming by their Alle∣gations to prove them unlawfull by the
Word of God; and therein it doth ap∣peare unto me, they speak they cannot tell what, or els they care not what. J doe therefore humbly beseech your Honour to accept my poore endeavours, in this ensu∣ing Treatise, which doth concerne the lawfulnesse of paying Tithes to the Mi∣nisters of the Gospell, and to give it your honourable favour, so farre as the truth of the Word of God doth approve of it, and no further.
