HAVING of late perused, examined, & answered certain Sermons preached in Edinburgh by one who entitleth him self Minister of Christs Euangel there: for sundry causes (most excellent and gratious Prince) I haue ben induced, of that my smale labour, to make a present vnto your royal Ma∣iestie. First, for that the Author of those Sermons published them vnder the name of your Highnes; it seemed to me conueniēt, that the Answere also should be offered vnto the same personage: by conference whereof he might be able, better & with indifferēcy to iudge of both. Next, whereas those Sermons con∣teyne false doctrine against the sacraments, against the eternal Testament of Christ ordeyned in his last Supper, against the peculiar sacrifice and worship of God evermore and vniuersally practised in the Gos∣pel and new law since the first preaching thereof by Christ and his Apostles: and not only this, but also they manifestly imply the foundation and ground of plain infidelitie, of discrediting al the old & new Test∣ment; of denying the chief and souerain articles of

Christian faith: who can blame me, if where I per∣ceiue so great daunger intended, there I study to repel the same: if where poison is addressed to infect the very hart of religion, and head of the common welth, there I oppose a counterpoison against that infection: if I couet to preserue sound that which others endeuour to corrupt, and desire by right ar∣gument of true Theologie to conrme and establish that, which the aduersarie by sleight Sophistrie and heretical cauils laboureth to ruinate & ouerthrw. And thus to do, as Christian dutie requireth, for any article of our Christian beleef for the benefite of any Christian sowle like otherwise to perish: so much greater is the obligation, wherewith my self and al other English Catholikes acknowlege our selus boūd to our Countrymen the inhabitants of England and Scotland: but especially & in a singular degree vnto your royal person. Vnto whom as the lawes of both elmes, descent of blud, custom & inheritance drawen from the auncient kings of the one and other nation, in ciuil respect geueth right to succede in gouernment of both crownes with al their dependences: so is it the continual prayer of Christian Catholikes not only in both those nations, but also in al prouinces of Europe, that it wil please God so to inspire and direct your Ma. tus hart, that yew may gouerne them in such Christian sort touching faith & matter of eternal sal∣uation, as your most noble progenitors haue done frō the first Christened Prince to the last; from Donaldus vnto Quene Marie your Graces most honorable, most renoumed, most constant & religious mother: who

hauing so many yeres susteyned hard impri sonment and finally cruel death and martyrdom for profession of that first, auncient & Apostolike faith, hath there∣by left a glorious and immortal president to al her aftercōmers, who clayme tēporal right from succession of her blud, to make the like or greater accompt of that right which cometh by succession to her in faith; for which, she with Heroical fortitude, neglected her blud, her libertie, her crownes, and what so euer is most deere to Princes in this world: and for which neglect her name is more honorable before God & his Angels, her memorie more famous among Christians of this age, and so wil be to al posteritie, then if with refusal of that faith, that is, with refusal of Christ & eter∣nal blisse, she had gayned as many tēporal crownes & realmes, as they haue liued dayes & howres, who were occasioners of that so straunge & wōderful execution.
Now if it shal please your Grace to bestow some voyd tyme in overrunning this smale booke: I no∣thing doubt, but touching the argumēt here intreated that is touching the external seruice & honour done to God by sacrifice and sacrament in his church, your Grace shal easely see the manifest & cleere euidece of our Catholike cause: the truth thereof set downe in the most plain scriptures of God: the cōtinuāce there∣of testified by vniforme consent of al Antiquitie: the first original & roote of the cōtrarie heresie which now beareth greatest sway in your realme of Scotlād as also in England; from what fountaine it sprang, by what Apostles it was spread; by what Sophistrie, malice & dissimulatiō it hath encreased, by what wic∣kednes,

ignorāce, & impietie, it is maynteyned: finally, to what plain Atheisme or Paganisme it tēdeth. For which cause, many potent kings & princes, although otherwise circumuented by false ministers, or seduced by evil counsailers, vpon some humane reasons & co∣lourable cōmodities craftely obiected, they departed from the vnitie of Christs church, & intangled them selues with other heresies of this tyme: yet could they never be induced to approue, or so much as to permit within their realmes this Zuingliā or Calviniā here∣sie, because they were thoroughly resolved, that it was the very bane & pest of wel ordered cōmon welthes; for that it breadeth in her Sectaries a licentious liber∣tie to beleeve what they fist against God & his church and to live how they please against the magistrate & his civil lawes, to which it preacheth that no obedi∣ence is due for conscience sake. Among which Princes, for exāples sake to name one (lest I seeme to charge thē vniustly) Christianus 3. king of Denmarke, a Prince of great wisdom and experience, grand-father to that vertuous Princesse whom your Highnes hath chosen for your spouse and Queene, when as the congrègatiō of such kind of Protestants expelled from England byANNO 1553. Queene Mary, sought & laboured by al meanes pos∣sible to obteyne harbour in his realme, only for a few dayes (vntil the extremitie of winter were somwhat passed over) if not in regard of their religion, which they said was purely Euangelical, yet in consideratiō of many feble old men and wemen, many infants & yong children which were in the company, & vnable without certain hazard of their liues to abide any

more trauail on the seas in that extreme season: this notwithstanding, that king otherwise of nature clemēt and mercyful, and professing the Gospel (as they calNarrati de dissipa ta Belgan ecclesia. & caet. Acta apu regē Da∣niae. a pa. 24. vsque ad 110. it) would by no meanes condescend that they should remayne any time within his dominions, except they forthwith without farther disputes, abandoned and condemned their Sacramentarie heresie; which he iudged to be directly against the Gospel of Christ, against the Articles of the Christian beleef, & against the publike quietnes & tranquillitie of his realme: as in the storie hereof set forth by them selues, at large ap¦peareth. Which iudgemēt of that king, their notorious sauage, and barbarous behauiour in many countries of Europe, hath since that time continually more and more verified, and the writings of the ministers for defense of their opinions, which daily they invent, hath much more abundantly iustified: whereof this smale booke geveth also some proofe & demōstration.
In publishing whereof vnder your Maiesties name, if any man shal reproove me as bold & presumptuous, for my excuse, laying aside the examples of most aun∣cient fathers, whose footesteps herein I haue folowed; if former reasons satisfie not, I appeale to your cle∣mencie for pardon: protesting before God, that the cause which hath moued me hereunto, next vnto his honour, & defence of the truth; is my faithful, dutyful and seruiceable hart to your Maiestie, to whom I wish as large dominion and ample monarchie, as ever had any king of that Iland: for whom I pray, that with them and aboue them, yow may be victorious in warre, fortunate in peace, amiable to your subiects

& dreadful to your enemies: that it may please our Lord to heape vpon yow & your posteritie al blessings spiritual and temporal: that finally, hauing gouerned your subiects in such quietnes, pretie, godlines, and rule of faith, in which your worthy predecessors haue lead yow the way, yow may at length with them to your eternal ioy & felicitie, render vnto God a com∣fortable accompt for the great charge which he hath committed to your hands. Which, that your Maiestie may happily persourme with al honour & prosperous successe, according to my bounden dutie I shal not cease continually to pray.
