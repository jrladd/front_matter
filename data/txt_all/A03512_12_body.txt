TO you, faire Patronesse, and Muse to Learning;
The Fount of learning and the Muses sends
This Cordiall for your vertues; and forewarning
To leaue no good, for th'ill the world commends.
Custome seduceth but the vulgar sort:
VVith whom, when Noblesse mixeth, she is vulgare;
The truly-Noble, still repaire their Fort,
VVith gracing good excitements, and gifts rare;
In which the narrow path, to Happinesse,
Is onely beaten. Vulgar pleasure sets
Nets for her selfe, in swinge of her excesse;
And beates her selfe there dead, ere free she gets.
Since pleasure then with pleasure still doth waste;
Still please with vertue Madame: That will last.
