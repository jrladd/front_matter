SIR,
I Send you heere an
Assize Booke, or
rather a Treatise
of Poysons; to per∣use
which, I had
not given you the
trouble, had not your own commands
obliged mee to it: for what my me∣mory
faild me of in our last discourse
upon this subject of Heretikes, I
have, to comply with your desires,
turn'd over those few Treasuries

of Common places wherewith my
reading hath furnished mee. And
now you may behold  cree∣ping
out of the  pit in
their oders, and heare all their se∣verall
tones; for I have according
to the oder of time 
the names of all the chiefe 
with their positions thoughout all
the Centuries. Here are none but
uch as were condemned  Gene∣all
or Oeonomicall Coucels:
No is there any Auhor quoted
 is not of a venerable name.
I might have inserted more of
, but when one  another allready condem∣ned,
and lick't but up his vomit, I
have mittd him, for thee is a
 of tragration of Hersie,
whch needs no proofe to such as live

in this Age, wherein her womb is
more fruitfull of monsters then Af∣frick.
This Bedroll I submit to your
judgement, which is abundantly a∣ble
to supply any defect you may finde
therin.
