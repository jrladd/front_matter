VVORTHY SIRS,
IT was by both your Worships that I was placed in the Pulpit where these two Sermons were preached. By the one of you it was that I was perswaded, and by the other it was that I was presented to it; and therefore by both your Worships may both these Sermons be joyntly and justly claimed. I shall not disclaime the right of either to them. They were both my Service in that pulpit long agoe upon one of your Sabbaths, one of my Working dayes; But neither of your Worships (ni memini male) were that day neere to hear them as they were presented to the care, be
 pleased to let them come so neere unto your Worships now, that you may reade them as they are represented to the eye. Mine Office doth bind me to live, not to my selfe, but oâˆ£thers. It makes me a Servant to all by Common Duty: But my place to officiate doth make me by Speciall tyes, and Service,
Sirs,
