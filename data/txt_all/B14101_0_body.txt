SIr; as I with great desire apprehended the least opportunity of manifesting towards your worthy selfe my sincere affection, so should I be very sory to pre∣sent any thing vnto you, wherein I should growe offensiue, or willingly breed your least molestation: but these meditations, being Diuine and Religious (& vpon mine owne knowledge, cor∣respondent to your zealous inclination) emboldened me to recommend them to your view and censure, and therein to make knowne mine owne entire affection, and seruice∣able loue towards you. Long haue they lien hidden in ob∣scuritie, and happily had neuer seene the light, had not a meere accident conuayed them to my hands. But, hauing seriously perused them, loath I was that any who are reli∣giousy affected, should be depriued of so great a comfort, as the due consideration thereof may bring vnto them. As for my selfe, Sir, the knowledge you haue of me, I hope will ex∣cuse the coldnesse and sterilitie of my conceipts, who couet to illustrate my intire affectiō vnto your worship, by reall and approued actions, referring my selfe wholly in this, & all other my indeuours, to your fauourable construction, who shall euer be of power, in the humblest seruices to command me.
