THE design of this
Treatise is, not to
stroak and tickle the
Fancy, but to ele∣vate
the Soul, and refine its
Apprehensions, to inform the
Judgment, and polish it for
Conversation, to purifie and
enflame the Heart, to enrich
the Mind, and guide Men

(that stand in need of help)
in the way of Vertue; to ex∣cite
their Desire, to encourage
them to Travel, to comfort
them in the Journey, and so at
last to lead them to true Felici∣ty,
both here and hereafter.
I need not treat of Vertues
in the ordinary way, as they
are Duties enjoyned by the
Law of GOD; that the Au∣thor
of The whole Duty of
Man hath excellently done:
nor as they are Prudential
Expedients and Means for a
mans Peace and Honour on
Earth; that is in some mea∣sure
done by the French Char∣ron

of Wisdom. My purpose is
to satisfie the Curious and Un∣believing
Soul, concerning the
reality, force, and efficacy of
Vertue; and having some ad∣vantages
from the knowledge
I gained in the nature of Fe∣licity
(by many years earnest
and diligent study) my business
is to make as visible, as it is
possible for me, the lustre of its
Beauty, Dignity, and Glory:
By shewing what a necessary
Means Vertue is, how sweet,
how full of Reason, how de∣sirable
in it self, how just and
amiable, how delightful, and
how powerfully conducive also

to Glory: how naturally Ver∣tue
carries us to the Temple
of Bliss, and how immeasura∣bly
transcendent it is in all
kinds of Excellency.
And (if I may speak free∣ly)
my Office is, to carry and
enhance Vertue to its utmost
height, to open the Beauty of
all the Prospect, and to make
the Glory of GOD appear, in
the Blessedness of Man, by
setting forth its infinite Excel∣lency:
Taking out of the Trea∣suries
of Humanity those Ar∣guments
that will discover the
great perfection of the End of
Man, which he may atchieve

by the capacity of his Nature:
As also by opening the Nature
of Vertue it self, thereby to
display the marvellous Beauty
of Religion, and light the Soul
to the sight of its Perfection.
I do not speak much of
Vice, which is far the more
easie Theme, because I am in∣tirely
taken up with the abun∣dance
of Worth and Beauty in
Vertue, and have so much to
say of the positive and intrin∣sick
Goodness of its Nature.
But besides, since a strait Line
is the measure both of it self,
and of a crooked one, I con∣clude,
That the very Glory of

Vertue well understood, will
make all Vice appear like dirt
before Jewel, when they are
compared together. Nay, Vice
as soon as it is named in the
presence of these Vertues, will
look like Poyson and a Contagi∣on,
or if you will, as black as
Malice and Ingratitude: so
that there will need no other
Exposition of its Nature, to
dehort Men from the love of
it, than the Illustration of its
Contrary.
Vertues are listed in the
rank of Invisible things; of
which kind, some are so blind
as to deny there are any existent

in Nature: But yet it may,
and will be made easily appa∣rent,
that all the Peace and
Beauty in the World proceed∣eth
from them, all Honour
and Security is founded in
them, all Glory and Esteem is
acquired by them. For the
Prosperity of all Kingdoms is
laid in the Goodness of GOD
and of Men. Were there no∣thing
in the World but the
Works of Amity, which pro∣ceed
from the highest Vertue,
they alone would testifie of its
Excellency. For there can be
no Safety where there is any
Treachery: But were all

Truth and Courtesie exercis'd
with Fidelity and Love, there
could be no Injustice or Com∣plaint
in the World; no Strife,
nor Violence: but all Bounty,
Joy and Complacency. Were
there no Blindness, every Soul
would be full of Light, and the
face of Felicity be seen, and the
Earth be turned into Heaven.
The things we treat of are
great and mighty; they touch the
Essence of every Soul, and are
of infinite Concernment, be∣cause
the Felicity is eternal that
is acquired by them: I do not
mean Immortal only but wor∣thy
to be Eternal: and it is

impossible to be happy without
them. We treat of Mans great
and soveraign End, of the
Nature of Blessedness, of the
Means to attain it: Of Know∣ledge
and Love, of Wisdom
and Goodness, of Righteous∣ness
and Holiness, of Justice
and Mercy, of Prudence and
Courage, of Temperance and
Patience, of Meekness and
Humility, of Contentment, of
Magnanimity and Modesty, of
Liberality and Magnificence,
of the waies by which Love is
begotten in the Soul, of Gra∣titude,
of Faith, Hope, and
Charity, of Repentance, De∣votion,

Fidelity, and Godli∣ness.
In all which we shew
what sublime and mysterious
Creatures they are, which de∣pend
upon the Operations of
Mans Soul; their great ex∣tent,
their use and value, their
Original and their End, their
Objects and their Times:
What Vertues belong to the E∣state
of Innocency, what to the
Estate of Misery and Grace,
and what to the Estate of
Glory. Which are the food of
the Soul, and the works of
Nature; which were occasio∣ned
by Sin, as Medicines and
Expedients only: which are

Essential to Felicity, and
which Accidental; which
Temporal, and which Eter∣nal:
with the true Reason of
their Imposition; why they all
are commanded, and how wise
and gracious GOD is in en∣joyning
them. By which means
all Atheism is put to flight,
and all Infidelity: The Soul
is reconciled to the Lawgiver
of the World, and taught to
delight in his Commande∣ments:
All Enmity and Dis∣contentment
must vanish as
Clouds and Darkness before
the Sun, when the Beauty of
Vertue appeareth in its

brightness and glory. It is
impossible that the splendour
of its Nature should be seen,
but all Religion and Felicity
will be manifest.
Perhaps you will meet some
New Notions: but yet when
they are examined, he hopes
it will appear to the Reader,
that it was the actual know∣ledge
of true Felicity that
taught him to speak of Ver∣tue;
and moreover, that there is
not the least tittle pertaining
to the Catholick Faith con∣tradicted
or altered in his Pa∣pers.
For he firmly retains all
that was established in the

Ancient Councels, nay and sees
Cause to do so, even in the
highest and most transcendent
Mysteries: only he enriches
all, by farther opening the
grandeur and glory of Reli∣gion,
with the interiour depths
and Beauties of Faith. Yet
indeed it is not he, but GOD
that hath enriched the Nature
of it: he only brings the Wealth
of Vertue to light, which the
infinite Wisdom, and Good∣ness,
and Power of GOD have
seated there. Which though
Learned Men know perhaps
far better than he, yet he
humbly craves pardon for cast∣ing

in his Mite to the vulgar
Exchequer. He hath nothing
more to say, but that the Glory
of GOD, and the sublime
Perfection of Humane Na∣ture
are united in Vertue. By
Vertue the Creation is made
useful, and the Universe de∣lightful.
All the Works of
GOD are crowned with their
End, by the Glory of Vertue.
For whatsoever is good and
profitable for Men is made Sa∣cred;
because it is delightful
and well-pleasing to GOD:
Who being LOVE by Na∣ture,
delighteth in his Crea∣tures
welfare.
There are two sorts of con∣current
Actions necessary to
Bliss. Actions in GOD, and
Actions in Men; nay and Acti∣ons
too in all the Creatures.
The Sun must warm, but it
must not burn; the Earth
must bring forth, but not swal∣low
up; the Air must cool
without starving, and the Sea
moisten without drowning:
Meats must feed but not poy∣son:
Rain must fall, but not
oppress: Thus in the inferiour
Creatures you see Actions are
of several kinds. But these may
be reduced to the Actions of
GOD, from whom they

spring; for he prepares all
these Creatures for us. And it
is necessary to the felicity of
his Sons, that he should make
all things healing and amiable,
not odious and destructive: that
he should Love, and not Hate:
And the Actions of Men must
concur aright with these of
GOD, and his Creatures.
They must not despise Blessings
because they are given, but
esteem them; not trample
them under feet, because they
have the benefit of them, but
magnifie and extol them: They
too must Love, and not Hate:
They must not kill and mur∣ther,

but serve and pleasure
one another: they must not
scorn great and inestimable
Gifts, because they are com∣mon,
for so the Angels would
lose all the happiness of Hea∣ven.
If GOD should do the
most great and glorious things
that infinite Wisdom could
devise; if Men will resolve
to be blind, and perverse, and
sensless, all will be in vain:
the most High and Sacred
things will increase their Mi∣sery.
This may give you some
little glimpse of the excellency
of Vertue.
You may easily discern that
my Design is to reconcile Men
to GOD, and make them fit to
delight in him: and that my
last End is to celebrate his
Praises, in communion with
the Angels. Wherein I beg
the Concurrence of the Rea∣der,
for we can never praise
him enough; nor be fit enough
to praise him: No other man
(at least) can make us so,
without our own willingness,
and endeavour to do it.
Above all, pray to be sensi∣ble
of the Excellency of the
Creation for upon the due sense
of its Excellency the life of

Felicity wholly dependeth.
Pray to be sensible of the Ex∣cellency
of Divine Laws, and
of all the Goodness which your
Soul comprehendeth. Covet a
lively sense of all you know, of
the Excellency of GOD, and
of Eternal Love; of your own
Excellency, and of the worth
and value of all Objects what∣soever.
For to feel is as ne∣cessary,
as to see their Glory.
