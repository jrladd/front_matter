SIR,
I Here send you two Letters, (the first writ in the year 1667.) both writ by a prudent and Conforma∣ble quiet Citizen of London, to two Bro∣thers, that now are, or were zealous, and busie Shop-keepers in Conventry; to which place I came lately; and by accident met with a grave Divine, who commended them to my reading: And having done what he desired; I thought them to speak so much real truth, and clear reason, and both so lovingly and so plainly, that I thought them worth my transcribing; and now, upon second thoughts, think them worth Printing, in order to the unbeguiling many

men that mean well, and yet have been too busie in medling, and decrying things they un∣derstand not. Pray, get them to be read by some person of honesty and judgment: And if he shall think as I do, then let them be Printed; for I hope they may turn some∣what to your own profit, but mnch more to the benefit of any Reader that has been mi∣staken, and is willing to be unbeguiled.
May 29. 1680.
God keep you Sir, Your Friend.
