Honoured Sir,
HIS Majesty having (for your unblemisht and unshaken Loyalty to himself, and your constant Zeal for the Succession in the right Line) intrusted you with the Posse Comi∣tatus of this County, and accumulated other Honours and Titles upon you; give me leave as well to Congra∣tulate
those Honours which (if ever any did) you have Merited from your Royal Master, as to present you with this Discourse, which will discover to you the vanity of all Sublunary Glories, and acquaint you that there is no Honour woven in the finest Tapestry of this World, but will lose Colour, Decay, and Perish; and that the Greatest Titles are written in Dust, and that the very Monuments of great Men are Mortal, and will in time be found (like Archimedes his Tomb in Tully) overgrown with Thorns and Briers: But you (Sir) have taken a Course to perpetuate your Memory, and build your Fame upon these lasting Pillars; Remark∣able Loyalty to your Soveraign, Exemplary Conformity to the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of Eng∣land, and Faithfulness to your Friend; these Ex∣cellencies your Friends cannot but respect and admire, and your Enemies dare not but acknowledge in you; And that you may participate as well of the glories of the other World, as you have done of the Honours of this, (whereof I wish you still an Addition) let me request you to make the things above the chief Objects of your Affections, which was the Principal design of this Discourse now Dedicated to you by
Ansty. Novemb. 22. 1682.
