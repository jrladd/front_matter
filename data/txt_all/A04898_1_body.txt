Gentlemen,
ALthough I haue little, or nothing at all beene beholding to Fortune, or to the times, or to the great men of these times, (whose promises though seeming very fresh and forward, require more then one yeare to bring forth any fruites of performance) yet I would not haue you thinke, that any necessitous regard, hath made my Muse so superstitious, to adore so many rising Suns. No, be yee assured, that it was a zealous consideration of these perillous times, quick∣ned by some other more particular & slight respects that moued me to this taske; which I deeme no lesse warrantable by example then reason: for if you please to cast a long looke backe to the Troiane warre, you shall find Calchas exciting the disheart∣ned Greekes to prosecute the warre. Looke

an age more backward, and there you may see Orpheus encouraging the Agonautes to the Colchian expedition. As for those detracting Dogs, such as (I am sure) this poore pamphlet shall meete with all, I would aduise them to stand off, and not to bee too hastie to awake a sleeping Lyon, least their eares or their tailes pay for their vnconside∣rate rashnesse.
But to you (kind Gentlemen) quorum ex meliore luto finxit precordia Titan) to whom, I hope this simple present shall not be vnwelcome, I shall thinke my selfe euer bound in all honest loue and seruice. But if there be any that to please their fancies, wil misconstrue my good meaning, vilysy my la∣bours, and reiect my obsequiousnesse, it skils not much; for I can as well beare the losse of a Booke as they the want of an vnderstan∣ding.
