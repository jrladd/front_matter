My Lord,
I Know not any thing could move you to re∣quire the Printing this plain Sermon, but a great affection to the design of it: Which I pray God increase in you all, and make you signally instrumental in promoting that Refor∣mation, wherein the safety and happiness of our Country is so highly concerned. And if the publishing of this discourse may confer but any
 little matter towards it, whatever other de∣fects may be found in it (especially after so kind and favourable an acceptance from you) will not much concern
My Lord,
