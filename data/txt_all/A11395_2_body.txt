MOst humbly
Shewes to thy Great Worthiness,
Graue MODERATOR of our Britain LAWES)
The Muses Abiect (subiect of Distress)
How, long Wrong-vext, in a not - Need - less Cause,
Not at the Kings-Bench, but the Pennie-less)
By one, I Want (the son of Simpleness);
Vnable, more to greaze the scraping paws
Of his Attorney Shift, or oyl the iaw
Of his (dear) Counsell, Serieant Pensiueness;
He is compell'd, in forma pauperis,
To Plead, himself (and shew his (little) LAW)
In the free Court of thy milde Courtesies.
Please it thee therefore an Iniunction grant,
To stay the Suit between himself and Want.


For Thee and Thine, for ay,
So He and His shall pray.
