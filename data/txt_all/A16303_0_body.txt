Sr. If I should send you ouer the Relations both in Latin, Dutch, and French, which come to this Towne concerning the variety of Newes about the troubles of Europe, I should weary you with the multiplicity of Bookes, and my selfe with the cunning of transportation: Besides, I am sure to bee preuented in sending you Newes, because it will bee stale ere it come to your handes by my meanes: Therefore I desist from either troubling you or my selfe in that kinde, and yet haue I chanced on something, which I am sure none can helpe you to, but by my meanes: So it is then, that there, came to my hands two seuerall Coppies of seuerall Letters, one from Wittenberg, as the summe of an Embacy from the States of Bohemia to the Duke of Saxony, concer∣ning his Desertion of the King in these tumultuous times: another from Mr. Fodringham in Vienna, written by the Pope to the Emperour, concerning the pacifica∣tion of the Troubles, and admission of a Peace (if the motiue might bee correspondent to his Honour) rather then aduenture to bee terrified with so much effusion of Blood, or hazard the Dignity of the Empire, by let∣ting the Warres goe forward. And these as you see I haue Printed heere in Amsterdam, and they are so pleasing to the Inhabitants heere, that I presume, they will bee as

acceptable there to all the welwillers of the Bohemian Affaires: and so wishing your Contentment in the ouer∣reading, bee bolde that whensoeuer any thing comes wor∣thy of you, you shall not fayle of it. For I am still your Friend:
