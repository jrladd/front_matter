Right Reverend Father,
I Cannot but be sensible how unfit a Person I am now, after Thirteen years blindness, to offer any thing unto Publick View, especi∣ally in such an Age as this; But seeing that it is your Lordship's desire, that these weak Me∣ditations of mine should be made publick, I am willing to obey; and the rather, that the world may know, That whatever Faction and Division there is, or hath been amongst us here in this City, it hath not passed without publick discovery and reproof. I will give your Lordship, at the present, no further trou∣ble, than humbly to crave, that, as these Me∣ditations, such as they are, had your Lordship's Approbation when you heard them from the
Pulpit, so you would be pleased to let them pass under your Patronage from the Press: And hereby I shall be the more obliged to be, as I am,
