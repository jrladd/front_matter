WHen that bright Sunne
(of glorious memo∣ry)
having been for ma∣ny
years clouded by
an unnaturall Warre, did at last
through an unparalleld Treason set
in our Horizon, it was a red and
bloudy Evening.
After that Evening, followed a

black and dismall night, where in
the ravening Wolves and beasts of
prey domineered, worrying the
estates and lives of those who were loyal
and Orthodox.
That night hath by Gods just in∣dignation
against us, been measured to
us, not by hours but years, and
stretched out to a long continuance.
About the Beginning of the
Twelfth year of that Night, a
morning Star appeared, and that
not from the East, but North, To
whom it was the unanimous cry of all
Countries,
Phosphore redde diem.
that he would be an happy instrument

(under God) to turn our night into
day.
Through the tender mercy of our
God, and his prudent conduct, our
desire was fulfilled. Not the same
Sun indeed (he shineth in the Hea∣ven
of the blessed) but another
(He who of right ought to succeed
him) arose as it were from the Sea,
gilding our desolate Land, with his
radiant Beams. His amiable light
hath ever since increased, and He is
now near the Meridian of his Coro∣nation;
Where being in the Zenith,
may he (like Joshuahs Sun,) stand
still, and that not for a few hours,
but many, many years, to the a∣mazement
of the eyes of Rebells,

and refreshment of the hearts of all
Loyal Subjects.
By the benigne aspect and influ∣ence
of this Sun, it is, that the fir∣mament
of our Church is now a∣gain
bespangled with Stars, and
those fixed in their various Orbes.
After the joyfull appearing of those
Two Stars of the first and second
magnitude, We have beheld three
severall Constellations, of six, and
seaven, and four Stars; of whom I
may justly say in these words of our Sa∣viour,
concerning John Baptist.
They are burning and shining
Lights, and I pray God, both we and
our posterity may have continuall
cause of rejoycing in the splendor
of such Eminent Lights.

As for this ensuing Discourse, it
was only a broken Eccho to that
voice whith distinctly and learnedly as∣serted
Episcopal Authority, from
that Power Saint Paul gave to Ti∣tus,Titus 1. 5.
when he left him in Crete. It
was designed for no other end, but to
be a Congratulatory Appendix
to the Solemne Consecration of those
seaven Bishops: and as it was
Preached upon short warning, so it
had never been exposed to publick
view; but that it was required by
them, and particularly by my Lord
Bishop of Durham, whose Judg∣ment
I had great reason to prefer be∣fore
my own; Nor can I but ac∣count
it an high honour to be in any

kind owned by him, who hath so re∣solutely
owned this Church of
England, both at home and a∣broad,
asserting her Doctrine a∣gainst
the Papists, and discipline a∣gainst
the Schismaticks.
The multiplicity of other urgent
affairs, hath for a time retarded my
performance of the command I
received from, and promise I made to
that Reverend Prelate, for which
I humbly beg his Lordships par∣don:
and now having made these weak
labours publick, I intreat thy candid
censure of them, together with thy
earnest Prayer for me, who am
