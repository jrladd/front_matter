Gentlemen,
I Design Liberty; not the name, but the thing; I assert not that which some Divines call Monarchy, but Kingship, as it relates to the Law of England, not that of the Jews; not in order to the Greatnesse of a single per∣son, but to the happinesse of the whole peo∣ple; That Regal Politick Government, to whose protection I am entitled by my birth, for the preservation of my freedome in per∣son and estate, and that, with more assurance than possibly can be secur'd under the go∣vernment of the many who often call that justice, and without remedy, which in truth is Faction.
Next, I abhorre bloodshed, and deeme one party in all warres guilty of murder; a crime
which as it cries high for vengeance, so it cries loud for peaee, which he only endeavours that that acts no injury; I recommend this to bal∣lance you in the way to Peace, lest you bal∣lot us into the field of blood; perhaps your own as well as ours; for though you Vote at ease upon the hazard of our bodies, yet pos∣sibly in time, the evil may happen upon the Artist. If but one of you I convert, I have a full reward; for perhaps I may save a soule; however as the text speaks, I shall hide a mul∣titude of sins.
