SIR,
HAVING made many Considerable Im∣provements and Additions to my Geo∣graphy in this Second Edition, I have all the reason in the world to shelter it once more under the Patronage of your Name, whose Affairs abroad have not only given You a bet∣ter Knowledg and Experience of Foreign Parts; but whose Encouragement and Bounty, next to Divine Goodness, have only contributed to its Production, which otherwise with its poor Au∣thor, must have for ever lain latent under the Horizon of unknown Obscurity, and irresistible Poverty. The declining therefore the Imputati∣on of Ingratitude, is my only Plea; and though

it may not be pleasing to You, yet not to have done it in my Circumstances, would have been my just Crime. I humbly therefore beg your Goodness will be pleased to add to your former Kindnesses that of passing by the Imperfections of what is offered. In excuse of which I can on∣ly say, That as 'tis not the Industry of one Age that can rectifie and compleat the Ataxie of Geo∣graphy; Nor the work of any one man that of Coins, Weights and Measures; so a well meaning Essay towards both, I hope will find a Courteous Entertainment from the more judicious and un∣prejudiced Reader: For I have this, I will not say to justifie, but to excuse at least my boldness and forwardness, that if I had known these things to have been but tolerably performed by others, I had neither troubled my Reader, nor mis-spent my own time about the Rectification of them; wherein although I have again made many Cor∣rections and Amendments, yet that I have made good some mens Expectations, and freed them from all defects and oversights, neither my fears nor my modesty will permit me to be confident of; so that knowing this work which I have undertaken, is liable to common Censure, I am bold to shrowd it under your Protection, hum∣bly imploring your kind Reception and Pardon

for this my presumption; for which, and for the excess of many Favours, I shall ever pray for the prosperity of You and yours; And for ever ac∣knowledg my self,
