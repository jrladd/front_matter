And now vnder your wor∣ships fauourable protection, J offer to my Countrimens freendly acceptance the Spagericall practises of Iose∣phus Quercetanus, augmented with diuers rare se∣crets not commonly knowne, all which J doubt not, will with more fauour be receiued in generall, if they may be graciously shadowed and defended vnder your wor∣shipfull name, whose prosperous successe in all your ho∣norable and vertuous attempts & actions, with a most deuote affection, J doe most earnestly wish.
