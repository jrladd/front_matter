SIR,
BEing very unwil∣ling to be singu∣lar, as to send this Book into the World without either Epi∣stle or Preface, would certainly be, I resol∣ved from the time of my setting it to Press,
to send it out with both; and had no sooner made that Re∣solution, but present∣ly pitcht on a Patron under whom to shelter it. I now humbly de∣dicate it to your self; and beg of you to be∣live that I am in all sincerity,
Sir,
