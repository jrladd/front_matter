THrice did we read what passion wrought at once,
It pleas'd, displeas'd vs, and it pleas'd againe.
Front-fallowed Athens ministred in frownes,
Which Ismarus to Comick aid reclaime.
May she propugne those wronges, and onely those,
But Thracian refuge do not we propose.
They weare not Athens furrowes that offended,
And be she powerfull in her reprehension,
But want of worthines to thee ntended,
To thee (great Ladie) life of mine inuention.
Tis from thy fauour, or seuerer sence,
We syle or take acquaintance with offence.
Vouchsafe (thou fairest of Elisaes trayne)
From bewties ement one gratious dymple,
Th'immensiuenes whereof shall entertayne
And countenance the errour of the symple.
If thou be pleas'd, then all are satisfide,
Or be thou pleas'd, so frowne the world beside.
