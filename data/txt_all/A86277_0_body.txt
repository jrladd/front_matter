Much Honoured, &c.
MY blushing disabilities have presumed to salute you, unprovided of any other Ornament then sincere Loyalty devoted to you: in this condition, I can say nothing of you, but what all men know, such is the great∣ness of year Renowned Fame; such is the greatness of your vertues and splendor of Learning, and frequent making of Acts, and giving of Laws with solid Prudence, and Elegant readiness of Speaking and Writing; Knowledg of many things, Constant in Re∣ligion; Assisting the Poor in their Just Cau∣ses; and delivering the Imprisoned out of the hands of blood-thirsty Creditours: And these are the Commendable conditions with which you are endowed beyond the common custom of others: I say nothing of those Ancient Mo∣numents of your eminent Nobility, the Treasure of your Riches both old and new, the Large∣ness of your Spirit in Armes, with the Excel∣lency

whereof you excel, together with the comely form and strength of the body: Though all these be very great, yet I esteem you farr greater then all these, for those your Heroick and superillustrious vertues, by which you truly have caused, that by how much the more any one is Learned and loves vertue, so much the more he may desire to insinuate himself into your favour; whence I also am resolv'd that your favour shall be obtained by me; but after the manner of the People of Italy (i. e.) not without a Present: which custom of salu∣ting Princes, and men of honour is indeed de∣rived from Plato, Aristotle, and the An∣cient Greecists unto these very times, and still we see it observed. And when I hear of certain Learned men to furnish you with fair and great presents of their Learning, least I only should be a Neglector of your Worship, I durst not apply my self with empty hands to your greatness. Now being thought full, amongst the secrets of Nature, which I have laid up choice∣ly and closely in my study with my other Cu∣riosities, Behold, The Idea of the Law pre∣sently offered it self, as I attempted to Cha∣racter it when I followed the Practise of an Atturney in the Upper-Bench at Westmin∣ster, &c. And now the Revolutions of Trou∣blesome Tyrants, and my own Misfortunes

being almost past, I presently made hast, as it were to pay my vows, to present it to your Wor∣ship to compleat; Truly I was perswaded that I could give nothing more acceptable to you, then a Method of this Nature, which none have, I dare say, hitherto attempted to re∣store: Yet it is not writ to you, because it is worthy of you; but that it might make a way open for me to gain your favour. I beseech you if it may be, let it be excused by you: I shall be devoutly yours, If this part of Law shall by the Authority of your greatness come into Knowledg, envy being chased away, by the power of your Worthiness; there remain the memory of it to me, as the Fruit of a good Conscience; And so you shall know, that I shall all my Life be,
