Right Honorable:
THis aduantage a scholler hath a∣boue others, that hee cannot be idle, and that hee can worke with∣out instruments▪ For, the mind inured to contem∣plation

will set it selfe on work, when other occasi∣ons faile: and hath no more power not to study then the eye which is open hath, not to see somthing; in which businesse it car∣ries about his owne Li∣brary, neither can com∣plain to want books while it enioyeth it selfe.
I coulde not then neg∣lect the cōmodity of this plentifull leasure in my so easie attendance heere; but (though besides my course, and without the help of others writinges) must needs busie my selfe

in such thoughts as I haue heere giuen account of, to your Lordship: such, as I hope will not bee vnprofi∣table nor vnwelcome to their Patron, to their Readers. I sende them forth from hence, vnder your honorable name; to shewe you that no ab∣sence, no imployment can make mee forget my due respect to your Lord∣ship: to whom (next vnder my gracious Maister) I haue deseruedly bequea∣thed my selfe and my in∣deuours. Your goodnesse hath not wont to magni∣fie

it selfe more in giuing thē in receiuing such like holy presents: the know∣ledge whereof hath inti∣tled you to more labours of this nature (if I haue numbred aright) then a∣ny of your Peeres. I mis∣doubt not either your ac∣ceptation, or their vse. That GOD, who hath a∣boue all his other fauours giuen your Lordship euen in these careless times, an heart truly religious, giue you an happy increase of all his heauenly graces by my vnworthie seruice. To his gracious care I dai∣ly

commende your Lord∣ship with my Honorable Lady; wishing you both, all that litle ioy earth can afford you, and fulnesse of glory aboue.
Non-such.
Iuly 3.
