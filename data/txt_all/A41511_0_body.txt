Madam,
CƲstom hath set up a kinde of law, that when a Book is published, some Patron must be sought. I ha∣ving lived to doe that, which I never thought to doe while I li∣ved, I resolved not to be irregular, ha∣ving such copious Copies, in this case, not only among Authours in all ages, but even in Sacred Writ it self.
And though for this I have not sought a Noble Theophilus, yet I have found an Elect Lady, on whom I have pre∣sumed,
 and to whom I Dedicate this en∣suing Treatise. In which choice, if ei∣ther personall worth, or particular fa∣vours, both to me and mine, may be judged encouraged engagements, and engaged encouragements, I shall nei∣ther suspect any open check, nor deserve any secret censure: Those that know You, can testifie the one, and I my self could amplifie the other: But I know it would not plase Your Ladiship, should I fall upon the unfolding of either; though I wish the world did more fully understand Your pious devotion, and charitable disposition, that many more might be provoked by Your precious and praise worthy Example. And to that end I cannot but bear witnesse, as to Your pious devotion, appearing, not only by Your Ladships care in a private per∣formance of Religious duties; but by Your spirituall hunger after the publike means of grace, in the Ministry of the Gospel, esteeming the faithfull Ministers thereof very highly in love, I dare say,
 for their work sake; in so much that when through bodily weaknesses, there hath been a forced absence from publike Ordinances, how sadly hath Your Ladi∣ship complained for the losse of such pre∣cious liberties, a thing rare in this Gospel-glutted age. So to Your charita∣ble disposition, whereof plenty of evi∣dencing instances might easily be given, for though the common calamity (Di∣vine providence so dispensing and dispo∣sing) hath no doubt dis-inabled Your Ladiship from doing that in some way which would have been aforded for the refreshment of others, yet God hath made you both able and willing to give out Your charity other waies: Where∣by many even of the poorer sort have been helped and healed, restored and preserved to praise God for You. And this I take to be none of the least of Your Ladiships praises, that being even come to the eventide of Your daies, and near the haven of Your rest, Your faith and love in the fresh-fruits thereof, be yet
 very vigorous. Madam, Go on with the good assistance of God to doe the best good You may, and the good Lord keep his best wine for You in this later end of Your age, that when God Your Father sends, You may depart in peace, feeling much of the power and love of God in Christ warming Your heart while You live, and much more when You die: Which is and shallbe the prai∣er of him, who is and shallbe, Di∣vine Grace assisting, at the Throne of Grace,
