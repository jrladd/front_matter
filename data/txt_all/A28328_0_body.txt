May it please your GRACE,
I Can not so overlove and overvalue this ensuing Discourse, as to hold it worthy of Your GRACES judicious eyes, much less of Your HIGHNESSE Patronage, yet now my verie dutie hath commanded me to look thus high, and tells it would be no lesse then injurious, if I should not lay down my work where I discharged my service, and that I should offend, if I presumed not tus: Whether should the Rivers run, but into the Sea whence they came. This being first Preached upon a call from Your GRACE, and the Honourable Court of PARLIAMENT, and being a little Mite from one who desires to carrie in his bosome a Religious and Loyal heart to GOD the Supreme Law-giver, and o our Sacred SOVERAIGN.
May it please Your GRACE therefore, with an favourable aspect to look upon this as a present for CAESAR, though a verie mean one, yet the little All I have, and as a testimonie of that Religiou Reverend, and due respect I owe to Your GRACE, for the undeserved favour soown to Your GRACES humble, and unworthie Servant, knowing also that such Pieces are oboxicus to the

obloquies, malice, & envy of some, whether could I flee more rationally for shelter then o Your GRACES Parociny and Protection, whose high understanding in all knowledge Divine and Humane, and espe∣cially in these Primitive Truths here asserted, is no mean accession to all Your oter Noble and Heroicall indowments.
Much is now expected rom Your GRACE, both by the Almightie GOD, raising and reviv∣ing Your GRACE as another Joseph out of the Dungeon, and another Jonah out of the blly of the Whale, the depths of the earth; And from Your Sacred SOVERAIGN, thus exalting You to this highest Pinacle of Honour, and for reviving the languishing Laws of this withering Nation. Unto all which that Your GRACE may be sutablie answerable, and that the LORD may make You eminentlie instrumentall as a skilfull Pilot, to bring this tossed and only not sinking Vessell of this poor distracted Church and State to the desired Harbrie of truth and peace, and for restoring His MA∣JESTIES just Piviledges, and Royal Prerogatives: And that the Grace of GOD may be assistant to Your GRACE to go on in the Work of GOD, and Your GRACES Master, THE LORDS ANOINTED, the breath of our nostrils: Shall be the humble desire and heartie prayer of him who is lesse then the least of Your GRACES Servants. So intreating this may passe under Your GRACES favourable Patrocinie: And commending Your GRACE to the Protection of the ALMIGHTY GOD. I am, and remain still,
Your GRACES in all humble observance and duty,
