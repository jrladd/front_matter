My Lord,
THat I have not paid a more speedy obedi∣ence to your Lodships Commands, and the
admonitions of some of my worthiest friends, in making publick these following conceptions,
proceeded from no other rea∣son than that, in my more deliberate review, I thought it some
injury to her high deserts to have expressed so little, where with truth and evidence so
much might have been asserted. It had been a taske not lesse pleasing to my self, and
more satisfactory to all that knew her, to have pend an History rather than a Sermon: and if a
happier pen had undertaken this subject, the story of her life might prove a most
perswasive Orator for goodnesse and piety, the highest effects of Sermons. But
considering the place where I was
 no make this discourse, I could not otherwise contrive, but that what could be
spoken in the praise of so incomperable a Lady, must hold small proportion with what
must be sup∣prest in silence, and because I would be true to the Title, I have made no
addition, nor considerable alteration.
That the Image of her Virtues may finde a place in your Lordships memory, and may live in your
daily imitation, and of all who shall see some glimpses of it in this unartifi∣ciall but
faithfull representation, to the glory of him whose Image she bore, is the fervent prayer
of

Audley-End. Sept. 11. 1649.
