Dear Friends,
ACcording to the several Rela∣tions
(nearer or more re∣mote)
wherein ye stood to
Mr. Benjamin Lindsey, when he was li∣ving
with you, Nature and Reason di∣ctates
that ye must be differently af∣fected,

as to Degrees, by his being by
Death removed from you, yet being so
much beloved and respected by you all,
it is easy to determine that his Death
was Matter of Sorrow to you all; but
the Religion ye all profess, and the
Christian Doctrine ye all do own,
must be instructive to you, that ye
sorrow, not as those that have no Hope,
either that his Soul, being so Pious,
was not carried by Angels into Abra∣ham's
Bosom, or that his Body, that
ye carried and lodged in the Bosom
of the Earth, should not be raised
again to a joyful Resurrection, and be
hereafter, where the Soul at present
is, in Happiness and Glory: Of which
Two Things, the believing Considera∣tion
should drie your weeping Eyes,
relieve your mourning Spirits, and
comfort your Sorrowful Hearts.
To the Mother I send this short
following Advice:
1. That you would not so much sor∣row
that your Son's Body is gone down

to the Grave, as rejoice that his Soul
is gone up to Heaven: Not so much
mourn, that he whom you did bear,
bring forth, and bring up, is taken
from you, as be comforted that God
hath taken him to himself: As know∣ing
he is better pleased to be where
he is, and more Happy, than if he had
continued to be on Earth, with you,
and that he would not be from thence,
to come again to you: And let this
make you the less Sorrowful in this
World, because his Soul is now trium∣phant
in the other, which is a better
World: for I suppose you loved your
Son better than to grieve at his Pre∣ferment.
2. That considering the Greatness
of your Age you would clear your E∣vidences
for Heaven, and not have
them to seek, when you should have
them to shew, nor to get▪ when you
should have them to use for your more
comfortable Departure; that as you
are sure your Body must go down to
your Son's Body, so you might be as

sure that your Soul shall go up to his
Soul, that as he was where you are,
so you might be with God, where he
is.
3. That you daily remember, you
are almost at your Journey's End; in
a Course of Nature so near the Door of
Eternity, that you cannot be much
longer in Time; therefore when you
cannot move so speedily in Natural
Motion, run more swiftly in your Spi∣ritual
Race, that you might not fall
short of the Joy and Crown that is set
before you.
4. That since your Son (now gone
from you) hath made such competent
Provision for you, that you need not
spend your Breath in asking, What
shall I eat, or what shall I drink, or
wherewithal shall I be clothed? Your
Enquiries might be, How shall I love
God more, please him better, and be
more prepared for my Eternal State?
Since now you need not cark for
Earth, take more Care for Heaven.

5. That since you have more Benefit
of your Sense of Seeing, than of Hear∣ing,
supply the Defect of Hearing, by
your diligent Reading; and the less
you can hear Men speak to you in Dis∣coursing,
the more do you speak to God
in Praying; and the less Converse you
can have with the Creature, the more
Communion do you desire, get, and
maintain with God.
To the Rest of you, let me be your
Remembrancer, that ye get a sanctified
Improvement of this Breach by Death,
that God hath made amongst you,
that ye so mind Temporal, as not to
forget your Eternal Concerns, to
watch and be always ready, because
the Son of Man might come, in an
Hour that ye think not of; to pre∣pare
to follow him and others that are
gone before: to keep up the Power of
Godliness in your Hearts, and to de∣monstrate
it in your Lives: Seriously
and believingly to think of another
world, and every Day you live in this,

to stand in Time, and look into Eter∣nity:
To be Good, and to do Good,
as he was, and did, that is taken from
you, whereof (in Part) ye have been
Eye-witnesses: To live Holily, that
ye might die not only Peacably, but
also Triumphantly; as is his Prayer
for you, who desires it might be yours
for him, who is,

Mugwel-Street,
April 8. 1698.
