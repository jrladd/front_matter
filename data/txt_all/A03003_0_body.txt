THe viewe of Scipio his valiant exploites (right Honourable) was no lesse admired amongst the hardie Carthageni∣ans, then the report of his conquestes were ioyfull among the Senators and Citizens of flourishing Rome. But if they in regarde of Heathen honour, and onely forworldly causes conceaued such felicity in their victories, yeelding their graue ears to the discourse therof, then need I not feare to present to your honors hands, the vndoubted truth of these happy victories obtained by the most noble and Christian French King, who for the recouery of his right & ad∣uancement of Gods glory, is inforced to maintaine wars against them. Wherfore
 in respect of your honourable and mag∣nanimious minde, your wisedom and vertuous inclination, your hardinesse in warres, and hatred to rebellion sondrie times manifested to your eternall and well deserued praise, as also to declare my well affected hart to your honour, I haue chosen you the Patrone of this warlike discourse, that the noble ex∣ploits herein mentioned may be the bet∣ter regarded, and the more esteemed by the name of so honourable a personage, whose loue as it is generally planted in the harts of all the Cōmons of this land, so it is euery day augmented through hope of your neuer dying fame. Thus shielding my selfe vnder your honours protection, with hope of your honou∣rable fauour and pardon for my bolde attempt, in most humble manner I take my leaue.
