PEACE, take it
with all faults,
is better then
Warre: and
the ende of a iust warre,
is but Studium Pacis, the
intention of a right peace.
The Subiect then is be∣yond
exception, to all that
loue Peace. But commonly
they, with whom it med∣dles,

refuse to meddle with
it. Let such take the course
of their vnhappy precipice
into euerlasting vnquiet∣nesse,
who wilfully reiect
the cure of their affected
maladie: denying their
consciences a trouble that
may saue them, for feare
of loosing a trouble that
oh please them. As if a
man were lesse then mad,
that will leap into the fire,
o auoid the smoke. There
is Pax fundamenti, the
peace of Doctrine: and
Pax Ordinis, the peace of
Discipline. The Heretike
would pull downe the first
Pillar, the Schismaticke

the other: The former
would break our peace with
Christ; the latter with our
selues & the Church: both
these are almost desperate.
But there is a third, Pax
Politica, a ciuill Peace:
and the common distur∣bers
of this are such con∣tentious
spirits; that either
vnprouoked, out of mis∣chieuous
intention: or be∣ing
prouoked, out of mali∣cious
reuenge; set all in
vprore, make a mutiny
in manners, an ataxie in
the course of life. To cure
this Babel, if at least shee
will bee cured, is the scope
of this Tractate. Peace

was Christs blessed Lega∣cie
to his Church; and we
are the Ministers whom
he hath chosen to see it pay∣ed.
Executours are often
sued for the bequests giuen
by dead Testators: Loe
here a Legacie without su∣ing
from a liuing Father.
Embrace it, and bee regu∣lated
by it: so shall your
hearts finde present com∣fort,
and your soules eter∣nall
life in it.
The heartie desirer
of your Peace.
