Christian Friends,
AS you have received the Lord Jesus Christ, so walk in him, and let the love of God be an Ingagement upon your spirits to love the Lord Jesus with all your hearts, and walk as chil∣dren of the light, and of the day, not in darkness, but in light, and let the pure light of God in you, which is the free gift of God that shew∣eth darkness, and Infidelity, lead you and guide you, which the Priests about your Beverley faith it doth not, shewing that they are ignorant of Christ, and doth mightily dishonor the Lord Jesus, that say they witness that he or the Light of God which sheweth sin, and darkness, sheweth not unbelief: But all you that know the Lord Jesus made manifest unto your souls, and in the Divine discovery of his love, by the Divine unfoldings of the Divine light, of his holy and blessed spirit, which is as the key of David, and doth unlock or unsold the Divine misteries of the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus in the souls of his Saints, which these dry Vines are ignorant of, you may witness against them; therefore my beloved in the Lord Ie∣sus Christ, who are my Epistles, written in my heart, not with paper and inck, which is but carnal and mor∣tal, and perishing, which wears and fades away, but
you are written, not with pen and ink, but by the Spirit of the living God, in the fleshly tables of the heart, so that you may manifestly declare your selves to be the Epistles of Christ, to be seen and read of all men, you that are in union and fellowship with him, who are dispersed and scattered abroad, from the ru∣diments of the world; but in the Vine of the Lords free love, therefore live in love one with another, edi∣fying one another in love, that so you may build up one another in the most holy Faith, laboring in the Power and Strength of the Lord, and by the spirit of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, that you, my hearts, that are as Cedars of Lebanon, may la∣bor by the Power of God in you, to lead up others as you have been led by the Light of God in you, which leadeth into Christ, the perfection and beauty of ho∣liness, that you may be to the praise of the glory of his Grace, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, to testifie against the dark Ministry of the world, as well any where else, where it shall be made manifest unto you, as it is now in and about Beverley, and let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Fa∣ther which is in Heaven, even the Father of lights, and the Father of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, that whereas these your enemies that speak evil of you, and say, a little time will bring it forth; that so by your Godly conversations, and upright walk∣ings you may glorifie the Lord, and put to silence the foolishness of ignorant men, and testifie against blind guides, false Prophets, Seducers, and Antichrists, and that you may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the height, depth, and length of the
Love of God, and to be comprehended into that which is Incomprehensible, dwelling in the light where there is Immortality, that so you may be able to give a reason of the hope that is in you, which is Christ the hope of glory, Col. 1.27. and he that hath this hope in him, purifyeth himself even as he is pure, 1 Iohn 3.1.2. It is in the behalf of all the Godly dispersed ones, that suffer under the name of Quak∣ers, that I have written this, as well as my self; So commending you to the Lord God of power, even the Father of lights, I remain a friend and lover of all that love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth.

Iuly. 1653.
