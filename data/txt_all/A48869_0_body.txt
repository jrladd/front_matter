My Lord,
THE thoughtfull provision for my Journey, into Russia (whither his Ma∣jesty hath been pleased to
send me) hindered me from a more solemne Dedication of these Discourses to Your Lordship: They were by Curious Sir Robert South∣well procured from an in∣quisitive and observing Je∣suite at Lisbon, who had lived many years in Aethi∣opia and the Indies; so writ as to seem a candid Relation of matter of Fact, contai a more precize and minut account of some Historica and Naturall Curiosities then is in any one Tract ex∣tant,
and give the Portu∣guese their just and undoubt∣ed Title of Discovering dai∣ly to the West, the Won∣ders and Mysteries of the East. The Royal Society commanded me to Translate them, and ordered the Im∣pression. My Lord, Your benigne and encouraging Pa∣tronage, for all subtile and nice Enquiries; Your pecu∣liar province to get intelli∣gence from the South, and my particular obligations, countenance this Dedication,
which (were I not in pro∣cinctu) the copious argu∣ment of Your Lordships vir∣tues and perfections, would justly make much larger; now it must only excuse the faults of the Translation, and pub∣lish my zeal of being esteem∣ed,
My Lord,
