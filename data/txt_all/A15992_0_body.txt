IT pleased you long since at my request, to pre∣sent
this holy Song to my honourable good
Lord, and your most deare and louing Fa∣ther.
Whose worthy approbation hath encou∣raged
me to publish it, intending the Dedi∣cation
to his euer-honoured memorie. But God hauing now
taken him to himselfe, and left vs to bewaile our inestimable
losse (it being printed before his Death) I resolue not to al∣ter
the Dedication, but desire you his liuing Heire to accept
it in his Name: praying the Lord of all Grace (who hath
made you Heire of his Graces and Vertues) to make you Co∣heire
with him of eternall Happinesse, resting alwayes
