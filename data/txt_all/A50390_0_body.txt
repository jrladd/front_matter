SHOULD I not make Honourable men∣tion of Your Names, for Your conti∣nual Care of, and Inspection into, the Great Work of Civilizing the Indians, and Promoting the Work for their Conversion: and the hope of future incouraging the Preach∣ing of the Gospel, to such who as yet are
 Strangers to the God of Israel; I should be justly condemnable. I have in the insuing Scrole, presented to the World a True Narra∣tive, though
Short, of the Beginning, Progress and Present State of the Indians on
Martha's Vineyard and Islands Adjacent, and Places on the Mainland to them relating, respecting their Conversion. That I have not spoken of other parts of New England, may be justly Excused; since I have Written little more than what is of my
own knowledge: of other places I must have presumed from report. Of the
Calumnies cast on the Indian Professors, I have in the discourse presented to Your view, (as in other things) spoken briefly, which I hope will be some Satis∣faction to You. I shall only desire of You, that incouragement might be given to some
English, or Indian, Spirited for such Service (humbly conceiving an
Indian most probably like to effect the same) to visit the Indians, bordering on
New England; who might carry to them the glad Tydings of the Gospel; but since I may not doubt Your Prudence, in this as in other Your weighty Affaires; I shall not add to this, but Subscribe

Martha's Vineyard,
Iune 18. 1694.
