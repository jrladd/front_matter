THis hom-bred strain (great PRINCE) those lowly layes,
Which from affections deepe abysm doth spring,
The aged Grampius to thy Throne would bring:
But conscious of his rash attempt hee stayes.
Hee seekes a shelter for his weake assayes;
And hee, who Monarchs tragick lyves did sing,
Makes this unworthie worthie of a King:
And crownes old Grampius browes with Ochell bayes,
Who shrouds himselfe 'neth Alexanders shield,
Knowing this mite may wrong thy praises shrine,
This smoake thy vertues golden altar staine:
Yet thus to climbe Parnassus hee did yeelde,
Since such a rare Moecenas was commander,
Who both an Homer is, and Alexander.
