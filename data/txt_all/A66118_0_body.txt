MY LORD,
HAD Your Lordship commanded to this performance a Person of Sufficiencies, in any tolerable measure, suitable to the occasion of it, You had found your self better served. And more right had been done to the Memory of your Noble Sister, than the follow∣ing poor Accounts of her can amount unto; which have no∣thing to commend them, but that (as far as they reach) they are true. Nor can I suffer imputation from any that knew this Excellent Lady, in any degree of intimacy, but only in having spoken so extreme defectively, and in so mean terms, concerning her. And yet, perhaps, I have said enough to provoke the Envy of some others, who love not to hear of any Commendations but what are ascribed to themselves. To whom I shall only suggest a return of Dr. Donne's upon a not much different occasion, Let any Lady make Donnes E∣pist. p. 253. her self fit for those Praises, and they shall be hers.
 And I heartily wish I had been able so to have represented this Illustrious Example (for it needed no Ornament but bare Narration) as to excite in others a vertuous Emula∣tion. But I am sensible how short I have fallen of the Dignity of my Subject. And had not your Lordship's very great and very just Affection to this Incomparable Lady somewhat imposed upon your Accurate Judgment, your Lord∣ship would never have sent this Sermon to the Press. But though it must abide (as far better things daily do) all license of censure; yet if any thing therein shall in the least assist any good Soul in true Devotion, I shall esteem the Publi∣cation abundantly recompensed to,
My Lord, 
DERBY, Apr 6. 1679.
