Sir,
AMong the many Arts and Sciences whose Reputation is rais'd by your excellent Performances and generous Encouragement, Musick is particularly oblig'd to pay you a thankful Ac∣knowledgement. As such, we humbly beg leave to lay these Musical Composures at your Feet. Were not your condescending goodness as Famous as your other Vertues, we should not dare approach so great a Shrine with so small an Offering. But, like Heaven, you ever lov'd to countenance every good Intent, and suffer the Zeal and Sincerity of your Votaries to attone for their Imperfections. As you fully grasp at once and with ease all the Valuable Qualifications of which others are proud tho' they but singly and superficially possess them, so with a larger Capa∣city of Soul you exert your diffusive Generosity in a more ample manner; and while your whole Time seems engross'd by the most serious and impor∣tant Affairs, to prop the State and Vindicate Reason and Liberty, by your Councels, by your incomparable Pen, and your exemplary Zeal and Reso∣lution, even then you still redeem some Moments to support the Drooping Muses. Your very Recreations are but a Change of Study, and more be∣neficial to your Country than the labour'd Endeavours of others. We see in the Productions of your Mind all the sprightly Vigour of Youth with the profound Judgment of a Riper Age; all the Felicity of Nature with all the Graces and Delicacies of Art. Those three Charming Sisters, Musick, Painting and Poetry have strove to out-rival one another in be∣stowing their utmost Favours on you, but you have so highly oblig'd them, that, tho' they are Goddesses, 'tis not in their Power to oblige you equally. Thus the Greatest, as well as we, must despair of expressing, as they ought, the Respect they have for your inestimable Worth: But, were our Power an∣swerable to our Desires, none wou'd be more ambitious of discharging the mighty Debt due from all Lovers of the Muses to you, than,
Sir,
