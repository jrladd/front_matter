MOst Mighty Monarch of this mourning Land,
Vpon the Knees of my submissiue minde:
I begge Acceptance at your Royall hand,
That my Lamenting Muse may fauour finde.
My Gracious Master was so good, so kinde,
So iust, so much-beloued neare and farre:
Which generally did Loue, and Duty binde
From all, and from me in particular.
But as your Maiesty vndoubted are
The Heyre vnto his Vertues and his Crowne:
I pray, that whether HEAVEN send Peace or War
You likewise may inherit his Renowne.
And as Death strucke his Earthly Glory downe,
Left you in Maiestie, and mourning Chiefe:
Yet through the World apparently 'tis knowne
Your Sorrow is an vniuersall Griefe.
Let this recomfort then your Princely heart,
That in this Duty, all men beares a part.
