My dear LORD,
I Am in Debt so many ways, for Obligations to your Self, and Noble Family, that, with all the Gratitude I have, I am puzzled in finding occasions to express my Thanks; be pleased therefore to receive in a Dedication of this flight Piece, my Hearts true Acknowledgments, and as true an Endea∣vour to dievrt you, by Reading a Comedy, which was only de∣sign'd to please such as look on this sort of Dramatick Poesie, as you do, with Judgment and good Humour. I have studied these things long enough to know the Humor of the Town, and what is proper for Diversion; but I cannot always bring my In∣clinations to flatter the (Would be WITS,) nor spare the expo∣sing a notorious Vice, thô the price of a Third Day were the fatal consequence of such an Indiscretion: It is, and shall be, enough for me at any time, if some few of the many Noble and Worthy Persons, that did me the Honour to appear for me, in spite of the Party that was malitiously made by some eminent Gamesters of both Sexes, who thought themselves touch'd: If such as your Lordship, and those others of my unbyass'd Friends, will please to think it worth their liking, and alluding to a late Honourable, and Renowned Author; I Declare,

If You, and Others, I omit to Name,
Approve my Lines, I count your Censure, Fame.
As to the Play, I will only say this of it, the first hint was ta∣ken from an old Comedy of Fletcher's; and as it was im∣prov'd, and several new Humours added, it was generally lik'd before the Acting. I knew Basset was a Game, only proper for Persons of great Fortunes; and therefore I thought, that a wholsome Satyr of this kind might have oblig'd some Coun∣try-Gentlemen; or Citizens of small Estates, whose Wives ne're heeding the approaching Ruin, took only care, they might have the Honour, to be seen at Play with Quality. But some certain, very nice, Persons, especially one, took it so to Heart, that dear Basset should be expos'd, that my honest Intentions were quite frustrated, and that the Piece might be sure to be ruin'd, their Majesties were told, it was so obscene, that it was not fit to be Acted; when, I can prove, there has not, these seven years, been any Comedy so free from it; and some good Judges were pleas'd to Declare, they thought that, the only Reason some People had to find fault. Obscenity is a thing of that abominble Na∣ture, that unless it be detected so throughly, that it may be pu∣nished, it were better not heeded at all, (especially, by a Lady) who, in my Opinion, being too Witty in such a Discovery, will only give People to understand, how well skill'd She is in the Matter.
My LORD, I most Humbly beg your Lordships Pardon for this Digression, thô I could not well Publish the Play, with∣out some Defence in this kind; but I have done with 'em now, and the hottest Censurer shall at leisure cool of himself: I will only rally my own ill Fortune, and say, with that admirable French Moralist; Fortune, Ie me repends de t'voir suivie, & cognoissant que tu ne peux chos. du monde advoüë que la vertu est le seul port où les hommes peuvent-trouver leur veritable tranquil∣lité.
A Sentence, which, I'm sure, your Lordship throughly under∣stands, having been with choicest Care Bred, and Learned in the nicest Rudiments of Morality, Wit, and Religion, and there∣fore skill'd in what concerns all Mankind in general, as well as Poets, who are Condemn'd to Traffick with all sort of Hu∣mours, and to be oblig'd to such as will own themselves pleas'd, with what they like. A Fatigue, which I can the better bear, because it offends me little, which way soever it happens, al∣ways believing, that, next diverting my Friends, to please my Self, is the best-method; but as my Friends satisfaction takes Place first, I hope this Comedy will not appear distastful to 'em, especially to you, being Corrected, And My Lord, thus Humbly Dedicated, By
