Most Gracious Soveraign,
THis Moderate Apology, for Indulging just Christian Liberty, to truly Tender Consciences, (not separating from the Publick Liturgy of the Church of Eng∣land) in Not Bowing at, or to the name of Jesus, and Not Kneeling in the Act of Receiving, (except some short Additions, suiting it to the present Occasion) was compile, and part of it At the end of Lame Giles his Haltings, 1630. Prin∣ted, thirty two years since, for my own Necessary Defence, and others Satisfaction.
The chief cause of its present Publication, is the Justifi∣cation of Two of Your Majesties Royal, Christian In∣dulgences to Tender Consciences, generally promised in Your Gratious Letter and Declaration from Breda, (the contents whereof so miraculously Bowed the Hearts of all Your English Subjects, notwithstanding their former disloyal Engagements and Oppositions against Your Vn∣doubted Hereditary Right, to reign over them as their KING, that they all as one man, immediately dispatch∣ed the self-same Message to Your then Exiled Majesty, as

the men of 2 Sam: 19.14 15 Judah did to their King David, (when thrust out of his Kingdom by Absoloms Vsurpation) Re∣turn thou and all thy Servants,) And since Your Ma∣jesties most glorious Return from thence, and Happy Re∣stauration, thus really performed, and particularly granted, expressed in Your Octob. 5. 1660 Royal Declaration to all Your Loving Subjects of Your Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales, concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs.
Pag 16, 17▪ Provided, That none shall be denyed the Sa∣crament of the Lords Supper, though they do not use the Gesture of Kneeling in the Act of Receiving.
No man shall be compelled to bow at the Name of IESUS, or suffer in any kind for not doing it.
Which Indulgent Declaration so ravished the Hearts of all Your Loving Subjects, that Your whole House of Commons (their Representatives) then assembled in Parliament, immediately after its Publication, Novemb. 9. 160. repair∣ed in a Body to Whitehall, and there by their Speakers Oration in the Banqueting-House, expressed their ex∣traordinary great Ioy, and presented their generall Thanks to Your Maesty, for this Your most gra∣tious Declaration, and dispensation with their Con∣sciences in these and other matters, not being of the substance or essence of Religion; hich gave abundant satisfaction to all peaceable, sober-minded men, and such as are truly Religious; In which return of their Thanks they were all unanimous, Nemine Con∣tradicente, then Ordering a Bill to be drawn in pur∣suance of Your Majesties Directions therein.
Yet notwithstanding the premises, such was the Presump∣tion of an Over-Ceremonious Doctor, (though Chaplain to Your Majesty) as May 20. 1. soon after publikely to deny the Sacra∣ment of the Lords Supper to my self, and other Mem∣bers of the Commons House (when ordered to receive it all together in St. Margarets Church, at the beginning of this Parliament) because we kneeled not down to re∣ceive it from his hand, raving the benefit of Your Maje¦sties

Declaration, and Liberty to receive it sitting, being the gesture which Here proved, p. 65, 66, 67, 68. Christ himself and his Apo∣stles used at its first institution and celebration; who (as Homil. 82. in Mat. c. 26. St. Chrysostome, Enratio in Mat. c. 26. p 26. in Marc. 14. p. 109. in Luc. 22. p. 201. Here, p. 67. Theophylact, with other Antients, and some Calvin, Ca∣mererarius, Be∣za in Mat. 26. modern Divines affirm) after he had eaten the Passeover standing, as they conjec∣ture (though the Evangelists and most See Gul. Suckius, An∣tiqu. Conviv. l. 2 c. 34. others accord they did eat it sitting) Sate down on purpose with his Disciples to celebrate and receive the Lords Supper sitting; to Thomas Bea∣con, Here p. 71. signifie thereby, that they were then come to their Journeys end, the perfection of Religion and Sacraments.
This publick contempt of Your Majesties Declaration, seconded with the sedulous Endeavours of others, totally to deprive Your loyal, peaceable consciencious Subjects, constant∣ly resorting to Common Prayer, the Lords Supper, and all Gods publick Ordinances without separation, of all the Indulgence therein expresly granted and really inten∣ded to them by Your Majesty, to their great Disconsolati∣on, in Derogation of Your Royal Prerogative as Su∣preme 26 H. 8. c. 1, 3, 27 H, 8. c. 15.28 H. 8 c. 7, 14, 32 H 8. c. 22, 24, 26, 31 H. 8. c. 1, 14, 3 H. 8. c. 29, 34, & 35 H. 8. c. 9, 19, 35 H 8 c. 1. 37 H. 8. c. 17. 1 E▪ 6. c. 2. 1 Eliz. c. 1.

Ecclesiastical, who have no Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, but what is derived to them by, from, and under Your Majesty, nor any power to controll Your Majesties Dispensations, or Christian compassions to tender Consciences, have engaged me, (out of Duty to Your Majesty, sincere desires to prevent all future Scismes in matters merely Indifferent and Ceremonial, and to wipe off those unjust aspersions usually cast upon them, for not bowing at or to the Name of Je∣sus, or not kneeling at the Lords Supper, as Persons obstinately Scismatical, void of all Grounds of Scrip∣ture, Reason, Conscience, Antiquity, inducing them to scruple or omit these Ceremonies;) to publish this Apology in their behalf, consisting of Three Serious and Sober In∣quiries; Wherein all the Arguments, Reasons, Authori∣ties for Bowing at or to the Name of Jesus, either as a pretended Duty, or necessary Ceremony, grounded on

Philippians 2.9, 10, 11. are largely examined, refuted, retorted, and those for Sitting or Kneeling in the Act of Receiving the Lords Supper, summarily discussed, with such Christian Ingenuity, and Moderation, as (I humbly conceive) will give ample satisfaction to Your Majesty, and the most zealous Champions for these Ceremonies, that their Non-conformity to their use, proceeds not from any Scismatical humor, singularity, or discontent, (as is u∣sually suggested) but from such solid grounds of Scripture, Reason, and such Authorities, Antiquities, as have fully convinced their Judgements, satisfied or scrupled their tender Consciences, that they cannot Rom. 14.23. in faith or con∣science▪ submit to practise them, at least upon such unsatis∣factory Pretences of Scripture, Reason, Antiquity, or apparent Mistakes, as have hitherto been alleadged for their use, by those who have most enforced them. And that as there were just Grounds in point of Royal Justice, Piety, Cle∣meny, Christian compassion, State Policy, and Pru∣dence for Your Sacred Majesty, at first to grant thse In∣dulgences to tender Consciences, to prevent all future Scismes, preserve Your Kingdoms, Churches publick Peace, and Christian Amity, Unity, Communion among Your Protestant Subjects; So there are the like reasons for Your Majesty to continue, if not perpetuate them, without enforcing them against their Consciences, so far as either to∣tally to debarre them the Lords Supper, or drive them from the publick Ordinances, or inevitably to subject them to Ecclesiastical censures, to their great vexation.
For which end, I shall most humbly crave leave to present these ensuing Particulars to Your Majesties Royal, and others Christian consideration.
1. That 1 Tim 1.17. Iud. 25. God only wise, (the sole Exod. 25.40. Isay 33.22. Mat. 4.10. c. 15.9. Iohn .20, to 25. c. 15.10. Psal 40 6. Isaiah 1.1. Heb. 8.5. Iam. .12. Mat. 28.20. 1 Cor. 11.23. Author, Pre∣scriber, Owner of his own Divine worship and Sacra∣ments) hath left all Cororal gestures relating thereunto, free, arbitrary, and indifferent to all Christians, Ntions, Churches, Ages, not particularly or precisely commanding in the Old or New Testament, either the gestures of Kneeling, Sitting, Standing, Bowing, or Prostration in

Publick or Private Prayer, Thanksgiving, Fasts, hearing or reading his Word, receiving Sacraments, or any other par of Divine worship, though he hath absolutely comman∣ded thse Duties themselves. The reason is apparent, because these Gestures are in themselves things merely indif∣ferent, and one Gesture may be more decent, expedient to tir up affection, devotion, reverence, attention, upon several emrgent occasions, in relation to the same, or different per∣sons, duties, times, than another; and many men by reason of age, sickness, infirmities, temper of body, custome of Coun∣tries, Nations, (which See Centur. Magd. , to 14. cap. 6. & pur∣chas his Pil∣grimage. vary from each other) incon∣veniency of Place, crowds of People, or the like, may be disabled to use one Gesture with so much devotion or conveni∣ency as they can use another: For which Reasons in numerou Congregations no absolute Uniformity in these Gestures can possibly be expected, nor rationally injoyned by any humane Powers, since God himself the Supreme Legislator upon these grounds, hath left them free and arbitrary to his People, as August▪ ad Simpli. l: 2. qu. 4. Archbp. Whitguift, Hooke, p. Morton, Dr. Boye, Dr. John Buges, Paybody, with others quoted by them. all Divines acknowledge; whence the Church, Saints, Apostles, Children of God in all Ages, both under the Law and Gospel, (as Scripture Presidents demonstrate) have by Gods approbatio some∣times prayed and worshipped God Num. 61.9. Deut. 29.10. Ezr. 9.15. Mar: 11.29. Lu. 28.11, 13. Jo. 7.37. Lu. 7.38 Gen. 19.27. Lev.  5.  Chron. 6.12 c. 20.13. Psal. 106.23. standing other∣whiles Judg. 0.26. 2 Sam. 7.18. 2 Chron 17.16. Ezr. 9.4 c. 10 9 Neh. 1.4. Ps 137. 1. Ioah 36. Ier. 15.17. Ezech. 8.1.14. c. 14.1 c. 20. 1. Mat. 26.15. sitting, other times Ps. 95.6. Gen. 24.26. Exod. 4.31. c. 34.8. 2 Chron. 29.28, 29, 30. Neh. 8.6. Dan. 5.7. Lu, 17.16. Acts 20.13.14. c. 19.4. c. 22.8. bowing, and falling down prostrate on their faces; sometimes Ps. 6.6 ps. 63.6. Ps. 149.5. Hos. 7.14. Gen. 47.31. lying on their beds, couches, and othertimes Ps. 95.6. Deut. 9.18, 25. Dan. 6.10. 1 Kings 8.54. Lu. 22.41. Acts 7.60. c. 9.40. c. 20.34. c. 21.5. kneeling on their knees; God alwayes Acts 10.34, 35 Rom. 10.11, 12, 13. Iam. 1.5, 6. c. 5.16. accepting their Prayers, worship in every of these Postures when their Hearts and Spirits (which he principally 1 Sam. 16.7. 1 Chron. 28.9. Iohn 4.23, 24. regards, requires, in his worship) were upright, sincere, and their Duties performed with that Faith, Fervency, Holyness, and chearfull Obedience, which he commands.
2ly. That the Primitive Saints, Christians, Church, and all other Churches since ave freely used, tollerated varieties of Gestures, Postures, Ceremonies in all parts of Divine worship, and have free liberty to alter, change or abolish Ceremonies at their pleasure; as all Eccle∣siastical Histories (especially Centuriae Magdeburgenses▪ 2, to 14. cap. 6. De Ritibus & Ceremoniis) at large demonstrate; and the Curch of England resolves in her 20. Aticle of Religion, and the Preface to the Books of Common Prayer, why some Ceremonies are abo∣lished.
3ly. That the principle end of Gods instituting Kings, Ma∣gistrates, and Chief Authority, Trust by him reposed in them, is, To b Gods subordinate Rom. 13.1, to 7.1 Pet 2.13.14, 20 Ps. 101 im. 1.9, 10. Ezr. 7.26. Ministers to protect, en∣courage, commend all their Subjects who do well, obeying the Lawes and will of God according to his Word; and to punish none but evil Doers, and Trans∣gressors of his Lawes in relation to his Worship: not to punish their Christian Subjects who obey Gods Laws, re∣sort constantly to his publick Ordinances, Worship, Sacra∣ments, only or not using such and such Gestures, Ceremonies, Vstures, which himself hath left free and indifferent to all Christians; or to fine, imprison, excommunicate, or debar them totally from the Lords Supper, only for using the self∣same Gestures, Ceremonies, as Christ himself, his Apostles, and the Primitive Christians used; for which there is no Presi∣dent in Scripture, nor in the See my Sword of Christian Magistracy sup∣ported, p. 35, to 79.Laws of any antient Christian Emperors to the best of my remembrance.
4ly. That though Christian Kings and Church-Gover∣nours have Authority to Acts 15.28, 29, 30, 31. c. 16 4. 1 Cor. 14.34, 35, 40. Ar∣ticles of the Church of England▪ Artic. 20. prescribe and enjoyn things absolutely necessary and expedient, warranted by the Word, in and about Gods publick worship, and to 1 Cor. 7, to 10.25, 26, &c. c. 1.4, to 18. advise and perswade the use of Things decent, ex∣pedient, though not simply necessary: Yet it is the Opinion of many judicious Divines, that they cannot impose or en∣force the use of Ceremonies, Gestures merely expedient o∣ent, not absolutly necessary, on the Consciences of their Chri∣stian

Subjects, under Civil or Ecclesastical penalties: at lastwise that it is not expedient or convenient for them to exercise such a Power, because Christ himself, the 1 Tim. 6.15. Rev. 19.16.King of Kings, his Apostles, & the most Religious Kings of Gods ap∣pointment, never exercised or claimed any such Iurisdiction, but left all Christians free, actually to use or not use them at their pleasure; as in the cases of 1 Cor. 7.1, 2, 3, 5, to 10. & 16. to the end. 1 Tim. 4.4. Marriage, Virgini∣ty, and single life; of Act. 10. Rom. 14. 1 Cor. 8. Col. 2.16. to the end. 1 Tim. 4.1, to 8. eating or abstaining from certain Meats, observing certain times and dayes to God; of 1 Cor. 11.2. to 17. Rev. 9.8. mens praying and prophesying in the Church with their heads covered, wearing long Effeminate hair, and womens sitting in the Con∣gregation with their heads unvailed, and 1 Tim. 2.9. 1 Pet. 3.3, . Tertullian De Velandis Vir∣ginibus, & De habitu Mulie∣um. Bray∣ding or Frizling their hair, (which most conceive to be absolutely prohibited, not simply advised, as well as their 1 Cor. 14.34, 35. 1 Tim 2.11, 12. speaking in the Church) yet not now prohibi∣ted by any Ecclesiastical penall Laws or Censures of our Church, though more scandalous, lesse arbitrary and indif∣ferent than sitting at the Sacrament, kneeling, or standing in Prayer, bowing, or any other Rites or Ceremonies, now scrupled or omitted by Tender Consciences.
5ly. That the Unity which God himself requires in his Church, and Publick worship, amongst his People and Children, is not an Vniversal Vniformity in external gestures, Ceremonies, wherein the Scripture is totally si∣lent, but a EZ. 8.1.2, &c. Ps. 122.1, 2, 3, 4. Ps. 133.1. Eph 4.3, 13. John 17.11, 20▪ 21. Rom. 15.5, 6, 7. 1 Cor. 1.1. Act. 1.14. c. 2.1.46. c. 5.1. Phil. 2 . Zeph. 3.9 Isai. 2.2, 3. Mich 4.1, 2, . Jer. 50.4, 5▪ 1 Pet. 2.8. Unity in the Faith and substance of his worship, a meeting together with one accord, and with one consent, in one place, to pray, praise and worship God, with one heart, mind, soul, spirit, ac∣cording o his word, (ot with one kind of vesture, ge∣sture, or posture of their bodies) and to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, like Christian Bre∣thren not Heb. 10.24, 25. forsaking or separating from Gods Publick Ordinances by Law established on the one hand, nor ca∣sing brethren out of the Church Iohn 9.10. (Diotrephes like for not conforming in gestures or ceremonie, on the other hand.) Hence all particular Churches, Christians, and Professors of the Gospel, dispersed throughout

the world, agreeing all together in the Ephes. 4.3▪ 4, 5▪ 11, 12. c. 1.22, 23▪ c. 3.10. c. 5.23, to 33 Iohn 17.1, 2, 23. Hebr. 12.22, 23. Cant. 6.9. 1 Cor. 8.6. c. 10.17. c. 12.4, to 31. Unity of the Faith, are by God himself called, reputed, but One Catho∣lick Church, & One Body, United together under One Head Jesus Christ, quickned, inlivened by one and the self∣same Spirit; although they differ in their particular Rites, Ceremonies, Gestures, Liturgies, Languages; as the va∣rious, different Members in the Body naturall, being all united together under one Head, make up but 1 Cor. 12.4, to 27. one intire Body: And men of various Callings, Professions, Qualities, Degrees, living under the same King, Laws, Government▪ agreeing in aliquo tertio, make up but one Kingdom, Corporation, or Body Politique, though they diffr frm each other in their particular Callings, Habits, Ages, Degrees, Estates, Opinion, 1 Cor. 14. Acts 2▪ 1, to 3. Languages, Gestures, and other personal circumstances. If we look into all our great Cathedral or Parish Churches, we shall see thousands or hundreds of people joyntly resorting to Gods publike Ordinances, Worship, Sa∣craments celebrated in thm, yet varying rom each other in their Dignities, Sexes, Ages, Callings, Conditions, Estates, Vestments, Attirs, Fashions, Features, yea private Opinions, Voyce, Corporal gstures; some of them sitting in seats, others in galleries, others on forms; others standing in allies; here Psal. 148.11, 12, 13. Deut. 29.10, 11, 12. 2 Chr. 20.13▪ Exod. 15.1, 2, 20, 21. Acts 2.17.1. men and women▪ there old men, young men, chil∣dren sitting or standing promisuously together, other∣where men and women, fitting or standing apart from each other; some praying standing, whiles others kneel; o∣thers praying, reading▪ singing with an audible voice, (though differing in tones or tunes from each other like Pipes in an Organ, or strings in a Lute) yet all making sweet Ephes. 5.1. Col 3.16▪17. me∣lody and harmony in Gods ears, and but one Congrega∣tion; as vaiey of Trees, herbs, flowers of different kinds, colours, shapes, virtues in one garden, bed, make up but one pleasant, fruitull Garden, to which the Cant. 4.12, 16. c. 5.1 c. 6.2.11. Isaiah 58.1. Church is com∣pared. Why then should any conscientious godly Ministers or Christians who approve & frequent Gods publik▪ Ordinances, Sacraments in our Church, be sequestred from them, or any wayes molested as Non-conformists or Schismaticks, only not for bowing, kneeling or standing up when others do?

or for sitting at the Sacrament as Christ and his Apostles did, whiles others receive it kneeling? only against te bare advice or direction, not peremptory Injunction of the Ru∣bricks, or other Ecclesiastical Canon.
6ly. That the principal Cent. Magd. 2, to 14. cap. 6. De Ritibus & Ceremoniis & cap. 8. De Schismatibus. Fox▪ Acts ad Monuments, Bshop Vsher▪ De Christiana∣rum Ecclesi∣arum succes∣sione & statu. Antiqitates Ecclesiae Brit. in vita Augusti∣ni, p. 4.5, &c. Occasion of all antient, modern Schisms in, and Separations from our own and other Churches, yea, of most unchristian divisions, contenti∣ons in them, and of intestine Wars, commotions between Christians; hath been the over-rigid enforcing of meer hu∣man Rites, Ceremonies, gestures, Inventions in Gods Worship, by ambitious usurping Popes, Prelates, and Clergy-men, against the rules of Christian Liberty, Charity, and our Saviours Commission to his Apostles. Mat. 28.19, 20. To teach all Nations, to observe all things what¦soever he hath commanded them, not their own Mat. 15.3, 6 9. Ma. 7.7, 8 Col. 2.21, 22. 1 Tim. 4.1, 2. Heb. 13.9. 1 Tim. 6.20, 21. Doctrines, Traditions, or Humane Inventions. And this (if truly examined) was the original of all our late intestine Schisms, Wars, Tumults, which Christian Moderation, Liberty, and Indulgence in these particulars, would easily have prevented, and will be the best antidote against the like future Maladies, as Your Majesty intimates in Your Royal Declarations and Speeches.
7ly. That God himself having 1 Cor. 9.16, 17, &c. Mat. 28.19, 20. 2 Tim. 4.1.2. Acts 20.28. Iohn 21.15.16, 17. 1 Pet. 2.5. laid a necessity and peremptory Precept upon all conscientiou Ministers, to preach the Gospel, and Administer the Sacra∣ments to their Flocks, and also commanded the people to Isaiah 55.3. Ioh. 10.3, 10▪ 17. Mat. 8.8, 21. 1 Cor. 11.24, to 2. Prov. 28.9. hear his Word, receive his Sacraments, and frequent his publick Ordinances, under pain of Ever∣lasting woe and damnation; in the performance of these Religious duties, they ought in Acts 4.1. chap. 5.29, 39, 40, 41. Luke 1.1. Da. 6.5, &c. 2 Kig 13.3, .▪ 10.  Caus. 11. qu. 3. Conscience to obey God, who enjoynes them, rather than men, who prohibit them. Therefore no Christian Magistrates, or Church Governors can in Conscience or Prudence (unlesse they will Act 5.39. ight even against God, in Gamalels resolution)

prohibit or debarre them from performing thir duties, or resorting to Gods Ordinances or Sacraments, only for Non-conformity to such Gestures or Ceemonies which God hath left free and indifferens to them, and are no essential parts of, or necssary appurtenances to his Worship.
8ly. That it is the Doctrine of Optatus Melivitanus, St. Augustine, and other Fathers of old against the Dona∣tists, and of the Arti 27 & Rogers there∣on, Bishop Whitgist, Morton▪ Hocker & others. Church of England, and her Bi∣shops, Divines at this day against Anabaptist, and Sepa∣ratists, (who separate from our Churches, because there are many Goates, Tares, and wicked men, as well as Sheep, Wheat, Saints admitted into, and unto the Sacraments, Ordinances administred in them;) That it is the Mat. 3.12. c. 13.24, to 31.47, to 52. c. 25.32, 33. See Dr. Feild of the Church, h. 1. c. 7, 8, 9, 10. Morney, De Ecclesia. Will of God and Christ, that Sheep and Goats, Tares, Chaff and Wheat, Good and Bad, should live, grow, and continue together in the visible Church, till Christ himself shall separate them at the day of Judge∣ment; and that no visible Church on Earth ever did or shall consist only or mostly of real Saints and Christi∣ans truly regenerate. If then Goats, Tares, and unregene∣rate men, externally profssing the Gospel of Christ, are there freely permitted to live, grow within the Church, by our Bi∣shops, Magistrates, yea freely admitted to all Gods Ordinan∣ces, notwithstanding their unregeneracy and impenitence, without molestation or seclusion, though Sic sunt in Ecclesia & domo Dei, t non per tin∣ant ad com∣paginem do∣mus nec ad societatem fr∣geae pacifi∣cae que justi∣ciae. Augustine de Baptismo, l. 7. c. 51. De Civitat. Dei l. 20. c. 9 Dr. Feild of the Church c. 8, 9. no constituting Members of the true Church of Christ, consisting only of the Elect: Then much more ought those Conscientious Godly Ministers, and Christians, truly fearing God, and studying Act. 24.16. c. 23 1. to keep a good Conscience in all things void of offence both towards God and men, living in all good Conscience, and Phil. 1.27. walking as becomes the Gos∣pel of Iesus Christ, who are real constituting Members of Christs Church, not to be deprived of their Mini∣stry, Gods Publick Ordinances, Sacraments, or cast out of the Church  no Members of it, for Non-conformi∣ty to such Gestures or Ceremonies,  God himself hath not prescribed, and are not essential or necessa∣ry

in his publick worship; but to live quietl without distur∣anc; left the Styrists censure against suc proceedings,
Iuvenal Sa∣tyr 1 p 11. Dat veniam Corvis, vexat censura Columbas.
and our Saiours sentence be justly charged upon unmercifull Church-Governours, Mat. 23.23, 24. Lu 1.42. Wo unto you Scribes and Parisees, Hypocrites, for ye tythe mint, and anis and cummin, but have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, Iudgement, Mercy, and Faith. Ye blinde Guides which straine at a Gnat, and swallow a Camell.
These 8. Considerations, together with that Divine Oacle of the wisest of Kings, Prov. 20.28. Mercy and Truth preserve the King, and his Throne is uphol∣den by Mercy (engraven no doubt in Your Majesties Roy∣al Heart with indelible Characters) super added to the Three Serious & Sober Inquiies here humbly prostrated at Your Majesties feet, and submitted to Your most Graci∣ous perusal, and Judicious Royal censure, will (in my weak apprehension) abundantly satisfie all the Reverend Bishops & Clergy of our Church, with all Your sober∣minded Subjects, studious of Your Majesties Honour, or our Churches tranquility, that there are as just Ground for Your Majesty to continue and perpetuate Your pre∣mised Indulgences to tender Consciences, as at first to grant them; That so all Your Loyal and Loving Subjects, though of different Perswasions, may have still cause to pro∣claim to all the world with publick Ioy and Triumph, (af∣ter so many late tragical Revolutions of publick Go∣vernours and Governments in order to their just desired Civil and Christian Liberties) this assertion of the Poet,
Claudian De Ludibi Sli∣conis, l. 3. Fallitur Egregio quisquis Sub Principe credit Servitium; Nunquam Libertas gratior extat Quam sub Rege pio.
Now the God and 2 Cor. 1.3. Eph. 2.4. Father of all Mercy, whose Ps. 100.5. Ps. 145.7, 8, 9. tender Mercies are over all his works, and hath commanded all his Children (especially Christian Kings who sit on his Royal Throne) to be Lu. 6.36. mercifull as he their Heavenly Father is mercifull; abundantly showre down all Temporal and Spiritual Mercies, Blessings▪ Graces on Your Majesties Royal Person, Consort, Fami∣ly Posterity, Government, Kingdoms; and after a long most Glorious and Gracious Reign on Earth, translate You in peace, triumph, to his 2 Tim. 4.18. Heavenly Kingdom, and there Crown You with an Eternal 1 Pet 1.4. 2 Cor. 4.17. Crown and weight of Glory; Which is, and shall be the daily Prayer of
