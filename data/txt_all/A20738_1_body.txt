AS the losse of old possessiōs, is a griefe to the landed men: euē so the decay of aūtient bokes, is a smart to the learned sort. Titus Liuius father of the Romane historie (whom to see, repaire was made of Gentlemen frō farre places, vvhiles he liued) hath not escaped the iniurie of time, but bin left vnperfitte, to the great sorovv of posteritie, after he dyed, Cornelius Tacitus that folowed him both in mat∣ter and age, could not auoyde that iniquitie, althoughe the Emperor Tacitus commaunded his bokes to be written ten times euery yeare. This Authour Appianus Alexandrinus, hath had the like lucke, for al the estimation he vvas in, the halfe of his labour being lost, and the last part of the vvhole ciuill tumult not now to be had frō him, but briefly supplyed o∣therwise, that the end of the Romanes wo, & the beginning of our ioy, might be declared, the one successiuely folovving of the other. The vvhich it may please your honour to ac∣cept, according to your accustomed goodnesse, beseeching the liuing Lord long to preserue the same.
