MADAM,
'TIs a Maid that Rome ador'd, which now spying a neerer approach to Divinity in You, trans∣mits all her Honors, and submissively bows to a brighter Beauty. She comes to tell you, that if this age pay'd a just respect to Uertue, we had long since Dedicated an Altar to your Highness, where every Generous Heart would have ambition'd to be a sacri∣fice. And though there are few Princesses, whose veins wear so rich a purple as yours, yet you derive greater Ennoblements from your Merit, then extraction. Many Pillars of State have been carved from your Illustrious Stock; but those Excellencies which singly adorn'd your Ancestors, are all Centred, and comprehended in you, not abridg'd, but bound up in one Fair Volume: Persons of your Quality are often dazell'd with their own Splendor, and abus'd with the false Elogies of others; but nature hath given you the best antidote against Flattery, I mean to transcend it: for that which applyed to others would be complement and Hyperbole, when addressed to you, is frigid and poor, and falls beneath the sublime truth. Your Glorious example has made goodness the Fa∣shion at Court; and 'tis yet a Problem, whether that profound Veneration which all render you, be more attracted by that Royal blood which you possess, or allur'd by your Exalted Vertue; Permit me Madam peculiarly to admire your elemency and condescension, when you teach your Eyes so low a flight, as with humble Raies to warm and cherish your inferiors: In this you resemble the Mo∣narch of Coelestial Bodies who ingrosses not his Treasury of Light, but communicates his Beams, and illustrates the World. All

that have beheld you will attest, that a more accurate Idea of Beauty never sprung from a raptured fancy, then you really enjoy: Never was any informed with a clearer and more vigorous Spi∣rit: never were these perfections crowned with a sincerer Good∣ness: 'Tis here, Madam, that Clelia takes sanctuary, and that fair Roman, whose courage scorned the swelling pride of Ty∣ber, (when she submitted her delicate limbs to the waves, and rode upon that Trydent, which sways the liquid Empire) now crosses the Ocean, to tender you a Legitimate duty: I shall oblige her to blend my interest with hers; Since I have had the Glory to be esteemed by Madam your Mother, and the Count of Sois∣sons your Uncle; And your Highness knows best my eminent in∣gagements to Madam de Longveuille and her Family: I value it as no small honour, that some of my alliance have been numbred in your Retinue; In fine, I my self have intirely compleated se∣ven years under the command of my Lord the Prince of Carignan your Uncle, in the Arms of the Great Charles Emanuel his Fa∣ther, whose affection I must ever esteem as the choysest largess of my Fortune. These incouragements (Madam) have made Clelia presume your shelter: she promises her self a lustre from your shadow; which though you vouchsafe; my felicity will not be compleat, except you add the permission of being all my Life,
Madam
