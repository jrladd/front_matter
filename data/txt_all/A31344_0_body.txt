MADAM,
THere need no other Considerations, to recommend, and per∣petuate the Memory of my Lady Cholmondeley, than the Merits of her Life; it being hardly possible, to think the World should forget so Great a Good, as long as any sense of Piety or Gratitude continues in it.
But since your Ladyship, and your Honourable Relations are pleas'd to command, my poor Mite should be cast in towards that pious End, I am, neither to dispute the Doing, nor Event of it, but to shew my Obedience in both.
And as for the Disproportion the Funeral Discourse upon the Perusal must be found, to carry to the dignity of the Subject, it would be Vanity in me, to attempt any thing of Apology for this; being, it may be well suppos'd, nothing more could be expected from me, than to draw below the Value of so high a Character.
However, as far short as the Representation falls of being per∣fect,
I doubt, there are few Persons, who survive, so good, but if they would endeavour, to come as near the Life of the Honourable Original, as that does, they might be better. And indeed, when all is done, the most effectual Method to transmit the Vertues of so rare an Example to her Posterity, is not so much to write, as to live 'em down thither. In which respect your Ladyship is likely to afford the most natural and lively Transcript; who have been al∣ways known to live so, as well to imitate, as to honour so truly Great and Honourable a Parent. And it must be confess'd in so happy an Imitation, your Ladyship will make the greatest Recom∣pence, that can be for the Loss of so Excellent a Person, by ma∣king your self as Great, and Good, as She was.
Your Ladyship will please, to take this, as it is intended, not to direct, but to wish you constant success in that Vertuous and Reli∣gious Course, your own judicious Choice, as well as so Dear an Example has all along induc'd you to pursue: And as the perfect Accomplishments in that way; I mean, in the way of Vertue and Religion, are indeed the highest Felicity your Ladyship will meet with on this side Heaven: So next to that, if your Ladyship vouchsafes your Acceptance of this, and the Continuance of your Favour to him, that humbly offers it; This will be the greatest Happiness and Honour to,
MADAM,
