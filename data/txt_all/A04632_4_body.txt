MY LORD,
IF euer any ruine were so great, as to suruiue; I thinke this be one I send you: the Fal of Seianus. It is a poeme, that (if I well re∣member) in your Lo. sight, suf∣fer'd no lesse violence from our people here, then the subiect of it did from the rage of the people of Rome; but, with a different fate, as (I hope) merit: For this hath out-liu'd their malice, and begot it selfe a greater fauour then he lost, the loue of good men. Amongst whom, if I make your Lo. the first it thankes, it is not without a iust confession of the bond your benefits haue, and euer shall hold vpon me.
