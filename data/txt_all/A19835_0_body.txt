THat which their zeale, whose onely zeale was bent
To shew the best they could, that might delight
Your royall minde, did lately represent
Renowmed Empresse to your Princely sight:
Is now the offring of their humblenesse;
Here consecrated to your glorious name;
Whose happy presence did voutchsafe to blesse
So poore presentments, and to grace the same:
And though it be in th'humblest ranke of words,
And in the lowest region of our speach,
Yet is it in that kinde, as best accords
With rurall passions, which vse not to reach
Beyond the groues, and woods where they were bred
And best become a claustrall exercise,
Where men shut out, retyr'd, and sequestred
From publicke fashion, seeme to sympathize
With innocent, and plaine simplicitie:
And liuing here vnder the awfull hand
Of discipline, and strict obseruancie,
Learne but our weaknesses to vnderstand,
And therefore dare not enterprize to show
In lowder stile the hidden mysteries,
And artes of Thrones, which none that are below
The Sphere of action, aud the exercise
Of power, can truly shew: though men may straine
Conceipt aboue the pitch where it should stand,
And forme more monstrous figures then containe
A possibilitie, and goe beyond
The nature of those managements so farre,
As oft their common decencie they marre:
Whereby the populasse (in whom such skill
Is needlesse) may be brought to apprehend
Notions, that may turne all to a taste of ill
What euer power shall do, or might intend:
And thinke all cunning, all proceeding one,
And nothing simple, and sincerely done:
Yet the eye of practise, looking downe from hie
Vpon such ouer-reaching vanitie,
Sees how from errour t'error it doth slote,
As from an vnknowne Ocean int' a Gulfe:
And how though th'Woolfe, would counterfeit the Goate,
Yet euery chinke bewrayes him for a Woolfe.
And therefore in the view of state t'haue showd
A counterfeit of state, had been to light
A candle to the Sunne, and so bestowd
Our paines to bring our dimnesse vnto light.
For maiestie, and power, can nothing see
Without it selfe, that can sight-worthy be.
And therefore durst not we but on the ground,
From whence our humble Argument hath birth
Erect our Scene, and thereon are we found,
And if we fall, we fall but on the earth,
From whence we pluckt the flowers that here we bring;
Which if at their first opening they did please,
It was enough, they serue but for a spring,
The first sent is the best in things as these:
Amusicke of this nature on this ground,
Is euer wont to vanish with the sound.
But yet your royall goodnesse may raise new,
Grace but the Muses they will honour you.
Chi non fa, non falla.
