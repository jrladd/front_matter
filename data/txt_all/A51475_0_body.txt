SIR,
HAving receiv'd the Ho∣nour
of Your Majesty's
Commands to Translate the
History of the League, I have
apply'd my self with my ut∣most
diligence to Obey them:
First by a thorough understan∣ding
of my Authour, in which
I was assisted by my former
knowledge of the French Histo∣ry,
in general, and in particu∣lar
of those very Transactions,
which he has so Faithfully and

Judiciously related: Then by
giving his Thoughts the same
Beauty in our Language which
they had in the Original; and
which I most of all endeavour'd,
the same force and perspicui∣ty:
Both of which I hope I
have perform'd with some
Exactness, and without any
Considerable Mistake. But of
this Your Majesty is the truest
Judge, who are so great a Ma∣ster
of the Original, and who
having read this piece when
it first was publish'd, can easily
find out my Failings, but to
my Comort can more easily
forgive them: I confess I cou'd
never have laid hold on that
Vertue of Your Royal Clemen∣cy
at a more unseasonable
time; when your Enemies have
so far abus'd it, that Pardons

are grown dangerous to Your
Safety, and consequently to
the Welfare of Your Loyal
Subjects: But frequent forgive∣ness
is their Encouragement,
they have the Sanctuary in
their Eye before they attempt
the Crime, and take all mea∣sures
of Security, either not to
need a Pardon, if they strike the
Blow, or to have it granted if
they fail: Upon the whole mat∣ter
Your Majesty is not upon
equal Terms with them, You
are still forgiving, and they
still designing against Your Sa∣cred
Life; Your principle is
Mercy, theirs inveterate Ma∣lice;
when one onely Wards,
and the other Strikes, the pro∣spect
is sad on the defensive
side. Hercules as the Poets tell
us had no advantage on Anteus

by his often throwing him on
he ground: for he laid him
nely in his Mothers Lap, which
n effect was but doubling his
Strength to renew the Combat.
These Sons of Earth are never
to be trusted in their Mother
Element: They must be hoy∣sted
into the Air and Strangled.
If the Experiment of Clemency
were new, if it had not been
often try'd without Effect, or
rather with Effects quite con∣trary
to the intentions of Your
Goodness, your Loyal Subjects
are generous enough to pity
their Countrey-men, though
Offenders: But when that pity
has been always found to draw
into example of greater Mis∣chiefs;
when they continually
behold both Your Majesty and
themselves expos'd to Dangers,

the Church, the Government,
the Succession still threatned,
Ingratitude so far from being
Converted by gentle means,
that it is turn'd at last into the
nature of the damn'd, desirous
of Revenge, and harden'd in
Impenitence; 'Tis time at
length, for self preservation to
cry out for Justice, and to lay
by Mildness when it ceases to
be a Vertue. Almighty God
has hitherto Miraculously pre∣serv'd
You; but who knows
how long the Miracle will con∣tinue?
His Ordinary Operati∣ons
are by second Causes, and
then Reason will conclude that
to be preserv'd, we ought to
use the lawfull means of pre∣servation.
If on the other
side it be thus Argu'd, that
of many Attempts one may

possibly take place, if preven∣ting
Justice be not employ'd
against Offenders; What re∣mains
but that we implore the
Divine Assistance to Avert that
Judgment: which is no more
than to desire of God to work
another, and another, and in
Conclusion a whole Series of
Miracles. This, Sir, is the ge∣neral
voice of all true English∣men;
I might call it the Loy∣al
Address of three Nations in∣finitely
solicitous of Your Safe∣ty,
which includes their own
Prosperity. 'Tis indeed an high
presumption for a man so in∣considerable
as I am to pre∣sent
it, but Zeal, and dutifull
Affection in an Affair of this
Importance, will make every
good Subject a Counsellor:
Tis (in my Opinion) the Test

of Loyalty, and to be either a
Friend or Foe to the Govern∣ment,
needs no other distin∣ction
than to declare at this
time, either for Remisness, or
Justice. I said at this time, be∣cause
I look not on the Storm
as Overblown. 'Tis still a gusty
kind of Weather: there is a
kind of Sickness in the Air; it
seems indeed to be clear'd up
for some few hours; but the
Wind still blowing from the
same Corner; and when new
matter is gather'd into a body,
it will not fail to bring it round
and pour upon us a second
Tempest. I shall be glad to
be found a false Prophet; but
he was certainly Inspir'd, who
when he saw a little Cloud ari∣sing
from the Sea, and that no
bigger than a hand, gave im∣mediate

notice to the King,
that he might mount the Cha∣riot,
before he was overtaken
by the Storm. If so much
Care was taken of an Idola∣trous
King, an Usurper, a Per∣secutour,
and a Tyrant, how
much more vigilant ought we
to be in the Concernments of
a Lawfull Prince, a Father of
his Countrey, and a Defender
of the Faith, who stands ex∣pos'd
by his too much Mercy
to the unwearied and endless
Conspiracies of Paricides? He
was a better Prince than the
former whom I mention'd out
of the Sacred History, and the
Allusion comes yet more close,
who stopp'd his hand after
the third Arrow: Three Victo∣ries
were indeed obtain'd, but
the effect of often shooting had

been the total Destruction of
his Enemies. To come yet
nearer, Henry the Fourth, Your
Royal Grandfather, whose Vic∣tories,
and the Subversion of
the League, are the main Ar∣gument
of this History, was a
Prince most Clement in his
Nature, he forgave his Rebels,
and receiv'd them all into
Mercy, and some of them in∣to
Favour, but it was not till
he had fully vanquish'd them:
they were sensible of their Im∣piety,
they submitted, and his
Clemency was not extorted
from him, it was his Free-gift,
and it was seasonably given.
I wish the Case were here the
same, I confess it was not much
unlike it at Your Majesty's hap∣py
Restauration, yet so much
f the parallel was then want∣ing,

that the Amnesty you
gave, produc'd not all the de∣sir'd
Effects. For our Sects,
are of a more obstinate Nature
than were those Leaguing Ca∣tholiques,
who were always for
a King, and yet more, the
major part of them wou'd have
him of the Royal Stem: But
our Associators and Sectaries are
men of Commonwealth prin∣ciples,
and though their first
stroke was onely aim'd at the
immediate Succession, it was
most manifest that it wou'd not
there have ended; for at the
same time they were hewing
at your Royal Prerogatives:
So that the next Successor, if
there had been any, must
have been a precarious Prince,
and depended on them for the
necessaries of Life. But of these

and more Outragious pro∣ceedings,
your Majesty has al∣ready
shewn your self justly
sensible in Your Declaration,
after the Dissolution of the last
Parliament, which put an end
to the Arbitrary Encroach∣ments
of a Popular Faction:
Since which time it has pleas'd
Almighty God so to prosper
Your Affairs, that without
searching into the secrets of
Divine Providence, 'tis evident
Your Magnanimity and Re∣solution,
next under him, have
been the immediate Cause of
Your Safety and our present
Happiness. By weathering of
which Storm, may I presume
to say it without Flattery, You
have perform'd a Greater and
more Glorious work than all
the Conquests of Your Neigh∣bours.

For 'tis not difficult fo
a Great Monarchy well united,
and making use of Advantages,
to extend its Limits; but to
be press'd with wants, surroun∣ded
with dangers, Your Au∣thority
undermined in Popular
Assemblies, Your Sacred Life
attempted by a Conspiracy,
Your Royal Brother forc'd
from Your Arms, in one word
to Govern a Kingdom which
was either possess'd, or turn'd
into a Bedlam, and yet in the
midst of ruine to stand firm,
undaunted, and resolv'd, and
at last to break through all
these difficulties, and dispell
them, this is indeed an Action
which is worthy the Grand∣son
of Henry the Great. Du∣ring
all this violence of Your
Enemies Your Majesty has con∣tended

with Your natural Cle∣mency
to make some Exam∣ples
of Your Justice, and they
themselves will acknowledge
that You have not urg'd the
Law against them, but have
been press'd and constrain'd by
it to inflict punishments in Your
own defence, and in the mean
time to watch every Opportu∣nity
of shewing Mercy, when
there was the least probability
of Repentance: so that they
who have suffer'd may be tru∣ly
said to have forc'd the Sword
of Justice out of Your hand,
and to have done Execution
on themselves. But by how
much the more You have been
willing to spare them, by so
much has their Impudence in∣creas'd,
and if by this Mildness
they recover from the Great

Frot, which has almost blasted
them to the roots, if these ve∣nemous
plants shoot out again,
it will be a sad Comfort to say
they have been ungratefull,
when 'tis Evident to Mankind
that Ingratitude is their Na∣ture:
That sort of pity which
is proper for them, and may
be of use to their Conversion
is to make them sensible of
their Errors, and this Your
Majesty out of Your Fatherly
Indulgence amongst other Ex∣periments
which You have
made, is pleas'd to allow them
in this Book; which you have
Commanded to be Translated
for the publique benefit; that
at least all such as are not wil∣fully
blind, may View in it, as
in a Glass, their own deformi∣ties:
For never was there a

plainer Parallel than of the
Troubles of France, and of
Great Britain; of their Leagues,
Covenants, Associations, and
Ours; of their Calvinists, and
our Presbyterians: they are all
of the same Family, and Titi∣an's
famous Table of the Altar
piece with the Pictures of Vene∣tian
Senatours from Great-Grandfather
to Great-Grand∣son,
shews not more the Re∣semblance
of a Race than this:
For as there, so here, the Fea∣tures
are alike in all, there is
nothing but the Age that makes
the difference, otherwise the
Old man of an hundred and
the Babe in Swadling-clouts,
that is to say, 1584, and 1684.
have but a Century and a Sea
betwixt them, to be the same.
But I have presum'd too much

upon Your Majesty's time al∣ready,
and this is not the place
to shew that resemblance,
which is but too manifest in
the whole History. 'Tis enough
to say Your Majesty has allow'd
our Rebels a greater Favour
than the Law; You have gi∣ven
them the Benfit of their
Clergy: if they can but read
and will be honest enough to
apply it, they may be sav'd.
God Almighty give an answe∣rable
success to this Your Royal
Act of Grace, may they all re∣pent,
and be united as the Bo∣dy
to their Head. May that
Treasury of Mercy which is
within Your Royal Breast have
leave to be powr'd forth upon
them, when they put them∣selves
in a condition of recei∣ving
it; And in the mean time

permit me to Implore it hum∣bly
for my self, and let my
Presumption in this bold Ad∣dress
be forgiven to the Zeal
which I have to Your Service,
and to the publique good. To
conclude, may You never have
a worse meaning Offender at
Your feet, than him who be∣sides
his Duty and his Natural
inclinations, has all manner of
Obligations to be perpetually,
Sir,
