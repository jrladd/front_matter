RIght honorable, when I considered with my self these no lesse thē dangerous daies, I pur∣posed with deliberation to haue writtē some thing that might haue tended to your bet∣ter liking, but in the meane season the time to the great griefe of all those that feare God, loue his glorious Gos∣pel (without faining) rendred the fruits of loyaltie to hir excellent maiesty, and are carefull louers of their natiue country, presented before me a pitiful spectacle, the view wherof as it was lamentable, so thought I not to ouer∣slip it without the remembraunce of his deserued fame, which, dispite of death, shall liue for euer, albeit his want in Court, Towne and country, be bewailed of Prince, no∣bilitie, Gentlemen, rich and poore. This Phenix sweet Sid∣ney was the flower of curtesie, who in his life time gaue a perfect light in his conuersation to leade men to virtue, the fruits wherof so glistered in the eies of mortall crea∣tures, that by his example they might both learne to feare God, to glory in sincerity, to abound in loyalty, & to become carefull louers of their natiue countrie. This euen this most worthy Knight passing his pilgrimage in this terrestriall vale of too manifold miseries, so behaued himself that for the exercise of perfect pietie, he was ho∣noured and highly esteemed of all men, to the poore he was mercifull, to the learned liberall, to Sutors a great comfort, to the fatherlesse fauourable, to the widdowes, helpfull, and to saye the truth, his hande, his heart, and purse, was alwayes ready to support the distressed, with goodmen he was delighted, and with them alwaies euer conuersaunt, and as he himselfe had scaled Pernassus and sat with Citheria amongst the Muses, so gloried he in wis∣dome

and the louers of the same with the peruerse, the frowarde and malicious suche as were contemners of truth enemies of her maiesties most royall person, and conspiring Catalins against their natiue countrie, who can saye that sweet Sidney was euer touched with one spot of disloyaltie: nay, who can not say, but that he carried in his secreat bosom a hart vndesiled, a cleare conscience, & a mind garnished with innocencie. But alasse this bright burning lamp is extinguished by death who hath robed the prince of as loyall a subiect as euer liued, disinherited the noble peeres of a faithful friend, and spoyled the cō∣mons of a carefull comforter, whose losse both Prince, peeres and subiects wofully bewaile. But is Sidney deade, no he liueth, his virtues in this life haue made a conquest of death, and in the world to come his faith hath obtai∣ned him the glorious presence of Iesus Christe in the kingdome of heauen. And to put you out of doubt, his tues so reuiue him from the graue, that he in truth speaketh vnto you, whose voyce if you will vouchsafe to heare, not only you (right honorable but all other noble estates, Gentlemen and others shall vnderstande that Sir Philip Sidney, to his euer induring glorye hath made a conquest of death by fame in this life, and is inthroni∣zed before God with his sacred saints in the kingdome of heauen. Thus crauing pardon at your Lordships hands for my ouerboldnes, the time commandeth me to cease, sith that the truth triumphantly approcheth to accom∣pany this worthy knight, whose plea, she most willinglie maintaineth. Thus with my harty praiers to the almigh∣ty for your Lordships health I conclude, beseeching him in this life to defend you from all perill and danger, yea moste happy victorye in this life ouer all the enemies of God and her royall maiesty, and in the worlde to come, crowne your head with honor and glory in his celestial kingdome.
