My LORD,
I Am very willing it should be known how great a share of the Guardian's Instru∣ction was Influenc'd by the Prospect of your good Lordship's Education; and also the just Regard these Second Thoughts have both to your Lordship, and
the Splendid Families of Sa∣resden, Barton, and Glymp∣ton.
I look'd on my self your Debtor in the Result of all my Experience and Observation, from the time when Sickliness made me Retire from Business, and that Retirement made Re∣flection the main use of my Being, and Notions of Educa∣tion so familiar as to become the very Property of my think∣ing Faculty.
This I intend for an Excuse to those Persons who are so kind as to think that I am able to deal with a greater Subject. They think Letters, Syllables, and Spelling be∣neath the venturous Pretensi∣on
of the Title-Page: They are beneath it indeed, but no otherwise than the Foundati∣on is beneath the Building, which, though it be low and unregarded, dirty and less Po∣lished, yet the least neglect and slightness in that is fatal to the Pomp and Pride of what looks higher.
Some are so kind as to wish that it were not so short; where∣as it seems I mistook when I thought that a Civility and Bribe to the Reader. There are those who know that a while since it was much larger; and why it is not so now, among several Reasons I will name but one: If I should have written all that I could have
said on the Subject, I am satis∣fied it would never have made a Fool a Wiser Man; and what wrong is it to the Tutor to pre∣sume him able to Improve and Practise upon a few plain ge∣neral Directions. I am not tempted to think the Directions I give the best and wisest in their kind: But to justifie my Choice, (whatever becomes of my Judgment) I must own that they are such as I would use my self in hopes of Success, as thinking them most plain and easie, and most agreeable to the Infancy of Thought; which ought mainly to be con∣sidered in the business of In∣stitution.
That the Knowlege I wish your Lordship, may more effe∣ctually serve this Life and a better, I pray God to Water with Dew from above the Seeds of Virtue and Religion in you: For Knowledge in a Person of great Quality without Grace and good Manners, is a sight rather Ominous than Delight∣ing; it is like the mighty Blazing Comet, the more Glo∣rious the more Terrible, and the Influence of the former on the Ruin of this Kingdom is much more certain than the Prediction of it from the lat∣ter can reasonably be pretend∣ed.
My Lord, I speak not this out of any distrust, I know the just Temperament of Authority and Affection, which cannot but turn to Account so sweet a Disposition: For though I will not stand by all the suppositions which have been made, yet I think it is safe to believe that God will not Deny Grace where Parents and Tutors do their Duty.
And now, (my Lord) the great Prejudice of a long Pre∣face to a Book which hath no∣thing in it to command a Reader's Favour, makes me short in mine own Defence, and conceal many things which the World would willingly know concerning your Illustrious An∣cestors,
and must depend upon the experienced Good-Nature of your Noble Family, to ac∣cept of a general Acknowledg∣ment how much I am,
