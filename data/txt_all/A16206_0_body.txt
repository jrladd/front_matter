RIght Noble Sir (for what letteth me to yelde you that title, sith your owne actions that I touch not herein your blood and Paren∣tage whereof you are descended, may challenge as your especiall and proper right, the same) in my wan∣dringes I found in an olde monument this written: I geue that, I haue not. Which Paradox or Riddle caused me to muse, with an earnest bent of my Imagination and iudge∣ment, to the search and resolution, of so intricate and diffi∣cult a positiō. Laboring a long time (as in a labarinth) in the diuersity of sentences lōg sithens taught, deliuered, and re∣ceiued, I called at length to minde the verse of Horrace.
Ego sum instar Cotis, acutum
Quae reddat ferrum, tamen expers ipsa secandi.
And so perswading my selfe that it was ment of a whet∣stone, I took shortly in hand to play the whetstone my selfe: whetting and setting on edge (by this my slender and simple deuise) the blunt mindes of my countrymen, who are made able if they vsed wisely and a right the be∣nefite

of Nature, to cut most deeply into those causes which concerne the honor of our Prince, security and safegarde of this commonwealth: most humbly praying you, who in my o∣pinion is able & sufficient to be both the whetstone and the sword, I meane both to doe your selfe, and to moue and per∣swade other to all worthy & laudable actions, to take the tuition of these my well meant labours and study. The curteous & fauourable acceptatiō wher∣of, shall binde me euermore to be at your becke, & happely stirr vp other of more knowledge and dee∣per iudgement to the attempt of some greater good.
