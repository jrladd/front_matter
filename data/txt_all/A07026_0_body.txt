RIght worshipfull, louing, and holie father and bi∣shop, when I do well con∣sider, & thinke vppon the noble, commendable, & woorthie deedes, which your honor (with the good helpe of the moste famous and deuoute Cardinall Grandvelle, and other good subiectes of the most holie Apostolicall Catholike Popish church of Rome,) haue (within these niene or ten yeares) taken in hande, and almost brought to passe, touching our ancient and wellnigh ouerthrowen Romish Religion, to proppe and vnder∣set the same with newe pillars, & strong styles▪ binding it with well twisted ropes, and cordes of the Spanish Inquisition: I must needes, and of right (in the name & behalfe of all my countriemen and inha∣bitants

of the base countries of Germa∣nie) geue you worthie thankes, for the great alterations and changes, whiche within these fewe yeares haue happened and chaunced to the proofe, within the said lowe countries. For, had not your Honor, about the yeare 1558. in the time of the most holie Pope Iulie the fourth, stoutlie and diligentlie trauelled and ob∣teined that these our base coūtries might be prouided for with newe Bishops, to serue for Inquisitours and accusers of he∣retikes and Huguenotes. Surelie, the case was such, that the Popes holines, with all his boothes and shoppes, must out of hande haue bene trudging out of these countries, and all by reason of this newe Gospell, which men woulde needes set forth: whereof your Bishops Myter, cro∣sier staffe, and your laudable Inquisition, haue not read much, (considering that your Honor can content your self with your Portesse, & a canne of good rennish wine) whereof if it had so come to passe, a most pitifull case must needes haue fol∣lowed: As especiallie, that a man shoulde scarse afterwardes haue founde anie one, that would haue saide Masse for monie:

yea, the Priestes themselues began to be so ashamed of their shauen crownes that in some places, they woulde haue beene glad to couer them with cowe doung, as in an olde prophesie is declared. The Bishops, the Prelates the holie Monkes and Chanons, the Inquisitoures and all idle officers of the spirituall courtes, shoulde not haue had anie more worke. I omit howe that the famous doctoures of Louen, the Licentiates and Bache∣lers of Diuinitie shoulde drinke no more Vinum Theologicum, or Vinum Cos,Vinum , the  that  do  lie.
Vinum Co,  is to  good colo smell, and . that is to say, of the persons fatte: but must haue taken patience with small ale and single beare, whereof they might sooe haue gotten the Collica passio. And where (I pray you) shoulde the foure holie beg∣ging orders haue become. And especial∣ly the deuout Franciscanes? should they not all (in generall) haue gone and han∣ged their cowles vpon the hedge? And then what should haue become of all the godlie ornamentes of the Churche, as braue altars, gylte christes, holie reliques, braue images, Copes of gold, siluer, and silke, and other moe suche like iewels, wherewith all the Churches and holie

Saints as well As well shee Saintes, as hee Saintes. Feminine, as Masculine, are decked vp and trimmed, which all the Byshops haue promised by solemne othe to mainteine and defend, to the vt∣termost of their powers. But what is all this to the purpose? The Masse, the Masse (I saie) yea, the holie blessed masse laie so extreemely sicke, that men began al∣readie to sing a Requiem ouer her, the holie Saintes, did not get anie more libe∣rall offrings, more sensinges, nor more pilgrimages. Yea, the people began al∣readie to pul downe images from the al∣ters. No man would geue any thing for pardons, nor for the Popes bulles: Yea, the hole staple of pardons, especially pur∣gatorie, beganne to waxe coulde. The Pope himselfe was esteemed for an how∣lieglasse: The Decrees, and Decretals, the Sophisticall gloses, the sentences, the Quotlibets, and suche like toyes of the schollers and doctours of Louen, were cast behinde the benche: Satisfaction, and ful recompence were no more made anie accounte of: Auriculer confession was almost murdered: Shroue tuesday, and Iacke a lent had almost broken their neckes: all the holie and goodlie Proces∣sions

with the stately stations, Perambu∣lations & going about the streetes, were esteemed for boyes plaie: the holie Sa∣crament was no more deuoutlie caried vp and downe with fiffes and drummes. In conclusion, all the holinesse, of the Catholike Church of Rome beganne to fall in the ashes: and in place thereof you should heare nothing else, neither in the townes nor without, yea, nothing was read but the Byble, or Saint Paule. The people would pray to none other, but to GOD alone, neither woulde haue anie other mediatour, but Christe Iesus, no put their trust and confidence in anie o∣ther thinges, but in his merites: No re∣ioycinges but in his Crosse, death, and passion. They did onely esteeme for Sa∣cramentes, Baptisme, & the Lords Sup∣per, yea, and did vse the same very simply without anie stately station or ceremoni∣all brauerie, without coniuringes of the diuell, without spittle, without salt, with∣out greasinges, & also without albes, sur∣pleses, or coapes, without singing of Per omnia saecula saeculorum, or Dominus vobis∣cum. They would go no more to shrifte vnde their ghostlie Father, but to God a∣boue

or else before the whole congrega∣tion: They did not passe anie more for absolution, they woulde not praie anie more for the sillie soules, whiche lie in Purgatorie, but euerie one would groūd his praier vpon the holie scripture: They woulde acknowledge but one supreme heade of the Churche, namely, Iesus Christe the Sonne of God: They woulde haue Bishops, renouncing the name & of∣fice of tyrannical Inquisitors, to preache the gospell, to leaue of their trapt Horses and Mules, and goe on foote: They did esteeme all manner of meates, good and lawfull, first saying grace in their mother tongues: neither did they much regarde the eating of fleshe in Lent, no, not euen on Good Friday: In Summe, they went wholy about to bring in a new reforma∣tion of religion and discipline ecclesiasti∣call, the like whereof was neuer seene of the holie Churche of Rome, nor of our forefathers: They tooke in hande to re∣store all againe, to the olde and former state of the Apostles and Euangelistes. what pitie, what care, what sorowe, had this bene to our dearly beloued mother the holie Catholike Churche of Rome,

and to all her good subiectes? But prai∣sed be our blessed Ladie of Antwerpe, your honour did well foresee, and in time diligently withstand that inconuenience, in that you haue placed the inquisition in the lande, driuen away the Gewses or He∣retikes, laide the Magistrates in prison,They were cal∣led Geses,  of , a∣gainst the Pa∣pistes. banished and brought to the Butchers stall the Gentlemen and good subiectes, made a way and open passage for the Spaniardes into the lande, set vp fire and swoorde in token of victorie, and in eue∣rie corner reared vp gallowes, and plen∣tifully shed the blood of those newe E∣uangelistes: In Summe, your diligence, your quicke expedition, your great zeale, your newe Bishoppes, and your holie In∣quisition, haue so well aduised, counsel∣led, perswaded (or rather forced) our So∣uereign Lord the king his Maiestie much rather to see the destruction of his Patri∣moniall lande, the ruine of his Subiectes: yea, the imprisonment, and death of his owne onelie sonne, then to permit the holie Catholike Church of Rome to suf∣fer suche shame: and that in place of the Popes decrees and decretals of the Masse booke Hortulus animae, and suche other

seruice bookes, the Gospel, & holy Scrip∣ture, onelie should succeed, & take posses∣sion. Therefore your Honour is highly to be praised for such noble actes: And eue∣rie man is duely bound herein, to assist & further you in your enterprise, to the vt∣termost of his knowledge & abilitie.
This (Right Honorable and blessed Bishop) is the cause, which hath moued me poore & vnworthie brother of Saint Frauncis order, to dedicate and sende this my simple present to your honour, to the ende that I (with this my small gifte of good will) may somewhat (though but a little) helpe to strengthen & repaire the decaied walles of the Romishe Church, and establish againe the right & perfect foundation of our most holie father, the Pope. Therefore hauing a while agoe: seene & marked that in the Citie of Ant∣werpe was a small booke sette foorth in French & Flemish, intituled & named A Letter Missiue: Or, An Epistle directed vnto the Apostates & Backsliders, from the true Christian beleefe, compiled and made by Maister Gentian Heruet, &c: And for that the same booke was greatly desired, and verie much esteemed of all good and Ca∣tholike

hearts: I haue (with all diligence and circumspection) perused and read o∣uer the same: wherein I haue founde in effect, that in the same is briefly declared and set foorth the whole grounde and foundation of the holie Romish religion, which your Honour, euen with fire and swoorde, to the subuersion and vtter ru∣ine of the whole land, doth seke most zea∣lously to mainteine. And I am thereby persuaded, that the same booke was most worthie to be read ouer of all men, to the ende that all startbackes from the faith, might returne into the right way: and the good faithfull Catholikes there∣by strengthened & confirmed. But nowe considering the saide booke to bee verie shorte, and something darke for a matter of suche importaunce, and like∣wise had either none or verie few proofes out of the Scriptures, Councels, holie Fa∣thers, and Decrees of the Popes: there∣fore I haue thought good to set penne to Paper, and to set foorth and declare the same at large, that nothing needefull should be lacking. Moreouer cōsidering that it is most necessarie, to declare some∣thing more at large, especially touching

the woorthines, and authoritie of the holie Churche of Rome, and the true ex∣position of the holie Scripture: wherevp∣pon the summe of all our matters doe depende, for that we haue alwayes beene forced to call vpon the Church, & especi∣ally now, when there is none other shield or defence left vnto vs: therefore haue I traueiled brieflie to shew of this matter, where the sure grounde and foundation lies, by what Scriptures, by what holie fa∣thers, by what Councels, & by how many Decrees euerie point is defended: and likewise howe and in what manner the Scripture and the holie Church of Rome are ioyned together, and Catholikelie vnderstoode in suche order, as the same shall in no wise serue the Heretikes anie thing at al to their purpose or aduantage. And forsomuch as this woorke is sucked out of sundrie sortes of flowres gathered together: therefore haue I named it, The Bee hiue of the Romishe Churche, thereby to geue to vnderstande▪ that as the honie Bee, doeth not gather her honie out of one flowre alone, but out of manie and diuerse: So doeth not the Churche of Rome stande vpon one Scripture, Byble,

Councels or bokes of Decrees, but doth catche and snatch out of eche of them, that which best serueth her purpose, as hereafter euerie man may plainelie per∣ceiue, and in the ende of this booke shall vnderstande more at large, whereas the speciall causes are set foorth, why and wherefore we haue christened this booke with such a name. And now, hauing vn∣derstoode that your Honour did a good while agoe set foorth a certaine booke, against the confessiō of the faith of these newe Gospellers, I did verie earnestly trauell to gette the same, trusting that it might (perhaps) haue eased me of this my labour, for that I thought your Ho∣nour shoulde haue set foorth these mat∣ters there at large. But after that I had superficially and lightly reade ouer the saide booke, (not hauing the lucke to kepe the same lōg by me.) I was the more willing to set foorth this my Bee hiue, for that I sawe it shoulde serue verie well, to the opening and more plaine declarati∣on of the foresaide booke, which your Honour hath made and published: con∣sidering that your honour is busie in e∣uerie place with the aucthoritie and dig∣nitie

of the holie Churche, of her ordi∣nances or constitutions, additions, or tra¦ditions, and of the spirituall exposition, which shee hath made vppon the Scrip∣tures: & perceiuing nothing to be clear∣ly set foorth, whereby one may finde out these constitutions and ordinances, whe∣ther in the Scripture, in the Fathers, in the Decrees, or in the Coūcels: so that a sim∣ple man might alway stande in doubt, what you will haue esteemed and holden for the commaundementes ordinances, or traditions of the Churche, and what men shall call the Churche, and likewise what rule or inuiolable order this holie Churche doth commonly keepe and vse in the exposition of the scriptures, but I thinke your Honour did leaue this vn∣done, as our saide Maister Gentian Har∣uet did, especially, because it was to small and slight a matter for you to trouble your mytered head with all. And there∣fore haue I gladlie taken vppon me this paine and trauell, and haue clearely sette forth in this my booke, vpō what ground and foundation all these thinges are buil∣ded: So that the necessarie vse of this booke is vnspeakeable as euerie good

Catholike shall well perceiue of him self. And forsomuch as herein is not written anie thing, but it doeth agree aswell, yea, better with the said booke made by you, thē with Gentians booke, I would gladly haue it set forth, as an Exposition, Glose, or Cōmentarie vpon your foresaid pret∣tie booke: but considering that I had not anie copie of your said booke in my cu∣stodie, and fearing also least your Honor might haue bene offended, that any man should take vppon him to expounde or comment vpon your writings, which are as cleare as hellishe sunne, euen as your owne name Sonnius doth signifie: so that I haue proceeded with my first determi∣nation, thinking it sufficient for me, if I might hide this my trauell vnder the winges of your Honor, like as vnder the same, all our newe Bishops haue beene hatched. Most humblie beseeching your Honor, to accept this my simple gifte in good parte, and as becommeth such a worthie Bishop to do, trusting yet (with∣in short time) to set foorth more such woorkes, and thereby so preciselie to expounde all the bookes that are set out

by your Honour, and other doctoures of Louen your companions, that a blinde man may feele them with his handes: yea, and without spectacles or candle, conceiue what greate holines lies hid in such coafers. You may (if it please you) in the meane space accept this my woorke, as an explanation and commentarie, vp∣on your booke, which to doe resteth at your pleasure and good will. And herein I commende your Byshopps Myter and crosyers staffe vnto the tuition of our holie Father the Pope, who preserue and keepe your Honour with all your bre∣thren our new Byshoppes, in prosperous estate and proceedinges against all He∣retikes.
Datum in our Musaeo, the v. of Ianuarie, being the euen of the three Kings of Collen, at which time all good Catholikes make merie, and crie, The King drinkes, in anno 1569.
