Right Honourable and Noble Senatours,
BY this time it is cleere day, even their eyes, whose unwillingnesse to beleeve it made them blinde, are now waken; to see that God did indeed put matter of thanksgiving both into our hands and mouthes: To disguise so solemne a duty onely to support reputation in the eyes of the world, is no lesse then to put an Irony upon GOD. Thanksgiving is the reply we make to GODS answer of our prayer, of whom if we walke worthy, he will
 surely make rejoynder of new mercies. Though we cannot expect but that we may shift our garments and somtimes weare sack∣cloth. The Lord set our hearts in tune, whe∣ther to Lachrymae or Hallelujah; Beware of that rock which the Israelites fel foul upon in their wildernesse condition, where be∣ing at Gods more immediate finding, and ha∣ving all their entertainment from Heaven, they most of all did then imbitter GOD by their murmurings against and temptations of him; The good Lord command the West to blow as sweet a gale as the North hath done, and so finish his own worke, that unto Hen∣ricus Rosas, Regna Jacobus, may be ad∣ded, Ecclesias Carolus; So prayeth,
