Sir,
THis Dedication is not to acquaint the World either with your firme adhesion to the Church of England, or your utter abhor∣rence, and detestation of Sects; for those are suffici∣ently knowne: nor to pro∣voke
 you to a greater seve∣rity against Sectaries, for that is contrary to my maine de∣signe, which is, by Gods bles∣sing, so to rectifie their judge∣ments, and reduce them to such a measure of Confor∣mity, that no rigour of Law can reach them: nor to con∣tribute the least Glory to your Name, whereto no Ad∣dition can be affixed by the meane endeavours of so and ob∣scure a person; but indeed (which expression has so little of Courtship, that it cannot probably passe for a Comple∣ment) to please my selfe, who am not more ambitious
 of any worldly honour, than to be justly accounted grate∣full to those Persons, who have merited of me beyond all possibility of compensa∣tion: In the Catalogue of whom, not to place You, and many others, (some dead, some alive) of that Loyall Family, whereof you are chiefe, would be a crime in∣expiable in the Judgement of all those that have known you, and their continued (not to say continuall) bene∣factions to, Sir,
