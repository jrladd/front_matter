TO thee true friende and fauourer of learning,
The foster-father of my meane desarts:
Great Palmerin perfected, now imparts
His worth and mine, to passe by thy discerning.
Spayne, Italie and Fraunce, haue entertainde him,
And made theyr greatest Peeres to write his praises:
But now his natiue Countries loue him raises,
And that high zeale hath home to England wainde him.
Long trauaile rest him of his language quite,
Therefore he is constrainde to speake by me:
This then he saies: He onely comes to thee,
To entercourse some matter of delight,
Whereof his History affoordeth store:
Then bid him welcome, and he craues no more.

Finis.
