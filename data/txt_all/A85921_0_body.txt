Right Honourable,
AS I have presented both to the Right ho∣nourable Speaker Lenthall, and to the Lord President of the Councell of State, the printed Lectures which have been read gratis on Cosmography, in the Academy which I have endeavoured to Erect, for the glory of God, the honour of this Nation, the generall encouragement and improvement of all Lovers of Vertue. In the same way of humble respect and duty. I doe also
offer to your hands this Lecture touching Navigati∣on; as most fit and pertinent, for that your hands and cares are fixt on this grand Vessell England; as your right pious, religious minde, is on him whose won∣ders you have most fully seen in the Deepe.
May those great and Indefatigable Indevours be so prosperous and so blest by that great Pilot, Guider, and preservator of all things, as that the Government wherein so many Legions are comprehended, may be so well guided (even in the greatest stormes) from pe∣rishing, and live to praise his great and glorious Name, which will ever be the prayers of him that by all acceptable services will indevour to approve himselfe
Right Honourable, 
White Fryers, this 28 of Novemb. 1649.
