MOst cleanely and profest Antagonist to vermine, dirt, and filth, 
Dragmatus the Diagotian Stigmatist very worthily wrot in hi
Treatise of the Antiquitie of Shapparoones and carelesse Band
Rushtoy ton tumeron smolensco whish wherlibumque. Which is in Eng∣lish,
That to conserue and keepe cleane, is as much or more then
to make cleane: and I know by long experience that your paines and industry
not onely makes our polluted Linnen cleane, but also to conserue and preserue 
in that neatnesse and purity as is correspondent for our health and wholesome∣nesse:
vpon these gratefull confiderations. I haue presumed to consecrate these
vnpolish'd lines to your vnspotted Cleanlinesse) not doubting but the lathering
suds of vour lennitie, will wash away all such faults as are not herein committe
through want of ignorance; and with the white Starch of your firme constancy,
you will stiffen the weakenesse of my feeble and limber, labours, that it may be
able to stand like a stout, Mastiffe Dogge, against the opposition of all detracting
Nungerels; I haue in this ensuing volume, set forth the praise and commenda∣tions
of Cleane Linnen, with the honourable paines of the Laundresse; which
word Laundres I finde to be both vnfitting and derogatory to your comly, com∣mendable,
laudable, neate, sweet and seemely calling; for the Anagram of Laun∣dre.
SLAVVNDER, which name or Epithite is halfe a slawnder to your suri∣
for to be a Laundres, imports onely to wash or dresse Lawne, which is as
 impeachment as to cal a lustice of the Peace, a Beadle; a Dyer, a Scaldragge; or
nger, a seller of Gubbins. No, my most laborious and purifying Patro∣
your glory shall no longer be Ecclipsed, to be termed a bare Lawndres, or a
 of Lawne, but a Hollandresse, Tiffanie-dresse, Lawndresse, Lockrumdresse,
wlesdresse, Callicute and Canuas-dresse, which in the totall is a Linnendresse,
 you are the onely Linnen Armouresse, Cap a pea from the declination of the
 to the exaltation of the Nightcap, and from the loftie Quoyse, to the lowly
eloued Smockeskirt; and herein I am strucke into admiration, at the vn∣ alour, that champion-like doth accompany and constantly defend
our chatitie; For you dare in a morning to enter a Gentlemans chamber, to
ppe him out of his foule shirt in his bed, to haue him at your bare and naked
 and then like a vertuous victor, in pittie and commiseration, you put a
 shirt on his backe, leauing him in a clearer and farre sweeter case then you
ound him; no doubt but such obiects are prouocatory temptations to fraile
 and bloud: but as I said before, your courage and constancie alwaies brings
 fairely off and on, though thousands weaker vessels of alitie would bee
'd in these vnbloudie bickerings. As for your good Husband, who is Legge
 name, my poore Muse makes a legge in courtesie to him and you both. Some
 Coxcombes in Wit and iudgement will terme him a Cobler, whilest
ood mannors entitles him a Translator. When I thinke vpon the simpathie and
 pondancie of both your qualities, I approue Fortune for a wise cunning
woman in clapping such a coniuriction together; for he is a mender, and you
 a mundifier or to speake truth, you are both menders, and God knowes how
any will be hanged before they will mend: your Ar is to keepe our bodies
weet and cleane, and his Trade is to set our wicked and crooked soales right and
right; hee is a firme and stableman, and waxeth much oftner then hee wanes;
 workers sildome aboue the legge, which shewes the true loue that he beares
his Name and  Legges are of much more antiquity then Linnen, in
gard whereof  being of the younger  doth good seruice many
 betweene the Legges and you and your husband may by name and na∣re,
very Poely make an Herameter; Legges are the supporters and por∣
that vphold and carry man, fowle, and beast. A good Legge is a great grace
 disy ess in the e, and not too much spindled in the small,
my noble Translator knowes that a Boot is an armour for a good Legge, and
 or  for a bad; to which acknowledgement many a Gentleman V∣
will say Probatumest: of all parts of the Body the Legge beares the pricke
  It is embrodred with Veines, inlaid with Arteries, enchased with

Nerues, interlac'd with Muscles, ennamel'd with Sinewes, interwouen with
Membranes, intermixt with Tenons, embost with Ankles, hauing a Neat Fo
for a man, and fiue Toes for Pages to attend it. More for the honour of Legges 
what is better meat then the Legges of Beife, Mutton, Lambe, Porke, Capon 
Turkey, Goose or Woodcocke? Nay, there is such vertue in them, that any rea∣sonable
Cooke with a Stooles Legge (and something else) will make good broth
To finish my prolixious short, briefe, and tedious dedication, I wish that yo
and your Husband in coniugall combination, in the way of Procreation, ma
multiply and make Legges, which is a part of good Manners and Courtesie
whereof these vnmannerly times is almost barren. Thus referring my selfe and
my labours to bee accepted and censured according to the purity and integ
of both your reforming functions, with my prayers for the cleane amendmen
of all foulers of Linnen, and the reforming of all bad Legges, for the better sup∣portation
of Washers, Starchers and Translator: I remaine,
He whose sinfull shirt lyes humbly at the mercy of your washing Bowl
