MY LORD,
IT is to Your Lordship, that we of the Clergy within your Diocess, are immediately (under his Majesty) accountable for our Doctrine and Be∣haviour; in which, if any of us are known to offend, it becomes such as know it, and are aggrieved, to complain to you, as our Ordinary, for the Reformation and redres∣sing of it. But it is of late grown too much a practice amongst some, that would be thought not a little concerned for our Church, to be the first that censure us, and without Examination of the Case, or enqui∣ring into the Truth and Certainty of what they report, make the wide World the Judg, and proclaim our Faults, whatever they are, or are said to be, in the chief Pla∣ces of Concourse; and which your Lord∣ship

(and perhaps the Party himself) knows nothing of, till every body knows it, and common Fame brings it to your Ears.
My Lord, it has happened thus with me, as with others (who am not the first, nor it's likely shall be the last that is to be thus served.) For having Preached July 26. the Day appointed by his Majesty for a Publick Thanksgiving for the late Victory over the Rebels, there want not some who have reported that I only entertained my Auditory with a General Discourse that was not to the purpose of the Day and Occasion. A Calumny I for a while slight∣ed, and contented my self to give my Friend satisfaction, that first acquainted me with it: But when, from a deep Design in some to asperse the Clergy of the City, from a Credulity in others to believe ill of them, and from the humour of an Age (from what reason it proceeds, God knows) given to believe a Lye, it came to be a publick Talk: It became me, if I had no regard to my own Reputation, yet from the regard I ought to have to our Clergy

(which too much suffers by such aspersions) and to your Lordship (under whose Cog∣nizance it falls) to take the most effectual course for the refuting of it, by publishing my Sermon, how defective soever it may otherwise be. This therefore I do, without adding any new matter, saving what may serve to render it the more intelligible, useful, and entire (which is therefore di∣stinguished from the other, and set forth by marks) and without making any Alte∣ration, so much as in the Words relating to the Day, forbearing even those Things that I said more of it, as they then offered themselves to my thoughts, because I can∣not now exactly recollect it, though I am sensible it would have been not a little to the Advantage of it.
I must acknowledg, there is not that bit∣terness and severity, with which some eager spirits are gratified; having learned from the behaviour of St. Michael, not to bring even against an Adversary a railing accusa∣tion: But if I mistake not, the Doctrine I teach, doth overthrow the main Principle by which Rebellion is supported; a way

indeed that may not make so much noise, but if prudently and effectually managed, strikes it to the Heart; and differs as much from the former, as fighting and vanquish∣ing an Enemy doth from railing at him. And therefore, tho I am not able to answer for the order and dress of it (which had the Printing been a mere voluntary act of mine, I should be obliged to) yet for the Truth and Loyalty, I may safely challenge those that have adventured either spight∣fully or ignorantly to revile it, the worst of mine or our Churches Adversaries, to que∣stion it. In Confidence of which, I do pre∣sent it to your Lordship, and desire to stand or fall, as your Lordship shall judg of it: Who as in this, so upon all other occasions, shall approve my self,
