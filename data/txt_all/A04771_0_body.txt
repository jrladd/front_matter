WORTHY SIR,
THE frequent Custome of this Age to chal∣lenge Patrons, and to trouble their braines with bestowing vpon those Patrons Mountebanke Encomi∣ms, hath no whit at all taken vp my minde, since no folly can be greedie thereof, but shall purchase wit e∣nough for that purpose.
Suffice, it is my true knowledge of
you, and my truer loue vnto you, which makes me send this poore In∣fant of my braine, and slender Col∣lections to kisse your hand: which in as much as the root or centre is Ver∣tue, the circumference that happy lift or bound, out of which no good man will willingly stray, and in which I know the goodnesse of your inclina∣tion makes your delight to liue: o whom can I better bestow it, both in respect of the thing, which onely loo∣keth vpon Vertue, and in respect of your selfe, who is not onely a louer, but a supporter of the vertuous? So that to conclude, if your acceptance shall say I haue done well, I will be∣leue, all which are good (like you) will agree with me: who doth the contrary, I will laugh at, for he loues not Goodnesse.
