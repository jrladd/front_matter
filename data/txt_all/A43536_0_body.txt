Most Illustrious Sir,
I Doubt not your Clo∣set
already abounds▪
and is daily reple∣nished,
with volumes of

English History, as those
Mirrours, in whose Refle∣ctions
your Royall Ance∣stors,
you may best disco∣ver
Theirs, and direct your
owne Actions.
I therefore humbly ad∣dresse
this piece to your Highnesse, not as a Booke,
but as an Index, which can∣not
offer the Pompe of a
Volume▪ yet may yeeld the
profit of a Manuall.
The work is Posthumus,
bereav'd both of the Au∣thor
and protection; and
had it not desired to live
under the Patronage of so

clement a Prince, was wil∣ling
to dye in the Cradle,
rather then be expos'd to
theadventures of a distem∣pered
Age.
I referre its merits to the
judgement of the Publique
(to whose use it affords it
selfe,) but humbly begges,
that being an Orphan, its
Fatherlesse condition may
finde succour and counte∣nance
from the splendour
of your goodnesse, under
which it hath beene first
brought orth into the
world.
Vouchsafe  therefore

(Great Prince) to cast a
gracious Eye on this deser∣tedObject,
and the poore
Oblation of
