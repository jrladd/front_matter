THe Mome- free Passage, that my Muse hath found
Vnder Safe-Conduct of thy Patronage,
Through carping Censures of this curious Age
(Where high conceited happy wits abound)
Makes her presume (O Mountioy, most renownd!)
To bear again, in her re-Pilgrimage,
The noble Pasport of thy Tutelage,
To salue her still from sullen Enuies wound.
Let thy (true-Eagle) Sun-beholding Eyes
Glance on our Glowe-worm's scarce discerned spark:
And while Witt's towring Falcons touch the skies,
Obserue a while our tender-imped Lark.
Such sparks may flame, & such light Larks may flie
A higher pitch, than drosse-full Vanity.
