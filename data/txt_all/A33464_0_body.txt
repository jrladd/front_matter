DEARE Catholique Brethren who by Gods order and dis∣position are to gayne your livelyhood by honest labour and industry; to you principally is this short method of devotion addressed: for although they whome the Divine Providence has placed in a heigher condi∣tion in this world, are more plentifully furmisht with bookes and other helpes for their instruc∣ction; yet the goodenesse of God
is so great, as to accept your faithfull endevors according, to your capacity; and so as you love and serve him Religiously in your severall vocations here upon earth, your reward will be equall with theirs in Heaven. Gre∣at are the prerogatives of the poore: who was poorer then La∣zarus, who lay at the gate of the rich Glutton full of sores and ulcers, suffering hungar, cold, and all kind of necessity? Yet his patience and conformity to the Divine will in those his afflictions, obtaynd him the glory to be canoniz'd by Iesus-Christ himselfe, while the same presumptuous rich Man, clad in purple garments, and glori∣ing in his abundant wealth, and temporall felicity, was cast downe into those horrid flames,
where he shall never cease to be tormented.
Whoever will enter in at Hea∣ven gate must stoope very low: the greatest Princes if they pre∣tend to Eternall riches, must become like you, poore upon Earth, at least in affection: Blessed are the poore of spirit, for theirs is the kingdome of Heaven: Yea the richest Empe∣rors Carry no more with them out of the world then the poorest begger. When S. Iohn Baptist sent his Disciples to our Blessed Lord to informe themselves, whither he were the Messias, or no; one of the markes he gave them wherby to proove himselfe to be truly soe, was, that the poore receiu'd the Ghospell, which shewed that his Divine goodnesse had the poore in recommendatiō.

 Since then by these passages and many more which are found amongst the sacred oracles of our Divine Maister; Yea sin∣ce by his owne life and exam∣ple we are taught how gratefull the poore are to him, and with what difficulty the rich enter into the kingdome of Heaven; you who are poore ought to com∣fort your selves in your poverty, and rest assured, that if God had foreseene that riches would have more conduc'd to your sal∣vation, he would have given you abundance, since it was as easy to his infinit power to have made you the richest Princes, as the poorest artisans. Blesse then Gods goodnesse in your poverty, love him fervently, serve him faith∣fully; beleeve that his designe in makeing you poore, was to
render your salvation more easy, since those who have great pos∣sessions, like the young man in the Gospell forsake them with as great anxiety. Farewel and in your prayers remember.
