RIght honorable, since amōgst the rudest Crea∣tures (euen the brute beasts deuoide of Rea∣son) Ingratitude, that foule Monster, is not once to be found: how hatefull then the very remembrance thereof ought to be vnto humane Creatures; but especially to those that professe Christianitie (in whome it hath pleased the so∣uereigne Creator of all things, to make his chiefe Storehouse of all Reason in these Terrestiall parts) so much as to purpose, much more in action
to proue ingratefull to any; but chiefely to those from whom especiall fauours haue proceeded: who is it that will not absolutely censure? Wherefore (my honorable good Lord) because I would not seeme more then brute, although J acknowledge my abilitie cannot extend vnto the moytie of my desire: yet like the poore man, who (wanting better wherewith to expresse his loyall affection) presen∣ted the mightie Prince Alexander the great, with a cup of coole water: so offer I this small (and therefore vnworthy) present, vnto your hono∣rable acceptance: my bounden duety euer chal∣lenging greater, doth neuerthelesse encourage me to beginne with this little. Humbly praying your Lordship to shroud these my first fruits vnder the wings of your honorable patronage, against the enuious stormes of Zoilus, and his Crittick associates; who are alwayes more ready to carpe and find fault with others, then any way able to doe the like themselues. Herein promising to my selfe that the more learned in the Mathema∣ticks, (who I confesse had bene much fitter to haue handled this subiect then my selfe) and those that desire the benefite of knowledge in the common
wealth (for which, I protest, I chiefely vnder∣tooke this work, in regard that scant any thing herein contained; is yet extant in our vulgar tongue) will if not imbrace, yet at the least not vt∣terly reiect and contemne this my trauaile. The acceptance of the more learned and better sort I assume to my selfe, hauing euer noted such to fauor the desire of good studies: And of those that loue the common good I much presume, iudging them by my selfe; hauing euer borne especiall affection to such, as haue shewed their willing endeauours to profit the publique weale with their best meanes. And so praying almighty God to blesse your Lord∣ship and my good Lady your honorable Coun∣tesse, with long life, and all happie encrease of honour and prosperity in this world, and in the world to come eternall fe∣licity, I rest alwayes
