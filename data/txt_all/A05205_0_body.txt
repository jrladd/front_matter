IT is not vnknowne vnto your worships, and to vs all round about, what great and manifold dangers haue o∣uerspread all our countrie, by the space of these two last yeares

and more, as well by dearth, as also by strange & fearefull dis∣eases, and sicknesses. It is no lesse knowne vnto vs also, how little good, and small reliefe, all out∣ward meanes of remedie and comfort brought vnto the di∣stressed ones in their extremi∣ties, and who knoweth not how lamentable and wofull was the state of the afflicted one, (espe∣cially in such places as were in∣fected with the pestilence) and what feare came vpon vs all thorough that their affliction; what mourning amongst them, and daily deuises amongst our selues, how to auoide & escape dangers? I wish from my heart, that the originall breeding, and

first occasion of these lamenta∣ble times, were as well knowne, or herafter may be knowne of vs all, viz. how that it was not infection of the ayre, distempe∣rature in their bodies, much lesse the malitious and diuelish practises of witches, or yet blinde fortune, or any other such like imagined causes, which were breeders of these euils. But the masse and multitude of our sins, in rebelling against the ho∣lie one of Jsrael, these (I say) haue been the prouokers of the Almightie, to make vs drinke of the cup of afflictions, these haue pulled vpon vs al these plagues, and brought vpon vs all these fearefull and afflicted times,

wherein we haue lately been: which poynt, that it might ap∣peare plaine to the sight & view of all my neighbours (whose hearts haue awaked at the be∣holding of the said calamities) I haue laboured in this little trea∣tise following, to make knowne, what hath caused all these woes, and who hath wrought and brought vnto vs better dayes, as also what dutie we owe to the Lord, for our gracious and long desired deliuerance. Which I am bold to dedicate vnto your Worships, and that for two re∣spects: first, for that I perswade my selfe, that you are both fa∣uourable, and also forward to entertaine, and bid welcome all

that bring the glad tidings of saluation: whereby I am resol∣ued that you will not only your selues accept and take in good part, these my poore labours, but also patronize, countenāce, and defend thē against al those, who shall deride and scoffe at them, as they doe at all good things, in my self or others, and secondly, for that you be Magi∣strates, and Iustices within those limits and precincts, most parts whereof haue bin infected most pitifully, and (I am perswaded) most iustly, for those great and capitall sinnes, which rule and raigne amongst vs: as grosse Poperie, and blinde superstition in very many places, in so much,













that I am afraide, that that ab∣hominable Idoll of indignati∣on the Masse is vsed in diuerse places about vs, and that ve∣ry boldly: adde hereunto, fil∣thy drunkennesse, abhominable whoredomes, open profanation of the Sabbath, vnlawfull pa∣stimes, with infinite many moe, which the further they bee rip∣ped into, the more filthy stinch ariseth out of them. These and such like sinnes (I say) being so pregnant and rise amongst vs: I doubt not, but as you espied them, and heard them cryed a∣gainst by worde and writing, you with the rest of your asso∣ciats ioyning with you, will holde on in zeale of Gods glo∣ry,

the peace of Gods children, and the discharge of your owne dueties, that these sinnes may haue those lawes executed vp∣on them, which most christianly is prouided in this land, for re∣straining them: which (no doubt) shall so greatly tend to the glorie of God, the furthe∣ring of the couse of the Gos∣pell, and the flourishing e∣state of our christian common∣wealth that in short space, the excellent effects of this zealous gouernement, shall proue the trueth and vprightnes thereof. And thus briefely I cease: com∣mitting this little worke, and the issue thereof, for acceptance at your Worships hands, and

all other that shall reade it, to the wisedome of him, who hath the disposing of the hearts, e∣uen of Kings and rulers, euen one God, and three persons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Spirit, to whome be glorie, ma∣iestie, dominion and praise for euermore.
