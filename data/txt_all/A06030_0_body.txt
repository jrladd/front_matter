THis TREATISE falling into my hands by Gods wise and graci∣ous dispensation, and proui∣dence, and being thought, not onely by my selfe but by diuers others of riper yeares and deeper iudgement, wor∣thy to be published in print for the common good of many. I haue thought good considering that the long
 continued custome of dedi∣cating bookes to Persons of some eminencie in the Church of God, hath gotten the vpper hand to dedicate this little Treatise ensuing to your Ladiships name.
I haue obserued that a∣mong many other reasons mouing such learned and godly Diuines as haue either wouen some webbe of their owne spinning, or faithfully trauelled in the fruitfull la∣bours of other men to De∣dicate their writings: one speciall reason hath beene to testifie their thankefulnesse to the parties to whom they dedicate the same, by pub∣lishing their Name both to the present age, and to po∣steritie for the further en∣couraging, both of them∣selues,
 and others to pro∣ceed in piety and vertue; and especially in patroniz¦ing learning and godlinesse when they shall see that such a reward remaineth for them euen in this present world.
But herein I must be very sparing, considering that the neerenesse of bloud betwixt your Ladiship and my selfe, will hardly suffer mee to say the one halfe of that which I might truely say, both of your Ladiships vertues in generall, and of your speci∣all and manifold fauours to∣wards me: for which I will rather praise GOD, and pray for the continuance and increase thereof in the secret closet of my heart then make any publike pro∣clamation
 of the same in the eares of men.
Thus praying your Ladi∣shippe to accept in part of paiment, for your many fa∣uours and kindnesses, this small mite, which I bring you in another mans coine, with my humble and hearty prayers. &c.
