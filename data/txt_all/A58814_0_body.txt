MADAM,
WHen you requested me to Publish this Discourse, I found you in that Mournfull condition, that 'twould have been a degree of Inhumanity not to have gratified your desire: And therefore, though I was suf∣ficiently sensible how much short I had fain of both my Subjects, viz. that comfortable one of the Text, and that sorrowfull one of the Occasion; yet my Compassion over∣swayed my Reason, so that I can plead no other excuse to the World for this very defective Publication, but that I had not ill nature enough to resist the Importunate Tears of an afflicted Friend, and a sorrowful Widow.
As for the Sermon, all I can say for it is this, That it Treats of a very Noble Argument, and such as car∣ries comfort enough with it to ease and relieve the most dejected mind, and therefore is of all others the most fit and proper for your Meditations; for there is no present af∣fliction, no, not yours, can cause you to suppose your self mi∣serable, so long as you are within hope and expectance of the blessed state of eternal life.
O, Good Madam, while you are making your Mournfull descants on your dear Loss, consider now and then, that

you are Iourneying towards that blessed place, where you will find infinite Myriads of better Friends, and dearer Lovers, than that best of Husbands, whose Loss you be∣wail, and who love each other far more and better even than you and he did▪ and have this peculiar advantage beyond the happiest Lovers here, That they shall live an eternal life together, and to everlasting Ages enjoy one another, without being ever interrupted in their enjoy∣ment, with the Melancholy prospect of being at last di∣vided from each others society and embraces. This, with all those other innumerable comforts wherewith this fruitfull Theme abounds, you will find the best Cordial in the World for a drooping mind.
That therefore what I here present you may often put you in mind of Heaven, and quicken your endeavours af∣ter it, and refresh your sorrowfull heart with the joyfull prospect of it, is the earnest prayer of,
