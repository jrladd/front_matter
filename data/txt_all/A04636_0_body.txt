Madame,
IN the Age of Sacrifices, the truth of Religion was not in the greatnes, and fat of the Offrings, but in the deuotion, and zeale of the Sacrificers: Else, what could a handful of Gummes haue done in the sight of a Hecatombe? Or how, yet, might a gratefull minde be furnish'd against the iniquitie of Fortune; except, when she fail'd it, it had power to im∣part it selfe? A way found out, to ouer∣come euen those, whom Fortune hath enabled to returne most, since they, yet leaue themseluesmore. In this assurance am I planted; and stand with those af∣fections

at this Altar, as shall no more auoide the light and witnesse, then they doe the conscience of your vertue. If what offer beare an acceptable odour, & hold the first strength: It is your va∣lew, thatremembers, where, when, and to whom it was kindled. Otherwise, in these times, there comes rarely forth that thing, so full of authoritie, o example, but by daylinesse and custome, growes lesse, and looses. But this, safe in your iudgement (which is a SIDNEYS) is for∣bidden to speake more; least it talke, or looke like one of the ambitious Faces of the time: who, the more they paint, are the lesse themselues.
