Gentlemen, and much respected Friends,
I Have endeavoured in this Manual to avoid Prolixi∣ty, and to omit no Remarkables, as far as my designed brevity would admit; intending rather a Com∣pendium of the whole Art and Mystery of Trade and Traffick, than a Voluminous Treatise, which would have been too large for a Pocket Companion.
What lay scattered in divers Volumes, are reduced (in a method wholly new) under their proper Heads, briefly, yet (I hope) not obscurely. I have intermixt many new things, which fell within my own observation
(or my Friends) respecting Trade and Commerce, some of which were never to my knowledg I am sure, ne∣ver in this Method) Published. It is said, That
Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit utile Dulci:
If that be not done here, yet it is an Essay of that kind, being a mixture, wherein with great variety things high∣ly and daily useful for all manner of Traders, are inter∣woven with delightful observations. And if there be any mistakes or imperfections, which all Men are liable to, upon any Information (which shall be thankfully resen∣ted) it may be capable of rectifying hereafter.
Gentlemen,
In Erecting such a troublesome and various Edifice, the Spectator, at first view, will hardly conceive how much pains was bestowed in digging the Foundation, in raising Scaffolds, in finding, conveighing, and fitting Materials, in contriving the Architecture, in removing the Rubbish, &c. Other Builders, consult only their own Brains, and the Dead; (that is, Books) whereunto access may be had at all Hours: But in this Work, the Living, and the choicest among them, where to be advised with; whereof some were far distant, others seldom at leisure; some unwilling to Communicate their Knowledge, others not at all affable.
However, If the Reader, reaping in few Minutes, the Fruits of many Hours Labour, shall receive any Content, I shall not only be satisfied for this, but encou∣raged for another like Enterprize.
