Worthy SENATORS,
THE Vicissitude of Gods Providence to men in great place, somtimes pul∣ling down those who are lifted up on high, and a∣gain raising up those who were laid pro∣strate,
may justly provoke all Magistrates to walk with fear and trembling; know∣ing, there is a greater then they are. All earthly Potentates and Principali∣ties are, before God, but as so much pin∣dust, which, when hee breatheth on, is soon scattered away. Hence, Psalm 2. the great Ones of the earth are exhorted to kisse the Sonne, lest hee be angry; and a little of his anger is too heavie for the shoulders of any mortall men. Be af∣fected therefore with your own nothing∣nesse, comparatively to Gods greatnesse, and advance his Truth, Worship, and Go∣vernment. Many States have stumbled upon Christ, as a Stone of offence; and hee again hath fallen upon them, grin∣ding them to powder. The Lord make you so blessed, that you may not be offen∣ded at any thing which is Christs; and
fill you so with faith, that you may be fully perswaded in your hearts, that the surest posture of defence for the King∣dome, is, when it is put into a submission unto the Scepter of Christ Jesus. Al∣though God hath done much for you, yet great is the need you still have of his Goodnesse, Wisdome, and power to you. The shippe coming into the harbour may miscarry, as well as that in the wide O∣cean: And, certainly, the businesses of your Warre and Peace, of the Church and State, of Divisions and Reconcilia∣tions, are of so great concernment, that hee seeth nothing at all, who doth not judge you in as great a necessity of Gods good Providence, as at the very first. Therefore, after all the great successe which God hath vouchsafed unto you, be not high-minded, but fear: keep a sure
interest in God, and provoke him not by any sinnes; but so manage all things belonging to God and men, with piety and justice, that God from heaven may prosper you, and men on earth praise you.
