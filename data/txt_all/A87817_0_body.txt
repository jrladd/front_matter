HONOVRABLE,
IT may be judged an act of great boldnesse in me, who am under the Examination of this Honourable Committee, to dedicate my poor labours at Debenham and Stradbrook, to your patronage; espe∣cially to publish them to the world: Had not the hard reports of some persons (too much credited by many) constrained me to vindicate first the truth, and in the next place to give some satisfaction to many, who have heard those reports, I should not have been so bold; the conscious∣nesse of mine own inability, and the knowledge of the profitable labours of many both learned and godly, hath to this time, and still had justly hindred me from publishing any thing by print to the view of the World: Wherefore I (being thus inforced to print my Sermons) pre∣sent them to your Honours; wherein you have the summe and sub∣stance of all that I preached in Suffolk (as many witnesses can testifie.) For my main endeavours there was, to exalt Christ, and to presse my Hearers to Sanctification in heart and life. And if the Lord shall please to make my poor labours a blessing to any, he will get glory, and I have my reward with him. Howsoever, I humbly submit both my self and my Book, to the Examination and determination of this Ho∣nourable Committee.
