Right Honourable,
THere is nothing in the follow∣ing Sermon, that could recom∣mend it to your Lordships favour∣able
Acceptance, besides its plain∣ness and the honesty of its design: nor could any other Consideration have prevailed with me to expose it to the View and Censure of this pee∣vish Age, but only fear of seeming to contradict the Doctrine I taught, Of strict Obedience to the Com∣mand of Superiours.
