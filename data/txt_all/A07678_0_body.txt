I Know (Sir) that I shall be censu∣red very rash, in attempting; more vnad∣uised, in publishing; and most improuident, in ma∣king your selfe the Patron of so weak a Pamphlet; for the first, I may excuse me,



in that I haue bin long vn∣willingly idle, and loath to lose the benefit of the infor∣ced intermission of mine accustomed former imploy∣ments, I could conceiue no fitter or better passe-time, then in this interim, to seek some inward consolation, in my outward discomforts: for the Second, I acknow∣ledge, that imparting these weake Meditations, vnto some seeming wel affected to the best things, I was incouraged to lay them down to the pleasure of the Printer; who, not without



examination & allowance hath brought the same to publike view. And as tou∣ching the Third and last, in making choyce of your name among so many of that Honourable Socie∣tie, whom I most humbly and sincerely honour and reuerence; I cannot but ac∣knowledge the reason, to be no other then that I haue bene longest knowen vnto your selfe; And you best know, how I haue past ma∣ny yeares in Seruice and attendance, commanded by that Honorable Table.

These, no fained excuses may, in honourable fauour, free me from the censure of rashnesse in attempting it, of presumption in publish∣ing it, and of neglect, or respect of persons in patro∣nizing it: So shall I think mine idle time not altoge∣ther lost, though gaining little outward profit, whe∣ther happy or vnhappy, in gaining the one, or loosing by the other. I am so much the more doubtful to iudg, by how much I obserue, that men are heere censu∣red happy & vnhappy (not



in respect of inward or out∣ward qualities, bee they good or bad) but according to their present prosperitie or aduersity, glory or base∣nesse, riches or pouertie, which as a sea often ebbes and flowes; As variable winds blow, and waues tos∣sed, are lifted vp, and come low: wherein some sayling with a full gale of glory, thinke themselues in high∣est felicity, who yet forget∣ting or neglecting to steere aright the huge bulke of their conceiued happinesse, rush many times vpon the



rocke of Disgrace, more grieuous then their former fortunes were glorious. He that seeketh and thinketh to finde true felicitie in the inconstant things of this life, is as happy a man as hee that dreameth that hee hath sound great store of golde, and seemeth to re∣ioyce beyond measure in his good fortune; and when hee awakes, hee findes it a dreame: So may men dreame of happinesse here; but it is onely reserued for such as make least account of this worlds glory, who



haue their conuersations in Heauen while they liue in the earth, where yet no man can iudge of a truely happy man.
