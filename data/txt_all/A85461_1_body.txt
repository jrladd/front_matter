Deare and loving friends,
YOur carriage towards me, or rather to∣wards the truth of God, was such, when I was for a short time among you, that it is a sufficient engagement to bind me over for ever to be yours. Doe not thinke, that my not writing unto you, being at such a distance, is any abatement of my love and re∣spect: No, it hath rather kindled my heart, and fil∣led it with employments otherwise towards you, which hath not ceased continually to passe over the great Ocean to converse with you in spirit, & with God Almighty on your behalfe, whom I love in the truth, and it would be the joy of my soule to heare of your prosperity therein, which I may not doubt of, or call it into question.
And it would not a little revive me, if the Lord pleased to cut out a way thereto, to see your faces be∣fore I fall asleep, and cease to converse with these terrene things.

I cannot in the meane season but commend these few following lines unto your Christian considerati∣on; which if they were the last words I were to breath out in this world, I could as a legacy freely commit and bequeath them unto you.
You may please to see in the former Epistle, what occasioned them to come so farre abroad, and not to seem to abide within the confines of a few despised people, as the rest of our poore endeavours seem to take up, and make it their aboad. Vouchsafe your payns to read them I beseech you, as a token of my unfeigned love, and listen unto God for interpretati∣on, who wil not faile to be a light unto you, and in them: You shall see what manner of food my soule lives by in this remote wildernesse, which I doubt not but will be relished by you, though in a populous Town or Citie.
Now the God of peace fill you with all peace and joy in believing,
Amen.
So prayeth he who is ever yours,
