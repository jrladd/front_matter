Good Madam,
WE live in an Age wherein the Belief of a future state, and of the happy condition of Good Men in the other World, is, (its to be feared) very weak and much decayed amongst many: and wherein the good Examples of such as mind this Future Life, and live in order to it, are too rare and thin. I hope therefore that it will not be thought Unseaâˆ£sonable by any at this time of day, to set forth a short Discourse to establish us in the one, and to help us to a view of the other; and that is the principal designe of this SERMON: Which for the Substance of it was first Preached, and now upon Your Request comes Forth with some Enlargements; which the straitness of the time then allotted, would not permit me to insist on:
 Such as it is, it is wholly devoted to the Churches and to Your Service. And that it may be of use to support You under your great Loss, and to induce such as shall Read it, to Believe what is here Asserted, and to Live thereafter, by Imitating the Good Example that is here given them, is, and shall be the hearty Prayer of
MADAM,
