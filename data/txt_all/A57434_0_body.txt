Right Honourable,
DOubtlesse it is not unknown to your Ho∣nours with what various expectations the Nations round about, & even the people amongst us, have fixed their eyes upon you, whom Providence hath set upon the English Throne. Cert∣ainely it was farre enough from your owne thoughts within these few moneths, and therefore you cannot be said to have been am∣bitious of it, much lesse to have long coveted it. To run di∣vision of mens different opinions touching the Call your Ho∣nours had thereunto, it cannot be expected, it should not be controverted, since nothing is exempt there from, and not a few believe all knowledge to be scepticall. But this I am sure of, that whereas all Powers and Governours hi∣therto did so much seeke themselves, as that either their own or their Predecessors swords made way for them, your Call and admittance hath been so peaceably, as doth clearly de∣menstrate the people did not only stand in need of you, but that you are obliged by all ties both divine and humane, to relieve them in this great extreamity of theirs, according to your utmost abilities, and the power which Providence
 shall invest you with all.
These Nations have beene reckoning or accounting with their Governours, and such as they sometimes honoured with authority over them for about these do∣zen yeares; one while advancing and setting up this person and party, and soon after pulling them down again, and at last routing them all, their Corporation and Chart∣er, by which through the prevalency of a crasie depraved major party, they began according to their Predecessors footsteps, to pretend they might by the Prerogative thereof give us stones instead of bread, and Serpents instead of fish, Mat. 7. Go on wasting of our blood and treasure, with∣out securing us in the liberty either of our own consciences, persons, or Estates: and whilst we thus bemoaned our sadde condition, sighing, groaning, and crying out, who will doe us good, in rescuing us from selfe-seeking Partisons, your Honours have set your selves in the gap, and undertaken our deliverance.
Goe on therefore with the same courage and integrity you have begun: and though your Predecessors left you much worke to doe, yet be not disheartned therewith, Supream Authority was never attained too with so much ease before, and cannot portend lesse then greatest Happinesse unto this Nation by improving the same aright, or greatest infelicity unto your selves, if you should forgoe the opportunity which is put into your hands. We say nothing is difficult unto a willing mind, much lesse to such as have both will and power, least of all when both Heaven and Earth concur in making smooth the wayes you have to walke in for working out deliverance unto these Nations. Wherefore as you have begun, goe on in the feare of God, and love to good men, let nothing amuse or startle you; there is no hazard or danger in doing good, and good is not so hardly distinguishable from evill, right from wrong, Mine from Thine, as Moun∣tebanke
 Statists, and Lawyers would make the world be∣lieve.
Please then to redeem the time your Predecessors have lost, and begin to gratifie us first with what we most stand in need of: Examine our Civill Lawes and Disciplin, mend, or make them such as may become suitable, wholsome, and thriving to us in time of peace, as our Martiall Laws and Discipline were during the late Warrs. To have no written Lawes may be thought to be a condition without rule, or lawlesse; and yet in whose heart is not the Eternall morall Law engraven'd? might not a people be better gover∣ned then this Nation hath been hitherto, without any other rule or standing Law then of not doing that unto any man, which a man would not have done unto himselfe? but be∣cause the written Law either out-reaches, or doth not reach most cases, it were better to have no writtten Law, no Com∣mon Law at all, then not to have a Chancery to quallifie it, as to contract or stretch it, according to the righteousnesse of all circumstances; but to be subject to the extreamities of them both singly, to be first rack'd, and made weary of our life and cause by the dull senselesnesse of one of them, the Common Law; and after that to be unrackt, rackt backe or over againe by the pleasure, suggestion, or nothing∣nesse of the other, the Court of Chancery, will much call the Judgment of this Nation in question, to be out-witted by a generation of Lawyers, and their hangers on, in being at charge to maintaine them at one fifth part of all our Reve∣nues yearly, for tormenting us, and continuing our lives and all we have at uncertainty, and their own mercy.
If we do but consider a little, wee shall easily finde that such a Court as we meane by a Common Law Court, must necessarily be so litterall, so bestial, as that it must not yeeld a haire upon any occasion; as well Gods glory, as good peoples
 welfare must be sacrificed to it; nothing but summum jus, rigid right, or right rigidness, which is summa inju∣ria, extream injuriousnesse, can be expected from it; only a knave or godlesse person who seekes no other happinesse, but his owne Revenge; nor hath other rule or conscience then his owne lust, will easily fence himselfe against the litteralnesse thereof, and expose the Innocent as a prey un∣to it.
On the other side, that which we call a Court of Chance∣ry, is such an absolute Prerogative Royall, as that every knave, oppressor, or revengefull person is able, upon no ground or cause at all, but meerely upon suggestion to com∣mence and continue a suite, from one generation to ano∣ther, with such plausability, according to the printed Or∣ders of the Court, and the Courts own contrary practice, as that to heare it argued, a man would not be able to guesse how it will likely be finally determined, about 20. or 30. yeares hence, unlesse hee could tell which side were like to have most money to fee most Councellors, and what Coun∣cellors were then so feed: But if you will resolve to dash both Courts in pieces one against the other, and erect one out of them both, endowing it with a power of Equity to Judge all people and causes in a middle way equally and indiffe∣rently, as neer the Letter of the standing Law as each re∣spective case can be brought, all circumstances considered according to principles of righteousnesse and reason, and so cashier those Laws, or legall cheates of Fines and Reco∣veries, Statutes, Statutes-Staple, Recognizances, Leases of Ejctment, Mortgages, Penall Bonds, difference of Tenures, difference of Actions, Writs of Error, Outlawries, Bills of Middlesex, and such other Law-legerdemain, the great mi∣stery of the Lawyers will be more common, and farre more easie then it is now, to Cook a dinner for their pallate. But

I beseech your Honours to reflect a little upon what I say in this particular: Our men of Law avouch their Mystery to be the most abstruce and difficult, and consequently to require the greatest art and study to be exact and profound therein of any in the world; whereas above 1600 yeares agoe the Apostle Paul reproaches the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 6.5. &c. in that there was not a wise man amongst them that might judge between his Brethren, and not suffer them to goe to Law before the Heathen: and what kinde of men were these that Paul there censures? surely much like the Coblers, Button-makers, Taylors, Weavers, with all manner of Handicrafts-men and Labourers, the inferior, poor, illeterate, despised of this Nation, who in the latter times of the world, we have observed to be zealous of the Honour of God, inquisitive after. Truth, and conscien∣tious towards their Brethren; and yet Paul thought they might, nay ought to have been wise enough to judge between their Brethren: surely Paul and our men of Law were of a different opinion, and I must crave leave to add, that if there had been amongst the Gentlemen of the Law-faculty, the like zeale to God-ward, or compassion towards their Brethren, they could never have so long endured to be pre∣sent at the Ear, and heare so many conscientious innocent people lye under oppression for want of English Lawes to re∣lieve them, nor so many righteous Causes to be formally ar∣raigned, condemned, and made Law-martyrs, without compassing a redresse for us before this time.
If the written Law, common Law, custome, be in the Cause in question, it will be as clear as the Sun, it will re∣quire no more then first to read the case, then the written Law, and the Judgement will follow as undeniable as the conclusion doth the premises of a rightly formed sillogisme.
Thus easie and clear would every Cause (to be decided
 by common Law) be, if it were taken in time, before it grew wild by the long run, and leisurely opened, and truly stated.
But if a Cause do not appeare thus clear to be determined at common law, then forthwith the equitable part of the Law takes thought of it, and the Judge having both of them to his guide, hath nothing else but this to consider of: That since ther was no written Law wch came home to the point, what a reasonable & understanding man ought to have don in such a case, all circumstances considered: and 2. how far forth the party complained of, hath acted by the rule ef such reason and understanding (which may be truly said to be the common law of Nature & Nations, not of England onely) and may be presumed to have done, as he would be done unto in such a case, and to give Judgement accord∣ingly.
Now whether upon such like notions, and further enqui∣ry, this, so much pretended dark Mystery of the Lawyers, may not become more prasticable and easie then Cookery, as I said, which is common to every houshold, let those Gen∣tlemen themselves, and the most ingenious Professors a∣mongst the rest, vvhen they have better leisure, give their opinion, tovvards the undeceiving, and so enfranchising of the People.
I vvould not be thought notvvithstanding to deny that these Gentlemen have not a kinde of lip-learning, or arti∣fice, especially of words and tearms, beyond men of other Trades and Callings, wherewith their Customers are either enchaunted, or led into by-paths, beyond their owne know∣ledge, and there left and lost both they and their estates. And how far forth such art and cunning is for their owne credit, and our good, let themselves be judges also.

But of all learning certainly that of the Lawyers is the most vaine, not onely unnecessary but mischievous, destru∣ctive to a Common-wealth: and I have no little wondred to heare them stiled in every Order, Councellours learned in the Law, but that it is by the Clerks and Registers of the same feather, and for their owne interest sake;I hope, and earnestly re∣quest such Gentlemen of this faculty, to whom I have any manner of Relation, and such especially to whom I acknow∣ledge many obligations (and who I conceive mean no wors then other men who finde themselves put, or settled by their Ancestors in a way or Calling which they thinke themselves little obliged to question or suspect) that they will not be offended at this language; since all Courtship, fair means, and long-suffering hath prevailed nothing with them, though sundry of the most eminent amongst them, professed the necessity of re∣dresse, and seriously engaged to see it done severall yeares since. whereas their learn∣ing is but Law-cheating, jugling, pocket-picking, which the tyranny of our former Governours (fear∣ing otherwise that they should not be thought to have Law as well as Gospel to uphold them in their op∣pression, and keeping us in igno∣rance) suffered us not to speak a∣gainst, or get redressed. I am sorry for my own Countrey sake to make this Observation of it: That there are not such cunning famous pick-pockets, cheaters, thieves, in any part of the World, as in this Island of England. And as this Myste∣ry of Law-cheating could not have been brought to passe, nor continued by its Abettors, with∣out a kind of gracelesse wit and ingenuity; so did not the rest of the Nation want wit enough to counter-worke and rout them, but that the people of this Nation have enjoyed lesse civil liberties then other Nations gnerally throughout the Papacy, and where its supremacy domineers; though they pen and keep them up close as to their Religion, yet in civill matters they have had much more freedome and li∣berty of propounding for or against what they saw condu∣ced to or against Common-weale, and by that meanes had
 the advantage to become sooner and more civillized, and to partake of more civill accomodations then England hath yet been happy in.
And because you have herein to deale with a numerous subtile party, the Anakim's and Goliah's of the Nation, against whom every individuall true English man, even out of self-preservation is obliged to come in to your assist∣ance, I, though amongst the least of them, yet being no lesse willing then engaged to appear faithfull in my station, doe humbly tender these ensuing Proposals.
Wherein though I speake often of depositions, examina∣tions, and Certificates taken upon Oath, yet it is onely by reason of the usuall practice thereof at present. My opinion being that Oaths should not be made so common, but that all men should neverthelesse be proceeded against for whatsoe∣ver they had damnified any man for false Witnessing, or crrtifying against him, though it were not upon Oath.
Scarce a motion at Common Law, or in Chancery, but if we offer it not, the Judge cryes out, Who makes Oath thereof. At Sessions and at Assizes, all up and downe the land, nothing but Oathing of it, swearing and forswearing, though not so often yet as publicke, and as unpunished, and the parties as remedilesse, though perhaps most Causes are lost by the perjurie of one or other. At Custome-house and Excise Office, nothing to be done without an Oath. Oh the Land doubtlesse suffers, and knows it not, by reason of Oaths, and so much the more have we to answer for, in that we make a meer formlaity thereof. First we make the people swear whether they lwill or no, and when that's done, we rest not thereupon, but cast about how to make them appeare for∣sworn, and when that's found out, we punish them not at all for the most part, and never proportionable to their transgression: But how easily might thi land be free from
 these great scandals and offences, and that with much ci∣vil ease and advantage, both unto the Governours and Peo∣ple. The chiefe use, I meane abuse, of Oaths, is as afore I have said, in our Courts of Justice, and about receipt of the Common-wealths duties of Custome, Excise, and Taxes throughout the Nation. Ʋpon all which occasions it is Pro∣pounded,
First, That all Evidence given in any Court of Justice, be either by the persons themselves present in Court, and that in such case to be registred, or else by way of Examina∣tions taken upon Interrogatories, or Certificate to be signed by the parties Examined, or certifying before a Judg, Justice of Peace, or other Officer appointed in that behalf, who may attest the said subscription, and if any person doe testifie or certifie any thing untrue, to the prejudice of his Neigh∣bour, whether in person, goods, or name, let him be lyable to satisfie all dammages and charges whatsoever, unto the utmost, and be punished corporally, and worke it out, if he have not wherewithall to discharge it otherwise.
Secondly, The securing of the Common-wealths duties without thus Oathing of it, and tormenting of the people is as easily compassed. The late Parliament by severall Acts and Ordinances, ordered them to be paid, and perticularly that of the Excise, according to such rules and rates as are thereby limited, imposing a forfeiture of double the value of the Goods of the Excise whereof the Common-wealth should at any time be defrauded: half this penalty had been sufficient if the said Acts and Ordinances had not imposed upon the people greater trouble and vexation then was ne∣cessary for securing of the duty, or just for the people to be exposed to about payment of it, which the grand Commissio∣ners and their Officers might with so much more ease and comfort to themselves, have executed.

Wherefore for such duties as must necessarily be conti∣nued, whether of Custome, Excise, or otherwise, when the Rates are once agreed upon, and ordered to be paid and re∣ceived with as little trouble and vexation as is consistent with security of the duty, the bare forfeiture of the Goods offending will be penalty sufficient, being restitution of a∣bout twenty for one upon most Comodities, one halfe to the Common-wealth, and the other halfe to the Informer: and who but a mad man will adventure ten or twenty to one, if the Orders for preventing frauds be but wisely con∣trived, and diligently and faithfully executed. Second∣ly, as to the Orders, that they be directed especially to secure the duty at the fountaine head, whilest the Comodities are in few hands, and easier to be looked after, as the Import∣ers, and Exporters for the Customes, Smelters of Lead, Tinners, Planters, and Grovers of all Native Comodities, Makers and Importers of all manner of Merchandize and Manufactures within the Land, lyable to the duty of Ex∣cise; and if these be but well taken care of, all the rest of the Nation, perhaps fifty or a hundred for one would be free from any manner of trouble, or vexation, which now every person throughout the Nation, by the letter of the Law, is subject to, if he buy, sell, or receive into his House but 5 s. worth of any Comodities whatsoever.
The Excise then may be made payable once a quarter in the-next Market Towne where the parties paying it reside, upon forfeiture of the goods, or full value thereof, the Ex∣cise whereof was not paid accordingly, and for the easier discovery of such fraud it is propounded.
1. That all persons who are obliged to pay Custome or Fxcise, or that buy of or sell to such person or persons as are obliged to pay the same, may be bound to keepe Books of Accompt as carefull and understanding Merchants and o∣thers
 ought to doe, wherein they may be required upon a penalty, fairly and truly to enter all and every such parcell or parcells of goods amounting to 20. s. and upwards, spe∣cifying the prices at which, and the time when, with the parties names to, or of whom such goods were bought or sold; and being required vpon like penalty to produce their Bookes upon all occasions of cleering or discovering all such persons as shall happen to be questioned about payment of such duties.
2. That whosoever upon such occasion shall be found to keep false Bookes, be understood and taken as a person that hath deceived the Common-wealth and his Neighbour, and proceeded against as a Perjurer, & made satisfie what the Common-wealth or his Neighbour had, or must suffer in appearance by this deceitfulnesse.
Now the keeping of Books or Accompts as discreet Mer∣chants and other Traders doe, though to some it may seem a slight matter, and therefore the lesse necessary to be im∣posed upon all Traders, is yet of so great concernment as that without it such Traders themselves, cannot under∣stand their owne Estates, nor whether they be in a thriving or declining condition, and consequently not know whe∣ther they get or loose by that Commodity, or whether at the yeares end they ought to enlarge or contract themselves; but goe on blind-fold untill they runne quite out of their E∣states, to the undoing of themselves, and all that are enga∣ged with them. But if it be granted to be a trouble to keepe Bookes of Accomps of what they buy or sell, and therefore ought not to be imposed upon a free people. It is answered, that it saves and prevents them & hundreds of others the trouble and vexation of being questioned in other occasions, which is not only a more common good, but to them a more peculiar advantage if they knew how to make a right judg∣ment
 thereof: Besides, this exact keeping of Accompts is a kind of Record of all their dealings, which, whosoever are partners with them may have recourse to, and see what be∣nefit or losse accrues by such trading, and at least be sure that they fare as well as he that hath the managing of the Trade, and according to the Covenants between them, and from hence it happens, that for the most part all Noble men, Gentlemen, and others, as they are distinguished in Italy, and the Low Countries (two industrious and ingenious Nations, and such as we need not be ashamed of, to take ex∣ample by in businesse of this nature) that are populous. When they have money by, do willingly adventure it with Merchants and Shop-keepers, and goe partners or sharers in their dealings for all parts of the world, to the much en∣riching of those Countries; whereas here in England, if a man put in a summe of money in stocke with a Merchant, Shop-keeper, or Grasier, or other dealer, it is twenty to one but such Adventurer shall not only loose his money, but ne∣ver have good account how it came to be consumed and wasted, because such persons who had the managing of the businesse kept no exact account of their dealings, for such Adventurer to have recourse unto, and see how his adven∣ture thrived from time to time, and so contribute his ad∣vice therein as occasion and the nature thereof might have required.
I purposely forbeare to alledge any reasons for this or that Proposall, or to presse the necessity of any of them so farre as I justly might, because I know you have so little leisure to peruse them, and believe that the Lawes with the present Proceedings are become so vexatious unto this Na∣tion generally, as that you cannot choose but behold the people to be weary of them, and resolved not to endure them longer, but rather choose to make tryall of any other
 then that the same should be still continued: But withall do not doubt but that the rationality, and demonstrablenesse of most of these Proposalls will appeare so cleare unto your Honours, as will not only stirre up a resolution in you, but will keep you mindfull, untill you have new modelled, if not quite new made them, as you shall see cause for.
The next generall which requires your Honours speedy assistance, may be the securing or enriching of this Nati∣on, or both in one, and that consists in trading; for a people that shall be content to apply themselves to Tillage and Pasturage only, which possibly may be sufficient to finde themselves with food and rayment, will not be long able to protect themselves from Invasion of Forraigners, in regard such Land or Countrey would be exceeding thin of people, and not able to defend it selfe in all their quarters against such as would invade them.
There cannot therefore be any lasting security without trading. Trade like a continuall Market or Faire, invites people from all bordering Countreyes, and makes a Nati∣tion become populous: Besides, the greatest Trade of the world hath a capacity of undermining and eating out the lesser Trades of the world: the greatest Trade cannot be compassed without the greatest strength at Sea; and who∣soever can make and continue the greatest strength at Sea, will enjoy the greatest Dominion of the world, which would long since have been reduced to one Monarchy, or one Common-wealth, had not such Monarch or Common∣wealth, who at any time was most powerfull, and so in the fairest capacity of reducing all the rest, fallen short in their politicks and Goverment.
Had the Ʋnited Provinces been reduced into one Com∣mon-wealth, they had beene in a likelier posture of com∣passing this universall Monarchy, then ever the Romans
 were, who purchased all they had at the swords point; or the modern Kings of Spain, who thought to have done it by their West-India Treasures, as indeed they might, had they withall but known, and joyned thereto, the maine Engine, and right State-mystery of compassing the same, which is to encrease Trade and Navigation. But this proud Nation stands so much upon what they call Gentility, and is no other then a condition not to be necessitated to worke, as that they will not labour in any callng an houre longer then to keepe themselves from starving. A very Farrier will stand at his doore with a grave bayes Cloake on downe to his heeles, and his Rapier by his side, untill you bring your Horse to hi to be shoed, and then to worke he goes; so soone as your Horse is shoed, on goes his long Cloake and Rapier again, and hee as great a Don as e∣ver; which being the humour of the whole Nation, they are so farre-besotted therewith, as that much like the peo∣ple of Guinney, they exchange their gold and silver of the West Indies, wherewith they might either have traded all the world out of their possessions by degrees insensibly for nothing, or bought them out of their free-hold at above forty yeares purchase; I say so many millions of money have they parted with unto other Nations for trifles to feed their own pride and luxury, which hath not onely set those other Nations at Warres amongst themselves, but enabled them to oppose the Spaniard in his aspiring unto the Ʋni∣versall Monarchy.
But let us take heed, the united Provinces have first made discovery of this grand Engine and State-mistery of encreasing Trade and Navigation for acquiring Dominion, and conserving it by good Government, wherein they ex∣cell all Governours of the world, by distributing Justice at home both indifferently and speedily, and protecting such
 as live under them from all Forreign Enemies abroad; th y have made use thereof, and thrived thereby beyond all for∣mer generations; and had they but gained Antwerp and Bridges, and been reduced into one Common-wealth or Principality (which might as easily have been done, and is still to be done as easily, as it was for England (which our eyes have seene) and Scotland to become one in 12. moneths) before we attaine to be true Trade-Statesmn) neither these three Nations most appropriate to command the rest, if we knew our own strength, nor any other in likelihood would be timely wise enough to oppose the succes∣full enlarging of their Dominions.
Now these two generals I presume your Honours will find necessary to be speedily dispatched, and that sundry others may not be left undispatched, as the freeing tender consci∣ences from paying Leviticall Tithes unto a Gospel-ministry which they owne not, the keeping people from begging and starving in the streets for want of employment. The lessning or quite taking away Taxes so soon as may be, with many o∣ther of no lesse Import, which I was bold to propound un∣to the late Parliament; and had they put in Execution, as they might have done with no lesse ease unto themselves, then great advantage unto these Nations, their Honours would not have been so blasted as we now behold them. But since they still remain undone, and continue still to be of the same necessary concernment both unto our security and well being, I crave leave to annex them hereunto, not without some assurance, that if your Honours shall be at liesure to cast an eye thereon (and find that a stocke of money enough to compasse all of them, defray all manner of publick charge, and enable the Parliament by degrees, even in a few yeares to take off all manner of Taxes and Excise; and whatsoever else may be desired is as easily attainable without givng the
 least cause of complaint to any sort of men within this Com∣mon-wealth, as that it cannot fail if you but say the word, & practice it withall, only through managing some businesse of the Nations after a more ingenious method, then hath been discovered unto our Ancestors, and is now tendred to be made demonstrable by the Propounder) you will be so farre from thinking your time mispent in your perusall of them, as that you will be somewhat more enflamed, untill you see them accomplished, unto the exceeding great rejoycing of your own soules, and of such as humbly concurr with you therein, and in what else shall be found needfull for the farther making out, and establishing this Common-wealth and other Nations derivatively from hence, in wayes of Peace, Truth, and Righteousnesse, unto all succeding Ge∣nerations.
The Reader is desired to mend with his Pen what the Printer hath mistaken.
