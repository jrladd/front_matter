IT is none of the least or most inconsiderable Arguments to evince and prove the Dignity and Preciousness of the Soul of Man; that Almighty God has been pleased to Institute a Sacred and Di∣vine Office in his Church, on purpose for the Benefit and Advan∣tage of it, and to appoint a Distinct Order of Men (his Mini∣sters I mean) whose whole Employ and Concern it is peculiarly to Watch over the Souls of his People, and to be accountable to him for the same. In this Delightful Service of God and of your Souls I have now worn out more than three Apprenticeships amongst some of you, Endeavouring with my utmost Care and Diligence to excite the Care∣less and Unconcerned Sinners on the one hand, and to direct the Weak and Doubting Christian on the other hand to the Practice of their re∣spective Duties: For it is hard to say, from which Religion suffers most, whether from the Want of Zeal in some, or from the Mistakes of Zeal in others. Besides my Publick Advices to you in God's House, your Consciences can Witness for me; that I have taken some Pains (and if God continues my Health, I resolve to take much more) in the Duty of Private Inspection and Ministerial Conference with you, in your own Houses, in order to your Preparation for that Venerable Ordi∣nance of the Lords Supper, which to the great Scandal of our most Holy Religion, is so shamefully neglected by multitudes of Persons professing Christianity, of all perswasions amongst us: Exhorting you also to set up Religion and the Worship of God in your private Families, that God may dwell where you dwell. But the Answer of many of you has been this, We want Abilities; we are willing, but not able to perform those Duties without some Assistance: In great Charity there∣fore to those of you who want such a Help as this, and are willing to make use of it, I put this small Paper into your Hand, which I en∣treat you to accept both as an Instance of my Duty, and as a Monitor of your Own.
Know assuredly, Sirs, it will be the Portion of many of God's Mini∣sters at the Great Day (I pray God it may never be mine) to be called forth as Witnesses against their own People, when Almighty God will thus interrogate us in the presence of Men and Angels; Did you not Admonish this People of the sin and danger of a resolute Impiety? did you not warn them of their Neglect of Sacraments and Holy Duties, pub∣lickly, privaeely, personally? Must we not plainly and faithfully de∣clare
 that all our melting Entreaties and passionate Importunities could er prevail with you to part with your Sins; but you would choose rather to gratifie your Lusts than to obey your Reason? Then will our Lord say unto us, I pronounce you pure and Innocent from the Blood o these Men; Oh joyful Word to us! But to Sinners will he say, Your Destruction be upon your own Heads; what could I or my Ministers have done more for you that has not been done? therefore Depart ye Cur∣sed into Everlasting Misery: Oh doleful Word to them! God grant tha your and my Ears may never hear it.
Beloved, it is your Commendation and my Comfort, that when in this wanton Age, a Spirit of Giddiness has possest the Minds of many that they are tossed too and fro with every Wind of Doctrine, trying all things in deed, but holding fast nothing; you have been unanimous in this part of your Duty, keeping close to the Publick Assemblies, and continuing stedfast in the Apostle's Doctrine and Christian Fellowship and in Breaking of Bread and in Prayers.
But know, that the best Communion and best Religion in the World▪ the holiest Doctrine and the purest Worship; will be of no avail to im∣pure Worshippers and impure Livers: God grant therefore that you and I may Oblige our selves to such an Eminent and Exemplary Piety of Conversation, in all the several Instances of our Duty, as may render the Unspotted Religion of the Holy Jesus venerable to the World: And may Almighty God, who sometimes delights to do great things by weak means, be pleased to succeed these well-design'd Endeavours of mine, in order to your Advantage, that so in God's House and in your own also the most solemn Acts and Exercises of Religious Worship, may be per∣formed by you with such a becoming gravity and sincerity of Devotion, that the Name of our Holy Lord may be glorified, your Souls comforted with the sense of Pardon and Peace here, and everlastingly refreshed with Joys unspeakable and full of Glory, hereafter; so prayeth
Dedham,
