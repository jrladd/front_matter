SIR,
ONe being friendly chid∣den, that he did not write Books, made this answer, ut libet non licet, ut licet non li∣bet; As he would he could not, and as he could he would not. I con∣fesse I have been often expostu∣lated withall by some particu∣lar friends & relations, (who usu∣ally over rate whom they love,) hy in this scribbling age, where∣in the Pen is so Rheumatick, I have never appeared in Print  but my answer is made before;

I attest the searcher of hearts, never thought any light that shone from my darknesse, wor¦thy to bee set on so publique a Stage, especially in this censo∣rious age, which like August Caesar, Taxeth all the World wherein (by reason of the con¦trarietie of mens judgements and affections) Sermons are made b the Whetstones for men to sharpen their tongues upon.
The causes which move me a this time to be more publique besides the importunitie  friends, (the ordinary Midwif of the Presse) are these, first that I might once in my life be¦stow a small Token on the Spou of Christ; and secondly, that might in a slender gift, give a te¦stimony of a not slender affecti¦on towards you, not having

If my abili∣litie were as large as my heart, I would do more to honour you; bee pleased therefore to accept what I can, since I cannot doe what I would.
These poor thoughts of mine must needs redound upon your selfe, for every thing must ac∣knowledge its first Spring and rise; they were yours in service to your desire, be pleased to let them be yours in acceptance and Patronage. The God of truth and peace give you to be famous in Ephrata, and do worthily in Beth∣lehem, that you may lay out all your power and affections in a flaming zeal of the glory of Gods truth and the Kingdoms peace, which is the constant prayer of him, who is,
