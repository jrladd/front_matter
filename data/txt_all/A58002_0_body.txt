DREAD SOVERAIGN,
THESE following Treati∣ses,
which contain the Arti∣cles
of Faith, and Customs
of the Greek and Armenian Church∣es,
are a Task, which some Years
past, Your Royal Self was pleased to

impose upon me; which though it be
a Work more proper and fit to be un∣dertaken
by some Learned Divine,
rather than by a Person of my Pro∣fession;
yet, being moved thereunto
by Command of Your Majesty, I e∣steemed
the Incumbence thereof to be
a Duty, as obligatory as any other Act
of Obedience which I owe unto your
Majesty, from which nothing but
Death, or Sickness, or some other vio∣lent
disappointment could absolve me.
But that I have been thus tardy in
the Execution of Your Royal Com∣mand,
was occasioned by my Atten∣dance
on Your Majesties Affairs in
Turky, which being protracted be∣yond
my expectation, I deferred the
payment of this Debt until I could make
tender of it with my own hands, and per∣sonally,
on my Knees at the same time,
beg a remission for the defect. Being
now therefore, by God's Providence,

returned to my own Country; behold
me (Great Sir) at the Foot-stool of
Your Throne to pay this my Vow,
which I always esteemed both Sacred
and Religious, and therefore tender
it with a fear and trembling agreeable
to that vast distance and disproportion
which is between Your Sublime Ma∣jesty,
and the humblest of your Ser∣vants:
For Your Majesty, who tran∣scends
in Wisdom, is able to penetrate
into the deepest Points of these Dis∣courses,
and make more judicious Re∣flections
thereon, than the ablest Clerks
and Criticks of the Schools; to which,
when I add that admirable Spirit
which. God often-times bestowes on
Kings, illuminating them like Pro∣phets,
and bestowing on them super∣eminent
Graces, I cannot but with
profound reverence and awe, expose
this little Work to the judicious and
perspicatious Eye of Your Majesty,
and with the same care and caution

offer nothing but what is sincere, and
approved by the Confession of the Ori∣ental
Faith, and allowed by the ablest
Divines of the Greek Church to be
consentaneous to their Doctrine, hav∣ing
therein offered nothing out of par∣tiallity,
to the Cause of the Reformed
Churches, or prejudice to the Papal
Interest.
If this Treatise may find accep∣tance
with Your Majesty, I shall ac∣count
my self extremely happy, and
be encouraged to dedicate all my va∣cant
hours, and recesses from more ne∣cessary
and publick Services, to Stu∣dies
grateful to Your Majesty, and
useful to my Country: For, being the
Son of that Father, who, by his Ser∣vices
and Sufferings, hath set a fair
Example to his Posterity, of Loyalty
and Obedience to Your Majesty, and
of Conformity to the Church of Eng∣land,
I have, in the largest Chara∣cters,

Copied out that Lesson, and
thereby delight my self in nothing so
much, as when I am performing my
Duty and Services towards God and
Your Majesty; who am, with all Alla∣crity and Devotion,
Your Majesty's
Most obedient, most loyal, most humble
Subject, and meanest of your Servants,
