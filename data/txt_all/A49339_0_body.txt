May it Please Your Lordship,
IT is the Misfortune of our times to have Religion at once as∣saulted by a Rude and Igno∣rant Profaneness, by a Confident pretence to reason, and by Sceptical

Sophistry. Its Foundations are at∣tack'd by the Profess'd Enemies of God and Goodness: Its Mysteries are Ridicul'd by Hereticks, as if they intended to invite Atheists to their Assistance, to joyn a Helping Hand to the Carrying on so Good a Work, as the Exposing Religion, and making it appear Absurd and Contemptible. And as if it were not Task enough to Encounter Open Enemies, it hath the Hard Fate of it's Blessed Author to be Wounded in the House of it's Friends: whilest many of those who seem to Embrace it, are much more Industrious to Raise Doubts and Scruples about it, than to Establish the Funda∣mental Truths of it; or else lay down such Loose Principles, that Wicked Men may deduce their own Conclusions from them, and

can't but please themselves to see their Work done to their Hands, and Christianity Undermin'd by the Imprudence or Treachery of it's own Votaries. Thus by De∣grees Men have proceeded from Arguing about Obscure and Nice Matters to question Known and Certain Truths; and from Dispu∣ting about the Points and Tittles of the Law, to Reject the Divine Authority of the whole: from thence to Decry all Revelation, because they cannot exactly Com∣prehend how God's Spirit Influ∣ences and Cooperates with Man's Understanding: and at last to cast off Religion in General. So True is that which a Great Man has Observ'd, That the Disesteem of the Scriptures is the Decay of Religion, and through many Turnings and Windings at last

leads Men into the very Depth of Atheism.
My LORD, The Design of the Letters which I have Undertaken to Answer, is to Perplex Men's minds with Difficulties about the Nature of Inspiration, and there∣by render the Divine Authority of those Writings suspected, which the Church has always lookt up∣on as the Sacred Depositum of Divine Truth, which God has committed to it's Trust, and De∣sign'd for it's Guide and Oracle. When first I saw this Treatise turn'd into English, I was in Hopes that some of our Eminent Divines, whose Writings are so Deservedly Admir'd for their Strength and Clearness, would have Vindicated the Authority of the Scriptures, and Clear'd their Title to Inspiration from those

Difficulties with which Men that are Better at Pulling down than Building up, have perplexed it. The Subject has never yet been throughly Handled, and is Wor∣thy the Thoughts of those Great Masters of Learning, Reason and Judgement. But after I had wait∣ed some time, and could not hear that any Abler Person Intended to take this Work in hand, I re∣solved to do my Best Endeavour toward the Defence of so Good a Cause, and give a Check to those Opinions which tend to Under∣mine all Revelation. And when I had finished my Design, there were many Considerations moved me to present it to your Lordship: not doubting but your Known Candor and Goodness would par∣don the Confidence of this Ad∣dress. Your Eminent Dignity in

the Church makes You deservedly Esteem'd a Pillar of Religion and Truth; Your Constant Residence in Your Diocess, and Your Care and Vigilance to keep up the Good Orders and Discipline of the Church there, preserve the Purity of it's Doctrine, and give a Due Lustre to it's Constitution; and your Generous and Obliging Temper Charms Men into a Com∣plyance with your Good Counsel and their own Duty. And as these Considerations Embolden'd me to Present this Treatise to your Lordship, which is writ in Vin∣dication of those Sacred Truths, for the Defence and Confirma∣tion of which your Lordship is Placed in that High Station; so Your Signal Courage in Opposing the Enthusiasts of the Late Times, whose Vile Hypocrisy, and Lewd

Pretences to Inspiration have made way for Open Profaneness and Contempt of all Revel'd Re∣ligion, Encourages me to hope that your Lordship will favou∣rably accept this Work, how mean soever, whose Design 'tis to put some stop to those Lasting Ill-Effects which have proceeded from such Pernicious Principles. And beside these Publick Consi∣derations, this Work does Implore your Lordship's Protection as be∣ing Visitor and Patron to the Col∣lege of which the Author is a Member: who readily Embraces this Opportunity of Declaring to the World how Happy that So∣ciety esteems it Self in having the Honour of your Lordships Patro∣nage, whose Government they formerly found to be so Great a Blessing; and withal is glad of so

good an Occasion of making this Publick and Grateful Acknow∣ledgement of those Favours where∣with your Lordship has been pleased to Oblige,
My LORD,
