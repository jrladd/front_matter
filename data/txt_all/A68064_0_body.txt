WHen Iupiters head was great with
childe, and the time of trauaile nere
at hand: he skorning to complaine,
yet put to his shiftes, was faine to
send for Vulcan the Smith, to crase
his crowne with a downedriuing
blow; not only to cause the swel∣ling
to cease, but also to prouide
passage for the birth of his babe. Which thing when
Vulcan had performed in giuing him a sound pat on the
pate, out start Pallas at the opening of his head, and dan∣ced
before him so maiden-like, that the present sight so
pleasant, expelled all former paines in the birth. Euen so
(most worthie sir) when the confused Chaos of this mat∣ter
following, was first inhabitant in my witlesse head:
then feared I no such swellings, as since I did feele, nor re∣garded
those throwes, which now are ouerpast. Neuer∣thelesse,

when my braines fell to their busines, and began
to beate as tho my head had been ready to burst, disdai∣ning
withall the help of mother Crackfart the Midwife;
Iuno Lucina was as deafe as a dishclout, so that Volens
nolens I betooke my selfe to the hearbe Hellebore, whose
pleasant operation produced so present a purgation, that
forthwith there followed a most speedie deliuerance, ex∣cluding
cares, renuing ioy. This young impe thus borne,
being brought to the font, was named Bacchus Bounty.
Which Bounty I willingly offer vnto your worthines;
doubting not at all, but that you will highly accept of
him; not only because he is a bonny boy, and the gift of
a welwiller: but also because hee was begot by Bacchus
your welbeloued friend; conceaued by me, & nourished
euer since with the iuice of the grape. From Ale-foorde
this 9. of December. Anno Dom. 1592.
