FOure thinges▪
(Right courteous)
the Philosophers
highly  to
haue continuall residence in a no∣ble
and a gentle minde; a courage
to repell the encroching enemy;
a ha to consider a loyall freed:

a hande to rewarde the gif of
the simple: and clemencie to ac∣cept
and pardon a well meaning
minde.
All these by nature spreading
gallantly in you bothe, vrged me
to commend this little motion of
great goodwill, vnder your wun∣ted
fauoure and freendly patro∣nage:
Knowing that the hardest
Adamant, dipped in the blood of a
Lion or a Goate, will mollifie
from the hardnes it containeth
by nature. Euen so the simplest
woorke, presented to persons of
so great wisdome and grauitie,
will be construed according to the
good meaning of the man, and
not after the vnlearned phrase of
the simple matter.
Thus remayning, bothe in du∣tie
and desire, the moste affectio∣ned

to your continuall well fare:
I wish as great content to you
in the reading, as it hath
beene bothe paine
and pleasure to
me in the
writing.
