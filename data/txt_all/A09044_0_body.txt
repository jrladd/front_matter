THe Hope of these, and glasse of future times,
O Heros which eu'n enuie itselfe admir's,
Vouchsafe to guarde, & patronize my rimes,
My humble rime, which nothing else desir's;
But to make knowne the greatnes of thy minde,
To Honors throne that euer hath been inclyn'd.


Geue leaue a while vnto my breathing Muse.
To pause vpon the accent's of her smarte,
From the respite of this short-taken truce,
For to recorde the actios of my Harte:
Which vowed hath, to manifest thy worth,
That noble fruites to future age bringes foorth.


Eu'n thou alone, which strengthn'st my repose,
And dest geue life vnto my dead desire,

Which malice daunt'ste, that did thy fame oppose,
Now, with reuiuing hope, my quill inspire:
So he may write, and I may glorie singe,
That time, in time, may plucke out enui's stinge.


Renowned Patron, my wayling verse,
To whose protect I flye for friendly ayde,
Vouchsafe to heare, while I my woes rehearse:
Then my poore muse, will neuer be dismaide,
To countenance the babling Eccho's frowne,
That future age may ring of thy renowne.


I that ere-while with Pan his hindes did play,
And tun'd the note, that best did please my minde,
Content to sing a sheapheards Round-delay;
Now by thy might, my Muse the way did finde,
With Maddrigals, to store my homely stile,
Graed with th'applause, of thy well graced smile.


Eu'n thou I say, whose trauaile hope doth yeilde,
That honours worth, may reape a due rewarde,
Which flyes with natiue plume vnto the fielde;
Whose paines deserues thy cuntreys iust regarde:
Time cannot dashe, nor enuie blemish those,
Whom on fam's strength, haue built their chiest repose,


Tis only that, which thou mayst clayme thine owne,
Deuouring time, cannot obscure the same,
In future age by this thou mayst be knowne,

When as posterities renue thy fame:
Then thou being dead, salt lyfe a newe possesse,
When workes nor wordes, thy worthynes expresse,


Then shall my time a sort of strength remaine,
To shielde the florish of thy high renowne,
That ruin's force may neu'r graces stain,
Which with fames sound, shall through the worlde bee blowne:
Yf that th'ocean which includ's our stile,
Would passage graunt out of this noble Isle.


For steling tyme of muses lowe remaine.
Will from the fountaine of her chiefe conceyte,
Still out the fame, through Lymbecke of my braine,
That glorie takes the honour to repeate:
Whose subiect though of royall accents barde,
Yet to the same, vouchsafe thy due rewarde,


So shall my selfe, and Pen, bequeath their toyle,
To sing, and write prayes, which it selfe shall prayse,
Which time with cutting Sithe, shall neuer spoyle,
That often worthy Heros fame delayes:
And I encouraged by thy applause,
Shall teach my muse on higher thinges to pause.
