May it please Your Honour,
MY present Service is so much the more valuable to me, since I was preferred thereto by Your Recommendation, which I shall endeavour to preserve with un∣wearied Industry and constant Fidelity. Your Favour, Sir, is a Blessing my Soul is too narrow to enclose, and me

thinks I can hardly be reconciled to that Divinity which calls Pride a Sin. But if I am guilty, I heartily beg Your par∣don, and permission to subscribe,
