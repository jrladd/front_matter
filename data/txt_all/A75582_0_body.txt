Great Sir,
I Presume the de∣dication of these papers without any Apologie to your Lordship, having been already presen∣ted to States and Princes; not that your Highness (in whom so many princely ver∣tues are constellated) stood in need of a translation, but
 that an obvious Dialect might supersede the pains of an Original Traverse, and re∣mit unto your Lordship all possible time to satisfie the importunity of those affairs which do publickly solicite you for a dispatch of them. Had not the concernments of truth been of greater im∣portance to me then any per∣sonal consideration (though I am not stupidly insensible) I should have been loth my Lord—But in as much as the name of Arminians is violently obtruded upon us, who beleeve that Christ di∣ed for all, and tasted death for every man according to the Scriptures, whereby our persons are indevoured to be rendered odious, and the blessed word of the kingdom
 in our mouths scandalous and offensive, I judged it reaso∣nable to offer the authors judgment to English view; not that I desire the Transla∣tion of his should be lookt up∣on as the interpretation of mine (being never yet drawn by any inquisitory examini∣nation to a full approbation or dislike of it) but that I might put an opportunity in∣to the hands of indifferent men, of resolving themselves that Arminius was no such monster in religion as some men have attempted to re∣present him, and that his name stands undeservedly blotted in the Ecclesiastick Rolls of continual obloquie. It was a worthy essay of Your Highness upon occasi∣on at Whitehall; That it was
 not so much what a man held, but how he held it; (A religous calenture hath alwaies been a dangerous ma∣ladie in the Eye of State-Physitians) I am confident the Doctor in this draught of himself will abundantly please you, in whom Learning and Ingenuity, Piety and Mode∣ration contend together for the mastery, and this by the happy ducture of christian Principles; which if the like tenderness, candour and mo∣desty had been used by the Reformed Churches in Scot∣land and Geneva, they had not given that cause by their fa∣ction and disobedience to the Duke of Savoy, and other persons of great and lesser quality to complain of them, and indevour the extirpatati∣on
 of their religion. Wit∣ness those sad Massacres in France; that lately in Pie∣mont, so fatal to the Hugonets barracado'd from the stroke of justice with their own en∣gines.
It would not become me to unravell this bottom, ho∣ping by the timely interpo∣sure of Your Lordships wis∣dome and goodness, with the care and prudence of those noble Patriots about you, we may not have ground (in things of less alloy) to expo∣stulate in our own Country: Its well known (my Lord) what countenance the Scrip∣tures carry with the do∣ctrine of general atonement, and how much it looks like the doctrine of the Church of England (so we call it)
 and that the major part of the Bishops and Doctors during the Episcopal Hierarchy, were deeply babtized there∣into, and the late King him∣self: yet did they never dis∣countenance piety and lear∣ning in men of the contrary judgment, either in Country or University, by rendering them uncapable of imploy∣ment, either Civil or Ecclesi∣astick, or draw them to re∣cant their opinions before their institution and inducti∣on into any place; witness the credit and promotion of Sibbs, Preston, Pridjeux, Holds∣worth, Bromrig, Love, Hall, &c. Nay great Strafford president of the Court in the North, did in the hearing of some persons, who are still living testimonies thereof,
 publickly rebuke some Mini∣sters of the Arminian party so called (though he himself a great promoter of that in∣terest) for bearing themselves high upon court favour, and told them, it was the will of his master and the Doctors of the Church, that all modera∣tion should be used herein. The Scoene is altered; these pluck't off the stage, and your Lordship taken up. I should be highly injurious to those many sacred vows and pro∣testations your Highness hath so often made for Chri∣stian Liberty, should I enter∣tain a thought you would act your part with less ten∣derness and indulgency than any of those that have had their fatal Exit. My Lord, You have been a man of
 War, Liberty was that Mot∣to in your Ensign which en∣couraged the Soldiers of Christ to fight and pray un∣der you, & for which I make no question victory came so often and lighed upon your banner: I beseech you by the mercies of God, and by what ever is dear or near unto you, that you would not expose us by your authority to the wills of those who are so straitned in their principles, as their affections, in brotherly tole∣ration are shut up against us likewise; but that all your Acts of Grace, like the Or∣ders of Heaven issuing out from your great Master, may impartially look to the good of all. I cannot (with the zeal of Arminius) petition your Highness for a Natio∣nal
 Synod, and to establish Ecclesiastick Sanctions by ci∣vill authority, left in have the same event (or somwhatAn. 1618, & 1619. worse) with the Dort-Confe∣rence, but (salving the honor and consciences of those Gentlemen, the commissio∣ners for Approbation of Mi∣nisters) I must needs think the nature of Orthodox and He∣terodox would be better prov'd by a subscription to a known Confession of Faith drawn up in Scripture terms & phrases, according to wch the Preachers of the Gospel might & ought to frame and level their judgments and do∣ctrines; then by the sudden and extempore resolves to a few unpredimeditated Que∣stions (till the present occa∣sion) lockt up in the breasts of some particular men.
 And this I am bold to offer to your Lordship, not as to one of Machiavells Princes, who will not follow Reli∣gion too close at the heels; or to a Roman Gallio, who careth for none of these things; but as to a good Josiah, whose heart melted at the hearing of the Law, and covenanted with his God, to take away all the abominations out of all the Countreys that per∣tained2 Chron. 34 35. to the Children of Israel. That no Pharaoh Ne∣cho may come up against you, and the people of this Land; but that peace and prosperi∣ty may attend You, and your Name be as apretious oynt∣ment poured out upon the inhabitants of Zion, is the un∣feigned Prayer of
My Lord,  June 5. 1655.
