A. Siluer flower from your rich orient eyes,
N. Ae tricking downe thoe Alpe where Beautie keepeth,
Would more adorne the Tombe where Delia lies;
Since that a Virgin for a Virgn weepeth.
Good Lady from your Heart one thought I craue,
To thke how poore your Delia lyes in Graue:
And to weepe a teare, that will not mooue ye
Infortunate was she, so deare to loue ye:
But I dare sweare your eyes haue wept รถ many,
That you are not a teare behande with any.
