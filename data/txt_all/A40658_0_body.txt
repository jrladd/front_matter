MADAME,
SAint Paul in the first to
the Thessalonians, chap.
2. vers. 18. saith unto
them, I would have
come unto you once and again,
but Satan hindred us. I may make
use of the former part of his Expres∣sion,
applying it to my frequent In∣tentions
to visit the Place of your
Abode, and bestow some Spirituall
paines therein.
But I must not play Satan with
Satan, be a false Accuser, to charge
on him the frustrating of my Design,
(though generally he be a Back-Friend
to all good Desires) but must
justly impute it to my owne manifold
avocations.
May your Ladyship now be plea∣sed
to see what you expected to
heare, and reade what I intended to
speake. The first of these Sermons
was designed for your Fore-Noones,
the latter for your After-Noones Re∣past.
I am confident you will not mea∣sure
my respect to you to be the lesse,
because the benefit to others may be
the greater by publishing thereof; and
request you to accept hereof, not as
intende a full payment for my ma∣ny
Obligations unto you, but as tende∣red

in consideration of your forbear∣ance,
till I am enabled to expresse
my Gratitude in a greater propor∣tion.
The Lord blesse you in your Selfe,
dayly sanctifying your rare naturall
Endowments with his choisest Gra∣ces;
blesse you in your Sele divided,
your Worthy Husband; in your
Selfe multiplyed, your hopefull
Sonne; and slowly, but surely, ter∣minate
your Prosperitie here with
endlesse happinesse hereafter: The
heartie desire of
