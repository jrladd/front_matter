THOSE two very things, Right
Noble and Honourable Sir, to
wit, the greatness of your Name,
and the smallness of this Work, which
might disswade me from such an Appli∣cation,
do both of them invite, and in
some sort engage me, to adventure, not
only to make a Present of this Book, but
also a particular Dedication thereof unto
you. And seeing that it is a thing most
certain, and that the very sight of the
Book doth immediately shew it, that
what I here offer is a Piece that is altoge∣ther
new, but yet neither over bulky nor
prolix, I was perswaded that this my Un∣dertaking
would not prove unpleasing to
you, because that as the Great are very
much taken with the Novelty of other
things, even so they are of Books; and
as a conciseness in speaking is very agree∣able

to them, a short and compendious
way of Writing is found to be no less so,
which has given occasion to that old Pro∣verbial
Adage, Little things are pretty.
To this I may add, that this Book briefly
treats of things transacted up and down,
and for some time in that Nation, where
in the Name of the Renowned States, you
have been first Envoy to the Most Potent,
and most Serene Princes, King William
and Queen Mary (to that great and glori∣ous
Queen, alas, lately ravished from Earth
by inexorable Fate, of whose Vertues there
are at this time so many Testimonies in
the funebrous Orations of great and most
Eloquent Men, who for all that, had
they never so much exhausted their brains,
and been profuse of their Abilities in de∣claring
and magnifying the Excellencies
of this Queen, had yet nee'r been able
to form a true Idea of them in their
Thoughts, much less represent them as
they ought to be, to their Auditors, than
which nothing more can be said of Man)
and after that, for some time Resident
there, where you were to Congratulate
Their Royal Majesties Accession to the
Throne, and the Deliverance of so many
Countries and People, as also to confirm
that Ancient League and Amity that was
between both Nations: In which Time
and Place, seeing that perhaps some but

not all these things came within the
Verge of your Knowledge; this new
and small Treatise, but (Pardon the Ex∣pression)
, may gratifie
that desire, which your Honour, and
even most Men have, who have lived or
come from abroad, of having a perfect
Knowledge of such Transactions, as have
happened in those places during their
time, or near unto it, by exhibiting as in
a little Table-Book, the first Rise, Pro∣gress,
and End of all these doings: But
yet this is not all the Reason I had for
such an Undertaking; I must confess,
Illustrious Sir, that as to the matter of
this Work, it is such as may seem to
them that are not very curious, needless
and unnecessary, and that it is such a
way or method, as may easily induce
some who are not over-skilful, but given
to scoff and chatter, to look upon it as
very mean and contemptible, because
that having regard only to the single
Relation of Things, and to Truth, I
treat thereof in a Style and Language
that is plain and ordinary, free from all
manner of Affectation, and do not (which
is a thing very common, and much ap∣proved
of and prevalent among the Vul∣gar)
either ridicule, or proudly scoff at
and prosecute in Writing, those things
which  the Religion and

Manners of those Men, who are treated
of heren. Neither do I, though there
may be some among those very Persons,
who look with an evil Eye upon, and
bear ill will unto us, for that Reason,
retribute the same, and make the like
return unto them, as some are pleased
to do, who think such reciprocal doings
ought always to be. But seeing that it
many times so happens, that they who
write with such Moderation, are liable
to fall under I know not what Suspicion
of crack'd Credit from these Men, so as
that I found my self under a necessity
of seeking out for some Patronage and
Refuge-place upon this Account, I was
fully satisfied, I could meet with that
principally in you, Great Sir, who know
as well as any Man alive, what, amongst
such a multitude of Writers, and itch
of Writing, is most fit to be writ, what
an Historian's scope ought to be in such
a Work as this is, and over and above
that, what on the one hand Religion,
and what in the mean time also Nature
and the Power of Humanity require and
call for. And because I have fallen upon
this Head, I earnestly wish the Temper
of the present Times was not such, that
this were not the sad distinguishing mark
of the Age we live in, as that there
should be so many Men, such strangers

to and devoid of Charity and Modesty,
and hurried with that unruliness and
outrageousness of Mind, that as soon as
they discern any Heterodox Opinion in
matters of Religion, and especially if
any Heresie be smelt in the case, they
immediately suppose that it is the Pro∣perty
of Religion to scoff at, persecute,
and afflict such Men; some going so far
as to urge, there ought to be a precision
or a cutting off of the same, by violent
Methods, Fire and Sword, Imprison∣ment
and Bonds, Racks and Torments,
and even by the most dreadful and cruel
Deaths. For the Good and Peace of the
Church and State (for so they Argue)
cannot otherwise be preserved, nor the
Christian Faith and Humane Obligations
subsist. Were it not for this, we should not
see against so many Reformed Churches,
so many Hundred Thousand Christians,
such and so great and nefandous Vio∣lences
contrived and offered, such lamen∣table,
yea, unheard-of Calamities and
Slaughters, (and even if they could, make
entire Extirpation, Rulne, and Destru∣ction)
by those who go by the Names of
Christians and Catholicks, but are in
truth the most bitter and implacable Ene∣mies
of the True Religion. I'll go yet
further; I heartily wish there were not

sometimes amongst others, and even a∣mong
them, who have withdrawn them∣selves
from the Papacy, that immodera∣tion
of Spirit, that even where there is
no manner of Heresie, no Fundamental
Error, yea, not the least difference but
in words and way of Expression only,
mens Minds become forthwith divided
thereupon, an Interruption of Fellow∣ship,
and at last a sssion into Parties
doth ensue. And that those, who lay
these things to Heart, who shun them,
and who being mindful of Humane
Frailty, and of their Duty enjoyned
them by God, and being intent and build∣ing
upon the Lord Jesus Christ alone,
bear with such things as are to be born
with, and study to promote Peace and
Unity, and hate every Name of Di∣stinction
imposed by Man in the Church
of God, and desire neither to make nor
follow Parties, are branded as if they
were ignorant and slothful, having no
regard to their own Matters and Con∣cerns;
so far forth, as if to be indiffe∣rent,
and of neither Party, were become
now as it were a new Sect, and that Law
of Solon revived, who commanded him
to be punished, who in the time of Sedition
joined himself to neither Party. Which
sort of Men are  lovers

of themselves, puffed up, (as they are
called in Scripture) turbid, and boyl∣ing
hot (neither is this a Foreign Ap∣pellation,
but such as is also applyed to
them in the Sacred Code) when they
raise more Commotions about a thing of
nothing, than there are Storms in the
Aegean or most boisterous Seas; but here∣of
there is fully enough said to the wise,
but to you, Great Sir, too much. And
this I judge my self obliged further to
say, that perhaps there may be some,
who, having a just Esteem, and right
Judgment of this Work, would for the
further Estimation thereof, have me here
and there quote and set down in the
Margin of the Book, the Authorities and
Testimonies whereon I ground each Par∣ticular,
to which Persons seeing their
Conceptions hereon are not without Rea∣son,
I make this Answer, That if I should
not do it, I do not thereby swerve from
the usage of Historians in all Ages, nei∣ther
is there indeed any need that a Man
should gain a belief of what he offers,
this way, when he is not conscious to
himself of any falsity, and that there is
nothing that can derogate from or lessen
his Credit therein: Neither was I wil∣ling
in this Work, which I was desirous
should prove acceptable as much for the

Brevity as Truth of it, so without cea∣sing
to interrupt and break off the Thread
of my Story, or to disorder and delay
my Reader. But yet I do not always
omit such sort of Testimonies. But
otherwise I can be bold to affirm, that
there is nothing of any moment, through∣out
the whole Work, that hath not been
done in the face of the Sun, that is, ei∣ther
in the presence of Men, or in So∣lemn
Judicatories, even where there has
been no exclusion of the Populacy, and
such as has not been frequent in the
mouths of many, laid open by the chief
Magistrates, and Printed, for the Know∣lege
of such as were absent, and to per∣petuate
the same to Posterity; as for
other things, I take but little notice of
them, and if at any time I recount any
such, I do it in such a way as may gain
certain Credit: But no more of this; to
return therefore to you, Right Noble and
Great Sir. As to the Reason that induced
me to Present and Dedicate this my Trea∣tise
to Your Honour, it was this, That
there might remain some sort of Testi∣mony
upon Record, not so much of the
knowledge I have had of you, which is
as far backwards as I can remember, as
of the Favour you have always shewed
me, and of those Benefits you have made

it your Business to heap upon me both
at home and abroad, and which I have
deemed both Just and Honourable for
me to accept, being freely offered, and
by no means to reject, and withal of the
Gratitude, Propensity, and Devotedness
of my Mind towards you. And though
I have here a great Opportunity offered
to me to Celebrate your Vertues, yet I
shall forbear, lest I should incur the cen∣sure
either of being unskilful in Praises,
or what is base, the Name of Flatterer;
besides that your Name has long since
gained such Esteem, and is so Famous
among all, that it has no need of any
Encomiums and Embellishments of mine,
the things themselves bespeak it. For
to say nothing of the Endowments of
your Mind, as being such, though most
rare, especially in so propitious and a∣greeable
a Fortune, as are not conspicu∣ous
to all Men, and are more private;
those Famous Monuments that you have
partly published even in your blooming
Years, and which do yet in part lie hid
within the more secret and inner recesses
of your Study, which all of the Repub∣lick
of Learning that have seen or known
them, have so approved of, as to judge
them no ways inferiour to what hath been
extant of yours, but to deserve as much

you to the Protection of the Almighty,
praying to him, that while you Rule in
his Name, submit to and obey the Di∣vine
Majesty, he would heap upon you
more and more all manner of Spiritual
Blessings in Heavenly things in Christ Je∣sus,
and beg leave to subscribe my self
