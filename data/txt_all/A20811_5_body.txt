SIR, your owne naturall inclination to vertue, & your loue
to the Muses, assure mee of your kinde acceptance of my
dedication. It is seated by custome (from which wee are
now bolde to assume authoritie) to beare the names of our
friends vpon the fronts of our bookes, as Gentlemen vse to set
theyr Armes ouer theyr gates. Some say this vse beganne by the
Heroes and braue spirits of the old world, which were desirous
to bee thought to patronize learning; and men in requitall hoâˆ£nour
the names of those braue Princes. But I thinke some after,
put the names of great men in their bookes, for that men shoulde
say there was some thing good, onely because indeed their names
stoode there; But for mine owne part, (not to dissemble) I find no
such vertue in any of theyr great titles to doe so much for anie
thing of mine, and so let them passe. Take knowledge by this I
loue you, & in good faith, worthy of all loue I thinke you, which
I pray you may supply the place of further complement.
