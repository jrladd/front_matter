Sir,
THis Treatise, which five Years
since, I willingly Dedicated to
You in the French Idiome, is
now again presented to Your
self, replenished with many Observations
in the Latine Tongue: seeing that by the
great esteem of Your Name, our French
Edition was not only Candidly accepted
in France; but also in other Forreign
Nations among Learned Men: The
exceeding happy success of which, had
wrought in me an Admiration, had not
the fame of Your Transcendant Lear∣ning
made it Immortal, by your most

Learned Writings, known, and through∣ly
considered by me. You being so well
versed in all kind of Studies, that the
most Illustrious Ludovicus XIV, King of
France and Navarre, made You the Me∣caenas,
or Cherisher of most Learned men.
Since it is so, I may remember the for∣mer
Edition, and so much the rather, see∣ing
that the Heer Duyst van Voorhout, a
Man of an excellent Genious, made me
as certain of Your Peculiar Favours to∣wards
me, as Your own frequent Honou∣ring
me with your Epistles: Wherefore
with all Humility I crave, that even as
You protected the former Edition, under
the Shield of Your Authority, so You
would vouchsafe also to protect This. Sir,
The doing of which, will oblige him in
the highest Nature, who is, and will be,
during his Life, the Adorer of Your Re∣splendent
Name.
