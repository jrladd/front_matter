Honored Sir,
WHat the Macedonians said long since; (when after the death of King Philip, they saw his Son Alexander, succeeding no less to his Father's Virtue and Valour, than to his Crown and Kingdom;) That their Nation had lost nothing but the Body, not the Bravery of their Prince, nor chang'd its Monarch, but only the Man, (as Justin expresses it:) The antient Family of the Titchbourns (which hath continued successively famous in this Country, since the first coming in of the Saxons) may truly say at this present by a particular providence of Heaven; which depriving it of its worthy Sir Richard, hath supplyed his place with a Sir Henry (your no less worthy Self:) who suc∣ceeding
 as well to your parents Virtue, as to his Estate and Title; give us all, a most just and joyful occasion to confess, that we have thereby suffer'd no notable change or detriment; since the same spirit of Prudence and Discretion, which appear'd in the Predecessor, continues in the conduct and comportment of the Succes∣sor. And surely, they who have at any time been present, (And who would not wish to be present at so signal a Ceremony? Which I here mention amongst the many Examples of the Fathers and Sons paralell'd conformity, to eternize the deserved memory of so heroick a Charity:) at the great Dole, freely given to all far and near Commers, and annually distri∣buted upon the 25 of March, (as a Memo∣randum, I doubt not, of the eelestial bounty) upon that Day, in which the greatest Dole that e're was given, (the Bread, I mean, which Angels feed on,) was bestow'd from a∣bove on starv'd mankind; cannot but admi∣ringly behold so exact a correspondency of Or∣der, of Gravity, of Government, between him who formerly perform'd this pious action, and your Self who now prosecutes it; as that the change appears in nothing but in the Person, and the difference is only distinguishable by the Countenance. This little I have said, (and more I dare not, dreading the offence of your Modesty,) is chiefly in relation to Gods Praise
 and Honor, who is the bountiful Author and Bestower of all good Gifts and Blessings: For I well know, That your solid Humility suffers you not to Attribute to your self more of all the high Favours which Nature and Heaven have liberally heap'd upon you, than the bare obligation, which is thereby increased, of cor∣responding more diligently to your Duty; and, should I go about to give you the least share of the Glory, I should at once injure the divine Grace, and your Virtue. Wherefore to avoid the Censure of Indiscretion, and the Suspiti∣on of Flattery; and lest I should provoke you to indignation, upon pretence of seeking to please you; and finally, fearing that instead of offering you a Present, I might prepare for you a kind of Punishment: I will spare the la∣bour of running farther into the large field of your Praises, (which I plainly foresee would prove as irksome to your moderation and tem∣per, as it is unsutable to my custom and pro∣fession; and which indeed you would more un∣willingly permit, than I could easily perform:) Contenting my self only to mention what I may not well smother up in silence, as directly con∣ducing to the design of this Dedication: which is, That the consideration of your singular Piety to God, and sincere Devotion to the sa∣cred Virgin Mother, hath caus'd me to fix my eyes upon your worthy Person, as seeming most
 proper to patronize this small product of my pen, containing a Daily Exercise for all pi∣ous Christians, in order to a holy Life, and a happy Death;) both in regard of the sympa∣thy between its Precepts and your Practice; and also in hopes, that your propos'd Example, may prove to others a powerful Motive of bor∣rowing your imitation. Nor will I doubt of your favourable acceptance of these well meant endeavours: since what is defective in the Manner and fashion, is abundantly sup∣plied by the price and value of the Matter, by the profit and necessity of the Subject, and by the hearty and unfeigned affections of the Of∣ferer; who ceases not dayly to sollicite the di∣vine Goodness, that after a long continued Holy Life, you may finally arrive at a Hap∣py Death, which will be infallibly follow'd with the reward of an eternal Crown of Glo∣ry and Immortality.
Honored Sir,
