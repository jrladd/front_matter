I Did (sir) in this lame, but louing dedication, make it a questionable
controucsie, if an Author will, without prae-acquaintance (as I haue
done) respecting his duety and zeale, thrust forth a doubtfull worke
into a wise and well-deseruing patronage, whether the true-loue may
bee dispenced with, or the confidence taxed as a presumption: Sure I
am, if any indifferent Iudge respect my loue, hee will attribute this to
loues desire, and so my presumption must bee but well-meaning: Vltra
quid superest? Let the vaine mercenary rout of Bastard-poets rubbe an
abortiue Muse with hope of honourable benefactors; and sophisti∣cate
rich parts of Nature with most corrupting compounds of Syco∣phansie,
yet shall the more attractiue and pure iudgements haue (as
they euer had) a free election, Et prodesse, et delectare, without incurring
the name of Nice, deuided Opinionists. Let therefore Rockes and Moun∣taines
rise against mee, the boisterous and arrogant auncient Writers
gape wide vpon mee, if you shall reape the least true delight, and sa∣tis-factio,
I may bee proud aboue licence, and quietly repose, not wat∣ching
who dares assault the Fabricke; so confident I am of your free
Spirit: Sic &  verba Magistri: The worke (no doubt) is in it
selfe a worke  naked, yet neuer to bee amended, with beau∣tifll
and faire acceptance, praise and dispraise after Impression bee a∣like,
they do neither adde, not can detract from things simply considered,
so inherent is the name of Worke to each cor posure; but I can truely
say, your im-parl acceptance will make  a good worke to mee; E∣tiam
si  populus: Briefly then, to auoid prolixe Argument, in stead
of an Epistle, I may not inlarge my preambles with needlesse motiues,
dis-allowing the errors of all men, and fauourably conniue at my owne
heresies, seeming to detest lucre, &c. which deserue a tractate rather
then so compendious an Epistle which doth onely salute, say Fare-well,
And for my selfe thus much:
Nullus mihi expediuit suum 
Nec venter docuit verba conari.
