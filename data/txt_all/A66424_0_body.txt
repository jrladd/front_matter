MADAM,
IT was the Desire of our Deceased Friend, that I should Preach his Funeral Sermon; and it is at Your's that I now publish it. I am truly sensi∣ble that the design of both was to do some service to Religion, and to those that do survive. It being (as he well knew) one of the best Opportunities that we have for it, when we have, as it were, the Dead speaking to the Living, and the Occasion giving Life and Force to the Doctrine. And great pity it is, that this

should any where grow into disuse; and that the Good that might by such season∣able Discourses redound to the Souls of Men, too often gives way to the Pomp of the Funeral. We all have a Loss by the Death of our Deceased Friend; the Church, his Auditory, and his Ac∣quaintance; but more especially You, and the Branches derived from both. It is a Loss that only the Father of all Mer∣cies, and God of all Comfort, can support You under; and to Him I commit You, who has promised that all things shall work together for good to them that love God. I am,
MADAM,
