MADAM,
I Cannot but be mindful of you also in the pub∣lishing of my se∣veral Treatises.
Your gracious carriage and good report which you have a∣mong good and gracious peo∣ple;
and your exemplary for∣wardness to come to our Le∣ctures when they were up; and the great respect which I have, and fervent love which I bear to your Noble Family, since I came first acquainted with it, hath in a manner constrained me so to do, and by name to de∣dicate unto you these Soul-so∣lacing Conferences with Christ which I have penn'd, and up∣on the earnest request of others published, for the good of all such gracious souls as do desire no better talk than such as is contained in one of these Books, and doubtless is most pleasing to Christ. Christ you know did soon draw near to
those
Luk. 24.15. Emauntish Pilgrims, who did but talk of him; and therefore much more will not be far from us also, if we shall not only talk so of him, but al∣so with him; especially when he shall see that we do most heartily desire to see the death of our sins, and to live above this vile and evil world, as Conqueror of it, and not con∣quered by it. Oh! that doth his very heart good; and there∣fore how? Oh how should we confer and talk, and commune with him about it even day and night, that we may oppose it with all our might, prosper∣ing and prevailing against it to our souls delight?

Madam, Christ will be ex∣ceeding glad of our talk, if we shall so talk with him, as here we are taught of the con∣quest of this world, that we may reign with him in the o∣ther world.
His heavenly Highness therefore gives us hearts to speak as we ought to speak, that after we have spoken with him here, we may be spoken unto, by him hereafter, to triumph with him for ever.
So prayeth
