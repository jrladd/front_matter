RIght Honourable and graue Senators, the bles∣sed and peaceful entrance into this land, and ioyfull possession of our Leige Lord, of his immediate right of the Imperiall crowne of England, and the vtter banishment of all doubt in the Regall succession, with the vniuersall hearts applause of all his Highnesse English subiects, who with one consent acknowledged their loue and dutie vnto his lawfull right in Soueraigntie, all which in the speedy effecting and establishing of peace in this kingdome was much more then either our neigh∣bour Nations held possible to bee so easily perfor∣med,

A appeared by their great admiration vp∣on the certaine knowledge thereof, or was right∣ly vnderstood of the multitude that wholly en∣ioyes the benefite, as too plainely appeareth by their wilful ingratitude & forgetfulnes, seeing their long continued feare so quickely supprest, and be∣yond all expectation conuerted into as great free∣dome and tranquilitie, as either their hearts could wish, or is enioyed by any other nation. All these, and many other high blessings of Almightie God still succeeded one another, & no man would once hold vp his finger to make present acknowledge∣ment or publicke vnderstanding vnto posterities, of the boundlesse and wondrous workes of God in these our daies, as also of the manifold remark∣able accidents which haue happened of late yeares.
These motiues, I say, with the earnest perswasi∣ons of diuers graue and honourable personages, who neuer ceased to accite mee vnto this present Act of Chronologie, haue directly caused mee to performe this generall businesse, in which my te∣dious labours I haue been intollerably abused and scandalized by Thraso, Momus, Zoylus, and other backebiters, & detractors: concerning whom, sith it is the least of offences to offend offenders, I will nei∣ther vexe my selfe, nor trouble your patience in seeking to please the enuious and insatiate. But forasmuch as I highly prize the good content of the honest, wise, and vertuous, thus was the course and manner of my proceeding herein.
After I had well obserued, that no man would

lend a helping hand vnto the late aged painefull chronicler: neither in many moneths after his death, that any would expose or shewe themselues to prosecute so good a worke: and albeit that in this interim, & before, there were many named to haue already entred into this Labyrinth, yet not one appeared: whereupon I remembred the say∣ing of the Philosopher: That the naming of many friends, is a maine impediment vnto friendship. And as in that, so in this; then for my own cleare satisfacti∣on, & full assurance, that I would neither preiudice nor preuent any others better proceeding, I ente∣red into particular conference with euery man whose names had beene diuulged. Some of them of honourable rancke and reuerent qualitie: all of them learned, & of good sufficiency, some where∣of answered me, they thought that the giuing out of their names in this sort, was rather done by their secret enemies, of purpose to draw them into ca∣pitall displeasure, and to bring their names & liues into a generall question, then for any other intent of good: other saide, who doth this worke, must flatter, which I cannot, neither will I wilfully leaue a scandall vnto my posteritie. Another said, I can∣not see how in any ciuil action a man should spend his trauell, time & mony worse, then in that which acquires no regard, nor reward, except backebi∣ting & detraction. And one amongst the rest after he had sworne an oath, saide: I thanke God that I am not yet madde, to wast my time, spend two hundred pound a yeare, trouble my selfe, & all my friends, onely to gaine assurance of endlesse re∣proch,

losse of libertie, and bring all my dayes in question: & like as these spake, so did many others. And in conclusion, I sawe it vtterly refused of all. And by this time it was generally obserued, that this worke was wholly neglected. Then many of my friends began againe to animate me, and very seriously required me to make supplement: whose kinde perswasions preuailed so farre, that I promi∣sed them to doe my indeuour, onely for one yeares space, wherein my good will exceeded my best ex∣perience, as I found afterwards, for that it is not a yeare or two wherein a man may obtaine the par∣ticularities of truth, neither accomplish any thing to the effect in this solide and variable im∣ploiment. Then forthwith I repaired to the most honourable superiours, vnto whom I humbly sig∣nified my zealous loue, dutie, and diligence in this generall seruice of my Prince and Country. Of whom I receiued very gracious incouragement, & honorable instructions. And after that, vpon con∣ference with diuers graue Elders, louers of vertue, and fauourers of the Cities honour, by whose di∣rection, with all meekenesse I manifested my wil∣lingnesse vnto the Lord Maior, and Court of Al∣dermen, being then resolued, neither to breake my former promise, nor to neglect so great and gene∣rall a good for any deprauing speeches, or maleuo∣lent aspects, with all integritie; since which time I haue spent in this busines sixteene yeares without any great cause of encouragement. May it there∣fore please your wisedomes rightly to vnderstand that in all my proceedings I haue neither presu∣med

too farre of my selfe, nor done ought that might discourage, or preuent any other. And thus much for the cause and maner of my proceeding.
Now right honourable, and most worthy El∣ders, whose state and gouernment is renowned through the world: what is hee that hath any vn∣derstanding, and knowes not London to bee the most flourishing and peacefull Cittie of Europe? of greatest antiquitie, happiest in countinuance, most increased, chiefe in prosperitie, and most sto∣red with plentie? and here I might alleadge many ancient presidents of pleasures, profits, time, and state, whereof neuer any subordinate Magistrates could equall yours. But seeing few wordes to the wise suffice, I will onely speake a word or two by the way. The promised blessing vnto the an∣cient Israelites to possesse a land that flowed with milke and hony, is with seuen fold measure heaped on your heads, your citty filled more aboundantly with all sorts of silkes, fine linnen, oyles, wines, and spices, perfection of Arts, & all costly ornaments, and curious workemanship, then any other Pro∣uince: so as London well deserues to beare the name of the choicest storehouse in the world, and to keepe ranke with any royall Cittie in Europe: her Cittizens rich and bounteous, witnesse their franke-giuing of more then twice seuen fifteens in one yeare, and their long continued charges and expence, as well vpon all occasions by sea and land for defence of their Prince and Country, as in ayding and relieuing their distressed neighbour Nations, and in performing many other worthy

matters for their owne honour, the delight of strangers, and the reliefe of the poore, as other∣wise: so as without offence it may truely be said, that the liberalitie of the Londoners, is but halfe knowne to their common friends. Peace and plen∣ty in the highest degree possesseth now your gates and pallaces: all nations repaire with willingnesse to bee partakers of your happinesse: many other glorious Cities haue many waies wanted these in∣cessant blessings: witnesse the famous Citie Rome, which hath beene often spoiled and sacked: the Ci∣ty Mosco, which not long since was twice spoiled with fire, the first by her enemies, the last was a priuate politicke practise of her owne Emperour. The like misfortune hath befallen vnto the great Cittie Constantinople. Stately Antwerpe hath felt the smart of diuers changes within mans memo∣ry. Populous Paris of late yeares was glad to beat downe her owne Suburbs, and cut her skirts shor∣ter, least other should sit vpon them: Cracouia, Lishbon, and many other royall Citties were glad and faine to seeke and sue for that which is freely giuen vnto her. These last haue I cited to bee as a looking-glasse to London; sith it is as impossible for any to know their proper face & feature with∣out an obiect, as it is for any people to bee truely sensible of their owne felicirie, that haue not seene nor tasted others misery.
And thus (right Honourable and graue Fathers) although it was my meaning to haue vsed breuity, yet being inforced to the contrary, I craue your pardon, least I haue offended by prolixitie. And

because I will for euer be exempt, and free from all danger of all precurrant vipers, lurking Adders, and venemous tongues, I here conclude, with ten∣der of my loue, and the continuance of a double prentiship, not onely of these my free offered la∣bours in this Abridgement, but also my larger Booke, the which I likewise recōmend vnto your kind acceptation, hauing as well formerly as at this present proclaimed a cessation from any fur∣ther supplement or continuance of the generall English Chronicle, to the end they might and shall for euer be truely vnderstood, that I haue no cohe∣rence with the enuious who neuer did good them∣selues nor speake well of others, being euer desi∣rous to doe my best to auoide all impediments that may any way impeach others better pro∣ceedings, wishing you all encrease of your hearts desire, and euerlasting hap∣pinesse.
