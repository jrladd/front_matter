MY LORD,
IF I durst print a Booke, no que∣stion I durst not thinke of any other Patron
 then your Lordship, to whom, by all the ingage∣ments of preferment, fa∣vour, gratitude, duty, and domestick service, I stand so strictly oblig'd; to whom should the Booke belong, but to him to whom the Author?1 Cor. 9. Doth any man plant a tree, and not eat of the fruit? Your Lord∣ship hath both planted, and watred; the fruite therefore (such as it is sower Grapes) I heere humbly present your Lord∣ship with, to whom by yet further, and more speciall
 interests it owes it selfe; These Meditations (my Lord) they were the ex∣pence of those weary houres of that slowe recovery, which (I must confesse) next to Gods, I had by your Lordships special care, and furtherance, out of that my late, long, and hopelesse sicknesse, so that it were a kinde of theft to make ten∣der to any other of the im∣ployment of those houres, which I then but borrowed from your Lordsh ps more publique service: your Lordship must here there∣fore
 expect rather sickly thoughts, then serious stu∣dies, and so, if neither margent-throng'd with Au∣thors, nor Method-bound with Art, the proverbe will plead pardon, Thoughts are free; nor indeede is it but of the nature of this kinde of writing, rather to touch, then presse; to dis¦play, then discusse the subiect.
Why I make not my Epistle Dedicatory (to the custome) laudatory, your Lordships resolu'd declina∣tion of such kind of cheape,
 hackny fly-blowne fame, may be cause enough; such as are so happy as to know you, know well enough how little you neede it, how lesse you love it: besides, 'twould be thought (being a servant) I durst doe no other, and necessitas nec habet legem, nec lau∣dem, nor law, nor laud.
Why I make this my vnlabour'd pastime of thinking, thus venturous∣ly publique, as (I must confsse) it was not that commonly pretended md∣wife of the pesse, impor∣tunity
 of friends; so, much lesse was it any over∣weening opinion of the worth, but next to Gods glory, and your Lordships service, the causes are these two; in the first place the vindication (as much as in me lyes) of our Reli∣gion from that common brand which her Romish adversaries so frequently vpbrayd her with, that she spends all her devotion on the Pulpit, and keepes nne for the Closet; in the next place, a prebable an∣ticipation (by these) of the
 worlds entertainment of any my possible endeavours hereafter; which when ever, they shall (as these) together with their Au∣thor, in all humility be layd at your Lordships feete: by
