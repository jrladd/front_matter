Sir,
YOUR friends (which were present at the Ser∣mon which I preached at your aged Fathers Fu∣nerall) comparing what I had said of him, of my owne particular know∣ledg, with those expressions of your
affection (which they had formerly apprehended from you) were verily perswaded that the Sermon would have made a very gracefull sound in your eares: and Sir, what with their incessant importunitie and the sence that I have of my obligation to you, I am bold to present you with it, that so I may represent him to your thoughts, in whose precious mem∣ory you may so far delight your self, that through his reverend antiquitie and goodness he was the Glory and Comfort of the Country round a∣bout him; as for my part, I took my acquaintance with him as a blessing from God; and thus much I may say as in the sight of God, that when ever I went to visit him (as I was by a strange and extraordinary motion excited to doe it frequently) what through the
observation of his outward and in∣ward forme, I had the thoughts of faithfull Abraham renued upon my spirit; so that (to speak the truth) I loved him in the truth, and not I on∣ly,
2 John 1. but also al they that have known the truth, as St. John speakes of the Elect Lady: I confess Sir the piece of work (which I presume to tender to your acceptance) is but leane and dry and unfit to abide the test of your Judicious Eye; yet Sir, give me leave to hope that as the reviving of his memorie (from whose loynes you sprang) was part of my aime in this, so the very mention of his Worth may somewhat coun∣terpoyze its imperfection; and this hope I do also feed my self withal, that I deserve not your displeasure in mak∣ing hast to please you. But this is that
which I also feare, that your candid disposition (which knows not to give any other than a favorable interpre∣tation) will not let me understand my errors; however Sir, I beseech you, where ever you do discry them know them to be rather the errors of love, not any love of errors. I blesse God, whatever weakness of mine may appear to a criticall eye, the sincerity of my desire is in this, (as in all others the indeavors of my profession) that I may be instrumen∣tal to the glory of God in the building up of Men in the Faith and Fear of His Name; and to this purpose I had rather be the meanest vessel in His Sanctuary, than sit equall in glory to the greatest Potentate, I had ra∣ther be of use to the adding (though it be but a litle Goates hair) to the
building of the Temple, than have al the affluence of the Earth added to my Estate, for though the Calamities of this inferior world may Eclipse the external lustre of my profession, Yet, I question not, but if the almighty shal deigne me the * , or help of his holy spirit either towards the redu∣cing of any of the lost Sons of Adam,
2 Cor. 6.1. or towards the confirmation of any of the Saints in their most holy Faith, I may shine as the Stars for ever and ever. And as we in our profession,
Dan. 12 3. are consecrate to such spiritual and eternal purposes so I desire in this pre∣sent work of mine to drive on such a design; If therefore (Sir) by this slen∣der oblation of mine together with the example of your worthy Father (whom I have proposed to your imi∣tation)
you shal so recount with your self the returne of the Body of Abra∣ham (that great Patriarch and friend of God) to the dust of the Earth, and the sweet and peaceable resignation of his Soul into the hands of his God, and if you shal also so far recal to mind his being gathered to his People in Heaven as lightly to esteeme of the vanity of this transitory life and more and more to prize the Rock of your Salvation the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only new and living way to the new Jerusalem and Bosome of Abra∣ham, then shall I attaine my most am∣bitious aimes, who am,
Sir,
