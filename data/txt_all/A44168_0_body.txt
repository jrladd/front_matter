TIs the Honour of our Established Church to carry the demonstra∣tion
of the best and happiest Constitution in the World; whose
Articles are sound, Canons and Discipline easy; whose Sacraments
are of our Lords own appointing; whose Ceremonies are but few, and those
Decent; whose Orders are Apostolical, and Guardians watchful; whose
Prayers are truly Divine, and Preaching from the Word of God, not
from the Whims or Policies of Men; this Church, admired by the Learned,
even amongst its Enemies, desired and prayed for by all the truly Pious
abroad, despised and neglected at home only thro' the Prejudice and great
Ʋnhappiness of Education in some, and Willful Ignorance in others; this
Church, you now are become Members of, at your Earnest desire, & (as I
thank God, I have very good Reason to hope) after a due preparation. As
for this Discourse, tis properly yours; twas prepared for you, and that with
a Plainess answering the Honesty and Importunity which you discovered
in your Request, both to understand and enjoy this holy Sacrament. And
thus to do, I found convenient, if not necessary, and to me very tempting; not
only as a Curate conversant with people, who (blessed be God) have had
the good Effect of convincing and informing some, who thought themselves
Wise: But because also of those odd Notions and strange Enthusiastick
Fancies, which you formerly were, and others stil are teized and exercised
with, from their unteaching Guides; which instead of Comfort, have im∣proved
to the Ruin of their Proselytes. Among the many proofs of this,

that sad story of the dearest Relation of one of you, will not yet be forgot∣ten;
who under great perplexity of thoughts from some strange Doctrines
amazing and disturbing him, when he apply'd himself to his Teacher to
instruct and assist him, that he might find Peace and Comfort, receiv'd
from him only this Answer, Go Home, and get Faith. Which was
so far from easing his Troubled Mind, that he immediately fell distra∣cted,
was obliged to be lyed and Bound in his Bed, and lived about a Week
in that dreadful condition, and then was relieved only by Death.
But our Church, as it has no such Ʋnintelligible Distracting Notions,
nor Ʋnmerciful Tyranizing Discipline; so you receive this, containing
the true Christian Doctrine of it; discovering the Bowels of the Mercy
and Love of our blessed Saviour, the Head of it; and Published at the
Request of you, and your chosen Witnesses, I hope for your Benefit, and the
Benefit of those who are yet Ignorant of the Excellencies of now your
Church, and misled by Crafty and Designing Men.
And therefore, as when Instructing you, so in this Sermon, I attended
to the most easy, familiar, and aptest Expressions to inform you; using in
Comments and Expositions, the best Authors, and sometimes also (because
I could not do better) their own words; Endeavouring to keep true to the
Orders, and excellent Doctrine of our Church, as every Faithful and
Honest Man ought to do.
That the Honour of God, and Interest of the Church, might be advan∣ced,
and that you and others may be bettered by this, and at last all our
Souls Saved, is the Prayer of,
