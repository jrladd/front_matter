RIGHT WORSHIPFULL,
BY the appointment, and in the presence of
some of you was this Sermon preached. And
at the like request it is now published toge∣ther
with an addition of a Supplement to
the Applicatorie part, which was then
through straitnesse of time left imperfect.
My ayme in both was, and is to promote
the publique service of the Kingdome, and in particular the ser∣vice
of that day. If herein I have not done what haply some
would have had me, by speaking their conceptions, I would
have them and the world know, I have done what I concei∣ved
most expedient for the promoting of the service which
then I was put upon, and (as far as I apprehend) the great de∣signe
of the Kingdome. That I have herein concealed my own
private judgement in the point of Church Government, It is not
because I am afraid or ashamed to give account of it, but only

that I might not by an unseasonable anticipation of the judge∣ment
of that venerable Assembly now convened for the deciding
and stating of that controversie, both render my selfe seeming∣ly
presumptious, and lay blocks in my own way, by sowing of
scruples, which my worke was to remove and pull up. What
successe God was pleased to give unto my poore labours at
that time, some of you are witnesses. My hopes are, that
being not altogether unsuccessefull in the hearing, they may
prove not wholy unusefull in the reading. Such as they are,
I presume to put them into your hands; laying both them and
my selfe at the Churches feet.
