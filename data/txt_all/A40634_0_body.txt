Dear Son,
A Little while since we parted with our Dear Sam, never to see each other more un∣til the glorious Day of the Resurrection. Those smart Expressions that frequent∣ly drop'd from him (beyond any that I ever yet knew of his Age) were no small joy to me while he liv'd, in hope that he might have
 been eminently useful when grown up to Years, and shapen'd by Education, and will make him live to me, tho dead, without carrying any of his Ashes about me (as Iphicrates did of his dead Son) to perpetuate his Memory. I hope you will not easily forget him who was (as you usually said) so lovely in your Eye, and so much beloved by you, much less his latter end; (there was that in it wor∣thy of your remembrance) and least of all your own
 Death, so much confirm'd by his; he came last into the World, but is first gone out; as of the two Disciples that ran to the Sepulchre, the youngest came there first, but the other followed af∣ter him.
I made an Epistle De∣dicatory long before he di∣ed, that contained some∣thing relating to you both; but should I publish it, it might appear as great a mistake in the excess to de∣dicate an Epistle to two Sons, when but one is li∣ving,
 as that of Apollo∣nius was in the defect, when he saluted Decimus by the name of Quintus, and to my self an act of Cruelty, Mezentius-like, thus to tye the Living to the Dead; therefore have resolved not to do it.
The time of my Conti∣nuance in this World can∣not be long, yours may be longer, but it is best not to think so; and therefore do all the good you can. These following Directions are given in order to it, and
 may, if diligently observ'd, assist you in it.
I would not be as a Mercury's Statue, to di∣rect only, and not move; nor as the Crab in the Fa∣ble, that advis'd her young ones to go forward, whilst she her self went backward; therefore desire to carry them about me, with An∣toninus  his Title things, for my self, and to be a Practicer of what to you I am an Instructer; that I may say to you, as Gide∣on to his Souldiers, Look
 on me, and do likewise: and hope that will reach Indè pasco, undè pas∣cor, Inde tibi appono undè ego nivo. your Heart that comes from the Heart of
Bath,
Decem∣ber 8. 1682.
