My LORD,
PResuming it as acceptable from the Press, as pleasing in the Pulpit; I humbly Dedicate the following Discourse to Your Honour: Both, in Gratitude for Your Manifold Favours towards
me; and as a Specimen of the high Value and Esteem all have for You, (being as Good, as Great; and no less an Ornament to the Chair, than That an Honour to You.)
May it be as Profitable, as Seaso∣nable; and but in the least Mea∣sure promote True Piety, which I have therein endeavoured to Ad∣vance: Then shall I have the ut∣most intended, or designed, by
Your LORDSHIPS,
