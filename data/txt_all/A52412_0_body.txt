My Lord,
YOur Lordships Learning
and Knowledge in Mat∣ters
of Religion, and Sincerity
in the Belief and Profession of
its Sacred Articles are both so
well known, that I cannot be
supposed to Present this Book
to your Lordship with a De∣sign
to instruct you in the For∣mer,
or to Settle and Confirm
you in the Latter. There are
indeed but too many in the
World to whom it may be
necessary upon those Accounts,
but all that I intend in refe∣rence

to your Lordship by it
is only to express my Reve∣rence
and Respect for your
great Worth and Goodness,
and my grateful Acknowledg∣ments
for that particular Share
and Interest I have had in
your Favours.
Which give me further Oc∣casion
to hope that you will
be as kind to the Book a you
have been to the Author, and
that as you were pleas'd to
incourage the Undertaking,
so you will now favour the
Performance, which with all
deference and Submission is
humbly presented to your
Lordship by
My Lord,
