SPondanus, one of the most desertfull Com∣mentars
of Homer, cals all sorts of all men
learned to be iudicial beholders of this more
then Artificiall and no lesse then Diuine
Rapture; then which nothing can be ima∣gined
more full of soule and humaine extra∣ction:
for what is here prefigurde by our mi∣raculous
Artist, but the vniuersall world, which being so spati∣ous
and almost vnmeasurable, one circlet of a Shield representes
and imbraceth? In it heauen turnes, the starres shine, the earth
is enflowred, the sea swelles and rageth, Citties are built: one in
the happinesse and sweetnesse of peace, the other in open warre &
the terrors of ambush &c. And all these so liuely proposde, as not
without reason many in times past haue belieued, that all these
thinges haue in them a kind of voluntarie motion: euen as those
Tripods of Vulcan, and that Dedalian Venus ;
nor can I be resolu'd that their opinions be sufficiently refuted by
Aristonicus, for so are all things here described, by our diuinest
Poet, as if they consisted not of hard and solid mettals, but of a
truely, liuing, and mouing soule: The ground of his inuention
he shews out of Eustathius: intending by the Orbiguitie of the
Shield, the roundnesse of the world: by the foure mettalles, the
foure elementes: viz. by gold fire: by brasse earth for the hard∣nes:
by Tinne water, for the softnes, and inclination to fluxure:

by siluer, Aire, for the grosnes & obscuritie of the mettal before it
be refind. That which he cals , he vnder∣stands
the Zodiack, which is said to be triple for the latitude it cō∣tains,
& shining by reason of the perpetual course of the Sun made
in that circle, by  the Axletree, about which
heauē hath his motion &c. Nor do I deny (saith Spondanus) E∣neas
arms to be forged, with an exceeding height of wit by Virgil,
but comparde with these of Homer, they are nothing. And this
is it (most honorde) that maketh me thus sodainely translate this
Shield of Achilles, for since my publication of the other seuen
bookes, comparison hath beene made betweene Virgill and Ho∣mer:
who can be comparde in nothing with more decysall & cut∣ting
of all argument, then in these two Shieldes; and whosoeuer
shall reade Homer throughly and worthily, will know the que∣stion
comes from a superficiall and too vnripe a reader: for Ho∣mers
Poems were writ from a free furie, an absolute & full soule:
Virgils out of a courtly, laborious, and altogether imitatorie spi∣rit:
not a Simile hee hath but is Homers: not an inuention,
person, or disposition, but is wholly or originally built vpon Ho∣mericall
foundations, and in many places hath the verie wordes
Homer vseth: besides, where Virgill hath had no more plen∣tifull
and liberall a wit, then to frame twelue imperfect bookes of
the troubles and trauailes of Aeneas: Homer hath of as little
subiect finisht eight & fortie perfect: and that the triuiall obiecti∣on
may be answerd, that not the number of bookes, but the nature
and excellence of the worke commends it: All Homers bookes
are such as haue beene presidents euer since of all sortes of Poems:
imitating none, nor euer worthily imitated of any: yet would I
not be thought so ill created as to bee a malicious detracter of so
admired a Poet as Virgill, but a true iustifier of Homer, who
must not bee read for a few lynes with leaues turned ouer capri∣chiously
in dismembred fractions, but throughout; the whole

drift, weight & height of his workes set before the apprehsiue eyes
of his iudge. The maiestie he enthrones and the spirit he infuseth
into the scope of his worke so farre outshining Virgill, that his
skirmishes are but meere scramblings of boyes to Homers; the
silken body of Virgils muse curiously arest in guilt and embrode∣red
siluer, but Homers in plaine massie and vnualued gold: not
onely all learning, gouernment, and wisedome being deduc't as
from a bottomlesse fountaine from him; but all wit, elegancie, dis∣position
and iudgement.  &c.
Homer (saith Plato) was the Prince and maister of all pray∣ses
and vertues: the Emperour of wise men: an host of men a∣gainst
any deprauer in any principle he held. All the ancient and
lately learned haue had him in equall estimation. And for anie
to be now contrarilie affected, it must needes proceed from a meere
want onnesse of witte: an Idle vnthriftie spirit: wilfull because
they may choose whether they will think otherwise or not, & haue
power and fortune enough to liue like true men without truth, or
els they must presume of puritanicall inspiration, to haue that
with delicacie & squemishnes, which others with as good means,
ten times more time, and ten thousand times more labour could
neuer conceiue. But some will conuey their imperfections vnder
his Greeke Shield, and from thence bestowe bitter arrowes a∣gainst
the traduction, affirming their want of admiration grows
from defect of our language, not able to expresse the coppie and
elegancie of the originall: but this easie and traditionall pre∣text
hides them not enough: for how full of height and round∣nesse
soeuer Greeke be aboue English, yet is there no depth of con∣conceipt
triumphing in it, but as in a meere admirer it may bee
imagined; so in a sufficient translator it may be exprest. And Ho∣mer
that hath his chiefe holinesse of estimation, for matter and
instruction, would scorne to haue his supreame worthinesse glo∣sing
in his courtshippe and priuiledge of tongue. And if Italian,

French & Spanish, haue not made it daintie, nor thought it any
presumption to turne him into their languages, but a fit and ho∣norable
labour and (in respect of their countries profit and their
poesies credit) ost necessarie, what curious, proud, and poore
shamefastnesse should let an English muse to traduce him, when
the language she workes withall is more conformable, fluent, and
expressiue; which I would your Lordship would commaunde mee
to proue against all our whippers of their owne complement in
their countries dialect.
O what peeuish ingratitude and most vnreasonable scorne of
our selues we commit, to bee so extrauagant and forreignely wit∣ted,
to honour and imitate that in a strange tongue, which wee
condemne and contemne in our natiue? for if the substance of
the Poets will be exprest and his sentence and sence rendred with
truth and elocution, hee that takes iudiciall pleasure in him in
Greeke, cannot beare so rough a browe to him in English, to en∣tombe
his acceptance in austeritie.
But thou soule-blind Scalliger, that neuer hadst any thing but
place, time and termes, to paint thy proficiencie in learning, nor
euer writest any thing of thine owne impotent braine, but thy
onely impalsied diminution of Homer (which I may sweare was
the absolute inspiration of thine owne ridiculous Genius) neuer
didst thou more palpably damn thy drossy spirit in al thy all coun∣tries-exploded
filcheries, which are so grossely illiterate, that no
man will vouchsafe their refutation, then in thy sencelesse repre∣hensions
of Homer; whose spirit flew asmuch aboue thy groue∣ling
capacitie, as heauen moues aboue Barathrum: but as none
will vouchsafe repetition nor answere of thy other vnmanly foo∣leries:
no more will I of these, my Epistle being too tedious to your
Lo: besides, and no mans iudgement seruing better, (if your
high affaires could admit their diligent perusall) then your Lo:
to refute and reiect him. But alas Homer is not now to bee lift

vp by my weake arme, more then he is now deprest by more fee∣ble
oppositions, if any feele not their conceiptes so rauisht with the
eminent beauties of his ascentiall muse, as the greatest men of all
sorts and of all ages haue beene. Their most modest course is, (vn∣lesse
they will be powerfully insolent) to ascribe the defect to their
apprehension, because they read him but sleightly, not in his sur∣mised
frugalitie of obiect, that really and most feastfully powres
out himselfe in right diuine occasion. But the chiefe and vnan∣swerable
meane to his generall and iust acceptance, must be your
Lo. high and of all men expected president, without which hee
must like a poore snayle, pull in his English hornes, that out of all
other languages (in regard of the countries affection, and royal∣tie
of his Patrones) hath appeard like an Angell from a clowde,
or the world out of Chaos. When no language can make compari∣son
of him with ours if he be worthily conuerted; wherein before
he should haue beene borne so lame and defectiue, as the French
midwife hath brought him forth, he had neuer made questiō how
your Lo. would accept him: and yet haue two of their Kings, em∣braced
him, as a wealthy ornament to their studies, and the main
battayle of their armies.
If then your bountie would do me but the grace to conferre my
vnhappie labours with theirs so successefull & commended (your
iudgement seruing you much better then your leysure & yet your
leisure in thinges honourable being to bee inforced by your iudge∣ment)
no malitious & dishonorable whisperer, that comes armed
with an army of authority and state against harmeles & armeles
vertue, could wrest your wonted impression so much from it self, to
reiect (with imitation of tiranous contempt any affection so zea∣lous
& able in this kind to honor your estate as mine. Onely kings
& princes haue been Homers Patrones, amongst whom Ptolo∣mie
wold say, he that had sleight handes to entertayne Homer,
had as sleight braines to rule his common wealth. And an vsuall

seueritie he vsed, but a most rationall (how precise and ridiculous
soeuer it may seeme to men made of ridiculous matter) that in
reuerence of the pietie and perfect humanitie he taught; whosoe∣uer
writ or committed any proud detraction against Homer (as
euen so much a man wanted not his malitious deprauers) hee put
him with torments to extreamest death. O high and magically
raysed prospect, from whence a true eye may see meanes to the ab∣solute
redresse, or much to be wished extenuation, of all the vn∣manly
degeneracies now tyranysing amongst vs: for if that which
teacheth happinesse and hath vnpainefull corosiues in it, (being
entertayned and obserued) to eate out the hart of that raging vl∣cer,
which like a Lernean Fen of corruption furnaceth the v∣niuersall
sighes and complaintes, of this transposed world; were
seriously, and as with armed garrisons defended and hartned; that
which engenders & disperseth, that wilfull pestilence, would bee
purged and extirpate: but that which teacheth, being ouerturned,
that which is taught is consequently subiect to euersion: and if the
honour, happinesse and preseruation of true humanitie consist in
obseruing the lawes fit for mans dignitie; and that the elaborate
prescription of those lawes must of necessitie be authorised, fauou∣red
and defended before any obseruation can succeed: is it vnrea∣sonable,
to punish the contempt of that mouing prescription with
one mans death, when at the heeles of it followes common neglect
of obseruation, and in the necke of it, an vniuersall ruine? This
my Lord I enforce only to interrupt in others that may reade this
vnsauorie stuffe, the too open mouthd damnation of royall & ver∣tuous
Ptolomies seueritie. For to digest, transforme and sweat
a mans soule into rules and attractions to societie; such as are fa∣shiond
and temperd with her exact and long laborde contention
of studie; in which she tosseth with her impertiall discourse before
her, all cause of fantasticall obiections and reproofes; and without
which she were as wise as the greatest number of detractors that

shall presume to censure her; and yet by their flash and insolent ca∣stigations
to bee sleighted and turnde ouer their miserably vaine
tongues in an instant; is an iniurie worthy no lesse penaltie then
Ptolomie inflicted. To take away the heeles of which running
prophanation. I hope your Lo. honourable countenance will be as
the Vnicorns horne, to leade the way to English Homers yet poy∣soned
fountaine: for till that fauour be vouchsafed, the herde will
neuer drinke, since the venemous galles of some of their fellowes
haue infected it, whom alas I pittie. Thus confidently affirming
your name and dignities shall neuer bee more honored in a poore
booke then in English Homer, I cease to afflict your Lordshippe
with my tedious dedicatories, and to still sacred Homers spirit
through a language so fitte and so fauourles; humbly presenting
your Achilleian vertues with Achilles Shield; wishing
as it is much more admirable and diuine, so it
were as many times more rich, then the
Shield the Cardinall pawnd
at Anwerp.
