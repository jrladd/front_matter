SWeet Lady looke & grant this begd-for-grace,
My seruile Muse doth craue vpon her knees,
Now here she comes before thy sacred face,
And of her Labours makes a sacrifees,
Then ouer-spread them with thy glorious eyes,
Let luster faire inritch my rurall rime,
Thou hast the power (great Potent) if thou plees,
To register my verse in endlesse time,
If quicknes of thy wit finde any crime,
In thy discretion sepulchrize my wrong,
For why thou know'st my Muse in youthfull prime
Did what she could to please thee in her song:
Great is the glory of my wish'd-for-gaines,
If deerest Dame, thou patronize my paines.
