Honourable Sir:
TO immitate the common methode of Epistolizers in this kinde, were ra∣ther to write of you, then to you, which course though I affect not, J cannot altogether neglect, though I shall thereby either wrong you, or my selfe; for in publishing (though sparing∣ly)

my knowledge of your worth to the world, such, to whom you are vnknowne will so much iniure mee, as to taxe me with (what I condemne in others) flatterie; whereas some (to whom you are no stranger) will censure mee as much on the cōtrary to haue dealt with you rather, according to the pouertie of my abilitie, then to the fulnesse of your merite.
Jt will peraduenture seeme strange vnto you (if this poore worke chance to come to your view) what assurance of your good acceptance begot such pre∣sumption in me as to dedicate the same vnto you. J must first answere, I haue not done it mercenarily; for then I would haue presented it to your hand: nor vaine-gloriously; for then I would either haue craued your allowance, or subscribed my name; but freely and ho∣nestly

out of that respect which I owe to that innate Goodnesse which I know to be in you. Though I forbeare (out of some respects) to haue my name publi∣shed; yet I can acknowledge the Booke to be mine without blushing. If it bee (by anie) ill digested, the fault must be in the taker not in the Author: it was written with a right hand, and I wish it may not bee sinisterly intertained by any; but if som wil needs be so forward, the care is taken. In you I am made so confident by that (I might iustly vse Honourable, Noble, Worthy, or some such high Epithete: but I will rather say) Honest (a poore phrase will some thinke) and vertuous disposition which accompanies you, that I must account it may happinesse that I liue to knowe a second, whose brest Goodnesse makes her habitation; yet pardon mee if I

say, I enioy not this happinesse without some touch of griefe; I shall not neede to implore your protection, though your pardon. I acknowledge I haue presu∣med, and know you can and will remit the errors of Affection in him that is,
