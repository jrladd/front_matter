My Lord,
THough the lowest Vertue ought not to want its due praise, yet true Re∣ligion (as it deserves) ought to have the highest Encomi∣um, inasmuch as it surpasses the rest as far as Divine ex∣cellencies
do excel all things Natural.
The Moral Perfections may be found in a high mea∣sure in those who are not act∣ed by the spirit and vigour of true Religion: But where∣soever she hath her residence, she produces all the Habits of Vertue (who receive their splendour from her, as Beams from the brightness of the Sun) and from thence diffu∣ses them on the rest of Man∣kind, influencing them to a∣spire at imitation.
And as Religion is in it
self praise-worthy in  est degree (as that  nobles the Minds of  makes them indeed to  they were design'd  great Creator); so  that be religious worthy  high commendation; but  specially those who by  Rank and Quality are  in the highest Sphere, to be as it were Exemplars to the Vulgar; for though their greatness makes them not seldom the Objects of Envy, yet they are not only feared by the bad, but always ad∣mir'd
and prais'd by all good men.
This is that which makes Your Grace so esteemed by all, and by which You deservedly have the applause of all sorts of men.
I will not here expatiate concerning Your Renown'd Exploits abroad, because they are fitter for a Volume than an Epistle; but will only re∣member, that Maestricht (re∣puted once invincible) has now undeceiv'd the owners of that fond opinion, by forfeit∣ing her Reputation to the
Force of Your Arms; so tha you may say (and with a good Reason as the valian and renowned Caesar) Veni∣vidi, vici. And who can doubt the truth on't, that considers how so lately, and with so much facility, you appeased by your appearance the Troubles in Scotland, which were dissipated as a Mist before the brightness of the Sun.
But passing by Your Natu∣ral, Moral, and Military En∣dowments, as matters gene∣rally known to all; the true
Religion (in the profession of which Your Grace is so e∣minently conspicuous) hath produced such proofs of love in most, and such arguments of esteem to Your Person in all, that should I go about here to recite them, I should tire my self with writing, and at last be forced to quit the task without being able to give a due Description.
For this reason I took the boldness of addressing my self to Your Grace with this pre∣sent FRYER, that I might bring him before Your Graces
Tribunal, as  to obtain Your  ∣ction.
True Religion does  ly consist in Worshipping  after a right manner,  practising Holiness and P∣ty; but in the abhorrence  all false Worship, and hatred of Vice and Wickedness: And as Your Grace is eminent for the first, so you shall here find occasion enough for the se∣cond, when you shall consider the viciousness of their Lives, whose way of Worship you al∣ready detest.

 small Trea∣ to Your Graces sensure, desiring again to be sheltred by Your Graces pro∣tection, to whom I most hum∣bly do insinuate my Condition, and beg perdon for the pre∣sumption of,
My Lord,
