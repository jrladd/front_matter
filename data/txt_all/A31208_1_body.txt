Two in one


Right Worthy, and most Ho∣noured Patrons,
AMongst the numberless vanities of this life,
 our thoughts have more than once glaunced (not with∣out a certain indig∣nation), upon that exceeding folly of almost all Dedica∣tory Epistles; the writers whereof, (as if hir'd tomake Encomiums, and present the world with Panegericks) run over each common place of Rhetorick in the
 recital of their Pa∣trons rare parts and qualities, leave no tittle of honour un∣touch'd, no action of their lives un∣admir'd, no prero∣gative of pedigree unextoll'd, no gift of nature or grace unsumm'd up; and having drain'd their whole stock of invention in this scrupulous inquest after all sorts of
 praises; conclude finally, that al these (and more lines of perfection, than either their mode∣sty dares relate, or their capacity can reach), do directly concentrate in the unparalell'd brests of them, whom they thus resolve to celebrate, cano∣nize and Deify. A proceeding so far from pleasing all
 generous, heroick, and discerning spi∣rits, that it rather puts them to the blush, to see them∣selves more abus'd than adorned, with such plain and pal∣pable flatteries.
We therefore (most worthy Pa∣trons), who build upon other princi∣ples; and follow a Rule and professi∣on obliging us to
 sincerity: though we most willingly acknowledg your temporal and spiri∣tual greatnesses, heartily congratu∣late your high per∣fections, and joy∣fully consider you mounting up a∣main the divine ladder of heavenly love & contempla∣tion: Yet we cannot but look upon your souls as immured
 stil in walls of clay; we can only judge you to be faithfull pilgrims, not full possessors; to be va∣liant champions, not yet crowned con∣querors; and ther∣fore we conceive that we may much better complie wth our dutie to God, and our obligation to you, by endea∣voring to further you in your spiri∣tual
 progress, than to follow you wth Euge's and accla∣mations, as if you were already arri∣v'd at the desired end of your jour∣ney.
For this reason, we declare, that the primarie motive inducing us to pre∣sent you with this small spiritual do∣native, is the ardent zeal and desire we
 have of your own happie advance∣ment in solid devo∣tion & divine cha∣ritie. And in pursu∣ance of this design, we
First, discover brieflie unto you the most common & dangerous snares of your sworn ene∣mies, and shew you the safe way to shun them.
Secondly, we de∣liver
 spiritual arms into your hands, wherewith to de∣fend your selves, & defeat your foes, by reducing the precepts into pra∣ctice, & furnishing you with such af∣fective acts & ele∣vations, as may rea∣dily serve you for restauratives against fainting in these your indefatigable combats.

 Thirdly, we raise you up a ladder of perfection; from the top whereof, (which is perfect indifferencie, resig∣nation, and obedi∣ence to Gods Di∣vine will and plea∣sure), you may comfortablie cast down an eie, and counteach step you have taken in your wearisom journey towards your hea∣venlie
 Jerusalem.
Fourthly, from this mountain top of perfection, we shew you the di∣vers degrees of sa∣cred and seraphi∣cal love, which wil lead your eleva∣ted souls to perfect union with their beloved Bride∣groom, and settle them in the sweet embraces and bo∣som of the divinity.

 And lastly, we have made a colle∣ction of the chief∣est and choicest Maxim's of mysti∣cal Theologie, to which you may have continual re∣course, by which you may solve all your doubts, and in which you may se∣cure your consci∣ences, upon all e∣mergent occasions and difficulties, ari∣sing
 in this your blessed enterprise & tendance to eter∣nal felicitie. These are the choice flowers which we have gathered in the several gar∣dens of sacred wri∣ters, and bound up in this posie for your present use, comfort, and incou∣ragement.
The other end we aim at in this
 our dedication, is to give you, & poste∣ritie, a publick and perpetual testimo∣nie of our grateful hearts for your ma∣ny signal favors and temporal benefits; wherewith you have more obliged us, and our neerest friends, than we can either tell how to repay in any o∣ther coin, or ex∣press in any parti∣cular
 tearms: And therefore we de∣sire you to receive this our thankfull acknowledgement and real protestati∣tion, proceeding from both our uni∣ted mindes and mouthes, as an ab∣solute assurance of our truly devoted service to your selves, and all the worthy branches of your most ho∣noured family.
