HIS Maiestie (Right Hono∣rable, if it please you to remember) in his Epistle before the Remon∣strance, does greatly magni∣fie the third Estate of France, for preferring an Article in

their Parliament, against their Kings obnoxiousnesse vnto Papall Deposition: In the defence of whose iudgment therein, his Pen hath flourish∣ed out such a Defence of Kings Rights, as shall neuer wither vnto the end of the world. Now howsoeuer the Parliaments of England were neuer inferiour vnto those of France for zeale and vigilancie, toward the maintenance of their Kings Supremacie; yet may it please you to suffer the words of ex∣hortation, to perseuer in such vigilancy and fidelitie, to∣ward the Lord and his im∣mediate

Deputie: And as oft as you shall heare any of the night birds, croaking for the Roman forraigner, so often to double your industry, toward the treading out those vermin and damming vp their pud∣dles. And it may be, your Iudg∣ment will take some incitati∣on thereunto, if you shall at some vacant time vouchsafe a perusall of this treatise: the maine argument for the Ro∣mish Title consisting of diuers propositions linked together, whereof not one is of force; as now God-willing (my leaue first taken of your Honours) I shall apply my selfe to declare.
