SIR,
SO many circumstances Conspire, and I am prompted by so many ob∣ligations
to make you this present, that I can no way decline it; without taxing my self with ingra∣titude. And yet after all I must Confess. I think this less an acknowledge∣ment than a just tribute to your merit and your Vertues. For notwith∣standing you have all the advantages of Body and Mind, you are so far from valuing your self for them, and making Pa∣rade of your accomplishments,
that you use all your en∣deavours to conceal them from the world, and con∣temne all those vanities which Persons of your age and Circumstances do usual∣ly pursue and hug with so much eagerness and pas∣sion. Thus Modesty seems to be your Darling Ver∣tue, tho you entertain and practise all the others on every Occasion. Where∣fore to comply with that Modesty you so much cherish I shall quit this
point, which is indeed above description, and pro∣ceed to give you, Sir, some account of the offer∣ing I make you, which is an exact Relation of the Wars of the Crown of Poland with the King of Sweden in Casimers Reign, who being an Amourous Prince, it like∣wise containes an Account of his Love intrigues, which indeed occasioned his own Ruine and the de∣solation of all, or the great
est part of his Kingdom. All herein related, being generally matter of Fact, you will find but little of Fiction or Romances, and therefore cannot pre∣tend to meet with that delicate turne of Thought and of Expression that might be expected in a piece that depended wholly, or principally upon fancy. Yet the Naked truth has such charmes, as I hope will more than countervail for that disadvantage. Such
as it is, Sir, I lay it at your feet and beg it may meet with your acceptance, which I was the more en∣couraged to do, and am in the more hopes of, for that of all the parts of Learning, I have found History to have ever had most of your kindness and favour; for which reasons I apprehended you would be the more willing to grant it your Protection, and me a Pardon for this
Presumption, who am with all manner of Zeal and respect,
SIR,
