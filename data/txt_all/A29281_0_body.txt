RIGHT HONORABLE,
I Am bold in Jesus Christ to pre∣sent you with this insuing Trea∣tise, as a part of the Councel of God, witnessing in the Lord unto you, That the Work you have to do for the House of God, is far above your and the worlds present apprehensions; the true Church being no way to be restored, until you (whose work J hope it is) have made desolate the false Church, Rev. 17.16. who before made desolate the true Church, Rev. 11 2. so that in all you do less then the making of it desolate, you come short of fulfilling the Mind of God, and occasion the delay of your own
deliverance, and the Kingdoms Peace, to do which God will inforce you, and not give you rest until it be done, (yea, and all) be it what, or whomsoever: they that hinder it will be removed out of the way, God will spare no man, any thing herein; be ye therefore instructed, ye that be Judges of the Earth, and kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a lit∣tle, that ye may in this his day of wrath find favour with the Lord, that ye may live in his sight, and behold his salvation ready to be revealed; which is the desire and fervent prayer of

25 May, 1649.
