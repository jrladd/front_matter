Madam,
NO sooner came this Sermon
vnto my hands, (the Au∣thor
whereof for his appro∣ued
zeale, worthily deserued the title
of an eminent Light and Ornament
of our Church) then I vowed the de∣dication
thereof vnto your Ladiship;
Nor may it seeme vnworthy your
fauourable acceptance (the principall
aime of my expectance) in regard of

that singular testimony which all men
that haue been conuersant in his
Works, doe giue of the Author, being
such a one as neither affection could
corrupt, nor affectation transport; but
of that spirit, as he was zealous with a
good conscience, making humility his
path to glory. Jn a word, (Madam)
his former Labours (now reduced in∣to
one Ʋolume) haue been euer coun∣tenanced
by some choice Patrons:
Nor may this (being equall with
most of the rest) claime lesse preroga∣tiue
then the rest. Thus wishing you
that benefit for which it was intended,
to the glory of God, whereto it is di∣rected,
J rest,
