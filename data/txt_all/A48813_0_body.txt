HIS Majesty, having with a Grace exemplary not onely to all his Subjects of this Naiion, but to all Christian Princes and States, (however they may be themselves of the Roman Persuasion) design'd it, as the avowed Glory and Stability of his Reign, to settle such a Liberty, that there may be free discourses, and debates concerning the Truths of Christian Reli∣gion, and the Dissents of Christians in them, as from the Pulpit, so proportionably from the Press; as there∣fore the Ministers and Fautors of that Church (which would be known by the Name of Catholick) have al∣ways (and will be while they are) always active with their Pens to the utmost in their Sphaer. And as we see they have Publick Freedom, so is it not to be doubted of the Princely so Vniversal Grace, but that he intends a Freedom on the other side to an∣swer; that there may be no Inequality in holding the Beam, but that it may alike incline to all in this matter, specially now that he is making Credence of those his Royal Favours to all His Protestant Sub∣jects, who cannot but be deeply concern'd at such a Time as this; because of the great Advantages, the Interests of the Counter-Scale hope for from a Sove∣reign of their own Sentiments. But in no case is this Liberty more desirable, than when an Amphibious-Ambidextrous Bishop, who assumes, like that Angel of the Revelation, to set one Foot on the Sea, and

the other on the Earth: One Foot on the Protes∣tant Church, (which he calls one as if his self were of it) and the other on the Roman: In favour of which he so openly appeareth (to speak the most ho∣nourably of him) to conciliate toward it, at lest a Cassandrian Temperament: which, as it will never be yielded by the Protestant, so would it not be ac∣cepted, if it were offer'd, by the Papist. For he hath published (with what intentions is best known to God, and his own Conscience) a palliation of the most ir∣reconciliable Points of the Popish Religion, Tran∣substantiation, the Sacrifice of the Mass, the Invoca∣tion and Adoration of the Virgin Mary swoln to such a Monstrosity in that Religion, together with other Saints, and all with Images too; Points wherein the Wisedom of the Nation thought fit to fix the TEST, as the security of Protestancy; and that of Ima∣ges of so great Infamy in Sacred Writ, and all these with a Multitude of Rampant Words; now rather than a Multitude of such Words should not be answe∣red, or a man of lips be justified, even the very Stones would speak: Such Lies and Sophistry will not suffer Men to hold their peace, and while he seems ra∣ther to mock than argue, should not every one en∣deavour to make him ashamed? For, certainly, his ways of Discourse are like those of the Whorish Wo∣man in the Proverbs, so moveable, one cannot know them, he comes out in this Time, that he esteems a Twilight, and with a prostituted Subtilty he treats of Sacred things: he is loud and stubborn; his feet abide not in the House of his own Church, as he his self styles it; but now he is in the Streets of the Strange Religion, and layeth wait in every Corner with a New sort of Ecclesiastical Polity, or in a New

Edition, and his great Temptation is, I have, saith e Peace-Offerings with me, that carry at the same Time Reconciliableness to Rome, and likewise a Blessing himself in a design'd Indulgence to his own Genius, and caressing himself in the thoughts of his comforta∣ble Magdalen Importances, and though at a high Wa∣ter of Papacy he would be burnt for a Heretick, if he did not speak more out, which without doubt he is prepar'd to do on congruous Occasions, yet so much, at this seeming Return of the Water, is enough to be∣atifie and then Canonize him in that present Kalen∣der, where, I doubt not, he stands markt with a Red Letter, and it may be a just Reason to all sincere Pro∣testants to spue him out of their Mouths: The obser∣vation of his double dealing and appearing more like the Atheist than the Learned and Ingenuous, though mispersuaded, Papist, sowetimes transports my Style be∣yond its own Intention and Resolution, when I first es∣said to consider onely the rational part of Discourse in those matters; and I am much the bolder, because I hear from all, his Book hath much disserv'd His Maje∣sties Gratious Purpose, and created in all minds a Nau∣saea; specially observing his odd Aspersions on so emi∣nent a Person, as Dr. St. who in the thoughts of all the World is incomparably (and beyond all possibility of being nam'd together,) ten thousand times more, the Apostolick Bishop.
If I have offered too largely to a just Indignation here, I having the Treatise it self mostly applied my self to the rational part, and minded chiefly to possess the Rea∣der with the true sense of things: I have therefore wav'd the persuit of his History of Transubstantiation in the se∣veral Stages of it, leaving it to more learned Persons, who, I doubt not, may observe in their usual walks and

dail-y paths, through the whole course of Ecclesiastick Times Many of his Erratick motions: but however the main point of truth, or falshood on that Head, or Article rests in this little room whether it is possible to believe such sublime spirituality (as our Lord alway breath'd) so little of kin to sense, to matter, to flesh, should in his holy dying Institution, forsake him so, that he should, in∣tend to engage his Blessed Body, that was so suddenly to become a Spiritual Glorious Body, and to Asscend far above all Heavens, to so inglorious, insipid, ineffica∣cious a desscent, as onely to dispossess a small Roll os Bread, or Wafer of its whole Substance, and as by a trick to leave its Accidents still intire to fool and baffle all the sense and reason in the World: and yet to so little effect as to suffer the Bodies and the Souls too, of the greatest number of the Eaters to be without any Evidences of good, as notorious and certain, as the miracle is supposed to be stupendous; whoever can believe this, need not go to visit the dark and too oft impure Cells where so strange a Doc∣rine was conceiv'd and foster'd, he hath a Bulimy of Faith without more ado of search and inquiry to devour all the absurdities that the name of a Church can offer him.
And so to the points os Idolatry, abating from things Pious and Learned, (to which let the utmost allowances of deference and honour be yielded, and paid) the No∣tions he would imprint of it on the minds of his Readers, are an audacious affront (as he speaks in a more innocent case) to God the Creator of Heaven and Earth in his Word, who therein abhorrs all Distributions and Par∣cellings out of any the least Particles of the Glory of the One God, or Mediator to any of the most Seraphick of his Creatures, Angels, or Saints, or the Mother of God, as he speaks without Precedent from Scripture, and hardly

allowable in a Discourse of Idolatry although tolerated in the case of the Nestorian Heresie: Even so all Address of any Beings besides that God and the Mediator, his Word doth de TEST specially invisible Beings, to whom we can make not the least Application, but under the peril of Idolatry as Communicating them, in any semblances of Worship, with those Incommunicable Attributes and Pro∣perties of Omniscience and Omnipresence: He hath indeed allowed and commanded mutuous respects in the low∣er humane World for the settlement of the order of Reli∣gious, and Civil Offices; but all the figments of Men's own Brains concerning Worship of Himself, or of the Me∣diator through the Mediation of any of his Creatures, and most notoriously, by Graven Images, or any kind of Si∣militudes comprehending other Figments, he declares to be Abomination. It is a grand Audaciousness therefore to offer such an insolent piece of falshood to Christian minds as that the Cherub were by his appointment to be Worshipped, or to have Worship directed to them, because their Resemblances were placed as waiting at that Throne that was Empty of any Presence to sit upon it; but an Invisible Glory and Grace had promised favour to those who, according to his Word, praid toward that place, which He having fill'd with a visible sign of his Presence of Glory He after placed his Name there: with as much sense therefore it might have been said that every Stone in the Building of the Temple, or whatever was in the Temple, or specially in the Holy of Holies, was to be Worshipped as to say the Cherubim were to be Worshipped, of God in, through, or by them.
A Parallell Essrontery it is to load the Sun and Host of Heaven, the Scripture with all the Idolatries brands, and so contrary to the very letter of it, that the Visional Representation of the Jewish Idolatries to Ezekiel, Ch. 7.

distinguisheth that of the Sun from all the Rest, I stand therefore in perfect Amaze and Astonish what the Christian, much more the Protestant, Bishop should mean, and yet make so open and publick an appeal for his In∣tegrity, God and the World in the close. As to what con∣cerns the Test and the Peerage, I humbly submit the Reason of it to the higher Judges in these things; beg∣ging pardon of any errors in so great matters, as likewise taking example in that, I beg of all Men allowance for mistakes of humane infirmity in so Critical a point and in so Critical a time.
