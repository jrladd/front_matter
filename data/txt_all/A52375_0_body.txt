Dear and Well-beloved Father,
NOt only the Bonds of Nature, and the knot of Re∣lation betwixt us, but also the great Cord of Af∣fection and Christianity, hath drawn me forth, and induced me to Dedicate these my weak fruits of Labour and Love unto your serious and pious Consideration: judg∣ing it may be a great Manifestation of my Duty towards you, and a signal Token of that tender Love and Respect, which your Deserts (through Grace) calls for at my hands: It is not Silver nor Gold, Money nor Riches that I have here to present unto you or to accommodate you withal; but such as my Heavenly Father hath (out of his abundant trea∣sures) bestowed upon me: It is not Earthly shadows of a Temporal Concernment, but Heavenly Substance of a Spiritual Nature; Therefore what I have Received, I freely and cor∣dially impart unto you, hoping it will be an acceptable To∣ken unto you. Your Aged Years I Honour, and your Gray Hairs I Reverence, especially being found in the Path of Righteousness: for give me leave to tell you, that it's Ver∣tue and Piety that makes Age truly Honourable and Preci∣ous, more than Treasures of Riches, where Godliness is wanting. It's no small Joy unto me, when I Consider you,
not only as my Father in the flesh, but also Related to me in the Spirit; That there is a nearer Relation betwixt us than what is outward, and a more excellent Affinity between us than that of Nature; Our Natural Relations are but shadows and husks, and of a momentary standing; but Spiritual Affinity is a fountain of Joy that abides for ever; the former will pe∣rish and cease from being, but the latter shall continue, and never have an end. It's matter of great Rejoycing to me, when I Consider how you press forward and persevere in the wayes of God, even to your latter dayes, and in the midst of Troubles, that you are not frighted from the Truth, by the frowns of men, but still you continue faithful to the Purity of the Gospel, notwithstanding the threatning ruine and spoil that attends it. Oh! how many have run well in their young dayes, and gone on eminently for God in a Day of Prosperi∣ty, and yet in the time of Persecution, or else in the time of old Age have grown weary of God, and declined his wayes and Worship; and have minded their own ease and Interest, more than the Glory of God! But blessed be the Lord, it's otherwise with you, it is not length of time that hath dimi∣nished your Love to God; nor Changes of Providences that hath abated your zeal to the Truth, nor Alterations in Church and State, that hath altered your Resolutions in the Work and Service of your Heavenly Father.
Dear Father: You have lived to behold sundry and vari∣ous Dispensations of God, and you have seen much of the out-goings and in-comings of the Lord in this Land of our Na∣tivity; and you have experienced much of the Power and Goodness of mighty Jehovah in several Conditions, both in Prosperity and Adversity, in Sickness and in Health; yea, in the midst of Discouragements, you have received Comforts from God; and in the midst of Troubles, you have received Strength from the Lord: You have seen the Churches of
Christ flourishing and shining in these Nations, and the Ene∣mies thereof confounded and brought to shame: Your eyes have beheld what a Wall of Defence the Rock of Ages hath been to his People, and how he hath made their Enemies (though more and Mightier) to become Tributary and Ser∣vants to them; and how he had placed men fearing God, in great Places of Trust; and those that followed Vertue and Piety, in Places of great Affairs; by which means Ma∣gistracy became a Terrour to evil-doers, & a Praise to them that did well; and Religion, Vertue and Holiness was Coun∣tenanced, Upheld and Maintained by a face of Authority in these Nations, in your dayes.
But now you have lived to see a mighty Change, and a wonderful Alteration, another World (as it were) flowing with sin and Iniquity, wherein the Church of Christ is very low, poor and contemptible; and the Vineyard of our God hath been laid open to ravenous Beasts, & the Boar out of the Wood hath laid it waste; and they have through their Subtilty caused many tall Cedars to fall, and by their Power have Crushed and Oppressed the tender Plants and Vines, and a great Inundation of Sin and Prophaness over-flows the Na∣tion. Well, our God is at Work, and he will certainly do great things for Sion, and will in his due time turn all things to his own Glory, and his Peoples great Good and Benefit: Whether you may live to see the Redemption of Sion, or the Churches flourish again in this Nation, I cannot tell; But of this I am perswaded, That you will one Day enjoy a far bet∣ter state of Joy and Perfection, without mixture or Chang∣ableness; and therefore as a Cordial to your Soul in this earthly Pilgrimage, I have briefly set before you a glimpse of that Glory and Happiness which the Saints shall enjoy in their Father's Kingdom; which Portion I doubt not but you can claim an Interest in, and I hope you will assuredly en∣joy
and possess it, when the Earth and Heavens shall be no more. Indeed, Considering your day is drawing to a period, and the great Troubles, Calamities, and Afflictions which you have seen, felt, and undergone; I did judge that I could not present unto you a more serious, sutable, and seasonable Sub∣ject than this. And Considering the Troubles of the Day, and the Rage of the Adversary, I have here drawn forth a Cord of Encouragement, out of the Scriptures of Comfort, as a means to Arm and Fortifie our Souls against the Fear and Terrour of Man; that we may Chearfully & Faithfully stand to the Work of the Lord, notwithstanding the great Oppo∣sitions which we may meet withal from the Sons of Men.
It's that which I Pen'd in the time of my Restraint and Imprisonment, when my Soul was much exercised in the Thoughts of God's Goodness; And truly, my Soul hath suck∣ed much sweetness out of this Heavenly Fountain; and it's that which hath much Refreshed, Comforted and born me up in the midst of my Sufferings and Tryals; And I hope it will (through the Blessing of God) be of the same use unto your Soul.
If the Lord by this Discourse should make me (who is the Fruit of your Body) an Instrument of Joy and Comfort to your Soul, in this Day of trouble and difficulty, I shall think my self largely Requited for my Labour in Writing; and shall earnestly desire that God may have the Glory: There∣fore to that end, I shall Commend the following Discourse to the Blessing of God, and your serious perusal; and Rest,
