SIR,
WHen first I had the Honour to see you, thorough my own experience, I was confirmed in the o∣pinion of a Sympa∣thy between persons; for then my inclination was wrought upon with much respect and tenderness for you: these beginnings produced by sudden Causes, were soon grounded upon others better known, ad strengthen'd with the consideration of your being committed to my Care, and I in∣trusted with the direction of your

Travels. Then that which was at first an effect either of inclination or choice, was enforced as a necessary duty of being diligent and faithful in the Trust I had taken upon me.
I was much encouraged, and re∣ceived it as a good Omen, to see you in those very tender years, take a generous Resolution; and this as much out of your own motion, as upon the suggestion of others (yet in subordination to the direction of those who had right and authority over you) to leave Relations and Countrey, to strive after being bet∣tered with an Outlandish Breeding.
But when I began better to be ac∣quainted with you, all former Dispo∣sitions and Engagements ceased or were suspended, to give place to new and greater Ties. I could perceive in you, all inclinations to be Good, free from Vice, and favourable Dis∣positions to receive what good im∣pressions

I was able to work upon you▪ a Judgment desirous, or rather greedy to be informed; a Will ready to be directed, and Affections to be recti∣fied: And in few words, by way of Reading, Conversations, propound∣ing Doubts, asking good Questions, you were unwearied in your En∣deavors to be instructed: And with your close following Riding the great Horse, Fencing, Dancing, Draw∣ing Landskips, and Designing; Learn∣ing upon the Gitar, the French and Italian Tongues, and following other Exercises, to acquire those Ac∣complishments, which do so much be∣come a Gentleman of your Age, Estate and Quality: It is very hard to find one as you; who would take so much Pains, and be so exact in making Observations about Persons, Places and Things; so that for the space of four years, thorough all France, Italy, part of Hungary, Bohe∣mia,

Germany, and Switzerland, hardly any considerable Person or Thing, hath escaped your fight. It is rare to see others as well as you, in the depth of Winter, to be with Masters of Ex∣ercises by Candle-light, and some∣times an hour before day, and not be satisfied with the explication of the Writings of your Master of Mathe∣maticks, but also to take your self the Pains to Copy them.
But one of the greatest Commen∣dations I can add, is, That you ever yielded to Reason, and were pleased to take my advice, and follow my counsel, which made my Task com∣fortable to me, and your Travels be∣neficial to your self: Hence it is, that in your Actions, one could perceive you had the two essential things ne∣cessary to every one of them, name∣ly Rule; that is, Grounds and Cau∣ses, with Resolution; that is, Cou∣rage and Constancy, whereby you

know some difficulties lying in our way, have been overcome.
Your Moneys you did not trifle away, but bestowed them upon good Books, Medals, and other useful Ra∣rities worth the Curiosity of a Com∣pleat Gentleman; so that one may see you have been a good Husband of two precious Things, your Time and your Moneys.
After this, you may judge of my inclination, and the world of the ne∣cessity of my Dedicating this to you, which, with the other Parts of my Book, you know were compiled the first Summer we were together in France; Accept it therefore with the full assurance of my ever being,
Sir,
