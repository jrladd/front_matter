MADAM,
THe Book, before which I pre∣sume
to fix Your Royal Name,
being the Product of some
Hours defalkt from Your Majesties
Service, and the Subject of it Polemi∣cal,
set me for some time at dispute
with my self, whether I should let it
venture to knock at Your Closet-Door.
Your Early Preventing the Sun
to praise your Creator, and Constant
Retirements from the Tumults of the
World (which I could wish were as
much imitated as they are admired)
to Ʋnite Your Soul by Prayer with

Him, and establish it in that perfect
Peace, which can only be enjoyed
in becoming One Spirit with Him,
made me judg some Treatise of Di∣vine
Love (which might minister
matter to the Sacred Fire, that burns
continually upon the Altar of Your
Heart) would suit much better with
that Better Part, which you have cho∣sen
with Mary, than a Book of Con∣troversy.
Here then my thoughts
were at a stand, how to make my
Address without Offence; And I
was ready to complain with Martha,
that I was left alone; when that Ad∣mirable
Mixture of Clemency and
Zeal, which disposes Your Heroick
Mind, not only to forgive Offences
of this Nature; but to esteem and
cherish them as Pious; convinc'd me,
I must be guilty of a greater Tres∣pass,
should I doubt of obtaining
either Your Pardon or Protection.
Nor was this All. The Glorious

Saint,S. Catharine. (whose Name You
bear,) as she encourag'd
me with her Example to engage in
this Controversy; so much more to
recommend my endeavours to Your
Majesties Patronage. It was Her bu∣siness
to convince and reduce Idola∣ters
to the Faith of Christ: Mine,
is to defend the Faith which Christ
planted in his Church, from the Im∣putation
of Idolatry. An Aspersion
so foul and Blasphemous, that it be∣trays
the ForgerCalvin, Anagr. Lucian.
of it to be, what
the Anagram of his Name expresses,
a second Lucian. Blasphemous, I say:
For who-ever will undertake to
maintain the Charge, must at the
same time profess that Christ, who
commanded us under pain of dam∣nation
to hear his Church, hath per∣mitted
Her to require and enjoin her
Children for many hundreds of years
together, to commit Idolatry (as my

Adversary contends) parallel to that
of the Heathens. And consequently
that Mahomet, (that grand Impostor)
whose Followers have been preser∣ved
by the Grounds he laid, for a∣bove
a Thousand Years, from falling
into Idolatry, had more Wisdom and
Power to contrive and carry on his
design, than the Son of God: and
that our Fore-Fathers in this Land,
had better have been converted to
Judaism, or Turcism, than to Chri∣stianity,
as they were.
These, Madam, are the detestable
Consequences of charging Idolatry
upon the Catholick-Roman Church;
which, as they must needs strike hor∣rour
into Your Religious Soul (nay
even of any who values the name of
Christian) So I thought it my Duty,
being singled out by a particular de∣siance
from this new Abettor of it,
to appear in Vindication of that
Faith (on which Your MAJESTY

grounds Your Hope of Heaven, and
whose Influence hath enrich'd Your
Mind with all the Noblest Vertues)
from so unjust and scandalous a slan∣der.
Which nevertheless I have en∣deavoured
to manage with that Mo∣deration
and Temper, as (Circumstan∣ces
duly weigh'd) can neither create
just Offence in the dissenting Party;
nor I hope render it mis-deserving
to be presented to Your Majesties
View, by
MADAM,
