Honourable Sir;
THis last Maske, presented by Gentle∣men of Graies Inne, before his Maie∣stie, in honor of the marriage, and hap∣py alliance betweene two such princi∣pall persons of the kingdome, as are the Earle of Suffolke, and the Earle of Sommerset, hath receiued such grace from his Ma∣iestie, the Queene and Prince, and such approbation from the generall. As it may well deserue to bee repeated to those that were present, and represented to those that were absent, by committing the same to the Presse, as o∣thers haue been. The dedication of it could not be doubt∣full, you hauing beene the Principall, and in effect the onely person, that did both incourage and warrant the Gentlemen, to shew their good affection towards so noble a Coniunction, in a time of such Magnificence. Where∣in we conceiue without giuing you false attributes, which little neede where so many are true. That you haue gra∣ced in generall the Societies of the Innes of Court, in con∣tinuing them still as third persons with the Nobilite and Court, in doing the King honor. And particularly Graies Inne, which as you haue formerly brought to flourish both
 in the auncienter and younger sort, by countenancing vertue in euery qualitie. So now you haue made a notable demonstration thereof in the later and lesse serious kind, by this, That one Inne of Court by it selfe, in time of a Vacation, and in the space of three weekes, could per∣forme that which hath beene performed, which could not haue beene done, but that euery mans exceeding loue and respect to you, gaue him wings to ouertake Time, which is the swiftest of things. This which we alledge for your Honour, we may alledge indifferently for our excuse, if any thing were amisse or wanting, for your times did scarce afford moments, and our experience went not be∣yond the compasse of some former imployment of that na∣ture, which our grauer studies mought haue made vs by this time to haue forgotten. And so wishing you all en∣crease of honour, we rest
