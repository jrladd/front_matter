MY LORD,
IT having been usual to dedicate Works of publick Use and Be∣nefit to great Persons, eminent for Vertue, Learning and Nobility, I think my self happy under the Obligation of that Custom; since it somewhat excuses, as well as encourages my Pre∣sumption, to lay this Performance at your Lord∣ship's Feet.
I am sure it could not be honoured with a more agreeable Name:
A Name so universally known, that all Men acknowledg your Lordship to be signally endued with those excellent Qualities, which render you not only a great Master in the most useful Parts of Learning, but likewise incline you to a gene∣rous Encouragement of all those who have any pretence to them. Which Favour, your Lordship having been pleased to confer on me, among se∣veral others of greater Merit, gives me the more Confidence to address this first Volume of our English History to your Lordship's Patronage: for as no Person hath been more conversant in things of this Nature than your self; so I know none more able to make a right Judgment of them.
And tho I will not affirm this to be an Exact Hi∣story according to the strict Rules of Art, yet if I were conscious to my self, that it was wholly unworthy your Acceptance, I should derogate very much from that Respect which is so justly due to your Lordship's Character.
But if the not Writing any thing which I did not believe to be true, nor the concealing any thing useful to the World, that is so, might qualify me for an Historian, perhaps then I may have some pretence to that Title. However, your Lordship will here meet with a faithful Account of all the chief Actions and Revolutions, that

have happened in this Kingdom down to the Nor∣man William. As first, the Conquest the Ro∣mans made of that part of Britain we now call England; then their quitting it after a long Pos∣session, in order to secure their Empire at Home from the Insults of so many barbarous Nations: after which followed the calling in of the Sax∣ons to assist the Britains. And lastly, from the formers quarrelling with the latter, ensued their total Expulsion out of the best and most fertile parts of this Island.
As for the Invasions by the Danes under King Cnute, and by the Normans under King William, commonly called the Conqueror; though it must be granted, that these Princes were victorious by their Arms, yet was not this Nation subdued by either of them so entirely, as that its Sub∣missions could properly be stiled Conquests, but rather Acquisitions gained by those Princes upon certain Compacts between them and the People of England; both Parties standing obliged in so∣lemn Oaths, mutually to perform their parts of the Agreement, as will be clearly seen in the Se∣quel of this History.
Yet I doubt not but in these great Revoluti∣ons, your Lordship will take notice, that the People of this Kingdom were never overcome by Strangers, till their Luxury softning their warlike Tempers, and producing a careless Administration of their Affairs, had made them an easy Prey to their Invaders: This I observe not to reproach,

but to warn our Nation, lest by the like Miscar∣riages they should incur the like Punishments.
I have now no more, but to beg your Lord∣ship's Acceptance of this Dedication, as a Tri∣bute justly yours, by reason of those great Obli∣gations, for your so freely communicating to me some part of your uncommon Knowledg, when∣ever I have had the Happiness of your excellent Conversation;
An Honour, which engages me to own my self, with the utmost Respect,
My LORD,
