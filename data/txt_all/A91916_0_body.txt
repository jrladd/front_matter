Right Honorable, and right Worshipful:
IT was a worthy saying of Aelius Trajanus, who suc∣ceeded Trajane in the Ro∣mane Empire, Non mihi, sed populo; signifying that which he was oft heard to say, Ita se Rem-publicam gessurum, ut sciret Rem populi esse, non suam: but it was
a more noble and gracious Speech of a King in Judah to his Iudges, Non mihi, nec homi∣ni, sed Deo: therefore God himself hath called you Gods; Gods towards us, but men towards God, yet Gods for God and us: they are not to look only downwards to us, expecting a duty that belongs to such Gods; but look upwards and re∣member the duty they owe to us by Gods appoint∣ment, that only makes Gods: And surely their Name tells them their business, and that they are not only concerned, but ought to have a special re∣gard to those things, not only wherein their peace, but the glory of God is most involved. God in holy Writ much delights in two names, viz. to be a Iudge and a Father; when he comes towards the world in general, or towards his own Church chequered with good and bad men, you shall meet with him as a Iudge: but when he comes to his own, he calls them Children, and speaks to them as a Father. The same hath he given unto his Presidents in this world, the Magistrates; if they look into the Common-wealth to decide business, (though it be of Orphans and Father∣less) its in the Garments of a Iudge: but if to a Church, (such as is, or should be wholy his own)
then as Fathers, as nursing-Fathers. This I write to you, my Lord, and Gentlemen, not as your Instructer, but Remembrancer for the ex∣perience of this towards me (a small member of the Church) as a Minister, I have found, and must acknowledge; which I desire might extend unto the whole Church; which to be done by you, and others in the same Places and Callings, would much confer to the Happiness and Peace of the Church of God (of which you are to be Fa∣thers) and to your own private Peace, making your Callings to act towards such high and emi∣nent Ends, and for Him, who for himself, hath given you his Chaire of Iudgment; for which prayes
