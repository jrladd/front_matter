MY LORD,
TIs a common, and vain
pretence in Dedicati∣ons,
That the Name of the
Great Person is prefixed to
keep off Censure: And if it
would do so in earnest, the
Author might secure himself
upon easie terms; and those
that write Books, need not
complain so much of the

Tongues of the Envious, and
the Ignorant: But the worst
on't is, they that use the
Courtship, intend it for no
other; and know, that they
are no more secure under the
Title of their Patron, than
a Man in Battle is behind a
Target made with a Paper-Picture
of St. George.
But, my Lord, though I
contemn those silly, Roman∣tick
kinds of Flatteries, yet I
have a real need of your
Lordship's Name, which,
without this Vanity, I may
use in my defence: since the
Angry Gentleman, that gave
occasion to the following Di∣scourse,

hath usurp'd it to
give colour to his Reproa∣ches.
What are the Parti∣culars,
I have told your Lord∣ship,
and have mentioned
them in some of the nearest
ensuing Leaves. And since
the Man of Disputations hath
accused me for an Infidel,
and framed a Story concern∣ing
your Lordship to confirm
it, I think it not sufficient
to confute the Charge, but
must also shame the Legend:
which, no doubt, your
Name here prefixt, and the
Assurance you were pleased
to give me that it was not
true, will do effectually.
It becomes not me, my Lord,
to suggest any Reflections to
kindle your displeasure for
this Invention, to which cer∣tainly
your Lordship owes no
great Acknowledgments: But
to decline all things that look
like Envy or Revenge, I
humbly implore on his be∣half,
your Pardon of the For∣gery;
and on my own, your
Permission to deal with this
Disputer. This perhaps some
may judge a bold Offer, in
one that pretends not great
Matters, to undertake the
Man of Gath; but I have no
dread of the formidable
bulk of his Name and Arms

(and some think, Most of
the famed Giants, were in∣deed
but Men of ordinary
stature.) For the Reputati∣on
of a great Disputant,
which my Assailant hath in
this Country, it signifies no
more with me, than that of a
good Cudgel-player, or Ma∣ster
of Fence: and what
this Doughty Man's Art and
Force is, I have seen so much,
as instructs me, that there is
no great reason to apprehend
mighty Dangers from his
Puissance. My Lord, I
have no contempt of any
Mans Parts or Person, that
keeps himself within the

bounds of Modesty and Ci∣vility:
but for those that
are confident, imperious,
abusive, and assuming, I
confess 'tis hard for me to
speak of them with much
Complement or respect.
And having taken the
boldness to say all this, some
perhaps may expect that I
should have the Duty and
Justice to say a great deal
more; and that I should ce∣lebrate
your Lordship after
the manner of Dedications:
But I began with reproving
one of those usual Vanities,
and shall not end in the pra∣ctice
of another. Those Epi∣stolary

Praises are mostly in∣tended
for little, and go for
nothing; For Flattery and
Poetick Youth have straind
them to such a ridiculous
height, that Wise men
judge of them by the same
measures, as they do the
Courtships of Common A∣mours.
I dare not therefore
offer your Gravity and Wis∣dom
such vulgar and obno∣xious
Trifles; but instead of
those Fooleries, I give your
Lordship the serious assu∣rance
of my affectionate Du∣ty,
with the most grateful ac∣knowledgment
of your Fa∣vours.
And that your aged

Head may be Crowned with
all the Blessings of a long
Time, and after that, with
the full Glories of an happy
Eternity, shall ever be the
Prayer of,
My Lord,
