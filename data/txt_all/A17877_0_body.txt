IN two things (right honorable) it is ge∣nerally agreed that man excels all other creatures, in reason, and speech: and in them by how much one man surpas∣seth an other, by so much the neerer he aspires to a celestiall essence.
Poesy in all kind of speaking is the

chiefe beginner, and maintayner of eloquence, not only helping the eare with the acquaintance of sweet num∣bers, but also raysing the minde to a more high and lofty conceite. For this end haue I studyed to induce a true forme of versefying into our lan∣guage: for the vulgar and vnarteficiall custome of riming hath I know de∣ter'd many excellent wits from the exercise of English Poesy. The obser∣uations which I haue gathered for this purpose, I humbly present to your Lordship, as to the noblest iudge of Poesy, and the most honorable pro∣tector of all industrious learning; which if your Honour shall vouchsafe

to receiue, who both in your publick, and priuate Poemes haue so deuinely crowned your fame, what man will dare to repine? or not striue to imi∣tate them? VVherefore with all hu∣mility I subiect my selfe and them to your gratious fauour, beseeching you in the noblenes of your mind to take in worth so simple a present, which by some worke drawne from my more serious studies, I will hereafter en∣deuour to ex∣cuse.
