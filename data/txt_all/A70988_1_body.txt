MADAM,
THe Great CYRUS now makes his second Address to Your Honour: his Former so prosper'd under Your Ladiships name, that He vows to think of no other Dedication. For at his first entrance into our Language, He resolv'd to cast himself at the feet of some Excellent Personage, whose Extra∣ction should be Illustrious as your own name of NEVILL (which con∣fessedly is as great as our Chronicles can boast of) and a Person accom∣plish'd with all the Titles of Honour, Knowledg, and Vertue, as well as those powerfull Ornaments of Nature. And at all these Capa∣cities He found himself bound to make choice of Your Ladiship: For He knew (if His Story met any Exception) You were best able to give him all the Protection your whole Sex could afford: And if there could be any possible Addition, He might safely ex∣pect it from your own Noble Lord, whose Learned Soul is so He∣roically ballanc'd, as at once might challenge both Aristotle and Her∣cules; and yet (which is stronger) conceals these Transcendencies from the Eye of the World, because He knows the World is now at worst, and incapable of Correption. Therefore (MADAM) I were strangely bold to present Your Ladiship with a common Romance: but all the judicious Witts I have met with, do assure me the GRAND CYRUS is a noble usefull Work; the Plots are deeper, the Turns and Changes much more frequent, the Disputes and Arguments farr stronger, than in other Compositions: For, the famous Author is not only a Scholar, a Traveler, and a Souldier, but one of the most eminent Wits of France, and in every page hath left some marks and impressions of his Spirit. The former Volume left CYRUS at the Block; This shews what means were us'd to preserve him, a Felicity which all good Princes have not enjoy'd. And amidst all, the Scenes of Honour amd Love are so twisted, that every Noble Lover may here meet his own Flame, and learn both how to manage and advance it till he reach his desires. But I trespass too much on your Ladiships precious minutes, which are still taken up by the noblest Considerations. My only hope is, that you that can so exactly judg, can also pardon
