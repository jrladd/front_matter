SIR,
AFTER I had travelled through the world in speculation, by translating and aug∣menting of ATLAS MAJOUR in English, dedicated to his most excellent Majesty your Vncle, & my dread Soveraign: I could give no rest unto my thoughts till I had undertaken some thing of my owne profession, which might give light, understanding, and instruction, unto some young Gentlemen, Souldiers and others, who desire to follow the warres, and to studie this Art Military, for their princes service, and the good of their Country. And where could I find a fitter place, and a better subject to worke upon, then in these Vnited Provinces, under the command of the Lords, the STATES GENE∣RALL, and his Highnesse the Prince of ORANGE, which now in regard of their long Warres may truly be called a nurcery, and sedes belli, for the breeding and trayning up of Souldiers, and verily how could I do better then to begin ad principium, with the very first principles, and rudiments of the Art Military, Practised in these Warres, under the command, first of Prince MAURICE, of blessed Memory, and now under the able conduct of that great and victorious Captain Generall of our age, his Highnesse the Prince of Orange his Brother. Now besides what experience my long service hath gayned vnder their Commaund, for the space of fortie yeeres, as an addition thereunto, I have got some translations and extracts out of the best and choisest Authors of our modern times, who have writ upon this subject, to give lustre unto it, and having before by the assistance of God, run through the first two parts: I have now also finished my third part, concerning all preparations and necessaries appertaining to an Army, and so to put an end unto this laborious work, For in my first part I promised the right honourable the Earle of Holland, and in my second part my noble Colonel, that I would go through the three whole parts, for the arming of a Souldier, de cap en pied, that is at all points, which now thanks be to God I have done, to the end, that such as may go into, his Majesties service, your Highnesses, or any other forrain State or Princes, may gaine some experience, and reape some benefit by my labours, which is, and was the principall thing I aymed at, For I hope, as old as I am, when these unhappy differences at home are reconciled, appeased and composed, that God, vvho leads the hearts of all Kings in his hand, as the Wa∣ter of brooks, will so direct his Majesties heart for your right, that his Majesty will assist your Highnesse, and turne his powerfull Armes another way, and make your Highnesse Generall of a brave Brittish Armie, for the vindicating of your injuries, and the recovery of your law∣full and antient rights and inheritances, against the usurpers thereof.
I will not trouble your Highnesse any longer with a tedious discourse, seeing my selfe, and thousands of true hearted Brittaines besides my self, (whensoever his sacred Majesty and our dread Soveraign shall lay his commands upon us) shall be all willing to fight in so just a quar∣rell, for your Highnesse, and lay our lives down at your feet, and your Queen mothers, for the regaining of your Highnesses Rights and Countries.
This third part then of the Principles of the Art Military, comes in all humility to pre∣sent it selfe unto your Highnesses gracious pratronage, that though it be mean in itself, yet it craves to comeforth to the view of the world, under your illustrious name, which if it may be acceptable unto your Highnesse, then I shall think my weak indevours happily sacrificed, and acknowledge my selfe much obliged to your Highnesse, and shall not onely be bound to pray unto the Lord of Hoasts, to honour and blesse your proceedings here in this world with happy successe, but also to crown you, your Royall Mother the Queen of Vertues, and her princely progenie with eternall felicity hereafter, beseeching your Highnesse to beleeve, that no creature living shall more heartily fight, nor more willingly die in your service, then
Sir,
