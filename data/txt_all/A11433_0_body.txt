SIR, this Tragicall history being no fiction, but a true relation of the many troubles of a distressed Queene, I offer to your patro∣nage for two especiall causes; the one, for the long continued loue betweene vs; the other, for that I know your name is a suffici∣ent protection for it and me, against the ma∣ny find-faults that this age is pestered with, who themselues being not able, or too idle to do any thing worth the reading, yet are composed of such a snarling substance, that nothing can escape their eye or eare with∣out a scoffe: how euer it displeaseth such, I care not; if it content you, I haue my desire,

not doubting but when you are wearied with more serious studies, you will at some times peruse this. And so I leaue you to liue happily.
