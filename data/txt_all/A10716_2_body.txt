IT may be (freend∣lie Reader) that thou wilt thinke my labour might very well haue beene spa∣red to write of any thing appertaininge to warres where euery man is desi∣rous to liue in peace, I knowe will rather purchase dislike then win mee looue, yet as I am not ignorant, that quiet peace is to be preferred before bloody warre, so in the time of peace, warlike disciplines must not be omit¦ted in a well gouerned common wealth, where so many euill neighbours are so readie to incroch but especially when both Prince, Countrie, religion, lawe, iustice, subiectes and altogether are vnder the protection of armes.
VVhere is become the dominions of the Assiri∣ans, Persians and Grecians, or what is become of the glory of that learned Citty of Athens, or what hath wasted the renowne of the Cittie of Rome that it had not beene perpetuall, but onely when in the time of peace, they fell to inordinate ryot and delicacie, neglecting the feates of war, laying aside their armes and weapons: For to doubt and feare

nothing was more hurtfull to common weales, then their very neighbour enimies, the feare of whome was their safety and assuraunce. For this cause Scipio though it vnnecessary that Carthage should vtterly be destroyed, fearing that after the subuersion, the Romaines leauing of their martiall mindes should fall to idlenes, ryot and outrage, and as he looked for so it came to passe, as it was testified after by Saint Augustine, who in a booke which he had written intituled, De ciuitate Dei, hath these wordes.
More hurtefull was the Citty of Carthage to Rome after hys distruction, then duringe the whole course & season of the warres whych the Romanes had wyth her, for that whylest they had enemyes in Affricke, they knewe not what vyces meant in Roome. In the time of peace therefore, there must be had speciall regarde to the disciplines of warre, and not onelie prouisions of warlike furnitures to be made, but also men of seruice and practised Souldiours to be had, releeued, and maintained: for what should you doo with armes, weapons, munitions and fur∣nitures, when you haue not men of experience to vse them King Phyllyp of Macedon vsed the lyke comparison to that noble Captaine Antipater in these wordes.
VVhat, fearest thou the Cittyzens of Athens, the Gallyes and theyr peere, are but trifles vnto mee, for what account is to be made of those fellowes that giue themselues to daunsinge, loytring, banqueting and

to belly cheere, but if Demostines onely were not a∣mongst them, I would sooner make account to winne Athens, then eyther Thebes, or Thessalia of which I am already possessed.
By these premisses it may be perceiued that it is the Souldiour, that protecteth the Prince in his seate, it is the Souldiour, that defendeth the Diuine in his pulpet, it is the Souldiour, that vpholdeth the Iudge in his place of Iustice, it is the Souldi∣our as Varo sayth, that resisteth the outward force of enemies, that represseth domesticall seditions, and defendeth the libertie of subiects: If his seruice be then so beneficiall to all, O what pitty, he is not better considered of by some, that are so bountiful in rewarding pipers, parasites, singers and dauncers and other like ministers of their pleasures, and suffer poore Souldiours to begge, and will sooner affoorde him a payer of stockes, then a single pen∣nie for his almes.
Epaminondas Captaine generall of the Thebanes, vndestanding of a very ritch man that had no care of the poore, sent a needy souldiour vnto him, cō∣maunding him vnder great penaltie to giue 600▪ crownes to this poore man, this Cittizen recei∣uing this commaundement, came to knowe the cause, it is (quod Epaminōdas because this man be∣ing honest is poore, and thou which hast liued by the spoyle of the common wealth art ritch. O that our Vsurers in England might sometime haue such messengers sent vnto them, I thinke

the errande would neither offen de God nor man: Neither can I see why there should not be a gene∣rall contribution giuen through the realme, for the mayntenaunce of men of warre, when theyr seruice concerneth such publique profit: The Prince is not able to recompence all, and the soul∣diour must fight in defence of all, why should hee not be maintained by the helpe of all.
But here some wil think I speake for my selfe, & I confesse it, souldiours must learne of other men to speake for them selues, for there is no body else that will: VVhat trade or handicrafte haue you so simple, but if it begin a little to decay, but by and by it pleades pouerty, runninge to the Prince or Parliament for releefe, eyther by repelling some statute, by making some priuiledge, or by attay∣ning some consideration: And if vppon any occa∣sion betweene Nations trafique be stopte, howe clamerous is the Marchaunt in the eares of hys Prynce, till hee hath his passage againe freely set open:
The Lawyer will permitte no Edicte to come forth that makes against his owne profit, though otherwise it be beneficial for the whole common wealth: The Deuine findes fault that their spiri∣tuall promotiones should so many wayes bee be∣reaued them, and (I thinke) complaineth of it not without some cause: If euery profession hauely∣bertie to say for them selues, giue souldiours leaue to speake, when by the vnkindnes of their coun∣trimen

they are brought to the worst, and yet as profitable members to their common wealth, as they that thinkes them selues best: Is it not the Souldiour by hasarding his life abroade, that vp∣holdeth the Artificer to sit quietly by his worke at home. And what would it auaile the Mar∣chaunt to speake for forraine gaine, if the souldi∣our were not to defende him from domesticall spoyle. The Lawyer makes no plea but for priuat profitte, and burldes goodly houses, and purcha∣seth whole countries about him.
The souldiour serues his countrye for a small stypende, and would be contended with alowance but to buie meate, drinke, and cloath: And that very religion which the deuine but coates downe in his quiet studie without any perill, that very re∣ligion the souldiour maintaineth with the losse of limme and life. How much more might heere be alleadged in the behalfe of souldiours and their seruice, yet these be they that the politique wyse man (him I meane) (that is better practised in Machauils policies, then studied in the new Tes∣tament) would haue to be kept vnder. But leauing prophane histories, out of the which great volums might be writtē, haue we not examples out of the holy Scriptures, howe valiant mindes haue beene rewarded, and men of seruice liberallie gratified: in the 14. Chapter of the booke of Numbers. Caleb was promised reward by Gods owne mouth for his owne constancie and couragious perswa∣sion

to the children of Israell: The same Caleb to gratifie Othuiel his brothers sonne, for takinge the Cittie Cariathe, bestowed of him his faier daughter Athsah: Dauid likewise receiued great ritches with the daughter of King Saule, for kil∣ling Goliah: Dauid him selfe promised great re∣wardes to such as should ouerthrowe the Iebusits, and Iesus the sonne of Syrach sayth: There be two thinges that greeue my hart, and in the thyrd is a displeasure come vpon mee, when an expert man of warre suffereth scarsenes and pouerty, when men of vnderstanding and wysedome are not set by, and whē one departes from righteousnes to sinne.
But is not that countrie to much vngratefull which hath no manner of remorse to those men whose blood hath scarletted the grownd so much to their glory, and no lesse to their preseruation: If souldiours must be had (as of necessity they must) how would you haue them liue, wyll you sette downe no course: Giue me leaue then to say my minde I speake but in sporte, but that it might come to passe I would wish in good earnest. Lea∣uing many presidentes, let vs fetch our example from the people of the lowe Countries, who bee∣ing generally giuen to drunkennes, hath such an excise imposed both of Beere and VVine, that it well neere suffiseth to pay all their souldiours du∣ring the time of the ciuill warres.
Now our people of England being as general∣lie giuen to inordinate lawing, if the like impositi∣on

might be raysed for euery action they should commence, for euery writte they should fetche foorth, and for euery sentence in lawe that should be pronounced with them both, or against them, no doubt it would maintaine a great many of soul¦diours to grade them, whereby they might the more safely follow theyr lawe, and when they had spent all amongst Lawyers (as a number of them already hath doone) they might haue some cul∣lour to craue gratification from the Prince or Country for theyr good seruice, as if you will beare with me, I will shewe you the like president. About tenne yeeres agoe, (vpon occasion) beinge in Hollande at a towne called Gorcum, a good fel∣low comming to the States, craued of them some recompence, for his indeuours, which (as he sayd) had beene wonderfully beneficial to their state and gouernement.
The States willing him to make repition of his seruice, and he should finde them ready to consi∣der of good desert, this good fellow then so well incouraged beginnes his tale.
It is not vnknowen (quod he) that within these seauen yeeres, I was worth 4000. Guilders, sithe which time vntill this present (so longe as I had one stiuer left) I am sure there is no man that euer sawe me goe sober to bed: Now gentlemen, if you will wisely consider of this, how beneficiall my drinking hath beene to your common purse of ex¦cyse, and not onely what my selfe haue spent of

mine owne, but also by my drawing in of many other good drinkers in my company, I doubt not but as you must confesse I haue beene a good member to my commen wealth, so you will not fayle to gratifie me, according to my desert.
Now, if the like excise were sette of the Lawe, why might not a fellowe that had beggerd him selfe by lawing, craue like consideration, and by as good desert: I speake not against the triall for title of landes, which I knowe must be decided by the verdit of a Quest, or the discretion of a Iudge, but I speake against these vnkindly Actions of Tres∣passe, commonly commenced for the speakinge of a word, for a neighbours goose that shall but looke ouer a hedge, and for other such like occa∣sions, wherein they will not sticke to spende more poundes, then for the releefe of a souldiour, or de∣fence of their countrye they are willinge to giue pence. But as it is necessary such clyentes should be a little wronge by the purses, so such counsay∣lers should not goe scotfree, that are the annima∣ters to such causes. I remember longe sithens, (when I was a little bookishe,) I reade a History in our English Chronicles, and although I canne not set you downe the place, yet as I can I will tell you the matter.
A Prince of this realme (vpon what occasion I knowe not) fined all the Lawiers of this lande, for their extortion bryberie and deceite, but to one a∣mongst the rest, that was found to be vncorrupted

there was giuen 300 pounds. If it pleased her ma∣iesty to followe this example, and to fine euery Lawyer but at tenne pound, that hath cozoned his countrimen at the least of renscoore, to them that shal be found free from corruption, she might double her beneuolence and make the three hun∣dred pound 600. in Gods name, and yet saue an honest portion for the maintenaunce of her wars: It was sometime though that one Lawyer, and one Gossehauke were enough in a whole shyre, and as Plato concludeth, it is a token of a corrupted estate, where there are many Lawyers, and manie Phisitions, because the multitude of Lawyers are maintained by the contention of people, and such store of Phisitions, by their excesse in dyet, drun∣kennes and gluttonie. But pardon me here I praie you, the tellinge of a merry tale that comes but nowe sodainelye in my minde, and thus at fol∣loweth.
There was sometime a Lawyer dwelling farre in the North that had serued a writ of a poore Cum¦berland man, for his appearaunce at VVestminster in the beginning of the next Terme, this poore mā for want of a horse comming to London on foot, and by the way as he passed, where he sawe a signe he was sure to finde meate, drinke, and lodging for his money, but comming to London, and by for∣tune hitting into Holburne, seeing a signe at euery mans doore, began to make doubte, and callinge to a Boye that passed by, asked him where hee





might finde an Inne, the Boy (disposed to play the wagge) pointes him to one of the Innes of Court, the poore fellow going in, and seeing many Ta∣bles couered in the Hall (for it was almost dinner time) thought with him selfe there was good cheere towardes, walkes vppe and downe, till the gentlemen came in, and sitting downe, he fell in amongst them to the Table, the Steward (who to see good orders) perceiuing one without a gowne and a cappe, comes to him and telles him howe that was no place for him, and willes him to arise, the poore man aunswers him, gude fellowe I ha siller in my purse ayse pay for what I take, but the Steward seeing his simplicite and how he was de∣ceiued, aunswers him againe, my freend this is no place for you to spend your siller in, this is for gentlemen Lawyers, and there comes no other here but such the poore fellow heering his words arose from the boorde, and in a great chafe aun∣swereth thus.
Now the foule ill tae them, be all thure lawyers, marry had I kende that, I had rather haue eate no breade these two daies, then haue come amonge sayke a company; thus as he was hastily goinge forth of the doores, the gentlemen sporting at his folly, followed him laughing, which when he per∣ceiued, calling to the porter he sayd, ay say, my gude fellowe slot to the doore, by the bread a gad and all thure may once breake out, there is neere a poore man in England that shall liue in whayet

by them. Now here letting slippe the simplicity of a Clowne, let vs returne againe to speake of soul∣diours, who as they are little prouided for in the time of peace, so they are as smally cared for in the season of warre, and this is not a little to bee meruailed at, that when any occasion of seruice dooth happen, some bee appointed for Captaines as knowes not how to place 100. men in good or∣der of araye, vnlesse it be (peraduenture) to marche them 3, or 5. in a rancke, as they vse to fetch home a may pole.
VVee doo finde in the holy scriptures and that in seuerall places, both in the bookes of Moyses, in the booke of Iosua and others, where they haue vsed not litle regard aswell in the chosing of their Captaines, leaders and conductors, as also in pre∣scribing lawes and disciplines of warre, which sometimes were appointed by the almighty God him selfe: Phillip King of Macedonia, did mer∣uaile why the Athenians did euerye yeere choose newe Generalles and Captaines of the wars, when he him selfe had found but one good, namely Per∣menyo: Alexander admitted none to the roome of a Captaine vnder the age of 60.
But in England, wee neuer number his yeeres, we neither consider his knowledg, we little regard his worthines, we lesse esteeme his experience, wee scarce examine his honestye: Our Captaines are appointed, more for fauour then for know∣ledge, more for feendshippe then for experience,

more for opinion then for desert: God graunt wee neuer come to make triall of the seruice of suche Captaines as I haue seene some, if wee should, there were great feare of vnhappy successe.
And this is to bee lamented amongst vs, that wee can bee so prouident in matters of no impor∣taunce, and such causes where in our owne safeties dooth especially consist, wee eyther neglect them altogether, or else performe them with little care and lesse foresight. If the matter were well exami∣ned we should finde that the safety both of Prince state, country, subiects, and altogether consisted in the worthines of the Captaine: and to this most fitly agreed the saying of that noble souldiour Sir VVylliam Drury, who many times woulde vse these wordes.
The want of a horsse shooe nayle, may bee the losse of the shooe, the losse of the shooe, the spoile of the horsse, the spoyle of the horsse, the losse of the man: the losse of a man, the ouerthrowe of an army: the ouerthrowe of an army, the losse of a Princes crowne: If small thinges thus by degrees, may conclude suche great preiudice in the wyn∣ding vppe, (as it can not bee denayde) what suc∣cesse is to be looked for, where captaines and lea∣ders are so vtterly ignoraunt, that many of them knowes not when it is time to charge, nere when it were good to retire: and as Socrates saith, the boldenes of the ignoraunt ingendreth manye euilles, and Agesilaus affyrmeth, the lacke of expe∣ryence

breedeth the lacke of corage: And as histories make mencion, more feeldes haue beene loste for wante of gouernement, then for want of strength.
To giue a braue charge, is a thing proper to e∣uery ordinarie souldiour, but to make a good re∣treat in time, & in order, therin consisteth the skill of the Captaine: The vnexpert Captaine, and the vnlearned phisition, doo buy their experience at to deere a rate, for it is still purchased, with the price of mens liues: The place of a Captaine is honou∣rable, and ought not to bee giuen but to men of experience, of valiaunce, and of vertue, and yet I haue heard tell, where they haue beene made mar∣chandyse of, and bought and solde for money, but I dare not say that I haue knowen it my selfe, for paraduenture I should offend.
But I hope souldiours shall not bee still illegiti∣mate, they shall be esteemed accordinge to desert. The Deuine for tellinge a learned discourse in a Pulpette is rewarded with a Bishopricke, and but accordinge as hee is worthy, the Lawyer for makinge a good Plea at the Barre, is brought to the Benche, and it is doone wyth conside∣ration.
The Souldiour that watches, that wardes, that trauelles, that toyles, that makes hys bo∣dye a defence for Cannon shotte, and feareth no perrylles for the looue of hys Countrye,

I trust will be better considered of God hath won¦derfully blessed vs with sweete and quiet peace but let vs not be secure, as though we had it by pat∣ten we haue enemies abroade if they had oportu∣nitie, but take heede of papistes here at home, they are more to be feared, then hee that was borne in Spayne.
Haue they not made sundry profers to stirre vp seditious tumultes, nay what doo they leaue vn∣attempted, to disturbe this happye gouernement: But would you haue some speciall markes howe you may knowe them, then listen, and by these meanes you may easely smell them out: You shall haue them inquiring of newes, spreading of rumours, lying, forging, counterfeiting and dis∣sembling, what action hath there beene so honou∣raly performed, sithe that noble Earle of Leicester vndertooke these lowe country seruices, whych hath not beene defaced (heere at home) by our slaundering Papistes.
VVhat good newes hath there come ouer which they haue not paraphrased, what enterprise so iust¦ly attempted, which they haue not eclipsed, or what exployt so brauely accomplished, which they haue not methamorphised: Such is the deuo∣tion of our religious Catholiques, that they straine no curtesie to forge lyes, to practise treasons, to commit murthers, to stirre vppe rebellions, nay what outrage is there so mischeeuous, which they wil not enter into to doo their holy father seruice.

These be their workes meritorious which so ma∣ny times they boast of, and by this ladder they thinke to clime vp to heauen gates, where saint Peter standes watching ready to let them in. O how many vngodly practises, haue they intended against our most gratious princesse, how are they continually busied in conspiring against her: but that almighty God who first planted her to their subuersion, hath not fayled still to protect her (no doubt) to their confusion. VVere not the furie that ouerruleth them more then extreame, they could not be such enemies to their owne discreti∣on, but that they might well discerne, it is Gods blessing, that so mightely defendeth her against the Popes cursing, and although his holines hath taken great paines, in sending foorth his Iesuits, his Seminaries and other his ministers (from time to time) with so many conspiracies, and such se∣uerall practises against her maiesty, yet at their departure when they come to craue his fatherlye benediction, (God be thanked) he blesseth them al to the gallowes.
And although that accidentes are many times sufficient to serue their turne, either to confirme, eyther to confound religion according to the e∣uent, I wonder they cannot aswell condemne a Papist in his ill successe that is sent ouer with so many hallowed bulles, as they will doo a protes∣tante, for the least misfortune that may befal him, but if this light were sufficient for men to iudge

cullours by, who more blessed then our gratious Elizabeth who so happily hath raigned ouer vs this 28. yeeres, how mightily hath God preserued her, from the conspiracies of Popish traytors, howe many forraine princes haue sought to her for succours, that like as auncient Rome (while the gouernement rested in the souldiour) was the ve∣rie refuge for such as were distressed by oppressing Tyrantes, so the greatest parte of Christendome, hath thought their states the better assured, when they haue combyned with her Maiestye, and shrowded them selues vnder her gratious protec∣tion, with what peaceable gouernement hath she continued her subiectes, how hath England flori∣shed sithe she became our soueraigne, what would you more, of her selfe she is mercifull, her noble Counsaylers carefull, her loouing subiects duti∣full, that to conclude, if these presidents be testimo¦nies of the looue of God (as without all question they are) then O thrice happy England that doost enioy so excellent a Princesse.
Nowe contrary wise, let vs but consider of the Popes best belooued the King of Spaine, howe hath he beene shaken in the most partes of his do∣minions, his Indies (the fayrest flower in his Gar∣land) the inhabitantes whereof, are so oppressed with the tyrannie of the Spanish gouernement, that they let not daily to enter into rebellion, see∣king all meanes to shake of that seruitude, by rea∣son whereof, the great summes of treasure hee

was wont to receiue out of those partes, beginnes to deminish, and is like to decrease euery day lesse then other: For the regimentes in Italy, who knowes not how discontentedly they endure the Spanish gouernement, but the garrisons so keepes them vnder, that the poore Italians must bee con∣tented for a time to beare the burthen, although it be so much against their willes.
In Spayne it selfe, the Gospell of our sauiour Ie∣sus Christ hath taken such effect in the hartes of a multitude, that the King is busied in nothinge more then in keeping vnder of his Protestantes and questionles, as it hath pleased God to suffer it to take rooting, so in time it will bring foorth fru∣tes, let my maisters of the holye house looke to it as wisely as they can.
The tyrannie the Spaniardes vsed in the lowe countries, the cause of the peoples reuolt, is so wel¦knowen to all, as I should but waste the time to make a new repitition, but this I may not omitte that the King of Spayne (beeing so mighty a mo∣narche as they would make him) could not by force of honourable warre, in so many yeeres sub∣due the poore prince of Orange, but in the ende setting aside all dignitie, honour and reputation be fitting a King (in most shamefull and infamous maner) practised his death by murther, the mater is so fresh in memory, as I neede spend no loger time to repeate it: Be these the examples of Christian humanitie, nay vndoubted confirmations of Tur∣kysh

tyranie, but (as they say) such Carpenters such chippes, such Saintes, such reliques, such tree such fruite, euen so it may be sayd, such quarrell, such conquest, And hath not the Prince of Per∣ma, made the like conquest in recoueringe againe of Sutphen Scance, and in taking of Deuentre: the one the Earle of Leycester wonne from him by ho∣nourable and braue assault, the Prince beeing at at hand with his whole force within the hering of the battery, so that it cannot be sayd it was stolne vpon him, Deuentre in like case (hanging but in doubtfull Ballaunce) was asured by the Earle, at that very instante whiles hee laye before Sut∣phen: neyther practised by deceipte nor compas∣sed by trechery, but perfourmed by honourable polycie, the Prince beeing in the fielde and had continuall intelligence of euery action that was attempted, so that it may bee sayd, euery thing was doone before hys face: But hee taking hys time whyle the Earle was out of the Country, re∣couered them againe by the lyke stratageme, as he vseth to atrayne the rest of his conquestes, which are euer obtained by tyrrannie, by treason, by cor∣ruption, by murther, and by such other deuillishe practyses, both detestable before God, and disho∣nourable amongst men: but thys is best befittinge men of theyr religion, and iumpe correspondent to theyr holy fathers doctrine.
I would nor here bee mistaken, neyther doo I meane (by any thinge before sayde) that where a

Prince is perturbed by warre of otherwise, that such euentes are for tokens of the displeasure of God towardes him, but this I inferre, that where the cause of such troubles doo proceede through hys owne tyrannie, although, I knowe the Pope may well bestowe his blessing in such a cause, yet God with his owne mouth hath cursed the cruel∣tie of such oppressours, and the executours of so notorious outrage.
There resteth nowe no more, but that wee bee prouident for our owne safeties, our enemies lookes about, they watche but oportunity, let vs bee as vigillant, least they happe to catche vs nap∣ping, the enemie is by no meanes sooner repuls∣sed, then when he shall perceiue we be already wel prouided for him: wee haue already committed some errours and a little troden awrie, we haue let slip oportunities, we haue fostered serpents in our owne bosomes, and although they haue bitten vs yet we can not beware, but let vs lament follyes vnder more couert termes, for the worlde is giuen to see too much, our cōtinued peace hath bene the nourisher of many vices, we haue entertained pride newe fangled fashion, and monsterous atire, what extortion is found to bee in the mighty, what op∣pression in the wealthy, what vnsariable desire of hauing, what vnreasonable practise in gettinge. VVhat corruption of such as giue bribes, what persurie of such as take bribes, what buying of othes in the one, what selling of conscience in the

other VVhat greedy speaking Lawe against Ius∣tice, what deuillish counsaile giuen for money a∣gainst lawe, what enuy in the clyent, what crafte in the counsayler, what couetousnesse in bothe: VVhat impyetie in tale herers, what impunity in tale tellers, what mallice in the one to seeke them, what flattery in the other to bringe them.
VVhat pride and disdaine in the higher sorte, what stubburne disobedience in the lower sorte, what lacke of looue in the one, what neglect of duety in the other, what frowarde hart in bothe: VVhat makinge and repellinge of many lawes, what contempt and breach of all lawes, howe ma∣ny Iustices in euery place, what wante of Iustice in all places.
VVhat Marchandyse is made of lawe, what buyinge and sellinge of Iustice, Offyces that were wont to bee rewardes of good desert is nowe set to bargaine and sale for who wyll giue most, yea the blood of poore innocentes is sometime bought and solde for money: The honesty of the suter is not regarded, the equitie of his cause is not examined, if hee wyll bestowe any Crownes they shall bee viewed: wee punishe iniuryes of∣fered to ourselues, but wee omitte such offen∣ces as are dyrectlie against the honour of God, if thys that I haue sayde bee not enough, to say any more would bee to much. I wyll therefore conclude, humbly beseechynge God longe to pre∣serue

her Maiestye to raygne ouer vs, God con∣founde her foes and bringe to lyght all Popishe Conspirators, and Trayterous confederates that practyse agaynst her. God so blesse her no∣ble Counsaylers that in all theyr consultations, they may determine nothyng but that may redounde to the safetye, honour and renowne of noble England.
Amen.
