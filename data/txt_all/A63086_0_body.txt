MY LORD,
WITH conscious Fear my Muse approaches You,
Wit's ablest Iudge, and best Example too.
In Modesty your sight she should decline;
The only Barren Thing on which You shine!
To Your's Aspiring, and her Countrey's Praise,
Deserting Strength her ripe Design betrays.
Yet see how Duty, with resistless Spells,
To fresh Attempts a Loyal Heart Compels!
Since Britain's Worthies their just Orbs sustain,
And loud Applause resounds from ev'ry Plain;
Our British Bards the only silent Throng;
Rage hurry'd me on this advent'rous Song.
But oh! my Zeal forgot such Themes requir'd,
The Force and Fury of a Breast Inspir'd.
Yet these weak Streins may to a Nobler Flight
Provoke those Muses whom they can't invite.
To Them shall, safely, Fame these Figures trust,
Whose Lustre is in my dead Colours lost.
How warmly They each Character shall trace,
Set off with proper Lights and Native Grace!
Then higher Soar, and urging their Success,
Our great Augustus Court to life express;
In which Illustrious Sphere, with Forms Divine,
Shall our Agrippa and Mecaenas Shine.
That Work commenc'd, how pleas'd shall I Retire!
And at just Distance silently Admire;
Content and Proud the Skilful to have mov'd,
And see my rude Design so well improv'd.
Ev'n so blind Chance, the Art of Musick found,
A rusling Wind amongst the Reeds did sound;
That Noise Instructed Shepherds first to Frame
The Tuneful Pipe, that since gave Shepherds Fame.
