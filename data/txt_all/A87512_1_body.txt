Reverend Sir,
WE have met this day to debate whether there be any course warranted by the Word wherein Ministers may proceed to the administration of the Sacra∣ment, as our case now stands, and what that is? We earnestly desire that you would be pleased to take the Question into your serious consideration, and to give your thoughts on it, or rather the state of it the fourth of July next ensuing, when we intend to meet again to consult farther a∣bout that thing. And we are the rather inclined to desire your particular resolution therein; Because we understand that you have administred that Sacrament, and therefore doubt not but you have some way satisfied your self therein, which we earnestly desire that you would be pleased to impart unto

Taunton, June 13. 1649.
