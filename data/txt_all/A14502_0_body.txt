THis Dedicatory custome (as Lactantius testifies) hath beene since the time of Iu∣piter, and as I conceiue) will con∣tinue during the time of Iupiter, that is, the Planet so called, the ra∣ther for that a booke set forth
without a Dedication, doth inti∣mate or raise a suspition in the Reader, that the Author studies de∣stitute (as one vnworhy of a Mecoe∣nas. For which cause, when I had finished this Translation accor∣ding to my slender skill and weak wit, whereof I may say with Ouid,
