Madam,
I Have made bold to put your name,
In front of this small work, to grace the same.
Your superscription fixed in its bonnet,
I hope will cause some good men look upon it.
It's a designe in me I must confesse,
To use your name, and make you Patronesse:
That (worthlesse in it selfe, yet) it may passe,
And have the splendor of a burning glasse.
Which from the eye of heaven borrowing flame,
Shines and burnes out by vertue of the same. Madam,
In this same treatise you shall finde
Description of a Drunkard in his kinde.
Out of his robes you have him here quite stript,
And naked laid, for to be lasht and whipt:
His face is so unvailed with his cloathing,
That possibly the sight may cause a loathing.
And if it chance one soule but for to gaine,
I shall not count it labour spent in vaine.
Madam,
