Most Honoured Sir,
THE store of a good Scribe is (according to our Saviour) both old & new.
I would (if I durst) be ambitious of this only honour. Having therefore
drawn forth those not frivolous thoughts out of the Old Testament,
I fetch these following from the New. God is the same in both; as
the body differs not with the age of the sute, with the change of robes.
The old and new wine of holy Truth came both out of one vineyard; yet here may
we safely say to the Word of his Father, as was said to the Bridegroom of Cana,
 Thou hast kept the best wine till the last. The authority of both is equally saâˆ£cred:
the use admits no lesse difference then is betwixt a Saviour fore shadowed
and come. The intermission of those military imployments which have wone you just
honour, both in forrain nations and at home, is in this onely gainfull, that it yields
you leisure to these happy thoughts, which shall more fully acquaint you with him
that is at once the God of Hosts and the Prince of Peace. To the furtherance whereof
these my poor labours shall doe no thankless offices. In lieu of your noble favours to
me both at home and where you have merited command, nothing can be returned
but humble acknowledgments, and hearty prayers for the increase of your Honour,
and all Happiness to your self and your thrice-worthy and vertuous Lady, by him
 that is deeply obliged and truly devoted to you both,
