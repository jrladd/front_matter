LAdy to whom my true deuoted loue,
Hath been engadgd, in more then wit can pay,
Which to discharge, the more I still haue stroue,
The more in deepe arrearedge euery day.
So much from me, vnto your selfe is due,
That all my thoughts, vnto the debt must runne,
Yet is there more remaining vnto you,
And as these crosd, so others are begun.
Dearest of dearest: take in thankefull part,
This sacrifice, which may my will approoue:
Vppon the Aulter of a faithfull heart,
Consumed in the flames of zeale and loue.
True honourable Virgin, euer liue,
In all that arte, that time, that fame can giue.
