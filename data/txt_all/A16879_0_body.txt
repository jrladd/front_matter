I Haue studied (right Ho∣nourable)
what way I
might manifest my thāk∣full
minde, for the excee∣ding
fauours, wherewith
I and mine are bound vn∣to
your house for euer. I finde none more
likely, then if I might adde somewhat (af∣ter
the faithfull and happy trauels of o∣thers)
to your present and immortall ho∣nour.
Considering therefore, that the God
of heauen, hath set you in so high a place,
not onely in his owne eye, but also in the
view of your countrey, to be beholden of
all, as a marke, for the saluation or per∣dition
of very many, and that little faults
in your Honour, must needs much blemish




you, as a vertuous life shall make you glo∣rious:
I haue indeuored for my part to
put into your handes a true glasse and per∣fect
mappe:Iam. 1. 25., a glasse which will not flatter
you in shewing your spotts, because it is the
Lordes, a mappe which will not deceiue
you, for the narrow way of life, because it
is bounded by the Lord himselfe, troden
by our Sauiour, with all his holy Saintes,
which haue gone before you; yet so small
as you may euer carrie in your bosome.
My humble suite at the hāds of the Lord
and your honour is this, that when you
haue tried them to bee such, (where the
superstitious Papists spend some houres in
blind deuotions) you would bind your selfe
by a constant vow before the Lord, to spēd
but one houre weekely, besides other your
holy exercises, in vewing your selfe in
this Christal glasse,Iam. 1. 23. 24. 25. desirous to clense your
spotts hereby; and to consider your waies
according to this map,Psal. 119. 59. labouring so to di∣rect
your steppes: for setting your selfe
with resolute purpose of heartActs. 11. 23. to walke
herein all your dayes, you haue the Lords




owne promise, that he will make you tru∣ly
honorable in the sight of all men,1. King. 3. 11. 12. 13. as e∣uer
was any of your Progenitors, so as your
very enemies shall acknowledge it,Dent. 4. 6. 7. & 28, 10. 11. 12. 13. and hee
afraid of you: and that he will moreouer
prolong your dayes, and giue you a gard
of his glorious Angels for your safetie,Psa. 91. 11. 12. and 34. 7. to
beare you in their handes in the day time,
and in the night season, when you are se∣cure,
to pitch their tents about you: your
country shall bee blessed, that euer God
vouchsafed such a light vnto it.1. King. 10. 8. 9. Where any
point seemes doubtfull there make a
marke.Phil. 3. 15. walke in the rest vntill the Lorde
cleare that vnto you. As this shall adde
vnto mee ioy,2. Ioh. 1. 2. 3. 4. so for thousands which now
pray for the encrease of this honour, manie
times ten thousands shall euer praise the
God of heauen for you. Now is the time,
all mens eyes are vpon you. Your honor
knoweth the prouerbe well. Magistratus
virum indicat. Striue forward cheereful∣ly
(most noble Earle) in this narrow waie
of life,Mat. 7. 14. according to the hopes now long
conceiued of you, following herein all the




worthies of the heauenly Hierusalem,Apoc. 21. 26. 27. and
you shall liue with them immortallie; but
if you should turne to the broad waie of all
the worlde (which the Lord forbid) you
must perish with the world eternally.Apoc 22. 14. 15. Mat. 7. 13. The
Angell hath sworne it,Mar. 8. 38. Time shall be no
more,Apo. 10. 6. but how soone it is vnknowne vnto
you.Luk. 12. 20. 21. 34. 35. 36. Take it now while it is called to daie;Heb 3. 7. 13
paie your vowes and shine for euermore.
Dan. 12. 3.Psal. 56. 12. & 50. 14.
