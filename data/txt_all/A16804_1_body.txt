LAdies and Gentlewomen, or other well disposed what soeuer: I haue (in your commendations) saide as much as I hope you will deserue: and more then I thinke hath beene said for you this great while. Nowe if yet thinke that I haue said, is said for flatterie, you should shewe me little fauour. For to flatter all, I should but haue a floute of a number: and to speake well of all, I hope will make none mine enemie. I craue no frther friendship then I deserue, nor greater thankes, then may requite good will, which wisheth well to ye all, that are well minded: and if you thinke I haue saide tru∣lie, in that I haue written, thanke your selues for giuing so good occasion: if contrarie▪ doo your endeuonr to make good what I haue saide, and will bee glad to see: and so rest, ready to do you agreater seruice. From my chamber, in the Blacke Fryers.

FINIS.
