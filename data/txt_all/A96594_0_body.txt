Sheweth,
THAT he is most strictly obliged, and indispensa∣bly bound as he is sent a messenger from God to instruct his people, and called by His late Ma∣jesty, his most gracious Master, and now most Glorious Martyr, Charles the first, of ever blessed memory, to be the Bishop of Ossorie, to declare, and make Remonstrance unto Your Majesty, to the now-Convened Parliament, and to all Posterity, these few Subsequent things. As,
First, that ever since 1625. I lived with my ever-honoured Lord, and Master, the Earl of Pembroke and Mountgomery, for the most part, in His Majestie's house at the Cock-Pit, about the space of eighteen years together, and about seven years of that time,
in His Majestie's service; and in that respect I had fitter oppor∣tunity to observe His Majestie, and to understand the affairs, and Trans-actions of the Court better then most others of His Ma∣jestie's Chaplains, that waited only their accustomed Moneth, and then returned to their residence. And mine Obligations to His late Majestie are so many, and so great, that I cannot with the best of mine endeavours discharge the Dimidium of those duties, that low to the blessed memory of that King; for he gave me all that I had, and all that I have, and had not the late Arch Bishop of Canterbury provided, and commended to His Majestie a far better, and abler man every way then my self, His Majestie intended to make me the Teacher, and Tutour to Your Majestie, as I heard it from His own mouth when my ever Honoured Lord, and Master, the Earl of Pembroke, and Mountgomery, brought me to examine His Son, and my Scholar, the Lord Charles Herbert before His Maje∣stie. And therefore I conceive, that I am more obliged, and bound in Conscience, to declare what I do infallibly know to be truth, to perpetuate the understanding thereof, unto Posterities, and to undeceive the Ignorant, and Simplest sort of people, that know not things aright, but, in hearing the lying reports of most Malicious men, do swallow down the same for truths; then ma∣ny others of His late Majestie's Chaplains.
And I call the great God of Heaven, and the Searcher of all hearts to be my witness, that what I do, is neither out of Envie, Hatred, or Malice to any particular man; or to Flatter, and to Insinu∣ate my self into the favour of any one the greatest man living; or for the hope, and expectation, of any benefit, or Preferment in the World; whereas I never did, nor ever intended, to desire any thing of Your Majestie, or of any other, but onely to retain, and to enjoy what our late Pious King, and my most gracious Master, hath given me; because that, although I was Plundered in England, and Plundered in Wales, and Sequestred of all my Means both in England, and Wales, and had not left me one peny of any Ecclesiastical Means, nor twenty Pound per annum, in all the World, to maintain my self, and my Servants, of any Temporal Estate; so that I was forced for these twelve last years, and more, to live upon a little Tenement, for which I payed fifty shillings rent to Sir Gr. Williams, and four Pound land by the year of mine
own, poorer then poor Curates, with Oaten-Bread, and Barly-Bread, and a little Butter-Milk, or Glas-Door, and sometimes Water, being not able to keep any drop of Ale, or Beer in my house for these two lustra's of years, and more, as all my Neighbours know; and to go attired in very mean Country Cloaths, and to do many servile works my self, about my House, Garden, and Cattel, for want of means to hire labourers; yet for all this my sad condition, lest I should be ensnared, and hindred to dis∣charge my duty, and my tongue entangled with such Bird-lime, I resolved to accept of no means, benevolence, or maintenance from the Usurpers, Rebels, and the Robbers of the Church of Christ, and of their brethren, whatsoever they should offer unto me, and how great soever my wants should be; as, being contented, with the Apostle, with any state, or condition, whatsoever, and hoping, that, as the Poet said of Pompey,
Non me videre superbum
Prospera fatorum; so— Nec fractum adversa videbunt.
But what I say herein, I do it onely to demonstrate the truth of things, not to those, that knew His Majestie, which were needless, but to those, that knew Him not, and upon mis-appre∣hension of His Majesties action's, related by Malicious Adversaries misunderstood the same, and made a simple conversion of White to Black, and of Good to Evil. For,
As I shall answer for what I say, at the Dreadfull day of Judg∣ment, I do here profess, that in all mine Observation of what I saw, and what I heard, of the Lords, and Gentlemen of His Court, in so many years, as they know I lived therein, which was, ever since King James died, till the Wars began, I knew neither Lord, nor Knight, nor Gentleman, nor any other man whatsoever, nei∣ther have I read in any Historie, Greek, or Latine, of any Empe∣rour, or King, I will not except Constantine, nor Theodosius, nor St. Edward of Ingland, that was a juster King, a wiser Governour, and a better man, then King Charles, that was so Pious in his Devotions, so just and upright in all His Actions, so sweet in His Disposition, so loving to His Friends, so mild to His Servants,
so ready to forgive His Enemies, and so free from all revenge for His greatest wrongs, that when His own Subjects, and Servants, so Undutifully, and Maliciously, Rebelled, and Warred against Him, and bespotted His Innocent Conversation, and pure Life, with most false, and venomous Aspersions, I heard him say, I thank God, I can freely forgive all my Enemies, and I pray God, that God would forgive them: and I dare boldly affirm it, and can justifie it, that He was as good a Protestant, if not the best Protestant in all the Christian World, and, I am sure, the best Protestant King, or Prince, that ever England saw; who, when I came unto Him, immediately after Edg-Hill-fight, and said, that whatsoever other∣wise, we wanted in our Abilities, yet our Prayers should never be wanting, to beseech the Almighty God, night and day, to bless Him, and to protect Him from all His Adversaries, He an∣swered, that He thanked us for our Prayers, and desired us to continue our Prayers still, as He hoped we would do, for Him; because He suffered all this War, and whatsoever else should be∣tide Him, for our sake, and for the defence of the true Protestant Religion, as it was Established in the Church of England, and for the preservation of the known Laws of these Kingdoms: and all the while I lived in His Court, I never saw the man, Clergy, or Laity, that shewed himself so punctually professing the Pro∣testant Religion, and so zealously, and regularly, observing the true service of God, as His gracious Majestie.
What other Character I should give to this most excellent Prince, for a loving faithfull Husband to His Queen, and for a dear indulgent Father to all His Children, His goodness therein is very very far beyond my ability of Expression; as it is indeed in all the other particulars: so that the praise, and Eulogie, which Homer gave to Achilles, and Ulysses, Virgil to Aenaeas, Xenophon to his Cyrus, Eusebius to Constantine, and Osorius to Emmanuel King of Portu∣gal, I may truly ascribe to Him, or rather what the Prophet Jeremy, and the Son of Sirach saith of the good King Josias, or the Scripture of King David, that he was a man according to God's own heart, so I hope, and believe, that I may say with out mistake, without offence, that King Charles the First was a man according to God's own heart, and though, as Christ non dimidiavit dies suos, so God did soon bring this good King to His death, that He might be soon
delivered from the contradictions of Sinners, and soon brought to enjoy the glorious Crown of Eternal life, yet was He most blessed, both in His life, and death, as hereafter I shall more fully shew unto you. And therefore I had rather say no more, then to say too too little, as I shall, when I say my best of this most gracious, and now most glorious King, Charles the First.
And though he was so good, so gracious, and so pious a King; yet this good, gracious, and incomparably pious Protestant King, the gentlest, meekest, and of the sweetest disposition of all the men I ever saw, was, as you well know, most rebelliously Warred a∣gainst, most Judas-like sold, most treacherously betrayed, and most maliciously, Barbarously, and, for the spiteful mischeivous manner thereof, most Jewishly, and unexpressably Murthered; and many more Noble-men, and Gentle-men, Clergy, and Laity, Mur∣thered in like manner, onely for His sake, and for the truth of their Loyalty unto Him, and their Fidelity unto God, as I have My∣stically, and yet fully shewed in my Book of The great Anti-Christ revealed, and in these Treatises following.
And can any thing so fowly defile the Land, and so highly provoke the Wrath, and Indignation of God against his people, as the shedding of so much Innocent Blood? or shall we think, that the just God will rest satisfied, and contented, to have his Wrath appeased (especially, if we consider what he saith to the three sons of Noah, Gen. ix. 5, 6. and of the Bloody sins of Manasses, 2 King. xxiv. 4. and to Ahab for letting Benhadad to escape, 1 King. xx. 42.) when he seeth the pretious Blood of so Good, so Gracious, and so Pious a King, His own Vicegerent, and the Blood of so many faithfull Christians, Noble-men, Gentle-men, and other loyal Subjects, that have lost their lives, for their constancie in pro∣fessing the true service of God, the right Faith of Christ, and their duty, and loyalty to their true, and lawfull King, left un∣expiated, and according to the Law of justice, unrevenged, and unpunished?
The truth of God saith, Not so: therefore His now gracious Majestie, lest His filiall affection of so good, and so loving a Fa∣ther, and His anger, and indignation against such monstrous Mur∣therers might seem to transport Him with Passion to be over∣partial, too rigid, and too severe, in His censure, against these
Murderers, did, most wisely, religiously, and Christian-like transmit the Judgment, and Punishment of these transcendent Malefactours to his Parliament, who, as he knew, had infinitely suffered most unspeakable Detriment, and Dammage, as well, though not near the like, nor so much as himself, in the loss of their so good a King.
And the late Parliament, that was, The Keepers of the Liber∣ties of Ingland by the Authority of our Parliament (and you may compute, what Number of Arithmetical Letters this name contained) and had very many of the King's Enemies in it (and therefore likely not to do all things so well, as they should do) yet hath it most gallantly, religiously, and justly sentenced ma∣ny of them to death, and the just God, without Question, doth most propitiously accept, and approve of all those their doings, which are just according to his own Precepts.
But though herein, they have done very well; yet do you think, that they have done sufficiently well? I will not presume to teach them, that, in State Affairs, are better able to be my Teachers, then I to advise their Wisdoms, what they ought to have done; yet, as I am , I must humbly crave leave to set down, what I conceive to be the just Will of God herein; and that is, that all, and every one, that had any hand, or finger in that good King's Death, or in the death of any of those His good Subjects, that were unjustly, and illegally sentenced to death, (I do not speak of them, that were killed in the War; because, as the Poet Lucan saith, Pharsal. lib. 1.
Victrix causa Diis placuit, sed victa Catoni. And as the Prophet David saith, The Sword devoureth the one, as well as the other: but of those, that in cold blood, by usu ping Judges, under the Colour of Law, were contrary to the Laws, both of God, and of the Land, most unjustly condemned unto death) should, for that their unjust Proceedings, be justly que∣stioned, and legally tryed for their former Offence; the same being of so high a Nature, as I shewed to you before.
But you will say, many of them, as blinde Bartimaeus might easily see, that acted very highly against the last King, and, as it is
conceived, had their hands deep in his death, were as active, as any others, and most special Instruments, to bring His now Sa∣cred Majesty unto His Right, whereby, they have fully expiated their foul offence, and deserve rather to be well rewarded and ho∣noured, as some say they are, then any ways questioned, as their Adversaries would have them to be.
I answer, that His Majesty is wise, as the Angel of God, and knoweth best, what he should best do; and the Policy of State, is far beyond the Sphere of mine Intelligence, and their doings therein ought highly to be commended, and deserve not mean∣ly to be rewarded; though, as Will. Sommers told King Henry the Eight, that such a Gentleman threatned to kill him, and the King answered, that, if he killed him, he would have him hanged for it; Will. Sommers replied, Nay good King, let him be hanged before he kills me, or else, his death will not preserve my life, and his hanging will do me no good: so I heard some say, that they would have had the Enemies of the last King first punished for their Rebellion, and the Murder of Him; and then rewarded for their good Service to His now gracious Majesty, or else, re∣ward them well for their good Service done to our now gracious King, and then question them, and punish them answerable to their Deserts, for their Disloyalty, and Treachery to our late King; as I read it in the Turkish History, and in some other Historians, of some very wise Kings, that did so to the like Offenders; because, we may believe it for a truth, that they, which have proved false, to their own true, just, and lawful Prince, will scarce ever prove faithful to any Prince, nor seem to be, but either for hope, still to reap the fruit of their Subtlety, to turn, when the Winde turns, or for fear to be dash'd in Pieces, if they turn not their Sayls to escape those Rocks; which they cannot otherwise avoid; and no thanks to such men for any good they do, when they do it perforce, and therefore should be trusted perchance.
And it may be, many of the very Murderers, both of the good King, and of his loyal Subjects, have robbed, and spoyled, not the Aegyptians of their Jewels, but the Israelites, their Brethren, of their Goods, Lands, and Possessions, which they have gotten into their own hands, and thereby became exceeding rich, and enabled themselves to match their Sons, and their Daughters to
great Families, and to bestow large Gifts, that do blind the eyes of the wise, on others, to make to themselves Friends of their un∣rig hteous Mammon, to preserve them from ther just deserts, and to pull down the Wrath, and Vengeance of God on others, for this their obstructing of the straight rule of Justice, that teacheth us to do otherwise.
Or, if it were not so, many men do wonder, how so many men, as were conceived to have been active, and most of them to have their hands embrued in the good King's Blood, and were likewise guilty of the death of His innocent Subjects, should escape uncensured, and so few of them sentenced, to expiate, and appease the Wrath of God for such horrible, unparallebd, and transcen∣dent Murthers: for I knew eight persons executed at Dublin for the Murther of one ordinary Traveller, and is it not strange, that we see no more brought to their Trial for such a Saughter, as was done upon our good King, and His innocent Subjects, so judi∣cially, and yet so illegally, and altogether unjustly sentenced to death? or shall we think, that no more were guilty, then were condemned? or not rather, that the guilty Murtherers, by their Wealth, Subtlety, and Friends, made many others guilty of God's anger, and the pulling down of God's vengeance upon many more, for their excusing, covering, and clearing such abominable Transgressours: for I would have all men to consider duly, how destructive Murther is to mankinde, and how odious, and hate∣full it is to God, above all other sins whatsoever, especially, when an innocent man is judicially, and illegally Murthered, as you may rightly finde the truth hereof fully proved in the fifth Chapter of the first Book of The Great Anti-Christ revealed, and in these Sermons following.
And I would the Protectours of the King's Murtherers would rightly weigh what the people sayd to King David, that His life was worth ten thousand of the lives of the common peo∣ple; and how the Lord punished the whole house, and poste∣rity of Saul, and all the Kingdom of Israel until his wrath was satisfied, for the innocent death of the Gibeonites, that were but a poor contemptible people, but killed without cause; 2. Sam. xxi. and especially, that there be not any more, but two sins, that I can finde, in the whole Book of God, that the Lord
saith, cannot be pardoned, and obliterated, without their due punishment, and they are,

1. The high Abuse of God's Messengers, and Publishers of his Will.
2. The unjust shedding of innocent Blood. For

Of the First the Spirit of God saith, that when the Lord God sent his Messengers unto the Children of Israel, and they mocked the Messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his Prophets, the wrath of the Lord arose against his People, until there was no Re∣medy; as if he had said, For other sins of these Israelites, some ways, and remedies might have been found out, as Moses, and Aaron, by their prayers, and censers appeased the wrath of God, to turn away the Punishment of them; and David, and Ezra did the like from the Jews: but when they mocked his Messengers, despised his Word, and misused his Prophets, which were the onely Sve, or Medicine, that could heal their sickned Souls, when they refused, and cast away these Remedies from them, then there was no Remedy in the World for them, to preserve them from their just deserved Punishment; and therefore saith the Text, The Lord brought upon them the King of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the Sword, in th House of their Sanctuary, and had no Compassion upon young Man, or Maiden, old Man, or him, that stooped for Age; he gave them all into his Hand; for that there was no Remedy. 2 Chron. xxxvi. 15, 16, 17.
And of the Second the Spirit of God saith, that the Lord sent against Jehoiakim bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Sy∣rians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the Children of Am∣mon, and he sent them against Juda to destroy it, and to remove them out of his sight for the sins of Manasses, and for the innocent blood that he shed, (for he filled Hierusalem with innocent blood, as the Judges of the Rump-Parliament did fill Ingland) which the Lord would not pardon, 2 Reg. xxiv. 4. as if he had said, though the Lord God might have been perswaded by Prayers, and Tears, and Sa∣crifices to pardon all other Sins; yet this sin of shedding innocent Blood, especially, when it is judicially shed, the Lord will no ways, nor by any means pardon it, and, though men would fain par∣don it, yet God will not pardon it; because God, which is the God of truth, and Truth it self, hath said it: and, that we should
not doubt of it, he hath said, Surely, your blood of your Lives will I require; at the hand of every Beast will I require it, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's Brother will I require the life of man. And, Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the Image of God made he man, Gen. ix. 5, 6. and see how fully, and how energetically the Lord hath said, and the Scripture hath set down, all these things, against the pardon∣ing of them, that shed innocent blood.
And then, these things being duly weighed, as Saint Ambrose said to Theodosius, Quod inconsulto fecisti, consultius revocetur, so I be∣lieve, that, if any man hath inconsideratly, either through igno∣rance, corruption, or partiality caused, or consented to let any Agag to escape, whom the Justice of God hath designed to death, he would assuredly, consultius errorem corrigere, amend His for∣mer errour, and not let the death of such a King, as was worth ten thousand of us, and the Blood of so many of His loyal Subjects, as were judicially, and unjustly condemned to death, pass away unpunished, and unquestioned, whensoever any of the Au∣thours, or Contrivers of their death should be found out; or at least wise, he would be satisfied, and not blame others, for doing, if they do, what he should have done: It is no matter when; (better late then never) for Nunquam sera est ad Justiti∣am via, The way to do Justice is never too far, nor the time too late; and God deserreth his Judgments for many years together, when we finde Murderers flourishing in all Pomp, and Power a long time, as I have shewed it at large in the Tragedy of Zimri; and yet at last, to come to tast of their just deserved Punish∣ment; as Pilate, and Herod, and the rest of the Murderers of Jesus Christ, were not apprehended by God's Justice, some of them in fourty years after they had condemned their just, and lawful King; and many more such Murderers you may finde in Dr. Beard's Theatre of God's Judgments, and in other Authours to have lain secure, and to have slept in their sins for a long Sea∣son, before the hand of Vengeance hath rouzed them up: and yet after many Ages to pay Death for Death.
And therefore, though the Parliament, and Parliaments have passed over, and perhaps pardoned those, whom God saith, he will not pardon; yet I conceive, that whensoever any of them,
that had their hands imbrued, or the least finger stayned, in our King's Blood, or in the Blood those, His loyal Subjects, that were judicially, unjustly condemned, shall be found out, and made known to be such, they should be brought unto their Trial; especially when we consider, that Justice don upon such transcendent Male∣factours, that do now, as yet (as it is conceived) wallow in those innocent Bloods, that they have spilt, and do jet up and down, most proudly, in the spoils of their Slaughtered, and Beggered Brethren, would, as the Scripture testifieth, purge the Land from the stain of that innocent Blood, which they have so plentifully lost and doth still crie, like Abel's Blood, for Vengeance against them, appease the Wrath of God for our former neglect of doing Justice; increase the King's Revenues, by the Forfeited estates of these Transgres∣sours; satisfie the Friends of those Murthered innocents; terrifie all other Rebellious hearts from such horrible attempts, and all other Judges, from abusing the Laws, and perverting Justice; and be an excellent Example of a just, and unpartial proceeding against Traitours, for the Foreign Kings to applaud it, and for their Subjects to fear it, if ever the like thoughts should enter into their hearts of doing such things, as were done by these Mur∣therers.
And truely it hath often grieved me, to hear the vulgar people so generally complaining, that they see divers of the late King's Enemies, and Rebels, that they suspect guilty, some way, of the Kings death, so much favoured in the World, and so domineering over others, jetting up and down in Pride, so gloriously trimmed with the spoils of the loyal Subjects, and some of the King's Friends, and faithfull Servants, sneaking up and down, wholly dejected, so as if there were an Act of Oblivion past of the King's Friends, and an Act of Indempnity for His Adversaries.
To whom I have often answered that our King is wise, as the Angel of God, and He knoweth best what He hath to do, far better then the best of us all, and they should rather remember what the Psalmist saith; Fret not thy self because of the ungodly, nei∣ther be thou Envious because of the wicked doers: for they shall soon be cut down like the Grass, and be withered like unto the green Herb; especially when their Iniquitie, their Treasons, and Treacheries, that as yet are hidden from the Eyes of men, shall be found out, and be made apparent unto the World.

And therefore, though I say all this, that I said before, as from the straight, unpartial rule of severe Justice; yet, as I am a Bishop of Jesus Christ, and a Messenger of the God of mercy, that takes no delight in the blood of his Brethren, nor desireth the death of any one; I am obliged most humbly, and earnestly to pray, and beseech Your gracious Majesty, to be still gracious, as You have demonstratively shewed Your Self to be hitherto, un∣to these ungracious Offenders; and when the Law of Justice hath decreed their Desert, to stretch forth unto them the right Hand of Mercy, and to do with them, as the Wisdom of the most mer∣ciful God shall direct Your Majesty.
Secondly, The next thing, that I am bound to declare, and to remonstrate unto Your Majesty, and to all others, is, (lest Your Majesty should be misinformed concerning me, as I under∣stood by Mr. Secretary Nicholas, I have been misrepresented in Your Majestie's Court,) most humbly to beseech Your Majesty, to give me leave, to make that Remonstrance to the World, which I hope no man can contradict: as,
That I was Your Father's Chaplain, and waited on His Majesty six, or seven years at least, in the Moneth of December, and when the Wars began, though my ever honoured Lord, and Master, the Earl of Pembroke, and Montgomery was mis-led, con∣trary to his Childrens desire, to adhere unto the Parliament, which fault can no ways be excused, though I could say very much to lessen it; because I knew the Uprightness of that Noble Person, that was hoodwinked by the Subtlety of his Adherents: yet, my self, according to my duty, stuck to his Majesty, and per∣swaded some of his Children, that were my Scholars, to do the like; and I wrote my first Book against the Parliament, which is intituled, The Grand Rebellion, and, being fetched by a Troop of Soldiers, was carryed Prisoner to North-hampton, where the Committee had The Grand Rebellion in their Hands, and had not God most mercifully, and very strangely turned away their eyes, from looking on it, to preserve me, I looked for no other end, then to be utterly ruined; but the Lord preserved me, and de∣livered me out of their hands: and the next Winter, being in Oxford, I printed my Discovery of Mysteries, or, The Plots of the pretended Parliament, to overthrow both Church, and State; and
on that very day, that I was preaching in Saint Marie's before the Parliament, then sitting in Oxford, the Soldiers from North∣hampton came, and plundred my house, and all my Houshold-stuff, and about eight milch Kine, and all that I had in Abthorp, where my Wife, and Children resided, and sequestred my Lands to the use of the Parliament: yet this Breach could not break my Loyalty to my King, or my Heart in my Body; but by the next Winter after, I had written my third Book, intituled The Rights of Kings, and the Wickednesses of the pretended Parliament, &c. And according to my poor Ability, out of the Means I had from Wales, I gave unto His Majesties own Hand every Winter, for three years together, the Testimony of my Loyalty, and Affection, to the uttermost of my Power; and His gracious Ma∣jesty did, like a most gracious King, most favourably accept of that Mite, which I offered Him, as Sir Bryan O-Neal, and others do very well know.
And when Major General Mytton came, and subdued our Coun∣try of Wales, though the Arch-Bishop of York was my singular good Friend, and very earnestly perswaded me to submit unto the Parliament, and, to use his own words, said, that I should fare no worse then he did, but should sail in the same Boat, and so sink, or swim, and so be saved, or destroyed together; yet I an∣swered, that I would never trust them, that they would be true to me, that wrote so many Books against them, when they were so false unto their King, that had been so gracious unto them: and therefore I went, and gave ten pound to a Parliament Ca∣ptain to let me pass into Ireland, by a most desperate Attempt; un∣der the hands, and through the Pikes of mine Enemies, that would have destroyed me, had they but known me: and there how faithfully, and freely I have often preached for Obedience to his Majesty, and against both the Inglish, Scottish, and the Irish Re∣bels, the most Honourable Duke of Ormond his Grace, and all the rest of the Council at Dublin, can sufficiently testifie.
And when the most noble Marquess could not possibly pre∣serve Ireland any longer, but was fain to yield it up unto the Parliament, and I had the Benefit of the Articles of Ireland con∣firmed, and allowed unto me, under the Hands of all the Com∣missioners, that signed them, I was taken at Sea in my Passage
into Wales, and pillaged of all that I had, my Books, Goods, Money, and Cloaths, to the full value of an Hundred Pounds, and then, coming to the Parliament for to have the performance of the said Articles, one Scot, since executed for a Traitour, de∣manded, if I wrote not The Grand Rebellion, and the other Books, that I had written against the Parliament, and, I confessing the truth, he asked, if I deserved not rather to have my head cut off, then to have the benefit of any Articles; so I was feign to make mine Addresse to Sir Thomas Fairfax, who very honourably wrote two Letters (which after I shewed them, I got againe, and do still keep them, as a memorial of his just, and great favour unto me) one to the Committee of North-hampton, who presently restored me to all the Lands I had in that County; the other to the Committee of Anglesey, who, though they were my near Kinsmen, and some of them descended from the House of Owen Tydder, the Grand-Father of Henry the Seventh, as well as my self; yet very unjustly, and unfriendly, they denied to restore me to my Means in that County: so that I was feign to make my second Address to his Excellencie Sir Thomas Fairfax, who again, as honourably as formerly, wrote to Major General Mytton, to put me into all my Possessions; but, before I could come to General Mytton, Anglesey was revolted from the Parliament, and besieged by Mytton, and the Means of the Deanerie, that belonged unto me, was Alienated from the Church, and taken quite away, and so ever since I was forced to live upon less means, then twenty pounds per annum, though my ever honoured Lord the Earle of Pembrook, and Mountgomery, offered, to procure me a Living, in Lancashire, worth 400.l. per annum, so I would submit my self to the Parliament, which, with many thanks unto his Lordship for his favour, I utterly refused; and, though other Bishops accepted, and received, each one, 100. pounds a year from Mr. Henry Cromwell, that offered the same very courteously unto me, yet, knowing how unjustly he had power to bestow it, and how I should be fettered if I accepted it, I refused to take it, and resolved to accept of no Salarie, Gratuity, gift, or Benevolence from any man to this very day, but to be very well contented with the poor estate, that God had left me; and when as divers Royalists, and other good Christians; seeing my mean estate, and considering my much Sufferings, did
offer me, and sent unto me divers sums of Monies, I refused them all, and was faine, before they left sending to me, to desire them publikely in the Pulpit at Dublin, to offer no more of their gifts, and benevolence unto me (for whose love and good will I did most heartily thank them) because I Preached not in expectation of any reward, but resolved to refuse the same, in hope that they would the rather beleive the truth of my Doctrine, as I thank God, I saw many of them did, though many others were much offen∣ded with me, so that I was forced to leave Dublin, and so fell to my Prayeres and Studies more, and more, to discover The Great Anti-Christ, comforting my self herein, that, if I was not mightily mistaken, in all my readings, of the sence and meaning of the Holy Ghost touching the coming of that Anti-Christ within three years and an half after both the witnesses were slaine, that is, the King killed, and all the Bishop's silenced, and suppressed from the execution of their Episcopal Function, which is their Spiritual killing, I should, if I should live so long, see, both Your Maje∣stie Restored, to Your Kingdom, and the Bishop's Elevated, to their former Dignitie, as, blessed be God, now both are fully come to pass, according to mine exposition of that Prophesie.
And this Prophetical expectation, of the Resurrection, and Re∣stauration of these two witnesses, the King, and the Bishops, accor∣ding to the true sence and meaning of the Holy Ghost I made known, and shewed it to very many, both in Dublin, in Wales, and in London; and though some of them, that saw mine exposi∣tion of those Prophesies, that I thus explained, did but laugh at them, and others thought it but a Fancie; yet, blessed be the God of Heaven, that Revealeth secrets unto his Servants, as Daniel saith, we see the truth of mine Explication, in all things accordingly fulfilled, and the confidence, that I had in the assurance of their ful∣filling, strengthned me, to be so bold in my Sermon before the Judges of the general Assizes at Conwey, to speak for Your Maje∣sties Restauration when You were comming towards Worcester, that, Collonel Carter, now Sir John Carter (a man then vehement against Your Majestie, and now loyal to Your Majestie as ma∣ny others are, that cannot otherwise choose) told me, as soon as ever I had done it, but that he would not seem to be uncivil: he would have pulled me down by the Ears, out of the Pulpit,
and the Governour of Beumaresh, Collonel Courtney, was resol∣ved to have clap'd me up in Prison; so that I was faign presently to fly away to save my self; and the like boldness, I always used, in all the many Sermons, that I preached at Dublin, as most of that loyal City can bear me witness; so that, sometimes I was forced, to take Sea, and to fly, as I did at Conwey, to escape, as soon as ever I had finished my Sermon. Sic multum terris jacta∣tus & alto.
And now being restored to my Bishoprick by the great good∣ness of God, and the happy Restauration of Your Sacred Majesty, I do most humbly crave leave to remonstrate, that as soon as I ar∣rived in Ireland, I went about my Diocess, in my Visitation, from one end to the other, that I might understand the State of the Church, and the Condition of the Country, where I was exceedingly welcomed by all the old Protestants, as they are termed, in every place; and when I had sworn Church-Wardens, and Sides-men, or Assistants in every Parish, I gave them some Articles to be in∣quired after, and a convenient time, to return their Answer into the Court.
And when they had answered to those Articles, I found thereby (and by what I saw with mine own eyes in the Country) that the Presbyterians, Anabaptists, Quakers, and the other fanatick Limbs of the Beast, the Members of the Great Anti-Christ, and the false Prophet that I have so amply deciphered, in my last printed Book of the Anti-Christ, had suffocated, and supprest the whole usual, and accustomed Service of God; and as they had done in Ingland, to his dearest Servants, so in Ireland, they had beheaded most of the Churches of Christ within my Diocess, the Roofes of them, both Slates, and Timber, being quite taken off, and converted to their own use, and the Walls of very many of them, thrown down, even to the Ground; and of above an hundred Parishes, I saw not ten Churches standing, nor half so many well repaired; they had as the Prophet saith, so destroyed, all the Houses of God in the Land, as being loath that God, which gave them all they had, should have a House for his Servants, to meet together, to praise his Name. And the great, and famous, most beautiful Cathedral Church of Saint Keney, they have utterly defaced, and ruined, thrown down all the Roof of it, taken a∣way
five great, and goodly Bells, broken down all the Windows, and carryed away every bit of the Glass, that, they say, was worth, a very great deal; and all the doors of it, that the Hogs might come, and root, and the Dogs gnaw the Bones of the dead; and they brake down a most exquisite Marble Font, (wherein the Christians Children were regenerated) all to pieces, and threw down the many many goodly Marble Monuments, that were therein, and especially, that stately, and costly Monument of the most honourable, and noble Family of the House of Or∣mond, and divers others, of most rare, and excellent Work, not much inferiour (if I be not much mistaken) to most of the best (excepting the King's) that are in Saint Paul's Church, or the Abby of Westminster: and, when I desired Mr. Connel my Re∣gister, to begin to repair some places of that Church, and to set up some Benches, and Formes, to let the people to understand, that we intended, and hoped (though it should cost two thou∣sand pounds) to have all the Church repaired; some of the Ana∣baptists (as we have good reason to think so) came in the night time, (the Church having no doors) and with Axes, and Hammers, or Hatchets, brake them down, and carryed them quite away, and did other unseemly Abuses besides.
And for the Preachers, and Ministers of God's word. The Great Anti-Christ had so filled the Country with his false Prophets, Weavers, and Taylors, and the like Preachers, that there were when I came thither, but three lawfully ordained Ministers, in all the Diocess of Ossory. Mr. Baskervil, Mr. Kearney, and Mr. Deane. The Labourers were so few, though the Harvest was very great, especially, if we hoped to root up those very many stink∣ing Weeds, that the false Prophet hath sowed amongst us; and for the Bishop's House, the Slates, Roof, Timber, Windows, and Doors, all carried quite away, and very much of the very Walls, thrown down, and ruined: Et sic periere ruinae: so that it cost me above thirty pounds already, to fit a Room, or two, for me to lay in.
And for the Lands of the Bishop, the best of them are pretend∣ed to be Fee-Farmes, and a Trifle reserved to be the Bishop's Rent, scarce worth the looking after; and those pretended Fee-Farms, with most other of the best Lands, contrary to all the directions of Cromwel, that, in all his Commissions, excepted all the Church-Lands,
from the Souldiers Lots, were by the Anabaptist's Com∣missioners, notwithstanding their grand Masters Prohibition, given to the Collonels and Captains for their Arrears, and they do absolutely deny to restore them unto the Church, until they besa∣tisfied with Reprisals, and so the Bishop hath not any thing from them.
But if the Bishops be so still kept from their Means, how shall we be able to do our Duties, and to discharge the Service, that we owe both to God, to our King, and to the Church of God, when the Soldiers divide our Lands, as formerly they did the Coat of Christ among themselves; and yet Pharaoh-like re∣quire of us the full Tale of Bricks, though they take away the Straw wherewith we make them.
But the mountainous Lands were onely set annually to Tenants, and others, who by reason of their high Rents, and greatness of their Taxes, were feign to leave the same, and the Rents of some, a year, and of others, two years unpaid; and so the Lands in ma∣ny places, became waste, when no other Tenant durst enter up∣on them, for fear of the Exchequer Writs, to distrain their Cat∣tle, for the Arrearages of Rents, as they had distrained, upon divers of the under-Tenants of them, that had run away; And for the Lands, and Houses of the Bishop, in, and about Kilkenny, that are a special part of the Bishops Revenue, the Soldiers took them all, either for their Arrears, or of the State for Rent, into their hands; and the Recusants, being all driven out of the City, the poorer sort of them remained in the Irish Town, and built Cabbins, and Cottages upon the Bishop's Lands, and Gardens, and were forced, to pay their Rent unto the Soldiers, that had the said Lands, and Gardens from the State; and when I sent to demand my Rent from those Tenants, the Soldiers pre∣sently distrained their Goods; and the poor men running unto me, to complain, and to know what they should do, I willed them to pay their Rents unto the Soldiers, though they were due to me; because, that rather then I would have the faces of these poor men grinded betwixt the Mill-stones of two pretending Land∣Lords, or that should undertake so many Suits in Law, with so many Sword-men, as do now hold the poor Bishop's Lands, I thought it better to be without my Bishoprick, if no other re∣dress could be afforded me.

And whereas the Irish Town, that was without Walls, and alto∣gether without the Walls of the Citie of Kilkenney, did belong to the Bishop of Ossory, as being his Mannour of New-Court, and paid a very considerable Rent unto the Bishop, which was a special part of his Revenue, Cromwell finding them Roman Catholicks, and in∣volved in that unnatural Rebellion, and Un-Christian Plundering of the Protestants, burnt most of their houses, and demolished them to the ground; so that where formerly there were whole streets of goodly houses, and rich Trades-men inhabiting, and paying, some of them, great Rents, and all of them, some chief Rent, unto the Bishop, the Bishop now hath never a penny, but onely some plats, and patches of waste ground, to tread upon; when as the Poet saith,
—Jam seges est ubi Troja fuit:
And these few houses, that escaped the Tyrants, and fire, the men, of the 49. years to whom Your Majestie bestowed the Citie of Kilkenney, with other places, for their Arrears, have seized upon them, and so left nothing, but the name, unto the poor Bi∣shop of Ossory: for under that pretence of having the Citie of Kilkenny, they do let, and set all the houses that did belong to the Bishops Mannour; and, as it is most true, that ne Hercules contra duos, so, how I should contest with so many men I cannot tell; onely this I can tell, that if they do thus take away the Lands of the Churches, and detain them from the right owners, I know not, which is more Sacrilegious, either these fair-spoken Royalists, or the foul-mouthed Cromwellists, or the Rebellious Papists: be∣cause each of them do take them away from the Church, and in∣volve the Church-men in more troubles, to recover them, then they are like to get by them while they live; such is our mise∣rable condition to deal with these many men; I dare not say, that they are the Limbs of the Beast, but they doe the same things, that the Beast did, and if they will take them, and detain them still from the Church, I being full seventy four years old, am not able to contest with so many men of arms, but I do hereby cite them, to appear to answer such things, as I shall alleadge against them, before Jesus Christ.

And whereas Your Majestie's gracious pleasure was, most gra∣ciously to grant unto every respective Bishop the Fee-Farms, and Leases of the Lands, that are now vested in the Crown by the forfei∣ture of the Rebels in fourty one; save those, that should be restor∣ed to their former Possessours, upon the information of his inno∣cencie Your Majestie, (being mis-informed, as I conceive, as the best, wisest, and justest King may be mis-informed, as King David was, in the case of Mepbosheth) hath restored the most rigid, and stiff Roman Catholick, that was always with, if not of, the Supreme Councel, and the Pope's Nuncio, at Kilkenny; and, as I am inform∣ed, a violent Plunderer of the poor Protestants, and a Ca∣ptain of Horse among the Rebels, and had taken Lands in Con∣nagh for his Estate in Lemster, unto all the Lands, that he held in the County of Kilkenny, and to the best Lord-ship, that be∣longed unto the Bishop of Ossory, and the onely Lands, and Lord∣ship of any note, that was held by any of the Roman Catholicks, and now vested in the Crown by that Rebellion, in all the Dio∣cess of Ossory; so that this Lord-ship, called the Upper-Court, and Freshford, being restored unto the former Possessour, the Church of Ossory receiveth not any great benefit by that Your Gracious favour unto the Church; but her Lands, and Revenues here∣in stand like the Body of the Nightingale, that is vox praeterea∣que nihil, and that hath much feathers, and little flesh, or, as the Poet saith,
Magni nominis umbra; ten pound yearly for that, which is worth near two hundred pound.
And therefore Your Petitioner humbly prayeth, that Your Ma∣jestie would be graciously pleased to cause, upon this informa∣mation, that those Lands, and Lordship of Upper-Court, shall be restored, according to Your most gracious Grant, unto the Church. And, as Your Petitioner hath already bestowed the whole last years Rent, all that was due to the Bishop, (and more then he received as yet) from the Tenants, for the repairing of the Chancel, and Quire of Saint Keney, and the Bishop's house.
(As the Rent of,

Captain Joiner 8l.
Captain Mainzor 24l.
Captain Eliot 25l.
Colonel Redman 33l.
Mr. John Grase 29l.
Colonel Dillan 24l.
Mr. Feak 20l.
Lievtenant Col. Wheeler 7l.
Mrs. Bolger 20l.
The Miller 5l.

Which is all the Rent, and Revenue of my Bishoprick for the last year, because the Parliament having got our Lands at an easie rate, onely for taking it, did in like manner let it as easily, for less then half the worth of it, which made in all an hundred seventy three pounds, whereof your Petitioner laid out for the repairing of the Chancel, and Quire of Saint Keney Church, one hundred, and fifty pounds, and for repairing the Bishop's house, that was all so extream ruinous, above thirty pounds) So he doth hereby promise, and oblige himself, to God, and to Your Majestie, most faithfully, and freely to dispose of it all, for the re∣paration of the body of the Cathedral Church of Saint Keney, that Your Majestie may see, Your Petitioner doth not so earnestly prosecute the recovery, and restoring of those Lands, and Lord∣ship of Upper-Court unto the See of Ossorie, for the enriching of himself, that, blessed be God for it, hath enough both for him∣self, and his, but for the benefit of the House, and Church of God.
Or if Your Majestie think not well to continue Your former gracious Grant thereof unto the Church, Your Petitioner humbly prayeth, You would be pleased to further Your Petitioner to recover from Robert Shee, the former Possessor, to whom it is now restored, the twenty years Rent, that is unpaid, and is due to your Petitioner, ever since the Rebellion began, and before; and which amounteth to two hundred Pound, beside the forbearance of them: the which, Your Petitioner conceiveth to be most just, and agreeable to all Law, Equity, and Conscience.
And for the rest of the Minister's Livings, through what fate, or by what means I know not, but through the just Judg∣ment
of God, that disposeth all things wisely, so it is, that very ma∣ny of the poor Protestants, which were robbed, and plundered by the Irish Rebels, are not one jot the better, by the subduing of the Rebels, and Displantation of the Romane Catholicks; but with the Irish, and like the Irish, do live most poorly, and have as hard a Task to get their own former Estates out of the Soldier's hands, as to pull the Club out of Hercules his hands, as it ap∣peareth by their dealing with my self; when, upon my Petition unto the House of Peers, to be restored unto the Bishop's Lands, that my Predecessor dyed seised of, I had an order of the Lords unto the Sheriffs, to put me into the Possession of it, which was so totally detained from me, that I had not so much Lands left me about Kilkenny, as would feed a Goose; and when the Sheriffs, according to mine Order, came, to deliver me Possessi∣on of it, a Captain of the Long Parliament, that had it given him, as he said, for his Arrears, stood before the Sheriffs, and told them, they should not tread upon his Lands, until he had his Reprisal for it, and because I knew him to be a Member of the House of Commons, I advised the Sheriff; to let him alone, and by no means to intrench upon their Privilege, con∣ceiving, that hereby he hath more affronted the whole House of Lords, in withstanding their Order, then he hath done me, and if they pass by such an Affront, I may far better do it; and if the Soldiers deal thus with me, that am their Bishop, and a Member of the Higher House of Parliament, how hardly, think you, shall the other poor Protestants, and the rest of the Country Gentlemen, that have been these many years kept out of their E∣states, get their Lands, and Possessions out of their hands? let Blackwel's Case be for instance.
Yet truly I must needs confess, that the Temporal Lords, both of the Roman Religion, and the Protestants, at all times have, and do shew themselves most faithful, and loyal to Your Ma∣jesty, and both favourable unto our Church, and, without any superciliousness, very friendly with us, that are their Bishops, and most willing to further us to all our Rights, and to grant us any lawful favour, and especially to assist us, to root out those weeds, that disturb us in the Government of God's Church, and the re∣storing, and setting forward the true Service of God amongst our People.

But the Colonels, and Captains, and the rest of the Soldiery, that subdued the Rebels, have the most part of the Kingdom in their Possession, and are very tenacious of what is in their Hands, and do live gallantly, and very fairly; and yet, in many places, the Country is left un-inhabited, and the best parts but thinly peopled, and the ground lying well nigh waste, for the most part, untilled, and ill-stocked, so that the Livings, which formerly were worth an hundred pound a piece per annum, are now set for little more then twenty pounds a piece; as mine own Rectory of Rath-Sa∣ran, and Rath-downy, that, before the Rebellion, were reputed to be worth above an hundred pounds per an. were set the last year for twenty six pounds, and the Lands of Bishop's-Logh, that my Predecessour did set to his own Son for eighty pounds per an∣num, was this last year, and before, set to Mr. Feak for twenty pound, and the like; by reason of which slender means, and tenuity of the Livings, I found, that the Commissioners for setting the Tythes, and setling Ministers to preach unto the people grant∣ed to one Mr. Kearny, that had three Parishes before, 7, or 8. Pa∣rishes more, and yet all those scarce able to make him a reasonable Maintenance of an hundred pound per annum; so they granted six to one Mr. Brooks, though he was no lawful ordained Mini∣ster; and Mr. Blake had six Parishes given unto him by the Mayor, and Burgesses of Waterford, and all not worth above twenty pounds per annum, as appeareth by his Presentation, and this sub∣sequent Letter unto my self.

HONOƲRED SIR,
WE the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Citizens, of the City of WATERFORD, having in our Power, by Charter from King CHARLES the First of ever blessed Memory, and before by his Ancestors,
the Presentation of a Minister to the Vicarages of KILL CULLEHENE, RATH-PATRICK, BALLY GOREN, KILL MAKEVOY, MACKOLLY, and WHITCHURCH, with the Donation thereof, all which amounts to twenty, and one Pounds, or thereabouts, per an∣num, and having by consent in Coun∣cil presented RICHARD BLAKE, Clerk, to the same; VVE earnestly pray, that if your Lordship have any in your Dispose, that lyeth contiguous thereto; that your Lordship would please to favour him therein, and it will thankfully be acknowledged by us, and what you please to command, that is in our Powers, you may freely com∣mand,
Waterford the 20.th. November. 1660.



The Cause of which Sterility of Fruit, and Scarcity of Means, and the thinness, or fewness both of Houses, and Inhabitants, I conceive to be, that the Adventurers, and Soldiers have got the most part of the Lands, of the Bishops, and Protestants, that the Irish drave away, and all the Lands of the Rebels, and Roman Ca∣tholicks, into their own Hands, and are neither willing to part with it, nor able to till it, manure it, and replenish it with Tenants, and Husbandry, as it ought to be.
Indeed I do confess, and it is most true, that, if the Irish Re∣bels, Popish Priests, and Romane Catholicks had had their Wids neither Protestant Bishop, nor any other Protestant should ever have had any foot of Land in all the Kingdom of Ireland.
And you know what Lex talionis saith to them, but that we ought to be more merciful, and to write our wrongs in the Dust, and not in Marble.
And therefore, we are all obliged, as specially to Your Sacred Majesty, that brought our Peace, and Restauration to all, that we have; so Secondly to the Adventurers, that laid out their Moneys, and to the Soldiers, that ventured their Lives, and endured hard∣ship, to restore us unto our Rights.
But if they adventured, either life, or money, to drive out the Rebels, and to get both their Lands, and ours, that never of∣fended, unto themselves, as many of the Soldiers do about Kilkenny, then we owe them no thanks; and they do no better, then as the Thieves robbed us, so they rob the Thieves, not for the love of Justice, to make Restitution to the Owners, but to enrich them∣selves, and how God likes of this keeping the right Owners from their Lands, and Houses, let the Adventurers, Soldiers, and Buyers of them, judge themselves, the Lord will judge it at ano∣ther Day.
All which, and many more Distempers, that might be seen in that unsettled Kingdom, and the Distresses of many unrelieved pillaged Protestants, that are continued, through the unbridled Fury of the Presbyterians, and the blinde illimited Zeal of the Ana∣baptists, Quakers, and other Sectaries, that have swarmed in this place, as appeareth by this Catalogue of them, that were pre∣sented by the Church-wardens of one Parish, for their unlawful Conventicles.

I thought it my Duty in all Humbleness, and Fidelity, to declare, and remonstrate unto Your Majesty, and to Your most Honourable Parliament, and all others, that desire to be informed herein: leaving it to Your Majestie's most wise, and pious Consideration, and their religious Care of God's Service, and Servants, to do, what to Your Majesty seemeth best herein; and most humbly craving Pardon, if, in these things, I have done any thing, that in the least way might offend Your Majesty, whom I so truly honour, and will ever as faithfully serve, as any Subject within Your Kingdoms, not onely, as You are my King, but especially as You are the gracious Son of so glorious a Father, as is that blessed King, CHARLES the First, whose Name, and Memory shall ever be like the Composition of the most pretious Oyntment, that is made by the Art of the Apothecary. So I rest.
