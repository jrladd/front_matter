IF He be blest that is of Noble bloud,
And being made great, is both great and good,
Who is a Christian euery way compleat,
Who holds it better to be good than great,
Whose life was guided with good Conscience,
Whose end was sauing faith and penitence,
These blessings Noble Dorchester were thine,
And these haue made thee 'Immortall and diuine.
