Dearly Beloved,
AS the whole design of penning the ensuing Discourse was for your advantage, and pro∣moting the Service of God in that Congrega∣tion which he hath called Me to the Cure of: So the publication of the same, (without any sinister or by end of Credit, or Profit to my self) tends on∣ly to your use and edification, that what was once transiently delivered, and (therefore according to that saying) might slip in at one Ear and out at the other, and so be easily forgotten, may be now pre∣sented to your constant view, and accordingly to your meditation and study. Thence it is that I aim at no other Patron but your selves, nor will I apo∣logize for my Stile or Language, which the plainer it is, it so much the better fits a mixt auditory. I de∣sign not the delight or encomiums of some, but the benefit of all, and therefore hope the sense will be
attended to more than the words. The wisest of Men tells us, Prov. 11.30. That he that winneth Souls is wise, (i.e.) that he that perswades is the best Orator. So that if this Discourse hath its intended effects up∣on your Lives and Conversations, I fear no critical remark and censures, but have my end in being dili∣gent in my Ministry, and shewing my self in every thing, but especially in relation to your Souls and Spiritual Concerns.
