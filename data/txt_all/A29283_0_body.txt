Noble Sir,
YOur being avocated from bearing the Burthen of the People, which for so ma∣ny yeares in the Two late Parliaments, and Parlia∣mentary Trust, first and last lay on you, invited me to commend this insuing Trea∣tise to you; As serving much to make a Man wise in leading him to the Know∣ledge of Himselfe; Not after the way
of the Schools, but of God, in which the use of Christ is rightly knowne, and Salva∣tion clearly seen according to the Grace of God, and Jesus Christ, in the Gospell; To which high Mystery I commend you, to direct your choicest Thoughts, and re∣maine

January the 18th. 1653.
