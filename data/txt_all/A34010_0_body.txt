Dread SIR, My Soveraign Lord;
KINGS and Princes being called Gods (as having Divine Cha∣racters of Wisdom, Power, and Goodness) are graciously pleased to give a kind recep∣tion to a Free-will-offering, though never so small.

I humbly Devote my self to your Majesty, and shall account it a high Honor, if You shall con∣discend to give me Your Patronage, which ren∣dreth that acceptable by Your Value, which can pretend to no Merit in it self.
I most humbly cast my Book at Your Feet (relating to the parts of the whole Body) to receive the Favour of your Royal Protection, to whom I give my Heart, the Fountain of Life, and the Faculties of my Soul, and Members of my Body, as so many Oblations Dedicated to your Service.
Your Majesty being a most Illustrious Person∣age, of most Eminent Gallantry, Courage, and most Prudent Conduct in Military Affairs, both by Sea and Land (of which You have given ma∣ny signal Testimonies) hath Preserved and En∣deared your Kingdoms, and made your Self Great and Glorious in the Esteems of the World.

And I humbly take the boldness in speaking what I am assured is Truth, without any Flat∣tery, in which I do YOU and my self Justice, That your most Gracious Temper and most No∣ble disposition of Mind do entertain all Persons, that have the Honor to be known to your Ma∣jesty, with all Favour and Kindness, and highly reward all those, who have the Happiness to serve You, with an open Hand.
And out of an Heroick principle of Love and Gratitude, have made a good provision for the Loyal Party, that have suffered for, and faith∣fully served your Royal Father, of ever Bles∣sed Memory, now in Glory.
And your Majesty is not only a Patron of Charity, and Remunerative, but of Commu∣tative Justice too, in making good all Con∣tracts, (and in the observance of that Golden Rule (Do as You would be done by) do
speak Your returns, where You have received any Obligation.
And your Majesty is not only a Master of Justice, but of Friendship too, and where You profess a Kindness, and espouse a Person in love, your Majesty is most Constant in your Affection: And nothing that is not highly Base, and Dishonorable, can alienate Your Esteems from your Favourite, which is a most Noble Quality, highly becoming a Prince (made Re∣nowned by Fidelity and Veracity) who are most just to your Word (whereupon Your Promises are reputed Sacred) of which I have had great Experience, and received high Obli∣gations, wherein your Majesty hath made me perfectly your Votary.
Your Princely Vertues are made more Illustri∣ous, as vailed with Humility, of which your Majesty is a great Example for us Your Subjects to revere and imitate.

Among other your Majesties most Glori∣ous Perfections, Your Quick Apprehension, and Profound Judgment are none of the least, whereby You have made a great Inspection into the Secrets of Government and Nature of Things.
After your Majesty hath been pressed with the weight of deep Thoughts, and fatigue taken in the Careful and Prudent administration of Justice at Home, and in the understanding the various Intrigues of State Affairs abroad, and in giving Satisfaction to Foreign Ministers, espousing the Interests of several Kingdoms and Re∣publicks; I humbly beseech your Majesty, to divert your Self (per passe le temps) with a History of Animals, contained in a Systeme of Anatomy, wherein You may treat Your Eye with a pleasant Prospect of the divers Apar∣timents of a Humane Body, beautified with choice Hangings, encircling the Bowels (as
so much rich Furniture) which are illustrated by the Dissection of other Animals (which I performed with Care and Diligence, speaking the wondrous Works of our most Glorious Maker) rendring the Parts of Man's Body more clear and intelligible.
In the ensuing Discourses, I most humbly pre∣sent your Majesty with many Essays of Experi∣mental Philosophy, relating to the Curious Frame of the Body of Man, and other Ani∣mals, which are as full of Wonder as Excel∣lency, in reference to their Variety of Parts, (dis∣posed in elegant Order) Ministerial to each other, and all subordinate to one Head, whose Commands they most readily obey: So that the Oeconomy of Nature hath much Affinity with the Monarchial Government of the Body Politick, as it is Composed of divers Ranks of Subjects, as so many Members, Constituted in great Order, wherein the Inferior are subordinate to the Superior, and all Subject to the KING, as
their Head and Supreme, to whose Authority all the Members ought most humbly to submit themselves in Active and Passive Obedience, without any Dispute or Resistance.


Great SIR,
Let all Your Subjects be ever Loyal, and Pay Your Majesty their most humble Duty and Thanks for Your most Gracious Declaration, and Obey You as Gods Vicegerent, in unani∣mously resolving to Sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes in the Defence of Your Royal Person, Authority and Government in Church and State, as by Law Established.
O KING, Live for ever, and let Your Glorious Name shine in the Histories of all Ages, and be Written in the Book of Life: Let Your Crown Flourish, and let Your Ene∣mies be scattered; and let Your Royal Succes∣sors, Lineally Descended from Your MA∣JESTY, sit upon the Throne, as long as
the SUN and MOON endureth; which is the constant and earnest Prayer of,
Great SIR,
