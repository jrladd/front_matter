My Lord,
THough it must be ac∣knowledged, that the Latine and Greek tongues are necessary qualifica∣tions for all Gentlemen and persons of Honour; yet do I not think them so for all per∣sons of a low degree, especially if the labouring for them shall occasion the neglect of other more useful studies in reference

to their livelyhood; and yet at∣tain to so little perfection in them, that the very rudiments of them, are in a very little time wholly forgotten also; and therefore, methinks, another way of instructing youth, than the Latine Grammar should be thought on, at least for such whose present fortunes and fu∣ture imployments, will not in any likelyhood require the knowledge of exotick Langua∣ges: To this purpose, it hath been my endeavour to effect two things for this Town of Ross, namely to procure a com∣petent maintenance for Gods

Minister there, that so the peo∣ple may be instructed in the principles of religion and true piety; and some endowment for an English School, by which means the Children may be the easier taught what Religion is, as well as instructed in those Arts and Sciences which will conduce to their more comfor∣table subsistance and present be∣ing.
The first of these, by Gods bles∣sing, and the assistance of your (no less truly religious than) Honourable Grandfather is now effected to the Glory of God in all future ages; and had

it pleased God, to have spared him to us yet a little longer, his favourable countenance and as∣sistance would not have been wanting in the other: very sen∣sible he was that Arithmetick and Geometry are very necessa∣ry Arts for the common sort of people to be instructed in, as well as for those that act in a higher Sphear; and that they might be so, I have now compo∣sed this brief and plain Treatise of Arithmetick, in such a Me∣thod, as will I hope prove useful even for Children of but seaven years of age, for their instructi∣on in that Science; and as a

thankful acknowledgement of the great kindness of your Ho∣nourable Grandfather to me (personally, but chiefly in assist∣ing me to bring in the Tithes of Ross, Brampton and Weston in this County of Hereford to the Church) I did intend to send this little treatise into the world in his name; but since Gods pro∣vidence, (in removing him to a better place, and more lasting Honour) hath made my inten∣tions frustrate, whither should I go, or unto whom should I ad∣dress my self, but to you, who have succeeded him in his Ho∣nour and fortunes, and given

great hopes to the world of suc∣ceeding him in his vertues also; whose great bounty to the Clergy in the time of their se∣questration, to several Churches since his Majesties happy re∣stauration, not only in endow∣ing them, with those Tithes which the Law made his, and purchasing others, but building convenient and beautiful habi∣tations for the several Incum∣bents in those places, his great charity to all in want, and care to put them into such ways of living, as might make them com∣fortably to subsist (as his boun∣ty in this particular to the City

of Hereford doth witness) se∣conded with his exemplary piety both in publick and pri∣vate, will proclaim his worth, and make his name to be very precious in all succeeding gene∣rations.
And now what shall I say more, but for as much as the eyes of all men are upon you, and that you have succeeded this Honourable and much la∣mented Patriot of our Coun∣try, as Elisha succeeded Elijah, I will only pray that a double portion of his spirit may be up∣on you, that the Glory of our Countrey may not together

with him depart from us, as it did from Israel when the Ark of the Lord was taken from them: God I hope will not only continue but augment your Glory, and the Glory of our Country, by making you to be instrumental for his: may your days be many, and your death Glorious; may it be with you as it was with David and your Honourable Grandfather, may you die in a good old Age, full of days, riches and honour, and your Son succeed you, so prayeth
