GOe litle Booke, (my unlick't Poetry)
And be a Patron to thy selfe and mee,
Shift it among the crowd, and never stay
To dresse thy selfe, like other trim and gay,
ith borrow'd Titles, pluckt from great Ones, who
Are honoured by the Honour that they doe,
eare thy owne cloathes, and thinke it more to be
Knowne by thy face, then by a livery.
e're trust unto fond ficklenesse, that may
Afford a smile at first, and then betray,
That hisse and kill, that by embraces smother,
With one hand take, and throw away with th' other,
That ow'n a Booke, because the  ownes them,
Or else they'd never ow'n the Booke agen,
Let those that can warpe Conscience in a straine
And count it but a Poets Spencer veine
To fawne and flatter, and have learnt to call;
One Good, because he's Great, though worst of all;

Let those who can weigh vertue by the pound,
Where it is scarce by Drammes and Ounces foun
Who make it then chiefe Masterpiece of wit,
To Banckrupt Honour by out-rayling it
Who can say I, or No, sweat, freeze, as hee
Is hot or could, who is their Deity.
Let such Idolatours of Greatnesse shew,
They dare not walke abroad unlesse they goe
Vnder some Hee or Shee-Protection:
My Muse shall venture in another fashion
Make thine owne licence (little one) and bee
Protection to thy selfe, a Passe to mee.
And let such scratching Patron-mongers know
Thou'lt not on stilts, nor yet on Crutches goe,
On thy own feet thou'lt either runne or crawle
And if thou  anst not stand on them, thou'lt fall,
Weigh neither smile nor froune, but when you see
Best usage say, this shall my Patronbee:
And as for others that disdaine, say thou
My Master ownes me not, and why should you?
