GREAT SIR,
WHen I began to write this Dedication,
my hand shook, a fear possest me, and I
trembled; my Pen fell from me, and
my whole frame grew disorder'd, as if
blasted with some sudden upstart Comet. Such Awe
and Reverence waits on Dignity, that I now find it fit
for me to wish, I had been refused the honour of my
Dedication, rather than undertake a task so much too
great for me. How shall I excuse this bold and saucie
fault? How shall my mean unworthy pen, render you
your Attributes? Now I find presumption is a sin in∣deed.
I have given my self a wound beyond the cure of
common men: Heal me then, Great Sir, for where
Princes touch, the Cure is infallible. And now since
you so graciously have received my Farriar, who dares
say he is no Physician? When you vouch safe to call him
Doctor, he has Commenced, and from your Mouth he has
taken his Degree; for what you say, is, and ought to be:
such a power is due to you from the Greatness of your
Blood: I, and my abject Muse had perisht but for you;
and in such distress, whither should we flee for shelter,
but to him that has power to spread his wings and co∣ver

us? and you have done it generously: Yet am I
not to wonder at this Vertue in you, since your high
Birth can do no less for you than to make you good, and
you are so: and may that Goodness and Humility, which
so early appears in you, increase to a full perfection:
may your Vertues prove as beautiful as your person;
may they still indeavour to out-vie each other, yet nei∣ther
obtain, but still walk hand in hand, till your Ver∣tues
in you be reverenc'd by all Mankind, and your love∣ly
Person honoured by all Women, and so may you con∣tinue
to a long and happy life. But I need not wish
this, nor the world doubt it; for already you're possest
of all those Vertues, that men hereafter may reasona∣lly
expect from you: for being supported with Maje∣sty
of one side, and with so admired and beautiful a
Mother on the other, besides her great and honourable
Birth, on such sure foundations, you cannot fail our
hopes, and that you never may, shall be for ever the
prayers of
