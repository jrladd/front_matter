Right Honorable:
THis Dedication in it selfe unworthy the honour of an ad∣drsse to your Grandurs, and of a foe too dad in shddow o approach neer you mst vigoous luster, reposs it selfe yt upon a cofidence that in imitation of that God of whom you are in power the proper Re∣presentatives who vochsafed gracously to accept a poore paire of Turtles from those whose abilities could not ascend to a more rich oblation, you will be pleased to cast a favourable aspect upon this humble offering, as proceeding from a gratefull cleere and sincere intenion whose desire being strongly passionate to present Your Honours with smething more worthy the uspice of a beginning Yeare, is cir∣cumcribed by a narrownesse of abilities and fortunes.
And indeed my lownesse had prompted me to have found out a more humble Patron for this Treatise; but since the Interest of that Nation you have so happily restored to its just and native liberty is the principall ayme intended in it, since the publick acknowledgement of the world u∣nites in this common testimony, That God hath subscribed to all your Heroick and Christian undertakings with his own broad sel of Victory with his owne field word, Go on and prosper: led you through the red sea of bloud into the Land of Canaan, into the Harvest and Vin∣tage of Israel, since Pharoah and his mighty ones have been swallowed up in the rapid current in the hideous cataracts of their ambitious oppo∣sition and have by loud and convincing testimonies (tstimonies at∣tracting the admiration of your friends, and confounding the malice of your enemies) made it a blessed object of your consideration, that the pre∣servation and fixre requires a blssing no lesse subime, and a vertue

no lesse exalted, then the acquisition and tenure of conquests, made good in the eyes of Christendome by vindicating the English Honour upon the Brittish Ocean with a uissn Navy, a formidble subject of amz∣ment to the Forraine Enemies of your Sion, by a strong winged prose∣cution of the Irish Assassnates, a spacious lettred exmple to teach En∣glish Mutineers what they may expect by the red sentence of justice upon Irish Rebells: All indeavours holding forth the way to improve the in∣terest of this Nation, are improperly addressed to any other then your selves, who as you have been the unexampled instruments of our unpini∣nd libery, ought to be the sole Iudges of whatsoever may relate to our future felicity.
We should have suspected the sincerity of History in its delineation of the Majsty which sat upon that August, and venerable Roman Se∣nats, after having made the Land tremble under the terrour of their Armies, the sea to labour under the burthen of their numerous Navies, after having delivered all power oppressing the universall liberty to the revenging beak of their victorious Eagles and minted the Governments of the world by the Romn Standard; had not the Concentricity of your undertakings had not th Homogeniousnesse of your actions and felicity, vindicated and asserted the honour of atiquity, and raysed your rep∣tations upon so high a wing of glory, that Posterity will be lost in the same mist of jealousie and incredulity of your owne augustnesse, yet for ever want the revivall of such examples the restauration of such presidents to confirme them.
And to the end you may in all things either parallell or trns∣cend that Romane greatnesse, of which you are the inimitable ex∣emplary, who inriched the heart and strengthned the armes of their Dominions by dispersing Colonies in all Angles of their Empire, Your pious care hath already layd a most signall foundation by inviting in∣couragements to undertakers of that nature: In the pursuit whereof le me beg the liberty in this Paper, under your Honours Patronage to pub∣lish the many pressing and convincing reasons which have and may in∣duce you to prosecute a designe of such universall concernment.


1. It will disburthen this Nation of many indigent persons, who having formerly perhaps enjoyed a fulnsse of abused or forfeyted plenty, & at the present reduced to an inquality of such subsistence, are commonly prompted to their own and other mes ruine by making the high wayes (which should be as publike and inviolable a sanctuary as the most sacred places) an ambuscado to innocent Travellers, by which interruption of passages, there is commonly occasioned a decay and disincouragement of commerce, and dayly examples informe us, that Prisons at present are almost as full of criminall as indebted persons.
2. It will take off all Parish charges, in providing for destitute Minors and Orphans, whereof there are at present a burthensom mulitude, wherby the Parishes so freed, may with greater alacrity and ability, part with contributory moneys to maintain, recruite, and incourage your Armies and Navies.
3. Those Orphans so provided for may by Gods blessings upon their labours become happy and wealthy instruments, advantagi∣ous to the place of their nativity in particular, and their whole Na∣tion in generall. Whereas the condition of their birth and the u∣suall way of exposing them, makes them capable of no more gain∣full calling then that of day-labourers, or which is more frequent hereditary beggers.
4. The Republick in its present constitution abounding with so dangerous a number of male contents, who commonly like Shrubs under high and spreading edars, imagine the spacious height of others to be the cause of their owne lownesse, may by this means be honourably secured, and such men removing their discontents with their persons, will have a brave and ample theater to make their merits and abilities emergent, and a large field to sow and reape the fruit of all their honest industrious and publick intentions.
5. It will to admiration increase the number of Ships and Sea∣men, (the brazen wall of this Nation) all materialls to advance Na∣vigation, being abundantly to be furnished out of those Countries,

and the more ingenious Passengers by conference and disputation with the knowing Mariner, will take a great delight, satisfaction, and ambition, to attaine to the Theory of that knowledge, while the lesse capable being accustomed and assigned to an usuall part in the toyle thereof, and instructed by the ordinary Saman, will bee brought to a good readinesse therein and speedy perfection.
6. All Materialls for shipping, as Timber, Cordage, Sailes, Iron, Brasse, Ordnance of both mettals, and what ever else we are necessi∣tated o supply our wants with out of the Esterne Countries, who make it not unusuall to take advantages of their neighbours necessi∣tie, and often times upon a preence of differene or misintelligence betwixt us, embrace an occsion to over-rate or over-custome their commodities, or (a reall quarrell widening) sell it to other Nations from whence we are forced to supply our selves at a second or third Market.
7. It will give us the liberty of storing a grea part of Europe with a larger plenty of incomparably better fish, thn the Holan∣der hath found meanes to furnish it withall, and will make us in no long tract of time, if industriously prosecued, equall, if not trans∣cend him in that his most benificiall staple.
8. It will be to this Common wealth a standing and plentifull Magazine of Wheat, Rice, Coleseed, Rapeseed, Flax, Cotton, Salt, Pot-ashes, Sope-ashes, Sugars, Wines, Silke, Olives, and what ever single is the staple of other Nations, shall be found in this joyntly collected.
9. It will furnish us with rich Furrs, Buffs, Hides, Tallow, Biefe, Pok, &c. the growth and increase of Cattell in this Nation, recei∣ving a grand interuption and stop, by killing commonly very hope∣full yong breed to furnish our markets, or store our shipping, meer∣ly occasioned by want of ground to feed them, whereas those Pro∣vinces afford such a large proportion of rich ground, that neither the increase of this or the succeeding age can in any reasonable pro∣bability overfeed the Moety.
10. By it many of your Honours Reformadoes and disbanded souldiers being dismist with the payment of such part of their ar∣rears as your owne judgement (guided by the rule of your immense disbursements) shall thinke a convenient recompence, by transpor∣ting themselves thither may change their desperate fortunes into a happy ertainty of condition, and a contented livelyhood, which will be a means not only to disburden this Republick as before) but to remove all those clamors usualy disturbing your publick consul∣tations, and to win upon them by your bounty to invert all those fearfull imprecations, with which they would (as much as in them lies) unblesse your proceedings, into a joyfull and fervet concur∣rence of prayers to the Almighty to shoure downe blessings upon your heads, who, next under him, are the glorious and visible in∣struments of their increasing happinesse.
11. It will be a generous and moving incouragement to all in∣dustrious and publick spirits, to imploy those parts with which God and nature hath blessed them in the discovery of such happy inven∣tions as my drive on hopefull designs with a lesser number of hands then is usually assigned to them, which issues of the brain are legi∣timate and geniall to beginning Plantations, where the greatest want is that of people: but for our own or other popular Kingdoms where we are commonly overprest with a greater multitude of l∣bourers then imployrs, by much lsse acceptable, since our indi∣gent people look upon such Engins meerly as Monoppolies to en∣grosse their livelihood
12. It will adde a very considerable increase to the Revenue of your Honours own Customs, and I shal assume the liberty in all hu∣mility to offer up to your more advised deliberation by way of sup∣plement to your incomes, whether such malfactors a the letter of the law dooms to death, yet leaves a latitude for extent of mercy in the bosome of the Judges, whose release oftentimes proves not on∣ly ruinous to them so discharged, since not seldome they returne to their vomit, but pernicious to the Common-wealth reinvaded

by their insolencies and disorders, might not be made instrumental∣ly serviceable to the State, if (as it is frequent in other Countreys, where they are condemned to the Gallis) by way of reparation for their crime, they were sentenced to serve a quantity of years accor∣ding to the nature of their offences, which expired, they should en∣joy all immunities with others, and by this course be reduced and accustomed to a regular course of life. Of these a thousand trans∣ported and employed by an understanding improver, would by their labour advance an income of forty thousand pounds sterling per annum, at the leaft, and so proportionably according to their number.

That all these, and many inestimble benefits may have their rise, inrease, and perfection from the South parts of Virginia, a Country unquestionably our own, devolved to us by a just title, and discovered by John Cabot at the English ex∣pnces who found out and tooke seisure, together with the voluntary submission of the Natives to the English obedience of all that Continent from Cape Florida Northward, the excellen temper of the aire, the large proportion of ground, the incredible richnesse of soile, the admirable abundance of Mineraels, vegetables, medicinall drugs, timber, scituation, no lesse proper for all European commodities, then all those Staples which entitle China, Persia, and other the more oplet Provinces of the East to their wealth, reputation, and greatnes (besides the most Christian of all improvements, the converting many thousands of the Natives) is agreed upon by all who have ever viewed the Country: To which the judge∣ment of the most incomparable Ralegh may be a convincing assertion, whose pre∣ferring of that Country before either the North of Virginia or New-England, though it may sufficiently command my submission and acquiescence; yet for more particular satisfaction be pleased to accept these reasons for such praeation.

1. The apparent danger all the Colonies may be in if this be not posses∣sed by the English, to prevent the Spaniard, who already hath seated himself on the North of Florida, and on the back of Virginia in 34, where he is alrea∣dy possessed of rich silver Mines, and will no doubt vomit his fury and ma∣lice upon the neighbour Plantations, if a prehabitation anticipate not his in∣tentions, which backt with your authority, he understands too much of your power, and is too sadly acquainted with your admirable successes and gene∣rous resolutions, not to sit downe by any affronts offered to those under the wings of your protection, to attempt any thing against such who are imme∣diately

your owne Colony, lest thereby he administers matter of a fire, to which his own fortunes in the Indies must be a fewel, and himselfe raked up in its ashes.
2. But the South of Virginia having a contiguous Ledge of at the least one hundred Ilands, and in the middest of those the incomparable Roanoak, the most of them at the same distance from the Continent that the le of Wight is from Hamphire, all of hazardous accese to Forrainers, and affording a se∣cure convenience from surprizall by the Natives, will if possessed and protect∣ed by your power, be as an inoffensive Nursery to receive an infant Colo∣ny, till by an occasion of strength and number, we may poure our selves from thence upon the Mayneland, as our Ancestors the Saxons from the Isle of Ta∣net into Brittaine.
3. It dispences a moderate equality of heat and cold between the two vi∣olent extreams thereof in Barbads and New England.
It will admit of all things producible in any other part of the World, lying in the same Parallel with China, Persia, Japan, Cochinchina, Candia, Cyprus, Sici∣ly, the Southern parts of Greece, Spain, Italy, and the opposite Regions of Africa.
4. It hath besides all Timber for shipping, the best and reddest Cedars, and Cypresse trees that may be found in any Countrey.
5. And lastly, the planting of this Collony will open a most compendious passage to the discovery of those more opulent Kingdomes of China, Cochin∣china, Cathaya, Japan, the Phillipines, Summatra, and all those beauteous and opulent Provinces of the East Indies, which beyond dispute lye open to those Seas which wash the South-West parts of Virginia, through whose bosome all those most precious commodities which enable the Chinesie, Cathayan, Persian, and Indostant Empires, may more conveniently, speedily, with more security and lesse expences be transported thence from Spawhawn or other remoter Provinces to Gombroon, by a long dangerous and expensive ara∣vane, and from thence to Suat, where when arrived the doubling of the Line, Calentures, Scurvies, with a long train of diseases and Famine attend its transportation into our owne Countrey.
6. Whereas by expandeing our selves to both sides and Seas of Virginia, our commerce to those noble Nations lies open in short and pleasant voyages to the encouragement, enriching and delight of the Seamen, and personal adventurers, who will share in the delicacies and profits of those Kingdoms, without participating in the miseries attending our present voy∣ages thither. The Cargason being easily conveyed, by much the greater part of the way, through Navigable Rivers, and from the Eastern shore of Virgi∣nia in a month, or at the largest six weekes time into England.

And by this meanes the Hollander, Spanyard, and Portugall, who (by

the supine negligence of this Nation, and its Merchant Adventurers) do with insufferable insolence Lord over us in boh the Indies, when they shall to the unknitting of their joints perceive by your nursing care over the Infancy of your Colonies, that they are arrived under your auspice, to cover both the Seas with numerous Navies, and your Honours eye of indulgence and providence waking to their security, will be content lay∣ing aside all other passions to wave future affronts and injuries, or fall a deserved sacrifice to your offended justice.
And that this addresse may appear the more seasonable, I have (with∣out any privity or relation to his person) taken leave to intimate to your Honours, that there is a Gentleman whom the publick reputation and te∣stimony of those who have the happines to know him render of excellent abilities, integrity, and a never shaken affection to your cause in all its crisis and dangers through which God with a clew of successe hath been your conduct) who hath already undertaken for the transportation of some men thither, and only waits for your Honours approbation and au∣thority, the world taking notice, hopes and encouragement from thence, that as this Colony is like to be the eldest of your legitimate daughters n that nature, so by your indulgence she shall have the happynesse not to be the yongest in your affection.
May that God who hath begirt your house with a Grove of Lawrell, continue the advance of those Victories till the whole Nation be crowned with Olives: May no sin, no ingratitude of ours divert his protecting hand from us, his assstant arme from you: May the generations to come in admiration of your vertue and gratitude for their by you derived happines, make every heart your monument, wherein to embalme your memory whilst the Histories of all Nations and times enrich their n∣nals with your names as the most serious and triumphant part of all ex∣amples and transactions. And lastly may your owne thankfulnes to him from whom these dispensations of mercy have distilled like the dew of Hermon upon your heads and borders, so continue in your bosoms, that when you shalbe ripe for translation, he whose instruments you are, may welcom you with the approbation of, Well done good and faithfull ser∣vant, Which are the undisguised wishes of
