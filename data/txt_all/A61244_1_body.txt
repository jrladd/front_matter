SIR,
I Humbly begge your Pardon for
bringing this Book under your Pro∣tection.
Were it a VVork of my
own, or I any thing but the Transla∣tour,
I should master my Thoughts to a meaner
Dedication; But being a Collection of some of
the greatest Masters in the VVorld, and never
made English till now, I conceived I might
sooner procure their VVelcome to a person so
eminent for Noble Candor, as well as for all
those Intellectual Excellencies wherewith
Your Rich Soul is known to be furnished. I
resolv'd to be as kind to this Book as I could,

and seriously considering which way to effect
it, I at last concluded to prefix Your Name,
whom His Majesty and all his Subjects, (who
have a higher Sense and Judgement of Excel∣lent
Parts) know best able to defend my Im∣perfections.
And yet I confess there's one
thing makes against me, which is your eminent
Integrity and great Affection to Truth, where∣by
my Lapses in a VVork of this Nature might
justly despair of Shelter, but that the Excel∣lency
of Your Native Candor strives for Pre∣dominancy
over all Your great Abilities. For
'tis all-most impossible to think what Your
Matchless VVit is not able to Conquer, would
Your known Modesty but give leave: there∣fore
Galileus, Kepler, and those other Worthies
in Learning are now brought before You in
English Habit, having chang'd their Latine,
Italian and French, whereby they were almost
Strangers to our Nation, unless to such as You,
who so perfectly master the Originals. I know
you have so much and great imployment for
His Majesty, and his good Subjects that I shall
not robb you of another Minutes loss; besides
the liberty of subscribing my Self;
