My LORD,
IT is the Law of this and other Nations, that whatsoever trea∣sure is found, straight to be carried to the Supream of that People. Wherefore falling on this, no little (in my opinion, which

is the only Law that puts value on any thing to me) treasure, that I might not be guilty of concealment, I present it to your Lordship, being Chief-Captain of those Forces a∣mongst whom for diverse years I have served, and prospered. The bulk of the Book can crave none of those few moments snatch'd from weighty businesse and letten fall on recreations; the rarenesse of the subject and handling of this Ma∣gical-Medicine may sometimes commend it to your pastimes. They that are grown big, rather with Au∣thority than Reason, will, I know, condemn me of confidence, for bringing so small an Offering to the

Altar of thankefulnes, where they, may be to avoid superstition, do sel∣dom worship. But History telleth me, that the greatest Monarchs have chearfully accepted the mean Gifts of their Souldiers and Sub∣jects; And as Your Lordship in real Valour and Piety represents that noble Emperour; so in that wherein he exceeded all other, You are no whit short of Him; that is, You never suffered any Petitioner to depart sad from Your sight; and (which is more) never forsook them whom once You befriended: This is observed by all, this hath been my experience so oft as I had need of favour and protection.

This, and this chiefly hath made me approach that Presence, who by his Prudence hath reliev'd his fainting Forces, and made his stoutest Enemies fall in their Ar∣mies and Navies: both Elements errect Trophies to Your Conduct and Courage; And this Nation acknowledge your goodnesse, which being ready to break in pieces by its own envy and divisions, You walked so wisely before, and a∣mongst them, that You forced them to continue a Society and People, leaving that knotty work easie for the next Labourers. Posterity, the best Judge of Vertue, shall re∣ward Your Achievements with

honourable Monuments, the pre∣sent Age (though ever envious, yet) entertain Your Fame with prosperous Acclamations; And that Your full Happinesse may not have the least stain or blemish, Your Health is the affectionate desire of,
MY LORD,

EDINBURGH, June 3. 1656.
