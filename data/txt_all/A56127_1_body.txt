RIght Honourable Worthies, what the Prince of Latine Poets long since observed in generall — Virg. Georg. l. 2. Aliur vitium crescitque tegendo; That maladies are nourished and augmented by concealing them; is in a more especiall manner verified

in our Lordly Prelates, (one of the greatest maladies in our Church and State) who have beene fostered and suffered to grow great among us, onely through the concalement, palliating, or ignorance of their disloyalties, and other Episcopall vices.
The consideration whereof hath induced me to compile and publish, The second Part of this Antipathie; wherein I have (accor∣ding to my weake abilities) anatomized some of their Traiterous, Seditious, Rebellious Contumacious, Oppressive, extravagant Pra∣ctises, in ancient and moderne times, laying them open unto publique view: and withall discovered the frivolousnes of those grounds, the insufficiency of those Reasons alledged for the pretended Divinity, Antiquity, and perpetuating of their Lordly Prelacy a∣mong us; Mat. 15.3. A Plant (I dare say) which our Heavenly Father never planted in our Church; and therefore certaine to be rooted out in his due time; which in all probability is now neare at hand. If these my endeavours (which I humbly prostrate at your Honours Feete, recommending them to your Noble Patro∣nage, as I did the former part) may contribute any thing to this much desired, long expe∣cted good worke, I shall thinke my labour

happily bestowed. In the meane time, I shall be a daily Oratour to the Throne of Grace, for a superabundant blessing upon your Hono∣rable Persons and publique Consultations, till you have cleansed both our Church and State from all Corruptions which infest them, and Psal 100.8. Cut off all wicked doers from the City of our God.
