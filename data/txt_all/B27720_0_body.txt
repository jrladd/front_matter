My Lord,
IT is not for the benefit of any pro∣tection to the ensuing Treatise, let it stand or fall, as it shall be found in the judgements of men: nor that I might take advantage to set forth any of that worth and honour which being personall have truly enobled your Lordship, and made a way for the delivering over of your family unto posterity; with an eminent Luster added to the roul of your worthy progenitors; which if by my selfe desired, my unfitnesse to performe, must needs render unacceptable in the per∣formance; neither yet have I the least desire to attempt a further advancement of my selfe into your Lordships favour, being much be∣neath what I have already received; & fully re∣solved to own no other esteem among the sons of men, but what shall be accounted due (be it more or lesse) to the discharge of my duty to my Master Jesus Christ, whose wholly I would
 be: it is not all, nor one of these, nor any such as these, the usuall subjects and ends of Dedicati∣ons, reall or pretended, that prevailed upon me, unto this boldnesse of prefixing your Honou∣red name to this ensuing Treatise, (which yet for the matters sake contained in it, I cannot judge unworthy of any Christian eye) but one∣ly that I might take the advantage, to testifie (as I do) to all the world, the answering of my heart unto that Obligation, which your Lord∣ship was pleased to put upon me in the undeser∣ved undesired favour, of opening that doore wherewith you are intrusted, to give mee an entrance to that place for the preaching of the Gospell, whither I was directed by the Provi∣dence of the most high, and where I was sought by his people. In which place this I dare say by the grace of God, that such a stock of Prayers and thankfulnesse, as your heart, which hath learned to value the least of Christ in whomso∣ever it be, will not despise, is tendred for and to your Lordship, even on his behalfe who is lesse than the least of all the Saints of God, and un∣worthy the name which yet hee is bold to sub∣scribe himselfe by,
