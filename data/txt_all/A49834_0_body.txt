O Most Gracious God, the Creator and Susteiner of all things, Thou alone art the Fountain of Being and Happiness, to whom all things are eternally known, and from whom no secret can be hid; thou callest the things that are not, as if they were; and by the weakest means, canst effect thy greatest Designs. Lord, thou knowest my aim and end in these my weak Endeavours, and the Motives from whence I have made them publick: How earnestly I have laboured (since, through thy Grace I have turned my back on Folly) after a satisfactory Rest to my anxious Mind. And how unwearied I have been by an impar∣tial Enquiry into the various ways of Religious Worship, which (though but Shadows in Religion) are so much insisted upon by Men of different Persuasions, to cause Separation from our National Communion: In which (if I understand it right) no more stress is laid on any Rite or Ceremony, than Decency and Order do require.
O my God, thou who art the searcher of Hearts, and by thine all-seeing Eye (as in open day) thou discerns the most secret De∣signs of Men; thou knowest what ill use hath been made of these Fig-leaves of external Profession, by subtil and designing Persons, under pretence of Liberty of Conscience, and Zeal for Reformation, to separate from our Publick Established Discipline into a pretended purer Worship, thereby to impose upon, and misguide the most sincere, and well meaning Chri∣stians, to implant themselves into separate and gathered Churches, (as into a more secure Ark of Salvation) only to serve their own Turns, and to promote their own private In∣terest in their Worldly Design; from whence our unhappy Di∣visions
 have arisen, and Sects like Locusts have encreased, to the great scandal and Offence of such as are willing to do, or suffer any thing to be safe, and to the hindring many others from returning, who might have continued holy and happy Pillars in our Publick Communion, to the Advancement of thy Glory, in the Harmony and Tranquillity of the whole Kingdom.
I do most humbly acknowledge thy infinite Goodness towards me, for the gracious guidance of thy Spirit, in disposing my Heart, when I had examined and enquired into all other Persua∣sions, then to fix and join in that Communion, where I am fully persuaded I may serve thee most acceptably, agreeable to thine own revealed Will, and where I may most benefit my Fellow-Creatures, to my Comfort here, in order to my eter∣nal Felicity.
O my God, thou knowest how I have endeavoured in the Simplicity of my Heart, to make known to others, what thou hast in Mercy discovered to me, and done for me, in sparing me as a Monument of thy Mercy, and a Miracle of the Age I live in; having no other Cause to assign why I survive my Com∣panions in Evil, but that I should at my Peril explode that unmanning Sin of Drunkenness and Intemperance, and warn all others to shun, hate, and forsake it, as the Parent and Nurse of Vice, Immorality and Debauchery, the monstrous Bane of Humanity, and blast of all Religion; as it eclipses Reason, (the Sun in Man's little World,) rendring Men below Brutes, careless and senseless of their Duty to Thee, their Fellow-Creatures, and themselves; bold and daring in bare-faced Impiety, more barbarous and cruel than Tygers to their own Flesh and Blood; and in the dreadful Consequence, without Repentance, Butchers and Murtherers of their own Souls, as well as of their Posterity.
O Lord, in Mercy behold this sinful, divided, and distracted Kingdom; and by thine Almighty Power, put a stop to that spreading Hypocrisie, Atheism, and Immorality, which every where abounds among us. Encrease the number of holy, lear∣ned,
 and painful Pastors in this our National Church; and in thy gracious Wisdom, over-rule, order, and dispose the Minds of all that are fitly qualified for that high and holy Cal∣ling, that they may join in that Communion, as the surest and tri∣ed Bulwark against Popery, the best Prop and Support of our Mo∣narchical Government; and which (whilst it continued at Ʋnity, and in Harmony of Worship) was the Beauty and Glory of the Reformation, and the Sanctuary for all distressed Protestants. Woe be to those subtil Foxes (the Jesuit and Sectary) that have been so long endeavouring to undermine and supplant it, in poisoning it with Error and false Doctrine; and pulling down its Fenc, to make may for the wild Boar, the practical Atheists and Debauchee, to root up, and choak all its sacred Seeds with Profaness and Sensuality.
Awaken, and convince (O Lord) all scandalous, ignorant, and slothful Clergy, and all profane, and vitious Magistrates, and Members of our Communion, with a dreadful apprehension of the Woes pronounced against all that cause such Offences, whereby thy ways are evil spoken of, and our holy and pure Religion reproached and despised by our Enemies round a∣bout us.
O Lord, I beseech thee (so far as it consists with thy Ho∣ly Will) prosper, and succeed my honest Design in this Work: Open the Eyes, and undeceive all those, who agree our Do∣ctrine (the Substance in our Established Religion) to be pure, and yet do separate from it into so many different Persuasions, (the Shell and Shadows of Religion,) to increase our Heats and Divisions, and lay us open (as a Prey) to our Enemies. Do thou, O Lord, by thine own over-ruling Grace, encline and dispose them, to return into the bosom of this our Church, that by good Living in one Communion, we may all win, and work one upon another, by brotherly Kindness and watchful Love, as the most likely means to heal all our Divisions, and to effect an universal Reformation among us, by restoring that Piety, Sobriety, and Righteousness in Christian Charity, and Harmony of Divine Worship, which for so many years kept up a
 venerable Awe of thy Holy Majesty in the Minds of Men, and rendered Religion amiable in this Kingdom.
O blessed Redeemer, thine own Pattern, whilst thou didst converse with Men, is the fairest Copy we can write after, and thine own Precepts and Counsels, our surest Guide and Instru∣ction: Thou didst both teach and practise Meekness, Humi∣lity, and Self-denial, as the surest Touch-stone of thy true Religion; and pure, and unmercenary, and impartial Love, and tender Compassion, towards all that bore the Aspect of Humanity. Thou hast made the knowledge of our Duty easie and plain, to all that will hear thy Voice, and attend to thy Teaching, though subtil Deceivers (for Worldly Design) la∣bour to render it dark and difficult: But both the Deceivers, and the (willingly) deceived, shall one day justifie thee as righteous in their Condemnation, that if they perish, it is be∣cause they would not, and not because they could not cross and resist their own corrupt Will, to comply with thy Holy Will, ac∣cording to what they knew, or might have known, in order to their own Happiness.
Grant, O thou Conductor of Souls, that we may all, through thy Grace, steer our whole Christian Course, by this thine own unerring Compass of Truth, between the two Extremes of Pride, Ambition, and Worldly Design, and Atheism, Debau∣chery and Immorality, through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom with thy Holy Majesty and blessed Spirit, Three Glo∣rious Relations in one God, be Glory and Praise for ever.
Amen.
