MADAM,
AS your Commands have
been able to strain all the
Sinews of my Soul into a
quick and faithfull Obe∣dience:
So, had they the power to im∣bue
it with that gentle softnesse and
tender Devotion, whence themselves
proceeded, this my Pen had bled out
the sweetest pangs that ever swelld the
Breast of any Seraphin. But finding
my Heart-strings too cough and restiff
for pliance to such delicious charmes;

they leave a necessity on me to beseech
your cautious perusall of these Lines,
wherein the jarring discords of my
confus'd apprehensions, and rugged
expressions may otherwise prove too
offensive to the harmony of so equall,
so well tun'd a Soul: in which I can
complain of this only fault, Your im∣posing
so strong and weighty a task
upon so slight, so weak, though,
MADAM,

Paris, 9. Sept.
1653.
