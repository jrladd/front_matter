SIR!
NOt to Dedicate This to Your Name and Patronage, were to commit a double Trespass; one against the Will and Pur∣pose of the Dead, (if that may bee cal∣ed a Trespass in this profane Age) an∣other against my own Obligations to Your singular Worth; which hath so highly engaged both the Autor and my Self, as that for mee to think of anie other Patrone then Your Noble Self, were both Ingratitude and Impietie: But the greatest Examples this Age can give mee, shall never prevail with mee to bee guiltie of either.
Wherefore, to You, (who durst bee charitable at such a time as that, and so Ingenuous, as to appear a Lover of Learning in this Age) to You (I say) do I present these
 Posthums of Your Learned, and now much-Lamented Client; a man so entirely affected to Learning, as that the very fore-sight of this Barbaritie (wherein Learning and Learned men were to bee the Objects of Scorn and Crueltie) broke his heart.
Time was, (even among the Heathen) that Learning was a sufficient Protection against Tyrannie; witness Antonius Triumvir, who, when Varro (his Enemie, and of a contrarie Faction) was Listed for Death, Hee thus gallantly superscribed his Name, — Vivat Varro Vir Doctissimus.
But I forbear: And having now (Sr!) too long perhaps insisted on the Caus of my Sorrows and this Dedication, I heartily recommend You to the Grace of Him, who is able to uphold You in these evil Daies; and to enable You, () to stand in this slipperie Age.
