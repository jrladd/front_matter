SIR,
AS the over-flowing of Nilus doth conti∣nually
leave many Seeds and Spawns of
Monsters behind it, so the late Inunda∣tion
of Schism in this Nation, hath left
many prodigious and monstrous Princi∣ples
with us; amongst the rest, That it's lawful for Sub∣jects
to take up Arms against their Prince in Defence of
Religion, or to prevent Popery. And this Doctrine I
must tell you, Sir, is become so Epidemical, that many of
the Religionists have adopted it into the Family of their
Faith. I have here in transitu, tanquam Viator Her∣mulas,
made some Reflections upon their pernicious The∣orem:
The Colours, I must confess, are laid in Water,
but some better Artists hereafter may lay them in Oyl.
Howsoever I do appeal to your Noble self, whose single
Opinion (in point of Loyalty) I more value, than the
Judgment of the most advanced Heads. I know, Sir,
you carry an Antidote in your Ears, and a Counterpest
in your Breast, against the Poison and Contagion of these
Principles. Your innate Loyalty hath taught you even
from your Cradle to bear Arms in defence of your Prince.

I am sure your Religion (which you profess) cannot
suffer you to take up Arms against your Soveraign; the
first hath made you gracious to your Prince, the other Re∣nowned
to all Posterity.; your Piety hath signallized your
Loyalty, and both have rendred you Illustrious. Sir, with
much Humility I beg your Pardon, and do rest
