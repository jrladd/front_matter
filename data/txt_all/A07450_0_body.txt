Most noble Prince.
IT pleased your High∣nesse, to heare this Sermon with patience, and afterwards to command it at my hands: which I offer vnto you (as Dauids seruants did their gifts for the Temple)1. Chron.
19.9. with a good heart wil∣lingly. It is an incomparable comfort
to all true professors (in the number of whom J desire to be accounted) that your Grace at these yeares is so religi∣ously disposed. The God of mercy fill you more and more with his blessings, that it may bee said of Prince CHARLES, as was spoken of our greatest Master Christ, (And the child increased in wisdome and stature and in fauour with God and man.)Luk.
2.52.
