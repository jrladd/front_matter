SIR, hauing no fitter occasion to manifest my du∣ty to your Worthinesse (though I haue often wisht matter more expressiue both of my loue & zeale) I haue aduentured rather to tempt your acceptance in this small presentment, worthy (no man will denie) in its proper Ornament, of an Honourable Patronage: Then by perpetuall neglect to incur the imputation of Ingra∣titude, a vice amongest the Heathen punishable, amongest Christians, contemptible. Herein therefore (right Generous) let me in lieu of all my friends, make confession of your many and extraordinary fauours, from time to time vouchsafed vs. In acknowledgment wherof, sithence we want power to de∣serue, yet giue vs leaue with thankfull overtures to remember. Protesting, that if you daigne to accept of this vnpolisht Tran∣slation, partly divulged vnder the shadow of your protection, for the pleasure of your vacant howers, but especially for the generall good of all English Gentlemen, when, eyther Time or better iudgment, shall furnish me with a more desertfull proiect, to prostitute it soly to the approbation of your most iudicious censure. Thus far presuming, that if it passe your allowance, I will aduenture neither to feare the discourtesy of the Cinicke, nor the sole-conceit of the Curious. In assurance whereof, being constantly warranted by the generous carry∣age of your Heroycall disposition, I esteeme it as rich in value as I account it happy in acceptance, hauing in it nothing so worthy as your fauour, wherevnto I wholie refer it.
