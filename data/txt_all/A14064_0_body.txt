THough dauÌ„ger he mickle
& fauour so fickle:
yet dutie doth tickle,
my fansie to wright:
concerning how prettie,
how fine & how nettie
good huswife should yettie
from morening to night.



Not mynedid by wrighting,
to kindle a spighting,
but sheaw by endighting,
as afterwarde tolde:
how husbandrye easith
so huswifrie pleasith,
& many purse greasith
with siluer & golde.



For husbandrye weepith
where huswifrie sleepith,
and hardly he creepith
vp ladder to thrift:
that wantith to bolde him
thriftes ladder to holde him
before it be tolde him,
be falles with out shifte.




Least meany shold feare me,
and others forsweareme,
of troth I do beare me
vpright as ye se:
ful mine did to loue all,
& not to reproue all,
but onely to moue all,
good huswifes to be.



For if I shold minde som,
or deskant behinde som,
& missing to finde som,
displease so I mought:
or if I should blend them,
& so to offend them,
what stir I should send them
I stand in a dout.



Though harmles I make it,
and some do wel take it,
if others forsake it
what pleasure were that:
naught else but to paine me.
& nothing to gaine me,
but make them disdaine me,
I wot ner for what.



Least som make a triall,
as clock by the dyall,
som stand to denyall,
som murmure & grudge:
geue iudgement I pray you,
for iustly so may you
so fansie so say you,
I make you my iudge.



In time, ye shall trye me,
by trouth, ye shall spie me,
so finde, so set by me,
according to skill:
how eauer tree growith
the fruit, the tree showith,
your ladiship knowith,
my hart and good will.



though fortune doth measure,
and I do lack treasure,
yet if I may pleasure
your honour with this:
then wil me to mend it,
or mend er ye send it,
or any where lend it,
if ought be amisse.
