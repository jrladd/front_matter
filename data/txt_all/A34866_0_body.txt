May it please Your most Excellent Majesty:
HOw unfit and unworthy a choice
I have made of my self, to ap∣pear
in a work of this nature,
mine own Reason, though ex∣ceeding
weak, hath sufficiently resolved
me: And notwithstanding Opinion better
than Truth can travel the world without a
Pasport, where there are as many internal
forms of Minds, as external figures of
Men; yet my hopes are, that by publish∣ing
the honour done by Your Royal Per∣usal
to the Manuscript, before it saw the
Presse, and recommending the same to
Your Majesties most honourable Privy
Council, this may obtain the favour of their
Debate, and receive the better common ac∣ceptation.
I have had it under my consideration
about four years, (and thought it a jewel un∣fit



to cast before such Governours:) What
esteem it will receive by others I cannot
promise to my self, my ambition in it is to
serve my Sovereign Lord and Countrey,
whereunto I am more obliged than many
others, in that Your Majesty hath dealt
so bountifully by,
Dread Sovereign,
