SIRE,
WHEN I observed your Majesties Care and De∣light in reading the Summary of the Life of Henry the Great to have given your Majesty some Sa∣tisfaction, and caused so great Joy in all France, who saw her King follow such glorious Exam∣ples, I thought my self obliged to add thereunto this little Collection,
which I have made of the bra∣vest Actions, and the most me∣morable Sayings of that August Monarch; That so the Picture which I have already presented to your Majesty may appear more finisht and perfect. In effect, Sire, these par∣ticulars do represent the Interior of his Soul, and express his Ge∣nius and his Inclinations more lively than all that has been said in the most glorious part of his History; and discovering to us the bottom of his Heart and Spi∣rit, they at the same time make us see that this generous Prince was such within, as he appeared without; and that he was not at
all like those who have nothing good but the Exterior, and who disguise dangerous Vices under beautiful Appearances. But, Sire, it must necessarily be acknowledg∣ed, that you have made a much better Picture of him in your Person and Conduct, beyond the performance of all the Pencils and Pens of the World. Further let me add, that in regard your Ma∣jesty is not displeased that I have the Honour to be near your Per∣son, and that thereby I have the Joy to see such great and glorious Actions at so little distance, I find my self engaged to commit them to writing, that so I may one day
attest them to all Europe, and to Posterity. I believe that when the Public shall see the History which I design to give them, they will confess, that the Parallel of your Majesty with Henry the Great will be most just, and that even the Glory of the Grandfather will receive new Splendor from that of his Grandson. I shall be at no trouble to invent any Artifice, or false Ornaments, to embelish the Work: I shall not need to employ therein any thing but Candour, and the simple Truth; and if I have any Reproach to fear, it will be that I have said less than Renown it self has pub∣lisht.
In effect, Sire, seeing that so noble Ayr, and that profound Wisdom with which your Majesty proceeds, I dare boldly, and with∣out Flattery fore-tell, that your Heroic Vertues will in a little time surpass those of Augustus, of Charlemagne, and of Henry the Great; and I hope also that, the Favours of Heaven continu∣ing, I shall see your Glory and your Posterity to equal the Desires which I daily make with that Zeal which ought to appear in,
SIRE
