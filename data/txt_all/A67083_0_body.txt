SIRS;
O you formerly was Dedicated the First Edition of this succeeding, though then imperfect Tract; and for your sakes principally did it then submit it self to the Censure of this Critick Age. It's now a bad time for so mean and Rustick a Subject to appear again, when every Shop and Library is re∣pleat with the Fruits and Labours of the most A∣cute Wits. Yet I hope it may obtain a better Wel∣come than heretofore, being Revised and Corrected, in many places Enlarged, and many new and ne∣cessary Experiments and Observations added: You also being every day more and more addicted to this Noble, though heretofore neglected Science; as is manifest from the Effects in most places discern∣able: It being easie for a Passant Traveller to distinguish the Villa's of the Ingenious from the Slothful, by the Improvements made in them; some being well Manured, and Planted with many curi∣ous Plantations of Fruit, and Avenues of Timber and other Trees, when others are bare and naked,
 to the shame and Ignominy of their Owners. I hope what I formerly wrote on this Subject, might be some inducement towards such improvement, amongst the many Elaborate and more Excellent Works: And I question not but this Second Edition, so much Enlarged, may more encourage and assist you in the Culture of your Farms to your best advan∣vantage, in the propagating and encreasing of such things that may most retaliate your Cost and In∣dustry, and most improve your Lands, not only for the benefit of your selves and Posterity, but the Kingdom in general; The several ways and means to accomplish the same, being here present∣ed to your view, well Pruned and Advanced. For which end, and no other, these Experiments and Observations have formerly been not with a little care composed, and contracted into so conve∣nient and brief a Method, and in such a fami∣liar Stile, suitable to the apprehensions of those they most concern; and now also made more useful, that they may answer your Expectation; which is the desire of
