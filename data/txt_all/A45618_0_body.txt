IT is not better known to you, most worthy Magistrats, that Government is the preserving Cause of all Societys, than that every Society is in a languishing or flourishing condition, answerable to the particular Constitution of its Government: And if the Goodness of the Laws in any place be thus distinguishable by the Happiness of the People, so the Wisdom of the People is best discern'd by the Laws they have made, or by which they have chosen to be govern'd. The truth of these Observations is no where more conspicuous than in the present State of that most Antient and Famous Society you have the honor to rule, and which reciprocally injoys the chearful influence of your Ad∣ministration. 'Tis solely to its Government that London ows being universally acknowleg'd the largest, fair∣est, richest, and most populous City in the World; all which glorious Attributes could have no Foundation in Hi∣story or Nature, if it were not likewise the most free. 'Tis confest indeed that it derives infinit Advantages above other

places from its incomparable Situation, as being an inland City, seated in the middle of a Vale no less delicious than healthy, and on the Banks of a Noble River, in respect of which (if we regard how many score miles it is navigable, the clearness and depth of its Channel, or its smooth and even Course) the Seine is but a Brook, and the celebrated Tyber it self a Rivulet: Yet all this could never raise it to any considerable pitch without the inestimable Blessings of LI∣BERTY, which has chosen her peculiar Residence, and more eminently fixt her Throne in this place. LIBERTY is the true Spring of its prodigious Trade and Commerce with all the known parts of the Universe, and is the original Planter of its many fruitful Colonys in America, with its numberless Factorys in Europe, Asia, and Africa: hence it is that every Sea is co∣ver'd with our Ships, that the very Air is scarce exemted from our Inventions, and that all the Productions of Art or Na∣ture are imported to this common Storehouse of Mankind; or rather as if the whole Variety of things wherwith the Earth is stockt had bin principally design'd for our profit or delight, and no more of 'em allow'd to the rest of Men, than what they must necessarily use as our Purveyors or La∣borers. As LIBERTY has elevated the native Citizens of Lon∣don to so high a degree of Riches and Politeness, that for their stately Houses, fine Equipages, and sumtuous Tables, they excede the Port of som Foren Princes; so is it naturally becom every Man's Country, and the happy Refuge of those in all Nations, who prefer the secure injoy∣ment of Life and Property to the glittering pomp and slavery, as well as to the arbitrary lust and rapine of their several Tyrants. To the same Cause is owing the Splen∣dor and Magnificence of the public Structures, as Palaces, Temples, Halls, Colleges, Hospitals, Schools, Courts of Judicature, and a great many others of all kinds, which, tho singly excel'd where the Wealth or State of any Town cannot reach further than one Building, yet, taking them all together, they are to be equal'd no where besides. The delicat Country Seats, and the large Villages crouded on all hands around it, are manifest Indications how happily the Citizens live, and makes a Stranger apt to believe him∣self in the City before he approaches it by som miles. Nor is it to the felicity of the present times that London is only in∣debted: for in all Ages, and under all Changes, it ever shew'd a most passionat love of LIBERTY, which it has not

more bravely preserv'd than wisely manag'd, infusing the same Genius into all quarters of the Land, which are in∣fluenc'd from hence as the several parts of the Animal Body are duly supply'd with Blood and Nourishment from the Heart. Whenever therfore the execrable design was hatcht to inslave the Inhabitants of this Country, the first At∣temts were still made on the Government of the City, as there also the strongest and most succesful Efforts were first us'd to restore Freedom: for we may remember (to name one instance for all) when the late King was fled, and every thing in confusion, that then the chief Nobility and Gentry resorted to Guildhall for protection, and to con∣cert proper methods for settling the Nation hereafter on a Basis of Liberty never to be shaken. But what greater Demonstration can the World require concerning the Ex∣cellency of our National Government, or the particular Power and Freedom of this City, than the BANK of Eng∣land, which, like the Temple of SATURN among the Romans, is esteem'd so sacred a Repository, that even Foreners think their Treasure more safely lodg'd there than with them∣selves at home; and this not only don by the Subjects of Absolute Princes, where there can be no room for any Public Credit, but likewise by the Inhabitants of those Com∣monwealths where alone such Banks were hitherto reputed secure. I am the more willing to make this Remark, be∣cause the Constitution of our Bank is both preferable to that of all others, and coms the nearest of any Government to HARRINGTON'S Model. In this respect a particular Com∣mendation is due to the City which produc'd such Persons to whose Wisdom we ow so beneficial an Establishment: and therfore from my own small observation on Men or Things I fear not to prophesy, that, before the term of years be expir'd to which the Bank is now limited, the desires of all people will gladly concur to have it render'd perpetual. Neither is it one of the last things on which you ought to va∣lue your selves, most worthy Citizens, that there is scarce a way of honoring the Deity known any where, but is either already allow'd, or may be safely exercis'd among you; Toleration being only deny'd to immoral Practices, and the Opini∣ons of Men being left as free to them as their Possessions, excepting only POPERY, and such other Rites and Notions as directly tend to disturb or dissolve Society. Besides the poli∣tical Advantages of Union, Wealth, and numbers of Peo∣ple,

which are the certain Consequents of this impartial Liber∣ty, 'tis also highly congruous to the nature of true Religion; and if any thing on Earth can be imagin'd to ingage the In∣terest of Heaven, it must be specially that which procures it the sincere and voluntary respect of Mankind. I might here display the Renown of the City for Military Glory, and recite those former valiant Atchievments which our His∣torians carefully record; but I should never finish if I in∣larg'd on those things which I only hint, or if I would men∣tion the extraordinary Privileges which London now injoys, and may likely possess hereafter, for which she well deserves the name of a New Rome in the West, and, like the old one, to becom the Soverain Mistress of the Universe.
THE Government of the City is so wisely and com∣pletely contriv'd, that HARRINGTON made very few Al∣terations in it, tho in all the other parts of our National Constitution he scarce left any thing as he found it. And without question it is a most excellent Model. The Lord Mayor, as to the Solemnity of his Election, the Magnificence of his State, or the Extent of his Authority, tho inferior to a Roman Consul (to whom in many respects he may be fitly compar'd) yet he far outshines the figure made by an Athe∣nian Archon, or the grandeur of any Magistrat presiding over the best Citys now in the World. During a vacan∣cy of the Throne he is the chief Person in the Nation, and is at all times vested with a very extraordinary Trust, which is the reason that this Dignity is not often confer'd on un∣deserving Persons; of which we need not go further for an Instance than the Right Honorable Sir RICHARD LE∣VET, who now so worthily fills that eminent Post, into which he was not more freely chosen by the Suffrages of his Fellowcitizens, than he continues to discharge the Func∣tions of it with approv'd Moderation and Justice. But of the great Caution generally us'd in the choice of Magistrats, we may give a true judgment by the present Worshipful She∣rifs, Sir CHARLES DUNCOMB and Sir JEFFERY JEFFERIES, who are not the Creatures of petty Factions and Cabals, nor (as in the late Reigns) illegally obtruded on the City to serve a Turn for the Court, but unanimously elected for those good Qualitys which alone should be the proper Re∣commendations to Magistracy; that as having the greatest Stakes to lose they will be the more concern▪d for securing the Property of others, so their willingness to serve their

Country is known not to be inferior to their Zeal for King WILLIAM; and while they are, for the Credit of the City, generously equalling the Expences of the Roman Praetors, such at the same time is their tender care of the Di∣strest, as if to be Overseers of the Poor were their sole and immediat Charge. As the Common Council is the Popular Representative, so the Court of Aldermen is the Aristocratical Senat of the City. To enter on the parti∣cular Merits of those Names who compose this Illustri∣ous Assembly, as it must be own'd by all to be a labor no less arduous than extremely nice and invidious, yet to pass it quite over in such a manner as not to give at least a Specimen of so much Worth, would argue a pusillanimity inconsistent with LIBERTY, and a disrespect to those I wou'd be always understood to honor. In regard therfore that the eldest Alderman is the same at London with what the Prince of the Senat was at Rome, I shall only presume to mention the Honorable Sir ROBERT CLAYTON as well in that capacity, as by reason he universally passes for the per∣fect Pattern of a good Citizen. That this Character is not exaggerated will be evident to all those who consider him, either as raising a plentiful Fortune by his Industry and Me∣rit, or as disposing his Estate with no less liberality and judg∣ment than he got it with honesty and care: For as to his pub∣lic and privat Donations, and the provision he has made for his Relations or Friends, I will not say that he is un∣equal'd by any, but that he deserves to be imitated by all. Yet these are small Commendations if compar'd to his stddy Conduct when he supply'd the highest Stations of this Great City. The danger of defending the Liberty of the Subject in those calamitous times is not better remember'd than the courage with which he acted, particularly in bringing in the Bill for excluding a Popish Successor from the Crown, his brave appearance on the behalf of your Charter, and the general applause with which he discharg'd his Trust in all other respects; nor ought the Gratitude of the Peo∣ple be forgot, who on this occasion first stil'd him the Father of the City, as CICERO for the like reason was the first of all Romans call'd the Father of his Country. That he still assists in the Government of London as eldest Alderman, and in that of the whole Nation as a Member of the High Court of Parlament, is not so great an honor as that he deserves it; while the Posterity of those Familys he supports, and the

memory of his other laudable Actions, will be the living and eternal Monuments of his Virtue, when time has con∣sum'd the most durable Brass or Marble.
TO whom therfore shou'd I inscribe a Book containing the Rules of good Polity, but to a Society so admirably constituted, and producing such Great and Excellent Men? That elswhere there may be found who understand Go∣vernment better, distribute Justice wiser, or love Liberty more, I could never persuade my self to imagin: nor can the Person wish for a nobler Address, or the Subject be made happy in a more sutable Patronage than THE SENAT AND PEOPLE OF LONDON; to whose uninterrupted increase of Wealth and Dignity, none can be a heartier Welwisher, than the greatest admirer of their Constitution, and their most humble Servant,
