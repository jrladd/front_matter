SIRS,
I Cannot but with a chearful Hu∣mility, declare my self under a double Obligation of all possi∣ble Respect and Service to your Honourable and most Loyal Frater∣nity, and particularly of my present Address, tho with so minute and home∣ly an Offering, which hath indeed in you a most encouraging Goodness to

promise, but in it self only the ve∣nerable Excellence of its Subject to sollicite a favourable Reception.
The first Obligation, is a Debt of Love and Honour; the Heathen could see this by the obscure twilight of Na∣ture, esteeming their highest Love and Honour to be their Countries indispen∣sible due, first, to the King or Supreme, by what Name or Title soever digni∣fied or distinguished; next, to them that are sent by, or set in Authority under him; Lastly, to the whole Com∣munity of fellow Subjects. And such as were their Affections at large to their Countries in general, such also were their more particular Propensi∣ons and Devoirs to the particular Places of their respective Nativities, which is my present behoof.
In this Ancient Corporation I drew my first Breath; and to this

therefore would gladly pay the first fruits of my Honest (howsoever un∣fortunate) Endeavours. But to this natural Incitement of Love and Ho∣nour, we have in you the happy Ac∣cession of a most generous and noble Loyalty: Loyalty! the grand Compre∣hension, in one Word, of all Publick and Political Virtue, so far forth as re∣fers to the Subjects; an abridgment, like Love, not only of the Principles of both Tables of Positive Divine Law, but also of the Fundamental and Unwritten Divine Law of Nature, those Common Notions and Transcripts of the Eternal Law, which are none other but the immutable Idea's of Religion, interwoven in the very Make and Ori∣ginal Contexture of our Beings; for what, but the peaceful Hands of Loyalty, beautiful as the Rosie Fingers of the Morning, preserves inviolate the Sacred Marriage of the Fear of

the Lord with that of the King; or (as it is equivalently phrased) of the Fear of the Lord with the Honour of the King? 'Tis this prevents, with a Golden Chain of most harmoniously conspiring Graces, the setting asunder of those whom God hath joined to¦gether: Nor can she indeed apprehend these two capable of a real Existence in a state of Separation; for our Fear of the Deity, and our Honour of Majesty, as like Jonathan and Saul, they are lovely and pleasant together in their Lives, so can they not be other than undivided in their Deaths; like Hippocrates's Twins, as they live, so must they dye, (which Heaven ever forbid) dye together, and dye in each others Arms: So that Loyalty, where∣ever she lights, tho on a Dunghil, car∣ries a commanding Lustre in her Face; but an advantageous setting off the Jewel in Generous and Noble Metals

(such as your selves); as it mightily commends its Beauty, so ought propor∣tionably to heighten its Value: But wherewithal then can I evidence a com∣mensurate Respect? Commensurate! nay, in any Measure competent to so much, and such excellent Worth? why in the present State of Truro, 'tis now (Thanks be to Heaven) easie to see awful Authority, and a most Rational, Ingenuous Candor, going Hand in Hand, and every where to the grief of Faction, but the Delight of God, and all honest Men, embracing and greet∣ing each other with a Holy Kiss; and certainly such a temperate Body will not expect more from its Denizen Ser∣vants, than the circumstances of their Habitation can dispose them to.
The thick and misty Air of a Mar∣shy, and on every side most depressed Vale, serves not for such Noble and Lofty Flights, as the benign Serenity

that blesses the flowry Banks of Isis and Cham, and those ever Springful Bowers of most happy Thames, where the Muses have their perpetual Resi∣dence, and Imperial Court. As for Sil∣ver and Gold, such as the more splen∣did and Heroical Pieces of Poesie, I have none; but such as the Cornish Muse affords, once in the Name of all that's Good, I humbly present you with, as the humble Specimens of an unmodish, hearty Gratitude: And this is a second Obligation I would have all Men to know I lye under to your Honourable and most Loyal Fraterni∣ty; a Debt of Gratitude, the most com∣prehensive of all Debts, and deeply found in Nature: I am (Sirs) undu∣bitably secured of no Inferior Place in your Favour, by many pregnant In∣stances, but more especially by your last most sensible demonstration of Kindness, the Character whereof is in∣delibly

wtitten in my Heart (as with a Diamond). Nor shall the Recogni∣tion of the same on all suitable occa∣sions be only ingeminated in my Mouth, but also seconded by agreeable Action, so far forth as the Sphere and Abilities, which the Divine Goodness hath allotted me to act in, and by, shall permit: For so abundant and uncontroulably Gracious have been your Condescentions, that they are to me in reality as Glorious and obliging as the so much celebrated Descent of the Amorous God to his Danaes in a Golden Shower, could ever be to the most credulous Admirers of Poetick Fables: So that (Sirs) 'tis not at all to be reckoned amongst Wonders, that I thus expose and hazzard the lit∣tle Reputation of my Parts, to evidence and evince the greater Power and Prevalence of my Gratitude: But to ease your Patience, I conclude with the

humble Oreizons of your Countrey Muse,
Pardon a slender Vapour coming near,
In this Ascent, towards your Noble Sphere:
Ascent ow'd to no want of lowly Sense,
But to your strong attractive Influence.
Such Sacrifice from earth, Heaven don't disdain,
Witness their kind returns in gentle Rain.
And therefore cannot you, in whom are all
The Constellations we can Heavenly call:
So all Church Organs sing: Nor is there Room,
Since you're great James's choice, for doubt to come.
Take then this Mite amidst your Ho∣nouring Croud,
Which only of your Crowning Name is proud:
A Pious Bird her humble Feathers brings,
To the The Temple of Diana at Ephesus. Ephesian Glory; Asia's Kings
Accept her Zeal amongst their no∣blest things:
Nor was Goats Hair, and Badgers skins put back
From his blest Seat The Sacred Tabernacle., who could no Purple lack:
'Tis not Heav'ns Greatness to encrease, but show
What to its Goodness we poor Mortals owe,
That all Religion means; therefore such Trees
As give no food, the chiefest Deities
Thought fit to  chuse. Great Jupi∣ter for Oak;
Apollo, Lawrel; Venus, Myrtle spoke;
Bacchus, the Ivy; Herc'les, Poplar took.
Then take you this, not meant to make you more,
But only show, that we your worth a dore▪
Your Worth, which stands storm-proof, as sacred Oaks,
And like the Lawrel, smiles at lightning strokes
Of envious eyes, of whose fresh leaves is made,
As of a Myrtle Grove a pleasant shade,
All to delight and shrowd, that sing your Name,
On Oaten Pipes, and teach the Woods the same;
The Woods the same! Woods once o∣bedient were,
To Orpheus, and danc'd to's charmful Air.
Nor did Rocks to Amphion less per∣form,
His Musick drew them mighty Thebes to form.
So may your gentle Airs rude Nature storm,
Storm to a Calm, till you bring on the stage,
The peaceful Worlds most Loyal Golden Age:
So Prays, Sirs,
