SIRS,
'TIS usual, when we present the World with any Work, to chuse some Worthy Pa∣trons, under whose Name it may appear, and, who can de∣fend it against the Attacks of En∣vy, Prejudice and Ignorance, which are three powerful Enimies to contend against, and such as cannot be overcome but by those who have Zeal and Love for Lear∣ning, and which are free and pro∣found in their Understandings.
'Tis this, Sirs, which has oliged me to offer this little Work to you, and to publish it under tho Glory of your Illustrious Society: there are none can more advantageously defend it than your selves, for you disarm Envy by that Zeal and Love which you have alwaies shown to Learning: you vanquish Prejudice by that Liberty and un∣interested Disposition which you retain in Physick and Medicine: and you destroy Ignorance by that inexhaustible Fountain of Learn∣ing which you injoy. Wilful Opi∣nion was never known to reign amongst you, for you consider Things with a Solidity and Facul∣ty of Mind truly extraordinary: Reason and Experience are the on∣ly Guids you employ in your In∣quisitions and Understandings:
Authority has no place with you if it be not accompanied with solid Reasons, and uncontrolable Expe∣rience. In a Word, it seems that Nature cannot withdraw her self from your View, nor hath con∣ceal'd any thing from you.
I had inlarged more in your Commendations did not your Mo∣desty restrain me, and oblige me to make an End: only with pro∣testing my self to be all my life time with Respect,
SIRS,
