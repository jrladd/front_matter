BLame me not (right honorable, and my especiall
good Lord) though my boldenes exceede the compasse of dis∣cretion,
and my rashnesse herein, surmount the limittes of rea∣son:
For though there be (vndoubtedlie) manie causes of great
importance and efficacie, which may vtterlie extinguish all
hope of your Lordships fauorable acceptance hereof, and chief∣lie
for that it wanteth such ornaments, as a work (worthie your
reading) ought to be furnished withall: yet my good Lord, hauing a certaine and
most assured knowledge, both of your Lordships most sincere, zealous, and loyall
affection, you haue alwaies carried towardes her most excellent Maiestie, (whose
happie daies I beseech the almightie may be innumerable) and also of the studious
care you haue euer fostered, for the prosperitie of this florishing, common wealth,
hath so animated my fearefull minde, that (casting away all doubtes which I might
iustlye stumble at) I haue (most bayardlike) burst out into this boldenes, and presu∣med
to present vnto your Lordshippe, this vnlearned pamphlet or smal treatise,
wherin I haue simply and plainly discouered the horrible and detestable tresons, late∣ly
practised by those graceles traitors and vnprofitable mēbers, which (thankes be to
God) latelie suffered condigne punishment for their traiterous enterprises: and also
made manifest the treacherous dealing of that vngodlie disposed woman, the Scot∣tish
Queene: with the sentence pronounced against her at Fodderingay, and cōfirmed
by her Maiestie, And further, haue therein shewed, what rewardes they alwaies reape
which attempt the like: and lastlie conclude with an exhortation to all her Ma∣iesties
liege people, to shunne such vngodlie and vnnaturall enterprises, together,
with a praier for the preseruation of her Highnes most royall person, her honorable
Counsaile, and the Commons of this Realme: humblie beseeching your Lordship
(of your accustomed goodnes, and louing encouraging, you haue alwaies vsed to∣wards
euerie one, whome you see forward in weldoing) to vouchsafe to protect the
first fruites of my labour, and whereas it (altogether) wanteth learning, to furnish it
with your fauour, so shal your Lordship yeeld more then I dare desire or can deserue,
and binde me foreuer, to rest at your honors commaund to the vttermost I may: not
omitting my praier vnto the almightie, to sende your Lordship a happie new yeare
and many: to his (onely) glorie, and the earnest desires of all your welwillers.
