Madame,
MAy it please you to giue me leaue to grace my Labours with your Noble Name, which shalbe vnto them as much grace as a good Light vnto a Picture. If herein there were any thing worthy of respect, they do belong vnto your Laip. in many respects. For would I be a Trumpeter of your priuate fa∣uours, I could sound out an Allarum both of your pitty & Piety which you shewed both vntome & mine, whilst I liued at Garlick-Hithe among those louing & liberal Parishioners. But I know you are too sound to loue such Sounds, else would my poore Childrens bellyes, and mine owne backe (which you haue so often filled, & this time presently cloathed) declare your praise in the Presse. Well then, what shall I render vnto you for your bounty but duty, honour & pray∣ers? These premised of all that know what you haue bene vnto me and mine, I thinke doe make
them thinke, that if ought els might be added, it were no more then became a thankfull man.
Take this then vertuous Lady (for a Newe-Yeares guift) that hath nothing besides himselfe to giue vnto you; which indeed I present, not so much to Instructe you, as to remember you in that which you are so well learned in: and that is TRVE HVMILITY, which you finding by a comfortable experience to be the HIGH∣WAY TO HONOVR, you doe well to tread that Tracte; And good Madam goe on, for that will truely ennoble you, and bring you to great honour & high exaltation. In which progresse of Yours, if this poore Sermon of mine might be either a Light, Guide or Staffe, it would glad my heart, and reioyce my soule, and make me thinke that my labour had in some measure an∣swered your Laips. loue, though not to the full. Will you Patronage so weake a worke? if not, yet pardon the workeman, who vndertooke the taske onely as a Token of a faithfull minde, who euer desires to shewe himselfe
