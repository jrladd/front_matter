I Knowe, mi most dis∣cret and vertuous Ma∣ster, that some amonge other shall be fonde, rea∣die to blame this wor∣ke, bringinge for them, that no nede it was of suche purtreatures, sith we haue at libertie the∣self stories, wherin we mai muche better knowe the pure truth reding the wholl, then to staie at a thinge vncertaine and drawen at pleasure: Some other shall be (knowe I well) wiche shall endeuer themselues to sai, that it is a thinge open∣lie
forbiden be the lawe of God, and allthought the strong and faithfull mai without ani danger be∣holde them, vsing therof after their owne goode discretion, that neuerthelesse, being sen of the weake and simple, it mai be vnto them occasion of fall: Other lickwise that, sith the hearing aboue all our fiue naturall wittes most diuin is allone nedfull to saluation, wherwith we, as with an instrument mete, must take and receaue the pro∣messes of God offred and presented vnto vs in the holie scriptures, contenting ourselues we shulde red them, with vnderstanding therto required, and vndertake no further. To whome we, wil∣ling most faine them satisfie, aunswer: that, all be it the letter well vnderstanded geueth plaine and perfette knowlege of the thinges, neuerbe∣thelesse the true and lyuelye purtreatures and representations therof mai be, and (to sai better) are good and profitable meanes, wherbe we mai shirtlie and with ease, kippe and graue in min∣de the wholl meaning of it, wiche otherwise without often reding, and with muche werines
of witte might easilie be forgotten being vnto vs in stede of true, cleare, and manifest argumen∣tes of the wholl subiect. For what a meane more shirt, sure, and with no little pleasure easie might ani man finde, to teache his childerne, and suche as are not sen in the Bible withall, then to shewe them, the stories well drawen, and lyuely pourteated nothing laking therto, but all thinges therin sette out entierelie, afterward declaring them hollie that, wiche thei represente? Or what greater a pleasure, and recreation of minde might a studious man haue, knowing all readie the sto∣ries, and being wel vsed, and sen therin, the 2 to se presentlie before his eies the thinges self, wiche he had red to be passed longe before, the figure and the letter coming, and agreing so well, that thei seme properlie to be none other, but one self thinge, disagreing onlie in this, that the storie telleth thinges all readie passed, the wiche the figure as calling backe to the present, sheweth plainlie with all euidencie to the eie. Nowe as for that wiche the other might sai, that to drawe and pourtreate
is forbidden vnto vs be the lawe and commaun∣dement of God, I graunt that, for to worship∣pe it, if then the weacke and simple (as thei sai) do fall, that is to be imputed to them, not the figures: sith so muche lacke that thei bringe and prouocke to idolatrie, that rather thei tourne cleane awai frome it, putting befor the eies the sore punisshementes and paines, wherwith the childerne of Israel were punisshed, when thei committed suche an abominable deed: As fore the reste, thei mai se therin, but all exemples of good and holie liuing, that is to wite, howe god hath all waies ben readie to healpe, and beare fauour to suche as did walke rigthlie in his pa∣thes and waies: contrariewise greuouslie to pu∣nisshe them, wiche rebell vnto him wolde none other, but folow their owne will, and wicked minde: to be shirt thei mai lerne eurie where the∣rin to flie, and eschewe sinne, and with good a∣dresse to folowe vertu. As for the thirde, truth is that be the hearing nedes we must receaue the faith: iet neuerthelesse in her degree the syght is
greatlie required, and nedfull, therwith to knowe Goddes glorie and magnificencie in his workes, cō∣sidered in the beginning he mad heauen and earth, with other visible workes, acording our capacitie shewing, and manifesting himself vnto vs, to the ende, that be this meane we might come to the knowlege of him, and seing plaine, that suche his workes were fare more then of man, might knowe lickewise that it behoued the worckman therof to be without ani compareson mor excellent then anie man was. If therfore be the meanes of the eie we come to so a high and diuin knowlege, I can thinke non other, but that in this it be goode and profita∣ble so that we will not abuse therof, the wiche thinge might also happe of the hearing. For who colde let ani man, that shulde heare tell or red some storie neuer so godlie or shulde tell or red it him∣self, to imagine some idolatrie in his minde? and that is liekwise against the lawe and commaun∣dement of God, being not onlie exteriour, but also interiour. If theniwil so bringe and call backe thinges passed, red and heard in the trew, and
holie stories of the olde Testament, that the eie mai also enioie therof, of a truth the intention and minde, nor the ende also, mai be but good, and godlie. The wiche thinges with miself right well considered, I haue thought it mete to endeuer miself to translate the argument of eche figure in Englishe meter, being lickewise putte in sixe other languages, to the entent that the countre, wherin I had ben nourrisshed and brought vp, shulde in no wise remain bastard allone, his tonge kipping her place amonge other, readie to bring him licke comoditie. This therfor be me vndertaken and ended, kipping eurie wherlicke measure, the thirde person actiue of the Present, with the Aoriste, lickewise the Participle passiue of the preterite at discretion, as comonlie in the speache is vsed, the contractions also of the tonge obserued, morouer in the Orthographye leauing y to the greke wordes, vsing of our owne, as I thought it mete and con∣uentent, I being of the Frenshe nation, for mi sauegarde and the workes, haue fonde none mo∣re sure, then iou mi vertuous master presupposed
that ie borne in the countre, to the wiche naturallie am affectionat, are at this time Embassadour towarde the Kinge of mi naturall lande, douting no wise, but if iou will vouchesaue to take in bande to kippe it a litle and defende, vnder the bu∣ckler of iour fauour, that without anie lost, or dam¦age shall remaine woll, and harmelesse. For I knowe right well, that iour good iugement is in so great a reputation with eurie one, that wither∣war die shall drawe, all without ani withstan∣ding will folowe iou. Truth is, that the worke is vnworthie to compeere before iour Master shippe, so muche laketh that iou ought to receaue it, ne∣uerhethlesse it shall plense iou, to looke a little vpon the good affection, and minde wherwith it is presented: and so doing ie shall encorage me to geue meself herafter to that thinge, wiche, mai be, shall be better worth, to the seruice of iour Mastershippe, whose lowlie and humble seruaunt I am, and shall be.
