SIR,
NOne are so much obliged to Laws as Monarchs, since by them Millions whom cor∣rupt Inclination, and mi∣staken Interest tempt to shake their Thrones, are yet forced by these to defend them, and find great satisfaction in the reasonableness and gentlenss of that kind of force; By those Your Majesties Predecessors were able to Govern us very long, without any other Arms: And when successful Usurpers got the most victorious Armies in Europe, these Armies were perswaded by Law to serve You and ruine them, tho they saw in Your service a dissolu∣tion of that Society for which they had with much

Courage, but no Justice so often exposed their lives: To prevent which for the future, provident Law sett∣led on Your Majesty, suitable Revenues to defend Your Authoritie, and therein shewed that the safety of the King and Law were inseparably joyned.
It is to our IAMES'S that we owe the great Bo∣dy of our Laws, and so there lyes a special obligati∣on upon Your Majesty to cherish them as their Off∣spring, to maintain them as Your surest and least ex∣pensive Guards, and to look on them as the only Counsellours that can neither be byassed by partiali∣ty nor interest.
But because Your Majesty has a special esteem for Heroes, and Courage; Allow me to represent to you that all those eminent Romans, who conquered the World, were raised by Pleading, and the Command of Ar∣mies were rewards bestowed by the suffrages of the People on those who Pleaded best for them; nor did Cesar (as their Story observes) take him to the Camp, but because he loved rather to be first there, than se∣cond to Cicero at the Bar, where if he had stayed, he had not destroyed his native Countrey, which Cicero

who continued to Plead, so wisely preserv'd. That is the most generous heart, which is warmed by Reflection, elevated by the hopes of Fame, and used to Victory; And no Reflections are so strong as those of men always imploy'd in reasoning; Fame has no such Trum∣pet as Eloquence; nor can Courage give so many and solide Victories as Reason does, and such Cou∣rage does the love of Justice inspire in those who a∣dore it, that our Profession has had its own Martyrs too, who dar'd to die for it, without being diverted by action, from looking fixedly on the terrours of death, or comforted by the hopes of escaping it, as Souldiers in Battels are. The vertuous Papinian is a glorious instance of this, who being chief Minister of State to his Emperour, after he had illustrated the Law by many learned Volums before he attained to the age of 36. choosed rather to die than justifie a barbarous act even in his Prince & Master; This only use of our Reason we want under Your Majesties hap∣py Reign, you being more unwilling to command what is unjust, than any of Your Subjects would be to suffer. And it was, Sir, the attending Your Royal Bro∣ther & You, that hightn'd thus in me an esteem of Law, for I could not but admi that fixt Justice which

govern'd so absolutely two Glorious and Wise Mo∣narchs, and made so many thousands happy under them, amongst whom none is more sensible of that general Happiness, and of Your Majesties speci∣al Favours, than,
May it please Your MAIESTY,
