RIght Honourable, and illustrious Ladie, it is not the worthines, or a∣ny witty conceite, more then ordinary contained in this little and vnwor∣thie worke (if at least it be worthie to be called a worke) that hath imboldned mee to present the same vnto your Ho. most fauourable perusing and protection, but your Honors former fauor hath partly emboldned me, and the singu∣lar Subiect, our late & dearest Soueraign,
 whereupon the first Treatise called the Mourning Weed is framed (if needes I would presume to publish it) hath deser∣ued to haue the same presented to the eyes of your compassionate affection, so loyally affected, and so louingly beloued of her most gracious Maiestie, as you were.
Not beauteous Ladie, that I would here∣by cause the fountaine of your moodie mind a fresh to bee broken vp, & the wel∣springs of your eyes to bedew againe your cherefull cheekes with brinnish teares, trickling downe your Honors face; but rather therby to recomfort your sorrowful spirite with this special confection or con∣sideration, namely that Princes (though neuer so peerelesse) are mortall and borne to die, as the freshest flower is in a mo∣ment withered.
Withall right Ho. this Meditation shall bring a true moderation to your Noble mind, to keep the golden meane, between vnmeasurable mourning, and vnreasona∣ble reioycing; neuer to reioyce more for
 any earthly glorie, neither to account bet∣ter of any worldly honor, then vsually you doe of the fayrest flowers that any earthly gardē can yeeld forth; nor neuer to mourn more for the lacke or losse therof, then for the losse of those thinges, that are most fraile and subiect to fading: Labouring euermore to aspire (as our late most graci∣ous Soueraigne euer did) to that true ho∣nour which is atchieued by humility, the keeper of vertue, and by religion or piety the Crowne of glory; to the encrease of glory and fame to endlesse posterity in this life, and to the fruition of all ioy and per∣fect felicity in the life to come. Finally (deare Madam) this conceite shall also mi∣tigate your sorrow, for your late derest Mis¦tresse and Soueraigne (if your Honor con∣ceiue as the truth is) that this Mourning weede is not made onely for your honors wearing, but as all the Ladies of honor, and others in this land, haue like cause measurably to mourne, for the losse of our late beloued Queene, & the more compa∣ny,
 the more is the comfort as wel in wai∣ling as reioycing, so all according to their leysure, place and calling, if their honors please, may take part with your honor in this weed, and so weare or teare the same, as it shalbe thought meet, eyther to be per∣used or refused onely hoping your honor (for the duty I beare you) will accept my sincerity, howsoeuer any other (that knows not my hart) shal censure me hard∣ly, for audacious temerity: crauing pardon for my rude tediousnes, and tedious rude∣nes, in all duty and loue, I humbly take my leaue: leauing your Honor and your Ho∣nors honor, my Right honourable Lord, together with your Honors Progenie, to the supreme and highest Maiesty; and to the guidance of his Grace, that raigneth in eternity.
 Lon∣don, the 20. of May. 1603.
