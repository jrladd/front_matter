My Lord,
THese Memorials,
respecting the An∣cient
and Modern
State of this great
and Renowned Ci∣ty,
of which (un∣der
His Majesty)
Your Lordship enjoys the Supreme
Magistracy, cannot find a more Pro∣per,

or more Honourable Patron than
Your Lordship; considering the High
Place You hold in that Meridian for
which This Discourse is Calcula∣ted.
The General Grief expressed by
all Loyal English Protestants, for
Your Lordships late Indisposition, and
the General Rejoycing amongst them,
for Your Happy Recovery, as a Mer∣cy
to this City, (of both which, the
Presenter of this Address was in part
a Witness and Partaker) are Eviden∣ces
both of Your Lordships Good Ad∣ministration
in so Eminent a Dignity,
aud the Universal Satisfaction of
this Famous Metropolis in Your Go∣vernment.
Your Prudent, Zealous, and Cou∣ragious

Conduct in these Perillous and
Menacing Times, suitable to those
Never-to-be-forgotten Speeches, de∣livered
by Your Lordship, and Your
Eminent and Worthy Predecessor,
Sir Robert Clayton, at the Time
of Your Election to this August Ma∣gistracy,
has engaged all True Pa∣triots,
and Abhorrers of Foreign and
Domestick Vassalage, (a thing at∣tempted
to be Introduced by those
Execrable Mediums of Assassina∣ting
the Sacred Person of His Roy∣al
Majesty, and Everting His Go∣vernment)
to give Your Lordship
an Eminent Place in their Esteem,
and Justly Obliges this Great City
to Honour Your Lordship in a De∣gree
suitable to so High a Merit.

My Lord,
I hope You will vouchsafe me
Your Pardon for my Presumption in
Publishing this small Product of
my Recess and Solitude, under the
Patronage of Your Honourable Name,
for which, and the Famous City You
Govern, I have so High a Vene∣ration,
that it Obliges me to be

London,
June 24.
1681.
