TO thee) deare Mother) in whose learned lap,
I once repos'd, and from whose batt'ning papp
I suckt the milke of knowledge, send I these
Which if they please, as I could wish then please
I'me honor'd by them, and will still renew
My loue to them, because they'r lik'd by you.
But these are feeble, scarce Penfeathered,
And like young Lapwings run with shell on head;
Nor can I blame them: for belike they'ue heard,
How I was young when I to you repair'd:
Growing in some sort riper; and these doe
Expect the like, that they shall thriue so too:
Which I confesse lies onely in your power,
For if you smile they liue, die if you loure;
Nor need I feare, for I did neuer know
Any darke Cloud sit on your smoother brow.
