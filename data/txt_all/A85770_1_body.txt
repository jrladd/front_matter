THis large display of thy Mysterious Art,
Each where displays such Lustre, Labour, Learning,
To every one that can with due discerning
Survey thy Volume over every part;


As there is none, Noble or Gentle heart,
(And onely such this subject is concerning)
That can deny thee (thine own vertues earning)
The praise and praise of thy divine desert,


If any Criticks currishly repining,
Bark at thy Light, their furie is thy
foile,
For, more we praise such Lamps so publike shining,
And ever pray they never fail of Oyle.


So fare thou (Cosin) for this Work of thine,
Which with thy Name, shall now eternize mine.
