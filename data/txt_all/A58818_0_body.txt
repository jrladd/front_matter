MADAM,
IN Obedience to Your Desires, I here
present You with the Discourse I deli∣vered
at the Funeral of Your Excellent
Husband, and my never to be forgotten
Friend. And indeed considering how little
there is in it, I have no other Apologie
to make for the Publication of it, but
that I could not without some degree of

Incivility refuse it, being urged with the
concurrent Requests of Your Ladiship, and
the rest of those my worthy Friends his dearest
Relatives. Not that I altogether despair
of its having some good Influence upon So∣ber
and Attentive Readers. There are
some Thoughts in it which are apt enough
to Inspire considering Minds with good
Affections and Resolutions. The Text,
I am sure, contains excellent Sense in it,
and the Argument is mighty Serious and
Momentous: and how meanly soever I
have managed it, some honest Reader, I
hope, may from hence take occasion to sup∣ply
my defects out of his own Meditations,
and so to improve it to his everlasting Ad∣vantage.
And as for Your Ladiship, I
hope the perusal of it, instead of reviving

Your Sorrows for Your Dear Loss, may
be some way Instrumental to Animate You
with a firm and vigorous Resolution, to pur∣sue
that Blessed State, wherein This, and all
Your other Losses here, will ere long be a∣bundantly
repaired in a most joyous and ever∣lasting
Fruition. And This, MADAM,
is my hearty Prayers as well as my hope;
who am,
Your Ladiships
Obliged and Faithful
Servant,
