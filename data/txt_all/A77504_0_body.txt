Madam,
I Plead no ex∣cuse for the homelinesse of this present. Whatever the Workmanship be, sure I am the matter is such, as shall find acceptance at your La∣dyships
 hands. I question not but your Honour hath often read of what esteem the Typicall Brasen Serpent was with the Israelites,2 King. 18.4. even then when it was out of date, a bare Nehushtan, no more worth then what the metall weighed: And I presume you have as often heard what ho∣nour (at least) the ignoranter sort of the Romish perswasion are wont to give to the Cru∣cifixes of their own making: Both of them superstitiously and idolatrously yeilding that respect to the shadow, which
 is appropriate to the sub∣stance. This it is which I here present to your Honours view; The Mystical Brasen Serpent; the Reall Crucifix, Christ himselfe exalted upon the Crosse. Of whose Magne∣ticall Vertue, I doubt not but your precious soule hath al∣ready had so much experi∣ence, as that you earnestly desire to feele more of it. In this way, if these my poor labors may contribute ought either to your selfe, or any other, I shall blesse that God who hath made use of
 me as his Instrument in so honourable a service. In the hope and confidence hereof, I shall put them into your Ladyships hand, and rest
Great Yar∣mouth, June 24. 1642.
