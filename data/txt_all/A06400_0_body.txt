MOST Renowned and dread Soueraigne: as heretofore I haue presumed to shrowd the first fruites and degrees of my studies, vnder your Highnesse Name and protection. So now both humble and en∣tire affection haue moued me to present this Treatise to your royall View as a Testimonie of humble duetie, to expresse my poore, yet vnfeigned zeale. For to your Maiestie the protection of all our doinges doe iustly be∣long: and to your Highnesse are wee princi∣pally bound to doe all Seruice, the which I being willing to performe, and also tendring the commoditie and benefite of my natiue Countrey (which GOD willing no occasi∣on shall cause me to omit) I haue published

this Treatise and these my painefull labours to exonerate my selfe of the burthen which euery man is bounde to vndertake for the Common wealth: if my industrie could haue produced better effectes it would reioyce to passe vnder the protection of so excellent & mightie a Prince. But the Arcadians can giue Pales but a fleece of woolle, the Athe∣nians a dish of Oliues to Pallas, and my selfe haue nothing but these vnpollished lines to present to your royall Maiestie. May it thē please your Highnesse, as Minerua harbored an owle vnder her target, Cytherea a defor∣med Cyclops in her louely bosome, and A∣pollo the night-rauen vnder his heauenly Lute: to accept in good part the trauailes of your humble subiect & vassall, which I hum∣bly offer to your Highnesse, praying dayly that all the blessinges in heauen may increase vpon your Maiesties Person and Progenie to your Princelie content and immortall glorie. 
Giuen at London the xx. of Aprill.
