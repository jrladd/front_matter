May it please your Grace,
THE kind Acceptance which my former Discourse upon this Subject found at your Graces hands, hath given me Encouragement and Con∣fidence to prefix your great Name to this; which indeed should have been presented to your Noble Patronage long ago, but that the late Controversies with the Romanists (wherein I thought my self bound to take my share) and a great many unexpected Accidents since, have hitherto hindred me from bringing it even to that little Perfection wherein it now appears. Besides, Madam, the Subject being altogether Practical and directive of the Conscience, a little time was not enough for that Conside∣ration and Care, which a matter of such a tender and weighty Nature must require, e∣specially since my design from the beginning, was, not only to inform Communicants, but moreover to lend such Assistance to all others,

in order to a right understanding of their Duty, as I hoped might serve to promote the great Ends of Christianity in general. To this purpose, I have somewhat largely and particularly discoursed of these things which concern all sorts and ranks of Christians, as Faith, Repentance, Charity, and Perseve∣rance; to which I thought fit to add in the last place, a short Platform of a Christian Life, collected out of the Holy Scriptures, and digested into little, that every one may see, as it were at one view, the Nature, Ex∣cellence, and Easiness of that Ʋniversal Obe∣dience which the New Covenant exacteth at all our Hands: and all this I resolved and endeavoured to do in such a plain and clear manner, that I might be serviceable to those of the most ordinary and vulgar Capacities, because they need Instructions most of all.
I confess, Madam, that in saying this, I seem to have made an Objection against my self, as to this Dedication; and fear that all those who have the Honour to know your Grace, will be startled to see a little Book, intended for ordinary Capacities, presented to a Person of such eminent Parts and Judgment, as well as Quality. But I hope the wonder will cease, when once it is considered, that the whole design of this Piece being to excite and quicken Men to a serious Practice of Religion, I could not but look upon it as your Graces due,

were there no other reason but this, that your Grace is a great Example of Virtue and a truly Christian Life in all particulars; which, God be thanked, I can very safely affirm and tell the whole World, without the least guilt of Flattery. But besides, Madam, my Personal Obligations to both your Graces, for your great and continual Favours to me and mine, and the tenderness you are pleased to shew us daily, do challenge from me all possible Expressions of Honour, and dutiful Affection; and all too little, I am sure; not any thing indeed in comparison of that Service which I should, and with all my Heart would do, were it in my Power. Among some Discouragements I have met with in the World, I bless God, the great comfort of my life is, that I enjoy so plentiful a share of your Graces goodness, with all Freedom and Gratitude I acknowledge my self to be in that respect, as happy a Man as lives. The Sta∣tion I am now in, I was unexpectly put into by the desire of both your Graces, and by your Zealous Applications to some great Friends, who could have no other reason to consider me but for the sake of your Graces, whom they were ready to gratifie for your be∣ing such true Friends and Ornaments to our Church, and the whole Protestant Religion. Your thus transplanting me into your Graces own Neighbourhood, as it was an argument

of the most kind Intentions, that I should spring and thrive afresh under the influence of your Favour; so is it a mighty Advan∣tage to my Ministry, which is now assisted with such Noble Comments upon Christianity, and Examples of it, as may prove more o∣perative than any Discourses of mine. Ʋpon these Accounts, Madam, all the labours I can bestow, can be but so many Expressions of Thankfulness; which I humbly intreat both your Graces to accept of, being all that I can tender, besides my earnest Supplicati∣ons to Almighty God, evermore to continue and encrease his Goodness to your Graces and your Noble Issue; and to enrich you with all the Blessings of Heaven and Earth; which is, Madam, the daily Affectionate Prayer of
Petworth, Feb 20. 1691/2
