Madam,
DEdications are usually made to Persons of your Ladiship's high Character, as marks of Gratitude, or Respect due to 'em: This of mine is of that nature, there being no one to whom I owe more Acknowledgments, or a greater Honour than to your Ladiship. Romances and Playes are generally such Books, whose Fronts are honour'd with Names of your Ladiship's Sex; but I have made choice of this Serious and Weighty Subject, as believing it most suit∣able to your Inclinations. The Matter of it is Grave and Solid, but withal De∣lightful, it being writ in an Eloquent, and yet unaffected Style; I have endea∣vour'd

to make it not less so in our own Tongue. If your Honour finds any Sa∣tisfaction in the reading of it, I shall be∣lieve the Pains I have taken in it suffici∣ently requited; and nothing will more encourage me to Attempts of the like na∣ture, than your Ladiship's Approbation of this. Because such Applications as these, if tedious, are presumptive, I'll only beg leave humbly to assure Your Ladiship, that I am,
Madam,
