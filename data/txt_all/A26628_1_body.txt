May it please Your Excellencies,
THis mine humble Appeal to God and the King, being designed to be presented to His MAJESTY before the Rising of the Parliament; but the Printer not being able to get it ready in time, and His MAJESTY being gone out of the Land, I therefore thought I must had stayed for His Return; but the Out∣ragiousness of one Sir Richard Blackam admits no delay, being such, as by force to seize and take away my Goods, in the stead of paying me Money, and restoring unto me sundry Notes for sundry Thousand Pounds, which in Kindness only I had accommodated him with∣all: For Sir Richard having, contrary to all Agreement with me, by sundry Arrests forc'd me to a Refferrence unavoidably; and I having accordingly made choice of one Mr. John Freeman to be a Refferree for me against one Sir Alexander Rigbey, a Refferree Sir Richard had chosen for himself; who thinking fit to go off without effecting any thing in the matter, Mr. Freeman became sole Refferree; and Sir Richard having smiled upon and insinuated himself into him, he did not at all consider me or my Case, (notwithstanding I gave him caution, and told him how that Sir Richard would Wheedle a Thousand of him and me;) neither would Mr. Freeman regard any thing I could say for my self, but plainly told me, when I spake to him any of the Things material for me, sometimes, I doe not mind That; and at other times, I doe not regard That; and became so wholly enclined to his Interest, as to Award me to pay him 380 Pounds, in the stead of making him to pay me 1018 Pounds, without giving any manner of Reason for it; but only said (when I asked him the Reason) I doe not know; so it is, and I can doe no otherwise; and if you were in Blackam's Clothes, you would doe the same Things that he doth: And afterward became so very hard upon me, as to make me give him Security for my complyance with his Award, by causing me to order my Correspondent at Alleppo to consign unto him some Goods of mine of greater Value; and afterwards Sir Richard Blackam refusing to doe his part (which was easie, being only to deliver up my Notes upon Oath, because lent him in kindness only; and I did not, nor doe know how many they were, or for what Summs) the Award became void. Yet afterwards, to please the said Sir Richard (as I believe, because Mr Freeman told me himself) Sir Richard had sold him my Goods for 50 l. less than he was to allow me for them, which was scarce half their Value as then worth; for he would needs perswade me to sell them at very low Rates to Sir Richard, and make him a Bill of Sale of them; and in the stead of my Notes, laboured vehemently with me to take Sir Richard's Bond: And because I re∣fused so to doe, he did in his Rage tear the Bill of Sale he had appointed, and swore in those very Words, BY GOD I WILL NOT CONCERN MY SELF, OR MEDDLE ANY MORE WITH THE MATTER. Whereupon, as I thought it but reasonable, I wrote the necessary Orders to my Correspondent, to pre∣vent

my Goods coming to his Hand, which I had ordered above a Year before to be con∣signed unto him: For which fact, though mine Orders came too late to prevent, and my Goods came consigned to him; yet he did upbraid and scandalize me upon the Exchange, as if I had done some notorious Crime or unjust Action, and, contrary to his said Oath, received and wilfully detained my said Goods from me; notwithstanding, at their arrival, I had desired him either to secure them, or deliver them to me. And now whether it be by Combination, or not, I know not; nor should I had known it, if Sheriff Blewet had not told me on the 3d of June last. But, it seems, Sir Richard Blackam, by a Replevin from the Sheriffs, hath, with Officers and others, leaping over his next Neighbour, Mr. Free∣man's Wall, forceably taken away three Bales of my Silk, part of my said Goods in Mr. Free∣man's Hands; keeps all my Notes for I know not how many Thousand Pounds, and 1018 Pounds he ought to pay me, if Contracts and Promises ought to be performed; and what he will doe next, I know not. Wherefore I humbly pray, that he may answer and give speedy satisfaction to all the matters; for though some doe talk him Rich, and worth much; yet the more considerate sort of people believe him to be so far from it, as to be worse than nothing. Wherefore I doe humbly pray I may not be delayed, but that in all points he may be obliged to satisfie and fulfill his Contracts with, and all his Promises to me, and by wicked Wheedles not be at liberty to evade, and may give good reason for his de∣faming and burying me alive for so many Years last past, as he hath done. And now, on the 30th of June last, one Warner Dawes, an Attorney, formerly complained of, hath caused an Execution to be served upon my Goods, breaking open my Counting-house Dore, Trunk, and Ca∣binet-Locks, spoiling and imbezling away many Things whilst I was getting out a Summons for his Appearance before the Lord Chief Justice, to shew Cause why, having accepted of Bond-Security for the Plaintiff's Debts of the Defendant, proceeds afterwards to take the De∣fendant's Goods in Execution, without re-delivering the said Defendant's Bonds; and ac∣quainting him, that the said Harwood the Plaintiff would not accept the same; with which, though duely served, yet he evaded his Appearance for two Days together: And though 'twas Mr. P. Brunskell's Debt for which I being bound, had Assigned sundry Bonds; yet if I had not moreover paid the Moneys, they would had carried away my Goods, perhaps of ten times the value; and hath since said, He would had blown off the Matter of fact with an Affida∣vit, if had appeared before the Judge, as Mr. Brunskell told me; and therefore he let him go.
Now, since 'tis so, that Attorneys can thus abuse Men, and by Affidavit can blow off Mat∣ter of fact, and clear themselves, as he said he would doe, I humbly hope my demand for due Protection and Justice may be without any offence to Your Excellencies; but being duely considered, allowed and approved of by Your Excellencies, I may be righted, and made more capable of serving my King and my Country: If not, and Your Excellencies, being the King's Vicegerents, shall so think it fit, I humbly pray for an honourable Death, rather than any longer to live under such Oppressions and Injustice, manifested in mine Un∣parallell'd Grievances, now presented to Your Excellencies. And howsoever Your Excel∣lencies doe determine, I shall most humbly submit and endeavour to approve my self duti∣fully to Your High and most Honourable Excellencies, as being Your most faithfull and obe∣dient Servant outragiously afflicted with excessive Wrongs and Abuses; for which I can obtain no Right or Justice at the Law, though have spent much of my Substance in the Attempt and long Endeavour.
