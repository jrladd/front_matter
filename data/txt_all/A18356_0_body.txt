Right Honourable,
THese fruits of mine, receiuing warm'th from the good affections of some friends, haue bud∣ded forth and blossom'd too early, to
withstand either the Nips or Blasts of this criticall Age, vnlesse your Lordship shall vouchsafe to be so ho∣spitable, as to admit them within your Walls, and make them secure vn∣der the Shadow of your protection. For, to whom should they flye for Patronage, but to our Honourable Chancellor, vnder whose Branches they both tooke Roote and grew vp; it being the Ordinance of Nature, that the same Hand which creates, should conserue; and that the benigne In∣fluence which reignes at the Birth, should bee propitious also in continu∣ing Life. Adde to these, the contents of the Worke, which consisting of di∣uers pieces, as excitements to pie∣tie, maintenance of royall and subordinate Authoritie, and a vindicating of our Naioth's or
Nurseries of Pietie and Know∣ledge, from the detractions of the Ignorant, may by vertue of your se∣uerall Relations, to God, the State, and Our Vniuersitie, challenge a greater share in your Lordship, then any other. Nor can I suspect (were these inducements wanting) your Noble interpretation of my boldnesse, considering that your Honor, whose studie is to expresse the vertues of ancient times in Life, hath for your zeale to Learning, noble Patternes in holy Writ, both to imitate and paral∣lell. For what was Daniel,Dan. 2.28. but Coun∣sellor to a great Monarch, and Go∣uernour ouer the Schooles of the wise∣men in Babylon?1. King. 18.3. And what Oba∣diah, other then Ruler in a Kings House, and Patron of the Prophets, the Ʋniuersitie men of Israel? I, for
mine owne part, since you succeede them in their Titles and Merits, shall euer pray, that you may partake with them in the Reward, that so, the Diuine protection of the One may attend you in this Life, and the blessed memorie of the O∣ther Crowne you hereafter.
