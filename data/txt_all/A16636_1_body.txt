WOrthy of all the titles of ho∣nor, yt nature, vertue, wise∣dome and worth, may be∣stow on their worthyest, & most fauoured possessors: hauing lately extracted the memory of Octauia out of the ashes of ob∣liuion: my thoughts continuing (perhaps longer then was fitte) the current of that streame, haue made some idle houres con∣uert themselues into the missiue Epistles betweene the vertuous Octauia and the li∣centious Antony, wherein although my slender skill, hath no way bin answerable to the height of your noble conceipt, that the sight of them mought breed you the least content: yet since they are done (pre∣suming vpon your accustomed Clemency) I humbly submit them to your fauourable censure. If you therefore who are the mo∣ther,

or (vnder your correction, to say bet∣ter, the murtherer) if concealing may bee called a murther,) of such excellent, & ver∣tuous knowledges and perfections, as are able to register a vulgar minde in the fa∣mous roules of neuer-ending eternity, will alow the meane and humble conceiptes of others: your honor shalbe aduanced to the highest pitch of their possibility. If you will esteeme the small portion of iudgement in other men, the excellency whereof you will not acknowledge in your selfe: theyr industry shall neuer cease, to wing your fame, till it haue towred beyond the reach of death, and obliuion. Accept therefore I beseech you the memorials of this vertu∣ous Empresse: that your worthines may in∣deare these worthlesse lynes; these lynes record her memory, her memory aduance your glory; your glory purchase all wished felicitie, and your high felicities, euer en∣crease till time giue place vnto eternity.
