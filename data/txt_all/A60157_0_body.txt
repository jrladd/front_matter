WHen God hath taken any
of our holy Relations from
us, who were ready for the Hea∣venly

Mansions, made meet for the
Rest, Peace and Joy of the up∣per,
better World, we should re∣joice
in the Grace of God towards
them; with Thankfulness owning
our Mercy, that they lived so long
to glorifie God here, and be useful
to us and others. It would be
very unreasonable to lament their
Departure, out of any Pretence of
our Affection to them; and no less
unkind to wish that for our sakes
they should not have died, or
should return from Paradise to our
sinful, troublesome World. But
we know they shall not come to
us; the only way therefore to meet
them with Comfort, is to remem∣ber
their Instructions, follow their
Counsels, and imitate their Faith
and Holiness, their Integrity and

Self-denial, and resolved, per∣severing
Obedience to God.
The Prayers and Pattern of
such an Husband, and of such a
Father as yours, is a Blessing for
which God expects your Praises.
Tho' in the former Relation it was
enjoyed but a little while; long
enough however to make you, Ma∣dam,
bless God for him, and un∣feignedly
to value and honour his
Memory while you live. May his
Grace supply, and help you to im∣prove
this Breach.
To you his Children I most
earnestly recommend the following
Papers: God and Man will expect
your profiting by them more than
others. You know how much you

were upon his Heart: You know
his Example and manner of Life,
and how you ought to walk and
please God: You have seen the
Beauty of Practical Godliness ex∣emplified;
you know how fervent∣ly
he was wont to wrestle with
God in Prayer for you: You know
with what daily Pains and Care,
Wisdom, Faithfulness, and Love
he endeavoured your Salvation;
rejoicing in any good Success there∣of,
but hardly able to support un∣der
the Burden of the contrary
Fears, as to Any of those whom
God had given him. O dread to
think that either of You, or any
of Yours, should meet him at the
Day of Judgment, and be rejec∣ted
of Christ, among the Workers
of Iniquity, when both your Pa∣rents

shall be own'd, honour'd, and
rewarded among the Faithful. An
ordinary Hell will not be Punish∣ment
enough for the Children of
such Parents, if you miscarry and
fall short of Heaven!
But if you seek after God with
your whole Heart▪ desiring to please
and serve him, who was the God
of your Fathers, for many Genera∣tions;
if you are humble and pray∣erful,
and prize the Blessing of
the Covenant, keep within the
Bond of it, and mind the Duty
of it; your Way is prepared, your
Acceptance is assured, there is a
Prospect of more Grace and Con∣solation
for you and yours, as a double Blessing promised to the
Childrens Children of such as fear

the Lord. That you may experi∣ence
this, and in order to it, re∣solve,
that your Father's God
shall be your God for ever and
ever, is the hearty Prayer of
