My Lord,
THat so many poor Infants after so hard a labour, may receive a Benediction now at the close, specially this last, which (though he comes in the Rear) I esteem mine own more then any of the rest, I make my humble addresse to your Lordshipp; For having called my Thoughts often to Counsell who should give this Blessing, they all con∣cluded ther was none so fitt to do it as your Lordshipp: And indeed ther were many resons for it; First, the Character I have heard applied unto you, which was given of one of the Holiest Fathers of the Church, That you were Coelestis Homo, & Terrestris Angelus, A Heaven∣ly Man, and Terrestriall Angell, being Pious in so intense a Degree; which Exemplary Piety goes attended with a becoming Reverentiall gravity, with such a meekness of spirit, and so many high Morall Vertues, together with a rare Equanimity in possessing your soul with so much patience and courage, by making your crosses stoop unto you after so long a time of pressure. Lastly, your most Exquisite Learning, and Vniversality of Knowledge, attended with such a soundnesse of Iudgement, and clearnesse of Vnderstanding; The pleasing Contemplation, and experimentall Knowledge of all these Particulars, induced me to this just Application of desiing your Blessing accordingly.
Touching the Ingredients of this last Peece, they cannot yet be called Proverbs, for as Rome was not built in a day, so a Pro∣verb is not suddenly made, but it requires a long Tract of Time, and vulgarity of usage before it becomes a Proverb, it is the Common-people alone that have priviledge of making Proverbs.
To conclude, I thought it not amisse to apprehend this Oportunity, to make the world know the high Reverence I bear to your Lord∣ship, and the sense I have of sundry Noble Civilities I received from time to time; as also of the favourable Opinion you please to have of divers Things of mine; which makes me in a due Reverenciall posture, thus to crave your Benediction, and to professe my self upon this publick Record,
Calendis Maij, 1659.
My Lord,
