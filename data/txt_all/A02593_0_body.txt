I Haue presum'd to Dedicate this Booke
To you; on which if you'l vouchsafe to looke,
And if you please kindly to accept it,
And from all slanderous tongues to protect it;
Then at your feet I prostrate my Burden,
If you accept it I haue my guerdon:
In loues vnlimited and lawles Band,
I vnto you so farre obliged stand,
That if I should the Age of Nestor liue,Tres cen∣tos fertur vixisse amos.
I satisfaction to you should not giue,
For vndeserued kindnesses receiuing,
Which makes me thankful whilst I'ue life & brea∣thing:
For trusty friends are scarce to be gotten,
Hard to be kept, but nere to be forgotten:
Amities chiefe breach is Ingratitude;
But vnto that I'le not be seruitude;
And in requitall of the loue I owe,
My weake Inuention on you Ile bestow:
Some litterate Pamphlet better you befits;
Then the Inuention of my shallow wits.
Yet kind Sir read them, although rude they be,
Iudge with iudicious eyes and you shall see
My vntun'd verse; but yet my Muse is free,
And so vnto the end she meanes to be:
I'le not insinuate, flatter, lie nor faine,
My wit in Paper ca'nt your worth explaine;
Still striue with vertue for to be superiour,
Deiect and throw downe vice as your Inferiour:
Goe on in Vertue as you haue begun;
That godly Race vnto the end out-run,
Then shall you be belou'd of all good Men;
Here stayes my Muse, and here shall rest my Pen.
