Right Honourable,
IT may seem very strange that this Sermon after two years lurk∣ing, and above, should now in this simple, and poor dress be∣gine to show it self, to your judicious eyes, and censure, like a thing born out of due time, I hope the meanness of its strain, not being adorned with the fair floorishes of humane eloquence, doth sufficiently proclaime to all ingenuous spirits, that neither pride, nor vanity hath brought it to this publick view: But to satisfie your Ho∣nours and all Men of Candor, be pleased to take notice of the true reason of this my present attempt, which indeed is to obstruct and (if possible) to overturn some Mens misrepresentations of me in the poynt of fidelitie, and loyaltie to his Majesty, and that to Men of eminencie and great trust both in Church and State. I shall accuse no Man, I pray that the Lord may forgive them, and I do heartily, and freely forgive them also: Only as the sad imputation of disloyal∣tie to his Sacred Majestie, is a most grievous burthen, to an honest Man, espe∣cially of my coat, who has been even in the worst of times indeavouring loyalty so for as he might, with the hazard of life, and what else is most pretious; so I think its lawful for me, yea altogether necessary (and therein I wrong no Man) to Apologize for my self, and no other defence shall I use for my own vindication, then this following Sermon, wherein (how mean soever) your Honours, and every Man else, who will be pleased to peruse it, may see what is my manner of Doctrine in reference to that obedience, and submission, which every good Subject ows to his Soveraigne, the Kings sacred Majesty, and to this present Government, as it is now established. It may be presumed, that a loyal Man in the Pulpit, will not be disloyal out of it: and houever a sound Judgment, and a right Practice
 are not alwaeis inseparable, according to that old Saying, Video meliora, pro∣boque, deteriora sequor, yet I hope Christian charity will pleade at your Ho∣nours hands, and every one else that shall see this Paper, to think the best of me, until you have sufficiently informed your selves of me, and when that shall once be, I trust that your good opinion of me will be confirmed. I know that this Pa∣per shall meet with no better entertainment then others of a more elaborate, and Judicious composure have done before, but let prejudice, malice, and ob∣liquie speak what they can, I hope there is nothing contained here, but sound Truths consistent with Scripture and the judgment of Orthodox Divines, both ancient and moderne, which truly I have set down very faithfully, as I found them scattered here and there in their Writings. Let it not offend your Honours, that I have sheltered this worthless piece under your Names; to whom should I flie for Patrocinie, if not to my Patrons? The experience of your Honours kindness hath imboldned me to cast my self upon you, and to expect a favourable acceptation of the first fruits of my weak labours, which in reason you may chal∣lenge as yours, and (so far as equity will perswade) to countenance me in the discharge of my Ministrie here. I am affraid (if I should inlarge) to meet with that of the Cynick, Close your gates, lest your City run out, and therefore I shall winde up all with this, that the Lord would powre out upon eve∣ry one of you, the Spirit of your callings, that as at home, so here, by your God∣ly, and unanimous Counsels Piety may be advanced, and Trade may flourish, which shall be for a Name that will not be forgotten, So prays
