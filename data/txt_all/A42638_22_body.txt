SOme may think it strange that this Counsel and Ad∣vise concerning Building, should also be presented to your Lordship, who mindes at this present, the Populating of such a part on the American Coast, where Houses are buil∣ded in two hours time, because they have no second story, lesse third or fourth; the Inhabitants



whereof affecting no other li∣very then that of the first naked; and who conceive that leaves of Trees do thatch their Domiciliums with lesse danger to their naked parts, then if covered with Dutch Pan, or English-hard-burnt Tiles.
But, My Lord, I confesse (though I am seventy two years of Age) that if the Cha∣ribden could give me an Ad∣vise of life, certain as the Newes, they told me (four and a half degrees by North, the Equinoctial) of the Kings re∣turn, when at that time, yet at Breda) and that I should live as many years as quarters of the Charibden his Tooes and Fin∣gers, which is all he can ac∣count by, I should think my little Counsel and Advise con∣cerning



Building, might yet be put in practise in those parts, where there is most rare Mar∣ble, and precious Stones, where Magazins, and Store-Houses, might be built to better use, then Casickes made of Ameri∣can Bambouses, whereof I can∣not forbear to speak to a per∣son of so much Honour, Know∣ledge, and Experience, as your Lordship is, who hath heard much of El Dorado, and if Men had minds as pleasing to God, as that they by his blessing were led to that place (which is effectively in rerum natura) the Great Cathedralls of St. Paul, and St. Peter, in this Metropo∣litan City might be lined as Richly as the Temple of Solo∣mon was. And, My Lord, be∣cause things which Men do be∣lieve to be true, makes them



more confident to speak them; I think that the Discourse is nei∣ther unseasonable, nor the Counsel and Advise concern∣ing the best manner of Building, unpleasing unto your Lordship: It being Written by him, who professeth to be.
