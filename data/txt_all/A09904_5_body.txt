VVOrthie Sir (to tell you true)
Faine I would, but know not yet,
Whether your place were made for you,
Or whether you were made for it?
If Feare, to take the double Fee;
If giuing Suitors expedition;
And to respect Conueniencie,
Aboue Reward in each Petition,
May make a Master of Request,
Though thou be last, th'art not the least.
