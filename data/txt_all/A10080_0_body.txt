Beloued in Christ
Jesus:
IT is the promise of the Word, that the
righteous shall be in euerlasting remembrance,Psal. 112.6. as registred in the booke of
eternall life, so graciously mentioned to the ioy of posterity in this life.Chrisost: The best
monument is not in stately houses, strong walls, high Towers, glorious Sepulchers,Antomin: 1. P. Tit. 2. C. 9. S. 2. but in righteous actions, grounded vpon
memory, which considering the infirmity of nature, losse by sinne, examples of the good, folly of the wicked, necessity of the miserable, and looking vpon God, as a Creatour, Redeemer, Rewarder, maketh a man liue according to his will reuealed in his Word;Mic. 6.8. in doing iustly, louing
mercy, and walk∣ing humbly. The memoriall of such a one I
present to you (and to those whosoeuer shall reade this passage from birth to death) in Sir
William Byrde deceased and gone to the Lord, whom I know
you esteemed Inter raros & paucos ex∣cellentissimae gratiae viros, Amongst those few choise pearles of excellent parts,Aug. de Cyp. li. 6. de Baptismo left in these de∣caying times. Vnperfect it is, and this birth had died as soone as it had beene borne (without pressing) had not I perceiued how tender it was taken among some, and earnestly desired to be published by others. We shall learne to liue well by remembring our
death, and wee shall liue to God if we dye to the world. As long as I am in this Tabernacle I shall put you in remembrance of this,2. Peter 1.13. that you may loue the
Lord your God, walke in his wayes, keepe his commaundements, statutes, iudgments, & liue, & multiply, & that the Lord our God may blesse you: and we may be preserued and deliuered at the houre of death and day of iudgement.
