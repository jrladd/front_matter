My Lord,
THe Congregations of Eccles and Jedburgh for their constant Affection and Loyalty to the King, have been very eminent in their suffering, (as is well known to most that knows them) and both of them, through the happy return of the Kings Sacred Ma∣jesty, being fred from the fear of all such barbarous violence and cruelty in time coming, and having deep impressions on their spirits of the superlative
advantage, that doth redound to all the Kings Do∣minions thereby, did go about the duty of Publike Thanksgiving with much chearfulnesse of heart. Having; as Pastor to the one, and upon invitation (through the seeknesse of their Minister) to the other, delivered a word of Congratulation, in the dayes set apart for that Work: This most won∣derful and unexpected Revolution, restoring His Majesty so peaceably to the Thrones of His Roy∣all Ancestors, after such earth-shaking intervals of time, after both His unparalelled and all good Subjects their long continued sufferings, being a matter of such profitable and universal influence, and so signal a token of Gods special mercy, as to these three Kingdoms in general; so to each Shire, City, Brugh, Incorporation, Paroch, Village, Fa∣mily, Person (whither of high or low degree) in particular, and that not only in this present, but in all subsequent and succeeding generations; I found my self bound in conscience, according to the small measure of gifts dispensed unto e, to lay before them that which I thought both con∣cerned them as good Christians and Loyal Subjects, which now the importunity of several of them constraineth me to make publike, and expose to the censure of these critical times.
My Noble Lord, as your Lordship knoweth me to be none of the most presumptuous, so am I sufficiently convinced of my own weaknesse, and thereupon very sensible how much need I have to
take Sanctuary under the umbradge of some Noble Patron; and hence it is from a long series of experiences, which I have had of your Lord∣ships respects in the blackest and most dismall of times (as all others likewise who were in a suf∣fering condition for their duty to God, and loyalty to their King) I am encouraged (since Epistling is come in custome) in all humility, to offer unto your Lordship those insuing Sermons: that coming abroad under the conduct of so Great and Honou∣rable a Name, they may find the better acceptance amongst all candid and loyall persons: which as your Lordships many favours and reiterated obligations, may justly challenge from my hands as a debt, so also do I tender with all dutiful and humble respect. Your Lordship hath the testimony of a constant friend to your Mother-Church, in the day of her trouble and affliction: and indeed, had you not stood in the way to mens designs, the Church of God in our bounds had been drowned in a Sea of Confusion, and Speat of Cruelty, and this is a great badge of Honor, far beyond that of Nobility of Blood, and all the short lived Trophees of time. Although this storm be over, it is the expectation of all good men, that your Lordships care and tender affection shall notwith∣standing continue, which will encourage them to be earnest supplicants to God for long lasting and continual prosperity to your House: the powring down of the riches of His blessing on your Self,
Honourable Lady, and all the Hopefull and Noble Stems of your Ancient Family: that you and they may be still crowned with bayes of Honour here, and eternity of Happinesse here∣after, which shall ever be the fervent prayer of
My Lord 
Edinburgh, Jan. 26. 1661.
