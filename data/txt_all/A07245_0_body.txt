IT may bee obiected, my not inscri∣bing
their names, or tittles, to
whom I dedicate this Poem, procee∣deth
either from my diffidence of
their affection to me, or their vnwillingnes to be
publishde the Patrons of a trifle. To such as shall
make so strict an inquisition of mee, I truely an∣swere.
The Play in the presentment found
such a generall approbation, that it gaue mee as∣surance
of their fauour to whose protection it is
now sacred, and they haue profes'd they so
sincerely allow of it, and the maker, that they
would haue freely granted that in the publicati∣on,
which for some reasons. I denide my selfe
one, and that is a maine one: I had rather inioy
(as I haue donne) the reall proofes of their
friendship, then mountebancke like boast their

numbers in a Catalogue. Accept it noble gen∣tlemen
as a confirmation of his seruice who
hath othing else to assure you, and witnes to
the world how much he stands ingagd for your
soe frequent bounties, and in your charitable
opinion of me beleeue, that you now may, and
shall euer command,
