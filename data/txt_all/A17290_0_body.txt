WHiles I was stu∣dying (right worshipful) how I should by some meanes expresse some part of my thankfulnesse for your late fauour and bountiful∣nes, J was importun'd, by such as might command me, to make this Sermon com∣mon

to all, which J am in∣formed hath beene comfor∣table to some. J thought it my duty to offer the dedica∣tion herof to your Wor: who well know, that a willing mind is to be accepted ac∣cording to that a man hath, not according to that a man hath not. 2 Cor. 8. vers. 12.
And thus praying for the happines of you and yours in al hūblenes I take my leaue.
