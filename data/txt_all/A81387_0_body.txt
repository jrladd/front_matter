SIR,
AMong the Multitude of Practical Divine Treatises are none more numerous than on the Lords Supper, nor more di∣versly handled: Not a few well-disposed persons yet com∣plain they are at a loss,
not so much which to make use of, variety here distracting; as that they know not how to form Directions into apposite Meditations: they sequester, they sit, they seem to reflect as others, but know not what to say in themselves, to their great discomfort and discou∣ragement. The ensuing Ma∣nual is so methodically digested for their assistance, and pre∣sented to your self, not as one that needs it, but the Composer a better evidence of his great esteem of a person so constant, so devout a Communicant; so eminently Charitable, so rarely Tempered, so truly Honourable.
If it displease any, I borrow of so many to discharge one great debt; methinks my Ho∣nesty in owing it may satisfie; their allowing me also to make the best use of theirs I were able. And if this be a bad one 'tis a right hand er∣ror; I hope they'l not con∣demn, but pity and pardon me I was no better advis'd; my ambition being not to appear in publik, but to be publickly useful, and to let the World know how much I am,
