My Lord,
I Am induced to lay these Papers at your Lord∣ship's
Feet, both from the Relation I bear to
your Lordship, which does exact all my La∣bours
as a Tribute and Acknowledgment of
my Duty and Obligation, as also from the Know∣ledge
of the great Affection and Zeal You have al∣ways
continued to shew for the True Religion; as∣suring
my self that whatsoever shall be offered in De∣fence
of that, especially against the now growing He∣resie
of the Times, will find no small Acceptance in
your Lordship's Favour.
It is sufficiently known, my Lord, what a signal
Example of True Christian Piety and Courage, against
the Anti-trinitarian Heterodoxes, was shewn by the ex∣cellent

Sir Ralph WinwoodSr Ralph Winwood's Remon∣strance and Pro∣testation to the States a∣gainst Vor∣stius's Ele∣ction, in Wilson's Life of K. James., your Lordship's Grandfa∣ther,
when he was Embassadour in Holland for King
James I. in so strenuously opposing Vorstius the Socini∣an's
Accession to the Professorship of Leyden; whose
Advice, if the States had then been so prudent as to
have taken, the Socinian Heresies had not made the
Progress in the World as now they have, from the
Lectures of him and his Successours in that Chair.
And therefore, my Lord, I am encouraged to think
that your Lordship, who does possess all the Noble
Endowments of that great and good Statesman, your
Ancestor, will favourably look upon that which is de∣signed
against those Heretical Tenets, the Seeds of
which have been mostly sown in this Nation by the
Books of Vorstius and his Successours, though often
under Colour of Opinions of a more specious Name.
May it therefore please your Lordship to accept
these my poor Endeavours in Defence of the True
Faith, which I have here presumed to entitle to your
Lordship's Protection; and be pleased to look on
them as a small Token of the Duty and Service which
shall be always owing to your Lordship, from,
My Lord,
