SIR,
IT was not by my endeavor, but permittance only, that these tri∣fles were preferred to the Press; nor had the perswasions used procured so much from me, but that upon strict Examination, I conceived them to be good for nothing, but to be printed. For since the late Deluge of Ignorance over∣flowed this Land, it fares with Books, as
 with Men; the light and frothy float and flourish, whilst the Grave and Solid sink and perish. Having thus abandoned them to the ignominy of an Impression, 'twould be ab¦surd to beg from you a candid opinion of them, which hath been already denyed them by my self. And therefore I ask no pardon for the Errors of the Contents, but for the boldness I take to present you therewith, and to subscribe my self
(Sir)
