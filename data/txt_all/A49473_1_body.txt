Right worshipfull and worthy Commanders:
THIS Tract of warre cannot (I hope) be unwel∣come to your Hands, whose Bodies are daily imployed in Martiall affaires. Nor let it seeme strange that one of my Pro∣fession should produce a sub∣ject of this Nature; seeing there are seldome any Lea∣guers without men of our Quality: The Ministring Levites were not onely in the Campes of Israell, but

also had their speciall Offices and Charges allotted to them. Such grace the Helmet, ani∣mate the Soldier, and fit him at all goings Out for his hap∣pier dissolution.
When I was abroad with our Armies (I speake it to their honor) I found large maintenance, and faire re∣spect, though with a great deale of hazard both of for∣tune and life, in regard of the Enemies too great forces, and our long and hasty Mar∣chings, together with tedious Beleaguerings: yet (by the

all-ruling Providence of God) I came off enriched with some knowledge, and Military experience; which I account a rich prize, though purchas'd at an high price.
I will not relate unto you the fearefull and horrid issues and effects of warre; such as are poverty and de∣cay of Trading, famine, violence, depredation, de∣struction of Justice and Civility, slighting of Ma∣gistracy, firing and plun∣dering of Countries, death of famous Commanders,

been of excellency and use∣fulnesse) yet in these latter of small or no consequence. As also a short and compen∣dious Discourse of the excel∣lency of the Musquet and Halfe-Pike above other wea∣pons, practis'd now with Ease and Activity by many ingenuous and Martiall spi∣rits; and in times of needfull triall would be as full of Advantage.
VVhat I have here with paines and experience thus composed and digested, I pre∣sent to your Loyall hands,

whose Iudgments (I know) can well determine of Mili∣tary affaires, being so con∣stantly imployed in that No∣ble and Heroick profession of Armes.
Not doubting, but that you who so love the practice, will also favour and incou∣rage such who shall to their utmost advance and main∣taine that noble and valo∣rous Calling.
So praying for the in∣crease of your Fames, as well as of your Numbers, I commend you all, and all

your weighty occasions to the protection of the Lord of all Victory: being
