Muh endeared Ss.
AS this Sermon was preached at the desire, and in the Course of the first of you: and is now penned and presented to your reading, and perusal, at the desire of the se∣cond of you, who was an Auditor, amongst divers other persons of Learning, and Qua∣lity: that I may satisfie some judicious friends, and gratifie your selves: I now pre∣sent it unto your kind Acceptance, and Ap∣probation. The Subject is Eternity, which is the end we should all look at, it is panis quotidianus, a Doctrine for every day, in season all the Year long, never out of season:
 be pleased to accept this poor Service of mine, as a token of that thank-fulness I owe unto you, for your continued Favour towards me: if my poor Endeavours may be useful to the Church and People of God, I have my end. Deo Gloria, mihi venia. I hope you will pardon my Defects in the manner of handling so weighty a Subject, and that you will remember what you read 1 Kings 5.15. that at the building of Solomons Temple, there was room as well for Burden-bearers, as for other more curious Artificers: and Exod. 25.4, 5. at the first making of the Tabernacle, not only the Bringers of Blew-silk, and Purple, and Scarlt: but even the poorest sort, which brought Goats-Hair, and Rams-Skins, were accepted. Thus pray∣ing that we all may so pass through things Temporal, that we finally lose not the things Eternal. I commit you to Gods gratious pro∣tection, and rest,
