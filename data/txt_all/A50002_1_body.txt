Right Honourable,
IF Presents ought to be worthy of those to whom we present them; I must ingeniously confess, that it is in vain for me to offer your Lordship any thing, being deprived of that eminent capacity; and indeed persons of qua∣lity and eminency as your Honour is, must not expect such presents from their inferi∣ours; yet (Noble Sir) I hope you will receive that which I present here to your Lordship: I confess, it is something presumptuous in me to make use of your Name to ennoble my Sermon unto others, but I am perswaded that
the most excellent courtesie which shineth in your most noble Person, will excuse a stranger, nay, will suffer me to present you with a hea∣venly silence, where you may see the fatal Eclipse of the Church of God, under the bloody persecutions of its enemies, with her happiness and prosperity at the cessation of her afflictions, but specially the great mystery of our redemption, that procures unto angels and men a profound silence of admiration; for I am not ignorant that your Lordship takes a singular pleasure at such celestial me∣ditations, your most vertuous person being perswaded, that not onely the poor but the rich also are redeemed by the precious blood of Je∣sus Christ, and obliged to give silence to all the sinfull motions of our corrupted na∣ture; and indeed your great charity towards the poor members of our blessed Saviour, and singular affection to the Clergy, is a sufficient token of that verity, nay, an example to draw others to the imitation of the noble daughter
of heaven, vertue, and force the most profane to abandon vice, that monstrous child of hell; I could say much more of the singular vertues which nature and grace have adorned your Lordship with; nay, of your singular affe∣ction to the great Monarch of England, and the Church, but that would prove needless, it being so manifest to all; that therefore which I shall say for the present, if you will grant me that liberty, is, that I am,
My Lord,
