My LORD,
THAT I presume to lay a Book be∣fore Your Lordship, which bears so mean a Name as mine in the Title-Page, might want a better Apology than I could make, were there not likewise the Illustrious Name of that justly esteem'd and most Famous Author, the Honourable Mr. Boyle before it.
For were the following Sheets, entirely the Products of my weak Endeavors only; I should think it no small Piece of Vanity to hope for Your Lordship's Notice, and much more to expect your Patronage: But,



since the Honourable Author's Works have sufficiently recommended themselves to the Learned World; and more especi∣ally to those that are most Eminent for Learning themselves; He cannot but al∣ready, amongst Those, have deserved Your good Esteem; and therefore, should I endeavour an Encomium of so Great a Man, by way of Apology for my present Presumption, I should but let Your Lord∣ship see, that all I can say of so Eminent a Person, would come far short of the Esteem You have for him already: Not that I can pretend to know Your Lordship's Senti∣ments in any Particular, any further, than I may presume to guess, by the Notion I have of Your Lordship's Esteem for Learn∣ing and Learned Men.
But tho' the Name of Mr. Boyle may be sufficient to recommend the Honourable Author's Works to Your Lordship, and the rest of the Learned World; yet if Your Lordship will be pleased to condescend to Patronize Your most Humble and Obedi∣ent
Servant, who hath the good Fortune to Conduct them into the World, and to extract those purer Streams of Know∣ledg, which are separated from the less discerning Part of Mankind, by polite Apologies and Florid Complimental Digres∣sions, It will be the greater Happiness, that I have the Honour to be Just to the Author and Serviceable to the World; But much more, that I have at the same time, so Fa∣vourable an Opportunity of expressing my Gratitude for the Favours which Your Lord∣ship hath already been pleased to bestow on me: Favours, which are much more valuable, because Your Lordship's; and which carry with them a double Obligation of Grati∣tude; the One to Your Lordship and the Other to my good Friend and Worthy Pa∣tron Dr. Robert Angell, to whom I am infi∣nitely Obliged for Your Lordship's Favour, and for being first made known to Your Lordship.
But it will not be the only Happiness to me, that Your Lordship is pleased to Pa∣tronize
my present Undertaking; but it may in a great Measure Contribute to their Candid Acceptance by the World, who will put a higher Value upon them, for Your Lordship's Favourable Approba∣tion.
Indeed, were it Generally receiv'd and agreed on, what some People hold, viz. That Philosophy is prejudicial to Religion; I should have more Reason to beg Your Lordship's Pardon, than Your Patronage; since it must be in Vain to hope, that One, who promotes the Latter, by Instructive Doctrin; and what is more, an Exam∣plary Life, to be imitated, but not paral∣lell'd; should encourage any thing, that may be of Disservice to that: But I need not tell Your Lordship, that the Honoura∣ble Author hath made it appear, That we may search into Efficient Causes, without denying the. All-Wise Author of Created Beings, his just Attributes: For, whoever diligently searches into Efficient Causes, can∣not but discern the Necessity of an Omni∣potent
Creator, who first establish'd the Laws of Nature, and gave them their due Limits; and our Author having made it evident, that Efficients themselves, direct us to Final Causes; and confequently rather dispose and incline a Man, than hinder him from being a Good Christian; your Lord∣ship needs no other Inducements to pro∣mote it.
And indeed, were I not satisfy'd, that Philosophy, if rightly made use of, by the Effects it hath upon my Self, did not en∣able Me the more to discern the Shortness of the Utmost Attainments of Finite Ca∣pacities, and to adore what I cannot com∣prehend; I should be so far from desiring Your Lordship's Patronage, that I should be ready to oppose it my self, to the utmost of my Weak Endeavours: And were it not too soon to make Your Lordship Promises, before I have qualify'd my Self to write any thing of my own, worth Your Lord∣ship's Notice, I should not be backwards to say, That I may in a few Years, shew
that it will afford us no small Light in ex∣plaining the Mosaick Creation, in directing us to frame some faint Ideas of the Methods by which the Omnipotent Fiat brought the World to what it now is, and to prove the Works of the Omnipotent Creator, as Historically deliver'd by Moses, consonant with Philosophy.
But I am afraid, that, endeavouring to make an Apology for this Dedication, I ought to make another, for having been too tedious already; since Your Lordship's own Judgment, will satisfie You of the Usefulness of Philosophy, and since that Consideration is enough to induce You to encourage it.
Yet I cannot perswade My self, so soon to pass by this Opportunity of expressing my Gratitude to Your Lordship: nor can I forbear reflecting on my own Happiness, under Your Lordship's Patronage: For as no one better understands, how to encou∣rage the Endeavours of those, that make Im∣provements
in Knowledge their Aim, than those that are most intimately acquainted with it, and than Your Lordship; So it is an equal Happiness to be under the Prote∣ction and Favourable Eye, of a Patron so desirable: Neither is it any Vain Opinion I have of my own Merit, that makes me think my self Happy under such a Patron, but rather the Sense of my own Weakness; for could I perswade my self that I deserv'd Your Lordship's Favour, or the Favour of some Others, both eminent and Learned, to whom I am oblig'd: I must be very vain indeed.
But notwithstanding the Sense I have of my own Weakness, Your Lordship's Favour will encourage me to improve the small Talent I have, since in the Search of Truth,
Est aliquid prodire tenus, si non datur ultra.

But My LORD, the World, who are wont to find in Dedications, the Characters of their Patrons, may wonder that I have declin'd the Usual Method, since any one that knows Your Lordship cannot want Ma∣terials for a Character, that might be of Use to the World, in setting them a Good Pat∣tern to imitate: Yet since Your Lordship's Character would be drawn amiss by so mean a Pen as Mine; I would rather be thought out of the Common Road, than mistaken in it; since any Body that knows what Character belongs to a Truly Apostolical Bi∣shop, is not unacquainted with Your Lord∣ship's: Therefore since no Encomiums can add to that which can only be augmented by a Continuance of Your Life; the Fear of Mis-representing, is the Reason I decline it.
But not to take up too many of Your Lord∣ship's pretious Minutes, which are always Im∣ploy'd in doing Good, and promoting Chri∣stianity in it's Original Stream; that Your
Lordship may live long, for the Honour of the Church, and the Good of those that are under Your Care, is not only the Wishes of hose that think themselves happy under the nspection of Your Lordship; but more par∣ticularly of,
My LORD,
