TIs not cu∣stome but a right, that chal∣lenges the Dedication; They are
 Sermons, which were preached, in that Inte∣rim while I was yours, though at London, and to that people whom I still equally both love and honour, and who at that time owned my Preac ings, yet after your choyce had sepa∣rated mee from them to a remoter Countrey, and greater task, Their desire first cald it to the Presse; but 'tis a trod∣den Complement to pleade Importunity; nor doe I love it, but
 must freely confesse, That it is not onely by enforcement that I am abroad. Every one that vouchsafes to bestow his eye so meanely, may reade, and with welcome. Nor would I beg acceptance from Censure; let men ver∣dict as they please: It were Pride, and Selfe-seeking to crouch unto opinion. My intend∣ments are but to doe service to my great Master, and them that are his, The Humble; and
 therefore from him onely are my expecta∣tions. If God might have honour, and Gods people benefit, harshest Censure shold not discourage mee from publishing this, or more.
I affect not their Nicenesse, that will bee their owne Closets, and Cabinet up their owne labours. If wee have but one Talent, it must bee put un∣to the Banke; God en∣dures not the Napkin.
 Let God & the Church have our Studies, if we be conscionable, wee cannot lose by our sweat. The Subiect of this discourse cannot be unusefull, the frame is but rude, I intended not ornament; much or∣nament becomes not a Sermon: That Trum∣pet of the Gospell, the learned Paul, determins to know nothing a∣mong his Corinths, save Iesus Christ, and him cru∣cified. But what ere it is, I have made it you-s, as
 a testimony of those re∣spects I beare you, and how iustly I owe them, upon Bonds not few, nor ordinary. The Lord adde unto what he hath bestowed upon you, and make you answe∣rable to your wonted goodnesse; It is the prayer of

Bunbary. 1631.
