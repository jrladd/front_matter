RIGHT Wor∣shipfull,
your
zeale to Religi∣on,
and loue of
Learning; haue made mee
bold to present you with this
fatherles Orphane; which I
hope the rather you will pa∣tronage,
becaus it is the fruite
of a godly Parent (once with

your Worship familiar) who
liuing, taught the Word sin∣cerely;
and being dead, hath
lest some monument of his
workes, necessary to instruct
and edifie. This first is offred
to the worlds view, contain∣ing
all excellent comfort for
an afflicted Conscience.
If you voutchsafe to ac∣cept
it, I haue my desire, that
boldly made choyce of you
for your especiall desert. The
God of mercie and Father of
our Lorde Iesus lengthen
your dayes, and make your
end blessed.
