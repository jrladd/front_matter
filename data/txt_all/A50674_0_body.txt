Dear Friends,
HAving received a deep impres∣sion in my thoughts of that Christian-like Moral, Non no∣bis solum natisumus, sed partem Pa∣rentes, partem Amici, pariem Patria vendicant; I thereupon begun serious∣ly to excogitate how I might lay out that small Talent which the Lord hath lent me, to the profit and good of my Country: and taking notice of the Quotidian enmities, Contentions, and Quarrels, which arise amongst men about the Devises, Bequests and Legacies of their dead Friends, which most commonly happens by reason of the vitious penning of their Wills and Testaments, and is chiefly occasio∣ned through the scarceness of Wri∣ters on this Subject in our English Tongue; there being very few Books in the same Language save Mr. Swin∣bornes excellent Treatise Testamen∣tary,

which is now almost out of Print, and can hardly be gotten at a∣ny Stationers; and besides, the price thereof doth exceed many honest Countrymans purse; and so many men are left in mists of ignorance, by reason whereof their Wills and Te∣staments are often so strangely drawn, with so many dubious, knotty, and sometimes nonsensical Clauses and Sentences therein, as that often the Testators meaning can searcely, and sometimes not at all be found out; whereupon it happens that some∣times the Bequests and Devises are voyd, and so the Legataries loose that which was intended them: otherwhiles they are forced to sue for their Lega∣cies, whenas Doubts a rise upon the Te∣stators words and meaning in his Will, and then often the Remedy proves worse then the Disease, and more Charges spent in the Law for the re∣covery of the Legacy, then sometimes it is worth: Therefore, that my honest Countrymen may be partly informed

in some particulars how they may dispose of their Estates at their deaths, and that they may make their Wills according to Law, so that their inten∣tions and meanings may not be per∣verted and wrested to a wrong sence after their Deaths, and those who were intended and expected to reap benefit by the Testators death, rob∣bed of their just Rights and Dues; I have thereupon taken the pains to collect several Cases and Resolutions out of the Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Canon-Laws, and also out of the Cu∣stoms, Common-Laws, and Statutes of this Realm touching Wills and Testaments, their several sorts and forms, what shall be a good Will, who may make one, and who may be an Executor, and of the several ways of appointing them; and also touch∣ing Tutors, Childrens Portions, De∣vises, and Legacies; together with the Probat of Wills, passing Accounts, payment of Mortuaries; and of the power of the Ordinary in granting of

Administrations; and touching Ap∣peals, and several other things, where∣by my Countrymen at an easie charge and with little expence of time, may now take a view of those things which have so long been kept from their sight under the Vizard-Mask of an unknown Tongue, and they thereby deprived of the knowledge thereof. And now, Dear Countrymen, (for to you only do I speak) if I can have but your good-will, and good word for all this, it shall suffice
