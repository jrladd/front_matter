IT hath bin (Right Honorable) well de∣bated amongst the Learned, where Learning was first professed, and it is as truly recorded of many worthy Wri∣ters, who were the first that did teach for to Write, and surely as our forefathers did reue∣rence them as Gods, which spake wisedome; so we may extol them as men somewhat superior vnto men which inuented the arte to Write what they spake. The first benefitted the persons that heard them; by the latter are instructed al posterities that shall reade them: the one instructed those onely that were pre∣sent with them, the other gaue lessons vnto all nati∣ons whatsoeuer, though neuer so much distant from them. And therefore very well saith a certaint Poet, nowe liuing:

O blessed letters that combine in one,
All ages past, and make one liue with all:
By you we do confer with those are gone,
And the dead-liuing vnto Counsell call,
By you the vnborne shall haue communion,
Of what we feele, and what doth vs befall.

The consideration of which premises, together with the respect of this ouer-fruitfull age of the Chil∣dren
 of the Prophets, the Land hauing more Church men then Churches, and more Preachers then Par∣rishes to Preach in; hath moued me (though least of the Apostles yet vnwilling to hide my talent with the vnprofitable seruant) to write what I haue here∣tofore spoken, and to publish what I haue Written, which I prostrate as my free-will offring at the foote of the Aulter, as the poore Israelites did their Goats haire, when they had no better to bring, and as the Widdow did hir mite, when she had nothing greater to giue. And forasmuch as Curtesie is the true note of Gentilitie, and Learning is best fauoured of such as are best Learned, and matters of Religion of those that are Religious; I haue therefore made choyse of your Honor for Patron of these papers, not doubting, but that in regard of Gentilitie, you will curteously receiue it, in respect of your Learning, willingly per∣vse it, and for the matter and subiect of it, Patronize and protect it. Your Lordships fauourable entertain∣ment of this, shall encourage me in greater matters hereafter to imploy my Labors vnto the memoriall of your worthines: and mooue others to peruse it the more diligently, being entertained of a Perso∣nage of such Honour and Iudgement. Thus, wishing vnto your Lordship, the accomplishment of your wi∣shes, crauing pardon for my (perhappes) ouermuch boldnes, I humbly take my leaue, this first of Ianuary.
