My Lord,
THE favourable account that was brought your Lordship of this Ser∣mon (your self by an Indispositi∣on being kept from bearing it) as it indu∣ced you to desire to see it in Print, which seconded by the Order of the Court of Al∣dermen,

does now make it appear in pub∣lick; so it will give a new discovery of the little credit that is due to Report: which though it errs more generally on the severer side, yet in this Instance was too partial to so poor a Performance.
But the Argument treated in it will co∣ver many faults: Especially meeting with such Equitable Iudges as your Lordship is. Since the acquitting the Reformed Religion of such a scandal as has been cast on it up∣on the account of that great wickedness then commemorated, and the persuading all Pro∣testants to live in Peace and Love toge∣ther, are subjects so acceptable to your Lord∣ship, and so suitable to our present unhappy Circumstances, that the most imperfect Essay towards them will, I presume, be well re∣ceived, and the Defe is of it easily forgi∣ven, by one that employs himself with so much Zeal and Fidelity in the securing our

Holy Religion, and the maintaining of Truth and Peace in that Great City now under your Lordships Government.
May the God of Truth and Peace lead us into the way of his Truth, and make us know the things that belong to our peace; and may your Lordship be a great Instru∣ment in promoting it. This is earnestly prayed for by.
My Lord,
