SIR,
GOod Magistrates are Gods choicest Jewels, and can never be valued at to great a rate by good Citizens: Such persons ever set a Lustre upon that Government they dispense, and are an honour to the great Exemplars thereof, which they ever represent.
But, you (great Sir) as born to so worthy a purpose, (in your year of Power and Temptation,) have held the Scales of this great City even, and that in a disturbed time too; and when the multi∣tude were set a madding, and in a posture of acting things against Government, you kept them steddy, performing that by your wisdome, which men un∣kil'd in the Art of Ruling, could not do by force. To have at once shewn your self Loyal to your So∣veraign, and Loving to his Subjects. — And there∣fore it is, that the London Almanack courts the Pa∣tronage of you that have been Londons Lord Mayor, rendring you the humble and dutiful thanks  a faithful Citizen; whose Stars, I hov  ove of so benigne influence, as to procure your generous ac∣ceptance of this mean Trifle.
May your self, great Sir, and Honour'd Fami∣ly be ever happy, and may this Honourable City be ever blessed in the choise of so prudent and succesful a Governour. Is the hearty Prayer of
Honoured Sir, your most Humble Servant
