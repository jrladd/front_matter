SIR,
HAuing collected out of many learned Authors, sundry speciall notes and obserua∣tions, shewing what strang and cruell accidents, doe vsually or ve∣ry often, follow the bitings of madde dogges, and knowing that among vs sometimes (though not so frequently as in hotter countries) this mischeife hap∣pens to the great danger both of man &
beast: I am bould to present them (han∣dled and disposed as they be) to the ge∣nerall view, (I hope) for plicke good, and to your particular selfe in respect of your worth and neighbourhoode. Our language (for ought J know) hath ne∣uer yet said so much of this subiect. Therefore if any by this shall take oc∣casion to search further, or speake more for a greater generall good, J shalbe glad to be a whetstone to such an edge. Jn the meane time, seing this familiar animal, the Dog, is the seruant of poore men, the delight of great men, and a companion of most men: to preuent in∣conueniences that may fall, Pecori, pe∣coris{que} magistro, both to this kinde cattell, and their louing keepers, as also to prepare (if need require) a conue∣nient remedie for so disastrous a mishap,
J haue thought good, thus (as J can) to forewarne their negligence that thinke slightly of such a wound, and to re∣forme their ignorance, that may be (when time is) to seeke for needfull help, and make bould to direct these my simple labours, first and cheefely to your curteous acceptation, not as thankes for any benefites receiued, (for J am a stranger to you) nor as meanes to insi∣nuate for future fauours (though it now be my hap to be your poore welwishing neighbour) but both for the popular and well deserued speeches the whole country doth aforde you, and also for that J know your place and pleasure is, to keepe many Hounds for Hare and Deare, and Spaniels for land and wa∣ter. Accept therefore worthie SIR, this worthles) though perhaps not alto∣gether
fruitles) labour, as it is inten∣ded, a slender token of the good affecti∣on and respect J beare to the iust re∣port of your reputation. And so with my best wishes of health and happines to you, I rest.
