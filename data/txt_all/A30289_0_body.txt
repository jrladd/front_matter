IT is said, my Brethren, that whatever Affections be in the Middle, they have two sharp Ends.
Our first Love has been as Zealous, as our first Knowledge was Wondrous. I am persuaded also, that when we shall be Parted, it will be no less Ardent. And our separa∣tion will be, as that of our Limbs from each other would be. May it be our Care, that, whiles we are Kept together by good Provi∣dence, we admit no chill in that sweet and useful Grace; but shew it to be a godly Love, by having it like the Love of God, That is Ʋnchangeable.
I have nothing for you Great, but my Love. Next unto it, is my Labour: But, as my Talent is slender, that it self is shorter than my Desire. Without your very great Affection, I can expect little success of my Preaching or Writing. Thereby I am encouraged unto both, and in both, as yet. It is that which hath given the Imprimatur
 unto these Notes. For, tho' of the Truths of God in them, I study to think most honourably: yet, as to any thing that is mine in them, I praise God, I do think very despicably. And am prepared to hear it undisturbedly, if others shall think so too.
Neither do I purpose to put you off with these Fragments. But pay the whole that I am Debtor of by Promise unto you, if the Lord will, and I live. I must beg your Pa∣tience indeed for some time. Nor need I say for what Reasons; being all that know me, know them also.
You think, (as I do, tho' on a different reason,) my Days on Earth will be few. Be they more or less, the greatest part of them shall be spent in Pains and Prayers for your Persons and Families. While I am capable of either, You, more than any others, shall have them. Even Self-love bids you Pray for me: and I know you have other Motives. Therefore I Expect it, and not Intreat it.
