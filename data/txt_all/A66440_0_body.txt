Most Reverend Father in God,
WHen I consider, as I cannot but often do so, (for Ingratitude is an unpardona∣ble crime) the Largeness of your For∣mer Favours, amongst the rest of my Honourable Friends; and that Influence I receiv'd from you, when you shone so bright in a somewhat lower Orb than now you do: I cannot, but confess at least, my debts to you far greater, than ever I shall be ever able to pay.
Children can never make a sufficient return un∣to their Parents, though they should honour them with all they have, all that they can do or suffer: since without them they could never have been in a
capacity of Being, much less of Well Being. Im∣mortales gratiarum horti.
This makes me now so bold to present this small Handful of Tender, First Fruits unto your Grace, which I confess were against my Will Crop'd from me by a Friendly, Over-powerful hand.
And indeed, to whom should I devote the Pat∣tern of Ecclesiastick Ordination, but to the Grea∣test Apostle and Arch Angel of it in this our Church, next under Christ, Your Self?
It is no ceremonious but Fundamental point, the Ordination to and execution of the Ministerial Fun∣ction. And yet, I expect hard censures from the World on all sides: but Fear none that are uncharitable.
If any will but take the pains to teach me better, I shall be thankful.
However your Lordship and the World may guess by this, how I spend that Talent of Health and Time, &c. which God is pleased to Lend me.
I cast both it and my self at your Graces Feet; and think my self to have obtain'd enough, if it find acceptance with or Protection from, you
My Lord, Whose obedient Son and Servant, in the Blessed Jesus, I am,

July 5th. 1664.
