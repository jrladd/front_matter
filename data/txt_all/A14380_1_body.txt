REligions Rules and Natures Bonds bind All,
To keepe account and true memoriall
Of fauours past or present; lest with shame,
Ingratitude should Cracke their Credits fame.
Since then (Right worshipful) these Bonds All bind,
This Dutie needs to Mee must be assign'd;
Who, from your VVorships vndeseruedly
Haue found much fauour and great courtesie:
Whose sweete Effects haue my good so effected,
As Blacke Obliuion may not make neglected.
And since your VVorship worthily is made
The President, chiefe Pillar, Prop and Aide
Of Gouernment in that blest Hospitall
Of Christs poore members, Orphans poore and small;


I, therefore ioy, thus to Congratulate
Your Worships hap, their Helpe so fortunate.
As also that I may expresse, in part,
Some sincere Fruites of my most gratefull Heart:
By Dedication of this my poore Mite,
To your good Worship; due to you by right.
Which, hoping you (Right Worshipfull) will take
With kind acceptance: Heau'ns great King you make,
A blest Partaker, of that Maiestie,
Which my weake Pen can here but Typisie.
