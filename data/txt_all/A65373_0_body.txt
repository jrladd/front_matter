Madam,
BEfore that Pious and Eminent Person, The Dutches of Roâˆ£thes, Your Ladyships Renowned Mother, was by Death Removed, I designed, according to the Intention of my Husband (who is now entered into the joy of his Lord) to Dedicat this part of his Labours to her Grace. And now when these Papers, by advice of Faithful and Godly Ministers, are to be exposed to publick view, I judged it my duty to pay that Respect to Her Graces's Memory, as to prefix your Ladyships Name thereunto (which no doubt, if my Husband were alive, he himself would have done) which I the more confidently adventure upon, as that I know your Ladyship to be the Lively-portracture of the Graces and Vertues of your Noble, and now Glorified Mother, and to be of such Wisdom and Prudence, Humility and Self-Denyal, as to excuse any thing of unsuitableness, that may be in this, for one of my Station and Sex. But being unwilling to Allow your Ladyship any diversion from the perusal of the Book it self, I shal only pray, that the Lord may preserve your Ladyship, and carry your hopeful Sons through the hazard of Non-age, and as they are Heirs of two Noble Families, to make them shine as Stars of the first Magnitude, amongst the Peers of this Nation; and begs leave to Subscribe my self,
Madam,
