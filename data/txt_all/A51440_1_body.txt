Right Honourable,
IT is not the Excellency of the Work, which hath induced me, to present it to the Patronage of your Excel∣lency; But because there is a Con∣gregation, or rather a Combination of Men, who with Hermogenes in Tertullian, Maledicere singulis officium bonae Conscientiae judicant, think it the discharge of a good Conscience, to speak evill (yea and to doe evill) against all those who oppose them: The same dutifull respect, which begot the intention of having your Excellency my Auditor, begot also the desire of obtaining you my Protector; that as the Worke hath had the Grace of so generall an Ap∣probation, so the Author the Countenance of so Ho∣nourable a Patronage, and withall the Protection of so Worthy an Excellency. The prayses of whose greatest Worth, are best heard from the Voyce of this greatest County; into which (by the solicita∣tion

of the Loyall Nobility and Gentry, and by Commission from His Sacred Majesty) your Ex∣cellency hath advanced with your present Forces, to represse the fury of Rebellion; which, neither pittying the tendernesse of Infancy, nor the infir∣mity of old Age; neither regarding the Priviledge of Sex, nor the plea of Condition, hath offered in∣humane violence to all. And now (Right Honou∣rable) maugre the malicious attempts of the Re∣bellious (whatsoever is the issue of your noble En∣deavours) here shall Posterity finde it Recorded, That William Earle of Newcastle was Loyall to His Soveraigne, and faithfull to his Country; Quem non Ardor prava jubentium mente qua∣tit solidâ. Whose Memory shall be precious in the minds of all good Men, and Loyall Subjects. So that, should you Sacrifice your Selfe in affection to your King and Country; your Honourable Death shall be a means to procure you a Glorious Life, and an Eternity of Happinesse shall Crown your Fi∣delity to your Prince. In whose Honour and Safety, that you may be preserv'd safe and Honourable, is the devout Prayer of

York, Decem∣ber the fifth, 1642
