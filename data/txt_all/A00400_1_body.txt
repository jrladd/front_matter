MOst excellent Lord, the haughtie and high purposes, and the won∣derfull enterprises of our Spani∣ardes haue beene so great, that they haue not well neere suffe∣red in all the compasse of the whole worlde, any Seas, any Islandes, or Territories, that they haue not runne vnto; and whereof they haue not woone some knowledge, against the opinion of the olde Philosophers, and Cosmographers: wherein they haue founde such diuersitie of people, and so many differences of lawes, and superstitiōs, and so many sorts of gouernmentes, and such diuersitie of manners, that they haue no small admiration to thinke of the same; and namely of that which they doe reporte, of the Maiestie and po∣wer of the king of China: who being a prince geuen to idolatrie, and that way most vaine; As also his subiectes, in the obseruati∣on of the Gentiles lawes, are notwithstanding endued with so great wisedome and discretion in naturall thinges, and in the go∣uernment of their common wealthes, that no other nations (bee they neuer so politike) seeme to passe thē, or haue therein the ad∣uantage of them, nor yet to haue the like wittes, for all maner of Artes▪ Which haue beene the causes that mooues me too write the thinges of this realme, (which haue beene knowen as well by relation of persons of credite that haue beene in it; and also of some of the naturall people of that Countrey of China, that haue been brought into Portugale) and to dedicate the same too your excellent Lordship, acknowledging my selfe in all thinges moste bounde vnto you my Lorde. I desire your lordship to ac∣cept of this little seruice supplied with good will, as of a poore token of my good gratefull minde, which onely hath beene but to geue all honour to your name.
