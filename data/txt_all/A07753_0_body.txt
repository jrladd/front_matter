THere be two whose benifites to vs can neuer be
required: God, and our parents, the one for that
he gaue vs a reasonable soule, the other for that of
thē we haue our beeing. To these the prince & (as
Cicero tearmeth him) the God of the Philosophers
added our maisters, as those by whose directions
the faculties of the reasonable soule be stirred vp
to enter into contemplation, & searching of more
then earthly things: whereby we obtaine a second
being, more to be wished and much more durable
thē that which any man since the worlds creatiō hath receiued of his parents:
causing vs liue in the mindes of the vertuous, as it were, deified to the poste∣ritie.
The consideration of this hath moued me to publish these labors of
mine vnder your name both to signifie vnto the world, my thankfull mind: &
also to notifie vnto your selfe in some sort the entire loue and vnfained affec∣tion
which I beare vnto you. And seeing we liue in those daies wherein enuie
raigneth; and that it is necessary for him who shall put to light any such thing
as this is, to choose such a patron, as both with iudgement may correct it, and
with authority defend him from the rash censures of such as thinke they gaine
great praise in condemning others: Accept (I pray you) of this booke, both
that you may exercise your deepe skill in censuring of what shall be amisse, as
also defend what is in it truely spoken, as that which somtime proceeded from
your selfe. So shall your approbation cause me thinke the better of it, & your
name set in the forefront thereof be sufficient to abate the furie of many insul∣ting
momistes who think nothing true but what they doo themselues. And as
those verses were not esteemed Homers which Aristarchus had not approuod,
so wil I not auouch for mine that which by your censure shalbe condemned.
And so I rest,
