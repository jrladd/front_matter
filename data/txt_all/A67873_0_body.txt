MY LORD.
THat I have preferred so slender a Volume to Your Honorable Patronage, is no more than



the Subject of it (which is Ho∣nor) erects; as Your Lord∣ship is known of the first and greatest of those that chal∣lenge a concernment therein; yet not more eminent by that of Your blood, then of the inward Noblenesse of Your Vertues, whereof the World hath received un∣matchable testimonies. These reasons as they oblige me to this presentment; so I can∣not but hope will also plead pardon for the trouble it brings a long with it; and (that once obtained) I am



assured of the preservation of this imperfect Essay, under the powerfull Protection of your Lordships name: Of the infinite Honorers where∣of, none is more ambitious to be known such, than
My LORD,
