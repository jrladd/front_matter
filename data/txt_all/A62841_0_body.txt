THE Public is so seldom in∣terested
in the Debates of
privat Men, and I am so
little concern'd at the Malice or Mi∣stakes
of my Adversaries, that, with∣out
som better Motive, I would never
presume to trouble the World with any
thing merely personal. But if the
Subject in question be of extraordinary
Weight and Consequence, and that on
the certain Decision of it should de∣pend
the Tranquillity of a considera∣ble
number of People, then I think a
Man is indispensably oblig'd to ap∣pear
for the Truth; and so, while he's
endeavoring to serve others, no body
will say he ought to neglect his own

Defence. Whether the Treatise I now
send you be of this Nature, is submit∣ted
to your equal Iudgment: And
unless I really design'd a Nobler
End by it than the Iustification of one
Person, neither you nor any body else
should lose your time in reading, no
more than I my self would be at the
Pains of writing it, which yet I'll
count the highest Pleasure if I un∣derstand
it has never so little con∣tributed
to the Satisfaction of a Gen∣tleman
of such undisputed Learning
and Merit.
March 30. 1699.
