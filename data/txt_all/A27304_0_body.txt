To George Greenviel Esq
SIR,
AT this Critical Juncture, I find the Authors will have need of a Protector, as well as the Nation, we having peculiar Laws and Liberties to be defended as well as that, but of how different a Nature, none but such Judges as you, are fit to determine; what∣ever our Province be, I am sure it should be Wit, and you know what Ellevated Ben says, That none can judge of Wit but Wit. Let the Heroes toyl for Crowns and Kingdoms, and with what pretences they please. Let the

Slaves of State drudge on for false and empty Glories, troubling the repose of the World and ruin∣ing their own to gain uneasy Gran∣dure, whilst you, Ob! happyer Sir, great enough by your Birth, yet more Illustrious by your Wit, are capable of enjoying alone that true Felicity of Mind, which be∣longs to an absolutely Vertuous and Gallant Man, by that, and the lively Notions of Honour Im∣printed in your Soul, you are a∣bove Ambition, and can Form Kings and Heroes, when 'ere your delicate Fancy shall put you upon the Poetical Creation.
You can make those Heroes Lovers too, and inspire 'em with

a Language so Irresistable as may instruct the Fair, how easily you can Conquer when it comes to your turn, to plead for a Heart, nor is your delicate Wit the only Charm; your Person claims an e∣qual share of Graces with those of your Mind, and both together are capable of rendering you Vi∣ctorious, whereever you shall please to Address 'em, but your Vertue keeps you from those Ra∣vages of Beauty, which so wholty imploy the hours of the Rest of the Gay and Young, whilst you have siness more sollid, and more oble for yours.
I would not by this have the World imagine, you are therefore

exempt from the tenderness of Love, it rather seems you were on purpose form'd for that soft Entertainment, such an Agree∣ment there is between the Har∣mony of your Soul and your Per∣son, and sure the Muses, who have so divinely inspir'd you with Poetic Fires, have furnisht you with that Necessary, Material (Love) to maintain it, and to make it burn with the more Elle∣vated Flame.
`Tis therefore Sir, I expect you will the more easily Pardon the the Dedicating to your idler hours (if any such you have) this little Amour, all that I shall say for it, is, that 'tis not Translation but

an Original, that has more of realty then fiction, if I have not made it fuller of intreague, 'twas because I had a mind to keep close to the Truth.
I must own, Sir, the Obliga∣tions I have to you, deserves a greater testimony of my respect, then this little peice, too trivial to bear the honour of your Name, but my increasing Indisposition makes me fear I shall not have many opportunities of this Kind, and shou'd be leath to leave this ungrateful World, without ac∣knowledging my Gratitude more signally then barely by word of Mouth, and without wishing you all the happiness your merit and

admirable Vertues deserve, and of assuring you how unfeignedly I am (and how Proud of being) Sir,
