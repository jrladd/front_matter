RIght Honorable, Worshipfull, and dearly beloued in our Lord Iesus: It hath beene an ancient and laudable Custome of

the Church of God, as to ordaine generally certaine ordinarie Loue-Feasts and Christian Meetings, for the more comfortable ex∣ercise and maintenance of Brotherly Loue, which is the Bond of Perfection: so more especially, when the Lord hath enlarged him∣selfe in any extraordinarie Fauour vnto his Church, by deliuering the same out of some desperate and inexplicable danger. We haue not onely the ex∣presse commaund of God, to be enlarged in thank∣fulnesse accordingly, but to expresse our thankeful∣nesse: as principally by exercising our selues in Psalmes and Hymnes, and

spirituall reioycings; so also (to testifie our renued interest in the Creatures, which such Extremities might haue vtterly depri∣ued vs of) in this respect also, to solace our selues in a more liberall vse thereof by solemne Feastings, and all such outward Meanes, as together with inward refreshing of the Minde, might also tend aboun∣dantly to the comfort of the body; as being much weakened and disinabled with the feare and expec∣tation of former Dangers. And thus wee may finde, that the Church of God hath vpon such Occasion accordingly practised. See Hest. 9. Nehem. 8.

And thus doe wee at this day solemnize the Memoriall of our Wonder∣full and glorious Deliuerance from the Kingdome of Darkenesse, by the True Light of the World, Iesus Christ: Who as at this Time shined as it were in the darkenesse and obscu∣ritie of his Humane Na∣ture, that so hee might bring Light out of Darke∣nesse, and by his abasing of himselfe vnto the shape of a Seruant, might restore vs to the glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God. Wherein howsoeuer happily we are not free from some vniust imputation of superstition, by such, who being not able to discerne betweene the

right vse, and abuse of things, doe therefore con∣demne our Liberty for the common abuse thereof in these licentious Times, by turning the same as an oc∣casion to the flesh: yet nei∣ther ought their aspersions any whit to discourage a∣ny religious heart from an holy improuing of his Li∣berty to the glory of God, seeing they proceed rather of superstitious singularity then any sound ground of Truth: Neither may we doubt, but that our reue∣rend and spirituall Behaui∣our herein, as it shall iustly cleare vs from any impu∣tation of superstition, so it may also free vs from the danger of any such abuse,

which the loosenesse of the times is guiltie of. For howsoeuer it may not be denyed, but that such Ob∣seruations as were meerely of Humane Inuention; or though they were of Gods appointment, yet tending to the obscuring and a∣brogating of the Truth of Christ, were meerely su∣perstitious, and so to bee renounced of vs, as they were abolished by Christ: such as were the Ceremo∣nies of Moyses, and what∣soeuer else of the like na∣ture: Yet whatsoeuer Or∣dinances haue their Equitie from the Law of God, and Practise of the Saints, according thereunto, and withall are so farre from

opposing the Uertue of Christ, or Christian Li∣bertie, as that both in their Intent and Use they may further to the more com∣fortable enioying of both: as these haue their suffici∣ent warrant, because they further that blessed Com∣munion betweene God and Man, and serue also for the maintenance of ho∣ly Societie betweene Man and Man; so may wee lawfully vse our Liber∣tie herein, so all things bee done to the Glo∣rie of God, and mutu∣all Edification: Especi∣ally, seeing the lawfull Custome of our Church and State ought to bind vs wisely heerein, if

we will not be contentious, whereof we haue no such custome, neither the Chur∣ches of God. And there∣fore, howsoeuer to him that doubteth, this libertie may be sinne; & that much more, if hee shall proceed to condemne others, where∣in himselfe is not resol∣ued; and that most of all, if hee shall depriue himselfe of the libertie in good things, vpon pretence of some e∣uill that doth hang vpon the same (as the manner of some is:) yet should this rather prouoke vs to im∣proue our libertie to the best in all spirituall man∣ner, that so eyther the Mouth of Iniquitie may be vtterly stopped, or ope∣ned

graciously to glorifie our God with vs, euen on our behalfe. The Meanes and Triall hereof, seeing it consists in the holy orde∣ring and gouernment of the Affections, as euidencing the inward puritie of the hart; which being purified by Faith, all things be∣come pure thereunto: therefore shall this Direc∣tion at this Time prooue most seasonable, wherein by our libertie in the flesh, we may be so easily pro∣uoked to exceed to the sa∣tisfying of the flesh. Nei∣ther onely shall it serue for the restrayning of In∣temperancie at this time: But seeing the whole course of our Christian Life is gra∣ciously

ledde, and so ac∣cordingly followeth the wise Temper of our Af∣fections, and so is also approued and perfected thereby: Therefore also shall this Light prooue a profitable Guide, to conduct vs throughout all the Difficulties and Infirmities thereof: As seruing for an Armour both to enable vs in the Conquest of such E∣nemies, which will bee sure at all times to op∣pose vs in our Heauen∣ly Iourney; as also the better to comfort vs, in regard of such Infirmi∣ties, and outward faylings, which doe oftentimes mainely challenge the

truth of our proceeding. For as, if there be a willing minde, the Lord accepts it aboue what we do, or can doe, that so wee may dis∣cerne a truth of Grace in the imperfection thereof: so seeing the Lord will perfect the worke he hath begun in vs. And yet in that man∣ner, that still his power must be seene in our weakenesse, that he may haue the only glory; therefore as this is for the present our euidence of sinceritie, that we loue & affect what we cannot do, greeuing withall for our fayling heerein; so by these contrarie affections about the same Obiect, wee doe not onely Iu∣stifie the Spirituall combate,

but do daily interesse our selues heereby in the ver∣tue of our Christ, by whom we are not only sustained in the combate, aboue any abilitie in our selues, but also by his vertue, we are daily strengthned against all oppositions, that so in time we may be more then Conquerors. But of these things more particularly in the Treatise ensuing. Which as I haue now ac∣cording to my promise, published for the Common good; so because we liue in a prophane and surfeting Age, wherein all is coun∣ted too little for the satis∣fying of the Flesh: and e∣uery little too-much, that serues by the restraining

thereof to the satisfaction of the Mind: therefore are my Meditations sorted ac∣cordingly; As in some breuitie and much weake∣nesse, to stumble the pro∣phane, who stands vpon colour more then cloth, doting rather vpon what may affect and puffe vp the giddy braine, then what may reforme and humble the honest heart: so thereby also to exercise, and stirre vp the dulnesse of the best; that what seemes not so apparant at the first view, may by more serious Me∣ditation and feruent prayer be better conceiued, and more profitably digested. And therefore also haue I beene the briefer in this

Generall discouery of the go∣uernment of the Affections; because my purpose is (God-willing) to adde shortly hereunto a Parti∣cular Discouery of each se∣uerall Affection, according to their Order, Nature, and Differences; wherein by the Grace of God there may be some profitable supply in speciall, for what soeuer is wanting in the Generall direction. Meane while, that I might not be wanting to the season, whereby the time may in some measure be redee∣med, and the hearts of Gods children raysed vp to further hope. I haue thought good first to frame these Wals and Gates

for the Citie, that so the Inward buildings may be more safely erected and perfected. Of all which, as I haue bin bold to make choice of your Honours & Wor. as Patrons; and Gar∣dians, as to whom being al∣ready bound by so many former fauours; I could not choose but renew my Bonds, by paying this poor Interest, though far I hope from any base Usurie: yet binding hereby to a conti∣nuall debt of loue, which is then best paid, when stil it is owed. And so I humbly request you to accept ther∣of, not as a discharge of my debt, but only a pledge of the renewing of the bonds of my best affections towards your

Worships, which seeing they ought not to be mea∣sured by any outward ex∣pressing thereof, therefore my hope is, that you will accept of my endeauours herein, not according vn∣to that which I haue, but answerable to my affection therein. Comforting my selfe heerein: that seeing God hath giuen you wise∣dome to discern of things that differ, and our hearts are in the hands of God, that if we preuaile with him, we shall preuaile with men: therefore, as my desire heerein, is to approue my selfe vnto God and the consciences of his people; so other things shall be so farre supplied, as that still

the power of God may be seene in our weakenesse, and the Lord may haue the glory of all his mer∣cies. What others ayme at in these endeauours, I mat∣ter not; neither doe I en∣uie at what they reape: much lesse doth it stumble me, what this way of ma∣king our selues knowne to the World, daily heares of, either vaineglory or fil∣thy lucre, or such like: It sufficeth me, that my re∣ward is with God, and that I haue daily experi∣ence of the difference be∣tweene his paiment and mans, that so I might trust him better, and man the lesse; and yet still not to faile any good occasion,

whereby I may prouoke men, that they may be like vnto God in a wiser dispo∣sall of their Affections. This is that I ayme at in this Treatise. This I shall heartily labour for in my best deuotions and suppli∣cations vnto our God for you, that he would en∣crease in you al wisedome and spirituall vnderstan∣ding, that you may ap∣proue the most excellent, and like wise Merchants, still be buying that Preti∣ous Pearle; and hauing once obtained it, labour stil to husband it with most aduantage to Gods glory and the good of his Church, being neuer weary of wel∣doing, that so you may

reape in due time if you faint not, that so you may fight the good fight of faith and finish your course with ioy, and so lay hold of Eternall life. And so I heartily commend you all to the grace of God in Christ Iesus. Re∣sting in him.
