Honourable Sir,
THe less knowing, and more illiterate sort of Criticks may perhaps both accuse and condemn me guilty of a piacular offence, in offering these Fables at the Altar of your noble Name, whose most solid and pro∣found Judgment renders you inca∣pable of conversing with things so much beneath you.
But yet again I am lull'd into a well-grounded Belief, that the more Intelligible and Scientifick part of Mankind will assoil me from the imputation of this misprision, upon this sober and serious consideration, that Aesop, the Phrygian Fabulist, was, when in his most unpolish'd and uncouthest shape, still acceptable to the Breasts and Closets of the bravest Princes; and had a fair Tombe erected to his memory, to witness what veneration and esteem those darker Times gave to the Genius which seem'd to illuminate that Part of the World with his facetious Wit and Learning.
From these premisses therefore (Honourable Sir) I have been ambitiously bold to deduce this undeniable conclusion; that, if Aesop was so acceptable to all, when in his native, rude, and home-spun habit; how much more now, being apparel'd in a variable dress, and appearing in publique with the concomi∣tant attendants of two Foreign Languages, whose faces and graces you accurately understand as clearly as your own.
And this, Sir, together with the grateful resentment of your multiplyed obligations, and your designed study to advance ingenious Arts and Sciences, hath encouraged me prostrately to dedicate this Peece to your indulgent Patronage; and lay it and my self at your feet, with the elevation of my heart and hands to the highest throne above, to bless you with length of days, and all imaginable felicity; which is the most fervent prayer of
Honourable Sir,
