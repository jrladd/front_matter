Madam,
THis following Discourse of the Holy Ghost, his impressions and workings on the soul of man, was first intended only for private sa∣tisfaction to your Ladiships pious desires; That be∣ing well grounded in the Orthodox Doctrine, and having a right understanding of the true Spirit of God, it might be as an impregnable bulwark against so many suggestions and temptations of the false and deceitful spirit: For the minde of man, being either devoid of the Spirit of Grace and Holinesse; or else of a right understanding of the things of Gods Spi∣rit, who is the Fountain both of Grace and Truth; is too apt and prone to close with the suggestions of the evil spirit, who is the author and promoter of sinfulnesse and error: Never Age produc't so many spiritual Monsters, as this wherein we live. And I think few parts of England be so much infected with them, as these Northern parts be. They were ve∣ry impudent and daring, when they adventured to tempt your vertuous minde, and by inticing words
to allure your good opinion of them; as full well knowing, if they could but have effected thus much, to have made you not an enemy to their procee∣dings, though you did not close with them, it would have given much lustre and credit to their erroneous Sect: But God be praised that you are better groun∣ded, then to be proselyted by such Ignoramo's; bet∣ter resolved then to be taken with such shallow delu∣sions, which a good Christian with half an eye unpre∣judic'd, may easily see through.
It is your goodnesse (for, Bonum quo melius eo communius) to desire the publique communication of this short Discourse of the Spirit, as a Doctrine both seasonable in respect of the many spreading infectious Errors, so much prevailing amongst us; and also necessary, as an antidote against that con∣tagion which issuing out of the mouth of Hell pre∣sumes most impudently and impiously to hide its ve∣nome under the name and title of the Holy Spirit: I could wish the Doctrine were for this end, more fully and satisfactorily cleared to the mindes of men by the Pen of some more Judicious Writer; This mean Tract the Author in all humility acknowledges to be guilty of many defects and impertinencies, and himself one of the meanest of the faithful and obedi∣ent sons of the Church: The small acceptance it shall finde in the world, will be derived from your white Name and Vertue: in which Sanctuary it may escape the black-mouth'd Detractions of the Censo∣rious, and rest secure of the good acceptance, if not be∣nefit of others.
May you be every day more happy in the in∣crease
of all Christian vertues, growing up in the knowledge of God, and persevering in the constant Profession of his holy Truth, and conscientious pra∣ctise of the same, till you arrive at the Haven of true Happinesse. This (Madam) shall be the con∣stant endevour, and is the daily prayer
