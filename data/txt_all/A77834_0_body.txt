MY LORD,
IT is observable in the Catalogue of antient worthies that such were accounted most eminent that arriving at the
 highest pitch of Honor, did prove most humble. Hence that famous Emperor Theodosi∣us esteemed it a greater Ho∣nor to be called membrum Ec∣clesiae, then to bee stiled Caput Imperij. The servant of the Church, then the Soveraign of an Empire. Humility is that Grace that Eternizes the fame of all Gods worthies. Hence Joshuah, David and o∣thers are renowned for ever, as most Eminent in fighting the Battels of the Great God: whose undertakings were Crown'd with the greatest successe for the advancement of the Cause of God. With no
 lesse Honor and successe hath it pleased the Almighty to own your Highnesses pro∣ceedings, by many signall deliverances in Crowning your Highnesse endeavours with so many renowned Victories. Upon whose Gra∣cious temper I have presu∣med to present my weak en∣deavours which containes that subject which King Da∣vid himselfe thought necessa∣ry to be searcht into: And being the practise of so Holy a man as David, I hope may prove acceptable to your Highnesse; into whose Clemencie and good∣nesse,
 I cast my selfe, and all at your mercifull Interpre∣tation, which if I were not in some measure assured of, the place where these labours had their Birth should have been the place of their Buriall; neither should they have gone a∣ny further then those walls wherein they were Enclo∣sed, and so have breath∣ed forth their last where they had their first Being: Presuming therefore on your Highnesse, who is not one∣ly the Patron but Protector of the Truth: I shelter my poor labours under the
 wings of your Protection, desiring a favourable con∣struction, and rest
