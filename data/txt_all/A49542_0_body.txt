HAving received so glorious a mercy, as to be delivered from many delusions and temptations of Sathan, under which I lay for many years, I look up∣on it as my great duty, to manifest Gods grati∣ous dealings with me to the Sons and Daughters of Men, and so much the rather do I thus judge
because the wayes of God to me have not been common or ordinary wayes, they are but a few of Gods Children (as the Authour of the book entituled,Dr. Tho. Goodwin. A Child of Light walking in darkness, witnesseth) whom their Father casts into the belly of Hell, deep Waters, where they feel no bottom, letting out Sathan upon them, and the manifestation of his glorious grace in saving such to the utmost is the main end (one of them) he aimeth at in dealing thus with any, 'tis no wonder Satan should have an access to and converse with the spirits of men (and many times when they know it not) for he is a Spirit, or that with so much vigour and terrour, his temptations, in times of de∣sertion, should be accompanyed, for by the evi∣dence of Gods word ana his own ways, 'tis cer∣tain that his work and business is to drink up and devour, his nature is not only that of a Roaring Lyon for power and terrour, but also of a subtle Serpent for pollicy and poison: his season and opportunity is when we are weakest and at the worst, and night and day doth he keep watch and ward for taking all the advantage
that may be, if God (for needful ends) turns but his back upon his child, hides his face from him, forsakes him but for a little moment: the enemy waiteth at the door to break in as a mighty flood. If by Feavor, Melancholly, or other bodily distempers, the natural spirits (which are the ursitors between the body and the Soul) are made uncapable of performing their Office aright; then is he sure to be up and doing; every affiction is an hour of temptation the dark is his delight now is the time for him to lay his delusions upon the fantasie, and to charge sin upon the Soul, when he findeth it most unable to resist and ready to embrace and believe it.
To bring the Soul in to inextricable troubles is his design; to accomplish with more then con∣ceiveable pollicy, cruelty, and mallice are set at work, for he is the red Dragon who hath all along traded in persecution of the woman and her seed, Christ and his Church.
For the space of fourty years or thereabouts hath it pleased the hand that took me out of my Mothers Womb to train me up, and lead me along in this uncomfortable Wilderness of
temptation, though I cannot say that in all these years he hath left me to the violence of spiritual conflicts (for then the burthen had been too heavy for flesh to stand under so long) yet must I needs say my clearest day all that time was but dark, and however I seemed to others in point of comfort outwardly, sure I am my soul enjoyed not her rest, nor could I ever say I was all that while any more then a Priso∣ner of hope, still subject unto bondage and not discharged of the debt, nor delivered from my fears. 'Twas but an hard shift I made to hold up my head when I was at best, my worst cannot be expressed, until now at last, that God for whom I wited in the way of his Judgements, and from whom were my expectations in the use of appointed means all this while, came and was found of me when I looked not for him, delivered me from my strong Enemy, set my Feet upon a Rock and established my goings. The same God that was my stay in the day of ca∣lamity, is now my Glory and the lifter up of my head, he is my strength and song, and is now become my Salvation.
Upon the whole I may truly say (as once
Job said) I have heard of God by the hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eye hath seen him, now hath he made known himself to me by his sweet Spirit, and by the manifestation and operation of his glorious power in giving me deliverance, And I can say by experience more then ever that; now I know there is a God; so also, now I know there is a Devill, such have been the delusions; cursed injections of blas∣phemous thoughts, and dreadful tempta∣tions wherewith he hath endeavoured to fill my Soul till the day the Lord by his great power delivered me out of his hands that I have cause to know him, and to make him known as far as I am able to the World, which is the endeavour of this ensuing Re∣lation.
Every Child of God, I am perswaded, is somewhat acquainted with the wounds of con∣science, but God (who best knows the frame of his people and what they can bear, and for what work they are intended) measures not to all alike. Some are made to sip, onely, of the Cup of Trembling, while others are made to drink down larger draughts, every Soul hath
his tast, To much as will serve to make an ex∣periment of the evil and bitter nature of sin, but some have more then others, and though every man is apt to magnifie his own miseries into a Non such, because the heart knows his own bitterness, and a wounded Conscience who can bear, yet without breach of modesty, I think I may bolaly affirm that few of the Sons of Men have been in greater danger, or more beholden to the Deliverer. To have God deserting a Soul, and permitting Satan to Rage and Rule so far that it believeth all his suggestions and is not able to believe the contrary, expecting nothing but the lower∣most Hell. This was my condition, and when I have told you so though you might perceive something of my sad and wearysome Life, yet cannot the misery be expressed by me, nor con∣ceived by you; a thousand worlds, had I been owner, would I have given for a Free Spi∣rit, a heart enabled to shake off the meditating and pondering upon Hell torments as the things that methoughts; I should for ever dwell with Now I say when all this lay upon my Soul, and I expected no deliverance, then for the Lord my God to surprize and break in
upon me with so glorious and unexpected a mercy who can but set forth the loving kind∣ness of so gratious a God and Saviour.
I may therefore boldly say to any poor Soul let his distress be never so great, yet if he have but so much faith as to believe the Scriptures and that Jesus is the Son of God, and died for sinners, though he hath no assu∣rance for himself, no more hopes then I had not a spark of Grace in his own apprehension,Is. 50.10. Yet let him trust in the name of the Lord and stay himself upon his God. Let him wait for the Lord will come.Is. 8.17. And such a faith is sufficient for such a Soul in that condition:
In my distress before my God gave me ex∣perience of Light, Love, and Salvation, I engaged by promise that if my God would give me deliverance I would declare to his Saints abroad what he had done for me, and that as Satan suggested to me before, that I should be a shame to Professors: so would I declare his wiles and devices and what a ly∣ing unclean and murdering Spirit he is, that in what I could, his designs of ruine against
poor Souls might be frustrated, and the Lord having heard my vows, setting me at liberty a strong temptation fell upon me to pray that God would assist me in performance of them, nor were my prayers single or alone, I had the help of such as feared God about me, my body at that time was very much disor∣dered.
Yet he that prepared my heart to pray en∣clined his Ear to hear, enabling with speed and ease, to the wonder of some, to Write the ensuing discourse I here present to open view, with much hope, that the same hand that made it easie to me, will make it useful to many who may be troubled in Spirit. For the comfort of such, and the discovery of Sathans subtilty: the good of them, and hurt of none but Him, are the ends I have in publishing this expe∣rimental Relation, begging that the Lord would exalt his great and glorious Name in magnifying his Mercy to all Eternity, by dealing thus with many poor Souls, as he hath done with his poor ser∣vant.
