That my Doctrine is grounded on the Foundation of Truth and Verity, will appear most plainly by the Sacred Reâˆ£cords thereof, the Holy Scriptures. And I have Faith to believe that I shall in due time, and when Patience hath Perfected her Work, have Justice to Relieve and Right me; And that from him into whose Hand God hath Committed the Sword of it, our most Sacred Soverign, whom God preserve long to Reign over us; and still mightily and miraculously Protest and Defend from all the Devilish Plots and Conspiracies of His Enemies.
