THe manifold benefites that I haue receiued at your Honors hands, since my returne into England, haue enforced me to seeke some meanes whereby J might make known my thank∣fulnes for the same. And finding nothing more a∣greeable vnto your Honorable cares in the seruice of her Maiestie, wherein I might do you more hum∣ble seruice then in the practise of Fortification, ha∣uing had sight therein since the view taken by the Marques Ʋitell, for the oppressing of the Lowe Countries, with the yoke of Citadels, and exercise sithence Don Johns departing from Bruxels vnto

Namure: which practise, although it be not so com∣mon amongst vs, (or of some thought altogether so necessary for vs) as for the nations whose countries do lie adioyning together, where an enemie may en∣ter with a great number of horse & men vpon the sodaine: yet is the knowledge necessarie, that when the practise should bee put in execution in the ser∣uice of her Maiestie, that perfection might be efec∣ted that might do her Highnesse seruice. And ther∣fore I haue compiled this little treatise of the prac∣tise of Fortification, which J most humbly present vnto your Honors, beseeching you to receiue it as a most humble token of the desire J haue to do you seruice.
