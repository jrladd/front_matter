HE that adventures upon any
thing contrary to the General
received practice, what ever his
own courage and resolutions
are, had need to be supported, not only by
the most Wise and Honourable, but also

the most Powerful Persons that are in a
Nation or Kingdom; For let the Propo∣sals
be never so advantagious to the Pub∣lick,
they shall not only be decried and
neglected, but it is well, if the Promoter
be not both abused and ruined: Yet I, not∣withstanding
all these discouragements,
have not been silent, but in order to Child∣rens
better Education, have long since pub∣lished
my thoughts, and have and do declare,
that the multitude of Schools for the learning
of the Latine and Greek Tongues, are destru∣ctive
both to our youth and the Commonwealth;
and if the Opinion of Sir Francis Bacon in
his Advice to King Iames concerning Sut∣ton's
Hospital, be not sufficient to warrant
my Assertion, I could heartily wish that
no such Evidence could have been produ∣ced,
as the late unhappy Wars, in the
Bowels of this Kingdom hath afforded us;
for what he saith there by way of Advice,
we by woful Experience have found too
true; that by reason of the multitude of
Grammar Schools, more Scholars are
dayly brought up, than all the Preferments
in this Nation can provide for, and so they
become uncapable of other Professions,
and unprofitable in their own, and at last
become, materia rerum novarum; whether
this be an essential or an accidental Effect,

I will not here dispute; the truth of it, I
am sure, cannot be denied: but that is not
all; by this means it comes to pass, that
four of the seven Liberal Arts, are almost
wholly neglected, as well in both Univer∣sities,
as in all Inferiour Schools; and set∣ting
aside the City of London, there are
but few Places in this Nation, where a man
can put his Son, to be well instructed in A∣rithmetick,
Geometry, Musick and Astronomy;
and even that Famous City was without a
Publick School for Mathematical Learn∣ing,
till His present Majesty was pleased to
lay the Foundation; nay so averse are men
in the general to these Arts (which are
the support of all Trade) that without a
high hand, it will be almost impossible, to
make this People wise for their own good:
I come therefore to your Honour, humbly
to beg your Countenance and Assistance,
that the Stream of Learning may be a lit∣tle
diverted, in those Schools that are al∣ready
erected, and to be instrumental for
the erecting more, when they shall be
wanting; that we may not be permitted
still to begin at the wrong end; but that
according to the practice of the Ancient
Philosophers, Children may be instructed
in Arithmetick, Geometry, Musick and A∣stronomy;
before the Latine and Greek

Grammars are thought on, these Arts in
themselves, are much more easie to be
learned, tend more to a general good, and
will in a great measure facilitate the Learn∣ing
of the Tongues, to as many as shall af∣ter
this Foundation laid, be continued at
School, and provided for in either Univer∣sities.
Your Honour was instrumental to
enlarge the Maintenance for God's Mini∣ster
in the Place where I live, and perhaps
it may please God to make you so, not on∣ly
in making this Place in particular, but
many other Places in this Land happy, by
procuring Schools for these Sciences, and
not only so, but by your Loyal and Prudent
managing the several Trusts committed to
you, you may do much for God's Glory,
your Countries Good, and the continuance
of your own Honour to all Future Genera∣tions,
which is, and shall be the Prayer of,
