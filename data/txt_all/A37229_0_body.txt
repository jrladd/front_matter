SIR,
IT hath alwayes been a commendable de∣sign in those Authors, who have spent their Labours in the survey of Ancient places, when they could no longer entertain us with an account of their flourishing con∣dition, to give us the most satisfactory pro∣spect they could of their Ruines. Such is the Relation given here of your Ancient Mona∣stical, and Cathedral Church of Durham; of which, I question not, but much more might have been said, had any one made it his bu∣siness to give a compleat Description there∣of.

As soon as this Piece, in Manuscript, came to my hands, I must confess it renew'd in me the memory of my obligations to a famous Native of that place, my early Friend, and Patrone, John Hall Esq to whom you were by a happy Alliance so nearly Related. Won∣der not then, if, partly upon that inducement, and partly upon the score of your being an Inhabitant of the same City, as also that of your being a person particularly addicted to the study of Antiquities, I address the Print to your Patronage. Which I do with this further wish, that what I have occasionally communicated to the Publick, may prove an incentive to your self, or some others in your parts, to make what Additionals you think fit, concerning your St. Cuthbert, and the Cathedral of Durham, so famous through the World upon his account. I am,
SIR, 
London, Oct. 4. 1671.
