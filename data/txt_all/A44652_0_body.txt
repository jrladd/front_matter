SIR,
SUch as have Dedicated their Writings to Princes, have usually presented them in Characters that rather shew'd what Excellent Princes might be, than what they were; and so resembling one another, that most of them seem'd flatter∣ing Copies, and very few like the Originals.
I esteem it therefore a very great Happiness to be freed from Flattery, by being only Just to
You, since of no less a Nature are Your Actions, than to make it almost impossible for any to Approach You with that Servile Prejudice to Themselves and Princes.
This, SIR, will be justified by repeating only that You Re∣stor'd a Nation from falling to be no more a People; almost ready to become Slaves by the Loss of their Religion, Laws, and Liberties. Nor did You only Re∣deem, but made Your Redempti∣on perfect, and by an unparallel'd Goodness parted with a large Branch, of the standing Revenue, only to Ease Your People from the Weight and Oppression of it. And having Reliev'd them from all their Wrongs, You confirm'd by a Law their Declared Rights, shewing such an Affection for
Your People, as was contrary to the Methods of our late Princes; who design'd that Power for Destruction, which You us'd for Preservation.
This Dedication, SIR, is also proper for You, since the subject Matter of it was the Cause that excited You to Attempt our Relief, thrô so many Threatning Dangers.
The Stories shew how those unhappy Princes, Edward and Richard II. misguided by Am∣bitious Ministers, believ'd there was an Interest separated from their Peoples, and that Interest secur'd only by such a natur'd Power, as Slaves, not Subjects, were capable to submit to. Those Fatal Methods and Arbitrary De∣signs were exactly Copied by our Two last unhappy Princes:
And You that Redeemed Us from all those threatning Cala∣mities are justly presented with this Memorial, and with the Prayers of all good Men, that our Deliverer may be ever pre∣serv'd in Health, long Life and Prosperity in this World, and the perpetual Life and Felicity of the World to come. Amongst others be pleased, SIR, to ac∣cept the particular Devotion of,
SIR,
