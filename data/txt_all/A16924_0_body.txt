SIR:
RIch Friends may send you rich Pre∣sents,
while poore ones haue no∣thing
but good wishes to present
you. Though I bee one of the last
ranke, and therefore cannot doe like the first,
yet it is my ambition to bring more then bare
wishes with me, to one of whom I haue recei∣ued
reall favours A Countrey Lasse I present
you, that Minerua-like was a brayn-borne child;
and Iouially begot, though now shee seekes her
fortune▪ Shee came out of the cold North, thin∣ly
clad: But Wit had pitty on her; Action ap∣parrell'd
her, and Plaudits clap'd her cheekes
warme. Shee is honest, and modest, though
she speake broad: And though Art neuer strung
her tongue; yet once it yeelded a delightfull



sound: which gain'd her many Lovers and
Friends, by whose good liking she prosperously
liued, vntill her late long Silence, and Disconti∣nuance
(to which shee was compell'd) gaue
her iustly to feare their losse, and her owne de∣cay.
Wherefore shee, now, destrous to settle her
selfe in some worthy seruice; And no way wil∣ling
(like some of further breed) to returne from
this Southern sunshine, back to her natiue Ayre;
I thought it might become my care (having first
brought and estrang'd her from her Countrey)
to sue, with her, for Your noble Patronage; of
Whom, shee heares, (if Flattery abuse her not)
shee hath, heretofore, gotten some good opini∣on.
Your loue to witty, and pleasant Recreati∣ons
of this nature hath brought her on: And
Northern Spirits will soone wex bold. If you
be pleased to accept of her, shee will travaile no
further; but, together with my selfe, remaine
