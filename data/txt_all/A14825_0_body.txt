MAdam, vnder the Patronage of M. Thomas walsingham I pub∣lished a Latine Funerall poeme, where with a pastoral Muse I vn∣dertake (in loue and duetie) to commend the vertuous life, and bewaile the vntimely death of our great Meliboeus the right hono∣rable Sir Francis Walsingham, your late deceased Fa∣ther, a sound piller of our common wealth, and chiefe patron of vertue, learning, and chiualrie. In which poeme al∣beit I neuer attaine the heigth of his worthinesse, yet ma∣nie (rather affecting his praise, then my verse) haue requested and perswaded me to publish Meliboeus in English, for the more generall vnderstanding thereof: that as his life was to all men both pleasing and profitable, so his death might be ho∣nored with a publike sorrow: & that the whole body of this realme, in lamenting the losse of so vigilant a gouernor, might learne therby, (as by a iust necessitie) the more to loue, honor, and obey those few, that yet suruiue, resembling him in high estate, and vertuous condition. Such as the translation is, I humblie offer it to your Ladiships protection, hoping it will be as fauorablie redd & accepted, as it is affectionatly writ∣ten and presented.
