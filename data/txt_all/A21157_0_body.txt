WOrthy Friends: having considered the great labour, industry, and study, re∣quired in the thrice worthy, excellent and needfull faculty of Chyrurgerie; which God of his great love to Man∣kind have ordained to preserve us. By comforting us in curing our infirmi∣ties laid upon us sinfull wretches; whereby hee will be glorified: How ought we then to use our best endevours by all meanes possible to seeke to attain to the highest de∣gree of knowledge herein, that wee may, whereby God may be glorified, the patient releeved, and the Artist re∣warded. And not to rest satisfied, as too too many doe only in what they have learned, by tradition from their
 Masters; looking only what Medicines their Masters used: for Tumours, Wounds, Ulcers, &c. whose Masters (no doubt) knew the differences of those Infirmities with the varieties thereof, and all other circumstances thereto belonging; and how to change, adde, or diminish in the use of their Medicines, and considering the times, how, where, and when to approve each thing in order and in due time: which I heartily wish that all the yonger sort that intend to practise this worthy Faculty may seriously follow, and consider well that they are called hereto; not only for their own gaines, as the most sort (I doubt) doe perswade themselves, but let them strive to use the best meanes chiefly to stirre up Gods glory, and then hee will blesse our labours with reward, and send good successe in our practice; for if wee begin first with him, and make a conscience of what wee doe, hee hath promised to guide and blesse our labours, who will not faile in his part if we doe ours faithfully, and my soule is grieved to see the daily abuses and errours committed in many of this Pro∣fession! Chiefly in the Country, of many wicked wret∣ches, not only men but infinite Petticote Surgeons, that swarme in every Towne, Parish, and for the most part in every Village: that take on them to practise this worthy Facultie; having neither conscience, learning, art, nor feare of God; nor never had good Tutor to instruct them. Yet like blind Bayards boldly adventure on that precious subject of Chyrurgerie; promising to performe, and cure all things that come under their unfortunate hands: yet neither know method nor any meanes rightly to use for to cure it; but for a shew to get money, they will apply some thing be it right or wrong they make little care; they will be sure to get by the bargaine. But for the care and love that I have of those that are trained up (under the true and worthy Professors of this needfull and wor∣thy
 profession) that they should be such as the World ex∣pects; and seeing they daily see the use of the practicke part at the hands of their worthy Masters, so I admonish them all to be very carefull to use all meanes possible to attaine the theorick part of their Faculty, and to be very well seene therein; that they may persevere with the light of true knowledge in that Art, to guide them the perfect way or path of perfection. For he that worketh without the perfect rules of the theoricke parts of this Art, doth worke but as a blind man that caryeth a Picture: cutting sometimes too much, sometimes too little, as well, where hee should not, as where hee should, and so marres all. Wherefore for the better instruction of the younger sort that intend to follow and practice this needfull and wor∣thy Faculty; I have set forth these briefe instructions, for their better memory: as a Load-stone to draw them from one degree to another, both in the parts theorick and practick, with many other needfull passages, to be known of them, for their further good herein, with a briefe tract of Anatomy thereto annexed; all in analised Tables, in the which if they will diligently bestow a little labour, and study therein, I thinke they shall learne more in one mouth, then they shall doe in five, in any other, formerly written in our vulgar tongue, and if they desire further knowledge herein, they may find many great Uolumes written at large concerning all those things (that are here∣in touched, but in briefe) for their further satisfaction. Meane time accept my love, and zeale herein towards the true professors hereof, and the good of my Country; and having this collection, I have been intreated by divers of my good Friends, to publish it: and for the benefit of o∣thers I am very willing to bestow it gratis; for the good of many: and shall be ready if this be well accepted, to set forth divers other things worthy observation; although
 it have been and will be something troublesome to mine old yeares, being now 81 and six moneths. Yet willing to labour to doe good to posterity, and to give my best di∣rections to any that endevour to doe good in the feare of God. For which cause I doe here put forth this Introdu∣ction to the publick view of all; hoping that the judici∣ous, will herein censure the best, and herein accept my good meaning in setting it forth: weighing the imbecility of old age, from whom none must expect to have a thing so exactly done, as in the flourishing yeares and vigour of riper wits. Therefore I hope you will censure all the best way, and accept it as friendly, as I bestow it faithfully and lovingly; seeing that it commeth from a minde which much regardeth your company, though acquainted with few: yet I desire, and wish much happinesse, deepe know∣ledge, perfect ability in your Faculty, in all the Brethren of the whole Society: with my hearty Prayers unto Al∣mighty God, that they may all receive as much fruit by the reading of this Introduction, as I hoped they would do when I penned it. And so with my love I salute you all, and commend you to Gods blessed prote∣ction.
Ʋalete in Christo. Nec pudet vivere. Nec piget mori.
