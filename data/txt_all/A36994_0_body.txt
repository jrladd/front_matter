May it Please Your Grace,
WHEN first my Propitious or Malignant Stars influenc'd the little Genius I now pretend to in Poetry, the Incouragement I had from your Noble Grandfather (whose Extraordinary Iudgment in the Beauties of that Art, as well as Generous Candour in Excu∣sing the Errours of it, render'd him best capable of being a Patron ingag'd me to Launch my ill ballass'd Bark into an Ocean where most of our Tribe too late find themselves

becalm'd with uncertain Applause, or else wrack'd in the storm of ill-natur'd Criticism. Yet had that Illustrious Hero's Commands such an August Prerogative over me, that know∣ing my Fame sufficiently Establish'd in his Applause, suc∣cessful enough I ventur'd on, 'till his never to be forgotten loss to all in General, made me too sadly deplore my own in particular.
How Charming a thing is Dignity, when adorn'd with the glittering Crown of Sence, and the humble Robe of Humility: The Great Ormond was blest with both, in per∣fection; and not only a true Iudge and Generous Patron of Arts and Sciences, but modestly familiar with Virtue, tho' in Rags; never slighting the poor Scholar for his Thread-bare Coat, nor pleas'd with the vain outside of an Embroyder'd Fopp, whose inside he knew to be unfur∣nish'd.
I infer this, as lamenting the ill fortune of Poets, that are not bless'd with a Friendly Party, or a Iudicious Pa∣tron, whose allow'd Vnderstanding, as well as generous good Nature can defend their Works from Malicious Censurers; the Time's Vices will bear no Reflection, and let the Play be never so just to the Rules, if a Rott me Spark finds himself hit, or Madam La Pupsey takes the hint that her dear Lap-Dog is expos'd, the Labour it self is like to be the Poet's only Reward: Modest Reproof is taken for absurd Abuse, and honest Satyr for Dogmatick Slaunder.
And though Horace, reflecting upon such as are blind to heir own Vices in his time, had Courage enough to dare to

tell'em, Stultus, & Improbus, hic Amor est dignusque notari. Yet had he liv'd in this Age, and in some Saty∣rical Piece had dar'd to Expose a Maenius, &c. without a Maecenas to Protect it, his Merit tho' never so Extraordina∣ry, or Fancy or Stile were it never so pure, would all be too weak to defend it against the Critical Party, that found them∣selves Concern'd.
This, I must humbly inform your Grace, I mean as to the General state of Satyrical Poets, without any reflection upon my own; the ensuing Scenes being design'd for diversion, and more proper to oblige an Audience to smile than frown; and tho' some perhaps, being affected with ill Humours, might pick out something to dislike, they generously agreed to in∣courage my Profit; and those that found themselves pleas'd, I thank my Stars, still far exceeded the others in number.
Having at last so well acquitted it self on the Stage (tho' the thronging, imperfect Action, and worse than all, the faulty length, which I will never be guilty of again, render'd it little Diversion the first day) I confess, I could not stifle my Ambition of defiring this honour of your Graces Patronage, and as I have already always found a true Maecenas in your Illustrious Family: You, by a free and easie grant of so great a favour, an endearing sweetness in Behaviour, and graceful Condescension, have so added to my heap of Obligations, that I am disbled by xcess to instruct my Pen my heart's grate∣ful Sentiments.
All Praise is too low, when it approaches to your Graces Character; to say you are adorn'd with the Graceful Humi∣lity,

Eternal Honour, and Wisdom of your admir'd Grand∣father; the Merit, Loyalty, and unequal'd Bravery of your Martial Father, whose Loss our Bleeding Country has never yet recover'd, i Praise indeed, but scarce aspiring to your Desert; your Glorious Campaign with his Sacred Majesty, and all your other Actions, during this Reign, sufficiently sounding your Applause, and ingaging every true Englishman, not only to Love, but Admire; amongst the Crowd of which, I think it my greatest Honour to be Ranked, esteeming no good Fortune greater than to be allow'd,
My Lord,
