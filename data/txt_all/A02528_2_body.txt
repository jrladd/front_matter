Right Worshipfull,
IT is not out of any satiety, that I change from the old Testament to the new; These two, as they are the brests of the Church, so they yeeld milke equally wholsome, equally pleasant vnto able nurselings. Herein I thought good to haue respect vnto my reader, in whose strength there may be difference. That other brest perhaps, doth not let downe this nourishing liquor, so freely, so easily: Euen so small a variety refresheth a weake infant; Neither wid there per∣haps



want some palates, which will finde a more quicke and pleasing rellish in this fresher sustenance; These I thought good to please with a taste, ere they come to sate themselues with a full meale of this diuine nourishment; in emulation of the good Scribe, that brings forth both old, and new. If it please God to inable my life and opportunities, I hope at last, to pre∣sent his Church, with the last seruice of the Historie of either page: wherein my ioy, and my crowne shall be the edification of many. In the meane time, I dedicate this part vnto your name, whom I haue so much cause to obserue, and honor: The blessing of that God (whose Church you haue euer made your cheife Client) be still vpon your head, and that honorable Society which reioyces in so worthy a leader. To it, and your selfe, I shall be euer (as I haue cause) humbly and vnfainedly de∣uoted
