AS to the building of the materiall Temple (Right Reuerend Father in God, and my very Honorable good Lord) many co adiutors and fellow-labourers were admitted, some more excellent then others, yet none were repelled, nor reiected, although they were of the meaner sort, as Morter carriers: be∣cause they were necessarie. Euen so reason willeth, and necessitie requireth, that they which are lawfully called to the office of the Ministery, although they are not Archi∣tects,
 yet if they may do good in the Church of God, should be suffered to help a little to build vp the Spirituall Temple of the Lord: For many hands make light worke. The consideration hereof hath emboldened me, being as it were, the least of the Apostles, and also requested of many who saw my notes, and heard mee preach them, to at∣tempt this worke; wherein if I may adde but one mite to the treasurie of the Church, to help a little to build the Lords spirituall House, I shall thinke my labour well be∣stowed. Howsoeuer, I would not with that small Talent which I haue concredited vn∣to me, be like to that euill seruant, which made no good vse of his, but hid it in the ground, and therefore was shamefully re∣proued.
The subiect, or matter, which I haue ta∣ken vpon mee to intreat of, is, of our last ac∣count at the generall Assize in the last Day. A matter most fitting and beseeming my gray haires going to the graue, and requisite for all sorts of people liuing in this carelesse age, and very auaileable to shake them out
 of the cradle of securitie, wherein they lye lulled and rocked, and to stirre them vp to vigilance and watchfulnesse. This worke, I confesse, is a withered fruit of my old age, but if it may obtaine your Honours fauour so farre, as to cherish and protect it vnder the shadow of your wings, it growing to maturitie, in processe of time may obtaine some fauour in the world, especially among the Children of God, whom it may some∣what benefit. I therefore beseech your good Honour and reuerend Paternitie, be∣ing a most godly and vigilant Watchman ouer vs all, to patronize this my Doctrine of warchfulnesse, and to take in good part my endeuours therin: hoping that it may make many waking, and looking for the Lords second comming to their saluation. So cra∣uing your Honourable fauour herein, I humbly take my leaue: Resting (as dutie bindeth me) your Honours poore Minister vnder God, in all Christian dutie to bee or∣dered and commanded:
