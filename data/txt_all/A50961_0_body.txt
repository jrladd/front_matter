RIGHT HONORABLE:
THis Sermon of right belongeth to you, being by your appointment Preacht; as therefore rivers
runne to the sea from whence they flow; so this returnes to your Ho∣nour from whence it
sprang. Be∣sides, It is yours (my Lord) by a due debt for many fa∣vours received, for which,
having no other way to ex∣presse my thankfulnesse, I commend this poore service of
a verball but hearty acknowledgement for reall cour∣tesies. Lastly, your wise
wielding of the Sword you have borne, having drawne the hearts and voyces of the best towards
you, hath also induced mee to this De∣dication; wherein as others may see what you have been,
so your worthy Successour may see what he should be; It was once mine, it is now yours,
and so is
MY LORD,
