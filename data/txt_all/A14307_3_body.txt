Right Honourable:
SO infinite is Loue in operation, and so forcible are the faculties of the Soule, as beside mute respects of dutie and seruice, they will neuer rest without reall remonstrance of actuall fruites, which I (my right noble Lord) hauing beene an indiuiduall ap∣pendant of your no lesse noble Mothers house and name, and a religious obseruant of your owne heroique and hopefull vertues, from your Cradle, do humbly present as a tribute of my deuotion, to your fauourable entertainment and protection, these few Songs, whereof some were composed in your tender yeares, and in your most worthy Fathers house, (from whom, and your most honourable Mother, for many yeares I receiued part of my meanes and liuelyhoode) which hath the rather emboldened mee, with many other more neere re∣spects, to intreat your Honour to let them passe vnder your gracious fauour, as the most noble and truest fauourite of this our too much vnrespected quality. This is but a small testimony to paralell the proportion of my minde in this kinde, or any other seruice which my faculty and fortune are any way able to affoord: But knowing your honoura∣ble disposition to accept the meanest seruice proceeding from so loyall and faithfull a heart, I make no doubt of your Lordships acceptation. On which hope relying, with all humility crauing pardon for my bold presumption, I present them, and will euer pray to God for your health, honour, and happinesse, and rest, great Marquesse
