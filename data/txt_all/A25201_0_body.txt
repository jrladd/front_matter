SIR,
WHen you pleased to lay this piece of Service upon me, of Preaching at the Assizes, I bethought my self how to discourse seasonably and pro∣fitably, under the present State of Affairs, and at such a general Assembly of the Country; and soon came to a Resolution, That to oppose something, what my poor Talent could furnish out, against the spread∣ing of an Epidemical Evil, too visible upon us, could not be an improper Ʋndertaking: And certainly he is but an ill Member of the Publick, who at the time when a dangerous Fire appears breaking out, will not bring his Bucket to the quenching of it. If any shall except against my medling with Political Matters in the Pulpit, they ought to reflect, how our People are of late made all Statesmen; and that to treat them as such at some times, is become necessary to their Edification. In the Publick Places of Conversation you shall have the Men of Trade arrogate as much Knowledge of Politicks now, as heretofore their Re∣presentatives
could arrive unto: So that what is here touched upon as to these Matters, is no ways meant ad Magistratum; I presume not to instruct them therein; but ad Populum still: And to rectifie some Notions in them, which might have a mischievous In∣fluence upon Christian Practice, I trust, will not be thought forreign to the Business of a Divine. The Sermon hapned to find a favourable Reception with its Audience, and I never intended it should have gone further; but some, whose Judgments I ought to subscribe unto, thought it might be more serviceable, if made more publick; and others, whose Authority I shall never disobey, were with some Importunities de∣sirous to have it so: And these are the true Causes of this Publication; whereof I need not inform you, Sir, who your self are my best Voucher to the World, for the Reality of this whole Matter. And now, Sir, it begs leave to come forth under the shelter of your Name, not only for the common Reason of such De∣dications, but chiefly because the subject Matter and Design of this Discourse requires the Protection of one like your self, whose clear and disinteressed Zeal for the Publick is so exemplary among us. And then the many Favours which I have received from you, bind me to all Opportunities of Gratitude, and to own it to the World how much I am,
