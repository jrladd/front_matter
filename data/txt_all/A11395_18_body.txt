VRANIA (noblest of the learned NINE)
Coming from Heav'n, to cal my Muse from Earth,
From Loves loose Sonnets, and lasciuious Mirth;
In sacred WEEKS to sing the Works diuine:
Of all the Nimphs extract from mortall Ligne,
For sweet Companion picks you onely forth
(As best resembling her self's grace and worth)
Deer Beauties best, Wits wonder, Vertue's shrine.
Sweet, heav'nly temper of a humane soule
(Whose louely smiles set coldest hearts a-fire;
But, instantly, with modest brows controule
Th' aspiring hope of any bold desire)
Daign t'entertain in your milde gracefull manner
This Heav'nly Mayd, the mirrour of your Honour.
