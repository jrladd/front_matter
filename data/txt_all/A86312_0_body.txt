REVEREND SIR,
OF those Truths you have fre∣quently delivered to us, this one, which you preached to our eares upon that happy and joy∣ous day of his MAJESTIES Coronation, which is not of the smallest concernment, a Truth, which with the KING hath been an Exile, and banisht both the Pulpit and the Presse in this Land for many yeares to∣gether; but since both are returned together home; the one to the Throne, the other to the Pulpit; the one Crowned, the other preached,
 both on a day; we judged it worthy the Press, whereby it might better manifest it self to the world, that as at the Presence and Sight of his Maiesties Sacred Person, all his ene∣mies flie and fall before him, so at the ap∣proach of this light, the grosse mists of er∣rors and contrary tenents, which have pos∣sessed this Island of late yeares, might be dis∣pelled and utterly confounded. Necessary also we judged it, in respect of us sonnes of the Church of England, to vindicate our selves, that though darkness might cover the surface of our Church, and seize upon some persons, yet we still kept this light within us unex∣tinct, the doctrine of our Church we still re∣tain, and we who are souldiers will fight for his Majestie, in defence thereof to the last drop of our blood, nor was it fit the Herauld and Proclaimer of this doctrine should be concealed and unknown, therefore passeth it under your name, Pardon us wherein we have acted without full directions from you, it was
 our love and zeal to the Truth, and to you the Preacher of it, that caused this forward∣nesse in us. Sir, the Town ingeneral, we more particularly who were further Actors in the solemnization of the day, are obliged to you for your great paines: And to testifie our gratitude for so great a favour, thought good to send them both together abroad into the World, your paines, with our unfeined thanks affixed thereto, who in the name of our selves, and the rest of our souldiers under our Command, do subscribe ourselves
SIR,

Manchester May 11. 1661.
