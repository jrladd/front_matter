TO MY HONOVRABLE FRIEND, SR. THOMAS MOVNSON, KNIGHT AND BARONET.
SInce now those clouds, that lately ouer-cast
Your Fame and Fortune, are disperst at last:
And now since all to you fayre greetings make,
Some out of loue, and some for pitties sake:
Shall I but with a common stile salute
Your new enlargement? or stand onely mute?
I, to whose trust and care you durst commit
Your pined health, when Arte despayr'd of it?
I, that in your affliction often view'd
In you the fruits of manly fortitude,
Patince, and euen constancie of minde,
That Rocke-like stood, and scorn'd both waue, and winde?
Should I for all your ancient loue to me▪
Endow'd with waighty fauours, silent be?
Your merits, and my gratitude forbid
That eyther should in Lethean Gulfe lye hid
But how shall I this worke of fame expree?
How can I better, after pensiuenesse,
Then with light straynes of Musicke, made to moue
Sweetly with the wide-spreading plumes of loue?
These youth-borne Ayres then, prison'd in this Booke,
VVhich in your Bowres much of their beeing tooke,
Accept as a kinde offring from that hand
VVhich ioyn'd with heart your vertue may command.
VVho loue a sure friend as all good men doe,
Since such you are, let those affect you to:
And may the ioyes of that Crowne neuer end,
That innocence doth pitty, and defend.—
