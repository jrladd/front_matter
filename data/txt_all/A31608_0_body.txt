My Lord,
THE Honour that I have
had of your Lordships most
obliging Kindness and Fa∣vour,
in your Travels abroad, hath
animated me humbly to beg your Lord∣ships
Patronage over these my first
Fruits; not that by this Enchiridion,
or small Pocket-book, I pretend to add
any thing to the Knowledge of a Per∣son,
who before he had attained to the
Age of thirteen Years, et Mores
Hominum multorum vidit, et Ur∣bes;

and who now at the Age of
twenty, is endowed with so much
Judgment, Wisdom and Discretion, as
appears every day, my Lord, by your
eminent Service towards your King,
and Country, in a most diligent and
dextrous administration of Justice:
Not (I say) that this Epitome of
Geography can add to your Lordships
Knowledge; but only, that when your
Lordships Illustrious Name shall ap∣pear
in the Front hereof, it may the
sooner encourage the young Nobility
and Gentry of this Nation, to make
use of it; which is the main Aim of,
MY LORD,
