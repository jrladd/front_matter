A Approued Friends, this Play, which know at first was not design'd to tra∣uell so farre as the common Stage, is now prest for a greater iourney, al∣most without my knowledge; and to giue some stop to preiudicate opinions, which may hap∣pily arise from the Authors knowne want of Learning, I am bold to say you both approued the Plot and Language; for your abilities to iudge, I held them so great, and belieue the world did so to, that your approbation to this, hath made me against the opinion euen of ma∣ny friends, continue to wast more paper. If yee then flatter'd, or were loth to discourage mee in this way, which few delight to practice, though most to see and censure, yee are iustly punisht now when ye expect it not, in being chosen Pa∣trons of what's presented to you thus plainly by your Seruant.
