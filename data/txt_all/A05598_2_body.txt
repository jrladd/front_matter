MOST Mightie Monarch, of Great Britanes Yle,
Vouchsafe to looke on this small Mite I bring;
VVhich prostrate comes, cled in a barren style,
To Thee, O Kinglie Poet! Poets King.
And if one gracious looke, fall from thy face,
O then my Muse, and I, finde life, and grace.


Euen as the Sunne-shine, of the new-borne Day,
From Thetis watrie trembling Caue appeares,
To decke the lowring Leaues in fresh Array,
VVhich sable Night, inuolues in frozen Feares:
And Elitropian-like, display their Beautie,
Unto their Soueraigne Phoebe, as bound by duetie.


So Thou th'Aurore, of my prodigious Night,
Lendes Breath vnto my long-worne wearie Strife:
And from thy Beames, my Darknesse borrowes light,
To cheare the Day, of my desired Life.
So Great Apollo, as thou shin'st, so fauour,
That I, mongst thousands, may Thy Goodnesse fauour.


Great Pious Paterne, Patrone of Thine owne,
This rauisht Age, admires Thy Vertuous VVayes:
VVhose Princelie Actes, Remotest partes haue knowne,
And wee liue happie, in Thine happie Dayes.
Thy VVisdome, Learning, Gouernment, and Care,
None can expresse, their Merites as they are.
Long mayst Thou raigne, and long may GOD aboue,
Confirme Thine Heart, in Thy Great Kinglie Loue.
