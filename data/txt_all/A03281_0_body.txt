WHen I remember the times and furtherances of my education, and consider with my selfe by whose free choise, I was preferred into that worthy societie (the head-ship whereof your worship hath so many yeares enioyed) I cannot but say to you as Hierome did to a freind of his, Tibi & quod possū debeo,Hiero. Sephron. & quod non possum: I am indebted to you both to the vtmost extent of my a∣bility, and in much more then I can performe. Giue me leaue there∣fore (I beseech you) not as by way of requitall (for I will not so much either vnder-value your fauour, or abridge my debt) but as by way of acknowledgement (leauing this, as it were a bill of my hand what I haue receiued, and how deepely I am engaged) to pre∣sent you with these three sermons. They are of the Dignitie of the scripture, and therefore (their subiect considered) are not vnworthy your patronage, being so auncient and so indicious a professour of Theologie. The manner of handling, because, as it is liable to cen∣sure in this taxing age, so it may perhaps through my want either of skill or care deserue reproofe, therefore I doe submit it wholly to your worships triall, that after, it may either step further into pub∣like view, or els stop where it is, according as you shall please to dis∣pose. How soeuer it be, albeit I must confesse, that I should much re∣ioyce in your approouing furtherance, yet at the least I shall herein find contentment, that I haue endeuoured out of my vnfained sen∣siblenes of your worships respectiue kindnesse, to make the world a witnes of my thankefullnes. And so in the fulnes of my desire, that he in whom all Fulnes dwelleth may so replenish you with spirituall blessings in heauenly things,Col. 1.19. Eph. 1.3. Psa. 92.13.14. that like the Trees planted in the house of the Lord, you may still euen in your Age bring forth fruit, and be fatte & flourishing, I humbly take my leaue.
