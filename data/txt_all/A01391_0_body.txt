Right Honorable,
ALthough such Ladies as your selfe, are either compared to rich Caskets, contai∣ning within thē more richer Ie∣wels, or resem∣bled to precious Diamonds, made the more glorious by

enameling, and the cunning of the work∣man: yet, I protest, beeing an eye-witnesse of your constant resort vnto wisedomes Feast; and apprehensiue, that you loue Re∣ligion meerely for Gods loue: that alone hath incited mee to select you the Patro∣nesse of this Discourse, whereby, I make no doubt, you shall not onely runne with Zacheus to the top of a Figge-tree to be∣hold IESVS: but bee glad in your very soule, that your foot-steps are fixed in the way of saluation, and that you are now going on in the path, that will conduct you to new Ierusalem.
The Worke it selfe is the Discouery of the vnswept corners of Popish Monaste∣ries: The Instrument wherewith it is done, though it bee not the Prophets Lanterne and Candle to search the great Citie: yet it is the opening of a Booke, wherein you may reade such loathsome particulars against Papistry, that in your friends be∣halfe, you will doe, as wee were wont to doe in England, euen spit at the naming of the Diuell: and in your owne, lift vp

your hands to Heauen with thanksgiuing, that God hath blessed you with a better knowledge.
The Author, is I confesse, no Diuine, but a penitent sinner, and one that would faine striue to be a doore-keeper in the House of GOD, who hath taken this mercy vpon him, to welcome him home with better acates, then to feed with the Hogges at the troughs: My name you shall sure finde at the last, which if it carry an vnpleasant ac∣cent, oh bee thus honourable, to admit of one good qualitie, as the mirrour of his time Sir Philip Sidney was wont to say. For a great many haue none, and no man hath all.
Your Honors humbly deuoted,
T. G.
