NO lesse then a yeare
and a halfe is past
(Reuerend, Deare,
and holy Mother)
since I wrote a lo∣uing
monitory letter
to two of thine vn∣worthy
Sons; which
(I heard) were fled from thee in person, in af∣fection,
and somewhat in opinion: Supposing
them yet thine in the maine substance, though in

some circumstances their owne. Since which, one
of them hath wash't of thy Font-water as vn∣clean,
and hath written desperately both against
thee, and his owne fellowes: From the other, I re∣ceiued
(not two moneths since) a stomakful Pam∣phlet;
besides the priuate iniuries to the monitor,
casting vpon thine honourable name blasphe∣mos
imputations of Apostasie, Antichristianisme,
Whoordome, Rebellion: Mine owne wronges I
could haue contemned in silence,Meam iniuri∣am patiētertuli impietatem contra Spōsam Christi ferre non potui. Hier ad Vigilant. but, For Sions
sake, I cannot hold my peace: If I remember not
thee, O Ierusalem, let my tongue cleaue to the
roofe of my mouth. It were a shame, and sinne
for me, that myzeale should be lesse hote for thine
innocency, then theirs to thy false disgrace. How
haue I hastened therefore to let the world see thy
sincere truth, and their peruerse slanders. Vnto
thy sacred name then (whereto I haue in all piety
deuoted my selfe) I humbly present this my spee∣dy
and dutifull labour: whereby I hope thy weak
Sonnes may be confirmed, the strong encouraged,
the rebellious shamed: And if any shall still ob∣stinately
accurse thee, I referre their reuenge vn∣to
thy Glorious Head, who hath espoused thee to
himselfe, in trueth and righteousnesse: Let him
whose thou art, right thee: In the meane time,

we thy true sonnes, shall not onely defend, but
magnifie thee: Thou maiest be blacke, but thou
art comely: the Daughters haue seene thee, and
counted thee blessed; euen the Queene, and the
Concubines, and they haue praised thee: thou art
thy Welbelouedst, and his desire is towards thee:
So let it be, and so let thine be towards him
for euer; and mine towards you
both, who am the least of
all thy little ones,
