I Dedicate this Book to For∣tune, for I believe she is a powerfull Princess; for what∣soever she favours, the World admires, whether it be worthy of admiration, or no; and whatsoever she frowns on, the World runns from, as from a Plaguy Infection, and not only shunns, but exclaims against it, although it be Vir∣tue herself; and that which is most to be lamented, is, that the strictest Votresses to Virtue turn Reprobates, become Infidels, and with false and superstious Devotion worship the Golden Fortune; and Flat∣terers, which are the Priests, offer false Praises thereunto.

Wherefore if Fortune please, with her helping hand, she may place my Book in Fames high Tow'r, where every Word, like a Cymball, shall make a Tinkling Noise; and the whole Volume, like a Cannon Bul∣let, shall Eccho from Side to Side of Fames large Brasen Walls, and make so loud a Report, that all the World shall hear it.

But if not favour'd, then my Book must dye,
And in the Grave of Dark Oblivion lye:
