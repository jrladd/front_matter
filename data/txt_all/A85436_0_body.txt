I Here present you with one piece of the
Counsels of God, next those of his
disposing the eternall conditions of per∣sons
of all other the greatest, as which con∣cerneth
the temporall salvation or destruction
of Kingdomes and Nations, which next to his Saints
therein, are dearest to God, as his patience towards
them shews. A subject, which had it been set out accor∣ding

undone without you, nor you without failing in this,
which is our GREATEST INTEREST. An Errour,
which if this Kingdome should after so much bleeding
erre a second time, is like hereafter never to be men∣ded.
Your preservation and guidance in this, is,
above all other, the constant and daily prayer of
