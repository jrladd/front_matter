Madam,
I Present your Grace here with a
Testimony of my Obedience,
and of your own Zeal for the
good of Souls. You were in
your great Charity, not only
pleased to pardon the weakness
of this Discourse, but to hope it
might serve as a memorial to those that need it, of
the great necessity of living Vertuously, and by the
measures of Christianity. Madam, you are too great
and too good to have any ambition for the things of
this World; but I cannot but observe that in your
designs for the other World, you, by your Charity
and Zeal, adopt your self into the portion of those
Ecclesiasticks, who humbly hope, and truly labour
for the reward that is promised to those wise persons
who convert souls, if our Prayers and your Desires
that every one should be profited in their eternal
concerns, cast in a Symbol towards this great work,
and will give you a title to that great reward: But,

Madam, when I received your Commands for di∣spersing
some Copies of this Sermon, I perceived it
was too little to be presented to your Eminence; and
if it were accompanied with something else of the like
nature, it might with more profit advance that end
which your Grace so piously designed; and there∣fore
I have taken this opportunity to satisfie the de∣sire
of some very Honourable and very Reverend
Personages, who required that the two following Ser∣mons
should also be made fit for the use of those who
hoped to receive profit by them. I humbly lay them
all at your Graces Feet, begging of God, that even
as many may receive advantages by the perusing of
them, as either your Grace will desire, or he that
preached them did intend. And if your Grace will
accept of this first Testimony of my concurrence with
all the World that know you, in paying those great
regards, which your Piety so highly merits, I will
endeavour hereafter in some greater instance to pur∣sue
the intentions of Your zeal of souls, and by such
a service endeavour to do more benefit to others, and
by it, as by that which is most acceptable to your
Grace, endear the Obedience and Services of,
Madam,
