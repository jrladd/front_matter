THere are three things, which, if univer∣sally conjoyn'd, would certainly make this Nation happy: The just Awe and Reverence of the Divine Nature: Loyalty to the King, God's immediate Vice-gerent upon Earth: And the due Execution of Justice, for the terror of evil doers, and the praise of them that do well. The first would make them good Christians; the second would make them good Subjects; and the third, would either perswade, or force them to be good Men. In order to the attaining of these ends, I have made it my business, ac∣cording to my slender capacity, to evidence that there is a God, who ruleth over the highest; and that He is so far graciously pleased to promote the good of Humane society, as to make Govern∣ment his own Ordinance; that they, who are

Subjects, are bound to be obedient, and loyal, by God's authority; and that they, who re∣present our gracious Sovereign in the high seats of Judicature, are obliged to fidelity, by the greatest Commands and Encouragements.
SIR, being selected, by Your undeserved fa∣vour, to be your Chaplain, at this remarkable time, I was perswaded, that I could no way better publish the true sentiments of your Loy∣al heart, or discharge my Own Duty, than by endeavouring to instill into the minds of my Auditory these weightier matters of the Royal Law. If I have, in the least degree, promoted the Honour of God, and the King; satisfied your Self; confirmed any true Christians in their just sentiments; and convinced, or confuted any seditious, Anarchical spirits; I have com∣passed my end, shall give God the glory, and remain,
Honoured SIR,
