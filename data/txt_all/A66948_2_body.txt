BOldly have I presumed (Right Worshipful Members of this Ho nourable City) to publish unto the Eyes of the World, your late

laudable Work, which not only beauti∣fied this City, but the whole Realm of England. Rare was the Sight, great was the Cost, yet greater your good Wills; the Report whereof will be in memory while London lasteth. Now seeing no man taketh in hand to describe the same as it deserved, and pitying greatly it should lye hid∣den, I considered that blind Bayard oft times seemeth boldest, and there∣upon my self (though least able of all other) have presumed, under your Correction, to publish the Truth of what I noted in the Train: Therein purposing, that though to your own Ears it bringeth no matter of De∣light, yet the Truth of this seemly Show (which Fame hath far spread abroad) may through this Realm be expressed; as also left in Remem∣brance unto your Childrens Children, and their Posterity after them: Be∣seeching therefore that your Wise∣domes

would accept my good Will, for which I remain thankful during my Life.
