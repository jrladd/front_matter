HIt is and of longe tyme hath bene my well be∣loued
syster a custome in the begynnynge of ye
newe yere frendes to sende betwene presentes or gyf∣tes
/ as the wytnesses of theyr loue and frendeshyp &
also sygnyfyenge that they desyre eche to other that
yere a good contynuance and prosperous ende of that
lucky bygynnynge. But communely all those presen∣tes
that are vsed customably all in this maner betwe¦ne
frendes to be sente: be suche thynges as pertayne
onely vnto the body eyther to be fed or to be cledde or
some otherwyse delyted: by whiche hit semeth that
theyr frendshyp is but flesshely & stretcheth in maner
to the body onely. But for asmoche as the loue & amy∣te
of chrysten folke sholde be rather goosty frendshyp
then bodely: syth yt all faythfull people are rather spy∣rituall
then carnall. For as hapostle seyth we be not
now in flesshe but in spyryte yf chryste abyde in vs. I
therfore myne hertly beloued syster in good lucke of
this newe yere haue sent you suche a present as maye
bere wytnes of my tendre loue & zele to the happy con¦tynuaunce
and gracyouse encreace of vertue in your
soule: and where as the giftes of other folke declare y•
they wyssheth theyr frends to be worldly fortunate
myne testyfyeth y• I desyre to haue you godly {pro}spe∣rous.
These werkes more {pro}fitable then large were
made ī laten by one Iohn̄ pic{us} erle of mirādula a lord¦shyp
in Italy of whose connynge & tue e nede here

nothinge to speke for asmoche as here after we peruse
the course of his hole lyfe rather after our lytel power
slenderly then after his merites suffyciētly. The wer¦kes
are suche that truely good syster I suppose of the
quantyte there cometh none in your hande more pro∣fitable:
neyther to thachyuynge of temperaunce in {pro}∣sperite
/ nor to ye purchasynge of pacience in aduersite
/ nor to the dyspysynge of worldly vanyte / nor to the de¦syrynge
of heuenly felycyte / whiche werkes I wolde
requyre you gladly to receyue: ne were hit yt they b¦suche
that for the goodly mater (how so euer they b¦trāslated)
may delyte & please ony persone that hathe
ony meane desyre and loue to god. And that your selfe
is suche one as for your vertue and feruent zele to god
can not but ioyously receyue ony thynge that meane∣ly
sowneth eyther to the reproche of vyce commenda∣cyon
of vertue or honoure and laude of god who pre∣serue
you:
