HAving heard you take pleasure som∣times to read some poor Writings of mine which have bin made publike to the
World, I have thought good to make one Writing proper to your ; at least, for which (if it be worth the thankes) the world shall thanke you, for being pub∣like; For, but for your sakes, and for testifying my love to you both, I had never, I thinke, had a thought of writing it. God hath bles∣sed you with a numerous is∣sue, as though he meant, for every one of your vertues, to
bestow upon you a childe; and if, the fuller ones Quiver is of such Arrowes,  happier he is; I may justly, with David, pronounce you a payre, that have as few your matches in happinesse, as in vertue. When I intended to write somthing to the memo∣ry of your Names, because I knew the seriousnesse of your dispositions, and how farre you are from taking pleasure in vaine discourses; I made
choyce of an Argument, of all other the most serious: for, what so serious, as the im∣mortality of the soule? Of which, though wee have Di∣vine Testimonies, farre more forcible then any Humane Reasons can be; yet it gives a kinde of satisfaction, to see Divine certainties seconded by Humane probabilities, and Faith by Reason; For though Divine proofes be more pro∣portionable to the stronger
part of the Minde; yet na∣turall reasons make a greater impression in the weaker part; at least, both of them running one way, and ma∣king both but one current; it cannot be denyed them, to make the beliefe, as Vis uni∣ta, the stronger. Accept it then, most Honoured Brother & sister, with the like affecti∣on as I offer it, and let him at least have some place in your respects, who so much respects
you both; as professing al∣wayes to continue,
