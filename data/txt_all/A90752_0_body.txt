WHereas I am confi∣dent, that this Hono∣rable Court will lay the Corner Stone of the worlds happinesse before the final recesse thereof, I have adventured to cast in my widowes mite into the Treasurie; not as an Instructer, or Counsellour, to this Honourable Assembly, but have

delivered my conceptions in a Ficti∣on, as a more mannerly way, having for my pattern Sir Thomas Moore, and Sir Francis Bacon once Lord Chancellour of England; and hum∣bly desire that this honourable As∣sembly will be pleased to make use of any thing therein contained, if it may stand with their pleasures, and to laugh at the rest, as a solace to my minde, being enclined to doe good to the publick. So humbly craving leave, that I may take my leave, I rest this 25. of October 1641.
