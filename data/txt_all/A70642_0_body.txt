I Had no sooner en∣gaged my thoughts in the following Narrative, but I judged it worthy of your Lordships view; and my Concern in it, your Prote∣ction. Besides, at what Altar could I more reasonably make tender of this humble Sacrifice, but where I had already made Oblation of my self? Or to whom should I more properly expose the great Atchieve∣ments of others, than to Him whose Courage and Civility are such, that both Peace and War seem equal Rivals for his Fame?

I had large room in the last Sum∣mers Expedition to contemplate the greatness of your Mind, and the Ho∣nour of your Nature; for I obser∣ved such generous impatience in you before the Fights, so much Va∣lour, and Conduct, and Temper in them, and such care and pity for the hurt and unfortunate after them, that I reverenced and admired so many Virtues in one Person.
These are the steps, my Lord, by which your Ancestors entred into the Temple of Honour. Thus has the Splendor of your House for so many Ages been upheld. And in what Firmament does there now shine a more Illustrious Star? Con∣tinue then to be propitious to the Nation, and kind unto
My Lord,
