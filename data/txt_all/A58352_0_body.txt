NOthing is more just then the Dedi∣cating
this following Paper to you:
neither could any consideration oblige
me to forbear it: and even whilst it
seeks a shade, it yet desires so illustrious
a patronage. What ever censure it re∣ceives
in the world, will soon be forgot
in the kindness you will shew it; and the
favour of so excellent a Person, will
sufficiently reinforce it against all the
assaults of custome and prejudice. And
in the privacies where we now are, I
may assume the liberty to say, we are the
votaries of the neglected Theme; and
acknowledge the Divinity of that Altar
which the Irreligion of the Age has a∣bandoned:
all our regret is the difficul∣ty
we have found in making that sacri∣fice,

which is now esteemed the degene∣rate
Devotion of the World. Though
Vertue has lost its Traine, yet it re∣ceives
the most obsequious respect from
us; and it has not been our hearts but
our conditions, that have refused its
conduct in the track of Ages. We are
not yet become Atheists to a Hymen,
nor deserters of a fidelity which is loa∣den
with reproaches: Neither do we
recount these things in a shade, because
we blush to avow them in the Sun beams.
No Antonia, we have deposited those
resolutions in faithful assurances, which
we would at any time be willing to lay
out for so fair a purchase: in which al∣so
we have preserved our Vertue, like
snow, that's in cold houses saved from
the Estive seasons of a rageing vice:
the age has no propitious sentiments
from us, nor do we valew the reproach of
being singular in our vertue, the anci∣ent
Idea's, though the world may pre∣tend
they are faded, are yet more char∣ming
to us, then the gayness of their

present Images: All their Paint and
imbellishments cannot enamour us on
these; nor has the dirt they have
flung upon the former, prevented us
from admiring an unequall'd beauty
in them. We have given them the As∣cendant
of our soules; and they have
fashion'd there that fidelity and justice,
which will be for ever the ornament of
our breasts: neither do those qualities
appear less fair and agreeable to us,
whilst their habilements are out of mode.
Now the popular fury and practise has
proscribed a vertuous love, it receives
a protection in our hearts; and we can
boast, that it shall never be refin'd but
with our lives: we are sorry to give
it no larger a Territory; and we
would gladly lead it farther into the
affairs of our lives: we are not stopped
in thse designes by the Platonick pre∣caution,
nor a fear to try our Idaeas by
action: we have took other measures of
a just and happy life: and prefer the
example of generous Ages, before the

fictions of Romance: tis not because we
love their beautifull wanderings, that
we are kept in a perplexing Labyrinth,
and know not how to come at what we
love; Since it is not our humours, but
our affairs, conceale the Clue. In the
mean time, our inclinations and our
wishes will appear a justice to that de∣sign;
and a respect to the memory of
our Fathers: Nay, we rather see our
selves deprived of some of the felicities,
then cut off from the generuos inte∣rests
of that State: we have erected vo∣tive
Altars to Hymen; and pay the
more disinterested part of the Devo∣tion:
our Piety has nothing in it of
Mercenary, whilst the mind is the on∣ly
Devote. We have surpassed the
Poetick Chymaera's, by a truth that has
out done their Fables; and yet that
passion which has equal'd their flights,
shall ever keep it self above those loath∣some
places where they rest their Geni∣nius:
it is not grown giddy by the
height; nor will its flight ever become

the Paecipice of its ruine. No An∣tonia,
we have alwayes maintained the
limits of Fidelity, and Iustice; nor can
we ever allow our love that fatal Sove∣reignty,
as to be above the Laws of our
Vertue. We have seen too much of their
misfortune, who assist a Tyrannick
Passion; whilst they unhappily help it to
acquire, a Felicity and Grandeur, to
which it mounts on the ruines of their
Repose and Honour: in our united
hearts our Love has room enough to reign;
and the management of those just affairs
will allow it no leisure for Ambition. I
have entertained you Antonia, in a
manner unusual: but it cannot appear
unhandsome to the Age, since it is
but to imitate their divertisments in
Mascarade. And to the rest, it will
only show a covetousness like to
theirs, who hoarded under ground
their Treasures; esteeming that
to be yet their VVealth, which
they did not dare to own. And
we have moreover, exceeded their

felicity; who have on wounded
Trees, or Marble, saught an
immortality for their Love: since we
have now committed ours to more per∣petual
abiding Letters; and though we
have set it in a shade, and a Chara∣cter
unknown, yet we will expect that
propitious time, that shall both reveal,
and interpret it.
