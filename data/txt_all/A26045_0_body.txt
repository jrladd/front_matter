ALbeit (Right Worship∣full) there be more es∣sential natures contai∣ned in each part both of this Macrocosme, and Microcosme, existing in their absolute being, than the understan∣ding of man can fully apprehend; yet I doubt not, but those which may with labour and diligence be known, & those also which of ingenious spirits and no∣table wits have been invented, and by them artificially & methodically taught, (tending not onely to manifest profit in

the Common-wealth, but also to the great increase and setting forth of Gods divine power, wisdome, goodnesse, pro∣vidence, and increase of Virtue ought of all men to be imbraced, (and especially of those which have any government, publike charge, or authority in the Com∣mon wealth.) In regard that the neerer men approach to such excellent Ver∣tues, the neerer (without doubt) do they come unto goodnesse, to felicyty, and to God himselfe. Hence saith the Prophet (unto men seated in eminent places) Dixi vos dii estis, so that those which ei∣ther through arrogance, or ignorance deride, and contemne those Arts (which with great dexterity, care, and industry have bin found out, and left unto us by the love of our Predecessors) doe both offer contempt unto the goodnesse of God, and do much endamage and anoy all humane society. So on the contrary part, they that do by all means further

those so profitable Disciplines doe both render true honour unto GOD, and do greatly advance the good of the Com∣mon-wealth wherin they live. Now in regard there is no study (Divinitie ex∣cepted) wherein the wit of man may be better employed then in the motion of the stars, and in the knowledge of their situation, place, and being, together with their wonderfull effects: In regard wherof I was incited to imploy some of my time in the study therof, and at last considering that of the Orator, that Non solum nobis nati sumus, &c. We are not born for our selves onely, but our friends challenge a part in us, and our Countries come in for a share, especially those honours and graces of our Coun∣trey, those that traffique in the deepe, and have their businesse in the great waters, those that are unto this Island as a wood∣den wall, the Sea-chariots, and the hor∣ses of England: these, I say, may claime

justly to the fruits of our labours, what∣soever they be which have not altoge∣ther been abhorrent from the Mathe∣maticall studies: considering this, I could do no lesse than bring in this my mite into their treasury, and Si quid Ars mea efficere possit, (if my skill can stand them in any stead) to further that so much deserving Science of Navigation. Accept therefore, I beseech you, this yong sonne of my studies, this little handfull of paper, wherin is contained not Anacreons wanton Odes, or Ovids lascivious Elegies, the incendiaries of lust, but a pure spark of chast Vestalfire, a small part of the Mathematicks dedi∣cated from a serviceable affection to your VVorships, that under the shield of your protections it may live secure, from the desperate stab of of criticall persons, and envious spirits, who not onely like snarling Satyres deride and contemne those so liberall Sciences, but

swallow up with despite (if it were pos∣sible) the professours thereof. For rescue from such malignant spirits my Book flies to the shadow of your favour, which if you shall afford unto it, my labours shall be all sacrificed unto you, and I rest.
