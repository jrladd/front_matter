May it please your Lordship.
THE Design of these Papers being for the Glory of the King, and the Peace of the Church, we cannot think it dishonourable for any person of moderate Incli∣nations, and in a capacity to serve so good an end, to favour it. Your Lordship therefore being at pre∣sent at the Helme in the Admini∣stration of the greatest Affairs, will not, as we hope, receive with any Disdaine this our humble De∣dication.
Not that we concerne your Lordship in our little Contests, as the Book is Controversal, for we know Themistocles cannot fiddle, but he can govern a State: but because
the Thing Designed is so momentous, and concerns Statesmen, such as your Lordship is.
We do intend, no further avocation of your Honour from your other Imployment, than to look over onely the Preface, and the last Half Sheet of the Book: wherein you will find a Founda∣tion laid, and Materials made rea∣dy. There is wanting onely the Perfecting skill of some Master buil∣der, and then Hands to work.
We are sensible of the Meanness of such an Offering to so great and judicious a Person; and being con∣scious that the blame which we de∣serve upon that account is too much for One, there are Two of us to bear it.
