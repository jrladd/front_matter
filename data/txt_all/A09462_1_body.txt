RIght Honorable, in the former
 is the combat of Christ:
in this latter is set downe the
combat of a Christian. He that
fought with our head, will fight
with the members▪ and he that assaulted Christ,
will assaile all Christians. But Christ did beare
troubles, and was borne out of them: we must
haue troubles, and shall be borne out of them. If
our afflictions were plagues, as to the Egyptians:
curses, as to Cham: destruction, as to Sodome:
desolation, as to Israel: then had we cause to flie
from them, as Moses did from that miraculous
serpent. But since they are but the trials of faith,
corrections of a father, visitations from the Bi∣shop
of our soules: since they are as Phlebotomie
to a Pleurisie, and a purgation to a Plethora,

they are to be endured with all patience. How
Christ did endure them, you may reade in that
Treatise: how a Christian must, you may see in
this. The former Treatise I presented to your
honorable brother: this latter to you most hono∣rable
sisters. I desired to annex this to the former
discourse, because it is sutable to that present ar∣gument:
and I know not to whom I may better
present it, then to you who haue experience of this
Christian warfare. If it please you but to reade
these holy meditations, and to entertaine this
poore mite into your rich treasury by the reading
I doubt not but you shal haue much comfort; and
by your entertaining, the church shal haue much
good. Now that good God who hath giuen your
mind to know him, giue you also an heart to lo
him: and as you are Honorable in the eyes of this
world, so he make you most honorable in the eyes
of his Maiestie. And thus crauing pardon, I
commit you to the grace of that God, who will
honor them that loue him, and comfort them
that seeke comfort from him.
