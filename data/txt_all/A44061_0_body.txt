May it please your GRACE,
THe neer alliance between DIVI∣NITY
and MEDICINE, whose
relation is as intimate as the Uni∣on
of SOUL and BODY, hath setled such a
Sympathy in both Professions, that they ne∣cessarily
partake of the Infelicity and Pro∣sperity
happening to each other; and thence

it was, that when the REVEREND CLER∣GY
(during the late Rebellion) suffered
according to their sworn Enemies implaca∣ble
Fury, the Professors of PHYSICK al∣so
by the prevailing Invasion of Empericks
shared in the common Calamity; and since
not without a Miracle that Storm is over,
and the GOD OF ORDER hath moved up∣on
our CHAOS, so that the Heavens are
divided from the Earth, and our STARS
shine in their proper Spheres, yeilding
continually Influential Vertues in good
measure to dispose the Feculencies below in∣to
a compliance with their refining Effica∣cies:
I say, since the Restitution of our
RELIGION and CLERGY, Physicians do
justly congratulate the Success of both, and
most heartily wish that the CHURCH may
never fall again into the hands of Empiri∣cal
Divines who as rudely treated peoples
Souls, as the present Quacks in Physick do
their Bodies, their crude and extemporary
Effusions directly answering the others un∣skilful
and dangerous Medicaments.

And although the condition of Physick
and Physicians is very little bettered, as
if it were to be quite excluded from the be∣nefits
of the PUBLICK DELIVERANCE,
yet we despair not by reason particularly of
your GRACES Readiness and Zeal to
Patronize LEARNING, that the Profes∣sion
of PHYSICK and legitimate Physi∣cians
will after a long Confusion be sepa∣rated
and distinguished from the Dregs of
illiterate Practisers: Such it seems is the
boldness both of our common Empericks and
upstart Pseudochymists, that they presume
to entertain as great hopes of their pre∣vailing
over all ACADEMICKS, as the
CHURCHES Enemies impatiently expect
a Revolution, but I trust GOD ALMIGHTY
in his Providence will utterly disappoint
both; 'tis in the mean time our Advantage
that some of our highest pretending Adver∣saries
have made addresses to your GRACE,
whose Judgment we esteem as the Grand
Test to discover all those Fallacies both in
Books and Men, which by reason of their

cunning Adulteration pass currantly with
others; but so soon as their Mercurial Tin∣cture
is evaporated, the remain will appear
to be only Lead or some base Mettal.
Because Your GRACE and many other
Persons of great Honor and Worth do ap∣prove
CHYMISTRY as the most probable
means to discover a sensible Philosophy,
and to furnish noble Medicines for the be∣nefit
of Mankind; some of our Mounte∣banking
Vulcans have presumed to ap∣propriate
these high Favors, as if Your
Countenancing all true Sons of Art did
comprehend all who in order to their Delu∣sion
of the People call themselves Philoso∣phers
by fire, having neither satisfied the
UNIVERSITIES nor any other legall
Judges concerning their Abilities and fit∣ness
to undertake the most difficult Pro∣fession
of Physick: no other Construction
can be put upon that Transaction then a
necessary invitation of ACADEMICAL
PHYSICIANS to seek out and prepare the
most effectual Remedies by Art acquirable,

and to give the People a just esteem of this
way of Practice, to which because of the
mis-carriages of Pseudochymists they are
yet utter Enemies: but as for ignorant
Quacks, who being Master of Reason can
suppose that AUTHORITY will indulge
them to abuse the People and oppose a Fa∣culty
established by Law? As these are
Diseases in the STATE, so wholsom E∣DICTS
in time may happily be provided to
deal with their most obstinate Complica∣tions.
I shall not intimate any Distrust by the
use of many Arguments importuning Your
GRACE to promote the speedy Enacting of
convenient LAVVS whereby Illegal Pra∣ctisers
may be Restrained and Punished;
as MEDICINES when judiciously and ac∣cording
to ART applied, are worthily repu∣ted
, so Your GRACE
in giving an opportunity of their Right Use
will merit the greatest share in their Success
and Commendations.
This small TREATISE and the AU∣THOR

being engaged to Encounter Multi∣tudes
of Monsters, like those which Pliny
mentions whose Eyes are fixed in their
Breasts, their Knowledg being naught else
but Passion, have made bold to shelter them∣selves
under Your PATRONAGE. May
it please Your GRACE to accept this little
Book on the account of the Subjects which it
attempts to Vindicate, and the Author as
one who devotes himself to be
