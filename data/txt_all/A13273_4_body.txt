SWeet Grace of GRACES, Glory of Your Age,
Lustre of VERTVES (Moral and Diuine)
Whose Sacred Rayes (already) far out-shine
Your Princely State, Your Royall Parentage;
Heer, to your HIGHNES (with all Good-Presage,
Congratuling Your little PALATINE)
I consecrate This LITTLE-One of Mine
To serue Your Self, first; then, Your Son, for Page.
Your gracious Favours to my former Brood,
So binde my Thoughts, so bolden my Desires,
To showe Mee gratefull, as I know You good;
That Thus to YOV, This LITTLE Mine aspires:
Little in Growth; yet of so great a Spirit,
As (happily) Your Graces grace may merit.
