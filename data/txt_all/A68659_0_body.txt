MOST gratious Soveraigne, since it hath pleased Your Majestie of Your Princely care towards the Church, and Your Common-wealth, to take knowledge of some differen∣ces that are in Iudicature betweene Your Ec∣clesiasticall and Civile Law, and the Tempo∣rall Law of this Land (by which joyntly Your Majesties State is managed next after Your owne most rare providence, and the wisdome of such, whom it hath pleased Your Highnesse to associate unto Your selfe in the great affaires of Your Kingdome) I have been bold to offer unto Your Majestie this simple Treatise, as that which doth lay out the cause of those Differences, more particularly than

any man hitherto hath expressed the same. In comming to which (because I doe speake for those parts of Your Majesties Lawes, which are lesse knowne unto Your people, and e∣steemed no otherwise of them, than they see the practice thereof to bee here within Your Land) I have thought good, as it were in a Briefe, to set out the whole summe of both the Lawes, to the view of the people, that they may see, there is more worth in those for whom I speake, than was by many conceived to bee: So that the profession of the Ecclesia∣sticall and Civile Law may appeare to the world, neither to bee idle nor unfit for the State; so farre as it hath pleased the Royall Predecessours of Your Highnesse to give en∣tertainment unto it, and Your Majestie Your selfe to admit of it. In all which there is no o∣ther thing sought, than that such greevances as have beene of late offered by one Iurisdiction unto the other, and in consequence, to all Your Subjects, who follow any suits in the Civile or Ecclesiasticall Courts, may by Your Princely wisdome be considered, and by Your authoritie be redressed, if they be found to be

greevances indeed: for now as things are, nei∣ther Iurisdiction knowes their owne bounds, but one snatcheth from the other, in maner, as in a batable ground lying betweene two Kingdomes; but so, that the weaker ever go∣eth to the worse, and that which is mightier prevailes against the other: the professors thereof being rather willing to give Lawes and interpretations to other, than to take or admit of any against themselves. For which, the weaker appeales unto your Highnesse, humbly desiring Your Majesties upright and sincere Iudgement to discerne where the wrong is, and to redresse it accordingly, which is a worke worthy Your Majesties high con∣sideration. For as the Land is Yours, so also the Sea is Yours, and the Church is under Your Highnesse protection, as a Childe is un∣der his Tutor; so that all the Lawes thereof appertaine unto Your Majesties care & com∣fort alike: For which, not onely the whole profession of Your Ecclesiasticall and Civile Lawyers that now are, but those which shall succeed in those places for ever hereafter unto the worlds end, will praise and magnifie

Your Majesties gratious favour towards them, and wee that now are will pray to God for the long and happie prosperitie of Your Highnesse, and Your Posteritie over us, du∣ring the continuance of this Heaven and this Earth, and after the passing away thereof, a perpetuall fruition of the new Heaven and the new Earth, wherein righteousnesse onely shall dwell for ever.
