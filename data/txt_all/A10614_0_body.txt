MOST Humblie I beseech your gracious Maiestie, to vouchsafe the accepting of this small treatise, of one of your Maiesties old sworne seruantes of houshoulde, and (althouge of the least and most vnwor∣thyest) of the association. The great occasion of the late occurentes, hath induced me to sounde the trumpet of exhortation out of the worde of God, in a good and acceptable season (I trust) to doe good to all subiectes of your Maiestie, which shall read or heare the same. Most hartelie I pray God the fa∣ther of our Lorde Iesus Christ, to vouchsafe by it (as the ordinarie meanes of his blessed

will) with his spirite to worke good in th heares of all subiectes to your Maiestie, t whose handes or eares it shal come. And that his tender mercie in Christ, will continuallie set the watch and gard of his prouidence, a∣bout the royall person and estate of your Ma∣iestie, and keepe you as the apple of an eye, (as Dauid prayeth) and vnder the couert of his owne winges, from all conspiracies, trea∣sons, and plattes of practises, at home or a∣broade, of al enemies whatsoeuer: And blesse your Maiestie, with longe life, prosperous reigne, and victorie ouer all your enemyes.
