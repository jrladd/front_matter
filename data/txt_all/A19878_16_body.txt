IT is (Lord of my Muse and heart) since last
Thy sight inspir'd me, many ages pastâ–ª
In darknesse thick as ill-met Clouds can make,
In sleeps wherein the last Trump scarce could wake
The guiltlesse dead, I lay; and hidden more
Than Truth, which testy Controverts explore.
More hid than paths of Snakes, to their deep beds,
Or walkes of Mountaine-Springs from their first Heads:
And when my long forgotten Eies, and Mind,
Awak'd; I thought to see the Sunne declin'd
Through age, to th' influence of a Starre, and Men
So small, that they might live in Wombes agen.
But now, my strength's so giantly, that were
The great Hill-lifters once more toyling here;
They'ld choose me out, for active Back, for Bone,
To heave at aeio first, and heave alone.

Now by the softnesse of thy noble care,
Reason, and Light, my lov'd Companions are;
I may too, ere this Moone be lost, refine
My bloud, and bathe my Temples with thy Wine:
And then, know my Endimion (thou, whose name
To'th World example is, Musick to Fame)
I'le trie if Art, and Nature, able be
From the whole strength, and stock of Peie,
To pay thee my large debts; such as the poore
In open Blushes, hidden Hearts restore.
