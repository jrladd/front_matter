SIRS,
THAT God in whose hand your breath is, and
whose are all your wayes, having caused various
Seasons to pass over you, and in them all manife∣sted,
That his VVorks are Truth, and his VVayes Judg∣ment,
calls earnestly by them for that walking before him,
which is required from them, who with other distinguishing
mercies, are interested in the specialty of his protecting Provi∣dence.

As in a view of present Enjoyments, to Sacrifice to
your Net, and burn Incense to your Drag; as though
by them, your Portion were Fat and Plenteous, is an
exceeding provocation to the Eyes of his Glory, so to press to the
residue of your Desires and Expectations, by an Arm of Flesh,
the Designings and Contrivances of Carnal Reason, with out∣wardly
appearing Medium's of their Accomplishment, is no
less an Abomination to him. Though there may be a present
sweetness to them that finde the life of the hand, yet their
latter End will be, to lie down in sorrow. That you might be
prevailed on to give Glory to God by stedfastness in be∣lieving,
committing all your wayes to him with Patience in
wel-doing; to the Contempt of the most varnished Appearance
of Carnal Policy, was my peculiar aim, in this ensuing Ser∣mon.
That which added ready willingness to my Obedience unto
your Commands for the Preaching and Publishing hereof, being
a serious Proposal for the Advancement and Propagation of
the Gospel in another Nation, is here again recommended to
your Thoughts, by
 March 8th 1649.
