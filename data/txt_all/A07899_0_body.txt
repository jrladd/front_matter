IT hath beene al∣wayes
seen (right
Honorable) that
the Peaceableste
Prince hath had
the priuiest enimies, the moste
ciuill gouernment, some vnci∣uill
aduersaries: whose tedious
natures, could not liue within
the compasse of verte and mo∣destie,
and therefore they were

at continuall warre with them,
who established and maintay∣ned
a thing of such excellencie
within their Dominiōs. I need
not trauaile for circūstances, to
approoue what I haue said: for
that it hath beene manifested
heere in our Realme of Eng∣land.
Her Maiestie, vnder
whom we haue been so godlie,
gratiouslie & famouslie gouer∣ned,
her selfe beeing a spectacle
to the whole world, for vertue
and modesty of life: how great∣lie
she is defamed, contemned,
and despised therefore, of those
whom iniquitie and error hath
peruerslie blinded, I leaue to
your Honorable iudgements,
my humilitie & vnfained loy∣altie
remembred. But fearing
to intangle my self in any such
matters, as may either seeme

tedious to your Honours, or
troublesome to any modest
minde: I betake my selfe to
such a simple course of breui∣tie,
as may discouer my true in∣tent,
and the duetiful reuerence
I owe to so Honourable perso∣nages.
It is not vnknowen to your
Honours, how not long since I
witnessed my faithfull seruice
to her Maiestie, to the disproo∣uing
of such, as were bothe her
professed and sworne aduersa∣ries:
at which tyme, how nota∣blie
they were approoued guil∣tie
of euerie obiection, bothe
by their owne writinges, suf∣ficiēt euidence, & vnreprooue∣able
witnesses: it were needlesse
heere to rehearse, for that the
matter is yet apparant.
Since that time (right Ho∣nourable)

there hath beene cast
abroade, by the secrete fauou∣rers
and reends, of these so suf∣ficiently
cōuicted: such reports,
Lybels, & trayterous speeches
in the behalfe of the aforena∣med,
bothe against me, and the
other of the witnesses: as many
haue been inforced to muse &
meruale, they haue been dely∣ered
soorth after such spight∣full
and vniust manner.
Wherefore, at the earnest
intreatie of diuers, godlie and
well disposed men, as also to
discharge my selfe of the ma∣nifest
vntethes, (to such as
haue heard and seen them pub∣lished
against me:) vnder your
Honours fauour I hau beene
so bolde, to discouer these Trai∣tours,
and their trtcherous
practises, that it maye be seene

and knowen, howe falselie and
vntruelie they haue accused
me, and that they maye well
vnderstand, howe I haue beene
in those places, where I ha
heard and seene more then I
will heere report, to the con∣founding
o them, and  such
as they are, though in their
Libels, they giue foorth other∣wise
of me.
My request is therefore to
your Honours, vnder whose
fauours I cōfesse my selfe bothe
safelie and sufficientlie defen∣ded:
that this my good in∣tent
maye attaine your Ho∣nourable
liking, which will
crosse all the ,
wherewith I haue beene en∣daungered
and discouraged by
many.

Thus remaining the most af∣fectionate
in duetiful seruice to
her Maiestie, and an humble
and obedient seruaunt to your
Honours: I cease at this time,
beseeching God long to pre∣serue
her Maiestie, and
your Honours in con∣tinuall
happinesse.
