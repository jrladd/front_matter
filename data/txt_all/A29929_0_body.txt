Great Sir,
I Have Advised with many Emi∣nent Lawyers, upon the ensuing Treatise, who agree, The Statutes, Presidents and Book-Cases to be rightly quoted; And I know the matter of Fact to be Truely Stated: There∣fore humbly, and in all Duty, beg of Your Majesty to Read and Judge how my dear Lord, and I, have been mis-re∣presented for promoting Your Service.
