May it please Your Grace,
I Most humbly present to Your Grace the Sermon which I made to Your Clergy, at Your Graces Primary Visitation. That whilst we complain of being despised, we may
 not make our selves justly contemptible, I deliver'd my Thoughts with Freedome, in reference to our Lives, and our Doctrines. There are many Learned and Worthy Per∣sons of the Clergy within Your Graces Ju∣risdiction, and Your Graces Example and Authority, Your Learning and Prudence, adorned with so much sweetness of Temper and Zeal for the Church, and those many other excellent Qualifications which have render'd Prelates Glorious and Venerable, in the worst of Times, and for which Your Grace is Belov'd and Honour'd by all that know you, will make more such. And therefore these Reflections on the ill Conse∣quences of wicked Lives, and ridiculous, useless or mischievous Sermons, will appear to judici∣ous Persons, not a Satyr on, but a Vindi∣cation
 of Your Graces Clergy, inasmuch as 'twill remind them that Your Clergy neither Live, nor Preach so.
