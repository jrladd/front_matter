May it please your Lordships,
FInding by my Conversation with People who have an Inclination to try their Fortunes in A∣merica, that your Province of Carolina had not its due valuation for want of being made known to the World, and not hearing of any that had underta∣ken it, I looked upon it as a Duty incumbent upon me, who have had the Honour to be your Secretary in your Carolina-Affairs now four years, to Publish the en∣suing Treatise; whereby is made known the Great∣ness of your Soveraigns Gift to your Selves, and to the World the Greatness of your Trust and Favour with Him; and to those that have a desire of settling there, to what kind of Countrey and Climate they Transport Themselves: Wherein I have most strictly kept to the Rules of Truth, there not being any thing that I have written in Commendation of your Pro∣vince, which I cannot prove by Letters from thence now in my possession, and by Living Witnesses now in England.

I should not have been thus presumptuous to adven∣ture upon this Work, and to have crav'd for it your Lordships Patronage, had not the Employment I have under you (which hath given me frequent Oppor∣tunities of discovering the Humanity and Softness with which you Treat all Those who apply to you, your constant Endeavours for the Good of all those who come under your Government in Carolina, and the great care you have taken by your admirable Consti∣tution of Government. which you have there settled, for the lasting security, peace and well being of all the Inhabitants of your Province) induc'd me to beleive that the same goodness with which you treat others, will be extended to me, and that you will pardon my present presumption, and all the other Imperfections of,
May it please your Lordships,
