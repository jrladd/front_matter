May it Please Your Most Excellent Majesty;
THESE Histories, Now first Published in the English Language, do most Hum∣bly beg to Offer themselves to the Royal Patronage of Your Majesty; whereunto they are Encouraged by
 this; that in the Originals, to which there are Prefixed the Im∣perial Names of Constantine the Great and Dioclesian, They have been an∣tiently Consecrated unto Princes, the most Glorious, and the most In∣vincible, Then, on Earth.
Your Majesty is the Constantine of This Age; and by as Great a Hand, and as Peculiar a Happiness, and with as Immortal Glory, hath Re∣scued the Liberties of all Europe; and more especially, the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of this Church and Nation, as that Emperor did the Primitive Christians from the Powers of Paganism.
Nor could the Potentates, whose Lives are here Represented, find any where a more Illustrious Patron, and a Better Judge of their Great
 Actions, than Your Majesty. Had Your Majesty swayed the British Scepter in those days, Hadrian and Severus had visited, as they Then did, Your Coasts; but not to pre∣tend to Conquests, but to Adore You.
Happy I! That I have this Op∣portunity of Presenting, with all Humility, a small Oblation to Your Majesty, as a Mark of my entire Fi∣delity and Affection to Your most Sacred Person and Government. The God of Arms hath Miraculously Acted for you against Your Ene∣mies. And may He be pleased to Grant, that Your Majesty, sup∣ported ever by His Hand, may long Continue to Adorn, as You do, the Gloriousest Crown, joyn∣ed with the best Church, in the World, by a Reign, which is so
 Infinitely Worthy of the One and the Other.
I am, with the most Profound Veneration,
SIR,
