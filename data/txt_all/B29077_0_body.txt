MAY it please your Grace AND your Lordships.
NOtwithstanding, the most of Dedications give Small security, to the Author or work; though made to persons, of the greatest interest, and Merit, the most of such being published without either their consent or knowledge: And sometimes without any Interest in the Patron, but what is officiously claim∣ed, by the very work of the Addressors: Yet when I have occasion to tell the World, that this ensuing Sermon comes abroad by your Lordships express Command; it being delivered in your presence; And upon so Solemn ane occasion: This cannot but overcome, the strongest Disinclinations, to it's publication and perfectly calm my justest fears about it; It being impossible but so great
Names must give it a Luster; And such too, as shall make it's tollerable things acceptable, and the very defects passant.
Neither have I a slender foundation, for this my con∣jecture: For tho your Lordships singular erudition, and vivacity, should be denyed their just claim; which is a mighty veneration to what your Lordships give but the smalest encouragement: Yet the incomparable Zeal and dexterity, whereby your Lordships have managed the important affairs of your present trust, so incredibly to the advantages, of a decayed Religion, and loyalty, in this uneasie corner; must needs so strongly, inflame the affections of all good Subjects, as to reflect a most compassionat tenderness to what presumes upon the smal∣est relation, to so noble Personages, and is stamped with so great and endearing an authority.
And therefore, whatever aversion, I so justly entertain to publick appearances; yet having had the honour, to be so eminently publick, As your Lordships presence must needs import; I make no scruple, to send this abroad (which is not a greater, but a further adventure) con∣cluding it, in some measure worthy, of the worlds view; and that it cannot misse, of a gracious acceptance; there being a command for it's publication laïd by your Lord∣ships, upon him, Who, in the profoundest veneration, of your great honour, and vertues, is not more, by obliga∣tion of duty, then zealous inclination & affection of soul.
