Right Hon:
YOVR Thrice∣noble Brother and my most honored Lord and Patron, be∣ing now a Celestiall Cour∣tier, and crowned with im∣mortall Glory among the
Princes in Paradise, hath left your Lordship behind him, not onely to enioy his Honourable titles and for∣tunes heere vpon earth, but withall, to tread the pathes of his exemplar Virtue and Noblenesse, where through you may finally arriue to the height of his felicitie in Heauen. My true deuoti∣on beeing tyed to the per∣petuall memory of his Ho∣norable name, and therein also to your Lordship as the succeeding heyre to all his most worthy attributes and rights, doth justly ex∣act from mee some tribute,
or token of my bounden Dutie; which I thus hum∣bly present vnder these few memorials gathered out of Sacred Antiquitie; not presuming thereby, to adde any thing by way of supply to those perfections you haue already attained, but rather very humbly cra∣uing your fauorable Coun∣tenance & Honorable pro∣tection of them, to the be∣nefit of some others mean∣lier instructed, who there∣upon, may peraduenture bee the easilier induced to peruse them: For if your Lordship deigne to patro∣nize
them, who will alto∣gether dispise them? Such therefore as they are, I de∣dicate and consecrate, to∣gether with my selfe, to be for euer:
