THE Author's Condition being at pre∣sent on a Level, and the Basis of his former Fortune Overthrown, to get Clear of the Dilemma, and prevent his future Inter∣ment in the Ruins; Humbly takes leave to Dedicate this small Poem (the Off-spring of a Penny-less Muse) to Your kind Accep∣tance: Having nothing in this Iron Age, wherewith to support him, but a Feeble Quill. He knows it is not Practicable to Trade for Wealth in the Poets Territories, he might as well depend on the Wheel of Fortune for a Benefit, which only Turns to the advan∣tage of her Favourites, than Fish for Pearl in the Muses Helicon, where are only Wrecks, and no Riches; he has only play'd
a little about the Brink; which, if not we done, is submitted to Correction: But, b¦lieving the spirit of Goodness and true Hu∣mility, resides in your Generous Breast, as Rich Gemm in a Noble Cascate, he is En∣courag'd to Lay this the aforesaid Brat a your Hospitable gate; for they whose Esti¦mate of Men, and things Proceed not from a Blind and Popular Applause; Lives u¦most near the Example of our SAVIOUR who, when on Earth Declin'd the Conver∣sation of a Proud Tetrarch, for that of a Poor Lazer, and Valu'd more the Holy acts of an Humble Fisher, then all the Great and Heroick Deeds of a Haughty Caesar.
