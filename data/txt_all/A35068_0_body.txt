Illustrious Lady,
IN these destructive
Times, the Conco∣mitants
of Pride and
Envy are swollen up

that whereof wit should be che∣rish'd
by Indulgency, it is even
massacred with remorseless Ty∣ranny,
and turn'd out naked to

Oaks of Apollo are fallen by
the hand of Nature: and the
tender aspiring Sprigs, (which
were wont to shroud under
them) are left like Jonas, without

(and indeed my presumption is
great) to appeal to your Honor,
as the only Sanctuary left me for
refuge, not wholly doubting
Your disdain (which I might
justly fear, were not Your Can∣dor
above my Merit.) I am
no Parasite, I will not offend
You with superfluous Oratory;
Nor be a Sycophant to Your
Vertue. The world is well e∣nough
acquainted, and needs no
pretended Herauld to proclaim
You Prudent and Pious. May it
but cohere with Your pleasure
to aspect the endeavour of my

Muse with a serene Eye, and
You will superabundantly felicitate
him who is
