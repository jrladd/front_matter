THE straight and dutifull considera∣tion of so many great fauors, with which your Ho∣norable disposition hath vouch∣safed to grace me, vnworthie the least of them, hath compelled me thus presumptuously to dedi∣cate these Christian models (al∣beit
 the talent of another mans zealous inuention, yet as the tithe of my poore Printing-presse) vn∣to your honourable patronage; hoping, that in regard of their worth, and not of my deserts, you will likewise peruse them at con∣uenient seasons. The vtilitie of them I neede not rippe vp, seeing that your owne deepe-grounded wisedome wil hereafter by expe∣rienced perusall find out the same far better, then either my simple mind can imagine, or my pen lay down. Onely this I humbly craue of your Honour, that my good deuotion herein bee acceptable vnto you: for our Sauior Christ preferred the poore widdowes mite, before the golden offerings of the rich. And is it not written,
 that Artaxerxes a Pagan King, daigned to receiue a cup-full of cold water at the hand of poore Synetes? Whose president I imi∣tating, am emboldened to regi∣ster your Heroicall name in the forefront of this booke, intitu∣led, The Care of a Christian Conscience, nothing doubting at all, but that your Honours name is registred in the Booke of life, for the Christian Care which you haue extēded to many of the poore distressed members of Ie∣sus Christ. Thus ceasing, I beseech the Lord to cōtinue you in your godly course, & endue you with all blessings which eyther this earth affords, or heauen contains.
From London, Aprill 20. 1600.
