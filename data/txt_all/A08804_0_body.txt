Sir,
MY intentions had fastened the patronage of this Booke upon that pious and Right Honorable Gentleman, Sir Iulius Caesar (your prede∣cessour in the Mastership of St Katherines) whose dedication of himselfe to that great Master and maker of the world, renders you the Successour of his place and my service. Therefore, and because all that know you rightly, speak you to be a friend to Learning, and Philagathus in abstracto, a true Religi∣on Lover, I thought fit to present these devou

Meditations to your judicious acceptation. These royall Penitentials deduced and exempli∣fied unto us from the sacred person of a King, conclude all persons and degrees from an exemp∣tion in the practise: And the command of that excellent duty is more especially incumbent on us in these particular times of humiliation, when that formidable pestilentiall sword hath so smit∣ten us, and hangs still so perpendicularly over our heads. The profit of Repentance, it removes our sinne in reatu & poena, it blunts that wea∣pons point, whose thirst is sooner quencht with ear & then bloud, and it preferreth the miserable delinquent from the shamefull Barre to the most glorious Bench. Let the Reverend Authors pen declare his worth, and let the worke commend it selfe to the world. Onely Sir, be you pleased to give it countenance and protection, which I am confident will improve it to a more generall and publique approbation, and make it the more re∣dundant in the Churches benefit. Health, honour, and Heaven at last I wish you from the heart of
