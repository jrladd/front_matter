SIR,
THese Letters address'd (most of them) to Your best de∣grees of Subjects, do, as so many lines drawn from the Circumference to the Centre, all meet in Your Majesty, who, as the Law stiles You the Fountain of honour and grace, so You should be the Centre of our happines. If Your Majesty vouch∣safe them a Gracious Aspect, they may all prove Letters of credit, if not credentiall Letters, which Soverain Princes use only to Authorize: They venture to go abroad into the vast Ocean of the World, as Let∣ters of Mart, to try their Fortunes; and

Your Majesty being the greatest Lord of Sea under Heaven, is fittest to protect them, and then they will not fear any hu∣man power. Moreover, as this Royall Protection secures them from all danger, so it will infinitely conduce to the pros∣perity of their voyage, and bring them to safe Port with rich returns.
Nor would these Letters be so familiar, as to presume upon so high a Patronage, were not many of them Records of Your Own Royall Actions; And 'tis well known, that Letters can tresure up, and transmit matters of State to posterity, with as much Faith, and be as authentic Registers, and safe repoitories of Truth, as any Story whatsoever.
This brings them to ly all prostrat at Your Feet, with their Author who is
Sir,
