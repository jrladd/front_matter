IF yet Your Thoughts are loose from State Affairs,
Nor feel the Burden of a Kingdom's Cares;
If yet Your Time and Actions are Your own:
Receive the Present of a Muse unknown.
A Muse that, in Advent'rous Numbers, Sings
The Rout of Armies, and the Fall of Kings,
Brittain Advanc'd, and Europe's Peace Restor'd,
By Sommer's Counsels, and by NASSAU's Sword.


To You, my Lord, these daring Thoughts belong,
Who help'd to Raise the Subject of my Song;

To You the Hero of my Verse Reveals
His Great Designs, to You in Council tells
His Inmost Thoughts, determining the Doom
Of Towns Unstorm'd, and Battels yet to come.
And well cou'd You, in Your Immortal Strains,
Describe his Conduct, and Reward his Pains:
But since the State has all Your Cares engrost,
And Poetry in Higher Thoughts is lost,
Attend to what a lesser Muse Indites,
Pardon her Faults, and Countenance her Flights.


On You, my Lord, with anxious Fear I wait,
And from Your Judgment must expect my Fate,
Who, free from Vulgar Passions, are above
Degrading Envy, or Misguided Love;
If You, well-pleas'd, shall Smile upon my Lays,
Secure of Fame, my Voice I'le boldly Raise,
For next to what You Write, is what You Praise.
