Sir,
MAny Reasons induce me to Dedicate these Pa∣pers to you, your own personal worth, your obliging carriage, and great civilities to all who are honoured with your ac∣quaintance: But chiefly your zeal for Religion and Hereditary affection to the Church of Eng∣land.
Sir, the restless indeavours of
 the Romanists to reduce us to their Communion, call'd me into the Field; what ever my abilities are, I thought it my duty to con∣tend for the Truth, at least to Alarm others, that they may oppose the incroaching Enemy. If the Romanists were busie in gaining Proselytes, I saw no rea∣son why we should sit still; when they were using their Swords, it would be no prudence to keep ours in the Scabbard; if we judge our Cause good, it would be our shame to betray it by our silence, and we could never answer it be∣fore God or our own Consci∣ences, if we were not as zealous to oppose error, as they are to maintain it, and shew'd not as much care to weed up the Tares,
 as they do to sow them. On this ground I have publish'd some more Considerations to stay the wavering and prevent the ba sliding of the Weak, by shewing the unreasonableness of the Ro∣manists in requiring our Com∣munion with the present Romish Church. And now my judge∣ment as well as affection prompts me to beg your Patronage of this Work, as being one whom I knew to be a true friend of the Protestant Clergy and a Patron of the Church, one that loved his Religion as well as profest it, and, which will be your com∣fort as well as credit, that ho∣noured his Profession by con∣stant exercise of Devotion, and a good Conversation.

Sir, The continuance of your Health and Life, with the abun∣dance of all Spiritual and Tem∣poral blessings, is the hearty Prayer of

March 13. 1672.
