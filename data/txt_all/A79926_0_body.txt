MY LORD,
I Presume to Dedicate This to Your Grace, upon many Accounts. As having receiv∣ed my First Education, at the University of Oxford, under Your Lordship's Care; and am now again Happy, in having Your Grace for my Metrapolitan. It was Your Lordship, that did me the Singular Honour, to recom∣mend Sir Terence Mac-mahon to my Instruction, when my Lord Inchiquin brought him to Your
 Grace. And it is Your Lordship's Great Learning, that can best Pro∣tect, Aid, and Assist Me, and Se∣cure the Cause that it Suffer not, through my Defects, and Infir∣mities, if any Subtile Adversary should Assail me. This is Print∣ed at the Request of several Per∣sons of Quality, and Others that were my Auditors, and perswade me that it may be Useful to the Publick; and therefore having after all, Your Lordship's Appro∣bation, I could not deny to gra∣tifie Them, when thereby also I might make an open acknow∣ledgement of Your Graces Great and Manifold Favours.
