THE time being now growen long (right noble Countesse) since J first endeuoured to shewe my self vnto my honorable good Lorde and your Ladiship in some accep∣table course of seruice, and finding alwaies some one or other vnkind let thereunto: I haue now at length, as one ouer wearyed with the fruitlesse ex∣pectation of my hopelesse mynd (euen to the vp∣brayding as it were of myne ill happe) desperatly attempted to present your Honor with this slight and slender booke: not that I reckon it a sufficient supplye of the thing I want and desired, but rather as an occasion to shewe how greatly grieued J re∣mayne that my happe hath not bene all this while to doe better, especially vnto such and so noble a

 it self vnder the respect of my zeale and dutifull meaning: protesting that it hath not proceeded from me as the fruite of an ydle brayne, but as the true effect of a most zealous mynd and well affec∣ted heart. And so hoping your Honor will con∣ceiue of it, J forbeare the further lengthening of this my rude Epistle.
From London this ioy∣full xvij. day of Nouember, beginning the xxx. yeere of her Maiesties most happie Raigne.
