WOrthy Sir, (Not to prefixe a tedi∣ous Epistle, be∣fore so small a Treatise) hauing a resolution for the publication hereof, (for reasons knowne to my selfe, and perhaps, not vn∣knowne to some that know mee) I make bold (I hope, not too bold) to present the same vnto you, to te∣stifie my respect of you.

Your Acceptance, Peru∣sall, Patronage, are the onely things I desire; though I cannot say, as the Iewes concerning the Cen∣turion in the Gospel, thatLuk. 7. 4. either it, or my selfe, is worthy for whom you should doe this. The God of heauen, the giuer of all good blessings, blesse you, & yours, prosper, and pre∣serue you blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ.
