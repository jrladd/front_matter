Right Honorable;
THat the happy Industry of former A∣ges (whereby we enjoy the benefit of so many useful inventions) hath still left mater enough, for the contrivance and discovery of succeeding times, cannot be better made appear, than by calling to mind, those many worthy improvements, which almost all the more Liberal Arts, have received within the compass of this last Century, especially Physick, wherein Anatomy alone (I may truly say) hath been inriched, by a full third part at least. And herein our own Countrymen, have been as successfully inquisitive, as any other their Contemporaries whatsoever. No wonder then if in such an Age, I, imitating their example, have thought fit, to give this ac∣count, of my leisure, to the world; but

that I offer it to the protection of so great a Patron; the reasons, perhaps, are not so ma∣nifest, as necessary. For as the Novelty of so unexpected a method, as I here propose, will undoubtedly expose it to the calumny of such, who (rather than give themselves the trouble of examining the truth of it, being betimes perswaded, that they already know as much as is to be learnt) will soon condemn it, both of folly and innovation. So it seems of absolute necessity, that it bear with it the splendid name of some great Personage, the better to bespeak the judi∣cious Readers charitable Censure. Whose name then could I more hopefully have pre∣fixed, than that of your Lordships, a person so Noble by descent, so Eminent by your Great and Honorable Imployments, and so deservedly beloved and admired of all for that excellent composure of Greatness and Goodness, so remarkable in your Lord∣ship; which attempt of mine, if it may re∣ceive a favourable Interpretation, I shall be obliged to continue

Dublin, July 1. 1664.
