THe custome to geue newe yeres giftes grounded vpon be∣neuolence, cōfirmed by ye consent of peo∣ple, calleth and willeth, yea ra∣ther commaundeth me (right ho∣norable lorde) at this tyme to rēdre vnto your honour my due∣tie: whiche my good will is redye & veraie desirous to obserue, not myndyng ye breache of a custome that hath a foundacion so chari∣table, a continuaūce so laudale▪ and an ende so honest and profi∣table.

Musyng therefore in what thyng bothe for this tyme grate∣full, and herafter fruitefull, I might chiefly declare thesame, no thing in my minde could bee wis∣shed, nothyng coulde bee deuised, nothyng coulde bee prouided, so requisite, so meete, so necessary for your good lordeship, who is con∣tinually occupied either in ye high affaires of ye cōmen wealth, or in hearyng & determinyng causes of controuersie, causyng peace ye most coumfortable nourissher of people to reigne euery where: as some brief thyng to aduertise your goodnesse of the preserua∣cion of your health, how ye maye long to Goddes pleasure cōtinue in your vocacion, how ye maye ma eres execute your office accordyng to the godly zeale and

loue, yt ye beare to iustice, whiche ye haue and do dayly declare and expresse to the worlde. And syth it hath pleased almyghtie God, and the kynges moste gracious maiestie, to constitute and depute you in the chiefest authorite and office vnder his highnes in this realme, to bee to his maiestie in ye stede and lieu that Aaron was to Moyses (the chiefe mynister of God ouer the childrē of Israel) whiche is to be his graces mouth, to vt∣ter to vs his moste humble sub∣iectes, yt his highnes shal receiue of God, to be to yt comē lawes of this hys realme a lifely equytee, hauīg power by your cōsciēce to ordeine remedy, wher it hath pro∣uided none, to mytigate thesame, where it shal seme to be rigorous: we ought daily not onely to geue

prayse & thākes to his most excel∣lent goodnes for thesame, but we bee also bound to studie & deuyse to our power, howe so iuste and vertuous an offycer maye longe continue emong vs. For as they that beare good wyll, and loue to the comen wealth mooste reioyse and be glad, whē iustyce and the lawes be iustly executed and my∣nistred, and hertely desire that they may be so maynteyned and kepte as pyllers withoute the whiche no publique weale can stāde, no, nor any lytle famyly cā endure. So ought they to be ioy∣full, when the rulers and myni∣sters therof bee in healthe & pro∣speritee hable to execute thesame: and besydes to studye and ende∣uour how they maye so cōtynue. For as a woman that hathe no

hed nor gouernour is lytle ha∣ble to gouerne and rule her ser∣uaūtes, if thei be froward: so can iustice & lawe litle do in a comen wealthe, where people be euill di∣sposed, yf those lacke yt shuld sup∣porte, maynteyne and put theim in execucion. On thother parte they that bee in autorite & office, as they bee bounde not to bee re∣myfe and negligente in execu∣tyng their dutie, so ought they not ouermuch vexe, molest, wery, and consume their bodies, but so preserue their healthe, as they maye longeserue God, and their prynce in their vocacion. And as Iethro seeyng Moyses ouermuche troubled in hearyng the peoples suites and causes, saied: It is not well dooen thus to consume and waste your selfe: So maye  bee

iustly saied to suche as bee in au∣thoritee and office, hauyng their mynde so fixed to the expedicion of causes, that they regarde not their healthe: Ye dooe not well, thus to cosume your selfes. For as in a campe or army, no souldi∣our maye departe without licence and pasporte of his Capitayne, but must so vse hym selfe whyle he is there, as he maye bee at all times ready and hable to serue at commaundement, so ought eue∣ry christen man to lead his life in this world, not to seke or laboure to bee out of it, not to shorten his daies, but to tary vnto such tyme as he shall haue licence and pas∣porte of the Lorde almighty, and not in the meane season to make his bodye feble and weake, that he shall not bee hable to do that

he is elected and called vnto.
Plato saieth that Aesculapius (who for his excellēt knowlage in phi∣syk is called God therof) would not that suche as professed yt fa∣cultie and scyence, should enter∣prise or take in hand to cure suche as wer of nature subiecte to dis∣seases, or had gotten siknesse wil∣lingly by intēperaunce, although they wer neuer so ryche. The one, because they engendred & begate chyldren lyke theim selfes, that is feble, weake, syckely, not hable to serue in the common wealthe. And the other, for yt they wylling∣ly vnhabled theim selfes to serue therin, and yet besides consumed that others lacked, who wer both hable & wylling. But men som∣tyme wyllingly must bryng their

bodies out of temper, & sonest of all suche as bee great rulers and Counsailours, who for ye safete of the hoole cōmen wealth be en∣forced vpon presente occasion, to prouide present remedye, to dooe thinges out of hand, which with∣out great daunger will not tarye time, whom neither Aesculapius nor any man that hath reason, would to bee without redresse. For the whiche cause many excellent cler∣kes aswell in other sciences as in phisycke, haue deuised how to re∣store suche mēne to their pristyne state and health of body, & emong others the exellent clerke & graue Philosopher Plutarchus Chaeronensis bothe Scholemaister and Coun∣sailour vnto the most vertuously disposed Emperoure of all Gen∣tiles raanus, in a booke entytled Preceptes to p̄serue good health

wherein not like a botcher with poticarye ware, but naturally he teacheth those that bee in autho∣ritee & office in the publike weale, and suche as bee geuē to the stu∣dye of good letters, howe to pre∣serue & maynteine their healthe. And because it is not onely his, but also all other learned & wyse mennes opinion, yt there is none so great enemie to health, as sur∣faicting & distemperaunce, wher∣by more men hath & dooe daylye dye, then by y• sweord or plague: he firste teacheth how the appe∣tite and sensuall lustes of the bo∣dye maye bee restrained and bry∣deled, that they shall not procure and cause intemperaunce, then if it chaunce a manne to fall therin, how he shall come out again, af∣terward being in health what di∣et he shall kepe, what exercises he

shall vse to preserue and kepe the same. Whiche I haue translated into our Englishe tongue, & dooe presēt vnto our honorable lord∣ship for a newe yeres gyfte, most hartely desiring & praiyng God the father almighty, that his most godly minyster the Kynges most royall maiestie maye many yeres more reigne ouer vs in moste prosperitee, and felicitee: and your good Lordeship long to serue and rule vnder his highnesse in honor and healthe.
At London the firste daye of Ianuarye, in the yere of Christes incarnacyon. 1543.
