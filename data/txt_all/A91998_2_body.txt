Beloved in the blood of Jesus Christ,
THe Apostle tells you, 2 Pet. 2.1. That there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable Heresies: but now; some are so im∣pudent, they bring them in openly. Beware of such doctrine as tends to the undervaluing of the Law of God, which the Apostle sayes, Rom. 7.12. is holy, just, and good: Take heed of such as goe about to vilifie, or rather nullifie the duties of sanctifi∣cation. Consider Saint Hieroms advise, Epist. ad Paulinum; who wished Paulinus, verba vertere in opera, to turne his words into workes; that so you may be doers of the Word, and not hearers onely, deceiving your owne soules. Saint Bernard (de conversione ad Clericos cap. 15.) sayes of good workes, that they are Temporalia aeternitatis semina, seeds temporall, but their fruit is eternal; Christ at the last will welcome none with a Well said, but Well done good
servant, enter thou into thy masters joy: If any shall preach to you, that because you beleeve you need no repentance; neither to bee sorrowfull in confessing your sinnes, nor to aske pardon: Tell them you have not so learned Christ, who himselfe hath taught you that as duely as you aske for your daily bread, you should likewise aske for the forgivenesse of sinne; let me warne you in the Apostles words, 2 Pet. 3.17. Yee therefore beloved, seeing yee know these things, beware lest yee also being led away with the errour of the wicked fall from your owne stedfastnesse: And the very God of peace sanctifie you wholly: And I pray God your whole spirit, and soule, and body be preserved blamelesse unto the comming of our Lord Je∣sus Christ: And so I rest

Septemb. 1. 1643.
