May it please Your Majesty.
WHAT I have before Dedicated to the
Royall Queen Dowager, your pious Mo∣ther,
as the fitest Object; because of
Her double Title to you, (for you are Madam the
Child first of Her Alliance, and then again of Her
Prayers, to which I am perswaded the Almighty
conceded much, in the time of Your late Infirmity.)
What I then directed to Her Majesty, I now present
unto Your virtuous Self, as the Subject on whom
GOD wrought that Deliverance, and in whom
therefore there must needs be some neerer & greater
degree of joy and sence. This Madam I beseech
Your Majesty to accept, both because dangers past
are of a happy memory, or else he was mistaken that
Said,
—Haec olim meminisse juvabit.Virgil. Aen.

Yea and because they are likewise of a happy fer∣tility,
producing much thanks and praise to GOD
that brought Ʋs out of them: not to speak of the re∣gularity
they sometimes work after in our lives, be∣cause
your Majesties needed not to be rectified. Now
seeing I have happened upon the word Fertility,
give me leave to tell your Majesty, that I have a
strong Presumption, that this your late Sickness will
conduce much thereto in your own temperament.
Your Body of Portugall is all wasted and consumed.
If you shall now betake you to an English Dyet, so
brave an alteration will be made in your Majesties
Constitution, that we shall have a Prince built out
of You like His Father, to make Ʋs up a long last∣ing
happyness here, and to wait upon your Majesties
old Age, to that which lasts for ever hereafter.
As Prayes
