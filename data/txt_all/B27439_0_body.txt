SIR,
TIs both my duty and my debt, to return the improvement of my talent to you, from whom I first received it, and to pay my thanks for those borrowed sparks which have since kindled and increased into a flame. That debtor is too ungrateful, and deserves to have no favour shew'd him in the principal, that never comes to pay, much less acknowledge an interest. This Obligation, Sir, was one Motive to address this Piece to you, having at first been initiated in this little Art I pretend to, by your Brother and your self; but fearing withal the severe and critical cen∣sure of a more judicious Eye. Be pleased there∣fore
 to accept of this small Tribute, not for any worth or desert of its own, but as a Token of my Gratitude. Yuor Name (I confess) is too Great to stand in the Front of so inconside∣rable a Paper as this, wherewith I here present you, and might make a suitable Frontispiece for some for more excellent Work. Whatever it be, it begs your Candid Acceptance; it may parhaps need, but I fear it deserves not so good a Patron. Another reason (Sir) why I offer this Tract to you, is an Ambition I have to bring the World better acquainted with so great a part of its own Treasure, and to make it know that there are yet some such worthy Persons as your Self, whom even they that are Enemies to this present World, cannot refuse both to love and honour. I shall forbear at this time to display your Merits, in reference to my own particular; least he that reads this and sees Your Name praefixed, may expect more by the Epistle than is performed in the Book. And so I make my self Guilty of his Pride and Indiscretion, that sets a fair Porch before a sorry Building. This only Sir, I shall endeavour, and do beg You to believe, that I shall always be industri∣ous to manifest my self,
Right Worshipful,
