I Send you a present, which if it answers not my obligations to you, yet certainly is it the greatest that Nicolas Machiavel could commend unto you: for herein I have ex∣pressed what I know, and what I have lear∣ned by a long experience, and continnal rea∣ding of the affairs of the world. And being that neither you nor any body else can look for more of me, you have no reason to com∣plain,

I have given you no more. Well may you be sorry at the feebleness of my understan∣ding, being that these relations of mine here are but weake, and at the errour of my judg∣ment, being that I my self several times in my discourses am deceived. Which being so, I know not which of us is the less beholding the one to the other, either I to you, who have for∣ced me to wrie that which of my own self I should never have undertaken: or you to me, who have given you but smal satisfaction in my writings. Receive this then so, as things should be taken by friends, where more regard is had to the good will of him that sends, then to the worth of what is sent. And beleeve that here∣in I have one alone satisfaction, when I think that, however perchance I may have erred in many circumstances herein, in this alone I know I have not fail'd in making choise of you to whom before all others I may dedicate these my discourses, partly because in thus doing I have shewed some thankfulness for the good turnes you have done me, and partly for that me thinks I have quit the common custome of those that write, who use alwayes to dedieate all their works to Princes; and blinded by ambition, and covetousness, attribute to him the commendations of all vertuous qualities, whereas they ought to blame him for what is faulty in him. Whereupon, thats I may not run into this error, I have made choice, not of those that are Princes, but of those that for their many good parts might deserve well to be so: nor of those that are able to bestow preferments, honours, nor wealth upon me, but of those who though they are not power∣full, yet are they willing to do well for me:

for men, if they would carry a right judgment, should esteem of those that in themselves are, and not of those that have the means to be libe∣rall; and so of those that understand how to governe, and not of those that without under∣standing have the government of a kingdom. And writers commend rather Hieron of Siracu∣sa when he was a private man, then Perse of Macedon, when he was a King: For Hieron wanted nothing else of being a Prince, then a Principality: that other had no part of a King but a Kingdome. Enjoy therefore that good or that evill which you your selves have de∣sired: and if you shall continue still in this er∣ror, that these my opinions be acceptable to you, I shall not faile to proceed in the rest of the story, as in the beginning I made my pro∣mise.
