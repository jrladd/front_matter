MY LORD,
THE Honour and Respect which I had for your Lordships Father, is not wholly unknown to you; as also, with what Condescention, Familiarity, and Kindness, he always used me. I own, those Days which I spent in his Lordship's Conversation in France, were without Comparison, the very best Part of my Life. I design'd to have made my Gratitude Public; and to that End, Com∣posed a small Treatise, and Dedicated it to him, which he not only saw, but was also pleased graciously to accept: But before I could get it Printed, he died, to the great Loss of the Public, and all good Men; but to none so much as me, for my Dammage is irreparable, unless your Lordship succeeds

him in his Favour to me, as you do in his Honour and Ver∣tues, which I hope, but dare not expect.
I humbly present your Lordship with this Copy of Ver∣ses, an Earnest of something of a greater Bulk, but I dare not say of a better Composition; for if the Approbation of my Friends, has not imposed upon my Credulity, and my Taste does not deceive me, this is the most kindly, and palatable Fruit, that ever my Cultivation has produc'd: I wish it were worthy your Acceptation; however, I hope, I am excusable, having offer'd to your Lordship the best of my Substance. I conclude, begging pardon for my Pre∣sumption, and praying Heaven to continue, and increase the Felicities of your noble Family. I am,
My LORD,
