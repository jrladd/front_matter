HAuing vvritten a confutation of a booke intituled An Apologie of the church of England, right excellent Princesse and my Soueraigne lady, for sundry causes I haue ben mo∣ued of the same to make a present vnto your most excellent Maiestie. First, vvhereas that booke conteineth many great errours concer∣ning the necessary doctrine of faith, beside di∣uerse vntruthes and slaunders touching sundry estates and persons, to no smal dishonour of our countrie and offence of godly and honest har∣tes: the same being both commonly preached in your realme and to the vvhole vvorld set for∣the vnder the name of the church of England: it semed to me conuenient, the confutation the∣reof be offered to that personage, to vvhom God hath geuen the rule and gouernement of England. Next, your learning and vvisedom being such as the world knovveth, I am persua∣ded, that my trauail shal be vvell vnderstanded,
 and therfore right so accepted. Againe, your Cle∣mencie being nolesse tryed in dede, then by pu∣blike fame to your great honour reported: there is no cause, vvhy the greatnes of your estate ought to feare the least of your louing subiectes to aduenter so holesome and so necessary an en∣terprise. Furthermore, your good inclination to∣vvardes the auncient and catholike religiō, vvhi∣ch the authours of that Apologie vvith an odi∣ous terme do call papistrie, encourageth me not a litle vnto your Maiestie to offer this gyft and seruice. Of vvhich your good inclination, (that I seme not to flatter) these both to me and to o∣thers appeare most euident argumentes. Your constant bearing and vpholding of the banner and enseigne of our redemption (the Image I meane of Christ crucified) against the enemies of his crosse: Your princely vvord cōmaunding a preacher, that opened his levvd mouth against the reuerent vse of the crosse in your priuate chappell, to retire from that vngodly digression vnto his text of holy scripture: Your vvell vnder∣standed lyking of the sobrest preachers, both alvvayes heretofore, and specially on good fry∣day last openly by vvord of thankes declared, vvhen one of a more temperate nature then the rest, in his sermon before your Maiestie confes∣sed the real presence: Your gracious permission vnto your vvhole people to see, to heare, to haue,
 and to read the defences, and proufes of the Ca∣tholike faith against the vnequall petitions of the contrary part: Your earnest zeale and tra∣uail to bring (if it might be) those disordered ministers vnto some order of decent apparell, vvhich yet they vvant the reason tapply them selues vnto. To conclude, your aduised staye from hasty and sharp persecution, your quiet bearing of your svvord vvithin the scabard, be∣ing so lovvdly cryed vpon of hote preachers to dravve it forth, the keping of your princely han∣des pure and vnspotted, hauing ben so often and so earnestly solicited vvith bloud to haue embrued the same.
These causes and argumentes haue moued me to dedicate this booke vnto your Maiestie. Neither haue I only herevvith ben moued thus to do, but also very many others your louing and faithfull subiectes ar vvith the same prouo∣ked to conceiue comfort and hope of a better e∣state for matters of religion to be sene in the church of England. For they trust that God vvho hath thus begonne, vvill happely bring all to good ende, and that, vvhereas he hath hither∣to stayd your Maiestie in this moderation vvhi∣ch vve see, and holden backe your princely han∣des from th'use of your svvorde against those of your subiectes, vvho stand in profession of the auncient and thuniuersall faith of all Christen∣dom
 (from vvhich no terrour of svvorde can re∣moue them): he vvill at length leade your Maie∣stie to a deepe consideration of these vveighty matters touching theuerlasting health of mans soule, and vvith his holy spirite frame in you such firme persuasion and conscience, as by no colour of eloquence, or pretence of scripture by any of these nevve preachers vsed, you shall be induced to beleue that mutation of faith and re∣ligion may in any vvise be admitted, sith that the church hath not erred, nor lacked the holy ghost the spirite of truth, these nine hundred yeres past according to Christes promise, and to theffect of his prayer made to his father for that behalfe. This vvhen they call to mynde, vvhich they do very oftē, they ar prouoked to loue you, to thanke God of you, and to praye for you, that alvvayes you geue eare to his secrete motions, and imploye such rare and singular gyftes, as he hath most abundantly geuen you, to his ho∣nour, to the defence of the catholike faith, to the maintenance of his church, to prefermēt of ver∣tue, correction of vice, suppressiō of errours and heresies.
Novv if your Maiestie vvill vouchesafe to re∣ad this Confutation, you shall see the crafty and vntrue dealinges of those vvho call them selues Gospellers, disclosed, their chiefe groundes ouer∣throvven, their best proufes disproued, their ma∣nifest
 lyes detected, their sundry errours confu∣ted, the truth declared, and the partes of that do∣ctrine proued true, vvhich the holy ghost hath taught and continevved in the church these nine hundred yeres, vvhich the authours of the Apo∣logie condemne for a time of blindnes, ignoran∣ce, superstition, and idolatrie, for a time in vvhi∣che (as they saye) the gospell failed, the light of Gods vvord vvas put out, the fonteines of the vvater of lyfe vvere quite dryed vp. In vvhich Confutation albeit much lesse is said (I graunt) vnto euery point, then might be said by men of greater learning, and much lesse also then my selfe could saye in a larger volume vvith longer time: yet ynough (I am assured) shall be founde therein to proue them deceiued and deceiuers, false teachers, lyers, backebiters, and slaunderers. So that, if in so small a booke as that is, they shal be founde to haue vttered no small number of errours, lyes, and slaunders: your excellent vvise∣dom may thereof iudge, vvhat store of such stuf∣fe is lyke to be founde in the vvhole lumpe of their nevve diuinitie.
In this doing if I shall seme to any ouer bolde and presumptuous, thexamples of good men may serue for mine excuse, folovving herein the steppes of sundry learned and holy fathers, that in this path haue trod me the trace, vvhose boo∣kes to their studie, or penne and yncke to their
 paper, I vvish my selfe vvere vvorthy to beare af∣ter them. For it is no nevv thing most gracious Soueraigne, learned men to dedicate their vvri∣tinges to Princes and great estates. And vvheras it vvere easy to name many of the primitiue church, as the blessed martyr S. Iustine, Apolli∣naris, Apollonius, Quadratus, Aristides and o∣thers, that gaue their bookes vvritten in defence of our Christian faith to the Romaine Empe∣rours, and likevvise sundry others, vvho dedica∣ted their defences of the catholike faith against the Arians to other Princes: those passed ouer vvith silence, here the rehersall of tvvo, vvho pre∣sented their bookes to noble Quenes, is most conuenient to my purpose. Cyrill that famous learned bishop of Alexādria, dedicated a booke, vvhich he had vvritten of the catholike faith, specially against the heresie of Nestorius, to Quenes, that is to saye, to the vvife and si∣sters of Theodosius the yonger, Emperour. Atticus bishop of Constantinople, vvrote a boo∣ke to the noble christian Quenes the daughters of Arcadius the Emperour, in vvhich he impug∣ned the heresie also of Nestorius. Novv if those learned and holy fathers offered their bookes vvritten in defence of Christiā faith against pay∣nimes and against heretikes to Romaine Prin∣ces, to christian Kinges, and also to noble Que∣nes: vvhat reason can be pretēded, vvhy I should
 not offer my booke conteining a defence of the same faith against errours and heresies, to your Maiestie being a Princesse of so good inclinati∣on, of so tried and famous Clemēcie, and other∣vvise of most noble and princely disposition?
Yea though no other reason ne argument to ta∣ke this enterprise moued me, to vvhom may the subiect so duly dedicate his labours, as to his So∣ueraigne dere lady and Prince? Or vvhere should truth almost smothered and oppressed seeke succour and defence, but vnder the name and protectiō of such, as through Gods dispensation by gyft of singular vvitte be inuited, and as it vvere lead by the hand to vnderstand it, by rare goodnes of nature to loue it, by sufficient habi∣litie to defend it?
Accept therfore most gracious Princesse I hū∣bly prostrate besech your excellēt Maiestie, the∣se my rude labours in fauorable part, and geue thē thestimatiō that the truth of the cause, that my faithfull dutie, that my seruiceable hart to your Maiestie, and not that the simple vtterance and smal learning of the vvorke deserueth. Also vnto the singular goodnes of God, vvhose great prouidence that ruleth all, hath appointed your Maiestie to gouerne in the vvorld at this tyme, reserue and yelde continually (as you haue done) your hart, your eares, your eyes euer open and free, to vnderstand, to heare, and to see his truth,
 And as an vsurie for your rare and singular giftes receiued at his hand, restore and bring vnto him (for his loue I ase it) but the applying and ben∣ding of your singular vvisedom and deepe consi∣deration vnto the roote and ground, frō vvhence these straunge doctrines grevve, vnto the practi∣se and meanes vvith vvhich they be mainteined and supported, vnto the fruit and successe that euery vvhere they hatch and bring forth: and by this litle said by me, consider vvith all, vvhat and hovv much might be said against euery part of it. And finding the roote nought els but co∣ueteousnes, ambition, malice, and carnal libertie, the shores and pillours that vphold it, but lyes and falsehed, vvrong and crafty argumentes, the fruites none other but first, ruyne and spoile, thē sedition and rebellion vvhere it is resisted, and therevvith furthermore robbery, sacrilege, and horrible murder, then finally such confusion of opinions and infinite varietie of doctrines, as breedeth in the people a mere paganisme, he∣thenish loosnes, and a very Epicurian atheisme, vvhere it is let runne: And perceiuing vvith all, (as I doubt not but you shall) hovv litle true rea∣son, substantiall learning, or effectuall argument there is to proue the particulers of it, the body and substance of these doctrines being founde to be but such a lumpe of vntruthes in dede, as your Maiesties great iudgement attending it can
 not but perceiue: then measure vnto it the iust and due credite that it deserueth. And as your policie shal permitte it, first bridle it as you may, then as oportunitie may be taken, reforme and roote it out, as the canker, that corrupteth vn∣doubtedly the mindes of all states and degrees more or lesse, at one time or other, as that, vvhi∣ch excluding all feare to offend, and conscience to sinne, induceth all boldnes and libertie to liue after our lyking, as that, vvhich disioynteth al po∣licie and right gouernement, as that, vvhich the vvisedom of no realme in accompt hauing try∣ed, can novv allovv to be continevved: to con∣clude, as that, vvhich hath in dede no right rea∣son to mainteine it, or any maner of truth either to beare the vvhole generally, or to defend the partes particulerly. Novv to your clemencie I ap∣peale for pardon in this case, if in this boldnes I passe that becommeth my person. But my mea∣ning is as good, as faithfull, and as dutifull, as I am bound, regarding chiefly (God is my record) next vnto the truth of the cause, your Maiesties honour and securitie in the place and seate that God hath called you vnto. Sure I am, that as your Maiestie shall herein duly serue and please God according to your calling, by procuring to your povver peace and concord to his church long trauailed and vexed: so shall you of the vvorld procure to your selfe thankes and fame
 immortall, by reducing your people now strag∣gled in hartes by difference of doctrines vnto an vnitie of myndes in the bonde of peace. So shall you dravve in one line vvith al christen Princes that be in Europe at this day of any name or re∣gard, according to the presidentes and examples of al your noble progenitours. So shal you ioyne your selfe to them, and be annombred among them, as your auncestours vvere. So shal you vvith Gods grace be assured of their vndoubted amitie and frendship in all cases requisite. Briefly so shal by your meanes the vvonted obedience and reuerent due feare of all subiectes tovvard their Soueraignes be reuiued, vvherof the vvorld findeth already great vvāt, and shortly more shall finde to the great griefe of all good mē, if God of his mercie moue not your hart, (vvhich resteth in his handes) to consider this matter in time. VVhich that your Maiestie may fortunat∣ly do, vvith long life, all honour, felici∣tie and prosperous successe, ac∣cording to my bounden dutie most ernestly I shal not ceasse to praie.
