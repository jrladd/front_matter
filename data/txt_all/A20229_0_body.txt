ALthough I was moste vn∣willing
that this poore Ta∣lent
and trauaile of myne,
should euer haue bene bro∣ched
abroade, and come to
light: both because it maye
seeme as a Candle lighted at no one day: as
also because many other mennes doinges
might more worthely a great deale haue
ben published, and committed vnto letters:
Yet because diuers which heard it preached
with a liuely voice, were very instant, yea,
and more then importunate with mee to
haue it published, vsing suche reasons as I
coulde not well gainesay, I did at the last
yeelde to their request, and so this vntime∣ly
fruite is come abroade, to be solde in o∣pen
markettes. Let no man be offended
that I haue not strained my selfe to flye an
high pitch, to fome out the froth of mans
wisdome, and to make a great shew of lear∣ning,
by blowing the bladder of vanity, till
it burst with swelling. For that is not my
vse. I seeke especiall the saluation of the

simple and ignorant, and therefore stoupe
downe to their reach and capacitie. There∣fore
I beseeche thee gentle Reader, accepte
my good meaning: Reade this with∣out
preiudice, like it as thou
profitest, so shalte thou
haue praise of God, &
comforte in thy
conscience.
