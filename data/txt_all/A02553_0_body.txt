SIr, that I haue made these my homely Apho∣rises publique, needes n other reason; but that, though the world is furni∣shed with other Writings, eun to satietie and surfet: yet, of these, which reduce Christianitie to practise,

there is (at least) sarcitie enough: wherin (yet) I must needs confesse, I had some eye to my selfe; for (hauing after a sort vowed this au∣tere course of iudgement and practise to my selfe) I thought it best to acquaint the world with it, that it might either witnesse my answerable proceeding, or check mee in my straying there-frō: by which meanes, so many men as I liue a∣mongst, so many monitors I shall haue, which shall point me to my owne rules, and vpbrayd me with my aber∣rations. Why I haue dedi∣ated thē to your name, cannot

be strange to any, that knows you, my Patron; and me, your Pastor: the regard of which bond, easily drew mee on to consider, that whereas my body, which was euer weake, began of ate to languish more; it would be not in-expedient (at the worst) to leaue be∣hind me this little onu∣ment of that great respect, which I (deseruedly) beare you: And i it shall please GOD to reprieue me, vntill a longer day; yet t shall not repent me, to haue sent this vnwoor∣thie scrowle, to wayte vp∣pon you, in your necessarie

absences; neither shall it be (I hope) bootlesse for you, to adioyne these my meane speculations, vnto those grounds of vertue, you haue so happily laid: to which, if they shall add but one scru∣ple, it shall be to me suffici∣ent ioy, contentment, re∣compence.
From your Halsted. Dec. 4.
