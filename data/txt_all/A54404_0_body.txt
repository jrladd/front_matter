SIR,
WHilst all Europe be∣sides,
lies now groan∣ing
under the VVeight
of a Crual VVar, and
sees on every side her
Cities sack't and spoil∣led;
her Fields laid
desolate, and her Pro∣vinces
exhausted both
of Blood and Treasure; England; alone, by Your
Royal Care, does now injoy a happy Tranquility and
sees Peace and Justice raign in all her Borders.

One would think, this Fortunate Isle were by heaven
set apart to prove a New Ark; amost safe Harbor
still ready to receive and shelter all the shatter'd re∣mains
of the VVreck't Ʋniverse: that it were a
perfect Epitome of the whole Earth, in which lies
concenterd all it produces of rich and most preci∣ous;
a Rock fixt and unmoveable in the midst of the
roughest VVaves, and highest Tempests: An
Earthly Paradice, inviron'd round about with San∣dy
Desarts; and, in fine, that England were, as
indeed she is, above all others in the VVorld, Hea∣ven's-Darling,
the Earths Delight, the Seas Sove∣raign
Queen; the Eye, the Heart, the Pearl of
the whole VVorld.
But, SIR, all these high Prerogatives; all these
choice Blisses She does injoy, seem'd little in Your
Royal Eyes: Your Vast Mind was not yet fully
satisfied, in having by Your Invincible Force made
her Triumph over her Fierce and Audacious Ene∣mies,
bringing them (in spight of their Obstina∣cy)
to Beg Peace at Your Royal Hands, and by
that happy Peace, fild the hearts of Your People
with Joy and Satisfaction: You would compleat the
Splendor and Magnificence of Your Imperial Seat,
by establishing within her stately VValls Your

Academy of Opera's, the fairest and most
charming of all Publick Showes; You have made
this Queen of Cities to become also the Center, the
Source of Love, Pleasures, and Gallantry; rai∣sing
her present Glory and Pomp to Pitch, capa∣ble
rather of creating Envy and Emulation in the
Proudest of her Neighbours, than being any more
jealous of them for their Greatness and Magnifi∣cence.
Your Majesty will doubtless find these First Re∣presentations
of Your Opera very defective:
But SIR, it dares flatter it self with hopes that
You will pardon its faults, and consider that the
Academy that executes the same is yet an Infant,
a new-born Beauty, whose Features and Linea∣ments
are scarce come to their shape and pro∣portion;
but, cannot fail growing to Per∣fection
in her due time and age, provided You daign
own her for Your Creature, and afford her Your
Royal Care and Protection? These Gracious Fa∣vors,
SIR, She humbly, and with a most profound
Respect and Veneration, begs at Your Royal
Hands; with a sincere Protestation, that her
chiefest Application and Study shall ever be to
strive to the uttermost of her Power, to contribute

to Your Diversion, and that she will gather together
Your Palms, Your Laurels, and Your Royal Mirtles,
into VVreaths and Garlands of Triumph to Crown
Your Sacred Head with, as being,
SIR,
