Honoured Sir.
'TIS now about six yeers since, that, at your Desire, and for your own private use, I penned the following short, and plain Directions; your appre∣hensions of your approching change being the occasion. For though, God hath been pleased to exempt you from very many of the usual Conco∣mitants of old Age (so that you have not known, nor do to this day, what they mean, by your own experience;) yet the very Number of your Years, and the weakness you find creeping on you, (though, through Gods mercy, joyned with
a good measure of Health) cannot but mind you of your long Home, (Ecc. 12.5.) and give you to un∣derstand that there is but a little of your Glass to run. And as I was, by your desire, put upon the Writing of the ensuing little piece, so am I now, upon the Printing of it. And if it may prove more publickly useful, than I first de∣sign'd, I shall have cause to ac∣knowledg the Divine Goodness therein, and to bless God for it. Now the Lord graciously help you in your preparations for your Eternal State; (which you do well to be much thinking of;) grant unto you, that you may find mercy in that day: (2 Tim. 1.18.) mul∣tiply his Favours Spiritual and Temporal upon your posterity, and make them all great blessings, in their several stations: That being happy Instruments of Gods Glory
in this World, they may be Vessels of Glory in that which is to come. This is the unfained and daily Prayer of
Sir
