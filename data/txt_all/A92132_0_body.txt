My Lords,
I Thought it so very incon∣gruous for one in my humble Station to offer any thing to the World, that indeed nothing but the Com∣mand of your Lordships could have obliged

me to publish the mean Discourse I pre∣sumed to preach before You. But since You were pleased to give me leave to pre∣fix your Great Names to it, I humbly Present it to You again, assuring my self, that by that Means it will be the more likely to promote the Design I had in Preaching it, and which I believe You had in Commanding it to be Printed: Which if it may in any measure obtain, I presume to say I shall so far be a Bene∣factor to my Country and to the Church of God, and be always Thankfull to Your Lordships for giving me the Ad∣vantage of being so; ever remaining
My Lords,
