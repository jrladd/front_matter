MADAM,
THe Duty I owe to your Ladyship and the rest of

your Noble Familie com∣mands more than this Booke is able to express; but since ill fate hath made me alto∣gether uncapable of any wor∣thy Return of your Love and bounty, be pleased to ac∣cept this as a Signal of what I am obliged to. I would not willingly dye while I live, nor be quite forgotten when I am dead; therfore have I sent forth This book, to testifie to the candalous World that I do not alogether spend my Time idle∣ly;

somewhat of benefit it may be to the young La∣dies and Genlewomen; and such I wish it; (however) it may serve to passe a∣way their youthfull time, which otherwaies might be worse employed.
The Honour your Lady∣ship does me in accepting the Dedication of it, will, I hope, cherish their belief, and encourage their Practice, aud assuredly it doth adde

very much to the Obligati∣n of,
Madam, Your Honours most Faithful, Real, and most Humble Servant,
