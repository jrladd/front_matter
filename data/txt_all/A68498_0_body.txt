ALthough good will & per∣fect friendship is not to be requited nor bought with monie, yet such is the excel∣lencie thereof, that it is of∣tentimes requited with some ingratitude, wherwith the vertue is much more beaw∣tified, as it was with the good & wise king Don Alonso of Spaine: who being giuen to vnderstand, that one vnto whom he had done great good by preferring him to ho∣nour, besides many liberall gifts, was verie vnthankfull for the same. He answered in a milde manner, that a great good turne is neuer requited without some ingratitude, euen so I may compare you in this happines vnto him, & in vnhappines my selfe vnto the other, who for much good haue returned but ill. Wherfore I am the bolder, being so well acquainted with your good dispositiō, to shew my selfe thankfull, being well assu∣red that you cannot thinke of my seruice e∣uill, seing (as I haue said) you haue alwaies doone well, being deliuered vnto mee by

Maister Boldley a small Spanish Pam∣phlet of the late Discouerie of the 15. Pro∣uinces in the west Indians, which the Spa∣niardes intituled The New Mexico. Knowing your Christian and louing care vnto the common weale of your countrie, in wishing vnto our nation, the knowledge that belongeth vnto all good Christian people, that nothing bee hidden whereas some profit may be reaped. And although this small Treatise be the least of this ar∣gument that euer was translated, and my skill much lesse in the dooing thereof, yet being well considered and noted, there may haply grow thereby more profit vnto those which intend to reap the benefit then in some other bookes of greater discoueries, because it reuealeth more riuers, coasts, and people, towards our northern parts then o∣thers heretofore haue done. Thus assured of your good liking and the accepting of my good will, wherein although I haue vsed a worse English phrase thē others would do, yet I haue kept (so neere as I can) the very Spanish sence: crauing pardon, I commit you to God & my Pāphlet to the good Rea∣der. London this 13. Aprill 1587.
