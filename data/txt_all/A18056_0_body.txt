Worshipfull Sirs,
INgratitude, was a sin even vnto the Hea∣thens so odious, that Periander among the Corinthians made this law, that if any in a Common weale prove vnthankefull hauing re∣ceiued a benefit, he was to bee put to death, and as the reliques of
 Gods Image in them: soe nature in the sensible creatures hath in∣grafted thankefulnesse, to passe by those presidents produced by Historians, which may seeme in∣credible; the Naturalists obserua∣tion of the Merlyon not to prey on the Larke which hath giuen warmth to her cold feet, is re∣markeable: And the spirit of God in Scripture hath plentifully in∣ioyned it. That I may proue my selfe therefore instructed in this duty, not by nature onely, but by grace, in this glorious light of the Gospell; I present vnto your view and patronage, these poore indeavours, the fruit of a thanke∣full heart, expect you cannot a
 loftie stile or curious phrase, for I take not vppon mee to instruct, but onely to remember: your curteous acceptation I doubt not of, from the former experience of your worthinesse. Surely if the poore Persians water in a potsheard was exceptable to the Emperour; and an Apple from a poore Pessant was received by Artaxerzes a great Prince; if Alexander tooke curteously wa∣ter from a common Souldiers hel∣met; and our Sauiour crowned the poore widdow with everlasting prayse for two Mites to the Trea∣sury: your generous dispositions will sparingly censure and curte∣ously accept these my poore la∣bours;
 which howsoeuer, they bee your worships, and so is the Au∣thor.
