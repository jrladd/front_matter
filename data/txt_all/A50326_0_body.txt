Right Honourable, &c.,
THIS Discourse, at first Preach'd by your Appointment, is now Presented to you in a more publick manner, in Obedience to your Commands. The Defects of it, I acknowledge to be such, as render it very unworthy of the Patronage to which it is Dedicated; but how little soever it deserves your Pro∣tection, yet it has one Argument to plead for it self, That it needs it: An Argument, which, as it seldom fails to obtain your Favour, so I hope now it will the rather pre∣vail, because it is in Submission to your Order, that it is brought under that necessity: For tho the blame
of its faults be imputable only to its Author, yet the Publication of it is wholly yours. I am too sensi∣ble, how ill I have, in this mean Performance, answer'd the Character given of me, to your Honourable Com∣pany, by some Worthy Members of it, my Incomparable Friends: Persons of such Improved Knowledge and Ex∣quisite Judgment, that it may perhaps be wonder'd how they should come to be so mistaken; but you will be the less surprized, when you consider, That it was a mistake arising from those Virtues in them, which are so Il∣lustrious in your whole Society, Friendship and Gene∣rosity. However, this Advantage I shall make of their kind Error, to use it as an Admonition, what sort of Person he ought to be, and how well qualified, who should pretend to the honour of being your Chaplain. And thus far I hope I may assure you, That, what I want in Learning or Abilities, I will endeavour, by the Grace of God, to make up and supply, by Diligence, and Probity, and Zeal, for the Service of God, and of your Honoura∣ble Society, in this Important Station, in which your great Goodness has placed me. I am,
MY LORD, and GENTLEMEN,
