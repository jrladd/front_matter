Dear Sir,
It hath pleased the Lord, of late to do with you, as of old with his eminent Servant Ezek viz To take away from you theEzek. 24.16. desire and delight of your eyes Your dear, dearest Wife, your self in ano∣ther skin, the t'otherAnime divi∣dium med. half of your soul, is gone down to the Chambers of darkness. When I consider, the closeness of your Rela∣tion, the dearness of your Affection, I cannot but grant, the deprivation of such a Wife, to be a sharp dispensation; a bitter cup indeed; But yet it hath this to sweeten it, that 'tis handed out by a wise, soveraign, gracious Father; a God, that doth, and will do, what he pleases, and none can stay his hand, or say unto Him,Dan. 4.35. what dost Thou. And, Sir, give me leave to tell you, I do not, dare not, look on you, as such a piece of presumptuous
clay, as dares give check to your great Pot∣ter. You are none of those proud and impa∣tient Worms, that will turn again, when a God treads either on you or yours, No, but rather, you have learnt good old Eli's Epi∣phonema, 1 Sam. 3.38. It is the Lord; or which is more, with Job, not only to submit unto, but even toJob. 1.21 bless A taking as well as a giving God. It were easie to expatiate. But then, the Gate would be too wide for the City. As there∣fore the Voice to Austin, Tolle & Lege, so I to you, Read, Consider; and in Gods strength endeavour so to improve the Truths herein contained, that it may appear to your Conscience, that you have not so much lost, as parted, only for a time, with the dearly beloved of your soul: and that the time is coming, yea hastning, when you shall happily meet again, and for ever repose your selves in that center of Bliss, the bo∣som of Christ; yea, and so meet, as never to part more.
Alh. Lumbard-street, Octob. 29. 1660.
