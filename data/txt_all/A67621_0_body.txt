May it please your Lordship
THough Dedications as much as Prefaces may seem formal imperti∣nencies; yet they cease to be such when the Patronage it as the Broad Seal of England, to Authorize and li∣cence the Examination of the Li∣bertine; though in such method as may seem unkind and unnatural to Humanity in the discovery of Reasons defect, and exposing it to
the publick vieu naked and intoxi∣cated. This way of arguing is so far justifiable as it is more necessary at some times to declare that men are mad, sools, and bewitch'd in their search for Religion, than to flatter them with soft compellations of men of sober minds, dispos'd for reasonable service, and critically wise to Salvation. This method is also commended by Christ's pra∣ctise, who disputing with the Phari∣sees and Opinionative formalists of the Jewish Church, answers their questions with questions, and at the same time confounded them whilst he inform'd them by retort∣ing their folly, and turning the edge of their own troublesom queries on themselves; which was the most
proper way to silence a Pragmatical Jew. The present state of Religion as it is to be found in factions minds makes this method seasona∣ble for this age, which is ful of Rea: soning Zelots (the secular Fana∣ticks) who must be Catechiz'd in the first Elements of their natural Religion, though in a stile as rough as that by which Arnobius discovered the folly of the Gentiles.
These considerations, I hope, may render this bold address more par∣donable, and the Tract less liable to censure, which being presum'd I cannot but think it necessary, that I declare which were the first motives which conmended the task to my thoughts, and what directed it to your most Honourable Patronage
Libertinism exalting it self above Sacred Authority, and Ʋsurping its power, pleading Reasons claim and right to the spiritual Judica∣ture; and it being seasonably checkt by that Oration which made Eng∣land (in its Representatives) its Auditor, when it captivated both ear and mind with sweetness and vigour, and (as it is the property of Eloquence) commanded whilst it perswaded: I thought it would not appear an impertinent peice of cu∣riosity in a private person to inquire into, and examin the composition of that Leaven with which Faction swells, and turbulently serments.
I was also more confident in this address to your Lordship, whilst I consider'd that some of the matter
of these papers, when spoken, as duty call'd me, as well as written, found encouragement from the Right Honourable Heneage Earl of Winchilsea my very good Lord; presuming they might find the same favourable entertainment whilst they apply themselves to the same name, which is now famous both for Forreign and Domestick admini∣stration of the affairs of the King∣dom; For it is no contradiction in my hopes to conclude that Souls may be allied as well as bodies, and that there may be Affinity of Opinions as well as Persons: and the same sin∣gular Candour and Humanity may run in the same blood as Hereditary to the Family.
This Task was also encouraged
as necessary, whilst I considerd that several interested persons cloakt their practise under the thin film of a pretended Religion, which might exempt them from the imputation of being Atheists (which is a name so odious as would effectually stifle their designs and make their pra∣ctise nauseous) and seem'd careless whether Christian Religion, as it is said of Astraea, return'd again to heaven; so that the world was pos∣sessed with a belief that they ac∣knowledged the Deity which they would have prov'd and worship∣ped by their rational Method.
Now that such might not impose upon credulous minds, by perswad∣ing them they are truly Religious. I thought it proper to unmask them,
by shewing that they are so far from being so, that by that method they cannot intitle themselves to the names of Theists.
These men also pleas'd themselves, or at least others (with an empty name of a new kind of faith, which they did no more understand than the Exorcist doth the Sacred words abus'd in his Charm) making it natural Reason with an object brought nigher by Revelation, and to supply its defect have impudently medled with the object God him∣self representing him as a Proteus to be ador'd in several shapes, or as a Picture to be seen and worshipped in divers forms according to the various situation of the Spectators, by which arbitrary Transsiguration of Christ in each mans brain he
will be as much abus'd in mens phancies as the Deity was in the Heathens Idolatrous way of worship. It need not be call'd to your Lord∣ships mind that such extravagant liberty will exceed all former Her esie and schism, which seem more modest, for they were never contracted into a more narrow compass than an As∣sembly, or congregation, but this makes (in its Ecclesiastical Anar∣chy) each Zelot an independent-Church
But I was not only led to this Task by the wild projects of Extra∣vagant brains, but by the practice of men of more sober minds, who (per∣haps) observing the predominant humour and prevailing prejudices of some against Ecclesiastical Au∣thority, as Tyrannical over Consci∣ences,
out of their great zeal for the Church, and Christian resoluti∣on (like Commanders disarm'd in sight snatch a Sword from their Enemies hand, when ill success de∣prived them of their own) dispute with the Atheist upon his own prin∣ciples and fight against him with his arguments, which way hath been little succesful. And it is no great wonder, for Divine Authority (which is excluded in such disputes) sets the edge on the spiritual sword, & is the strength of that arm which weilds it. All natural arguments so managed are as some vitious Syllo∣gisms which have all the propositi∣ons, but concluded nothing. But this being not so easily believ'd as said in This Treatise, Reason and Religion dispute their rights to be
judg in spiritual matters. This method is altogether necessary: for the Reasoner will never believe he is lawfully condemn'd, if he have not liberty to bring in all natural evidence in the Trial, which large concession will make him know the vanity of liberty falsly so call'd, and subjugate his unruly mind, playing like a fish which is wearied with the line of his vain imaginations, who scorn'd all ties of Laws and Religion. As subjection to Governours is never more effectually recommended by any mere rational argument than that which comes with this conside∣ration of the necessity of bring obe∣dient to Magistrates, because hu∣mane nature is not so able to pro∣vid for it self in solitude as in So∣cieties;
So the extravagant Rea∣soners in Religion are not any way better reduced to obedience to Ec∣clesiastical Authority, than by contemplating the vanity of their own imaginations. For that prospect of their own ignorance will make Reason so obsequious and tame, that though Ecclesiastical Laws (as the Greek Law-giver saies of Laws in general) are lookt on as Cobwebs; yet they will not think it their interest to break them.
This consider'd, I hope may sup∣plant all censure which might con∣demn this way of arguing as preju∣dicial to Religion by rendring ar∣guments, which were design'd to fortifie it, weakned by too severe an inquisition, for this method doth no more violence to Religion, than a
Chirurgion doth to his Patient whilst he stretches the Sinews in order to set a bone which was out of its place. Neither shall I fear that these Papers will be lookt upon as vainly speculative, seeing the Dedication directs the Reader to so eminent an Example, which alone (though the Church was not pro∣tected by civil power and truth na∣ked in that sense which the factious Adversary would have it) is able to win practice and engage all Chri∣stian obedience, which is desired and design'd, (so far as these Papers can promote it) by
My Ld.
