IT is the glorie of all temporall power to main∣taine the glory of Christ,

and so consequently to confound Antichrist, When, therefore, the pro∣uidence of God sends tem∣porall Princes into the world, such as can giue any intelligēce toward the dis∣couering this Antichrist, cannot be thought ouer∣hastie in presenting the same vnto them. Indeed, the intelligence which this little Booke can do in such kind of businesse must needs be thought

little; notwithstanding, it was a little pibble-stone that bored the Front of Goliah, when the vali∣ant men of Israel were afraid to encounter him. Also the littlenesse of it may be a meanes to in∣duce Gods little ones, the sooner to begin to turne the leaues thereof as they shall begin to awake vnto the day-light of vnder∣standing. Which happy time of our Princes awa∣king,

It resoluing to wait; the Author shall in the meane time beseech the Almighty to visit him daily with the light of His countenance, and as his Abilities shall grow, to allure them into the most pleasant paths of His most Royal seruice.
