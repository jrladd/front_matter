Honourable Sir:
HAuig in the time of my residence in Virginia (as it is true my imployment then inuited mee thereunto) collected for my owne vse and benefit, some few occur∣rents and accidents, which are obuious in all new imployments, a thing which perhaps but few regard there to busie themselues with, and fewer heer to peruse: I resolued indeed on∣ly to delight my selfe, and som who I am bound to be thankefull vnto in that kinde with the vn∣worthy view of them, the rather, because I haue seen many publications & impressions of those affairs, by those, whose books I should be proud to beare after them: but such is the peruersenes of mankinde, such their incredulity of euery thing, saue what their eies tell them to b true: yea, such their backwardnes in the pursuit of ho∣rable enterprises, that though there should bee no end of writing, but euery day should drawe foorth his line, and euery line his reall encou∣ragement, as mine may in the state of the Coo∣ny, as it now standeth, it were hard to say whe∣ther

one of so many thousands as abound in Eng∣land, might be thereby moued to ioine with o∣thers right worthyly disposed to become a har∣y and deuoted furtherer of an action so noble, as is this, which thing if I faile in effecting, I shall not loose much labour, since when I vndertook this taske, I imagined no such thing: but meer∣ly my owne delight and content. It shall be re∣ward enough for me to expresse my indeauours there, though not equall with the best, yet not idly mispent.
I labour not to seduce or betray any to an acti∣on or imployment, wherein once personally ingaged, they should haue any cause to blame me, neither would I force the helpe of any mans purse, more then voluntary, if I could beyond my art, vse such effectuall perswasions.
There are enough in my opinion, and those the worthyest of England already vnited, as the way is now laid downe, to perfect this businesse, whose indeuours, if they proceed without, black slyding, and therein persist some fewe yeers lon∣ger, shall be requited and paid with such treble interest, as it shall not repent him that is now most cold in the pursuit, to haue refused more Competitors to be sharers in the returnd profit.
Your noble selfe Sir, euer emulous of vertue, and honourable Enterprises, should shine to the world more noble in the vpholding of this im∣ployment, though it apeared, as in the begin∣ning, full of discouragement, which neuerthe∣lesse,

I know your self rests so assured is now more neer, then euer to perfection. Your in∣nate and habituall vertue needs no spurre, your honourable indeauours well witnesse the same: would God (as is yours) al mens offrings, though not so ample, were so free, so hartely sacrificed: then coud they not thus long haue wanted their rewards, perhaps for no other nd detained, but to make others, a thing which God professeth to loue and delight in, more cheeful giuers. Ac∣cept (worthy Sir) this vnworthy Treatise, the bst tstimony of my gratuity, which as yet my disabilities may render. Trueth shall shroud and patronize it, from the maleuolent detracting multitude; whose blame though it incurre their shame and imputation, it scorns, and returns vn∣to them.
My zeale to the Action, though I may seeme to haue forsaken it, giues mee the heart to pub∣lish, what I know to the world: To your slfe particularly your own worth, and dearts to me, irrequitable, graunt but that fauourable accep∣tation, which euer accompanies your worth; and I shall euer acknowledge my selfe wholy yours, in hope wherof I conclude with my seruice, & rest
