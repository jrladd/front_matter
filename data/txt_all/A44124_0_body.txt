My Lord,
WHEN this Sermon was Preached before You, Your Lordship and the Worthy Gen∣tlemen of Your Society were pleased by many kind and obliging Expressi∣ons to signifie your favourable accep∣tance of it, and to let me know that it was your desire it might be made publick: Which, I confess, was somewhat of a surprise to me. Yet
I considered, that I ought to look up∣on the repeated declaration of your Lordships pleasure, and the concur∣rent Vote of so many judicious per∣sons, in the nature of a command; and have therefore chosen by this act of submission to pay that deference which is due to your judgment, there∣by giving the best assurance I can, that I am,
My Lord,
