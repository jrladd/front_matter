My Lord,
THE Character of true No∣bilitie
is sacred, and inde∣leble;
that Yours is such,
needeth no Testimony, the World

bearing witnesse to Your Honoura∣ble
Mind, upon which all other ac∣cesse
of Titles wait like a fair Train
of Attendance, not Ornaments,
Your own Virtue giving them lustre,
and enterteining them as Rewards
payd down to Your Person, and
Merit.
This Principle, gave me boldnesse
to make this approach to Your Lord∣ship,
and not without some design in
my Ambition, to renew my self to
Your smile, who have enjoyed the
happinesse (many yeares since) to
kisse Your hand, and to observe with
Admiration the Beauties that shin'd
upon Your Youth, which as they
gained upon Time, so they have grown

above the prejudice of Opinion, and
improv'd their Maturitie by the Ear∣linesse
of their Spring.
But my humble duty (my Lord)
at this fortunate hour to attend You,
cometh not alone, it bringeth a Pre∣sent,
such as my weak condition could
reach to; a Poem, one, that wear∣eth
no Ribbands in the forehead; not
so much as warranted by Applause;
for it happened to receive birth, when
the Stage was interdicted, and want∣ed
that publique Seal which other
Compositions enjoyed; Though it
hath been read and honour'd with the
Allowance of some men, whose Opi∣nion
was as acceptable to mee, as the

Vote of a smiling Theater.
But this is not to prescribe to your
Honour, whom I have by this Ap∣plication
made my Iudge (should
You wave the Patron) and from
whom there lyes no Appeal.
If your Honour, descending
from your higher Contemplations,
vouchsae to look upon these Papers,
though Your Iustice should condemn
them, it would bee their Reputa∣tion
to fall by so Honourable a Sen∣tence:
But if they happen to ob∣tain
Your Lordships favour, that
they may live, your Name will
not onely bee a powerfull defence to
them, but a lasting Record of

Honour upon the Composer, whose
heart is full of Devotions to your
Lordship, and ambitious of no greater
addition, than to be known,
My Lord,
