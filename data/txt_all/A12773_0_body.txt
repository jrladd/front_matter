SIR, that you may see that I am not al∣waies ydle as yee thinke, though not greatly well occupied, nor altogither vndutifull, though not precisely of∣ficious, I make you present of this sim∣ple pastorall, vnworthie of your high∣er conceipt for the meanesse of the stile, but agreeing with the truth in circumstance and mat∣ter. The which I humbly beseech you to accept in part of paiment of the infinite debt in which I acknowledge my selfe bounden vnto you, for your singular fauours and sundrie good turnes shewed to me at my late being in England, and with your good countenance protect a∣gainst the malice of euill mouthes, which are alwaies wide open to carpe at and misconstrue my simple meaning.
I pray continually for your happinesse.
 From my house of Kilcolman,
the 27. of December. 1591.
