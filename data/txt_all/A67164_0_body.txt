Honoured Sir,
YOur late dear Consort when she dis∣cern'd the time of her departure to draw near, desired that what was to be preached at her Funeral, might first entertain her own retired Meditations in the Chambers of Death, while her Soul was dres∣sing up for Eternity. But since it pleas'd the Allwise God, to take her unto happiness, be∣fore I could minister to her Piety herein, I now bring these Leafs to lay upon her Herse. I confess she deserv'd the greatest honour that can be done to her Memory, and mine is the least. But because the design relates to one who was so near a Portion of your self, I am willing to hope that you will give it some en∣tertainment, and favourably resent my wri∣ting

your Name at the Entrance. No body sure, can expect accuracy and fineness from one who is but an Underbuilder in God's House. Yet how mean soever it appears, I must ac∣knowledge with all thankfulness, that the lei∣sure I have for this and my other Studies, together with most of my Support, I owe to your Bounty and Favour. And besides my publickly declaring so, I can make no other re∣turn, but to beg of God Almighty, that he will please to prolong your days upon Earth, for the good of his Church, the benefit of your Country; and the more particular com∣fort of your Relations and Friends: and at the end of a Life full of Years and Honour, to receive your Soul into that Heavenly Choir, whither she is already gone, with whom you will rejoyce to sit and sing Allelu∣jahs for evermore: which is the sincere and affectionate Prayer of
SIR,
