Dear and much honoured Sir,
IF my appearing thus in print be no wonder, it need be none to your self, or any that knows us, That I prefix your name to these papers: you well know with what fear and sense of unfitness for it I undertook any part of the charge of this great congregation (wherein God hath so long a time to mutuall com∣fort continued you) upon the Death of that eminent servant of his, and
Dear Brother of Yours Mr. Hol∣linworth, as judging the place too publick for one of my mean Abilities, though incouraged there∣unto by your affectionate invitati∣on and the unanimous call of the congregation; And that I should yet make this adventure to be more publick, You are not un∣acquainted with, (being a princi∣pall accessary to) the Occasion of it. The importunity of fundry of this people, whom the Lord hath made dear to your selfe, as to me, Headed and set on by your respective Letter, having much against my own inclination and former intention pressed this from mee. Their request was to you in the first place, who have been their antient Pastour, to have
revised and published some of your many Elaborate discourses, where∣of they have been made pertakers in your constant ministry amongst them, that they might have had the pro∣fit of your former paines by this meanes revived unto them. You have declined, at least at present waved, the motion, upon the too just grounds of your age and some bodily weaknesses, which might make the work somewhat tedious and more burthensome to you: I cannot say much of my bodily strength, at least that it exceeds, or is proportionable to the constant burthen of this great Congre∣gation, (wherein I should bear a part with you) the Work now lying upon three of us, which heretofore hath had Seaven to un∣dertake
it) and to which you are so ready to express a tender Testi∣mony upon all occasions (which I thankfully acknowledge) that I should for that be lesse excusea∣ble. And on the contrary, my want of Age, and that gravity, which should have put authority upon such a Work, might have plea∣ded much for me. But since it is come to this, and that I am not like to be excused (as you are, as yet) from Printing, you will pardon me, If I ex∣cuse not your name in this Dedication. It may be of no smal advantage (and so of no little weight with me in this Application of my self & these papers to you) that being conscious to my self of my own meanness every way, and the little that my own name can add to the acceptance of this Discourse, be
the matter never so of the grea∣test and highest Importance, that yet I appear to the World, under the notion of any speciall relation to you, sufficiently known for your eminency in birth, place, parts, service and printed labours, which yet had been sufficiently manifest without this by our affectionate lines, which I have made bold to publish herewith: But being re∣ally sensible of your many kind∣nesses to me, and much refreshed in my poore indeavours in this Congregation, in your comfortable and intirely affectionate conde∣scention to, and conjunction with me, I could do no less, then in this publike appearance, make this known to the World of you by this De∣dication, as a thankfull acknowledg∣ment
of my heartiest respects unto you. May the Lord have mercy on us in continuing your health still unto you, and preserving you long a∣mongst us, as an Ornament and rich blessing to this place, an helpfull and usefull instrument to this part of his Church, and a sin∣gular part of the comfort of his life, Who is
