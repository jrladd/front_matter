To the reuerend Ministers, Elders and Deacons of the French congregation in Middelborough,

vvisheth peace and saluation.
HOnorable bretherē, the desire which I haue to testi∣fie, how much I esteeme my selfe beholding vnto your worships, because when I came first out of he bottomelesse pitte of darkenesse, yee haue not

onely receiued me very friendly, but also entertained hether to with your liberality. This desire moueth me to giue vnto your worship, not any thing worthy for such a benefit, but that which I can onely giue at this present, beseeching your worship to re∣gard more the affection of the giuer, then the smalnesse of the gift. I send vnto you my reclamation from Poperie, done publicke∣lie in the citty of Leyden, out of the which God by his infinit mer∣cy hath brought me, vnto a sound resolution and confession of the true religion, for to liue and dye in it, God which hath begun his worke in me accomplish the same also, and giue vnto your honourable bretheren, daylie increase in scripture and corporall giftes, and by the same grace bestowed on me, to call those which are yet drowned in the impurities of Poperie, and liue in the mid∣dest of a Babilonicall confusion, Leyden the 14. of Iune, 1601.
