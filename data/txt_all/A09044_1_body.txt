DEáre Patronesse of my haplesse lamentati∣ons; guided by the sterne of thy beauty, which hath the ful commaund of my hart, and wearied with tiranyzing ouer my selfe, in forcible suppressing the agonies of my afflicted minde, by smothering the feruen∣cie of my desires, in the cloudie center of dumme silence: at the last with the raging violence of a stopped streame, for wante of course in the intelligible parte of my minde; I am driuen to ouer-flowe the bankes of reason, and in de∣spite of my selfe to yeilde vp the raynes to vncontrouled desire; which insuing Poem willfullie manyfest vnto you, with the obseruation of my coed fancyes: Written vppon a dreame, wherein me thou I heard a voyce from

a Cloude pronouncing these wordes ensuing. Maister hy desires or liue in despaire, and albeit I helde dreames but phantasies, which commonly doe fall out by contraries; my fortunes being so far inferior to my thoughts, maketh me to doubt the sequell thereof. Yet noble beautie of this sea-bound Region disdayne not to reade ende, and pittie if you will vouchsafe to mity gate the heauines of my martyred heart, which neere stifled with the dampe of my discontentments, lamentably beggeth for comfort at your handes.
