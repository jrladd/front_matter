For 'twas composed for the benefit of a place, in which I am now happily fixed by your ge∣nerous and uncorrupted Charity, and in bestow∣ing of which, you made no other demands, be∣side a promise under my hand of living on the place, and taking care of the People. So far were you from making Merchandise of Souls, that you esteem'd your right of Patronage▪ on∣ly as a sacred trust, for which you must give account to Almighty God; And may this pi∣ous Example never want its followers. I de∣sire that this Dedication may remain as a last∣ing

May all the Blessings of Heaven attend your Person, your Vertuous Lady, and every mem∣ber of your Family; May your Ʋnwearied As∣siduity in serving your Country never want encouragment; May you continually enjoy the Advantages of doing good here on Earth, and receive a glorious reward for all in a bet∣ter World. These, Sir, shall be the constant Prayers of
