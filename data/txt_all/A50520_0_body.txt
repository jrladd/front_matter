MADAME,
THere is so great a distance between the Meanness of a Comedian, and the Majesty of a Crown'd Head, that the presumption of this Address may occasion some, to charge me with an Oblivion of the former, and want of reverence to the Sacrednesse of the latter. 'Tis true, at the first blush, it might appear so; but I have this self-encouragement, that my applications are made to a Greatnesse surrounded with Goodnesse; to an equal transcendency of Power and Piety: and These regard not so much the Merit, as the Humility of the Supplyant.
But, MADAME, when I finde represented in this small Piece, the Triumphs of Divine Love over all the most alluring Concerns of Sublunary Happinesse; When I reflect on a tender Virginity, defying all the charming enjoyments of this World, nay what's most harsh to the delicacy of that fair sex, Torture; When I see enflam'd Youth, by an Heroick contempt, spurning the greatest Plea∣sures, to court the Cross of Christ: When I observe the
sudden, yet efficacious Operations of that Winde which bloweth where it listeth, converting a Saul into a Paul, a Persecutor into a Sufferer: And lastly, when I consider, how the want of an humble Perseverance (like an unex∣pected Wrack within the Port) made way to the Aposta∣sie of one ready to lay hold on the Crown of Martyrdom: When these Reflexions fill my thoughts, how should I con∣ceive any Patronage too great for so great Examples.
These, MADAME, were the Inducements pre∣vail'd with me, to offer them to that of your Sacred Majesty: For, where should Innocency, Vertue, Piety, and all the other amazing heights of Christian life, expect to be more kindly entertain'd, than where they are in the highest degree practis'd? Whilest then they are admitted into so Royall a Presence, if I can but press in, as the meanest Attendant, after so Noble a Train, it will be only with this hope, that Your Majesty may, though at a great distance shed some providential Graces upon,
MADAME,
