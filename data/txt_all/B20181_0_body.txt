MY LORD,
IT is impossible for me to find an Excuse to paliate my in∣tolerable Boldness; and I wish this Paper and Characters were capable to express the Confusion I resent in my Soul for offering at your Altar a Sacrifice so unworthy of your Lordships acceptation, though the first Fruits of my untill'd Soil. Other Men seek the approbation and protection of those
persons to whom they Present their Wri∣tings, but I despairing of the one, cannot hope for the other: For I have need rather of a protection against your Lordships just Indignation, than to seek a Refuge against other Men. But, my Lord, I will resign my self wholly to your Honours Will, know∣ing that you exceed no less in Bounty, than I do in Temerity. The reading of this Vo∣lume, cannot but be troublesom, as well as unprofitable to your inlightned Mind: For besides the imperfection of the Language, I am sensible that your tranquil Soul cannot take delight in the ruine of Empires, the destruction of Towns, the disorder of the Elements, the misfortunes of Princes, the distress of virtuous Ladies; nor in seeing the whole Frame of Nature in Confusion, and Fortune blindly rewarding Vice, and punishing Innocence; exalting upon the Throne Slaves and Ʋsurpers, and precipi∣tating from it, their Sovereigns. But, my Lord, if these Transactions cause admira∣tion as well as pity; and if the vicissitude
of Fortune is incomprehensible, in that she bestows and ravisheth from Men her gifts almost at the same time, and without order or regard to their merits: How shall we not admire those Men, who, wiser than she, prevent all her blows, not only for them∣selves, but chiefly for others; and who be∣ing employed for the publick good, find and preserve order in a Chaos of affairs. The greatest part of Europe, my Lord, is sensible of the Obligations they have to venerate your Honour; and when the For∣tune of the two greatest Kingdoms thereof lay in your hands, there was nothing but sweetness and concord seen in those dayes: But when Mars display'd his Standards, then it was that your Lordships great Mag∣nanimity, Zeal and Integrity appeared for the interest of His Most Sacred Majesty, and your Countrey, whom you so worthily and generously served. Holland is an eye-wit∣ness also of the greatest prudence that ever could shine in their Favour: and if Justice guided your Lordship, Mercy had no less
hand in it; which was seen in stenching a wound that had bled so long, to the loss of the two most glorious Maritime Countries; in which your Lordship made Peace and Tranquility flourish, and consequently Plenty and Happiness. But, my Lord, these are but some effects of your Honours universal perfections, which the Muses would not suffice to rehearse. And when France and Holland saw your Lordship, they only had a short contemplation of that abridgement of Virtue which England possesseth to the en∣vy of all the World; and which is not only venerated by strangers in their Countrey, but also in this; and I being of the number, suf∣fer me, my Lord, to tell you, that we should be guilty of the blackest, and most horrid in∣gratitude, if we did not acknowledge, by our Acclamations and Services, your Lord∣ships Favours. But I dare not extend my self upon your Lordships Panegyrick, which is an infinite Subject, and requireth the most curious Pen: I will only content my self to admire, with other men, that which I can∣not
comprehend, for fear to offend your Ho∣nour, by my weak expressions, which are far below my thoughts; and my thoughts far below your merits, which make all men to aspire, and I, more than all others, to take the liberty to write my self,
MY LORD,
