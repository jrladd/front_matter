MADAM,
I Humbly lay before your Highness Feet
an Unhappy Favourite, but 'tis in Your
Power to make him no longer so; Not his
Queens Repentance, nor her Tears cou'd
Rescue him from the Malice of his Enemies,
nor from the violence of a most unfortunate
Death; but your Highness with this unspeak∣able
Favour, and so Divine a Condescention in
Protecting this once pitty'd Hero, will make him
live Eternally; and those who cou'd scarce be∣hold
him on the Stage without weeping, when
they shall see him thus exalted, will all turn en∣vious

of his Fortune, which they can never think
deplorable while he is grac'd by your Highness.
For my own part, I tremble to express my
Thanks in so mean Language, but much more
when I wou'd pay my Tribute of just Praises to
your Highness; 'tis not to be attempted by any
Pen, Heaven has done it to a Miracle in Your
own Person, where are Written so many admi∣rable
Characters, such Illustrious Beauties on a
Body so Divinely fram'd, that there is none so
dull and ignorant, that cannot read 'em plainly;
And when You vouchsafe to cast your Eyes on
those beneath You, they speak their own Excel∣lencies
with greater Art and Eloquence, and
attract more Admiration than ever Virgil did in
his Divinest Flight of Fancy, then Ovid in speak∣ing
of his Princess, or Appelles in drawing of his
Venus; Nor are Your Virtues, or Your Royal
Blood less admirable, sprung from the Inestima∣ble
Fountain of so many Illustrious Plantagenets,
that I stand amaz'd at the Mightyness of the Sub∣ject
which I have chosen; besides the awful Ge∣nius
of your Highness bids me beware how I
come too near, lest I Prophane so many Incom∣parable
Perfections in so Sacred a Shrine as your
Highness Person, where You ought to be ador'd,

and not seen: For, like the Antient Jews in their
Religious Worship, 'tis a Favour for me to re∣main
on the outward steps, and not approach
nigh the Vail where the Crowd never come: This,
Most Illustrious Princess, ought to check my
Hand, least in attempting your Highness Cha∣racter,
my Apprehension of the Excellence of
the Subject, and the Danger of miscarrying, should
make my Fancy sink beneath so Glorious a Bur∣then;
Therefore I will forbear troubling your
Highness any further with the Rashness of my
Zeal; nor dare I be dictated any longer by it,
but will Conclude, in hopes that, when hereafter
I may chance to Record the Memory of a Prin∣cess,
whose Beauty, Fortune and Merits are grea∣ter
than Homer ever feign'd, or Tasso Copy'd, I
may have leave to draw her Pattern from your
Highness, and when that is done, the rest of my
Life shall be employ'd in Prayers for your Eter∣nal
Happiness, which be pleas'd to Interpret as
the Duty of,
MADAM,
