SIR,
WHen I had long seen, and sighed for that bitter and vio∣lent spirit which hath acted the body of our Nation, and the several Members thereof (according as their interest was ad∣vanced) it pleased God to direct mee to
 the sight of gracious Samuel, whose holy and sober spirit (acting upon the greatest disadvantages) did much affect mee; And I could not but expresse to my Congrega∣tion how much: And when I saw the whole Nation as much need healing, as my own poor flock, I did command my more timorous disposition, to adven∣ture my conceptions to the view of all that shall have leisure to peruse them; knowing that the healing of one Ulcer in the heart of any man, would abundantly recompence the wounds that I may pro∣bably have procured to my own Name: not caring my self to undergo any censure, if I might possibly cure the distemper of censoriousnesse in any. Standing upon this bold resolution, to offer this unwor∣thy mite to the world, your undeserved love to, and care of mee; your known worth shining out to all, in the rayes of piety, prudence, and learning; and a∣bove all, that singular sobriety, mode∣ration, and good composednesse of soul, which I have alwaies admired in you, chal∣lenged the Patronage of it. I professe
 without the least mixture of flattery or falshood, that I know not any man, whose name might more justly bee pre∣fixed to a Sermon of this nature. And, as I pray you to accept of this poor obla∣tion, so I heartily pray God to give us more such spirits as yours, who may bee able, not to comprize men and manners, persons and opinions, in one and the same detestation. Sir, I humbly beg your par∣don, not daring further, save to professe my self

Jan. 9. 1659.
