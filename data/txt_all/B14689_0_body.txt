SIr, I know not how you will take this presumptiō of mine, in venturing so farre vppon your manifold fauours, as to defende my poore paynes by your names prerogatiue: If
 well accepted, I haue all I de∣sire, if otherwise, good will was the offender, and your self being a Iudge, censure him with what penaltie it shall please you to appoint him.
Concerning this present worke, let it eyther condemne or commend it selfe: for great words cannot better it, or dis∣abling speeches impayre te worth of it: Gold is tryed by the touch, good bookes by their worth, and the wise are not so skilfull in the one, but iudge∣ment makes them as capable of the other.
But these harsh times are become the greatest enemies to Schollers, for eyther enui∣ous detraction intrudes him∣selfe
 to disgrace them, or grip∣ple niggardlnesse beares the purse to regarde them: So that the giuing of bookes, is now tearmed but beggerie, & the requiting of serious stu∣dies feeles no taste of liberali∣tie.
Thus falles it out with a num∣ber of good wittes, who find∣ing their great paynes to bee slenderly regarded, and their long lingred hopes in the end quite frustrated: are compel∣led to harder extremities then fitteth their deserts, or stands with the credit of such thank∣lesse men to suffer them en∣dure.
Therefore most fortunate may I tearme my selfe, that
 neuer yet happened to meete with such an iron nature: but fearing least I should, I am the bolder to shelter my selfe still vnder your worshipful fauour, a most liberall father and friende to the learned, and one that suffers not the poor∣est mans paines to passe vnre∣quited.
To you I giue this little labour of a farre greater loue, and to her (whome God hath blest you with all) some porti∣on: As God hath lincked yee together not to bee deuided, so ioyntly take betweene yee this true testimony of my af∣fection, and God make it as pleasing to you both in the rea∣ding, as (though it cost me som
 paine) it was a solace to my soule in the wri∣ting.
