OF all created things (Right Honorable) which doe in their kinde set forth the Creators greatnesse, Coeli enarrant, &c: And in the firmament the Heauens glory; the Sunne, In Sole posuit tabernaculum suum: And in the Sunne these three, The glorious light, piercing beames, and refreshing
 heat thereof draw with them most admi∣ration.
Man an earthly Sunne, amazeth man to consider what is in man: But when these three, Learning, Vertue, and Honour, meet in one man, as in one Center, who can but ad∣mire, who can but to such a man owe, and tender all obseruancie?
From hence is that Scitum of a knowing man; Honorem esse escam, Doctrinam hamum, Virtutem rete amorís.
But quorsum ista? Say that all these (as all must say who will speake the truth) not onely are, but doe after a goodly propor∣tion shine in your Lordship; shall it not be said presumption in me (who am as yet but a twig of the Leviticall Tree,) to offer my fruits (which may seem perhaps but leaues,) and that first of all to your Selfe, who are so firme, so fruitfull, and so profitable a root, both in our Church, & Common-wealth?
Yet because both Church, and Common-wealth doe truly say that of You, which St. Bernard hoped he might say of his Eu∣genius,
 In te facta est mutatio, non de te; nec priori statui tuo successit promotio, sed accessit: I repaire to your Lordship, though I bring no more to you then Noahs Doue did to him; A little branch in my mouth; being very sensible, that seeing it sprang from a tree in Gods garden, that the onely putting forth of your hand may not onely take me that bring it into the Arke; but giue to it growth with a plenteous blessing; which being all my suit to your Lordship;
I humbly beseech the God of heauen, to assist you with his grace, foeliciter currere, ac foeliciùs in Christi pietate consummare, to the great good of Church, and Common-wealth here, and to the vnspeakable good of your owne soule, and body hereafter.
