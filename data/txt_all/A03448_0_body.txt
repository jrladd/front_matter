COnsidering with my selfe, right Honorable and my sin∣gular good Lorde, how ready (no doubt) many wil be to ac∣cuse me of vayne presumptiō, for enterprising to deale in this so weighty a worke, and so farre aboue my reache to ac∣complish: I haue thought good to aduertise your Honour, by what occasion I was first induced to vndertake the same, al∣though the cause that moued mee thereto, hath (in parte) ere this, bene signified vnto your good Lordshippe.
Where as therfore, that worthie Citizen Reginald VVolfe late Printer to the Queenes Maiestie, a man well knowen and beholden to your Honour, meant in his life time to publish an v∣niuersall Cosmographie of the whole worlde, and therewith also certaine perticular Histories of euery knowen nation, amongst other whome he purposed to vse for performance of his entent in that behalfe, he procured me to take in hande the collection of those Histories, and hauing proceeded so far in the same, as lit∣tle wanted to the accomplishment of that long promised worke, it pleased God to call him to his mercie, after .xxv. yeares trauell spent therein, so that by his vntimely deceasse, no hope remayned to see that performed, whiche we had so long trauayled aboute: those yet whome be left in trust to dispose his things after his

departure hence, wishing to the benefite of others, that some fruite might follow of that whereabout he had imployed so long time, willed me to continue mine endeuour for their furtherance in the same, whiche although I was ready to do, so farre as mine abilitie would reach, and the rather to answere that trust which the deceassed reposed in me, to see it brought to some perfection: yet when the volume grewe so great, as they that were to defray the charges for the Impression, were not willing to go through with the whole, they resolued first to publishe the Histories of Englande, Scotlande, and Irelande, with their descriptions, whiche descriptions, bycause they were not in such readinesse, as those of forreyn countreys,William Ha∣rison, and Ri∣chard Stay∣burst. they were enforced to vse the helpe of other better able to do it than I.
Moreouer, the Chartes wherein Maister VVolfe spent a greate parte of his time, were not founde so complete as wee wished: and againe, vnderstanding of the great charges and notable enterprice of that worthie Gentleman maister Tho∣mas Sackeforde in procuring the Chartes of the seuerall pro∣uinces of this Realme to be sette forth, wee are in hope that in tyme he will deliniate this whole lande so perfectly, as shal be comparable or beyonde any deliniation heretofore made of any other region, and therefore leaue that to his well deserued prayse. If any well willer will imitate him in so prayse wor∣thie a worke for the two other regions, we will be gladde to fur∣ther his endeuour with all the helpes we may.
The Histories I haue gathered according to my skill, and conferred the greatest parte with Maister VVolfe in his life time, to his liking, who procured me so many helpes to the fur∣therance thereof, that I was lothe to omit any thing that might encreace the Readers knowledge, whiche causeth the booke to grow so great. But receyuing them by partes, and at seuerall times (as I might get them) it may be, that hauing had more regard to the mater than to the apt penning, J haue not so or∣derly disposed them, as otherwise I ought, choosing rather to

want order, than to defraude the Reader of that whiche for his further vnderstanding might seeme to satisfie his expe∣ctation. I therefore moste humbly beseeche your Honour to ac∣cept these Chronicles of Englande vnder your protection, and according to your wisedome and accustomed benignitie to beare with my faultes, the rather bicause you were euer so especiall good Lord to Maister VVolfe, to whome I was singularly be∣holden, and in whose name I humbly presente this rude worke vnto you, beseeching God, that as he hath made you an instru∣ment to aduaunce his truth, so it may please him to increace his good giftes in you to his glorie, the furtheraunce of the Queenes Maiesties seruice, and comforte of all hir faithfull and louing subiectes.
