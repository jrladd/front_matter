I Knew not how most gratious Queene, to make my most boun∣den & dutifull seruice known vnto your Ma∣iestie; But as Dauids ser∣uaunts ventured theyr liues through the mid∣dest of their enemies to fetch water from the well of Bethelem, to please their Lord and Maister; So my selfe thought it my dutie to trauell into some farre countries in no daunger, but of your Maiesties displeasure, by presenting some straunge Iewels among so many, as might dislike your Highnesse, which should scorch mee more then the Sunne did Ionas when his gourd was off; and terrifie me more, then the countenance of Moses terrifi∣ed

the Iewes without his vaile on. But your Maiestie, which forget nothing but iniuries, will the sooner forgiue mee my ouermuch boldnesse, the rather for that I present your highnesse, but with Iewels, & such as far excell the Iewels on Aarons garment, the onely pearles which ought to be bought with al the wealth we haue, the Iewels which we ought to seeke with all the studie and trauell wee can; the onely Vrim and Thummim, which should shine bright on a Princes breast, which the aun∣cient Kings of Israel ware as tablets about their necks, as frontlets on their foreheads, and gardes on their garments, which Iewels many other kings sought and mist. Licurgus sought these Iewels for the Lacedemonians at Delphos, Mena sought them of Mercurius for Egipt, Numa of the Nymph Egeria for the Romanes, & Za∣leucus of Minerua for the Locreās. Of these Iew∣els also I brought the best Pearles I could finde among them vnto your Maiestie, in hope of your wonted gracious fauour to accept these Iewels for their owne sake, as Artaxerxes accep∣ted water of the riuer Cyrus, for Cyrus sake.
