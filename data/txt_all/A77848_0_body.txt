Worthy Patriots,
THe Church of God under her troubles is nei∣ther to become (with the Poets Niobe) a senseless stone, despising the affliction of God; nor yet with (their Hecuba) a mad dog, ra∣ging through impatiencie at Gods Providence towards her; For whether God exerciseth her with outward per∣secutions, it is (as Austin said) to try her patience; or with heresies and errours, it is to prove her sapience and wisdome. And this may satisfie us, that Gods love and care for his Church, and truth, is greater then ours can be; and the losse of his glory is dearer to him, then the losse of our temporall comforts can be to us. It is true, as God to demonstrate the divine authority of the Scriptures, useth not such arguments, that agree with a proud and carnall wit, but such as are agreeable to the holinesse and majesty
 of the things contained therein; so also God in his Provi∣dence towards his Church goeth not in such a way which our hearts would expect, but in that which is most besee∣ming his love, wisdom, & power; & this hath made those, who have much appeared for God, to say (as Tully, when Pompey had the worse by Caesar, whose cause he judged the better) In divinis magna est caligo, Gods Presence is sometimes in a great cloud. Be not therefore dismayed (honourable Senators) notwithstanding the many opposi∣tions in the way of this your begun Reformation, and think not to be quiet, as long as the popish adversary can work; For as Austin observed of the Romans (while Pagans) among the many Temples they built to severall Goddesses, there was one also built to Quies, to whom notwithstan∣ding they never sacrificed, because of their delight in war. The same may be applyed to Rome, now Antichristian, who delights to make her selfe drunke in the bloud of the Saints. But God hath frustrated her many plots, and ex∣pectations, of which this Fifth day of November is a famous memoriall. The Lord so prosper you in your work, that neither fraud, or force may destroy it.
