AT your request this Sermon was Preached
and is now published. Such as it is, you ar
welcome to it, and much good may it do you 
the Lord grant all those may meet with 
blessing in it, who shall read it out of a real desire to ge
good for their souls; other Readers we care for none. 
take your invitation of me to this work, as an eviden
token of that love and esteem you have for me, howeve
unworthy: Therefore I did not draw back, but humbl
bless God for the assistance he hath afforded me in it 
all you find here according to his Will, came from hi
Spirit. I would be very, very low in mine own eyes
yet I do neither dread the censures of men, nor am I 
vain as to court their applause by making Apologies▪
What I have here presented you with, are the Truths o
God, which deserve your acceptance; I desire you to tr
them, and having seen their Fathers name in their fore
head, give them a ready admission, a most friendl
and honourable entertainment. I shall speak nothing 
you here by way of advice, having said so much in th
Sermon; but only signifie to you, that you are much upo

 heart, and in my prayers; I will not be unmindful
you at the Throne of Grace, but speak many a good
rd for you; the Lord comfort your hearts, and san∣ifie
to you his hand, that out of the eater may come
eat; out of this Providence which hath removed your
everend Pastor, special advantage may come to your
ls; the Lord send you another, undr whose shadow
 may sit with delight, finding his fruit sweet to your
ste; the Lord supply all your need according to his
ches in glory by Iesus Christ. My dear Friends, wisely
d graciously improve this dispensation, submit to the
od pleasure of a taking God; be much in the study of
ur hearts and ways; be you sincere and thriving Chri∣ians.
And the Father of mercies bind you up in the
ndle of life, and grant you a glorious Inheritance a∣ong
them that are sanctified by faith in Christ; so
ayes,

ctob. 29. 1678.
