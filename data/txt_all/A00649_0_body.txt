THis silly Infant, borne before the time,
Got life by reason, though begot in ryme
By hir true father; she is very yong,
And yet as females quickely finde a tongue,
So doth this changeling babble for a Patron,
Forsakes hir Father, and out-runnes hir Matron.
At length for hir protection she hath found,
Your honour with a wreath of vertues crown'd,
To whom hir selfe she humbly dedicates
That knew hir birth, and breeding, let the Fates
Proue happy to the end of your liues race,
To crowne your Greatnesse, with immortall grace.
