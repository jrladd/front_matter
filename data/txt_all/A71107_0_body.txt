GENTLEMEN,
THIS Sermon, which was first Preached, and is now published at your desires, I dedicate to your Names, to whose prudence and care the direction and management of this First general Meeting of our Coun∣try-men was committed: Heartily

wishing that it may be some way ser∣viceable to the healing of our unhappy Differences, and the restoring of U∣nity and Charity among Christians, especially those of the Protestant Re∣form'd Religion.
Gentlemen, I am Your affectionate Country-man and humble Servant,
