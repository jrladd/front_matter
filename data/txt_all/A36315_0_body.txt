 ear elod, and longed-for, my Joy and Crown;
THE serious consideration of the immorta∣lity of your Souls; the captivity of many amongst you to Satan and to sin; the eternity you are approaching to; the necessity of being made free from spiritual bondage; the shortness and uncertainty of your abode upon earth; your capacity of being set at liberty by Christ (whilst you are on this side the grave); th impossibili∣ty of redemption and deliverance  sinful and hellish raldom after death; moved me at first tah these Sermons on this Subject to your , and now to present them to your eyes; hoping that as the having of them in your hands to view what hath been said unto you, will be an help unto your memories, so also a means to continue, further, and increase that sense of the evil of Soul-captivity, that sorrow that you had been Capti o Satong▪ and those
 desires to change your Master, and have your fetters knocked off, and be brought into the liberty of the Sons of God, by Christ the Son of God; all which many of you (through the grace of God, for his work it was, and the glo∣ry thereof is due alone to him) did manifest and declare; ot only in your earnest desires for Gods sake, and for Christs sake, that the Congregation, if they had any le for, oi∣ty to miserable enthralled Souls, would son∣ly and fervently pray to God, that the chains of sin, wherewith you▪ had been held, might now be cut, and the bonds broke; but also in your private converse with me: Which is here related (the Lord knows) not that I may be accounted any thing (for I know that I am nothing), or that I do put any great esteem up∣on any thing that I can do; for I do judg my self, as to gifts or grace, or both, to be the meanest se employed in the work of the Lord, and vice of immortal Souls: But that if God be pleased to work by a weak and silly man, the Glory might be ascribed unto him .
Man at first was made the most noble and most excellent creature of all Gods visible works; en∣dued with such powers that he was capable of knowing, loving, and enjoying God his maker as his happiness, felicity, and end; created free from sin and corruption, and free from sorrow and affliction; tough not free from temptation, nor from a possibility of losing his freedom,
 yet he had a power and a liberty to have con∣tinued in that condition, without any necessity of coaction to depart from it.
But this free and noble creature assaulted and set upon by the crafty and malicious Serpent, and left to the freedom of his own will, was pre∣vailed with, and overcome by Satan, to trans∣gress the law of his maker, and violate his Cove∣nant, proved an Apostate, and turned rebel a∣gainst God that gave him his being, and that good condition in which he was created, who by the abusing of his liberty lost his freedom, and brought himself and all his posterity into an estate of slavery and bondage, out of which he was no way able to help himself.
Man lying in this pitiful plight, in this for∣lorn, miserable, and deplorable condition, the God of grace and mercy (of his meer grace and mercy) did commiserate, seek after him, find him out, and made known a way of Redempti∣on for him, even by the Incarnation, Passion, and Crucifixion of his own Son; which he did more and more clearly in several ages discover to the captivated children of enthralled Adam; whereas he provided no Redeemer for fallen An∣gels, but where they fell, there they lye, bound in chains of darkness, without hope of help, or possibility of recovery to all eternity. Behold, ye Captive Sons of men, a remedy for you, but not for Devils; for God sent not his Son to take upon him the nature of Angels, but the
 seed of Abraham; and that when the Aposta∣tizing Angels sinned, and were falling down to hell, Christ did not take hold on them; but on man (when by reason of sin he was tumbling and sinking into everlasting misery) he did take hold, and snatched him from the flames of eter∣nal burnings, from the curse of the Law, and from the intolerable wrath of an angry and pro∣voked God.
This God and Saviour that did foresee your thraldom and bondage, did from all eternity agree and covenant betwixt themselves in this way of Redemption to afford you succour and relief; that Christ should become your Surety, and be bound for you, that were bound, and died for you that should eternally have died, and set you at liberty by paying down a valu∣able ransom for you; of which you should be partakers, if you turn from sin to God, from Satan to his Son, heartily consenting to take him for your Lord-Redeemer, for your Prophet, Priest, and King, to rule, instruct, sanctifie and save you; resigning up your selves and all you have and are to him, preferring him before all, loving him above all, believing on him, and obeying of him sincerely, constantly, and uni∣versally, without partiality, and sinful, secret reservations; and if you like not him, and ac∣cept not of deliverance from your bonds and fetters upon these conditions, you must lye and perish in your chains of sin and guilt for ever.

This is that Redeemer that is preached, pub∣lished and tendered unto you: This is He, and He alone that can make you free, and if he do, you shall be free indeed; accept him as he is offered, and deliverance and salvation is come unto you; refuse him, slight him, or neglect him finally, and you are Captives with∣out ransom irrecoverably. All of you by na∣ture were in this state of spiritual Captivity, and all of you now are Bond or Free: For as there are but two places in the other world appointed by God to be receptacles of mens Souls, namely, Heaven and Hell; so in this world there are but two sorts of men (so distinguished by their spiritual state) Captives or Free; the one continuing so, so shall be plunged into hell; the other shall be possessed of heaven. Under which of these you are com∣prehended, you may be helped to discern, if you will read, consider, search, and pray: If you find your selves yet Captives, to know your misery, and the Chains wherewith you are bound, and how to get them off, read the former part of this little book: If Free, to in∣flame your hearts with love to your Redeemer and Surety, that paid the ransom for you; and learn how you are engaged to hearty and ever∣lasting thankfulness for his mercy towards you; and to express it by holy walking while you live, consult the latter part of this Treatise. In all which I have endeavoured to use plainness
 of speech, avoiding hard words and terms of art, as also controversies that might have been brought into this subject; concerning the Pow∣er and Will of man, concerning the Satisfacti∣on of Christ, and such like, contenting my self with what may suit the end I aimed at in preach∣ing of them, the awakening of the Conscience of Captive-sinners, that are fast asleep in their fetters and bonds of iniquity; and the bring∣ing of the more ignorant to sight and sense of their necessity of deliverance by Christ; (as for the more knowing, let them read the works of men of more knowledg); for if I may by any means help the weak and ignorant, that cannot understand the elaborate works of the more judicious, I shall account it a singu∣lar mercy: For if I could, I dare not usually, when I am to speak in the Name of God to immortal Souls, soar aloft above the capacity of the meanest; the strong might stoop to the plainness of wholesom words, when the weak and ignorant cannot come up to the understand∣ing of what is more sublime; though rude and undigested matter becometh not the place of any that stands to speak to people going to ano∣ther world, about things of everlasting concern∣ment; yet I judg, that he shall have but little comfort another day, that stands and speaks one word for Christ, and two or ten for him∣self; a little to set forth Christ, and much to set forth his own parts: If any look for such
 things here, that they may not lose their labour, let me desire them to lay it by, for you will not find it: But that this in its plain dress and stile, without all pomp of words, being read by you, or any others, might be to the profit of you or them, is the desire, and shall be the prayers of him that is
