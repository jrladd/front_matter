AFter I had sent vnto your Worships, the first Part of my tran∣slated Palmerine of England, and consi∣dered withall, that the same tooke his o∣riginal from the third Part of this present Historie of Primaleon, which I am now trans∣lating and purpose (by Gods leaue) shortly to publish: I thought it necessarie to make you both my Patrones of this likewise, and the third, when it shall bee finished, that yee maye see the whole Chronicle of these famous Princes in their full perfection. And albeit it was not my hap to
doo the first Part of Primaleon, (but onely the first foure sheetes thereof) by reason of my vr∣gent occasions at that time: so please yee to read it, it will giue ye the better entraunce into this hi∣storie, though I could haue wished there had been more paines taken in the Translation there∣of. Notwithstanding, this second Volume, the third, and all the rest in order, euen to the verie conclusion of Palmerin of Englands famous hi∣storie, wherof I haue two Parts yet to put forth: will I present to you, as my most affected Pa∣trones, and to whom I confes myselfe verie high∣ly beholding. I haue no other meanes, whereby to expresse my thankfulnes for so manie fauours: I beseech ye then make acceptance of this, & the rest in order, with whatsoeuer else remaines in me at all times heereafter. So being onely yours at commaund, I humbly take my leaue.
