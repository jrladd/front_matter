May it please Your Honors,
YOu are here most humbly implored for the Patronage of a Post-hu∣mous birth of my dear and honor∣ed Fathers Laborious mind, in the Cause of this Kingdoms profest and settled Religion. You may safely believe the Title-Page reports to You the true and genuine Author of the Book, but it's most humbly intreated that You would not: For if You rather please to read it, You will be assured of the Parent, by the Lineaments remarkable upon the Child; and therewith too receive, I hope, such satisfaction as may justly flow from the perusal of an History, which in some measure confirms the Excellency of those Laws You have devised, and Sacred Majestie confirm'd, for the Protection of that Religion and Government You profess and stand for. The Beauty, Iustice and Prudence of the Sanctions, will not a little appear in the ill visage of that Party, whose Rude humor and un∣governed Zeal is here represented. It would be an

immodest boldness in me to press Your belief with my Assertions of the happy performances herein. And they being for the most part but faithful Collections of matter of Fact, transacted by the Ancestors of a Sect, to this day more then enough warm in the Bowels of these Kingdoms, are to stand and fall in Your Grave and Iu∣dicious opinions, according to their correspondency with the Annals of Your own and other Countreys. If I had nothing to plead for the Publication of this History, but the zeal of a Son to preserve his Fathers Off-spring from treading too close after him to the Grave, I doubt not it would easily prevail with so much Nobleness as the High and Honorable Court of Parliament doth imply: But I am moreover apt to believe, that when Your Wisdoms please to consider, that the Party here∣by proved peccant, are still so far from Repentance, that they dare to boast their Innocency, and vie Loy∣alty and peaceable mindedness at the same rate (at least) they did before our late Troubles and present Distem∣pers made their Turbulencies and Seditions notori∣ous; I may then reasonably, I hope, beg Your favor∣able acceptance of this Dedication; or at least depend upon that pardon from you, which the offended Party will be unwilling to allow to him, who though unworthy so great an honor, craves leave to subscribe himself,
(Right Honorable Lords and Gentlemen)
