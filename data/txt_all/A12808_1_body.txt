Brethren,
THis Sermon, doth not indeauour to im∣pose on you Faith implicit; from the authoritie of a Mother, the Church; either of yours Romish, or of ours Re∣formed. But to propose to you, Truth explicit: from the veritie of a Father, euen of our owne God, in his owne Word. When I leaue it, doe you leaue me: though you be but Men, and I could be euen an Angell. While I follow it, you should follow Gal. 1. 8. me, though you could be euen Apostles, and I but a Matth. 23. 3. Man, yee a Pharisie. To the end, that this Truth may be thus embraced: I preach this to you, doe you pray for mee: and our common Christ blesse vs all.
