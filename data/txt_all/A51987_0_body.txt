TIs not to commend this Work, that this is writ∣ten, for that it will it selfe; nor is it to present unto the curious Readers view, no∣velties but ancient learning useful∣ly digested; the common Law of England that is defined to be Lex non Scripta, is best knowne by the multitudes of particular cases re∣ported and set downe in the seve∣rall yeare-bookes, and other re∣ports
of the Law, and in them the severall resolutions of different na∣tures being set downe as in time they hapned to be argued, with∣out having regard to report toge∣ther all such cases as concerned one kinde of learning, breeds such confusion, that the painefull stu∣dent must be very carefull under his severall titles in his common-place-bookes to take notes with reference to the bookes from whence he takes them proper to be applied to the title under which he writes it, and likewise careful∣ly to coate his bookes to each o∣ther, or otherwise upon sundry occasions hee may be driven to tumble up and downe the severall bookes to resolve himselfe, and misse too of such good resoluti∣ons as the bookes would afford him, if his memorie (which may easily faile) be not admirable;
This small Epitomie will-prevent that trouble, and helpe (more then any abridgment extant) the labo∣rious Student to know and find out the learning concerning wards, and Liveries, no small part of our Law, nor easiest learning; It was written by the right Hono∣rable and learned Sir James Ley, Earle of Marlebrough, Lord High Treasurer of England, when hee was Atturney of the Wards and Liveries, for his owne private use, but now presented to publike view for the common good of the Stu∣dents of the Law; The learning concerning Wards and Liveries was not practised in one peculiar Court, nor differences concerning Wards lands not confined to any particular Court, but left to be proceeded in all Courts proper for the nature of the causes, till of late yeares: but now by a Statute
made 32. H. 8. cap. 46. A peculiar Court knowne by the name of the Court of Wards is erected, where∣in all things that concerne the Kings Wards is heard and deter∣mined, so that now the Law as to Wards being to be onely practi∣sed there: This Treatise will be of good use to him that intends that practise, for in it will be found ve∣ry much of the learning concer∣ning Wards, for him that desires the knowledge of such learning: It was chiefely published, and to him is wisht encrease of Learning,
Farewell.
