Dear Sister,
ALL these things shall be dissolved, the very Heaven
and Earth, and so must our Relations, however delight∣ful,
for they are only for a time. Death with its
cold hand will easily loose the straitest Knot that coupled the
most suitable and affectionate Pair: You frequently have
heard and seen it, now you feel it. God hath been pleased to
make a breach upon you, Oh that he would fill it up by stand∣ing
himself in it: By the Father of Mercies, and God of
Bowels, great and precious Promises are made to the solitary,
Widow, which are Yea and Amen; sue them out by Prayer,
and live upon them by Faith. It is well with your Deceased
Husband, and whatever straits and Difficulties you may for
a time meet with, I hope it will be so with you. What I hear∣tily
pray for you, is, that you may have a full Enjoyment of
God in the end, and receive Supports from him by the way,
together with fresh and full supplies of Grace, Peace and Com∣fort.

You by and with your Son desir'd the printing of the fol∣lowing
Discourse, I could not deny you: Now it sees the light,
may it do good to you, and many more through the Blessing
of God accompanying it; which will be the Rejoycing
of

From my Study,
