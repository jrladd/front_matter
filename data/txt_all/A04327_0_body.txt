SIR, the nature, power∣fulnesse, and strange properties of the load∣stone are such, that the more they are known, the more they are iust∣ly admired in their most liuely expressing that infinite power, and goodnes of our God, who hath created so precious a Iewell for the profitable vse of man, and for the enlarging, and setting forth of his owne glory. Into the search of which admirable and secret vertues

my selfe by the space of these forty yeeres, haue somewhat entred (as my leasure and oc∣casions would serue, and at by times) partly by reading other mens writings, and partly by my owne industrie and practize: Whereby what I haue collected, and found, this little Treatise will shew. Which, whether it be any thing, or nothing, I do referre vnto the iudici∣ous Readers consideration, but in special to your fauorable construction, and good acceptance.
Many yeeres since diuers of my good friends, and among them some honourable persons, were very desirous that I should pub∣lish such obseruations as I had collected, both before, and also after the setting forth of D. Gilberts booke: And none more earnest here∣in then D. Gilbert himselfe, vnto whom I com∣municated what I had obserued of my selfe, and what I had built vpon his foundation of the Magnetisme of the earth. Both which hee liked well and wished me to publish them, as I remember at the time of our priuate confe∣rence, as may further appeare by letters that I receiued from him; which I haue to shew vn∣der his owne hand.
But aboue all others, the perswasions of that learned honourable Gentleman, Sir Thomas Challenor, late Chamberlaine vnto the Mirrour of honour Prince Henry preuailed most with me. Vnto whom I was all the time that I at∣tended that Prince his highnesse, for his loue and curtesie, much beholding. Whereupon about seauen yeeres since I deliuered vnto him this Treatise, finished almost as now it is, sa∣uing some few additions vpon necessary occa∣sions. But that Copie was either mislaied or embeseled, that he lost it; About three yeeres since he sent earnestly vnto mee for an other Copie: which also he receiued, promising me by his letters, that within three months hee would put that to the presse, and that it should be carefully and correctly performed: But what is become euen of that also I know not: Only this I am sure of that I haue met with many portraitures of my Magneticall imple∣ments, and diuers of my propositions set a∣broad in print in another mans name, and yet some of them not rightly vnderstood by the partie vsurping them.
Now that it hath pleased God to take

Sir Thomas Challenor and that vpon enquirie I can heare no tidings of those my lost labours, and knowing that diuers are very desirous to see them, I haue once againe reuiued my scat∣tered papers, collected them together, & made choice of your selfe to whom to entitle (accor∣ding vnto our vsuall curtesies) these magneticals; your worthy selfe I say in many respects: First, because your rare learning ioin'd with so great pietie, accompanied with so pleasing a carri∣age of your selfe towards euerie man is such, as causeth all good men which know you, to loue you, by force of a naturall sympathy not vnlike the appetite of concourse & coniuncti∣on whereby our very Magnets doe affect their proper obiects. And this was verie conspicu∣ous in our renowned iudicious Prince Henry, who loued you singularlie well for your ver∣tues, and delighted no lesse to conferre with you for your knowledge in matters appertai∣ning vnto Discoueries and Cosmographicall learnings, in the which his highnes was more then vulgarly skilfull.
Another is, the glorious fauour which I see reflected vpon you from that most reuerend

and singular ornament of our Church and State, reioycing in Gods blessing of his labors in your education: like as God hath hitherto blessed him in all things, and not onely my prayers and such as I am who are so much bounden vnto him, but the praiers of many thousands that neuer saw him, will not cease to beseech the Almightie long to preserue him. and alwaies to prosper him in his godly pro∣ceedings: Wherefore this extraordinary re∣spect which he hath vnto you, both is and must be a commanding motiue vnto mee to shew my good will by the best poore meanes that I can toward you.
Yet one more I haue, which is this: That whereas a worthy societie of Gentlemen and Marchants is very highly and iustly commen∣ded and honoured of all men, for their great charges in their constant and indefatigable proceedings, for discoueries of vnknown pas∣sages to new Countries and Nations, for the further aduancement of Gods glorie, the ho∣nour of our King, and principall benefit of the whole Kingdome; In remembring of those honourable attempts, you must in no wise be

forgotten, and especially in a Treatise menti∣oning the vertues, and properties of the Load∣stone, being the leader and guide to these ad∣mirable exploits, who besides your souud knowledge herein, doe with great constancie ioine both your purse and counsaile for the atcheiuing of them, yea and that without ex∣pectation, or hope of priuate gaine, but onely of your noble genorositie, knowing full well, that the aduancement of Gods glorie is abso∣lutely of it selfe the greatest gaine with a con∣tented minde; Wherewith, he that onely is all-and selfe-sufficient, enrich you more and more in this world, and to your eternall hap∣pinesse, most abundantly and perfectly satisfie you, by making you drinke of the riuer of his pleasures in the world to come; Amen.
Yours with all hearty affection
WILLIAM BARLOWE.
