Honoured Sirs,
IN answer to Desires, I have printed this Sermon, and bequeathed it to you also; who (that I might acknowledge your great re∣spect to me, and your favour to the present Government therein) were the Primum mobile, the First movers of printing my former Sermon, (to you also bequeathed)
which so far taking your spirits (as you then much expressed) I thought it necessary to catch hold of this happie opportunity, to explain That by This, in shewing you as well the black side, as the bright side of the cloud of future times; and so your judge∣ments might be set upright in the appre∣hension and expectation of those things; to rejoyce in Christ, but with a holy filial trembling: Do as Chrysostom sent word to the threatning Empress; Ego nil nisi pec∣catum timeo: Fear sin, and then fear no∣thing. Your reverence of Christ shall be then filled with rejoycing that his day is coming, to beat down all his enemies, and advance his Saints upon earth afore the ultimate glorifying of you, and him, who subscribes himself

From my Studie at Mary Staynings, London. Feb. 12. 1650.
