My Lord,
I Am not ashamed to professe that I pay this part of ser∣vice
to your Lordship most unwillingly: for it is a
sad office to be the chief Minister in the house of mour∣ning,
and to present an interested person with a
branch of Cypresse and a bottle of tears. And in∣deed,
my Lord, it were more proportionable to your
 needs to bring something that might alleviate your sorrow, th to dresse
the hearse of your Dear Lady, and to furnish it with such circumstances,
that it may dwell with you, and lie in your closet, and make your pray∣ers
and your retirements more sad and full of weepings. But because
the Divine providence hath taken from you a person so excellent, a
woman fit to converse with Angels, and Apostles, with Saints and Mar∣tyrs,

give me leave to present you with her picture; drawn in little and in 
water-colours, sullied indeed with tears and the abrupt accents of a re∣al
and consonant sorrow; but drawn with a faithful hand, and taken
from the life: and indeed it were too great a losse, to be deprived
of her example and of her rule, of the original and the copy too. The
age is very evil and deserved her not; but because it is so evil, it hath
the more need to have such lives preserved in memory to instruct our
piety, or upbraid our wickednesse. For now that God hath cut this tree
of Paradise down from its seat of earth, yet so the dead trunk may sup∣port 
a part of the declining Temple, or at least serve to kindle the fire
on the altar. My Lord, I pray God this heap of sorrow may swell
your piety till it breaks into the greatest joyes of God and of religion:
and remember, when you pay a tear upon the grave, or to the memo∣ry
of your Lady (that dear and most excellent soul) that you pay two
more: one of repentance for those things that may have caused this
breach; and another of joy for the mercies of God to your Dear de∣parted
Saint, that he hath taken her into a place where she can weep
no more. My Lord, I think I shall, so long as I live, that is so long as
I am
