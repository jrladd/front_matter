COnsidering with my selfe (worshipfull Mistresse) the due desert proceeding to your person, the perfect proofe of pure pretence, in supporting and holding vp of vertu∣ouse exercises: was and is the occasion to incourag me of presenting this vnto your view. I am though vnskilfull yet not vnmindful of your deserts, which if I should take in hand to penne, I were like him which boldly and prtly aduentured to treade the Maze, And being in, could not finde the way out a∣gaine, but by long time and instruction. So if I should beginne to write, I must haue both long time, and also instruction in learned lore. This my present vnto you (being simply penned Intituled The Chariot of Chastitie) hath beene by forgetfulnesse kepte from my sight, and long hath lingered in the lodge of Lasinesse. But when requisite remembraunce had deemed of Delay: Then presently prswation induced me to publish the same. But I stood in doubt whether I might present it vnto you: waying the insuf∣ficiencie of the deuice, but being imbouldened by tue meaning, I was incouraged, and as I haue presented vnto your worships hus∣band, my simple Castell, making him patron of the same: So I thoght it good to vnite you together. Selecting you for Patronesse of this my present, wishing vnto your Mistrishippe as dutie bindes me, lorishing fecitie in this life, and in the world to come Heauenly hap∣pinesse.
