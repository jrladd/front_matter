My very Dear, and much Esteemed Brother,
WHEN I Reflect on the blessed Providence that opened so wide a Door, for the Occupa∣tion of your Talent the last Winter, at Chichester, and the strange, and amazing Success that attended your La∣bours there, I cannot but hope the Glori∣ous Day which Zion's Converts have so long Mourned, Prayed and Waited for, is nigh at Hand, even a plentiful Effusion of the Spirit, upon all the Followers of the Lamb; of which, more than a Taste was given in the mighty Portion that rested up∣on you, whilst you were delivering your Masters Errand in that Place. Your Face like Moses) did eminently Shine (during

your Commemoration on that Mount of Vision) to the Observation, and Admirati∣on of all the Beholders, none but your self was ignorant of it, so that the Multitude was ready to Hosanna you, (as they did your Master before you) and in the same Language too, — Never Man spake, like this Man: And so strange a Consternation was there in the Minds of all, and so won∣derful a Conviction in the Hearts of many, as quite confounded the Opposers of Gos∣pel Light, and Truth, and made them even gnash their Teeth for Madness; Oh! how did the Dukes of Palestina tremble, and the Inhabitants of Canaan melt away: How did the Formal and Legal Rabbies Vex and Fume, that a Nehemiah so suddenly, so unexpectedly, stood on the Wall with un∣daunted Courage, and they could not pluck him down; That there appear'd a Man, whom, with all their Machinations, they could not hinder to seek in good Earnest, the Welfare of Immortal Souls, by Preach∣ing the Truth fully and clearly, as it is in Jesus; so that the People which before sat in Darkness, saw great Light; and to those who were, and a long time had been in the Regions of the Shadow of Death, Light sprung up: But though the Enemies of Free-Grace were grieved exceedingly, by

your so powerful, and spiritual Preaching, the Children of the Bride-Chamber were as much Comforted, Enlivened, Refreshed, and many poor Dead Sinners Awakened, Convinced, and Perswaded to Embrace the Everlasting Gospel, which was Sound∣ed in their Ears in such a Strain, that many (though Old Hearers) to my Knowledge, did Profess, they never heard the Gospel before: And, Oh! What an Astonishing Change was visibly Observ'd in the Faces of the Inhabitants of Chichester: Such Crowding and Thronging, to hear the Word dropping, as sweet smelling Myrrh, from your Lips, the Oldest Man Alive ne∣ver saw the like: The Walls of the Meet∣ing-house (though in the coldest Season of the Winter) Sweated with Heat, (a true Emblem of the Warmth, many Frozen Hearth felt, by the reflective Rays of Zi∣on's Glory) and the Spirits of the most Ig∣norant were strangely Reviv'd, with the fragrant odoriferous Savor of Aaron's sweet Perfume, so Plentifully, and in a Theop-must Manner, disfus'd amongst them: Con∣cerning this Perfume (which I take to be an eminent Type of the Riches of Free-Grace) there was a Law Enacted in the Court of Heaven, Whoever made any Thing like it, should be put to Death: If that Statute

was still in Force, few Preachers in our Day, would be in danger of its Penalty, — Alas! they don't come near it, their Preach∣ing is far enough wide from it: They are either bellowing Bulls of Sinai, thundering out the Terrors of the Law, and belching forth the Flames of Hell, to affrighten and distract poor Creatures, and make them run Mad; or else they are for putting them to Earn their expected Happiness (as Adam was doom'd to Eat his Bread) with the Sweat of their Brow: This they must do, and that they must do, to get an Interest in Christ: And then we have a Learned Receipt, so many Pints of Repentance that must be extracted from the Limbeck of their moist Brains, so many Pounds of Du∣ties, that must be weighed at the Beam of their own Intellects, to make them capable of God's Acceptance; and they must be sure to come full Loaded with a Bundle of Qualifications, at their Backs, if they would have Christ to be their Saviour. Oh! What pitiful Trash is this; how far from that Gospel which the Lord Jesus sends his Ambassadors (whom he anoints with the Unction of the Holy One) to Preach, and Hold forth to poor Sinners: That sounds forth a free Offer, and Tender of Mercy, to all that Look to, and Believe in a Cruci∣fy'd

Jesus; of which Ambassadors, Sir, you apparently, and beyond Contradiction, manifested your self to be One, (and a chief One too) when you first lifted up your Voice, as a Trumpet, in the Audience of the Inhabitants of Chichester: Oh! how Beautiful were your Feet shod with the Preparation of the Glorious Gospel, for that you brought good Tidings to them that were ready to Perish; you Published Peace, (even that Peace which the World cannot give, and which the Devil cannot take away) you brought good Tidings of Good, the Goodness of Free-Grace, the Immense Ocean of Divine Love; You Published Salvation, and that with a Gos∣pel Spirit, and in a Gospel Dialect, as it was Published by the Lord Jesus himself, and all his Apostles: You said unto Zion, thy God Reigneth on the Throne of Mer∣cy, dispencing Grace and Favour to the worst of Sinners: For this were your La∣bours Accepted, for this was your Person Honoured, for this was your Ministry in very high Esteem, among all sorts of Per∣sons. How many will have cause to Bless God to all Eternity, they ever saw your Face! Oh! How many visible Seals of your Apostleship did you leave behind you, when you left the Place. You never Preach∣ed

a Sermon there in Vain; but many Eyes were Opened, many Hearts Affected, and deeply Touched; many Consciences Awa∣kened, whenever you opened your Mouth; which made a worthy Person, well Vers'd in Gospel Affairs, Write me Word, (then at London) he verily Believ'd, you did more Good Two or Three Sabbath-days in Chi∣chester, than any Minister, yea, than all the Ministers in Sussex had done Seven Years before: This was very refreshing News to my Soul; it made my Heart, (which as yet is none of the softest) like the Babe in Eli∣sabeth's Womb, leap within me for Joy: This, indeed, indeared you very much to me, and set me a Longing to be partaker of your Heavenly Gift; and though I had several Letters from several Persons that spake very largely of you, and the wonder∣ful Things God did by you, and that at such a Rate, if I had not known them to be Men of Sobriety, Faithfulness, and emi∣nent Piety, I should certainly have Judg'd, they had flown in their Language, above the Capacity of an Hyperbole, to bring 'em safely off; yet, early at my Return, when I went my self to Chichester, and saw the un∣usual Seriousness of the vast Auditory, and the extraordinary Going forth of your Spi∣rit, both in Prayer and Preaching, I was

strangely amazed, and forc'd to say, with the Queen of Sheba, The half of your de∣served Fame was not told me; and made this Remark in my own Breast, There was no such Sight to be seen any where in our Israel, and therefore left others to consider of it, and speak their Minds. And if the Lord goes on, as he has graciously and wonderfully begun, Chichester will be the Place of Religion in the South of En∣gland, and we may take in the rest of the Points of the Compass. Verily you have (or rather the Great Jehovah by you) lighted such a Candle there, that the Enemies of Free-Grace, with all their Tricks and Artifices, with all their Growl∣ing and Grumbling, with all their Lying and Slandering, with all their Noise and Clamour, yea, with all their Cunning and Priest-craft, will never be able to put out; for, Magna est veritas, & prevalebit, Dagon must and shall fall before the Ark of the Living God.
Dear Brother, I am in a large Field, whilst I have your noble Chichesterian Acts under review (which will be for ever your Praise in the Gates of the Daughter of Zion, and your Eternal Rejoycing in the day of the Lord Jesus) and so very large

is this Field, that I despair of finding the way out, and therefore must be forc'd to stand still, breaking forth in the Apostle's Admiration, O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his Judgments, and how are his Ways past finding out. Or taking up the Dictates of the Holy Spirit in the Mouth of Balaam, According to this time it shall be said of Jacob, and of Israel, (Ay, and now of Chichester too) what has God wrought.
And, though you did good even beyond Conception, very much good, even beyond Parallel, whilst these Parts were Blessed with your Presence, yet really, the Good, by way of Emphasis, (and which will be the most Sparkling Jewel in the Crown, wherewith your Master will crown you in the Day of his Appearing) was your speak∣ing Peace to this Blessed Saint; whose Sad Life is the Subject of the following Tract. You were chosen out by the Lord of the Harvest, and preferr'd before any of his Labourers, to bring a Message of Peace and Comfort to her drooping Soul; great Pains were used, and many Essays made, to effect a Cure upon her, but alas! all in vain; No Words were wanting, no La∣bour was spared, no Gospel ways untryed, for the easing her distressed Mind, but all

to no purpose: If Prayers and Tears, if publick and private Wrestlings with God, if setting a-part Solemn Days, if the spending part of many Nights, if commu∣nicating of Experiences, if opening and inculcating of the Promises, if frequent Visits, and labouring all manner of ways with her: What shall I say? If imparting the very Secrets of my Soul, and all the Mysteries and Wonders of Grace, my Gracious God ever made known to me in his Christ, had any thing availed, she had not been in those Shades of Horrid Darkness you found her: For I can say in all Sincerity, as Paul to the Corinthians, My Mouth was opened, my Heart was en∣larged towards her. Oh! how often did my Soul Mourn in Secret, because I could not help her: How many Tears did I shed in private, because no words I spoke could take hold on her: I was too un∣worthy of such an Honour: My Poor La∣bours (through the Influence of a Divine Blessing) awakened her out of a Natural State, but Success was denied to my En∣deavours, how great soever, to Admini∣ster any Ease or Comfort: That was your alotted Task, by him with whom is the Residue of the Spirit: Oh! to this end were you Born, and for this cause came

you unto Chichester, to bear Witness unto the Truth, to Gospel-truth, Light, and special Grace, for the lifting up this Dear Languishing Soul, who would not see, who could not believe, there was any Love, or Redeeming Mercy for her, till it was confirmed to her from your Lips, then she saw the Beauty of the Lord, as the Morning, and the Glory of Jehovah, her Righteousness, as the Noon-day: There was indeed before a Wind, a Gale of Gospel-Truths, that continually blew upon her, but the Lord was not in the Wind: There was a Fire of Zeal kindled in the Breasts of Ministers, and many others, always flaming in her Bosom, but the Lord was not in the Fire; and there∣fore, though there was Balm enough fetch'd from Gilead, and applied to her Wounds, yet this Sorrowful Daughter of Jerusalem was not Healed, till you came (and God came with you) as a Welcome Messenger of Salvation: Then, Oh! then the Son of Righteousness arose with Heal∣ing in his Wings, in the Horizon of her Soul. Then did the day break, and the Shadows began to fly away; and then did her Beloved come leaping over the Moun∣tains, and skipping over the Hills unto her. Oh! Happy was the time wherein

you first saw her, and Blessed was the day in which it was told her, Behold, there is a Watch-man of the Lord's sending, a Work-man of the Lord's preparing, go and hear what he has to say to you. As the Lord's way of Judgment, so his ways of Mercy are in the Deep, and his Foot∣steps coming towards a Poor Creature, for Good and Comfort, are not known. So far am I from the Mode of this Genera∣tion, to envy you, or repine that you should do that in a few days, which I could not do in many Months, that the Lord knows, I Love, Honour, Prize, and Value you the more for it, and you are much dearer to me since, than ever you were before. To you therefore I dedicate this short History of her Life and Death, as that which of right belongs to you: You knew her, and was well known to her: You pittied her in her doleful Ago∣nies, and took a great deal of Pains with her, to help her out of the Deep Pit, into which she was so horribly sunk. The Lord reward you (yea, he will abundantly re∣ward you) for all your great Labour of Love to her precious Soul: You were very high in her Esteem, and exceeding Dear, she never spoke of you but with wonderful Respect, heartily blessing God

for you: You had the Satisfaction to see her in her latest Hours, the very night she died, which was a great Comfort to her Friends; and though she was under a Cloud at that Moment, yet a little after you left her, the Cloud was dispell'd, and she was in a Transport of Glory, and went to Heaven in a Chariot of Triumph. She had Beauty for Ashes, the Oil of Joy for Mourning, the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of Heaviness, and she is now a Tree of Righteousness, the Planting of the Lord, that he may be for ever Glorified in the aboundant Riches of his Grace and Mercy towards her, and with whom she is, and ever will be, glorified to all Eternity.
And now my Dear, my very Dear Bro∣ther, I hope your Candid Eye will over∣look the many Imperfections of these Scribbling Lines, and cover with the Man∣tle of Charity what you see amiss in the subsequent Tract: And I hope also, none will be so unjust, to entitle you to the Weaknesses and Impertinencies appearing therein, because your Name is inscribed to it. The good Lord increase your eminent Gifts, add to your Matchless Zeal, inflame your ardent Love, that you may Shine more and more in Doctrine

and Conversation, till you are call'd to Shine in the Celestial Constellation above, and till after all your Pious Endeavours, and Faithful Labours in your Lord's Vine∣yard, you hear that Blessed Sound from your Lord's Lips, (whose Mouth is most comfortably Sweet in the day of Grace, and will be ravishingly so in the day of Glory,) Well done Good and Faithful Ser∣vant, thou hast been Faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things, enter thou into thy Master's Joy. Go on as you have begun (through the good Hand of your God upon you) in the Power and Spirit of Elias, to turn the Hearts of the Fathers to the Children; that is, to in∣flame the Hearts of Parents, with a Desire and Longing after the Salvation of their Children: And the Disobedient to the Wisdom of the Just; that is, Those who have stood out against Gospel-Light and Truth. Now to see, that closing with Christ in a Gospel-way, and to seek to be made Righteous by an imputed Righte∣ousness, is the only Spiritual Wisdom: And to make ready a People prepared for the Lord; that is, To Convince People, that they are Lost and Undone in them∣selves; and to perswade them, without looking for any previous Qualifications, to

cast their naked Souls before the Lord Jesus, to be cloathed upon with his Righte∣ousness, which only must be their Happi∣ness, if ever they are made Happy. So committing you to the Protection of our Dear Redeemer, in whom I desire to be esteemed, as unfeignedly I am,
