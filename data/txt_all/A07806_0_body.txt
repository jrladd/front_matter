MArueile not (beloued bre∣thren)
that I salute you in
the name of brotherhood,
whom I acknowledge se∣duced:
It pleased our Sa∣uiour
to call some Luk. 15.Sheepe,
whē as yet they were wan∣dring:
and his Apostle na∣meth
them Gal. 3. 1.Brethren, whom hee esteemed be∣witched.
With whom giue me rather leaue to
marueile in your behalfe, Gal. 1. 6.Why are you so easily re∣moued
from the Gospell of Christ? and in the earnest
desire of your blessed conuersion, to expostulate
in the same tenour: Gal. 3. 1.Who hath bewitched you, that
you should not obey the truth, in whom Iesus Christ was
described (that is, liuely preached) among you? It
is not then any Who, who may either preiudice a
truth, or priuilege an error: because, if truth; then

Doe as they say, although  be a Pharisie:
If any other doctrine, not receiued from Christ, then
Gal. 1. 8.Hold him cursed, although the Minister be an
Gal. 1. 8.Angell. And seeing (brethren) it hath pleased
almightie God (who bringeth light out of darknes,
and life out of death) from this late sinfull attempt,
as namelesse for vglines, as matchlesse for ex∣ample,
to draw this inspiration of grace, that you,
through the detestation of their practises are now
brought to a suspition of their inchantments: I
thought it therefore my bounden dutie to dis∣couer
vnto you positions and practises of your
Priests, whereby, as with tongues and hands,
they conspire together in like mischiefe: nothing
doubting, but when you shall perceiue the dam∣nablenes
of their doctrine, you will Christianlie
auoide the danger of their charme. Now
then let vs (beloued) ioyntly examine
these spirits; and not, till in the
end of this tract, take our
mutuall farewell.
