MY LORD,
IN this Dedication to the Right Honou∣rable
Sr. John Houblon, One of the
Lords of the ADMIRALTY,
Governour of the Royal BANK of
England, and now the great Lieutenant Royal
of this Metropolitan City; methinks, I am en∣terd
into so spacious a Field, with such vari∣ous
attracting Prospects before me, as even di∣vide
my Veneration. The Homage is on all

Sides so equally Due, that I know not Where
to Kneel first. For Your Lordship by an
Accumulation of Glories, has, perhaps, so far
out-run the Common Race of Honour; that
in Your Accession to the CHAIR, as
considerable a Triumph as it gives you, in∣stead
of being Your Highest Ascendant of
Renown, is only an Addition to Your more
ample Pile of Trophies; whilst You have so
far out-stript the Candidates of Dignity before
You, that You bring the Right Honourable
to Your Praetorian Seate, not come to find it
there.
Not that this publick Address, I now make
Your Lordship, is intended for any Piece, ei∣ther
of Panegyrick, or Herauldry, to Illustrate
or Blazon the High Promotions to which
Your Lordship has so eminently Arrived: No,
my Lord, I have a fairer Theme, a Specula∣tion
above them. For 'tis not Preferment,
Titles, or State: 'Tis the Virtue, the Merit,
Principle and Integrity, that both mount and

fill the Seats of Power and Trust, are the embo∣dyed
Mass; when the others are but the meer
Drapery of HONOUR.
'Tis in this last Capacity, (not the Pomp and
Splendour of Advancement,) but Your Lord∣ships
Double Qualifications of Fidelity and
Ability to Execute in those Exalted Posts, that
render You the Subject of an Universal Ap∣plause.
And though my present Address is
chiefly to Congratulate Your Lordship's In∣auguration
into this August Magistracy, in which
both the Pride and Gratitude of the Honoura∣ble
Company of GROCERS make their
profoundest Tenders of Respect to so Con∣spicuous
a Member and Ornament to their
Society: Yet all this is but an inconsiderable
Tribute, compared to what the World has
yet to Pay You; For, Your Lordship has
taken Care for a more lasting Triumph; so
vast is the Difference betwixt Glittering for a
Day, and Shining for a Life.

I should dwell longer upon this inviting
Theme, were I not not sensible that, to all
Your other Accomplishments, Your Lordship
has that innate Modesty, that You rather stu∣dy
to deserve Encomiums than to hear them;
which only Consideration shall check my Pen,
and make me the sooner hasten to Subscribe
my self,
MY LORD,
