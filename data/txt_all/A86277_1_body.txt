Serene, &c.
COncerning the Choyce of the Subject matter of my present Pains, It is the first of this race that ever was dedicated to any person, and had I not thought it the best, It should have been taught a less ambition, then to chuse such a Princely Patron: I shall say no more, then that the sole inducement thereto, was his singular learning in the Law and Gospel; the former of which is so conspicuous to the world, that it is universally acknowledged of all; and for the latter, there is none that can be ignorant thereof, who hath ever had the happiness, though but in a small measure of his own free and in∣timate Converse. As for my own part, I cannot but publickly profess, I never read of any more wise and vertuous, and so truly and becomingly Religious, and where the right Knowledg of the Laws of God given to man, bears the enlightned mind so even, that it is as far from doing any wrong, as Ju∣stice it self: And my present labours can∣not find better welcome, or more judicious

acceptance with any, then with such as these; for such free and unprejudiced spirits, will neither antiquate Truth for the oldness of the Notion, nor slight her for looking so young, or bearing the face of Novelty: He alone, above other men of honour, hath made goodness his Friend, as well as greatness his Companion; Besides there are none that can be better assured of the sincerity and efficacy of my present design, which is appointed to run through the midst of the Laws of God and men; for as many as are not meer sons of the Letter, know very well, how much the more inward and mysterious meaning of the Idea of the Law makes for the reverence of the holy Scripture.
Wherefore my design being so pious as it proves, I could do nothing more fit then to make choyce of so true a lover of the piety of the Law, as your self, for a Patron of my present labours; especially, you being so well able to do the most proper office of a Patron; to defend the Idea of the Laws and Statutes of England, that is here presented to you, and to make up out of your rich treasury of Learning, what my penury could not reach to, or inadvertency may have omitted: And truly if I may not hope this from you, I know not whence to

expect it: for I do not know where to meet with any so universally and fully accompli∣shed in the Law and Gospel, and indeed in all parts of the choycest kind of Lear∣ning; any one of which acquisitions is enough to fill, if not swell, an ordinary man with great conceit and pride, when as it is your sole priviledg to have them all, and yet not to take upon you, nor to be any thing more Im∣perious or Censorious of others, then they ought to be who know the least: These were the true considerations that direct me in the Dedication of this little treatise of the Law, which if you accordingly please to take into your favourable Patronage, and accept as a Monument or Remembrance of good will, You will oblige,

Aprill 27. 1660.
