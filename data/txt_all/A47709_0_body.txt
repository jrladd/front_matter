May it please your Sacred MAJESTIE,
PYRAMIDES and Sumptuous Aedifi∣ces were wont of Old to be Dedica∣ted to the Prin∣ces of this World, ignorant of the things of God, which though in shew splendid and Royall, yet Exceeded not the Bounds of nature, as savou∣ring
 merely things Corporeall, not Spirituall. Neither did the Virtue of these Princes mount higher, beeing altogether taken up with wordly matters. Fitly therefore were such temporall things Dedicated to them, who were not acquainted with Coe∣lestiall; But the loue of the Di∣vine worship, that imparalel Pietie of your Majestie, Known not onely to your Brittains, but to all Europe, cals for the Pro∣tection,
 not of the most magni∣ficent structures of this World, but of a building, though made with hands, yet that hath God Himself for the Architect thereof; Vouchsafe therefore, most Potent Prince, Great Brittains Protec∣tor and Defender of the things of God, to cast a Benign eye upon what is here represented to your Sacred Majestie, it beeing the Exact form of the Tabernacle, so as it was in the Wildernes, with
 the structure of Salomons Tem∣ple, the Holy Vessels, Garments and Utensils thereof delineated and set forth to the life. The which as it was graciously owned with devote affection 30 yeares ago and upwards, by that Serene Queen, your Majesties Mother, so be pleased most noble Prince, to imitate her Pietie: The Lord God of the whole earth preserve your Majestie for the Good of your great Empire; which is the
 prayer of him thal in all humilitie casteth himself at your Majesties Feet.
