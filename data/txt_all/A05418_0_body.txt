Sir,
ONE, whose
Birth ran∣ked
him not
in the extremes, by
Education trayned

up in the learned
Qualities, by an in∣nated
desire of a me∣lioration,
a Travailer
in forraine parts, at
length by accident a
Souldier, who at
length, seeing that
Bellum was but
Jactus Aleae, making
a faire retreate, and
resigning his Sword
to Mars, retyred
himselfe to the for∣mer
unforgotten

tranquillity of his
pleasing and most
recreative Studies:
amongst the rest, be∣ing
desirous to
breath himselfe of
his last and lost labo∣rious
times, hap∣pened
upon the e∣ver-vernant
and pri∣vate
walkes of Na∣turall
Philosophie,
(which are not ac∣cessible
to all, nor
every one admītted,

but onely Students,
by their prerogative
and Priviledge)
where (having an
eye not incurious)
it being lawfull to
enter the very bo∣wels
(as I may say)
of her secresies, not
without infinite plea¦sure
I penetrated her
Arcana, and open∣ing
her Cabinet, fin∣ding
her full of Curi∣osities,
and having

free licence to take
what I thought fit,
and I culling accor∣ding
to my best fan∣cy
and liking, se∣lected
none, but
what I thought,
might not only con∣tent
my selfe, but
generally recreate
all: which not with∣out
lesse industry
than pleasure I ha∣ving
knit up into
this Florum Natu∣rae





fasciculum, or a
Nosegay never fading,
gathered in Natures
owne Garden, I so
highly prizing them,
solely intended to
Devote and Dedi∣cate
them to your
Honour, whose af∣fection
to Learning
was ever sincere, to
Travailers noble, to
Souldiers (like your
selfe) honourably
loving. Wherefore

my Noble Lord, I
beseech your Lord∣ship
to accept this
Present, and to pa∣tronize
with your
gracious protection
this handfull of Cu∣riosities,
devoted un∣to
you by the Heart
and Hand of a Stu∣dent,
Travailer, and
Souldier, who with
the Poet,
Sint Maecenates, non
deerunt Flacce Maro∣nes:

boldly concludes,
and firmely resolves
with permission, to
be ever
