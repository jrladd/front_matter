My Lord,
THis Sermon which not long since had the honour of Your Lordship's eare, I have now made bold to present more publickly to Your Lord∣ship's eye, being ambitious to let the world see that those great obligations of Duty and Honour which the Author owes Your Lordship and illustrious Fa∣milie,
 are a part of my debt also, not on∣ly as related to Him, and a Father be∣fore Him, eminent by your Favours, but also in the honour of being knowne to your Lordship and most Noble Fa∣mily, and also by many Favours per∣ticularly obliged to subscribe my selfe with all gratitude and zeale,
My Lord,
