YOV will find that at the
Writing of These Col∣loquies
the Church of
Rome stood in great
need of Reforming;
even in the Iudgment
of Erasmus Himself, who was an Emi∣nent
Member of That Communion.
You will find Reason also, from the Can∣dour
and Moderation of our Learned Au∣thor,
to Distinguish even betwixt the
Romish Doctors Themselves. You will
perhaps find matter enough of Diversion
besides, to mollifie the Evil Spirit, and
to turn some Part of the Severity and
Bitterness of the Age, into Pity and
Laughter.
But when you shall have found all
This in the Dialogues Themselves, you

have no Obligation yet for any Part of
it to the Translator▪ who made Choice
of this Piece, and of this Subject, for
his Own Sake, and not for Yours. 
will have him to be a Papist in ∣querade,
for going so far; Others a∣gain
will have him to be too much 
Protestant, because he will go no fur∣ther:
So that he is crush'd betwixt the
Two Extremes, as they hung vp Eras∣mus
himself, betwixt Heaven and Hell.
Vpon the sense of This Hard Measure,
he has now made English of These Col∣loquies;
and in This last Edition add∣ed
two more to the Number; partly as
a Prudential Vindication, and partly
as a Christian Revenge.
