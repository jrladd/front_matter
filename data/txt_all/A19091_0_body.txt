RIght worshipfull Knight my verie good Patron, al∣beit I made a que∣stion of vsing your name, for the pub∣lishing of so small a matter as this sermon is; yet I easily resolued that sith it had pleased you to craue the copy thereof, you would pardon mee to grace it with the dedication. I
 might wel doubt to offer so little wher I owe so much, but that I considered that small offices sometimes are testi∣monies of great affectiōs, & presumed that according to your wonted loue, you would take the wil in good worth, howsoeuer the worke seeme to bee of small import. Accept it therefore I humbly pray you, as a very thankfull acknowledgement of your great fa∣uour towards mee, both in calling me, first to the place where now I liue, and giuing me since such respect and coun∣tenance, as whereby I haue with com∣fort and contentment enioyed the same.

 the day of the Lord Iesus. As for this sermon, being but a countrey exercise, if any shall thinke it not so well po∣lished as that it should bee fit in this sort to goe abroad, your approbation shall be my excuse, and in that nature I commend it to you that haue desired it, wishing with it to you, and to your whole house, all happines and honour, and that the Oliue by my seruice im∣planted into your stocke, may yeeld many branches, to the enlarging and strengthning thereof, so resting al∣waies
