Renowned Sirs,
THis Sermon, preached some Moneths since, and at the importuni∣ty of many Friends, now pub∣lished;which hath gotten of all this time of its suspension, and intended utter suppression, no higher an esteem with its unwor∣thy Author, had need when forced out, to seek for Patro∣nage: Neither are there any to whom I could more willingly and confidently engage my self for such a favour then your selves; whom I have cause to preferre in my thoughts, not only for your undeserved Re∣spects upon occasion to my self, (which I would hereby with all thankfulnesse acknowledge) but also for the Renowned Un∣dertakings, Hazards and Suffer∣ings you have undergone for the Publique. It is gratefull to me, that I should by the Providence of God, Date thisEpistle to such a Sermon in this Moneth, which but a year since was the season of so many hazards, and dreadfully threatning Dangers, to your selves principally, and to ma∣ny others with this poor Town of MANCHESTER, which so willingly offered themselves with you in that Cause of GOD you so signally engaged in: Shall it ever be forgotten by us, what the Lord hath wrought? May not that holy Providence and Power of his be for ever adored, that hath in such a short time turned for us our Mourning into Rejoycing? That those proud Waves should be so soon and remarkably bro∣ken upon us, and be now like waters that are passed away.I hope the profit of these Dan∣gers and Deliverances shall re∣main with us, as a sufficient and lasting ground of engage∣ment upon our hearts to fear, serve, trust and delight in that God who hath thus wrought for us.
And if this poor service may any way tend to the recording and perpetuating of our sense of this wonderfull Mercy, and of our faithfull and loyal en∣gaging for, and rejoycing in the glorious Return of his Gracious Majesty to these Nations (where∣in the People of these Two Counties engaging with you as their faithfull and active Leaders have cause to conceive they have a double share) I have the ut∣most I could aim at in this sodespicable an undertaking. And humbly craving pardon for this boldness, I commit you to the blessing of that God that per∣formeth all things for us: And am

Manchester,
