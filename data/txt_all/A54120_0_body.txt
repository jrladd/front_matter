WHen our dear Lord Jesus Christ, the Blessed Author of the Christian-Religion, first sent forth his Di∣sciples, to proclaim the Happy Approach of the Heavenly Kingdom, among several o∣ther Things that he gave them in Charge, it pleas'd him to make this One of their Instru∣ctions; Into whatsoever City or Town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is Worthy; fore-seeing the ill Use Unworthy Persons would make of that Message, and with what Unweariedness the implacable Pharisee and subtil Scribe would endeavour to Pervert the Right Way of the Lord, and thereby pre∣judice the Simple against the Reception of that Excellent Testimony.
This being our Case, who above every Tribe of Men are most Maliciously Repre∣sented, Bitterly Envied, and Furiously Op∣pugn'd by many of the Scribes and Pharisees

of our Time, for as Impious Wretches as Those of that, reputed our Blessed Savi∣our and his Constant Followers, it becometh us in a Condition so desperate, to provide our selves with some Worthy Readers, Men that dare trust their Reason above Reports, and be Impartial in an Age as byass'd as this we live in; whose Determinations shall not wait upon the Sentence of Ignorance nor Interest, but a Sincere and Punctual Examen of the Matter.
And since there are None recorded in Sacred Writ, on whom the Holy Ghost con∣ferr'd so Honourable a Character, as the Be∣reans of that Age (for that they both sear∣ched after Truth impartially, and when they found it, imbraced it readily) for which they were entituled Noble) Therefore it is that to you, the Progeny of that Worthy Stock, and Noble Bereans of our Age, We, the so much Calumniated Abettors of the Cause of Truth, choose to dedicate this Defence of our Holy Profession from the Injurious Practices of a fort of Men, who not unlike to the Jews of Thessalonica, that, Envying the Prosperity of the Gospel among your Ancestors, made it their Business to stir up the Multitude against the Zealous Pro∣moters

of it. And no Matter what it be, provided they can but Obtain their End of fixing an Odium upon the Quakers: They do not only boldly condemn what they esteem Worst in us (how deservedly we will not now say) but slyly insinuate what is Best, to be Criminal.
The Sobriety of our Lives, they call a Cheat for Custom; and our Incessant Preachings and Holy Living, a Decoy to Advance our Party: if we say Nothing to them when they interrogate us, 'tis Sul∣lenness or Inability; if we say Something to them, it is Impertinency or Equivocation: We must not believe as we do believe, but as they would have us believe, which they are sure to make obnoxious enough, that they may the more securely bait us for it; Nor must our Writings mean what we say we mean by them, but what they will have them to mean, lest they should want Proofs for their Charges: It was our very Case that put David upon that sad Complaint, Eve∣ry day they Wrest my Words, all their Thoughts are against me for Evil; But to David's God we commit our Slander'd Cause, and to you the Bereans of our Age.
Degenerate not from the Example of your Progenitors; if you do, you are no longer True Bereans, and to such only we inscribe this Work; if you do not, we may assure our selves of the Justice of a Fair Enquiy and an Equal Judgment.
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ augment your Desire after Truth, give you clearer Discerning of the Truth, and enable you both more readily to re∣ceive, and with greater Resolution to main∣tain the Truth. We are
