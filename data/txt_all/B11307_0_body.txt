EXCELLENT LO.
SALOMON saies; A good Name is as a precious oynt∣ment; And I assure my selfe, such wil your Graces Name bee, with
Posteritie. For your Fortune, and Merit both, haue beene E∣minent. And you haue planted Things, that are like to last. I doe now publish my Essayes; which, of all my other workes, haue beene most Currant: For that, as it seemes, they come home, to Mens Businesse, and Bosomes. I haue enlarged them, both in Number, and Weight; So that they are indeed a New Worke. I thought it therefore agreeable, to my Affection, and Obligation to your Grace, to prefix your Name before them, both in English, and in Latine. For I doe conceiue, that the La∣tine Volume of them, (being in the Vniuersall Language) may
last, as long as Bookes last. My Jnstauration, I dedicated to the King: My Historie of HENRY the Seuenth, (which I haue now also translated into Latine) and my Portions of Naturall History, to the Prince: And these I dedi∣cate to your Grace; Being of the best Fruits, that by the good En∣crease, which God giues to my Pen and Labours, I could yeeld. God leade your Grace by the Hand.
