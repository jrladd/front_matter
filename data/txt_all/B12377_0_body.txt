RIght Honourable and Reuerend, I presu∣med, long since, in∣stead of a better present,
Lord Elsmere Lord Chan∣celor of Eng∣land. to Dedi∣cate my Act Sermon to that no∣ble Lord (my honourable Master) who now rests in peace, and found acceptance. Whom, me thinkes, J
see in part described, when I reade that of Posseuin, concer∣ning the excellent Historian Thucydides who is stiled by him,
Posseuin. de Historicis, Sect. 2. Acutus, concitatus; ner∣uosus, densus, solidus, & sapi∣ens. And I may adde that which was eminent in that noble Lord (an especiall note of solide iudge∣ment) his Constancie. For (as Tully speakes of Cato) grauita∣tem perpetua constantia ro∣borauit.
Cicero de Offic. lib. 1. He was not like Alci∣biades, in conciliandis ami∣citijs, quam in retinendis vir melior; But did ratherimitate that famous Emperour Augu∣stus Caesar;
Sueton. in August. Caesar. Cap. 66. Qui amicitias ne∣que facilè admisit, & con∣stantissime
retinuit. But that which did crowne all his naturall and morall parts, was his pious care and courses in furnishing the Lords vineyard with good labourers. For he conferred not preferments for gaine, but freely, and nobly. And (that which was extraordinarily honourable) hee rather enquired after well deser∣uing men, then stayed till be was sued to. I write what some o∣thers haue done, and many, I doubt not wil ingenuously acknow∣ledge. Now, your Lordship ha∣uing beene to that noble Lord (ab∣sit inuidia verbo) like the belo∣ued Disciple to our Sauiour,
Saint Iohn. con∣uersing with him in matters di∣uine
and humane, and succeeding him both in the seat and actions of Honour, with generall applause: I haue beene emboldened to pre∣sent vnto your Lordship these Sermons, which many my worthy friends in Court haue much desi∣red, and to whom, for the publish∣ing of them, I am by promise in∣gaged.
The God of heauen multiplie his blessings vpon you, to the good of this Church and Common∣wealth.
