INtending long since
(my very good Lord) for the
benefit and delight of my Coun∣trimen,
to haue set foorth a
description of the whole world
in our owne Language, accor∣ding
to the consent of the aun∣cient
and late VVriters, I
thought this mine Author Pomponius Mela, for hys
breefenesse, order, and perspicuitie, to bee a very fitte
ground to begin with, for those three partes which were
knowen in former ages: purposing, therewithall to haue
added some breefe collection of the late wryters, concer∣ning
the description of the other partes, which beeing ey∣ther
vtterly vnknowen, or very lyghtly and darckly glaun¦ced
at by the men of auncient tyme, haue since beene
better discouered and brought to light, by the continuall
Nauigationes of the trauellers of these our latter yeeres.
And as my meaning and hope was then, to haue made
this first enterpryse of myne as a frame of a buyldinge, to
haue beene set vp and finy shed by mee more exactly, after∣ward

at further leysure, accordinge to the small ability of
my poore skyll; or as a roughe hewen Image, to haue beene
perfected and polyshed by the industry of some other per∣son
of greater readyng, better skyll, and longer experience,
and finally to haue beene beautifyed and furnished wyth
more particular and large discourses, bothe of the places
and of the notablest thinges whych eyther the places
themselues doo naturally yeelde, or haue beene doon or
made in them by the famousest personages, whome the
wrytinges of our auncestors haue made renowmed vnto
vs: So least this worke of myne (which hath slept now many
yeeres) might passe away as it were in a Lethargy, wher∣by
I of the performaunce, and my Conntry of the enioying
of any fruite of my duety in this behalfe, myght be vtterly
bereft, and so consequently my sayd purpose and the tra∣uell
taken to the setting forward thereof, should bee of
none effect at all: I haue caused the Printer to put to hys
helping hand to the preuenting of that perrill, whych
thinge wyl easely be doon, if it may please your good Lord∣shippe
(according to your accustomed good wyll towar∣des
such as any way indeuour, eyther to further others or
to profit themselues, in the knowledge of lyberall Artes)
to permitte thys my trauell to shroude it selfe vnder
the shadowe of your protectyon, that beeing by your ∣uour
after a sort quickned and cheered vp againe, it may
if not growe in tyme to full rypenesse, yet at least∣wyse
yeeld the pleasure of the infancy, the delight wherof,
may chaunce to bee such as shall prouoke some person, y∣ther
to traine it vp to full grouth, or to vndertake the doo∣ing
of some better worke of the same kynde. And for the
more inlarging hereof with substaūce and variety of mat∣ter,

both delectable and profitable, as farre as tyme would
permytte: I haue delyuered vnto the Printer hereof the
Polyhistor of Iulius Solinus, and certayne trauelles of
one Andrew Theuet, lykewyse translated long a goe to
bee added as appendauntes to thys worke of Pomponius
Mela, that as they treate though diuesly, yet cheefely of
one ground, so they may ioyne in one volume to remayne
together to the behofe of posterity, vnder the security of
your Lordshyps fauour, vnto the whych I most humbly
commend my selfe, and these my simple dooinges,
wrytten thys sixt of February. 1584.
