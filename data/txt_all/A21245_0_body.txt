SIth that most barbarous and Go∣thish opinion (right noble Sir) of the contrarietie of Learning and Armes, and the impossibili∣tie of their concurring in the same person to any perfection, is largely confuted by the many examples of those worthie Gre∣cians and Romans who did not only flourish in both, but did therfore far excel all others in martiall glory, because they had sacrificed vnto the Muses: I hope there is none so grosly ignorant, or so peruersly en∣uious, that will condemne my want of iudgement for chu∣sing a patrone whose profession may seeme contrarie to the nature of this subiect: in which hope I am the more con∣firmed, because sundrie of your Lordships publike emploi∣ments, besides your priuat studies, doe amplie witnesse, that as your noble brother (the true knight of Minerua) hath to his eternal honor augmented the nūber of those few who in this last age of the declining and degenerating vvorld, haue honourably emulated those auncient Worthies: so your selfe treading the same path of Vertue, haue by like desert purchased to your name & house, a second eternitie.

And as I doubt not that all indifferent persons wil forbeare vnfriendly carping, so likewise when I consider either the subiect, or the first and chiefest author thereof, I presume of your Lordships acceptance. For what more excellent mat∣ter or more worthy of a Philosophers penne can be treated of, then that which is he bond of humane society, and the perfector of our reasons vse, which while men wanted they seemed not men, because vvholy resembling beasts? Or what Philosopher can in depth of knowledge equall Ari∣stotle, vvhose workes may be iustly tearmd, The Treasurie of humane wisdome? all which as they sauour of diuinenesse, so amongst them all, these his Discourses of Gouernment haue not the meanest relish thereof; especially vvhere hee handleth the changes and destructions of euery Common∣weale, vvith their causes, and sets downe seuerall precepts for the vpholding and preseruing of each: vvhich vvhoso∣euer doth aduisedly read, can doe no other than say of him as Cornelius Nepos in the life of Atticus dooth say of Tully, Prudentiam esse quodammodo diuinationem: for what he so many years since did vvrite, hath bene in all points exactly verefied by Examples of following times, descending euen to our present age. I vvill therefore referre the further con∣sideration of his generall worth and this particular vvorke, vnto your Lordships wisedome, humbly suing that if his French attire become him better than his English fashion, wherein my penne hath for the most part suted, you vvill vouchsafe the harshnesse of the stile for the hardnesse of the matter, and deigne to shadow the disgraces of my defects by the grace of your protection: in which desire and hope I stay my pen, beseeching the Almighty to multiplie in you all earthly and heauenly blessings.
