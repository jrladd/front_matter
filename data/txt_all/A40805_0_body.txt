May it please your Grace,
I Have in the following Dis∣course, undertaken a Vin∣dication of those publick Loyal
Declarations of this Church and Kingdom, which are of great concernment, not only in the Civil Government, but also in the Christian Religion: and I hope your Grace will there∣fore not account it improper that this should be presented unto your self. For the chief things I have taken upon me to defend, are such special Branches of the Doctrine of our Church, that in this part and Age of the World, they are in a manner peculiar to it, and to them who with it have herein imbraced the true Reformed profession. But both the Roman Church, and divers other different Sects
and parties, among their other Errours and Heresies, enter∣tain such disloyal Positions as are of dangerous importance un∣to Government, wherein (be∣sides some other things) there is too near a Conjunction be∣tween them.
And these things are of so great consequence in Christia∣nity, that the main Foundati∣ons of Righteousness, Peace, and Obedience are thereby esta∣blished, all which necessary du∣ties are much insisted on by our Saviours Doctrine. And there∣in the regular and orderly beha∣viour of inferiour Relations, is particularly enjoined, for the
gaining reputation to our Reli∣gion; because a temper fitted for Christian subjection, sup∣poseth Pride, Passion, and Per∣verseness to be subdued; and that in the fear of God, an Hum∣ble, Meek, and peaceable Spirit is introduced, which are things wherein our Saviour hath gi∣ven us his Example.
And the principal matter of this Discourse concerning the Kings Supremacy in all Cau∣ses, and the unlawfulness of Subjects taking Armes, is of the greater concernment, be∣cause the contrary ill Princi∣ples which many have imbibed, have been very pernicious to
several parts of the World, for many hundred years past. Which hurtful Positions have prevail∣ed the more among men, by their being covered over with plausible pretences: as if those of the former sort were needful, to assert the just interest and ho∣nour of the Christian Church; and those of the latter sort, to provide for the safety of the Common-wealth, and of eve∣ry Mans own propriety. All which would represent the secu∣lar Authority, which was or∣dained by divine wisdom for the good of Mankind, to be a thing exceeding hurtful and mischie∣vous to the World.

Wherefore since men are much led by the consideration of their interests, that what I pro∣pose may be the more successful and effectual; I have shewed that Obedience, and peaceable subjection to Governours with∣out resistance, is not only a du∣ty, which is enough to perswade all good men to practise it, but that it is the common advan∣tage of the World, as the whole duty of Man is, both to Ru∣lers and to Subjects. And that Royal Supremacy in Causes Ecclesiastical, is not prejudicial to the Christian Church, I have only expressed more covertly and succinctly; because though
this may be considered by some men, there is another interest, to wit, that of the boundless ambition and avarice of the Romish Court and Church, which chiefly instigates their opposition hereunto: and I must confess that the truth I defend, doth not gratify this interest. But that tendeth best to pro∣mote the advantages of the Church in the World, when the goodness of our Religion, and its preserving all just rights of Superiours as well as others, doth so recommend it to the World, as may gain to it the good opinion of all men, the fa∣vour of Princes, and the blessing of God.

And though I am conscious to my self, that by reason of the greatness and copiousness of the subject I have taken in hand, there may be several defects in my performances, notwithstand∣ing my diligent endeavours; yet I presume humbly to tender them to your Grace, in confi∣dence that your Candor, and readiness to give a favourable acceptance to well designed, and not unuseful undertakings, and to make charitable allowances for their imperfections, doth bear an equal proportion with other parts of your great worth, by reason of which you possess your great dignity with a gene∣ral
satisfaction to good men, and the Friends of Truth and Peace. And that you may long and hap∣pily continue here to the benefit of the Church, and may see the Church it self in Prosperity, and true Piety flourishing, all the dayes of your Life, is the desire and Prayer of him,
