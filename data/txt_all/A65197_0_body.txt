MADAM,
To be a nursing Mother to the Church, is the dignity and duty of a QVEENE; to which attribute see∣ing you have a right, as well by your vertue as your honour, I am emboldned to prostrate my selfe, with this small Treatise, at your Royall feet. It hath pleased God out of his infinite, and by mee, never-to-be-forgotten
 mercy, to call me to the Communion of the Catholique Church; for which I have also been called to account, and that in your Ma∣jesties family; which hath moved me (with other considerations) as to publish this my de∣fence, so to crave your Majesties Patronage both of it & me. Never did persecution against Catholiques in England rage as now it doth; where like Herod, who as soon as Christ was borne, sent forth men to destroy him; So they, as soon as one is made a Catholique, or known to be so, seek his destruction. And as Herod because he would be sure (as he thought) to destroy Christ, destroyed all the Children that were about his age; So doe they pursue the le∣gall Protestants, as having a little resem∣blance with Catholiques, that so they may (as they hope) spunge out all the remains and me∣mory of the Catholique religion.
And as God sent our Saviour into the world, and subjected him to all humane infirmities (except sinne) like unto us, that he might be mercifull; So hath he hum∣bled your Majesty, even to a lower descent of suffering (considering your exaltation, from whence it must take its measure) than any other, who like an invaluable Diamond, were made to be firmely set in the
 most precious esteem of mankind; but by the unrelenting malice of monsters have been brought to extreme degrees of calamity: whose excellence as it is endeared to us all by your sufferings; so our sufferings (your heart being the more intendred by the sense of your own) we hope, shall render your Majesty the more propitious to us; who suffer not only as good subjects to the King, but to God also in the Ca∣tholique religion. Your gracious soule hath more antidote in it, then all the world hath poyson; which will therefore in your affliction make you like the Sun, which shewes his great∣est countenance in his lowest declension; and bring you out of it, like gold out of the fire, re∣fined, not consumed; which when it doth, as the good theef did our Saviour on the Crosse; So we beseech you Madam, remember us when you come into your Kingdome. In the mean time, we will remember you in our praiers; That your fortune may surmount your great∣nesse, and your vertue your fortune; That your greatnesse may be above envy, your good∣nesse above detraction; That your illustrious example may darken the ages past, and light∣en them to come; that you may live beloved and die lamented; lamented by earth, but joy'd by heaven; of which you shall be a part
 as well as a partaker, in giving the happinesse of your presence, and receive as a reward of all your fufferings a never fading Diadem of glory: So prayes,
MADAM,
