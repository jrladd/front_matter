MAdam, your many honourable ver∣tues, hauing tyed mee to your eter∣nall seruice, to shevve some part of my dutie, I present your Ladiship with a fewe passionate Sonnets, inter∣mingled

vvith the loues of Dom Diego and Gineura.
Daine (gentle Lady) to ac∣cept them, and therein shew the greatnesse of your benig∣nitie, in receiuing curteouslie a gift of so smal worth, which though it cannot any wayes equall eyther the number of your vertues, or the greatnes of that noble house, whence your Ladiship is discended, impute it not (Madam) to my defect of iudgement, but of Fortune, for were I furnished with the greatest riches that

blind Goddesse could bestow on a man of my state, both they, and I woulde fall pro∣strate at your feete, and euer rest at your Ladiships deuo∣tion: yet Madam as it is, it is a chylde of the Muses, & ther∣fore worthy to be cherrished, conceiued in the braine of a gallant Gentleman, & there∣fore to be fauoured: sent into the worlde by mee, who haue euer honoured your Lady∣shyp, and therefore craue of your Ladiship to bee protec∣ted,

to whom I euer vvishe long life, lengthened with all honorable happines.
