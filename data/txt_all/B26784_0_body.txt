What was lately sounded in the ear is here presented to the eye, word for word, without any enlargement of my notes, to make them swel in the Press, being unwilling to obtrude more upon the publick view from the Print-house, then what had approba∣tion from the Pulpit, the hand that pointed my meditations to this sub∣ject, and induced me to make them publick, was love to peace and truth, and pity of the despicable condition of the multitude of those which under the misprision, delusion, or restiveness of Conscience, dayly make shitwrack of faith and a good Conscience, (in oppo∣sing themselves to the lawfull com∣mands of the higher Powers) and so run headlong into the Abyss of Gods judgements in this world and in the world to come, (as Oxen to the slaugh∣terhonse,
 and Birds to the snare, not knowing or valuing that it is for their lives, if any reforme by hearing of their faults, I have gained a Soul, Jam. 5. v. 19, 20. Brethren if any of you do err from the truth, and one con∣vert him, let him know that he which converteth a sinner from the error of hi way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
But if thereby he be the rather con. firmed in them (for the same Sun which softens wax hardens clay) how∣ever I have delivered my own Soul, Eze. 3. 19. yet if thou warn the wick∣ed, and he turn not from his wicked∣ness, nor from his wicked way, he shall dy in his iniquity but thou hast delive∣red thy sonl, which is all the designe of him who is (whether thou hear or for∣bear)
