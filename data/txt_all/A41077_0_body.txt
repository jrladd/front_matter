AS I live Gentlemen, I am a∣maz'd how any Piece could be made such minc't meat as this hath been by a twice-printed Co∣py, which I find flying abroad to a∣buse the Author, who long since tra∣velling for Companies-sake, with a Friend into the Low-Countreys, would needs for his own Recreation, write this Essay of them, as he then found them: I am sure as far from ever thinking to have it publick, as he was from any private spleen to the Nation, or any person in it; for I have moved him often to Print it, but could never get his consent, his modesty ever esteeming it among his Puerilia, and (as he said) a piece

too light for a Prudential man to publish: th truth is, it was meerly occasional in his youth, and the time so little, that he had for observation (his stay there not being above three weeks) that it could not well be ex∣pected, he should say more, and though the former part be joculary and spor∣tive, yet the seriousness of the latter part renders the Character no way injurious to the people. And now find∣ing some ruffled Feathers only pre∣sented for the whole Bird, and having a perfect Copy by me, I have presu∣med to trespass so much upon the Au∣thor as to give it you (in vindication of him) so as I am confilent it was dressed by his own Pen. And after I have begged his Pardon for exposing it without his Warrant, I shall leave you to judg by comparing this and the former Impressions, whether or no he hath not been abused sufficiently.
