May it please your Grace,
IF there be any room for Books amidst our common and deep sorrows for the death of that excellent and most beloved Prince, the late King Charles the Second of ever bles∣sed Memory, I am willing to hope, that this little piece may not be altogether unwelcome to the World, because the subject

of it is of standing and most ne∣cessary use, especially in Times when we are most apt to recol∣lect our selves, and can find no such solid and substantial Com∣fort, as at Gods Altar. And since I have presumed upon your leave, to prefix your great Name to this following discourse, I am in all justice and duty bound to give your Grace an account of this undertaking.
Among many great Calamities, which were the effects of the late intestine War, this was one, That the Holy Communion was in some places so sparingly used, in some so wholly neglected, in most so little consider'd, that we seem∣ed to be in danger of quite losing a main part of Christianity. The unity of the Church being bro∣ken, variety of pernicious opini∣ons about the Sacrament was in∣troduced,

to disparage and abo∣lish it; which took such Root in peoples minds, that for these five and twenty years last past, it hath been a matter of no small diffi∣culty to restore it to its due E∣steem and Observation in some tolerable measure. Controver∣sies either with Papists or with o∣ther Sectaries took up the greatest part of Mens time and pains: And tho' some Books of De∣votion have been written upon this subject; yet 'twas impossible to conceive how this Mystery could be restored to its right use, till Men were throughly informed of its Nature and Ends; which popular Men in the late times seemed to have very little under∣stood, or very superficially to have looked into. Therefore to serve the World in this particular, di∣vers have lately laboured hard;

but none seem to have done it with greater solidity, or better success, then that excellent Di∣vine and Truly good Man, Dr. Symon Patrick, now Dean of Pe∣terbourgh; to whom even the learned part of the World is much indebted for his pains upon this Subject; which indeed have been so aboundant, that to write after him may be thought to be only the doing of the same thing over again, which was better done before. However considering how scandalously great the Igno∣rance and mistakes of many People are still concerning this matter, and finding that the Government hath been awakened at the sense of those dangers which Church and State both are in by reason of mens straglings from this weighty Ordinance; I thought it necessary for me, in the execution

of my Office to bestow some considerable time upon the Sub∣ject of the Sacrament, to treat of it purposely, and as fully as I could, and to accommodate my self to the Apprehensions of those that are of the most vulgar and ordinary understandings, by discoursing upon this Theme after a plain Catechetical manner. This could not well be done, but by going over the whole, and by discoursing first of the Notional or Doctrinal part: in the pro∣secution whereof; as I thought it proper for me to observe the same instructive Method which others had taken, so I thought it necessary to look narrowly into two things especially, which the the Generality of men have not throughly examined and searched into. First to look into the na∣ture and use those Ancient Sacri∣fical

Banquets, which some few Writers of late have very luckily taken notice of. For, in regard that this Christian Feast doth bear a great Resemblance to those Feasts which all Mankind did anciently celebrate upon part of their Sacrifices, I did conceive that to give a plain and full ac∣count of them, would be the best way both to open the mean∣ing of this Feast, and to remove many great Errours which divers Opinionators, especially the So∣cinians, do entertain concerning this Mystery; who have corrup∣ted and debauched the minds of of men, by those mean and un∣sound Notions, which they have vended abroad in the World. Secondly 'twas necessary to look into the genuine meaning of the Real Presence of Christs Body and Bloud in the Sacrament. For in

this point abundance of poor peo∣ple are at a loss, being not able to understand it so fully and clearly as they ought. And having to do in that particular with the Romanists, who are wont to cheat men into the sin of Apostacy by urging those words of our Saviour, This is my Body, and this is my Bloud; it was ab∣solutely requisite for me to give such a fair account of the meaning of those expressions, as might con∣sist with the Faith of the Catholick Church, and serve to satisfie the minds of men fully and clearly. For tho enough hath been saidagainst Transubstantiation, and most people among us are convinced of the false∣hood and absurdity of that Do∣ctrine, yet it requires a great deal of pains to open and unfold the right Faith concerning the real presence, so as to render it intelligible and clear; because it is an easier matter

to overthrow an Error, than to esta∣blish a Truth. And altho in the ex∣plication of this matter I have ad∣ventur'd more than many of our Divines have done, yet am I sure, that I have followed herein the sense of the Ancient Church, which is enough to justifie and bear me out; however, I am not so vain a person, as to pretend to be mine own Judge in this, or any other case.
And now, Madam, since these papers are committed to the Press, if any shall wonder at the pu∣blication of them, I hope no man will think it strange, that I pre∣sume to lay them at Your Graces feet, and entitle them to your Noble Patronage; if they will but consider, that there are no Expressions of Dutifulness and Honour due from the Lowest Servant to so great a Personage,

but Your Grace may lay just claim to them from me.
It may perhaps be matter of some discourse, that I should offer this to your Grace singly, without begging the Patronage of him too, who is your Noble Husband, and my Natural Ma∣ster and Lord. And, I confess, I can hardly think what to say to the World, that in the Dedica∣tion of a little Book I do not joyn Both your Graces together, who are (Blessed by God) in In∣terest, and Affection, and Reli∣gion, and in all respects, Undi∣vided. The truth is, his Grace hath often given me the Ho∣nour to address my self to him after this manner: and if my De∣sires now are to Express this my Duty to your Grace alone, I know such is my Good Lords Affe∣ction to Your Grace, that he will

not think it a Fault in me, or (if the World shall think it so) will easily pardon it, if your Grace will be plea∣sed to forgive my presumption.
Madam, I have no more to add now, but to beg that your Grace will favourably accept of my hum∣blest Acknowledgements; and to beseech▪ God whose good Provi∣dence hath knit both your Graces together, that the fortunate Band may prosperously continue, nei∣ther dissolved nor weakened, through the long Succession of many the most happy years: That those mutual Affections which are so Eminently between You Both, may Vigorously Hold to a good old age, and make your Graces equally Examples of the sincerest Love, as of Vertue and Piety. That your Grace may be a fruitful Mother of a great Race of Noble Children, to inherit your

Fortunes, Honour and Vertue, and to perpetuate your Names to the Worlds end: That my Young Lord, that is now in the Arms of your Love, may long live a Blessing to his Parents, and to the whole Nation: That in the midst of those Uncertainties, which the Course of this World makes us subject unto, the Goodness of God may ever Rest upon your Graces, and on your whole Family: That God will vouchsafe to protect, guide, prosper and preserve you, and bless you with all the blessings of heaven and earth; which is the sincere and Earnest Prayer of,
Madam,
