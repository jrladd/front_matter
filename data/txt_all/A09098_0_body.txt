THis work I did intend to Mercury,
Before his wings were sick, and he could fly:
But now the Gods incensed, all together
Have layd diseases upon every feather:
(Alas) he cannot raise himselfe nor carry
His plumes, as does the rest of all the Ayrie:
But is retired to some shady Grove,
To hide him from the great incensed Iove.
And where to find my Patron to deliver
This little worke of mine; I know not, neither
If he were found (and no discretion lost)
This title might offend him, or me most.
Now all ye Gods beare witnesse, I intend
Onely to shew a bounded thankfull mind

Unto this Mercurie, by whose quicke fire
My Muse being lately wounded did respire.
And whether sinne of these two be the lesse?
A feare in Conscience, or unthankfulnesse,)
Judge Heavens; And vouchsafe me onely this,
What's well intended be not tooke amisse.
And now goe on my Booke, and seeke about,
Till thou hast found this unknown Patron out:
And tell him thou cam'st from an unknowne friend,
Whose Love's a Circle, round, without an end.

Ante leves ergo, &c.
