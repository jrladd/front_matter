KInde Fellowes, Brothers and Friends, (I dare not call you Gentlemen, though some of you were borne, and some esteem'd or made so)
I have made bold to dedicate this Herculean la∣bour to your Various Censures; entreating

everyone of you in particular to doe me the favour as to make the sixe here depictured, to be in number seaven; If you bee free from all Aspersions and Imputations which are Repeated of in the following Lines: then you are unfit for the Brother-hood; for all fooles are not so that weare Coxcombes, Pyde Coats and Bables, and there may bee a Golden Asse as well as a Gray one; Will Sommers was a Foole by Art, to King Henry the eight, and Patch was an Idiot to Cardinall VVolsey. Iohn Garret, was an indifferent Iester, (but all Iesters, Ieerers, Flowters, Scoffers and Mockers are not to bee safely Ranked amongst the number of Fooles or Asses,) Tom Derry, was Harmelesse and Simple, and therein came neerest to the nature and estimation of a silly Honest Foole: But all that is nothing to Ar∣chye, for he is of a wise and more wary Garbe; hee knowes a piece of Biefe from an Iron Wedge, and a Velvet Purse from a Sowes Eare. Hee is well knowne from others, and

may be trusted with untold Milstones: the truth is, that he is much to be beloved for those Good parts hee hath, and sure there are many that did never receive harme by him, or do de∣sire it; And so my good Patrons I leave my Lines and Labours to you, and you to fortune and the world, whose favourites you are or may Be, as she pleaseth to be friend you.
