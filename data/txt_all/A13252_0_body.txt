WHen I had fi∣nished this briefe Testa∣mētarie trea∣tise, bethin∣king vvith my selfe (most re∣uerende Fa∣ther,) vnto vvhose patro∣nage I might dedicate the same: In the end I did resolue to make an offer there∣of vnto your Grace: Being moued there∣unto vvith the consideration, partlie of mine ovvne duetie, partlie of your Graces interest. For being a member of your Graces Courts Ecclesiastical, and hauing
 novve receiued sundrie good fauours at your honours handes: This I thought might fitly serue for a probable argument of my thankfulnesse in that behalfe. And on the other side, forasmuch as before all others vvithin this prouinc of Yorke, it apperteineth principally vnto your grace, to prouide that testamēts lavvfully made, be dulie executed, being novve by Gods merciful prouidēce Metropolitane & or∣dinarie of that sea, I could not see a more vvorthie Patrone for a testamētary vvork. Partly therefore by these former conside∣rations, but especially I vvas encouraged therunto vvith the cōtemplation of those diuine graces of piety, learning, zeale, gra∣uitie, bountie, benignitie, affabilitie, and al maner not onely sufficiencie, but excel∣lencie of vertuous giftes, vvherevvith the giuer of all goodnesse hath vvonderfullie enriched your honourable minde. Where∣fore as hitherto your vvisdome hath bene accustomed to entertaine vvith comfor∣table countenance, such as be studious to benefite either the Church, or the com∣mon vvealth, though othervvise they bee of small reputation: so novve (most reue∣rend) I am vvith all duetie to craue the
 continuance of the same in mine ovvn be∣halfe, together vvith the fauourable pro∣tection of these my labors, so farre as they bee agreeable to truth, right and equi∣tie: vvhich thing I doo so much the more humblie desire, by hovv much I may seem ouermuch aduenturous in making choise of so honourable a patrone, for such a tri∣fling treatise. The Lorde of might and mercie multiplie his spirite vppon your grace, to the aduauncement of his ovvne glorie, and the good of his Church, vvith encrease of manie yeares in health and happinesse.
