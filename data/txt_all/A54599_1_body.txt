MY LORD,
THIS Treatise presents it self also for your Lordships Concurrence, wher∣in I have clearly stated the Kings Interest in our Mines by his Pre∣rogative, according to the most ancient and best Record; I have also added the particular Cu∣stomes of some Counties, and other Discourses of things relating to our Societies. And I did once resolve to have inserted, first the reasons why we do not make such benefit of our Mines and Minerals as we might do; and secondly, the remedies which may be used for the better mana∣ging of them; But I do forbear to publish them, because I have seen the bad effects of Printing those worthy Designs concerning Fishing, the Guiny Trade, and Farthings, &c. for if they had been only in the breast of the State, till every cir∣cumstance and opposition had been well weigh'd, re∣solved, and (unexpected to others) put in execu∣tion, they would have redounded much more to the publick advantage: And this Affair of our na∣tive Mines and Metals is much of the like nature,
for I conceive the King and Kingdoms Interest is first to be considered; Next, how the Pro∣prietors may be so sweetned by profit to them, that they may not only concurre in voluntary Discoveries, but assist in their Operations, (and this may be done without diminution of the Kings Prerogative;) Thirdly, how we may supplant Foreiners herein, who hitherto have supplanted us; Fourthly, how to countenance Discoverers, either by rewards or assistance; Fifth∣ly, to encourage Lessees, and to prevent their fraud, of which hitherto many have been too guilty; And lastly, how by these to make some honest and reasonable profit to our selves. And that these may be the better digested, it is hum∣bly recommended to your Lordship, That a Committee of the Societies may be chosen (being upon Oath) which may Modell these Heads, or more, into fit Representations to His MA∣JESTIE; and according to his Approbation, the Societies to put them in action; and to them I shall be ready to represent my thoughts and Considerations, with a constant recourse to your Lordships Ʋniversal Knowledge, which may di∣rect us in the most facile way of effecting what is aimed at, by,
My Lord,

Anno 1670.
