SIr,
happening to finde by chance, among my Law-papers, the originall print of this Pamphlet, in Latin, as it was acted at Wit∣tenberg in Germanie during my abode there and afterwardes sent ouer to a friende into England. I thought good, in asmuch as wise men ioyne all their pleasures with some profitable conse∣quence, to deeme it worthie your view, wherewith your Worsh at time of your leysure with your recreation may beholde in the way of a iest, manie earnest absurdities of mens conuersations. May it please your W. to accept of it, I haue my wish.
This 4. of Iune 1595.
