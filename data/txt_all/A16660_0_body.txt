SIR,
I Haue long sought the expressiō of my thoughts, which haue euer with all sinceritie tendred them yours: but how infirme is conceit without fur∣ther demonstration? Loue is a deepe effect of the soule, which vndisco∣uer'd,

struggles, yea strangles her∣selfe till shee be deliuer'd. I haue many times purposed to offer some vowes next to him, whose diurnall prouidence (if nought else should in∣duce) and his Maiestie, whose Halcyon-raigne makes vs happy, vnto your Selfe, to giue argument of my loue, the exquisite Idea of hu∣mane life; and now haue I seconded what I intended, though not in that perfection as my intirest wishes ay∣med. It is a great defect (and I haue noted it) not in will but worke, nor in purpose but power, to see so many extended desires limit their issue to leane effects: which fareth vsually to best-affected dispositions, where affectionatest thoughts are bu∣ried in silence for want of a tongue to discouer them. I will say no∣thing, for much speech rather argues affectation, than intimacie of affe∣ction: here be certaine Essaies or

Obseruations, or what you will, di∣lating vpon the fiue Senses, where∣to, as to their proper Obiects and Subiects they are limited: where you shall finde (as questionlesse you haue found in your selfe) the eares choicest harmonie to be Gods glory, the eyes cleerest vision his contem∣plation, the noses sweetest posie, the odours of his mercy; the tastes de∣lightfull'st fullnes, meditation of his goodnesse; the Touches mouingst action, the feeling of his Passion. Many subiects I confesse excellently composed, whose Title deriues their essence from Essaies; but few re∣strained to these Obiects, which the devout Father termes those win∣dowes which open to all vnbounded libertie; organs of weale or woe, happy if rightly tempered, sinister, if without limit. For in what erre wee and take not the occasion (as primitiue source) from one of these? The

fable of the Syrens had allusion to the eare, of Ixion to the eye, of Ata∣lanta to the taste, of Mirrha to the smell, of Semele to the touch: where the eare not temperately restrained was soone inchanted, the eye lightly affected was to misery exposed, the taste for want of due relishing foyled her that was vanquishing, the smell too rankly breathing brought it selfe to perishing, the touch too highly aspi∣ring, through her ambition fell to ruine. These were excellent types, and not vnbeseeming the purest and piercingst eye: now it rests, that I draw in my sailes, least my gate be too great for my worke, onely thus much I may confidently say,
If my Presumption err, my thoughts replie,
It is my loue that errs, it is not I.
may I euer so direct my subiect as to render you content, whose deseruing

parts make me honour you, more then that title of honour which is confer∣red on you, vowing to rest
