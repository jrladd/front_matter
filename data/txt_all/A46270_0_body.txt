Much honored Sir,
WHen you shall please to make
a review of your own serene
Merits, and peruse with
pausing Curiosity these Poe∣tical
Imperfections, my fears are that you
will condemn my Confidence; but my
hopes are as great, that you will commend
my Prudence: from whence I extract
this presumption, that though all Cri∣ticks
should comply to cry down my Wit

in composing my Poems, they shall ap∣plaud
my Judgement in the choice of my
Patron. Sir, Your own deservings de∣clare
You to be no less then a Palace of
Honour, if these Poems like a Vine, or
Woodbine, may support themselves upon
your Edifice, they shall, by this fortunate
transplantation, grow more fragrant, and
gratifie your Indulgence. The business of
the whole World is but folly diversified,
nor can I make a better Apology for my
Poetry, but that it is Vanity in variey;
yet no less innocent then those Actions
which the noblest Persons in the wor∣thiest
Times have esteemed their clearest
Recreations. I must confess that the mul∣tiplicity
of reasonless Rhymers and i∣gular
Readers, have very much deface
the Majesty of Poesie, but one beam of
Your favour will re-inthrone it. Sir, you
will finde some pieces in this promiscuous

Gallery very plainly drest, but withall
very properly; for my aims were always
rather at aptitude then altitude, and to
make my Compositions more genuine then
gorgeous, it is no more proper in Poets
then in Painters, to clothe a Tinker in
Tissue: Sir, (in one word) Your Candor
hath compell'd me to make these Poetical
Addresses, if any thing in them may ei∣ther
provoke Your praise, or pardon, I
shall congratulate that happy means,
which hath safely conducted me to so
splendid a sphere of Love and Ingenui∣ty,
and be alwayes studious to deserve
(what I have been ever ambitious to de∣sire)
a seat in Your memory, and liberty
to subscribe,
Sir,
