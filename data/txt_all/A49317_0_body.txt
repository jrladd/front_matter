My Lord,
TItles do not so much make some Men great, as show them to be so; Gold has an intrin∣sick value in it, even before the Stamp; thus the Hon∣ours of your Family, and the Favours and Smiles of your Prince, which yet are very great Happinesses, are not the essential Ingredients

of your more solid and intrin∣sick Nobility. Vertue and Piety are the great Orna∣ments and Stability of the Throne it self; nor is it a less Happiness to a Kingdom, when Nobles inherit their Fathers Vertues together with their Fortunes: Thus should I have look'd upon that long Train of Vertues, which your Lordship takes more pleasure in practising, than in having them recoun∣ted, almost as hereditary to you, if thereby I might not seem to lessen your personal Title to 'em; and I hope you will give others leave to

express what they are so inti∣mately sensible of, the great Benefit and Advantage they receive by such benigne In∣fluences.
My Lord,
I shall not here attempt a∣ny thing by way even of your Lordships just Charact∣er, because the greatness thereof, and your own native averseness from all such Pane∣gyricks, do wholly discou∣rage me herein, so that this will be the pculiar Caracter of this Epistle Dedicatory, that it comes as fr short of the real worth of its Patron, as others usually exceed t.
Only your Lordship must pardon me and others, if in this declining state of Religion and Piety in the World, we call in the Aids and Assistan∣ces of such Examples as are a∣ble, not only to recommend the practice of Vertue to o∣thers, but also to render it, even Honourable in the midst of a perverse Age.
But I am afraid that I am injurious to the Publick, whilst I thus employ your pre∣cious Minutes; if perhaps you vouchsafe to give this short Address the reading. I shall now only take this Opportuni∣ty, gratefully to acknowledge

those many Favours, which by the long Experience of many Years, I have received from you; it is to Your Lordship and Noble Family, that I owe these happy Retiremenrs, wherein I shall not be wanting to this part of my Duty, to pray for your long Health and Happi∣ness, and that God would long continue your Lordship to us, a great Example of all Ver∣tues, and a great instrument of publick and private Good. This is, and shall be the con∣stant Prayer of,
My Lord,
