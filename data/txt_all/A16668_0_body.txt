SO many kinde respects haue I had showne
From You and Yours, that if you were mine owne
As You are mine; for what can be more neere,
Then Loue and Blood contracted in one Spheere?
I could not prize Loue at a higher rate,
Nor to my selfe more kindnesse vendicate:
In lieu whereof, (but' lasse th' requitall's small)
I tender you this SPRING, and this is all:
Wherein, if ought tune fitly with the Time,
I'ue stil'd it Yours, it shall no more be mine.
