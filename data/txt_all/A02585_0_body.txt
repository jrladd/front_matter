SIR,
AMongst many
to whom my
poore labonrs
owe much for
their accepta∣tion,
I know none that can
challenge so deepe a debt as

your selfe. If others haue
tasted of my well-meant pa∣pers,
you haue fed heartily
on them; and so made them
your owne, that your memo∣rie
may compare with others
eyes, and your practise
with the speculation of o∣thers:
Neither haue your
hand or tongue bin niggardly
dissemblers of your spirituall
gaine. Vnto you therefore
(to whose name I had long
since in my desires deuoted
my next) do I send this meane
present: A Sermon impor∣tunately

desired of many:
That which the present Au∣ditors
found vsefull, the
Presse shall communicate to
posteritie; The gaine of ei∣ther,
or both is no lesse mine:
I doubt not but you haue al∣ready
so acted that part of
this discourse which concer∣neth
you, that the direction I
giue to others is but an histo∣rie
of what you haue done.
And go on happily (worthy
Sir) in those your holy cour∣ses
which shall lead you to
immortalitie; and so vse

your riches that they may be
made vp into a crowne for
your head in a better world:
My hearty well-wishes shall
not be wanting to you, and
your vertuous Lady, as whom
you haue obliged to be iustly
Worcester Aprill 14.
