Right Noble Lord,
YOVR humble ser∣uant hath obseru'd in the multitude of books that haue past his hands, no small varietie of Dedications; and those seuerally sor∣ted to their Presenters ends: Some, for the meere ambition of Great names; Others, for the desire, or need
 of Protection; Many, to win Friends, and so fauour, and opinion; but Most, for the more sordid respect, Gaine. This humbly offers into your Lo: pre∣sence, with none of these deformities: But as a bashfull stranger, newly ar∣riued in English, hauing originally had the fortune to be borne commen∣ded to a Grande of Spaine; and, by the way of translation, the grace to kisse the hands of a great Ladie of France, could not despaire of lesse courtesie in the Court of Great Brit∣taine, then to bee receiued of your Lo: delight; his study being to swee∣ten those short starts of your retire∣ment from publique affaires, which so many, so vnseasonably, euen to mo∣lestation trouble.
