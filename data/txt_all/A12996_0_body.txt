SOme priuate reasons moouing mee (Right Reuerend) to publish this my Treatise vpon the first Psalme: your Lordship by best reason, first aboue all other, came into my minde, to whom I mought dedicate it. Praece∣dens beneficium, sequatur officium. Among many other inducements, your Lordships speciall loue toward my selfe, and respect∣iue care for my good, hath necessarily chalenged this duty at my hand: Si grate hoc qualecun non beneficium sed of∣ficium Senc. de B∣ i lib. 2. cap. 22. meum accipias, non primam, sed totam eius pensnem soluisti. Your Lordships acceptation, shall be my sole sa∣tisfaction. The bond of my duty hath this onely bound of my hope.
The God of heauen so vouchsafe, to water you and yours with the dew of heauen; that you may with the Godly man in this Psalme, prosper, is trees of his planting, and so bring forth fruites in due season in this life, that at the end of this life, your reward may bee the beginning of this Psalme, euen, true blessednesse. Thus in all dutifull humility, I take my leaue.
