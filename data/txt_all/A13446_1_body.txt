NOT vnto euery one can Reade, I write;
But onely vnto those that can Reade right.
And therefore if thou canst not Read it well,
I pray thee lay it downe, and learne to spell.
But if thou wilt be hewing, (like a drudge)
Hewe on, and spare not, but forbeare to Iudge.
Thine if thou beest mine, Iohn Taylor.
