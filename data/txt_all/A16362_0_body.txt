Thrice noble, vertuous, and renowned Lady;
HAuing after long labour brought forth, this vnpollished birth; be∣gotten of many Fathers (ancient, and moderne) men famous (for arts) in their seuerall generations. I remaining no lesse carefull for its future, prosperous progresse: then I had beene laborious for its pre∣sent production. I therefore held it most necessary, to prouide for it, some godly guardian, and potent Patron to defend it from the iniurie of malig∣nant Momus and his snarling, yelping brood. But finding amongst men (to me knowne) none so much affecting this noble Science as I could wish. I therefore emboldned my selfe (though a stranger to your Honour) to commend it

vnto your Christian and noble Tutelage; and that so much the rather, because Fames trumpet sounds forth euery where your iust deserued Honour, in the loue vnto, (and practice of) this so noble a Science. For be it spoken with∣out adulation; where is there any woman liuing, that hath spent so much time in the study of this Art, and made so gracious & painefull a progresse in the practice thereof, as your thrice noble selfe. Do not the soules of the sick & sore, & the limbs of the lame, euery where (where ere you reside) blesse you; proclaiming to the world, that Exceters noble Countesse abounds in mercy, charitie, piety, pitty, com∣passion, bountie, affabilitie, humilitie, hospitalitie, and all other commendable vertues. And that shee is constantly cheerefull in the diurnall and painefull performances of these fame-meriting actions. Accept therefore I beseech your Honour of this poore Orphan, and place it within the pale of your Potent Patronage, and let it serue you in chiefe. And as you shall finde its abilities and worth; so esteeme it, so commend it. And pardon I pray you, the boldnesse of your poore neighbour in this attempt; And he shall euer rest during life,
