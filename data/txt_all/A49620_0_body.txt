MY LORD
It were needlesse to tell you, by how many titles this little Orphan booke, claimes the honour of your Lordps protection. First, by the law of nature, its parent dying in your seruice, you stand bound to bee a

foster father to it; againe it haueing been my fortune to contribute something to the bringing it forth to light, it hath a new relation to you vnder the title by which I haue long agoe con∣secrated all my endeauours to your seruice. But to passe by these two, there is yet a third reason, wherby it will appeare, not the effect of choise, but of necessity, that it should come forth vnder the fauour of your name: The wellgrounded experience which you haue gained in your trauells; the exacte and iudicious account you are able to giue of the places you haue seen, which make a great part of the subiect of this booke; the mature iudgment of the interests of states, and manners of people wherof it treats, which in you is not the after fruit of age;

the Gentile and courteous behauiour which you haue acquired, and which charmes all those who haue the honour to conuerse with you: These, I say, are vertues so peculier to your Person, and so conspicuous in the eyes of all the world, that the designe of this Booke being to forme the like in the rest of the Gentry of our Nation that pretend to trauell; It would bee a wrong to the publike to let it appeare vnder the Patronage of any other then of him that is the Idea of an accomplisht and consūmate Traueller. And this, I doubt not, was the reason, why the Author haueing had the honour to haue been a Gouernour to so many of the flower of our Gentry, made choise of your Lordship to be∣queath this worke vnto, by his last Will and Testament: And which

imposeth vpon me a necessity, both in compliance to the memory of my worthy friend and fellow traueller, and to the duty I owe vnto your Lordship, by the honour I haue to succeed vnto him in his last engagement, to offer vp this his last worke to you, as an euer∣lasting monument of esteeme and gra∣titude, of him who while hee liued euer was, and of him who liueing euer is.
MY LORD
