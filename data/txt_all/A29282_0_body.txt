Ever Honoured Sir,
IT is commonly sto∣ried concerning one of the Per∣sian Princes, that he kind∣ly entertained a Peasant, who being destitute of a better Present, presented him with a litte Water; And I question not, but conclude that you will shew your self as truly (and more spiritually) noble in
bidding your deeply enga∣ged servant welcome, who is bold to meet you with a little of this Cordiall (not common) Water. So hath the Lord (who cals things that are not as if they were) honoured me in your eyes, that you may (as too ma∣ny do) ever-value the mes∣senger; And I hope the Lord will so honour him∣self in your heart, that you shall never (as the most doe) undervalue the message. Long may you live to receive a cup of this Water from, and to give more then a cup of other Water to a Prophet in the
name of a Prophet! Bles∣sed be the Fountain of li∣ving Waters, who hath cau∣sed this Dew of Heaven to lye long on the place near you; And oh that poor souls may for ever call the Lord blessed, who through four such precious (though ear∣then) channels, causeth this River to empty it self among you, the streams whereof make glad the City of God. The Lord shewre down this rain of spirituall blessings upon you and yours; and continue you to be an owner (in dis∣owning times) of him and his! So prayeth he who
desireth ever to entertain you in his heart, who hath been so deceptably enter∣tained in your house;
Sir,
