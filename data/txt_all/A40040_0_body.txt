Dear BROTHER, and MADAM,
IF it had not been the Custome, to eeke out every Pamphlet, with some Dedicatory Paper; I should have done, as some people do with their Brats, let them lie to the Patronage of any, that would take them up. For I could never yet understand, the Advantage of the Common Cry, viz the craving and desiring Pro∣tection: since a Good Book is its own Patronage; and no man will have a better Opinion of the Bad, for a few Epistolary lines to a Third person; Especially of

late Times, when I have known some Presbyterians dedicate Wickedness it self to God Almighty, Treason to the King, Sacriledge and Schism to Bishops, and the worst of Villanies to Good Men.
Though I love good Company, yet me thinks there is no Perfect Enjoyment, with those, whose Greatness is rather an Awe than Society to the rest; where Fla∣tery is an Obligation, though the Object merit nothing but Pity or Scorn.
But here the Case is altered, the Neerness of Re∣lation, Familiarity and Acquaintance, making all Commendations, Ridiculous; and Complements, Odi∣ous. Which is the Reason, that, at This Time, your Names are here Prefixt, by
Linc. Coll. Oxford, 23. April, 1662.
