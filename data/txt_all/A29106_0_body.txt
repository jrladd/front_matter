Right Honourable,
IN Obedience to Your Commands, I present You with this Plain Discourse, heartily wishing it may be of Use to those Ends for which I preach∣ed it.
I charitably believe, That the greater part of those who yet remain dissatisfied with the Establishment we are under, are not so from Malice, but from Preju∣dice; and that if they could once get into a just way of Thinking calmly and sedately, they would soon change their present Opinions. This I have endea∣vour'd to lead them to, without giving them any just Cause of Offence, whereby to increase their Prejudices, instead of removing them.
Could we of this Nation once again be so happy, as to become thoroughly One Body, both as Members
of Society, and as Christians; as it would be one of the best Expressions of our Gratitude to Almighty God, for the many Deliverances he hath granted us; so it would be the shrewdest Revenge we could take upon our Romish Adversaries, and effectually dis∣hearten them from attempting any farther upon us.
I am persuaded, that the Greater Part of the Na∣tion in general, and of this City in particular, stand well-dispos'd towards such an Union; and 'tis pity that the Weakness of some, and the Design of others, should hinder the Effect.
Your Lordship is what I would persuade others to be; I mean, An Hearty and Constant Friend to the Church and State; and Your Practice, as well as Your Profession, exemplifies what in this Discourse I aim at.
That it may please Almighty God to Preserve, Di∣rect, and Bless Your Lordship, and by his good Providence to Increase the Number of such Magi∣strates, is the Prayer of,
Right Honourable,
