SIR,
A Dedication, from its frequent u∣sage, is now grown, as it were, so absolutely necessary, that a Book without One, may be said to be much in the same Circumstances as a Child without a Parent to own it, or at least a Godfa∣ther to answer for it: A Prescription for it may be pleaded beyond the Aera of Printing, even from the first use of Letters, and the very Infancy of Learn∣ing: This may Warrant it in general, but my own many Obligations exact this publick way in particular of expressing my grateful acknowledgments to you; which I must confess, nevertheless are at best, but a very unsuitable and indifferent Retribu∣tion.

I shall say little here in relation to this Alien, which I have ventur'd to Natura∣lize; nor of you whom I have chose to Patronize it. I am sensible, a true Gentle∣man bates a nauseous piece of Flattery, and would not much care for a Recital even of those modest Encomium's he is known to deserve. If he may merit your Esteem, and the Book's Commendations may balance its Errors it will be a suf∣ficient Recompence and Satisfaction to the Translator.
Such as it is, I have ventur'd to sub∣mit it to Censure, requesting your Pro∣tection and Patronage, which favour will strictly engage me to be in the highest re∣gard,
Honoured Sir,

Feb. 6. 169.
