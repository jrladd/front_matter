Renowned Prince:
THough nothing can be excel∣lent nor acceptable, that springs from a rude Inuen∣tion; neyther are Flowers greatly esteemed when the Spring-time is past: and ill may hee discourse of Fire, whose conceipts are wholy frozen: or any man produce things worthy of the Light, that hath his owne resi∣dence in datknesse. Or if he laboured to embel∣lish these defects by Art, hee should but doe quite contrary to the Beare; for whereas shee giues forme to her VVhelpe with her tongue, hee with his, should but blemish and deforme the same. Neuerthelesse, as all Creatures are re∣duced to perfection, not of themselues, but by a more powerfull Influence, and Celestiall

Bodyes, of their owne proper nature being ob∣scure, receiue light from the Highest Soue∣raigne: no lesse I thought that this my little Off-spring, and defectiue Traueller, now open∣ing his eyes, and taking light from the most bright beames of your Highnesse splendor, vertue, demerits, and greatnesse, and so coast∣ing and sailing about by the most benigne and happy aspect of so fortunate a Starre, as also bearing in his Frontispice, the most Honoured Name, happie Prediction, and propitious Pri∣uiledge of so great a Prince, I did, and doe hope, his Muse will become fecond, and the thicke troubled waters of his moorish Fountaine will turne pure and cleare; he prouing such an one, as wheresoeuer hee arriueth, eyther with his fame or his body, a large way will be made him not onely of entertainment and acceptance, but further, of approbation. Neyther can a blast of winde disseuer these my hopes, in that I know very well (most famous Heroe) that your High∣nesse imitating the Sunne (which disdaines not euen in the humblest vallyes, to send forth the effects of his vigour and comfort) the care of waightier affayres shall not absolutely exclude those, which many times are thought light and

little importing, these being as amiable and pleasing, as the other are waightie and dange∣rous. Moreouer, if by the mindes affection, all things must be waighed and measured, my Tra∣uellor (to speake but truth) neede not giue place to any other, containing in it an infinitenesse of will, though but a smalnesse of worth.
VVherefore in all dutifull humilitie of heart, I humbly request your Highnesse, no lesse with your gracious Eye and Countenance, to accept, then with you most noble Spirit and Vnder∣standing to imbrace the same: the which as a slender pawne and earnest (I dare presume to say) euen of sworne and deuoted Seruice, toge∣ther with my most vnworthy Selfe, I offer, and in forme of a perpetuall vow, to your Highnesse the same doe consecrate. Thus wishing to your Highnesse, from the Omnipotent, and all-pow∣erfull hand, the accomplishment of your hearts desires, bending most humbly both my knee and heart, I remaine,
