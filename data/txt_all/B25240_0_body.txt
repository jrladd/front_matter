THese Sermon Notes, Preached by your Appointment and Entreaty at two severall Ordination, and which Of M. Willi∣am Hender∣son, Aprial 13. 1640. And of Mr. Iohn Bra∣bant, Iu 9. 6. since, partly through the importunity of some of you particularly, at severall times (which yet took little Impression then) and chiesly upon the earnest motion since, of the whole Classis Assembled, were length (though not promised to you then yet afterwards, whilest I looked on Gods Call by you) made ready for the Publick View; I now present unto you.
You have made them your own by your care nest solicitation and request. Mine they are, and I own them for matter of pains, and what∣soever weaknesse and defects may espied in them. Gods they are for his assistance, and for whatsoever is good, true, and wholesome in
 them. The Churches they are for use, benefit and Instruction; for whose good, next to Gods glory (seeing you have judged them fit to be Published for those ends). I have now made them yours, to be disposed of by you. If now, upon further perusall, your Eye shall second and ap∣prove of the former judgement of your Eare, you may have liberty (for me) to make them the ob∣ject of other Mens Eyes, as well as your own. But then if others look not on them with a like bene∣volent Eye and aspect, you must also look to beare a like share with me in such censures as the curious, if not scornfull Eye of some shall cast upon them. However, I shall entreat the Father of Mercies, to give unto his Church and People, in these di∣vided and unbrideled Times (being otherwise hopefull for Reformation and true Liberty) the Spirit of Power, of Love, and of a sound mind and judgement.
So I rest and remaine still the same in this mine. Old Age, that is, The Lord Christs, yours, and the Churches Servant. Aged. 67.
