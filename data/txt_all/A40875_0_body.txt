My Lord,
HAving long since devoted my self to a
Country Life, and wanting Patience to
attend the leisure of the Stage, I have
adventur'd to exposed this Tragedy, with∣out
Action; but I shall never be much asham'd of it,
since it has had the Honor of your Lordships Appro∣bation,
whose admirable Genius in Poetry, has long
since given you a just Title to preside over all Causes
of that kind, and whose Judgement never Errs, but
when 'tis seduc'd by your Extraordinory Candor. Yet to
have a share in your Lordship's Mercy, rather than
all the Clamorous Applauses of the Vulgar, shall ever
be esteemed a greater Honor to,
My Lord,
