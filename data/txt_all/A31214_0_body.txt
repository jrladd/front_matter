I Lay at the Feet of your Ho∣linesse
these my Conside∣rations
concerning the
MENSURATION OF
RUNNING WATERS:
Wherein if I shall have succeeded, being a
matter so difficult and unhandled by Wri∣ters
both Ancient Modern, the discovery of
any thing of truth hath been the Effect of
Your Holinesses Command; and if through
inability I have missed the Mark, the same

Command will serve me for an Excuse with
Men of better Judgment, and more especi∣ally
with Your Holinesse, to whom I humbly
prostrate my self, and kisse Your Sacred
Feet.
From ROME.
