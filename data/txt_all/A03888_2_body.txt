IF, in this Storme of joy and pompous Throng,
This Nymphe (great KING) come euer Thee so neare
That Thy harmonious Eares Her Accents heare,
Giue Pardon to Her hoarse and lowlie Song:
Faine would Shee Trophees to Thy Vertues reare,
But for this statlie Task Shee is not Strong,
And Her Defects Her high Attempts doe wrong,
Yet as Shee could shee makes Thy VVorth appeare.
So in a Mappe is showen this flowrie Place;
So wrought in Arras by a Virgines Hand
With Heauen and blazing Starres doth Atlas stand,
So drawen by Chare-coale is Narcissus Face:


Shee maye Aurora be to some bright Sunne
Which maye perfect the Day by Her begunne.
