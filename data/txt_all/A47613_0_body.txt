WHEN I think of that Separation Death
hath made between you and your beloved
Pastor (my dear Brother) it causes sadness
to seiz my spirit; Sure, such Stroaks of the Al∣mighty
should bring us upon our Knees; I wish
you are not hereafter made more sensible of the Na∣ture
of these sore Rebukes, then at present you can
be; however let us learn this Lesson by it, not to o∣verprize
or value any thing or Person short of Jesus
Christ; 'Tis good in all things to labour against in∣ordinateness
of affection; We can't, 'tis true, love
God too much; nor Christ too much, but we may
love Ministers too much, nay, idolize them, esteem
them above what is meet, as many in former times
have done, or we may esteem them not enough; whe∣ther
any of you have bin guilty herein or no, will
now I am perswaded be discovered; if duty to God,

our solemn Vow and Covenant with God and the
Church, and our Love to Jesus Christ, will not make
us to know and keep our Places, what may we judge
of our selves, or others judge of us: I am not with∣out
fears I speak of some in respect of temptations of
this kind, I pray God deliver them from it, lest they
bring up a reproach upon the good ways of God;
You had or would be looked upon all of you, to have
a real and cordial love for him that is now taken from
you, O then do nothing after his death that would
have grieved his soul were he alive; Labour to live
in love, and strive to keep the unity of the Spirit in
the Bond of Peace; I having this opportunity, thought
it not amiss to give a hint or two of this Nature
And now beloved, as concerning this Sermon, had
it not been Preached in part to fulfil the desire of the
deceased, I should not have presumed to have taken so
weighty a work upon me, especially in the Presence
of so many able and worthy Ministers, as I am not so,
(the Lord knows, I look upon my self no ways meet,
or fitly qualified and capacitated for such a weigh∣ty
work I am called to) And truly, brethren, 'tis not
any excellency and worth that is in this broken Ser∣mon
that is the cause of its Publication, 'tis the de∣sire
and importunity of several amongst you, and
some others, that hath brought it forth; I do think,
nevertheless, for the sake of him at whose Desire and
at who'e Funeral it was Preached, you will entertain
it though never so poor and mean a work.
I told you what sorrow had seized my spirit, I

Preached with a heavy heart, and with a
mournful spirit, I know you fate under the
hearing of it; alas, I cannot blame you for your
mourning, he was a most sweet and choice
Preacher, most excellent skill had he to dive into
Gospel-Mysteries; he saw, if I may say without of∣fence,
as far into a Text of Scripture, as most men
now surviving, and as careful in dividing of the Word
that every one might have a portion in season; O
how sweetly has this Trumpet sounded in your ears,
what spiritual joy hath it raised in your hearts! O
how powerful in Prayer hath he been! Hath not his
prayers and Tears over sinking sinners, tended to melt
their Adamant hearts! O the thronging there hath
been about him, no marvel he had precious bread al∣ways
to break unto the children; he knew how to
feed with milk, and how and when to feed with
strong meat; It was his delight, I am satisfied, to do
his Masters work, and in doing of it, I may say, he
loved not his life unto the death.
He is gone to eat the fruit of his labour, and I
wish, that all those Choice Sermons you have heard
from his lips may not be buried with him, I hope the
fruit of them will be seen in your lives; and could
some of them be made publick, they might be very
serviceable unto the People of God and others in
general. I shall at present say no more, but earnestly
desiring the Lord to continue the Labourer you
have, and send some other in due time amongst you,
to the making up that great loss which at present you

do sustain, so that sinners may be in the midst of you
converted, and true believers strengthned, encoura∣ged
and comforted, and all built up together in love,
to the end that you may be found without blemish
in the day of Jesus Christ, and that it may be so, is the
desire, and shall be the Prayer of him
