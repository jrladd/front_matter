May it please your Lrdship,
I humbly crave your leave, to inscribe your noble name to this Translation of the Late
Cardinal Mazarini's Will and Testament with some Remar∣quer of his life; from just though different respects.
The first is your Lordships knowledge and particular ac∣quaintance with that great and eminent personage, while you follow'd our Soverains Fortune in that Court in the same quality of his privy Counsellour, which afforded your Lordship in your prudent and serious converse with him an experience of his abilities; improved to great advantage in your many Loyal and Noble services to this Crown.
To do the Cardinal so much right therefore, I have presum∣ed
to put this last MEMO∣RIAL, of him into you Honorable hands,  the fittest and equallest Repository of his Illustrious Name, which shall now pass without profanation to the world, when sacrated by YOURS.
The other respect is to signi∣fie and declare to the world the due sentiments the Nation hath of your Lordships Conspicuous worth, together with the parti∣cular acknowledgements and obligations which I am bound to render for some Favours abroad, which your Lordships singular Noblenesse was plea∣sed to vouchsafe me.
And consulting herein also to
my self this further favour from your Goodness, as to shelter my meanness under your Lordships patronage, which is sufficient to vindicate the Cardinal, and to protect,
My Lord
