To the Honoured The Lady Susanna Holworthy; William Crompton Minister of the Gospel,
Dedicateth the following Dis∣course, of the Perpetuity of a Re∣generate mans Estate.
In opposition to that pernicious Doctrine of the Saints Apostacy;
As a Testimony of the great Honour and Service so justly due from him, and all that know her.
Presuming on her perseverance in Grace and Title to Glory.
