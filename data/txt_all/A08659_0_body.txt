SIR,
YOur Gracious acceptance of the first
fruites of my Trauels, when You were our
Hope, as now our Happinesse; hath actu∣aea
both Will and Power to the finishing
of this Peece: being limn'd by that vnperfect light
which was snatcht from the howers of night and re∣pose.
For the day was not mine, but dedicated to the
seruice of your Great Father, and you selfe: which,
had it proued as fortunate as faithfull, in me, and
others more worthy; we had hoped, ere many reares
had turned about, to haue presented You with a rich
and wel-peopled Kingdome; from whence now, with
my selfe, I onely bring this Composure:
Inter victrices Hederam tibi serpere Laurus.
It needeth more than a single denization, being a
double Stranger. Sprung from the stocke of the

ancient Romanes; but bred in the New-world, of the
rudenesse whereof it cannot but participate; especi∣ally
hauing Wares and Tumults to bring it to light
in stead of the Muses. But how euer vnperfect,
Your auour is able to supply; and to make it wor∣thy
of life, if you iudge it not vnworthy of your
Royall Patronage. Long may you liue to be, as you
are, the Delight and Glorie of your People: and
slowly, yet surely, exchange your mortall Diadem
for an immortall. So wishes.
