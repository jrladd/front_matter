RIght honorable and truely vertuous Lady, elect in the Lord, your favo∣rable accepting with the hand of Charity; my Lords Prayer unclasped, oblieges mee in more speciall, to dedicate this short Treatise, cald A Plea for the Common Prayer Booke, unto your singular goodnesse. I have found our Churches Prayers set light, and by those who ought
to have beene as shining lights in the midst of this our more then E∣gyptian darkenesse. This is it hath made mee set pen to paper, in some poore measure to vindicate as our Lords Prayer before, so now the Prayers of our Church. I am sure to meet with Hericano's and the grand gusts of malecon∣tented spirits: I humbly therfore crave leave this my decurt Trea∣tise may shroude it selfe under the Lee of your acceptance; and if the Lord in his mercy allay these windes of boystrous ca∣lumniators of our Churches Ser∣vice, within my short time I have heer to stay, I shall put to Sea once more again, and purpose in my next Bottome, to Land that Staple Commodity, A Treatise upon the lawfull Calling of our Mini∣stry, according to the Canons and Constitutions of our Mother, Church of England. A Subject,
I assure you, most fit to bee layd open and maintayned, lest in a very short time, we lose the name Christian. Madam, I am loth to promise much, and perform no∣thing: therefore this short I rea∣lise I devote to your service, and subscribe my selfe, as bound,
