My Lord,
I Thought to have sent this Trifle into the World without Patron, or Authors Name to it, but 'tis well
known, how scandalous it is to that Child, whose Pa∣rent is ashamed to own it; I therefore resolved to run the Censure of a Critical World, and then observing how antient Dedications have been both by Greek and Latine Authors, and that they are continued to this day throughout all Christendom, I resolved not to be singular: and then con∣sidering, that this little Ʋn∣dertaking was performed at the Request of some reve∣rend Clergymen of Your Lordships Diocess, and that
it was nursed up to what it is now presented to your Lordship there likewise, I conceived it could not chal∣lenge the Patronage of any other more properly than of Your Lordship; and there∣fore such as it is, I here humbly present it to Your Lordship: My Lord, at first I designed no more but the Second Part of what it now is, but observing Your Lordships diligent and great care at Your Lord∣ships Primary Visitation at Derby against Simony, Dilapidations and Non∣residence,
the three great Pests in the Church, I ad∣ded three Chapters upon those Subjects, and after ad∣ding one thing after ano∣ther, it came to make a di∣stinct Part of this Work a∣lone. My Lord, Your Lord∣ship has had many Honou∣rable and Worthy Prede∣cessors, and I cannot forbear to mention to Your Lord∣ship, Your immediate Pre∣decessor my Lord Bishop Hacket, with what indefa∣tigable Industry did he re∣pair, or rather re-edifie the Church at Lichfield, which
he happily lived to finish, a Work could hardly have been performed by any o∣ther; how circumspectly, prudently and diligently did he govern his Church, never absenting himself, unless in his Majestie's and Countrey's Service; how constantly did he visit and preach through his Dio∣cess? A Religious Pattern for all his Clergy, what great Insight had he both in the Civil, Canon and Common Laws, that related to the Church Govern∣ment? How oft did he sit
in his Consistory to see Ju∣stice done? Nay, what did he neglect that became a Worthy Prelate to do? and for his deep and profound Learning in his Function certainly few exceeded him, if I have any Judg∣ment. My Lord, I have ob∣served three things perpe∣tuate mens memory to Po∣sterity, Children, Learned Writings and publick and eminent Buildings, he was fortunate in them all; he has left a Worthy Son to inherit his Name, Virtue, and Temporal Estate; he
has left many Learned Works for the benefit of Posterity, whereof some are already made publick, and he has made himself no less eminent by his publick Buildings, witness his Ca∣thedral Church at Lich∣field and Trinity Colledge in Cambridge, where he had his Education; besides many other Works of Piety and Charity in those few years he was Bishop. My Lord, God has not yet blest you with Children, but may in good time to preserve Your Name, and I have
heard Your Lordship in∣tends some eminent Works for the Publick; and that Your Lordship intends to go on, where Your Prede∣cessor left, in Building a Palace for Your self and Successors, I have great rea∣son to believe, having heard Your Lordship so often de∣clare You would do it, and having laid Your hand to the Plow in preparing some Materials towards it, I know You will not look back; Your Lordship is a great Lover of Hospitality,Titus 1.8. which can never be so
splendid as in a Palace of Your own Building: And hereby Your Lordship will make Your self as eminent in the next Age, as Your Worthy Predecessour is in the present, than which no∣thing can be greater satis∣faction to all, but chiefly to
My Honoured good Lord,
