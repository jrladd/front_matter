Sir.
DId not my naturall duty and Allegiance to
your Sacred Majestie oblidge mee to this
performance, the Gratitude, and Rever∣ence,
I owe to the pretious Memorie of
your ever Glorious Father, would provoke mee to this
duty, Beesides both these, the trust and Imployments: I
had the honnor to receive from him, engage mee to an
account, and the discharge of my Loyaltie & Faithful∣nes
to you. Sr. I most humblie begge your Majesties
pardonne, that I make that discouerie of such treason∣able
Practises, which will perplexe, sooner then Satisfie
and quiett your expectation: The Subiect can give your
Highnes no delight, when it onely discourseth, the
Aspirings of an Ambitions Subject to a Crowne, of
Rightes appertaining to your Highne. Sr. I should

inexpressiblie Mourne my sad misfortune, should my
zeale to your Majesties service and happines, mistaken
encounter other effect, then what is cleerlie intended:
The preservation of your life, and Royall
Dignities.
Sir, should the disclosing of these Treacheries and
Falshoodes [wherin I present most eminent truths]
unhappilie encrease, or continue the disturbance in your
Majesties present and most important Affaires. [I
abiure from my very Soule the single thought of so bad
a consequence.] yet were I lest guiltie, then if I should
conceale the traitor, and by a calme, inconsiderate silen∣ce,
render myselfe accessorie to the Treason, If this con∣tribute
the least to your greate designes, I am highlie
rewarded in my service. I have satisfied my conscience,
and payde one debte, I owe to Truth to the God of truth,
and to your Highnes, Gods Amointed, and Vicegerent
my constant Actions shall witnes to the whole world,
that it holdes not a Person more.
Sir,
