OVR familiaritie is suche, that neyther we haue neede of preoc∣cupation, nor yet of many wor∣des in vtteryng our requeste. These circumstances therfore being cutte of, I shall euen at one woorde, desyre you, that this translation of your Antiprogno∣ may be publisshed and made cōmon for all men, that either haue nede therof to vnderstande their errour, orels shall haue pleasure therin to see the vanitie wherwith they haue ben blynded. The rather thus trā slated, bicause a great numbre of the busiest and most curious Astrologians in Englād vnderstand no latin at all, orels so symply, that they can not perceiue the mynde of a Latin writr, and also that the cōmon sorte of wel disposed men, may hereby take, some profite. But if you thynk good to adde som what in this edition for the vnderstandyng of the common people you shall doo well in my opinion. Thus fare you well.
From Seuenoke xxii. of Octobre.
