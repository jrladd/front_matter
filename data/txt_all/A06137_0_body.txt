CAesar (right Honourable) wrote but three
wordes of his victorie from Pontus to
his freends at Rome, Veni, vidi, & vici:
thoughe not like Caesar a Conqueror, &


victorum victor: yet like Solon not conâˆ£quered
& agestatis victor, presuming but
with the like wordes to dedicate this little Booke vnto
your Lordship, Veni ad te, vixi per te, & spero de te, and so I
rest, as one that hath registred himselfe your olde seruant,
and so hath decreed cum vto, to continue in good will
and seruice.
