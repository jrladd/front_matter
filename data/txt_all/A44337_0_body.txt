Good Mr. Dean,
ACcording to my promise I have now sent
you these Sheets, and have taken leave
to adorn them with your name to gain them
Recommendation to the Readers, especially to
the loving and beloved Citizens. Perchance this
taste of Hooker will invite the more ingenious
ort to study that incomparable Book of his in
defence of our church-laws and Liturgy, which
(after all the more eager writings of our time)
might serve to compose dissentions and make up
our breaches. This little piece will be able, by
Gods Grace, to make some impression (besides oâˆ£her
good effects) of Meekness and Obedience
upon every serious and impartial peruser. Which
o do is the end of this little adventure, and
ithal to shew my self,
Honour'd Sir,
