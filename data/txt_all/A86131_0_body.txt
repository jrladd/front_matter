THat I had no desire or meaning thus to ap∣pear in print, when I first undertook this Funeral Sermon, I suppose on my single as∣severation will easily be believed: But that the Sermon should be at the very instant of the delivery, in so honourable, so full an Au∣dience defeated and silenced, is a thing not so easie to be believed, without the attestation of many Witnes∣ses; That one single person usurping the Office of a Minister, but neither a Graduate, nor in Orders, nor scant of Age to be, nor ever intending (as I am informed) any way, old or new, to be, should by his clamorous impudence and shameless railing confound such a Solemnity, silence the Preacher ap∣pearing in the Pulpit, and drive all, that met to do honour to the memory of so worthy a Gentleman, out of the Church with∣out any Sermon, is an example of pity and boy-like petulance, such as I think can hardly be paralelled. Especially, sith neither the deceased Gentleman (for ought I know) nor the Preacher had ever affronted or provoked the said insolent Party in word or deed. My own wrong (I thank God) I least value, having learned by experience to bear many causeless
injuries with patience. But the wrong done to the deceased (a singular Ornament to this Countrey and to his Professi∣on) together with the injury and contempt of so noble an Auditory, consisting of Lords, Knights, Parliament-men, Esquires, Gentlemen, Officers of the County and Reverend Divines, so many, as in divers years hath not been seen in Caln-Church the like Congregation; such an insolence may not so well be passed over in silence, nor so Worthy a Company utterly defrauded of what they came to hear. I have therefore yielded to the request of divers friends that the Sermon may be published, and not buried with him, whose Memory and Vertues deserves never to be buried. And I have thought fit to dedicate it to you, by whose request it was undertaken, and who can best witnesse how little I sued or sought for the employment. Beseeching God it may help to mi∣tigate your sorrow for so invaluable a losse, and add some∣what to your comfort, and remain as a Monument of his good will to you and yours: who is many wayes obliged to be, and to continue
