As there is no∣thing in this world in eue∣ry respect bles∣sed, & in each particular happy; so there is no constan∣cy in humane things especi∣ally, and accor∣ding to Saint Jerome, of the felicity of this world, whilest we seeme to, possesse it, we part from it.
We see, and dayly experi∣ence proues vnto vs, what the condition and state of this life, with the goods of it is, the motion of it being (as Saint Gregory saith) so swift, the possession so vncertaine, as now we bee fatted in the fragrant po∣sture of pro∣sperity, now pined and lan∣guishing, & on the bare com∣mons of mise∣ry, so that nei∣ther in weale or woe, there is any con∣stancy, but all things are sud∣denly 

chan∣ged, and vary in a moment, so that we may repose more trust in letters written in the wind or water, then in the happinesse of this humane life.
According to Herodotus, it is as a circle of humane things, which by her turning suffers not a man to be al∣waies fortu∣nate and pros∣perous.
Ʋirgil ex∣claimes, Time alters all things: and Cicero tels vs, The course of this mutable life is vncon∣stant, and all the fortunes of men are vaine, voluble and variable: a meere Euripus for ebbing and flowing of worldly goods: in a moment our mirth be∣ing turned to mourning, & our sorrow in∣to solace.
The Royall House of the 

STVARTS, and the illustrious Family of the SACKVILES, not long since, had wofull ex∣perience. Of the Royal one, there being pulled from the boughes of it, two beauti∣full Roses, to wit, the two Noble Dukes of Lenox, LO∣DOVVICKE, and ESME, two rare Bro∣thers, of most vertuous and laudable con∣uersation. Of the other, a Noble branch was cut from that Tree of Ho∣nour; RICHARD, the most good and most No∣ble Earle of Dorset, and Ba∣ron of Buck∣burst, of happy and blessed memory: All which, in this yeere, within the space of fiue moneths, pi∣ously and peaceably slept with Christ.

Illustrious, and Gracious:
LEARNED CICERO, that King of ORATORIE, vvho telleth vs, that the course of this mutable life is inconstant, and the worldly fortunes of mortals truely vaine and variable, doth very e∣loquently commend History, calling it The witnesse of times; intimating, that wee could not attaine to the know∣ledge of seuerall actions, done at sundry seasons, but by her helpe, and how much the science of Histories profits, is proued, in regard they are the hand∣maids to Prudence and VVisdome, the which may be easily and truely purcha∣sed out of the deeds and examples of o∣thers, there written. How much it con∣duceth

to the good gouernement of Common-wealths to haue the exam∣ples of Councels before our eyes, it ap∣peareth, in regard of the general respect the wisest men haue had to them. Nei∣ther are true Histories a little commodi∣ous for shunning of horrible alterations and calamities: for they recite the ex∣amples of all times, for the punishments of Seditions, Treasons, and such other abominable Crimes, the which escape not vnpunisht, no not in this life: Out of which examples we may collect most wholsome instructions, for the good v∣sing of our both priuate & publike Of∣fices, that such Euils may be shunned in vs, which were punished in others; the which is true wisedome, accor∣ding to that in the Prouerbe:
Other mens harmes are wise-mens armes.
Plato saith, that a certaine Aeyptian Priest reprehended the Greekes, calling them Children, because they had no knowledge in Antiquity, they had no skill in the passages of former times, they were indued with no ancient and graue Science: For euen as children, through the imbecillity of their capaci∣ty, and slendernes of their intellect, can∣not discerne Vice from Vertue, good from bad: so they, whose mindes doe comprehend no knowledge of former times, deserued not to be called men, in regard they exceeded not children in vnderstanding.
For which cause, learned men in all Ages, haue not onely read diligently, but also written Histories carefully, by which kind of writing, they haue pur∣chased vnto themselues a liuing name.
The ANNALS of this He∣roicke Empresse, Queene ELIZA∣BETH,

I confesse, I haue rashly vn∣dertaken to translate: for the Subiect deserued a farre better and more skilfull Pen-man, in regard I am a Stranger: Yet, to shew the desire I haue to doe this Noble Nation seruice, (as bound in duety) I haue faithfully the best I was able, finished my Enterprize, which I hope will be very beneficiall to all Ho∣nourable and impartiall Readers, as most vseful, & fit for these present times.
And as therefore in my former Bookes, I haue chosen Patrons Ho∣nourable and beneficiall, by whose authority, fauour, and countenance they might more happily be published, so I could finde none more worthy the dedication of this Royall and true Hi∣story, then your Honours, whom I know, aboue all persons, to tender most the blessed memory of this matchlesse Queene, who in her life time so much

honoured and affected you, or your Noble Ancestors and illustrious Prede∣cessours, that they (for their deserts and vertues) were by her Maiestie graced with the most honourable Dignities, and highest places of Honour in this Kingdome: And also, because your Honours bee addicted to History, fa∣uourable to humane arts, religiously deuoted, & piously affected. VVhere∣fore I, in most submissiue manner, re∣quest your Honours to accept this wor∣thy Oblation, with a mild aspect, cheer∣full countenance, and vsuall Clemency, from him who vnfainedly wishes to all your Honors in generall, and to each of them in particular, perfection of ioy and happines, as,
