TO HIS TRULY HONOURED AND MUCH VALUED COUSIN Edward Corker als Cor Cor, Esq; The Authour wisheth Grace, Mercy, and Peace.
THE death of Friends (who were loving and a∣miable in their Lives, and Encouragers of Ver∣tue) is very piercing and grievous; but most of all pensive and afflictive, when they are taken away (as your dear Brother, and my truly loving Kinsman was,) by a sudden surreption, without a foregoing Visitation and Sickness: which severe and startling Providence made a very great breach in his Family and Neighbourhood, and a deep impression upon my Thoughts.
But the Great and Wise God, in whose Hands our Lives are, hath a Sovereign Right to dispose of, and put a period to them, when and in what manner his Infi∣nite Wisdom seeth meet; without being accountable to his Creatures for his Actions. Our Duty is humbly to submit to his Holy Will, and with good Old Eli to say, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.
When Your Affectionate Brother had paid that Debt which We yet owe to God and Nature; His mournful Relict desired that I would perform the last Ministerial Office for him at his Interment. I had not power to
deny her Request, altho at the same time I was sensible he deserved a better Orator to commemorate his Vertues.
The Discourse I then made, and here present to You Revis'd and Enlarg'd, is plain, not cloathed with pomp of Words, and tunable Expressions, which in Sermons and Books of Divinity, are like Paint laid upon Pearls, which shine best in their native lustre. Flourishes of Wit and fine Phrases, may tickle Mens Ears, and please their Fancies, but rarely convince them of the important necessity of preparing for Death and Judgment: or pre∣vail with them to live holily, that they may die happily.
The Text it self is very momentous, and the subject matter of the Comment is salubrious, and may claim at∣tention and regard from all Orders and Degrees of Men, who by the eternal and unchangeable Decree of God must once die and appear in Judgment: But if it meet with unkind entertainment from some persons of corrupt Principles and profligate Lives, who atheistically droll upon and ridicule every thing that is serious; yet it may be beneficial to others, who are really solicitous to know what they must do to obtain Salvation, and to inherit Eternal Glory.
That the God of Mercy and Consolation would sancti∣fie and sweeten to you this sharp and afflictive Provi∣dence: that he would work in your Soul a cheerful re∣signation to his Holy Will, and enrich you with all the Blessings of Heaven and Earth, is the dayly fervent Prayer of
