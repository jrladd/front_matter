Right Honorable, and Worshipfull:
TO give a publike account of the reasons moving mee to make a private dedication of these Meditations to your Compa∣ny, may be expected by some: But it sufficeth me, and I hope will content others that I acknowledge a loving
relation to your Company, which un∣to me is a strong obligation for a due and thankfull respect to you all. I must confesse, some of you in your parti∣culars have deserved of mee more then ordinary, but your Company in general above all the Societies of this City, though divers others well, to God be the glory for it. Accept then I pray you this oblation of grati∣tude from him who is and will be whiles God shall grant life, for the welfare and everlasting happinesse of you all.

From my study  this sixteenth ofFebruary 1639.
