THe holy Apostle S. Iohn saith, hee had no greater ioyIohn. 3. 4, than this, to heare that his sonnes did walke in the truth. The same affection all the true Ministers of Christ haue in some measure towards all the sonnes and daughters of God: specially such as they haue gai∣ned, or God by them hath brought to the faith of Christ. I am well assured you remember Master GREENHAMS great care and loue towards you, which was vnfained, because of the good experience hee had of your vnfained faith in Christ, and loue towards him. If hee had longer liued hee would haue reioyced yet much more to see your loue so increase in knowledge, and the testimonies of your loue in the fruite of righteousnesse, and in your godly perseue∣rance in the truth. Now receiue his workes, and what you long ex∣pected and desired to see. This Catechisme I haue sent you, that you may teach it your children, as Eunice & Lois did their children. These letters serue wel for your own vse, that you may heare them alwaies speake in his absence from you, whom you so reioyced to heare, be∣ing present with you: and that you may haue his owne very words written and set before your eyes, which you haue heard often to your great ioy sounding in your eares, that so in the end, you may be able by your good experience to comfort others, with the same comforts, wherewith yee are and haue beene by him comforted of God. For the faithfull are exercised of God diuerslie: some by out∣ward,

some by inward afflictions of minde: and some haue both troubles without, and terrours within. Such as bee not acquainted with the troubles of mind, whatsoeuer gift they haue, can bring but cold cōfort in time of need, to poore soules afflicted, as it is very ma∣nifest, both by Scripture & our common experience. Now the God of peace sanctifie you, both in spirit, soule, and bodie, and keepe you with all yours blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ.
Amen.
