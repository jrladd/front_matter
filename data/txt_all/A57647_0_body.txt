SIR.
WHen I consider your proficiency in the Schoole of Wisdome, your daily exercises in the Tem∣ple of Vertue, for which you may in time de∣serve a Shrine in the Temple of Honor; your hearty affection to true and solid Philosophy; not that which the Apostle calls Vain and deceiving; and lastly, your sincere love to me, I thought good not in way of retalia∣tion, but of a thankfull recognition of your favours, to present this piece to you, wherein you may perceive how many strange wonders and secrets are couched up within the Microcosme of our body; and with what ad∣mirable artifice the base and infirm materials of this our earthly Tabernacle are united and composed.
Likewise you may see how much the Dictates and O∣pinions of the ancient Champions of Learning, are sleighted and misconstrued by some modern Innovators; whereas we are but children in understanding, and ought to be directed by those Fathers of Knowledge; we are but Dwarfs and Pigmies compared to those Gi∣ants of Wisdom on whose shoulders we stand, yet we can∣not see so far as they without them: I deny not but we may and ought to strive for further knowledge, which we shall hardly reach without their supportation. I dis∣swade no man from inventing new; but I ould not have him therefore to forget the old, nor to lose the substance whilst he catches the shadow. Women and Children love new wine, because pleasant to the palat; but wise men chuse the old, because wholsomer for the stomach. As I abridge no man of his liberty to invent new wayes; so I hope they will not debar me of the like liberty to keep the old paths, so long as I find hem more easie and compendious for attaining the end of my jour∣ney. Sir, I will not trouble you with any larger Dis∣course on this subject. I wish an accumulation of all vertue and happinesse on you, and withall the continua∣tion of your love to him who professeth himself
