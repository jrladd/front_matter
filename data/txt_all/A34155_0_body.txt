WHen the Lord did first engage our hearts to wait upon him ac∣cording to the ensuing Relation, it was much upon some of our spirits, that we should see the glory of God, though we could not apprehend the manner of his appearance; much less could we in the least suppose his answer would be as after was manifest. But the onely-wise God, who knoweth how to order all things for his glory, can make the wrath of man praise him, and the remainder thereof restain: upon which account, the ensu∣ing Relation being thought necessary to be published, is presented to your pe∣rusal; hoping, that as experience of his goodness hath been some refreshment unto us, (who have subscribed the same, being all of us personally present, some at the one part, others at the other part of the transactions therein men∣tioned, and sufferers in some degree or other in the same) it will administer some refreshment unto you also; that we may be thereby united with on heart in one common Cause, though contemned, despised, and reproached, by those who did formerly walk with us hand in hand therein, from which they have so openly Apostatized; and also, what you and we must expect from them, unless the Lord should leave us to betray him with a kiss, as they have done: But we trust, that relying upon his grace, he will keep us by his migh∣ty power through faith unto the day of salvation, when we shall with rejoy∣cing say, Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him: we will be glad and re∣joyce in his salvation.
