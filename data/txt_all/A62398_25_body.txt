SIr, these Lynes unto your hands I send,
Wishing your Worship will but them commend,
And begs that you'l not be a gast,
For nominating, some first that should be last;
Therefore, good Sir, I hope ye will pardon give,
And oblidge your humble Servant while he lives;
This I lay open to your Worships view,
And Simon Elliot of Tarras, I dedicat to you,
For Summer-fruit it is pleasant to eat,
But Winter fruit it will a long time keep;
Although the Hills of Tarras they be black,
Yet in his Golden-fleece there is no lack,

Black moisty Fleeces when they are well scour'd,
Unto the owners yeeld good, clear, and currant gold;
Pure Spanisb gold it's very fine,
But of Wool our Merchants makes more gain,
Through Christendom your Woolly Fleeces,
Are still compar'd to golden pieces,
So he that is a Shepherd Swain,
Can be no less than a Gentleman:
Monarchs and Kings, Royal Majesty,
Were Shepherds Swains in Arcadie.
