Honoured Sir,
THe many favours that I have of late received from you, has very much induced me for to present my few Observations unto your knowing view. I must confess they are not worthy Your seriâˆ£ous speculation, being but a little Drollery of some sorts of people at your Lottery: In a word Sir, if you please for once to Patronize this little piece, if e're a better bud spring up to my hand, the whole Stock is yours, Root and Branch, in the interim I take leave to remain,
