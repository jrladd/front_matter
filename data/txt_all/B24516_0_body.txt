Honor'd Sir,
ALthough the Piece I now present you, as it is in its self, and as it may relate to you, be but a weak and worthless Work: ; not at all worthy your view, even in
 the least: yet, quale quale est, since at the earnest request of some, that are well-wish∣ers to the publike, I am somewhat encouraged to be (though unwillingly) wil∣ling therewith to trouble the Press a little; Let me a little press you to the trouble, so far (I beseech you) as to accept of its Patronage; which, that you may the less unwillingly accept of, I can assure you, no St. Peters Bonds abide is here, that is,
 nothing that tends, either to Schism in Church, or Sedi∣tion in State.
VVere it (I confess) such an one as Aelian's Tacticks, a Discourse of ordering and embattelling an Army, of ranking of Soldiers, a some∣thing de Arte Militaria, or so, perchance it might a lit∣tle please you (Sir) my spe∣cial, good, and onely true Friend, as being in some small measure Opus par Pa∣trono: But being onely cer∣tain
 DIALOGUES of or∣dering the Alphabet, of rank∣ing of Syllables, a something de Arte Lieraria, and the like; I presume it will profit your Grand-childe, my to∣wardly Scholar; he being (had this been directed to him) altogether Patronus par operi. And in very deed for his sake, (a something to shew my thankfulness, for the many undeserv'd favors received from you, and by your means from others,)
 was it first thought on: for his sake, (to use Homers ex∣pression, ) first, though crassa Minerva rude∣ly (as we say) penn'd, and now at last publish't.
But whatsoever it be, such as it is, thus penn'd, thus publish'd, your protection is humbly pray'd, at leastwise your courteous Acceptance thereof: for although Chry∣sippus his  holds not good here; this being (as I have already confes∣sed)
 none of the best, and therefore not at all praise-worthy: yet since there is in it something that may benefit your Sonne and other young Scholars; yea Apprentices, and some others also; provided they be not altogether , your courteous Acceptance (in my esteem, hujus, quic∣quid est scriptiunculae, Genius) will put a value on, and plena manu (as we say) sufficiently crown both it, and me its
 Author; who am exceed∣ingly glad of this opportuni∣ty, to witness to you, yea, and to our English-world too, (so far as I am able) how deeply I am
(SIR,)
