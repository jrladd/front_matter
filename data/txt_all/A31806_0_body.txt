SIR,
THough I could not easily perswade
my self to expose this following Ser∣mon
to publick view, yet after I was once
resolved to venture it abroad, I was soon
determined to whom I ought to present
it. To your Interest and Favour I chief∣ly
owe my being placed in this Parish, to
your Countenance my greatest Encou∣ragement
here, and if it may gain your
Acceptance and Approbation, I shall but
little value the uncertain Judgment of o∣thers.

Upon how many this plain homely
Discourse may have good effect, I cannot
ghess; how many it will anger and dis∣please
I am not at all concerned: and tho
I may be thought by some ill advis'd in
publishing such a Sermon, yet every one
will commend and justifie my Discretion
in prefixing your Name before it: for so
great an awe have the Enemies of our
Church and Government of your Loyal∣ty
and Fidelity to both, of your undaunt∣ed
Zeal and Activity for the Service of
both, that they will not dare loudly to
condemn what you are pleased to protect.
They will be justly afraid of quarrelling
with me, when they know I have engaged
you on my side.
I am very sensible, that in this Age we
live some are so extraordinarily wise and
wary, as to censure and discourage all
Men that speak roundly and act vigorous∣ly
for the King and Church, as being

more forward and busie than is needful:
but I am also as sensible, that if some Men
had not shewn more Courage and Hone∣sty
than those prudent Persons, both
would have been by this time in far great∣er
danger, than at this present, Thanks be
to God, they are.
For my own part, no one is more fa∣vourable
to a truly tender Conscience than
my self, let it be as nice and scrupulous
as it can well be, so it be about the sub∣stantial
matters of Piety towards God, Ju∣stice
between Man and Man, due Obe∣dience
to Superiours, and when it makes
us more exactly careful of our undoubt∣ed
Duty in all Instances: But, when Men
are scrupulous only on one side, about
things commanded by lawful Authority,
and make no Scruple of Disobedience,
Schism, Faction, and Division; when Men
set up their private Humour, Fancy, or
Opinion, in opposition to established Laws,

when they become peevish, pragmatical,
and ungovernable; nay, when Mens Con∣sciences
prove so generally tender and scru∣pulous,
as to doubt of and suspect the
Rights of the Crown, (for that Consci∣ence
that is so tender against the Church
is also usually as tender against the King)
such wayward skittish Consciences ought
to be well bridled and restrained, or else
they will be not only intolerably trouble∣some,
but extreamly mischievous both to
Church and State.
That the Blessed Rewards of Vertue
and Loyalty may plentifully descend up∣on
your Self, and all that belong to you,
both in this Life and that which is to come,
is the earnest Prayer of
Honoured Sir,
