TAm Marti quam Mercurio,
was the just Atchiev∣ment
of the great Sir Philip Sid∣ney,
and he that would imitate
Plutarch in the parallel of his
Worthies, must to Sir Philip
Howard award not only an e∣qual,
but a rank as far superi∣or,
as this latter Age excels the
former. The felicity of your
Genius has obtained an Experi∣ence
so large in the faculties of
the Learned, that even in ours

you are received a Judge, as
Impartial as Knowing; may I
then presume to commit this
Treatise, though small, yet
great in Importance, to your
Patronage and Suffrage, which
is the submissive Petition of,
Honourable Sir,
