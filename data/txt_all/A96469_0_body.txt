The matter doth deserve your protection, being Iustice inviolated, like Virgo, placed in the Zodiack betweene those two signes of Leo and Libra, those two supporters of cou∣rage and Equity: The publication hath taken wing, being borne up with other mens de∣sires, The Author doth lie prostrate before you, Let thy Servant be a Servant1 Sam. 25. 41.
