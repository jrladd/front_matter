GENTLEMEN,
I Have often wonder'd, That we, who are profess'd Lovers of this Liquor, should not have among us one Generous Son of Apollo that dare draw his Pen in the defence of our Cause; I am sure the universal Contagion of Dulness has not so overspread us, but we have Poetick Forces enough to an∣swer any of our Opposers; yet were it otherwise, that a Bar∣renness of Fancy had possess'd us, the Subject it self would (like the Ovidian Deo Agitante) point us out the Road to Parnassus.
Of Darby-Ale I own I'm a passionate Admirer, and no fond Amorist was ever more captivated with the Charms of his Mistress, than I with the Charms of its Brightness: Where there is Love, there is Admiration; and where Admiration, Respect: and from hence proceeds my Regret to have Odi∣ums cast upon the Object of my Wishes: when the sawcy I Lam∣poon, called, Sot's Paradice, at every Bookseller's star'd me in the face; I've been possess'd with Fury almost to Distra∣ction; a long time I have fed my self with hopes of Revenge, that some new Champion would enter the Lists and foil the Pigmie Satyrist: Hitherto I have found my Expectation balk'd; but rather than our Divertive Clubbs, and Inspiring Liquor should suffer the stains and aspersions they now lie under, I chose to undertake the Combat my self, in hopes to put a stop to the growing Tyranny of Re-printing Sot's Paradice. This is the sole Reason that I have attempted An Encomium; and if my Poem has diminish'd the intrinsick Worth and Delight that our Liquor deserves, impute it rather to my unskilfulness in Fancy and Numbers, than the weakness of the Cause.
Gallant Souls are prov'd by their actions, and those actions are more conspicuous and noble which proceed purely from Loy∣alty and Resolution: I have serv'd several Campaigns under Darby-Ale, with success, and it would be very ungenerous (in this time of danger) to desert my Standard; had it no

secret Spell to engage me in its Service, I should not (like Mr. W—d) basely turn Traytor and Runagado from that which had done me such eminent Service; for, let him pur∣sue its Ruin with the utmost rack of Thought and Invention, and pretend what aversion he pleases, he ow's his Trip to Ja∣maica, and some other of his best Compositions, to its Assi∣stance.
Now, Gentlemen, since we have Enemies (and those too so potent) I hope you will not leave me to stand the shock of their Rage. I shall know your intentions by your favourable acceptance of this Piece; but, be it how it will (as Epa∣minondas said to his Buckler, so say I to my Liquor) Me De∣fendas, & Ego te Defendam, I have no more to add, but hope when this comes to your Hands, you will drink the Health of
