WOrthie Sir, me thought I obserued in you a Saintlike adoration of vertue, not to her Image, but to her substance: your actions crownes your worthy in∣tentions, and speakes you more then Gentleman like formalitie: the eager appetite of her beau∣tie makes me present her to you vnmaskt, and vnpainted with adulterate complexion: your incouragements are massie, and this labour Geometrically proportioned to your person. Your onely character is to be ingenious and generous: I haue prooued it, you may hap finde your nati∣uitie calculated vnder some of these Planets: when their influence shall in some of them answer to your acute con∣ceite, I stand bound to you, that haue so nobly espoused

this labour for your bedfellow, as Alexander kept Ho∣mers Iliades▪ vnder his pillow: this quintessence extracte from the Phylosophicall body of art without quacke saluing poetrie: may perhaps teach you more then Paracelsian skill in the spirits of vertue: and make you more then a bare professor of Alcumie, rich and wealthie in the practise of her: you know her grounds are infallible: seeke her therefore in these Satyrs, and proue rich in her Elixar.
