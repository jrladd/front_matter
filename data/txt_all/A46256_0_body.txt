This is an Age my Lord, that will try whe∣ther you have Fortitude enough to be faithful, Courage enough to be Honest, and Judgment sufficient to avoid extremities. In your Time Sir,

All Free of the Drapers Company. there have been more sudden turns and numerous changes than your fore-Fathers have experienced in the Three Genera∣tions of your Family that have successively passed before you Members of the Company, which is a pregnant Lecture for your understanding, and exercitation for your judgment, wherein your wary observations may collect ready Rules for your Reason to work upon, and so guide you in this Years Government, that it may render you precious to all poste∣rity; answerable to the devout desires and daily Obsecrations of
My Lord,
