My most honoured LORD,
WHen the Age declineth from her primitive ver∣tue, and the Silken wits of the Time, (that I may borrow from our acknowledg'd Master, learned JOHNSON) disgracing Nature, and harmonious Poesie, are transported with many illiterate and prodigious births, it is not safe to appear with∣out protection. Among all the names of Honour, this Come∣dy oweth most gratitude to your Lordship, whose clear testi∣mony to me was above a Theater, and I applaud the dexterity of my Fate, that hath so well prepared a Dedication, whither my only ambition would direct it. I am not pale, to think it is now expos'd to your deliberate censure; for 'tis my security, that I have studied your Lordships Candor, and know you imi∣tate the Divine nature which is mercifull above offence. Go on great Lord, and be the volume of our English honour, in whom while others, invited by their birth, and quickned with ambitious emulation, read and study their principles, let me be made happy enough to admire, and devote my self,
