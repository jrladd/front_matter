My Lord,
IN addressing to Your Lord∣ship,
tho I betray my Am∣bition,
I shall strengthen the

opinion of my Integrity. For
by appealing to so great, and so
impartial a Judge, I give the
World sufficient demonstration,
that I trust more to the Merit of
my Cause, than of my Perfor∣mance,
and depend rather upon
the matter, than the manner of
what I deliver, for my Justifica∣tion.
The Tyde of Prejudice runs
high for my Adversary, and the less
discerning part of the Town are
so prepossess'd with the Specious
Title, and the Plausible Pretence
of Mr Collier's Book, that they
think the whole Interest of Vir∣tue
and Religion embark'd on
that Bottom. Immorality and
Prophaness are things so justly
abhorrd, that whoever enters
the Lists against 'em, has all Good
Men for his Seconds. And their

zeal for the Cause so far
blinds many of 'em, that
they neither see, nor suspect any
Defect or Treachery in their
Champion. For men are very
unwilling to hear Truth, against
Prejudice, and suffer Reason to
triumph over Inclination.
The Town is divided in its
Judgment of the Piece, and the
whole Contest lies betwixt those
that are Judges, and those that
are not, as Cardinal Richlieu said
upon another occasion. The
latter are of the Opposite Facti∣on,
and are as much more nu∣merous
than the former; as Va∣nity
and Presumption are more
Universal, than Understanding.
This makes the Prefixing your
Lordships name, by your own
Permission, whose Judgment is
as little to be byass'd, as 'tis to

be question'd, not only matter
of Honour to me, but of neces∣sary
Defence. Not that I ex∣pect
any Protection for those
Errors which I may have com∣mitted.
They must be left to
the mercy of Readers of far less
Judgment and Candour, than
Your Honour. To be tried by
such a Grand Jury, is a happi∣ness
I am so far from expecting,
that I know it impossible. But
the Deference due to so great a
Name may procure me a fair
hearing amongst some, upon
whom a bare regard to Justice
wou'd hardly prevail so far.
Did Mr Collier contend only
for the better Establishment of
Virtue, and Reformation of
Manners, I shou'd be asham'd to
appear against him. But there is
a Snake in the Grass. Mr Collier

undertakes the Patronage of Vir∣tue,
as Cunning Men do the
Guardianship of rich Orphans,
only to make his Markets of it.
That this is his case, the follow∣ing
Sheets will, I hope, sufficient∣ly
demonstrate. His Vehemence
gives us just ground to suspect
his Integrity, and to believe that
he has some conceal'd Interest,
or Pique at the bottom. The dis∣interested
enquiry after Truth is
always accompany'd with Can∣dour;
where that is wanting,
there is just reason to suspect some
further design. In Mr Collier's
management, the Heat and
Smoke are too great and appa∣rent
for the Fire to be long con∣ceal'd.
His Design is manifestly
not to argue the Poets out of
their Faults, but to bully his
Readers out of their Under∣standings,

and by violence to al∣ter
the Impressions already re∣ceiv'd
of those matters▪ which
he treats of. His Style is adapt∣ed
to his purpose, fierce and
bold, full of vehement exagge∣rations,
and haughty menaces,
he racks Sentences, and tortures
Expressions, to extort a Confes∣sion
from 'em of things to which
they are absolute Strangers. The
consequence of this way of wri∣ting
is, that Women, and Weak
Men, whose Fears are stronger
than their Judgments, will be
aw'd into a Perswasion before
they are convinc'd of the Truth
of it. For such People in most
cases measure the certainty of
Assertions by the Confidence of
him that pronounces 'em, and
the Importance by the false
weight that is laid upon 'em.

'Twas this consideration, not
any extraordinary Affection for
the Stage, that engag'd me in
this Argument. I look upon it
as an attempt towards usurping
the Soveraignty of Men's Un∣derstandings,
and restoring the
Tyranny of Bigottry, whose
Yoak we have scarce yet suffici∣ently
shaken off. My Reason is
the dearest, and freest part of
me, or at least it ought to be so,
and he that puts the Dice upon
that, affronts me in the most
sensible manner. I had rather be
bubbled of my Money than my
Intellects, and shou'd chuse rather
to be thought his Cully, than
his Fool. 'Tis true, these tricks
are not to be put upon a man
that is aware of 'em, and conse∣quently
I might have secur'd my
self without making a publick

discovery. But I think it a Cow∣ardly
piece of Caution, a sort
of Criminal Misprision to con∣nive
at the cheating of others;
and while I am able to inform
'em, the Clamour of Knaves or
Fools shall never awe me to
Silence.
That this is no extravagant
Surmise, no Hypochondriacal
Fancy, is evident from the Te∣nour
of the whole Book, espe∣cially
the third Chapter. Every
thing is deliver'd with an air so
haughty, so magisterial, so de∣cisive,
that he seems rather to
serve us with an Injunction to
believe him, than an Argument.
That this Imposition may be the
more tamely submitted to, he
palms the Authority of the
Church upon us, and pretends
her Commission to make Fools
of the Laity.

The Church is by no means
oblig'd to him, for endeavour∣ing
to cast the Odium of his own
Arrogance and Ambition upon
her. How great soever his Zeal
for her service may be, his In∣discretion
in it does not come a
whit behind it. For to extend
the Power and Authority of the
Priest, he curtails the Articles of
the Church, and denies the
King's Supremacy, which she has
already oblig'd him to swear to
the belief of.
I shall not trespass so far upon
Your Honour's patience, as to
recapitulate the several Invidious
things, which he fathers upon
the Church. I will hope well of
his Design, tho I fear the effects
of his Performance will not turn
to her Service. And I cou'd
wish his Motives were better,

or not so apparent. If Demetri∣us
was a Stickler for the honour
of Diana, 'twas because he made
Shrines for her, the interest of
his trade engag'd him in her
Party. Mr Collier's Case is not
much different. The Poets had
sometimes made bold to display
a vicious, or a foolish Priest, and
those that were Knaves in the
World, and Drolls in the Pul∣pit,
had been made Cheats and
Buffoons upon the Stage. The
Mask of Formality and Sanctity
was pull'd off, and the Block-head
and the Hypocrite shewn
bare-fac'd. Thus the Profane
Vulgar were suffer'd to peep,
and pry into Mysteries. This
Mr Collier resents as if he were
personally concern'd, and wou'd
perswade the world, that to ex∣pose
Hypocrisie is to affront the

Church, than which her Enemies
cou'd not have suggested any
thing more malicious. How∣ever,
this mistaken Injury has
rais'd a Flame, which will cost
the effusion of abundance of Ink
before it is extinguish'd. Manet
alta Mente repostum, and is never
to be forgiven while Mr Collier
can wag a Goose-quill.
Our Clergy deservedly have
both at home and abroad the re∣putation
of the most learned
Clergy in the World, and I shall
venture to affirm, that they are
the Best in the World. Their
Candour towards those that dif∣fer
from 'em in Opinion, their
Modesty in asserting their own,
and their sober Conduct in the
discharge of their own Consci∣ences,
and not assuming the do∣minion
of those of other men,

will prove what I say to
to be no Paradox. And there∣fore
Mr Collier, in making so
large a demand in their names,
has obliquely traduc'd 'em, by
giving occasion to those that
don't sufficiently know 'em, to
suspect that he acts by their Ap∣probation
and Authority.
But I forget, that while I talk
to Your Lordship, I wrong the
Publick, which claims so great a
share in your thoughts and time.
I shall not attempt the Character
of Your Lordship: For, to write
of you, as I ought, to do you
Justice, I must write like you,
which I hope I shall never have
the vanity to pretend to. But
the Name of My Lord Dorset a∣lone
carries more Panegyrick
than the fruitfullest Invention
can furnish. Those Adventurous

Gentlemen, that have already
tried their Strength at it, have
by their foils taught me caution.
Their Performances fall so ex∣treamly
short of the Merit of
their Subject, that when they
have exhausted their Fancies,
their whole stock of Rhetorick
looks like an Ostentation of Beg∣gery.
This consideration alone
is sufficient to deter me from
presuming further upon Your
Lordship's Goodness, except to
ask Pardon for my Ambition of
taking this Publick Occasion to
declare with what profound Re∣spect
I am
My Lord,
