SIR,
HAving often tyred you with Discourses of
several Parts of Musick, wherein you desi∣red
to receive satisfaction, without obtain∣ing
the Effect I proposed to my self; I re∣flected
upon the saying, That no man understands that
which he cannot so express as to make another under∣stand
it, and doubted whether the Hypothesis I enter∣tained
were not founded upon Errours, which I had
swallowed without any due examination. I resolved
for tryal of it, to trace my Notions as near their Prin∣ciples
as I could, and set them down in method, that I
might discover whether they were well deduced from one
another, and from such Experiments as I had in memo∣ry.
Having done this I send them to you, as the se∣verest
judge I know: It has not been your custome to
flatter me, and now I desire your censure, if I may im∣pose
it upon you to give it in writing, wherein you will
be obliged to quote what I say truly, before you object to
it, and to stand to those Allegations and Inferences you
will set down for your own, in both which respects I
had great disadvantage in Discourse. I shall prevent
you in condemning the stile, for being too contracted and
obscure; and you must take the fault to your self when
you know it does not proceed from the aversion I have
to Philologie, but that I thought it would be labour lost
to enlarge, when writing to so great a Philosopher and
Musician as you are, I cannot fail of being understood.

In other things I expose it to you; and if I shall receive
plain Confutations, it will not much disappoint or mor∣tifie
me: for I have hardly in my whole Life made one
set experiment upon this Subject, nor know many of
the Instruments I have spoken of: But what I heard
from others, or occasionally observed, I laid up in mind,
and established this Systeme, which I shall be glad to
lose, if I may improve my Knowledge by your Disco∣veries.
This may seem strange to you, considering how
fond men are of their own Inventions: At the worst, I
hope for this fruit of my pains, that you will make such
Experiments as your Curiosity will suggest whilst you
read this, and let me know the success of them; though
I may thereby be driven out of his Hypothesis, perhaps
I shall receive light towards another, which you may be∣lieve
I shall take as much pleasure in making, as you,
or any body else can to destroy.
I am, SIR,
Your most Faithfull Friend
and Servant.
