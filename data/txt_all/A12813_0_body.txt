Honorable Sr,
I Doubt it is my Fortune, to hazard calumny, in the im∣ployment of my inuention in your seruice, and not the thing, but the person incurs it, whose minority admits cen∣sure before tryall; therefore I beseech your Ho∣nor seriously to superuise this slight labour, scarce meriting your attention; and the content you want in this, let it be but added to the pleasure (I hope) your Honor will conceiue at view of those reall Tryumphs (scarce admitting a se∣cond) which your liberall Society haue so nobly
 bestowed on you and then I doubt not but to at∣tempt that credite, which many will Enuy. Thus wishing that the Tryumphs of Peace may for euer attend you, I remaine,
