IN obedience to your Lord∣ships Order of May 13. 1665. We the Pre∣sident and Colledge of Physicians of London, His Majesties most Dutiful and Loyal Sub∣jects, have diligently met together, and seriously perused our former Books of Advice and Directions for the Cure of the Plague, and preventing the Infecti∣on; and have made such Additions and Alterations, as we judged most requisite
for the present times and occasions: wherein we have been tender of omit∣ing many Forms and Prescripts, which by reason of the plainness and homeli∣ness of them, we looked upon as very obnoxious to be censured and vilified, especially by Persons pretending to rare Preparations and Secrets; We consider∣ing that our Predecessors, (amongst whom were then the most eminent Phy∣sicians in England, and such as had expe∣rience of Plagues in their times, raging to a far greater height than through Gods mercy any hath done since) might see just cause, upon their experience and success to bring them in. We have omitted onely such particulars, as clearly appeared unto us su∣perfluous; being either provided for by Laws or Orders of the higher Powers, or unpracticable, or abundantly and to bet∣ter advantage supplyed by others in the same kind here published. We have added such Remedies, as either upon our own Experience, or upon the testimony of
Authors of the best Credit, and most versed in the Cure of the Plague, have proved successful, and such as might be easiest understood, procured and prepa∣red, most of them at little charge, for the Poor.
This is what we could do for the time, to answer the present occasion, as we understood it, and as our Predeces∣sours had done: Humbly beseeching your Lordships, that we may not be measu∣red thereby, as if it were all wherein we are capable to serve His Majesty upon this accompt, in Order to the Lives and Healths of His Subjects: for we are upon, and do farther design and in∣tend more accurate and elaborate Pre∣parations and Compositions, aswel Chy∣mical as others (to which there may need, and shall not be wanting our per∣sonal inspection and care, as the case shall require) for preservation from, and cure of this Plague, if it shall please GOD to suffer it to increase
amongst us, and more appropriate, ac∣cording as we shall farther discover the peculiar Nature and Condition of the Malignitie: And not onely in relation to that, but other Diseases of greatest Difficulty and Danger. This is the ac∣compt we have at present most hum∣bly to present unto your Lordships.
Dated at our Colledge-house London, the 25th. day of May 1665.
