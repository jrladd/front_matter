Your Muses, th'one a Youth, and one an Infant,
Gaue me two Panegericks at one Instant:
The first Pen, the first line it pleas'd to walke in,
Did make myThis Gentleman was pleased Anagrammatically to call me
Water Rat, or water Art, which I doe Anagrammatiae Waterâˆ£rat,
to bee A true Art.Art a Rat, and like Grimalkin,
Or a kinde needfull Vermin-coursing Cat.
By Art I play, but will not care your Rat.
I thanke you that you did so soone determine,
To Anagram my Art into a Vermine,
For which I vow, if e're you keeps a Dayrie,
Of (now and then) a Cheese I will impaire yee.
Kinde Mr. George, your Muse must be exalted,
My Poetry you very well haue salted.
Salt keeps things sweet, & makes them rellish sau'ry,
And you haue powdred well my honest na .
I thanke you to, nor will I be ingratefull,
Whilest Rime or Reason deignes to fill my pare full
You truly say that I loue Whores and Thieues well,
And half your speech I think the world belieus wel.
For should I hate a Thiefe, Thieues are so commos,
I well could neither loue my selfe or no man;
But for Whores loue, my purse would neuer hold o.
They'l Cheat and picke the Siluer and the Gold o.
You both haue grac'd my Thiefe, he hath confessed,
You (like two Shrieues) conuay'd him to be Prised
In mirth you write to me, on small Requesting,
For which I thanke you both, in harmlesse Iesting,
And may your Studies to such goodnesse raise you,
That God may euer loue, and good men praise you.

Yours, when you will, where you will
in what you will, as you will with
your will, against your will;
at this time, at any time, at all time or
sometimes, in pastimes.
