ACcording to Your Honours command wee have enquired and considered how the Mines-Royall were left to Master Bushell by the Lady Middleton, and doe in all humility declare, that the silver mines were not worth the working, untill Master Bushell at his great charge discovered Rich Ore in the adjacent mountaines, which in all likeli∣hood will both increase the Bullion & by his way of working, in short time give his Majesty a true tryall what the invaluable riches of these His Welsh moun∣taines are: for whereas the Mines in these parts were formerly wrought by Pumpes, and so grow∣ing deepe were left drowned with water, M. Bushell cuts through the maine Rockes, at the lowest levell, to an hundred fathome perpendicular, according to the German manner of working, which though chargeable, yet certaine, having foure severall Ad∣dits which hee continueth driving day and night into foure severall mountaines, his industry also hath

outstript former times, for by melting the poore fusible Ore, with the Rich, he produceth a third part more of silver with the same charge: and for accommodating the workes with all materials fit for Mines Royall, he hath spared no cost about repairing the milles, hath also built in his Majesties Castle of Aberystwith a faire mint, hath contracted with mer∣chants of our owne and other Nations to supply the peoples necessity with Corne and other provisions, and payeth the miners and carriers at the Scales, and doubteth not to make them able Pyoners, and fit souldiers to doe His Majesty and their Country ser∣vice upon any assault of an enemy. All which we commend to Your Honourable consideration, pray∣ing, &c.
