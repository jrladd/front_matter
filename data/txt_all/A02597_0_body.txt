MAgnanimous Lords with duetifull respects
This Pilgrims PoÃ«me, FRANCK to you directs,
Wishing your Lordships daigne to patronize it,
What FRANCK affoords, let favour infranchize it.
My loyall love (though I bee much destressed)
From praising Vertue should not bee suppressed,
And how much more in Kings its eminent,
So much the more to praise it should bee bent,
Each generous genius. Since (conjectures past)
True tacticke practicke teacheth vs at last,
That IAMES the Iust hath both begunne and ended,
In mercie, peace, and grace now much commended,
And since so oft installed on a Throne,
His happie Head was honoured with a Crowne,
Till that nor Crownes, nor Kingdomes to him given
Could keepe his Soule on Earth now crownd in Heaven,
Who having left of his owne royall race
A royall, loyall Prince to fill his place.
(And having him in Christian Schooles vptrained,
Till hee true vertue, and Religion gained,
So that in tender age hee did surmount
All Christian Princes in the best account)
In Peace and true Religion hath layd downe,
Three Swords, three Scepters, and a triple Crowne.
Shall hee so much was praised whilst hee lived
For vertue loved; and who so much was grieved
At vyces of this age, now beeing gone,
Bequeath his vertues to oblivion?
No; since both rich and poore so well were pleased,
His memorie must needs bee eternized.
My Muse must praise such vertues as did dwell
Within his Soule, (which made him so excell)
Which wee must imitate, and alwayes strive
Wisely to vse our Talents (whilst wee live)
By his example, who defunct, doth rest
In Heaven with him, in whom he put his trust.
The vertues of the living, men should praise,
That more and more wee may true vertue raise:
Till like the graine of mustard-seed it grow,
And all the World aboundantly ore-flow:
True vertues praise I heartlie doe intend,
Till that my breath, and mortall life shall end:
And so much more to praise it shall bee bent,
As I doe finde it true and eminent.
