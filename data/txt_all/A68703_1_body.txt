SO many men presse now for place in State,
Deseart and Worth cannot come neere the gate:
ut happy were it for the State and Vs,
f we (as Rome did) sought for Curius.
here should we finde him, farre from Court, with you
erhaps a Gardiner, or perhaps at Plow.
et euen the same which Pyrrhus did withstand,
amnites, and Sabines ruld, as you Ireland.
hen should our Kings cleare Iustice shine too brigh
o suffer potent wrong, cloude impotent right.
hen should this act of Iustice so aboue
ll presidents, make others like it mooe.
But wretched we, whilst few the doore can passe
Of high preerment, but the Lden Asse.
