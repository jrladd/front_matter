WHen the Parliament, out of their love to Christ, and re∣spect to the Reverend Bi∣shops his Servants, humbly moved his Majesty for some augmentation to be made to the means of divers of them; and had omitted the Bishop of Ossory out of their List, as a man that
 either needed it not, or cared not for it, seeing he never moved any man, as some others did, to seek for any augmentation for him: Your Grace was the only Advocate to put his Majesty in mind of the Bishop of Ossory, and to add four hundred pounds per annum for his augmentation, to the perpetual Obligation of the present and succeeding Bishops of that See, to your Grace, and to all your succeeding Family.
But what your Grace hath then so graciously begun, I humbly beg your Grace would be pleased, as graciously now to finish and perfect that pious work which you have so religiously begun; not so much in regard of my self, who, (after I was cast down to the dust, and there lay wallowing a long while, and was at last, beyond my desert, and any certainty of expectation, lifted up again to mine Office, and restored to mine Honour and Dig∣nity) have vowed and resolved to spend what God hath restored to me, for the Honour of God, and the service of the Church of Christ, that is, besides my necessities, to repair his Church, to re∣lieve
 the distressed, to punish perjurers and such high Malefactors,Which is e∣qual to the relieving of the distressed and to do my best to hinder any man that fought against that most Excellent pious King, Charles the First, under the Standard of the Beast, to carry away, and injoy any part of the inheritance of the Church of Christ for his reward, for that transcendent wickedness.
And therefore I spent already about four hun∣dred pounds in repairing the ruinous Cathedral, and above three hundred pounds more in seeking the right of the Church out of the hands of Huck∣sters, and the Adversaries of King Charles the First: And I do profess, that having food and rayment, and to defray my necessary occasions, I weigh not one straw, either of mine augmentation, or of any other supportation that I have:I dare take my oath, I am not, to this day, one penny the richer for my Bisho∣prick: When as the repa∣ration of the Church and Bishops house, the Suits in Law to re∣cover the re∣venues of the Bishoprick, and the prin∣ting of my Books, for the service of the Church, and the good of Gods peo∣ple, hath con∣sumed all that I recei∣ved. God is, El Shaddai, a God all-suficient for me, as he hath been hitherto.
But I beg this of your Grace, in respect of the poor See of Ossory, and the succeeding Bishops, that perhaps shall not pass through so many storms as I have done, and therefore shall not be so well
 able to abide the weather, and to endure the wants that I did, but will be most willing to do God that good service, which God and such good men as the King and your Grace will inable them to do.
And I doubt not, but as your Grace hath al∣wayes been so sweet a Friend, and so bountiful a Benefactor and Patron, both to my self, and many more of the Servants of Christ; so your Grace, without any motion of mine, will do far better things, and things far better then I can prescribe or imagine.
And therefore, craving pardon for my presump∣tion, I rest,
