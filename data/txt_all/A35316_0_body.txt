Right Honourable;
HAving lately finished this discourse of Cavallry, intending it onely for my private use and information, it had the fortune to light into the hands of two noble and judici∣ous perusers. The one (during the short discontinuance from his regiment, while it lay in winter garrison) hath been courteously pleased to go through it, correcting what here and there was amisse, supplying some things defective, and mani∣festing his approbation of it with an Imprimatur. The other (among other things) hath chiefly vouchsafed his assistance and directions for the managing of the horse, and handling of arms; as being a thing princi∣pally necessary, and that wherein authours have hitherto been defective. These considerations, together with the commanding request (among others) of some of your Honours Deputy-Lieutenants (not any arrogan∣cie or ambition of mine) have prevailed with me (in hope of publick good) to expose these weak essaies to the publick view of the world. Now since the patronizing of a work of Marshall discipline, seemeth most properly to belong to the Earl Marshall; and that charge wherewith I stand entrusted within your Lordships Lieutenancy, obligeth me in du∣ty to consecrate the best of my endeavours to your Honours service: May it please your Honour (of your innate clemency, and favour to Arts) to vouchsafe your honourable patronage and protection on these poore labours of his, who shall ever (in all humility) remain,
