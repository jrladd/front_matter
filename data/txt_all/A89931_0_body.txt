My LORD,
THis small Treatise, which I have presumed to recommend unto the world under your Honours Patronage, besides the novel∣tie of the subject, so little, or not at all touched upon in any Booke, at leastwise that I have seen, speaking our Tongue, cannot be but well received, as I con∣ceive, by all such as any way pretend to the knowledge of forraigne affaires, both for that it treates of so principall and
active a body and society of men, as that of the Colledge of Cadinalls, Princes Fellowes, as they are reputed, and the greate Councell, and Consistory of that mysterious Head, the Pope of Rome; as also because it discovers many par∣ticularities of the practique as wel in the elections of the said Cardinalls, as like∣wise of their severall interests, and hopes they may conceive to themselves of arriving one day at Peters Chaire; and also what kind of Pope each of them is like to prove, in case he should attaine to that honour. Moreover I make no question but that it will be a very plea∣sing thing to most men, to have such a lively character by them, as my Author bere gives, of every one of those Arch∣politicians, and Councellors, who have such an influence into all the debates and results of that pragmatique Super∣intendent Court, and Consistory: which
Lords and Lawes it, or would wil∣lingly doe so, over the whole world. Of no lesse satisfaction too, suppose I, it will bee to see so clearely chalked out all the severall applications of all the Popish Princes and States, espe∣cially of the two great Kings of France and Spaine, by their Ministers, ever Ledger about this Court, to the most po∣litique, and powerfull of these Cardi∣nals; out-vying each other in the offer of pensions, or indeavoring by the gift of spirituall dignities and preferments unto them, to insure and ingage them as much as possible they may, to the es∣pousing the interests of that Crown, for which they serve; and yet what poore hold notwithstanding, either of these Princes hath of them; and how apt they are upon very slight motives to range themselves on the quite con∣trary faction, is a matter not unworthy
of observation. These and severall o∣ther Remarques touching the now Car∣dinalls, the Pope at this day regnant, and his particular family, are presen∣ted in this little Tract, which, I would willingly make my selfe beleeve, will bee as delightfull to the judicious, as it was pleasing to mee in the translating thereof. As for common and perfun∣ctory Readers, I shall say as Antima∣chus Clarius said, when in the very in∣terim, as he was reciting a peece which hee had made, all but Plato left him, unus mihi Plato instar multo∣rum; for, so as your Honour be pleased to approve of, and favorablely re∣ceive it, the paines I have taken therein are abundantly satisfied, what reception soever it may finde of o∣thers; as having attained the maine end I proposed to my selfe in the pub∣lishing of it; which was, that it might
be as acceptable to your Lordship, as it is heartily desired it should bee, by him, who in all himble affection is,
My Lord,
