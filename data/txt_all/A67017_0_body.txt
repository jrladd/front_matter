May it please Your Majesties,
NExt to the Pleasure of doing well, there is no greater satisfaction than where the Performance meets with a favourable reception from those for whose sake it is designed. I thank God I have this dou∣ble Comfort in the Testimony of a good Conscience, and Your Majesties Gracious Acceptance of the poor services God enabled me to doe for your Majesties In∣terest, and the Safety of those Protestants, whom the Fu∣ry of the Papists drove into London-Derry.
Nor am I more pleased with Your Majesties Royal Bounty to me, much above not only my Merit, but Expectation, than with Your Majesties Tenderness for my Poor Fellow Sufferers and Partners in that Action, whom I doubt not but Your Majesties will find as brave

But as the whole Conduct of this matter must be ascribed to Providence alone, as it ought, this should then give them occasion to consider that God has Espoused your Majesties Cause, and Fights your Battels, and for the Protestant Religion; and by making use of a poor Minister, the unworthiest of the whole Communion, of which he is a Member, would intimate to the World, by what Hand he will defend and maintain both your Majesties Interest, and the Religion you have delivered from those that were ready to swallow both up.
That which I here presume to lay at Your Majesties Feet, is indeed very unfit for Your Royal View; but that since Importunity would have it publick, I thought it Sacrilege to entitle any other to the Copy, than those to whom the Original was devoted. The Picture can∣not be commended for the Workmanship, but it may possibly be the more acceptable, for that because more resembling the Life from which 'tis drawn: There is little Skill, or Art, in either, but there are Ornaments much more valuable in both, natural Simplicity, Sin∣cerity, and a plain Truth, In which character I hum∣bly beg Your Majesties will always consider, and ac∣cept of the Endeavours of
