O! For a Quil of that Arabian wing,
That's hatch't in Embers of some kindled fire,
VVho to her self, her self doth issue bring,
And three in one is young, and Dame and Sier:
O! that I could to Virgils Vein aspire,

Or Homers Verse, the Golden Language Greek,
VVith polish'd Phrases, I my Lines would tire,
Into the deep of Art my Muse should seek,
Mean time amongst the vuglar she must throng,
Because she hath no help from my unlearned tongue;
Great is the Glory of the Noble Mind,
VVhere Life and Death are equal in respect,
If Fates be good or bad, un kind, or kind;
Not proud in Freedom, nor in Thrall deject,
VVith courage scorning fortunes worst effect,
And spitting in fond Envies cankered Face,
True Honour thus doth baser thoughts deject;
Esteeming Life a slave that serves disgrace,
Foul abject thoughts become the mind that's base,
That deems there is no better life nor this,
Or after death doth fear a worser place,
VVhere guilt is payed the guardian of a miss;
But let swoln Envy swell untill she burst,
The Noble Mind desies her, do her worst;
If Homers Verse in Greek did merit praise,
If Naso in the Latine won the bayes,
If Maro amongst the Romans did excell,
If Tosa in the testine tongue wrot well;
A Souldier that could never lead a Pen,
Shows to the eight or ninth Generation,
Although I him enrol, and call him Shepherds Swain,
Yet hereby I approve he is a Gentleman;
The Son of Adam, who was by Lot,
The Brother of the worthy Collonel Scot,
VVho died with honour at Dumbars fight,
In maintenance of King and Countries Right:
He was the Son, I know it for truth

Of William Scot, Laird of Whitehaugh,
And William Scot was the eldest son
Of Walter Scot, stil'd of the same;
Walter Scot was Robert's son,
And Robert he was Walter's son:
The first of Whitehaugh that from Borthwick sprung,
That Wat of Whitehaugh was Cousin-german,
To Iohn of Borthwick, who fasted so long,
Three sundry times he did perform
To fast fourty days, I do aver;
Bishop Spotswood, my Author is he,
A profound learn'd Prelat that would not lie:
When Iames the fifth he was Scotlands King,
In the Castle of Edinburgh he incarcer'd him,
And would not believe the Country says,
That any Mortal could fast fourty days;
Bear-bread and Water the King allow'd for his Meat,
But Iohn Scot refus'd, and would not eat:
When the fourty days were come and gone,
He was a great deal lustier than when he began.
Then of the King he did presume,
To beg recommendation to the Pope of Rome,
Where there he fasted fourty days more,
And was neither hungry, sick, nor sore:
From Rome he did hastily return,
And arrived in Brittain at London,
VVhere Henry the eight he got notice,
That Iohn Scot had fasted twice fourty dayes;
The King would not believe he could do such thing,
For which he commanded to incarcerate him;
Fourty days expir'd he said he had no pain,
Than his Fast had been but ten hours time:

Here Walter Scot I'le draw near an end,
From Iohn of Borthwick thy Fathers did descend;
He was the son of Walter, I have said enough,
Their Original is from Buckcleugh.
In the Fourscore Psalm we read,
That like a Flock our God did Ioseph lead;
And ev'ry day we do confess almost,
That we have err'd and stray'd like Sheep that's lost,
For Oaths, and passing words, and joyning hands,
Is like Assurance written in the Sands,
The silly Sheeps-skin turn'd to Parchment thin,
Shows that Iasons Golden Fleece with thee remains.
