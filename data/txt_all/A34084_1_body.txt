May it please your Grace,
WHen I formerly had the Honour of Your Acquaintance, tho' at a distance, I reckon'd it none of my least Felicities: But since

that happy Providence that deli∣vered these Nations, brought Your Grace nearer, to Illustrate these Northern Regions with Your excellent Doctrine, and warm them with Your pious Example; I could not better express my extraordinary Satisfaction and my Duty both, than by presenting these Papers to Your Grace, who have suffered so much from the Romish Party, and done so much to prevent their once growing and dangerous Errors.
These Collections were all made, when this Church was threatned to have their Corrupti∣ons imposed on us; and the First Part was ready for the Press while that Cloud hung over our Heads. This Second Part hath been hin∣dred

by divers necessary Avocati∣ons, but now comes to appear under Your Grace's auspicious Patronage; and if it be so happy also to gain Your Approbation, that will recommend it to all that know Your Grace's solid Judgment and Undisguised In∣tegrity. Frauds and Forgeries are naturally Your Aversation, and therefore the discovery of so great a heap of them, may I hope be acceptable to Your Grace; not on your own Account, to whom probably here is nothing New; but because this Essay may assist young Divines and such as begin to read Church-History, at a cheap and easy rate to distinguish Truth from Falshood in matters of great importance. I shall add no more,

since to give your Grace your just Character, is as needless as it would be difficult for me, and would not be pleasing to your Grace; only I shall most heartily pray, That the Church may be long happy in Your Conduct, and that he may be reckoned among Your Grace's Friends, who is,
My Lord,
