SIR,
BEing my self competently satisfied in the true reasoning, and thorough∣ly assured of the good meaning of this en∣suing Discourse, I am thereby encouraged to present it to your view, as the most able Judge, that I know, both of the Ar∣gument, and the Performance, and to beg your impartial Censure and Opinion of it. I know indeed by long Experience your Candour and Kind-nature to be so great, as to be apt sometimes to sway your Judg∣ment;

but (Sir) I beseech you to set that aside for once, and to peruse this Treatise not with the courtesie of a Pa∣tron but the more obliging freedom of a Friend, (to which familiar Relation, after your kindness had made me in any measure fit for and worthy of it, you have been pleased long since to admit me.) And so (Sir) you very well know that of old the Philosophers and Professours of Learning were not wont to address their Discourses to great and unlearned Patrons, as has been the fashion of our modern times, but to their friends and acquaintance of the greatest skill in that sort of Learning that they profest, and that not for their Protection, as the Com∣plement now runs, but their sincere and friendly Censure. Varro was a greater Patron than any Senatour of Rome. And though some of the eminent men of Learning were great men in the Common∣wealth

too, yet their Friends were not wont to make their Addresses to them as Members of the Senate or the Areopa∣gus, but of the more honourable Society of Philosophers.
And that (Sir) is the onely design I have in presenting these Papers to your hands, not to load your modesty with the usual complements and formalities of De∣dications, but to request your free and impartial Judgment of them, and by that I shall be directed to frame my own. And if they prove so fortunate as to gain your Approbation, that alone will secure me of their Acceptance with all wise and lear∣ned Men. But whatever they are, I earnestly beseech you to accept of them as a small Token of unfeigned and indelible Gratitude from,
SIR,
