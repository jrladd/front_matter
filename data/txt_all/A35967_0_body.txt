My LORD,
I Had formerly the Happiness of wearing an humble Relation to Sir Kenelm Digby, and to his Business; by means of which In∣terest and Favour, there came to my hand divers of his Excellent Curiosuies and Receipts: In truth, it is so choice a Col∣lection, that in the first place I made it a mat∣ter

of Conscience to recommend it to the Pub∣lick: And (having permission from his inge∣nious Son Mr. John Digby thereunto) my next care was, so to do it, as to render all pos∣sible Honour and Right to the Memory of that eminent Person. Upon which Consideration, I have taken the boldness to make a Dedication of it to your Lordship, as the most competent Judge and Patron of Learning and Vertue. From which presumption, I shall now descend to my self again, and vanish with this Prote∣station, That without pretending to the Honour of being any way known to your Lordship, No man living bath a greater Reverence for your Person and Faculties, than
My LORD,
