Sir,
THe scribling Gen∣tlemen
of this im∣pertinent
Gene∣ration,
in despite
of all the damning Criticks of
the age, that very much oblige
the Dramatick Tribe with con∣tinual
matter for their Pro∣logues,
are come to that impu∣dence
as to write still on, and

usher in a bad Treatise with a
worse Dedication. This is
grown so familiar to the fine
Men of the Town, that for
all can be said, will still be most
damnably opinionate, that the
poor fool, that must needs trou∣ble
himself with the turning of
this foolery, was resolved out
of meer complaisance to do as
the rest did, and then out-ri∣val
his fellows too both in non∣sence
and Impudence, which
your Lordship must needs avow
he has most egregiously per∣formed,
when he assumed the
vanity to make your Honour
a present of such a trifle. That

incomparable Judgement, and
Ingenuity that your Lordship
is even to a miracle endowed
withal, will very much advance
the vanity of the proud Tran∣slator;
the most accomplished
wit of the age may have just
cause to tremble when he ex∣poses
his most absolute and per∣fect
pieces to the censure of
your Lordship, (this is a truth
that the whole Kingdom is
conscious of, and the Turner
of this Gallantry was not ig∣norant
of if) as he may justly
defy all the world, when he
has once acquired your Lord∣ships
approbation of it, but

since my French Author was
my president, and had so good
an esteem for this piece, at to
judge it worth the acceptance
of their Royal Highnesses of
Savoy, I suddainly resolved
to pursue my Translation, and
transcribe his pride of well
Gallantry, and that I might
assume some liberty to my self,
have made it something the
more nonsensical (it is posible
it may please the better)
by prefixing an Epistle to
an Epistle, and Dedi∣cating
a Dedication. Your
Lordship will be graciously
pleased to excuse this gay non∣sense,

and pardon so extrava∣gant
an address, which you
can only impute to your Noble
self, whose very name is so
charming and attractive, that
I was hurried on by an Entheu∣siasme
of mad Zeal, to Court
and Embrace (as I would
Health and Happiness, or what
else is dearer to me in the world)
this blest occasion to subscribe
my self.
