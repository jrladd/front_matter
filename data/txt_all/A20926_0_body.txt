MADAME;
AS the sweet and glori∣ous harmony of your heroicall vertues, in so high a birth, most happily conjoyned and matched with the most illustrious Lord your husband, the very patterne of

true Nobilitie, enforceth the world farre and neere with honour and admiration to behold and renowne you: so doth my con∣dition require, that I within this little Bri∣tain world, in which wee live, should unto your publike glory adde my particular te∣stimony of your bountie and munificence, whereby I am engaged, above any other of your servants, to seeke any means both to intimate my humble dutie, and to pro∣fesse my thankfull mind to your noble fa∣milie. Neither needed I goe farre to find my occasion and subject; but even to make use of that, which in your service, and with∣in the walls of your own house, I had pro∣duced: I meane my observations of the manner of painting in use among the anci∣ents. For seeing your Ladiship upon the first sight of my Latine copie, was pleased to expresse your desire of having it Engli∣shed; there seemed a way to be opened un∣to

me, of effecting that my serviceable in∣tent: and the rather, because some things having passed therein, which (as one day teacheth another) in the review and more mature cogitation I wished might be alte∣red, I thought best to begin that correcti∣on in this present Edition. Nor doe I so much over-ween, but that I see and con∣fesse, that this translation befitteth rather the native fluency of one in-bred, than the forced stile of a forrainer; and therfore un∣to severe eyes it might seeme an unpardo∣nable presumption, to have taken upon me a burden so unfit for my shoulders to beare, and therewith to interrupt your higher conceits; yet feeling my selfe inspired with courage by the signification of your noble desire (which wrought in my heart, what an absolute command useth to worke in o∣thers) I stoutly fell to my taske. Wherein I doubt not, but that, if your Honor by a

favourable construction shall judge me not altogether undutifull, though not precise∣ly officious; others also will think that this my forwardnesse in accomplishing your desire, may make all pardonable, if not in some degree acceptable. Howsoever these rude and imperfect attempts of your duti∣full servant, shall finde their chiefest pro∣tection and perfection in wearing the faire and glorious livery of your most noble and worthy name. And thus humbly lay∣ing both my selfe and my endeavours at the feet of your Ladiship, to whom I wish all encrease of honor and happinesse, I ever remaine
