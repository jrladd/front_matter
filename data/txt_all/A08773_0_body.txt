HAuing by speciall occasion, and for the vse of mine owne, laboured this lit∣tle thing (supposing some other rurall Congregati∣ons also might not be vnlike) and it com∣ming to the sight of some of my friends, (of greater learning and iudgement by farre then my selfe) and thought not vn∣fit to goe abroad, for winning in people
(if God so blesse it) more willing obedi∣ence vnto this Exercise; yea, and some little incitation vnto some of y, my Brethren (with leaue be it spoken) slum∣bering (I know not how, yes, by a sole estimation, as I iudge, of the maruellous, indeede, Diuine, and most excellent Ex∣ercise of publike Preaching, the glorie thereof, by much and often beholding, hauing dazeled your eyes; for farre be it from any, hauing the spirit of Christ, to say, or thinke, this Chaire is base, and below mine honour, where the chiefest in the Church may sit with grace and grauitie; this thing weake, and beneath my strength, wherein the tallest and strongest may goe deepe vnto his length) in the neglect of this dutie, diuine also, and such, as making the beautie of Prea∣ching the more to shine, the profit of Prea∣ching the more to spread, very kindly and comely, as mother and daughter, or friend with friend, may go together: I commend it to your godly consideration, and my
selfe to your charitable opinion; seeking herein nothing else but the best welfare of you, and yours, and praying for the same vnto Him, who hauing loued vs so, as lay∣ing down his life for our sakes, and looking for this very fruit of our loue towards him againe, saith vnto euery Peter, Feede, Feede, not my Sheepe onely, but also my Lambes, euen with this Milke at the first, as fittest for them.
