Honoured Sir,
TWO things have emboldened me to dedicate this Book un∣to you, the one is, your known Abilities to approve or reject what is good or bad in Histories, wherein your Judgment appears as sound and clear as the Sun is perspicuous in a serene day; so that we may say of you, as the Romanists in other things, of

their Arch-Priest, that you are there∣in infallible. The other drift of my ambition in this Dedication is, to make a publick expression of the Love and Service I bear to your self and No∣ble Family, which for many Ages hath flourished in honour and best repute; and which caused you to be chosen one of the Senators of this flourishing Kingdom. To these I might add a third, that under your worthy Patronage others might be profited thereby, especially two sorts of People; First, those who have not money to buy great Volumes, and by that means are destitute of helps from such Books which should con∣duce to a general knowledge of Histo∣ry; and then most Volumes treating

onely of one continued subject, with∣out the help of a great many, they cannot attain to a perfection in the general. Secondly, for those who have not time to peruse such volu∣minous Authors, herein may they he instructed with the marrow and quintessence of what others more largely treat of, like a little Watch, shewing the time of the day as well as a great Clock. I suppose it needless to treat of the benefit and pleasure of these miscellaneous Histories, since variety gives the greatest pleasure to most sorts of People; When doth the Earth appear in its greatest glory, but in the month of May, when Lady Flo∣ra hath diaper'd the Meads with va∣riety of flowers? Our Comedies would

not give such general content, were they composed of one continued Subject, and not intermixed with several Hu∣mours. History is the mirrour for us to look in, which represents to us, things past as if they were present, and enables us to make a rational conjecture of things to come. In brief, there is nothing compleats a Gentleman so much as the knowledge of History, nor no kind of History so much as these miscellaneous Dis∣courses. Deign Sir, to accept hereof as a mite of accknowledgment of the respests born to your worthy self, by,
