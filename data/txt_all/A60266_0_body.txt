May it please your Honour, My Lord,
IT is not the least amongst those Oriental Gems, which adorn the Breast of Nobility, nor ought it to be reputed the meanest orna∣mental Vertue, that by its lu∣stre renders the minds of No∣ble Persons truly such, not on∣ly to be thought, but really to be encouragers of every gene∣rous
and useful undertaking; not barely in Specie but effectu∣ally to become Patrons to eve∣ry noble Design. And surely among the great variety of To∣picks for discourse (the Hy∣story of things appertaining to another World, Divinity I mean excepted) none but in one sence or other yields the Bayes to that highly useful one of health (with its Introducti∣ons and Appendices) whether relating to the continuation or restauration thereof; to which our ensuing History is so near∣ly concerned as to merit the repute of being mainly intro∣ductory thereto: whose adapt∣ness to humane necessities will
evidently appear if we silently resolve within our own bo∣soms the ensuing Queries, viz. What resentment of Grandeur has an aching head, although encircled within the most glo∣rious Crown? What delight can a Statesman take in Regu∣lating and setting at Rights the Grand Affairs of his Countrey while he labours under the Conspiracy of prevalent, al∣though couchant, Maladies? What pleasure hath a morbid and (therefore) disgustful Palate, the bane of Epicurism, in the fruition of the greatest Delicacies, even amidst the great variety which accosts that erring sensual Organ?
What profit can a Rich man take of all his wealth, while he labours under the pains of a Gouty fit? What quiet have we in the settlement of our Lands and Tenements; while the morbid Tenant we inward∣ly foster, turns Lawyer and Bayliff too, sues and turns us out of possession by an irresi∣stible Lease of Ejectment? And in fine, what satisfaction have we of any thing we enjoy here below, while we truckle under any Grief or Malady? Now, my Lord, the generousness of the Subject we treat upon, viz. The History of these Mineral healing waters, is such as (a∣mong other useful Essayes, to∣wards
a publick good) may from a solution of the aforesaid Queries, as also from other in∣timate Arguments, deservedly challenge your Honours Patro nage, in as much as you have been particularly pleased out of the sence of that good you have experimentally reaped thereby to do that right to Scarbrough Waters, as in the presence of several worthy Personages publickly to own them, by giving this Autopti∣cal testimony thereof (at least what was equivalent thereto) That of all the Mineral waters you had tasted (few in En∣gland or France having esca∣p'd your test) these of Scar∣brough
surpassed, both as to a thorow as well as effectual working: By which your Lordship received considera∣ble relief the last Summer from the oppressing symptoms of the Hypochondraical wind, al∣though at the latest season of the year. — And, my Lord, not∣withstanding the following Tract as most-what grounded upon experience, (the mother of Knowledge) having its root deeply set in, and firmly knit upon, matter of Fact, is doubtless the better able to bear up, yea stand and vindi∣cate it self against the shocks of any Calumniating Quill whatever; yet upon due and mature
consideration, there is much safety for such a shrub how well rooted soever, to be planted under so tall a Cedar, that so it may not only in an hot season (when tender Plants are apt to wither,) thence re∣ceive shade, but also in Win∣ter and stormy weather, when there is no shelter. To con∣clude, my Lord, what ser∣vice your Lordship may do to that Countrey in this your tutelage to so good a design, that you may live long enough to experience, and by your (if need be) annual visits to confirm, is the desire of,
