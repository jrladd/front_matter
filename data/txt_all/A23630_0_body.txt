GENTLEMEN,
VVHen I see your INDEFATIGABLE Care in procuring men (that without which all the World is nothing) HEALTH, the PRIMARY cause, sole Foundation and Prop of Humane FELICITY; and how the experience of so many years manifests to all men, by the happy success of your Undertakings, and your great Charity to the Poor, that your private in∣tentions do correspond admirably well with your external actions; and that all your indeavours are real and unfeigned: I am perswaded, that whatever can in any wise contribute to the pro∣moting of your most Noble and Generous De∣sign, can't but be acceptable to you. Where∣fore having with the same passion, for the pub∣lick

Advantage, composed the following small Treatise, I take the liberty most humbly to pre∣sent it You; that (as You are the best JUDGES of the thing) so You may by Your Judicious and Impartial Censure of it, inform the World of its worth; that no person may be deceiv'd in it. For my intentions in publishing it, being to advance the common Good; if I thought it did contain any thing contrary to that DESIGN, I shou'd be the first that wou'd indeavour its suppression.
But, GENTLEMEN, besides the foregoing reasons, which I had of offering You this first Essay of mine, I did it also to acquit my self in some measure of my Duty towards You; and to assure You further, that I am in all respects,
GENTLEMEN,
