CHristian Ladies, (give me leave so to entitle you, since I know no title more truly honourable, where it may be truly given) I
am bold to joyne you toge∣ther in this Dedication, though unknowne each to other:
1. Because you are both well knowne to him, who hath fore-knowne from all Eternity those whom he loves with his peculiar love.
2. Because the subject of this Treatise is sutable to the condition of you both; both of you have neede of joy, in that long time you have drunke deeply of the cuppe of sadnesse and sorrow: and both of you have cause of joy, in that your good GOD hath given you faire evidences that your Names are written in Heaven, which is the principall ground of all true joy.
 3 The loving respect that both of you have long time shewed to my selfe (which now hath lasted almost these thirty years) calls for some re∣spectfull acknowledgement.
I could thinke of no∣thing more sutable to my ability or your necessity, then to present you with some Spirituall gift, which might be fit to helpe you to your heavenly home with more cheerefulnesse and comfort. Be pleased therefore to read and consider, to accept and apply what you shall finde in this ensuing Treatise usefull to that end. Now the God of all hope sill you with all peace and joy in beleeving, and cause you in due time to re∣ceive
the end of your faith and hope, namely the salva∣tion of your soules.
