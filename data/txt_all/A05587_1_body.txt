Mr Virgine Muse, leaues Nothing she can finde,
Which may agree with your Heroick minde.
Pleasing her selfe, to lay before your sight,
The generous pastimes wherein you delight:
From Nothing first, how many things were fram'd
Shee tells, who first the fierie Courser tam'd,
How astiuely to backe him he beginnes,
And by what meanes to gentlenes him winnes.
Mistake me not, I do not write to teach you,
For in this Art, he liues not that can reach you.



My running Pen must make a litle boasting.
What skill she gaind of you, in her swift poasting.
Take all in worth, with my well▪meaning hart▪
I want a Horse, well may I want the Art.
