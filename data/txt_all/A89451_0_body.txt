THis ensuing Tran∣slation with the whole
dresse and Equipage of it was the production of some
spare time, when I was de∣barrd from better imploy∣ment, to witt,
the exercise of my function and mini∣stry. I found contentment in
the Reading, and there∣fore have committed it to the presse for the
publique use in a more intelligible language.
I send it forth upon the Reputation of the
Author, which is very eminent in the
Common-wealth of Learning: which will com∣mend it to the
world and your reading, without any other Bush at the doore, 

—Nec Phoebo gratior ulla est
Quàm quae Virgilii prae∣scripsit pagina
nomen.
His pen upon paper is like a Prince his stampe
upon coine, wch makes any thing current and sterling, what ever
the metal be, and how small soever the mo∣del. Hereupon I
am indu∣ced to believe that these Letters (which I may call the Marquesse
his Parva Moralia) will find as good acceptance with the
Judici∣ous, as his Parva Politica did, I meane
his Romulus and Tarquin, and other small, but
well-wrought peeces.
I have prefixt your name (Sir) before this
Tract, that those that shall chance to see and reade it, may
al∣so read my Gratitude, and the Title which you have in
me, and whatsoever I can call mine; which you have
purchased by mani∣fold kindnesses and season∣able
favours, whereof I shal retaine a gratefull memo∣ry while I am master of
one.
Since the death of your honoured Brother (whose
name is like oyntment powred forth) we find that of the Poet
verified in you, 

—Uno avulso, non defi∣cit alter
Aureus, & simili fron∣descit virga
metallo.
One golden bough being lopt off, another (of the same
metal) succeeds in the roome of it. For his Benignity, Candor,
and other Noble and vertuous Habits survive in you; so
that the losse of him is (in a good measure) recom∣penced in your
Succession.
God blesse you with health, and the fruition of many and happy
dayes: which are the hearty wishes of
 June 3.
