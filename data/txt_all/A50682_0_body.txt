Worthy Sirs,
I Was much surprized with your desire, that this plain Sermon might be Printed: Nor can I yet in cooler thoughts conje∣cture (though its shortness, the best com∣mendation of bad Musick, had possibly gain∣edit a Favourable Acceptance from the Pul∣pit) what might incline you to desire its further Publication; unless (for I more va∣lue

your Judgments, than fondly to imagine you could think it worthy) you had a mind to try, whether, in an Age, when many talk of what they know not how to practise, I could shew either Courage or Obedience, that had discoursed of them: Of both which I have here given some Proof. Of Courage, that having, for one Passage, full of Truth and Innocence, passed the Pikes, I have ad∣ventured once more to run the Gantlope; and of Obedience, that like the Centurions Servant, when you said Do this, I have done it; to approve my self,
GENTLEMEN,
