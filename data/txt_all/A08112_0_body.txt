Reuerend and worthy Sir,
THE combination of zeale and learning wherewith God hath honourd You, the loue You beare to the He∣brew studies, and the cause handled in this litle tract, together with the mani∣fold

fauours You haue pleased to vouch∣safe me (being as yet vnknowne vnto You) haue beene the Allectiues to this small remembrance; whereby coveting to shew my thankefulnesse, I first offer vnto you the first fruits of these my poore indeauours. And albeit comming now to write in this manner, after the diuers treatises of tithes already ex∣tant, I know it is but litle that can either be performed, or expected from me in this subiect: yet as the Iewes in gathering their fruits in Haruest, beside their ob∣lations and tithes, had also their  Levit. 19.9. Deut. 24.19, 20. i. the corner of the field, the glea∣ning, and the forgotten sheafe, which were assigned to the vse and benefit of the poore: so in some respect may I judge these scattered, slender, and poore

Collections to be much of the like nature; and therefore desiring to cast my mite into the treasury of the Church, I pre∣sent them vnto You; in hope that as You haue already afforded them Your fauou∣rable Construction, so You will please al∣so to assist them, so farre as truth re∣quires, with your willing and able prote∣ction. And thus beseeching the Almighty to blesse You and Your worthy labours to his glory, and the good of the Church, I take my leaue, and rest

Lexden,
May 4. 1625.
