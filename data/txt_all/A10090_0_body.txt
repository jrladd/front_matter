MAY it please your Maiestie,
when I consider my owne vn∣worthines,
I checke my selfe
for my presumption, in that I
haue aduentured to write vn∣to
a Prince of so great power
and wisedom, as is your king∣ly
selfe: but when I do remember that your High∣nes
desireth to be approued a good poore mans
King: then in the hope of your gratious accep∣tance,
I not repent the little labour that I haue
bestowed: in which the clearenes of my consci∣ence
beares me vp, and makes me hope, that in my
vpright course, I shall not in the least sort dis∣please
the mightines of your great maiestie. I haue

like a Soldier hent my selfe against your publike
enemies, and the foes of Christ, in the iustice of
which course my resolution hath resolued in life
and death to doe your Highnes faithfull and o∣bedient
seruice: your poorest subict, my renow∣ned
Soueraign, humbly entreateth that you would
be pleased gratiousely for to accept this his trife∣ling
gift, and with your mercies eye to view the
lines vnto your princelie selfe directed, and if
they shall procure your content, your seruant then
receiues the fulnes of his ioy, and gaines vnto him∣selfe
his most desired recompence, with all sub∣mission
he referreth himselfe, and this his worke
to be censured by your Maiestie, vnto whome he
wisheth Salomons wisedome, Dauids heart,
and Ioshuas courage, with al the best cōmended
vertues which did attend on them: that Englands
king may be a mirror to the world, and that the
nations of the earth may wonder at the long con∣tinuance
of your most happy and princely gouern∣ment.
