THree things to euery Action Lustre giue;
The Will, Art, Age: All for Acceptance striue:
The Will, presents things weake, but Art supplies them,
Time perfits all, and like a Touch-stone tries them:
Of three I challenge one, and that's the Will,
Which I present, for want of Age and Skill:
Desire to please hath made me bold to sue
To all for Loue, for patronage to You.
