My LORD,
THE Queen of Sweden,
who travell'd so much, and
spoke so many Languages, being
now the Subject of this present Hi∣story,
implores your Lordship's

Protection, having but newly learn'd
to speak English: She comes not
now as formerly, in the Pomp and
Splendor of a Crown, but to render
an Account of her Actions, which
in her Life-time, made so mighty a
noise in the World; and which, tho'
they cannot be called altogether In∣nocent,
are yet very diverting, and
will, I question not, afford a great
deal of Pleasure and Delight to the
Reader; there being no Tragedy
in her whole Life, except that of
the Murder of the Marquis Mo∣naldeschi.
She always maintain'd the Ma∣jesty
of a Queen, both in her Per∣son
and Character, to the highest
Degree; and her Wit and Parts
were so very extraordinary, that

they raised the Admiration of all.
Her Inclinations were nice and cu∣rious,
and her Passions strong and
violent; but the Vanity and Incon∣stancy
of her Temper, would not
suffer them to endure long; and
she had none of any Continuance,
except that which she had for Chy∣mistry,
which lasted even to her
dying Day. The great Opinion she
had conceived of her own Abilities
in all things, did very much con∣tribute
to the Cheat, she put upon
her self in this Affair, and caus'd
her to be led by those wandring Ex∣perimentators,
who being deceiv'd
themselves, make no scruple to de∣ceive
others. The Author has
handled them very severely, and
some of them no less than they de∣serve,

and especially such as those,
the Queen of Sweden generally
met with.
In short, as she was a Princess
of a wonderful mixture, and strange
variety, there is something to be
found in every turn of her Actions,
so great and surprizing, that there
needs more than a common Under∣standing,
to make a right Judg∣ment
concerning her. She cannot
therefore be recommended to a fit∣ter
Hand than your Lordship's, not
only in regard of the Greatness of
your Descent and Original, but of
your Candor, and good Humour,
together with the Excellency of your
Parts, and that Exactness of Judg∣ment,
for which you are so justly
celebrated.

The Author of this History,
spends a great deal of time, in de∣scribing
the Persons that compos'd
her Court, and their Adventures
are so interwoven with the Queens
Affairs, that he could not avoid
it; but both the Characters, and
Adventures are so pleasant, that
they make a sufficient Recompence;
and indeed the History would not
have been compleat without it. They
are fill'd up with a great number
of Delightful Intrigues, and odd
Circumstances, and most of the
Accidents are so entertaining, that
I perswade my self that your Lord∣ship,
who is so Communicative
and Generous upon all Occasions,
will permit me to make use of so
great a Name, to recommend this





Translation to them, who cannot,
with your Lordship, discern the
Beauties of the Original, and will
pardon the Ambition, with which
I subscribe my self,
My LORD,
