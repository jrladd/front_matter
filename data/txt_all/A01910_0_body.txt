OFTEN WITH MY SELFE considering (my nowne good Si∣sters) your vertuous and well dis∣posed minds, in these your yon̄g and tender yeares, I thought it meete (as well to shewe my good will towards you, as to satisfie your well inclined affectiōs) to take some trauaile in finding out such mat∣ter, as neither I might accōpt my time vainly spent in wryting, nor you yours euill employ∣ed in reading. Debating thus a whyle with my selfe what matter myght best herein serue both our turnes, I was thorowly resolued with asmuch diligence as I could to make some dis∣course vpon the perfite estate of a true christi∣an, an estate aboue all others most happie and worthy, if it were as well renowmed for lyfe, as it is reuerent for name, and perceyuing the lyues of Christians in these dayes so farre dif∣fering from the sinceritie that is required in a Christian professour, I gaue for tytle to my Booke the counterfeyt Christian, wherein I

declared the great disorders of this our tyme, as also the wonderfull vertues and puritie of lyfe, that gloriously shyned among the first and auncyent professours of Christ, whiche Booke beyng encreased to some largenesse of volume, and euen almost readie to be publy∣shed vnder the patronage and protection of your two names, by yll fauourd misfortune perished. Wherwithal somthing discontented that both I should thus bee defrawded of the effect of my long trauayle, and you of that which so long and so earnestly I ment you. With a scarse quiet mind I hastily began this volume, which (bicause of the daūgers of this worlde, whereby the soule enclosed in the barke of sinfull fleshe wyth great hasard pas∣seth) I named the Ship of safegarde, a Ship but rudely furnished, and God knowes sym∣ply rygged, as the great haste and small tyme enforced, wanting both strength of tymber and comlynesse of proporcion, two euydent signes of an vnskilfull workeman. Notwith∣standing howsoeuer it be, I dedicate it vnto you as an earnest token of my good wyll to∣wardes you, not doubting but you will so ac∣cept it, whervnto I had also thought to haue added (bicause I know you delight in stories)

the lyues and actes of dyuers men in the pri∣matiue Church, whereof I began with one or two, but bicause they were tedious, and my leisure but little, I left then and proceeded no farther. God poure vpon you his plenteous blessyng, graunt you long and prosperous yeres on earth, and after your passage from this vale of wretchednesse, euerlasting rest and ioy in the kingdome of Heauen. From Lon∣don the fourtenth of Februa∣rie.
