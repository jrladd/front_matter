SIR although my sences were soaked and ouer drowned with sorrow, for the death of our late dread Soueraigne, vnder whose Table I haue had (for the most part) my nourishment almost fortie yeares of my life past: and in my trauels, hearing some to dispute of his Maiesties iust and most lawfull Title: others to mourne with me, others to reioyce with Songs, Ballads, &c. And lastlie,

a Souldiers wish, Intituled to his Maiestie, and patronized by all the Lords, &c. I could not choose but imitate, and therefore haue written a briefe Epistle to the vulgar, touching his Maiesties Title. Secondly a meane Epitaph for her late Maiestie. Thirdly a fewe verses of reioycing after sorrow: And lastly, a prayer for the King, the Queene, and their children: With a thankesgiuing to God for sending their Maiesties to vs, with such hope of happy succession: all which I beseech you to patronize, with my selfe also, as your place and occasion may affoorde, and as Iustice and equitie accorâˆ£ding to your wisedome shall direct you. At my lodging neere Charing Crosse, the xxiii. of Aprill. 1603.
