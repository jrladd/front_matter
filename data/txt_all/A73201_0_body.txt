TO THE WORTHIE, AND FAVOROR OF ALL VERTVES, MASTER RI∣CHARD SONDS, SONNE and heire to the right Wor∣shipfull, Michael Sondes Esquier.
SIr the duetie I owe vnto you, proceeding of so many & in∣finit curtisies, in all bounti∣ful measure receiued, as well in your forraine trauailes, as in your home aboad, haue of long time been a continuall spurre to my weake forces; to finde some defence against that threatning monster ingratitude; & fin∣ding wayward fortune still waspishe in her wonted manner, euen loath to affoord me a good looke: am constrained, lest I should be of you and the worlde condemned, to take this poore occasion to shew mine affectionate mind,
not meaning thereby to make this a shew of a satisfaction for so great a debt, but onely in part in cutte off the consuming interest, and to confesse vnto you in the witnesse of the world a further duetie to bee accomplished. And knowing in parte the earnest desire you haue alwaies had; to see into forraine States, and acquaint your selfe with the diuers manners of nations. I finding here a wandering stran∣ger by chance, whom I perceiued fit to informe you of somewhat worthy the inquirie: hauing now procured him a poore English weede, I am bold to commend him vnto you, hoping you wil not deny him your friendly patronage, nor me your wonted fauour.
