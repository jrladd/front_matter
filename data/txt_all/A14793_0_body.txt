DIssemble not Pen, paint thy naked mind,
Draw the Anatomy of perfit loue,
And though Fortune to slender meanes thee bind,
Affectionate yet to thy Patron proue;
And tell thy friend, if Pouerty may steede,
He shall not faile to finde a friend at neede.


Giue him thy Passions, and thy Patience,
And in them both include thy louing hart,
Inuite him to thy Contents Residence,
And seast him there, to answere his desart:
That hast no Currant him to satisfie,
But loue, affection, and gratuity.


Europe hath Owners in possession placed,
Asia for her Subiects taketh care,
Affrica her Inhabitants hath graced,
America hath not a foote to spare,
And Indigence will not make thy Release,
Till some of these Possessioners decease.



Tell him, the Hand, that did this Pen direct,
If seruiceable, shall on him attend;
Tell him, the Hart, that doth his loue affect,
By prayers his Humanity defend?
Tell him, that Passions must his Patience craue,
Till Pouerty a richer Nature haue.
