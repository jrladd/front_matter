TO THE HEROICKE HEâˆ£ros,
HENRY Earle of Oxenford,
Vicount Bulbeck, &c.
SIr, if my vnpolish't pen, that dedicates now
The bashfull vtterance of a maiden Muse,
May gracefully arriue onely to you,
Which for her virgin sake, do not refuse,
Time, and more studious howers shall we vow,
To sing your vertues, which are now profuse.
Kings haue drunke water from a louing hand,
And truth's accepted, though we paint her poore.
The Poets say, the Gods that can command,
Haue feasted gladly on a poore mans store,
Whereby great, Sir, we haue to vnderstand,
That humble Riuers adde to the sea shore.
Liue long and happy, and with gray haires crown'd,
Reade thy youths acts, which fame shall euer sound.
