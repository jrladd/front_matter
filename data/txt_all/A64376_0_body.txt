My Honoured Friends and Brethren,
I Should think my self much wanting
to the Duty I owe both to Our
Corporation, and to your Selves,
if I should wholly ascribe the publishing
of this Sermon to your Importunity. I am

so very senfible of the excellent Ends and
Methods of this Establishment, that I
am not willing to omit the least thing
which may, in your Judgments, conduce
to them. It has, this present year (be∣sides
the Charity for putting forth Appren∣tices)
provided Five hundred and twelve
Pounds towards the support of Widows
of poor Ministers, and their Children.
I fear the Needs of the next year will
be greater than those of this; but cannot
but hope that the Supplies will grow in
proportion to them.
That God will prosper both Givers,
Managers, and Receivers, is the hearty
Prayer of,
