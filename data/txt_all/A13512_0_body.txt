MOst humbly (worthy) and religious Knight,
These things which did from my inuention flow:
On you in loue and dutie, I bestow,
Whose patronage can shield me safe from spight.
And though the stile, and phrase, vnpollisht be
Of new-coynd words, to please these Critick times,
(For I, no Scholler, what can come from me
But downe-right plaine, and ordinarie Rimes.)
Yet when your leisure serues you to peruse
These poore endeuours, which my wit hath done:
You shall perceiue my weake laborious Muse
Hath in this Worke, hir-selfe, hir-selfe outrun,
The Matters true, and truth I know you loue,
And Loue conduct you to the ioyes aboue.
