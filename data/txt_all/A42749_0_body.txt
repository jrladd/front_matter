Much Honour'd Sir,
SInce the Epidemic Villany of the Age ren∣ders
all praise suspected, it ought to be the
Care of those Authors, that are not fond of the
Reputation of Flatterers, to cull out such Pa∣trons,
as are not liable to the Censure of the
World, either for their Obscurity, or Opposite
Characters to what they receive from their
Pens. This made me think of laying these
Letters at your Feet, almost as soon as it was
resolv'd they should see light; and I am ex∣treamly
pleas'd to reflect I have, in my choice
of your Patronage evaded those two Rocks,
that might have split me on the Ill-nature of
the Town, since I am capable of saying nothing
on YOU, that can be imputed to Flattery;
your Uirtues being unknown to no Man,
that can pretend to have heard, but the least,
of the best Conversations, both for Honour, and

Parts; for Captain Porter, is granted by all
all to be the Soul of Conversaion.
Mistake me not Sir, I am not set∣ting
you up for the Pr, of an Hypocritical
Holiness, with a wide Old-fashion'd Coat, the
hereditary Lumber of some petty Broaker's
Shop, a long Beard, Stockings hanging about
your Legs, a pale meagre Face, an out of Hu∣mour
look; and the rest of the Ingredients, that
gain the Reputation of Precise Virtue from the
unthinking many▪ No—'tis far from my intentions
thus to deboch, and pervert your Character. But
when I mention your Uirtues, I take Virtue in its
genuine, and primitive Sense, in the Sense the
Old Romans took it in, before 'twas erroneously
translated to signifie Grimace, Affectation, Hy∣pocrisie,
and Ill-nature; I take it for Genero∣sity,
Courage, Wit, Aability, and all
the other Noble Qualifications that go to the
making up of the compleat Character of a
Gentleman; and there is none of these but
has receiv'd the Denomination of Virtue from
the best of the Roman Authors; nor is there
any Man that has the Honour to be acquaint∣ed
with you Sir, but knows there can be no∣thing
said of the just Accomplishments of a
Gentleman, but what is your due.
Were I therefore as sure of not offending
your Modesty, by a Praise which e'ry body
but your self thinks you deserve, as I am se∣cure
from the Censure of the World in it,
Desire would supply my want of Ability, and
make me attempt that which I know upon

cooler thoughts I am not able to perform so
as to make the Copy come near the Original;
for Praise is nothing but a solemn Repetition of
those Excellencies any one is really endow'd with,
and as long as we attribute nothing else,
we can't fall into the Vice of Flattery, which
is but a Transgression of the Bounds of Truth,
and giving a Man more than his due.
Praise being therefore nothing else, I can see
no reason (excepting the false Opinion a blind
Custom has impos'd upon us) why any Man
should be displeas'd to see a public Relation of
those Virtues he justly thinks the Glory of both
his private, and public Actions.
I must confess, I esteem it one of the nu∣merous
Tribe of vulgar Errors of the Age, to
think a Man ought not to take pleasure in,
and value himself on his confess'd Parts, and
Virtues. For 'tis certain that things are Good, or
Evil only in reference to Pleasure, and Pain,
by which the Mind judges of whatsoever it
chooses or avoids. And no Man can make choice
of any particular Virtues without being pleas'd
with them above the rest. And by applading
that Choice as good, by his Practice; he dis∣covers
the Value he sets upon, his own Iudg∣ment,
without which he could not to have made
that Choice, which is a tacit or implicit Esteem
of himself, at least of the best part of him,
his Mind, and its most weighty Operations. To
seem therefore to the World not to value himself,
is only a Dissimulation, the Tyranny of a mo¦dern
Custom imposes on him. Modern Cu∣stom,
I say, for Pliny, Cicero, Ovid, Horace, &c.

of old, proclaim'd their Opinion of their own
worth without a blush, or incurring the least
disesteem of the Age they liv'd in; it seem∣ing
unaccountable to them that a Man should
be either afraid, or asham'd to assert himself
Master of those Virtues, without which he would
be a shame to his Generation, and no better than
one of the meanest of the Vulgar. Modest Uirgil
himself seems to express his Sensibility of what
he could perform, as well as the praise of Sa∣loninus,
and Pollio in his fourth Ecclogue,
Non me carminibus Vincet nec Thracius, Orpheus
Nec Linus huic mater quamvis, at▪ huic pater adsit
Orphei Calliopeia, Lino Formosus Apollo.
Pan Deus Arcadiâ mecum si judice certet,
Pan etiam Arcadiâ dicat se judice victum.
Uirtue then, with a Noble assurance shew'd
its Face wherever it was, and Uice crept into
Corners; but now the Scene is quite turn'd,
Virtue shall lie behind the mistaken Veil of
Humility, and Modesty, whilst Vice struts about
with its bare-face, and naked Deformity, and yet
like the Sister of Calibun is caress'd by the
Trincalo's, and Stephano's of the Age.
But I must have a care of touching upon the
Age (with which the Character Petronius gives
of his, nicely agrees, Nemo coelum▪ putat, nemo
jujurandum servat, nemo Iovem pluris facit;
sed omnes Opertis oculis bona sua computant) least
it should lead me into such a Scene of Villa∣nies,
that I should forget the glorious Subject

of your Vertues, and imagin, spight of my know∣ledge
to the contrary, that there were not any
True Honour, or Courage yet in being. And
for this reason methinks I ought to offer a Vio∣lence
to your Modesty, (if what I have said be
insufficient to satisfie it) that late Posterity, when
it reads the fatal Chain, and perpetual Series of
Villanies we have seen transacted (if there be
found any more of so much Honour, and Can∣dour,
to convey 'em impartially to it) may
know, that we have not been without some
brave Men, who have preserv'd their Honour
unully'd, as the Springs in the Chalcedonian
Seas do their freshness in the midst of those
brackish Vasts of Water.
I must at least, Sir, be particular in this;
That though all the little double dealing Tricks
of Cornuted Mechanics spread their Contagion
among those that pretend very much to the
Name of Gentlemen, you retain that noble
Candour, that Freedom, and Openess, and Ge∣nerosity,
in your Actions, that first dignified
some men with that Title above the rest; that
tho' you know men, yet that, even that Know∣ledge,
is not of force enough to pervert your
stedfast Principles of Honour, and Generosity, you
directing your self not by their Villanies, but by
the Dictates of those Vertues you have propos'd
as the Model of all your Life; That Honour is
still the same with you, and varies not its Form,
or Essence, as with other men, according as
their Interest, or Passions perswade; no, you'll

perish with him that has even oppos'd your
Safety, if vicissitudes of things, and concurring
Circumstances engage your Honour in it. Few
such Examples, I can say, has any Age produc'd,
much less Ours. I'll only add, That tho' like
Alcibiades (who had a good Master in Nature,
and Philosophy) you have a true Relish of Plea∣sure,
and offer at her Shrine, being justly of
opinion, that Grace, and Nature are not at such
mortal odds, as some bigotted men would fain
perswade us in Words, not Practice, yet you
are not so devoted to it, as at all to neglect ei∣ther
the more serious, and weighty Affairs of
Life, or the Summons of Honour, whenever
that calls. What I have here said, is no more,
than what all know of you; and therefore I
need not apprehend any Censure for it. But
should I touch upon all your other Excellencies,
I fear I should be thought a Flatterer, tho' with∣out
deserving it in the least. Besides, you have
Virtues 'tis not safe in this profligate Age to
name.
As for the Book, Sir, I secure under the shel∣ter
of your Patronage; I shall only say, 'twill
discover the difference betwixt these Letters,
prompted by the several immediate Occurrences,
that occasion'd the writing of them, and those
which some Epistle-Writers have publish'd for
Examples for the World to Copy after: Na∣ture,
and Easiness appear in the first; and Stu∣dy,
and awkward Pains in the latter. 'Tis not
to be expected there should be the same Wit,

and Language in e'ery Letter, since the Occa∣sions,
and Writers are different: And they are
generally more remarkable for their Import,
than Words, and Phrase: But this, I hope, I
may say for the Comments, that you'l seldom
find an Observation wholly impertinent, or any
of them without something Moral, if not Witty.
'Tis true, they can't be suppos'd so fine, either
in their moral, or witty part, as the Reflections
of Sir Roger, in his incomparable Aesop, those
being the effect of mature, and deliberate Stu∣dy,
but these the Result of extempore Thoughts.
'Tis possible a very critical Reader may find
some seeming Contradictions betwixt our Ob∣servations
on one Letter, and those of another;
but he ought to consider, that things, as they
are differently plac'd, and dress'd, present us
with different Idea's, as one Example may
evince. Vandike (if I mistake not) or some
other eminent Painter, had a Daughter, whose
Mouth render'd her whole Face extream home∣ly,
but drawing her Picture, he so plac'd her
Hand, that it cover'd her Mouth, by which she
made a very beautiful Figure. Thus in one
Posture the same Woman was beautiful, in ano∣ther
really ugly: And so 'tis with Virtue, Vice,
and all other things, their several Positions,
Dresses, and Forms give 'em a several turn, and
so present us with several Reflections.
As for the Second Book of this Volume, I shall
only observe, that as the Letters are most of
them, if not all, written by Foreigners, so we
are not answerable for them, nor for the Re∣flections
on them neither, since the performance
only of a part of our Company, and they pret∣ty
well enter'd in good Liquor.
I shall say no more of the Book, but let it take
its Chance with the rest of the World, if it meet
but with a favourable Reception from you, Sir,
to whom I dedicate not only that, but my Self
too, who am,
SIR,
