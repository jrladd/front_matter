SIR,
I Joy to hear of your Conformity, and think what comfort it must needs be to that Reve∣rend Father, your Bishop. I wish you many and happy dayes in your Cassock and Surplice; nor am I less glad you have cast off your mourning Cloak of Presbytery, which I am sure S. Paul will ne∣ver send you back to Troas for; Praestat recur∣rere quam malè currere. These twenty years has the Church, like another Rebecca, laboured of two Nations in her troubled womb; the Pres∣byterians endeavouring might and main to sup∣plant the Bishops, and plant a company of stink∣ing Elders in their places. But (God be thanked) the Confederates have miss'd their mark. My Title-page speaks of War, but peace to you:

—Tu tantùm vivere pugna
Inque pios dominae posse redire sinus.
Which, for the better understanding of such as ne∣ver arriv'd at Corinth, is thus:
—Fight you to scape,
And safe retreat into your Ladies Lap.
But Sir, did not my good meaning hope for some Candour and acceptance, I should never have had the confidence to present your judicious eye with a Toy so beneath you. Sir, I wish you well; nay, more, that you were a Bishop: and that you may soon be so, is the hearty Prayer of him that was sometime a Member of yours, but still is, and ever shall be
SIR,
