My Lord,
THE more care∣less present times are, the more vi∣gilant your Lord∣ship is, to make and keep people zealous of good works: The same was mine endeavour in this following argument; which when I pressed, I sought, not applause, but souls: nor do
I now publish it, to have it praised, but practised.
Mine easie stile and familiar method (I hope) none will condemn; since plain∣ness is the excellency of every race, but much more of this, for this is spiritual.
The more spiritual our race here set before us is, the less it despaireth of your good Lordships implored Patro∣nage: In very truth, there is no small affinitie between our Apostles divine precept, and your Lordships Aposto∣lical pattern; in as much as your Lord∣ship is made unto us a daily example how so to run that we may obtain.
For instance: Goodly are those he∣ritages, great are those revenues, pleasant are those mansions, ancient are those honours which the bountie of God hath derived unto your Lordship; but al∣though all these ennoble your quality, they no whit (1) entangle your goodness: So doth your Lordship over-rule Temporal Blessings, that they do on∣ly administer unto your Lordships spi∣ritual
Dignities and Duties; in them and by them serveing the Church and the glory of Christ Jesus; for whose sake your Lordship most professedly advan∣ceth as well godliness as excellent gifts, and as well holiness as learning.
This is one principal cause why, with such obsequious confidence, I am bold to dedicate unto your Lordship not only this mean Sermon, but it's undeserving Authour; who ceaseth not to pray for en∣crease of sanctified blessings, both upon your Lordship, and upon your Lordships Familie: for this becometh; this de∣lighteth
