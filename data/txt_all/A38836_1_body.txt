With Humble Submission,
WHEN having considered that this present War so well begun, and carried on by Their Majesties and others the Supream Magistrates and Rulers of this Kingdom; so highly tending to the General Good and Preservation of the whole Nation, which, if well managed in all its Parts, could not fail of a happy Issue; but such is Our Misfortune, That too many there be Intrusted in the Management thereof, who, too Regardless of the Publick Good, do in their several Stations proceed in the Manage∣ment of this so great Affair, with so much Indiffe∣rency as may be justly feared, will in a great mea∣sure, retard and circumvent the Design of this so Pious and well-grounded Undertaking; I mean the War. The chief Subsistence next under God, and Their Majesties, is Money, which, being hard to

Raise, in Regard of the General Poverty of the Nation occasioned thereby, together with the Want of Trade, ought to be managed with all frugal Care and good Husbandry; for Want of which, the Treasure of the Nation is much exhau∣sted, and great Part of that which ought to be imployed to encourage Vertue and Industry, is de∣stroyed by Idleness and Extravagancy, as is fully demonstrated in the following Proposals: For, if those Persons Intrusted in the Management of the same, especially those in the Lower Sphere, would, in their several Stations, Discharge their Trust with that Care and Fidelity as they ought, the Burthen of the War would be far more easy, and all those seeming Clouds of Sorrow and Despair that do Annoy would soon vanish, and all its Attendants of Complaints and Poverty must then give Way to Courage and Magnanimity, which is the only means to vanquish and overcome Our Insulting Foes, and thereby advance the Glory of the English Na∣tion; and to this End, being moved by a zealous Design of serving and preserving as much as in me lyeth Their Majesties and the Publick, rather than any Private Interest, or Vain Desire of Pro∣fit or Preferment, I humbly take Leave to lay before your Honours these my following Proposals, as they were presented to the Right Honourable

the Commissioners for Executing the Office of Lord High-Admiral of England; together with a Brief Account of my Proceedings, before that Ho∣nourable Board as they are Inserted in this follow∣ing Tract, all which with Submission, I most hum∣bly offer to your Honour's further Considera∣tion.
