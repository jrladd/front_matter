GOOD Sir, vouchsafe to receiue this poore litle Pamâˆ£phlet, partlie as in lieu of a richer Nevvyeares gift, and partlie as a token of my thankefull minde, which is more vvilling then able to deserue any one iotte of the great fauour, friendship, and diuers benefites that I haue from time to time receiued at your hands: for want of which abilitie I neither can, nor vvill loosen my selfe from any of those bondes, vvherewith you haue most straightlie bound me, but rather to increase the same, humbly praying you to continue in your good loue and fauour tovvards me, vntill I shall willinglie deserue the contrarie: In the meane time I pray God to prosper you in all your doings, and long to preserue you.
From my poore Swans nest. 17. Decembris. 1588.
