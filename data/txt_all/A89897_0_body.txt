MADAM
I First publish'd this trea∣tise for the comfort of English Catholicks then groaning vnder a severe persecution for their Religion, whilst their false accusers pre∣tended they suffered for desig∣ning the destruction of the late King, but now manifest the

severity shewed against them was not out of a motive of Loyalty or affection to his Ma∣jesty, but out of hatred to the Catholick Religion: since at present they commit greater treasons against our soveraigne, than they accuse the Catho∣licks to have designed against his Brother: and this for no other reason but because he professes and consequently fa∣vours that Religion they aime to destroy, and now endeavour to depose him, because he will not permit them to ruin the same.
I now publish this second Edition with severall additions made by the same Author, whom since your Maiesty's ar∣rival in France you have both heard and approved, & presume

to dedicate it to your Majesty, whose sufferings in this second persecution as much exceed what Catholicks vnderwent in the former, as your condition does exceed theirs; hoping you may finde such a propor∣tionable comfort by the per∣usall of it, as several have own'd they experienc'd: and since your Majesty's constant piety prompts you to a daily Exercise of solid vertue, these daily Exercises will assist you to an easy performance of your Majestys design; and thô your couragious suffering such a change of fortune, shewes to how high a pitch of solid ver∣tue you are already arrived, yet you will here finde how large & pleasant a field vertue is that leads to that Kingdom prepa∣red

as a reward for your suffer∣ings not subject to such vicissi∣tudes as you have experienc'd these earthly Kingdoms are; and that your Majesty after a long and happy Reign with our King here, may arrive to the enjoyment of this everlasting Kingdom hereafter, are the hearty wishes and constant prayers of
MADAM
