SIR,
YOV have here before you the History of an Eminent Prelate and Patriot, a Person who lived the honour, and died a Martyr of the English Church and State, for it was his sad Fate to be crusht, betwixt Popery and Schism; and having (against both) defended the Prote∣stant Cause with his Pen, he after chearfully proceeded to Seal that Faith with his Bloud. Together with the Story of this Great Man, you have likewise that of the Age he lived in, (espe∣cially so far as concerned the Church) wherein you will find recorded, many notable Agitations and Contrivances, which it were pity should be lost in silence, and pass away unregarded. These Considerations towards a Gentleman of your worth, Curiosity, and loyalty, are warrant enough to justifie me in this Dedication. And yet I must not conceal, that it belongs to you by another right; that is to say, the Care of recommending this VVork to the Publick, was committed to a

Gentleman, who himself had presented it to your hand, if God had not taken him away, just upon the point of putting his purpose in execution. So that it seems in me, as well matter of Conscience, as of Respect, to deliver it wholly up to your Pa∣tronage and Protection; since in exposing it to the world, I do but perform the will of my dead Father; and in addressing it to your self, together with my own, I also gratifie that of my deceased Friend. The value of the VVork it self I do not pretend to judge of, my duty and interest for the Author for∣bids it, but for the Industry, Integrity, and good meaning of the Historian, I dare become answe∣rable; And in truth, I hope well of the rest: with∣out which I should not have made bold with Sir John Robinson's Name in the Front of it; who being so nearly related both in bloud and affection to that Incomparable and Zealous Mi∣nister of God, and his Prince, cannot besides a Natural, but upon an Honourable Impression, concern himself in the glories or blemishes of this Character, defective in nothing, but that it could not be as ample as his worth. And now having discharged my trust, and duty; as I could do no less, so I have little more to add for my self, but that I am
SIR,
