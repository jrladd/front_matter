May it please Your Grace,
AS a True Relation of so Famous an Action as the Taking of BUDA, with a Journal and Faithful Accompt of the various Attaques and Successes of the Impetial Armyes in each day during the Siege of that ancient City, must needs divert and surprize the Understanding of such as are curious in Heroick Story, so, my Lord, I can∣not help my own Presumption in thinking, that a∣mongst all Mankind this Peice, collected with Study and Observation, onely ought to throw it∣self at Your Grace's Feet, who, persuing the Noble Chace of Glory, were pleased to be Eye-witness of all the ensuing Passages, and can best defend my
Assertions from the Ridiculous Malice of such as envy me, either for being present at so Glorious an Action, or for addressing its History to so Ex∣traordinary a Patron.
Amongst all those, that through a Noble Thirst of Fame voluntarily offer'd themselves to share the danger that must inevitably attend so difficult an Enterprize, the English Heroe was still most Obvi∣ous; for Your Grace was so far from securing Your Person and Observations by a distant Remarque, that the Royalty of Your Courage would often precipitate You to the common Accidents of the Mercenary Vulgar, not valuing the Hazard of Your Person amongst the Hated Trunks of Pagans and Infidels, nor the trembling Hearts of such as honour'd You too much not to fear the fatal conse∣quence of so many dangerous, though brave, Ad∣ventures.
No Attacque was ever made, to Mine sprung, no Battery mounted, nor no extraordinary Exploit design'd, but still Your Grace, either in Person, or in Will, was present, not confidering how un∣commonly eager each Barbarian would have been, to have pick'd out the Flower of all the Chri∣stian Cavalry, the Blooming Genius of England, the very Soul of Valor, Royalty, and Honour, and by one hallowed Shot to have sacrific'd him to his Moody Prophet, the ridiculous Impostor, Maho∣met: But Your Guardian Angel, my Lord, that
well knew the unvalued Treasure committed to his Charge, and the glorious Character You were hereafter design'd by Providence to have in the mighty Records of eternal Fame, made the im∣partial Destinies stand aloof, encouraged by the Martial Fire still glittering in Your Eyes, and the Resolure Efforts of a Courage, that bravely shew'd the difference between the Sacred Blood of Mo∣narchs, and the subjected Cement of the grovel∣ling Vulgar, alluding, comparatively, Your Beha∣viour with that of Your Mighty Father, when the Poet addressing himself to Him, amongst the rest of his Lines, relating His Character, said thus:
Bravest in Danger, Valiant, but not Rash,
For when the Belgian Streamers brav'd the Bri∣tish Cross,
Then on the bloody Deck. He seem'd to grow,
Whil'st Fate affrighted, and the Shot too low,
Aw'd with the Terror of His dauntless Brow, &c. This, my Lord, without Flattery, I say, I may very well allude to Your Grace's Behaviour at the Siege of BUDA, for whoever had seen with what a blushing Constancy, and presence of Mind, You faced the worst of Dangers, which Thousands about Your Person could not remarque without the severest apprehensions of Fear, would have thought there must be some Divinity about You, as
well as Natural Courage, to support the Distress of so many Eminent Hazards to which You daily expos'd Your Person.
Nor do's Your Grace's excellent Character only extend itself to Arms and Glory, but branches in∣to the Confines of Industry and Ingenuity: And You are equally Renown'd for Your love to Arts as well as the other, thus proving the Royal Nature of Your most August and Invincible Father, who has ever smil'd upon the Endeavours of such as study the Mathematicks, or any other Science con∣ducing to the Benefit of His Kingdoms and Covem∣ment, and has likewise shewn the greatest En∣couragement to them of any of His Royal Prede∣cessors. And as, my Lord, I am extremely sen∣sible of the Virtues that clearly shine through all Your Actions, so now I cannot doubt a Pardon for my Ambition in Dedicating to Your Grace this my Labour, and humbly begging to be receiv'd amongst the Number of Your Admirers, and a Toleration to subscribe my self,
MY LORD,
