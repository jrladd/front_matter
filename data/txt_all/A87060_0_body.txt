Right Honourable, and my very good Lord,
As you have been a great sufferer in your Person and Estate, to the loss of more then thirty thou∣sand pounds for your fidelity and loyalty to his late Majesty of blissed memory, and yet were cheared more with the continuall feast of a good and a quiet Conscience (as I have heard you confesse) then you could have been, had you saved your estate and gained ten times that sum by engaging on the other side: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lords anoynted, and be guildesse? 1 Sam. 26.9. So no less sorrow for his sad sufferings, and chief∣ly that last fatall blow brought upon his sacred Person by the fu∣rious rage of merciless, and bloody men, when a sword did even pierce through your heart as your Lordship hath often expressed in my hearing, & in my house, whither you were pleased to retire your self aster your releasment from Oxford, and at other times; and to honour me with your presence, when we did in private poure forth our souls together in utter detestation of that horrid Fact, and in bitter lamentation for it: Therefore up∣on this account, I think not these Sermons more due to any one then your self; as also for the many obligations that lie upon me for your manifold favours and respects to me, even from your youth up till now.
It is framed in a low and plain stile, sitted for a Country Audi∣tory, and it hath alwaies been my desire and endeavour to con∣descend to the meanest capacity. My warning was very short for such a work, having scarce two dayes to prepare, by notice gi∣ven me by a worshipfull Neighbour, one of our late Burgesses in the late healing Parliament, of such a day to be kept, of which I knew nothing before.

 And although the short warning, the exhaustion of my Spirits, in Preaching twice the Lords day preceding, together with my age might have pleaded my excuse for such a task, and confind me to praying and weeping: Yet (as nothing seemes hard to a willing mind) my cordial affection to the duty (for I have in my secret prayers long wished I might live to see such a day as this, wherein we might in publick as wel express our detestation of, as lamentation for that monstrous and bloody Act) put me on with the assistance of the Divine Spirit, to a performance beyond my strength and expectation.
The dead Letter cannot be answerable to the lively Delivery; which was to the content of my Auditory, which that day was great, many of the adjoyning Parishes, where no notice was given of the day, repairing to my Church: And which was to my con∣tent, as it drew teares from mine, so from the eyes of a great part of my hearers; which is the best commendation of a Preacher.
The Lord grant it may work upon their Souls, to whose sight it shall come, whose hearts or hands, or fingers were defiled with that innocent blood; that they may be deeply humbled, and moved to repentance for such a crimson scarlet sin; and find Mercy, and obtain Pardon from Heaven, by having their hearts sprink∣led with that blood, which speakes better things then the blood of Abel. And that it may blunt and alleviate the asperity of their Spirits, who have great thoughts of heart, and those evill too, against this blessed Change, a work even of Omnipotency: And against our dear and gracious Soveraign (whom God long preserve) a King of such asweet Christian temper, for Wisdom, Discretion, Meekness, Gentleness, Pitty, Piety, Mercy, as is too good for such a churlish and unthankful People. Thus commen∣ding this poor labour to the blessing of God; and your Lordship, and family to his grace, and safe protection, I humbly take my leave, and remain

From my Study in Blechingley, February 12, 1660.
