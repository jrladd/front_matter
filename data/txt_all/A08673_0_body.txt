AS I haue greate desyre to perfourme my promise touch∣ing my whole workes of English Verses, good maister Hatton, so I wish my selfe able euerye waye to keepe the worthinesse of your Frendship, which many haue ta∣sted, and few can fynd fault withall: such is the eeuē∣nesse of your dealinges, and the vpright behauiour of the same. VVel, least I should seeme to vnfolde a far∣dle of Flattrie, I retourne to my matter My booke be∣ing vnreadye, considering I was commaunded (by a great and mighty parsonage) to write ye same againe, I am forced in the meane whyle to occupy your iudge∣ment with the reading of another mans worke, whose doings of it self, are sufficiēt to purchase good report, albeit it wanted such a Patron as you are to defende it. The rest of that woorke which as yet is not come forth, I purpose to pen and set out, crauing a litle lea∣sure for the same. And surely sir, I blush that myne owne booke beares not a better Tytle, but the base∣nes of the matter wil not suffer it to beare any higher

name, than Churchyardes Chyps: for in the same are sondry tryfles composed in my youth, and such fruicte as those dayes and my simple knowledge coulde yelde, so that the aptest name for such stuffe, was as I thou∣ght, to geue my workes this Title, to be called Church¦yardes Chips (to warme the wittes of his welwillers.) In my first booke shalbe three Tragedies, two tales, a Dreame, a description of Frendship, a Farewell to the Court, the siege of Leeth and sondry other thin∣ges yt are already written. And in my seconde Booke shalbe foure Tragedies, ten Tales, the Siege of Saint Quintaynes, Newhauen, Calleis, and Guynes, and I hope the rest of all the sorrein warres, that I haue seene or heard of abroade, shall follow in another vo∣lume.
Thus commending this little present to your cōsi∣deration, I trouble you not long with the tediousnes of my Epistle, and wishing you muche worshippe, good ame and blessed fortune, I bydde you moste hartely farewell.
