HAuing Preached this Sermō amon∣gest you (woorship∣full Sirs) seeing the General wel liking thereof, and there∣withall the desire of some to haue the copy of the same: I chose rather to commit it to the Printer, then to copy it out in writing: because that as the labour should bee easier vnto my selfe, so the benefite should bee greater vnto more. And this I haue done, not vpon the absolute well ly∣king of the maner of my labour ther∣in, which I confesse simple: but onely the cōsideration of the matter therof
 which for this time I see necessary: containing, as appeareth in the dis∣course thereof, the woonderfull ad∣uauncement of our most gratious so∣ueraigne Q. Elizabeth to the crowne of this Realme, to the singular bene∣fite of vs all: that vpon the conside∣ration therof we might bee the more stirred vp to yeeld dutifull thankful∣nes and prayer vnto God for her: the one in that hee first aduaunced her thereunto, and preserued her hether∣too therin: the other, that hee would still preserue and prosper her in the gouernment of the same. And I haue thought it requisite to dedicate this my labour vnto you: not onely be∣cause it was preached amongest you: but principally because of those pas∣sing great curtesies which I haue cō∣tinually receaued at your hands: For the which as I can not but acknow∣ledge my selfe wholly indebted farre beyond my power fully to requite: so do I acknowledge my selfe euery way bound to testify my thankfulnes vn∣to you, which is the only recompēce, which either you demaund, or I can
 geue againe for them. Wherefore vouchsafe, I pray you Woorshipfull Sirs, (as an vndoubted testimony therof) to accept this same at my hands: who as I am alwaies, and by al waies ready prest, according to duty, with all the power of body and mynde, to seeke your spiritual profite: so am I as rea∣dy at this present, herein to satisfy your Godly desires. The Lord heape vpon you the manifold graces of his holy Spirite in aboundant measures, to the benefite of his Church, whereof yee are members: of the Common wealth, whereof yee are subiectes: but yet principally of that Corporation, whereof yee are Magistrates, to your praise on earth, and eternall glory in the highest Heauens. At Lidd. this first of Ianuary. 1587.
