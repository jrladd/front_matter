DEar Father, because this fol∣lowing discourse wants an Indulgent Reader, therefore I thought good to present it first to your hands, hoping you will readily pass by those failings which may appear therein, and cloath them with your fa∣vourable construction and Fatherly love, and look further then the shell, even to the kernell and marrow of this business, I shall not present it to you as a free gift, but as my obliged duty, as a small part of requital for your Incessant love. I in∣treat you to consider seriously of the mat∣ter and not to undervalue it, because of the meanness of the Author; but know I pray you that Gods way and course in the dayes of the Gospel is to appear in weak means to advance his own glory, that no
flesh may glorie in his presence: Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, he will perfect his praise; and not onely so, but he will lay low the wisdom of the World, and the pride of men who stumble at Christ, because he is so obscure in the World that they cannot see him, neither will they stoop so low as to take notice of him; but I hope better things of you, therefore accept this small fruit from me, and what benefit you receive I doubt not but you will be ready to give God the praise. So fare-well.
