FInding such various Opinions concerning the first and fundamental Rules of Iustice, urged with great Animosity, and that the Laws of Nations were alledged by all sides: I resolved, after having studied the Roman Laws and the Municipal Law of our own Nation forty years, to spend some time in enquiring seriously into the Laws of Nations. For this end I retired into your Famous University, whose Library the Learn∣ed and Curious Selden has inriched with Books on these Subjects, beyond what is to be found in any other in Europe; nor could it be thought that any thing could have been added to his excellent Collection, if your extraordi∣nary Care, and this last Age, had not furnish∣ed you with many Books which either had

And who, residing among you, could see in your Libra∣ries the fame of learned Men of all Nations still so fresh, or could converse with many of your own now living, who have made profound Learning even useful and witty, without be∣ing forced by a noble Emulation to leave all other Pleasures, that he might retire unto your Libraries, or his own Closet, there to purchase some share of that improvement which every private Mans Breast concurs with the World to esteem.
