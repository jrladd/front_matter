Honoured Sir,
I Am not ignorant
that we now live in
as censorious an age
as even the Sun
shin'd on; wherein
there are not a few
that will snap and snarle at the po∣litest
lines, and refined'st inventi∣ons
whatsoever; (when perhaps
the matter is too deep, for the short
line of their Judgements to sound

the bottom of:) What hard mea∣sure
then I am like to have, for suf∣fering
this my naked and incult
Muse to venture abroad on the o∣pen
stage, I am not a little sensible
of. But yet, because private bene∣fits,
do often call for publick ac∣knowledgements,
I will not be a∣shamed
to let the world know, I
am exceedingly engaged to you;
nor could I be contented till I had
made some part of amends for your
received favours; Presuming that
your Heroick minde, sweet nature,
and generous disposition, will re∣spect
more (Artaxerxes-like) the
inward Affection, then the outward
Action. Be pleas'd therefore,
Noble Sir, to persist still in your
wonted goodness, and favourably
accept of that in the birth, which
your encouragements furthered in
the conception. The subject I
confess is Divine (as treating of a

Bush all in a flame, yet not consum∣ed;
enough to dazle our eyes with
its astonishing glory) and therefore
deferves to be better handled, by a
more Graphical Paraphrast then my
self: And if my jangling toll in bet∣ter
ringers, I shall be glad of it; In
the mean, I will let my green fruits
ripen under the Sun-shine of your
judicious Eye: and though my
lines (like old Pewter) seem dull for
want of scowring; yet may they
receive a gloss from your resplen∣dent
Name. Pythagoras was of
opinion,Aelian. Var Hist. l. 12. p. 343. that two things (and they
from above) made a man truly glo∣rious;
the one was, To conceive
aright of things; the other was,
To know how to be beneficial to
others. Sweet Sir, I will not flat∣ter
you (for I am confident you do
not desire it, chusing rather to be
too modestly spoken of, then to be
mounted on the wings of Popular

applause) but I dare say, you are
endowed with both: You have af∣fected
to be acquainted with the na∣tures
of most (may I say all?) disea∣ses;
and have effected (God making
your undertakings succesful) as rare
cures as ever any, I will except none.
I cannot stand to specifie them; this
one shall serve for all: Your emi∣nent
skill in recovering Epilepti∣cal
maladies, is sufficiently known
to many. What shall I say of my
self in particular? am not I bound
to bless God, since first I had the
happiness to be acquainted with
you? Have not I great cause to
admire (and, if I may so say, adore
you for) your profound judgment,
your excellent ability, and singular
care, so oportunely exercised to∣wards
me your Patient, in the rai∣sing
up of my infirm body, even
then, when I had passed the sentence
of death upon my self, and was

thought, in the eyes of all, irre∣coverable?
I were unworthy to
live, if I did not.
Theodoricus,Aeneas Syl. Com: lib. de gestis Alphonsi. an Archbishop of
Colen, being demanded by Sigismund
the Emperor, of the directest course
to Happiness; Perform (said he)
when thou art well, what thou pro∣misedst
when thou wast sick. This
puts me in minde of a double en∣gagement
which I made in the time
of my calamity; First, to God Al∣mighty,
That I would endeavour,
if he but pleased to spare me my
life, to devote my self wholly to his
fear, and walk more obediently be∣fore
him, then I had formerly done:
Next to you, as the onely instru∣ment
in the hand of God, for the
repairing of the ruinous walls of
my fleshly Tenement, I promised to
agnize it, so long as I liv'd. I be∣seech
God, that these promises may
be the prodromes of seconding per∣formances▪

I pray Sir, give me
leave to tell you, you are the onely
man living, whom I superlatively
honour, not onely for your learning
and knowledge (though that were
enough to convince me) but for
your inestimable Vertues; as Tem∣perance,
Humility, &c. which
are as so many sparkling Orna∣ments,
and Orient Pearls, to enrich
and illustrate the very place you
come in. To speak nothing of
your Piety, that onely will com∣mend
you in the eyes of God. I
might say, and say truly, that you
are such a common good to your
Country, that good men love you,
and all men admire you: but I will
not gild Gold; neither may I think
that bright Phaebus beams can be
the more increased by the present∣ing
of a silly Taper: nay, I am
somewhat conscious to my self
of eclipsing the great Luminary

of your serene worth, with the
obumbration of a Timanthaean
veil.
If I have herein offended, it is
against my will; I am sorry for it;
and I hope your ingenuity will
pardon me, laying the fault on the
defects of my Youth, as being not
over-burthened with Ciceronian
Eloquence. But what though I
cannot cloathe my minde in such
fine airy garments, nor adorn my
Paper with such Rhetorical jewels
as others can? yet may I as deeply
engrave you on the Marble Tablet
of my fidelious brest, as any, while I
am,
Sir,
The eLeVenth
Day of March
MDCLV.
