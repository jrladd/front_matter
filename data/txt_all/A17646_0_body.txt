IT is not long sithens right Re∣uerend Father that J purposed the Dedication of a sermon of M. Iuel by me translatd out of the Latine, vnto your Honour, which for the brefenesse and smalnesse of the vo∣lume thereof J passed vndedicated for a season, notwithstanding the worthie mat∣ter therein conteyned might sufficiently commend it as a thing of very great im∣portaunce: And nowe hauing translated also this commentarie of that learned man and godly Father I. Caluine vpon the E∣pistle of Saint Paule to the Galathians, I thought it my duetie (especially in that I take my selfe to be bounde to render an ac∣count of my studie in parte vnto your Ho∣nour) ioyning the same together with the
 Sermon afore specified to dedicate both at once vnto your Lordship, desiring that you will vouchsafe to accept of them with such an affection as the authoures of both (J meane Juel and Caluine) haue both for their godlinesse in life, excellēcie in know∣ledge, and painfulnesse in vtteringe the truth, full well deserued, whereof I make in doubtes. And therfore without troub∣ling your Lordship any furder with more circumstaunces being otherwise occupied in waightie and great matters, J commend the same together with your affaires to the defence and protection of the moste highest who euer preserue your Honour.
The first of Au∣gust. 1581.
