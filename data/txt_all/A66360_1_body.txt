May it please your Honours,
THe Spirit of God long agoe hath foretold it, out of his grrat love unto his Church, what sad accidents, and heavie disasters, should fall upon her for the times to come, even to the end of the world; and amongst all the rest of her crosses, that she must una∣voydably undergoe; this is none of the leaft, if it be not of greatest importance, that the beast which ascendeth out of the bottomlesse pit, which is interpreted to be the man of sin, and the child of perdition, as Saint Paul calleth him, that is, the Great Antichrist, should kill the two wit∣nesses of Jesus Christ; that is,
1. The Monarchie, or supreme Monarch, that hath the soveraign Majesty, and the supremest power, to rule the people, and to place other subordinate Magistrates and offi∣cers under him, for the execution of justice in all the parts of his dominions.

2. The Hierarchie or Episcopal government of Gods Church, which is as requisite for the Church, as the Mo∣narchie is for the Common-wealth; for the Church of Christ is said to be Gods vineyard, and the vineyard must be well fenced, or, if the hedge be broken down, all the wild beasts of the Forest will destroy the vine; so must the Church be well fenced and guarded, by wise, discreet and careful Governours, (which are as the fence and hedges,) that by their spiritual Courts and censures, do keep out all Sectaries, and hereticks, and all errrours and heresies, and false doctrine, from the Vineyard of God, which is the Church of Christ.
And if these hedges and fences of Gods Church, the Bishops and Governours thereof, be broken down, their Court supprest, and themselves nullified and annihilated, as that long Parliament did, it is as impossible, to keep out Sects, Hereticks, and false Prophets from the Church, as it is to keep the civil state, and common-wealth in peace, and to have justice and equity duly preserved among all men, without the civil Magistrates, and their Courts of justice: for as these protect the innocent, and punish the Malesactors, with the powerful sword of justice; so must the Bishops and Governours of the Church, which are best able to judge of divine questions, defend the truth, and, as Christ whipped the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, so must they by their censures, whip all those Sectaries and Heteticks, that will not other wise by fair means be driven, out of Gods Church; because, as Saint Bernard saith, qui nolunt duci, debent trahi.
And it is not unknown to any, that hath taken notice of the transac ions of these times, how that long, lasting, and intended to be an endlesse everlasting Parliament, hath kil∣led our most heroical, religious, and renowned King, the most constant Martyr, and the first and chiefest of the two witnesses of Jesus Christ, and also Doctor William Laud Arch-Bishop of Cantcrbury, and suppressed all the Bi∣shops, that were the other witnesse of Christ.
But our good God hath promised, that he would re∣suscitate
and revive the slain and slaughtered Witnesses, and restore them to the Church, and their charge again; Re∣vel. 11.11, 12. And now you see, how the wise and great God, whose wayes are in the seas, his paths in the great waters, and his foot-steps are not known, hath by unlikely, unprobable, and almost, in mans judgement, impossible wayes, through the many many transmutations of things, and alterations of governments, brought his own purpo∣ses to this passe, to make you the instruments, to effect his will, to perform his promise, and to be that Cloud, in which, and by which, the two slain Witnesses shall ascend to heaven; chapt. 11. verse 12. and hath given you power and authority, and inabled you to do the same.
And now, most honourable, and most renowned Pa∣triots, you have most justly, most religiously, and most gloriously, to your everlasting praise, revived the first and chief Witnesse of Jesus Christ, and restored the government of these nations to be Monarchicall, that doth most resemble God himselfe, which is the sole Monarch of all the world, and is the government that the most nations of all the world hath ever used, and especially this kingdome, since the first peopling of it; and you have put the Crown upon His head, to whom your wis∣domes knew, It justly belonged, which was the onely way to bring Peace, and to make these kingdomes happy.
It resteth, that the other Witnesse of Christ be revived, and the Government of the Church be restored, as it hath been ever fince the Apostles time, to be Episcopal; and so to raise the Bishops, and other Ministers, their de∣pendants (that, as yet, lye unburied in the streets of the great City) to their pristine dignity, to their offices, their authority, and their former estates; for their inabling to discharge their duties in the government of God's Church, they having suffered wrongs and indignities enough already. And I hope your wisdomes will direct you, to let the Ark of God be carried upon the Levite's
shoulders, as the Lord commandeth, and suffer the wor∣ship and service of God to be used, as it was in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, King James, and King Charles, and confirmed by all the Acts of Parliaments, and royall edicts in their times; and not to suffer the depra∣vers of Gods honour, and disturbers of the Peace of the Church, out of any singularity or sinister end, ei∣ther to suppresse the same, or any wayes to alter it, or any part of it, unlesse your wisdomes do appoint a full and lawful Synod, congregated after the usuall manner of this Church, to confider what is fit, if any thing be found fitting to be added, diminished, or altered there∣in; for this care of Gods service, to uphold the same in its integrity and purity, is the onely thing that will bring a blessing, and continue the happinesse of this, or any other nation: and they are to do the same, to whom God hath committed the government of his Church, and the teaching of his people.
And because of the multiplicity of Sects, and diver∣sity of opinions that have sprung in this our Church since the killing of the witnesses, and that the faith of Christ is to be perswaded, by the word of God, and not forced by the sword of man; I humbly beseech you, to grant such toleration, as your wisdomes shall think fitting, to such weak and tender consciences, as can∣not, on the sudden, comply with us in our service to God, untill that by a friendly conference, painfull preaching, and writing of learned books, we captivate their understanding, and bring them so to the truth, and true faith of Christ, and service of God; and not by rigid wayes; and too severe censures and punish∣ments, to compell them, either to be hypocrites in our Church, or Apostates, to run out of our Church. For I would not have the people of God to be driven, hur∣ried, and harrased, like as we drive wild beasts, but to be led gently, and eafily, like sheep; Leni spiritu, non dura manu, by an inward sweet influence, and not by any outward violence.

And here I humbly beseech your Honours to give me leave to tell you; what I am not suffered to be silent, videlicet, that to take away the Lands and possessions of men, that never rebelled, nor offered any violence, nor the least wrong, to any of our Protestant people in Ireland, but relieved them, and hindred others as much as they could, to abuse them, and yet to dispossesse, and to cast them out of their inheritances, be∣cause they were Papists, and profest themselves Roman Catholicks (as the long Parliament, and their subordinate instruments in Ireland have done, to the utter ruine of many ancient families, both of Brittish and English extract) is not onely, as I conceive, most unjust, but also contrary to all Christianity, and farre enough from humanity it selfe.
When the Apostle bids us, to honour all men, that is, be∣cause they are men, be they of what religion soever they please, their different sense should not make us to destroy them, so long as they live peaceably amongst us, as you know the Sodomites permitted Lot, that professed not their religion, and the severe Pharisees suffered both the Sadduces and Essaei, to enjoy both their lands and their estates, with∣out troubling them for their religion; and would you make the Christian religion more unjust, and worse then these? Sure none would do that, but the great Antichrist, that would hinder all, to think well of the religion of Christ.
Therefore I hope your wisdomes and justice will be so far from confirming any injustice done by that long Parlia∣ment, or their under-agents, either to these displanted Irish, or ejected Clergy, or any others, that you will christianly redresse, what they have so unjustly done amisse: lest the continuance of these crying wrongs here on earth, do pull down upon us all the flying vengeance of God,
Vivat Rex, currat lex, fiat justitia & ruat mundus. from hea∣ven. Because the good God is just, and loveth justice, ha∣ting all oppressions and wrongs; and therefore, as I would not belie the Father of lies, so I would not do any injustice to the very devils; and let no sinister aspect bend you from
the straight rule of justice, and if you will not redresse the too much wrong that we have suffered already, I beseech you confirm them not by any new lawes, to make your selves partakers of their sins, and to make us still to crye, with the soules under the Altar, how long Lord, holy and true, but let us have the benefit of our old lawes, that were just∣ly made, and if you will not nullify all the acts that are without our late Kings assent, or perhaps cannot do it, be∣cause so many of that long Parliament, are members of this present Parliament, contrary to the desires of many, yet let the justice of our old lawes still continue; and we shall still continue our prayers to God, that he may still continue his blessings both to you and yours, which is and shall be, the daily prayers of
