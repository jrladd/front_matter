To my Deare mother,
the most famous Universitie
of Oxford.
I HAVE ob∣serv'd
(most
deare Mo∣ther)
and
that in most
of thy Sons, a Complexion
of Fame, and Ingratuitie.
Learning indeed they

have, but they forget the
Brests that gave it. Thy
Good works meet not
with one Samaritan, but
Many hast thou cur'd
of the Leprosie of Igno∣rance.
This is the spot,
that soyls our perfections:
we have all drunk of thy
Fountaine, but we sacri∣fice
not the Water to the
Well. For my own part,
I can present thee with
nothing that's Voluminous,
but here is a Mustard∣seed,

which may grow
to be the Greatest amongst
Herbs.Mat. 13. 32. The Draught it
self hath nothing of na∣ture,
but what is under
the Veile: I wish indeed
thou mayst see her sine
Flammeo, but her face
like that of the Annun∣iata
expects the Pencil
of an Angell. I cannot say
this Composure deserves
thy Patronage, but give
me leave to make it my
Opportunitie, that I may

returne the Acknowledge∣ment,
where I receiv'd
the Benefit. I intend not
my Addresse for the
Banks of Isis; Thou hast
no Portion there, unlesse
thy Stones require my
Inscription. It is thy Dis∣persed
Body I have
knowne, and That only
I remember. Take it then
wheresoever Thou art,
in thy sad Removes and
Visitations. It is neither
Sadducee nor Pharisee,

but the Test of an Israe∣lite,
and
Thy Legitimat Child.
1650.
