GAllant brave Sonnes of Mars you must not looke
That here's ought worth your reading in this Book,
Since I intend not further for to goe
Then to the Letters of our Christ-crosse-row:
To shew the Vowels, or to learn to spell
In Disciplines high strains I will not mell.
But if, perhaps, you have a mind to scan
Or spie faults in the Yong Artillery-man,
I pray you for your credits as mine owne
You'l picke no fault till you be sure 'tis one
And then (perhaps) when Reason taking place,
Opinion must retreit with foule disgrace.
Yet if you truly shall an Errour spie
Tell me my fault, I'le not in Error die.
Then worthy Followers in great Mars his traine,
That to peruse my worthlesse worke will deigne,
Iudge but the best, and you, perhaps, shall see
The next I write shall a farre better bee
In the, mean time, this is the best I have
Prove and approve. And more I will not crave.
