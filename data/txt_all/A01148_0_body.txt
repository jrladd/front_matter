SIr, I am so bolde, as to present you and your worthy Lady, with a most memo∣rable and iudicious labour of a Ladie▪ lately conuerted from the dimme and grosse errours of superstitious Poperie, to the profession of Gods true Religion and holie Gospell. The reason of her Conuersion, and many palpable abuses, (besides blasphemies and sacri∣ledges) committed in Poperie: Shee hath set downe in an excellent Epist le, and sent the same to her wonted friends and familiars, the Ladies of Fraunce, to encourage them in the imitation of this her godly example. My vnfained loue to your Worship, your louing Ladie, and all yours, I trust shall pleade my pardon for this presumption: In hope whereof, most humblie I commit you all to the hea∣uenlie protection.
