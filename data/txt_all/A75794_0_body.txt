SIR,
FInding Encouragement for a new Edition of the Ladies Travels, as I had just Reason from your Merits before, to dedicate a part of them to you, so the Continuation of your particular Favours makes me take this Opportunity to acknowledge them, and now to Address the Whole. I found the former Editions to have good Suc∣cess under your Name; so that both Profit and Gratitude oblige me again to beg you to take this Work of the Fair Sex into your further Protection and Patronage. Your Great Skill in that Excellent Art, which with so much Life and Pleasure represents the La∣dies, besides your other extraordinary
 Qualifications, endears you to them, and I hope will influence them to help me off with this Impression. They will certainly for the Honour of their Sex, contribute to let this Incompara∣ble Lady's Productions have a more extensive Spread and Acquaintance.
Pardon me, Sir, and give me leave to conclude with my humble Thanks for all your Civilities and Kindnesses, and my hearty Wishes for your Pro∣sperity. I am,
SIR,
