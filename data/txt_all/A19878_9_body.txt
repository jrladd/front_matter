THe joyes of eager Youth, of Wine, and Wealth,
Of Faith untroubled, and unphysick'd Health;
Of Lovers, when their Nuptials nie,
Of Saints forgiven when they die;
Let this yeare bring
To Charles our King:
To Charles, who is th'example, and the Law,
By whom the good are taught, not kept in awe.



Long proffer'd Peace, and that not compass'd by
Expensive Treaties but a Victorie;
And Victories by Fame obtain'd,
Or pray'r, and not by slaughter gain'd;

Let this yeare bring:
To Charles our King.
To Charles; who is th'example, and the Law,
By whom the good are taught, not kept in awe.



A Session too, of such who can obey,
As they were gather'd to consult, not sway:
Who not rebell, in hope to git
Some office to reclaime their wit;
Let this yeare bring
To Charles our King;
To Charles; who is th'example and the law,
By whom the good are taught, not kept in awe.



Prators, who will the publique cause defend,
With timely gifts, not Speeches finely pend;
So make the Northerne Victors Fame
No more our envy, nor our shame;
Let this yeare bring
To Charles our King:
To Charles; who is th'example, and the law,
By whom the good are taught, not kept in awe.
